HIF-2alpha promotes von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-deficient renal clear cell carcinoma 
(RCC) tumorigenesis, while HIF-1alpha inhibits RCC growth. As HIF-1alpha 
antagonizes c-Myc function, we hypothesized that HIF-2alpha might enhance c-Myc 
activity. We demonstrate here that HIF-2alpha promotes cell-cycle progression in 
hypoxic RCCs and multiple other cell lines. This correlates with enhanced c-Myc 
promoter binding, transcriptional effects on both activated and repressed target 
genes, and interactions with Sp1, Miz1, and Max. Finally, HIF-2alpha augments 
c-Myc transformation of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Enhanced c-Myc 
activity likely contributes to HIF-2alpha-mediated neoplastic progression 
following loss of the VHL tumor suppressor and influences the behavior of 
hypoxic tumor cells.

Abstract

HIF-2α promotes von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) deficient renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC) tumorigenesis, while HIF-1α inhibits RCC growth. As HIF-1α antagonizes c-Myc function, we hypothesized that HIF-2α might enhance c-Myc activity. We demonstrate here that HIF-2α promotes cell cycle progression in hypoxic RCCs and multiple other cell lines. This correlates with enhanced c-Myc promoter binding, transcriptional effects on both activated and repressed target genes, and interactions with Sp1, Mizl and Max. Finally, HIF-2α augments c-Myc transformation of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Enhanced c-Myc activity likely contributes to HIF-2α mediated neoplastic progression following loss of the VHL tumor suppressor, and influences the behavior of hypoxic tumor cells.

Introduction

Low oxygen (O 2 ) levels are frequently encountered in solid tumors, and hypoxic stress responses have important effects on the natural history of disease ( Pugh and Ratcliffe, 2003 ). Tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis are all regulated by hypoxia stimulated gene expression, largely mediated by Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs). HIFs function as heterodimers in which the O 2 -labile α-subunits form a complex with a stable β-subunit (also known as ARNT) and bind hypoxia response elements (HREs) throughout the genome. Two α-subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, have been demonstrated to increase target gene transcription in hypoxic cells. When complexed with ARNT, they activate genes such as those encoding glycolytic enzymes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-2 and erythropoeitin ( Hu et al., 2003 ; Semenza, 2003 ). The HIFs can alter cell cycle progression through putative transcriptional targets such as Cyclin D1 ( Baba et al., 2003 ) and indirect modulation of p21 and p27 ( Gardner et al., 2001 ; Green et al., 2001 ; Koshiji et al., 2004 ).

While initial characterization of hypoxia-induced transcription focused on HIF-1α, HIF-2α has recently been shown to regulate unique genes and physiologic functions ( Covello et al., 2006 ; Hu et al., 2003 ; Tian et al., 1998 ). The HIF-α subunits differ in expression profiles, with HIF-1α expressed ubiquitously and HIF-2α limited to endothelium, kidney, heart, lungs and small intestine ( Ema et al., 1997 ; Tian et al., 1997 ; Wiesener et al., 2003 ). HIF-1α uniquely activates glycolytic enzyme genes, while HIF-2α preferentially activates VEGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), lysyl oxidase, Oct4 and Cyclin D1 ( Baba et al., 2003 ; Covello et al., 2006 ; Erler et al., 2006 ; Gunaratnam et al., 2003 ; Hu et al., 2003 ; Wang et al., 2005 ). Targeted disruption of the HIF-2 α locus in different mouse strains results in distinct phenotypes, including embryonic lethality due to bradycardia and vascular defects, perinatal lethality due to impaired lung maturation, and embryonic and post-natal lethality caused by multi-organ failure and mitochondrial dysfunction ( Compernolle et al., 2002 ; Peng et al., 2000 ; Scortegagna et al., 2003 ; Tian et al., 1998 ). Each of these is quite different from the E10.5 lethality caused by cardiac and vascular defects restating from HIF-1 α disruption ( Carmeliet et al., 1998 ; Iyer et al., 1998 ; Ryan et al., 1998 ).

HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α, promotes tumor growth in RCC xenograft models. Overexpression of stable HIF-2α in 786-O RCC cells expressing pVHL restores xenograft growth to the level of parental VHL null cells ( Kondo et al., 2003 ; Kondo et al., 2002 ; Raval et al., 2005 ), whereas overexpression of stable HIF-1α inhibits tumor growth ( Maranchie et al., 2002 ; Raval et al., 2005 ). Studies of pre-neoplastic lesions from the kidneys of patients with VHL disease also suggest a role for HIF-2α in the transformation of dysplastic cells, as HIF-2α expression increased with the degree of dysplasia, whereas HIF-1α expression decreased ( Mandriota et al., 2002 ; Raval et al., 2005 ). HIF-2α also appears to have a more general role in promoting tumorigenesis. Subcutaneous teratomas generated from ES cells with the HIF-2α cDNA “knocked in” to the HIF-1 α locus exhibit four-fold greater mass than WT controls, largely due to increased proliferation ( Covello et al., 2005 ). This is not simply the result of HIF-1α loss, as multiple studies with Hif-1 α −/− ES cell-derived teratomas failed to demonstrate a consistent growth advantage ( Carmeliet et al., 1998 ; Hopfl et al., 2002 ; Ryan et al., 1998 ). A recent study in neuroblastoma has shown HIF-2α stabilization under prolonged, but mild hypoxia, raising the intriguing possibility that HIF-2α may promote angiogenesis even in tumors experiencing minimal hypoxic stress ( Holmquist-Mengelbier et al., 2006 ).

Moderate levels of hypoxia (0.5% – 3% O 2 ) can cause cell cycle arrest through a HIF-1α dependent increase in cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p21 and p27 expression ( Gardner et al., 2001 ; Goda et al., 2003 ; Green et al., 2001 ). p21 and p27 are not direct HIF targets; their expression changes as a result of HIF-1α inhibition of the proto-oncogene c-Myc and consequent relief of transcriptional repression at their promoters ( Koshiji et al., 2004 ; Koshiji et al., 2005 ; Mack et al., 2005 ). HIF-1α may antagonize c-Myc activity by altering interaction with Sp1, one of its co-factors ( Koshiji et al., 2004 ; Koshiji et al., 2005 ). There are no published data as yet on HIF-2α effects on cell cycle progression.

c-Myc is a basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) transcription factor that controls the G1-S cell cycle transition and is overexpressed in many human tumors ( Adhikary and Eilers, 2005 ; Nilsson and Cleveland, 2003 ). c-Myc activates the transcription of growth promoting genes such as Cyclin D2, ornithine decarboxylase, and E2F1 by binding to a conserved E box (CACGTG) with its binding partner Max, and inhibits the expression of multiple genes, notably p21 and p27, by binding to the transcription initiator element (Inr) in a complex with Max and either Sp1 or Miz1 ( Coller et al., 2000 ; Fernandez et al., 2003 ). As c-Myc is normally labile and expressed at low levels, it competes for Max binding with antagonistic transcription factors such as Mad, Mnt and Mga. Interestingly, Mad/Max complexes repress expression via E boxes, while Miz1 functions as a transcriptional activator when bound to an Inr without c-Myc ( Adhikary and Eilers, 2005 ).

Given that HIF-1α and HIF-2α may have opposite effects on renal tumor growth and the established inhibitory effect of HIF-1α on c-Myc ( Koshiji et al., 2004 ; Koshiji et al., 2005 ), we hypothesized that HIF-2α actually promotes c-Myc transcriptional activity. This would result in enhanced cell cycle progression and increased tumor growth. We have examined 786-O and RCC4 RCCs with restored pVHL expression, embryonic epithelial cells (ECs), and NIH3T3 cells, and observed HIF-2α mediated enhancement of c-Myc activity and cell cycle progression. As a control, HIF-1α effects were also assessed in each context, and HIF-1α exhibited the anticipated inhibition of proliferation. HIF-2α also has a role in tumor initiation, promoting c-Myc/RasV12G induced transformation in primary MEFs.

Discussion

In this study, we found that HIF-2α promotes c-Myc transcriptional activity and cell cycle progression in renal carcinoma cells, NTH3T3 cells, HEK293 cells, and embryonic epithelial cells. Furthermore, HIF-2α promotes MEF transformation in concert with RasV12G and c-Myc. This is a novel pathway, and we believe it contributes substantially to the proliferation of normal and transformed cells under hypoxia, as well as the transformation of cells that have lost the VHL tumor suppressor. It is also the first description of HIF-1α and HIF-2α effects that directly oppose each other by altering a common pathway.

Previous data have demonstrated that HIF-1α modulates c-Myc function in hypoxic cells. In those studies, HIF-1α was shown to inhibit c-Myc transcriptional activity by inhibiting DNA binding, specifically through competition for Sp1 ( Koshiji et al., 2004 ; Koshiji et al., 2005 ; To et al., 2006 ). We have repeated these findings, and also observed HIF-1α/Max binding, which may block c-Myc/Max interaction. While in previous studies, HIF-1α also bound DNA in the same location as c-Myc, we observed HIF-α binding at the p21 Inr but not the five other c-Myc target promoters tested, suggesting that displacement is not required to modulate c-Myc. HIF-2α also appears to regulate c-Myc by modulating c-Myc/Sp1, c-Myc/Miz1 and c-Myc/Max interactions. When HIF-2α is present, more c-Myc/Max, c-Myc/Miz and c-Myc/Sp1 complexes and fewer Mad/Max complexes are detected compared to normoxia. HIF-2α co-precipitated with Max, suggesting that it also interacts with these proteins, either through direct binding or as part of a larger complex. Based on these data and those previously reported ( Koshiji et al., 2005 ; To et al., 2006 ), we propose the following model ( Figure 8E ): We believe that the presence of HIF-1α directly blocks c-Myc interaction with its DNA binding partners. HIF-2α, on the other hand, might promote c-Myc interaction with Max, and thus Sp1 and Miz1, by recruiting it directly to these complexes, or by stabilizing these complexes once they are formed. This might occur by selectively blocking Max interaction with Mad1, which competes with c-Myc for available cellular Max. Understanding the precise effects of HIF-1α/Max, HIF-1α/Sp1, and HIF-2α/Max interactions will require further analysis of the multimeric complexes formed.

Multiple HIF-2α targets besides c-Myc promote proliferation and transformation, and are necessary for tumor growth. HIF-2α directly activates the expression of Oct4, Cyclin D1, and TGFα, each of which can promote transformation in MEFs or NIH3T3 cells ( Alt et al., 2000 ; Gidekel et al., 2003 ; Twardzik et al., 1982 ). HIF-2α activation of these targets is not responsible for transformation in our study as Oct4 and TGF-α were not detected in transformed MEF cell lines or NIH3T3 cells described above, and similar mRNA and protein levels were observed for Cyclin D1 regardless of HIF-α expression (data not shown). However, the activation of other HIF-2α targets may collaborate in c-Myc driven proliferation and transformation by blocking its effects on apoptosis.

Although HIF-2α is unique in its ability to promote proliferation and transformation, it shares HIF-1α's effects on angiogenesis, invasion, and metabolism, all of which contribute to tumor growth and progression. Many clinical studies have correlated the presence of either HIF-α subunit with poor patient outcomes. However, differential effects of the HIF-α submits may play a key role in cells that have more intact cell cycle control, as is the case for pre-neoplastic cells as well as many scientific model systems. Similarly, the amplitude of HIF-α activation may alter which pathways or effects are more dominant. For example, HIF-1α activation in Vhl −/− Ras-transformed MEFs inhibits subcutaneous allograft growth ( Mack et al., 2005 ), while Hif-1 α −/− Ras-transformed MEFs form smaller subcutaneous tumors than their WT counterparts ( Ryan et al., 2000 ). Notably, the Vhl −/− MEFs exhibited enhanced vascularity but limited proliferation in vitro whereas the Hif-1 α −/− MEFs exhibited limited VEGF expression. It appears that hypoxic HIF-1α activation is necessary for tumor angiogenesis, whereas continuous activation inhibits cell cycle progression. Modulation of hypoxic cell survival can also change tumor behavior, as observed in a recent study where HIF-1α or HIF-2α were overexpressed in glioma cells ( Acker et al., 2005 ). Glioma is well known for extensive hypoxic domains with substantial cell death. This was promoted by HIF-α overexpression, leading to decreased tumor size due to apoptosis ( Acker et al., 2005 ). Thus, each HIF-α may have the potential to be a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the biology of a given tumor type and its stage of development.

These data have significant implications for tumor initiation and progression in multiple tumor types. In the context of RCC, several HIF-2α targets appear to be important in tumor initiation and progression, including VEGF, Oct4 and TGFα. Our data showing that HIF-2α promotes MEF transformation whereas HIF-1α inhibits it, support the evidence that relative increases in HIF-2α activity, as well as HIF-1α loss, correlate with the acquisition of dysplastic characteristics in VHL −/− renal lesions ( Mandriota et al., 2002 ; Raval et al., 2005 ). As VEGF, Oct4, and Cyclin D1 are not relevant to MEF transformation in our studies, these data also suggest a unique role for HIF-2α mediated c-Myc activation in RCC initiation. Our findings are also relevant to other common malignancies. In recent studies of neuroblastoma and colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer, which express both α-subunits, the expression of HIF-2α was more conclusively associated with a poor prognosis than HIF-1α ( Giatromanolaki et al., 2001 ; Holmquist-Mengelbier et al., 2006 ; Yoshimura et al., 2004 ). Given the data connecting c-Myc (or its family member n-Myc) to each tumor type, it is likely that HIF-2α mediated enhancement of c-Myc activity has a role in these, and other, human cancers.
