We demonstrate a role for the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 in the regulation 
of autophagy. In particular, transient increased expression of Sirt1 is 
sufficient to stimulate basal rates of autophagy. In addition, we show that 
Sirt1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts do not fully activate autophagy under 
starved conditions. Reconstitution with wild-type but not a deacetylase-inactive 
mutant of Sirt1 restores autophagy in these cells. We further demonstrate that 
Sirt1 can form a molecular complex with several essential components of the 
autophagy machinery, including autophagy genes (Atg)5, Atg7, and Atg8. In vitro, 
Sirt1 can, in an NAD-dependent fashion, directly deacetylate these components. 
The absence of Sirt1 leads to markedly elevated acetylation of proteins known to 
be required for autophagy in both cultured cells and in embryonic and neonatal 
tissues. Finally, we show that Sirt1(-/-) mice partially resemble Atg5(-/-) 
mice, including the accumulation of damaged organelles, disruption of energy 
homeostasis, and early perinatal mortality. Furthermore, the in utero delivery 
of the metabolic substrate pyruvate extends the survival of Sirt1(-/-) pups. 
These results suggest that the Sirt1 deacetylase is an important in vivo 
regulator of autophagy and provide a link between sirtuin function and the 
overall cellular response to limited nutrients.
