We have isolated a human cDNA clone encoding the mammalian homolog of 
stanniocalcin (STC), a calcium- and phosphate-regulating hormone that was first 
described in fishes where it functions in preventing hypercalcemia. STC has a 
unique amino acid sequence and, until now, has remained one of the few 
polypeptide hormones never described in higher vertebrates. Human STC (hSTC) was 
found to be 247 amino acids long and to share 73% amino acid sequence similarity 
with fish STC. Polyclonal antibodies to recombinant hSTC localized to a distinct 
cell type in the nephron tubule, suggesting kidney as a possible site of 
synthesis. Recombinant hSTC inhibited the gill transport of calcium when 
administered to fish and stimulated renal phosphate reabsorption in the rat. The 
evidence suggests that mammalian STC, like its piscine counterpart, is a 
regulator of mineral homeostasis.
