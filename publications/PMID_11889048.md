The major pathways of mRNA turnover in eukaryotic cells are initiated by 
shortening of the poly(A) tail. Recent work has identified Ccr4p and Pop2p as 
components of the major cytoplasmic deadenylase in yeast. We now demonstrate 
that CCR4 encodes the catalytic subunit of the deadenylase and that Pop2p is 
dispensable for catalysis. In addition, we demonstrate that at least some of the 
Ccr4p/Pop2p-associated Not proteins are cytoplasmic, and lesions in some of the 
NOT genes can lead to defects in mRNA deadenylation rates. The Ccr4p deadenylase 
is inhibited in vitro by addition of the poly(A) binding protein (Pab1p), 
suggesting that dissociation of Pab1p from the poly(A) tail may be rate limiting 
for deadenylation in vivo. In addition, the rapid deadenylation of the COX17 
mRNA, which is controlled by a member of the Pumilio family of deadenylation 
activators Puf3p, requires an active Ccr4p/Pop2p/Not deadenylase. These results 
define the Ccr4p/Pop2p/Not complex as the cytoplasmic deadenylase in yeast and 
identify positive and negative regulators of this enzyme complex.
