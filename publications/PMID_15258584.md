Light-activated cryptochrome (CRY) regulates circadian photoresponses in 
Drosophila melanogaster. Removing the carboxy (C) terminus to create CRYDelta 
produces, in yeast, a light-independent, constitutively active form. Here we 
show that flies overexpressing CRYDelta have a longer free-running period of 
locomotor activity, as well as altered cycling kinetics of the clock proteins 
timeless (TIM) and period (PER). Moreover, at the cellular level, they show a 
reduction in the level of TIM and in the nuclear localization of TIM and PER in 
two significant clusters of behavioral pacemaker cells: the large and the small 
ventral lateral neurons (LN(v)s). These effects are similar to those seen in 
wild-type flies under continuous light and suggest a regulatory role for the C 
terminus of CRY on the photosensitive, photolyase-like part of the protein.
