Androgen antagonists or androgen deprivation is a primary therapeutic modality 
for the treatment of prostate cancer. Invariably, however, the disease becomes 
progressive and unresponsive to androgen ablation therapy (hormone refractory). 
The molecular mechanisms by which the androgen antagonists inhibit prostate 
cancer proliferation are not fully defined. In this report, we demonstrate that 
sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide-dependent histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) linked to the regulation of longevity, is required for 
androgen antagonist-mediated transcriptional repression and growth suppression. 
Androgen antagonist-bound androgen receptor (AR) recruits SIRT1 and nuclear 
receptor corepressor to AR-responsive promoters and deacetylates histone H3 
locally at the prostate-specific antigen promoter. Furthermore, SIRT1 
down-regulation by small interfering RNA or by pharmacological means increased 
the sensitivity of androgen-responsive genes to androgen stimulation, enhanced 
the sensitivity of prostate cancer cell proliferative responses to androgens, 
and decreased the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to androgen antagonists. 
In this study, we demonstrate the ligand-dependent recruitment of a class III 
HDAC into a corepressor transcriptional complex and a necessary functional role 
for a class III HDAC as a transcriptional corepressor in AR antagonist-induced 
transcriptional repression. Collectively, these findings identify SIRT1 as a 
corepressor of AR and elucidate a new molecular pathway relevant to prostate 
cancer growth and approaches to therapy.
