Despite detailed knowledge of the components of the spindle assembly checkpoint, 
a molecular explanation of how cells die after prolonged spindle checkpoint 
activation, and thus how microtubule inhibitors and other antimitotic drugs 
ultimately elicit their lethal effects, has yet to emerge. Mitotically arrested 
cells typically display extensive phosphorylation of two key antiapoptotic 
proteins, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2, and evidence suggests that phosphorylation 
disables their antiapoptotic activity. However, the responsible kinase has 
remained elusive. In this report, evidence is presented that cyclin-dependent 
kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B catalyzes mitotic-arrest-induced Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-2 
phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that CDK1 transiently and incompletely 
phosphorylates these proteins during normal mitosis. When mitosis is prolonged 
in the absence of microtubule inhibition, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2 become highly 
phosphorylated. Transient overexpression of nondegradable cyclin B1 caused 
apoptotic death, which was blocked by a phosphodefective Bcl-x(L) mutant but not 
by a phosphomimetic Bcl-x(L) mutant, confirming Bcl-x(L) as a key target of 
proapoptotic CDK1 signaling. These findings suggest a model whereby a switch in 
the duration of CDK1 activation, from transient during mitosis to sustained 
during mitotic arrest, dramatically increases the extent of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-2 
phosphorylation, resulting in inactivation of their antiapoptotic function. 
Thus, phosphorylation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins acts as a sensor for CDK1 
signal duration and as a functional link coupling mitotic arrest to apoptosis.
