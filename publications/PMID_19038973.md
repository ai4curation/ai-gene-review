Signaling via the conserved WNT/beta-CATENIN pathway controls diverse 
developmental processes. To explore its potential role in the ovary, we 
investigated the expression of WNTs, frizzled (FZD) receptors and other pathway 
components in human cumulus cells obtained from oocytes collected for in vitro 
fertilization. Proteins were detected in cultured cells using immunofluorescence 
microscopy. Protein-protein interactions were analyzed by means of 
immunoprecipitation. WNT2, FZD2, FZD3 and FZD9 were identified but WNT1, WNT4 
and FZD4 were not detected. WNT2 is co-expressed with FZD2, FZD3 and FZD9. 
Co-immunoprecipitation using WNT2 antibody demonstrated that WNT2 interacts with 
both FZD3 and FZD9, but only FZD9 antibody precipitated WNT2. We also identified 
DVL (disheveled), AXIN, GSK-3beta (glycogen synthase kinase-3beta) and 
beta-CATENIN. beta-CATENIN is concentrated in the plasma membranes. DVL 
co-localizes with FZD9 and AXIN in the membranes, but GSK-3beta has little 
co-localization with AXIN and beta-CATENIN. Interestingly, beta-CATENIN is 
highly co-localized with FZD9 and AXIN. CDH1 (E-cadherin) was also detected in 
the plasma membranes and cytoplasm, co-localized with beta-CATENIN, and CDH1 
antibody precipitated beta-CATENIN. The results suggest that WNT2 could act 
through its receptor FZD9 to regulate the beta-CATENIN pathway in cumulus cells, 
recruiting beta-CATENIN into plasma membranes and promoting the formation of 
adherens junctions involving CDH1.
