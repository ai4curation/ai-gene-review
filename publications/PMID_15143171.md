The replication of eukaryotic genomes follows a temporally staged program, in 
which late origin firing often occurs within domains of altered chromatin 
structure(s) and silenced genes. Histone deacetylation functions in gene 
silencing in some late-replicating regions, prompting an investigation of the 
role of histone deacetylation in replication timing control in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Deletion of the histone deacetylase Rpd3 or its interacting partner 
Sin3 caused early activation of late origins at internal chromosomal loci but 
did not alter the initiation timing of early origins or a late-firing, 
telomere-proximal origin. By delaying initiation relative to the earliest 
origins, Rpd3 enables regulation of late origins by the intra-S replication 
checkpoint. RPD3 deletion suppresses the slow S phase of clb5Delta cells by 
enabling late origins to fire earlier, suggesting that Rpd3 modulates the 
initiation timing of many origins throughout the genome. Examination of factors 
such as Ume6 that function together with Rpd3 in transcriptional repression 
indicates that Rpd3 regulates origin initiation timing independently of its role 
in transcriptional repression. This supports growing evidence that for much of 
the S. cerevisiae genome transcription and replication timing are not linked.
