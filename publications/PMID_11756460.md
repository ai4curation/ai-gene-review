Epsin and AP180/CALM are important endocytic accessory proteins that are 
believed to be involved in the formation of clathrin coats. Both proteins 
associate with phosphorylated membrane inositol lipids through their epsin 
N-terminal homology domains and with other components of the endocytic machinery 
through short peptide motifs in their carboxyl-terminal segments. Using 
hydrodynamic and spectroscopic methods, we demonstrate that the parts of epsin 1 
and AP180 that are involved in protein-protein interactions behave as poorly 
structured flexible polypeptide chains with little or no conventional secondary 
structure. The predominant cytosolic forms of both proteins are monomers. 
Furthermore, we show that recombinant epsin 1, like AP180, drives in vitro 
assembly of clathrin cages. We conclude that the epsin N-terminal homology 
domain-containing proteins AP180/CALM and epsin 1 have a very similar molecular 
architecture that is designed for the rapid and efficient recruitment of the 
principal coat components clathrin and AP-2 at the sites of coated pit assembly.
