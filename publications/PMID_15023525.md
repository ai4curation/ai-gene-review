Ksp- and LI-cadherin are structurally homologous proteins coexpressed with 
E-cadherin in renal and intestinal epithelia, respectively. Whereas LI-cadherin 
has been shown to mediate Ca2+-dependent homotypic cell-cell adhesion 
independent of stable interactions with the cytoskeleton, little is known about 
the physiological role of Ksp-cadherin. To analyze its potential adhesive and 
morphoregulatory functions, we expressed murine Ksp-cadherin in CHO cells. In 
this report, we show that Ksp-cadherin induces homotypic and Ca2+-dependent 
cell-cell adhesion that can be specifically blocked with antibodies raised 
against the cadherin repeats EC1 and EC2. Ksp-cadherin mediates about the same 
quantitative adhesive effect (aggregation index) as LI- and E-cadherin. However, 
the cellular phenotype induced by Ksp-cadherin resembles more closely that of 
LI- than E-cadherin. This could reflect our observation, that Ksp-cadherin, as 
well as LI-cadherin, does not directly interact with beta-catenin. In 
conclusion, both cadherins are thus not only structurally but also functionally 
related and may share other functions within their respective epithelia.
