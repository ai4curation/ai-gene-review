A neuron forms thousands of presynaptic nerve terminals on its axons, far 
removed from the cell body. The protein CSPα resides in presynaptic terminals, 
where it forms a chaperone complex with Hsc70 and SGT. Deletion of CSPα results 
in massive neurodegeneration that impairs survival in mice and flies. In 
CSPα-knockout mice, levels of presynaptic SNARE complexes and the SNARE protein 
SNAP-25 are reduced, suggesting that CSPα may chaperone SNARE proteins, which 
catalyse synaptic vesicle fusion. Here, we show that the CSPα-Hsc70-SGT complex 
binds directly to monomeric SNAP-25 to prevent its aggregation, enabling 
SNARE-complex formation. Deletion of CSPα produces an abnormal SNAP-25 conformer 
that inhibits SNARE-complex formation, and is subject to ubiquitylation and 
proteasomal degradation. Even in wild-type mouse terminals, SNAP-25 degradation 
is regulated by synaptic activity; this degradation is decreased by CSPα 
overexpression, and enhanced by CSPα deletion. Thus, SNAP-25 function is 
maintained during rapid SNARE cycles by equilibrium between CSPα-dependent 
chaperoning and ubiquitin-dependent degradation, revealing unique protein 
quality-control machinery within the presynaptic compartment.
