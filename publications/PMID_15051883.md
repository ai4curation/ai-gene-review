A structural profile-based computational screen was used to identify 
neuropoietin (NP), a new cytokine. The np gene is localized in tandem with the 
cardiotrophin-1 gene on mouse chromosome 7. NP shares structural and functional 
features with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1, and 
cardiotrophin-like cytokine. It acts through a membrane receptor complex 
comprising CNTF receptor-alpha component (CNTFRalpha), gp130, and leukemia 
inhibitory factor receptor to activate signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 signaling pathway. NP is highly expressed in embryonic 
neuroepithelia. Strikingly, CNTFRalpha, but not its alternate ligands, CNTF and 
cardiotrophin-like cytokine, is expressed at the same developmental stages. NP 
is also observed in retina and to a lesser extent in skeletal muscle. Moreover, 
NP could sustain the in vitro survival of embryonic motor neurons and could 
increase the proliferation of neural precursors when associated to epidermal 
growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2. Thus, NP is a new ligand for 
CNTFRalpha, with important implications for murine nervous system development.
