Ameloblasts express transmembrane proteins for transport of mineral ions and 
regulation of pH in the enamel space. Two major transporters recently identified 
in ameloblasts are the Na(+)K(+)-dependent calcium transporter NCKX4 and the 
Na(+)-dependent HPO4 (2-) (Pi) cotransporter NaPi-2b. To regulate pH, 
ameloblasts express anion exchanger 2 (Ae2a,b), chloride channel Cftr, and 
amelogenins that can bind protons. Exposure to fluoride or null mutation of 
Cftr, Ae2a,b, or Amelx each results in formation of hypomineralized enamel. We 
hypothesized that enamel hypomineralization associated with disturbed pH 
regulation results from reduced ion transport by NCKX4 and NaPi-2b. This was 
tested by correlation analyses among the levels of Ca, Pi, Cl, Na, and K in 
forming enamel of mice with null mutation of Cftr, Ae2a,b, and Amelx, according 
to quantitative x-ray electron probe microanalysis. Immunohistochemistry, 
polymerase chain reaction analysis, and Western blotting confirmed the presence 
of apical NaPi-2b and Nckx4 in maturation-stage ameloblasts. In wild-type mice, 
K levels in enamel were negatively correlated with Ca and Cl but less negatively 
or even positively in fluorotic enamel. Na did not correlate with P or Ca in 
enamel of wild-type mice but showed strong positive correlation in fluorotic and 
nonfluorotic Ae2a,b- and Cftr-null enamel. In hypomineralizing enamel of all 
models tested, 1) Cl(-) was strongly reduced; 2) K(+) and Na(+) accumulated 
(Na(+) not in Amelx-null enamel); and 3) modulation was delayed or blocked. 
These results suggest that a Na(+)K(+)-dependent calcium transporter (likely 
NCKX4) and a Na(+)-dependent Pi transporter (potentially NaPi-2b) located in 
ruffle-ended ameloblasts operate in a coordinated way with the pH-regulating 
machinery to transport Ca(2+), Pi, and bicarbonate into maturation-stage enamel. 
Acidification and/or associated physicochemical/electrochemical changes in ion 
levels in enamel fluid near the apical ameloblast membrane may reduce the 
transport activity of mineral transporters, which results in hypomineralization.
