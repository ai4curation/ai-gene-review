Abstract

To investigate the importance of different processes to heat stress tolerance, 45 Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) mutants and one transgenic line were tested for basal and acquired thermotolerance at different stages of growth. Plants tested were defective in signaling pathways (abscisic acid, salicylic acid, ethylene, and oxidative burst signaling) and in reactive oxygen metabolism (ascorbic acid or glutathione production, catalase) or had previously been found to have temperature-related phenotypes (e.g. fatty acid desaturase mutants, uvh6 ). Mutants were assessed for thermotolerance defects in seed germination, hypocotyl elongation, root growth, and seedling survival. To assess oxidative damage and alterations in the heat shock response, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, heat shock protein 101, and small heat shock protein levels were determined. Fifteen mutants showed significant phenotypes. Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling mutants ( abi1 and abi2 ) and the UV-sensitive mutant, uvh6 , showed the strongest defects in acquired thermotolerance of root growth and seedling survival. Mutations in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase homolog genes ( atrbohB and D ), ABA biosynthesis mutants ( aba1 , aba2 , and aba3 ), and NahG transgenic lines (salicylic acid deficient) showed weaker defects. Ethylene signaling mutants ( ein2 and etr1 ) and reactive oxygen metabolism mutants ( vtc1 , vtc2 , npq1 , and cad2 ) were more defective in basal than acquired thermotolerance, especially under high light. All mutants accumulated wild-type levels of heat shock protein 101 and small heat shock proteins. These data indicate that, separate from heat shock protein induction, ABA, active oxygen species, and salicylic acid pathways are involved in acquired thermotolerance and that UVH6 plays a significant role in temperature responses in addition to its role in UV stress.

DISCUSSION

We have evaluated the importance of different processes and pathways to heat stress tolerance by testing 45 Arabidopsis mutants and one transgenic line for sensitivity to heat (basal thermotolerance) and ability to acquire thermotolerance at different stages of growth. Mutants were chosen on the basis of previous data implicating the mutant gene in responses to high temperature ( Table I ) and included mutants in signaling pathways, mutants with defects in the production of antioxidants, and other mutants with defects in genes previously associated with heat stress or heat-induced pathways ( Larkindale et al., 2005 ). Of the 46 plants tested, the most significant phenotypes in both basal and acquired thermotolerance were seen in several ABA biosynthesis or signaling mutants, in plants unable to accumulate SA, in two mutants of respiratory burst oxidase homologs, and in the uvh6 mutant, which is defective in a DNA helicase. All of these mutants accumulated HSP101 and class I and II sHsps normally, suggesting that the processes affected by the mutant genes are independent of the heat shock response. This indicates that there are multiple processes involved in the acquisition of thermotolerance, of which HSP synthesis is only one critical aspect.

Although some of these mutant plants are small (e.g. vtc1 ) or show other unrelated phenotypes ( uvh6 is yellow-green), we argue that the heat phenotypes seen in this study are not due to inherent weaknesses in the mutants. We base this assumption on the fact that some of the mutants tested that showed no phenotype in any assay were also small (e.g. axr1 ) and that the mutants that did show a phenotype showed it only under specific conditions, i.e. at specific stages of development, more so during basal than acquired thermotolerance, or only after specific heat treatments. Therefore, we conclude that the selected mutants show genuine heat-defective phenotypes.

Results of this study demonstrate that there are many protective pathways that contribute to survival of plants at high temperatures and suggest that the relative importance of the different pathways changes throughout plant development. This conclusion is supported by the observation that mutants showed differential heat sensitivity depending on the stage of growth at which they were assayed. Strikingly, of the mutants tested, only uvh6 and uvh3 (and hot1 as described previously) showed heat sensitivity during seed germination or when tested as 2.5-d dark-grown seedlings. The other mutants were sensitive only after 4 or more d of growth in the light, growth stages at which uvh6 and hot1 (but not uvh3 ) were also sensitive. Our results also agree with those of Clarke et al. (2004) , in which they demonstrated that NahG and npr1 were defective in basal thermotolerance in 10-d-old plants, but neither exhibited a defect in acquired thermotolerance of 2.5-d seedlings. In contrast to these results, four of seven different hot mutants, which were isolated as mutants defective in acquired thermotolerance as 2.5-d seedlings, acquire thermotolerance normally as older plants ( Hong et al., 2003 ; S.-W. Hong, U. Lee, and E. Vierling, unpublished data). The absence of a 2.5-d phenotype in most of the mutants tested here explains why these mutations were not isolated in this hot mutant screen ( Hong and Vierling, 2000 ) and that none of the unpublished hot mutants have been mapped to loci close to these genes ( Hong et al., 2003 ; S.-W. Hong, U. Lee, and E. Vierling, unpublished data). In total, the data support the idea that plants suffer different types of damage at different growth stages (e.g. prevention/repair of oxidative damage appears more critical in light-grown plants compared to young dark-grown plants), which then require a different balance of protective mechanisms, and/or that different protective mechanisms vary in their redundancy during growth.

ABA signaling appears to be more critical for acquired thermotolerance than for basal thermotolerance (while playing a part in both), while the converse is true for ethylene signaling and antioxidant protection. The ABA mutants aba1 , aba2 , aba3 , abi1 , and abi2 were unique in showing significantly stronger phenotypes in the acquired thermotolerance assays than in the basal thermotolerance assays. In contrast, the ethylene and antioxidant pathway mutants all showed significantly stronger basal than acquired thermotolerance phenotypes, especially under high light conditions, suggesting that control of oxidative damage is more critical in nonacclimated plants. Together, these data support the hypothesis that heat tolerance involves multiple processes, some of which are primarily of importance during basal thermotolerance (ethylene and antioxidant pathways), some of which are more critical during the acquisition of thermotolerance (ABA pathways), and a number of which are required for survival of any heat treatment (involving an oxidative burst, SA, UVH6, and HSPs). These components may function in multiple pathways acting together to allow plant survival at high temperatures, and the exact balance of components needed for survival depends both on the plant growth stage and on the duration and severity of the heat stress.

The abi3 mutant was unique among the ABA signaling mutants in that it did not appear to be involved in the acquisition of thermotolerance at any growth stage. This transcription factor has previously been associated with developmental control of HSP accumulation in seeds ( Rojas et al., 1999 ; Wehmeyer and Vierling, 2000 ). The lack of a phenotype in the abi3 plants further supports the model that ABI3 is involved in seed-specific expression but not in heat-dependent expression of HSPs.

Given that both ABA biosynthesis mutants ( aba mutants) and ABA-insensitive mutants ( abi1 and 2 ) were found to be sensitive to heat stress, it can be hypothesized that ABA is likely to accumulate during heat stress, triggering downstream responses. In Arabidopsis, pretreatment of plants with exogenous ABA has been shown to improve basal thermotolerance ( Larkindale and Knight, 2002 ), and Ristic and Cass (1992) have shown that a high ABA-accumulating line of maize has increased tolerance to chronic heat and drought. Therefore, it was somewhat surprising that ade1 , a mutant known to overaccumulate ABA, had the same heat resistance as the wild type and furthermore did not survive any better than heat-stressed wild-type plants (data not shown).

ABA appears to play a part in some pathway distinct to the induction of HSPs that is nonetheless essential to the acquisition of thermotolerance in light-grown plants. At present, little is known about what a heat-stress ABA pathway might involve, although it is reasonable to hypothesize that similar genes might be induced by ABA during heat stress as during drought stress. Large numbers of stress- and ABA-regulated genes have been implicated in drought tolerance ( Zhu, 2002 ), and specific transcripts have been shown to be induced by both heat and drought stress ( Rizhsky et al., 2004 ). In our study, plants were heated on sealed agar plates, so the plants did not suffer from dehydration in conjunction with heat stress. In confirmation of this assumption, we have found that the genes identified as drought- but not heat-inducible by Rizhsky et al. (2004) are not up-regulated during our heating regimes (data not shown). The combination of heat and drought stress, however, is common in nature, so coordination of heat and drought responsive pathways may be beneficial to the plant.

The NahG transgenic line and atrbohB and atrbohD mutants all showed a significant phenotype both after a direct heat treatment and after acquisition of thermotolerance. It is difficult to determine to what extent these plants are defective in processes specifically involved in acquired thermotolerance, since their defect in basal thermotolerance may also affect plants after acquisition of thermotolerance. Heat pretreatment does not compensate for the effects of the mutations, however, as the plants do not survive as well as wild-type plants after acclimation. These results suggest that signaling pathways involving SA and active oxygen species (AOS) are critical for events during both basal and acquired thermotolerance. The involvement of SA and AOS signals in the acquisition of thermotolerance requires further investigation, as end points for these signaling pathways during heat stress have not been determined. SA and AOS signaling pathways during biotic stresses have been well established ( Sandermann, 2000 ; Van Breusegem et al., 2001 ; Thatcher et al., 2005 ), but no correlation between these pathways and heat stress has been established.

In contrast to the other mutants, the ethylene and the antioxidant pathway mutants showed almost wild-type acquired thermotolerance but a severe defect in basal thermotolerance ( Figs. 1 , 2 , and 6 ). Thus, these mutants are defective in some pathway that is essential to basal thermotolerance but that is made redundant by processes induced during the acquisition of thermotolerance. The affect of heat on the ein2 and etr1 mutants and on the mutants compromised in antioxidant defenses was dramatically enhanced by increasing the light intensity during recovery from heat stress ( Fig. 3 ), and these mutants show no phenotype in assays performed during early seedling growth in the dark. Photooxidative damage has been shown to be a critical aspect of 10-d-old seedling survival during basal thermotolerance treatments ( Larkindale and Knight, 2002 ), so the increased lethality seen in these mutants may be due to increased levels of heat-induced oxidative stress. This hypothesis is supported by the uniformly high TBARS measurements in all plants sensitive to heat stress and the relatively high TBARS levels for the ethylene and antioxidant mutants even under conditions where only a small decrease in survival was observed ( Fig. 2 ). As ethylene has been associated with oxidative stress responses ( Kato et al., 2000 ; Argandona et al., 2001 ; Bortier et al., 2001 ; Moeder et al., 2002 ; Nie et al., 2002 ; Manning et al., 2003 ), ethylene might act as a signal to activate oxidative defenses during heat stress. Taken together, these observations indicate that oxidative damage is a major component in heat damage under basal thermotolerance conditions. In contrast, such damage is less critical during acquired thermotolerance either because there are fewer free radicals produced or because free radicals are dealt with by other systems.

Of the mutants in this study, only uvh6 showed a strong defect in both basal thermotolerance and acquired thermotolerance at all stages of its life cycle from germination through to 25 d, similar to the Hsp101 mutant hot1 . Therefore, this DNA helicase appears to control some function essential to both basal and acquired heat tolerance that is neither age nor light dependent. The ability of uvh6 to accumulate Hsp101 and sHsps indicates that its essential function is distinct from the induction of HSPs or the function of Hsp101. This DNA helicase is believed to have two cellular functions based on the known functions of human and yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) homologs. These homologs act both as a DNA helicase involved in DNA damage repair by the nuclear excision pathway and as a core component of the TFIIH transcription factor complex ( Svejstrup et al., 1996 ). We hypothesize that the latter function is more essential for thermotolerance in plants based on two lines of reasoning. First, the uvh6-1 allele used in this study shows only a moderate defect in DNA repair ( Liu et al., 2003 ), and yet its affect on thermotolerance is severe. Second, recent data have shown that cells carrying certain mutant alleles of the human homolog of Uvh6, XPD, have defective transcriptional responses to specific hormone treatments involving only a subset of transcriptional activators ( Dubaele et al., 2003 ; Drané et al., 2004 ). The current model explaining this observation is that XPD regulates the phosphorylation activity of the TFIIH-associated cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase complex, directing it to phosphorylate and activate specific transcription factors, thus inducing transcription of specific target genes. Hence, we suggest that the uvh6 phenotype arises from failure to induce genes distinct from HSPs that are required for heat stress tolerance.

We also tested 30 mutants that showed no heat sensitivity under any of the conditions used, including mutants that had previously been documented as sensitive to high temperatures, e.g. tsl4 and some of the fad mutants ( Hugly et al., 1991 ; James and Dooner, 1991 ; C. Somerville, unpublished data). The contrast between our results and those previously published is most likely due to differences in the assays used. Heat sensitivity in these mutants had been identified through chronic, moderate heat stresses as opposed to their response to severe heat stress or their ability to acclimate to high temperatures. Different processes again might be expected to be involved in long-term heat acclimation than are involved in either basal or acquired thermotolerance.

Based on our data, we can now diagram a framework for understanding how different signaling pathways contribute to both basal and acquired thermotolerance as shown in Figure 7 . Depending on the stress applied and the age of the plant, it appears that different aspects of heat-induced damage impact plant survival, and different types of heat-induced damage are prevented or repaired through different cellular systems. The signaling molecules AOS, SA, and ABA and the transcription component uvh6 potentially activate or modulate other pathways involved in the plant response to heat that are different from the HSP pathway. Because they affect both basal and acquired thermotolerance, they must have effects distinct from the antioxidant pathway. What kind of damage is being prevented or repaired by such pathways has yet to be determined. The SA transgenic line and the AOS mutants showed similar phenotypes and affected basal and acquired thermotolerance equally; therefore, in Figure 7 , they are depicted as potentially part of the same pathway. ABA is depicted as part of a separate signaling pathway to the other components, although some aspects of ABA signaling may be common to a pathway involving SA and AOS. The effect of uvh6 is different from the effects of the other mutants in that the gene is essential for thermotolerance in plants of all ages. Although UVH6 function may impact other signaling pathways, it is clear that at least some aspect of UVH6 function is unique and essential for survival in plants prior to exposure to light.

In Figure 7 , five separate pathways are therefore illustrated, which, acting together, produce the thermotolerant phenotypes in light-grown plants. Only some of these pathways are critical in 2.5-d dark-grown plants. Heat is a complex stress causing damage to a range of cellular components, so it should not be surprising that a large number of different protective pathways are required in order to survive. Induction of any one of these pathways allows the plant to acquire some measure of thermotolerance, and the loss of any specific pathway merely limits the extent of that tolerance.
