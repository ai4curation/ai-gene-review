Flowering in Arabidopsis is promoted via several interacting pathways. A 
photoperiod-dependent pathway relays signals from photoreceptors to a 
transcription factor gene, CONSTANS (CO), which activates downstream meristem 
identity genes such as LEAFY (LFY). FT, together with LFY, promotes flowering 
and is positively regulated by CO. Loss of FT causes delay in flowering, whereas 
overexpression of FT results in precocious flowering independent of CO or 
photoperiod. FT acts in part downstream of CO and mediates signals for flowering 
in an antagonistic manner with its homologous gene, TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1).
