The ubiquitin-specific protease, USP7, has key roles in the p53 pathway whereby 
it stabilizes both p53 and MDM2. We show that the N-terminal domain of USP7 
binds two closely spaced 4-residue sites in both p53 and MDM2, falling between 
p53 residues 359-367 and MDM2 residues 147-159. Cocrystal structures with USP7 
were determined for both p53 peptides and for one MDM2 peptide. These peptides 
bind the same surface of USP7 as Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1, explaining the 
competitive nature of the interactions. The structures and mutagenesis data 
indicate a preference for a P/AXXS motif in peptides that bind USP7. Contacts 
made by serine are identical and crucial for all peptides, and Trp165 in the 
peptide-binding pocket of USP7 is also crucial. These results help to elucidate 
the mechanism of substrate recognition by USP7 and the regulation of the p53 
pathway.
