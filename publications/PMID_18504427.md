Twist is basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds to E-boxes in 
gene promoters. Twist possesses an oncogenic function by interfering with the 
tumor suppressor function of p53. Using a membrane pull-down assay, we found 
that Twist directly interacts with p53 and that this interaction underlies the 
inhibitory effects on p53 target gene expression. Twist interacted with the 
DNA-binding domain of p53 and suppressed the DNA-binding activity of p53. 
Transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter by p53 was significantly 
repressed by the expression of Twist. On the other hand, p53 interacted with the 
N-terminal domain of Twist and repressed Twist-dependent YB-1 promoter activity. 
Importantly, we found that p53-dependent growth suppression was canceled by the 
expression of either Twist or YB-1. Thus, our data suggest that Twist inhibits 
p53 function via a direct interaction with p53.
