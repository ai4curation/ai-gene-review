Pancreatic β-cells have a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and express 
large amounts of chaperones and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) to meet the 
high demand for synthesis of proteins. We have observed an unexpected decrease 
in chaperone protein level in the β-cell model INS-1E after exposure to the ER 
stress inducing agent thapsigargin. As these cells are a commonly used model for 
primary β-cells and has been shown to be vulnerable to ER stress, we hypothesize 
these cells are incapable of mounting a chaperone defense upon activation of ER 
stress. To investigate the chaperone expression during an ER stress response, 
induced by thapsigargin in INS-1E cells, we used quantitative mass spectrometry 
based proteomics. The results displayed a decrease of GRP78/BiP, PDIA3 and 
PDIA6. Decrease of GRP78/BiP was verified by Western blot and occurred in 
parallel with enhanced levels of p-eIF2α and CHOP. In contrast to INS-1E cells, 
GRP78/BiP was not decreased in MIN6 cell or rat and mouse islets after 
thapsigargin exposure. Investigation of the decreased protein levels of 
GRP78/BiP indicates that this is not a consequence of reduced mRNA expression. 
Rather the reduction results from the combined effect of reduced protein 
synthesis and enhanced proteosomal degradation and possibly also degradation via 
autophagy. Induction of ER stress with thapsigargin leads to lower protein 
levels of GRP78/BiP, PDIA3 and PDIA6 in INS-1E cells which may contribute to the 
susceptibility of ER stress in this β-cell model.
