Infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) is a 775-residue multifunctional herpes simplex 
virus protein associated with numerous functions related to transactivation of 
gene expression and repression of host defenses to infection. We report that an 
uncharted domain of ICP0 located between residues 245 and 510 contains multiple 
SH3 domain binding motifs similar to those required for binding to CIN85, the 
M(r) 85,000 protein that interacts with Cbl. CIN85 and Cbl are involved in 
endocytosis and negative regulation of numerous receptor tyrosine kinases. We 
report that ICP0 binds CIN85 in a reciprocal manner and that the complexes 
pulled down by ICP0 also contain Cbl. We tested the role of ICP0 in the 
down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by using epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) as a prototypic receptor. In transfection assays, ICP0, in the 
absence of other viral genes, down-regulated EGF-dependent expression of a 
reporter gene (luciferase). ICP0 also down-regulated both total and cell surface 
levels of EGFR in EGF-independent manner. In wild-type virus-infected cells, the 
surface levels of EGFR were also decreased in the absence of EGF stimulation. 
Stimulation by EGF enhanced the decrease in surface EGFR. We conclude that ICP0 
encodes SH3 domain binding sites that function to down-regulate signaling 
pathways associated with receptor tyrosine kinases. The results suggest that 
ICP0 precludes signaling to the infected cells through the receptor tyrosine 
kinases.
