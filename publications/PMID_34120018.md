INTRODUCTION: Placental oxidative stress features in pregnancy pathologies but 
in clinical trials antioxidant supplementation has not improved outcomes. 
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) stimulates glutathione production and is proposed as a 
therapeutic agent in pregnancy. However, key elements of N-acetylcysteine 
biology, including its cellular uptake mechanism, remains unclear. This study 
explores how the cystine/glutamate transporter xCT may mediate N-acetylcysteine 
uptake and how N-acetylcysteine alters placental redox status.
METHODS: The involvement of xCT in NAC uptake by the human placenta was studied 
in perfused placenta and Xenopus oocytes. The effect of short-term 
N-acetylcysteine exposure on the placental villous proteome was determined using 
LC-MS. The effect of N-acetylcysteine on Maxi-chloride channel activity was 
investigated in perfused placenta, villous fragments and cell culture.
RESULTS: Maternoplacental N-acetylcysteine administration stimulated 
intracellular glutamate efflux suggesting a role of the exchange transporter 
xCT, which was localised to the microvillous membrane of the placental 
syncytiotrophoblast. Placental exposure to a bolus of N-acetylcysteine inhibited 
subsequent activation of the redox sensitive Maxi-chloride channel independently 
of glutathione synthesis. Stable isotope quantitative proteomics of placental 
villi treated with N-acetylcysteine demonstrated changes in pathways associated 
with oxidative stress, apoptosis and the acute phase response.
DISCUSSION: This study suggests that xCT mediates N-acetylcysteine uptake into 
the placenta and that N-acetylcysteine treatment of placental tissue alters the 
placental proteome while regulating the redox sensitive Maxi-chloride channel. 
Interestingly N-acetylcysteine had antioxidant effects independent of the 
glutathione pathway. Effective placental antioxidant therapy in pregnancy may 
require maintaining the balance between normalising redox status without 
inhibiting physiological redox signalling.
