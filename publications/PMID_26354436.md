The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) family of proteins have recently 
been identified as important host effector molecules of the type I interferon 
response against viruses. IFITM1 has been identified as a potent antiviral 
effector against hepatitis C virus (HCV), whereas the related family members 
IFITM2 and IFITM3 have been described to have antiviral effects against a broad 
range of RNA viruses. Here, we demonstrate that IFITM2 and IFITM3 play an 
integral role in the interferon response against HCV and act at the level of 
late entry stages of HCV infection. We have established that in hepatocytes, 
IFITM2 and IFITM3 localize to the late and early endosomes, respectively, as 
well as the lysosome. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that S-palmitoylation of 
all three IFITM proteins is essential for anti-HCV activity, whereas the 
conserved tyrosine residue in the N-terminal domain of IFITM2 and IFITM3 plays a 
significant role in protein localization. However, this tyrosine was found to be 
dispensable for anti-HCV activity, with mutation of the tyrosine resulting in an 
IFITM1-like phenotype with the retention of anti-HCV activity and 
co-localization of IFITM2 and IFITM3 with CD81. In conclusion, we propose that 
the IFITM proteins act in a coordinated manner to restrict HCV infection by 
targeting the endocytosed HCV virion for lysosomal degradation and demonstrate 
that the actions of the IFITM proteins are indeed virus and cell-type specific.
