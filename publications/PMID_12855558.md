Bcl2's antiapoptotic function is regulated by phosphorylation. Bcl2 also 
regulates cell cycle progression, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. Bcl2 
is functionally expressed in mitochondria where it can act as an antioxidant 
that may regulate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since ROS have 
been reported to act as second messengers in cell signaling, we tested whether 
Bcl2 phosphorylation regulates ROS and cell cycle progression. G1 --> S 
transition and ROS levels were measured in cells expressing either the gain of 
function phosphomimetic Bcl2 mutants S70E and T69E/S70E/S87E (EEE) or the 
nonphosphorylatable and survival-deficient mutants S70A and T69A/S70A/S87A 
(AAA). Expression of S70E and EEE but not the A-containing Bcl2 mutants retards 
G1 --> S transition by 35% to 50% and significantly slows cell growth in 
association with reduced levels of intracellular ROS. In addition to expression 
of the phosphomimetic Bcl2 mutants, either interleukin-3 withdrawal or treatment 
of cells with the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) also reduces 
intracellular ROS levels in association with up-regulation of p27 and 
accumulation of cells in G0/G1. Retardation of G1 --> S transition can be 
overridden by directly adding H2O2 to the cells in a mechanism that involves 
down-regulation of p27 and activation of Cdk2. Thus, Bcl2 may regulate G1 --> S 
transition by a novel signaling mechanism that couples regulation of 
intracellular ROS with p27 and Cdk2. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Bcl2 may 
functionally link its antiapoptotic, cell cycle retardation, and antioxidant 
properties.
