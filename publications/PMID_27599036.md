Heme is an iron-containing cofactor essential for multiple cellular processes 
and fundamental activities such as oxygen transport. To better understand the 
means by which heme synthesis is regulated during erythropoiesis, affinity 
purification coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) was performed to identify 
putative protein partners interacting with ferrochelatase (FECH), the terminal 
enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Both progesterone receptor membrane 
component 1 (PGRMC1) and progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRMC2) 
were identified in these experiments. These interactions were validated by 
reciprocal affinity purification followed by MS analysis and immunoblotting. The 
interaction between PGRMC1 and FECH was confirmed in vitro and in HEK 293T 
cells, a non-erythroid cell line. When cells that are recognized models for 
erythroid differentiation were treated with a small molecule inhibitor of 
PGRMC1, AG-205, there was an observed decrease in the level of hemoglobinization 
relative to that of untreated cells. In vitro heme transfer experiments showed 
that purified PGRMC1 was able to donate heme to apo-cytochrome b5. In the 
presence of PGRMC1, in vitro measured FECH activity decreased in a 
dose-dependent manner. Interactions between FECH and PGRMC1 were strongest for 
the conformation of FECH associated with product release, suggesting that PGRMC1 
may regulate FECH activity by controlling heme release. Overall, the data 
illustrate a role for PGRMC1 in regulating heme synthesis via interactions with 
FECH and suggest that PGRMC1 may be a heme chaperone or sensor.

Abstract

Heme is an iron containing cofactor essential for multiple cellular processes and fundamental activities such as oxygen transport. To better understand the means by which heme synthesis is regulated during erythropoiesis, affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) was carried out to identify putative protein partners interacting with ferrochelatase (FECH), the terminal enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Both Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (PGRMC1) and Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 2 (PGRMC2) were identified in these experiments. These interactions were validated by reciprocal affinity purification followed by MS analysis and immunoblotting. The interaction between PGRMC1 and FECH was confirmed in vitro and in HEK293T cells, a non-erythroid cell line. When cells that are recognized models for erythroid differentiation were treated with a small molecule inhibitor of PGRMC1, AG-205, there was an observed decrease in hemoglobinization relative to untreated cells. In vitro heme transfer experiments showed that purified PGRMC1 was able to donate heme to apo-cytochrome b 5 . In the presence of PGRMC1 in vitro measured FECH activity decreased in a dose dependent manner. Interactions between FECH and PGRMC1 were strongest for the conformation of FECH associated with product release suggesting that PGRMC1 may regulate FECH activity by controlling heme release. Overall, the data illustrate a role for PGRMC1 in regulating heme synthesis via interactions with FECH and suggest that PGRMC1 may be a heme chaperone or sensor.

Discussion

PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 are small hemoproteins whose cellular functions are not well defined. Both proteins are members of the membrane associated progesterone receptor family and are highly homologous 25 . Of the two proteins, PGRMC1 has been studied in greater detail and reported to be involved in a variety of cellular pathways, including cell proliferation, cholesterol synthesis and autophagy. Several published observations have likely contributed to the unclear function of PGRMC1 in cells, including its upregulation in some cancers, characterization of truncated, tagged and heterogeneous protein, and the lack of functional assays for many of its reported roles. Despite the smaller number of studies carried out on PGRMC2, it is also thought to play a role in cancer 102 . It is not known if PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 have overlapping functions in the cell; however we and others 103 have shown that PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 interact and form heterodimers or multimers.

One property of both PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 which has not been questioned is their ability to bind heme. Heme binding has been characterized through spectroscopic 23 , 24 , 104 and crystallographic studies 42 for mammalian PGRMC1. Multiple studies also characterized the yeast homolog, DAP1 23 , 30 , 38 and have shown that several of the proposed functions of PGRMC1 and DAP1 are heme dependent 24 , 30 , 31 , 38 , 104 . Spectroscopic studies have been carried out to characterize the heme binding pocket of human PGRMC1 and are consistent with heme binding via a conserved tyrosine residue in a high spin, five coordinate environment 24 . This type of environment is similar to several bacterial heme transport proteins including ShuT and HasA 43 , 105 . Recent crystallographic data showed that the dimerization of a truncated form of PGRMC1, which lacks the transmembrane domain, occurs via their heme molecules which interact with each monomer on its surface 42 . This unique and weak binding of heme by PGRMC1 has reinvigorated the proposal that PGRMC1 may function as a heme chaperone in cells 23 , 31 . Our data that demonstrate a clear interaction between PGRMC1, PGRMC2, FECH and the mitochondrial heme metabolon add additional evidence to this proposed function.

Consistent with the proposal that PGRMC1, and possibly PGRMC2, function as heme chaperones are the findings that PGRMC1 can be observed in multiple cellular locations; something that would be expected for a heme chaperone that obtains heme from the mitochondrion and transports it to a variety of cellular locations for assembly into holo-hemoproteins. Previous studies have localized PGRMC1 to a variety of cellular compartments including the ER, nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, and the mitochondria 106 . Several of these locations correspond to the proposed functions of PGRMC1. For example, PGRMC1 has been shown to stimulate several cytochrome P 450 s which are found in the ER membrane 28 , 29 . Another role reported for PGRMC1 is vesicle transport of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In these studies, PGRMC1 was cofractionated with EGFR to cytoplasmic vesicles 34 . In our studies, we have shown that PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 cofractionate and colocalize with the mitochondrial heme biosynthesis metabolon 11 . This pattern was observed in both undifferentiated and differentiated MEL cells. Further experiments to characterize the sub-mitochondrial localization were consistent with the majority of PGRMC1 being on the outside of the outer mitochondrial membrane. This localization would make it difficult if not impossible for the heme binding domain of PGRMC1 to interact with FECH to obtain heme and suggests interactions with a transmembrane protein for heme transport, such as ABCB10. Thus FECH and PGRMC1 interaction would take place at or near the N-terminus of PGRMC1 and upon heme binding PGRMC1 would either undergo proteolytic processing or significant conformational rearrangement for heme transport from the mitochondria ( Figure 10A ). More detailed studies examining different regions of PGRMC1 are necessary to validate this model of interaction with FECH.

In addition to the possible role of PGRMC1 as a heme chaperone, several equally feasible roles for PGRMC1 in heme production exist that are based on previous data as well as those presented herein. First, as mentioned above, PGRMC1 has been implicated in vesicle transport 34 , 107 . Our affinity purification data of PGRMC1 showed that transferrin receptor 1 was recovered from both the PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 experiments similar to what was found with other mitochondrial heme metabolon components. Previous work has proposed a novel delivery system for iron to the mitochondria during erythropoiesis via a kiss and run mechanism 108 – 110 . Considering the reported vesicle transport function of PGRMC1, it is possible that PGRMC1 could play a role in iron transport to the mitochondria ( Figure 10C ). If it is shown that PGRMC1 with heme bound is involved in iron transport, heme may serve as an intracellular second messenger to regulate iron homeostasis, which supports the work of Li et al. 36 .

Second is the possible function of PGRMC1 as a heme sensor that regulates heme production via either i) stabilizing or destabilizing the mitochondrial heme metabolon ( Figure 10D ) or ii) directly regulating the activity of FECH ( Figure 10B ). Our findings clearly support a role for PGRMC1 in regulating heme biosynthesis and/or transport. Inclusion of PGRMC1 in FECH assays resulted in a dose dependent decrease in enzyme activity that saturates at about 60% of maximal FECH activity. We also demonstrated that this interaction is dependent on the conformation of FECH and is strongest when FECH is in the product bound/release conformation. This conformation specific interaction of FECH with a partner was previously hypothesized due to the distinct surfaces of FECH presented during its catalytic cycle 20 . Additionally in an erythroid cell culture model, we were also able to demonstrate that targeting of PGRMC1 with a small molecule inhibitor decreases hemoglobinization in differentiated MEL cells. These data are consistent with PGRMC1 regulating heme synthesis via its interactions with FECH.

The models proposed herein for PGRMC1 function in heme synthesis are not exclusive and likely overlap in some fashion. For example, our findings demonstrating the ability of PGRMC1 to transfer heme to an apo-hemoprotein and to interact with the “release conformation” of FECH support a model in which PGRMC1 serves as both a heme chaperone and regulator of FECH. Overall our data are consistent with PGRMC1 being an essential component of the mitochondrial heme metabolon and playing a role in regulating heme synthesis in erythroid differentiation. While the precise roles of PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 need additional clarification, planned studies, including the production of transgenic animals and knock-out cell lines, will define the roles of these proteins in heme biosynthesis.
