Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) are post-translational modifications 
(PTMs) that regulate nuclear cellular processes. Here we used an augmented 
K0-SUMO proteomics strategy to identify 40,765 SUMO acceptor sites and quantify 
their fractional contribution for 6,747 human proteins. Structural-predictive 
analyses revealed that lysines residing in disordered regions are preferentially 
targeted by SUMO, in notable contrast to other widespread lysine modifications. 
In our data set, we identified 807 SUMOylated peptides that were co-modified by 
phosphorylation, along with dozens of SUMOylated peptides that were co-modified 
by ubiquitylation, acetylation and methylation. Notably, 9% of the identified 
SUMOylome occurred proximal to phosphorylation, and numerous SUMOylation sites 
were found to be fully dependent on prior phosphorylation events. SUMO-proximal 
phosphorylation occurred primarily in a proline-directed manner, and inhibition 
of cyclin-dependent kinases dynamically affected co-modification. Collectively, 
we present a comprehensive analysis of the SUMOylated proteome, uncovering the 
structural preferences for SUMO and providing system-wide evidence for a 
remarkable degree of cross-talk between SUMOylation and other major PTMs.
