Protein kinase D2 (PKD2), a member of the PKD family of serine/threonine 
kinases, is localized in various subcellular compartments including the nucleus 
where the kinase accumulates upon activation of G-protein-coupled receptors. We 
define three critical post-translational modifications required for nuclear 
accumulation of PKD2 in response to activation of the CCK2 receptor (CCK2R): 
phosphorylation at Ser706 and Ser710 within the activation loop by PKC eta 
leading to catalytic activity and phosphorylation at Ser244 within the 
zinc-finger domain, which is crucial for blocking nuclear export of active PKD2 
by preventing its interaction with the Crm-1 export machinery. We identify 
CK1delta and epsilon as upstream activated kinases by CCK2R that phosphorylate 
PKD2 at Ser244. Moreover, nuclear accumulation of active PKD2 is a prerequisite 
for efficient phosphorylation of its nuclear substrate, HDAC7. Only nuclear, 
active PKD2 mediates CCK2R-induced HDAC7 phosphorylation and Nur77 expression. 
Thus, we define a novel, compartment-specific signal transduction pathway 
downstream of CCK2R that phosphorylates PKD2 at three specific sites, results in 
nuclear accumulation of the active kinase and culminates in efficient 
phosphorylation of nuclear PKD2 substrates in human gastric cancer cells.
