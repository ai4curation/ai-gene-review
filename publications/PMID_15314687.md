In vitro studies suggest that collecting duct-derived (CD-derived) endothelin-1 
(ET-1) can regulate renal Na reabsorption; however, the physiologic role of 
CD-derived ET-1 is unknown. Consequently, the physiologic effect of selective 
disruption of the ET-1 gene in the CD of mice was determined. Mice heterozygous 
for aquaporin2 promoter Cre recombinase and homozygous for loxP-flanked exon 2 
of the ET-1 gene (called CD-specific KO of ET-1 [CD ET-1 KO] mice) were 
generated. These animals had no CD ET-1 mRNA and had reduced urinary ET-1 
excretion. CD ET-1 KO mice on a normal Na diet were hypertensive, while body 
weight, Na excretion, urinary aldosterone excretion, and plasma renin activity 
were unchanged. CD ET-1 KO mice on a high-Na diet had worsened hypertension, 
reduced urinary Na excretion, and excessive weight gain, but showed no 
differences between aldosterone excretion and plasma renin activity. Amiloride 
or furosemide reduced BP in CD ET-1 KO mice on a normal or high-Na diet and 
prevented excessive Na retention in salt-loaded CD ET-1 KO mice. These studies 
indicate that CD-derived ET-1 is an important physiologic regulator of renal Na 
excretion and systemic BP.
