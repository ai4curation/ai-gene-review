Most organisms on the planet have viruses that infect them. Viral infection may 
lead to cell death, or to a symbiotic relationship where the genomes of both 
virus and host replicate together. In the symbiotic state, both virus and cell 
potentially experience increased fitness as a result of the other. The viruses 
that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages (or phages), well exemplify the 
symbiotic relationships that can develop between viruses and their host. In this 
review, we will discuss the many ways that prophages, which are phage genomes 
integrated into the genomes of their hosts, influence bacterial behavior and 
virulence.
