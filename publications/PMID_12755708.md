We isolated the cDNA of a gene, designated smooth muscle-associated protein 8 
(smap8), during a search for new genes expressed in human aortic smooth muscle 
cells. The full-length smap8 cDNA is 3241 bp long and contains an open reading 
frame of 1113 bp encoding an approximately 45 kDa soluble protein identical to 
NDRG4 protein. Smap8 mRNA was expressed predominantly in the brain and heart, 
and moderately in vascular smooth muscle cells. Expression of smap8 mRNA was 
induced within 3-12 h by treatment with 10 mm homocysteine in rat aortic smooth 
muscle cells (A10 cells). Expression of exogenous smap8 markedly reduced both 
the proliferation and migration rates of rat A10 cells, however, PDGF-induced 
proliferation was significantly enhanced in smap8-expressed cells compared with 
mock-transfected cells. To ascertain the involvement of smap8 in mitogenesis, we 
tested the effects of stimulation of smap8, MEK1/2 or ERK1/2, which is known as 
a proliferation relating intermediate, by various growth factors and cytokines. 
PDGF was the most prominent in promoting phosphorylation of the smap8 protein. 
PDGF-dependent phosphorylation of smap8 was induced prior to ERK1/2 activation, 
and was repressed by staurosporine, a general inhibitor of serine/threonine 
kinases. Furthermore, activation of both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 was markedly enhanced 
in these cells. Smap8 might therefore regulate the potentiation of ERK1/2 
signalling induced by PDGF treatment. Our results imply that smap8 is involved 
in the regulation of mitogenic signalling in vascular smooth muscle cells, 
possibly in response to a homocysteine-induced injury.
