Formins are conserved Rho-GTPase effectors that communicate Rho-GTPase signals 
to the cytoskeleton. We found that formins were required for the assembly of one 
of the three budding yeast actin structures: polarized arrays of actin cables. A 
dominant-active formin induced the assembly of actin cables. The activation and 
localization of the formin Bni1p required components of the polarisome complex. 
These findings potentially define the cellular function of formins in budding 
yeast and explain their involvement in the generation of cell polarity. A 
requirement for formins in constructing specific actin structures might be the 
basis for the diverse activities of formins in development.
