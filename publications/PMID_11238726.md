Genetic studies have implicated amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. While accumulating lines of evidence 
indicate that APP has various functions in cells, little is known about the 
proteins that modulate its biological activity. Toward this end, we employed a 
two-hybrid system to identify potential interacting factors. We now report that 
fibulin-1, which contains repetitive Ca(2+)-binding EGF-like elements, binds to 
APP at its amino-terminal growth factor-like domain, the region that is 
responsible for its neurotrophic activities. Fibulin-1 expression in the brain 
is confined to neurons, and is not expressed significantly by astrocytes or 
microglia. Direct binding of fibulin-1 to the secreted form of APP (sAPP) was 
demonstrated with a pull-down assay using fragments of both fibulin-1 fused with 
glutathione-S transferase and sAPP, produced in bacteria and yeast, 
respectively. The fibulin-1/sAPP heteromer was shown to form in the conditioned 
medium of transfected COS-7 cells. Furthermore, fibulin-1 blocks sAPP-mediated 
proliferation of primary cultured rat neural stem cells. These results suggest 
that fibulin-1 may play a significant role in modulating the neurotrophic 
activities of APP.
