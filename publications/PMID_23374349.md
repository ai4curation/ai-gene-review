How the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activates is incompletely 
understood. The intracellular portion of the receptor is intrinsically active in 
solution, and to study its regulation, we measured autophosphorylation as a 
function of EGFR surface density in cells. Without EGF, intact EGFR escapes 
inhibition only at high surface densities. Although the transmembrane helix and 
the intracellular module together suffice for constitutive activity even at low 
densities, the intracellular module is inactivated when tethered on its own to 
the plasma membrane, and fluorescence cross-correlation shows that it fails to 
dimerize. NMR and functional data indicate that activation requires an 
N-terminal interaction between the transmembrane helices, which promotes an 
antiparallel interaction between juxtamembrane segments and release of 
inhibition by the membrane. We conclude that EGF binding removes steric 
constraints in the extracellular module, promoting activation through N-terminal 
association of the transmembrane helices.

Introduction

Receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), play critical roles in regulating metabolism, growth and differentiation ( Hubbard and Till, 2000 ; Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010 ). A single transmembrane helix in these receptors connects an N-terminal extracellular ligand-binding module to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Ligand binding increases catalytic activity in the kinase domains and leads to phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues. In EGFR, these tyrosines are principally located in a long C-terminal tail.

In this paper, and a companion one ( Arkhipov et al. ), we examine how ligand binding to the extracellular module of EGFR activates its kinase domains. EGFR was the first growth factor receptor demonstrated to undergo ligand-dependent dimerization ( Yarden and Schlessinger, 1987 ), and crystal structures have shown how ligand binding promotes the dimerization of the extracellular module ( Ferguson et al., 2003 ; Garrett et al., 2002 ; Ogiso et al., 2002 ). A critical step in EGFR activation is the formation of an asymmetric dimer of kinase domains ( Zhang et al., 2006 ), in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain (the activator) and the N-terminal lobe of another kinase domain (the receiver) associate, stabilizing an active conformation of the receiver kinase domain ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). Activation through asymmetric homo- or hetero-dimerization underlies the combinatorial activation of EGFR and its close relatives Her2, Her3 and Her4 ( Jura et al., 2011 ; Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001 ).

It is natural to think that ligand-driven dimerization of EGFR simply converts inactive monomers into active dimeric receptors, but the mechanism cannot be so simple. The isolated intracellular module of the receptor (consisting of the juxtamembrane segment, kinase domain and C-terminal tail) is active at relatively low concentrations in solution (< 1μM) ( Jura et al., 2009 ; Red Brewer et al., 2009 ; Thiel and Carpenter, 2007 ). This is a consequence of the juxtamembrane segments stabilizing the asymmetric dimer necessary for activity ( Jura et al., 2009 ; Red Brewer et al., 2009 ). The C-terminal portion of the juxtamembrane segment (denoted JM-B) of the receiver kinase latches onto the activator kinase domain ( Figure 1A ). The N-terminal portion of the juxtamembrane segment (JM-A) is thought to form an antiparallel helical association between subunits, further stabilizing the asymmetric dimer ( Jura et al., 2009 ; Scheck et al., 2012 ). Clearly, the responsiveness of the receptor to ligand implies that the intrinsic activity of the intracellular module is suppressed in some way when the ligand is not bound.

EGFR family members are prone to ligand-independent dimerization and activation at high expression levels ( Nagy et al., 2010 ). The coupled equilibria governing EGFR activation, incorporating both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent dimerization, are diagrammed in Figure 1A ( Yarden and Schlessinger, 1987 ). This diagram omits the formation of higher-order oligomers ( Clayton et al., 2008 ) and negative cooperativity in ligand binding ( Alvarado et al., 2010 ; Liu et al., 2012 ; Macdonald and Pike, 2008 ), both of which are also likely to be important for EGFR function.

We now present an experimental analysis of EGFR activation aimed at understanding how the conformations of the extracellular and intracellular module are coupled. The companion paper presents the results of molecular dynamics simulations of the receptor in lipid bilayers ( Arkhipov et al. ), which provided a framework for interpreting some of our experimental results. We begin by using immunofluorescence to measure EGFR autophosphorylation as a function of receptor surface density in cells. Our data lead to the unexpected conclusion that the intrinsic activity of the intracellular module is inhibited when it is tethered to the plasma membrane. We show, using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) that the inhibition of the intracellular module at the membrane is due to a failure to dimerize. These data point to a critical role for the transmembrane helix in dimerizing and activating the intracellular module, but the role of the transmembrane helix in EGFR activation is poorly understood ( Lu et al., 2010 ; Lu et al., 2012 ; Moriki et al., 2001 ). We address this by using NMR to analyze the structure of the transmembrane and juxtamembrane segments of EGFR in lipid bilayers.

Conclusions

The presence of the juxtamembrane segment dimerizes the isolated intracellular module of EGFR in solution, suggesting that the principal function of ligand binding to the intact receptor is to change the structure of the extracellular module such that it does not impede the intrinsic ability of the intracellular module to activate ( Jura et al., 2009 ). Unexpectedly, we find that ligand binding must also play a role in altering the conformation of the transmembrane helix and the JM-A segment to promote receptor activation, because the intracellular module is monomeric and inhibited when it is localized to the plasma membrane on its own.

Our NMR analysis shows that the formation of the JM-A helix is coupled to the configuration of the transmembrane helices, and occurs outside of the membrane. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that when EGFR is in an inactive conformation, the LRRLL motif within the JM-A segment is buried in the membrane ( Arkhipov et al. ), consistent with NMR data for the isolated juxtamembrane segment of EGFR in detergent micelles ( Choowongkomon et al., 2005 ). These observations suggest that the nature of the interaction between the transmembrane helices toggles the configuration and membrane association of the JM-A portion of the juxtamembrane segments ( Figure 7A ).

A recent cell-based study clearly links an antiparallel interaction between the JM-A helices to EGFR activation and not just dimerization ( Scheck et al., 2012 ). We propose that the JM-A segments need to be pulled off the membrane in order to promote the asymmetric interaction between kinase domains. The latch formed by the JM-B segment of the receiver on the C-lobe of the activator kinase domain positions the sidechain of Glu 666 of the receiver near Arg 949 of the activator, providing an anchor point for the C-terminal end of the receiver JM-A segment ( Red Brewer et al., 2009 ; Wood et al., 2008 ). In a crystal structure of the EGFR intracellular module with an intact juxtamembrane segment, the JM-A helix is anchored at this point, but is directed away from the surface of the activator kinase by crystal lattice contacts ( Red Brewer et al., 2009 ). We believe, instead, that the polar face of the JM-A helix of the receiver interacts with the surface of the kinase domain, as modeled earlier ( Jura et al., 2009 ) and seen consistently in the molecular dynamics simulations. If the receiver JM-A helix is docked in this way, then the leucine residues of the LRRLL motif point up from the surface of the kinase domain and are available for interaction with the activator JM-A helix, as shown schematically in Figure 7B . Our NMR data suggest that dimerization of the transmembrane helices through the N-terminal interface facilitates this arrangement.

Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the extracellular module of EGFR prevents the close approach of the transmembrane helices that would be required for interaction through the N-terminal dimerization motif ( Arkhipov et al. ), even when the receptor is dimerized in the absence of ligand. Consistent with this idea, ligand-independent activation of the receptor can be increased when flexible linkers are inserted between the extracellular module and the transmembrane helix. Thus, we believe that an essential role for EGF in receptor activation is to cause a specific conformational change in the extracellular modules that allows the transmembrane helices to interact through their N-terminal interface.

A striking feature of the activation mechanism is the strong cooperativity between the external, internal and transmembrane segments of EGFR. We speculate that because the EGFR dimer interface is mediated entirely by the receptor itself, selective pressure for inhibitory mechanisms to prevent ligand-independent activation has been particularly strong. At the same time, because EGFR signaling requires a specific dimeric configuration of kinase domains, there must also be selective pressure to stabilize that configuration. The balance of these competing requirements may have driven the evolution of counter-balanced activating and inhibiting mechanisms that minimize ligand-independent activation and facilitate the formation of appropriate heterodimers in response to external cues.
