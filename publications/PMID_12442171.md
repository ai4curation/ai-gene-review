The breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA2 controls the function of RAD51, a 
recombinase enzyme, in pathways for DNA repair by homologous recombination. We 
report here the structure of a complex between an evolutionarily conserved 
sequence in BRCA2 (the BRC repeat) and the RecA-homology domain of RAD51. The 
BRC repeat mimics a motif in RAD51 that serves as an interface for 
oligomerization between individual RAD51 monomers, thus enabling BRCA2 to 
control the assembly of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, which is essential for 
strand-pairing reactions during DNA recombination. The RAD51 oligomerization 
motif is highly conserved among RecA-like recombinases, highlighting a common 
evolutionary origin for the mechanism of nucleoprotein filament formation, 
mirrored in the BRC repeat. Cancer-associated mutations that affect the BRC 
repeat disrupt its predicted interaction with RAD51, yielding structural insight 
into mechanisms for cancer susceptibility.
