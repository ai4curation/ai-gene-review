Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a cytokine supporting the differentiation 
and survival of a number of neural cell types. Its receptor complex consists of 
a ligand-binding component, CNTF receptor (CNTFR), associated with two signaling 
receptor components, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). 
Striking phenotypic differences between CNTF- and CNTFR-deficient mice suggest 
that CNTFR serves as a receptor for a second developmentally important ligand. 
We recently demonstrated that cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) associates with 
the soluble orphan receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF) to form a heterodimeric 
cytokine that displayed activities only on cells expressing the tripartite CNTF 
receptor on their surface. In this present study we examined the membrane 
binding of the CLC/CLF composite cytokine and observed a preferential 
interaction of the cytokine with the CNTFR subunit. Signaling pathways recruited 
by the CLC/CLF complex in human neuroblastoma cell lines were also analyzed in 
detail. The results obtained showed an activation of Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, 
and TYK2) leading to a tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp130 and LIFR. The 
phosphorylated signaling receptors served in turn as docking proteins for signal 
transducing molecules such as STAT3 and SHP-2. In vitro analysis revealed that 
the gp130-LIFR pathway could also stimulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In contrast to that reported 
before for CNTF, soluble CNTFR failed to promote the action CLC/CLF, and an 
absolute requirement of the membrane form of CNTFR was required to generate a 
functional response to the composite cytokine. This study reinforces the 
functional similarity between CNTF and the CLC/CLF composite cytokine defining 
the second ligand for CNTFR.
