The molecular chaperone HspB8 [Hsp (heat-shock protein) B8] is member of the 
B-group of Hsps. These proteins bind to unfolded or misfolded proteins and 
protect them from aggregation. HspB8 has been reported to form a stable 
molecular complex with the chaperone cohort protein Bag3 (Bcl-2-associated 
athanogene 3). In the present study we identify the binding regions in HspB8 and 
Bag3 crucial for their interaction. We present evidence that HspB8 binds to Bag3 
through the hydrophobic groove formed by its strands beta4 and beta8, a region 
previously known to be responsible for the formation and stability of 
higher-order oligomers of many sHsps (small Hsps). Moreover, we demonstrate that 
two conserved IPV (Ile-Pro-Val) motifs in Bag3 mediate its binding to HspB8 and 
that deletion of these motifs suppresses HspB8 chaperone activity towards mutant 
Htt43Q (huntingtin exon 1 fragment with 43 CAG repeats). In addition, we show 
that Bag3 can bind to the molecular chaperone HspB6. The interaction between 
HspB6 and Bag3 requires the same regions that are involved in the HspB8-Bag3 
association and HspB6-Bag3 promotes clearance of aggregated Htt43Q. Our findings 
suggest that the co-chaperone Bag3 might prevent the accumulation of denatured 
proteins by regulating sHsp activity and by targeting their substrate proteins 
for degradation. Interestingly, a mutation in one of Bag3 IPV motifs has 
recently been associated with the development of severe dominant childhood 
muscular dystrophy, suggesting a possible important physiological role for 
HspB-Bag3 complexes in this disease.
