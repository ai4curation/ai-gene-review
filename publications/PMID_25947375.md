We showed previously that ATP11A and ATP11C have flippase activity toward 
aminophospholipids (phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)) 
and ATP8B1 and that ATP8B2 have flippase activity toward phosphatidylcholine 
(PC) (Takatsu, H., Tanaka, G., Segawa, K., Suzuki, J., Nagata, S., Nakayama, K., 
and Shin, H. W. (2014) J. Biol. Chem. 289, 33543-33556). Here, we show that the 
localization of class 5 P4-ATPases to the plasma membrane (ATP10A and ATP10D) 
and late endosomes (ATP10B) requires an interaction with CDC50A. Moreover, 
exogenous expression of ATP10A, but not its ATPase-deficient mutant 
ATP10A(E203Q), dramatically increased PC flipping but not flipping of PS or PE. 
Depletion of CDC50A caused ATP10A to be retained at the endoplasmic reticulum 
instead of being delivered to the plasma membrane and abrogated the increased PC 
flipping activity observed by expression of ATP10A. These results demonstrate 
that ATP10A is delivered to the plasma membrane via its interaction with CDC50A 
and, specifically, flips PC at the plasma membrane. Importantly, expression of 
ATP10A, but not ATP10A(E203Q), dramatically altered the cell shape and decreased 
cell size. In addition, expression of ATP10A, but not ATP10A(E203Q), delayed 
cell adhesion and cell spreading onto the extracellular matrix. These results 
suggest that enhanced PC flipping activity due to exogenous ATP10A expression 
alters the lipid composition at the plasma membrane, which may in turn cause a 
delay in cell spreading and a change in cell morphology.
