Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, for which there 
are no effective disease-modifying therapies. The transcription factor ATF4 
(activating transcription factor 4) is induced by multiple PD-relevant 
stressors, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative damage. ATF4 may 
exert either protective or deleterious effects on cell survival, depending on 
the paradigm. However, the role of ATF4 in the pathogenesis of PD has not been 
explored. We find that ATF4 levels are increased in neuromelanin-positive 
neurons in the substantia nigra of a subset of PD patients relative to controls. 
ATF4 levels are also upregulated in neuronal PC12 cells treated with the 
dopaminergic neuronal toxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). To explore the role of ATF4 in cell survival 
in PD-relevant contexts, we either silenced or overexpressed ATF4 in cellular 
models of PD. In neuronal PC12 cells, silencing of ATF4 enhanced cell death in 
response to either 6-OHDA or MPP+. Conversely, overexpression of ATF4 reduced 
cell death caused by dopaminergic neuronal toxins. ATF4 was also protective 
against 6-OHDA-induced death of cultured mouse ventral midbrain dopaminergic 
neurons. We further show that parkin, a gene associated with autosomal recessive 
PD, plays a critical role in ATF4-mediated protection. After treatment with 
6-OHDA or MPP+, parkin protein levels fall, despite an increase in mRNA levels. 
ATF4 silencing exacerbates the toxin-induced reduction of parkin, whereas ATF4 
overexpression partially preserves parkin levels. Finally, parkin silencing 
blocked the protective capacity of ATF4. These results indicate that ATF4 plays 
a protective role in PD through the regulation of parkin.
