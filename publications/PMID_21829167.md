Eukaryotic up-frameshift 1 (UPF1) is a nucleic acid-dependent ATPase and 
5'-to-3' helicase, best characterized for its roles in cytoplasmic RNA quality 
control. We previously demonstrated that human UPF1 binds to telomeres in vivo 
and its depletion leads to telomere instability. Here, we show that UPF1 is 
present at telomeres at least during S and G2/M phases and that UPF1 association 
with telomeres is stimulated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-related 
protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) and by 
telomere elongation. UPF1 physically interacts with the telomeric factor TPP1 
and with telomerase. Akin to UPF1 binding to telomeres, this latter interaction 
is mediated by ATR. Moreover, the ATPase activity of UPF1 is required to prevent 
the telomeric defects observed upon UPF1 depletion, and these defects stem 
predominantly from inefficient telomere leading-strand replication. Our results 
portray a scenario where UPF1 orchestrates crucial aspects of telomere biology, 
including telomere replication and telomere length homeostasis.
