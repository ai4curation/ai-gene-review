The netrins define a family of chemotropic factors that have been shown to play 
a central role in axon guidance. We identified two exon traps encoding 
netrin-like sequences during the assembly of a transcriptional map for the 
genomic interval surrounding the polycystic kidney disease type 1 and tuberous 
sclerosis type 2 genes. We describe the characterization of a novel human 
netrin-2-like gene, designated NTN2L, and its transcript. The genomic interval 
containing the NTN2L gene was sequenced, and the coding region was predicted 
based on computer analysis. The structure of the NTN2L gene has been confirmed 
utilizing nested RT-PCR. The NTN2L gene is predicted to encode a 580-amino-acid 
protein having homology to the chicken and Drosophila netrins and to 
Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-6. The NTN2L gene has a restricted pattern of 
expression; its transcript is undetectable by Northern analysis in all tissues 
examined, but can be recovered from spinal cord RNA by RT-PCR. This report 
represents the first description and characterization of a human netrin.
