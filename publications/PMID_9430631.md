The role of glucose trimming in the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae was investigated using glucosidase inhibitors and mutant strains 
devoid of glucosidases I and II. These glucosidases are responsible for removing 
glucose residues from the N-linked core oligosaccharides attached to newly 
synthesized polypeptide chains. In mammalian cells they participate together 
with calnexin, calreticulin and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase in 
the folding and quality control of newly synthesized glycoproteins. In 
S.cerevisiae, glucosidase II is encoded by the GLS2 gene, and glucosidase I, as 
suggested here, by the CWH41 gene. Using castanospermine (an alpha-glucosidase 
inhibitor) and yeast strains defective in glucosidase I, glucosidase II and 
BiP/Kar2p, it was demonstrated that cell wall synthesis depends on the two 
glucosidases and BiP/Kar2p. In double mutants with defects in both BiP/Kar2p and 
either of the glucosidases the phenotype was particularly clear: synthesis of 
1,6-beta-glucan_a cell wall component_was reduced; the cell wall displayed 
abnormal morphology; the cells aggregated; and their growth was severely 
inhibited. No defects in protein folding or secretion could be detected. We 
concluded that glucose trimming in S.cerevisiae is necessary for proper cell 
wall synthesis, and that the glucosidases function synergistically with 
BiP/Kar2p in this process.
