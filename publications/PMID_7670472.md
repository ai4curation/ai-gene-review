Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are 
dominantly inherited chondrodysplasias characterized by short stature and 
early-onset osteoarthrosis. The disease genes in families with PSACH and MED 
have been localized to an 800 kilobase interval on the short arm of chromosome 
19. Recently the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) was 
localized to chromosome 19p13.1. In three patients with these diseases, we 
identified COMP mutations in a region of the gene that encodes a Ca++ binding 
motif. Our data demonstrate that PSACH and some forms of MED are allelic and 
suggest an essential role for Ca++ binding in COMP structure and function.
