Mutations in striated muscle alpha-tropomyosin (alpha-TM), an essential thin 
filament protein, cause both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and familial 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two distinct point mutations within 
alpha-tropomyosin are associated with the development of DCM in humans: Glu40Lys 
and Glu54Lys. To investigate the functional consequences of alpha-TM mutations 
associated with DCM, we generated transgenic mice that express mutant alpha-TM 
(Glu54Lys) in the adult heart. Results showed that an increase in transgenic 
protein expression led to a reciprocal decrease in endogenous alpha-TM levels, 
with total myofilament TM protein levels remaining unaltered. Histological and 
morphological analyses revealed development of DCM with progression to heart 
failure and frequently death by 6 months. Echocardiographic analyses confirmed 
the dilated phenotype of the heart with a significant decrease in the left 
ventricular fractional shortening. Work-performing heart analyses showed 
significantly impaired systolic, and diastolic functions and the force 
measurements of cardiac myofibers revealed that the myofilaments had 
significantly decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity and tension generation. Real-time 
RT-PCR quantification demonstrated an increased expression of beta-myosin heavy 
chain, brain natriuretic peptide, and skeletal actin and a decreased expression 
of the Ca(2+) handling proteins sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and 
ryanodine receptor. Furthermore, our study also indicates that the alpha-TM54 
mutation decreases tropomyosin flexibility, which may influence actin binding 
and myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. The pathological and physiological 
phenotypes exhibited by these mice are consistent with those seen in human DCM 
and heart failure. As such, this is the first mouse model in which a mutation in 
a sarcomeric thin filament protein, specifically TM, leads to DCM.
