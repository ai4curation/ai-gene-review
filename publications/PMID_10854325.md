Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a proinflammatory cytokine that elicits its pleiotropic 
effects through activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1. 
Binding of IL-1 to its receptor results in rapid assembly of a membrane-proximal 
signalling complex that consists of two different receptor chains (IL-1Rs), 
IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP, the adaptor protein MyD88, the serine/threonine kinase IRAK 
and a new protein, which we have named Tollip. Here we show that, before 
IL-1beta treatment, Tollip is present in a complex with IRAK, and that 
recruitment of Tollip-IRAK complexes to the activated receptor complex occurs 
through association of Tollip with IL-1RAcP. Co-recruited MyD88 then triggers 
IRAK autophosphorylation, which in turn leads to rapid dissociation of IRAK from 
Tollip (and IL-1Rs). As overexpression of Tollip results in impaired NF-kappaB 
activation, we conclude that Tollip is an important constituent of the IL-1R 
signalling pathway.
