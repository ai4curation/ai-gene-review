BACKGROUND: Successful transition from oocyte to zygote depends on the timely 
degradation of oocyte proteins to prepare for embryonic development. In C. 
elegans, degradation of the oocyte protein MEI-1 depends on MBK-2, a kinase that 
phosphorylates MEI-1 shortly after fertilization during the second meiotic 
division.
RESULTS: Here we report that precise timing of MEI-1 phosphorylation depends on 
the cell cycle-regulated release of MBK-2 from the cortex. Prior to the meiotic 
divisions, MBK-2 is tethered at the cortex by EGG-3, an oocyte protein required 
for egg activation (see [1], accompanying paper in this issue). During the 
meiotic divisions, EGG-3 is internalized and degraded in an APC/C 
(anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome)-dependent manner. EGG-3 internalization 
and degradation correlate with MBK-2 release from the cortex and MEI-1 
phosphorylation in the cytoplasm. In an egg-3 mutant, MEI-1 is phosphorylated 
and degraded prematurely.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that successful transition from an oocyte to a zygote 
depends on the cell cycle-regulated relocalization of key regulators from the 
cortex to the cytoplasm of the egg.
