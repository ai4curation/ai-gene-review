Maintaining active growth and effective immune responses is often costly for a 
living organism to survive. Fine-tuning the shared cross-regulators is crucial 
for metazoans and plants to make a trade-off between growth and immunity. The 
Arabidopsis regulatory receptor-like kinase BAK1 complexes with the receptor 
kinases FLS2 in bacterial flagellin-triggered immunity and BRI1 in 
brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated growth. BR homeostasis and signaling 
unidirectionally modulate FLS2-mediated immune responses at multiple levels. We 
have shown previously that BIK1, a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, is directly 
phosphorylated by BAK1 and associates with FLS2/BAK1 complex in transducing 
flagellin signaling. In contrast to its positive role in plant immunity, we 
report here that BIK1 acts as a negative regulator in BR signaling. The bik1 
mutant displays various BR hypersensitive phenotypes accompanied with increased 
accumulation of de-phosphorylated BES1 proteins and transcriptional regulation 
of BZR1 and BES1 target genes. BIK1 associates with BRI1, and is released from 
BRI1 receptor upon BR treatment, which is reminiscent of FLS2-BIK1 complex 
dynamics in flagellin signaling. The ligand-induced release of BIK1 from 
receptor complexes is associated with BIK1 phosphorylation. However, in contrast 
to BAK1-dependent FLS2-BIK1 dissociation, BAK1 is dispensable for BRI1-BIK1 
dissociation. Unlike FLS2 signaling which depends on BAK1 to phosphorylate BIK1, 
BRI1 directly phosphorylates BIK1 to transduce BR signaling. Thus, BIK1 relays 
the signaling in plant immunity and BR-mediated growth via distinct 
phosphorylation by BAK1 and BRI1, respectively. Our studies indicate that BIK1 
mediates inverse functions in plant immunity and development via dynamic 
association with specific receptor complexes and differential phosphorylation 
events.

Abstract

Maintaining active growth and effective immune responses is often costly for a living organism to survive. Fine-tuning the shared cross-regulators is crucial for metazoans and plants to make a trade-off between growth and immunity. The Arabidopsis regulatory receptor-like kinase BAK1 complexes with the receptor kinases FLS2 in bacterial flagellin-triggered immunity and BRI1 in brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated growth. BR homeostasis and signaling unidirectionally modulate FLS2-mediated immune responses at multiple levels. We have shown previously that BIK1, a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, is directly phosphorylated by BAK1 and associates with FLS2/BAK1 complex in transducing flagellin signaling. In contrast to its positive role in plant immunity, we report here that BIK1 acts as a negative regulator in BR signaling. The bik1 mutant displays various BR hypersensitive phenotypes accompanied with increased accumulation of de-phosphorylated BES1 proteins and transcriptional regulation of BZR1 and BES1 target genes. BIK1 associates with BRI1, and is released from BRI1 receptor upon BR treatment, which is reminiscent of FLS2-BIK1 complex dynamics in flagellin signaling. The ligand-induced release of BIK1 from receptor complexes is associated with BIK1 phosphorylation. However, in contrast to BAK1-dependent FLS2-BIK1 dissociation, BAK1 is dispensable for BRI1-BIK1 dissociation. Unlike FLS2 signaling which depends on BAK1 to phosphorylate BIK1, BRI1 directly phosphorylates BIK1 to transduce BR signaling. Thus, BIK1 relays the signaling in plant immunity and BR-mediated growth via distinct phosphorylation by BAK1 and BRI1, respectively. Our studies indicate that BIK1 mediates inverse functions in plant immunity and development via dynamic association with specific receptor complexes and differential phosphorylation events.

Discussion

BIK1 was originally identified as Botrytis -induced kinase and plays critical roles in mediating plant resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens ( 28 ). We and others have shown that BIK1 is rapidly phosphorylated upon bacterial flagellin perception and associates with flagellin receptor complex in transducing plant immune signaling ( 15 , 16 ). BIK1 is a direct substrate of BAK1, a shared regulatory component of multiple MAMP receptors and plant hormone BR receptor BRI1. Consistent with this notion, BIK1 is involved in immune signaling triggered by multiple MAMPs likely through association with the corresponding receptors. BIK1 is also phosphorylated upon ethylene treatment and required for responses to ethylene ( 30 ). Surprisingly, in this study, our extensive phenotypic, genetic, and biochemical examination of bik1 mutant revealed that in contrast to its positive roles in plant immune and ethylene signaling, BIK1 negatively regulates BR-mediated responses and signaling. BIK1 complexes with BRI1 and dissociates from the BRI1 complex upon BL perception, likely as a result of BIK1 phosphorylation by BRI1. Intriguingly, BAK1 is required for flagellin-induced BIK1 release from FLS2, but not for BL-induced BIK1 release from BRI1. Consistent with the data that FLS2 is a non–arginine-aspartate (RD) kinase with little kinase activity whereas BRI1 is an RD kinase with strong kinase activity ( 5 ), we observed a direct phosphorylation of BIK1 by BRI1, not by FLS2. Thus, BIK1 relays flagellin signaling via BAK1-mediated phosphorylation, whereas BIK1 is directly phosphorylated by BRI1 in transducing BR signaling ( Fig. S9 ). Differential phosphorylation of BIK1 by BAK1 and BRI1 may determine the substrate specificity and signaling outcomes. Identification of the in vivo phosphorylation sites of BIK1 and characterization of their functional requirement in BR- and flagellin-mediated responses will shed light on how BIK1 positively regulates flagellin signaling but negatively controls BR signaling.

Several other members of the RLCKs, including BSKs from subfamily XII and CDG1 from subfamily VIIc have been identified as signaling components in transducing BR signaling via association with BR receptor BRI1 ( 8 , 9 ). Similar to BIK1, BSKs associate with BRI1 and are released from the BRI1 complex upon BR perception. However, unlike BIK1, BSKs and CDG1 play positive roles in BR signaling. CDG1 directly phosphorylates BSU1, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the negative regulator BIN2 ( 9 ). Phosphorylation of BSK1 by BRI1 promotes BSK1 binding to BSU1, which inactivates BIN2 kinase activity ( 33 ). Moreover, BSKs and CDG1 differ from BIK1 in that BSKs and CDG1 associate only with BRI1 and are phosphorylated by BRI1, not by BAK1. In contrast, BIK1 associates with both BRI1 and BAK1 and is phosphorylated by BRI1 and BAK1. Apparently, BIK1–BAK1 interaction and phosphorylation are more involved in flagellin signaling than that in BR signaling. Similar with BSKs and CDG1, BR-mediated BIK1 phosphorylation and BRI1-BIK1 dissociation are independent of BAK1. This result suggests the similarity and distinction of individual RLCKs in mediating different plant signaling pathways.

Our data indicate that the bik1 mutant possesses enhanced BR signaling. It has been shown that BR homeostasis and signaling antagonize flg22-induced responses ( 26 , 27 ). One question is whether the compromised immune responses in the bik1 mutant are attributed to the elevated BR signaling. Accumulating evidence argues against this possibility. First, although exogenous application of BL inhibited certain FLS2- and EFR-mediated responses ( 26 ), it has not been reported that BR could promote disease symptom development or bacterial multiplication in Arabidopsis . In contrast, tobacco plants treated with BL exhibited enhanced resistance to multiple pathogens, including Pseudomonas bacteria ( 34 ). Besides compromised flg22-induced ROS production and defense gene activation, the bik1 mutant plants are also deficient in resistance to nonpathogenic bacterial infection and flg22-mediated restriction of bacterial growth ( 15 , 16 ). Second, elevated BR signaling is not directly correlated with compromised immune responses. Although plants overexpressing BRI1 blocked FLS2- and EFR-mediated responses, BRI1 sud1 plants with normal BRI1 protein level, but increased BRI1 signaling, display enhanced flg22-induced signaling ( 27 ). It has been proposed that the increased levels of BRI1, not increased BR signaling in BRI1 overexpressing plants, contribute to the antagonistic effects on MAMP signaling. We did not detect the reproducible difference of BRI1 protein level in WT and bik1 mutant, suggesting that enhanced BR signaling in bik1 mutant is not caused by overproduction of BRI1 receptor. Third, BR treatment did not affect flg22-mediated BIK1 phosphorylation ( 26 ). BIK1 phosphorylation is one of the earliest steps in flagellin signaling. Thus, the antagonistic effects on MAMP signaling by BL treatment are not due to the reduced BIK1 phosphorylation and activity. Together, the functions of BIK1 in flg22 and BR signaling are mechanistically uncoupled and the compromised immune responses in the bik1 mutant are not simply due to the elevated BR signaling.
