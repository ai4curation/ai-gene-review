Calcofluor is an antifungal compound known to induce structural perturbations of 
the cell wall by interfering with the synthesis of chitin microfibril. Proteins 
from a stripped plasma membrane fraction were solubilized with the neutral and 
non-denaturing detergent, the n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside. Proteins were then 
resolved using a recently described ion-exchange chromatography (IEC)/lithium 
dodecyl sulfate (LDS)-PAGE procedure. Nearly 90 proteins were identified and 
clustered, based on their pI, molecular weight, abundance and/or hydrophobicity. 
This method was then applied to profile the plasma membrane response to 
calcofluor. The LDS-PAGE patterns obtained from whole plasma membrane proteins 
were similar for the non-treated and calcofluor-treated samples. However, 
IEC/LDS-PAGE analysis revealed subtle changes in the expression of several 
proteins of low abundance, in response to calcofluor. These proteins include 
Pil1p and Lsp1p, two sphingolipid long-chain base-responsive inhibitors of 
protein kinases involved in signaling pathways for cell wall integrity and 
Rho1p, a small GTPase. It was recently hypothesized that Pil1p and Lsp1p could 
associate with, and regulate, the plasma membrane beta-1-3-glucan synthase, 
responsible for the synthesis of another major microfibril for yeast cell wall. 
Results are discussed with respect to both calcofluor effects on the plasma 
membrane proteins and the power of the IEC/LDS-PAGE procedure in the search for 
new potential therapeutics targets.
