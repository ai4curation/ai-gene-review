A novel cDNA fragment was identified from a human fetal brain cDNA library by 
using the coding sequence of human BRI3 gene (Accession No. NM015379) as bait in 
a yeast two-hybrid screening. Then by 5'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA end) 
and electronic hybridization, we obtained a 1.9 kb contig which consists of a 
novel gene. It was designated as BRI3BP by the HUGO Nomenclature Committee. It 
contains an open reading frame encoding 251 amino acids. The calculated 
molecular weight of the deduced protein is 27.8 kU. The predicted isoelectric 
point is 9.48. Northern hybridization showed its mRNA was highly expressed in 
brain, kidney, and liver. By RH mapping, the BRI3BP gene was mapped to human 
chromosome 12q24.2-qter
