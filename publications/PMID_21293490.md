Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor-protein (APP) 
produces both a characterstic amyloid-β peptide that contributes to neuritic 
plaque formation and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease and a small APP 
intracellular domain (AICD) that transcriptionally activates genes implicated in 
Alzheimer disease pathology. Although the biochemical events leading to 
amyloidogenic APP processing at the cell membrane have been described in detail, 
comparably little is known about the mechanistic basis of AICD-dependent gene 
regulation in the nucleus. In this study, we show that the AICD activates 
transcription by targeting MED12, an RNA polymerase II transcriptional Mediator 
subunit that is implicated in human cognitive development. The AICD binds to 
MED12/Mediator in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of the AICD/MED12 interaction 
inhibits AICD transactivation potential and expression of AICD target genes. 
Mediator, in a MED12-dependent manner, occupies only AICD-bound promoter DNA, 
indicating that the AICD recruits Mediator to activate transcription. These 
results identify the MED12 interface in Mediator as a crucial transducer of AICD 
transactivation and a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer disease.
