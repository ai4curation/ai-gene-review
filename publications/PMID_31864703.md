RFX7 is an important member in the RFX family of DNA binding proteins and plays 
critical roles in natural killer cell-mediated immunity and neuron development. 
Our previous work identified ANKRA2 and RFXANK as the potential binding partners 
of RFX7. Here we present two structures of a RFX7 fragment, with one bound with 
the ANKRA2 ankyrin domain and the other bound to the RFXANK ankyrin domain. Our 
structural analysis reveals that both ANKRA2 and RFXANK recognize the PXLPXL 
motif of RFX7 and its flanking sequences via extensive hydrophobic interactions. 
Detailed structural comparison also provides an explanation for the different 
RFX7 binding affinities of ANKRA2 and RFXANK. Thus our work would provide clue 
to the understanding the roles of ANKRA2 and RFXANK in the RFX7-associated 
signaling pathway.
