Human and mouse cDNAs showing homology to the Clostridium perfringens 
enterotoxin (CPE) receptor gene (CPE-R) from Vero cells (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM 
accession no. D88492) (Katahira, J., Inoue, N., Horiguchi, Y., Matsuda, M., and 
Sugimoto, N. (1997) J. Cell Biol. 136, 1239-1247) were cloned. They were 
classified into two groups, the Vero cell CPE receptor homologues and rat 
androgen withdrawal apoptosis protein (RVP1; accession no. M74067) homologues, 
based on the similarities of primary amino acid sequences. L929 cells that were 
originally insensitive to CPE became sensitive to CPE on their transfection with 
cDNAs encoding either the CPE receptor or RVP1 homologues, indicating that these 
gene products are not only structurally similar but also functionally active as 
receptors for CPE. By binding assay, the human RVP1 homologue showed differences 
in affinity and capacity of binding from those of the human CPE receptor. 
Northern blot analysis showed that mouse homologues of the CPE receptor and RVP1 
are expressed abundantly in mouse small intestine. The expression of CPE-R mRNA 
in the small intestine was restricted to cryptic enterocytes, indicating that 
the CPE receptor is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. These results are 
consistent with reports that CPE binds to the small intestinal cells via two 
different kinds of receptors. High levels of expression of CPE-R and/or RVP1 
mRNA were also detected in other organs, including the lungs, liver, and 
kidneys, but only low levels were expressed in heart and skeletal muscles. These 
results indicate that CPE uses structurally related cellular proteins as 
functional receptors in vivo and that organs that have not so far been 
recognized as CPE-sensitive have the potential to be targets of CPE.
