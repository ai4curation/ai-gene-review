Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires the action of approximately 200 
trans-acting factors and the incorporation of 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs). The 
delivery of RPs to preribosomes is a major challenge for the cell because RPs 
are often highly basic and contain intrinsically disordered regions prone to 
nonspecific interactions and aggregation. To counteract this, eukaryotes 
developed dedicated chaperones for certain RPs that promote their solubility and 
expression, often by binding eukaryote-specific extensions of the RPs. Rps2 
(uS5) is a universally conserved RP that assembles into nuclear pre-40S 
subunits. However, a chaperone for Rps2 had not been identified. Our laboratory 
previously characterized Tsr4 as a 40S biogenesis factor of unknown function. 
Here, we report that Tsr4 cotranslationally associates with Rps2. Rps2 harbors a 
eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension that is critical for its interaction 
with Tsr4. Moreover, Tsr4 perturbation resulted in decreased Rps2 levels and 
phenocopied Rps2 depletion. Despite Rps2 joining nuclear pre-40S particles, Tsr4 
appears to be restricted to the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that Tsr4 is a 
cytoplasmic chaperone dedicated to Rps2.
