Noonan syndrome (NS) and related disorders are autosomal dominant disorders 
characterized by heart defects, facial dysmorphism, ectodermal abnormalities, 
and mental retardation. The dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway appears to be 
a common molecular pathogenesis of these disorders: mutations in PTPN11, KRAS, 
and SOS1 have been identified in patients with NS, those in KRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, 
and MAP2K2 in patients with CFC syndrome, and those in HRAS mutations in 
Costello syndrome patients. Recently, mutations in RAF1 have been also 
identified in patients with NS and two patients with LEOPARD (multiple 
lentigines, electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, 
pulmonary stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural 
deafness) syndrome. In the current study, we identified eight RAF1 mutations in 
18 of 119 patients with NS and related conditions without mutations in known 
genes. We summarized clinical manifestations in patients with RAF1 mutations as 
well as those in NS patients withPTPN11, SOS1, or KRAS mutations previously 
reported. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and short stature were found to be more 
frequently observed in patients with RAF1 mutations. Mutations in RAF1 were 
clustered in the conserved region 2 (CR2) domain, which carries an inhibitory 
phosphorylation site (serine at position 259; S259). Functional studies revealed 
that the RAF1 mutants located in the CR2 domain resulted in the decreased 
phosphorylation of S259, and that mutant RAF1 then dissociated from 14-3-3, 
leading to a partial ERK activation. Our results suggest that the 
dephosphorylation of S259 is the primary pathogenic mechanism in the activation 
of RAF1 mutants located in the CR2 domain as well as of downstream ERK.
