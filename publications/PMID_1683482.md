The Hox-2.1 gene is one of homeobox-containing genes located in the Hox-2 
cluster on mouse chromosome 11. In this study, we have examined transcription of 
the Hox-2.1 gene during differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells induced 
by treatment with retinoic acid. The level of Hox-2.1 mRNA increases rapidly 
after induction of differentiation and then falls. Nuclear run-on experiments 
demonstrate that the rate of transcription for the Hox-2.1 gene also increases 
upon differentiation. Treatment of F9 cells with a DNA topoisomerase II 
inhibitor etoposide (VP-16) during differentiation blocks the accumulation of 
Hox-2.1 mRNA. Nuclear run-on analyses reveal that etoposide inhibits 
transcription of the Hox-2.1 gene during F9 cell differentiation. Measurements 
of the level of Hox-2.1 mRNA after blocking transcription by actinomycin D show 
that etoposide does not affect stability of the mRNA. These observations 
indicate that DNA topoisomerase II is involved in the control of Hox-2.1 gene 
transcription.
