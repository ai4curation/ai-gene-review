Uteroglobin is a progesterone binding protein, a member of the antiflammin gene 
family and possibly a novel cytokine. Initially, uteroglobin was identified as 
the major protein of rabbit uterine secretion during the phase of 
preimplantation. Counterparts of the rabbit uteroglobin or its gene are 
described in rat, mouse, hamster, hare, pig, horse and human. While uteroglobin 
appears as one of the most extensively studied proteins, particularly its 
physico-chemical properties, including its crystal structure and its gene, the 
true physiological role of this protein still remains to be unravelled. 
Essential to understanding the significance of human uteroglobin in reproductive 
organs, particularly in the endometrium, is a knowledge of the spatial and 
chronological expression of this secretory protein. Our studies on 115 
volunteers combined reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 
immunohistochemistry and quantitative assessment by an enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay for uteroglobin. The expression, localization and release of 
uteroglobulin in the human endometrium are presented. Secretory uteroglobin is 
found in endometrial tissue homogenates in highest levels of expression during 
the early luteal phase (days 15-19, 340 pg/mg total protein). In turn, 
uteroglobin is released into the uterine lumen in peak amounts during the 
receptive phase of the menstrual cycle (mid-luteal phase, days 20-23, secretion 
level 833.4 pg/mg total protein). Our immunohistochemical studies match with 
these results, as uteroglobin is located during the early and mid-luteal phase 
in the apical compartments of endometrial gland cells. These observations 
strongly suggest an involvement of uteroglobin in endometrial preparations for 
implantation.
