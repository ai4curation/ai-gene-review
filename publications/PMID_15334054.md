Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a pleiotropic cytokine implicated 
as a pathogenic mediator in various liver diseases. Enhanced TGF-beta production 
and lack of TGF-beta responses are often observed during hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection. In this study, we demonstrate that TGF-beta-mediated transactivation 
is decreased in cells exogenously expressing the intact HCV polyprotein. Among 
10 viral products of HCV, only core and nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) physically 
interact with the MH1 (Mad homology 1) region of the Smad3 and block 
TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated transcriptional activation through interference with the 
DNA-binding ability of Smad3, not the nuclear translocation. However, the 
interactive domain of NS3 extends to the MH2 (Mad homology 2) region of Smad3 
and a distinction is found between effects mediated, respectively, by these two 
viral proteins. HCV core, in the presence or absence of TGF-beta, has a stronger 
suppressive effect on the DNA-binding and transactivation ability of Smad3 than 
NS3. Although HCV core, NS3, and the HCV subgenomic replicon all attenuate 
TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated apoptosis, only HCV core represses TGF-beta-induced G1 
phase arrest through downregulation of the TGF-beta-induced p21 promoter 
activation. Along with this, HCV core, rather than NS3, exhibits a significant 
inhibitory effect on the binding of Smad3/Sp1 complex to the proximal p21 
promoter in response to TGF-beta. In conclusion, HCV viral proteins interact 
with the TGF-beta signaling mediator Smad3 and differentially impair 
TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated transactivation and growth inhibition. This functional 
counteraction of TGF-beta responses provides insights into possible mechanisms, 
whereby the HCV oncogenic proteins antagonize the host defenses during 
hepatocarcinogenesis.
