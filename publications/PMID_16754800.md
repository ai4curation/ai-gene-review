BACKGROUND: Mutations in sarcomere protein, PRKAG2, LAMP2, alpha-galactosidase A 
(GLA), and several mitochondrial genes can cause rare familial cardiomyopathies, 
but their contribution to increased left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) in 
the community is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 1862 unrelated participants (52% women; age, 
59+/-9 years) from the community-based Framingham Heart Study who had 
echocardiograms and provided DNA samples but did not have severe hypertension, 
aortic prosthesis, or significant aortic stenosis. Eight sarcomere protein 
genes, 3 storage cardiomyopathy-causing genes, and 27 mitochondrial genes were 
sequenced in unrelated individuals with increased LVWT (maximum LVWT >13 mm). 
Fifty eligible participants (9 women) had unexplained increased LVWT. We 
detected 8 mutations in 9 individuals (2 women); 7 mutations in 5 sarcomere 
protein genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, MYL3), and 1 GLA mutation. In 
individuals with increased LVWT, participants with sarcomere protein and storage 
mutations were clinically indistinguishable from those without mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based cohort, about 3% of eligible participants had 
increased LVWT, of whom 18% had sarcomere protein or lipid storage gene 
mutations. Increased LVWT in the community is a very heterogeneous condition, 
which sometimes may arise from single-gene variants in one of a number of genes.
