RSC is an essential and abundant ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex from 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we show that the RSC components Rsc7/Npl6 and 
Rsc14/Ldb7 interact physically and/or functionally with Rsc3, Rsc30, and Htl1 to 
form a module important for a broad range of RSC functions. A strain lacking 
Rsc7 fails to properly assemble RSC, which confers sensitivity to temperature 
and to agents that cause DNA damage, microtubule depolymerization, or cell wall 
stress (likely via transcriptional misregulation). Cells lacking Rsc14 display 
sensitivity to cell wall stress and are deficient in the assembly of Rsc3 and 
Rsc30. Interestingly, certain rsc7delta and rsc14delta phenotypes are suppressed 
by an increased dosage of Rsc3, an essential RSC member with roles in cell wall 
integrity and spindle checkpoint pathways. Thus, Rsc7 and Rsc14 have different 
roles in the module as well as sharing physical and functional connections to 
Rsc3. Using a genetic array of nonessential null mutations (SGA) we identified 
mutations that are sick/lethal in combination with the rsc7delta mutation, which 
revealed connections to a surprisingly large number of chromatin remodeling 
complexes and cellular processes. Taken together, we define a protein module on 
the RSC complex with links to a broad spectrum of cellular functions.
