The Hippo pathway senses cell density information to control tissue growth by 
regulating the localization of the transcriptional regulators TAZ and YAP 
(TAZ/YAP). TAZ/YAP also regulate TGF-β-SMAD signaling, but whether this role is 
linked to cell density sensing is unknown. Here we demonstrate that TAZ/YAP 
dictate the localization of active SMAD complexes in response to cell 
density-mediated formation of polarity complexes. In high-density cell cultures, 
the Hippo pathway drives cytoplasmic localization of TAZ/YAP, which sequesters 
SMAD complexes, thereby suppressing TGF-β signaling. We show that during mouse 
embryogenesis, this is reflected by differences in TAZ/YAP localization, which 
define regions of active SMAD2/3 complexes. Interfering with TAZ/YAP 
phosphorylation drives nuclear accumulation of TAZ/YAP and SMAD2/3. Furthermore, 
we demonstrate that the Crumbs polarity complex interacts with TAZ/YAP, which 
relays cell density information by promoting TAZ/YAP phosphorylation, 
cytoplasmic retention, and suppressed TGF-β signaling. Accordingly, disruption 
of the Crumbs complex enhances TGF-β signaling and predisposes cells to 
TGF-β-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions.
