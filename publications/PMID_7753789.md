Arabidopsis COP1 acts inside the nucleus to suppress photomorphogenic cellular 
development, and light inactivation of COP1 may involve a specific control of 
its nuclear activity in hypocotyls and cotyledons, but not in roots, of 
developing seedlings. To understand the molecular mechanisms of COP1 action 
during light-mediated development, we initiated a screen for Arabidopsis cDNAs 
encoding proteins which interact directly with COP1 in vitro as a step to 
identify the cellular components involved. We report here the isolation and 
characterization of a cDNA clone encoding a protein designated CIP1 
(COP1-interactive protein 1). CIP1 is predominantly alpha-helical and most 
likely involved in coiled-coil formation. It interacts specifically with the 
putative coiled-coil region of COP1 in vitro. Further, CIP1 is encoded by a 
single gene in Arabidopsis, and its mRNA and protein levels are not regulated by 
light. Immunofluorescent labeling of CIP1 in Arabidopsis seedling protoplasts 
demonstrated that CIP1 is part of, or associated with, a cytoskeletal structure 
in hypocotyl and cotyledon cells, but not in roots. Our results are consistent 
with a possible role of CIP1 in mediating light control of COP1 nuclear activity 
by regulating its nucleocytoplasmic partitioning.

Arabidopsis COP1 acts inside the nucleus to suppress photomorphogenic cellular development, and light inactivation of COP1 may involve a specific control of its nuclear activity in hypocotyls and cotyledons, but not in roots, of developing seedlings. To understand the molecular mechanisms of COP1 action during light-mediated development, we initiated a screen for Arabidopsis cDNAs encoding proteins which interact directly with COP1 in vitro as a step to identify the cellular components involved. We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding a protein designated CIP1 (COP1-interactive protein 1). CIP1 is predominantly alpha-helical and most likely involved in coiled-coil formation. It interacts specifically with the putative coiled-coil region of COP1 in vitro. Further, CIP1 is encoded by a single gene in Arabidopsis, and its mRNA and protein levels are not regulated by light. Immunofluorescent labeling of CIP1 in Arabidopsis seedling protoplasts demonstrated that CIP1 is part of, or associated with, a cytoskeletal structure in hypocotyl and cotyledon cells, but not in roots. Our results are consistent with a possible role of CIP1 in mediating light control of COP1 nuclear activity by regulating its nucleocytoplasmic partitioning.
