The hepatitis B virus X protein is a promiscuous transcriptional transactivator. 
Transactivation by the X protein is most likely mediated through binding to 
different cellular factors. Using the yeast two-hybrid method, we have isolated 
a clone that encodes a novel X-associated cellular protein: XAP2. X and XAP2 
interactions also occur in vitro. Antiserum raised against XAP2 recognizes a 
cytoplasmic protein with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa. The interaction 
between X and XAP2 requires a small region on X containing amino acids 13-26. 
From Northern blot analyses, XAP2 is ubiquitously expressed in both 
liver-derived and non-liver-derived cell lines as well as in normal non-liver 
tissues. In contrast, XAP2 is expressed in very low level in the normal human 
liver. In transfection assays, overexpression of XAP2 abolishes transactivation 
by the X protein. Based on these results, we suggest that XAP2 is an important 
cellular negative regulator of the X protein, and that X-XAP2 interaction may 
play a role in HBV pathology.
