The Fc receptor common gamma-chain (FcRgamma) is a widely expressed adaptor 
bearing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that transduces 
activation signals from various immunoreceptors. We show here that basophils 
lacking FcRgamma developed normally and proliferated efficiently in response to 
interleukin 3 (IL-3) but were very impaired in IL-3-induced production of IL-4 
and in supporting T helper type 2 differentiation. Through its transmembrane 
portion, FcRgamma associated constitutively with the common beta-chain of the 
IL-3 receptor and signaled by recruiting the kinase Syk. Retrovirus-mediated 
complementation demonstrated the essential function of the ITAM of FcRgamma in 
IL-3 signal transduction. Our results identify a previously unknown mechanism 
whereby FcRgamma functions to 'route' selective cytokine-triggered signals into 
the ITAM-mediated IL-4 production pathway.
