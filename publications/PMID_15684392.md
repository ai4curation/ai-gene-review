FOXC1 mutations underlie Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, an autosomal dominant 
disorder that is characterized by a spectrum of ocular and nonocular phenotypes 
and results in an increased susceptibility to glaucoma. Proteins interacting 
with FOXC1 were identified in human nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells. Here 
we demonstrate that FOXC1 interacts with the actin-binding protein filamin A 
(FLNA). In A7 melanoma cells possessing elevated levels of nuclear FLNA, FOXC1 
is unable to activate transcription and is partitioned to an HP1alpha, 
heterochromatin-rich region of the nucleus. This inhibition is mediated through 
an interaction between FOXC1 and the homeodomain protein PBX1a. In addition, we 
demonstrate that efficient nuclear and subnuclear localization of PBX1 is 
mediated by FLNA. Together, these data reveal a mechanism by which structural 
proteins such as FLNA can influence the activity of a developmentally and 
pathologically important transcription factor such as FOXC1. Given the 
resemblance of the skeletal phenotypes caused by FOXC1 loss-of-function 
mutations and FLNA gain-of-function mutations, this inhibitory activity of FLNA 
on FOXC1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of FLNA-linked skeletal disorders.
