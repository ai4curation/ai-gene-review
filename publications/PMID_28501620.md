Alzheimer's disease is a growing concern in the context of the increasing 
lifespan of the populations. The work presented here is part of the fight 
against this threat. It supports a therapeutic approach to reduce the incidence 
of Alzheimer's disease, taking advantage of the specific binding of several 
domains of Netrin-1 to the β-amyloid precursor protein. This basic knowledge 
shall then be used to predict, design or characterize lead compounds that may in 
turn inhibit/delay Alzheimer's disease's progression, extending the therapeutic 
offer of the other leads already being investigated in this line. The present 
work is focused on the interaction of the various portions of APP with the three 
domains of Netrin-1, the so-called LamNT, EGF-like and NTR domains respectively. 
It reveals in detail which portions of APP and Netrin-1 are specifically 
involved in these interactions, using ELISA technique in combination with 
protein-protein binding simulations. So far unsuspected interaction sites 
located in Netrin-1 EGF-like and NTR domains open possibilities for new 
therapeutic approaches in which these sites will be specifically targeted.
