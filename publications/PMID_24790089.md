Microbes are detected by the pathogen-associated molecular patterns through 
specific host pattern recognition receptors. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) is an intracellular pattern recognition 
receptor that recognizes fragments of the bacterial cell wall. NOD2 is important 
to human biology; when it is mutated it loses the ability to respond properly to 
bacterial cell wall fragments. To determine the mechanisms of misactivation in 
the NOD2 Crohn mutants, we developed a cell-based system to screen for 
protein-protein interactors of NOD2. We identified heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) 
as a protein interactor of both wild type and Crohn mutant NOD2. HSP70 has 
previously been linked to inflammation, especially in the regulation of 
anti-inflammatory molecules. Induced HSP70 expression in cells increased the 
response of NOD2 to bacterial cell wall fragments. In addition, an HSP70 
inhibitor, KNK437, was capable of decreasing NOD2-mediated NF-κB activation in 
response to bacterial cell wall stimulation. We found HSP70 to regulate the 
half-life of NOD2, as increasing the HSP70 level in cells increased the 
half-life of NOD2, and down-regulating HSP70 decreased the half-life of NOD2. 
The expression levels of the Crohn-associated NOD2 variants were less compared 
with wild type. The overexpression of HSP70 significantly increased NOD2 levels 
as well as the signaling capacity of the mutants. Thus, our study shows that 
restoring the stability of the NOD2 Crohn mutants is sufficient for rescuing the 
ability of these mutations to signal the presence of a bacterial cell wall 
ligand.
