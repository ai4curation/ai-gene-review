Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) can cause cervical cancer. Expression of 
the viral E1 E4 protein is lost during malignant progression, but in 
premalignant lesions, E1 E4 is abundant in cells supporting viral DNA 
amplification. Expression of 16E1 E4 in cell culture causes G2 cell cycle 
arrest. Here we show that unlike many other G2 arrest mechanisms, 16E1 E4 does 
not inhibit the kinase activity of the Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex. Instead, 16E1 E4 
uses a novel mechanism in which it sequesters Cdk1/cyclin B1 onto the 
cytokeratin network. This prevents the accumulation of active Cdk1/cyclin B1 
complexes in the nucleus and hence prevents mitosis. A mutant 16E1 E4 (T22A, 
T23A) which does not bind cyclin B1 or alter its intracellular location fails to 
induce G2 arrest. The significance of these results is highlighted by the 
observation that in lesions induced by HPV16, there is evidence for Cdk1/cyclin 
B1 activity on the keratins of 16E1 E4-expressing cells. We hypothesize that E1 
E4-induced G2 arrest may play a role in creating an environment optimal for 
viral DNA replication and that loss of E1 E4 expression may contribute to 
malignant progression.
