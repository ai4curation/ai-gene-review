Introduction

The cell cycle network is a highly sophisticated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that integrates a large body of information, and thereby orchestrates versatile cellular functions. The cell cycle engine (cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-cyclin complexes) and the two major tumor suppressors (pRB and p53) play pivotal roles not only in cell proliferation, but also in cell growth, death, senescence and differentiation. 1 Thus, the cell cycle network is involved in multiple pleiotropic cellular activities, and occupies a central position within the global information network of the cell. However, little is known about the network architecture and molecular basis that facilitate the coordination between distinct functional modules. Here, as a starting point, we aimed to identify a cell cycle protein that may have a role in the network coordination.

In terms of systems biology, the PPI network is scale-free. 2 In the scale-free network, most proteins interact with few partners while a small number of hub proteins interact with many partners. 3 Hub proteins are more critical than most non-hub proteins for maintenance of the network integrity and functions. 4 Furthermore, hub proteins are classified into intermodular hubs and intramodular hubs. 5 , 6 Intermodular hubs bind their different partners asynchronously and organize the proteome by connecting the biological modules to one another. In contrast, intramodular hubs interact with their partners simultaneously, and act inside functional modules. Importantly, the intermodular hubs are frequently associated with oncogenesis. 7 This is because mutations of intermodular hubs lead to alterations in the network modularity, causing dysfunction of the whole network. 7 , 8 The multifaceted functions of the cell cycle network support the existence of an intermodular hub that may integrate the distinct functional modules. 9 Thus, the discovery of such a putative intermodular hub in the cell cycle network will provide important insights into the cell physiology with direct relevance to cancer pathogenesis.

Ubiquitin-mediated regulation of the cell cycle machinery is closely linked with the genesis of cancer. 10 Among the components of the ubiquitination system, E3 ligases are the primary determinants of target recognition. 11 The G 1 cyclins (cyclins D and E) are basically degraded by Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein (SCF) complexes. 12 The SCF complexes use different F-box proteins to recognize distinct substrates. To date, several F-box proteins have been found to ubiquitinate either cyclin D1 or E. Specifically, FBX4/αB crystallin complex, 13 FBXW8 14 and FBXO31 15 target cyclin D1 while FBXW7 16 recognizes cyclin E. These SCF ubiquitin ligases contribute to the control at the G 1 /S boundary by promoting the degradation of the specific G 1 cyclins. Impaired ubiquitination of either G 1 cyclin causes its aberrant overexpression, ultimately leading to cancer. 17 In light of the strong associations between deregulated ubiquitination and human cancers, 18 identification of the ubiquitin ligase for G 1 cyclins is of great importance.

We previously identified NIRF (Np95/ICBP90-like RING finger protein) as a ubiquitin ligase that interacts with the CDK2-cyclin E complex, and induces G 1 arrest. 19 , 20 NIRF has a multidomain composition, comprising a NIRF_N domain (ubiquitin-like domain), PHD finger domain, YDG/SRA domain and RING finger domain. 21 It is therefore suggested that NIRF exerts its cell cycle function via the formation of complexes with various signaling molecules. Here, we show that NIRF interacts with multiple cell cycle proteins including cyclins (A2, B1, D1 and E1), p53 and pRB, suggesting that it works in tight collaboration with the core cell cycle machinery. A bioinformatic network analysis suggested that NIRF is an intermodular hub with a high betweenness centrality 22 and occupies an important position in the cell cycle network. 23 , 24 Notably, and consistent with the G 1 -arresting function of NIRF, it ubiquitinated both cyclins D1 and E1. This is in contrast to the SCF-type ubiquitin ligases that only target either cyclin D1 or E for ubiquitination. 13 – 16 Thus, NIRF seems to be another ubiquitin ligase that functions at the G 1 /S boundary and has a possible relationship with tumorigenesis.

In accordance with this context, we found loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the NIRF gene in several types of cancer. Our database mining analysis further revealed statistically significant losses in the DNA copy numbers of NIRF in various types of tumors. In addition, a recurrent microdeletion targeting NIRF in non-small cell lung carcinoma was observed. Of note, NIRF is in the immediate vicinity of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs719725, which is reportedly associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. 25 Thus, the NIRF ubiquitin ligase targets both G 1 cyclins, and is a candidate tumor suppressor with features of an intermodular hub in the cell cycle network.

Discussion

NIRF appears to represent an intermodular hub protein that interacts with the core components of the cell cycle machinery and exhibits a unique centrality in the hierarchical modular architecture of the cell cycle network. NIRF ubiquitinates the two different classes of G 1 cyclins (D1 and E1), and induces G 1 arrest. DNA copy number loss in various malignancies was found for the NIRF gene, which was the target of a recurrent microdeletion in non-small cell lung carcinoma. In addition, the NIRF gene was closely linked with a susceptibility locus of colorectal carcinoma. These observations suggest that NIRF is a novel component of the core cell cycle machinery and is also a novel tumor suppressor.

Hub proteins hold the whole network together and are therefore important in both the topology maintenance and functioning of the network. 2 , 4 The analysis of the NIRF PPI network indicated its scale-free property, and demonstrated the presence of a few highly connected hubs in the cell cycle network. Applying the top 20% as a general threshold, 23 the degree and centrality indices for NIRF were sufficiently high that NIRF can be judged to be a hub protein with high betweenness. While the degree and centrality indices of NIRF were not among the top-ranked ones, it is often mentioned that more extensively studied proteins are prone to investigative bias to have more interactions than less intensely studied proteins. 72 – 74 In addition, the centrality indices of a node tend to be correlated with its degree, 44 , 75 indicating that there are also biases in the centrality indices of the well-known proteins in the network. Accordingly, it is feasible that the centrality indices as well as the degree determined for NIRF in this study are all underestimated. More interacting partners will probably be found for NIRF in the near future, which will raise its centrality indices even higher.

The cell cycle network directs not only cell cycle progression, but also diverse cellular processes, 1 in which NIRF behaves as an intermodular hub protein. 5 , 7 NIRF is a hub protein that characteristically interacts with the principal components of the cell cycle network, i.e., cyclins and their CDKs, pRB and p53. Each of these molecules is also a hub protein, with profound influences on different aspects of the cell cycle. These hub proteins individually interact with many other proteins composing the respective functional modules, which as a whole constitute a huge PPI network. 6 Eventually, the cell cycle network organized in this way not only regulates the cell cycle but also orchestrates versatile cellular functions such as cell growth, death, differentiation and senescence. 1 In this sense, the cell cycle network itself can be viewed as occupying a pivotal position in the cellular interactome network comprising a multitude of signaling pathways. On the other hand, NIRF is an intermodular hub protein with high betweenness, and is thereby supposed to occupy a unique critical position not only in the cell cycle network but also in the whole information network of the cell. As an intermodular hub protein connecting network modules, NIRF may be involved in the coordination of diverse information flows related to cell cycle control. Importantly, mutations of intermodular hubs are frequently associated with carcinogenesis. 7 , 76 This is because such aberrations in intermodular hubs result in abnormalities in both network organization and information flow, culminating in global dysfunction of the network. 7 , 8 Accordingly, it is possible that abnormalities in the NIRF gene may abrogate the integrity of the cell cycle network, which might ultimately bring about tumorigenesis.

NIRF is capable of ubiquitinating both cyclins D1 and E1 that cooperate with each other to control the G 1 /S transition. 1 This is consistent with the idea that NIRF is a cell cycle protein involved in G 1 /S inhibition. 20 The ubiquitination of these G 1 cyclins has been assigned to the SCF-type ubiquitin ligases. 12 , 17 Our findings demonstrate that NIRF is another ubiquitin ligase for cyclins D1 and E1. Intriguingly, there are some differences in the ubiquitinating properties between NIRF and the SCF ubiquitin ligases. First, the SCF ubiquitin ligases are only able to target either cyclin D1 or E, but not both, 18 thereby allowing individual control for each cyclin. In contrast, NIRF ubiquitinates both G 1 cyclins, which could provide coordinated regulation at the G 1 /S boundary. Second, NIRF seems to directly bind to the G 1 cyclins independently of phosphorylation, as shown by our in vitro assay results that NIRF binds to cyclin D1 and E1 and directly promotes their ubiquitination. In contrast, the SCF ligases recognize the cyclins only when they are phosphorylated. 13 – 16 It is noteworthy that, in addition to the phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination, phosphorylation-independent ubiquitination pathways have been proposed for both cyclins D1 13 and E. 77 To the best of our knowledge, NIRF is the first example of a single-subunit ubiquitin ligase grouped into the latter category. These differences between NIRF and the SCF ligases suggest a unique mechanism underlying the substrate recognition by NIRF. In addition, our results highlight a possible characteristic property of NIRF as a hub-type ubiquitin ligase targeting multiple substrates for ubiquitination. Thus, in cases with abnormalities of NIRF, the control for both cyclins D1 and E might become coincidentally abrogated, which could readily result in impaired control at the G 1 /S boundary. This is one possible scenario in which defects in an intermodular hub with ubiquitin ligase activity disrupt the integrity of the cell cycle control, ultimately leading to tumor formation. A similar related example has been proposed for BRCA1. 7

From the above considerations, we hypothesized that NIRF may be involved in the genesis of malignancies as a novel tumor suppressor. In support of this, the NIRF gene is localized in 9p24, which is deleted in numerous types of tumors at the highest frequency 46 and where many publications have proposed the presence of various tumor-associated genes. 60 – 66 Indeed, our database analyses provided findings compatible with our hypothesis. A significant loss of the DNA copy number of the NIRF gene was shown in several types of tumors. In particular, a recurrent microdeletion targeting NIRF was found in non-small cell lung carcinoma. Consistently, the NIRF mRNA was reduced in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung carcinoma, both of which are subtypes of non-small cell lung carcinoma. These analytic findings suggest that loss of the NIRF gene is associated with tumor formation, supporting the concept that NIRF is a tumor suppressor. This is in good agreement with the observation that NIRF induces G 1 arrest, since many tumor suppressors function at the G/S boundary to inhibit inappropriate cell cycle progression. 1 , 37

To our surprise, the SNP rs719725, a reported susceptibility locus for colorectal carcinoma, 25 is present in the immediate vicinity of the NIRF gene, further strengthening the possible relationship of NIRF with carcinogenesis. Of note, this SNP is localized just within the commonly deleted region observed in the non-small cell lung carcinoma data set. This observation indicates that this SNP locus is really a target of chromosomal aberration in a particular type of cancer. It also suggests that a single deletion event can simultaneously affect both the NIRF gene and this SNP locus. Although the SNP rs719725 has not been known to be linked with the risk of non-small cell lung carcinoma, it is not surprising that a single locus is associated with predispositions to multiple types of tumors. Therefore, the above observations meet our expectation that a chromosomal deletion of the NIRF gene might be involved in the formation of tumors, again raising the probability that NIRF functions in tumor suppression.

To characterize NIRF as a unique hub protein in the cell cycle network, several more points should be taken into account. First, NIRF interacts with the two major tumor suppressors (pRB and p53) as well as the two different G 1 cyclins (cyclins D1 and E1), all of which are the critical regulators of the G 1 checkpoint system. The G 1 checkpoint is the most critical barrier that hinders cells from undergoing malignant transformation. 78 Given that NIRF exhibits several properties compatible with a tumor suppressor, these interactions suggest an intense functional interplay between NIRF and all of the above cell cycle proteins to ensure the precise functioning of the G 1 checkpoint control. NIRF might cooperate with pRB and p53 to effectively induce G 1 arrest in response to various insults that trigger DNA damage. Second, NIRF also interacts with the mitotic cyclins (cyclins A2 and B1), suggesting other roles for NIRF in the intra-S and G 2 /M controls. These are novel findings that demonstrate a distinguishing characteristic of NIRF, since no other ubiquitin ligases interact with all the members of the cyclin family. These observations also suggest the possibility that a common mechanism is responsible for the binding between NIRF and the different classes of cyclins (manuscript in preparation). Lastly, NIRF has a paralogous ubiquitin ligase, Np95/ICBP90/UHRF1, with opposing effects on cell cycle progression. 31 , 32 This paralog has been reported to be involved in the epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation through an association of its SRA domain with DNMT1. 79 While our study characterized the relationships of NIRF with the PPI network, ubiquitination and genetic aberration, corresponding studies regarding Np95/ICBP90/UHRF1 have not yet been reported. A comparative study will be informative to better define the role for this family in cell cycle control, in light of their associations with cancer. In addition, there is a high degree of sequence conservation between the SRA domains of NIRF and Np95/ICBP90/UHRF1, 21 , 39 suggesting that NIRF also functions in epigenetic regulation. In this regard, a further study should be performed to examine the possible biological couplings among the cell cycle, ubiquitination and epigenetic regulations by NIRF and Np95/ICBP90/UHRF1.

In summary, based on the characteristic centrality within the hierarchical modular architecture of the cell cycle network, NIRF is supposed to influence multiple signaling modules related to cell cycle control. It is also suggested that NIRF induces G 1 arrest by ubiquitinating both cyclins D1 and E1 and thereby acts as a tumor suppressor. We propose that NIRF occupies a pivotal position within the global information network of the cells, thus defining a critical nodal point connecting multiple signaling modules whose defect is associated with tumorigenesis.
