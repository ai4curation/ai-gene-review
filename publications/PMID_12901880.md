The execution phase of apoptosis is characterized by marked changes in cell 
morphology that include contraction and membrane blebbing. Little is known about 
the mechanisms underlying this process. We report here the identification of a 
novel member of BNIPL family, designated Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19kDa interacting 
protein 2 like-2 (BNIPL-2), which interacts with Bcl-2 and Cdc42GAP. We found 
that the human BNIPL-2 shares homology to human BNIP-2 and also possesses a 
BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP homology (BCH) domain. Deletion experiments indicated that 
the BCH domain of BNIPL-2 is critical for its interactions with the Bcl-2 and 
Cdc42GAP and also for its cell death-inducing function. Our data showed that 
BNIPL-2 may be a linker protein located at the front end of Bcl-2 pathway for 
DNA fragmentation and Cdc42 signaling for morphological changes during 
apoptosis. We propose that BNIPL-2 protein may play an important role in 
regulation of both pathways for DNA fragmentation and for formation of membrane 
blebs in apoptotic cells.
