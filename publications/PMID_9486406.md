Using autoimmune serum from a patient with anti-centromere antibodies, we have 
identified and partially characterized a novel protein with a mol. wt of 
approximately 27 kD (hereafter referred to as p27). A cDNA expression library 
was screened with this serum, and two overlapping inserts were isolated among 
three positive clones other than clones corresponding to centromere protein 
(CENP)-B and CENP-C. Analysis of the sequence showed an open reading frame of 
approximately 0.6 kb encoding 199 amino acids with a predicted mol. wt of 21.5 
kD. Immunoblotting analysis with bacterial recombinant p27 showed that 
approximately 2% of anti-centromere antibody-positive patients had 
autoantibodies to p27, whereas only one of 215 autoimmune patients without 
anti-centromere antibodies reacted with the recombinant. All five cases with 
anti-p27 antibodies, who were diagnosed as having scleroderma and/or Sjögren's 
syndrome, showed internal organ involvement. Although affinity-purified anti-p27 
human or mouse polyclonal antibodies failed to stain any cellular structures in 
an immunofluorescence study, the potential association of anti-p27 with 
anti-centromere antibodies suggests that this novel autoantigen might play a 
role in mitosis.
