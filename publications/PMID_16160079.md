Gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid cells secrete multiple neuroendocrine (NE) 
markers and hormones including 5-hydroxytryptamine and chromogranin A. We were 
interested in determining whether activation of the Notch1 signal transduction 
pathway in carcinoid cells could modulate production of NE markers and hormones. 
Human pancreatic carcinoid cells (BON cells) were stably transduced with an 
estrogen-inducible Notch1 construct, creating BON-NIER cells. In the present 
study, we found that Notch1 is not detectable in human GI carcinoid tumor cells. 
The induction of Notch1 in human BON carcinoid cells led to high levels of 
functional Notch1, as measured by CBF-1 binding studies, resulting in activation 
of the Notch1 pathway. Similar to its developmental role in the GI tract, Notch1 
pathway activation led to an increase in hairy enhancer of split 1 (HES-1) 
protein and a concomitant silencing of human Notch1/HES-1/achaete-scute homolog 
1. Furthermore, Notch1 activation led to a significant reduction in NE markers. 
Most interestingly, activation of the Notch1 pathway caused a significant 
reduction in 5-hydroxytryptamine, an important bioactive hormone in carcinoid 
syndrome. In addition, persistent activation of the Notch1 pathway in BON cells 
led to a notable reduction in cellular proliferation. These results demonstrate 
that the Notch1 pathway, which plays a critical role in the differentiation of 
enteroendocrine cells, is highly conserved in the gut. Therefore, manipulation 
of the Notch1 signaling pathway may be useful for expanding the targets for 
therapeutic and palliative treatment of patients with carcinoid tumors.
