Previously, pA134 was identified as one of the mRNAs present in the squid giant 
axon. Comparative sequence analyses revealed that the pA134 gene product 
manifested significant similarity to the mammalian lipoprotein receptor adaptor 
protein also known as ARH (autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia). ARH mRNA 
and protein displayed very similar pattern of expression throughout the mouse 
brain. Significant levels of expression were observed in cells with a 
predominantly neuronal profile in the cerebellum, brainstem, olfactory bulb, 
hippocampus, and cortex. A yeast two hybrid screen for ARH protein interactions 
in mouse brain identified the following binders: amyloid precursor-like protein 
1, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 1, LRP8, and GABA 
receptor-associated protein-like 1. The interactions of ARH with LRP1 and GABA 
receptor-associated protein-like 1 were subsequently verified by 
co-immunoprecipitation of the protein complexes from transfected human embryonic 
kidney cells. The presence of ARH mRNA in axon of primary sympathetic neurons 
was established by RT-PCR analyses and confirmed by in situ hybridization. Taken 
together, our data suggest that ARH is a multifunctional protein whose spectrum 
of function in the brain goes beyond the traditionally known metabolism of 
lipoproteins, and that ARH may be locally synthesized in the axon.
