Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are subdivided into three classes--HDAC I, HDAC II, 
and Sir2. Sirt proteins are mammalian members of the Sir2 family of NAD+ 
(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent protein deacetylases. The balance 
between acetylation and deacetylation of histone and non-histone proteins, 
regulated by protein acetyltransferases and deacetylases, affects the expression 
of genes involved in a variety of cellular processes. In addition, HDAC1 is 
acetylated and regulated by p300, a transcriptional co-activator with protein 
acetyltransferase activity, suggesting that protein acetyltransferases and 
deacetylases they control the activities of each other. Although the regulation 
of HDAC1 by p300 is well characterized, the relationship between Sir2 homologs 
and p300 is not understood. Here, we report that p300 interacts with Sirt2, a 
member of the Sir2 family, and triggers the acetylation and subsequent 
down-regulation of the deacetylation activity of Sirt2, and that the acetylation 
of Sirt2 by p300 relieves the inhibitory effect of Sirt2 on the transcriptional 
activity of p53. These observations demonstrate that p300 can inactivate Sirt2 
by acetylation and that p300 may regulate the activity of p53 indirectly through 
Sirt2 in addition to its direct modification of p53.
