Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
disease caused by expansion of a glutamine-encoding repeat in ataxin 1 (ATXN1). 
In all known polyglutamine diseases, the glutamine expansion confers toxic 
functions onto the protein; however, the mechanism by which this occurs remains 
enigmatic, in light of the fact that the mutant protein apparently maintains 
interactions with its usual partners. Here we show that the expanded 
polyglutamine tract differentially affects the function of the host protein in 
the context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine expansion 
in ATXN1 favours the formation of a particular protein complex containing RBM17, 
contributing to SCA1 neuropathology by means of a gain-of-function mechanism. 
Concomitantly, polyglutamine expansion attenuates the formation and function of 
another protein complex containing ATXN1 and capicua, contributing to SCA1 
through a partial loss-of-function mechanism. This model provides mechanistic 
insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as well as other polyglutamine 
diseases.
