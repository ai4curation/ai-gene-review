The decapping of eukaryotic mRNAs is a key step in their degradation. The 
heteroheptameric Lsm1p-7p complex is a general activator of decapping and also 
functions in protecting the 3' ends of deadenylated mRNAs from a 3'-trimming 
reaction. Lsm1p is the unique member of the Lsm1p-7p complex, distinguishing 
that complex from the functionally different Lsm2p-8p complex. To understand the 
function of Lsm1p, we constructed a series of deletion and point mutations of 
the LSM1 gene and examined their effects on phenotype. These studies revealed 
the following: (i) Mutations affecting the predicted RNA-binding and 
inter-subunit interaction residues of Lsm1p led to impairment of mRNA decay, 
suggesting that the integrity of the Lsm1p-7p complex and the ability of the 
Lsm1p-7p complex to interact with mRNA are important for mRNA decay function; 
(ii) mutations affecting the predicted RNA contact residues did not affect the 
localization of the Lsm1p-7p complex to the P-bodies; (iii) mRNA 3'-end 
protection could be indicative of the binding of the Lsm1p-7p complex to the 
mRNA prior to activation of decapping, since all the mutants defective in mRNA 
3' end protection were also blocked in mRNA decay; and (iv) in addition to the 
Sm domain, the C-terminal domain of Lsm1p is also important for mRNA decay 
function.
