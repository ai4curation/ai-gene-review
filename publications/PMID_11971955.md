In the U12-dependent spliceosome, the U4atac/U6atac snRNP represents the 
functional analogue of the major U4/U6 snRNP. Little information is available 
presently regarding the protein composition of the former snRNP and its 
association with other snRNPs. In this report we show that human U4atac/U6atac 
di-snRNPs associate with U5 snRNPs to form a 25S U4atac/U6atac.U5 trimeric 
particle. Comparative analysis of minor and major tri-snRNPs by using 
immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that their protein compositions are 
very similar, if not identical. Not only U5-specific proteins but, surprisingly, 
all tested U4/U6- and major tri-snRNP-specific proteins were detected in the 
minor tri-snRNP complex. Significantly, the major tri-snRNP-specific proteins 
65K and 110K, which are required for integration of the major tri-snRNP into the 
U2-dependent spliceosome, were among those proteins detected in the minor 
tri-snRNP, raising an interesting question as to how the specificity of addition 
of tri-snRNP to the corresponding spliceosome is maintained. Moreover, 
immunodepletion studies demonstrated that the U4/U6-specific 61K protein, which 
is involved in the formation of major tri-snRNPs, is essential for the 
association of the U4atac/U6atac di-snRNP with U5 to form the U4atac/U6atac.U5 
tri-snRNP. Subsequent immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that those 
proteins detected in the minor tri-snRNP complex are also incorporated into 
U12-dependent spliceosomes. This remarkable conservation of polypeptides between 
minor and major spliceosomes, coupled with the absence of significant sequence 
similarity between the functionally analogous snRNAs, supports an evolutionary 
model in which most major and minor spliceosomal proteins, but not snRNAs, are 
derived from a common ancestor.
