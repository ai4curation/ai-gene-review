SpoIIGA is a novel type of membrane-associated aspartic protease that responds 
to a signal from the forespore by cleaving Pro-σ(E) in the mother cell during 
sporulation of Bacillus subtilis. Very little is known about how SpoIIGA 
recognizes Pro-σ(E). By co-expressing proteins in Escherichia coli, it was shown 
that charge reversal substitutions for acidic residues 24 and 25 of Pro-σ(E), 
and for basic residues 245 and 284 of SpoIIGA, impaired cleavage. These results 
are consistent with a model predicting possible electrostatic interactions 
between these residues; however, no charge reversal substitution for residue 245 
or residue 284 of SpoIIGA restored cleavage of Pro-σ(E) with a charge reversal 
substitution for residue 24 or residue 25. Bacillus subtilis SpoIIGA cleaved 
Pro-σ(E) orthologs from Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus halodurans, but not 
from Bacillus cereus. A triple substitution in the pro-sequence of B. cereus 
Pro-σ(E) allowed cleavage by B. subtilis SpoIIGA, indicating that residues 
distal from the cleavage site contribute to substrate specificity. Co-expression 
of SpoIIGA and Pro-σ(E) orthologs in different combinations suggested that B. 
licheniformis SpoIIGA has a relatively narrow substrate specificity as compared 
with B. subtilis SpoIIGA, whereas B. cereus SpoIIGA and B. halodurans SpoIIGA 
appear to have broader substrate specificity.
