Noncanonical forms of DNA like the guanine quadruplex (G4) play important roles 
in regulating transcription and translation through interactions with their 
protein partners. Although potential G4 elements have been identified in or near 
genes from species diverse as bacteria, mammals, and plants, little is known 
about how they might function as cis-regulatory elements or as binding sites for 
trans-acting protein partners. In fact, until now no G4 binding partners have 
been identified in the plant kingdom. Here, we report on the cloning and 
characterization of the first plant-kingdom gene known to encode a G4-binding 
protein, maize (Zea mays L.) nucleoside diphosphate kinase1 (ZmNDPK1). 
Structural characterization by X-ray crystallography reveals that it is a 
homohexamer, akin to other known NDPKs like the human homologue NM23-H2. Further 
probing into the G4-binding properties of both NDPK homologues suggests that 
ZmNDPK1 possesses properties distinct from that of NM23-H2, which is known to 
interact with a G-rich sequence element upstream of the c-myc gene and, in doing 
so, modulate its expression. Indeed, ZmNDPK1 binds the folded G4 with low 
nanomolar affinity but corresponding unfolded G-rich DNA more weakly, whereas 
NM23-H2 binds both folded and unfolded G4 with low nanomolar affinities; 
nonetheless, both homologues appear to stabilize folded DNAs whether they were 
prefolded or not. We also demonstrate that the G4-binding activity of ZmNDPK1 is 
independent of nucleotide binding and kinase activity, suggesting that the 
G4-binding region and the enzyme active sites are separate. Together, these 
findings establish a broad evolutionary conservation of some NDPKs as G4-DNA 
binding enzymes, but with potentially distinct biochemical properties that may 
reflect divergent evolution or species-specific deployment of these elements in 
gene regulatory processes.
