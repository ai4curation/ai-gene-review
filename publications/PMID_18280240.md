Cells undergo apoptosis upon exposure to severe DNA damage stress. Under this 
condition, p73 is phosphorylated and activated by c-Abl. The transcription 
coactivator Yap1 binds p73 to generate a complex that escapes p73 proteasomal 
degradation and recruits p300 to support transcription of proapoptotic genes. 
However, the mechanism of selective activation of proapoptotic genes by Yap1 
remained unclear. In this study, we show that c-Abl directly phosphorylates Yap1 
at position Y357 in response to DNA damage. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Yap1 is a 
more stable protein that displays higher affinity to p73 and selectively 
coactivates p73 proapoptotic target genes. Furthermore, we show that Yap1 
switches between p73-mediated proapoptotic and growth arrest target genes based 
on its phosphorylation state. Thus, our data demonstrate that modification of a 
transcription coactivator, namely the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Yap1 
by c-Abl, influences the specificity of target gene activation.
