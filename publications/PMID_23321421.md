Phytochromes (phys) encompass a diverse collection of biliproteins that enable 
cellular light perception by photoconverting between a red-light-absorbing 
ground state (Pr) and a far-red light-absorbing active state (Pfr). Based on the 
central role of plant phys in controlling numerous agriculturally important 
processes, their rational redesign offers great promise toward accelerating crop 
improvement. Employing as templates the available three-dimensional models of 
the photosensory module within bacterial phys, we report here our initial

Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) phyB, the dominant isoform in light-grown 
plants, as the example. A collection of phyB mutants was generated affecting the 
bilin-binding pocket that altered photochemistry, thermal stability, and/or 
nuclear localization patterns, some of which also impacted phenotypic outputs. 
Of particular interest are the Y361F substitution, which created Arabidopsis 
plants with greatly enhanced light sensitivity, mutants variably altered in 
Pfr-to-Pr thermal reversion and nuclear aggregation, and the D307A substitution, 
which failed to photoconvert from Pr to Pfr and display light-induced nuclear 
aggregation but retained some biological activity and accelerated turnover in 
red light. Taken together, this collection provides variants potentially useful 
to agriculture as well as new tools to better understand the molecular

Abstract

Phytochromes ( phys ) encompass a diverse collection of biliproteins that enable cellular light perception by photoconverting between a red-light-absorbing ground state (Pr) and a far-red light-absorbing active state (Pfr). Based on the central role of plant phys in controlling numerous agriculturally important processes, their rational redesign offers great promise toward accelerating crop improvement. Employing as templates the available three-dimensional models of the photosensory module within bacterial phys , we report here our initial attempt to apply structure-guided mutagenesis to phy engineering using Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) phyB, the dominant isoform in light-grown plants, as the example. A collection of phyB mutants was generated affecting the bilin-binding pocket that altered photochemistry, thermal stability, and/or nuclear localization patterns, some of which also impacted phenotypic outputs. Of particular interest are the Y361F substitution, which created Arabidopsis plants with greatly enhanced light sensitivity, mutants variably altered in Pfr-to-Pr thermal reversion and nuclear aggregation, and the D307A substitution, which failed to photoconvert from Pr to Pfr and display light-induced nuclear aggregation but retained some biological activity and accelerated turnover in red light. Taken together, this collection provides variants potentially useful to agriculture as well as new tools to better understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning phy signaling.

DISCUSSION

Given the central importance of phys in regulating plant photomorphogenesis, it has long been proposed that their rational redesign could offer new strategies to better tailor crops to fit specific agricultural environments, including, for example, the improvement of seed germination, attenuation of the SAR , modification of flowering time, and delayed senescence ( Ballaré et al., 1994 ; Izaguirre et al., 2006 ). While sufficiently resolved three-dimensional structures of plant phys await, we demonstrate here that the bacterial models provide reasonable surrogates with which to predictably modify the photobehavioral properties of the plant versions via structure-guided mutagenesis. For the most part, the photochemical consequences of the panel of five mutants tested here within the PSM of Arabidopsis phyB agreed well with the responses of comparable mutants generated with various eubacterial and cyanobacterial relatives. These effects include the essential role for the Asp within the invariant DIP motif during Pr→Pfr photoconversion ( Hahn et al., 2006 ; von Stetten et al., 2007 ; Wagner et al., 2008 ) and the importance of the pair of Arg residues that tether the B- and C-ring propionate side chains to Pfr stability ( Hahn et al., 2006 ; Cornilescu et al., 2008 ; Wagner et al., 2008 ; Ulijasz et al., 2010 ).

The only surprise was the R582A mutation, which might have compromised signaling by eliminating a predicted salt bridge between the PHY domain hairpin and Asp-307 in the GAF domain that also contacts the bilin and the pyrrole water ( Fig. 1B ). While substitution of Arg-582 with an Ala did not impact photochemistry or substantially alter the ability of the photoreceptor to drive various phenotypic processes directed by phyB, it strongly stabilized the Pfr conformer once formed by slowing thermal reversion. Structural comparisons of the hairpin among the available three-dimensional structures for bacterial PSMs showed that this unique protrusion, while conserved in principle, is quite varied in terms of its secondary structure and in the specific residues that directly participate in the PHY- GAF domain interaction ( Essen et al., 2008 ; Yang et al., 2008 ; Bellini and Papiz, 2012 ; E.S. Burgie and R.D. Vierstra, unpublished data). Consequently, it is possible that the hairpin- GAF contact in phyB R582A retained its critical role in plant phy signal transmission by using an ensemble of residues besides Arg-582 to support this connection. One alternative residue in Arabidopsis phyB might be Gly-564, which sits within a highly conserved WGG patch predicted from bacterial structures to be within the stretch of the PHY domain hairpin that interfaces with the GAF domain ( Essen et al., 2008 ). Its importance was revealed by a Glu substitution found by forward genetics of the phyB-401 allele that generates a strongly hyperactive signaling variant (approximately 1,000-fold; Kretsch et al., 2000 ; Ádám et al., 2011 ). Clearly, appreciating the specific role(s) of Arg-582 and Gly-564 to phyB signaling will require the three-dimensional structure of phyB PSM .

In addition to being essential for phyB photochemistry, we confirmed that Asp-307 in phyB is also critical for signal transmission. Spectroscopic studies showed that the D307A variant assembles with PΦB to generate a normal Pr conformer but that photoconversion to Pfr by R is stalled, resulting in the accumulation of a bleached R -absorbing intermediate. Surprisingly, this bleached species appears still capable of stimulating phyB-dependent processes, including the suppression of hypocotyl elongation at very high fluence rates of R and the rescue of the early-flowering phenotype of phyB-9 plants in SD , suggesting that it resembles Pfr enough to permit modest signaling. A marginal phenotypic activity for phyA harboring the comparable D273A mutation is also implied by its ability to suppress hypocotyl elongation in high-fluence-rate FR . This “Pfr-like” bleached species of phyB D307A also retains its rapid degradation in continuous R , albeit at a reduced rate, implying that photoconversion all the way to Pfr is not a prerequisite to the light-accelerated turnover of phyB. Surprisingly, phyB D307A also failed to accumulate nuclear bodies. Although we cannot rule out the formation of smaller, poorly detectable aggregates, this disconnection suggests that a fully photoconverted Pfr structure is essential for nuclear aggregation and that the large bodies containing phyB are not prerequisites for phyB ubiquitylation and subsequent breakdown. Together with prior studies on the constitutively active phyB Y276H allele ( Su and Lagarias, 2007 ; Hu et al., 2009 ), it now appears possible to create mutant phys that are capable of stimulating downstream signaling pathways even without photoconversion to the normal Pfr state. An intriguing scenario is that such mutations structurally uncouple chromophore movements from the rest of the PSM and/or the OPM , thus allowing the PSM / OPM to assume the “activated” conformation required for signal transmission and/or breakdown independent of phototransformation.

The most striking mutation analyzed here is Y361F, which generates a phyB variant with enhanced light signal transmission. Unlike the previously described Y276H substitution, which appears to represent a gain-of-function mutation that permits phyB signaling even without light ( Su and Lagarias, 2007 ; Hu et al., 2009 ), the effect(s) of Y361F are more subtle by generating a hyperactive photoreceptor that still requires light for activation. Why phyB Y361F is hyperactive is unclear; it could reflect a greater affinity of the Pfr form for downstream components (e.g. PIFs; Al-Sady et al., 2006 ), an increase in its kinase activity if plant phys do indeed work as protein kinases ( Yeh and Lagarias, 1998 ; Vierstra and Zhang, 2011 ), and/or an ability to retain signaling activity even upon conversion back to Pr.

As such, the phyB Y361F variant might offer a more practical approach to accentuate phyB-mediated responses in an agricultural setting with fewer side effects. Its replacement of wild-type phyB increased dramatically the sensitivity of hypocotyls to R , generated seeds with a stronger germination response in white light, and for seedlings further accentuated the EOD - FR response and leaf hyponasty in SD but had little impact on flowering time. Given that the phyB-mediated response of hypocotyls to R and EOD - FR and leaf epinasty in low light are connected to the SAR ( Franklin and Quail, 2010 ), we speculate that the increased signaling by phyB Y361F attenuates the SAR by enabling the small amounts of Pfr generated by low-fluence R , or the residual Pfr remaining after EOD - FR (or presumably in high FR / R environments), to more effectively promote normal photomophogenesis. A similar repression of SAR was previously observed for transgenic tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) overexpressing wild-type phyA, including the attenuation of stem elongation in white light, delayed leaf senescence, and repression of SAR elicited by FR -rich light environments or high plant densities ( McCormac et al., 1991 ; Ballaré et al., 1994 ; Izaguirre et al., 2006 ).

It is interesting that the comparable Tyr-to-Phe mutation in phyA (Y327F) did not appear to generate a hyperactive variant, potentially in agreement with the distinct signaling mechanism(s) underpinning these phy isoforms and the unique responses they control ( Franklin and Quail, 2010 ). Such a distinction between phyA and phyB was easily seen here by the steeper fluence rate response curves for hypocotyl elongation in FR (phyA driven) versus those in R (phyB driven), indicating that Arabidopsis is exquisitely sensitive to relatively low levels of phyA as Pfr but less so for phyB as Pfr. Regardless of the mechanism(s), such differential responses illustrate the potential of using mutants in specific phy isoforms to drive individual aspects of photomorphogenesis. Thus, by introducing specific structure-guided mutations into the set of phys present in the target species, it might be possible to create next-generation crops better designed to fit their particular cultivation schemes. In particular, the application of hyperactive phyB variants such as Y361F described here and the G564E( phyB-401 ) variant reported previously ( Kretsch et al., 2000 ; Ádám et al., 2011 ) might be an attractive approach to minimize the complications of SAR for crops that are planted at high density or to maintain the dwarf stature of ornamental species exposed to low-light environments.

Similar to bacterial phys , we found that altering the GAF domain pocket surrounding the bilin can profoundly alter the thermal reversion of Arabidopsis phyB, with the Y361F, R352A, and R582A mutations strongly stabilizing the Pfr conformer and the R322A mutation destabilizing it. However, with the exception of Y361F, none of these mutations appeared to dramatically enhance or diminish phyB-mediated signaling under high fluence rates of R or in continuous or SD white light, implying that thermal reversion is insignificant to phyB when signaling is robust. However, a differential effect on the control of hypocotyl elongation at very-low-fluence-rate R was possible for PHYB R582A and PHYB R352A seedlings, suggesting that thermal reversion impacts phyB action when signaling is more limited. In addition, none of these mutants substantially affected phyB turnover. Consequently, at least under the high and continuous R fluence rates used here, Pfr thermal reversion does not appear to compete well with Pfr turnover.

Interestingly, we found that this collection of reversion mutants strongly affected nuclear aggregation in an inverse manner. Whereas the phyB R322A mutant, which reverts faster than phyB WT , appeared to show dampened aggregation, the phyB Y361F and phyB R582A mutants, which revert much slower, showed more robust aggregation that was even detected at low fluence rates of R. This inverse relationship is also supported by the responses of the phyB G564E mutant, which displays almost no thermal reversion both in vitro and in planta but has a robust aggregation response even in low R ( Ádám et al., 2011 ).

Collectively, the effects of this panel of thermal reversion mutants support the hypothesis that such bodies serve as reservoirs of photoactivated phyB and possibly other isoforms ( Rausenberger et al., 2010 ). Based on the results by Ádám et al. (2011) and those presented here, one can imagine that phyB as Pfr aggregates into these bodies upon nuclear import, but as the pool slowly reverts back to Pr in darkness or under dim R , the bodies disaggregate. Those phyB mutants that revert faster would require higher fluence rates of R to maintain the aggregated pool (phyB R322A ), while those that revert more slowly would maintain the aggregated pool even at low fluence rates (phyB Y361F , phyB R582A , and phyB G564E mutants). It has also been proposed that these nuclear bodies are the concentrated sites for Pfr ubiquitylation and/or degradation. Using the phyB G564E mutant along with the collection described here, it should now be possible to test this idea via detailed kinetic comparisons of Pfr turnover and nuclear body formation under a range of continuous and pulsed R and FR fluence rates.
