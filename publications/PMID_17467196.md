Ran-binding protein in microtubule organising centre (RanBPM) was originally 
isolated as a protein that binds to the small GTPase Ran. Recently our group and 
other groups reported that RanBPM was associated with several proteins and 
composed a large protein complex. Here, we used tandem MS with an antibody 
against RanBPM to purify this complex from a soluble extract of HEK293 cells: we 
identified Muskelin, p48EMLP, p44CTLH, and the novel armadillo-repeat proteins 
ARMC8alpha and ARMC8beta as components. In RanBPM, Muskelin, p48EMLP, and 
p44CTLH we found LisH/CTLH motifs, which are present in proteins involved in 
microtubule dynamics, cell migration, nucleokinesis, and chromosome segregation. 
We renamed the 20S large protein complex the CTLH complex. The N-terminal 364 
amino acids of ARMC8alpha and ARMC8beta were completely conserved, suggesting 
that these proteins are probably alternatively spliced products from the same 
gene. We confirmed the in vivo association of each component by 
co-immunoprecipitation assays with Cos-7 cells in which these components were 
exogenously overexpressed. A pull-down assay with bacterially-expressed Twa1 
revealed binding of each in vitro-translated component to Twa1. Finally, we 
confirmed the cellular localization of these proteins. Taken together, our 
results reveal that RanBPM, ARMC8alpha, ARMC8beta, Muskelin, p48EMLP, and 
p44CTLH form complexes in cells.
