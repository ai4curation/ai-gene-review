We describe the discovery of a heterohexameric chaperone protein, prefoldin, 
based on its ability to capture unfolded actin. Prefoldin binds specifically to 
cytosolic chaperonin (c-cpn) and transfers target proteins to it. Deletion of 
the gene encoding a prefoldin subunit in S. cerevisiae results in a phenotype 
similar to those found when c-cpn is mutated, namely impaired functions of the 
actin and tubulin-based cytoskeleton. Consistent with prefoldin having a general 
role in chaperonin-mediated folding, we identify homologs in archaea, which have 
a class II chaperonin but contain neither actin nor tubulin. We show that by 
directing target proteins to chaperonin, prefoldin promotes folding in an 
environment in which there are many competing pathways for nonnative proteins.
