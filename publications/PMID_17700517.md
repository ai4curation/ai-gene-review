Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a member of the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase kinase kinase family, plays a critical role in mediating 
apoptosis signals initiated by a variety of death stimuli such as hydrogen 
peroxide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Owing to its critical role in inducing 
apoptosis, the activity of ASK1 is tightly regulated by various mechanisms such 
as post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. Here we 
describe the identification of G(1) to S phase transition protein 1 (GSPT1), 
which is associated with protein translation, as a regulator of ASK1. GSPT1 
interacts with ASK1 and enhances ASK1-induced apoptotic activity through the 
activation of caspase-3. In vitro kinase assay data show that GSPT1 enhances 
ASK1 autophosphorylation and its kinase activity. Cell cycle-dependent GSPT1 
induction and small interfering RNA analyses show that ASK1 autophosphorylation 
is dependent on the expression level of endogenous GSPT1 in cells. GSPT1 
inhibits the binding of ASK1 to the 14-3-3 protein, an ASK1 inhibitor, while 
GSPT1 has no effect on the interaction between ASK1 and TRAF2, a 
C-terminal-binding activator of ASK1. Thus, our results reveal a novel role of 
GSPT1 in the regulation of ASK1-mediated apoptosis.
