Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common cause of 
inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). The protein is large and complex, but 
pathogenic mutations cluster in a region containing GTPase and kinase domains. 
LRRK2 can autophosphorylate in vitro within a dimer pair, although the 
significance of this reaction is unclear. Here, we mapped the sites of 
autophosphorylation within LRRK2 and found several potential phosphorylation 
sites within the GTPase domain. Using mass spectrometry, we found that Thr1343 
is phosphorylated and, using kinase dead versions of LRRK2, show that this is an 
autophosphorylation site. However, we also find evidence for additional sites in 
the GTPase domain and in other regions of the protein suggesting that there may 
be multiple autophosphorylation sites within LRRK2. These data suggest that the 
kinase and GTPase activities of LRRK2 may exhibit complex autoregulatory 
interdependence.
