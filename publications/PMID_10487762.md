Post-translational acetylation of histone H4 N-terminal tail in chromatin has 
been associated with several nuclear processes including transcription. We 
report the purification and characterization of a native multisubunit complex 
(NuA4) from yeast that acetylates nucleosomal histone H4. NuA4 has an apparent 
molecular mass of 1.3 MDa. All four conserved lysines of histone H4 can be 
acetylated by NuA4. We have identified the catalytic subunit of the complex as 
the product of ESA1, an essential gene required for cell cycle progression in 
yeast. Antibodies against Esa1p specifically immunoprecipitate NuA4 activity 
whereas the complex purified from a temperature-sensitive esa1 mutant loses its 
acetyltransferase activity at the restrictive temperature. Additionally, we have 
identified another subunit of the complex as the product of TRA1, an ATM-related 
essential gene homologous to human TRRAP, an essential cofactor for c-Myc- and 
E2F-mediated oncogenic transformation. Finally, the ability of NuA4 to stimulate 
GAL4-VP16-driven transcription from chromatin templates in vitro is also lost in 
the temperature-sensitive esa1 mutant. The function of the essential Esa1 
protein as the HAT subunit of NuA4 and the presence of Tra1p, a putative 
transcription activator-interacting subunit, supports an essential link between 
nuclear H4 acetylation, transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control.
