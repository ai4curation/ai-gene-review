We show that the budding yeast protein Chl1p, required for sister-chromatid 
cohesion, also modulates transcriptional silencing at HMR and telomeres. The 
absence of this protein results in increased silencing at HMR and, conversely, 
in decreased silencing at the telomere. The regulation of silencing by Chl1p at 
these two loci is dependent on the presence of Sir proteins. Chl1p also acts 
synergistically with Sir2p to suppress rDNA recombination. In the absence of 
this protein, yeast cells exhibit reduced life span and hypersensitivity to heat 
stress. These observations suggest a role of Chl1p in regulating chromatin 
structure.
