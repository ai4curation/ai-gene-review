A histidine-tagged form of the recently discovered molecular chaperone, 70-kDa 
heat-shock cognate (Hsc70)-interacting protein (Hip), has been expressed in 
Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. This protein remains soluble 
when expressed in E. coli. Several important properties of this chaperone have 
been investigated. HPLC size-exclusion chromatography indicates that the 
chaperone forms a tetramer similar to what has been reported for the native 
protein from rat liver cytosol. The recombinant form of Hip did not catalyze the 
hydrolysis of ATP and ATP analogs, although fluorescence measurements indicated 
that the chaperone recognizes anthraniloyl-dATP, anthraniloyl-ADP, and 
2'-O-trinitrophenyl-ATP. The role of Hip as a molecular chaperone has been 
confirmed by its ability to strongly bind to the reduced, carboxymethylated form 
of alpha-lactalbumin. This interaction is specific for non-native domains since 
native alpha-lactalbumin fails to interact with Hip. Fluorescence-anisotropy 
measurements indicate that reduced, carboxymethylated lactalbumin binds Hip with 
a Kd of 5 microM. Although Hip appears to be able to bind nucleotides and 
non-native proteins, it is unable to facilitate the refolding of two denatured 
proteins, E. coli alkaline phosphatase and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase. 
Hip inhibited the refolding of alkaline phosphatase and malic dehydrogenase. 
Inhibition occurred at near stoichiometric levels of Hip and could not be 
reversed by the addition of ATP. These results suggest that Hip may regulate the 
function of the Hsp70 molecular chaperone complex in vivo and play a critical 
role in protein folding in the eukaryotic cytoplasm.
