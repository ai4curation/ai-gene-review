Aging is a well regulated biological process involving oxidative stress and 
macromolecular damages. Three main pathways have been shown to influence 
lifespan, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway, the silent regulator 
pathway, and the target of rapamycin pathway. Among many proteins influencing 
lifespan, two transcription factors, FOXO and the heat shock factor, have been 
shown to be involved in the aging process and in small heat shock proteins 
(sHsps) expression following stress and during lifespan. We have recently shown 
that overexpressing the mitochondrial Hsp22 increases Drosophila melanogaster 
lifespan by 32% and resistance to oxidative stress. Here we show that flies that 
are not expressing this mitochondrial small Hsp22 have a 40% decrease in 
lifespan. These flies die faster than their matched control and display a 
decrease of 30% in locomotor activity compared with controls. The absence of 
Hsp22 also sensitizes flies to mild stress. These data support a key role of 
sHsps in aging and underline the importance of mitochondrial sHsps in this 
process.
