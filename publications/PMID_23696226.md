Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is expressed 
on activated natural killer (NK) cells wherein it inhibits lysis of 
CEACAM1-bearing tumor cell lines. The mechanism for this is unknown. Here, we 
show that interleukin-2-induced expression of CEACAM1 on both mouse and primary 
human NK cells impairs the ability of NK gene complex group 2 member D (NKG2D) 
to stimulate cytolysis of CEACAM1-bearing cells. This process requires the 
expression of CEACAM1 on the NK cells and on the tumor cells, which is 
consistent with the involvement of trans-homophilic interactions between 
CEACAM1. Mechanistically, co-engagement of NKG2D and CEACAM1 results in a 
biochemical association between these two surface receptors and the recruitment 
of Src homology phosphatase 1 by CEACAM1 that leads to dephosphorylation of the 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 and blockade of downstream signaling 
that is associated with the initiation of cytolysis. Thus, CEACAM1 on activated 
NK cells functions as an inhibitory receptor for NKG2D-mediated cytolysis, which 
has important implications for understanding the means by which CEACAM1 
expression adversely affects tumor immunity.
