von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (NF1) is a common inherited human 
disease. The events leading to patient symptoms from inheritance of a defective 
NF1 gene are unknown. Since knowledge of the distribution of the normal NF1 gene 
product should improve understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, we 
raised antibodies against peptides coded by portions of the recently cloned 
human NF1 cDNA. These antibodies specifically recognize a 220 kd protein 
(neurofibromin) in both human and rat spinal cord. Neurofibromin is most 
abundant in the nervous system. Immunostaining of tissue sections indicates that 
neurons, oligodendrocytes, and nonmyelinating Schwann cells contain 
neurofibromin while astrocytes and myelinating Schwann cells do not. These 
results suggest a function for neurofibromin in the normal nervous system. Some 
NF1 disease manifestations, such as Schwann cell tumors and learning 
disabilities, may result from abnormalities in the cells that express 
neurofibromin.
