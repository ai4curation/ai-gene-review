Huntington's disease (HD) occurs when the widely expressed protein huntingtin 
contains an expanded glutamine repeat. The selective degeneration and neuronal 
morphologic abnormalities of HD may involve interactions with proteins that bind 
to huntingtin, such as HAP1. The biological significance of this interaction is 
unclear because neither HAP1 nor huntingtin have significant homology to known 
proteins. Therefore, we sought to identify HAP1-binding proteins. Using the 
yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a rat cDNA encoding part of a protein that 
interacts with HAP1, and we confirmed the specificity of this interaction using 
an in vitro protein-binding assay. We called the protein Duo because it is 
closely related to the human protein Trio but is shorter. Northern blot analysis 
indicates brain-specific expression of Duo. Human Duo contains a guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain that is likely to be rac1-specific, a 
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and spectrin-like repeat units. These data 
support the hypothesis that huntingtin is involved in vesicle trafficking and 
cytoskeletal functions, and raise the possibility of a role for huntingtin in 
the regulation of a ras-related signaling pathway.
