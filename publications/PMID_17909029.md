ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases can transit to nuclei in tumor cells, where they 
have been shown to regulate gene expression as components of transcriptional 
complexes. Quantitative analysis of a human bladder cancer tissue microarray 
identified nuclear epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in tumor cells and 
also showed an increased frequency of this histologic feature in cancer relative 
to normal tissues. This observation suggests a potential role for nuclear EGFR 
in bladder cancer. We confirmed that EGFR could be induced to transit to nuclei 
in cultured human bladder cancer cells in response to the urothelial cell growth 
factor and EGFR ligand heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). Mass 
spectrometric analysis of EGFR immune complexes from a transitional carcinoma 
cell line (TCCSUP) identified the phosphoinositide kinase, PIKfyve, as a 
potential component of the EGFR trafficking mechanism. RNA silencing indicated 
that PIKfyve is a mediator of HB-EGF-stimulated EGFR nuclear trafficking, EGFR 
binding to the cyclin D1 promoter, and cell cycle progression. These results 
identify a novel mediator of the EGFR transcription function and further suggest 
that nuclear EGFR and the lipid kinase PIKfyve may play a role in bladder 
oncogenesis.

ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases can transit to nuclei in tumor cells, where they have been shown to regulate gene expression as components of transcriptional complexes. Quantitative analysis of a human bladder cancer tissue microarray identified nuclear EGFR in tumor cells and also showed an increased frequency of this histologic feature in cancer relative to normal tissues. This observation suggests a potential role for nuclear EGFR in bladder cancer. We confirmed that EGFR could be induced to transit to nuclei in cultured human bladder cancer cells in response to the urothelial cell growth factor and EGFR ligand, HB-EGF. Mass spectrometric analysis of EGFR immune complexes from a transitional carcinoma cell line (TCCSUP) identified the phosphoinositide kinase, PIKfyve, as a potential component of the EGFR trafficking mechanism. RNA silencing indicated that PIKfyve is a mediator of HB-EGF-stimulated EGFR nuclear trafficking, EGFR binding to the cyclin D1 promoter, and cell cycle progression. These results identify a novel mediator of the EGFR transcription function and further suggest that nuclear EGFR and the lipid kinase PIKfyve may play a role in bladder oncogenesis.

Introduction

The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1) is a signaling protein that plays a prominent role in the maintenance of epithelial tissues and in malignant transformation at many organ sites ( 1 ), with the result that the EGFR is now a major focus of targeted pharmacotherapy ( 2 ). Pharmacologic inhibitors of the EGFR are in clinical use for several malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colon cancer, often in combination with other agents ( 3 ). Increased expression of the EGFR is associated with disease progression in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder and is an independent predictor of tumor stage and disease-specific mortality in this disease ( 4 , 5 ). Activation of the EGFR occurs in response to binding of the extracellular domain by one or more soluble proteins containing an EGF-like motif. Expression of transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), an EGFR ligand, was shown to correlate with recurrence of superficial bladder cancer ( 6 ). Another EGFR ligand, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), is an autocrine urothelial cell mitogen that is synthesized normally by bladder urothelium and smooth muscle cells ( 7 , 8 ). HB-EGF is upregulated in bladder smooth muscle cells in vivo in response to hypertrophic stimuli ( 9 ), suggesting a physiologic role for HB-EGF/EGFR signaling in the urinary tract.

Several growth factors and growth factor receptors have been reported to localize to non-canonical subcellular compartments ( 10 – 12 ). FGF-2 accumulating in the nucleus was implicated in regulation of tumor cell survival and metastatic potential in vivo ( 13 , 14 ). The EGF-like growth factors, HB-EGF ( 15 , 16 ), TGF-α and amphiregulin, have all been reported to accumulate in nuclei in several cell types. The HB-EGF precursor was reported by our laboratory to localize to tumor cell nuclei in human TCC in a manner that positively correlated with disease progression ( 15 ). This result was recently confirmed independently by another group in a larger bladder cancer series ( 5 ). Nuclear-localized HB-EGF in TCC was also shown to be mobilized by oxidative stress into an autocrine loop involving transport of the growth factor from the nucleus to the cell surface, followed by regulated ligand shedding and EGFR activation ( 16 ).

EGFR and related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4, have similarly been found in nuclei, where these proteins have been shown to perform roles distinct from their function as plasma membrane signal transducers ( 10 , 17 – 20 ). This non-canonical signaling function of RTKs is still poorly understood. Nuclear EGFR has been detected in hepatocytes in regenerating liver ( 21 ) and nuclear ErbB4 was recently identified as a component of transcription complexes involved in astrocyte differentiation in the mouse ( 22 ). Expression levels of nuclear EGFR were recently reported to correlate with the cell proliferation markers, cyclin D1 and Ki-67, in a large breast cancer series ( 23 ), in which the extent of localization of EGFR to tumor cell nuclei was inversely correlated with patient survival. EGFR has been demonstrated to contain a functional nuclear localization sequence within the juxtamembrane region ( 24 ) and to act as a transcriptional co-activator by participating in the formation of a transcription complex at the cyclin D1 ( 17 ) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) promoters ( 18 ), resulting in the activation of gene expression from these regulatory domains.

When ErbB receptors translocate to nuclei they likely associate with accessory proteins specialized for receptor transit, stability, or assembly into functional chromatin complexes. In its nuclear regulatory role, ErbB4 has been shown to complex with the MAP3K-interacting protein TAB2 and the corepressor N-CoR ( 22 , 25 ). However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of EGFR/ErbB receptor trafficking to nuclei, and the manner in which RTKs are stabilized and turned over in nuclei, are still poorly understood. To date, a direct mediator of EGFR nuclear trafficking from the cytosol to the nucleus has not been identified.

In this study, we present evidence for a role for nuclear EGFR in human bladder cancer by providing the first identification of nuclear EGFR in patient-derived tumor tissues. In addition, we have applied a mass spectrometric approach toward analysis of EGFR translocation complexes in TCC cells. Here we report the identification of the lipid kinase PIKfyve as a novel regulator of EGFR transit to nuclei.

Discussion

In this study we provide the first evidence from human tissue that EGFR/HER1 accumulates in tumor cell nuclei in TCC and we provide evidence that nuclear EGFR plays a role in bladder cancer cell proliferation by identifying a novel mediator of the EGFR nuclear trafficking mechanism and showing that this protein is involved in cell cycle progression. Quantitative analysis of EGFR localization patterns in a human bladder cancer TMA verified the presence of EGFR in tumor cell nuclei and identified an apparently significant quantitative increase in nuclear EGFR associated with TCC in comparison to benign bladder tissue. Further analysis is necessary to assess the possibility that nuclear EGFR is an independent prognostic indicator capable of providing information of clinical value. At least one previous study that confirmed the presence of nuclear HB-EGF in TCC specimens, originally reported by our group ( 15 , 16 ), did not find significant nuclear EGFR ( 5 ). Although in our study we did find nuclear EGFR in bladder cancer tissues using conventional immunohistochemical staining, our study benefited from the use of AQUA, a highly sensitive and quantitative system for localizing immunoreactive signals to subcellular compartments in tissue. Nuclear EGFR has been reported in human breast cancers and in normal tissues, including regenerating liver ( 21 ).

We also found that nuclear EGFR could be demonstrated in human bladder cancer cells in culture. We demonstrated that receptor activation by the cognate EGFR ligand, HB-EGF, stimulates translocation of full-length EGFR to the nucleus in TCCSUP bladder cancer cells, and that this results in binding of the receptor to chromatin within 30 min. The kinetics of nuclear transit we observed are consistent with the kinetics reported by other groups for nuclear translocation of the EGFR ( 17 , 18 ). Notably, the rapid translocation of EGFR appears distinct from the slower translocation process seen with ErbB4, where proteolytic cleavage of the intracellular domain of the receptor precedes translocation of the cleaved fragment to active chromatin. In the present study we also identified the lipid kinase, PIKfyve, as a component of an EGFR cytosolic trafficking complex. Down-regulation of PIKfyve by RNA interference inhibited EGFR trafficking to nuclei, association of the receptor with the endogenous cyclin D1 promoter and cell cycle progression in TCCSUP cells. This is the first report to link nuclear EGFR with bladder cancer and the first to identify PIKfyve as a mediator of EGFR intracellular trafficking to the nucleus in any cell type.

Ligand activation of the EGFR promotes numerous downstream signal transduction processes, leading to cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, aspects of development, and migration ( 42 , 43 ). Modulation of receptor activity through endocytosis, degradation and vesicular trafficking regulates the downstream targets of EGFR. The physiologic roles for nuclear trafficking of RTKs, including EGFR, FGFR, and other receptor families are currently under intense scrutiny ( 10 , 13 , 17 , 44 – 46 ). Vesicular and other trafficking devices, such as involvement of the exportin CRM1, are likely to be important elements of the regulatory mechanics of nuclear-localized RTKs ( 47 – 49 ). EGFR has been shown to co-localize and interact with the nuclear pore protein Nup358 as well as the nuclear importing cofactors importins α1/β1 ( 49 ). Nuclear EGFR also interacts with signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3), leading to transcriptional activation of iNOS ( 18 ). Current evidence suggests that RTKs from several protein families employ similar strategies for transit to nuclei. Despite some information about likely candidates for co-factors in the translocation mechanism, nothing has been published previously about the mechanism whereby the ligand-activated EGFR in transit to the nucleus navigates the cytosolic vesicular compartments.

Our finding that PIKfyve is a facilitator of EGFR nuclear trafficking has shed light on this question. PIKfyve is the mammalian ortholog of the yeast protein, Fab1p. The principal in vivo activity of both enzymes is the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,5) bisphosphate from phosphatidylinositol (3)-monophosphate ( 35 , 36 ). PIKfyve has been implicated in vesicular trafficking in mammalian cells and direct comparisons between the yeast and mammalian forms of the protein indicate that their predominant role appears to be conserved across a great evolutionary distance ( 39 – 41 , 50 ). Perturbations in the PIKfyve function by protein silencing or expression of a dominant-negative, kinase-deficient form in human cells did not significantly affect internalization, recycling or degradative sorting of the EGFR ( 40 , 50 ). However, PIKfyve suppression did result in defective exit from early endosomes and trafficking between the early endosomal compartment and the trans-Golgi network ( 40 , 41 , 50 ). Our data are consistent with these findings and further implicate PIKfyve in the transport of EGFR from the cell surface through the cytoplasmic vesicular space to the nucleus. We generated multiple lines of evidence that support this conclusion. Endogenous PIKfyve co-precipitated with EGFR from TCCSUP cytosolic fractions, indicating that the two proteins are associated within a cytosolic multi-protein complex. siRNA knock-down of PIKfyve and/or enforced expression of the dominant-negative mutant, PIKfyve K1831E inhibited multiple endpoints associated with EGFR nuclear trafficking, including progression through the cell cycle in response to EGFR activation. These data indicate that PIKfyve kinase activity is a requisite process for relocation of surface EGFR to the nucleus. In addition, our data demonstrate that intracellular signaling pathways including PI3-kinase and Erk/MAPK are also involved in the HB-EGF-stimulated nuclear localization of EGFR. It remains to be elucidated how PIKfyve lipid products are related to these pathways in the context of EGFR nuclear transit.

In summary, we have identified a novel mediator of nuclear shuttling of the EGFR and have provided a new pathologic context for this phenomenon. Because EGFR can be over-expressed and is believed to be functionally involved in some bladder cancers ( 4 – 6 ), our findings indicate that EGFR likely plays a role in both conventional cell signaling initiated from the plasma membrane and also by direct intervention, at the level of chromatin, in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of tumor cell proliferation in this disease. Because nuclear HB-EGF can be mobilized into an autocrine loop leading to EGFR activation ( 16 ), our conclusions are consistent with those of Kramer et al. with respect to the point that disease progression in TCC may be related to the mode of HB-EGF signaling ( 5 ). We propose a model in which PIKfyve facilitates transit of EGFR from the cytosolic vesicular compartments to the nucleus, where EGFR rapidly and reversibly associates with chromatin to regulate gene expression. This study provides the first evidence of functional involvement of PIKfyve in mechanisms of TCC oncogenesis, suggesting that targeting this lipid kinase may be fruitful as a novel therapeutic strategy in circumstances where changes in EGFR or HB-EGF expression or subcellular localization are evident histologically.
