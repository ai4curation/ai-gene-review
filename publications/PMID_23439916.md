Heat acclimation improves the tolerance of organisms to severe heat stress. Our 
previous work showed that in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the "memory" of 
heat acclimation treatment decayed faster in the absence of the 
heat-stress-associated 32-kD protein HSA32, a heat-induced protein predominantly 
found in plants. The HSA32 null mutant attains normal short-term acquired 
thermotolerance but is defective in long-term acquired thermotolerance. To 
further explore this phenomenon, we isolated Arabidopsis defective in long-term 
acquired thermotolerance (dlt) mutants using a forward genetic screen. Two 
recessive missense alleles, dlt1-1 and dlt1-2, encode the molecular chaperone 
heat shock protein101 (HSP101). Results of immunoblot analyses suggest that 
HSP101 enhances the translation of HSA32 during recovery after heat treatment, 
and in turn, HSA32 retards the decay of HSP101. The dlt1-1 mutation has little 
effect on HSP101 chaperone activity and thermotolerance function but compromises 
the regulation of HSA32. In contrast, dlt1-2 impairs the chaperone activity and 
thermotolerance function of HSP101 but not the regulation of HSA32. These 
results suggest that HSP101 has a dual function, which could be decoupled by the 
mutations. Pulse-chase analysis showed that HSP101 degraded faster in the 
absence of HSA32. The autophagic proteolysis inhibitor E-64d, but not the 
proteasome inhibitor MG132, inhibited the degradation of HSP101. Ectopic 
expression of HSA32 confirmed its effect on the decay of HSP101 at the 
posttranscriptional level and showed that HSA32 was not sufficient to confer 
long-term acquired thermotolerance when the HSP101 level was low. Taken 
together, we propose that a positive feedback loop between HSP101 and HSA32 at 
the protein level is a novel mechanism for prolonging the memory of heat 
acclimation.

Abstract

Heat acclimation improves the tolerance of organisms to severe heat stress. Our previous work showed that in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), the “memory” of heat acclimation treatment decayed faster in the absence of the heat-stress-associated 32-kD protein HSA32, a heat-induced protein predominantly found in plants. The HSA32 null mutant attains normal short-term acquired thermotolerance but is defective in long-term acquired thermotolerance. To further explore this phenomenon, we isolated Arabidopsis defective in long-term acquired thermotolerance ( dlt ) mutants using a forward genetic screen. Two recessive missense alleles, dlt1-1 and dlt1-2 , encode the molecular chaperone heat shock protein101 (HSP101). Results of immunoblot analyses suggest that HSP101 enhances the translation of HSA32 during recovery after heat treatment, and in turn, HSA32 retards the decay of HSP101. The dlt1-1 mutation has little effect on HSP101 chaperone activity and thermotolerance function but compromises the regulation of HSA32. In contrast, dlt1-2 impairs the chaperone activity and thermotolerance function of HSP101 but not the regulation of HSA32. These results suggest that HSP101 has a dual function, which could be decoupled by the mutations. Pulse-chase analysis showed that HSP101 degraded faster in the absence of HSA32. The autophagic proteolysis inhibitor E-64d, but not the proteasome inhibitor MG132, inhibited the degradation of HSP101. Ectopic expression of HSA32 confirmed its effect on the decay of HSP101 at the posttranscriptional level and showed that HSA32 was not sufficient to confer long-term acquired thermotolerance when the HSP101 level was low. Taken together, we propose that a positive feedback loop between HSP101 and HSA32 at the protein level is a novel mechanism for prolonging the memory of heat acclimation.

DISCUSSION

Acclimation to various environmental changes is crucial for plant survival and reproduction. However, how plants remember a stress acclimation experience is not yet understood. Recently, transcriptional memory to drought acclimation mediated by chromatin modification has been shown in Arabidopsis ( Ding et al., 2012 ). Here, we demonstrated another example in which acclimation memory can be modulated by the interplay of stress proteins at the posttranscriptional level.

Using a forward genetic approach, we identified Arabidopsis HSP101 missense mutations that cause a severe defect in LAT . So far, our screening did not find any mutant associated with HSA32 , HSFA2 , and ROF1 , which were also shown to positively regulate LAT ( Charng et al., 2006 , 2007 ; Meiri and Breiman, 2009 ). It is likely that the mutation in HSP101 causes severe defects that are much easier to discover than the mutations in other genes. Isolation of the dlt1 mutants provided new materials for the investigation of the structure-function relationship of HSP101. First, dlt1-2 with a mutation in a highly conserved His residue (H33Y) of the NTD domain represents a mutation in the ClpB/HSP100 family of proteins that has not been reported previously ( Supplemental Fig. S1 ). The NTD was shown to be dispensable for chaperone activity in Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus ( Beinker et al., 2002 ; Mogk et al., 2003 ) and for thermotolerance in cyanobacteria and yeast ( Clarke and Eriksson, 2000 ; Hung and Masison, 2006 ). However, work on E. coli ClpB showed that truncation of the NTD causes severe defects in molecular chaperone activity in vitro ( Barnett et al., 2000 ; Li and Sha, 2003 ). Our results indicate that the NTD of Arabidopsis HSP101 is involved in thermotolerance and chaperone activity ( Figs. 1 – 3 ).

The other HSP101 missense mutation, dlt1-1 (T599I), which is located near the N-terminal end of NBD2, had only a minor effect on SAT ( Fig. 1C ) and chaperone activity ( Fig. 2 ) but resulted in a substantial reduction in the poststress level of HSA32 ( Fig. 4 ) and LAT ( Fig. 1C ). This is essentially the opposite phenotype to dlt1-2 , which has severely reduced SAT and chaperone activity but shows a much less severe effect on the production of HSA32 at an early phase of recovery. These results suggest that the regulation of HSA32 accumulation by HSP101 does not correlate with its chaperone activity or function in thermotolerance and, therefore, that HSP101 has a dual function. In the dlt1 mutants, regulation of HSA32 is decoupled from the thermotolerance function of HSP101. Of note, yeast HSP104 also has been reported for having dual functions in thermotolerance and the propagation of [ PSI + ] prion, which could be decoupled by mutations ( Takahashi et al., 2007 ).

The diminished accumulation of HSA32 in dlt1-1 suggests that replacing Thr-599 by Ile disrupts the regulatory function of HSP101. Of note, the organelle-localized and prokaryotic ClpB/HSP100 homologs have an Ile residue at the position corresponding to Thr-599 in plant HSP101 ( Supplemental Fig. S1 ). Thus, it is not unexpected that the T599I mutation in dlt1-1 led to only a minor loss in chaperone activity. It should be noted that the Thr residue is highly conserved in cytosolic ClpB/HSP100 in land plants and that HSA32 is also conserved in land plants ( Liu et al., 2006 ). It is possible that the interplay between these two proteins was established during the terrestrial colonization of plants.

The effect of cycloheximide on HSP101-dependent HSA32 accumulation ( Fig. 6 ) prompts us to speculate that HSP101 controls the translation of HSA32. Recently, HSP101 was identified in Cap-binding complexes of germinating maize ( Zea mays ; Lázaro-Mixteco et al., 2012 ), suggesting a role for HSP101 in protein synthesis. A role for HSP101 in translation regulation has been proposed by Gallie and coworkers ( Wells et al., 1998 ; Gallie, 2002 ). However, direct genetic evidence to support this notion is still lacking. According to their working model, HSP101 could bind to the 5′ untranslated region ( UTR ) of HSA32 mRNA and recruit the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G, as is the case for the tobacco mosaic virus RNA. However, the 5′ UTR of the Arabidopsis HSA32 mRNA does not contain a sequence similar to the poly(CAA) element in Ω that has been identified as the HSP101 binding site ( Tanguay and Gallie, 1996 ). Moreover, we found that neither eIF4G nor eIF(iso)4G proteins seem to be involved in the translation of HSA32 ( Supplemental Fig. S4 ). However, a redundant role of these two isoforms in regulating the translation of HSA32 could not be excluded, as we did not check the triple KO mutant of eIF4G , eIF(iso)4G1 , and eIF(iso)4G2 , which could be lethal in Arabidopsis ( Nicaise et al., 2007 ). In addition to translation, HSP101 may retard the degradation of HSA32. This is supported by the observation that HSA32 declines faster in dlt1-2 than in the wild type after reaching similarly high levels at 16 h of recovery following heat treatment ( Fig. 4 ). More experiments are needed to elucidate this complex relation in detail.

In this study, we showed that HSA32 possesses a unique function in affecting the decay of HSP101. The effect of HSA32 on HSP101 degradation is likely to be specific. Our data show that the absence of HSA32 led to no significant alteration in other tested HSPs ( Fig. 4A ). Occasionally, we observed faster degradation of sHSP-CI in the absence of HSA32 in some experiments, but the results were not as reproducible as those for HSP101. The mechanism by which HSA32 retards HSP101 degradation, and if it requires direct interaction of the two proteins, are not clear. We did not observe a protein corresponding in size to HSA32 in an immunoprecipitation of HSP101 ( Fig. 7 ). This negative result suggests that HSA32 and HSP101 do not interact, but it is also very possible that their interaction was disrupted under our experimental conditions. Maize HSP101 was shown to coimmunoprecipitate with cytosolic HSC70 ( Zhang and Guy, 2005 ). However, no distinct protein band corresponding to HSC70 was detected either. Nevertheless, a protein band of 54 kD was coimmunoprecipitated with HSP101 ( Fig. 7 ). This band probably is a product of partially degraded HSP101, as it was not observed in hsp101 . Alternatively, it may be a protein specifically interacting with HSP101. The identity of this protein band will be determined later.

Here, we showed that the decay of the memory of heat acclimation, as manifested by the decay of acquired thermotolerance, is negatively regulated by interplay between HSP101 and HSA32. This interplay consists of a positive feedback loop: HSP101 promotes the accumulation of HSA32 by affecting its synthesis and degradation, which subsequently retards the degradation of HSP101 ( Fig. 11 ). By controlling HSP101 degradation, HSA32 prolongs the effect of heat acclimation, allowing plants to cope with rapid temperature changes in the terrestrial environment. This hypothesis is in line with recent studies of HSP101 effects in 10 Arabidopsis ecotypes, which suggest a primary role of HSP101 in emergency heat tolerance ( Tonsor et al., 2008 ). In rice ( Oryza sativa ), heat-induced HSP101 decayed differentially in indica and japonica types ( Agarwal et al., 2003 ), suggesting a role of regulating HSP101 decay in the adaptation to different climates. Recently, using rice Tos17 retrotransposon insertion lines, we observed that disruption of HSA32 also led to faster decay of HSP101 and to defective LAT , as was the case in Arabidopsis (M.-y. Lin and Y.-y. Charng, unpublished data). Further studies on the structure-function relationships of HSA32 and HSP101 in Arabidopsis and other plant species should provide more insight into this thermotolerance mechanism.
