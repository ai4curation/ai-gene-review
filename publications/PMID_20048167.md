Activation of Src family kinases (SFK) and the subsequent phosphorylation of 
VE-cadherin have been proposed as major regulatory steps leading to increases in 
vascular permeability in response to inflammatory mediators and growth factors. 
To investigate Src signaling in the absence of parallel signaling pathways 
initiated by growth factors or inflammatory mediators, we activated Src and SFKs 
by expression of dominant negative Csk, expression of constitutively active Src, 
or knockdown of Csk. Activation of SFK by overexpression of dominant negative 
Csk induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation at tyrosines 658, 685, and 731. However, 
dominant negative Csk expression was unable to induce changes in the monolayer 
permeability. In contrast, expression of constitutively active Src decreased 
barrier function and promoted VE-cadherin phosphorylation on tyrosines 658 and 
731, although the increase in VE-cadherin phosphorylation preceded the increase 
in permeability by 4-6 h. Csk knockdown induced VE-cadherin phosphorylation at 
sites 658 and 731 but did not induce a loss in barrier function. 
Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies suggest that 
phosphorylation of those sites did not impair VE-cadherin ability to bind p120 
and beta-catenin or the ability of these proteins to localize at the plasma 
membrane. Taken together, our data show that Src-induced tyrosine 
phosphorylation of VE-cadherin is not sufficient to promote an increase in 
endothelial cell monolayer permeability and suggest that signaling leading to 
changes in vascular permeability in response to inflammatory mediators or growth 
factors may require VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation concurrently with other 
signaling pathways to promote loss of barrier function.
