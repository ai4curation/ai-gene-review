A developmental gene product of Bacillus subtilis homologous to the sigma factor 
of Escherichia coli.

Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis involves sequential morphological and 
biochemical changes and is regulated by specific genes (spo genes) estimated to 
occupy more than 30 loci. A mutation in any one of these genes blocks the 
sporulation process at the corresponding developmental stage. Despite intensive 
genetic studies, the nature and function of the spo gene products remain 
unknown. Vegetative B. subtilis RNA polymerase core enzyme may interact with 
several sigma factors and discriminate among different classes of promoters. 
During sporulation, new polypeptides are associated with the core enzyme which 
may have a central role in modifying its promoter recognition specificity. As a 
first step to understanding their function in the switch from vegetative to 
sporulation mode, several early sporulation genes have been cloned and analysed. 
Here we report the cloning and nucleotide sequence of the spoIIG gene of B. 
subtilis. This gene encodes a polypeptide with a predicted relative molecular 
mass of 27,652 which contains a 65-amino acid region highly homologous to an 
internal part of the Escherichia coli sigma factor.
