Immune activation of type I IFNs by Listeria monocytogenes occurs independently 
of TLR4, TLR2, and receptor interacting protein 2 but involves TNFR-associated 
NF kappa B kinase-binding kinase 1.

Type I IFNs are well established antiviral cytokines that have also been shown 
to be induced by bacteria. However, the signaling mechanisms regulating the 
activation of these cytokines during bacterial infections remain poorly defined. 
We show that although Gram-negative bacteria can activate the type I IFN pathway 
through TLR4, the intracellular Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes 
(LM) can do so independently of TLR4 and TLR2. Furthermore, experiments using 
genetic mutants and chemical inhibitors suggest that LM-induced type I IFN 
activation occurs by an intracellular pathway involving the serine-threonine 
kinase TNFR-associated NF-kappaB kinase (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). 
Interestingly, receptor-interacting protein 2, a component of the recently 
discovered nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-dependent intracellular 
detection pathway, was not involved. Taken together, our data describe a novel 
signal transduction pathway involving TBK1 that is used by LM to activate type I 
IFNs. Additionally, we provide evidence that both the LM- and TLR-dependent 
pathways converge at TBK1 to activate type I IFNs, highlighting the central role 
of this molecule in modulating type I IFNs in host defense and disease.
