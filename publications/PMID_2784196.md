Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) expressing the CD8 glycoprotein recognize peptide 
antigens presented by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. 
This correlation and the absence of CD8 polymorphism led to the hypothesis that 
CD8 binds to a conserved site of class I MHC molecules. Using a cell-cell 
binding assay we previously demonstrated specific interaction between human 
class I MHC (HLA-A,B,C) molecules and CD8. Subsequent analysis of the products 
of 17 HLA-A,B alleles revealed a natural polymorphism for CD8 binding in the 
human population. Two molecules, HLA-Aw68.1 and HLA-Aw68.2, which do not bind 
CD8, have a valine residue at position 245 whereas all other HLA-A,B,C molecules 
have alanine. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that this single substitution in 
the alpha 3 domain is responsible for the CD8 binding phenotype and also affects 
recognition by alloreactive and influenza-specific CTL. Our results indicate 
that CD8 binds to the alpha 3 domain of class I MHC molecules.
