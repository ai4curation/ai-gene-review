Erythropoietin, by binding to its receptor, stimulates definitive erythroblasts 
to accumulate hemoglobin (Hb) by up-regulating erythroid-specific genes and 
causes differentiation of erythroblasts into erythrocytes. In mouse decidua we 
have found the expression of transcripts for the erythropoietin receptor, the 
function of which has not yet been elucidated. Erythropoietin signaling was 
inhibited by the injection of a soluble form of the erythropoietin receptor 
capable of binding with erythropoietin into the mouse uterine cavity on day 4 of 
gestation, and pale and defective decidual bodies appeared three days later. 
These pale decidual bodies contained defective embryos without extension to the 
ectoplacental region, while normal reddish decidual bodies contained normal 
developing embryos and expressed embryonic and adult Hb with characteristic 
location of the respective hemoglobins in which an epsilon- or beta-globin 
signal was confirmed. Furthermore, blocking of erythropoietin signaling 
destroyed Hb-containing cells and resulted in apoptosis that caused embryonic 
death. Thus, erythropoietin-mediated Hb synthesis is essential for the survival 
of decidual cells. In addition, although no transcripts for GATA-1 and erythroid 
heme enzymes could be detected, genes for beta-globin, as well as non-specific 
delta-aminolevulinate synthase, were expressed and regulated in an 
erythropoietin-dependent manner. This is the first evidence that ectopic Hb 
synthesis exists and that erythropoietin coregulates erythroid (globin) and 
nonerythroid (delta-aminolevulinate synthase) genes.
