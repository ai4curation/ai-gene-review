Mitochondria have emerged as central regulators of apoptosis. Here, we show that 
TID1, a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor lethal (2) tumorous 
imaginal discs, l(2)tid, encodes two mitochondrial matrix proteins, designated 
hTid-1(L) and hTid-1(S). These splice variants are both highly conserved members 
of the DnaJ family of proteins, which regulate the activity of and confer 
substrate specificity to Hsp70 proteins. Both hTid-1(L) and hTid-1(S) 
coimmunoprecipitate with mitochondrial Hsp70. Expression of hTid-1(L) or 
hTid-1(S) have no apparent capacity to induce apoptosis but have opposing 
effects on apoptosis induced by exogenous stimuli. Expression of hTid-1(L) 
increases apoptosis induced by both the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin c and tumor 
necrosis factor alpha. This activity is J domain-dependent, because a J domain 
mutant of hTid-1(L) can dominantly suppress apoptosis. In sharp contrast, 
expression of hTid-1(S) suppresses apoptosis, whereas expression of a J domain 
mutant of hTid-1(S) increases apoptosis. Hence, we propose that TID1 gene 
products act to positively and negatively modulate apoptotic signal transduction 
or effector structures within the mitochondrial matrix.
