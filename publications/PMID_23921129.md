Amyloid-β (Aβ) induces neuronal loss and cognitive deficits and is believed to 
be a prominent cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the cellular 
pathology of the disease is not fully understood. Here, we report that IgG Fcγ 
receptor II-b (FcγRIIb) mediates Aβ neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. We 
found that FcγRIIb is significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of AD brains 
and neuronal cells exposed to synthetic Aβ. Neuronal FcγRIIb activated ER stress 
and caspase-12, and Fcgr2b KO primary neurons were resistant to synthetic 
Aβ-induced cell death in vitro. Fcgr2b deficiency ameliorated Aβ-induced 
inhibition of long-term potentiation and inhibited the reduction of synaptic 
density by naturally secreted Aβ. Moreover, genetic depletion of Fcgr2b rescued 
memory impairments in an AD mouse model. To determine the mechanism of action of 
FcγRIIb in Aβ neurotoxicity, we demonstrated that soluble Aβ oligomers interact 
with FcγRIIb in vitro and in AD brains, and that inhibition of their interaction 
blocks synthetic Aβ neurotoxicity. We conclude that FcγRIIb has an aberrant, but 
essential, role in Aβ-mediated neuronal dysfunction.
