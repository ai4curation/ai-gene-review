BRCA1 is involved in the regulation of multiple nuclear events including 
transcription. AD1, one of the two trans-activation domains in BRCA1, stimulates 
transcription in a cell context-dependent manner. Here, it is shown that BRCA1 
interacts with Jun proteins via a coiled-coil motif in AD1 and the basic leucine 
zipper (bZIP) region of the Jun proteins. The Jun-interacting domain in BRCA1 is 
critical for AD1-mediated transcriptional activation. In particular, the 
strength of AD1 in transcriptional activation is limited by the JunB level and 
ectopic expression of JunB potentiates the transcriptional activity of AD1. 
Furthermore, JunB mRNA expression is down-regulated in many ovarian tumor 
tissues examined. Thus, the coiled-coil-mediated cooperation between BRCA1 and 
JunB may facilitate the function of these proteins in tissue-specific 
transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression.

Abstract

BRCA1 is involved in the regulation of multiple nuclear events including transcription. AD1, one of the two trans -activation domains in BRCA1, stimulates transcription in a cell context-dependent manner. Here, it is shown that BRCA1 interacts with Jun proteins via a coiled-coil motif in AD1 and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region of the Jun proteins. The Jun-interacting domain in BRCA1 is critical for AD1-mediated transcriptional activation. In particular, the strength of AD1 in transcriptional activation is limited by the JunB level and ectopic expression of JunB potentiates the transcriptional activity of AD1. Furthermore, JunB mRNA expression is down-regulated in many ovarian tumor tissues examined. Thus, the coiled-coil-mediated cooperation between BRCA1 and JunB may facilitate the function of these proteins in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression.

Discussion

A wealth of evidence strongly suggests that BRCA1 plays an important role in the maintenance of genome stability via its function in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. However, it remains puzzling that disease-associated mutations in BRCA1 , which compromise such universal nuclear functions as transcription and DNA repair, specifically lead to elevation of the risk in developing breast and ovarian cancers. It has been suggested that the rapid proliferating status of the breast epithelium during puberty could render it particularly susceptible to BRCA1 mutation-dependent tumorigenesis ( Scully and Livingston 2000 ). In addition, the fact that breast and ovary are both estrogen-responsive tissues and that BRCA1 can modulate transcriptional activation by estrogen receptor could also explain the organ-specific nature of the BRCA1-dependent cancer risk ( Fan et al. 1999 , 2001 ; Zheng et al. 2001 ). It is also possible that the tissue-specific action of BRCA1 may be determined by more than one BRCA1-associated protein complex. In such an event, changes in the level and/or biochemical properties of a number of the BRCA1-associated proteins could contribute to the development of neoplasm in these tissues.

The findings in the current study strongly suggest that JunB plays an important role in mediating the function of one of the trans -activation domains of BRCA1 (AD1). First, both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that the two proteins interact through the coiled-coil domain of BRCA1 and the bZIP domain in JunB. The affinity of BRCA1 for JunB is strongly correlated with the strength of the AD1 domain in transcriptional activation. Furthermore, the data suggest that the cellular level of the JunB protein is an important determinant for AD1 function in transcriptional activation. Limited AD1 transcriptional activity due to a deficit of JunB can be rescued by ectopic expression of JunB. This finding provides a molecular explanation for the previously observed cell-type dependent behavior of AD1 ( Hu et al. 2000 ). Lastly, JunB mRNA levels are down-regulated in many ovarian tumor tissues compared with the normal tissues from the same individuals. Given that the AD1 domain of BRCA1 encompasses the demarcation point for BRCA1 mutations that are associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer, our results raise an intriguing possibility that the BRCA1–JunB interaction may be particularly important for suppression of ovarian cancer. However, due to the lack of detailed information concerning the clinical characteristics of the patients and the exact cell types from which the cDNA pairs were prepared, further study is needed to explore the exact biological significance of the differential JunB expression observed in the current work.

The exact geometry and stoichiometry of the BRCA1–Jun complexes remain to be determined. It is also possible that the BRCA1–Jun interaction is aided by additional factors. The finding that BRCA1 is not associated with the cFos-containing complexes strongly suggests that Jun-Fos dimers, which is the predominant heterodimeric form of the AP1 family in vivo, are not capable of binding to BRCA1. This raises the possibility that BRCA1 may specifically target Jun monomers and/or Jun–Jun dimers. Conceivably, this Jun-specific interaction may lead to changes in the relative abundance, subnuclear localization, and biochemical characteristics of various forms of the AP1 proteins. The bZIP sequences among the Jun proteins are highly conserved, whereas those of Fos and Jun are relatively divergent. This could explain the disparity in their binding affinity for BRCA1. It is tempting to speculate that the leucine zipper motif may only provide the architectural basis for binding to BRCA1. Additional amino acid residues in the bZIP region that are unique to the Jun proteins may serve as the actual contact points for the coiled-coil region of BRCA1.

Whereas all three Jun proteins are capable of interacting with BRCA1, only JunB exhibits a strong enhancing effect on the AD1 transcriptional activity. Such a functional difference among the Jun proteins could be attributed to the more divergent sequences outside of the bZIP domain. The observation that BRCA1 can selectively target specific members of the AP1 family for physical and functional interaction may have profound biological ramifications. AP-1 family members form a large number of homodimers and heterodimers in vivo, each of which may exhibit distinct regulatory properties ( Karin et al. 1997 ). As a consequence, different AP1 family members can play diverse and even opposing roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. For example, it has been well documented that c-Jun is positively involved in cell proliferation and Ras-mediated oncogenesis ( Mechta-Grigoriou et al. 2001 ; Shaulian and Karin 2001 ). On the other hand, JunB and JunD can suppress Ras- and Src-induced cellular transformation ( Johnson et al. 1996 ; Mechta et al. 1997 ). Moreover, JunB can antagonize the stimulatory function of c-Jun in cyclin D1 transcription ( Bakiri et al. 2000 ), and at the same time activate the transcription of p16 INK4a , an inhibitor of the cyclin D-CDK4–D-CDK6 complexes ( Passegue and Wagner 2000 ). Recent work with conditional JunB knockout mice also supports a role of JunB in tumor suppression ( Passegue et al. 2001 ). Thus, although our study does not exclude a potential functional link between BRCA1 and the other two Jun proteins, the cooperation between BRCA1 and JunB in transcriptional regulation may be related to their known functions in suppression of tissue-specific tumor development.
