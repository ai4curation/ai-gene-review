Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes degradation of 
hepatic low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), the major route of clearance 
of circulating cholesterol. Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause 
hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis, whereas loss-of-function 
mutations result in hypocholesterolemia and protection from heart disease. 
Recombinant human PCSK9 binds the LDLR on the surface of cultured hepatocytes 
and promotes degradation of the receptor after internalization. Here we 
localized the site of binding of PCSK9 within the extracellular domain of the 
LDLR and determined the fate of the receptor after PCSK9 binding. Recombinant 
human PCSK9 interacted in a sequence-specific manner with the first epidermal 
growth factor-like repeat (EGF-A) in the EGF homology domain of the human LDLR. 
Similar binding specificity was observed between PCSK9 and purified EGF-A. 
Binding to EGF-A was calcium-dependent and increased dramatically with reduction 
in pH from 7 to 5.2. The addition of PCSK9, but not heat-inactivated PCSK9, to 
the medium of cultured hepatocytes resulted in redistribution of the receptor 
from the plasma membrane to lysosomes. These data are consistent with a model in 
which PCSK9 binding to EGF-A interferes with an acid-dependent conformational 
change required for receptor recycling. As a consequence, the LDLR is rerouted 
from the endosome to the lysosome where it is degraded.
