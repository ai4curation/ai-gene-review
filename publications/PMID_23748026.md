While vampire bat oral secretions have been the subject of intense research, 
efforts have concentrated only on two components: DSPA (Desmodus rotundus 
salivary plasminogen activator) and Draculin. The molecular evolutionary history 
of DSPA has been elucidated, while conversely draculin has long been known from 
only a very small fragment and thus even the basic protein class was not even 
established. Despite the fact that vampire bat venom has a multitude of effects 
unaccounted by the documented bioactivities of DSPA and draculin, efforts have 
not been made to establish what other bioactive proteins are secreted by their 
submaxillary gland. In addition, it has remained unclear whether the 
anatomically distinct anterior and posterior lobes of the submaxillary gland are 
evolving on separate gene expression trajectories or if they remain under the 
shared genetic control. Using a combined proteomic and transcriptomic approach, 
we show that identical proteins are simultaneously expressed in both lobes. In 
addition to recovering the known structural classes of DSPA, we recovered a 
novel DSPA isoform as well as obtained a very large sequence stretch of draculin 
and thus established that it is a mutated version of the lactotransferrin 
scaffold. This study reveals a much more complex secretion profile than 
previously recognised. In addition to obtaining novel versions of scaffolds 
convergently recruited into other venoms (allergen-like, CRiSP, kallikrein, 
Kunitz, lysozyme), we also documented novel expression of small peptides related 
to calcitonin, PACAP, and statherin. Other overexpressed protein types included 
BPI-fold, lacritin, and secretoglobin. Further, we investigate the molecular 
evolution of various vampire bat venom-components and highlight the dominant 
role of positive selection in the evolution of these proteins. Conspicuously 
many of the proteins identified in the proteome were found to be homologous to 
proteins with known activities affecting vasodilation and platelet aggregation. 
We show that vampire bat venom proteins possibly evade host immune response by 
the mutation of the surface chemistry through focal mutagenesis under the 
guidance of positive Darwinian selection. These results not only contribute to 
the body of knowledge regarding haematophagous venoms but also provide a rich 
resource for novel lead compounds for use in drug design and development.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: These results have direct implications in understanding 
the molecular evolutionary history of vampire bat venom. The unusual peptides 
discovered reinforce the value of studying such neglected taxon for 
biodiscovery.
