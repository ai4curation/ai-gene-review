Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism and cellular survival, and 
consequently mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a number of human 
pathologies. Reversible protein phosphorylation emerges as a central mechanism 
in the regulation of several mitochondrial processes. In skeletal muscle, 
mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to insulin resistance in humans with obesity 
and type 2 diabetes. We performed a phosphoproteomics study of functional 
mitochondria isolated from human muscle biopsies with the aim to obtain a 
comprehensive overview of mitochondrial phosphoproteins. Combining an efficient 
mitochondrial isolation protocol with several different phosphopeptide 
enrichment techniques and LC-MS/MS, we identified 155 distinct phosphorylation 
sites in 77 mitochondrial phosphoproteins, including 116 phosphoserine, 23 
phosphothreonine, and 16 phosphotyrosine residues. The relatively high number of 
phosphotyrosine residues suggests an important role for tyrosine phosphorylation 
in mitochondrial signaling. Many of the mitochondrial phosphoproteins are 
involved in oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and lipid 
metabolism, i.e. processes proposed to be involved in insulin resistance. We 
also assigned phosphorylation sites in mitochondrial proteins involved in amino 
acid degradation, importers and transporters, calcium homeostasis, and 
apoptosis. Bioinformatics analysis of kinase motifs revealed that many of these 
mitochondrial phosphoproteins are substrates for protein kinase A, protein 
kinase C, casein kinase II, and DNA-dependent protein kinase. Our results 
demonstrate the feasibility of performing phosphoproteome analysis of organelles 
isolated from human tissue and provide novel targets for functional studies of 
reversible phosphorylation in mitochondria. Future comparative phosphoproteome 
analysis of mitochondria from healthy and diseased individuals will provide 
insights into the role of abnormal phosphorylation in pathologies, such as type 
2 diabetes.

Abstract

Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism and cellular survival, and consequently mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a number of human pathologies. Reversible protein phosphorylation emerges as a central mechanism in the regulation of several mitochondrial processes. In skeletal muscle, mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to insulin resistance in humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes. We performed a phosphoproteomics study of functional mitochondria isolated from human muscle biopsies with the aim to obtain a comprehensive overview of mitochondrial phosphoproteins. Combining an efficient mitochondrial isolation protocol with several different phosphopeptide enrichment techniques and LC-MS/MS, we identified 155 distinct phosphorylation sites in 77 mitochondrial phosphoproteins, including 116 phosphoserine, 23 phosphothreonine, and 16 phosphotyrosine residues. The relatively high number of phosphotyrosine residues suggests an important role for tyrosine phosphorylation in mitochondrial signaling. Many of the mitochondrial phosphoproteins are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and lipid metabolism, i.e. processes proposed to be involved in insulin resistance. We also assigned phosphorylation sites in mitochondrial proteins involved in amino acid degradation, importers and transporters, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis.

Our results demonstrate the feasibility of performing phosphoproteome analysis of organelles isolated from human tissue and provide novel targets for functional studies of reversible phosphorylation in mitochondria. Future comparative phosphoproteome analysis of mitochondria from healthy and diseased individuals will provide insights into the role of abnormal phosphorylation in pathologies, such as type 2 diabetes.

DISCUSSION

Here we present the first systematic study of the in vivo mitochondrial phosphoproteome in human skeletal muscle. Combining different phosphopeptide enrichment approaches with high performance LC-MS/MS, 176 phosphorylation sites in 86 mitochondrial phosphoproteins were identified. A previous study of human skeletal muscle by Højlund et al. ( 34 ) reported the identification of 367 phosphorylation sites in 144 phosphoproteins using the combination of strong cation exchange and TiO 2 . Of these, 22% were assigned as mitochondrial phosphoproteins. Our results demonstrate that the identification of phosphorylation sites in mitochondrial proteins by LC-MS/MS is highly improved by fractionation of mitochondria from human skeletal muscle tissue prior to phosphopeptide enrichment. The phosphopeptide enrichment efficiency was 55–93% by using TiO 2 microcolumn, TiO 2 batch, HILIC/TiO 2 , or CPP/TiO 2 . Thus, recovery of phosphopeptides using different enrichment techniques turned out to be very effective ( Table I ).

Our data are in agreement with a number of recent studies, which have indirectly shown a number of mitochondrial proteins to be phosphorylated in other tissues and species ( 41 , 43 ). Among 45 of these previously reported mitochondrial phosphoproteins, we found several novel phosphorylation sites. Moreover, many of the phosphorylation sites identified in this study have been reported before in various other studies of mitochondria from different species, tissues, and cell types. The largest overlap was observed by comparison of our data with the recent quantitative study of isolated mitochondria from pig heart muscle by Boja et al. ( 29 ). Thus, 42% ( 22 ) of the 52 known phosphorylation sites identified in our study were also reported by Boja et al. ( 29 ).

Of all the identified mitochondrial phosphoproteins, MitoNEET (CISD1; CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein 1), which is a uniquely folded 2Fe-2S outer mitochondrial membrane protein, is of great interest. MitoNEET is emerging as a new potential target for type 2 diabetes treatment using pioglitazone, which is a member of the thiazolidinedione family ( 49 – 52 ). The stability of the 2Fe-2S cluster is increased by binding to pioglitazone. MitoNEET is believed to play an important role in regulating maximal capacity for electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. However, so far, no phosphorylation sites of MitoNEET have been described. In our study, two distinct phosphorylation sites, Ser-2 and Ser-7, were identified in the peptide SLTSSSSVR, which is a part of the putative N-terminal transmembrane helix (residues 1–31). This N-terminal sequence of MitoNEET is not well studied but seems to be the membrane-spanning part, targeting MitoNEET to the outer mitochondrial membrane ( 50 ). Thus, phosphorylation of this signal sequence may play an important role in the targeting or binding of MitoNEET to the mitochondrial membrane. The discovery of these novel phosphorylation sites may contribute to reveal the function and biological activity of human MitoNEET and hence its value as a target for treatment of type 2 diabetes.

The kinase family prediction provided by NetworKIN does not include all kinase families. However, the prediction produced quite similar results in the basal state as in a phosphoproteomics analysis of whole muscle ( 34 ), which also showed a major role for PKA, CKII, and PKC. Interestingly, our results imply a greater role for DNAPK and perhaps a relatively reduced role for GSK3, RSK, and CDK5 in mitochondria. Indeed, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and glycerophosphate acyltransferase in mitochondria were previously shown to be phosphorylated by CKII ( 53 , 54 ). It was reported that DNAPK may phosphorylate mitochondrial heat-shock proteins in treatment with anticancer drugs ( 55 ). However, the role of PKC and PKA in the phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins is better documented. Different isoforms of PKC are known to translocate into mitochondria and localize to the inner membrane and cristae, playing a direct role in regulating mitochondrial functions ( 10 ). In fact, we identified a PKC isoform, PKCα, in our preparation. PKCα has been reported to play a functional role in reducing apoptosis by phosphorylating mitochondrial Bcl-2 ( 56 ). Another isoform, PKCε, is also known to mediate its antiapoptotic effect via mitochondria ( 57 ). Moreover, PKCε has been reported to promote cardioprotection by phosphorylating VDAC ( 58 ). Here in our study, 19 distinct phosphorylation sites were identified in VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3, many of which were not reported before. Four phosphorylation sites (Ser-215 in VDAC1, Ser-128 in VDAC2, Ser-45 and Thr-71 on VDAC3) were predicted as targets of PKC by NetworKIN. These novel identifications suggest a potential great impact of PKC phosphorylation on VDAC isoforms through which mitochondrial processes are regulated. Potential PKA substrates are also well represented among the mitochondrial phosphoproteins identified in the present study. PKA is responsive to elevated cAMP levels and mediates signaling cascades. PKA activity has been reported in human mitochondria ( 7 , 8 , 10 ). Translocated to the inner membrane and matrix of mitochondria, PKA has been shown to have positive effects on most major mitochondrial functions, enhancing cellular respiration rate, inhibiting apoptosis, and regulating protein expression and biogenesis ( 10 ). Although these previous studies support our findings, the role of these kinases on the specific phosphorylation sites needs to be characterized in future studies.

The relative abundance of phosphotyrosine residues was recently shown to be 2–5-fold higher in skeletal muscle than in other human tissue or cell types, suggesting a potential enhanced role for tyrosine phosphorylation in this mitochondrion-rich tissue ( 34 ). Consistent with this finding, here we report that the extent of phosphotyrosine residues in isolated muscle mitochondria is up to 12-fold higher than in other human tissue and cell types ( 59 – 62 ). This high ratio was unexpected because it was observed in a non-stimulated condition in which tyrosine phosphorylation is believed to be at low levels ( 40 ). The phosphotyrosine residues identified in the present study were located in subunits of complex I or complex III (electron transport chain) and outer or inner membrane solute carriers and channel proteins, but other studies have shown that tyrosine phosphorylated proteins are distributed to almost all mitochondrial compartments ( 8 , 40 , 42 ). Accordingly, a number of tyrosine-specific kinases and phosphatases have been localized to mitochondria, and a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of mitochondrial function has gained increasing attention ( 7 , 8 , 40 ). There is evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of specific subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) is capable of both inhibiting ( 63 ) and activating ( 64 ) complex IV activity and hence ATP synthesis, but most of the tyrosine phosphorylated sites have been identified in global phosphoproteomics surveys ( 42 , 62 ) and therefore need to be studied further. Taken together, our data lend support to the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation could represent a new frontier in mitochondrial signaling ( 42 ). It is expected that the use of muscle mitochondria isolated after in vivo exposure to stimuli such as contraction and insulin in combination with phosphotyrosine enrichment prior to MS/MS would lead to the identification of a higher number of tyrosine phosphorylated residues and that this will help to reveal the role of these PTMs in human muscle mitochondria in both healthy and diseased states such as insulin resistance.

The identified mitochondrial phosphoproteins are involved in a broad range of biological processes crucial for mitochondrial and muscle metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid degradation, cell survival, calcium homeostasis, and outer and inner membrane solute carriers and channel proteins. Even proteins with so far unknown functions were identified. Our results are in accordance with a number of recent reports indicating that phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins may play a greater role than hitherto expected. A high number of subunits involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are phosphorylated even in the basal state ( Fig. 5 ). Moreover, almost all enzymes in the TCA cycle and a number of enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism are phosphorylated. These mitochondrial processes play a crucial role for the balance between glucose and lipid metabolism in human skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that reversible phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins may play a role in the association between mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes ( 32 ) and other muscle disorders characterized by abnormal mitochondrial content and function. Therefore, these data provide potential targets for investigation of functional implications under different conditions and for treatment in muscular diseases.

The present study is a “discovery mode” proteomics study, and although a high number of phosphorylation sites were identified, more sites could probably be identified by hypothesis-driven targeted phosphoproteomics analysis of each potential phosphorylation site in these mitochondrial phosphoproteins. We detected only one (at Thr-213) of the seven phosphorylation sites identified in a recent study of immunopurified ATP synthase β by targeted phosphoproteomics ( 65 ). However, two additional phosphorylation sites at Ser-415 and Ser-529 in ATP synthase β were identified in our study. Our data represent a comprehensive first attempt for the characterization of the in vivo mitochondrial phosphoproteome in human skeletal muscle and provide a long list of mitochondrial proteins for large scale targeted phosphoproteomics analysis. This list includes so far only mitochondrial proteins phosphorylated to a detectable extent in the resting, basal state. The number of mitochondrial phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites may increase significantly in human skeletal muscle in response to different stimuli, including insulin, e.g. via translocation of signaling enzymes from cytosol to mitochondria, which has been shown for PKB/Akt ( 66 , 67 ), or exercise/contraction, e.g. mediated by changes in calcium concentration ( 41 ). Also the application of more efficient phosphoenrichment procedures, in particular when using small human samples, may significantly increase the number of phosphorylation sites identified.

In summary, this study presents the in vivo phosphoproteome of isolated mitochondria from small human skeletal muscle biopsies. These results provide a rich source for investigating the role of reversible phosphorylation in mitochondrial functions in healthy and pathological conditions and also for ongoing targeted clinical phosphoproteome studies.
