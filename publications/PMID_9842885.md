The MHC class I binding proteins leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LIR)-1 
and -2 recognize a similar broad spectrum of HLA-A, -B and -C alleles but are 
differentially expressed in lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells. In 
monocytes, phosphorylation of LIR-1 and LIR-2 results in the binding of the 
tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Coligation of either LIR with Fcgamma receptor I 
(CD64) inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of the associated Fc receptor gamma 
chain and Syk molecules, as well as intracellular calcium mobilization. These 
findings suggest that LIR-1 and LIR-2 function as unique MHC class I receptors 
involved in the inhibition or down-modulation of monocyte activation signals, 
particularly those mediated through the receptors for IgG, IgE and IgA.
