Eukaryotic ribosome synthesis is a highly dynamic process that involves the 
transient association of scores of trans-acting factors to nascent 
pre-ribosomes. Many ribosome synthesis factors are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling 
proteins that engage the assembly pathway at early nucleolar stages and escort 
pre-ribosomes to the nucleoplasm and/or the cytoplasm. Here, we report that two 
40S ribosome synthesis factors, the KH-domain protein DIM2 and the 
HEAT-repeats/Armadillo-domain and export factor RRP12, are nucleolar restricted 
upon nutritional, osmotic, and oxidative stress. Nucleolar entrapment of DIM2 
and RRP12 was triggered by rapamycin treatment and was under the strict control 
of the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling cascade. DIM2 binds pre-rRNAs 
directly through its KH domain at the 5'-end of ITS1 (D-A(2) segment) and, 
consistent with its requirements in early nucleolar pre-rRNA processing, is 
required for efficient cotranscriptional ribosome assembly. The substitution of 
a single and highly conserved amino acid (G207A) within the KH motif is 
sufficient to inhibit pre-rRNA processing in a fashion similar to genetic 
depletion of DIM2. DIM2 carries an evolutionarily conserved putative nuclear 
export sequence (NES) at its carboxyl-terminal end that is required for 
efficient pre-40S ribosome export. Strikingly, DIM2 and RRP12 are both involved 
in the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of pre-ribosomes, suggesting that this 
step in the ribosome assembly pathway has been selected as a regulatory target 
for the TOR pathway.
