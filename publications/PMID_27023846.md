Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) perform protein synthesis inside 
mitochondria, the organelles responsible for energy conversion and adenosine 
triphosphate production in eukaryotic cells. Throughout evolution, mitoribosomes 
have become functionally specialized for synthesizing mitochondrial membrane 
proteins, and this has been accompanied by large changes to their structure and 
composition. We review recent high-resolution structural data that have provided 
unprecedented insight into the structure and function of mitoribosomes in 
mammals and fungi.
