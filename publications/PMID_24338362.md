The kinesin motors are important in the regulation of cellular functions such as 
protein trafficking, spindle organization and centrosome separation. In this 
study, we have identified POPX2, a serine-threonine phosphatase, as an 
interacting partner of the KAP3 subunit of the kinesin-2 motor. The kinesin-2 
motor is a heterotrimeric complex composed of KIF3A, KIF3B motor subunits and 
KAP3, the non-motor subunit, which binds the cargo. Here we report that the 
phosphatase POPX2 is a negative regulator of the trafficking of N-cadherin and 
other cargoes; consequently, it markedly influences cell-cell adhesion. POPX2 
affects trafficking by determining the phosphorylation status of KIF3A at serine 
690. This is consistent with the observation that the KIF3A-S690A mutant is 
defective in cargo trafficking. Our studies also implicate CaMKII as the kinase 
that phosphorylates KIF3A at serine 690. These results strongly suggest that 
POPX2 and CaMKII are a phosphatase-kinase pair that regulates kinesin-mediated 
transport and cell-cell adhesion.
