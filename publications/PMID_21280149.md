Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMC), a severe autosomal recessive skeletal 
disorder with mental retardation, is caused by mutation of the gene encoding 
Dymeclin (DYM). Employing patient fibroblasts with mutations characterized at 
the genomic and, for the first time, transcript level, we identified profound 
disruption of Golgi organization as a pathogenic feature, resolved by 
transfection of heterologous wild-type Dymeclin. Collagen targeting appeared 
defective in DMC cells leading to near complete absence of cell surface collagen 
fibers. DMC cells have an elevated apoptotic index (P< 0.01) likely due to a 
stress response contingent upon Golgi-related trafficking defects. We performed 
spatiotemporal mapping of Dymeclin expression in zebrafish embryos and 
identified high levels of transcript in brain and cartilage during early 
development. Finally, in a chondrocyte cDNA library, we identified two novel 
secretion pathway proteins as Dymeclin interacting partners: GOLM1 and PPIB. 
Together these data identify the role of Dymeclin in secretory pathways 
essential to endochondral bone formation during early development.
