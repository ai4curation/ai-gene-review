A role for DnaK, the major E. coli Hsp70, in chaperoning de novo protein folding 
has remained elusive. Here we show that under nonstress conditions DnaK 
transiently associates with a wide variety of nascent and newly synthesized 
polypeptides, with a preference for chains larger than 30 kDa. Deletion of the 
nonessential gene encoding trigger factor, a ribosome-associated chaperone, 
results in a doubling of the fraction of nascent polypeptides interacting with 
DnaK. Combined deletion of the trigger factor and DnaK genes is lethal under 
normal growth conditions. These findings indicate important, partially 
overlapping functions of DnaK and trigger factor in de novo protein folding and 
explain why the loss of either chaperone can be tolerated by E. coli.
