The mucosal immune system forms the largest part of the entire immune system, 
containing about three-quarters of all lymphocytes and producing grams of 
secretory IgA daily to protect the mucosal surface from pathogens. To evoke the 
mucosal immune response, antigens on the mucosal surface must be transported 
across the epithelial barrier into organized lymphoid structures such as Peyer's 
patches. This function, called antigen transcytosis, is mediated by specialized 
epithelial M cells. The molecular mechanisms promoting this antigen uptake, 
however, are largely unknown. Here we report that glycoprotein 2 (GP2), 
specifically expressed on the apical plasma membrane of M cells among 
enterocytes, serves as a transcytotic receptor for mucosal antigens. Recombinant 
GP2 protein selectively bound a subset of commensal and pathogenic 
enterobacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), by recognizing FimH, a component of type I pili on 
the bacterial outer membrane. Consistently, these bacteria were colocalized with 
endogenous GP2 on the apical plasma membrane as well as in cytoplasmic vesicles 
in M cells. Moreover, deficiency of bacterial FimH or host GP2 led to defects in 
transcytosis of type-I-piliated bacteria through M cells, resulting in an 
attenuation of antigen-specific immune responses in Peyer's patches. GP2 is 
therefore a previously unrecognized transcytotic receptor on M cells for 
type-I-piliated bacteria and is a prerequisite for the mucosal immune response 
to these bacteria. Given that M cells are considered a promising target for oral 
vaccination against various infectious diseases, the GP2-dependent transcytotic 
pathway could provide a new target for the development of M-cell-targeted 
mucosal vaccines.
