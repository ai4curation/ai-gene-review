The chaperone glucose-regulated protein, 78/immunoglobulin binding protein 
(GRP78/Bip), protects cells from cytotoxicity induced by DNA damage or 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, we showed that GRP78 is a 
major inducible protein in human non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells treated 
with ER stress inducers, including A23187 and thapsigargin. AEBSF, an inhibitor 
of serine protease, diminished GRP78 induction, enhanced mitochondrial 
permeability, and augmented apoptosis in H460 cells during ER stress. 
Simultaneously, AEBSF promoted Raf-1 degradation and suppressed phosphorylation 
of Raf-1 at Ser338 and/or Tyr340 during ER stress. Coimmunoprecipitation assays 
and subcellular fractionations showed that GRP78 associated and colocalized with 
Raf-1 on the outer membrane of mitochondria, respectively. While treatment of 
cells with ER stress inducers inactivated BAD by phosphorylation at Ser75, a 
Raf-1 phosphorylation site; AEBSF attenuated phosphorylation of BAD, leading to 
cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Additionally, overexpression of GRP78 
and/or Raf-1 protected cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Taken together, 
our results indicate that GRP78 may stabilize Raf-1 to maintain mitochondrial 
permeability and thus protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.
