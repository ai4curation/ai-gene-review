Global genomic repair (GGR) and transcription coupled repair (TCR) are two 
pathways of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that differ in the damage 
recognition step. How NER factors, especially GGR factors, access DNA damage in 
the chromatin of eukaryotic cells has been poorly understood. Dot1, a histone 
methyltransferase required for methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79), has 
been shown to confer yeast cells with resistance to DNA-damaging agents and play 
a role in activation of DNA damage checkpoints. Here, we show that Dot1 and 
H3K79 methylation are required for GGR in both nucleosomal core regions and 
internucleosomal linker DNA, but play no role in TCR. H3K79 trimethylation 
contributes to but is not absolutely required for GGR, and lower levels of H3K79 
methylation (mono- and dimethylation) also promote GGR. Our results also 
indicate that the roles of Dot1 and H3K79 methylation in GGR are not achieved by 
either activating DNA damage checkpoints or regulating the expression of the 
GGR-specific factor Rad16. Rather, the methylated H3K79 may serve as a docking 
site for the GGR machinery on the chromatin. Our studies identified a novel 
GGR-specific NER factor and unveiled the critical link between a covalent 
histone modification and GGR.
