Eph receptor tyrosine kinases play a critical role in embryonic patterning and 
angiogenesis. In the adult, they are involved in carcinogenesis and pathological 
neovascularization. However, the mechanisms underlying their role in tumor 
formation and metastasis remain to be defined. Here, we demonstrated that 
stimulation of EphB1 with ephrinB1/Fc led to a marked downregulation of EphB1 
protein, a process blocked by the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin. Following 
ephrinB1 stimulation, the ubiquitin ligase Cbl was recruited by EphB1 and then 
phosphorylated. Both Cbl phosphorylation and EphB1 ubiquitination were blocked 
by the Src inhibitor PP2. Overexpression of wild-type Cbl, but not of 70Z mutant 
lacking ligase activity, enhanced EphB1 ubiquitination and degradation. This 
negative regulation required the tyrosine kinase activity of EphB1 as 
kinase-dead EphB1-K652R was resistant to Cbl. Glutathione S-transferase binding 
experiments showed that Cbl bound to EphB1 through its tyrosine kinase-binding 
domain. In aggregate, we demonstrated that Cbl induces the ubiquitination and 
lysosomal degradation of activated EphB1, a process requiring EphB1 and Src 
kinase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study dissecting the 
molecular mechanisms leading to EphB1 downregulation, thus paving the way to new 
means of modulating their angiogenic and tumorigenic properties.
