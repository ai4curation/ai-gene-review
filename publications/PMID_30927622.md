Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), a crucial regulator of type I interferons 
(IFNs), plays a crucial role in resistance to viral infection. The abnormal 
production of type I IFNs is associated with many types of disease, such as 
cancer and inflammatory disorders. Thus, understanding the post-translational 
modifications of IRF7 is essential to promoting an appropriate immune response. 
We have recently showed that the TAR RNA binding protein 2 (TARBP2) suppresses 
IFN-β production and the innate antiviral response by targeting MAVS. Here, we 
further identified TARBP2 as a novel inhibitor of IRF7, which inhibits 
IRF7-mediated IFN-β production triggered by the Sendai virus in 293 T cells. 
Overexpression of TARBP2 inhibits the phosphorylation as well as the K63-linked 
ubiquitination of IRF7, whilst TARBP2 also impairs the stability of endogenous 
TRAF6. Furthermore, TARBP2 participates in the interaction between IRF7 and 
TRAF6, thereby suppressing TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of IRF7, 
which is a prerequisite of IRF7 phosphorylation. Our findings further reveal the 
mechanism by which TARBP2 regulates the antiviral signaling pathways of the 
innate immune system.
