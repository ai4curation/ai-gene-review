BIN1 is a novel protein that interacts with the functionally critical Myc box 
regions at the N terminus of the MYC oncoprotein. BIN1 is structurally related 
to amphiphysin, a breast cancer-associated autoimmune antigen, and RVS167, a 
negative regulator of the yeast cell cycle, suggesting roles in malignancy and 
cell cycle control. Consistent with this likelihood, BIN1 inhibited malignant 
cell transformation by MYC. Although BIN1 is expressed in many normal cells, its 
levels were greatly reduced or undetectable in 14/27 carcinoma cell lines and 
3/6 primary breast tumours. Deficits were functionally significant because 
ectopic expression of BIN1 inhibited the growth of tumour cells lacking 
endogenous message. We conclude that BIN1 is an MYC-interacting protein with 
features of a tumour suppressor.
