Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized through the Kennedy pathway, but more 
than 50% of PC is remodeled through the Lands cycle, i.e. the deacylation and 
reacylation of PC to attain the final and proper fatty acids within PC. The 
reacylation step is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 
(LPCAT), and we report here the identification of a novel LPCAT, which we named 
LPCAT3. LPCAT3 belongs to the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family 
and encodes a protein of 487 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56 
kDa. Membranes from HEK293 cells overexpressing LPCAT3 showed significantly 
increased LPCAT activity as assessed by thin layer chromatography analysis with 
substrate preference toward unsaturated fatty acids. LPCAT3 is localized within 
the endoplasmic reticulum and is primarily expressed in metabolic tissues 
including liver, adipose, and pancreas. In a human hepatoma Huh7 cells, RNA 
interference-mediated knockdown of LPCAT3 resulted in virtually complete loss of 
membrane LPCAT activity, suggesting that LPCAT3 is primarily responsible for 
hepatic LPCAT activity. Furthermore, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
alpha agonists dose-dependently regulated LPCAT3 in liver in a peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor alpha-dependent fashion, implicating a role of 
LPCAT3 in lipid homeostasis. Our studies identify a long-sought enzyme that 
plays a critical role in PC remodeling in metabolic tissues and provide an 
invaluable tool for future investigations on how PC remodeling may potentially 
impact glucose and lipid homeostasis.
