Development of an efficient cell-free translation system from mammalian cells is 
an important goal. We examined whether supplementation of HeLa cell extracts 
with any translation initiation factor or translational regulator could enhance 
protein synthesis. eIF2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2) and eIF2B 
augmented translation of capped, uncapped and encephalomyocarditis 
virus-internal ribosome entry site-promoted mRNAs. eIF4E specifically stimulated 
capped mRNA translation, while p97, a homologue to the C-terminal two-thirds of 
eIF4G, increased uncapped mRNA translation. When the HeLa cell extract was 
supplemented with a combination of eIF2, eIF2B, and p97, the capacity to 
synthesize a protein from an uncapped mRNA became comparable to that from the 
capped counterpart stimulated with a combination of eIF2, eIF2B, and eIF4E. A 
dialysis method rendered the HeLa cell extract capable of synthesizing proteins 
for 36h, and the yield was augmented when supplemented with initiation factors. 
In contrast, the productivity of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate was not enhanced 
by this method. Collectively, the translation factor-supplemented HeLa cell 
extract should become an important tool for the production of recombinant 
proteins.
