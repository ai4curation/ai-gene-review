Although the Notch and JAK-STAT signalling pathways fulfill overlapping roles in 
growth and differentiation regulation, no coordination mechanism has been 
proposed to explain their relationship. Here we show that STAT3 is activated in 
the presence of active Notch, as well as the Notch effectors Hes1 and Hes5. Hes 
proteins associate with JAK2 and STAT3, and facilitate complex formation between 
JAK2 and STAT3, thus promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. 
Furthermore, suppression of endogenous Hes1 expression reduces growth factor 
induction of STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 seems to be essential for maintenance 
of radial glial cells and differentiation of astrocytes by Notch in the 
developing central nervous system. These results suggest that direct 
protein-protein interactions coordinate cross-talk between the Notch-Hes and 
JAK-STAT pathways.
