The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of cytokines regulates 
vascular development and inflammatory responses. We have recently shown that 
exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to hypoxia (1% O(2)) 
increases gene expression and bioactivation of TGF-beta2 and induces its 
downstream effectors, Smad proteins (Smads), to associate with DNA. In the 
present study, we show that hypoxia-induced TGF-beta2 gene expression is 
dependent on thrombospondin-1-mediated bioactivation of latent TGF-beta. 
Blocking TGF-beta2 but not TGF-beta1 in hypoxic endothelial cell cultures 
inhibited induction of the TGF-beta2 gene, indicating that an autocrine 
mechanism driven by bioactivation of TGF-beta2 leads to its gene expression in 
hypoxic HUVECs. Exposure of HUVECs to hypoxia resulted in phosphorylation and 
nuclear transportation of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins as well as stimulation of 
transcriptional activities of Smad3 and the transcription factor 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and culminated in up-regulation of TGF-beta2 
gene expression. Autocrine regulation of TGF-beta2 production in hypoxia may 
involve cross-talk between Smad3 and HIF-1alpha signaling pathways, and could be 
an important mechanism by which endothelial cells respond to hypoxic stress.
