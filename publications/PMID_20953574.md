Induction of the differentiation of human leukemia cells is a useful strategy in 
treatment of human leukemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in 
leukemia cell differentiation have not been fully elucidated. Interleukin 6 
(IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine acting on a variety of cell types, and plays 
important roles in hematopoiesis. GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1) is an 
important transcription factor involved in either megakaryocytic or erythrocytic 
differentiation. Herein we report that Rab7b, a late endosome/lysosome-localized 
myeloid small GTPase, promotes phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced 
megakaryocytic differentiation by increasing nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent 
IL-6 production and subsequently enhancing the association of activated signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) with GATA-1. By using 
PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of leukemia cells as a model, we 
investigated the roles of Rab7b in megakaryocytic differentiation. We find that 
Rab7b can potentiate PMA-induced upregulation of megakaryocytic markers, 
production of IL-6, and activation of NF-κB. Inhibitor of NF-κB and neutralizing 
antibodies for IL-6 or the IL-6 signaling receptor gp130 can block the effects 
of Rab7b in megakaryocytic differentiation. In Rab7b-silenced cells, PMA-induced 
activation of NF-κB, IL-6 production, and megakaryocytic differentiation are 
impaired. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-6-induced activation of STAT3 and 
the subsequent association of STAT3 with GATA-1 may contribute to PMA-induced 
and Rab7b-mediated transcriptional upregulation of megakaryocytic 
differentiation markers. Therefore, our data suggest that Rab7b may play 
important roles in megakaryopoiesis by activating NF-κB and promoting IL-6 
production. Our study also indicates that the IL-6-induced association of STAT3 
with GATA-1 may regulate megakaryocytic differentiation.
