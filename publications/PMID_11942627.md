The DNA methylation pattern is reprogrammed in embryonic germ cells. In female 
germ cells, the short-form DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1, which is an alternative 
isoform specifically expressed in growing oocytes, plays a crucial role in 
maintaining imprinted genes. To evaluate the contribution of Dnmt1 to the DNA 
methylation in male germ cells, the expression profiles of Dnmt1 in embryonic 
gonocytes were investigated. We detected a significant expression of Dnmt1 in 
primordial germ cells in 12.5-14.5 day postcoitum (dpc) embryos. The expression 
of Dnmt1 was downregulated after 14.5 dpc after which almost no Dnmt1 was 
detected in gonocytes prepared from 18.5 dpc embryos. The short-form Dnmt1 also 
was not detected in the 16.5-18.5 dpc gonocytes. On the other hand, Dnmt1 was 
constantly detected in Sertoli cells at 12.5-18.5 dpc. The expression profiles 
of Dnmt1 were similar to that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a 
marker for proliferating cells, suggesting that Dnmt1 was specifically expressed 
in the proliferating male germ cells. Inversely, genome-wide DNA methylation 
occurred after germ cell proliferation was arrested, when the Dnmt1 expression 
was downregulated. The present results indicate that not Dnmt1 but some other 
type of DNA methyltransferase contributes to the creation of DNA methylation 
patterns in male germ cells.
