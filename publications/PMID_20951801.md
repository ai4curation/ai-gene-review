Notch signaling is essential for proper cardiac development. We recently 
identified missense variants in the NOTCH1 receptor in patients with diverse 
left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) malformations (NOTCH1(G661S) and 
NOTCH1(A683T)) that reduce ligand-induced Notch signaling. Here, we examine the 
molecular mechanisms that contribute to reduced signaling and perturbed 
development. We find that NOTCH1(A683T) exhibits reduced S1 cleavage due to 
impaired trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This observation is 
consistent with improper localization of the variant receptor to the ER and 
decreased presentation at the cell surface. In contrast, the nearby mutation 
NOTCH1(G661S) exhibits reduced cell-surface presentation in the absence of overt 
folding or trafficking defects. To examine the implications of these variants in 
disease pathogenesis, we investigated their effect on epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), a critical process for development of the outflow tract. We 
find that these LVOT-associated NOTCH1 alleles can contribute to defective EMT 
in endothelial cell lines through impaired induction of Snail and Hes family 
members. These data represent the first description of a molecular mechanism 
underlying NOTCH1 mutations in individuals with LVOT malformations, and have 
important implications regarding the functional contribution of these alleles to 
a complex set of developmental defects.
