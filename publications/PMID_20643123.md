The mammalian class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K-III) complex 
regulates fundamental cellular functions, including growth factor receptor 
degradation, cytokinesis and autophagy. Recent studies suggest the existence of 
distinct PI3K-III sub-complexes that can potentially confer functional 
specificity. While a substantial body of work has focused on the roles of 
individual PI3K-III subunits in autophagy, functional studies on their 
contribution to endocytic receptor downregulation and cytokinesis are limited. 
We therefore sought to elucidate the specific nature of the PI3K-III complexes 
involved in these two processes. High-content microscopy-based assays combined 
with siRNA-mediated depletion of individual subunits indicated that a specific 
sub-complex containing VPS15, VPS34, Beclin 1, UVRAG and BIF-1 regulates both 
receptor degradation and cytokinesis, whereas ATG14L, a PI3K-III subunit 
involved in autophagy, is not required. The unanticipated role of UVRAG and 
BIF-1 in cytokinesis was supported by a strong localisation of these proteins to 
the midbody. Importantly, while the tumour suppressive functions of Beclin 1, 
UVRAG and BIF-1 have previously been ascribed to their roles in autophagy, these 
results open the possibility that they may also contribute to tumour suppression 
via downregulation of mitogenic signalling by growth factor receptors or 
preclusion of aneuploidy by ensuring faithful completion of cell division.
