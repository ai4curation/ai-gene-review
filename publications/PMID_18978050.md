Formation of the Escherichia coli division septum is catalyzed by a number of 
essential proteins (named Fts) that assemble into a ring-like structure at the 
future division site. Many of these Fts proteins are intrinsic transmembrane 
proteins whose functions are largely unknown. In the present study, we attempted 
to identify a novel putative component(s) of the E. coli cell division machinery 
by searching for proteins that could interact with known Fts proteins. To do 
that, we used a bacterial two-hybrid system based on interaction-mediated 
reconstitution of a cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling cascade to perform a library 
screening in order to find putative partners of E. coli cell division protein 
FtsL. Here we report the characterization of YmgF, a 72-residue integral 
membrane protein of unknown function that was found to associate with many E. 
coli cell division proteins and to localize to the E. coli division septum in an 
FtsZ-, FtsA-, FtsQ-, and FtsN-dependent manner. Although YmgF was previously 
shown to be not essential for cell viability, we found that when overexpressed, 
YmgF was able to overcome the thermosensitive phenotype of the ftsQ1(Ts) 
mutation and restore its viability under low-osmolarity conditions. Our results 
suggest that YmgF might be a novel component of the E. coli cell division 
machinery.
