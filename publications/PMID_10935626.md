Notch receptors function in highly conserved intercellular signalling pathways 
that direct cell-fate decisions, proliferation and apoptosis in metazoans. 
Fringe proteins can positively and negatively modulate the ability of Notch 
ligands to activate the Notch receptor. Here we establish the biochemical 
mechanism of Fringe action. Drosophila and mammalian Fringe proteins possess a 
fucose-specific beta1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity that initiates 
elongation of O-linked fucose residues attached to epidermal growth factor-like 
sequence repeats of Notch. We obtained biological evidence that Fringe-dependent 
elongation of O-linked fucose on Notch modulates Notch signalling by using 
co-culture assays in mammalian cells and by expression of an enzymatically 
inactive Fringe mutant in Drosophila. The post-translational modification of 
Notch by Fringe represents a striking example of modulation of a signalling 
event by differential receptor glycosylation and identifies a mechanism that is 
likely to be relevant to other signalling pathways.
