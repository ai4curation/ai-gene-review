The human deubiquitinases USP12 and USP46 are very closely related paralogs with 
critical functions as tumor suppressors. The catalytic activity of these enzymes 
is regulated by two cofactors: UAF1 and WDR20. USP12 and USP46 show nearly 90% 
amino acid sequence identity and share some cellular activities, but have also 
evolved non-overlapping functions. We hypothesized that, correlating with their 
functional divergence, the subcellular localization of USP12 and USP46 might be 
differentially regulated by their cofactors. We used confocal and live 
microscopy analyses of epitope-tagged proteins to determine the effect of UAF1 
and WDR20 on the localization of USP12 and USP46. We found that WDR20 
differently modulated the localization of the DUBs, promoting recruitment of 
USP12, but not USP46, to the plasma membrane. Using site-directed mutagenesis, 
we generated a large set of USP12 and WDR20 mutants to characterize in detail 
the mechanisms and sequence determinants that modulate the subcellular 
localization of the USP12/UAF1/WDR20 complex. Our data suggest that the 
USP12/UAF1/WDR20 complex dynamically shuttles between the plasma membrane, 
cytoplasm and nucleus. This shuttling involved active nuclear export mediated by 
the CRM1 pathway, and required a short N-terminal motif (1MEIL4) in USP12, as 
well as a novel nuclear export sequence (450MDGAIASGVSKFATLSLHD468) in WDR20. In 
conclusion, USP12 and USP46 have evolved divergently in terms of cofactor 
binding-regulated subcellular localization. WDR20 plays a crucial role in as a 
"targeting subunit" that modulates CRM1-dependent shuttling of the 
USP12/UAF1/WDR20 complex between the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus.
