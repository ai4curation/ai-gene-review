Inhibition of protein synthesis during heat shock limits accumulation of 
unfolded proteins that might damage eukaryotic cells. We demonstrate that 
chaperone Hsp27 is a heat shock-induced inhibitor of cellular protein synthesis. 
Translation of most mRNAs requires formation of a cap-binding initiation complex 
known as eIF4F, consisting of factors eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF4E kinase Mnk1, 
poly(A)-binding protein, and adaptor protein eIF4G. Hsp27 specifically bound 
eIF4G during heat shock, preventing assembly of the cap-initiation/eIF4F complex 
and trapping eIF4G in insoluble heat shock granules. eIF4G is a specific target 
of Hsp27, as eIF4E, eIF4A, Mnk1, poly(A)-binding protein, eIF4B, and eIF3 were 
not bound by Hsp27 and were not recruited into insoluble complexes. Dissociation 
of eIF4F was enhanced during heat shock by ectopic overexpression of Hsp25, the 
murine homolog of human Hsp27. Overexpression of Hsc70, a constitutive homolog 
of Hsp70, prevented loss of cap-initiation complexes and maintained eIF4G 
solubility. Purified Hsp27 specifically bound purified eIF4G in vitro, prevented 
in vitro translation, eliminated eIF4G interaction with protein binding factors, 
and promoted eIF4G insolubilization. These results therefore demonstrate that 
Hsp27 is a heat-induced inhibitor of eIF4F-dependent mRNA translation.
