The inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs) play a critical role in the 
regulation of apoptosis by binding and inhibiting caspases. Reaper family 
proteins and Smac/DIABLO use a conserved amino-terminal sequence to bind to IAPs 
in flies and mammals, respectively, blocking their ability to inhibit caspases 
and thus promoting apoptosis. Here we have identified the serine protease 
Omi/HtrA2 as a second mammalian XIAP-binding protein with a Reaper-like motif. 
This protease autoprocesses to form a protein with amino-terminal homology to 
Smac/DIABLO and Reaper family proteins. Full-length Omi/HtrA2 is localized to 
mitochondria but fails to interact with XIAP. Mitochondria also contain 
processed Omi/HtrA2, which, following apoptotic insult, translocates to the 
cytosol, where it interacts with XIAP. Overexpression of Omi/HtrA2 sensitizes 
cells to apoptosis, and its removal by RNA interference reduces cell death. 
Omi/HtrA2 thus extends the set of mammalian proteins with Reaper-like function 
that are released from the mitochondria during apoptosis.
