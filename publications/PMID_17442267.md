Mutations in Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the leading genetic cause 
of Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 is predicted to contain kinase and GTPase 
enzymatic domains, with recent evidence suggesting that the kinase activity of 
LRRK2 is central to the pathogenic process associated with this protein. The 
GTPase domain of LRRK2 plays an important role in the regulation of kinase 
activity. To investigate how the GTPase domain might be related to disease, we 
examined the GTP binding and hydrolysis properties of wild type and a mutant 
form of LRRK2. We show that LRRK2 immunoprecipitated from cells has a detectable 
GTPase activity that is disrupted by a familial mutation associated with PD 
located within the GTPase domain, R1441C.
