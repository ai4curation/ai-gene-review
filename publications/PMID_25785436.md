We have recently shown that a critical regulatory node in the platelet signaling 
network lies immediately downstream of platelet receptors for thrombin and TxA2. 
This node is comprised of a scaffold protein (spinophilin, SPL), a protein 
tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1), and either of the two members of the Regulators of 
G protein Signaling family predominantly expressed in platelets (RGS10 or 
RGS18). The SPL/RGS/SHP-1 complex is present in resting platelets, dissociating 
when thrombin or TxA2, but not ADP or collagen, activate SHP-1 and release RGS10 
and RGS18 to dampen signaling. Here we demonstrate an additional regulatory role 
for spinophilin, showing that dissociation of SHP-1 from spinophilin is followed 
by an increase in the binding of spinophilin to PP1, a serine/threonine 
phosphatase whose binding site maps to a region close to the SHP-1 binding site. 
The increase in PP1 binding to spinophilin is limited to platelet agonists that 
cause dissociation of the complex and is selective for the α and γ isoforms of 
PP1. Studies in cell culture show that SHP-1 and PP1 can compete for binding to 
spinophilin and that binding inhibits PP1 activity since over-expression of wild 
type spinophilin, but not spinophilin with a disabled PP1 binding site, causes 
an increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain, a well-characterized 
PP1 substrate. Collectively, these results indicate that in addition to 
regulating RGS protein availability in resting platelets, spinophilin can serve 
as a time-dependent, agonist- and isoform-selective regulator of PP1, inhibiting 
its activity when decay of the SPL/RGS/SHP-1 complex releases SHP-1 from 
spinophilin, exposing a binding site for PP1.
