Tankyrase (TANK1) is a human telomere-associated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 
(PARP) that binds the telomere-binding protein TRF1 and increases telomere 
length when overexpressed. Here we report characterization of a second human 
tankyrase, tankyrase 2 (TANK2), which can also interact with TRF1 but has 
properties distinct from those of TANK1. TANK2 is encoded by a 66-kilobase pair 
gene (TNKS2) containing 28 exons, which express a 6.7-kilobase pair mRNA and a 
1166-amino acid protein. The protein shares 85% amino acid identity with TANK1 
in the ankyrin repeat, sterile alpha-motif, and PARP catalytic domains but has a 
unique N-terminal domain, which is conserved in the murine TNKS2 gene. TANK2 
interacted with TRF1 in yeast and in vitro and localized predominantly to a 
perinuclear region, similar to the properties of TANK1. In contrast to TANK1, 
however, TANK2 caused rapid cell death when highly overexpressed. TANK2-induced 
death featured loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, but not PARP1 cleavage, 
suggesting that TANK2 kills cells by necrosis. The cell death was prevented by 
the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide. In vivo, TANK2 may differ from TANK1 in its 
intrinsic or regulated PARP activity or its substrate specificity.
