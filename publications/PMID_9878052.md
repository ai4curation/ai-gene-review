The functional coupling of protein synthesis and chaperone-assisted folding in 
vivo has remained largely unexplored. Here we have analysed the 
chaperonin-dependent folding pathway of actin in yeast. Remarkably, 
overexpression of a heterologous chaperonin which traps non-native polypeptides 
does not interfere with protein folding in the cytosol, indicating a high-level 
organization of folding reactions. Newly synthesized actin avoids the chaperonin 
trap and is effectively channelled from the ribosome to the endogenous 
chaperonin TRiC. Efficient actin folding on TRiC is critically dependent on the 
hetero-oligomeric co-chaperone GimC. By interacting with folding intermediates 
and with TRiC, GimC accelerates actin folding at least 5-fold and prevents the 
premature release of non-native protein from TRiC. We propose that TRiC and GimC 
form an integrated 'folding compartment' which functions in cooperation with the 
translation machinery. This compartment sequesters newly synthesized actin and 
other aggregation-sensitive polypeptides from the crowded macromolecular 
environment of the cytosol, thereby allowing their efficient folding.
