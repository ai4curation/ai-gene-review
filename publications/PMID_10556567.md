The kinetic mechanism of action of Draculin on activated Factor X (FXa) is 
established. Draculin inhibits activated Factor X within seconds of incubation 
at near equimolar concentration (2-6 times on molar basis). Fitting the data to 
the equation for a tight-binding inhibitor gives a value for K(i)(K(d)) = 
14.8+/-1.5 nM. The formation of the Draculin-FXa complex can be explained by a 
two-step mechanism, where for the first, reversible step, k(on) = 1.117 (+/- 
0.169, S.E.M.) x 10(6) M(-1)s(-1) and k(off) = 15.388 (+/- 1.672) x 10(-3) 
s(-1), while for the second, irreversible step, which is 
concentration-independent, k(2) = 0.072 s(-1). K(d) obtained from k(off)/k(on) = 
13.76 nM. Lineweaver-Burk plot shows a noncompetitive behavior. This 
noncompetitive mode of inhibition of Draculin is supported by the observation 
that Draculin, at concentrations giving complete inhibition, does not impair 
binding of p-aminobenzamidine to FXa. Moreover, under the same conditions, 
Draculin induces <14% decrease of the fluorescence intensity of the 
p-aminobenzamidine-FXa complex. We conclude that Draculin is a noncompetitive, 
tight-binding inhibitor of FXa, a characteristic so far unique amongst natural 
FXa inhibitors.
