Abstract

The mammalian respiratory system, consisting of both trachea and lung, initiates from the foregut endoderm. The molecular program that instructs endodermal cells to adopt the respiratory fate is not fully understood. Here we show that conditional inactivation of β- Catenin (also termed Ctnnb1 ) in foregut endoderm leads to absence of both the trachea and lung due to a failure in maintaining the respiratory fate. In converse, conditional expression of an activated form of β- Catenin leads to expansion of Nkx2.1 , an early marker for the trachea and lung, into adjacent endoderm including the stomach epithelium. Analyses of these mutants show that the loss or gain of trachea/lung progenitor identity is accompanied by an expansion or contraction of esophagus/stomach progenitor identity, respectively. Our findings reveal an early role for β- Catenin in the establishment of respiratory progenitors in mouse foregut endoderm.

Discussion

Genetic evidence from both the β- Cat cko and β- Cat act mutants establishes β-Catenin as a key player responsible for initiating the respiratory development program. We show that respiratory progenitor identity is not maintained in β- Cat cko mutants, while it is ectopically induced in β- Cat act mutants. Neither of these phenotypes can be explained by changes in cell proliferation and/or cell survival in these mutants. Rather, the coordinated up or down-regulations of NKX2.1 versus SOX2 in the early foregut endoderm of these mutants support a role of β-Catenin in controlling the balance between the respiratory (trachea/lung) versus digestive (esophagus/stomach) progenitor identities.

This role is consistent with the function of β-Catenin in adult lung stem cells in mice. Recent studies show that conditional activation of β-Catenin in adult lung epithelium leads to an increase in bronchioalveolar stem cell (BASC) number ( 34 , 35 ). Further analysis of these adult mutant lungs show that there is no change in cell proliferation that would account for the phenotype, similar to our finding in β- Cat act embryonic foregut. Rather, the increase of BASCs in the adult mutant lungs is due to the ability of β-Catenin in maintaining these cells in the progenitor state ( 34 ). This finding and our data together suggest that β-Catenin promotes respiratory progenitor characteristics both during lung initiation in the fetal lung and in stem cell maintenance in the adult lung.

In addition to being a key mediator of canonical WNT signaling, β-Catenin has also been implicated in cell adhesion events independent of WNT signaling ( 36 ). Although our data do not exclude the possibility that β-Catenin functions outside of the WNT pathway to promote respiratory progenitors, three lines of evidence suggest that β-Catenin likely acts as a WNT mediator in this process. First, we and others have found that Wnt2 and Wnt2b are expressed in the mesenchyme adjacent to the respiratory primordium ( Fig. 1 A–C ) ( 15 , 23 ). Second, we show that Axin2-lacZ , a WNT reporter, is active in the ventral foregut ( Fig. 1 D–F ), possibly as a result of WNT2/2b signaling. This result indicates that canonical WNT signaling is active in the prospective respiratory region. Third, recent data from Dr. Morrisey's laboratory show that mice homozygous for null alleles of both Wnt2 and Wnt2b exhibit a specific loss of trachea/lung, resembling the phenotype in β- Cat cko mutants (personal communication). These data together suggest that WNT2 and WNT2b likely function through β-Catenin to promote respiratory progenitor identity in the foregut endoderm.

This role of WNT/β-Catenin signaling is unexpected based on recent findings from zebrafish and Xenopus studies. In zebrafish, it was shown that a mutation in Wnt2b leads to a delay/reduction in liver specification with no other morphological defects ( 33 ). Our conditional β- Cat cko mutants do not allow us to address the requirement for β-Catenin in liver specification in mouse, as Shh cre only recombines in sporadic cells in the liver ( Fig. 1 J ). However, in Wnt2 ; Wnt2b null mutants (E. Morrisey, personal communication), the liver is present, even though trachea and lung are absent. This result indicates that in the mouse foregut, WNT2 signaling is required for the establishment of the respiratory, but not the liver lineage. Furthermore, in our β- Cat act mouse mutants, the liver marker Hex is not ectopically expressed as a result of β-Catenin activation, unlike Nkx2.1 . These data suggest that in the mouse foregut, WNT/β-Catenin signaling promotes respiratory, but not liver fate. We speculate that the differences in the findings from mouse and zebrafish may be due to distinct requirements for β-Catenin in the foregut of these organisms. Previous studies show that RA signaling is essential for specifying the pancreas in zebrafish, but not in mouse ( 37 – 39 ), providing precedence that there are species-specific requirements in the molecular mechanisms essential for organ initiation.

Findings from a recent Xenopus study also appear to differ from our results in mice. In Xenopus , it was shown that WNT-induced activation of β-Catenin signaling in the endoderm leads to reduction of markers for all foregut organs including the lung, liver and pancreas ( 40 ). This result is different from the phenotype in β- Cat act mouse mutants, and could reflect species-specific control of organ formation. An alternative explanation is that β-Catenin may play different roles at distinct stages of lung development. In the Xenopus study, β-Catenin activation is induced at the gastrula stage during the emergence of the endoderm. However in our study, we manipulate β-Catenin function after the establishment of foregut endoderm. At an even later time window during lung branching morphogenesis, overexpression of a constitutively active β-Catenin-Lef1 fusion protein leads to transformation from lung to intestinal fates ( 26 ). This finding further supports context-dependence of β-Catenin function in the foregut.

Our data also emphasize the view that this crucial contribution of β-Catenin to respiratory development is dependent on additional players in the foregut. Results from β- Cat act mutants show that activated β-Catenin induces Nkx2.1 in the anterior, but not posterior stomach. This boundary coincides with many molecular and cellular differences that have been documented in these two regions of the stomach ( 41 ), and suggest that some of these differences may account for distinct responses to activated β-Catenin protein. Furthermore, in the anterior stomach of β- Cat act mutants, even though activated β-Catenin induces respiratory progenitor characteristics, it does not direct later steps of lung development, including lung budding morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation. It is likely that additional obligatory partners in the endoderm and/or signals from the mesenchyme are required to implement the remainder of the respiratory program. For example, FGF10 signaling is essential for lung budding morphogenesis ( 8 , 9 ). Fgf10 is expressed at a low level in the anterior stomach compared to surrounding regions of the mouse foregut ( 42 ). This raises the possibility that in the anterior stomach of β- Cat act mutants, the amount of FGF10 present may not be sufficient to drive budding following ectopic induction of Nkx2.1 . Our findings that β-Catenin is capable of inducing early respiratory progenitor identity, and is required to maintain this identify demonstrate that β-Catenin functions at or near the top of the genetic hierarchy that executes the lung development program. Thus discovery and characterization of the partners and targets of β-Catenin in the context of respiratory initiation will be an informative future direction of research.
