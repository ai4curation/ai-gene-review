Human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) derived from the developing brain can be 
expanded in culture and subsequently differentiated into neurons and glia. They 
provide an interesting source of tissue for both modeling brain development and 
developing future cellular replacement therapies. It is becoming clear that hNPC 
are regionally and temporally specified depending on which brain region they 
were isolated from and its developmental stage. We show here that hNPC derived 
from the developing cortex (hNPC(CTX)) and ventral midbrain (hNPC(VM)) have 
similar morphological characteristics and express the progenitor cell marker 
nestin. However, hNPC(CTX) cultures were highly proliferative and produced large 
numbers of neurons, whereas hNPC(VM) divided slowly and produced fewer neurons 
but more astrocytes. Microarray analysis revealed a similar expression pattern 
for some stemness markers between the two growing cultures, overlaid with a 
regionally specific profile that identified some important differentially 
expressed neurogenic transcription factors. By overexpressing one of these, the 
transcription factor ASCL1, we were able to regain neurogenesis from hNPC(VM) 
cultures, which produced larger neurons with more neurites than hNPC(CTX) but no 
fully mature dopamine neurons. Thus, hNPC are regionally specified and can be 
induced to undergo neurogenesis following genetic manipulation. Although this 
restores neuronal production with a region-specific phenotype, it does not 
restore full neurochemical maturation, which may require additional factors.
