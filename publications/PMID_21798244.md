α-Synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
Although it is highly conserved, its physiological function has not yet been 
elucidated in detail. In an effort to define the function of α-synuclein, 
interacting proteins were screened in phage display assays. Prenylated Rab 
acceptor protein 1 (PRA1) was identified as an interacting partner. A selective 
interaction between α-synuclein and PRA1 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation 
and GST pull-down assays. PRA1 and α-synuclein were colocalized in N2a neuronal 
cells. Cotransfection of α-synuclein and PRA1 caused vesicles to accumulate in 
the periphery of the cytosol in neuronal cells, suggesting that overexpression 
of α-synuclein hinders proper vesicle trafficking and recycling as a result of 
the interaction between α-synuclein and PRA1.
