The calcineurin A (CaNA) subunit was identified as a novel binding partner of 
plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1). CaN is a Ca(2+)-dependent 
phosphatase involved in many cellular functions, including cardiac hypertrophy. 
Direct binding of CaN to the (715)PVITID(720) sequence of NHE1, which resembles 
the consensus CaN-binding motif (PXIXIT), was observed. Overexpression of NHE1 
promoted serum-induced CaN/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling 
in fibroblasts, as indicated by enhancement of NFAT promoter activity and 
nuclear translocation, which was attenuated by NHE1 inhibitor. In neonatal rat 
cardiomyocytes, NHE1 stimulated hypertrophic gene expression and the NFAT 
pathway, which were inhibited by a CaN inhibitor, FK506. Importantly, CaN 
activity was strongly enhanced with increasing pH, so NHE1 may promote CaN/NFAT 
signaling via increased intracellular pH. Indeed, Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity 
was required for NHE1-dependent NFAT signaling. Moreover, interaction of CaN 
with NHE1 and clustering of NHE1 to lipid rafts were also required for this 
response. Based on these results, we propose that NHE1 activity may generate a 
localized membrane microdomain with higher pH, thereby sensitizing CaN to 
activation and promoting NFAT signaling. In cardiomyocytes, such signaling can 
be a pathway of NHE1-dependent hypertrophy.
