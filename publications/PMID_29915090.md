The mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP) catalyzes three reactions in the 
fatty acid β-oxidation process. Mutations in the two TFP subunits cause 
mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency and acute fatty liver of 
pregnancy that can lead to death. Here we report a 4.2-Å cryo-electron 
microscopy α2β2 tetrameric structure of the human TFP. The tetramer has a 
V-shaped architecture that displays a distinct assembly compared with the 
bacterial TFPs. A concave surface of the TFP tetramer interacts with the 
detergent molecules in the structure, suggesting that this region is involved in 
associating with the membrane. Deletion of a helical hairpin in TFPβ decreases 
its binding to the liposomes in vitro and reduces its membrane targeting in 
cells. Our results provide the structural basis for TFP function and have 
important implications for fatty acid oxidation related diseases.
