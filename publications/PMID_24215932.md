The anti-NeuN antibody has been widely used for over 15 years to unambiguously 
identify post-mitotic neurons in the central nervous system of a wide variety of 
vertebrates including mice, rats and humans. In contrast to its widely reported 
nuclear localization, we found significantly higher NeuN reactivity in the 
cytoplasm of neurons in brain sections from HIV-infected individuals with 
cognitive impairment compared to controls. The protein target of anti-NeuN 
antisera was recently identified as the neuron-specific RNA splicing factor, 
Rbfox3, but its significance in diseases affecting the brain has not been 
previously reported. RNA splicing occurs in the nucleus hence, the altered 
localization of RbFox3 to the cytoplasm may lead to the downregulation of 
neuronal gene expression.
