Inductive reciprocal signaling between mesenchymal and adjacent epithelia gives 
rise to skin appendages such as hair follicles and mammary glands. Lef1-mediated 
canonical Wnt signaling is required for morphogenesis of these skin appendages 
during embryogenesis. In order to define the role of canonical Wnt signaling 
during early embryonic mammary gland development, we determined the temporal and 
spatial changes in Wnt signaling during embryogenesis in wild-type and 
Lef1-deficient embryos harboring a Tcf/Lef1-betagal reporter (TOPGAL) transgene. 
In contrast to previous studies using TOPGAL mice from a distinct founder, we 
observe that Wnt signaling acts initially on mesenchymal cells associated with 
the sequential appearance of mammary placodes. As placode development progresses 
between 12.5 and 15.5 dpc, Wnt signaling progressively accumulates in the 
mammary epithelial compartment. By 18.5 dpc, betagal activity is confined to 
mesenchymal and epithelial cells near the nipple region. In Lef1-deficient 
embryos, the transition of Wnt signaling from mesenchyme to the mammary 
epithelia is blocked for placodes #1, 4 and 5 despite the expression of Tcf1 in 
epithelial cells. These placodes ultimately disappear by 15.5 dpc, while 
placodes 2 and 3 typically did not form in the absence of Lef1. Progressive loss 
of placodes 1, 4, and 5 is accompanied by increased apoptosis in mesenchymal 
cells adjacent to the mammary epithelial placodes. While factors important for 
embryonic mammary gland development, such as FGF7, are expressed normally in 
Lef1-deficient animals, one mediator of the Hedgehog (Hh)-signaling pathway is 
aberrantly expressed. Specifically, Shh, Ihh, and Gli2 are expressed in mammary 
epithelial cells at levels in Lef1-deficient animals similar to wild-type 
littermates. However, the signal for Ptc-1 is strongly reduced in mesenchymal 
cells surrounding the mammary placode in Lef1 mutants relative to wild-type 
embryos. The loss of Ptc-1, both a receptor for and transcriptional target of Hh 
signaling, suggests that Hh signaling is blocked in Lef1-deficient embryos. 
Thus, these data reveal distinct requirements of different mammary placodes for 
Lef1-dependent Wnt signaling. They further define dynamic changes in which cells 
integrate Lef1-dependent Wnt signaling during progression of embryonic mammary 
gland development.
