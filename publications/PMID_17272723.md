Acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3-K56) occurs in S phase, and cells 
lacking H3-K56 acetylation are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents. However, the 
histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that catalyzes global H3-K56 acetylation has not 
been found. Here we show that regulation of Ty1 transposition gene product 109 
(Rtt109) is an H3-K56 HAT. Cells lacking Rtt109 or expressing rtt109 mutants 
with alterations at a conserved aspartate residue lose H3-K56 acetylation and 
exhibit increased sensitivity toward genotoxic agents, as well as elevated 
levels of spontaneous chromosome breaks. Thus, Rtt109, which shares no sequence 
homology with any other known HATs, is a unique HAT that acetylates H3-K56.
