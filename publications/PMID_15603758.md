Mammalian cells exhibit complex, but intricate cellular responses to genotoxic 
stress, including cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair and apoptosis. Inactivation 
of these important biological events may result in genomic instability and cell 
transformation, as well as alterations of therapeutic sensitivity. Gadd45a, a 
p53- and BRCA1-regulated stress-inducible gene, has been characterized as one of 
the important players that participate in cellular response to a variety of DNA 
damage agents. Interestingly, the signaling machinery that regulates Gadd45a 
induction by genotoxic stress involves both p53-dependent and -independent 
pathways; the later may employ BRCA1-related or MAP kinase-mediated signals. 
Gadd45a protein has been reported to interact with multiple important cellular 
proteins, including Cdc2 protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA), p21Waf1/Cip1 protein, core histone protein and MTK/MEKK4, an up-stream 
activator of the JNK/SAPK pathway, indicating that Gadd45a may play important 
roles in the control of cell cycle checkpoint, DNA repair process, and signaling 
transduction. The importance of Gadd45a in maintaining genomic integrity is well 
manifested by the demonstration that disruption of endogenous Gadd45a in mice 
results in genomic instability and increased carcinogenesis. Therefore, Gadd45a 
appears to be an important component in the cellular defense network that is 
required for maintenance of genomic stability.
