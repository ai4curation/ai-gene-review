Expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mRNAs splice forms was 
recently shown to be stimulated by myofibrillar proteins released from the 
damaged muscle. In this study, we report that individual subfragments of titin 
and myomesin composed of Fn type III and Ig-like domains can activate expression 
of two IGF-1 splice forms in cultured myoblasts, both at protein and mRNA 
levels. Competition studies showed that each of the domain-types interacts with 
its own receptor. Induction of IGF-1 expression caused by domains of different 
types showed dissimilar sensitivity to inhibitors of regulatory cascades. The 
effect of Fn type III domains was more sensitive to inhibition of 
Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent protein kinase, whereas the effect of Ig-like 
domains showed greater sensitivity to the inhibition of the adenylyl 
cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathway.
