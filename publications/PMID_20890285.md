The detection of intracellular microbial DNA is critical to appropriate innate 
immune responses; however, knowledge of how such DNA is sensed is limited. Here 
we identify IFI16, a PYHIN protein, as an intracellular DNA sensor that mediates 
the induction of interferon-β (IFN-β). IFI16 directly associated with 
IFN-β-inducing viral DNA motifs. STING, a critical mediator of IFN-β responses 
to DNA, was recruited to IFI16 after DNA stimulation. Lowering the expression of 
IFI16 or its mouse ortholog p204 by RNA-mediated interference inhibited gene 
induction and activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB induced by 
DNA and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). IFI16 (p204) is the first PYHIN 
protein to our knowledge shown to be involved in IFN-β induction. Thus, the 
PYHIN proteins IFI16 and AIM2 form a new family of innate DNA sensors we call 
'AIM2-like receptors' (ALRs).
