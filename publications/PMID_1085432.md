Malignant lymphoma and rheumatic symptoms.

Nilsen KH.

A patient intially thought to have a connective tissue disease, later shown by 
biopsy to have Hodgkin's disease is described. The progress of her illness 
suggests that she is suffering from a connective tissue disease, too, or 
possibly secondary immune complex disease.
