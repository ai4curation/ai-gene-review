Very little is known about how animals discriminate pathogens from innocuous 
microbes. To address this question, we examined infection-response gene 
induction in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We focused on genes that are 
induced in C. elegans by infection with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, but are not induced by an isogenic attenuated gacA mutant. Most of 
these genes are induced independently of known immunity pathways. We generated a 
GFP reporter for one of these genes, infection response gene 1 (irg-1), which is 
induced strongly by wild-type P. aeruginosa strain PA14, but not by other C. 
elegans pathogens or by other wild-type P. aeruginosa strains that are weakly 
pathogenic to C. elegans. To identify components of the pathway that induces 
irg-1 in response to infection, we performed an RNA interference screen of C. 
elegans transcription factors. This screen identified zip-2, a bZIP 
transcription factor that is required for inducing irg-1, as well as several 
other genes, and is important for defense against infection by P. aeruginosa. 
These data indicate that zip-2 is part of a specialized pathogen response 
pathway that is induced by virulent strains of P. aeruginosa and provides 
defense against this pathogen.
