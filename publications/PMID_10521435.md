Hsp70 family members together with their Hsp40 cochaperones function as 
molecular chaperones, using an ATP-controlled cycle of polypeptide binding and 
release to mediate protein folding. Hsp40 plays a key role in the chaperone 
reaction by stimulating the ATPase activity and activating the substrate binding 
of Hsp70. We have explored the interaction between the Escherichia coli Hsp70 
family member, DnaK, and its cochaperone partner DnaJ. Our data show that the 
binding of ATP, subsequent conformational changes in DnaK, and DnaJ-stimulated 
ATP hydrolysis are all required for the formation of a DnaK-DnaJ complex as 
monitored by Biacore analysis. In addition, our data imply that the interaction 
of the J-domain with DnaK depends on the substrate binding state of DnaK.
