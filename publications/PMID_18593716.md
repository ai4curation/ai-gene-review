Congenital aortic valve stenosis (AVS), coarctation of the aorta (COA) and 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) are congenital cardiovascular 
malformations that all involve the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). They 
are presumably caused by a similar developmental mechanism involving the 
developing endothelium. The exact etiology for most LVOT malformations is 
unknown, but a strong genetic component has been established. We demonstrate 
here that mutations in the gene NOTCH1, coding for a receptor in a 
developmentally important signaling pathway, are found across the spectrum of 
LVOT defects. We identify two specific mutations that reduce ligand (JAGGED1) 
induced NOTCH1 signaling. One of these mutations perturbs the S1 cleavage of the 
receptor in the Golgi. These findings suggest that the levels of NOTCH1 
signaling are tightly regulated during cardiovascular development, and that 
relatively minor alterations may promote LVOT defects. These results also 
establish for the first time that AVS, COA and HLHS can share a common 
pathogenetic mechanism at the molecular level, explaining observations of these 
defects co-occurring within families.
