Members of the evolutionarily conserved Mastermind (MAM) protein family, 
including the three related mammalian Mastermind-like (MAML) proteins MAML1-3, 
function as crucial coactivators of Notch-mediated transcriptional activation. 
Given the recent evidence of cross-talk between the p53 and Notch signal 
transduction pathways, we have investigated whether MAML1 may also be a 
transcriptional coactivator of p53. Indeed, we show here that MAML1 is able to 
interact with p53. We show that MAML1-p53 interaction involves the N-terminal 
region of MAML1 and the DNA-binding domain of p53, and we use a chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assay to show that MAML1 is part of the activator complex 
that binds to native p53-response elements within the promoter of the p53 target 
genes. Overexpression of wild-type MAML1 as well as a mutant, defective in Notch 
signaling, enhanced the p53-dependent gene induction in mammalian cells, whereas 
MAML1 knockdown reduced the p53-dependent gene expression. MAML1 increases the 
half-life of p53 protein and enhances its phosphorylation/acetylation upon DNA 
damage of cells. Finally, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the single 
Caenorhabditis elegans MAML homolog, Lag-3, led to substantial abrogation of 
p53-mediated germ-cell apoptotic response to DNA damage and markedly reduced the 
expression of Ced-13 and Egl-1, downstream pro-apoptotic targets of the C. 
elegans p53 homolog Cep-1. Thus, we present evidence for a novel coactivator 
function of MAML1 for p53, independent of its function as a coactivator of Notch 
signaling pathway.
