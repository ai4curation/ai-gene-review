Application of a differential hybridization technique led to the isolation of a 
human pituitary cDNA clone encoding the complete structure of the polypeptide 
7B2. This protein of unknown function, which is sorted to secretory granules, 
appears to be present selectively in neurons and endocrine cells. The 
polypeptide chain of human 7B2, preceded by a cleaved signal peptide, comprises 
185 amino acids (a calculated Mr of 20,793). Interesting features of the 
highly-conserved 7B2 structure include (i) a serine phosphorylation consensus 
sequence, (ii) the occurrence of three pairs of dibasic amino acids representing 
potential proteolytic cleavage sites and, in particular, (iii) the presence of 
three regions homologous to GTP-binding domains giving 7B2 structural 
characteristics of a GTP-binding protein.
