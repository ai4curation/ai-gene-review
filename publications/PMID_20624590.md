The psychiatric illness risk gene Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) plays an 
important role in brain development; however, it is unclear how DISC1 is 
regulated during cortical development. Here, we report that DISC1 is regulated 
during embryonic neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal migration through 
an interaction with DIX domain containing-1 (Dixdc1), the third mammalian gene 
discovered to contain a Disheveled-Axin (DIX) domain. We determined that Dixdc1 
functionally interacts with DISC1 to regulate neural progenitor proliferation by 
co-modulating Wnt-GSK3beta/beta-catenin signaling. However, DISC1 and Dixdc1 do 
not regulate migration via this pathway. During neuronal migration, we 
discovered that phosphorylation of Dixdc1 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) 
facilitates its interaction with the DISC1-binding partner Ndel1. Furthermore, 
Dixdc1 phosphorylation and its interaction with DISC1/Ndel1 in vivo is required 
for neuronal migration. Together, these data reveal that Dixdc1 integrates DISC1 
into Wnt-GSK3beta/beta-catenin-dependent and -independent signaling pathways 
during cortical development and further delineate how DISC1 contributes to 
neuropsychiatric disorders.
