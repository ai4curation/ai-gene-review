The Cdc28 protein kinase functions in the G1 to S phase transition of the cell 
cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is in contrast with 
observations of the homologous protein kinase from a variety of metazoans, where 
activity and function are associated with the G2 to M phase transition. We 
present evidence that the Cdc28 protein kinase is also required for mitosis and 
that this function is executed in the G2 interval of the cell cycle. We show, in 
addition, that the protein kinase is highly active during this phase of the cell 
cycle. The dual role of the Cdc28 protein kinase in the S. cerevisiae cell cycle 
thus parallels that demonstrated for the cdc2 protein kinase of the fission 
yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

Abstract

The Cdc28 protein kinase functions in the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is in contrast with observations of the homologous protein kinase from a variety of metazoans, where activity and function are associated with the G2 to M phase transition. We present evidence that the Cdc28 protein kinase is also required for mitosis and that this function is executed in the G2 interval of the cell cycle. We show, in addition, that the protein kinase is highly active during this phase of the cell cycle. The dual role of the Cdc28 protein kinase in the S. cerevisiae cell cycle thus parallels that demonstrated for the cdc2 protein kinase of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
