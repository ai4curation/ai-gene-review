Salmonella SpvC belongs to a new enzyme family designated phosphothreonine 
lyases that irreversibly inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinases. The 
crystal structure of SpvC reported here reveals that the two phosphorylated 
residues in the substrate peptide predominantly mediate its recognition by SpvC. 
Substrate-induced conformational changes in SpvC sequester the phosphothreonine 
in a completely solvent-free environment, preventing the hydrolysis of the 
phosphate group and facilitating the elimination reaction.
