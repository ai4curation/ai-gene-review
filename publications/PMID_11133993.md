The transferrin receptor (TfR) of reticulocytes is released in vesicular form 
(exosomes) during their maturation to erythrocytes. The heat shock cognate 
70-kDa protein (Hsc70) has been demonstrated to interact with the cytosolic 
domain of the TfR and could thus trigger the receptor toward this secretion 
pathway. We investigated the characteristics of the interaction between Hsc70 
and the TfR in exosomes with an in vitro binding assay using TfR immobilized on 
Sepharose beads and purified Hsc70. The results show that Hsc70 binds to 
exosomal TfR with characteristics expected of a chaperone/peptide interaction. 
We demonstrated that heat-denatured luciferase competed for in vitro binding, 
dependent on the nucleotide bound to Hsc70, and that this interaction activates 
the ATPase activity of Hsc70. Moreover, we used immunosuppressive agents that 
interact with Hsc70, thus decreasing Hsc70 binding to TfR in our in vitro 
binding assay and enabling us to assess the role of this interaction in vivo 
during reticulocyte maturation.
