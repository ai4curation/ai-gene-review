Mutations in the leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are responsible for 
autosomal dominant and sporadic Parkinson disease (PD), possibly exerting their 
effects via a toxic gain of function. A common p.G2019S mutation 
(rs34637584:A>G) is responsible for up to 30-40% of PD cases in some ethnic 
populations. Here, we show that LRRK2 interacts with human peroxiredoxin 3 
(PRDX3), a mitochondrial member of the antioxidant family of thioredoxin (Trx) 
peroxidases. Importantly, mutations in the LRRK2 kinase domain significantly 
increased phosphorylation of PRDX3 compared to wild-type. The increase in PRDX3 
phosphorylation was associated with decreased peroxidase activity and increased 
death in LRRK2-expressing but not in LRRK2-depleted or vector-transfected 
neuronal cells. LRRK2 mutants stimulated mitochondrial factors involved in 
apoptosis and induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative 
modification of macromolecules. Furthermore, immunoblot and immunohistochemical 
analysis of postmortem human PD patients carrying the p.G2019S mutation showed a 
marked increase in phosphorylated PRDX3 (p-PRDX3) relative to normal brain. We 
showed that LRRK2 mutations increase the inhibition of an endogenous peroxidase 
by phosphorylation promoting dysregulation of mitochondrial function and 
oxidative damage. Our findings provide a mechanistic link between the enhanced 
kinase activity of PD-linked LRRK2 and neuronal cell death.
