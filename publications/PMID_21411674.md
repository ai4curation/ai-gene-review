Some cases of autism spectrum disorder have mutations in the lipid phosphatase, 
phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (Pten). Tissue specific deletion 
of Pten in the hippocampus and cortex of mice causes anatomical and behavioral 
abnormalities similar to human autism. However, the impact of reductions in Pten 
on synaptic and circuit function remains unexplored. We used in vivo stereotaxic 
injections of lentivirus expressing a short hairpin RNA to knock down Pten in 
mouse neonatal and young adult dentate granule cells. We then assessed the 
morphology and synaptic physiology between 2 weeks and 4 months later. Confocal 
imaging of the hippocampus revealed a marked increase in granule cell size and 
an increase in dendritic spine density. The onset of morphological changes 
occurred earlier in neonatal mice than in young adults. We used whole-cell 
recordings from granule cells in acute slices to assess synaptic function after 
Pten knockdown. Consistent with the increase in dendritic spines, the frequency 
of excitatory miniature and spontaneous postsynaptic currents increased. 
However, there was little or no effect on IPSCs. Thus, Pten knockdown results in 
an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity. Because 
reductions in Pten affected mature granule cells as well as developing granule 
cells, we suggest that the disruption of circuit function by Pten hypofunction 
may be ongoing well beyond early development.

Introduction

The phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (Pten), catalyzes the reverse reaction of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Pten and PI3K are highly conserved throughout evolution and are expressed in all mammalian cell types. Although Pten-null mice die during embryogenesis ( Di Cristofano et al., 1998 ), conditional knock-out mice have provided insights into the role of Pten in the CNS. Depending on the targeted cell type, cells in Pten conditional knock-out mice display cellular mislocation, hypertrophy, and increased survival ( Groszer et al., 2001 ; Fraser et al., 2004 ). Conditional deletion of Pten in CNS neurons results in neuronal hypertrophy, macrocephaly, and abnormal social interaction ( Kwon et al., 2006 ). The macrocephaly that occurs in 20% of patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been attributed to Pten mutations ( Goffin et al., 2001 ; Butler et al., 2005 ; Buxbaum et al., 2007 ; Herman et al., 2007 ). Although multiple genes have been linked with ASD ( Bourgeron, 2009 ), Pten conditional knock-out mice are the first animal model of ASD that incorporate the morphological and behavioral abnormalities seen in human cases ( Greer and Wynshaw-Boris, 2006 ). The morphological deficits in neurons of Pten conditional mutant mice suggest a pattern of enhanced cellular growth, in keeping with the macroscopic increase in brain size seen in some cases of ASD.

Pten hypofunction may represent a prototype for examining perturbations of synaptic circuitry that are often considered as the fundamental abnormality in autism. Thus, to examine the cellular and synaptic phenotype of Pten deletion, we used a viral-based strategy that allows for precise temporal and spatial knockdown of Pten in vivo . After intrahippocampal injections of lentiviral particles, dentate granule cells targeted for Pten knockdown were identified by expression of a fluorescent marker. Analysis by immunohistochemistry, Western blots, and real-time PCR indicated a significant knockdown of Pten. Pten knockdown in neonatal mice [postnatal day 7 (P7)] increased soma size and dendritic spine density by 2 weeks after injection. In young adult mice (6–8 weeks), Pten knockdown resulted in a similar morphological phenotype that evolved by 4 months after injection. The frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents in Pten knockdown granule cells also increased. Our results suggest that Pten knockdown increases the net excitatory drive onto granule neurons in vivo .

Pten knockdown results in increased neuronal size and dendritic spine density

To determine the effects of viral-mediated Pten knockdown on single neurons in vivo , we infected granule cells in wild-type animals by injecting viruses driving expression of EGFP with or without Pten shRNA. We examined the impact of Pten knockdown in neonatal (P7) and young adult (6- to 8-week-old) mice. We selected P7 to determine the effects of developmental Pten knockdown because it is the peak of granule cell generation ( Bayer and Altman, 1974 ). After injections at P7, we detected a distinctive morphological phenotype at P21 (14 d after injection). The cross-sectional area of infected granule cells increased from 92.3 ± 1.2 μm 2 in GFP control to 113.4 ± 2.3 μm 2 after Pten knockdown ( Fig. 2 A ) ( p < 0.001, t test; n = 63 control, n = 52 Pten knockdown neurons; two animals per group). In addition, Pten knockdown neurons had thicker dendrites with more filopodial-like protrusions and aberrant protrusions extruding from existing spines in Pten knockdown granule cells ( Fig. 2 B ). The outer two-thirds of the molecular layer zone receive the major excitatory input from entorhinal cortex. We found an increase in the density of spines in this dendritic zone as quantified in the outer molecular layer within 100 μm of the dendritic tip ( Fig. 2 B ) (GFP control, 2.16 ± 0.10 spines/μm; Pten shRNA, 2.52 ± 0.09 spines/μm; p < 0.01, t test; n = 25 and 22 neurons from two animals per group, respectively). Four months after injections at P7, Pten knockdown neurons were clearly larger. The somatic area was 79.4 ± 1.8 μm 2 for control neurons and 99.9 ± 3.1 μm 2 for Pten knockdown neurons ( Fig. 2 A , graph) ( p < 0.0001, t test; n = 66 and 62 neurons from two animals per group, respectively). Dendritic spine density in the outer molecular layer remained elevated in knockdown neurons ( Fig. 2 B , graph) (control, 2.10 ± 0.05 spines/μm; Pten shRNA, 2.73 ± 0.13 spines/μm; p < 0.001, t test; n = 15 and 18 neurons from two animals per group, respectively).

To determine whether the neuronal hypertrophy was limited to a particular cellular compartment, we also examined dendrites in the inner molecular layer (commissural/associational inputs) and mossy fiber axons at 4 months after injection of P7 animals. All examined regions of the granule cell were increased in size. The diameter of the dendrites in the inner molecular layer (within 50 μm of the granule cell layer) increased from 0.738 ± 0.034 μm in control to 0.977 ± 0.059 μm in Pten knockdown cells ( Fig. 3 A ) ( p < 0.01, t test; n = 16 and 23 neurons from two animals per group). The dendritic spine density also increased in the inner molecular layer ( Fig. 3 A ) (control, 1.56 ± 0.09 spines/μm; Pten shRNA, 2.39 ± 0.14 spines/μm; p < 0.0001, t test; n = 16 and 20 neurons from two animals per group). Mossy fiber axons in the CA3 region, examined at the point where they exit from the hilus, were thicker in Pten knockdown neurons than in the GFP-expressing control neurons ( Fig. 3 B ) (control, 0.360 ± 0.010 μm; Pten shRNA, 0.450 ± 0.014 μm; p < 0.0001, t test; n = 39 and 37 axons from two animals per group). Furthermore, we examined the cross-sectional area of the mossy fiber boutons, which were larger in Pten knockdown neurons ( Fig. 3 B ) (control, 6.45 ± 1.60 μm 2 ; Pten shRNA, 9.92 ± 2.08 μm 2 ; p < 0.01, t test; n = 24 and 22 boutons from two animals per group). From these morphological analyses, we conclude that Pten knockdown results in global hypertrophy of granule cells in vivo and that the density of dendritic spines increased in both of the two main inputs to granule cell dendrites in the molecular layer.

In mice injected as young adults, the onset of the morphological phenotype appeared to be somewhat slower. At 14 d after injection, we did not see a significant increase in cell size or dendritic spine density (images not shown). The somas of control granule cells had cross-sectional areas of 108.1 ± 1.2 μm 2 compared with 111.2 ± 1.6 μm 2 for neurons expressing Pten shRNA ( p > 0.1, t test; n = 121 cells from three animals per group). Cells expressing Pten shRNA had 2.18 ± 0.07 spines/μm compared with 2.15 ± 0.06 spines/μm in control animals ( p > 0.5, t test; n = 55 dendritic segments from six animals for control and n = 63 dendritic segments from seven animals for Pten shRNA). By 4 months after injection, the hippocampus appeared grossly normal ( Fig. 4 A ); however, the soma size and the density of dendritic spines were markedly increased. The cross-sectional soma area was 164.7 ± 3.5 μm 2 in the Pten knockdown compared with 114.0 ± 2.6 μm 2 in the control ( p < 0.0005, t test, n = 35 cells from two animals for control and n = 33 cells from two animals for Pten shRNA) ( Fig. 4 B ). In the outer molecular layer, there was a 43.9 ± 15.6% increase in dendritic spine density (3.3 ± 0.17 in the Pten knockdown compared with 2.3 ± 0.19 spines/μm in the control; p < 0.005; n = 20 dendritic segments from two animals for GFP control and n = 20 dendritic segments from two animals for Pten knockdown) ( Fig. 4 C ).

Consistent with the increased size of infected granule cells, Pten knockdown significantly increased the total cell capacitance and decreased the input resistance in both neonate and young adult injected groups at 4 months after injection ( Fig. 5 A ). For the P7 injection, the values obtained in whole-cell recordings were 11.7 ± 1.6 pF and 204.7 ± 15.6 MΩ in control cells, and 16.4 ± 1.4 pF and 128.7 ± 13.3 MΩ for Pten shRNA cells. For young adult injections, the values were 12.8 ± 0.9 pF and 181.3 ± 15.6 MΩ for control cells, and 19.0 ± 1.3 pF and 92.6 ± 9.3 MΩ for Pten shRNA cells. Interestingly, the soma fluorescence intensity correlated with the cross-sectional area of Pten shRNA-infected neurons ( r = 0.39; p < 0.01) ( Fig. 5 B ), suggesting that increased viral expression results in higher levels of the Pten shRNA and a more pronounced morphological phenotype. This correlation was not present in cells expressing only EGFP ( r = 0.09; p < 0.5, for control), indicating that variation in fluorescence intensity did not distort measurements of cell size. In sections from 62 Pten shRNA-injected animals, we did not observe fluorescent labeling of mossy fibers in the inner molecular layer or dendrites extending into the hilus. However, mossy fiber sprouting and ectopic hilar dendrites have been observed in conditional Pten knock-out mice ( Kwon et al., 2006 ) and in animals with spontaneous seizures ( Jessberger et al., 2007 ; Walter et al., 2007 ).

Discussion

Our studies demonstrate the effects of Pten knockdown on single neuronal synaptic function. We used a shRNA-expressing lentivirus to efficiently knockdown Pten expression in vivo . Pten knockdown results in a distinctive morphological phenotype in both neonatal mice and in young adults consisting of neuronal hypertrophy and increases in dendritic spine density. The onset of these changes occurred more rapidly in neonatal mice but reached similar levels by 4 months after injection in both young adult and neonatal mice. Acute hippocampal slices taken from injected animals revealed a synaptic phenotype consisting of a disproportionate increase in excitatory synaptic transmission compared with inhibition, which may reflect the circuit defect in autistic patients that have Pten mutations.
