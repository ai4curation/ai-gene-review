Transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) plays a critical role in iron homeostasis because 
patients carrying disabling mutations in the TFR2 gene suffer from 
hemochromatosis. In this study, iron-responsive regulation of TfR2 at the 
protein level was examined in vitro and in vivo. HepG2 cell TfR2 protein levels 
were up-regulated after exposure to holotransferrin (holoTf) in a time- and 
dose-responsive manner. ApoTf or high-iron treatment with non-Tf-bound iron 
failed to elicit similar effects, suggesting that TfR2 regulation reflects 
interactions of the iron-bound ligand. Hepatic TfR2 protein levels also 
reflected an adaptive response to changing iron status in vivo. Liver TfR2 
protein levels were down- and up-regulated in rats fed an iron-deficient and a 
high-iron diet, respectively. TfR2 was also up-regulated in Hfe(-/-) mice, an 
animal model that displays liver iron loading. In contrast, TfR2 levels were 
reduced in hypotransferrinemic mice despite liver iron overload, supporting the 
idea that regulation of the receptor is dependent on Tf. This idea is confirmed 
by up-regulation of TfR2 in beta-thalassemic mice, which, like 
hypotransferrinemic mice, are anemic and incur iron loading, but have functional 
Tf. Based on these combined results, we hypothesize that TfR2 acts as a sensor 
of iron status such that receptor levels reflect Tf saturation.
