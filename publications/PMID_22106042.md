BACKGROUND: The loss of Ikaros is associated with the development of B and T 
cell leukemia. Data on Ikaros function, including its role as a tumor suppressor 
and a regulator of cell cycle progression, come almost exclusively from murine 
studies; little is known of the mechanisms that regulate human Ikaros function. 
Our studies are the first to examine the function and regulation of human Ikaros 
isoforms during the cell cycle in human ALL.
PROCEDURES: Electromobility shift assay (EMSA), confocal microscopy, and 
phosphopeptide mapping were used to study Ikaros function during different 
stages of the cell cycle.
RESULTS: The DNA-binding activity of human Ikaros complexes undergoes dynamic 
changes as the cell cycle progresses. In S phase, Ikaros DNA-binding affinity 
for regulatory regions of its target genes decreases, while its binding to 
pericentromeric heterochromatin is preserved and correlates with Ikaros 
pericentromeric localization. These S phase-specific changes in Ikaros function 
are controlled by phosphorylation via the CK2 kinase pathway. During cell cycle 
progression, the subcellular pericentromeric localization of the largest human 
Ikaros isoforms is different from that in mouse cells, suggesting unique 
functions for human Ikaros.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the function of Ikaros is cell 
cycle-specific and controlled by CK2-mediated phosphorylation during S phase of 
the cell cycle in human T-cell and B-cell ALL. The differences we observe in 
murine and human Ikaros function highlight the importance of using human cells 
in studies of ALL. These data identify the CK2 pathway as a target for therapies 
in ALL.
