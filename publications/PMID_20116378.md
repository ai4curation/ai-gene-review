Thrombomodulin (TM) is an important vascular protective molecule that has 
anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. TM is 
downregulated in many thrombotic and vascular diseases. However, the mechanisms 
responsible for TM suppression are not completely understood. In this study, we 
investigated the mechanism involved in fatty acid-induced suppression of TM 
expression in human aortic endothelial cells. We found that palmitic acid 
inhibited TM expression through the JNK and p38 pathways. ATF-2, a JNK and p38 
target transcription factor, was involved in the suppression. ATF-2 can bind to 
the TM promoter, recruit HDAC4 and form a transcriptional repression complex in 
the promoter, which may lead to chromatin condensation and transcriptional 
arrest. This study provides novel insight into TM down-regulation by stress 
signaling pathways.
