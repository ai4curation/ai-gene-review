In eukaryotic cells, the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) triggers a signaling pathway from the ER to the nucleus. Several 
yeast mutants defective in this pathway map to the ERN1 gene, which protects 
cells from lethal consequences of stress by signaling for increased expression 
of BiP and other ER proteins. ERN1 encodes a 1115 amino acid transmembrane 
protein (Ern1p) whose glycosylated N-terminal portion is located inside 
microsomes and whose cytoplasmic C-terminal portion carries an essential protein 
kinase activity. We postulate that Ern1p is the proximal sensor of events in the 
ER and that binding of ligand causes transduction of information across the ER 
membrane, leading to activation of a specific set of transcription factors.
