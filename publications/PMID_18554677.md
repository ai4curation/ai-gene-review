The zinc-binding protein metallothionein-III (MT-III) is associated with 
resistance to neuronal injury. However, the underlying mechanism for its effects 
is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that MT-III prevents the accumulation 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells challenged with 
the Parkinson's disease-related neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) by a 
mechanism that involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and ERK 
kinase/NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) dependent induction of the stress response 
protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MT-III 
significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced generation of ROS, caspase-3 activation, 
and subsequent cell death. Also, MT-III up-regulates HO-1 expression and this 
expression confers neuroprotection against oxidative injury induced by 6-OHDA. 
Moreover, MT-III induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation, which is upstream of 
MT-III-induced HO-1 expression, and PI3K and ERK1/2 activation, a pathway that 
is involved in induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, HO-1 expression and 
neuroprotection. Taken together, these results suggest that the PI3K and 
ERK/Nrf2 signaling pathway controls the intracellular levels of ROS by 
regulating the expression of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1.
