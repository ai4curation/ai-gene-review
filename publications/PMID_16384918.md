Bacterial cell-surface attachment of macromolecular complexes maintains the 
microorganism in close proximity to extracellular substrates and allows for 
optimal uptake of hydrolytic byproducts. The cellulosome is a large multienzyme 
complex used by many anaerobic bacteria for the efficient degradation of plant 
cell-wall polysaccharides. The mechanism of cellulosome retention to the 
bacterial cell surface involves a calcium-mediated protein-protein interaction 
between the dockerin (Doc) module from the cellulosomal scaffold and a cohesin 
(Coh) module of cell-surface proteins located within the proteoglycan layer. 
Here, we report the structure of an ultra-high-affinity (K(a) = 1.44 x 10(10) 
M(-1)) complex between type II Doc, together with its neighboring X module from 
the cellulosome scaffold of Clostridium thermocellum, and a type II Coh module 
associated with the bacterial cell surface. Identification of X module-Doc and X 
module-Coh contacts reveal roles for the X module in Doc stability and enhanced 
Coh recognition. This extremely tight interaction involves one face of the Coh 
and both helices of the Doc and comprises significant hydrophobic character and 
a complementary extensive hydrogen-bond network. This structure represents a 
unique mechanism for cell-surface attachment in anaerobic bacteria and provides 
a rationale for discriminating between type I and type II Coh modules.
