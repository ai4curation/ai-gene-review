The IAN (immune-associated nucleotide-binding protein) family is a family of 
functionally uncharacterized GTP-binding proteins expressed in vertebrate immune 
cells and in plant cells during antibacterial responses. Here we show that all 
eight IAN family genes encoded in a single cluster of mouse genome are 
predominantly expressed in lymphocytes, and that the expression of IAN1, IAN4, 
and IAN5 is significantly elevated upon thymic selection of T lymphocytes. 
Gain-of-function experiments show that the premature overexpression of IAN1 
kills immature thymocytes, whereas short hairpin RNA-mediated loss-of-function 
studies show that IAN4 supports positive selection. The knockdown of IAN5 
perturbs the optimal generation of CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes and 
reduces the survival of mature T lymphocytes. We also show evidence suggesting 
that IAN4 and IAN5 are associated with anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, 
whereas IAN1 is associated with pro-apoptotic Bax. Thus, the IAN family is a 
novel family of T cell-receptor-responsive proteins that critically regulate 
thymic development and survival of T lymphocytes and that potentially exert 
regulatory functions through the association with Bcl-2 family proteins.
