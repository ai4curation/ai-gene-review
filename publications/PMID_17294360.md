Most of the bone, cartilage and connective tissue of the lower jaw is derived 
from cranial neural crest cells (NCCs) arising from the posterior midbrain and 
hindbrain. Multiple factors direct the patterning of these NCCs, including 
endothelin-1-mediated endothelin A receptor (Edn1/Ednra) signaling. Loss of 
Ednra signaling results in multiple defects in lower jaw and neck structures, 
including homeotic transformation of lower jaw structures into upper jaw-like 
structures. However, since the Ednra gene is expressed by both migrating and 
post-migrating NCCs, the actual function of Ednra in cranial NCC development is 
not clear. Ednra signaling could be required for normal migration or guidance of 
NCCs to the pharyngeal arches or in subsequent events in post-migratory NCCs, 
including proliferation and survival. To address this question, we performed a 
fate analysis of cranial NCCs in Ednra-/- embryos using the R26R;Wnt1-Cre 
reporter system, in which Cre expression within NCCs results in permanent 
beta-galactosidase activity in NCCs and their derivatives. We find that loss of 
Ednra does not detectably alter either migration of most cranial NCCs into the 
mandibular first arch and second arch or their subsequent proliferation. 
However, mesenchymal cell apoptosis is increased two fold in both E9.5 and E10.5 
Ednra-/- embryos, with apoptotic cells being present in and just proximal to the 
pharyngeal arches. Based on these studies, Ednra signaling appears to be 
required by most cranial NCCs after they reach the pharyngeal arches. However, a 
subset of NCCs appear to require Ednra signaling earlier, with loss of Ednra 
signaling likely leading to premature cessation of migration into or within the 
arches and subsequent cell death.
