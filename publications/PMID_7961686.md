A 25-kDa antioxidant enzyme that provides protection against oxidation systems 
capable of generating reactive oxygen and sulfur species has previously been 
identified. The nature of the oxidant eliminated by, and the physiological 
source of reducing equivalents for, this enzyme, however, were not known. The 
25-kDa enzyme is now shown to be a peroxidase that reduces H2O2 and alkyl 
hydroperoxides with the use of hydrogens provided by thioredoxin, thioredoxin 
reductase, and NADPH. This protein is the first peroxidase to be identified that 
uses thioredoxin as the immediate hydrogen donor and is thus named thioredoxin 
peroxidase (TPx). TPx exists as a dimer of identical 25-kDa subunits that 
contain 2 cysteine residues, Cys47 and Cys170. Cys47-SH appears to be the site 
of oxidation by peroxides, and the oxidized Cys47 probably reacts with Cys170-SH 
of the other subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide. Mutant TPx proteins 
lacking either Cys47 or Cys170, therefore, do not exhibit thioredoxin-coupled 
peroxidase activity. The TPx disulfide is specifically reduced by thioredoxin, 
but can also be reduced (less effectively) by a small molecular size thiol. The 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae thioredoxin reductase gene was also cloned and 
sequenced, and the deduced amino sequence was shown to be 51% identical with 
that of the Escherichia coli enzyme.
