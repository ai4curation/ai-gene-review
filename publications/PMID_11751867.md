LMO4 belongs to the LIM-only (LMO) group of transcriptional regulators that 
appear to function as molecular adaptors for protein-protein interactions. 
Expression of the LMO4 gene is developmentally regulated in the mammary gland 
and is up-regulated in primary breast cancers. Using LMO4 in a yeast two-hybrid 
screen, we have identified the cofactor CtIP as an LMO4-binding protein. 
Interaction with CtIP appeared to be specific for the LMO subclass of LIM domain 
proteins and could be mediated by a single LIM motif of LMO4. We further 
identified the breast tumor suppressor BRCA1 as an LMO4-associated protein. The 
C-terminal BRCT domains of BRCA1, previously shown to bind CtIP, also mediated 
interaction with LMO4. Tumor-associated mutations within the BRCT repeats that 
abolish interaction between BRCA1 and CtIP had no effect on the association of 
BRCA1 with LMO4. A stable complex comprising LMO4, BRCA1, and CtIP was 
demonstrated in vivo. The LIM domain binding-protein Ldb1 also participated in 
this multiprotein complex. In functional assays, LMO4 was shown to repress 
BRCA1-mediated transcriptional activation in both yeast and mammalian cells. 
These findings reveal a novel complex between BRCA1, LMO4, and CtIP and indicate 
a role for LMO4 as a repressor of BRCA1 activity in breast tissue.

Despite adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in luminal breast cancer (LBC), relapses are common. Addressing this, we aim to develop a prognostic model to refine adjuvant therapy strategies, particularly for patients at high recurrence risk. Notably, obesity profoundly affects the tumor microenvironment (TME) of LBC. However, it is unclear whether obesity-related biological features can effectively screen high-risk patients. Utilizing weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) on RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data, we identified seven obese LBC genes (OLGs) closely associated with patient prognosis. Subsequently, we developed a luminal obesity-gene clinical prognostic index (LOG-CPI), combining a 7-gene signature, TNM staging, and age. Its predictive efficacy was confirmed across validation datasets and a clinical cohort (5-year accuracy = 0.828, 0.760, 0.751, and 0.792, respectively). LOG-CPI emerges as a promising predictor for clinical prognosis and treatment response, helping distinguish molecular and immunological features in LBC patients and guiding clinical practice by identifying varying prognoses.

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) is the primary disease burden among women globally, according to the American Cancer Society 2023 estimates.1 BC is classified into four major subtypes based on clinicopathological characteristics and immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptors (ERs), progesterone receptors (PRs), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) proteins.2 Among these, LBC represents a hormone-dependent phenotype and responds to endocrine therapies (ETs) with a good prognosis.3 In patients with LBC, chemotherapy or ET for 5 years is the standard adjuvant treatment; however, personalization remains debatable.ER-positive BC has a long, natural course, with some patients remaining at a risk of recurrence for up to 15 years after diagnosis and treatment.4,5 Extending ET beyond 5 years may be a reasonable option. For individuals with ER-positive status, extending the use of adjuvant tamoxifen led to a further decrease in the risk of BC recurrence and mortality.6,7 Consistently, several trials have indicated that PFS of patients is improved with the addition of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) following the initial tamoxifen treatment.8,9 However, this strategy significantly increases side effects occurrence.10,11 Additionally, approximately 15% of patients with luminal-type breast cancer develop resistance to endocrine therapy, and studies have revealed that approximately 54% of recurrences and 67% of deaths occur after 5 years of endocrine therapy.12 Consequently, developing clinical and genomic tools can aid in selecting eligible high-risk patients in daily clinical practice and assist clinicians in making adjuvant treatment decisions.The 21Oncotype DX, 70MammaPrint, and 12Epclin are extensively used for evaluating the risk of BC recurrence, with validation in prospective randomized trials.13,14 Existing genomic assays primarily consist of genes related to tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis with low heterogeneity, which makes it challenging to achieve individualized and precise treatment. Additionally, based on existing medical evidence, different genomic assays differ in their applicable groups, stratification methods, and the proportion of high-risk patients. Furthermore, test inconsistencies and limited long-term prediction ability underscore their clinical limitations. Therefore, efforts to define a gene expression signature related to prognosis remain necessary.15,16,17Based on copy number, gene expression, and long-term clinical outcomes, BC can be further categorized into more intrinsic subtypes, each with a unique expression pattern, clinical features, and distinct response profile, demonstrating the heterogeneity of the landscape of BC. The TME plays a critical role in tumor development, with tumor cells closely interacting with their surroundings; their biological characteristics are inevitably regulated by dynamic systemic metabolic changes. BC develops with abundant adipose tissue in the TME, distinguishing it from other solid tumors, especially in LBC patients.18,19,20 Excess body weight in postmenopausal women is a risk factor,21 potentially favoring BC development, increasing recurrence risk, and shortening PFS and overall survival (OS), independent of tumor stage at diagnosis.22,23 Therefore, in LBC, extracting molecular prognostic indicators related to obesity or body mass index (BMI) may be a strategy for developing a robust and precise clinical predictive signature.Using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and METABRIC, we carried out a comprehensive prognostic analysis to identify the target gene module related to the high BMI phenotype and examined its suitability for predicting long-term recurrence risk in LBC patients. This study identified seven signature genes that can function as prognostic indices when combined with the AJCC clinical staging system and age of patients. This system allowed for the division of patients with LBC into high- and low-risk groups, exhibiting distinct prognostic, molecular, and immunological characteristics. The workflow is illustrated in Figure 1.Figure 1Study flow in the process of the feature selection and model construction

Breast cancer (BC) is the primary disease burden among women globally, according to the American Cancer Society 2023 estimates.1 BC is classified into four major subtypes based on clinicopathological characteristics and immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptors (ERs), progesterone receptors (PRs), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) proteins.2 Among these, LBC represents a hormone-dependent phenotype and responds to endocrine therapies (ETs) with a good prognosis.3 In patients with LBC, chemotherapy or ET for 5 years is the standard adjuvant treatment; however, personalization remains debatable.

ResultsData analysis flowchartA series of structured protocols was established to assess the prognosis linked to obesity-related characteristics in patients with luminal breast cancer (Figure 1).Identification of OLGs of LBC patientsInitially, transcriptome and clinical data of patients with LBC were obtained from the UCSC-XENA database (Table 1). Subsequently, the transcriptome data were processed to screen 4,150 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the Deseq2 algorithm. This comparison involved 1,099 BC samples with 179 normal breast samples from the TCGA-TARGET-GTEx dataset, resulting in 1,611 downregulated and 2,539 upregulated genes (Figures 2A and S1A). Next, the 20 most upregulated and downregulated genes were, respectively, confirmed with selection criteria set at FDR <0.05, |log2 fold change| > 1, and p < 0.05, and the heatmap is illustrated in Figure 2B.Figure 2Identification of prognostic OLGs in LBC patients(A) Volcano plot exhibiting 4,150 DEGs between BC and normal breast samples.(B) Heatmap of top 20 differentially expressed genes from DEGs.(C) Samples cluster analysis and network topology analysis for various soft-thresholding powers.(D) Gene dendrogram and module colors.(E) Correlations of 19 modules with clinical phenotypes.(F) Venn diagram to identify 154 overlapping prognostic OLGs.(G) GO analysis of OLGs in the molecular function, biological process, and cellular components parts. Bubble size indicates the sample amount of the GO terms.(H) KEGG analysis of OLGs in the signaling pathways.The expression profiles of protein-encoding genes were also extracted from 258 expression LBC profiles in the GEO: GSE78958 dataset. Hierarchical clustering was employed to group the samples, as depicted in Figure S1B. Following this process, six outliers were identified and excluded, resulting in a final cohort of 252 samples for further analysis. The relationships between various soft thresholds and scale independence, as well as mean connectivity, were plotted as depicted in Figure 2C. To make sure the network was scale-free, β was assigned a value of 5. Subsequently, we transformed the expression matrix into an adjacency matrix, which was subsequently converted into a topological overlap matrix (TOM). Using the average-linkage hierarchical clustering method, genes were then grouped based on their TOM similarity. According to the mixed dynamic shear trees criteria, each network module had a minimum of 30 genes. We identified gene modules using the dynamic shearing approach, followed by the calculation and clustering of each module’s eigengenes, and 19 modules were obtained (Figure 2D). Notably, the gray module represents a set of genes that did not fit into any other modules.Pearson’s test was utilized to further analyze the correlations between each gene module’s expression and clinical characteristics, such as grade, stage, and BMI (Figure 2E). The module with a significant positive correlation with BMI was yellow, containing 340 obesity-related genes. Venn plots demonstrated overlapping genes between the aforementioned modules and the DEGs. This analysis identified 154 overlapping OLGs in LBC that were eligible for further analysis (Figure 2F). Table S1 shows the genes in the selected WGCNA yellow module, the DEGs, and their intersections.To explore the potential pathways in the OLGs, we performed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of OLGs. These analyses revealed gene enrichments in 239 GO annotations, including 145 in biological processes, 60 in cellular components, 34 in molecular functions, and 54 in KEGG pathways. The top 10 KEGG pathways and top 5 GO terms are shown in Figures 2G and 2H, respectively. Based on the results of GO analysis, OLGs exhibited significant enrichment in the extracellular matrix and structure organization, as well as in collagen-based extracellular matrices and glycosaminoglycan binding. The KEGG analysis indicated potentially active pathways, such as ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion, proteoglycans in cancer, and cell adhesion molecules. Interestingly, both GO and KEGG results were significantly enriched in pathways associated with tumor stroma and cell adhesion, indicating a possible role for obesity in remodeling the TME in LBC.Construction of the prognostic risk modelFirst, 717 samples from TCGA-LBC dataset were used as a training set. To identify the potential prognostic value of each OLGs, we constructed a univariate Cox proportional hazard regression model for each gene in the training dataset using the R package survival coxph function. A significance threshold of p < 0.001 was applied to identify 42 significantly different genes (Table 2). We utilized the R package glmnet for the Lasso Cox regression analysis, with the trajectory of each independent variable depicted in Figure 3A. The number of independent coefficients tends to increase as lambda increases gradually. We employed 3-fold cross-validation for model construction and analyzed the CI for each lambda, as illustrated in Figure 3B. The model reached its optimum at lambda = 0.046, leading to the selection of 12 target genes. We conducted a multivariate Cox analysis on these 12 genes, ultimately retaining the seven mRNAs with the lowest AIC.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Cox analyses indicated that 7-gene signature had a great predictive accuracy, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.703, 0.716, and 0.708 at 3, 5, and 7 years (Figure 3D), and could serve as an independent prognostic factor relative to other clinicopathologic characteristics (Figures 3E and 3F). The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis also observed a significant prognostic difference between the samples of different risk groups (p < 0.001, Figure 3G). Additionally, log rank tests demonstrated that the seven mRNAs had good potential to indicate prognosis and could markedly distinguish the prognosis of patients between the high and low groups (Figures S1C‒S1I).To enhance predictive accuracy, a multivariate Cox analysis incorporating the 7-gene model, AJCC staging system, and clinicopathological characteristics was utilized to develop the LOG-CPI. This approach selectively retained RiskScore, stage, and age as variables, based on achieving the lowest AIC. The signature formula is as follows:LOG−CPI=0.269033235342189∗expRiskScore+0.52595219202537∗expStage+0.0492224627419527∗expAgeTo assess the performance of LOG-CPI, we evaluated its predictive efficiency at 3, 5, and 7 years, as illustrated in Figure 3H. It demonstrated impressive predictive accuracy with high AUC values of 0.802, 0.828, and 0.786, respectively, indicating a significant improvement in prediction efficiency compared with former 7-gene RiskScore. Additionally, the predictive performance of LOG-CPI at 5 years was superior to the prognostic value of the existing model 13OncotypeDX, 47MammaPrint, 10Epclin, 30GC,30 7BCI,31 MSigDBscore, FFAscore, and the original AJCC clinical prognostic staging system (Figure 3I). The MSigDB score is an 8-gene prognostic signature based on lipid metabolism.32 The FFA score is a 6-gene index based on fatty acid metabolism, capable of predicting patient survival.33 We also calculated LOG-CPI based on the sample expression level and drew the sample’s risk score distribution (Figure 3J). Samples exhibiting high LOG-CPI values were significantly higher than those with low LOG-CPI, indicating a worse prognosis. Additionally, independent prognostic analyses based on univariate and multivariate Cox regression revealed that LOG-CPI serves as an independent prognostic factor. Compared with the earlier 7-gene RiskScore, the stability of LOG-CPI was notably enhanced, as evidenced by the narrower CI shown in Figures 3K and 3L. Finally, we stratified the LOG-CPI into high- and low-risk groups, plotted the K-M curve as shown in Figure 3M, and observed a notable disparity between the two groups (p < 0.001).Robust validation of LOG-CPI in various cohortsTo assess the robustness of our model, we applied its coefficients to independent validation datasets, GEO: GSE21653 and METABRIC, with the median LOG-CPI score from the training set to differentiate between high- and low-risk subgroups. ROC was utilized to analyze the prognostic categorization efficiency of LOG-CPI.In the GEO cohort, the 3-, 5-, and 7-year ROC values were 0.815, 0.760, and 0.758 as depicted in Figure 4A. Meanwhile, for the METABRIC cohort, the 3-, 5-, and 7-year ROC values were 0.731, 0.751, and 0.792, respectively (Figure 4D). Significant prognostic differences were observed between the high- and low-risk-score groups in both cohorts (Figures 4B and 4E). Notably, the RiskScore distribution of the sample indicated a significantly higher proportion of deaths in the samples with a high RiskScore, consistent with the training set (Figures 4C and 4F). These results demonstrate the robustness of our signature, which consistently maintains a steady prognostic prediction capacity in various cohorts.Figure 4Robust validation of LOG-CPI in various cohorts(A and D) ROC curve of LOG-CPI classification in GEO and METABRIC testing cohort.(B and E) K-M survival analysis comparing two risk groups based on LOG-CPI classification.(C and F) Distribution of risk score and survival status of LOG-CPI in GEO and METABRIC testing cohort.(G) ROC analysis of LOG-CPI, CTS5, and TNM staging at 5-year follow-up in METABRIC cohort.(H) Survival curves comparing the two risk groups based on CTS5 classification in METABRIC cohort.(I and J) Univariate Cox analysis of clinicopathologic factors and the LOG-CPI score.(K and L) Multivariate Cox analysis of the factors significant in the univariate Cox analysis above (p < 0.05).CTS5 (Clinical Treatment Score post-5 years) is a clinicopathological model used to assess the residual risk of advanced distant metastases after 5 years of endocrine therapy in patients with hormone-receptor-positive BC. The risk prediction score in the model was created for the training set based on the ATAC study, and its validity was verified using the BIG 1-98 study as the validation set.34 To highlight the superiority of LOG-CPI, we calculated CTS5 risk score for each individual in the METABRIC dataset and compared the predictive accuracy of both by plotting ROC curves. The result showed that LOG-CPI was a better indicator of recurrence risk in LBC patients compared with CTS5 and TNM staging (5-year accuracy 0.751 vs. 0.713, 0.635; respectively, Figure 4G). Figure 4H showed the K-M curve for patients in the METABRIC cohort under the application of CTS5.In order to assess the clinical independence of LOG-CPI, we performed both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses on the various clinical variables (Figures 4I and 4J). In GEO and METABRIC datasets, univariate Cox regression analysis revealed significant associations between survival and variables such as age, grade, stage, ER status, PR status, menopause status, tumor size, lymph node state, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and LOG-CPI score. However, in the multivariate analysis (Figures 4K and 4L), only the LOG-CPI risk score, grade, stage, menopause status, lymph node state, and age were significantly associated with survival.These results indicate that LOG-CPI can serve as an independent risk factor for predicting the prognosis of patients with LBC.Relation between LOG-CPI and pathwaysTo explore the relationship between risk scores and biological functions, we conducted the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify gene sets enriched in distinct LOG-CPI subgroups. The gene sets of the LOG-CPI-high samples were enriched in the chromosomes, cell cycle, and mitochondrial function pathways, such as GOBP_MITOCHONDRIAL_RESPIRATORY_CHAIN_COMPLEX_ASSEMBLY, GOCC_MITOCHONDRIAL_PROTEIN_CONTAINING_COMPLEX, KEGG_CELL_CYCLE, and KEGG_DNA_REPLICATION pathways (Figures 5A‒5C; p < 0.05, |NES|>1), whereas the gene sets of the LOG-CPI-low samples were enriched in extracellular matrix microenvironment and immune-related pathways, such as GOBP_CELL_CELL_ADHESION_VIA_PLASMA_MEMBRANE_ADHESION_MOLECULES, GOCC_COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_EXTRACELLULAR_MATRIX, GOMF_EXTRACELLULAR_MATRIX_STRUCTURAL_CONSTITUENT, KEGG_CYTOKINE_CYTOKINE_RECEPTOR_INTERACTION, KEGG_ADHERENS_JUNCTION and KEGG_ECM_RECEPTOR_INTERACTION pathways (Figures 5D‒5F; p < 0.05, |NES|>1). The detailed results of GSEA are listed in Figure S2.Figure 5Molecular characteristics of different LOG-CPI subgroups(A‒C) Gene sets enriched in LOG-CPI-high subgroups of different cohorts.(D‒F) Gene sets enriched in LOG-CPI-low subgroups of different cohorts.(G and H) Significantly mutated genes in LBC samples of different LOG-CPI subgroups.

Hete Amp, heterozygous amplification; Hete Del, heterozygous deletion; Homo Amp, homozygous amplification; Homo Del, homozygous deletion; None, no CNV.Genome-wide analysis of the LOG-CPI genesWe analyzed gene mutations to gain further biological insights into the genomic nature of LOG-CPI subgroups. The LOG-CPI-high subgroup displayed notably higher mutation counts compared with the LOG-CPI-low subgroup (Figures 5G and 5H). The predominant mutation type was missing nucleotide mutations, followed by nonsense and frameshift deletions. We identified the top 20 genes with the most significant mutation frequencies within the LOG-CPI subgroup. Mutation rates of PIK3CA, TP53, TTN, and CDH1 were >10% in both groups. The LOG-CPI-high group showed a higher mutation frequency in TP53, TTN, CDH1, MAP3K1, and KMT2C, whereas the LOG-CPI-low group had a higher mutation frequency in PIK3CA and GATA3.The GSCALite database was utilized to conduct genome-wide analyses of these seven genes. The findings revealed that SHROOM2 exhibited the most prevalent mutation frequency at 37%, with GP2, ERCC6L, and RBBP8 each having mutation frequencies exceeding 15%. The mutation frequencies of GSN and CDK5R1 were >5%, whereas NKAIN1 gene had the lowest mutation frequency at 4% (Figure 5I). In Figures 5J and 5K, extensive heterozygous copy-number variation (CNV) mutations were observed in LOG-CPI genes across various cancer species, including amplification and deletion. Furthermore, compared with other cancer types, LOG-CPI genes exhibited a stronger association with more widespread mutations in BRCA. This indicates that LOG-CPI may regulate tumor behavior and status at the genetic level.Potential implications of LOG-CPI on LBC therapy and landscape of tumor-immune microenvironmentTo further reveal the effect of LOG-CPI on the TME landscape, we analyzed the immune cell infiltration in the TME of LBC based on LOG-CPI classifications in both training and test datasets. The results revealed an increased presence of activated memory CD4+T cells and M1 macrophages, neutrophils, CD8+T cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and regulatory T cells in the TME of the high-LOG-CPI group. In contrast, naive B cells, monocytes, resting memory CD4+ T cells, eosinophils, and resting dendritic cells (DCs) were markedly enriched in the low-LOG-CPI group (Figures 6A–6F). We also linked patient immune cell infiltration scores to survival data, demonstrating that high enrichment of CD8+T cells, plasma cells, resting mast cells, and memory resting CD4+T cells indicated a significantly better prognosis in patients with LBC than in those with low expression, as evidenced by the longer PFS in TCGA, GEO, and METABRIC data (Figures S3A‒S3C). Interestingly, plasma cell was inconsistently enriched between the TCGA and METABRIC datasets. Furthermore, decreased activated dendritic cells (DCs) and M1 macrophages were associated with improved patient prognosis, suggesting that a broader range of cell subsets might contribute to cellular heterogeneity. Additionally, in the obese TME of LBC affected by LOG-CPI, immune cell reprogramming and heterogeneity may be more pronounced.Figure 6The landscape of the TME in LBC and the characteristics of different LOG-CPI subgroups(A‒C) LOG-CPI grouping and proportions of TME cells for patients in training and testing cohorts.(D‒F) TME cell proportions in different LOG-CPI subgroups. The dots scattered in the visualization depict the immune score of the two subgroups. Median values are denoted by the bold lines, whereas the box’s lower and upper boundaries indicate the upper quartile and lower quartile, respectively. The Wilcoxon test was utilized to evaluate significant statistical differences between the two subgroups (ns, not significant; ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗, p < 0.0001).(G‒I) Proportions of immune-related functions in different LOG-CPI subgroups.(J and K) Correlation heatmaps between the individual genes of LOG-CPI, each with the degree of immune cell infiltration and between immune cells (∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗, p < 0.0001).(L) Correlation plots between the 7-gene signature of LOG-CPI and immune checkpoint expression in the TIMER2.0 database.Consequently, ssGSEA was performed to evaluate 33 types of immune cells and 13 immune-associated function pathways in TCGA, GEO, and METABRIC datasets. Immune cell infiltration of both datasets, especially eosinophils, immature DCs, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, plasmacytoid DCs, activated B cells, central memory CD4+T cells, Tfh cells, and type Ⅰ T helper (Th1) cells, is much higher in the low-risk group than that of the high-risk group (Figures 6G–6I). Correlation heatmaps between individual genes in the model, each with the degree of immune cell infiltration, as well as among different immune cells are shown in Figures 6J and 6K. Correlations between individual genes and immune infiltration were also verified using the TIMER2.0 database (Figure S4). Similarly, high levels of activated B cells, CD56 bright NK cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and type Ⅱ interferon (IFN) response pathway affected the good prognosis of patients (Figures S3D‒S3F). The ssGSEA analysis revealed that low-risk patients exhibited higher scores for immune cell presence and immune function, which suggests that LOG-CPI may have a role in reflecting TME component and overall immune functional pathway. The 7-gene signature exhibited a negative correlation with immune checkpoint expression markers (CD27, CTLA4, and LAG3) and a positive correlation with genes linked to the cell cycle and resistance to endocrine therapy (CDKN1B, mTOR, RB1, WEE1, and HDACs). These findings suggest that LBC patients with a high LOG-CPI score might benefit more from targeted therapies, such as inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and HDAC inhibitors. These treatments are considered promising when used in combination with endocrine therapy, potentially enhancing therapeutic effectiveness for these patients.35 Conversely, LBC patients with a low LOG-CPI score could be more responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, further research is necessary to substantiate these hypotheses (Figure 6L).Clinical validation of the predictive modelTo validate our findings, we analyzed 63 LBC tissue samples in our clinical cohort, which had a mean follow-up duration of 6.14 years. We performed independent experimental validation of the selected genes using RT-qPCR to build LOG-CPI. When we classified the LOG-CPI into high-risk (19 samples) and low-risk (44 samples) groups, a significant difference was observed in their survival outcomes as demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier curve analysis (p < 0.001, Figure 7A). The ROC analysis revealed that the predictive efficiencies of LOG-CPI had a high AUC area of 0.801, 0.792, and 0.788 at 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively (Figure 7B). Besides, the Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) is a composite scoring tool developed based on SOFT and TEXT prospective trial data to effectively assess the risk of recurrence and identify patients who would benefit from an intensive treatment regimen.36 Both STEPP and CTS5 mentioned earlier have been used in clinical practice for BC treatment. Based on this, we evaluated and compared the efficacies of LOG-CPI, CTS5, and STEPP in a clinical validation cohort using ROC analysis. The results revealed that the predictive performance of LOG-CPI at 5 years was superior to the prognostic values of CTS5 and STEPP (5-year accuracy 0.792 vs. 0.643, 0.64; respectively, Figure 7C). K-M curve plotting of CTS5 and STEPP is illustrated in Figures S1J and S1K. In addition to assessing the discrimination of model, we evaluated the calibration of LOG-CPI through the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which indicated that LOG-CPI predicts more stably and accurately than CTS5 and STEPP. Furthermore, the net reclassification index (NRI) and Brier score calculations provided a quantitative measure of calibration. The NRI demonstrated that the effectiveness of LOG-CPI improved by 0.29 and 0.27 over CTS5 and STEPP, respectively. Additionally, LOG-CPI’s Brier score of 0.126 surpassed those of CTS5 (0.156) and STEPP (0.151), further demonstrating its superior performance (Figure 7D). In further subgroup analyses of the First Hospital of China Medical University (CMU1H cohort) cohort, LOG-CPI was found to significantly impact overall prognosis (hazard ratio [HR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73 to 6.31, p < 0.001), confirming its role as a vital prognostic factor (Figure 7E). Notably, in BMI subgroup comparisons, LOG-CPI demonstrated a greater prognostic value in the high-BMI group compared with the low-BMI group (HR 7.84, p 0.039; HR 6.63, p 0.671, respectively), highlighting its particular relevance in obese patients. The broad 95% CI, however, attributed to the limited sample size, calls for further validation in a larger clinical cohort. Moreover, the analysis revealed that the effect of LOG-CPI was more pronounced in patients with luminal B subtype, clinical early-stage, or pathological grade II LBC (HR 4.51, p 0.001; HR 5.12, p < 0.001; and HR 4.73, p 0.005; respectively). Despite varying HRs and p values, LOG-CPI consistently emerged as a significant prognostic indicator across various age and menopausal state subgroups. In summary, this multivariate Cox subgroup analysis underscores the prognostic importance of LOG-CPI across diverse clinicopathologic characteristics, pinpoints high-risk subgroups, and offers valuable insights for clinical treatment strategies. The relative expression levels of the seven genes in LOG-CPI, comparing paired tumors with adjacent para-tumor tissues in the CMU1H cohort, were illustrated in Figures 7F and S1M. These findings were consistent with the DEGs identified in earlier RNAseq analysis, as depicted in Figure S1L.Figure 7Evaluating and verifying the prognostic ability of the model in CMU1H cohort(A) K-M survival analysis visualized the prognostic value of LOG-CPI for LBC subtypes.(B) LOG-CPI at 3-, 5-, and 7-year ROC in a clinical validation cohort.(C and D) Discrimination and calibration analysis of LOG-CPI and existing clinical prognostic models at 5-year follow-up in a clinical validation cohort.(E) Forest plot of LOG-CPI multivariate Cox regression subgroup analysis.(F) Bar plots depicting expression fold changes (FC) of the LOG-CPI’s seven genes between paired LBC and adjacent para-tumor tissues.

Identification of OLGs of LBC patientsInitially, transcriptome and clinical data of patients with LBC were obtained from the UCSC-XENA database (Table 1). Subsequently, the transcriptome data were processed to screen 4,150 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the Deseq2 algorithm. This comparison involved 1,099 BC samples with 179 normal breast samples from the TCGA-TARGET-GTEx dataset, resulting in 1,611 downregulated and 2,539 upregulated genes (Figures 2A and S1A). Next, the 20 most upregulated and downregulated genes were, respectively, confirmed with selection criteria set at FDR <0.05, |log2 fold change| > 1, and p < 0.05, and the heatmap is illustrated in Figure 2B.Figure 2Identification of prognostic OLGs in LBC patients(A) Volcano plot exhibiting 4,150 DEGs between BC and normal breast samples.(B) Heatmap of top 20 differentially expressed genes from DEGs.(C) Samples cluster analysis and network topology analysis for various soft-thresholding powers.(D) Gene dendrogram and module colors.(E) Correlations of 19 modules with clinical phenotypes.(F) Venn diagram to identify 154 overlapping prognostic OLGs.(G) GO analysis of OLGs in the molecular function, biological process, and cellular components parts. Bubble size indicates the sample amount of the GO terms.(H) KEGG analysis of OLGs in the signaling pathways.The expression profiles of protein-encoding genes were also extracted from 258 expression LBC profiles in the GEO: GSE78958 dataset. Hierarchical clustering was employed to group the samples, as depicted in Figure S1B. Following this process, six outliers were identified and excluded, resulting in a final cohort of 252 samples for further analysis. The relationships between various soft thresholds and scale independence, as well as mean connectivity, were plotted as depicted in Figure 2C. To make sure the network was scale-free, β was assigned a value of 5. Subsequently, we transformed the expression matrix into an adjacency matrix, which was subsequently converted into a topological overlap matrix (TOM). Using the average-linkage hierarchical clustering method, genes were then grouped based on their TOM similarity. According to the mixed dynamic shear trees criteria, each network module had a minimum of 30 genes. We identified gene modules using the dynamic shearing approach, followed by the calculation and clustering of each module’s eigengenes, and 19 modules were obtained (Figure 2D). Notably, the gray module represents a set of genes that did not fit into any other modules.Pearson’s test was utilized to further analyze the correlations between each gene module’s expression and clinical characteristics, such as grade, stage, and BMI (Figure 2E). The module with a significant positive correlation with BMI was yellow, containing 340 obesity-related genes. Venn plots demonstrated overlapping genes between the aforementioned modules and the DEGs. This analysis identified 154 overlapping OLGs in LBC that were eligible for further analysis (Figure 2F). Table S1 shows the genes in the selected WGCNA yellow module, the DEGs, and their intersections.To explore the potential pathways in the OLGs, we performed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of OLGs. These analyses revealed gene enrichments in 239 GO annotations, including 145 in biological processes, 60 in cellular components, 34 in molecular functions, and 54 in KEGG pathways. The top 10 KEGG pathways and top 5 GO terms are shown in Figures 2G and 2H, respectively. Based on the results of GO analysis, OLGs exhibited significant enrichment in the extracellular matrix and structure organization, as well as in collagen-based extracellular matrices and glycosaminoglycan binding. The KEGG analysis indicated potentially active pathways, such as ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion, proteoglycans in cancer, and cell adhesion molecules. Interestingly, both GO and KEGG results were significantly enriched in pathways associated with tumor stroma and cell adhesion, indicating a possible role for obesity in remodeling the TME in LBC.

Construction of the prognostic risk modelFirst, 717 samples from TCGA-LBC dataset were used as a training set. To identify the potential prognostic value of each OLGs, we constructed a univariate Cox proportional hazard regression model for each gene in the training dataset using the R package survival coxph function. A significance threshold of p < 0.001 was applied to identify 42 significantly different genes (Table 2). We utilized the R package glmnet for the Lasso Cox regression analysis, with the trajectory of each independent variable depicted in Figure 3A. The number of independent coefficients tends to increase as lambda increases gradually. We employed 3-fold cross-validation for model construction and analyzed the CI for each lambda, as illustrated in Figure 3B. The model reached its optimum at lambda = 0.046, leading to the selection of 12 target genes.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Cox analyses indicated that 7-gene signature had a great predictive accuracy, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.703, 0.716, and 0.708 at 3, 5, and 7 years (Figure 3D), and could serve as an independent prognostic factor relative to other clinicopathologic characteristics (Figures 3E and 3F). The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis also observed a significant prognostic difference between the samples of different risk groups (p < 0.001, Figure 3G). Additionally, log rank tests demonstrated that the seven mRNAs had good potential to indicate prognosis and could markedly distinguish the prognosis of patients between the high and low groups (Figures S1C‒S1I).To enhance predictive accuracy, a multivariate Cox analysis incorporating the 7-gene model, AJCC staging system, and clinicopathological characteristics was utilized to develop the LOG-CPI. This approach selectively retained RiskScore, stage, and age as variables, based on achieving the lowest AIC.

It demonstrated impressive predictive accuracy with high AUC values of 0.802, 0.828, and 0.786, respectively, indicating a significant improvement in prediction efficiency compared with former 7-gene RiskScore. Additionally, the predictive performance of LOG-CPI at 5 years was superior to the prognostic value of the existing model 13OncotypeDX, 47MammaPrint, 10Epclin, 30GC,30 7BCI,31 MSigDBscore, FFAscore, and the original AJCC clinical prognostic staging system (Figure 3I). The MSigDB score is an 8-gene prognostic signature based on lipid metabolism.32 The FFA score is a 6-gene index based on fatty acid metabolism, capable of predicting patient survival.33 We also calculated LOG-CPI based on the sample expression level and drew the sample’s risk score distribution (Figure 3J). Samples exhibiting high LOG-CPI values were significantly higher than those with low LOG-CPI, indicating a worse prognosis. Additionally, independent prognostic analyses based on univariate and multivariate Cox regression revealed that LOG-CPI serves as an independent prognostic factor. Compared with the earlier 7-gene RiskScore, the stability of LOG-CPI was notably enhanced, as evidenced by the narrower CI shown in Figures 3K and 3L. Finally, we stratified the LOG-CPI into high- and low-risk groups, plotted the K-M curve as shown in Figure 3M, and observed a notable disparity between the two groups (p < 0.001).

First, 717 samples from TCGA-LBC dataset were used as a training set. To identify the potential prognostic value of each OLGs, we constructed a univariate Cox proportional hazard regression model for each gene in the training dataset using the R package survival coxph function. A significance threshold of p < 0.001 was applied to identify 42 significantly different genes (Table 2). We utilized the R package glmnet for the Lasso Cox regression analysis, with the trajectory of each independent variable depicted in Figure 3A. The number of independent coefficients tends to increase as lambda increases gradually. We employed 3-fold cross-validation for model construction and analyzed the CI for each lambda, as illustrated in Figure 3B. The model reached its optimum at lambda = 0.046, leading to the selection of 12 target genes. We conducted a multivariate Cox analysis on these 12 genes, ultimately retaining the seven mRNAs with the lowest AIC.

We analyzed the relationship between RiskScore and patients' follow-up time, events, and changes in the expression of seven genes, and we could observe a significant decrease in the survival rate of patients as the RiskScore increased (Figure 3C). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Cox analyses indicated that 7-gene signature had a great predictive accuracy, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.703, 0.716, and 0.708 at 3, 5, and 7 years (Figure 3D), and could serve as an independent prognostic factor relative to other clinicopathologic characteristics (Figures 3E and 3F). The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis also observed a significant prognostic difference between the samples of different risk groups (p < 0.001, Figure 3G). Additionally, log rank tests demonstrated that the seven mRNAs had good potential to indicate prognosis and could markedly distinguish the prognosis of patients between the high and low groups (Figures S1C‒S1I).

To enhance predictive accuracy, a multivariate Cox analysis incorporating the 7-gene model, AJCC staging system, and clinicopathological characteristics was utilized to develop the LOG-CPI. This approach selectively retained RiskScore, stage, and age as variables, based on achieving the lowest AIC. The signature formula is as follows:LOG−CPI=0.269033235342189∗expRiskScore+0.52595219202537∗expStage+0.0492224627419527∗expAge

To assess the performance of LOG-CPI, we evaluated its predictive efficiency at 3, 5, and 7 years, as illustrated in Figure 3H. It demonstrated impressive predictive accuracy with high AUC values of 0.802, 0.828, and 0.786, respectively, indicating a significant improvement in prediction efficiency compared with former 7-gene RiskScore. Additionally, the predictive performance of LOG-CPI at 5 years was superior to the prognostic value of the existing model 13OncotypeDX, 47MammaPrint, 10Epclin, 30GC,30 7BCI,31 MSigDBscore, FFAscore, and the original AJCC clinical prognostic staging system (Figure 3I). The MSigDB score is an 8-gene prognostic signature based on lipid metabolism.32 The FFA score is a 6-gene index based on fatty acid metabolism, capable of predicting patient survival.33 We also calculated LOG-CPI based on the sample expression level and drew the sample’s risk score distribution (Figure 3J). Samples exhibiting high LOG-CPI values were significantly higher than those with low LOG-CPI, indicating a worse prognosis. Additionally, independent prognostic analyses based on univariate and multivariate Cox regression revealed that LOG-CPI serves as an independent prognostic factor. Compared with the earlier 7-gene RiskScore, the stability of LOG-CPI was notably enhanced, as evidenced by the narrower CI shown in Figures 3K and 3L. Finally, we stratified the LOG-CPI into high- and low-risk groups, plotted the K-M curve as shown in Figure 3M, and observed a notable disparity between the two groups (p < 0.001).

Robust validation of LOG-CPI in various cohortsTo assess the robustness of our model, we applied its coefficients to independent validation datasets, GEO: GSE21653 and METABRIC, with the median LOG-CPI score from the training set to differentiate between high- and low-risk subgroups. ROC was utilized to analyze the prognostic categorization efficiency of LOG-CPI.In the GEO cohort, the 3-, 5-, and 7-year ROC values were 0.815, 0.760, and 0.758 as depicted in Figure 4A. Meanwhile, for the METABRIC cohort, the 3-, 5-, and 7-year ROC values were 0.731, 0.751, and 0.792, respectively (Figure 4D). Significant prognostic differences were observed between the high- and low-risk-score groups in both cohorts (Figures 4B and 4E). Notably, the RiskScore distribution of the sample indicated a significantly higher proportion of deaths in the samples with a high RiskScore, consistent with the training set (Figures 4C and 4F). These results demonstrate the robustness of our signature, which consistently maintains a steady prognostic prediction capacity in various cohorts.Figure 4Robust validation of LOG-CPI in various cohorts(A and D) ROC curve of LOG-CPI classification in GEO and METABRIC testing cohort.(B and E) K-M survival analysis comparing two risk groups based on LOG-CPI classification.(C and F) Distribution of risk score and survival status of LOG-CPI in GEO and METABRIC testing cohort.(G) ROC analysis of LOG-CPI, CTS5, and TNM staging at 5-year follow-up in METABRIC cohort.(H) Survival curves comparing the two risk groups based on CTS5 classification in METABRIC cohort.(I and J) Univariate Cox analysis of clinicopathologic factors and the LOG-CPI score.(K and L) Multivariate Cox analysis of the factors significant in the univariate Cox analysis above (p < 0.05).CTS5 (Clinical Treatment Score post-5 years) is a clinicopathological model used to assess the residual risk of advanced distant metastases after 5 years of endocrine therapy in patients with hormone-receptor-positive BC. The risk prediction score in the model was created for the training set based on the ATAC study, and its validity was verified using the BIG 1-98 study as the validation set.34 To highlight the superiority of LOG-CPI, we calculated CTS5 risk score for each individual in the METABRIC dataset and compared the predictive accuracy of both by plotting ROC curves. The result showed that LOG-CPI was a better indicator of recurrence risk in LBC patients compared with CTS5 and TNM staging (5-year accuracy 0.751 vs. 0.713, 0.635; respectively, Figure 4G). Figure 4H showed the K-M curve for patients in the METABRIC cohort under the application of CTS5.In order to assess the clinical independence of LOG-CPI, we performed both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses on the various clinical variables (Figures 4I and 4J). In GEO and METABRIC datasets, univariate Cox regression analysis revealed significant associations between survival and variables such as age, grade, stage, ER status, PR status, menopause status, tumor size, lymph node state, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and LOG-CPI score. However, in the multivariate analysis (Figures 4K and 4L), only the LOG-CPI risk score, grade, stage, menopause status, lymph node state, and age were significantly associated with survival.These results indicate that LOG-CPI can serve as an independent risk factor for predicting the prognosis of patients with LBC.

To assess the robustness of our model, we applied its coefficients to independent validation datasets, GEO: GSE21653 and METABRIC, with the median LOG-CPI score from the training set to differentiate between high- and low-risk subgroups. ROC was utilized to analyze the prognostic categorization efficiency of LOG-CPI.

In the GEO cohort, the 3-, 5-, and 7-year ROC values were 0.815, 0.760, and 0.758 as depicted in Figure 4A. Meanwhile, for the METABRIC cohort, the 3-, 5-, and 7-year ROC values were 0.731, 0.751, and 0.792, respectively (Figure 4D). Significant prognostic differences were observed between the high- and low-risk-score groups in both cohorts (Figures 4B and 4E). Notably, the RiskScore distribution of the sample indicated a significantly higher proportion of deaths in the samples with a high RiskScore, consistent with the training set (Figures 4C and 4F). These results demonstrate the robustness of our signature, which consistently maintains a steady prognostic prediction capacity in various cohorts.Figure 4Robust validation of LOG-CPI in various cohorts(A and D) ROC curve of LOG-CPI classification in GEO and METABRIC testing cohort.(B and E) K-M survival analysis comparing two risk groups based on LOG-CPI classification.(C and F) Distribution of risk score and survival status of LOG-CPI in GEO and METABRIC testing cohort.(G) ROC analysis of LOG-CPI, CTS5, and TNM staging at 5-year follow-up in METABRIC cohort.(H) Survival curves comparing the two risk groups based on CTS5 classification in METABRIC cohort.(I and J) Univariate Cox analysis of clinicopathologic factors and the LOG-CPI score.(K and L) Multivariate Cox analysis of the factors significant in the univariate Cox analysis above (p < 0.05).

CTS5 (Clinical Treatment Score post-5 years) is a clinicopathological model used to assess the residual risk of advanced distant metastases after 5 years of endocrine therapy in patients with hormone-receptor-positive BC. The risk prediction score in the model was created for the training set based on the ATAC study, and its validity was verified using the BIG 1-98 study as the validation set.34 To highlight the superiority of LOG-CPI, we calculated CTS5 risk score for each individual in the METABRIC dataset and compared the predictive accuracy of both by plotting ROC curves. The result showed that LOG-CPI was a better indicator of recurrence risk in LBC patients compared with CTS5 and TNM staging (5-year accuracy 0.751 vs. 0.713, 0.635; respectively, Figure 4G). Figure 4H showed the K-M curve for patients in the METABRIC cohort under the application of CTS5.

In order to assess the clinical independence of LOG-CPI, we performed both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses on the various clinical variables (Figures 4I and 4J). In GEO and METABRIC datasets, univariate Cox regression analysis revealed significant associations between survival and variables such as age, grade, stage, ER status, PR status, menopause status, tumor size, lymph node state, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, and LOG-CPI score. However, in the multivariate analysis (Figures 4K and 4L), only the LOG-CPI risk score, grade, stage, menopause status, lymph node state, and age were significantly associated with survival.

These results indicate that LOG-CPI can serve as an independent risk factor for predicting the prognosis of patients with LBC.

Relation between LOG-CPI and pathwaysTo explore the relationship between risk scores and biological functions, we conducted the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify gene sets enriched in distinct LOG-CPI subgroups. The gene sets of the LOG-CPI-high samples were enriched in the chromosomes, cell cycle, and mitochondrial function pathways, such as GOBP_MITOCHONDRIAL_RESPIRATORY_CHAIN_COMPLEX_ASSEMBLY, GOCC_MITOCHONDRIAL_PROTEIN_CONTAINING_COMPLEX, KEGG_CELL_CYCLE, and KEGG_DNA_REPLICATION pathways (Figures 5A‒5C; p < 0.05, |NES|>1), whereas the gene sets of the LOG-CPI-low samples were enriched in extracellular matrix microenvironment and immune-related pathways, such as GOBP_CELL_CELL_ADHESION_VIA_PLASMA_MEMBRANE_ADHESION_MOLECULES, GOCC_COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_EXTRACELLULAR_MATRIX, GOMF_EXTRACELLULAR_MATRIX_STRUCTURAL_CONSTITUENT, KEGG_CYTOKINE_CYTOKINE_RECEPTOR_INTERACTION, KEGG_ADHERENS_JUNCTION and KEGG_ECM_RECEPTOR_INTERACTION pathways (Figures 5D‒5F; p < 0.05, |NES|>1). The detailed results of GSEA are listed in Figure S2.Figure 5Molecular characteristics of different LOG-CPI subgroups(A‒C) Gene sets enriched in LOG-CPI-high subgroups of different cohorts.(D‒F) Gene sets enriched in LOG-CPI-low subgroups of different cohorts.(G and H) Significantly mutated genes in LBC samples of different LOG-CPI subgroups.

Genome-wide analysis of the LOG-CPI genesWe analyzed gene mutations to gain further biological insights into the genomic nature of LOG-CPI subgroups. The LOG-CPI-high subgroup displayed notably higher mutation counts compared with the LOG-CPI-low subgroup (Figures 5G and 5H). The predominant mutation type was missing nucleotide mutations, followed by nonsense and frameshift deletions. We identified the top 20 genes with the most significant mutation frequencies within the LOG-CPI subgroup. Mutation rates of PIK3CA, TP53, TTN, and CDH1 were >10% in both groups. The LOG-CPI-high group showed a higher mutation frequency in TP53, TTN, CDH1, MAP3K1, and KMT2C, whereas the LOG-CPI-low group had a higher mutation frequency in PIK3CA and GATA3.The GSCALite database was utilized to conduct genome-wide analyses of these seven genes. The findings revealed that SHROOM2 exhibited the most prevalent mutation frequency at 37%, with GP2, ERCC6L, and RBBP8 each having mutation frequencies exceeding 15%. The mutation frequencies of GSN and CDK5R1 were >5%, whereas NKAIN1 gene had the lowest mutation frequency at 4% (Figure 5I). In Figures 5J and 5K, extensive heterozygous copy-number variation (CNV) mutations were observed in LOG-CPI genes across various cancer species, including amplification and deletion. Furthermore, compared with other cancer types, LOG-CPI genes exhibited a stronger association with more widespread mutations in BRCA. This indicates that LOG-CPI may regulate tumor behavior and status at the genetic level.

Potential implications of LOG-CPI on LBC therapy and landscape of tumor-immune microenvironmentTo further reveal the effect of LOG-CPI on the TME landscape, we analyzed the immune cell infiltration in the TME of LBC based on LOG-CPI classifications in both training and test datasets. The results revealed an increased presence of activated memory CD4+T cells and M1 macrophages, neutrophils, CD8+T cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and regulatory T cells in the TME of the high-LOG-CPI group. In contrast, naive B cells, monocytes, resting memory CD4+ T cells, eosinophils, and resting dendritic cells (DCs) were markedly enriched in the low-LOG-CPI group (Figures 6A–6F). We also linked patient immune cell infiltration scores to survival data, demonstrating that high enrichment of CD8+T cells, plasma cells, resting mast cells, and memory resting CD4+T cells indicated a significantly better prognosis in patients with LBC than in those with low expression, as evidenced by the longer PFS in TCGA, GEO, and METABRIC data (Figures S3A‒S3C). Interestingly, plasma cell was inconsistently enriched between the TCGA and METABRIC datasets. Furthermore, decreased activated dendritic cells (DCs) and M1 macrophages were associated with improved patient prognosis, suggesting that a broader range of cell subsets might contribute to cellular heterogeneity. Additionally, in the obese TME of LBC affected by LOG-CPI, immune cell reprogramming and heterogeneity may be more pronounced.Figure 6The landscape of the TME in LBC and the characteristics of different LOG-CPI subgroups(A‒C) LOG-CPI grouping and proportions of TME cells for patients in training and testing cohorts.(D‒F) TME cell proportions in different LOG-CPI subgroups. The dots scattered in the visualization depict the immune score of the two subgroups. Median values are denoted by the bold lines, whereas the box’s lower and upper boundaries indicate the upper quartile and lower quartile, respectively. The Wilcoxon test was utilized to evaluate significant statistical differences between the two subgroups (ns, not significant; ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗, p < 0.0001).(G‒I) Proportions of immune-related functions in different LOG-CPI subgroups.(J and K) Correlation heatmaps between the individual genes of LOG-CPI, each with the degree of immune cell infiltration and between immune cells (∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗∗∗, p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗, p < 0.0001).(L) Correlation plots between the 7-gene signature of LOG-CPI and immune checkpoint expression in the TIMER2.0 database.Consequently, ssGSEA was performed to evaluate 33 types of immune cells and 13 immune-associated function pathways in TCGA, GEO, and METABRIC datasets. Immune cell infiltration of both datasets, especially eosinophils, immature DCs, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, plasmacytoid DCs, activated B cells, central memory CD4+T cells, Tfh cells, and type Ⅰ T helper (Th1) cells, is much higher in the low-risk group than that of the high-risk group (Figures 6G–6I). Correlation heatmaps between individual genes in the model, each with the degree of immune cell infiltration, as well as among different immune cells are shown in Figures 6J and 6K. Correlations between individual genes and immune infiltration were also verified using the TIMER2.0 database (Figure S4). Similarly, high levels of activated B cells, CD56 bright NK cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and type Ⅱ interferon (IFN) response pathway affected the good prognosis of patients (Figures S3D‒S3F). The ssGSEA analysis revealed that low-risk patients exhibited higher scores for immune cell presence and immune function, which suggests that LOG-CPI may have a role in reflecting TME component and overall immune functional pathway. The 7-gene signature exhibited a negative correlation with immune checkpoint expression markers (CD27, CTLA4, and LAG3) and a positive correlation with genes linked to the cell cycle and resistance to endocrine therapy (CDKN1B, mTOR, RB1, WEE1, and HDACs). These findings suggest that LBC patients with a high LOG-CPI score might benefit more from targeted therapies, such as inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and HDAC inhibitors. These treatments are considered promising when used in combination with endocrine therapy, potentially enhancing therapeutic effectiveness for these patients.35 Conversely, LBC patients with a low LOG-CPI score could be more responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, further research is necessary to substantiate these hypotheses (Figure 6L).

To further reveal the effect of LOG-CPI on the TME landscape, we analyzed the immune cell infiltration in the TME of LBC based on LOG-CPI classifications in both training and test datasets. The results revealed an increased presence of activated memory CD4+T cells and M1 macrophages, neutrophils, CD8+T cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and regulatory T cells in the TME of the high-LOG-CPI group. In contrast, naive B cells, monocytes, resting memory CD4+ T cells, eosinophils, and resting dendritic cells (DCs) were markedly enriched in the low-LOG-CPI group (Figures 6A–6F).

However, further research is necessary to substantiate these hypotheses (Figure 6L).

Clinical validation of the predictive modelTo validate our findings, we analyzed 63 LBC tissue samples in our clinical cohort, which had a mean follow-up duration of 6.14 years. We performed independent experimental validation of the selected genes using RT-qPCR to build LOG-CPI. When we classified the LOG-CPI into high-risk (19 samples) and low-risk (44 samples) groups, a significant difference was observed in their survival outcomes as demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier curve analysis (p < 0.001, Figure 7A). The ROC analysis revealed that the predictive efficiencies of LOG-CPI had a high AUC area of 0.801, 0.792, and 0.788 at 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively (Figure 7B). Besides, the Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) is a composite scoring tool developed based on SOFT and TEXT prospective trial data to effectively assess the risk of recurrence and identify patients who would benefit from an intensive treatment regimen.36 Both STEPP and CTS5 mentioned earlier have been used in clinical practice for BC treatment. Based on this, we evaluated and compared the efficacies of LOG-CPI, CTS5, and STEPP in a clinical validation cohort using ROC analysis. The results revealed that the predictive performance of LOG-CPI at 5 years was superior to the prognostic values of CTS5 and STEPP (5-year accuracy 0.792 vs. 0.643, 0.64; respectively, Figure 7C). K-M curve plotting of CTS5 and STEPP is illustrated in Figures S1J and S1K. In addition to assessing the discrimination of model, we evaluated the calibration of LOG-CPI through the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which indicated that LOG-CPI predicts more stably and accurately than CTS5 and STEPP. Furthermore, the net reclassification index (NRI) and Brier score calculations provided a quantitative measure of calibration. The NRI demonstrated that the effectiveness of LOG-CPI improved by 0.29 and 0.27 over CTS5 and STEPP, respectively. Additionally, LOG-CPI’s Brier score of 0.126 surpassed those of CTS5 (0.156) and STEPP (0.151), further demonstrating its superior performance (Figure 7D). In further subgroup analyses of the First Hospital of China Medical University (CMU1H cohort) cohort, LOG-CPI was found to significantly impact overall prognosis (hazard ratio [HR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73 to 6.31, p < 0.001), confirming its role as a vital prognostic factor (Figure 7E). Notably, in BMI subgroup comparisons, LOG-CPI demonstrated a greater prognostic value in the high-BMI group compared with the low-BMI group (HR 7.84, p 0.039; HR 6.63, p 0.671, respectively), highlighting its particular relevance in obese patients. The broad 95% CI, however, attributed to the limited sample size, calls for further validation in a larger clinical cohort. Moreover, the analysis revealed that the effect of LOG-CPI was more pronounced in patients with luminal B subtype, clinical early-stage, or pathological grade II LBC (HR 4.51, p 0.001; HR 5.12, p < 0.001; and HR 4.73, p 0.005; respectively). Despite varying HRs and p values, LOG-CPI consistently emerged as a significant prognostic indicator across various age and menopausal state subgroups. In summary, this multivariate Cox subgroup analysis underscores the prognostic importance of LOG-CPI across diverse clinicopathologic characteristics, pinpoints high-risk subgroups, and offers valuable insights for clinical treatment strategies. The relative expression levels of the seven genes in LOG-CPI, comparing paired tumors with adjacent para-tumor tissues in the CMU1H cohort, were illustrated in Figures 7F and S1M. These findings were consistent with the DEGs identified in earlier RNAseq analysis, as depicted in Figure S1L.Figure 7Evaluating and verifying the prognostic ability of the model in CMU1H cohort(A) K-M survival analysis visualized the prognostic value of LOG-CPI for LBC subtypes.(B) LOG-CPI at 3-, 5-, and 7-year ROC in a clinical validation cohort.(C and D) Discrimination and calibration analysis of LOG-CPI and existing clinical prognostic models at 5-year follow-up in a clinical validation cohort.(E) Forest plot of LOG-CPI multivariate Cox regression subgroup analysis.(F) Bar plots depicting expression fold changes (FC) of the LOG-CPI’s seven genes between paired LBC and adjacent para-tumor tissues.

DiscussionDespite numerous advancements in comprehensive treatment strategies for LBC, there remains a deficiency in effective prognostic markers and targeted molecular therapies.37,38 The transformation of normal cells into malignant cells is accompanied by various biological alterations, with metabolic reprogramming being the most evident, including alterations in glycolysis, glutamate-driven anabolism, and irregular lipid synthesis.39 Evidence has revealed that dysregulated metabolism in cancer cells and TME is crucial in cancer progression, treatment, recurrence, and metastasis.40 Epidemiological research indicates that obesity and a diet rich in fats are significant risk determinants for BC. This connection is closely tied to the metabolic functions of fat, especially considering the presence of adipocytes in breast tissue.41 However, essential molecular markers linked to fat metabolism in LBC are still not well defined.In this study, we first identified genes associated with LBC using RNA-seq data from TCGA database. Furthermore, we performed WGCNA to detect coexpressed genes and modules, ultimately identifying 154 genes closely associated with obesity in BC. Finally, we formulated a 7-gene signature, with the TNM stage score and age of patients through Lasso and multivariate Cox analysis. The signature demonstrated consistent predictive accuracy across various datasets and showed a significant correlation to clinical pathology and immune cell infiltration.The gene signature was constructed using GSN, GP2, CDK5R1, NKAIN1, RBBP8, SHROOM2, ERCC6L, age, and the TNM stage scores. Bioinformatics and experiments have indicated that GP2, CDK5R1, NKAIN1, RBBP8, ERCC6L, and SHROOM2 are highly expressed, whereas GSN is poorly expressed in breast cancer tissues. Immune infiltration analysis revealed distinct correlations between gene expression and immune cell types. SHROOM2 and CDK5R1 expression were found to be negatively correlated with B cells, M2 macrophages, NK cells, and Th1 cells. Conversely, GSN and ERCC6L showed a positive correlation with memory CD4+ T cells. Additionally, NKAIN1 and RBBP8 exhibited significant negative correlations with CD8+ T cells and macrophages.Genome-wide analyses of the seven genes were conducted utilizing the GSCALite database. Our findings revealed that SHROOM2 exhibited the most frequent mutations. This research pioneers the recognition of SHROOM2 and NKAIN1 as potential prognostic indicators for BC. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between all seven genes and CNV in the majority of cancers, suggesting that CNV influences their expression to a degree. GP2 is an HLA-A2-restricted immunogenic peptide with high immunogenicity derived from the transmembrane domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2/neu (HER2/neu), which is one of the most extensively studied tumor-associated antigens for the development of BC vaccines.42 The GP2 peptide vaccine has been verified to stimulate patients with BC to produce antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and prompt a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response,43,44,45 considered essential for antitumor activity. A meta-analysis of the GP2 vaccine also indicated a robust immune response, marking a noticeable shift in CD8+ T cell counts in three research projects post-injection compared with pre-injection (95% CI 0.803–0.294, p < 0.05).46 In a phase I trial of the GP2 vaccine, Clifton GT et al. observed its ability to provoke an immune response in patients with BC, demonstrating its immunogenicity.47 In a clinical trial involving 180 patients by Mittendorf et al., the GP2 peptide vaccine demonstrated notable clinical benefits, with a PFS rate surpassing the control group (88% vs. 80%).48 CtIP, encoded by RBBP8, is a major homologous recombination repair factor with an evident connection to cancer, yet not fully understood.49,50 This protein has been implicated in interactions with tumor suppressor genes in several nuclear pathways. CtIP/RBBP8 was initially identified as a transcriptional corepressor that binds to various other transcription factors linked to cancer.51,52,53 Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in initiating the S phase and DNA replication as a negative regulator of RB1 and the G1 checkpoint.54,55 Additionally, CtIP/RBBP8 participates in DNA replication by binding to proliferating nuclear cell antigens (PCNA) and is crucial in minimizing replication-induced DNA breaks.56 CtIP is also a key regulator of the BRCA1/BRCA2 pathway and crucial in DNA damage detection, signaling, and repair, mainly through its interactions with BRCA1 and the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex.57,58 Research on early-onset BC patients without mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 indicated a prevalence of rare RBBP8 variants in this group. Additionally, it was found that CtIP significantly influences the maintenance of replication fork integrity.59
GSN, a highly effective member of the actin-severing superfamily, plays a vital role in controlling the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments.60,61
GSN is involved in many cellular properties of carcinogenic phenotypes and is intimately linked to different types of tumor development.62,63,64,65 Additionally, GSN is classified into secretory and cytosolic types, and secretory GSN may be valuable in diagnosing cancer.66
GSN is also associated with chemotherapy resistance.67,68 Cao et al. constructed a prognostic model using two DNA methylation probes, GSN cg13569051 and cg14399183, in BC patients with good prognostic ability.69 Excision repair cross-complementation group 6 like (ERCC6L), also known as polo-like kinase 1-interacting checkpoint helicase (PICH), plays a crucial role in chromosome separation during cell mitosis.70,71 Studies have linked ERCC6L to the cell cycle of breast cancer cells (BCCs). Specifically, the knockdown or silencing of ERCC6L expression in BCCs has been shown to significantly inhibit cell proliferation, arrest the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and induce apoptosis. This effect may be related to the RAB31-MAPK-CDK2 signaling pathway.72,73 Additionally, Yang et al. demonstrated that ERCC6L can accelerate the cell cycle through the regulation of p53/p21/CDK1/Cyclin B and PLK/CDC25C/CDK1/Cyclin B signaling pathways, thus promoting the malignant progression of BCCs.74 Furthermore, Huang et al. found that the knockdown of ERCC6L in TNBC cells leads to chromatin bridges and lagging chromosomes in anaphase, resulting in micronucleation or binucleation and eventually causing mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis.75 Moreover, ERCC6L has recently been identified as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in BC patients.76Many previous studies have attempted to identify and construct prognostic marker models for BC. For example, Xiao et al. identified an eight-transcript signature to stratify LBC samples into low- and high-risk groups using the TCGA dataset.77 Xu et al. used the Lasso Cox regression model to construct a cancer-associated fibroblast-associated gene signature in LBC.78 Chiodoni et al. established a 3-mRNA signature to aid treatment decisions in patients with LBC at risk of developing early locoregional recurrence.79 Additionally, genomic testing combined 70-gene and 80-gene signatures. Pellicane et al. constructed a signature to determine the 5-year outcome of LBC patients treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.80 However, several issues remain pertinent to the use of multi-gene testing for BC. First, genetic differences between ethnic groups may affect the test results, the effect of which remains unclear.Furthermore, clinical decision-making requires a combined analysis of clinicopathological features and genetic tools. Although multi-gene testing has demonstrated the reliability of its clinical application through validation studies, adjuvant treatment decisions for BC rely heavily on accurate clinicopathological features. Additionally, genetic testing products with confirmed testing qualifications and reliability are recommended. However, original products or institutions with testing qualifications are not yet available in some countries, and some institutions are only modeled on foreign standards for multi-gene testing without authorization or qualification. Therefore, the same sample may yield different results when tested at different institutions. Consequently, these results should be interpreted with caution in clinical applications.To compare and confirm the advantages of LOG-CPI based on OLGs, we analyzed the 10 existing clinical prognostic models previously mentioned. The results revealed that our model had an excellent AUC area, and the prognostic efficacy of the other models was lower than that of our signature, indicating that the model’s overall performance of the one surpassed that of the other 10 models. By utilizing fewer genes, our model yields more reasonable and efficient predictive results, reduces genetic testing duration, and is better aligned with clinical applications.In summary, we developed and validated a powerful model for predicting recurrence risk in patients with LBC, using diverse datasets. This model stands as an independent prognostic factor and demonstrates enhanced predictive accuracy relative to existing models. Therefore, we advocate for the application of this signature as a molecular biomarker for assessing prognostic risks in patients with LBC.Limitations of the studyAlthough LOG-CPI was based on a large sample of multi-omics data and was validated to have superior efficacy compared with previous multi-gene prognostic models, the study still had some limitations. First, each model’s clinical observation endpoint and evaluation indicators are different, and whether they are based on gene expression profiles or hormone receptor expression to identify BC subtype classification is inconsistent, which may cause heterogeneity in detection results and prediction efficiency. Second, high-risk factors for LBC, such as family history and ki67 expression level, which may also affect patient prognosis, were not included in this study. Moreover, the impacts of LOG-CPI on genomic mutations, signaling pathways, and the TME, as observed in this study, are predominantly derived from bioinformatics analyses and necessitate additional validation through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Finally, the validation set of this study was a small-sample retrospective study, and its reliability should be further verified in large-sample retrospective and prospective studies with long-term follow-up data. To further guide clinical practice, a subgroup analysis will be conducted on the correlation between LOG-CPI and various types of LBC treatment and its efficacy in obese patients with LBC. In conclusion, the LOG-CPI constructed with obesity characteristics has high value for precision treatment and clinical transformation; however, its clinical application still needs comprehensive and in-depth research.

Despite numerous advancements in comprehensive treatment strategies for LBC, there remains a deficiency in effective prognostic markers and targeted molecular therapies.37,38 The transformation of normal cells into malignant cells is accompanied by various biological alterations, with metabolic reprogramming being the most evident, including alterations in glycolysis, glutamate-driven anabolism, and irregular lipid synthesis.39 Evidence has revealed that dysregulated metabolism in cancer cells and TME is crucial in cancer progression, treatment, recurrence, and metastasis.40 Epidemiological research indicates that obesity and a diet rich in fats are significant risk determinants for BC. This connection is closely tied to the metabolic functions of fat, especially considering the presence of adipocytes in breast tissue.41 However, essential molecular markers linked to fat metabolism in LBC are still not well defined.

In this study, we first identified genes associated with LBC using RNA-seq data from TCGA database. Furthermore, we performed WGCNA to detect coexpressed genes and modules, ultimately identifying 154 genes closely associated with obesity in BC. Finally, we formulated a 7-gene signature, with the TNM stage score and age of patients through Lasso and multivariate Cox analysis. The signature demonstrated consistent predictive accuracy across various datasets and showed a significant correlation to clinical pathology and immune cell infiltration.

The gene signature was constructed using GSN, GP2, CDK5R1, NKAIN1, RBBP8, SHROOM2, ERCC6L, age, and the TNM stage scores. Bioinformatics and experiments have indicated that GP2, CDK5R1, NKAIN1, RBBP8, ERCC6L, and SHROOM2 are highly expressed, whereas GSN is poorly expressed in breast cancer tissues.

Experimental model and study participant detailsThe study was approved by the institutional review boards at Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of China Medical University and informed consent was obtained from each participant. Clinical information of patients involved is provided in Table S2. The data analyzed in this study were obtained from UCSC-XENA database, TCGA database, GEO database and METABRIC database. Tissue samples from LBC patients were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgical resection and preserved in liquid nitrogen.Method detailsData acquisition and preprocessingThe RNA-seq data of 1278 BC samples, comprising 1099 tumor samples and 179 adjacent normal samples, along with their associated clinicopathological details from the TCGA-TARGET-GTEx dataset were retrieved from the UCSC Xena platform (http://xena.ucsc.edu/). In the TCGA dataset, we excluded samples lacking clinical follow-up information and genes that had expression levels under 1 in over half of the samples.Additionally, we sourced RNA-seq data for 924 LBC samples along with clinicopathological details from the METABRIC cohort through the cBioPortal platform (http://www.cbioportal.org/). In the METABRIC dataset, we excluded samples lacking clinical follow-up information and genes that had expression levels under 1 in over half of the samples.Microarray data from 258 to 147 BC samples (GEO: GSE78958 and GEO: GSE21653), BMI, and survival information were obtained from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). In the GEO dataset, we excluded samples lacking clinical follow-up information and genes that had expression levels under 1 in over half of the samples.The PAM50 function was used for each public dataset to categorise the tumors and extract the LBC sample list. Table 1 displays the clinical information related to the LBC samples.Identification of OLGs and functional enrichment analysisUtilizing the RNA-seq data from BC samples sourced from TCGA-TARGET-GTEx dataset, we filtered DEGs between tumor and normal sample groups. This was achieved using the DESeq2 R package, setting criteria of FDR <0.05, |log2 Fold Change| > 1, and p < 0.05.24To identifi obesity-related central genes, we performed WGCNA on the GSE78958 dataset, searching for genes with co-expression and modules correlated with BMI. Initially, we built a similarity matrix based on expression data, determining the Pearson correlation coefficient between pairs of genes.Following that, the similarity matrix was converted into an adjacency matrix using a signed network, with a soft threshold set at β = 5. It was subsequently transformed into a topological matrix using the TOM to illustrate the relationship intensity between genes. To cluster the genes, a distance of 1-TOM was employed, and a dynamic pruning tree was utilized to identifi the modules.In the end, by setting the merging threshold function at 0.25, we distinguished 19 modules. From the notably associated modules, specifically the yellow module, OLGs were derived from the DEGs. To elucidate their unique biological relevance and pathways, we performed an analysis using GO and KEGG. This analytical process was carried out using the clusterProfiler R package.25Establishment and verification of the LOG-CPITCGA-BRCA (n = 717), GEO: GSE21653 (n = 147), and METABRIC (n = 924) databases were utilized to assess the potential prognostic value of the 154 OLGs in patients with LBC. We performed univariate Cox hazard regression analysis to generate OLGs significantly affecting PFS in the TCGA-LBC training set. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox analysis further refined the variables, diminishing the gene count in the prognostic model to seven by constructing a penalty function.26 We incorporated the AJCC staging system and clinicopathological characteristics into the seven-genes signature to enhance reliability and subjected them to multivariate COX regression analysis. Based on the screened variable expression values and Cox coefficients, we calculated the LOG-CPI for each sample by multiplying certain variable expression values by their respective weight in the Cox model and then summing them. Based on the median risk score, we categorized LBC patients into either high-risk or low-risk groups. We assessed the effectiveness of the LOG-CPI using K-M survival curves and log rank tests on the training dataset TCGA-BRCA, as well as on the test datasets GEO: GSE21653 and METABRIC cohorts, to detect clinical prognostic outcomes.Additionally, we conducted univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to ascertain if LOG-CPI serves as an independent prognostic indicator for LBC, considering various variables like age, grade, and AJCC clinical stage.We further measured the model’s efficacy by charting ROC curves and determining the AUC for LOG-CPI. Furthermore, time-dependent ROC curve analyses were conducted to obtain the AUC values for both the training and test datasets, utilizing the R package timeROC.For calibration of model, Hosmer-Lemeshow test was performed to plot a calibration curve. The NRI and Brier score calculations provided a quantitative measure of calibration.Cancer genome-wide analysis of genes and function enrichment analysis within two prognostic index groupsTo reveal relevant genetic alterations, information regarding these alterations were obtained from TCGA database. Gene mutations within the two LOG-CPI subgroups were then analyzed using both GSCALite (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/web/GSCALite/) and the Maftools R package.We carried out GSEA to identify crucial biological pathways27 and the underlying mechanisms between the high- and low-LOG-CPI score groups in the training set. This analysis utilized the R packages limma and clusterProfiler. Our reference molecular signature databases were “c5.go.v7.4.symbols.gmt” [GO] and “c2.cp.kegg.v7.4. symbols.gmt” [KEGG], with selection criteria set at |NES| ≥ 1, p < 0.05, and FDR <0.05. The top 7 pathways, based on NES, were displayed.Potential implications for immunotherapy based on LOG-CPI and tumor immune microenvironment landscape estimationTo identify the immunology features of LBC samples, we performed CIBERSORTx deconvolution algorithm (https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/) to assess the TME and estimate the relative proportions of 22 distinct immune cells. These proportions were then compared between the two LOG-CPI subgroups, helping to evaluate the prognostic model’s capability in predicting the TME condition. This comparison are illustrated in a landscape map. Furthermore, to delineate the immunology and molecular functions between the LOG-CPI subgroups, we applied ssGSEA using the R package GSVA28 to measure immune activity and pathways. K-M survival curves were used to explore differences for each immune cell in survival. The results were also validated using GEPIA229 and TIMER2.0 (https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/).Collection of clinical samples and quantitative Reverse-Transcription polymerase chain reactionWe collected BC and adjacent para-tumor tissues from 66 patients admitted to the CMU1H cohort diagnosed with LBC. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Ambion, Berlin, Germany) and subsequently converted to complementary DNA through reverse transcription, employing the PrimeScriptTM RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara Bio, Beijing, China). The quantification of gene expression was carried out using the Light Cycler 480 II Real-Time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). We normalized the relative mRNA levels to GAPDH, serving as an internal control, for the calculation of gene expression.Specific primer sequences for individual genes were supplied in Table S3.Quantification and statistical analysisWe conducted statistical analyses using R version 4.3.1. Depending on the nature of the data, differences between groups were determined using various statistical methods, such as the Chi-square test or the Wilcoxon test. Statistical outcomes are reported either as exact p values or using the following notation: ∗ for p < 0.05, ∗∗ for p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ for p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗ for p < 0.0001.

Tissue samples from LBC patients were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgical resection and preserved in liquid nitrogen.

Method detailsData acquisition and preprocessingThe RNA-seq data of 1278 BC samples, comprising 1099 tumor samples and 179 adjacent normal samples, along with their associated clinicopathological details from the TCGA-TARGET-GTEx dataset were retrieved from the UCSC Xena platform (http://xena.ucsc.edu/). In the TCGA dataset, we excluded samples lacking clinical follow-up information and genes that had expression levels under 1 in over half of the samples.Additionally, we sourced RNA-seq data for 924 LBC samples along with clinicopathological details from the METABRIC cohort through the cBioPortal platform (http://www.cbioportal.org/). In the METABRIC dataset, we excluded samples lacking clinical follow-up information and genes that had expression levels under 1 in over half of the samples.Microarray data from 258 to 147 BC samples (GEO: GSE78958 and GEO: GSE21653), BMI, and survival information were obtained from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). In the GEO dataset, we excluded samples lacking clinical follow-up information and genes that had expression levels under 1 in over half of the samples.The PAM50 function was used for each public dataset to categorise the tumors and extract the LBC sample list. Table 1 displays the clinical information related to the LBC samples.Identification of OLGs and functional enrichment analysisUtilizing the RNA-seq data from BC samples sourced from TCGA-TARGET-GTEx dataset, we filtered DEGs between tumor and normal sample groups. This was achieved using the DESeq2 R package, setting criteria of FDR <0.05, |log2 Fold Change| > 1, and p < 0.05.24To identifi obesity-related central genes, we performed WGCNA on the GSE78958 dataset, searching for genes with co-expression and modules correlated with BMI. Initially, we built a similarity matrix based on expression data, determining the Pearson correlation coefficient between pairs of genes.Following that, the similarity matrix was converted into an adjacency matrix using a signed network, with a soft threshold set at β = 5. It was subsequently transformed into a topological matrix using the TOM to illustrate the relationship intensity between genes. To cluster the genes, a distance of 1-TOM was employed, and a dynamic pruning tree was utilized to identifi the modules.In the end, by setting the merging threshold function at 0.25, we distinguished 19 modules. From the notably associated modules, specifically the yellow module, OLGs were derived from the DEGs. To elucidate their unique biological relevance and pathways, we performed an analysis using GO and KEGG. This analytical process was carried out using the clusterProfiler R package.25Establishment and verification of the LOG-CPITCGA-BRCA (n = 717), GEO: GSE21653 (n = 147), and METABRIC (n = 924) databases were utilized to assess the potential prognostic value of the 154 OLGs in patients with LBC. We performed univariate Cox hazard regression analysis to generate OLGs significantly affecting PFS in the TCGA-LBC training set. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox analysis further refined the variables, diminishing the gene count in the prognostic model to seven by constructing a penalty function.26 We incorporated the AJCC staging system and clinicopathological characteristics into the seven-genes signature to enhance reliability and subjected them to multivariate COX regression analysis. Based on the screened variable expression values and Cox coefficients, we calculated the LOG-CPI for each sample by multiplying certain variable expression values by their respective weight in the Cox model and then summing them. Based on the median risk score, we categorized LBC patients into either high-risk or low-risk groups. We assessed the effectiveness of the LOG-CPI using K-M survival curves and log rank tests on the training dataset TCGA-BRCA, as well as on the test datasets GEO: GSE21653 and METABRIC cohorts, to detect clinical prognostic outcomes.Additionally, we conducted univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to ascertain if LOG-CPI serves as an independent prognostic indicator for LBC, considering various variables like age, grade, and AJCC clinical stage.We further measured the model’s efficacy by charting ROC curves and determining the AUC for LOG-CPI. Furthermore, time-dependent ROC curve analyses were conducted to obtain the AUC values for both the training and test datasets, utilizing the R package timeROC.For calibration of model, Hosmer-Lemeshow test was performed to plot a calibration curve. The NRI and Brier score calculations provided a quantitative measure of calibration.Cancer genome-wide analysis of genes and function enrichment analysis within two prognostic index groupsTo reveal relevant genetic alterations, information regarding these alterations were obtained from TCGA database. Gene mutations within the two LOG-CPI subgroups were then analyzed using both GSCALite (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/web/GSCALite/) and the Maftools R package.We carried out GSEA to identify crucial biological pathways27 and the underlying mechanisms between the high- and low-LOG-CPI score groups in the training set. This analysis utilized the R packages limma and clusterProfiler. Our reference molecular signature databases were “c5.go.v7.4.symbols.gmt” [GO] and “c2.cp.kegg.v7.4. symbols.gmt” [KEGG], with selection criteria set at |NES| ≥ 1, p < 0.05, and FDR <0.05. The top 7 pathways, based on NES, were displayed.Potential implications for immunotherapy based on LOG-CPI and tumor immune microenvironment landscape estimationTo identify the immunology features of LBC samples, we performed CIBERSORTx deconvolution algorithm (https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/) to assess the TME and estimate the relative proportions of 22 distinct immune cells. These proportions were then compared between the two LOG-CPI subgroups, helping to evaluate the prognostic model’s capability in predicting the TME condition. This comparison are illustrated in a landscape map. Furthermore, to delineate the immunology and molecular functions between the LOG-CPI subgroups, we applied ssGSEA using the R package GSVA28 to measure immune activity and pathways. K-M survival curves were used to explore differences for each immune cell in survival. The results were also validated using GEPIA229 and TIMER2.0 (https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/).Collection of clinical samples and quantitative Reverse-Transcription polymerase chain reactionWe collected BC and adjacent para-tumor tissues from 66 patients admitted to the CMU1H cohort diagnosed with LBC. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Ambion, Berlin, Germany) and subsequently converted to complementary DNA through reverse transcription, employing the PrimeScriptTM RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara Bio, Beijing, China). The quantification of gene expression was carried out using the Light Cycler 480 II Real-Time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). We normalized the relative mRNA levels to GAPDH, serving as an internal control, for the calculation of gene expression.Specific primer sequences for individual genes were supplied in Table S3.
