We report the genetic and biochemical properties of a staurosporine (ST)- and 
temperature-sensitive mutant, stt10, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The stt10 
mutant shows an osmoremedial phenotype in a medium with 1 M sorbitol. ST 
sensitivity of the stt10 mutant was suppressed by overexpression of PKC1/STT1, 
showing the genetic interactions of STT10 with the PKC1/STT1 pathway. The 
nucleotide sequence of STT10 predicts a hydrophilic protein composed of 577 
amino acids that possesses 20-25% sequence similarity with yeast Slp1/Vam5p, 
Sec1p and Sly1p, and nematode Unc-18. The stt10 deletion mutant is viable and 
shows a typical class-D vacuolar protein sorting defective (vps) phenotype. 
Vacuoles from stt10 cells have a normal vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity, but are 
defective in vacuolar acidification. Genetic studies of yeast mutants carrying 
delta stt10, delta bck1, stt1/pkc1 or stt4 have revealed that their functions 
are phenotypically related to maintenance of cellular osmotic integrity.
