The actin filament-associated protein of 110 kDa (AFAP-110) was first identified 
as an SH3/SH2 binding partner for the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src. 
Subsequent data have demonstrated that AFAP-110 can interact with other Src 
family members. AFAP-110 contains additional protein binding modules including 
two pleckstrin homology domains, a leucine zipper motif and a target sequence 
for serine/threonine phosphorylation. AFAP-110 interacts with actin filaments 
directly via a carboxy terminal actin-binding domain. Thus AFAP-110 may function 
as an adaptor protein by linking Src family members and/or other signaling 
proteins to actin filaments. AFAP-110 also has an intrinsic capability to alter 
actin filament integrity that can be revealed upon conformational changes 
associated with phosphorylation or mutagenesis. Recent data has indicated that 
AFAP-110 may also serve to activate cSrc in response to this conformational 
change as well. Thus, AFAP-110 may function in several ways by (1) acting as an 
adaptor protein that links signaling molecules to actin filaments, (2) serving 
as a platform for the construction of larger signaling complexes, (3) serving as 
an activator of Src family kinases in response to cellular signals that alter 
its conformation and (4) directly effecting actin filament organization as an 
actin filament cross-linking protein. Here, we will review the structure and 
function of AFAP-110 as well as potential binding partners and effectors of 
AFAP-110's ability to alter actin filament integrity.
