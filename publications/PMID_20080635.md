Eukaryotic cells maintain proteostasis by quality control (QC) degradation. 
These pathways can specifically target a wide variety of distinct misfolded 
proteins, and so are important for management of cellular stress. Although a 
number of conserved QC pathways have been described in yeast, the E3 ligases 
responsible for cytoplasmic QC are unknown. We now show that Ubr1 and San1 
mediate chaperone-dependent ubiquitination of numerous misfolded cytoplasmic 
proteins. This action of Ubr1 is distinct from its role in the "N-end rule." In 
this capacity, Ubr1 functions to protect cells from proteotoxic stresses. Our 
phenotypic and biochemical studies of Ubr1 and San1 indicate that two strategies 
are employed for cytoplasmic QC: chaperone-assisted ubiquitination by Ubr1 and 
chaperone-dependent delivery to nuclear San1. The broad conservation of Ubr 
ligases and the relevant chaperones indicates that these mechanisms will be 
important in understanding both basic and biomedical aspects of cellular 
proteostasis.
