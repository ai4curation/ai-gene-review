PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2) was initially identified as a binding 
partner of BRCA2. It interacts also with BRCA1 forming a complex promoting DNA 
repair by homologous recombination. Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2 
and PALB2 DNA repair genes are associated with high risk of developing breast 
cancer. Mutation screening in these breast cancer predisposition genes is 
routinely performed and allows the identification of individuals who carry 
pathogenic variants and are at risk of developing the disease. However, variants 
of uncertain significance (VUSs) are often detected and establishing their 
pathogenicity and clinical relevance remains a central challenge for the risk 
assessment of the carriers and the clinical decision-making process. Many of 
these VUSs are missense variants leading to single amino acid substitutions, 
whose impact on protein function is uncertain. Typically, VUSs are rare and due 
to the limited genetic, clinical, and pathological data the multifactorial 
approaches used for classification cannot be applied. Thus, these variants can 
only be characterized through functional analyses comparing their effect with 
that of normal and mutant gene products used as positive and negative controls. 
The two missense variants BRCA2:c.91T >G (p.Trp31Gly) and PALB2:c.3262C >T 
(p.Pro1088Ser) were detected in two breast cancer probands originally 
ascertained at Breast Cancer Units of Institutes located in Milan and Bergamo 
(Northern Italy), respectively. These variants were located in the BRCA2-PALB2 
interacting domains, were predicted to be deleterious by in silico analyses, and 
were very rare and clinically not classified. Therefore, we initiate to study 
their functional effect by exploiting a green fluorescent protein 
(GFP)-reassembly in vitro assay specifically designed to test the BRCA2-PALB2 
interaction. This functional assay proved to be easy to develop, robust and 
reliable. It also allows testing variants located in different genes. Results 
from these functional analyses showed that the BRCA2:p.Trp31Gly and the 
PALB2:p.Pro1088Ser prevented the BRCA2-PALB2 binding. While caution is warranted 
when the interpretation of the clinical significance of rare VUSs is based on 
functional studies only, our data provide initial evidences in favor of the 
possibility that these variants are pathogenic.
