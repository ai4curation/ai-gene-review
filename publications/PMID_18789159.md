Gadd45 genes have been implicated in stress signaling in response to 
physiological or environmental stressors, which results in cell cycle arrest, 
DNA repair, cell survival and senescence, or apoptosis. Evidence accumulated 
implies that Gadd45 proteins function as stress sensors is mediated by a complex 
interplay of physical interactions with other cellular proteins that are 
implicated in cell cycle regulation and the response of cells to stress. These 
include PCNA, p21, cdc2/cyclinB1, and the p38 and JNK stress response kinases. 
What deterministic factors dictate whether Gadd45 and partner proteins function 
in either cell survival or apoptosis remains to be determined. An attractive 
working model to consider is that the extent of cellular/DNA damage, in a given 
cell type, dictates the association of different Gadd45 proteins with particular 
partner proteins, which determines the outcome.
