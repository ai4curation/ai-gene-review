Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved surveillance mechanism that 
eliminates imperfect mRNAs that contain premature translation termination codons 
(PTCs) and code for nonfunctional or potentially harmful polypeptides. We show 
that a novel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase, hSMG-1, is a 
human ortholog of a product of Caenorhabditis elegans smg-1, one of seven smg 
genes involved in NMD. hSMG-1 phosphorylates hUPF1/SMG-2 in vivo and in vitro at 
specific serine residues in SQ motifs. hSMG-1 can associate with hUPF1/SMG-2 and 
other components of the surveillance complex. In particular, overexpression of a 
kinase-deficient point mutant of hSMG-1, hSMG-1-DA, results in a marked 
suppression of the PTC-dependent beta-globin mRNA degradation; whereas that of 
wild-type hSMG-1 enhances it. We also show that inhibitors of hSMG-1 induce the 
accumulation of truncated p53 proteins in human cancer cell lines with p53 PTC 
mutation. Taken together, we conclude that hSMG-1 plays a critical role in NMD 
through the direct phosphorylation of hUPF1/SMG-2 in the evolutionally conserved 
mRNA surveillance complex.
