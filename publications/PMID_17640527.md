Neuronal L-type calcium channels contribute to dendritic excitability and 
activity-dependent changes in gene expression that influence synaptic strength. 
Phosphorylation-mediated enhancement of L-type channels containing the CaV1.2 
pore-forming subunit is promoted by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that 
target cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to the channel. Although PKA 
increases L-type channel activity in dendrites and dendritic spines, the 
mechanism of enhancement in neurons remains poorly understood. Here, we show 
that CaV1.2 interacts directly with AKAP79/150, which binds both PKA and the 
Ca2+/calmodulin-activated phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). Cotargeting of PKA and 
CaN by AKAP79/150 confers bidirectional regulation of L-type current amplitude 
in transfected HEK293 cells and hippocampal neurons. However, anchored CaN 
dominantly suppresses PKA enhancement of the channel. Additionally, activation 
of the transcription factor NFATc4 via local Ca2+ influx through L-type channels 
requires AKAP79/150, suggesting that this signaling complex promotes neuronal L 
channel signaling to the nucleus through NFATc4.
