Sensory cilium biogenesis within Caenorhabditis elegans neurons depends on the 
kinesin-2-dependent intraflagellar transport (IFT) of ciliary precursors 
associated with IFT particles to the axoneme tip. Here we analyzed the molecular 
organization of the IFT machinery by comparing the in vivo transport and 
phenotypic profiles of multiple proteins involved in IFT and ciliogenesis. Based 
on their motility in wild-type and bbs (Bardet-Biedl syndrome) mutants, IFT 
proteins were classified into groups with similar transport profiles that we 
refer to as "modules." We also analyzed the distribution and transport of 
fluorescent IFT particles in multiple known ciliary mutants and 49 new ciliary 
mutants. Most of the latter mutants were snip-SNP mapped and one, namely 
dyf-14(ks69), was cloned and found to encode a conserved protein essential for 
ciliogenesis. The products of these ciliogenesis genes could also be assigned to 
the aforementioned set of modules or to specific aspects of ciliogenesis, based 
on IFT particle dynamics and ciliary mutant phenotypes. Although binding assays 
would be required to confirm direct physical interactions, the results are 
consistent with the hypothesis that the C. elegans IFT machinery has a modular 
design, consisting of modules IFT-subcomplex A, IFT-subcomplex B, and a BBS 
protein complex, in addition to motor and cargo modules, with each module 
contributing to distinct functional aspects of IFT or ciliogenesis.
