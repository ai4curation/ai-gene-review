The effect of regucalcin, a regulatory protein in intracellular signaling 
system, on cell death and apoptosis was investigated. Sulforaphane, a naturally 
occurring isothiocyanate, is known to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in 
cancer cells, although its effect has not been clarified in the cloned rat 
hepatoma H4-II-E cells. Hepatoma H4-II-E cells (wild-type) and stable 
regucalcin/pCXN2-transfected cells were cultured for 72 h in a medium containing 
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells with subconfluency were changed to a medium 
containing either vehicle or sulforaphane (10(-7) or 10(-6) M) in the absence of 
FBS. After medium change, cells were cultured for 24, 48, or 72 h. The number of 
wild-type cells was significantly decreased in the presence of sulforaphane 
(10(-7) or 10(-6) M). Agarose gel electrophoresis showed the presence of 
low-molecular-weight deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments of adherent wild-type 
cells cultured with sulforaphane (10(-7) or 10(-6) M) for 24 h. Sulforaphane 
(10(-7) or 10(-6) M)-induced cell number and DNA fragmentation was significantly 
suppressed in transfectants. The effect of sulforaphane (10(-6) M) in decreasing 
the number of wild-type cells was significantly prevented in the presence of 
caspase-3 inhibitor (10(-9) M), while the presence of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine 
methylester (NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, did not prevent 
sulforaphane-induced death of wild-type cells. Sulforaphane (10(-6) M) did not 
have a significant effect on cell number of transfectants in the presence of 
caspase-3 inhibitor or NAME. This study demonstrates that sulforaphane induces 
cell death and apoptosis in the cloned rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells, and that 
overexpression of regucalcin suppresses sulforaphane-induced apoptotic cell 
death which is partly mediated through caspase-3..
