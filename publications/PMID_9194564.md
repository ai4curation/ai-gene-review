The tumour suppressor p53 is a transcriptional regulator whose ability to 
inhibit cell growth is dependent upon its transactivation function. Here we 
demonstrate that the transcription factor CBP, which is also implicated in cell 
proliferation and differentiation, acts as a p53 coactivator and potentiates its 
transcriptional activity. The amino-terminal activation domain of p53 interacts 
with the carboxy-terminal portion of the CBP protein both in vitro and in vivo. 
In transfected SaoS-2 cells, CBP potentiates activation of the mdm-2 gene by p53 
and, reciprocally, p53 potentiates activation of a Gal4-responsive target gene 
by a Gal4(1-147)-CBP(1678-2441) fusion protein. A double point mutation that 
destroys the transactivation function of p53 also abolishes its binding to CBP 
and its synergistic function with CBP. The ability of p53 to interact physically 
and functionally with a coactivator (CBP) that has histone acetyltransferase 
activity and with components (TAFs) of the general transcription machinery 
indicates that it may have different functions in a multistep activation 
pathway.
