Fungal cytokinesis requires the assembly of a dividing septum wall. In yeast, 
the septum has to be selectively digested during the critical cell separation 
process. Fission yeast cell wall α(1-3)glucan is essential, but nothing is known 
about its localization and function in the cell wall or about cooperation 
between the α- and β(1-3)glucan synthases Ags1 and Bgs for cell wall and septum 
assembly. Here, we generate a physiological Ags1-GFP variant and demonstrate a 
tight colocalization with Bgs1, suggesting a cooperation in the important early 
steps of septum construction. Moreover, we define the essential functions of 
α(1-3)glucan in septation and cell separation. We show that α(1-3)glucan is 
essential for both secondary septum formation and the primary septum structural 
strength needed to support the physical forces of the cell turgor pressure 
during cell separation. Consequently, the absence of Ags1 and therefore 
α(1-3)glucan generates a special and unique side-explosive cell separation due 
to an instantaneous primary septum tearing caused by the turgor pressure.

mainly present in the primary septum and a small amount in the cell wall (Humbel et al., 2001; Cortés et al., 2007). L-BG is necessary but not

pombe contains four additional Ags1 homologues (Mok11–14), which
are only detected during sporulation (García et al., 2006). αGS orthologues are not found in

essential for both secondary septum formation and the primary septum robustness
needed to support the turgor pressure during cell separation. Our findings bring to
light convergent similarities between the primary septum α(1-3)glucan and the

functions within similar structures.

Introduction

Fungal cytokinesis requires concomitant contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) closure and
the synthesis of a special cell wall structure termed septum (Pollard and Wu, 2010). Schizosaccharomyces
pombe medial fission displays several stages: CAR positioning and
assembly, activation of CAR contraction and septum formation by the septation
initiation network (SIN), septum synthesis, and cell separation (Sipiczki, 2007; Krapp and Simanis, 2008). The septum is a three-layered
structure composed of a middle disk named primary septum, flanked at both sides by
the secondary septum (Johnson et al.,
1973). The last step of cytokinesis is cell separation that requires
degradation of the primary septum and the adjacent cell wall (septum edging) by
glucanases. Therefore, correct assembly and structural integrity of the septum are
vital for cell survival.

The fission yeast cell wall consists of an outer layer rich in galactomannoproteins
and an inner layer comprised of β(1-3), β(1-6), and
α(1-3)glucans (Pérez and Ribas,
2004; Grün et al., 2005).
Immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) studies delimited the branched β(1-6)glucan
in the cell wall and secondary septum, the branched β(1-3)glucan in the cell
wall and both primary and secondary septum, and a linear β(1-3)glucan (L-BG)
mainly present in the primary septum and a small amount in the cell wall (Humbel et al., 2001; Cortés et al., 2007). L-BG is necessary but not
sufficient for primary septum formation and is the polysaccharide that specifically
interacts with the fluorochrome Calcofluor white (CW) in S. pombe
(Cortés et al., 2007). In
addition to β-glucans, other polysaccharides, like the α(1-3)glucan,
may be present in the primary septum as well. α(1-3) and branched
β(1-3)glucans are essential for cell shape maintenance. However, their
importance for cell wall and septum structure and function is still unknown (Ribas et al., 1991; Hochstenbach et al., 1998; Katayama et al., 1999).

S. pombe contains three essential β(1-3)glucan synthases
(βGSs) that localize in CAR, septum, growing poles, and sites of wall
synthesis during sexual differentiation. Bgs1 appears earlier in the division site
and is responsible for the L-BG and primary septum synthesis. Bgs4 is essential for
cell integrity and is the only subunit shown to form part of the βGS enzyme.
Bgs3 function remains unknown (Cortés et
al., 2002, 2005, 2007; Liu
et al., 2002; Martín et al.,
2003; Martins et al., 2011).

Ags1 (Mok1) is a putative α-glucan synthase (αGS) essential for cell
integrity. Indirect immunofluorescence detected Ags1 in dividing and growing areas
(Hochstenbach et al., 1998; Katayama et al., 1999). S.
pombe contains four additional Ags1 homologues (Mok11–14), which
are only detected during sporulation (García et al., 2006). αGS orthologues are not found in
budding yeasts but are widely extended in pathogenic fungi (Edwards et al., 2011; Henry
et al., 2012).

In this work, we have investigated the localization and requirements of Ags1 and
found a tight colocalization with Bgs1, although they differ in their SIN dependence
for medial positioning. We show for the first time that α(1-3)glucan is
essential for both secondary septum formation and the primary septum robustness
needed to support the turgor pressure during cell separation. Our findings bring to
light convergent similarities between the primary septum α(1-3)glucan and the
lamella pectin of plants, as both are essential for the adhesion and separation
functions within similar structures.

ResultsAgs1 localizes in the growing sites during vegetative and sexual
phasesWe examined the physiological localization of Ags1 by generating functional
Ags1-GFP and -RFP fusions (Fig. 1 A,
Fig. S1
A, and Materials and methods). During polar growth Ags1 was
localized to the growing ends. Before the primary septum was detected, Ags1
simultaneously appeared in the growing ends and as a medial ring. After the
primary septum was detected, Ags1 spread flanking the emerging septum and
accumulating in the CAR. An obvious signal remained along the invaginated
membrane, appearing as two separated bands after septum completion (Fig. 1, B and C; and Fig. S1 B).Figure 1.Ags1 localizes in the growing sites during vegetative and sexual

Spores were collected after 10 d and incubated in YES medium. Samples
were taken after 2 to 11 h. Bars, 2.5 µm.Like the Bgs subunits, Ags1 was also present in all of the sites of wall
synthesis during sexual differentiation: mating, spore formation, and spore
germination (Fig. 1, D and E; and Fig.
S1, D and E). These data suggest that Ags1 cooperates with the Ags1 homologues
and Bgs proteins in cell fusion, spore wall formation, and spore
germination.Ags1 coincides spatially and temporally with Bgs1 in the growing sites:
poles, CAR, and septumAs Ags1 and Bgs1 are the only GSs found in the medial region before the septum is
detected, their localization and displacement from the tips to the CAR during
mitosis was simultaneously analyzed. Time-lapse images showed that before the
primary septum was detected (Fig. 2 A,
arrow) Ags1 and Bgs1 colocalized as medial faint dots (Fig. 2 A, arrowhead). Furthermore, both Ags1 and Bgs1
concentrated in a ring that moved with the edge of the growing septum. However,
the Ags1 signal remaining along the invaginated membrane was more intense than
that of Bgs1 (Fig. 2 B and Fig. S1 C).
During cell separation, Ags1 and Bgs1 remained at both sides of the degrading
septum and moved simultaneously to the old end of each cell (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2.Ags1 coincides spatially and temporally with Bgs1 in the growing
sites: CAR, septum, and poles. (A) Ags1 and Bgs1 colocalize

Bars, 2.5 µm.We tested for a physical interaction finding that physiological Bgs1 and Ags1
coimmunoprecipitate (Fig. 2 E). This
suggests either a physical interaction or the close presence of both proteins in
the same plasma membrane domains.Ags1 localization depends on the polarity establishment proteins, the
polarized actin patches, and the polarized exocytosisAgs1 localized to the poles during polar growth. tea1-1 and
tea2-1 mutants fail to reinstate polarized growth along the
long axis of the cell (Verde et al.,
1995). In these mutants, Ags1 localized to the incorrect new growing
tips (Fig. 3 A, left). On the contrary,
the microtubule cytoskeleton was dispensable for the correct localization and
displacement of Ags1 to poles and septum (Fig. 3
A, right and bottom).Figure 3.Ags1 localization depends on the polarity establishment proteins,
polarized actin patches, and polarized exocytosis. (A) Ags1

depends on the exocytosis. sec8-1
ags1+-GFP cells were
shifted to 37°C for 2 h. Bars, 5 µm.Actin localization coincides with that of Ags1 throughout the cell cycle (Katayama et al., 1999). Therefore, we
analyzed whether the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the correct Ags1
localization. In the actin mutant cps8-188 the actin patches
appeared depolarized (Ishiguro and Kobayashi,
1996), and Ags1 extended from the septum and poles along the plasma
membrane all around the cell (Fig. 3 B,
left). In contrast, polymerized F-actin was unnecessary for stable Ags1
localization in growing sites (Fig. 3 B,
middle).Formin For3 and type V myosin Myo52 are responsible for polarized actin cable
assembly and transport of cargoes along the actin cables, respectively (Feierbach and Chang, 2001; Win et al., 2001). In the absence of For3
or Myo52, Ags1 localized correctly to the growing poles and septum (Fig. 3 B, right). These findings are in
agreement with the fact that loss of function of profilin Cdc3, essential for
actin cable formation (Balasubramanian et al.,
1994), still permitted polarized growth and localization of Ags1 in
cell tips (Fig. 3 B, bottom).The exocyst is essential for polarized fusion of secretory vesicles with the
plasma membrane (Wang et al., 2002). In
the exocyst mutant sec8-1, Ags1 accumulated in the surrounding
areas of tips and septa but no signal was detected in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 C). Thus, Ags1 localization to
regions of active cell wall synthesis depends on the correct actin patch
localization and the polarized exocytosis.Ags1 localization in the division site depends on the CAR formation and
positioning, but not on the SIN pathwayTo study the Ags1 requirements during septation, Ags1 localization in mutants
affected in CAR positioning and formation was analyzed. In mid1
mutants (Chang et al., 1996), CAR and
primary septum are positioned at arbitrary sites, always coincident with Bgs1,
but not with Bgs4 (Cortés et al.,
2005). In the mid1-366 mutant, Ags1 was always
coincident with septum alterations and Bgs1 localization (Fig. 2 D).In the CAR formation mutants (Balasubramanian et
al., 1994; Fankhauser et al.,
1995) Ags1 was detected at cell poles and/or coincident with the
incorrect septum structures (Fig. 4 A and
unpublished data). The F-Bar protein Cdc15 is essential for CAR maturation. The
cdc15-140 mutant does not form aberrant septum structures
but generates an unstable CAR that rapidly disappears (Hachet and Simanis, 2008). To know whether this defective
CAR is sufficient for a transient Ags1 localization to the cell middle,
time-lapse of cdc15-140 cells at restrictive temperature and
expressing both Ags1-RFP and Rlc1-GFP (CAR labeling) was performed (Fig. 4 B). In these cells Ags1 was never
detected in the medial cortex, indicating that a stable CAR is essential for
Ags1 localization in the division site.Figure 4.Ags1 localization in the division site depends on the CAR
formation, but not on the SIN pathway. (A) cdc12-112

µm.The SIN is a signaling network required for CAR contraction and septum formation
in S. pombe (Barral and
Liakopoulos, 2009). Thus, we examined whether Ags1 medial
localization depends on the SIN. The SIN mutants suffer a cytokinesis blockage
after mitosis, building a CAR that disassembles prematurely rather than
undergoing constriction and septum synthesis (Sparks et al., 1999; Krapp et al.,
2001; Rosenberg et al.,
2006). In these mutants, Ags1 localized to the poles and as a broad band
in the cell middle (Fig. S2
A, arrow; and unpublished data), indicating that the SIN is not
necessary for Ags1 displacement to the middle during cytokinesis.To know if the Ags1 medial localization in SIN mutants occurs specifically during
mitosis and during or after CAR presence, time-lapses of SIN mutants expressing
both Ags1-GFP and Hht1-RFP (nucleus labeling) or Ags1-RFP and Rlc1-GFP were
performed. During mitosis and after CAR assembly (Fig. 4 D, arrowhead) Ags1 disappeared from the tips and
concentrated in the cell cortex surrounding the CAR and the mitotic nuclei.
However, Ags1 never became concentrated as a ring structure; instead, it spread
as a broad band as CAR collapsed (Fig. 4, C and
D, arrow; and Fig. S2 B). When the nuclei were closely paired and the
cell reinitiated bipolar growth, Ags1 moved to both cell tips. Similar Ags1
medial localization and dynamics were observed during the second round of
mitosis (Fig. 4 C, arrow).Occasionally some SIN mutant cells maintained the CAR longer, and in this case
Ags1 concentrated as a ring overlapping the CAR that was able to constrict,
giving rise to CW-stained septum structures (Fig. S2, C and D [Ags1, arrow; CW,
arrowhead). Interestingly, the emergence of these septum structures frequently
coincided with cell death before growth reinitiation, but never with septum
completion.In agreement with the SIN dependence of Cdc15 recruitment to the CAR, the
cdc15-140 mutant shows a similar cytokinesis phenotype to
that of SIN mutants (Hachet and Simanis,
2008). However, Ags1 did not localize in the cell middle of
cdc15-140 cells grown at a restrictive temperature (Fig. 4 B and unpublished data). Thus,
time-lapse of cdc15-140 cells growing at low restrictive
temperature was performed. The cdc15-140 cells displayed a more
stable and uniform CAR that still disassembled prematurely (Fig. 4 E, arrowhead). In this case and like in SIN
mutants, Ags1 appeared in the medial site and spread along the cell cortex as
CAR collapsed (Fig. 4 E, arrow). These
observations indicate that Ags1 displacement to the cell middle depends on a
stable CAR, whereas the SIN signaling is exclusively needed for Ags1
localization in a ring structure.Ags1 is essential for the septum integrity at the start of cell
separationTo study the lethal effect of the absence of Ags1, a strain expressing a single
integrated ags1+ copy under the control of
the thiamine-repressible 81X-nmt1+ promoter
was analyzed (see Materials and methods). Cell growth arrested after 4 h of
ags1+ repression and osmotic
stabilization protected the cells, delaying the growth arrest to at least 12 h
(Fig. 5 A, left). Morphological
observations revealed that Ags1 depletion promotes cell lysis and cytoplasm
release from the lateral region of the poles (Fig. 5 B, arrowhead) and mostly from the septum (Fig. 5 B, arrow). Total lysis reached 70%
of the cells (n = 420) after 7 h of repression, and
sorbitol reduced it to 7% (n = 986; Fig. 5 A, right). A similar lysis phenotype was observed
in the mok1-664 mutant at a restrictive temperature (Fig. 5 C). In agreement with previous data
from ags1+ point mutants (Hochstenbach et al., 1998; Katayama et al., 1999), the Ags1-depleted
cells showed a considerable reduction (53%) in the cell wall α-glucan
content (Table 1).Figure 5.Absence of Ags1 promotes cell lysis and release of cytoplasmic

cells was examined in detail by time-lapse (Fig.
5 D and Video
1). The lysis always appeared after septum completion, coincident
with the start of cell separation. After 3 h of
ags1+ repression, lysis mostly occurred
at the septum–cell wall border in only one cell (13% cells,
n = 238; Fig. 5
D, top graph), generating one dead cell (arrowhead, top) attached to
the living cell. After 7 h, lysis mostly occurred in both cells (41% cells,
n = 420; Fig. 5
D, bottom graph) at both sides of the septum–cell wall border
(arrowhead, bottom). Sorbitol delayed the cell lysis to 7 h. At this time most
of the cells were still normal in growth and morphology (see graphs in Fig. 5, A and D).Because Ags1 and Bgs1 might collaborate in the initial steps of septum formation,
a possible genetic interaction was tested. Bgs1 and Ags1 interact genetically
because the cps1-12 mok1-664 mutant was more sensitive to
temperature than the single mutants (Fig. S3
A). However, we found that the absence or defective function of
Bgs1 (81X-bgs1+ or cps1-12
mutant) suppressed the lytic phenotype of either Ags1 absence or
mok1-664 mutation (Fig. S3 B). Interestingly, whereas
cps1-12 produced multi-septated cells, the cps1-12
mok1-664 mutant arrested with no septa, suggesting collaboration
between both proteins in septum and cell wall synthesis (Fig. S3 B). In
agreement, the combined absence of both Bgs1 and Ags1 promoted strong
cytokinesis defects not observed with Bgs1 absence alone (Fig. S3 B, arrow).A possible genetic interaction between ags1+
and SIN genes was also tested, finding that the mok1-664 SIN
double mutants are more sensitive to temperature than the single mutants (Fig.
S3 A). The SIN mutants do not form septa, and therefore, the lysis of
mok1-664 mutant at the start of cell separation was
abolished. Instead, a new and abundant lysis at the pole tip appeared (Fig. S3
C), indicating that Ags1 is also essential for cell wall integrity during
polarized growth. In some cases, the SIN mutants lysed at the septum. This was
due to the initiation of defective septa that cannot be completed. As expected,
the mok1-664 mutation increased the septum lysis defect of the
SIN mutants (Fig. S3 C).The absence of Ags1 alters the cell wall ultrastructure and leads to cell
lysis at the lateral region of the polesTo further investigate the cell integrity defect caused by the absence of Ags1,
the cell wall ultrastructure was examined (Fig.
6, A and C). The wild-type (WT) cell wall presented a three-layered
structure (Fig. 6 A), whereas in the
absence of Ags1 the cell wall became amorphous, thicker, and looser, with no
signs of the outer dense layer. In the presence of sorbitol the wall appeared
stratified with remedial internal dense and transparent layers (Fig. 6 A, ICW). This is in agreement with
the different cell wall amounts detected with and without sorbitol. The cell
wall increase detected with sorbitol was only due to β-glucan, suggesting
a compensatory mechanism (Table 1).Figure 6.Absence of Ags1 alters the cell wall structure and composition and
causes a lack of cell wall in the pole lateral region, which leads
to lysis and cytoplasm release. (A) Ags1 depletion promotes
general cell wall ultrastructure alterations, thicker and uniformly
transparent in the absence (top-right panels) or multilayered in the
presence of sorbitol (bottom-right panels). Cells were grown in
EMM+T for 3 (−S, top panels) or 9 h (+S, bottom

cells). FITC fluorescence (mannoproteins amount) was quantified by using
arbitrary units (see Materials and methods). Bar, 5 µm. (C) Ags1

(Horisberger and Rouvet-Vauthey,
1985). Because the outer layer was absent in Ags1-depleted cell
walls, WT cells expressing Hht1-RFP (nuclear RFP) and
ags1+-repressed cells (no nuclear RFP)
were mixed, stained with FITC-concanavalin A, and visualized for FITC and RFP
(Fig. 6 B). Concanavalin A
specifically binds to mannose residues, which can be used for indirect
measurement of the mannan content and localization in the cell surface (Goldstein, 2002). Quantitative analysis
of the FITC signal showed that in Ags1-depleted cells the outer galactomannan
content was significantly reduced (Fig. 6
B), in agreement with the 36% decrease observed by cell wall
fractionation (Table 1).WT cells are surrounded by a uniform cell wall (Figs. 6 C and 7 A). In
contrast, the cell wall of Ags1-depleted cells was irregular and displayed
erosions in the pole lateral region (Fig. 6
C, open arrowhead; see also Fig. 9
C) and attached wall material from the sister cell (Fig. 6 C, closed arrowhead; see also Fig. 9 C).Figure 7.Ags1 is responsible for the secondary septum formation and the
correct primary septum structure. (A) WT cell morphology and

top) 1 µm; (rest of panels) 0.5 µm.The Ags1-depleted cells demonstrated cell lysis and cytoplasm release during
polar growth. To study more precisely cell wall breakage, time-lapse of
ags1+-repressed cells was performed.
Lysis always occurred not at the cell tip, but at the pole side region (Fig. 6 D, arrowhead). Lysis was detected at
early repression times and increased during repression, reaching 8% of the cells
at 7 h (n = 420; Fig. 6
D, graph). In the presence of sorbitol, lysis was delayed and reduced
to 2% after 7 h of repression (n = 986; Fig. 6 D, graph). Interestingly, when the
cells grown with sorbitol were imaged in the absence of sorbitol, the pole
lateral lysis increased to 28% while the septum lysis remained in 6%
(n = 453, not depicted). These data indicate that
Ags1 and the corresponding α(1-3)glucan are essential to maintain cell
wall structure and integrity during cell growth.Ags1 is responsible for both secondary septum synthesis and correct primary
septum formationTo study in more detail the role of Ags1 in septum synthesis, the septum
ultrastructure of Ags1-depleted cells was analyzed. WT cells presented a
three-layered septum structure (Fig. 7
A). As the primary septum grew, the secondary septum was laid down at
both sides. After septum closure, the septum thickness increased in a maturation
process involving additional secondary septum synthesis. The final septum
displayed a primary septum invading the cell wall (arrow) and flanked by two
triangular electron-dense structures termed “materiel triangulaire
dense” (MTD; Johnson et al.,
1973; Fig. 7 A, bottom).The Ags1-depleted cells presented strong septum defects of abruptly twisted
(Fig. 7, B–D) and not anchored
primary septa (arrow) and disorganized MTD structures (Fig. 7, C and D). This indicates that Ags1 is essential
for a straight primary septum synthesis, and suggests an important Ags1
cooperation with Bgs1 and the CAR. In addition, Ags1 is also essential for
primary septum anchorage and MTD assembly. Sorbitol delayed the lytic phenotype,
revealing a primary septum synthesized with no secondary septum (Fig. 7 C). At longer repression times, a
new remedial internal cell wall (ICW) layer appeared (Figs. 6 A and 7 D).
The primary septum could not drill the cell wall, but instead the base appeared
anchored to the new ICW, which extended along the naked primary septum. This in
turn gave rise to a new three-layered septum structure with a twisted primary
septum flanked by remedial secondary septa (Fig.
7 D).Ags1 is essential for the primary septum strength needed to support the cell
separation internal pressureThe analysis of ags1+-repressed cells showed
that all of the cells separated asymmetrically and stayed coupled by their side
(Fig. 8 A, arrowhead). Quantification
showed that 21% of WT cells (n = 1,260) were in the
separation process, which was straight and symmetrical (arrow). However, 41% of
Ags1-depleted cells (n = 1,487) were in the separation
process, which always was asymmetrical, or remained connected by their side
after separation (Fig. 8 A, graph).Figure 8.Ags1 is responsible for the strength of the primary septum
structure needed during cell separation. (A) Ags1-depleted
cells exclusively display asymmetrical cell separation and remain
attached by their side. Arrow: normal straight separation; arrowhead:
asymmetrical separation. Cells were grown in EMM+T+S for 8
h. The percentage of each cell separation was quantified. (B) WT cells
separate gradually (top panels), whereas the Ags1-depleted cells suffer
an immediate side-explosive separation. Cells were grown in EMM+T
for 3 h and imaged. Asterisk, time spent for maximal new end curvature.
Broken arrow: first separation step of symmetrical cell wall
degradation. (C) Loss of Ags1 function promotes a side-explosive
separation similar to that of Ags1 absence. mok1-664
cells were shifted to 37°C for 1 h and imaged. (D) The
side-explosive cell separation (curved arrow) occurs instantly, in the
interval between two image captures. Cells were grown as in A. (E) The
side-explosive separation is caused by an abrupt primary septum tearing,
which remains intact in the new poles for a long time. Cells from B were
visualized by CW staining. Elapsed time is shown in seconds. Bars, 5
µm.To further assess the nature of this defect, cell separation was monitored by
time-lapse. WT cell separation was progressive and symmetrical (Video
2). The first step was a small symmetrical jump (t = 40;
Fig. 8 B, Fig. S4
A, and Video
5) caused by the physical force of the turgor pressure after
degradation of the septum edging. Next, progressive and symmetrical degradation
of the primary septum was accompanied by a gradual curvature of the secondary
septum to reach the most stable conformation in the new end.Interestingly, cell separation in Ags1-depleted cells was instantaneous and
asymmetrical, with a ripped primary septum, usually giving rise to one sister
cell remaining attached to the well surface, and the other cell quickly jumping
but staying connected by its side to the sister cell (Videos
3 and 4). This side-explosive phenotype was caused by asymmetrical
degradation and/or breakage of the septum edging followed by an abrupt tear of a
weak primary septum and an instantaneous curvature of the secondary septum (t
= 20; Fig. 8 B, Fig. S4 B, and
Videos
6–9). The secondary septum of WT cells needed 5 min from
the separation start for a complete curvature, whereas in the absence of Ags1
this occurred in as much as 20 s (first captured image, asterisk, Fig. 8 B and Fig. S4 B). Cells imaged by
normal microscopy showed that the abrupt primary septum tearing occurs in just
the time spent between two image captures (1 s; Fig. 8 D). A similar side-explosive separation was observed in the
mok1-664 mutant (Fig. 8
C and Fig. S4 E).After side-explosive separation, the sister cells remained attached by one side
of the septum edging through remnants of a primary septum that was slowly
degraded (Fig. 8 E). Importantly, the new
end of both sister cells displayed considerable amounts of primary septum
remnants, indicating that the immediate cell separation is caused by a fast
internal tear of a weak primary septum that cannot withstand the cell pressure
that curves the secondary septum (Fig. 8
E). This shows that the α(1-3)glucan forms part of the primary
septum and is essential to confer it the strength needed to support the cell
internal pressure during cell separation.We examined if the primary septum weakness also affected its linkage to the
secondary septum, resulting in cell separation through not only internal tearing
but also in the primary–secondary septum boundary. As expected, all the
ags1+-repressed (n
= 612) and mok1-664 cells (n =
358) separated asymmetrically. Depending on the localization of primary septum
remnants (Fig. S4, D and E, arrow), three types of paired cells were detected:
(1) both new ends exhibiting CW-stained material, indicating an internal primary
septum tearing; (2) only one new end presenting CW-stained material, suggesting
a tearing through the contact region between primary and secondary septum; and
(3) in later separation stages, the new ends did not display detectable
CW-stained material, but the cells were still firmly connected through a small
cell wall area with little or no CW staining (Fig. 9 A and Fig. S4 E, circle).Figure 9.Absence of Ags1 results in a defective final cell separation
step. (A) Ags1-depleted cells stay attached through the
septum edging for a long time, even after disappearance of the remaining
CW-stained primary septum. Cells were grown as in Fig. 8 A. Circle: side-contact region with

in Fig. 6 A were analyzed by TEM
(top) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM, bottom). Bars, 1
µm.The absence of Ags1 causes a final cell separation defectOnly primary septum CW staining ensures that two cells closely observed by
microscopy are physically attached. In Ags1-depleted cells, the CW staining of
the side-contact region eventually disappeared. However, many cells appeared in
close lateral contact (Figs. 8 A and
9A), suggesting that they remain
attached by their side. To find out how and when the side-contact region is
degraded to complete cell separation, time-lapse of paired Ags1-depleted cells
connected by their side region was performed (Fig. 9 B, arrowhead). After 240 min the cells still remained
connected (arrowhead), each already containing a new septum ready to be ripped.
In this example, the side-explosive separation of the new septum (Fig. 9 B, a1–a2) released the
connected cells from the well surface (path shown by broken arrow). In other
cases, the side-explosive separation did not necessarily cause detachment from
the surface (Video 1). During movement, the cells still stayed connected through
the initial side-contact region (Fig. 9
B, arrowhead, a1–b1, t = 237:40 to 255:00; and Video
10). Under our time-lapse conditions, the cells stayed connected
for more than one cell cycle, whereas in shaking cultures only paired cells were
detected. This result suggests that final cell separation of Ags1-depleted cells
is a mechanical rather than enzymatic process.Ultrastructure analysis of ags1+-repressed
cells confirmed the absence of degradation of the side-contact area maintaining
both cells connected after separation (Fig. 9
C, arrow). This nondegraded area was located close to the fission
scar, corresponding to the septum edging of the previous septum. The separated
cells presented in the pole lateral region cavities and attached wall fragments
(Fig. 9 C, open and closed
arrowheads), suggesting a physical tear of the cell wall that connected both
cells.

Ags1 localizes in the growing sites during vegetative and sexual
phasesWe examined the physiological localization of Ags1 by generating functional
Ags1-GFP and -RFP fusions (Fig. 1 A,
Fig. S1
A, and Materials and methods). During polar growth Ags1 was
localized to the growing ends. Before the primary septum was detected, Ags1
simultaneously appeared in the growing ends and as a medial ring. After the
primary septum was detected, Ags1 spread flanking the emerging septum and
accumulating in the CAR. An obvious signal remained along the invaginated
membrane, appearing as two separated bands after septum completion (Fig. 1, B and C; and Fig. S1 B).Figure 1.Ags1 localizes in the growing sites during vegetative and sexual

germination (Fig. 1, D and E; and Fig.
S1, D and E). These data suggest that Ags1 cooperates with the Ags1 homologues
and Bgs proteins in cell fusion, spore wall formation, and spore
germination.

Like the Bgs subunits, Ags1 was also present in all of the sites of wall

germination.

Ags1 coincides spatially and temporally with Bgs1 in the growing sites:
poles, CAR, and septumAs Ags1 and Bgs1 are the only GSs found in the medial region before the septum is
detected, their localization and displacement from the tips to the CAR during
mitosis was simultaneously analyzed. Time-lapse images showed that before the
primary septum was detected (Fig. 2 A,
arrow) Ags1 and Bgs1 colocalized as medial faint dots (Fig. 2 A, arrowhead). Furthermore, both Ags1 and Bgs1
concentrated in a ring that moved with the edge of the growing septum. However,
the Ags1 signal remaining along the invaginated membrane was more intense than
that of Bgs1 (Fig. 2 B and Fig. S1 C).
During cell separation, Ags1 and Bgs1 remained at both sides of the degrading
septum and moved simultaneously to the old end of each cell (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2.Ags1 coincides spatially and temporally with Bgs1 in the growing

Ags1 localization depends on the polarity establishment proteins, the
polarized actin patches, and the polarized exocytosisAgs1 localized to the poles during polar growth. tea1-1 and
tea2-1 mutants fail to reinstate polarized growth along the
long axis of the cell (Verde et al.,
1995). In these mutants, Ags1 localized to the incorrect new growing
tips (Fig. 3 A, left). On the contrary,
the microtubule cytoskeleton was dispensable for the correct localization and
displacement of Ags1 to poles and septum (Fig. 3

analyzed whether the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the correct Ags1
localization. In the actin mutant cps8-188 the actin patches
appeared depolarized (Ishiguro and Kobayashi,
1996), and Ags1 extended from the septum and poles along the plasma
membrane all around the cell (Fig. 3 B,
left). In contrast, polymerized F-actin was unnecessary for stable Ags1
localization in growing sites (Fig. 3 B,
middle).Formin For3 and type V myosin Myo52 are responsible for polarized actin cable
assembly and transport of cargoes along the actin cables, respectively (Feierbach and Chang, 2001; Win et al., 2001). In the absence of For3
or Myo52, Ags1 localized correctly to the growing poles and septum (Fig. 3 B, right). These findings are in
agreement with the fact that loss of function of profilin Cdc3, essential for
actin cable formation (Balasubramanian et al.,
1994), still permitted polarized growth and localization of Ags1 in
cell tips (Fig. 3 B, bottom).The exocyst is essential for polarized fusion of secretory vesicles with the
plasma membrane (Wang et al., 2002). In
the exocyst mutant sec8-1, Ags1 accumulated in the surrounding
areas of tips and septa but no signal was detected in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 C). Thus, Ags1 localization to
regions of active cell wall synthesis depends on the correct actin patch
localization and the polarized exocytosis.

The exocyst is essential for polarized fusion of secretory vesicles with the
plasma membrane (Wang et al., 2002). In
the exocyst mutant sec8-1, Ags1 accumulated in the surrounding
areas of tips and septa but no signal was detected in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 C). Thus, Ags1 localization to
regions of active cell wall synthesis depends on the correct actin patch
localization and the polarized exocytosis.

Ags1 localization in the division site depends on the CAR formation and
positioning, but not on the SIN pathwayTo study the Ags1 requirements during septation, Ags1 localization in mutants
affected in CAR positioning and formation was analyzed. In mid1
mutants (Chang et al., 1996), CAR and
primary septum are positioned at arbitrary sites, always coincident with Bgs1,
but not with Bgs4 (Cortés et al.,
2005). In the mid1-366 mutant, Ags1 was always
coincident with septum alterations and Bgs1 localization (Fig. 2 D).In the CAR formation mutants (Balasubramanian et
al., 1994; Fankhauser et al.,
1995) Ags1 was detected at cell poles and/or coincident with the
incorrect septum structures (Fig. 4 A and
unpublished data). The F-Bar protein Cdc15 is essential for CAR maturation. The
cdc15-140 mutant does not form aberrant septum structures
but generates an unstable CAR that rapidly disappears (Hachet and Simanis, 2008). To know whether this defective
CAR is sufficient for a transient Ags1 localization to the cell middle,
time-lapse of cdc15-140 cells at restrictive temperature and
expressing both Ags1-RFP and Rlc1-GFP (CAR labeling) was performed (Fig. 4 B). In these cells Ags1 was never
detected in the medial cortex, indicating that a stable CAR is essential for
Ags1 localization in the division site.Figure 4.Ags1 localization in the division site depends on the CAR

µm.The SIN is a signaling network required for CAR contraction and septum formation
in S. pombe (Barral and
Liakopoulos, 2009). Thus, we examined whether Ags1 medial
localization depends on the SIN. The SIN mutants suffer a cytokinesis blockage
after mitosis, building a CAR that disassembles prematurely rather than
undergoing constriction and septum synthesis (Sparks et al., 1999; Krapp et al.,
2001; Rosenberg et al.,
2006). In these mutants, Ags1 localized to the poles and as a broad band
in the cell middle (Fig. S2
A, arrow; and unpublished data), indicating that the SIN is not
necessary for Ags1 displacement to the middle during cytokinesis.To know if the Ags1 medial localization in SIN mutants occurs specifically during
mitosis and during or after CAR presence, time-lapses of SIN mutants expressing
both Ags1-GFP and Hht1-RFP (nucleus labeling) or Ags1-RFP and Rlc1-GFP were
performed. During mitosis and after CAR assembly (Fig. 4 D, arrowhead) Ags1 disappeared from the tips and
concentrated in the cell cortex surrounding the CAR and the mitotic nuclei.
However, Ags1 never became concentrated as a ring structure; instead, it spread
as a broad band as CAR collapsed (Fig. 4, C and
D, arrow; and Fig. S2 B). When the nuclei were closely paired and the
cell reinitiated bipolar growth, Ags1 moved to both cell tips. Similar Ags1
medial localization and dynamics were observed during the second round of
mitosis (Fig. 4 C, arrow).Occasionally some SIN mutant cells maintained the CAR longer, and in this case
Ags1 concentrated as a ring overlapping the CAR that was able to constrict,
giving rise to CW-stained septum structures (Fig. S2, C and D [Ags1, arrow; CW,
arrowhead). Interestingly, the emergence of these septum structures frequently
coincided with cell death before growth reinitiation, but never with septum
completion.In agreement with the SIN dependence of Cdc15 recruitment to the CAR, the
cdc15-140 mutant shows a similar cytokinesis phenotype to
that of SIN mutants (Hachet and Simanis,
2008). However, Ags1 did not localize in the cell middle of
cdc15-140 cells grown at a restrictive temperature (Fig. 4 B and unpublished data). Thus,
time-lapse of cdc15-140 cells growing at low restrictive
temperature was performed. The cdc15-140 cells displayed a more
stable and uniform CAR that still disassembled prematurely (Fig. 4 E, arrowhead). In this case and like in SIN
mutants, Ags1 appeared in the medial site and spread along the cell cortex as
CAR collapsed (Fig. 4 E, arrow). These
observations indicate that Ags1 displacement to the cell middle depends on a
stable CAR, whereas the SIN signaling is exclusively needed for Ags1
localization in a ring structure.

Ags1 localization in the division site depends on the CAR formation and
positioning, but not on the SIN pathway

To study the Ags1 requirements during septation, Ags1 localization in mutants
affected in CAR positioning and formation was analyzed. In mid1
mutants (Chang et al., 1996), CAR and
primary septum are positioned at arbitrary sites, always coincident with Bgs1,
but not with Bgs4 (Cortés et al.,
2005). In the mid1-366 mutant, Ags1 was always
coincident with septum alterations and Bgs1 localization (Fig. 2 D).

In the CAR formation mutants (Balasubramanian et
al., 1994; Fankhauser et al.,
1995) Ags1 was detected at cell poles and/or coincident with the
incorrect septum structures (Fig. 4 A and
unpublished data). The F-Bar protein Cdc15 is essential for CAR maturation. The
cdc15-140 mutant does not form aberrant septum structures
but generates an unstable CAR that rapidly disappears (Hachet and Simanis, 2008). To know whether this defective
CAR is sufficient for a transient Ags1 localization to the cell middle,
time-lapse of cdc15-140 cells at restrictive temperature and
expressing both Ags1-RFP and Rlc1-GFP (CAR labeling) was performed (Fig. 4 B). In these cells Ags1 was never
detected in the medial cortex, indicating that a stable CAR is essential for
Ags1 localization in the division site.

formation, but not on the SIN pathway. (A) cdc12-112

Ags1 is essential for the septum integrity at the start of cell
separationTo study the lethal effect of the absence of Ags1, a strain expressing a single
integrated ags1+ copy under the control of
the thiamine-repressible 81X-nmt1+ promoter
was analyzed (see Materials and methods). Cell growth arrested after 4 h of
ags1+ repression and osmotic
stabilization protected the cells, delaying the growth arrest to at least 12 h
(Fig. 5 A, left). Morphological
observations revealed that Ags1 depletion promotes cell lysis and cytoplasm
release from the lateral region of the poles (Fig. 5 B, arrowhead) and mostly from the septum (Fig. 5 B, arrow). Total lysis reached 70%
of the cells (n = 420) after 7 h of repression, and
sorbitol reduced it to 7% (n = 986; Fig. 5 A, right). A similar lysis phenotype was observed
in the mok1-664 mutant at a restrictive temperature (Fig. 5 C). In agreement with previous data
from ags1+ point mutants (Hochstenbach et al., 1998; Katayama et al., 1999), the Ags1-depleted
cells showed a considerable reduction (53%) in the cell wall α-glucan
content (Table 1).Figure 5.Absence of Ags1 promotes cell lysis and release of cytoplasmic

cells was examined in detail by time-lapse (Fig.
5 D and Video
1). The lysis always appeared after septum completion, coincident
with the start of cell separation. After 3 h of
ags1+ repression, lysis mostly occurred
at the septum–cell wall border in only one cell (13% cells,
n = 238; Fig. 5
D, top graph), generating one dead cell (arrowhead, top) attached to
the living cell. After 7 h, lysis mostly occurred in both cells (41% cells,
n = 420; Fig. 5
D, bottom graph) at both sides of the septum–cell wall border
(arrowhead, bottom). Sorbitol delayed the cell lysis to 7 h. At this time most
of the cells were still normal in growth and morphology (see graphs in Fig. 5, A and D).Because Ags1 and Bgs1 might collaborate in the initial steps of septum formation,
a possible genetic interaction was tested. Bgs1 and Ags1 interact genetically
because the cps1-12 mok1-664 mutant was more sensitive to
temperature than the single mutants (Fig. S3
A). However, we found that the absence or defective function of
Bgs1 (81X-bgs1+ or cps1-12
mutant) suppressed the lytic phenotype of either Ags1 absence or
mok1-664 mutation (Fig. S3 B). Interestingly, whereas
cps1-12 produced multi-septated cells, the cps1-12
mok1-664 mutant arrested with no septa, suggesting collaboration
between both proteins in septum and cell wall synthesis (Fig. S3 B). In
agreement, the combined absence of both Bgs1 and Ags1 promoted strong
cytokinesis defects not observed with Bgs1 absence alone (Fig. S3 B, arrow).A possible genetic interaction between ags1+
and SIN genes was also tested, finding that the mok1-664 SIN
double mutants are more sensitive to temperature than the single mutants (Fig.
S3 A). The SIN mutants do not form septa, and therefore, the lysis of
mok1-664 mutant at the start of cell separation was
abolished. Instead, a new and abundant lysis at the pole tip appeared (Fig. S3
C), indicating that Ags1 is also essential for cell wall integrity during
polarized growth. In some cases, the SIN mutants lysed at the septum. This was
due to the initiation of defective septa that cannot be completed. As expected,
the mok1-664 mutation increased the septum lysis defect of the
SIN mutants (Fig. S3 C).

The septum lysis process of ags1+-repressed
cells was examined in detail by time-lapse (Fig.

1). The lysis always appeared after septum completion, coincident
with the start of cell separation. After 3 h of

(arrowhead, bottom). Sorbitol delayed the cell lysis to 7 h. At this time most
of the cells were still normal in growth and morphology (see graphs in Fig. 5, A and D).

Because Ags1 and Bgs1 might collaborate in the initial steps of septum formation,
a possible genetic interaction was tested. Bgs1 and Ags1 interact genetically
because the cps1-12 mok1-664 mutant was more sensitive to
temperature than the single mutants (Fig. S3

Bgs1 (81X-bgs1+ or cps1-12

cps1-12 produced multi-septated cells, the cps1-12
mok1-664 mutant arrested with no septa, suggesting collaboration
between both proteins in septum and cell wall synthesis (Fig. S3 B). In
agreement, the combined absence of both Bgs1 and Ags1 promoted strong
cytokinesis defects not observed with Bgs1 absence alone (Fig. S3 B, arrow).

A possible genetic interaction between ags1+
and SIN genes was also tested, finding that the mok1-664 SIN
double mutants are more sensitive to temperature than the single mutants (Fig.
S3 A). The SIN mutants do not form septa, and therefore, the lysis of
mok1-664 mutant at the start of cell separation was
abolished. Instead, a new and abundant lysis at the pole tip appeared (Fig. S3

polarized growth. In some cases, the SIN mutants lysed at the septum. This was
due to the initiation of defective septa that cannot be completed. As expected,
the mok1-664 mutation increased the septum lysis defect of the
SIN mutants (Fig. S3 C).

The absence of Ags1 alters the cell wall ultrastructure and leads to cell
lysis at the lateral region of the polesTo further investigate the cell integrity defect caused by the absence of Ags1,
the cell wall ultrastructure was examined (Fig.
6, A and C). The wild-type (WT) cell wall presented a three-layered
structure (Fig. 6 A), whereas in the
absence of Ags1 the cell wall became amorphous, thicker, and looser, with no
signs of the outer dense layer. In the presence of sorbitol the wall appeared
stratified with remedial internal dense and transparent layers (Fig. 6 A, ICW). This is in agreement with
the different cell wall amounts detected with and without sorbitol. The cell
wall increase detected with sorbitol was only due to β-glucan, suggesting
a compensatory mechanism (Table 1).Figure 6.Absence of Ags1 alters the cell wall structure and composition and
causes a lack of cell wall in the pole lateral region, which leads
to lysis and cytoplasm release. (A) Ags1 depletion promotes

(Horisberger and Rouvet-Vauthey,
1985). Because the outer layer was absent in Ags1-depleted cell
walls, WT cells expressing Hht1-RFP (nuclear RFP) and
ags1+-repressed cells (no nuclear RFP)
were mixed, stained with FITC-concanavalin A, and visualized for FITC and RFP
(Fig. 6 B). Concanavalin A
specifically binds to mannose residues, which can be used for indirect
measurement of the mannan content and localization in the cell surface (Goldstein, 2002). Quantitative analysis
of the FITC signal showed that in Ags1-depleted cells the outer galactomannan
content was significantly reduced (Fig. 6
B), in agreement with the 36% decrease observed by cell wall
fractionation (Table 1).WT cells are surrounded by a uniform cell wall (Figs. 6 C and 7 A). In
contrast, the cell wall of Ags1-depleted cells was irregular and displayed

Lysis always occurred not at the cell tip, but at the pole side region (Fig. 6 D, arrowhead). Lysis was detected at
early repression times and increased during repression, reaching 8% of the cells
at 7 h (n = 420; Fig. 6
D, graph). In the presence of sorbitol, lysis was delayed and reduced
to 2% after 7 h of repression (n = 986; Fig. 6 D, graph). Interestingly, when the
cells grown with sorbitol were imaged in the absence of sorbitol, the pole
lateral lysis increased to 28% while the septum lysis remained in 6%
(n = 453, not depicted). These data indicate that
Ags1 and the corresponding α(1-3)glucan are essential to maintain cell
wall structure and integrity during cell growth.

The galactomannan has been detected in the outer and inner electron-dense layers
(Horisberger and Rouvet-Vauthey,

walls, WT cells expressing Hht1-RFP (nuclear RFP) and

of the FITC signal showed that in Ags1-depleted cells the outer galactomannan

WT cells are surrounded by a uniform cell wall (Figs. 6 C and 7 A). In
contrast, the cell wall of Ags1-depleted cells was irregular and displayed
erosions in the pole lateral region (Fig. 6

Lysis always occurred not at the cell tip, but at the pole side region (Fig. 6 D, arrowhead). Lysis was detected at

cells grown with sorbitol were imaged in the absence of sorbitol, the pole
lateral lysis increased to 28% while the septum lysis remained in 6%
(n = 453, not depicted). These data indicate that
Ags1 and the corresponding α(1-3)glucan are essential to maintain cell
wall structure and integrity during cell growth.

Ags1 is responsible for both secondary septum synthesis and correct primary
septum formationTo study in more detail the role of Ags1 in septum synthesis, the septum
ultrastructure of Ags1-depleted cells was analyzed. WT cells presented a
three-layered septum structure (Fig. 7
A). As the primary septum grew, the secondary septum was laid down at
both sides. After septum closure, the septum thickness increased in a maturation
process involving additional secondary septum synthesis. The final septum
displayed a primary septum invading the cell wall (arrow) and flanked by two
triangular electron-dense structures termed “materiel triangulaire
dense” (MTD; Johnson et al.,
1973; Fig. 7 A, bottom).The Ags1-depleted cells presented strong septum defects of abruptly twisted
(Fig. 7, B–D) and not anchored
primary septa (arrow) and disorganized MTD structures (Fig. 7, C and D). This indicates that Ags1 is essential
for a straight primary septum synthesis, and suggests an important Ags1
cooperation with Bgs1 and the CAR. In addition, Ags1 is also essential for
primary septum anchorage and MTD assembly. Sorbitol delayed the lytic phenotype,
revealing a primary septum synthesized with no secondary septum (Fig. 7 C). At longer repression times, a
new remedial internal cell wall (ICW) layer appeared (Figs. 6 A and 7 D).
The primary septum could not drill the cell wall, but instead the base appeared
anchored to the new ICW, which extended along the naked primary septum. This in
turn gave rise to a new three-layered septum structure with a twisted primary
septum flanked by remedial secondary septa (Fig.
7 D).

Ags1 is essential for the primary septum strength needed to support the cell
separation internal pressureThe analysis of ags1+-repressed cells showed
that all of the cells separated asymmetrically and stayed coupled by their side
(Fig. 8 A, arrowhead). Quantification
showed that 21% of WT cells (n = 1,260) were in the
separation process, which was straight and symmetrical (arrow). However, 41% of
Ags1-depleted cells (n = 1,487) were in the separation
process, which always was asymmetrical, or remained connected by their side
after separation (Fig. 8 A, graph).Figure 8.Ags1 is responsible for the strength of the primary septum

µm.To further assess the nature of this defect, cell separation was monitored by
time-lapse. WT cell separation was progressive and symmetrical (Video
2). The first step was a small symmetrical jump (t = 40;
Fig. 8 B, Fig. S4
A, and Video
5) caused by the physical force of the turgor pressure after
degradation of the septum edging. Next, progressive and symmetrical degradation
of the primary septum was accompanied by a gradual curvature of the secondary
septum to reach the most stable conformation in the new end.Interestingly, cell separation in Ags1-depleted cells was instantaneous and
asymmetrical, with a ripped primary septum, usually giving rise to one sister
cell remaining attached to the well surface, and the other cell quickly jumping
but staying connected by its side to the sister cell (Videos
3 and 4). This side-explosive phenotype was caused by asymmetrical
degradation and/or breakage of the septum edging followed by an abrupt tear of a
weak primary septum and an instantaneous curvature of the secondary septum (t
= 20; Fig. 8 B, Fig. S4 B, and
Videos
6–9). The secondary septum of WT cells needed 5 min from
the separation start for a complete curvature, whereas in the absence of Ags1
this occurred in as much as 20 s (first captured image, asterisk, Fig. 8 B and Fig. S4 B). Cells imaged by
normal microscopy showed that the abrupt primary septum tearing occurs in just
the time spent between two image captures (1 s; Fig. 8 D). A similar side-explosive separation was observed in the
mok1-664 mutant (Fig. 8
C and Fig. S4 E).After side-explosive separation, the sister cells remained attached by one side
of the septum edging through remnants of a primary septum that was slowly
degraded (Fig. 8 E). Importantly, the new
end of both sister cells displayed considerable amounts of primary septum
remnants, indicating that the immediate cell separation is caused by a fast
internal tear of a weak primary septum that cannot withstand the cell pressure
that curves the secondary septum (Fig. 8
E). This shows that the α(1-3)glucan forms part of the primary
septum and is essential to confer it the strength needed to support the cell
internal pressure during cell separation.We examined if the primary septum weakness also affected its linkage to the
secondary septum, resulting in cell separation through not only internal tearing
but also in the primary–secondary septum boundary. As expected, all the
ags1+-repressed (n
= 612) and mok1-664 cells (n =
358) separated asymmetrically. Depending on the localization of primary septum
remnants (Fig. S4, D and E, arrow), three types of paired cells were detected:
(1) both new ends exhibiting CW-stained material, indicating an internal primary
septum tearing; (2) only one new end presenting CW-stained material, suggesting
a tearing through the contact region between primary and secondary septum; and
(3) in later separation stages, the new ends did not display detectable
CW-stained material, but the cells were still firmly connected through a small
cell wall area with little or no CW staining (Fig. 9 A and Fig. S4 E, circle).Figure 9.Absence of Ags1 results in a defective final cell separation

To further assess the nature of this defect, cell separation was monitored by
time-lapse. WT cell separation was progressive and symmetrical (Video

Fig. 8 B, Fig. S4
A, and Video
5) caused by the physical force of the turgor pressure after
degradation of the septum edging. Next, progressive and symmetrical degradation
of the primary septum was accompanied by a gradual curvature of the secondary
septum to reach the most stable conformation in the new end.

Interestingly, cell separation in Ags1-depleted cells was instantaneous and
asymmetrical, with a ripped primary septum, usually giving rise to one sister
cell remaining attached to the well surface, and the other cell quickly jumping
but staying connected by its side to the sister cell (Videos

degradation and/or breakage of the septum edging followed by an abrupt tear of a
weak primary septum and an instantaneous curvature of the secondary septum (t
= 20; Fig. 8 B, Fig. S4 B, and
Videos
6–9). The secondary septum of WT cells needed 5 min from
the separation start for a complete curvature, whereas in the absence of Ags1
this occurred in as much as 20 s (first captured image, asterisk, Fig. 8 B and Fig. S4 B). Cells imaged by
normal microscopy showed that the abrupt primary septum tearing occurs in just
the time spent between two image captures (1 s; Fig. 8 D). A similar side-explosive separation was observed in the
mok1-664 mutant (Fig. 8
C and Fig. S4 E).

After side-explosive separation, the sister cells remained attached by one side
of the septum edging through remnants of a primary septum that was slowly
degraded (Fig. 8 E). Importantly, the new
end of both sister cells displayed considerable amounts of primary septum
remnants, indicating that the immediate cell separation is caused by a fast
internal tear of a weak primary septum that cannot withstand the cell pressure
that curves the secondary septum (Fig. 8
E). This shows that the α(1-3)glucan forms part of the primary
septum and is essential to confer it the strength needed to support the cell
internal pressure during cell separation.

We examined if the primary septum weakness also affected its linkage to the
secondary septum, resulting in cell separation through not only internal tearing
but also in the primary–secondary septum boundary. As expected, all the
ags1+-repressed (n
= 612) and mok1-664 cells (n =

(3) in later separation stages, the new ends did not display detectable
CW-stained material, but the cells were still firmly connected through a small
cell wall area with little or no CW staining (Fig. 9 A and Fig. S4 E, circle).

step. (A) Ags1-depleted cells stay attached through the

The absence of Ags1 causes a final cell separation defectOnly primary septum CW staining ensures that two cells closely observed by
microscopy are physically attached. In Ags1-depleted cells, the CW staining of
the side-contact region eventually disappeared. However, many cells appeared in
close lateral contact (Figs. 8 A and
9A), suggesting that they remain
attached by their side. To find out how and when the side-contact region is
degraded to complete cell separation, time-lapse of paired Ags1-depleted cells
connected by their side region was performed (Fig. 9 B, arrowhead). After 240 min the cells still remained
connected (arrowhead), each already containing a new septum ready to be ripped.
In this example, the side-explosive separation of the new septum (Fig. 9 B, a1–a2) released the
connected cells from the well surface (path shown by broken arrow). In other
cases, the side-explosive separation did not necessarily cause detachment from
the surface (Video 1). During movement, the cells still stayed connected through
the initial side-contact region (Fig. 9
B, arrowhead, a1–b1, t = 237:40 to 255:00; and Video
10). Under our time-lapse conditions, the cells stayed connected
for more than one cell cycle, whereas in shaking cultures only paired cells were
detected. This result suggests that final cell separation of Ags1-depleted cells
is a mechanical rather than enzymatic process.Ultrastructure analysis of ags1+-repressed
cells confirmed the absence of degradation of the side-contact area maintaining
both cells connected after separation (Fig. 9
C, arrow). This nondegraded area was located close to the fission
scar, corresponding to the septum edging of the previous septum. The separated
cells presented in the pole lateral region cavities and attached wall fragments
(Fig. 9 C, open and closed
arrowheads), suggesting a physical tear of the cell wall that connected both
cells.

Only primary septum CW staining ensures that two cells closely observed by

the side-contact region eventually disappeared. However, many cells appeared in

both cells connected after separation (Fig. 9

scar, corresponding to the septum edging of the previous septum. The separated

(Fig. 9 C, open and closed

DiscussionIn fungal cytokinesis, CAR contraction is intimately accompanied by centripetal
assembly of a septum wall that physically separates the sister cells (Bathe and Chang, 2010). However, little is yet
known about how the different essential GSs cooperate to assemble the septum
structures. Once septation is accomplished, subsequent cell separation requires the
selective degradation of the primary septum (Sipiczki, 2007). Because of the high turgor pressure, even a minor
rupture of the cell wall structure might conduct to lysis and cell death. Therefore,
correct assembly and structural integrity of the cell wall and specialized septum
are vital for cell survival (Cabib et al.,
2001).S. pombe is an attractive model for morphogenesis whose growth
pattern likely diverged from filamentous fungi in response to the loss of hyphal
growth (Harris, 2011). Like fission yeast,
the cell wall of filamentous fungi also contains β- and α-glucans
(Latgé, 2007). S.
pombe IEM studies allowed the localization of the β-glucans in
specific sites of cell wall and septum (Humbel et
al., 2001; Cortés et al.,
2007). To date, the cell wall α(1-3)glucan distribution and
function is unknown (Sugawara et al., 2003;
Grün et al., 2005). Ags1 was
described as a putative αGS essential for cell integrity, but a specific role
for Ags1 in the cell wall and septum architecture has not yet been described (Hochstenbach et al., 1998; Katayama et al., 1999).We succeeded in generating a fully functional Ags1-GFP, and interestingly, Ags1
localizes very early in division sites and poles, coinciding exactly with Bgs1. Both
Ags1 and Bgs1 localize before and ahead of the growing primary septum. Ags1 and
Bgs1, but not Bgs4, overlap with the aberrant CW-stained septum material of the CAR
positioning mutant mid1-366. Importantly, Bgs1 coimmunoprecipitates
with Ags1, and ags1+ and
bgs1+ interact genetically, suggesting a
tight cooperation between both GSs in primary septum assembly. In fact, Bgs1
depletion produces septa with no primary septum but still containing diffuse L-BG,
suggesting that L-BG association with branched β(1-3) and/or
α(1-3)glucan is critical for primary septum assembly (Cortés et al., 2007).Independently of the close Ags1–Bgs1 cooperation and although both are GSs,
Ags1 is structurally very distinct and presents a relevant difference with the Bgs
family with respect to their dependence on the SIN for medial localization (Cortés et al., 2005), indicating
different requirements for medial localization and/or activation. In the absence of
a functional SIN, only Ags1 is able to localize in the division site during mitosis
and in the presence of the CAR. In cdc15-140 cells, Ags1 does not
localize to the division site in the absence of the CAR and spreads along the medial
cortex in the presence of a nonfunctional CAR, indicating that CAR serves as a
landmark for Ags1 incorporation to the division site, whereas the SIN is exclusively
involved in its ring localization and activation.Ags1 α-glucan is essential for the primary septum strength needed
during cell separationS. pombe cell separation is the most critical step of the cell
cycle, where the degrading primary septum must withstand the internal pressure
and gradual secondary septum curvature to reach the most stable conformation in
the new end. The normal septum structure is able to support the mechanical force
of the internal pressure, allowing a symmetrical and progressive primary septum
degradation and secondary septum curvature (Fig. 10 A). Our results show that Ags1 absence or loss of function
generates a primary septum that is highly vulnerable to the separation internal
pressure. After asymmetrical septum edging degradation, the primary septum is
instantly torn by a side-explosive cell separation (Fig. 10 B), creating two sister cells with primary septum
remnants in the new ends. These observations indicate that Ags1 synthesizes an
α-glucan of the primary septum that is essential to confer it the
mechanical strength needed to face the separation internal pressure.Figure 10.Models of the septation apparatus and the apical growth of fission
yeast. (A) Septation and cell separation in WT cells. A
balance between the osmotic pressure that curves the secondary septum to
the stable spherical conformation and the degradation of the primary
septum ensures a symmetrical and steady separation. (B) Alternative
septation and side-explosive cell separation in the absence of Ags1 and
the corresponding α-glucan. Asymmetrical septum edging
degradation and mechanical tear of a weak primary septum that cannot
hold the turgor pressure, leading to an instantaneous side-explosive
separation to adopt the stable spherical conformation in both new ends.
The cells stay attached by the septum edging for the next cell cycle.
(C) Apical growth in WT and Bgs4- and Ags1-depleted cells. (1) The WT
cell wall thickness is uniform, ensuring a balance between the turgor
pressure and the strength of the growing cell wall. (2) Bgs4 absence
produces a thin wall at the pole tip that cannot withstand the turgor
pressure, leading to the wall rupture and cytoplasm release (unpublished
data). (3) Ags1 absence causes wall cavities in the pole side region due
to a defective final cell separation, leading to the cell lysis and
cytoplasm release. CW, cell wall; Cyt, cytoplasm; F, fuscannel; Fs,

in addition to β-glucans, the primary septum of S. pombe
also contains α-glucan. The primary septum is essential for S.
pombe viability, whereas in S. cerevisiae it is
dispensable. These differences might account for distinct division patterns
and/or cell wall compositions: (i) S. pombe does not contain
chitin, whereas the budding yeast primary septum is made of chitin. It seems
reasonable to think that linkages between α- and β-glucans would
contribute to the mechanical strength of the primary septum. (ii) S.
pombe primary and secondary septum assembly is simultaneous and
closely coordinated, whereas the S. cerevisiae septum is
synthesized sequentially. (iii) S. pombe septum covers the
entire cell diameter, whereas in budding yeast it just closes the narrow
mother-bud neck. (iv) S. pombe septum degradation gives rise to
full-diameter new growth ends, whereas in S. cerevisiae it
results in a small nongrowing area. (v) S. pombe full-diameter
septum degradation supports a considerable internal pressure, whereas in
S. cerevisiae it must only support the pressure of the
small disk area (Johnson et al., 1973;
Schmidt et al., 2002; Cortés et al., 2007).As we advance in our knowledge of fission yeast septation, we find new and
surprising evolutionary convergent structural and functional similarities
between fission yeast and plant septa: (i) as in S. pombe, the
plant cell plate is made of callose (L-BG) and the protein involved is the Bgs
homologue CalS1 (Verma and Hong, 2001;
Cortés et al., 2007); (ii)
S. pombe α-glucan and plant pectin (an
α-linked polysaccharide) assume the same function in a similar structure.
Both are essential for wall adhesion and safe cell separation, maintaining the
linkages between polysaccharides in equivalent structures, the fission yeast
primary septum and the plant mature cell plate (middle lamella; Iwai et al., 2002; Roberts and Gonzalez-Carranza, 2007).Ags1 is responsible for secondary septum formation and cell wall
integrityAgs1 depletion generates fragile and twisted primary septa with no secondary
septa, indicating that (i) Ags1 is responsible for the secondary septum
assembly; and (ii) the perpendicular and straight primary septum deposition
needs to be closely accompanied by a flanking secondary septum. Alternatively,
the twisted primary septum might be due to an essential Ags1 cooperation with
Bgs1 and the CAR. Analysis of reverting protoplasts suggested that the primary
cell wall formation step is the assembly of β-glucan microfibrils,
whereas α-glucan might be involved in glucan bundle formation (Osumi et al., 1989; Konomi et al., 2003). Our results indicate that in the
absence of α-glucan, the β-glucan microfibrils are unable to
evolve into bundles, and therefore, the glucan network is not generated and the
secondary septum is not assembled.S. cerevisiae association between chitin and β(1-3)glucan
grants to the wall the mechanical strength needed to withstand the internal
pressure (Hartland et al., 1994). As
S. pombe does not contain chitin, α- and
β-glucans and their corresponding GSs have probably assumed multiple
essential functions during cell wall synthesis, as is the case for the three
chitin synthases in S. cerevisiae (Shaw et al., 1991). Our results show that Ags1 is also
essential for cell wall integrity: (i) Ags1 localizes to the growing poles,
suggesting that Ags1 synthesizes an α-glucan of the cell wall. (ii) Ags1
is essential for the correct cell wall architecture. In its absence the cell
wall is amorphous, thicker, and looser, with no signs of the outer dense layer,
reduced concanavalin A binding to the wall surface, and reduced cell wall
galactomannan content. It is unknown how galactomannan is integrated into the
cell wall, although our results suggest that part of the mannose residues might
associate with the α-glucan fibrils. (iii) Ags1 depletion generates a
predominant septum lysis at the start of cell separation, suggesting that Ags1
is essential to compensate an excess of cell wall degradation during separation.
In addition to α-glucan, the secondary septum contains branched
β(1-3)glucan. bgs4+-repressed cells
also display septum lysis at the beginning of cell separation (Cortés et al., 2005). Thus, it will
be necessary to evaluate whether Bgs4 is responsible for the secondary septum
β(1-3)glucan and how Ags1 and Bgs4 cooperate to assemble this
structure.Ags1 and Bgs4 are also essential for cell integrity during apical growth,
although by different mechanisms (Fig. 10
C). Bgs4 absence generates a thin-tip cell wall leading to lysis at
the pole tip (unpublished data). However, Ags1 absence produces lysis at the
pole lateral region. Interestingly, the pole lateral region presents cavities
from a defective cell separation, suggesting that lysis may be indirectly caused
by the separation defect (Fig. 10
C).Sorbitol protects the cells, allowing the activation of a compensatory mechanism
that generates a remedial cell wall that extends as a secondary septum at both
sides of the twisted primary septum, in a sequential process similar to that of
S. cerevisiae (Cabib et
al., 2001). In some cases, only one sister cell displays primary
septum remnants in the new end after side-explosive separation, suggesting a
defective primary–secondary septum association and a linking role for
α-glucan. Additionally, primary and secondary septum synthesis might need
to be coupled in order to generate the required linkages for a compact septum.
Similar compensatory mechanisms have been described in Bgs1- and Bgs4-depleted
cells and other α(1-3)glucan-containing fungi (Cortés et al., 2005, 2007; Maubon et al.,
2006; Reese et al., 2007;
Farkas et al., 2009). S.
pombe contains four additional Ags proteins, which are detected
during sporulation (García et al.,
2006). Evaluation of the activities induced by this compensatory
mechanism will require further genetic and molecular analysis of Ags and Bgs
subunits.

In fungal cytokinesis, CAR contraction is intimately accompanied by centripetal
assembly of a septum wall that physically separates the sister cells (Bathe and Chang, 2010). However, little is yet
known about how the different essential GSs cooperate to assemble the septum
structures. Once septation is accomplished, subsequent cell separation requires the
selective degradation of the primary septum (Sipiczki, 2007). Because of the high turgor pressure, even a minor
rupture of the cell wall structure might conduct to lysis and cell death. Therefore,
correct assembly and structural integrity of the cell wall and specialized septum
are vital for cell survival (Cabib et al.,
2001).

S. pombe is an attractive model for morphogenesis whose growth

pombe IEM studies allowed the localization of the β-glucans in
specific sites of cell wall and septum (Humbel et
al., 2001; Cortés et al.,
2007). To date, the cell wall α(1-3)glucan distribution and
function is unknown (Sugawara et al., 2003;
Grün et al., 2005). Ags1 was
described as a putative αGS essential for cell integrity, but a specific role
for Ags1 in the cell wall and septum architecture has not yet been described (Hochstenbach et al., 1998; Katayama et al., 1999).

We succeeded in generating a fully functional Ags1-GFP, and interestingly, Ags1
localizes very early in division sites and poles, coinciding exactly with Bgs1. Both
Ags1 and Bgs1 localize before and ahead of the growing primary septum. Ags1 and
Bgs1, but not Bgs4, overlap with the aberrant CW-stained septum material of the CAR
positioning mutant mid1-366. Importantly, Bgs1 coimmunoprecipitates
with Ags1, and ags1+ and
bgs1+ interact genetically, suggesting a
tight cooperation between both GSs in primary septum assembly. In fact, Bgs1
depletion produces septa with no primary septum but still containing diffuse L-BG,
suggesting that L-BG association with branched β(1-3) and/or
α(1-3)glucan is critical for primary septum assembly (Cortés et al., 2007).

Independently of the close Ags1–Bgs1 cooperation and although both are GSs,
Ags1 is structurally very distinct and presents a relevant difference with the Bgs
family with respect to their dependence on the SIN for medial localization (Cortés et al., 2005), indicating
different requirements for medial localization and/or activation. In the absence of
a functional SIN, only Ags1 is able to localize in the division site during mitosis
and in the presence of the CAR. In cdc15-140 cells, Ags1 does not
localize to the division site in the absence of the CAR and spreads along the medial
cortex in the presence of a nonfunctional CAR, indicating that CAR serves as a
landmark for Ags1 incorporation to the division site, whereas the SIN is exclusively
involved in its ring localization and activation.

Ags1 α-glucan is essential for the primary septum strength needed
during cell separationS. pombe cell separation is the most critical step of the cell
cycle, where the degrading primary septum must withstand the internal pressure
and gradual secondary septum curvature to reach the most stable conformation in
the new end. The normal septum structure is able to support the mechanical force
of the internal pressure, allowing a symmetrical and progressive primary septum
degradation and secondary septum curvature (Fig. 10 A). Our results show that Ags1 absence or loss of function
generates a primary septum that is highly vulnerable to the separation internal
pressure. After asymmetrical septum edging degradation, the primary septum is
instantly torn by a side-explosive cell separation (Fig. 10 B), creating two sister cells with primary septum
remnants in the new ends. These observations indicate that Ags1 synthesizes an
α-glucan of the primary septum that is essential to confer it the
mechanical strength needed to face the separation internal pressure.Figure 10.Models of the septation apparatus and the apical growth of fission
yeast. (A) Septation and cell separation in WT cells. A

in addition to β-glucans, the primary septum of S. pombe
also contains α-glucan. The primary septum is essential for S.
pombe viability, whereas in S. cerevisiae it is
dispensable. These differences might account for distinct division patterns
and/or cell wall compositions: (i) S. pombe does not contain
chitin, whereas the budding yeast primary septum is made of chitin. It seems
reasonable to think that linkages between α- and β-glucans would
contribute to the mechanical strength of the primary septum. (ii) S.
pombe primary and secondary septum assembly is simultaneous and
closely coordinated, whereas the S. cerevisiae septum is
synthesized sequentially. (iii) S. pombe septum covers the
entire cell diameter, whereas in budding yeast it just closes the narrow
mother-bud neck. (iv) S. pombe septum degradation gives rise to
full-diameter new growth ends, whereas in S. cerevisiae it
results in a small nongrowing area. (v) S. pombe full-diameter
septum degradation supports a considerable internal pressure, whereas in
S. cerevisiae it must only support the pressure of the
small disk area (Johnson et al., 1973;
Schmidt et al., 2002; Cortés et al., 2007).As we advance in our knowledge of fission yeast septation, we find new and
surprising evolutionary convergent structural and functional similarities
between fission yeast and plant septa: (i) as in S. pombe, the
plant cell plate is made of callose (L-BG) and the protein involved is the Bgs
homologue CalS1 (Verma and Hong, 2001;
Cortés et al., 2007); (ii)
S. pombe α-glucan and plant pectin (an
α-linked polysaccharide) assume the same function in a similar structure.
Both are essential for wall adhesion and safe cell separation, maintaining the
linkages between polysaccharides in equivalent structures, the fission yeast
primary septum and the plant mature cell plate (middle lamella; Iwai et al., 2002; Roberts and Gonzalez-Carranza, 2007).

Ags1 α-glucan is essential for the primary septum strength needed
during cell separation

S. pombe cell separation is the most critical step of the cell

in addition to β-glucans, the primary septum of S. pombe
also contains α-glucan. The primary septum is essential for S.

As we advance in our knowledge of fission yeast septation, we find new and
surprising evolutionary convergent structural and functional similarities
between fission yeast and plant septa: (i) as in S. pombe, the
plant cell plate is made of callose (L-BG) and the protein involved is the Bgs

Ags1 is responsible for secondary septum formation and cell wall
integrityAgs1 depletion generates fragile and twisted primary septa with no secondary
septa, indicating that (i) Ags1 is responsible for the secondary septum
assembly; and (ii) the perpendicular and straight primary septum deposition
needs to be closely accompanied by a flanking secondary septum. Alternatively,
the twisted primary septum might be due to an essential Ags1 cooperation with
Bgs1 and the CAR. Analysis of reverting protoplasts suggested that the primary
cell wall formation step is the assembly of β-glucan microfibrils,
whereas α-glucan might be involved in glucan bundle formation (Osumi et al., 1989; Konomi et al., 2003). Our results indicate that in the
absence of α-glucan, the β-glucan microfibrils are unable to
evolve into bundles, and therefore, the glucan network is not generated and the
secondary septum is not assembled.S. cerevisiae association between chitin and β(1-3)glucan
grants to the wall the mechanical strength needed to withstand the internal
pressure (Hartland et al., 1994). As
S. pombe does not contain chitin, α- and
β-glucans and their corresponding GSs have probably assumed multiple
essential functions during cell wall synthesis, as is the case for the three
chitin synthases in S. cerevisiae (Shaw et al., 1991). Our results show that Ags1 is also
essential for cell wall integrity: (i) Ags1 localizes to the growing poles,
suggesting that Ags1 synthesizes an α-glucan of the cell wall. (ii) Ags1
is essential for the correct cell wall architecture. In its absence the cell
wall is amorphous, thicker, and looser, with no signs of the outer dense layer,
reduced concanavalin A binding to the wall surface, and reduced cell wall
galactomannan content. It is unknown how galactomannan is integrated into the
cell wall, although our results suggest that part of the mannose residues might
associate with the α-glucan fibrils. (iii) Ags1 depletion generates a
predominant septum lysis at the start of cell separation, suggesting that Ags1
is essential to compensate an excess of cell wall degradation during separation.
In addition to α-glucan, the secondary septum contains branched
β(1-3)glucan. bgs4+-repressed cells
also display septum lysis at the beginning of cell separation (Cortés et al., 2005). Thus, it will
be necessary to evaluate whether Bgs4 is responsible for the secondary septum
β(1-3)glucan and how Ags1 and Bgs4 cooperate to assemble this
structure.Ags1 and Bgs4 are also essential for cell integrity during apical growth,
although by different mechanisms (Fig. 10
C). Bgs4 absence generates a thin-tip cell wall leading to lysis at
the pole tip (unpublished data). However, Ags1 absence produces lysis at the
pole lateral region. Interestingly, the pole lateral region presents cavities
from a defective cell separation, suggesting that lysis may be indirectly caused
by the separation defect (Fig. 10
C).Sorbitol protects the cells, allowing the activation of a compensatory mechanism
that generates a remedial cell wall that extends as a secondary septum at both
sides of the twisted primary septum, in a sequential process similar to that of
S. cerevisiae (Cabib et
al., 2001). In some cases, only one sister cell displays primary
septum remnants in the new end after side-explosive separation, suggesting a
defective primary–secondary septum association and a linking role for
α-glucan. Additionally, primary and secondary septum synthesis might need
to be coupled in order to generate the required linkages for a compact septum.
Similar compensatory mechanisms have been described in Bgs1- and Bgs4-depleted
cells and other α(1-3)glucan-containing fungi (Cortés et al., 2005, 2007; Maubon et al.,
2006; Reese et al., 2007;
Farkas et al., 2009). S.
pombe contains four additional Ags proteins, which are detected
during sporulation (García et al.,
2006). Evaluation of the activities induced by this compensatory
mechanism will require further genetic and molecular analysis of Ags and Bgs
subunits.

Ags1 is responsible for secondary septum formation and cell wall
integrity

Ags1 depletion generates fragile and twisted primary septa with no secondary
septa, indicating that (i) Ags1 is responsible for the secondary septum
assembly; and (ii) the perpendicular and straight primary septum deposition
needs to be closely accompanied by a flanking secondary septum. Alternatively,
the twisted primary septum might be due to an essential Ags1 cooperation with
Bgs1 and the CAR. Analysis of reverting protoplasts suggested that the primary
cell wall formation step is the assembly of β-glucan microfibrils,
whereas α-glucan might be involved in glucan bundle formation (Osumi et al., 1989; Konomi et al., 2003). Our results indicate that in the
absence of α-glucan, the β-glucan microfibrils are unable to
evolve into bundles, and therefore, the glucan network is not generated and the
secondary septum is not assembled.

S. cerevisiae association between chitin and β(1-3)glucan
grants to the wall the mechanical strength needed to withstand the internal

S. pombe does not contain chitin, α- and
β-glucans and their corresponding GSs have probably assumed multiple

In addition to α-glucan, the secondary septum contains branched

also display septum lysis at the beginning of cell separation (Cortés et al., 2005). Thus, it will
be necessary to evaluate whether Bgs4 is responsible for the secondary septum
β(1-3)glucan and how Ags1 and Bgs4 cooperate to assemble this
structure.

Ags1 and Bgs4 are also essential for cell integrity during apical growth,
although by different mechanisms (Fig. 10
C). Bgs4 absence generates a thin-tip cell wall leading to lysis at
the pole tip (unpublished data). However, Ags1 absence produces lysis at the
pole lateral region. Interestingly, the pole lateral region presents cavities
from a defective cell separation, suggesting that lysis may be indirectly caused

Sorbitol protects the cells, allowing the activation of a compensatory mechanism
that generates a remedial cell wall that extends as a secondary septum at both
sides of the twisted primary septum, in a sequential process similar to that of
S. cerevisiae (Cabib et
al., 2001). In some cases, only one sister cell displays primary
septum remnants in the new end after side-explosive separation, suggesting a
defective primary–secondary septum association and a linking role for
α-glucan. Additionally, primary and secondary septum synthesis might need
to be coupled in order to generate the required linkages for a compact septum.
Similar compensatory mechanisms have been described in Bgs1- and Bgs4-depleted
cells and other α(1-3)glucan-containing fungi (Cortés et al., 2005, 2007; Maubon et al.,
2006; Reese et al., 2007;
Farkas et al., 2009). S.
pombe contains four additional Ags proteins, which are detected
during sporulation (García et al.,
2006). Evaluation of the activities induced by this compensatory
mechanism will require further genetic and molecular analysis of Ags and Bgs
subunits.

Materials and methodsStrains and culture conditionsThe S. pombe strains used in this study are enumerated in
Table
S1. ags1Δ deletion was performed in a
diploid strain by removing the entire coding sequence of an
ags1+ copy, as described for
bgs1+,
bgs3+, and
bgs4+ gene deletions (Cortés et al., 2002, 2005, 2007). Tetrad analysis of sporulated
ags1+/ags1Δ
diploids showed Ags1 to be essential, as described by previous work (Katayama et al., 1999). Haploid
ags1Δ strains were maintained viable by transforming
the heterozygous
ags1+/ags1Δ diploid
with ags1+-expressing plasmids and selecting
haploid spore clones containing the ags1Δ deletion,
which contained the corresponding ags1+
plasmid needed to maintain the cell viable.ags1Δ::ura4+
p41XH-ags1+ strain 1804
(his3+ selection) contains
ags1+ expressed under the control of the
41X version (medium expression) of the thiamine-repressible
nmt1+ promoter (Moreno et al., 2000). Other strains with different levels
of ags1+ repression were made by genetic
cross with strain 285 (Leu−, Ura−,
His−) transformed with the corresponding version of
p81XL-ags1+ and
p41XL-ags1+ (S. cerevisiae
LEU2 selection) and selection of Leu+,
Ura+, His− clones.81X-ags1+ strain 2086 contains the selection
marker ura4+ adjacent to the
nmt1+-81X promoter, followed by the
ags1+ ORF. This strain was made from a
diploid strain by homologous recombination of an ApaI–ApaI fragment of
pSK-Pags1+-ura4+-81X-ags11-2603
(see below) and sporulation. The resulting
81X-ags1+ haploid strain contained one
single integrated ags1+ copy under the
control of the 81X promoter and exhibited a strong lytic phenotype in the
presence of thiamine (repressed conditions) and a wild-type phenotype in its
absence (induced conditions).81X-ags1+
81X-bgs1+ strain 4825 was made by a
genetic cross between strains 2086
(81X-ags1+, Ura+) and 2234
(81X-bgs1+, Ura−,
5-fluoroorotic acid [FOA] selection) and random spore selection of
Ura+ clones
(81X-ags1+), followed by the analysis of the
possible differential phenotype in the presence of thiamine between single
81X-ags1+ and double
81X-ags1+
81X-bgs1+ strains. PCR analysis of
positive clones confirmed the presence of the 81X promoter and the absence of
the original promoter in both genes.The 11.3 kb ags1+-containing fragment seemed
to be toxic for cloning. Therefore, the ags1Δ strain
containing an integrated
ags1+-GFP copy was made
sequentially with two overlapping fragments that restore the entire
ags1+ sequence (Fig. S1 A). First, strain
1804 (ags1Δ::ura4+
p41XH-ags1+,
his3+ selection) was made
Ura− by transformation with a
ura4+-empty ags1Δ
deletion cassette and colony selection in minimal medium containing FOA to make
strain 2881 (ags1Δ
p41XH-ags1+). Then, the
ags1Δ p41XH-ags1+
strain was transformed with SpeI-cut
pSK-ura4+-ags13704-7233
(ura4+ selection, 3.5 kb
ags1+ 3′ORF, and 1.3 kb
3′UTR), which directed its integration at the SpeI site at position
+431 of ags1+ 3′UTR. Correct
integration was confirmed by PCR analysis using pairs of oligonucleotides
external and internal to the integrated fragment. The resulting strain 2939
(ags1Δ
3′UTRags1+::ags13704-7233:ura4+
p41XH-ags1+) was transformed with
AgeI-cut pJK-ags11-6267-GFP
(leu1+ selection, 2.9 kb promoter, 6.2 kb
ags1+ 5′ORF, and 0.7 kb
12A-GFP-12A inserted in frame at base 5866 of
ags1+ ORF, see below), which directed its
integration at the AgeI site at base 6025 in the
ags1+ 3′ORF, and restored the
complete ags1+ coding sequence (Fig. S1 A).
To eliminate p41XH-ags1+, to confirm
ags1+ reconstruction, and to analyze
Ags1-GFP functionality, this strain was crossed with strain 285
(Leu−, Ura−, His−) and
tetrad analysis was performed. Leu and Ura phenotypes always co-segregated
2+:2− as expected after ags1+
restoration. p41XH-ags1+ was lost in most of
the clones as a result of the sporulation process. The obtained
ags1Δ
ags1+-GFP strain
displayed a wild-type phenotype under all tested conditions and expressed
Ags1-GFP at physiological levels from a single integrated
ags1+-GFP gene under the
control of its own promoter. Similarly, an ags1Δ
ags1+-RFP strain
expressing a fully functional Ags1-RFP (Cherry variant; Shaner et al., 2005) from
pJK-ags11-6267-Cherry was also made.Standard complete yeast growth (YES), selective (EMM), and sporulation (SPA)
media (Egel, 1984; Alfa et al., 1993) have already been
described. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the A600 of early
log-phase cell cultures in a Coleman Junior II spectrophotometer
(OD600 0.15 = 107 cells/ml). For serial
dilution drop tests of growth, early log-phase cells growing at 25°C were
adjusted to 107 cells/ml and then serially diluted 1:10. The
different dilutions were spotted onto YES and YES + 1.2 M sorbitol
plates, incubated for 2–3 d at the indicated temperatures, and
photographed. Latrunculin A (Lat A; Enzo Life Sciences) was used at a
100-µM final concentration (from a stock of 10 mM in DMSO). Methyl
benzimidazol-2-yl-carbamate (MBC; Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a 25-µg/ml
final concentration (from a stock of 5 mg/ml in DMSO). General procedures for
yeast and bacterial culture and genetic manipulations were performed as
described previously (Moreno et al.,
1991; Sambrook and Russell,
2001).Plasmids and DNA techniquespSK-ags1+ is an 11.3-kb EcoRI–ApaI DNA
fragment containing the ags1+ gene sequence
cloned in two steps into the Bluescript SK+ vector. First, a
7.9-kb EcoRI–SalI 5′-ags1+
fragment (5.1 kb of ags1+ ORF) from
pDB248X-ags1+ (a gift from Takashi Toda,
London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK), and then a 3.4-kb
SalI–ApaI 3′-ags1+ fragment
(2.1 kb of ags1+ ORF) PCR-amplified from
genomic DNA, were cloned.The 7.2-kb ags1+ ORF sequence from
pSK-ags1+ containing the sites NotI
before the start codon and BamHI after the termination codon, inserted by
site-directed mutagenesis, was cloned into NotI–BamHI of pJR2-81XL,
pJR2-41XL, and pJR2-41XH (S. cerevisiae LEU2 and S.
pombe his3+ selection, and 81X and 41X versions
of the thiamine-repressible nmt1+ promoter,
respectively; Moreno et al., 2000). The
levels of ags1+ repression from the resulting
81X and 41X plasmids were analyzed in an ags1Δ
background. All the strains displayed a lethal lytic phenotype in repressed
conditions (presence of thiamine) even with the 41X promoter, and the wild-type
phenotype in induced conditions (absence of thiamine). As expected, lysis and
cell growth arrest appeared earlier in
81X-ags1+ strains due to their reduced
ags1+ expression. To find the optimal
ags1+ repression level, three increasing
deletions (AscI–NotI, SacII–NotI and NruI–NotI) in the
multiple cloning site (MCS) were made to approach
ags1+ ORF and 81X promoter, thus
gradually increasing the ags1+ expression
level as described for bgs1+ (Cortés et al., 2007). The optimal
81X-ags1+ repression conditions were
achieved with the MCS NruI–NotI deletion between 81X promoter and
ags1+ ORF. The lysis was only slightly
slower but the appearance of revertant survivors observed with the other
constructs decreased.The ags1+ shut-off phenotype of strains
containing multicopy p81X-ags1+ plasmids was
heterogeneous and the appearance of revertant or attenuated clones was detected.
To obtain a strain with a more uniform and stable
ags1+ shut-off phenotype that could
be useful to study the Ags1 absence effect, a strain with an integrated
81X-ags1+ single copy was made (see
above). To ensure that the low expression level of a single
81X-ags1+ copy would still be able to
maintain wild-type cells under induced conditions, the
81X-ags1+ MCS-NruI/NotIΔ sequence
was selected.
pSK-Pags1+-ura4+-81X-ags11-2603
contains an ags1+ promoter fragment
(−2125 to −1099), the ura4+
sequence, and an 81X-ags1+ 5′ORF
fragment (+1 to +2603) from
p81XL-ags1+ MCS-NruI/NotIΔ. An
ApaI–ApaI
Pags1+-ura4+-81X-ags11-2603
fragment was used as a substitution cassette to make the integrated
81X-ags1+ strains. Similarly, a
41X-ags1+ MCS-NruI/NotIΔ strain
was made and analyzed as well.pSK-ura4+-ags13704-7233
(ura4+ selection) is a 4.8-kb
BstBI–ApaI fragment containing 3.5 kb of
ags1+ 3′ORF and 1.3 kb of
ags1+ 3′UTR cloned into
ClaI–ApaI sites of pSK-ura4+ (Moreno et al., 2000).
pJK-ags11-6267 is the integrative pJK148
(leu1+ selection) with a 9.1-kb
ApaI–NheI fragment, containing 2.9 kb of
ags1+ promoter and 6.2 kb of
ags1+ 5′ORF, overlapping 2.5 kb of
the above ags1+ 3′ORF fragment (Fig.
S1 A). Cut-directed integration and recombination between both plasmids restored
the complete ags1+ coding sequence (see above
strains).To provide a flexible linker between GFP and the target proteins, a 12-alanine
coding sequence was fused to the GFP 5′ and/or
3′-end of pKS-GFP (Cortés et al., 2002), making
pKS-GFP-12A,
pKS-12A-GFP, and
pKS-12A*-GFP-12A.
12A* indicates a nucleotide sequence different from
12A, thus avoiding homologous recombination.To obtain a functional GFP-fused Ags1 and because bioinformatic algorithms
predicted a putative signal peptide in the Ags1 N terminus, an Ags1 C-terminal
GFP tagging was analyzed first. An ags1Δ strain
containing ags1-GFP 3′ORF from

ags1+ 3′ORF, 1.3 kb 3′UTR,
and 12A-GFP inserted in frame before the TAG stop codon)
integrated into the ags1+ 3′UTR (see
above) was transformed with overlapping AgeI-cut
pJK-ags11-6267
(leu1+ selection, 2.9 kb promoter, 6.2 kb
ags1+ 5′ORF), restoring the
complete ags1+-GFP coding
sequence (see above). However, the resulting Ags1-GFP fusion was nonfunctional
in an ags1Δ background. Similarly, an
ags1Δ strain containing ags1
3′ORF from
pSK-ura4+-ags13704-7233
was transformed with AgeI-cut pJK-GFP-ags11-6267
(GFP-12A inserted in frame after the ATG start codon), but
the resulting N-terminal GFP-Ags1 fusion was also nonfunctional (Fig. 1 A). Due to the possibility of a
signal peptide, GFP inserted at different sites just before or after the
predicted cleavage site of Ags1 (aa 26–27) was analyzed. The
12A*-GFP-12A sequence was inserted in-frame at
ags1+ bases 73, 82, 85, 91, 97, and 103
(aa 25, 28, 29, 31, 33, and 35, respectively) of
pJK-ags11-6267. As before, the resulting
GFP-Ags1 fusions were nonfunctional (Fig. 1
A).Next, the five most hydrophilic regions of both α-amylase and glycogen
synthase domains of Ags1 (Hochstenbach et al.,
1998), as deduced from hydropathy analysis, were selected. A
hydropathy plot was generated using Membrane Protein Explorer software (MPEx,
ver. 3.2; Snider et al., 2009) with an
octanol Wimley-White scale and a window size of 19. The amino acids predicted at
the boundaries between secondary structures were then chosen, as described for
Bgs4 (Cortés et al., 2005). As a
result, the 12A*-GFP-12A sequence was inserted in-frame
at ags1+ bases 229, 3178, 3265, 3298, and
5866 (aa 77, 1060, 1089, 1100, and 1956, respectively) of
pJK-ags11-6267. Only
pJK-ags11-6267-GFP with
12A*-GFP-12A inserted at base 5866 (aa 1956) created
a functional Ags1-GFP in an ags1Δ background (strain
3166, see above and Table S1), and therefore, it was selected for Ags1
localization studies at the physiological level (Fig. 1 A).The Cherry variant of the monomeric mRFP1 protein (Shaner et al., 2005) was used to create a functional
Ags1-RFP fusion. pKS-Cherry is pKS+ with a
BamHI–EcoRI fragment containing the 678-bp Cherry ORF
from pRSET-Cherry (provided by R.Y. Tsien, University of
California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA).
pKS-8A-Cherry-12A is
pKS-Cherry with 8- and 12-alanine coding sequences fused to
Cherry 5′ and 3′-end, respectively.
pJK-ags11-6267-Cherry is
pJK-ags11-6267 with
8A-Cherry-12A inserted at
base 5866 (amino acid 1956). The ags1Δ
ags1+-RFP strain (Table
S1) expressed a functional Ags1-RFP and therefore, it was selected for Ags1
localization studies at the physiological level.Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis109 early log-phase cells expressing the different tagged proteins
were harvested, washed with stop solution (154 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM
NaN3, and 10 mM NaF), then with buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5
mM EDTA) suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM
NaCl containing 100 µM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride and 2 µg/ml
leupeptin and aprotinin) and broken with glass beads (FastPrep FP120, 3 ×
15 s, speed of 5.5 [BIO 101; Savant]). Cell walls were removed by centrifugation
(4,500 g, 1 min, 4°C). The supernatant was collected and
cell membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 g, 1 h,
4°C), suspended in 200 µl of immunoprecipitation buffer (IPB; 50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 100 µM
phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, and 2 µg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin), and
agitated (1,300 rpm, 15 min, 1°C; Thermomixer Comfort, Eppendorf). Next,
the membrane suspension was centrifuged (21,000 g, 30 min,
4°C); the supernatant was collected, diluted with IPB, and the
solubilized membrane proteins were incubated with protein G–Sepharose 4
Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) coated with anti-GFP serum (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen) for 4 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with IPB
and suspended in sample buffer.Proteins were separated by 3–8% Tris-Acetate SDS–PAGE (NuPAGE;
Invitrogen), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (EMD Millipore), and blotted
to detect the GFP- or HA-fused epitopes with the corresponding antibodies
(monoclonal JL-8 anti-GFP 1:500 [Living colors; Takara Bio Inc.]; and monoclonal
anti-HA 1:10,000 [Roche]), and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection
kit (GE Healthcare). Western blot analysis of solubilized membrane proteins (40
µg of total protein) was performed to determine the total amount of
tagged protein.Labeling and fractionation of cell wall polysaccharides[14C]glucose labeling and fractionation of cell wall polysaccharides
were performed essentially as described previously (Ishiguro et al., 1997). Exponentially growing cells
incubated at 28°C in EMM or EMM + 1.2 M sorbitol were diluted with
the same medium, supplemented with d-[U-14C]glucose, as
specified for each case of ags1+ shut-off (10
µCi/ml for short labeling in EMM and 5 µCi/ml for longer labeling
in EMM + 1.2 M sorbitol), and they were collected at the indicated times.
Total glucose incorporation was monitored by measuring radioactivity in
trichloroacetic acid–insoluble material. Cells were harvested at early
logarithmic phase, supplemented with unlabeled cells as the carrier, washed
twice with 1 mM EDTA, and broken with glass beads in a FastPrep FP120 apparatus
(3 × 20 s, speed of 6.0 [BIO 101; Savant]). Cell walls were purified by
repeated washing and differential centrifugation (once with 1 mM EDTA, twice
with 5 M NaCl, and twice with 1 mM EDTA) at 1,000 g for 5 min.
Finally, purified cell walls were heated at 100°C for 5 min. Cell wall
samples were extracted with 6% NaOH for 60 min at 80°C and neutralized
with acetic acid. Precipitation of the galactomannan fraction from the
neutralized supernatant was performed with Fehling reagent by adding unlabeled
yeast mannan as the carrier, as described previously (Algranati et al., 1966). Other samples of cell wall
suspension were incubated with Zymolyase 100T (250 µg of enzyme and 1/10
volume of cell wall suspension; AMS Biotechnology) in 50 mM citrate-phosphate
buffer (pH 5.6) for 24 h at 30°C. Samples without enzyme were included as
a control. After incubation, samples were centrifuged and washed with the same
buffer. 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to the pellets, filtered in
Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters (3 × 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid
and 2 × 1 ml of ethanol), and their radioactivity levels were measured in
a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). These pellets were considered the
α-glucan fraction, and supernatants were the
β-glucan-plus-galactomannan fraction. β-Glucan was calculated as
radioactivity remaining after subtraction of galactomannan and α-glucan
from total cell wall incorporation. All determinations were performed in
duplicate, and data for each strain were calculated from three independent
cultures.Microscopy techniquesFor Calcofluor white fluorescence, early logarithmic-phase cells were visualized
directly by adding a solution of Calcofluor white (CW; 50 µg/ml final
concentration) to the sample and using the appropriate UV filter. Images were
obtained with a fluorescence microscope (model DM RXA; Leica), a PL APO
63×/1.32 oil PH3 objective, a digital camera (model DFC350FX; Leica) and
CW4000 cytoFISH software (Leica). Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop
software. For time-lapse imaging, 0.3–0.6 ml of log-phase cells were
collected by low speed centrifugation (3,000 g for 1 min),
suspended in 0.3 ml of EMM or EMM + 1.2 M sorbitol (with 20 µg/ml
thiamine for cells repressing ags1+)
containing CW (5 µg/ml final concentration) when necessary, and placed in
a well from a μ-Slide 8 well (80821-Uncoated; Ibidi) previously coated
with 10 µl of 1 mg/ml soybean lectin (L1395; Sigma-Aldrich). Time-lapse
experiments were made at 28°C or the specified temperature by acquiring
epifluorescence and/or phase-contrast cell images in single planes and 1
× 1 binning on an inverted microscope (model IX71; Olympus) equipped with
a PlanApo 100x/1.40 IX70 objective and a Personal DeltaVision system (Applied
Precision). Images were captured using a CoolSnap HQ2 monochrome camera
(Photometrics) and softWoRx 5.5.0 release 6 imaging software (Applied
Precision). Subsequently, GFP and RFP time-lapse images were restored and
corrected by 3D Deconvolution (conservative ratio, 10 iterations and medium
noise filtering) through softWoRx imaging software. Next, images were processed
with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Adobe Photoshop
software.For FITC-conjugated concanavalin A staining, equal amounts of log-phase
hht1+-RFP (control wild
type, nucleus labeling) and 81X-ags1+ cells
were mixed, washed with PBS (3,000 g for 1 min), suspended in
0.5 ml PBS containing 100 µg/ml FITC-conjugated concanavalin A (C7642;
Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated at 28°C for 20 min in the dark. After
incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS (3,000 g
for 1 min), resuspended in 10 µl PBS, and visualized for FITC and RFP
fluorescence. Fluorescence intensity analysis of FITC-conjugated concanavalin A
staining was made with ImageJ software by placing a fixed square on the cell
poles and measuring maximal fluorescence.Transmission electron microscopyEarly log-phase cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde EM (GA; Electron
Microscopy Science) in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 150 mM NaCl (PBS) for
2 h at 4°C, post-fixed with 1.2% potassium permanganate overnight at
4°C, and embedded in Quetol 812 as described previously (Konomi et al., 2003). Ultrathin sections
were stained in 4% uranyl acetate and 0.4% lead citrate, and viewed with a
transmission electron microscope (model H-800; Hitachi) operating at 125 kV.Scanning electron microscopyEarly log-phase cells were placed in a slide coated with 5 mg/ml soybean lectin
(L1395; Sigma-Aldrich), prefixed overnight with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at
4°C, washed three times with 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and
post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) at 4°C for 1 h. Next, the
cells were washed three times with water, dehydrated in graded acetone series
(30, 50, and 70% for 10 min; 90% for 20 min; and 100% twice for 20 and 30 min),
critical-point dried, coated with gold, and visualized with a scanning electron
microscope (model DSM 940; Carl Zeiss) operating at 30 kV.Online supplemental materialFig. S1 shows a scheme of the steps followed to obtain a fully functional
ags1+-GFP strain and images of Ags1
localization during the cell cycle and sexual differentiation and of
Ags1–Bgs1 colocalization. Fig. S2 shows time-lapse images of Ags1
localization in different SIN mutants, showing that Ags1 does not depend on the
SIN pathway for its movement from the poles to the medial zone during
cytokinesis. Fig. S3 shows genetic interactions of
ags1+ with
bgs1+ and SIN genes. The loss of Bgs1
or SIN function suppresses the lytic phenotype of Ags1 absence or
mok1-664 mutation. Fig. S4 shows images of the immediate
side-explosive cell separation in the absence of Ags1 or in the
mok1-664 mutant showing the CW-stained primary septum
remnants in the new pole of both or just one sister cell. Video 1 shows
time-lapse of a representative field of lysis in either one or both sister cells
at the beginning of cell separation of Ags1-depleted cells. Videos 2 and 5 show
time-lapses of a representative field (2) or a single cell (5) of the
progressive and symmetrical cell separation of wild-type cells. Videos 3, 4, and
6–9 show time-lapses of representative fields (3, 4) or single cells
(6–9) of the instantaneous and asymmetrical cell separation of
Ags1-depleted cells, either without (3, 6, and 7) or with sorbitol (4, 8, and
9). Video 10 shows time-lapse of Ags1-depleted sister cells remaining attached
by their side-contact region for at least two cell cycles. Table S1 lists the
fission yeast strains used in this study. Online supplemental material is

Materials and methods

Strains and culture conditionsThe S. pombe strains used in this study are enumerated in
Table
S1. ags1Δ deletion was performed in a
diploid strain by removing the entire coding sequence of an
ags1+ copy, as described for
bgs1+,
bgs3+, and
bgs4+ gene deletions (Cortés et al., 2002, 2005, 2007). Tetrad analysis of sporulated
ags1+/ags1Δ
diploids showed Ags1 to be essential, as described by previous work (Katayama et al., 1999). Haploid
ags1Δ strains were maintained viable by transforming
the heterozygous
ags1+/ags1Δ diploid
with ags1+-expressing plasmids and selecting
haploid spore clones containing the ags1Δ deletion,
which contained the corresponding ags1+
plasmid needed to maintain the cell viable.ags1Δ::ura4+
p41XH-ags1+ strain 1804
(his3+ selection) contains
ags1+ expressed under the control of the
41X version (medium expression) of the thiamine-repressible
nmt1+ promoter (Moreno et al., 2000). Other strains with different levels
of ags1+ repression were made by genetic
cross with strain 285 (Leu−, Ura−,
His−) transformed with the corresponding version of
p81XL-ags1+ and
p41XL-ags1+ (S. cerevisiae
LEU2 selection) and selection of Leu+,
Ura+, His− clones.81X-ags1+ strain 2086 contains the selection
marker ura4+ adjacent to the
nmt1+-81X promoter, followed by the
ags1+ ORF. This strain was made from a
diploid strain by homologous recombination of an ApaI–ApaI fragment of
pSK-Pags1+-ura4+-81X-ags11-2603
(see below) and sporulation. The resulting
81X-ags1+ haploid strain contained one
single integrated ags1+ copy under the
control of the 81X promoter and exhibited a strong lytic phenotype in the
presence of thiamine (repressed conditions) and a wild-type phenotype in its
absence (induced conditions).81X-ags1+
81X-bgs1+ strain 4825 was made by a
genetic cross between strains 2086
(81X-ags1+, Ura+) and 2234
(81X-bgs1+, Ura−,
5-fluoroorotic acid [FOA] selection) and random spore selection of
Ura+ clones
(81X-ags1+), followed by the analysis of the
possible differential phenotype in the presence of thiamine between single
81X-ags1+ and double
81X-ags1+
81X-bgs1+ strains. PCR analysis of
positive clones confirmed the presence of the 81X promoter and the absence of
the original promoter in both genes.The 11.3 kb ags1+-containing fragment seemed
to be toxic for cloning. Therefore, the ags1Δ strain
containing an integrated
ags1+-GFP copy was made
sequentially with two overlapping fragments that restore the entire
ags1+ sequence (Fig. S1 A). First, strain
1804 (ags1Δ::ura4+
p41XH-ags1+,
his3+ selection) was made
Ura− by transformation with a
ura4+-empty ags1Δ
deletion cassette and colony selection in minimal medium containing FOA to make
strain 2881 (ags1Δ
p41XH-ags1+). Then, the
ags1Δ p41XH-ags1+
strain was transformed with SpeI-cut
pSK-ura4+-ags13704-7233
(ura4+ selection, 3.5 kb
ags1+ 3′ORF, and 1.3 kb
3′UTR), which directed its integration at the SpeI site at position
+431 of ags1+ 3′UTR. Correct
integration was confirmed by PCR analysis using pairs of oligonucleotides
external and internal to the integrated fragment. The resulting strain 2939
(ags1Δ
3′UTRags1+::ags13704-7233:ura4+
p41XH-ags1+) was transformed with
AgeI-cut pJK-ags11-6267-GFP
(leu1+ selection, 2.9 kb promoter, 6.2 kb
ags1+ 5′ORF, and 0.7 kb
12A-GFP-12A inserted in frame at base 5866 of
ags1+ ORF, see below), which directed its
integration at the AgeI site at base 6025 in the
ags1+ 3′ORF, and restored the
complete ags1+ coding sequence (Fig. S1 A).
To eliminate p41XH-ags1+, to confirm
ags1+ reconstruction, and to analyze
Ags1-GFP functionality, this strain was crossed with strain 285
(Leu−, Ura−, His−) and
tetrad analysis was performed. Leu and Ura phenotypes always co-segregated
2+:2− as expected after ags1+
restoration. p41XH-ags1+ was lost in most of
the clones as a result of the sporulation process. The obtained
ags1Δ
ags1+-GFP strain
displayed a wild-type phenotype under all tested conditions and expressed
Ags1-GFP at physiological levels from a single integrated
ags1+-GFP gene under the
control of its own promoter. Similarly, an ags1Δ
ags1+-RFP strain
expressing a fully functional Ags1-RFP (Cherry variant; Shaner et al., 2005) from
pJK-ags11-6267-Cherry was also made.Standard complete yeast growth (YES), selective (EMM), and sporulation (SPA)
media (Egel, 1984; Alfa et al., 1993) have already been
described. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the A600 of early
log-phase cell cultures in a Coleman Junior II spectrophotometer
(OD600 0.15 = 107 cells/ml). For serial
dilution drop tests of growth, early log-phase cells growing at 25°C were
adjusted to 107 cells/ml and then serially diluted 1:10. The
different dilutions were spotted onto YES and YES + 1.2 M sorbitol
plates, incubated for 2–3 d at the indicated temperatures, and
photographed. Latrunculin A (Lat A; Enzo Life Sciences) was used at a
100-µM final concentration (from a stock of 10 mM in DMSO). Methyl
benzimidazol-2-yl-carbamate (MBC; Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a 25-µg/ml
final concentration (from a stock of 5 mg/ml in DMSO). General procedures for
yeast and bacterial culture and genetic manipulations were performed as
described previously (Moreno et al.,
1991; Sambrook and Russell,
2001).

81X-ags1+ strain 2086 contains the selection
marker ura4+ adjacent to the
nmt1+-81X promoter, followed by the

Standard complete yeast growth (YES), selective (EMM), and sporulation (SPA)

final concentration (from a stock of 5 mg/ml in DMSO). General procedures for
yeast and bacterial culture and genetic manipulations were performed as
described previously (Moreno et al.,
1991; Sambrook and Russell,
2001).

Plasmids and DNA techniquespSK-ags1+ is an 11.3-kb EcoRI–ApaI DNA
fragment containing the ags1+ gene sequence
cloned in two steps into the Bluescript SK+ vector. First, a
7.9-kb EcoRI–SalI 5′-ags1+
fragment (5.1 kb of ags1+ ORF) from
pDB248X-ags1+ (a gift from Takashi Toda,
London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK), and then a 3.4-kb
SalI–ApaI 3′-ags1+ fragment
(2.1 kb of ags1+ ORF) PCR-amplified from
genomic DNA, were cloned.The 7.2-kb ags1+ ORF sequence from
pSK-ags1+ containing the sites NotI
before the start codon and BamHI after the termination codon, inserted by
site-directed mutagenesis, was cloned into NotI–BamHI of pJR2-81XL,
pJR2-41XL, and pJR2-41XH (S. cerevisiae LEU2 and S.
pombe his3+ selection, and 81X and 41X versions
of the thiamine-repressible nmt1+ promoter,
respectively; Moreno et al., 2000). The
levels of ags1+ repression from the resulting
81X and 41X plasmids were analyzed in an ags1Δ
background. All the strains displayed a lethal lytic phenotype in repressed
conditions (presence of thiamine) even with the 41X promoter, and the wild-type
phenotype in induced conditions (absence of thiamine). As expected, lysis and
cell growth arrest appeared earlier in
81X-ags1+ strains due to their reduced
ags1+ expression. To find the optimal
ags1+ repression level, three increasing
deletions (AscI–NotI, SacII–NotI and NruI–NotI) in the
multiple cloning site (MCS) were made to approach
ags1+ ORF and 81X promoter, thus
gradually increasing the ags1+ expression
level as described for bgs1+ (Cortés et al., 2007). The optimal
81X-ags1+ repression conditions were
achieved with the MCS NruI–NotI deletion between 81X promoter and
ags1+ ORF. The lysis was only slightly
slower but the appearance of revertant survivors observed with the other
constructs decreased.The ags1+ shut-off phenotype of strains
containing multicopy p81X-ags1+ plasmids was
heterogeneous and the appearance of revertant or attenuated clones was detected.
To obtain a strain with a more uniform and stable
ags1+ shut-off phenotype that could
be useful to study the Ags1 absence effect, a strain with an integrated
81X-ags1+ single copy was made (see
above). To ensure that the low expression level of a single
81X-ags1+ copy would still be able to
maintain wild-type cells under induced conditions, the
81X-ags1+ MCS-NruI/NotIΔ sequence
was selected.
pSK-Pags1+-ura4+-81X-ags11-2603
contains an ags1+ promoter fragment
(−2125 to −1099), the ura4+
sequence, and an 81X-ags1+ 5′ORF
fragment (+1 to +2603) from
p81XL-ags1+ MCS-NruI/NotIΔ. An
ApaI–ApaI
Pags1+-ura4+-81X-ags11-2603
fragment was used as a substitution cassette to make the integrated
81X-ags1+ strains. Similarly, a
41X-ags1+ MCS-NruI/NotIΔ strain
was made and analyzed as well.pSK-ura4+-ags13704-7233
(ura4+ selection) is a 4.8-kb
BstBI–ApaI fragment containing 3.5 kb of
ags1+ 3′ORF and 1.3 kb of
ags1+ 3′UTR cloned into
ClaI–ApaI sites of pSK-ura4+ (Moreno et al., 2000).
pJK-ags11-6267 is the integrative pJK148
(leu1+ selection) with a 9.1-kb
ApaI–NheI fragment, containing 2.9 kb of
ags1+ promoter and 6.2 kb of
ags1+ 5′ORF, overlapping 2.5 kb of
the above ags1+ 3′ORF fragment (Fig.
S1 A). Cut-directed integration and recombination between both plasmids restored
the complete ags1+ coding sequence (see above
strains).To provide a flexible linker between GFP and the target proteins, a 12-alanine
coding sequence was fused to the GFP 5′ and/or
3′-end of pKS-GFP (Cortés et al., 2002), making
pKS-GFP-12A,
pKS-12A-GFP, and
pKS-12A*-GFP-12A.
12A* indicates a nucleotide sequence different from
12A, thus avoiding homologous recombination.To obtain a functional GFP-fused Ags1 and because bioinformatic algorithms
predicted a putative signal peptide in the Ags1 N terminus, an Ags1 C-terminal
GFP tagging was analyzed first. An ags1Δ strain
containing ags1-GFP 3′ORF from
pSK-ura4+-ags13704-7233-GFP
(ura4+ selection, 3.5 kb
ags1+ 3′ORF, 1.3 kb 3′UTR,
and 12A-GFP inserted in frame before the TAG stop codon)
integrated into the ags1+ 3′UTR (see
above) was transformed with overlapping AgeI-cut
pJK-ags11-6267
(leu1+ selection, 2.9 kb promoter, 6.2 kb
ags1+ 5′ORF), restoring the
complete ags1+-GFP coding
sequence (see above). However, the resulting Ags1-GFP fusion was nonfunctional
in an ags1Δ background. Similarly, an
ags1Δ strain containing ags1
3′ORF from
pSK-ura4+-ags13704-7233
was transformed with AgeI-cut pJK-GFP-ags11-6267
(GFP-12A inserted in frame after the ATG start codon), but
the resulting N-terminal GFP-Ags1 fusion was also nonfunctional (Fig. 1 A). Due to the possibility of a
signal peptide, GFP inserted at different sites just before or after the
predicted cleavage site of Ags1 (aa 26–27) was analyzed. The
12A*-GFP-12A sequence was inserted in-frame at
ags1+ bases 73, 82, 85, 91, 97, and 103
(aa 25, 28, 29, 31, 33, and 35, respectively) of
pJK-ags11-6267. As before, the resulting
GFP-Ags1 fusions were nonfunctional (Fig. 1
A).Next, the five most hydrophilic regions of both α-amylase and glycogen
synthase domains of Ags1 (Hochstenbach et al.,
1998), as deduced from hydropathy analysis, were selected. A
hydropathy plot was generated using Membrane Protein Explorer software (MPEx,
ver. 3.2; Snider et al., 2009) with an
octanol Wimley-White scale and a window size of 19. The amino acids predicted at
the boundaries between secondary structures were then chosen, as described for
Bgs4 (Cortés et al., 2005). As a
result, the 12A*-GFP-12A sequence was inserted in-frame
at ags1+ bases 229, 3178, 3265, 3298, and
5866 (aa 77, 1060, 1089, 1100, and 1956, respectively) of
pJK-ags11-6267. Only
pJK-ags11-6267-GFP with
12A*-GFP-12A inserted at base 5866 (aa 1956) created
a functional Ags1-GFP in an ags1Δ background (strain
3166, see above and Table S1), and therefore, it was selected for Ags1
localization studies at the physiological level (Fig. 1 A).The Cherry variant of the monomeric mRFP1 protein (Shaner et al., 2005) was used to create a functional
Ags1-RFP fusion. pKS-Cherry is pKS+ with a
BamHI–EcoRI fragment containing the 678-bp Cherry ORF
from pRSET-Cherry (provided by R.Y. Tsien, University of
California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA).
pKS-8A-Cherry-12A is
pKS-Cherry with 8- and 12-alanine coding sequences fused to
Cherry 5′ and 3′-end, respectively.
pJK-ags11-6267-Cherry is
pJK-ags11-6267 with
8A-Cherry-12A inserted at
base 5866 (amino acid 1956). The ags1Δ
ags1+-RFP strain (Table
S1) expressed a functional Ags1-RFP and therefore, it was selected for Ags1
localization studies at the physiological level.

Plasmids and DNA techniques

pSK-ags1+ is an 11.3-kb EcoRI–ApaI DNA
fragment containing the ags1+ gene sequence
cloned in two steps into the Bluescript SK+ vector. First, a
7.9-kb EcoRI–SalI 5′-ags1+
fragment (5.1 kb of ags1+ ORF) from
pDB248X-ags1+ (a gift from Takashi Toda,
London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK), and then a 3.4-kb
SalI–ApaI 3′-ags1+ fragment
(2.1 kb of ags1+ ORF) PCR-amplified from
genomic DNA, were cloned.

The 7.2-kb ags1+ ORF sequence from
pSK-ags1+ containing the sites NotI
before the start codon and BamHI after the termination codon, inserted by
site-directed mutagenesis, was cloned into NotI–BamHI of pJR2-81XL,
pJR2-41XL, and pJR2-41XH (S. cerevisiae LEU2 and S.
pombe his3+ selection, and 81X and 41X versions
of the thiamine-repressible nmt1+ promoter,
respectively; Moreno et al., 2000). The
levels of ags1+ repression from the resulting
81X and 41X plasmids were analyzed in an ags1Δ
background. All the strains displayed a lethal lytic phenotype in repressed
conditions (presence of thiamine) even with the 41X promoter, and the wild-type
phenotype in induced conditions (absence of thiamine). As expected, lysis and
cell growth arrest appeared earlier in
81X-ags1+ strains due to their reduced
ags1+ expression. To find the optimal
ags1+ repression level, three increasing
deletions (AscI–NotI, SacII–NotI and NruI–NotI) in the
multiple cloning site (MCS) were made to approach
ags1+ ORF and 81X promoter, thus
gradually increasing the ags1+ expression
level as described for bgs1+ (Cortés et al., 2007). The optimal
81X-ags1+ repression conditions were
achieved with the MCS NruI–NotI deletion between 81X promoter and
ags1+ ORF. The lysis was only slightly
slower but the appearance of revertant survivors observed with the other
constructs decreased.

The ags1+ shut-off phenotype of strains
containing multicopy p81X-ags1+ plasmids was
heterogeneous and the appearance of revertant or attenuated clones was detected.
To obtain a strain with a more uniform and stable
ags1+ shut-off phenotype that could
be useful to study the Ags1 absence effect, a strain with an integrated
81X-ags1+ single copy was made (see
above). To ensure that the low expression level of a single
81X-ags1+ copy would still be able to
maintain wild-type cells under induced conditions, the
81X-ags1+ MCS-NruI/NotIΔ sequence
was selected.

contains an ags1+ promoter fragment
(−2125 to −1099), the ura4+
sequence, and an 81X-ags1+ 5′ORF
fragment (+1 to +2603) from

ApaI–ApaI
Pags1+-ura4+-81X-ags11-2603
fragment was used as a substitution cassette to make the integrated
81X-ags1+ strains. Similarly, a
41X-ags1+ MCS-NruI/NotIΔ strain
was made and analyzed as well.

and 12A-GFP inserted in frame before the TAG stop codon)
integrated into the ags1+ 3′UTR (see
above) was transformed with overlapping AgeI-cut
pJK-ags11-6267
(leu1+ selection, 2.9 kb promoter, 6.2 kb
ags1+ 5′ORF), restoring the
complete ags1+-GFP coding
sequence (see above). However, the resulting Ags1-GFP fusion was nonfunctional

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis109 early log-phase cells expressing the different tagged proteins
were harvested, washed with stop solution (154 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM
NaN3, and 10 mM NaF), then with buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5
mM EDTA) suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM
NaCl containing 100 µM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride and 2 µg/ml
leupeptin and aprotinin) and broken with glass beads (FastPrep FP120, 3 ×
15 s, speed of 5.5 [BIO 101; Savant]). Cell walls were removed by centrifugation
(4,500 g, 1 min, 4°C). The supernatant was collected and
cell membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 g, 1 h,
4°C), suspended in 200 µl of immunoprecipitation buffer (IPB; 50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 100 µM
phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, and 2 µg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin), and
agitated (1,300 rpm, 15 min, 1°C; Thermomixer Comfort, Eppendorf). Next,
the membrane suspension was centrifuged (21,000 g, 30 min,
4°C); the supernatant was collected, diluted with IPB, and the
solubilized membrane proteins were incubated with protein G–Sepharose 4
Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) coated with anti-GFP serum (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen) for 4 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with IPB
and suspended in sample buffer.Proteins were separated by 3–8% Tris-Acetate SDS–PAGE (NuPAGE;
Invitrogen), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (EMD Millipore), and blotted
to detect the GFP- or HA-fused epitopes with the corresponding antibodies
(monoclonal JL-8 anti-GFP 1:500 [Living colors; Takara Bio Inc.]; and monoclonal
anti-HA 1:10,000 [Roche]), and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection
kit (GE Healthcare). Western blot analysis of solubilized membrane proteins (40
µg of total protein) was performed to determine the total amount of
tagged protein.

Labeling and fractionation of cell wall polysaccharides[14C]glucose labeling and fractionation of cell wall polysaccharides
were performed essentially as described previously (Ishiguro et al., 1997). Exponentially growing cells
incubated at 28°C in EMM or EMM + 1.2 M sorbitol were diluted with
the same medium, supplemented with d-[U-14C]glucose, as
specified for each case of ags1+ shut-off (10
µCi/ml for short labeling in EMM and 5 µCi/ml for longer labeling
in EMM + 1.2 M sorbitol), and they were collected at the indicated times.
Total glucose incorporation was monitored by measuring radioactivity in
trichloroacetic acid–insoluble material. Cells were harvested at early
logarithmic phase, supplemented with unlabeled cells as the carrier, washed
twice with 1 mM EDTA, and broken with glass beads in a FastPrep FP120 apparatus
(3 × 20 s, speed of 6.0 [BIO 101; Savant]). Cell walls were purified by
repeated washing and differential centrifugation (once with 1 mM EDTA, twice
with 5 M NaCl, and twice with 1 mM EDTA) at 1,000 g for 5 min.
Finally, purified cell walls were heated at 100°C for 5 min. Cell wall
samples were extracted with 6% NaOH for 60 min at 80°C and neutralized
with acetic acid. Precipitation of the galactomannan fraction from the
neutralized supernatant was performed with Fehling reagent by adding unlabeled
yeast mannan as the carrier, as described previously (Algranati et al., 1966). Other samples of cell wall
suspension were incubated with Zymolyase 100T (250 µg of enzyme and 1/10
volume of cell wall suspension; AMS Biotechnology) in 50 mM citrate-phosphate
buffer (pH 5.6) for 24 h at 30°C. Samples without enzyme were included as
a control. After incubation, samples were centrifuged and washed with the same
buffer. 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to the pellets, filtered in
Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters (3 × 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid
and 2 × 1 ml of ethanol), and their radioactivity levels were measured in
a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). These pellets were considered the
α-glucan fraction, and supernatants were the
β-glucan-plus-galactomannan fraction. β-Glucan was calculated as
radioactivity remaining after subtraction of galactomannan and α-glucan
from total cell wall incorporation. All determinations were performed in
duplicate, and data for each strain were calculated from three independent
cultures.

Microscopy techniquesFor Calcofluor white fluorescence, early logarithmic-phase cells were visualized
directly by adding a solution of Calcofluor white (CW; 50 µg/ml final
concentration) to the sample and using the appropriate UV filter. Images were
obtained with a fluorescence microscope (model DM RXA; Leica), a PL APO
63×/1.32 oil PH3 objective, a digital camera (model DFC350FX; Leica) and
CW4000 cytoFISH software (Leica). Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop
software. For time-lapse imaging, 0.3–0.6 ml of log-phase cells were
collected by low speed centrifugation (3,000 g for 1 min),
suspended in 0.3 ml of EMM or EMM + 1.2 M sorbitol (with 20 µg/ml
thiamine for cells repressing ags1+)
containing CW (5 µg/ml final concentration) when necessary, and placed in
a well from a μ-Slide 8 well (80821-Uncoated; Ibidi) previously coated
with 10 µl of 1 mg/ml soybean lectin (L1395; Sigma-Aldrich). Time-lapse
experiments were made at 28°C or the specified temperature by acquiring
epifluorescence and/or phase-contrast cell images in single planes and 1
× 1 binning on an inverted microscope (model IX71; Olympus) equipped with
a PlanApo 100x/1.40 IX70 objective and a Personal DeltaVision system (Applied
Precision). Images were captured using a CoolSnap HQ2 monochrome camera
(Photometrics) and softWoRx 5.5.0 release 6 imaging software (Applied
Precision). Subsequently, GFP and RFP time-lapse images were restored and
corrected by 3D Deconvolution (conservative ratio, 10 iterations and medium
noise filtering) through softWoRx imaging software. Next, images were processed
with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Adobe Photoshop
software.For FITC-conjugated concanavalin A staining, equal amounts of log-phase
hht1+-RFP (control wild
type, nucleus labeling) and 81X-ags1+ cells
were mixed, washed with PBS (3,000 g for 1 min), suspended in
0.5 ml PBS containing 100 µg/ml FITC-conjugated concanavalin A (C7642;
Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated at 28°C for 20 min in the dark. After
incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS (3,000 g
for 1 min), resuspended in 10 µl PBS, and visualized for FITC and RFP
fluorescence. Fluorescence intensity analysis of FITC-conjugated concanavalin A
staining was made with ImageJ software by placing a fixed square on the cell
poles and measuring maximal fluorescence.

for 1 min), resuspended in 10 µl PBS, and visualized for FITC and RFP
fluorescence. Fluorescence intensity analysis of FITC-conjugated concanavalin A
staining was made with ImageJ software by placing a fixed square on the cell
poles and measuring maximal fluorescence.

Transmission electron microscopyEarly log-phase cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde EM (GA; Electron
Microscopy Science) in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 150 mM NaCl (PBS) for
2 h at 4°C, post-fixed with 1.2% potassium permanganate overnight at
4°C, and embedded in Quetol 812 as described previously (Konomi et al., 2003). Ultrathin sections
were stained in 4% uranyl acetate and 0.4% lead citrate, and viewed with a
transmission electron microscope (model H-800; Hitachi) operating at 125 kV.

Scanning electron microscopyEarly log-phase cells were placed in a slide coated with 5 mg/ml soybean lectin
(L1395; Sigma-Aldrich), prefixed overnight with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at
4°C, washed three times with 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and
post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) at 4°C for 1 h. Next, the
cells were washed three times with water, dehydrated in graded acetone series
(30, 50, and 70% for 10 min; 90% for 20 min; and 100% twice for 20 and 30 min),
critical-point dried, coated with gold, and visualized with a scanning electron
microscope (model DSM 940; Carl Zeiss) operating at 30 kV.

Online supplemental materialFig. S1 shows a scheme of the steps followed to obtain a fully functional
ags1+-GFP strain and images of Ags1
localization during the cell cycle and sexual differentiation and of
Ags1–Bgs1 colocalization. Fig. S2 shows time-lapse images of Ags1
localization in different SIN mutants, showing that Ags1 does not depend on the
SIN pathway for its movement from the poles to the medial zone during
cytokinesis. Fig. S3 shows genetic interactions of
ags1+ with
bgs1+ and SIN genes. The loss of Bgs1
or SIN function suppresses the lytic phenotype of Ags1 absence or
mok1-664 mutation. Fig. S4 shows images of the immediate
side-explosive cell separation in the absence of Ags1 or in the
mok1-664 mutant showing the CW-stained primary septum
remnants in the new pole of both or just one sister cell. Video 1 shows
time-lapse of a representative field of lysis in either one or both sister cells
at the beginning of cell separation of Ags1-depleted cells. Videos 2 and 5 show
time-lapses of a representative field (2) or a single cell (5) of the
progressive and symmetrical cell separation of wild-type cells. Videos 3, 4, and
6–9 show time-lapses of representative fields (3, 4) or single cells
(6–9) of the instantaneous and asymmetrical cell separation of
Ags1-depleted cells, either without (3, 6, and 7) or with sorbitol (4, 8, and
9). Video 10 shows time-lapse of Ags1-depleted sister cells remaining attached
by their side-contact region for at least two cell cycles. Table S1 lists the
fission yeast strains used in this study. Online supplemental material is
