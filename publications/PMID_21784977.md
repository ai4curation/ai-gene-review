Zinc finger protein tristetraprolin (TTP) modulates macrophage inflammatory 
activity by destabilizing cytokine mRNAs. In this study, through a screen of 
TTP-bound mRNAs in activated human macrophages, we have identified CCL3 mRNA as 
the most abundantly bound TTP target mRNA and have characterized this 
interaction via conserved AU-rich elements. Compared to the wild-type cells, 
TTP(-/-) macrophages produced higher levels of LPS-induced CCL3. In addition, 
the plasma level of CCL3 in TTP(-/-) mice was markedly higher than that in 
wild-type mice. To determine the in vivo significance of TTP-regulated CCL3, we 
generated CCL3(-/-)TTP(-/-) double-knockout mice. Along with decreased 
proinflammatory cytokines in their paw joints, there were significant functional 
and histologic improvements in the inflammatory arthritis of TTP(-/-) mice when 
CCL3 was absent, although cachexia, reflecting systemic inflammation, was 
notably unaffected. Furthermore, the marked exacerbation of aortic plaque 
formation caused by TTP deficiency in the APOE(-/-) mouse model of 
atherosclerosis was also rescued by disrupting CCL3. Taken together, our data 
indicate that the interaction between TTP and CCL3 mRNA plays an important role 
in modulating localized inflammatory processes in tissues that are dissociated 
from the systemic manifestations of chronic inflammation.
