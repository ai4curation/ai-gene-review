Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) have less rRNA content and 36 
additional proteins compared with the evolutionarily related bacterial ribosome. 
These differences make the assembly of mitoribosomes more complex than the 
assembly of bacterial ribosomes, but the molecular details of mitoribosomal 
biogenesis remain elusive. Here, we report the structures of two late-stage 
assembly intermediates of the human mitoribosomal large subunit (mt-LSU) 
isolated from a native pool within a human cell line and solved by cryo-EM to 
∼3-Å resolution. Comparison of the structures reveals insights into the timing 
of rRNA folding and protein incorporation during the final steps of ribosomal 
maturation and the evolutionary adaptations that are required to preserve 
biogenesis after the structural diversification of mitoribosomes. Furthermore, 
the structures redefine the ribosome silencing factor (RsfS) family as 
multifunctional biogenesis factors and identify two new assembly factors (L0R8F8 
and mt-ACP) not previously implicated in mitoribosomal biogenesis.
