beta-Catenin is an essential molecule in Wnt/wingless signaling, which controls 
decisive steps in embryogenesis. To study the role of beta-catenin in skin 
development, we introduced a conditional mutation of the gene in the epidermis 
and hair follicles using Cre/loxP technology. When beta-catenin is mutated 
during embryogenesis, formation of placodes that generate hair follicles is 
blocked. We show that beta-catenin is required genetically downstream of 
tabby/downless and upstream of bmp and shh in placode formation. If beta-catenin 
is deleted after hair follicles have formed, hair is completely lost after the 
first hair cycle. Further analysis demonstrates that beta-catenin is essential 
for fate decisions of skin stem cells: in the absence of beta-catenin, stem 
cells fail to differentiate into follicular keratinocytes, but instead adopt an 
epidermal fate.
