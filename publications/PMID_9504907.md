The POP2 (Caf1) protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae affects a variety of 
transcriptional processes and is a component of the Ccr4p complex. We have 
isolated five multicopy suppressor genes of a pop2 deletion mutation: CCR4, DHH1 
(a putative RNA helicase), PKC1, STM1, and MPT5 (multicopy suppressor of pop 
two). Overexpression of either the CCR4 or DHH1 genes effectively suppressed 
phenotypes associated with pop2 mutant cells; overexpression of PKC1, STM1, or 
MPT5 genes produced only partial suppression. Disruption of the CCR4 or DHH1 
genes resulted in phenotypes similar to those observed for pop2 cells. In 
addition, overexpression of the DHH1 gene also suppressed the ccr4 mutation, 
suggesting a close relationship between the POP2, CCR4, and DHH1 genes. 
Two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Pop2p 
and Dhh1p interact physically, and these and other data suggest that Dhh1p is 
also a component of the Ccr4p complex. Finally, we investigated the genetic 
interaction between factors associated with POP2 and the PKC1 pathway. The 
temperature-sensitive growth defect of dhh1 or mpt5 cells was suppressed by 
overexpression of PKC1, and the defect of mpk1 cells was suppressed by 
overexpression of MPT5. These results and phenotypic analysis of double mutants 
from the POP2 and PKC1 pathways suggested that the POP2 and the PKC1 pathways 
are independent but have some overlapping functions.
