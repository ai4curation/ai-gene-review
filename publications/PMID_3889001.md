Purification and properties of the dnaJ replication protein of Escherichia coli.

Zylicz M, Yamamoto T, McKittrick N, Sell S, Georgopoulos C.

The Escherichia coli dnaJ gene was originally discovered because mutations in it 
blocked bacteriophage lambda DNA replication. Some of these mutations were 
subsequently shown to interfere with bacterial growth at high temperature, 
suggesting that dnaJ is an essential protein for the host as well. The first 
step in purifying the dnaJ protein was to overproduce it at least 50-fold by 
subcloning its gene into the pMOB45 runaway plasmid. The second step was the 
development of an in vitro system to assay for its activity. A Fraction II 
extract from dnaJ259 mutant bacteria was shown to be unable to replicate lambda 
dv DNA unless supplemented with an exogenous source of wild-type dnaJ protein. 
Using this complementation assay we purified the dnaJ protein to homogeneity 
from the membrane fraction of an overproducing strain of bacteria. The purified 
dnaJ protein was shown to be a basic (pI 8.5), yet hydrophobic, protein of Mr 
37,000 and 76,000 under denaturing and native conditions, respectively, and to 
exhibit affinity for both single- and double-stranded DNA. Using a partially 
purified lambda dv replication system dependent on the presence of the lambda O 
and P initiator proteins and at least the host dnaB, dnaG, dnaJ, dnaK, 
single-stranded DNA-binding protein, gyrase, RNA polymerase holoenzyme, and DNA 
polymerase III holoenzyme, we have shown that the dnaJ protein is required at a 
very early step in the DNA replication process.
