Protein-disulfide isomerase-like protein of the testis (PDILT), a member of the 
protein-disulfide isomerase family, is a chaperone essential for the folding of 
spermatogenesis-specific proteins in male postmeiotic germ cells. However, the 
structural mechanisms that regulate the chaperone function of PDILTs are 
unknown. Here, we report the structures of human PDILT (hPDILT) determined by 
X-ray crystallography to 2.4 Å resolution and small-angle X-ray scattering 
(SAXS). Distinct from previously reported U-like structures of related PDI 
family proteins, our structures revealed that hPDILT folds into a compact L-like 
structure in crystals and into an extended chain-like structure in solution. The 
hydrophobic regions and the hydrophobic pockets in hPDILT, which are important 
for substrate recognition, were clearly delineated in the crystal structure. 
Moreover, our results of the SAXS analysis and of structure-based substitutions 
and truncations indicated that the C-terminal tail in hPDILT is required for 
suppression of aggregation of denatured proteins, suggesting that the tail is 
crucial for the chaperone activity of PDILT. Taken together, our findings have 
identified the critical regions and conformational changes of PDILT that enable 
and control its activity. These results advance our understanding of the 
structural mechanisms involved in the chaperone activity of PDILT.
