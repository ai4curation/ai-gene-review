Many eukaryotic proteins are tethered to the plasma membrane via 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). GPI transamidase is localized in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and mediates post-translational transfer of preformed GPI 
to proteins bearing a carboxyl-terminal GPI attachment signal. Mammalian GPI 
transamidase is a multimeric complex consisting of at least five subunits. Here 
we report that two subunits of mammalian GPI transamidase, GPI8 and PIG-T, form 
a functionally important disulfide bond between conserved cysteine residues. 
GPI8 and PIG-T mutants in which relevant cysteines were replaced with serines 
were unable to fully restore the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins 
upon transfection into their respective mutant cells. Microsomal membranes of 
these transfectants had markedly decreased activities in an in vitro 
transamidase assay. The formation of this disulfide bond is not essential but 
required for full transamidase activity. Antibodies against GPI8 and PIG-T 
revealed that endogenous as well as exogenous proteins formed a disulfide bond. 
Furthermore trypanosome GPI8 forms a similar intermolecular disulfide bond via 
its conserved cysteine residue, suggesting that the trypanosome GPI transamidase 
is also a multimeric complex likely containing the orthologue of PIG-T. We also 
demonstrate that an inactive human GPI transamidase complex that consists of 
non-functional GPI8 and four other components was co-purified with the proform 
of substrate proteins, indicating that these five components are sufficient to 
hold the substrate proteins.
