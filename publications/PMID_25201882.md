Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been associated with Parkinson's 
disease (PD) and other disorders. However, its normal physiological functions 
and pathogenic properties remain elusive. Here we show that LRRK2 regulates the 
anterograde ER-Golgi transport through anchoring Sec16A at the endoplasmic 
reticulum exit sites (ERES). LRRK2 interacted and co-localized with Sec16A, a 
key protein in the formation of ERES. Lrrk2 depletion caused a dispersion of 
Sec16A from ERES and impaired ER export. In neurons, LRRK2 and Sec16A showed 
extensive co-localization at the dendritic ERES (dERES) that locally regulate 
the transport of proteins to the dendritic spines. A loss of Lrrk2 affected the 
association of Sec16A with dERES and impaired the activity-dependent targeting 
of glutamate receptors onto the cell/synapse surface. Furthermore, the 
PD-related LRRK2 R1441C missense mutation in the GTPase domain interfered with 
the interaction of LRRK2 with Sec16A and also affected ER-Golgi transport, while 
LRRK2 kinase activity was not required for these functions. Therefore, our 
findings reveal a new physiological function of LRRK2 in ER-Golgi transport, 
suggesting ERES dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.
