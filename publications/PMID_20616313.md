RATIONALE: The ICAP1 (integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1) is a 
specific intracellular binding protein of beta1-integrins and the cerebral 
cavernous malformation (CCM) protein CCM1. ICAP1 recruits CCM1 to the cell 
membrane and activates CCM1 by changing its conformation. Because CCM1 plays a 
critical role for cardiovascular development, we hypothesized that its activator 
ICAP1 is involved in vascular differentiation.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to define the role of ICAP1 in 
endothelial cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Loss of ICAP1 in primary human endothelial cells causes 
excessive angiogenic branching and network formation in vitro (3D sprouting 
angiogenesis) and in vivo (xenotransplantation of ICAP1-silenced human 
endothelial cells). ICAP1 increases cell motility and the initial formation of 
capillary sprouts but prevents vessel outgrowth. ICAP1 inhibits Rho kinase 
activity and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation and 
induces expression of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27, leading to less 
endothelial proliferation. However, ICAP1 promotes endothelial survival and AKT 
phosphorylation. Global gene expression analyses revealed that the ICAP1 effects 
are mediated by strong activation of DELTA-NOTCH signaling. Active NOTCH1 or 
silencing of the NOTCH ligand DLL4 phenocopy the ICAP1 effects and blockade of 
NOTCH cleavage rescues the ICAP1-mediated defects in endothelial cells. Both 
ICAP1 and NOTCH1 reduce the expression of ESM1 (endothelial cell-specific 
molecule-1), and silencing of ESM1 disturbs vascular endothelial growth factor- 
or fibroblast growth factor 2-induced sprouting angiogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified ICAP1 as a novel regulator to prevent 
excessive sprouting angiogenesis.
