Abstract

Airway mucus forms the structural basis of the local innate immune defense mechanism. It is an integrated, active, viscoelastic gel matrix evolved to protect the exposed lung from physical, chemical, and pathological erosion. Exosomes are biologically active vesicles secreted by different cell types including epithelial, hematopoietic, and some tumor cells. They are also present in some biological fluids such as serum, urine, breast milk, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that exosome-like vesicles with antiviral properties are present in human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cell culture secretions. These vesicles have been isolated by differential centrifugation and are characterized further by mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and light-scattering methods. HTBE vesicles exhibited characteristic exosomal size (30–100 nm) and morphology (cup-shaped) with a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.12–1.18 g/ml.

DISCUSSION

In this study we demonstrated that human tracheobronchial epithelial cells release vesicles into the apical secretions. We have also provided evidence that confirms the vesicles are exosome-like rather than apoptotic in character, i.e. , they are excreted into airway secretion by fusion of the multivesicular bodies with the apical plasma membrane of the airway surface epithelial cells. The following evidence supports this assertion: HTBE vesicles display typical characteristics of documented exosomes, including size (30–100 nm), shape (cup-shaped) (7 , 10 , 17 , 36 , 37) , and buoyant density in sucrose (1.12–1.18 gm/ml) (7 , 29) . They have characteristic exosomal surface and cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal proteins, i.e ., CD59 (38) , MUC1 (17 , 20) , tetraspanin CD63, TSG101, actin, ezrin, and radixin, as well as membrane fusion proteins, e.g. , annexins (14 , 26 , 37 , 39) . These features, combined with the absence of DNA and related proteins such as histones and other indicators of apoptotic cell derived vesicles (10) , are all consistent with this conclusion.

Proteomic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that HTBE vesicles expressed the complement inhibitory protein CD59, which suggests a possible role of vesicles in complement regulation. We found no detectable expression of Na/K ATPase and transferrin receptor (CD71) as markers of the basolateral membranes. Also, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker calnexin was not found, which suggests that the vesicles were not derived from the ER. In addition, biochemical analysis revealed the presence of some membrane transport and channel proteins, such as chloride intracellular channel protein 1, the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, and the amino acid transporter ATB0 + . Still, one of the crucial membrane transport proteins expressed on the airway epithelial apical surfaces, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (40) , was not detected by proteomic or other biochemical analyses, such as Western blot and flow cytometry (data not shown). Some membrane fusion proteins, such as Annexin A1 and AII, major components of fusogenic endosomal vesicles (41) , and Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor beta, were present in the proteomic analysis, indicating that they originated from endosomal compartments. Several cytoskeletal-related proteins, such as tubulin and actin and its interacting/organizing proteins ( i.e. , cofilin, ezrin, radixin, and EBP50), were clearly identified. The presence of enzymes involved in intracellular metabolism ( i.e ., dehydrogenases, kinases, transferases, and enolase) inside the vesicular lumen suggest their inward invagination during intracellular formation. as previously identified (7 , 14 , 37) . Identification of ubiquitin in the HTBE vesicle preparations suggested that some ubiquitinated proteins were present in the vesicles, as previously noted in B-cell- and dendritic cell line-derived exosomes (42) , possibly derived from cytoplasmic proteins incorporated into the MVB pathway. Moreover, the presence of the late endosomal membrane protein CD63, a commonly used marker of exosomes (26) and ESCRT-1 (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-1) subunit protein Tsg101, which mediates receptor sorting into MVBs, strongly suggest that the vesicles described here are consistent with fusion of endosomal MVBs with the apical membrane. These vesicles can be contrasted with the membrane-derived microvesicles, which are released from the surface membranes during membrane blebbing and are significantly bigger in size (100–1000 μm) (3) than the vesicles described here. Taken together, we propose that the HTBE vesicles described here should be considered as HTBE exosomes.

Van Niel et al. (7) demonstrated exosome-like vesicles derived from the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line, which were similar to previously described exosomes derived from antigen representing cells such as B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. The HTBE exosomes shown here have similar shape, size, and buoyant density and have some common proteins with IEC-derived exosomes. HTBE exosomes differ from IEC-derived exosomes in that they carry no antigen-presenting MHC class I and II molecules. However, the HTBE exosomes described here present different types of surface molecules, such as MUC1 and other membrane mucins, MUC4 and MUC16.

MUC1, MUC4, and MUC 16 are epithelial cell mucins that share a similar transmembrane binding mechanism and are believed to be heterodimeric in their C terminus due to intracellular cleavage mechanisms (see ref. 43 for review). However, they differ dramatically in the size of their glycosylated domains. These molecules have now been identified in a number of studies (1 , 2 , 44 , 45) as being present in lung tissue, but knowledge of their cellular localization is less complete. MUC1 mucin has been identified previously as a part of the exosomes isolated from human breast milk (20) and urine (17) . However, to our knowledge this is the first time that MUC4 and MUC16 mucins have been associated with any vesicular and/or exosomal preparations. Our proteomic, Western blot, and flow cytometry analyses also indicate that HTBE exosomes carry MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 mucins; the detection of the MUC1 mucin is consistent, while MUC4 and MUC16 vary considerably between preparations. These molecules may control or contribute to their recognition properties. Isopycnic density gradient analysis in CsCl of the detergent-treated exosomes indicated that these mucins were found in the high-density region (1.40–1.55 g/ml), consistent with the presence of their heavily glycosylated domains. The cytoplasmic region of the MUC1 mucin, but not MUC4 nor MUC 16, was identified by MS and by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE, suggesting that MUC1, at least, is present due to membrane tethering to the exosomes. The absence of peptides from the cytoplasmic region of MUC4 and MUC16, as detected by MS, may be due to the shorter cytoplasmic tails for these mucins, containing only a single tryptic peptide as compared with five available in MUC1. It has been proposed that MUC1 mucin plays a role in the regulation of T-cell responses (46) and a modulatory role during airway infection and inflammation caused by various pathogenic bacteria and viruses (47 , 48) . High expression levels of these mucins on many human carcinoma cells, such as breast, pancreatic, and cervical cancers, make them an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. For instance, it has been demonstrated that engineered exosomes (to carry MUC1) attract an effective immunological response while suppressing tumor growth in an MHC-independent manner (49) and have been offered as a cell-free anticancer vaccine. It has also been demonstrated that both MUC4 (50 , 51) and MUC16 (52) are associated with roles in tumor growth and metastasis and are target molecules for cancer immunotherapy (51 , 53) .

Both sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and EM analysis revealed distinct exosome populations, which suggests that they may arise from different cell types in the airway epithelia. Antibody analysis on surface proteins, and membrane mucins, after a sucrose density gradient, showed at least two different populations characterized by either the presence or absence of epithelial mucins. This observation is also consistent with the EM images that show dense uranyl acetate staining around some of the exosomes, indicating the presence of negative charges consistent with sulfated and sialylated oligosaccharides as potentially presented by mucins.

We observed that HTBE exosomes were highly enriched for α-2,6-linked sialic acid terminal sugars with little to no significant α-2,3-linked sialic acid. Our CsCl isopycnic density gradient centrifugation analysis of the detergent-treated exosomes revealed that α-2,6-linked sialic acid was enriched in a high-density (1.35–1.5 g/ml) region in which MUC1, 4, and 16 mucin immunoreactivity was also observed ( Fig. 3 ). However, some immunoreactivity was detected in the low-density (1.2–1.25 gm/ml) and medium-density (1.25–1.30 gm/ml) regions, suggesting the presence of small molecules carrying α-2,6-linked sialic acid. This finding is consistent with the presence of molecules such as glycolipids and small glycoproteins, as was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 3 d , e ).

The presence of sialic acid-rich mucins on HTBE exosome structures offered a potential function of exosomes in innate defense, given the known interactions of such moieties with many viruses and bacteria (54 , 55) . As an initial test of this hypothesis, we tested the effect of mixing exosomes with a viral pathogen, human influenza virus, known to attach to α-2,6-linked sialic acid. Inhibition experiments were performed using 10 μg/200 μl exosomes, which is one-fifth the actual concentration found in the HTBE cultures (with ∼600,000 cells). Indeed, these experiments revealed that exosomal preparations neutralized influenza virus infectivity by up to 85–99%. This high degree of inhibition was ablated when exosomes pretreated with neuraminidase (NA) were used, suggesting that the interaction between exosomes and the influenza virus was sialic acid dependent. Interestingly, viral inhibition also implied that the endogenous viral NA, important for cleaving progeny virions from the cell surface, could not cleave attachment of the virus from the exosome or that the relative rates of association/dissociation favored association. With respect to the relevance of HTBE exosomes in natural infection by human influenza viruses, we could surmise that these structures may have some ability to neutralize low, environmentally relevant exposures to these viruses. The inhibition shown in the present study implies that exosomes can interact with a relevant airway pathogen via sialic acid and that this interaction may impact the ability of this virus to infect target epithelial cells.

Knowledge of the mechanisms of release and functional biology of exosomes from different cell types is still in its infancy. We show here, for the first time, that exosome-like vesicles are present in the HTBE cell culture secretions and demonstrate that they express a range of surface protective proteins, including epithelial mucins. We also confirmed that they contain detectable amounts of RNA that can synthesize cDNA. Our functional analyses indicate that these structures may have a role in innate defense against respiratory pathogens that bind sialic acid, such as human influenza virus. Comparing our findings to the current exosome literature, we propose that these structures may be involved in diverse physiological processes in airway biology, including immunomodulation, inflammation, and bacterial and viral sequestration. The latter is a novel proposed function for exosomes and will lead to a greater understanding of the role of the exosomes in airway biology and innate defense.
