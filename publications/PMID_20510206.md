Functional aminophospholipid translocases are composed of at least two proteins: 
an alpha subunit from the P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases and a beta subunit from 
the CDC50-Lem3p family. Over-expression and knockdown of the human beta subunit 
CDC50A in KB cells enhanced and decreased, respectively, the uptake of both 
fluorescent aminophospholipid analogues and the anticancer alkyl-phospholipid 
perifosine. Confocal microscopy showed that CDC50A-V5 was localized at the 
endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex of both KB (perifosine-sensitive) 
and KB PER-R (perifosine-resistant, alkyl-phospholipid uptake deficient) cells, 
but was only widely distributed in the early and late endosomes in KB cells. 
Biotinylation of cell surface proteins allowed CDC50A-V5 to be detected in the 
plasma membrane of KB cells but not in KB PER-R cells, thereby suggesting a 
defect in CDC50A trafficking that could explain the inability of KB PER-R to 
uptake perifosine. Over-expression of CDC50A in HeLa and HEK293T cells did not 
increase uptake, since the protein was retained at the endoplasmic reticulum and 
Golgi. However, when CDC50A was co-expressed with the P4-ATPase Atp8b1, the two 
proteins co-localized at the plasma membrane and the uptake of 
aminophospholipids and perifosine increased strikingly in both cell lines. These 
findings suggest that CDC50A plays a key role in perifosine uptake in human 
cells, presumably by forming a functional plasma membrane translocator in 
combination with a P4-ATPase.
