Loss-of-function mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase, are the major cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Decreases 
in parkin activity may also contribute to neurodegeneration in sporadic forms of 
PD. Here, we show that bcl-2-associated athanogene 5 (BAG5), a BAG family 
member, directly interacts with parkin and the chaperone Hsp70. Within this 
complex, BAG5 inhibits both parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and 
Hsp70-mediated refolding of misfolded proteins. BAG5 enhances parkin 
sequestration within protein aggregates and mitigates parkin-dependent 
preservation of proteasome function. Finally, BAG5 enhances dopamine neuron 
death in an in vivo model of PD, whereas a mutant that inhibits BAG5 activity 
attenuates dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This contrasts with the antideath 
functions ascribed to BAG family members and suggests a potential role for BAG5 
in promoting neurodegeneration in sporadic PD through its functional 
interactions with parkin and Hsp70.
