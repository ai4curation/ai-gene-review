Few components of the mitochondrial fission machinery are known, even though 
mitochondrial fission is a complex process of vital importance for cell growth 
and survival. Here, we describe a novel protein that controls mitochondrial 
fission. This protein was identified in a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen 
using Drosophila cells. The human homologue of this protein was named 
Mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). Mitochondria of cells transfected with Mff 
siRNA form a closed network similar to the mitochondrial networks formed when 
cells are transfected with siRNA for two established fission proteins, Drp1 and 
Fis1. Like Drp1 and Fis1 siRNA, Mff siRNA also inhibits fission induced by loss 
of mitochondrial membrane potential, it delays cytochrome c release from 
mitochondria and further progression of apoptosis, and it inhibits peroxisomal 
fission. Mff and Fis1 are both tail anchored in the mitochondrial outer 
membrane, but other parts of these proteins are very different and they exist in 
separate 200-kDa complexes, suggesting that they play different roles in the 
fission process. We conclude that Mff is a novel component of a conserved 
membrane fission pathway used for constitutive and induced fission of 
mitochondria and peroxisomes.
