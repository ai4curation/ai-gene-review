Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 is an orphan receptor 
implicated in innate immune activation. Inhibition of TREM-1 reduces sepsis in 
mouse models, suggesting a role for it in immune responses triggered by 
bacteria. However, the absence of an identified ligand has hampered a full 
understanding of TREM-1 function. We identified complexes between peptidoglycan 
recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1) and bacterially derived peptidoglycan that 
constitute a potent ligand capable of binding TREM-1 and inducing known TREM-1 
functions. Interestingly, multimerization of PGLYRP1 bypassed the need for 
peptidoglycan in TREM-1 activation, demonstrating that the PGLYRP1/TREM-1 axis 
can be activated in the absence of bacterial products. The role for PGLYRP1 as a 
TREM-1 activator provides a new mechanism by which bacteria can trigger myeloid 
cells, linking two known, but previously unrelated, pathways in innate immunity.
