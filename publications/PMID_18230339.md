We tested the activity of a p53 carboxy-terminal peptide containing the 
PARC-interacting region in cancer cells with wild type cytoplasmic p53. Peptide 
delivery was achieved by fusing it to the TAT transduction domain (TAT-p53-C-ter 
peptide). In a two-hybrid assay, the tetramerization domain (TD) of p53 was 
necessary and sufficient to bind PARC. The TAT-p53-C-ter peptide disrupted the 
PARC-p53 complex. Peptide treatment caused p53 nuclear relocation, p53-dependent 
changes in gene expression and enhancement of etoposide-induced apoptosis. These 
studies suggest that PARC-interacting peptides are promising candidates for the 
enhancement of p53-dependent apoptosis in tumors with wt cytoplasmic p53.

Abstract

We tested the activity of a p53 carboxy-terminal peptide containing the PARC-interacting region in cancer cells with wild type cytoplasmic p53. Peptide delivery was achieved by fusing it to the TAT transduction domain (TAT-p53-C-ter peptide). In a two-hybrid assay, the tetramerization domain (TD) of p53 was necessary and sufficient to bind PARC. The TAT-p53-C-ter peptide disrupted the PARC-p53 complex. Peptide treatment caused p53 nuclear relocation, p53-dependent changes in gene expression and enhancement of etoposide-induced apoptosis. These studies suggest that PARC-interacting peptides are promising candidates for the enhancement of p53-dependent apoptosis in tumours with wt cytoplasmic p53.

Introduction

In approximately 50 % of all malignancies, the normal activity of p53 is compromised by inactivating mutations [ 1 ]. In specific tumours, p53 is present in the wild type form but its activity is prevented by inappropriate cellular localization [ 2 ].

Recently, PARC has been described as a p53-interacting protein involved in the p53 cytoplasmic sequestration that occurs in certain tumours [ 3 ]. PARC functions as ubiquitin ligase and forms a multiprotein complex of approximately 1 million kDa in the cytoplasm [ 3 ]. p53 is not a substrate for ubiquitination by PARC, although the C-terminus of p53 binds to a well defined N-terminal portion of PARC termed CPH [ 4 ]. Expression of PARC is ubiquitous, but high expression has been described in some tumour types [ 3 ].

Several approaches based on the use of small molecules [ 5 ] and peptides [ 6 ] have been used to reactivate p53 function in tumours. A peptide derived from the C-terminus of p53 (C1 peptide) previously shown to activate specifically p53 DNA binding in vitro by an unknown mechanism was used in pre-clinical models of peritoneal carcinomatosis [ 7 ]. Striking reduction of metastatic burden or complete eradication of tumours was achieved by this strategy, demonstrating the feasibility of p53 reactivation even in cases of advanced cancer.

The TAT protein transduction domain is a short stretch of 11 aminoacids that renders cell-permeable virtually any peptide [ 8 ]. The TAT sequence was identified in the HIV protein Tat and other short sequences with analogous capability were recognized in other organisms [ 8 ]. Rapid and efficient TAT-mediated intracellular delivery was demonstrated utilizing in vitro [ 9 ]and in vivo systems [ 8 ].

In this paper, we attempted p53 reactivation in tumour cells harbouring cytoplasmic wild type p53 and expressing PARC by using a peptide containing the C-terminus of p53 fused with the TAT transduction domain. We show that this peptide promotes the relocation of endogenous p53 into the nucleus by disrupting its binding to PARC. p53 relocation results, in turn, in the activation of p53 transcription targets and in the enhancement of apoptosis caused by genotoxic stress.

Results and Discussion

Approximately 50% of all human tumours bear a mutation of p53 that prevents its normal function [ 1 ]. In most NB tumours and cell lines, p53 is not mutated but frequently misplaced in the cytoplasm especially in the undifferentiated forms [ 2 ]. In the U2OS osteosarcoma cells, p53 is also wt and resides in the cytoplasm [ 3 ]. Recently, PARC has been described as a cytoplasm-localized protein that binds p53 and, in some cellular contexts, prevents p53 from entering the nucleus [ 3 ]. We assessed PARC expression in 10 human NB cell lines, in Phoenix and in U2OS cells by western blotting ( Fig. 1A ). PARC protein was detectable in 7 of 10 NB cell lines, in U2OS and only barely in Phoenix cells. p53 is wt in all neuroblastoma lines except in SK-N-BE2c and SK-N-AS [ 15 ; 16 ]. We also tested the ability of PARC protein to bind p53 in LAN-5 cells by immunoprecipitation. As expected, p53 coimmunoprecipitated with PARC ( Fig. 1B ). We reasoned that in NB cells with wt p53 and PARC expression it may be possible to reactivate p53 by disrupting the p53-PARC interaction. Such interaction requires the NH 2 portion of PARC and the C-terminus of p53 [ 17 ]. The C-terminus of human p53 encoding amino acids 292–393 was cloned in-frame with the 6-histidine tag, an HA tag and a TAT sequence corresponding to 11 amino acids of the TAT protein [ 8 ] in a prokaryotic expression vector. The TAT sequence confers cell permeability to proteins to which is fused. The TAT-containing p53 (TAT-p53-C-ter) peptide was tested for its ability to enter into NB cells. The TAT-p53-C-ter peptide was detected intracellularly in a dose-dependent manner when added to cells in a concentration range of 0.5 to 10 μg/ml ( Fig. 2A ). Peptide stability was evaluated by adding the TAT-p53-C-ter peptide to the cells (5 μg/ml) for 1 hour and removing it thereafter. Cells were harvested at different times and the TAT-p53-C-ter peptide detected by western blotting. Levels of TAT-p53-C-ter peptide were markedly decreased at 1 and 2 hours and undetectable at 4 hours ( Fig. 2A ), consistent with a short half life.
