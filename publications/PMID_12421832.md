Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is a metzincin superfamily 
metalloproteinase responsible for cleavage of insulin-like growth factor-binding 
protein-4, thus causing release of bound insulin-like growth factor. PAPP-A is 
secreted as a dimer of 400 kDa but circulates in pregnancy as a disulfide-bound 
500-kDa 2:2 complex with the proform of eosinophil major basic protein 
(pro-MBP), recently shown to function as a proteinase inhibitor of PAPP-A. 
Except for PAPP-A2, PAPP-A does not share global similarity with other proteins. 
Three lin-notch (LNR or LIN-12) modules and five complement control protein 
modules (also known as SCR modules) have been identified in PAPP-A by sequence 
similarity with other proteins, but no data are available that allow unambiguous 
prediction of disulfide bonds of these modules. To establish the connectivities 
of cysteine residues of the PAPP-A.pro-MBP complex, biochemical analyses of 
peptides derived from purified protein were performed. The PAPP-A subunit 
contains a total of 82 cysteine residues, of which 81 have been accounted for. 
The pro-MBP subunit contains 12 cysteine residues, of which 10 have been 
accounted for. Within the 2:2 complex, PAPP-A is dimerized by a single disulfide 
bond; pro-MBP is dimerized by two disulfides, and each PAPP-A subunit is 
connected to a pro-MBP subunit by two disulfide bonds. All other disulfides are 
intrachain bridges. We also show that of 13 potential sites for N-linked 
carbohydrate substitution of the PAPP-A subunit, 11 are occupied. The large 
number of disulfide bonds of the PAPP-A.pro-MBP complex imposes many restraints 
on polypeptide folding, and knowledge of the disulfide pattern of PAPP-A will 
facilitate structural studies based on recombinant expression of individual, 
putative PAPP-A domains. Furthermore, it will allow rational experimental design 
of functional studies aimed at understanding the formation of the PAPP-A.pro-MBP 
complex, as well as the inhibitory mechanism of pro-MBP.
