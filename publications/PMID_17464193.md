High-throughput subcellular imaging is a powerful tool for investigating the 
function of genes. In order to identify novel regulators of apoptosis we 
transiently transfected HeLa cells with 938 hypothetical genes of unknown 
function, and captured their nuclear images with an automated fluorescence 
microscope. We selected genes that induced greater than 3-fold increase in the 
percentage of apoptotic nuclei compared with vector-transfected cells. The 
full-length genes C10orf61, MGC 26717, and FLJ13855 were identified as candidate 
proapoptotic genes, and their apoptotic effects were confirmed by DNA 
fragmentation ELISAs and Western blotting for caspase-7 and PARP. We conclude 
that a subcellular image-based apoptotic screen is useful for identifying genes 
with proapoptotic activity.
