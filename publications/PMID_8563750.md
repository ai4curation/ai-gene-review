The Ras signal transduction pathway is often deregulated in human myeloid 
leukaemia. For example, activating point mutations in RAS genes are found in 
some patients with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukaemia (JCML), while other 
patients with JCML show loss of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, a Ras 
GTPase activating protein. By generating mice whose haematopoietic system is 
reconsituted with Nf1 deficient haematopoietic stem cells we show that Nf1 gene 
loss, by itself, is sufficient to produce the myeloproliferative symptoms 
associated with human JCML. We also provide evidence to indicate that Nf1 gene 
loss induces myeloproliferative disease through a Ras-mediated hypersensitivity 
to granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Finally, we 
describe a genetic screen for identifying genes that cooperate with Nf1 gene 
loss during progression to acute myeloid leukaemia.
