The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene product, neurofibromin, is known to 
interact with Ras, thereby negatively regulating its growth-promoting function. 
Although this is a well-established interaction, the discovery of other 
neurofibromin interacting partners could reveal new functional properties of 
this large protein. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis against a brain cDNA 
library, we identified a novel interaction between the amyloid precursor protein 
and the GTPase activating protein-related domain of neurofibromin. This 
interaction was further analyzed in human melanocytes and confirmed by 
immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies. In addition, we observed a 
colocalization of amyloid precursor protein and neurofibromin with melanosomes. 
Amyloid precursor protein has been proposed to function as a vesicle cargo 
receptor for the motor protein kinesin-1 in neurons. This colocalization of 
amyloid precursor protein and neurofibromin with melanosomes was lost in 
melanocytes obtained from normal skin of a NF1 patient. We suggest that a 
complex between amyloid precursor protein, neurofibromin, and melanosomes might 
be important in melanosome transport, which could shed a new light on the 
etiopathogenesis of pigment-cell-related manifestations in NF1.
