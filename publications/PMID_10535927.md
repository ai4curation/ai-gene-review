A wide range of processes in plants, including expression of certain genes, is 
regulated by endogenous circadian rhythms. The circadian clock-associated 1 
(CCA1) and the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) proteins have been shown to be 
closely associated with clock function in Arabidopsis thaliana. The protein 
kinase CK2 can interact with and phosphorylate CCA1, but its role in the 
regulation of the circadian clock remains unknown. Here we show that plants 
overexpressing CKB3, a regulatory subunit of CK2, display increased CK2 activity 
and shorter periods of rhythmic expression of CCA1 and LHY. CK2 is also able to 
interact with and phosphorylate LHY in vitro. Additionally, overexpression of 
CKB3 shortened the periods of four known circadian clock-controlled genes with 
different phase angles, demonstrating that many clock outputs are affected. This 
overexpression also reduced phytochrome induction of an Lhcb gene. Finally, we 
found that the photoperiodic flowering response, which is influenced by 
circadian rhythms, was diminished in the transgenic lines, and that the plants 
flowered earlier on both long-day and short-day photoperiods. These data 
demonstrate that CK2 is involved in regulation of the circadian clock in 
Arabidopsis.

Abstract

A wide range of processes in plants, including expression of certain genes, is regulated by endogenous circadian rhythms. The circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) and the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) proteins have been shown to be closely associated with clock function in Arabidopsis thaliana . The protein kinase CK2 can interact with and phosphorylate CCA1, but its role in the regulation of the circadian clock remains unknown. Here we show that plants overexpressing CKB3, a regulatory subunit of CK2, display increased CK2 activity and shorter periods of rhythmic expression of CCA1 and LHY . CK2 is also able to interact with and phosphorylate LHY in vitro . Additionally, overexpression of CKB3 shortened the periods of four known circadian clock-controlled genes with different phase angles, demonstrating that many clock outputs are affected. This overexpression also reduced phytochrome induction of an Lhcb gene. Finally, we found that the photoperiodic flowering response, which is influenced by circadian rhythms, was diminished in the transgenic lines, and that the plants flowered earlier on both long-day and short-day photoperiods. These data demonstrate that CK2 is involved in regulation of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis .

Discussion

Overexpression of CKB3 increased the CK2 activity in plants by about 1.7-fold relative to wild type. This outcome is similar to that seen in other organisms ( 27 , 31 ). The increase observed for the enzyme activity was much less than the increase in CKB3 RNA. One possible explanation for this observation is that there may be limited amounts of free α-subunits that can form holoenzyme with the additional CKB3.

The CKB3 -ox lines showed shorter periods of circadian oscillations of CCA1 and LHY RNAs as well as those of several output genes. These findings demonstrate that CK2 is involved in regulating the endogenous circadian clock. Additionally, the timing of flowering was altered. We have also observed that the circadian regulation of leaf movement is affected in the CKB3 -ox lines (unpublished data). Interestingly, although CK2 can phosphorylate a wide range of substrates, overexpression of CKB3 did not affect other visible aspects of growth and development of the plants. It is possible that components of the circadian clock are more sensitive to increased CK2 phosphorylation than other CK2 substrates, or perhaps CKB3 interacts with clock components in a specific fashion. Further work will be necessary to understand fully the role of CK2 and its subunits in the circadian rhythms of plants.

Some of the characteristics of the CKB3 -ox lines are similar to those of toc1 mutant plants, which also exhibit shorter periods of output gene expression and a reduced photoperiodic flowering response but normal hypocotyl elongation ( 14 , 15 ). Two classes of mutants that affect the input pathway, det1 and plants overexpressing phyA or phyB , also have a short-period phenotype ( 32 , 33 ). However, morphological phenotypes that are associated with these lines are absent in the CKB3 -ox and toc1 plants. Furthermore, in contrast to the higher Lhcb1*1 expression seen in det1 and the phyA / B -overexpressing lines, induction of Lhcb1*1 in CKB3 -ox plants by brief red illumination was reduced compared with wild type. We conclude that CK2 affects components that are part of the central oscillator itself or closely associated with it.

Our finding that CK2 can interact with and phosphorylate both CCA1 and LHY in vitro is consistent with the idea that CK2 might modulate the circadian clock by direct interaction with and/or phosphorylation of the CCA1 and LHY proteins. Although we have found that in vitro the phosphorylation of CCA1 itself did not affect its binding to the Lhcb1*3 gene ( 21 ), we do not know what the consequences of CCA1 and/or LHY phosphorylation might be in vivo . In both Drosophila and Neurospora , phosphorylation of clock components is thought to play a role in their turnover ( 4 – 8 ). It is of interest that a clock gene of Drosophila , double-time ( dbt ), was recently cloned and found to encode a protein closely related to human casein kinase Iɛ. The dbt protein can interact with the clock component PER both in vitro and in Drosophila cells ( 34 ). dbt mutations alter the periods of behavioral rhythms and molecular oscillations of clock components PER and TIM and also affect PER phosphorylation and stability ( 35 ). Although both casein kinase Iɛ and CK2 are Ser/Thr kinases that do not require a second messenger as a cofactor, these kinases are structurally dissimilar, suggesting that these enzymes did not evolve from a common ancestral enzyme.

The evidence presented here leads us to suggest that direct interaction with and/or phosphorylation by CK2 might affect the activity, stability, and/or cellular localization of CCA1 and LHY. The fact that the periods of LHY and several output genes were also shortened in a CCA1 -null line ( 20 ) is consistent with this idea. We cannot exclude the possibility that clock components other than or in addition to CCA1 and LHY are affected. It is also possible that overexpression of CKB3 may sequester a proportion of the endogenous CCA1 and LHY, and that effects caused by CKB3 overexpression might be independent of other CK2 subunits and of CK2 catalytic activity. However, the results presented here clearly demonstrate that, whatever its interacting partners and/or substrates are in vivo , the protein kinase CK2 is involved in the function of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis .
