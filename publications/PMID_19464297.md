Three evolutionarily conserved proteins, Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1, form a 
heterotrimeric 9-1-1 complex that plays critical roles in cellular responses to 
DNA damage by activating checkpoints and by recruiting DNA repair enzymes to DNA 
lesions. We have determined the crystal structure of the human Rad9 (residues 
1-272)-Hus1-Rad1 complex at 2.5 A resolution. The 9(1-272)-1-1 complex forms a 
closed ring, with each subunit having a similar structure. Despite its high 
level of similarity to proliferating cell nucleus antigen in terms of overall 
structure, the 9(1-272)-1-1 complex exhibits notable differences in local 
structures, including interdomain connecting loops, H2 and H3 helices, and loops 
in the vicinity of the helices of each subunit. These local structural 
variations provide several unique features to the 9-1-1 heterotrimeric 
complex-including structures of intermolecular interfaces and the inner surface 
around the central hole, and different electrostatic potentials at and near the 
interdomain connecting loops of each 9-1-1 subunit-compared to the proliferating 
cell nucleus antigen trimer. We propose that these structural features allow the 
9-1-1 complex to bind to a damaged DNA during checkpoint control and to serve as 
a platform for base excision repair. We also show that the 9(1-272)-1-1 complex, 
but not the full-length 9-1-1 complex, forms a stable complex with the 5' 
recessed DNA, suggesting that the C-terminal tail of Rad9 is involved in the 
regulation of the 9-1-1 complex in DNA binding.
