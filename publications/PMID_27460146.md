Vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35) is a retromer complex component regulating 
membrane protein trafficking and retrieval. Mutations or dysfunction of VPS35 
have been linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), which is pathologically 
characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in brain substantia nigra region. 
Dopamine plays a key role in regulating various brain physiological functions by 
binding to its receptors and triggering their endocytosis and signaling 
pathways. However, it is unclear whether there is a link between VPS35 and 
dopamine signaling in PD. Herein, we found that VPS35 interacted with dopamine 
receptor D1 (DRD1). Notably, overexpression and downregulation of VPS35 
increased and decreased steady-state cell surface levels of DRD1 and 
phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and 
extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) that are important dopamine 
signaling effectors, respectively. In addition, overexpression of VPS35 promoted 
cell surface recycling of endocytic DRD1. Furthermore, downregulation of VPS35 
abolished dopamine-induced CREB/ERK phosphorylation. More importantly, although 
the PD-associated VPS35 mutant VPS35 (D620N) still interacted with DRD1, its 
expression did not affect cell surface recycling of DRD1 and phosphorylation of 
CREB/ERK nor rescue the reduction of CREB/ERK phosphorylation caused by VPS35 
downregulation. These results demonstrate that VPS35 regulates DRD1 trafficking 
and DRD1-mediated dopamine signaling pathway, and that the PD-associated VPS35 
(D620N) mutant loses such functions, providing a novel molecular mechanism 
underlying PD pathogenesis.
