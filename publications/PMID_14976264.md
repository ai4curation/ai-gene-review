The Sir2 deacetylase modulates organismal life-span in various species. However, 
the molecular mechanisms by which Sir2 increases longevity are largely unknown. 
We show that in mammalian cells, the Sir2 homolog SIRT1 appears to control the 
cellular response to stress by regulating the FOXO family of Forkhead 
transcription factors, a family of proteins that function as sensors of the 
insulin signaling pathway and as regulators of organismal longevity. SIRT1 and 
the FOXO transcription factor FOXO3 formed a complex in cells in response to 
oxidative stress, and SIRT1 deacetylated FOXO3 in vitro and within cells. SIRT1 
had a dual effect on FOXO3 function: SIRT1 increased FOXO3's ability to induce 
cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibited FOXO3's 
ability to induce cell death. Thus, one way in which members of the Sir2 family 
of proteins may increase organismal longevity is by tipping FOXO-dependent 
responses away from apoptosis and toward stress resistance.
