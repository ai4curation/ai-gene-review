OBJECTIVE: Clinical and laboratory studies have demonstrated that platelets 
become hyperactive and prothrombotic in conditions of inflammation. We have 
previously shown that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 forms a 
complex with soluble IL-6 receptor α (sIL-6Rα) to prime platelets for activation 
by subthreshold concentrations of collagen. Upon being stimulated with collagen, 
the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 
(STAT) 3 in platelets is phosphorylated and dimerized to act as a protein 
scaffold to facilitate the catalytic action between the kinase Syk and the 
substrate phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) in collagen-induced signaling. However, it 
remains unknown how collagen induces phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT3.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted complementary in vitro experiments to show 
that the IL-6 receptor subunit glycoprotein 130 (GP130) was in physical 
proximity to the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI in membrane lipid rafts 
of platelets. This proximity allows collagen to induce STAT3 activation and 
dimerization, and the IL-6-sIL-6Rα complex to activate the kinase Syk and the 
substrate PLCγ2 in the GPVI signal pathway, resulting in an enhanced platelet 
response to collagen. Disrupting lipid rafts or blocking GP130-Janus tyrosine 
kinase (JAK)-STAT3 signaling abolished the cross-activation and reduced platelet 
reactivity to collagen.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate cross-talk between collagen and IL-6 
signal pathways. This cross-talk could potentially provide a novel mechanism for 
inflammation-induced platelet hyperactivity, so the IL-6-GP130-JAK-STAT3 pathway 
has been identified as a potential target to block this hyperactivity.
