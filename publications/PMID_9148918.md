SHP-1 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase associated with inhibition of activation 
pathways in hematopoietic cells. The catalytic activity of SHP-1 is regulated by 
its two SH2 (Src homology 2) domains; phosphotyrosine peptides that bind to the 
SH2 domains activate SHP-1. The consensus sequence (I/V)XYXX(L/V) is present in 
the cytoplasmic tails of several lymphocyte receptors that interact with the 
second SH2 domain of SHP-1. In several of these receptors, there are two or 
three occurrences of the motif. Here we show that the conserved hydrophobic 
amino acid preceding the phosphotyrosine is critical for binding to and 
activation of SHP-1 by peptides corresponding to sequences from killer cell 
inhibitory receptors. The interaction of most SH2 domains with phosphopeptides 
requires only the phosphotyrosine and the three residues downstream of the 
tyrosine. In contrast, the shortest peptide able to bind or activate SHP-1 also 
included the two residues upstream of the phosphotyrosine. A biphosphopeptide 
corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of a killer cell inhibitory receptor with 
the potential to interact simultaneously with both SH2 domains of SHP-1 was the 
most potent activator of SHP-1. The hydrophobic residue upstream of the tyrosine 
was also critical in the context of the biphosphopeptide. The contribution of a 
hydrophobic amino acid two residues upstream of the tyrosine in the 
SHP-1-binding motif may be an important feature that distinguishes inhibitory 
receptors from those that provide activation signals.
