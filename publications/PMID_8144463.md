In a previous paper, we reported identification of the 5' part of hprA of 
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, which encodes the serine cycle enzyme 
hydroxypyruvate reductase (L. V. Chistoserdova and M. E. Lidstrom, J. Bacteriol. 
174:71-77, 1992). Here we present the complete sequence of hprA and partial 
sequence of genes adjacent to hprA. Upstream of hprA, the 3' part of an open 
reading frame was discovered, separated from hprA by 263 bp. This open reading 
frame was identified as the gene encoding another serine cycle enzyme, serine 
glyoxylate aminotransferase (sgaA). Cells containing an insertion mutation into 
sgaA were unable to grow on C1 compounds, demonstrating that the gene is 
required for C1 metabolism. Sequencing downstream of hprA has revealed the 
presence of another open reading frame (mtdA), which is probably cotranscribed 
with hprA. This open reading frame was identified as the gene required for the 
synthesis of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. Our data suggest that 
this enzyme plays an integral role in methylotrophic metabolism in M. extorquens 
AM1, either in formaldehyde oxidation or as part of the serine cycle.

Abstract

In a previous paper, we reported identification of the 5' part of hprA of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, which encodes the serine cycle enzyme hydroxypyruvate reductase (L. V. Chistoserdova and M. E. Lidstrom, J. Bacteriol. 174:71-77, 1992). Here we present the complete sequence of hprA and partial sequence of genes adjacent to hprA. Upstream of hprA, the 3' part of an open reading frame was discovered, separated from hprA by 263 bp. This open reading frame was identified as the gene encoding another serine cycle enzyme, serine glyoxylate aminotransferase (sgaA). Cells containing an insertion mutation into sgaA were unable to grow on C1 compounds, demonstrating that the gene is required for C1 metabolism. Sequencing downstream of hprA has revealed the presence of another open reading frame (mtdA), which is probably cotranscribed with hprA. This open reading frame was identified as the gene required for the synthesis of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. Our data suggest that this enzyme plays an integral role in methylotrophic metabolism in M. extorquens AM1, either in formaldehyde oxidation or as part of the serine cycle.
