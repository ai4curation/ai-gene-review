αA- and αB-crystallins are small heat shock proteins that bind thermodynamically 
destabilized proteins thereby inhibiting their aggregation. Highly expressed in 
the mammalian lens, the α-crystallins have been postulated to play a critical 
role in the maintenance of lens optical properties by sequestering age-damaged 
proteins prone to aggregation as well as through a multitude of roles in lens 
epithelial cells. Here, we have examined the role of α-crystallins in the 
development of the vertebrate zebrafish lens. For this purpose, we have carried 
out morpholino-mediated knockdown of αA-, αBa- and αBb-crystallin and 
characterized the gross morphology of the lens. We observed lens abnormalities, 
including increased reflectance intensity, as a consequence of the interference 
with expression of these proteins. These abnormalities were less frequent in 
transgenic zebrafish embryos expressing rat αA-crystallin suggesting a specific 
role of α-crystallins in embryonic lens development. To extend and confirm these 
findings, we generated an αA-crystallin knockout zebrafish line. A more 
consistent and severe lens phenotype was evident in maternal/zygotic 
αA-crystallin mutants compared to those observed by morpholino knockdown. The 
penetrance of the lens phenotype was reduced by transgenic expression of rat 
αA-crystallin and its severity was attenuated by maternal αA-crystallin 
expression. These findings demonstrate that the role of α-crystallins in lens 
development is conserved from mammals to zebrafish and set the stage for using 
the embryonic lens as a model system to test mechanistic aspects of α-crystallin 
chaperone activity and to develop strategies to fine-tune protein-protein 
interactions in aging and cataracts.
