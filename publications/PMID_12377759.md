Telomere length maintenance, an activity essential for chromosome stability and 
genome integrity, is regulated by telomerase- and telomere-associated factors. 
The DNA repair protein Ku (a heterodimer of Ku70 and Ku80 subunits) associates 
with mammalian telomeres and contributes to telomere maintenance. Here, we 
analyzed the physical association of Ku with human telomerase both in vivo and 
in vitro. Antibodies specific to human Ku proteins precipitated human telomerase 
in extracts from tumor cells, as well as from telomerase-immortalized normal 
cells, regardless of the presence of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic 
subunit. The same Ku antibodies also precipitated in vitro reconstituted 
telomerase, suggesting that this association does not require telomeric DNA. 
Moreover, Ku associated with the in vitro translated catalytic subunit of 
telomerase (hTERT) in the absence of telomerase RNA (hTR) or telomeric DNA. The 
results presented here are the first to report that Ku associates with hTERT, 
and this interaction may function to regulate the access of telomerase to 
telomeric DNA ends.
