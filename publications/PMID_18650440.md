Fe65L1, a member of the Fe65 family, is an adaptor protein that interacts with 
the cytoplasmic domain of Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its 
C-terminal phosphotyrosine interaction/phosphotyrosine binding (PID/PTB) domain. 
In the present study, the solution structures of the C-terminal PID domain of 
mouse Fe65L1, alone and in complex with a 32-mer peptide 
(DAAVTPEERHLSKMQQNGYENPTYKFFEQMQN) derived from the cytoplasmic domain of APP, 
were determined using NMR spectroscopy. The C-terminal PID domain of Fe65L1 
alone exhibits a canonical PID/PTB fold, whereas the complex structure reveals a 
novel mode of peptide binding. In the complex structure, the NPTY motif forms a 
type-I beta-turn, and the residues immediately N-terminal to the NPTY motif form 
an antiparallel beta-sheet with the beta5 strand of the PID domain, the binding 
mode typically observed in the PID/PTB.peptide complex. On the other hand, the 
N-terminal region of the peptide forms a 2.5-turn alpha-helix and interacts 
extensively with the C-terminal alpha-helix and the peripheral regions of the 
PID domain, representing a novel mode of peptide binding that has not been 
reported previously for the PID/PTB.peptide complex. The indispensability of the 
N-terminal region of the peptide for the high affinity of the PID-peptide 
interaction is consistent with NMR titration and isothermal calorimetry data. 
The extensive binding features of the PID domain of Fe65L1 with the cytoplasmic 
domain of APP provide a framework for further understanding of the function, 
trafficking, and processing of APP modulated by adapter proteins.
