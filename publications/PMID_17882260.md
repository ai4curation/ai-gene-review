The assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) in yeast mitochondria is shown to be 
dependent on a new assembly factor designated Coa1 that associates with the 
mitochondrial inner membrane. Translation of the mitochondrial-encoded subunits 
of CcO occurs normally in coa1Delta cells, but these subunits fail to 
accumulate. The respiratory defect in coa1Delta cells is suppressed by high-copy 
MSS51, MDJ1 and COX10. Mss51 functions in Cox1 translation and elongation, 
whereas Cox10 participates in the biosynthesis of heme a, a key cofactor of CcO. 
Respiration in coa1Delta and shy1Delta cells is enhanced when Mss51 and Cox10 
are coexpressed. Shy1 has been implicated in formation of the heme a3-Cu(B) site 
in Cox1. The interaction between Coa1 and Cox1, and the physical and genetic 
interactions between Coa1 and Mss51, Shy1 and Cox14 suggest that Coa1 
coordinates the transition of newly synthesized Cox1 from the Mss51:Cox14 
complex to the heme a cofactor insertion involving Shy1. coa1Delta cells also 
display a mitochondrial copper defect suggesting that Coa1 may have a direct 
link to copper metallation of CcO.
