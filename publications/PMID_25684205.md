The small Rho GTPase RAC1 is an essential regulator of cellular signaling that 
controls actin rearrangements and cell motility. Here, we identify a novel CUL3 
RING ubiquitin ligase complex, containing the substrate adaptors KBTBD6 and 
KBTBD7, that mediates ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of TIAM1, a 
RAC1-specific GEF. Increasing the abundance of TIAM1 by depletion of KBTBD6 
and/or KBTBD7 leads to elevated RAC1 activity, changes in actin morphology, loss 
of focal adhesions, reduced proliferation, and enhanced invasion. KBTBD6 and 
KBTBD7 employ ATG8 family-interacting motifs to bind preferentially to GABARAP 
proteins. Surprisingly, ubiquitylation and degradation of TIAM1 
by CUL3(KBTBD6/KBTBD7) depends on its binding to GABARAP proteins. Our study 
reveals that recruitment of CUL3(KBTBD6/KBTBD7) to GABARAP-containing vesicles 
regulates the abundance of membrane-associated TIAM1 and subsequently spatially 
restricted RAC1 signaling. Besides their role in autophagy and trafficking, we 
uncovered a previously unknown function of GABARAP proteins as 
membrane-localized signaling scaffolds.
