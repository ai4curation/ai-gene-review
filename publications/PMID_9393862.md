Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a homodimeric hormone that induces 
proliferation of endothelial cells through binding to the kinase domain receptor 
and the Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor (Flt-1), the extracellular portions of 
which consist of seven immunoglobulin domains. We show that the second and third 
domains of Flt-1 are necessary and sufficient for binding VEGF with near-native 
affinity, and that domain 2 alone binds only 60-fold less tightly than 
wild-type. The crystal structure of the complex between VEGF and the second 
domain of Flt-1 shows domain 2 in a predominantly hydrophobic interaction with 
the "poles" of the VEGF dimer. Based on this structure and on mutational data, 
we present a model of VEGF bound to the first four domains of Flt-1.
