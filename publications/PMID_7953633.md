To explore the role of the protooncogene bcl-2 in the prevention of programmed 
cell death in the nervous system, we investigated its expression in mouse neural 
cells in primary culture. The 26 kDa protein product, Bcl-2, was detected by 
immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting in cultured neurons, astrocytes and 
oligodendrocytes, but the immunoreactivity of microglial cells was not 
detectable by immunoblotting. The subcellular distribution of Bcl-2 was similar 
between in vivo (brain) and in vitro (culture) and between cultured neurons and 
astrocytes, while the content was higher in astrocytes than in neurons. The 
substantial expression of bcl-2 in primary cultured brain cells suggests that it 
has some physiological control in the brain over programmed cell death, which 
may be exerted not only in neurons but also in some glial cells such as 
astrocytes.
