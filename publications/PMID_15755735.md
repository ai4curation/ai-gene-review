Macroautophagy is an intracellular degradation system for the majority of 
proteins and some organelles that is conserved in all eukaryotic species. The 
precise role of autophagy in mammalian development and potential involvement in 
disease remain to be discerned. Yeast Atg9p is the first integral membrane 
protein shown to be essential for the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) 
pathway and autophagy, whereas its mammalian functional orthologue has yet to be 
identified. We have identified two human genes homologous to yeast Atg9p and 
designated these as APG9L1 and APG9L2. We have previously identified APG9L2 as 
NOS3AS, which participates in the post-transcriptional regulation of the 
endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS3) gene on chromosome 7 through its 
antisense overlap. In human adult tissues, APG9L1 was ubiquitously expressed, 
whereas APG9L2 was highly expressed in placenta (trophoblast cells) and 
pituitary gland. In transient transfection assays we found that both proteins 
were primarily localized to the perinuclear region and also scattered throughout 
the cytosol as dots, a subset of which colocalized with an 
autophagosome-specific marker LC3 under starvation conditions. Finally, by the 
small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of APG9L1 in HeLa cells, we 
demonstrated that APG9L1 is essential for starvation-induced autophagosome 
formation. In addition, APG9L2 can functionally complement APG9L1 in this 
process. These results, taken together with those of phylogenetic and sequence 
analyses, suggest that both APG9L1 and APG9L2 are functionally orthologous to 
the yATG9 in autophagosome formation. Moreover, APG9L2 is a vertebrate-specific 
gene that may have gained critical roles in mammalian-specific developmental 
events, such as placentation, through rapid evolution.
