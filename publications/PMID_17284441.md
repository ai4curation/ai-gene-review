Estrogens and androgens exert many biological effects that do not require 
interactions of their receptors with chromosomal DNA. However, it has been a 
long-standing question how the sex steroid receptors provoke signal transduction 
outside the nucleus. Here we have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
directs sex-specific steroid signaling through Src activation. We have revealed 
that estrogen (E2)-induced Src activation takes place in, not only plasma, but 
also endomembranes. This was found ascribed to the existence of EGF and the 
occurrence of EGF receptor (EGFR)-involved endocytosis of estrogen receptor 
together with Src. EGFR, estrogen receptor, and Src were found to form a complex 
upon E2 stimulation. The cell growth of breast cancer-derived MCF-7 cells was 
found to remarkably increase through the above EGF-involved estrogen-signaling 
process. In contrast, the androgen 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone-induced Src 
activation occurs only in the plasma membrane free from the interaction of EGFR 
with androgen receptor, irrespective of EGF. The cell growth occurred only 
moderately as a result. The spatial difference in Src activation between E2 and 
5alpha-dihydrotestosterone may be responsible for the different extent of 
observed cell growth.
