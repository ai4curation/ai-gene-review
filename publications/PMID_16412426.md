Assembly of the active site of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzymes involves a 
multi-step pathway and the coordinated activity of many accessory proteins. To 
analyze complex formation between these factors in Escherichia coli, they were 
genomically tagged and native multi-protein complexes were isolated. This method 
validated multiple interactions reported in separate studies from several 
organisms and defined a new complex containing the putative chaperone HybG and 
the large subunit of hydrogenase 1 or 2. The complex also includes HypE and 
HypD, which interact with each other before joining the larger complex.
