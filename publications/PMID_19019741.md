BACKGROUND: CFTR contributes to HCO(3)(-) transport in epithelial cells both 
directly (by HCO(3)(-) permeation through the channel) and indirectly (by 
regulating Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange proteins). While loss of HCO(3)(-) transport 
is highly relevant to cystic fibrosis, the relative importance of direct and 
indirect HCO(3)(-) transport it is currently unknown.
METHODS: Patch clamp recordings from membrane patches excised from cells 
heterologously expressing wild type and mutant forms of human CFTR were used to 
isolate directly CFTR-mediated HCO(3)(-) transport and characterize its 
functional properties.
RESULTS: The permeability of HCO(3)(-) was approximately 25% that of Cl(-) and 
was invariable under all ionic conditions studied. CFTR-mediated HCO(3)(-) 
currents were inhibited by open channel blockers DNDS, glibenclamide and 
suramin, and these inhibitions were affected by mutations within the channel 
pore. Cystic fibrosis mutations previously associated with disrupted cellular 
HCO(3)(-) transport did not affect direct HCO(3)(-) permeability.
CONCLUSIONS: Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) share a common transport pathway in CFTR, and 
selectivity between Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) is independent of ionic conditions. The 
mechanism of transport is therefore effectively identical for both ions. We 
suggest that mutations in CFTR that cause cystic fibrosis by selectively 
disrupting HCO(3)(-) transport do not impair direct CFTR-mediated HCO(3)(-) 
transport, but may predominantly alter CFTR regulation of other HCO(3)(-) 
transport pathways.
