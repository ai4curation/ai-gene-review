Proteins with intrinsically disordered domains are implicated in a vast range of 
biological processes, especially in cell signaling and regulation. Having solved 
the quaternary structure of the folded domains in the tumor suppressor p53 by a 
multidisciplinary approach, we have now determined the average ensemble 
structure of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain 
(TAD) by using residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) from NMR spectroscopy and 
small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Remarkably, not only were we able to 
measure RDCs of the isolated TAD, but we were also able to do so for the TAD in 
both the full-length tetrameric p53 protein and in its complex with a specific 
DNA response element. We determined the orientation of the TAD ensemble relative 
to the core domain, found that the TAD was stiffer in the proline-rich region 
(residues 64-92), which has a tendency to adopt a polyproline II (PPII) 
structure, and projected the TAD away from the core. We located the TAD in SAXS 
experiments on a complex between tetrameric p53 and four Taz2 domains that bind 
tightly to the TAD (residues 1-57) and acted as "reporters." The p53-Taz2 
complex was an extended cross-shaped structure. The quality of the SAXS data 
enabled us to model the disordered termini and the folded domains in the complex 
with DNA. The core domains enveloped the response element in the center of the 
molecule, with the Taz2-bound TADs projecting outward from the core.

Abstract

Proteins with intrinsically disordered domains are implicated in a vast range of biological processes, especially in cell signaling and regulation. Having solved the quaternary structure of the folded domains in the tumor suppressor p53 by a multidisciplinary approach, we have now determined the average ensemble structure of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) by using residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) from NMR spectroscopy and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Remarkably, not only were we able to measure RDCs of the isolated TAD, but we were also able to do so for the TAD in both the full-length tetrameric p53 protein and in its complex with a specific DNA response element. We determined the orientation of the TAD ensemble relative to the core domain, found that the TAD was stiffer in the proline-rich region (residues 64–92), which has a tendency to adopt a polyproline II (PPII) structure, and projected the TAD away from the core. We located the TAD in SAXS experiments on a complex between tetrameric p53 and four Taz2 domains that bind tightly to the TAD (residues 1–57) and acted as “reporters.” The p53-Taz2 complex was an extended cross-shaped structure. The quality of the SAXS data enabled us to model the disordered termini and the folded domains in the complex with DNA. The core domains enveloped the response element in the center of the molecule, with the Taz2-bound TADs projecting outward from the core.

Conclusions

The inherent flexibility of unfolded protein domains requires the development of new approaches to characterize their behavior in terms of rapidly interconverting conformational ensembles. By using RDCs, in combination with SAXS and MD simulation, we were able to identify differential flexibility in the N-terminal unfolded domain of p53. The PRR, attached to the folded core domain, exhibits enhanced stiffness relative to the TAD, projecting the TAD away from the surface of the protein, and supporting previous suggestions based on mutagenesis, that the domain plays a predominantly structural role ( 33 ). In the TAD, where chain flexibility is higher overall, we were able to identify the presence of a single helix turn, populated to ≈30%, consistent with earlier identification of a nascent helix that becomes fully helical on interaction with MDM2 ( 17 , 18 ). Finally, the dynamic properties of the unfolded chain allow the measurement of RDCs from this region in the free full-length protein and in complex with DNA. In combination with previous SAXS and EM data, these data allow us to propose a residue resolution model of the full conformational sampling of flp53–DNA. The results indicated that local conformational sampling of the N-terminal domain is remarkably similar in both full-length p53 and in isolation, and substantiate previous suggestions that, although flp53–DNA is more compact and relatively rigid, the quaternary structure of the molecule is more flexible in the absence of DNA. By using a protein domain, Taz2, that binds to the TAD tightly, we could visualize the positions of the TAD-bound domain relative to the folded domains of p53.

Methods

Full details are in the SI Text . Proteins were expressed as in refs. 11 and 34 – 36 . All protein samples were dialyzed into 25 mM Bis-Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.8, containing 10% 2 H 2 O for NMR studies. Gels were used for RDC measurements as in ref. 37 , and spectra were recorded at 20°C by using standard Bruker pulse sequences and methods described in refs. 38 – 42 . The SAXS data were collected at the X33 beamline at EMBL/DESY, Hamburg ( 43 ), following standard procedures. The p53(1–93) ranged from 2 to 8.6 mg/ml in 25 mM phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol. Data were processed by using PRIMUS ( 44 ). Further analysis and modeling were performed by using the ATSAS package ( 45 ) with programs CRYSOL ( 46 ), SASREF, and BUNCH ( 47 ). Side chains were added to the conformers generated by the FM method in the unfolded domains by using the SCCOMP program ( 48 ). Accelerated molecular dynamic (AMD) simulations ( 49 , 50 ) used an in-house modified version of the sander module in AMBER8 ( 51 ).
