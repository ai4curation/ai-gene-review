Human plasma membrane-associated sialidase (NEU3), a key enzyme for ganglioside 
degradation, is markedly upregulated in human cancers, leading to apoptosis 
suppression. To define molecular mechanisms and the possible target for NEU3, 
its encoding gene was silenced by small interference RNA (siRNA) or 
overexpressed in human cells. NEU3 siRNA-induced apoptosis with no special 
stimuli in HeLa cells, accompanied with decreased Bcl-xL and increased mda7 and 
GM3 synthase mRNA levels, whereas overexpression resulted in the opposite. 
Carcinoma HT-29 and MCF-7 cells appeared to be similarly affected, but normal 
cell lines demonstrated no significant changes. NEU3 siRNA was found to inhibit 
and NEU3 overexpression to stimulate Ras activation with consequent influence on 
extracellular signal-regulated kinases and Akt. Ras activation by NEU3 was 
abrogated by PP2 (src inhibitor) or AG1478 (epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) inhibitor), and NEU3 actually enhanced EGF-stimulated 
tyrosine-phosphorylation of EGFR, suggesting that the upstream targets might be 
tyrosine kinases including src and EGFR, and the subsequent stimulation of Ras 
cascade leads to the inhibition of cell apoptosis. Glycolipid changes observed 
seemed to be one of the causes of the cell effects. NEU3 may thus be an 
essential gene for cancer cell survival and siRNAs targeting this protein could 
have utility for gene-based therapy of human cancers.
