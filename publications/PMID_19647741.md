Serine residues phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) in the shortest isoform 
of human tau protein (tau3) were sequentially replaced by alanine and 
interaction of phosphorylated tau3 and its mutants with 14-3-3 was investigated. 
Mutation S156A slightly decreased interaction of phosphorylated tau3 with 
14-3-3. Double mutations S156A/S267A and especially S156A/S235A, strongly 
inhibited interaction of phosphorylated tau3 with 14-3-3. Thus, two sites 
located in the Pro-rich region and in the pseudo repeats of tau3 are involved in 
phosphorylation-dependent interaction of tau3 with 14-3-3. The state of tau3 
phosphorylation affects the mode of 14-3-3 binding and by this means might 
modify tau filament formation.
