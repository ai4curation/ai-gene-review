The activation of cochlear progenitor cells is a promising approach for hair 
cell (HC) regeneration and hearing recovery. The mechanisms underlying the 
initiation of proliferation of postnatal cochlear progenitor cells and their 
transdifferentiation to HCs remain to be determined. We show that Notch 
inhibition initiates proliferation of supporting cells (SCs) and mitotic 
regeneration of HCs in neonatal mouse cochlea in vivo and in vitro. Through 
lineage tracing, we identify that a majority of the proliferating SCs and 
mitotic-generated HCs induced by Notch inhibition are derived from the 
Wnt-responsive leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 
(Lgr5(+)) progenitor cells. We demonstrate that Notch inhibition removes the 
brakes on the canonical Wnt signaling and promotes Lgr5(+) progenitor cells to 
mitotically generate new HCs. Our study reveals a new function of Notch 
signaling in limiting proliferation and regeneration potential of postnatal 
cochlear progenitor cells, and provides a new route to regenerate HCs from 
progenitor cells by interrupting the interaction between the Notch and Wnt 
pathways.

Abstract

The activation of cochlear progenitor cells is a promising approach for hair cell (HC) regeneration and hearing recovery. The mechanisms underlying the initiation of proliferation of postnatal cochlear progenitor cells and their transdifferentiation to HCs remain to be determined. We show that Notch inhibition initiates proliferation of supporting cells (SCs) and mitotic regeneration of HCs in neonatal mouse cochlea in vivo and in vitro. Through lineage tracing, we identify that a majority of the proliferating SCs and mitotic-generated HCs induced by Notch inhibition are derived from the Wnt-responsive leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5 + ) progenitor cells. We demonstrate that Notch inhibition removes the brakes on the canonical Wnt signaling and promotes Lgr5 + progenitor cells to mitotically generate new HCs. Our study reveals a new function of Notch signaling in limiting proliferation and regeneration potential of postnatal cochlear progenitor cells, and provides a new route to regenerate HCs from progenitor cells by interrupting the interaction between the Notch and Wnt pathways.

Discussion

In mammals, limited mitotic regeneration of HCs has been detected in the vestibular sensory epithelia and cochlea of newborn mice ( 4 â€“ 8 , 12 ), Atoh1 acts as one of the most important factors in the fate decision of HCs ( 40 , 41 ), and Notch inhibition is known to promote SCs to produce nonmitotic generation of HCs by suppressing lateral inhibition and up-regulating Atoh1 in SCs. However, the role of Notch signaling in regulating SC proliferation and the mitotic generation of HC is unknown. Although Wnt activation leads to HC regeneration, the interaction between the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways in proliferation and HC regeneration remains to be determined in the postnatal mice cochlea. In this study, we unveil a new role of Notch signaling in regulating the proliferation of SCs and mitotic generation of HCs in postnatal cochlear sensory epithelia in vivo and in vitro. We further demonstrate that Notch signaling conveys through the Wnt pathway that targets primarily the Lgr5 + SCs for proliferation and mitotic generation of HCs.
