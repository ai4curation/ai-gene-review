The fibronectin-binding proteins FnBPA and FnBPB are multifunctional adhesins 
than can also bind to fibrinogen and elastin. In this study, the N2N3 subdomains 
of region A of FnBPB were shown to bind fibrinogen with a similar affinity to 
those of FnBPA (2 μM). The binding site for FnBPB in fibrinogen was localized to 
the C-terminus of the γ-chain. Like clumping factor A, region A of FnBPB bound 
to the γ-chain of fibrinogen in a Ca(2+)-inhibitable manner. The deletion of 17 
residues from the C-terminus of domain N3 and the substitution of two residues 
in equivalent positions for crucial residues for fibrinogen binding in clumping 
factor A and FnBPA eliminated fibrinogen binding by FnBPB. This indicates that 
FnBPB binds fibrinogen by the dock-lock-latch mechanism. In contrast, the A 
domain of FnBPB bound fibronectin with K(D) = 2.5 μM despite lacking any of the 
known fibronectin-binding tandem repeats. A truncate lacking the C-terminal 17 
residues (latching peptide) bound fibronectin with the same affinity, suggesting 
that the FnBPB A domain binds fibronectin by a novel mechanism. The substitution 
of the two residues required for fibrinogen binding also resulted in a loss of 
fibronectin binding. This, combined with the observation that purified subdomain 
N3 bound fibronectin with a measurable, but reduced, K(D) of 20 μM, indicates 
that the type I modules of fibronectin bind to both the N2 and N3 subdomains. 
The fibronectin-binding ability of the FnBPB A domain was also functional when 
the protein was expressed on and anchored to the surface of staphylococcal 
cells, showing that it is not an artifact of recombinant protein expression.
