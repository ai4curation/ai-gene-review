A cytokine was identified that stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, 
and a complementary DNA clone encoding this new T cell growth factor was 
isolated. The cytokine, designated interleukin-15 (IL-15), is produced by a wide 
variety of cells and tissues and shares many biological properties with IL-2. 
Monoclonal antibodies to the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor inhibited the 
biological activity of IL-15, and IL-15 competed for binding with IL-2, 
indicating that IL-15 uses components of the IL-2 receptor.
