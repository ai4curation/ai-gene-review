Previous studies on the relationship between obesity and circulating 
insulin-like growth factor (IGF) hormones show inconsistent findings and have 
not considered the possibility of racial/ethnic-specific differences that may 
exist. We therefore examined the relationship between obesity status [as 
measured by body mass index (BMI)] and plasma levels of the IGF proteins, IGF-I, 
IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), and the molar ratio of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 in Whites, 
African Americans, Latinos, Japanese Americans, and Native Hawaiians from the 
ongoing Hawaii and Los Angeles Multiethnic Cohort Study. We measured plasma 
IGF-I and IGFBP-3 by ELISA in a random sample of 811 Multiethnic Cohort 
participants (53% male, age range = 47-82 at blood draw). In a multivariate 
regression of IGF-I levels, we found a statistically significant interaction 
between race/ethnicity and obesity status (P = 0.005). Plasma IGF-I levels 
declined with increasing BMI most dramatically in Latinos and Japanese. This 
decline was attenuated in Whites and absent in African-American and Native 
Hawaiian subjects. In Japanese, the quadratic term (BMI(2)) was statistically 
significant in a multivariate model (P = 0.002). In Latinos, the adjusted 
least-squares mean IGF-I levels in ng/mL for BMI < 25, 25 to 29.99, and >or=30 
were 184.6, 147.7, and 132.7, respectively. No interaction between 
race/ethnicity and BMI explained the plasma IGFBP-3 levels in these data. These 
results may help to resolve the uncertainty in the relationship between 
circulating IGF levels and obesity and highlight the potential importance of 
racial/ethnic-specific effects among these factors in explaining ethnic 
disparities in obesity-related cancers.
