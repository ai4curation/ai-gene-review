Ribosome biogenesis has been associated with regulation of cell growth and cell 
division, but the molecular mechanisms that integrate the effect of ribosome 
biogenesis on these processes in mammalian cells remain unknown. To study the 
effect of impaired ribosome functions in vivo, we conditionally deleted one or 
two alleles of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 gene in T cells in the mouse. While 
complete deletion of S6 abrogated T-cell development, hemizygous expression did 
not have any effect on T-cell maturation in the thymus, but inhibited the 
accumulation of T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, as a result of their 
decreased survival in the peripheral lymphoid organs. Additionally, TCR-mediated 
stimulation of S6-heterozygous T cells induced a normal increase in their size, 
but cell cycle progression was impaired. Genetic inactivation of p53 tumor 
suppressor rescued development of S6-homozygous null thymocytes and 
proliferative defect of S6-heterozygous T cells. These results demonstrate the 
existence of a p53-dependent checkpoint mechanism that senses changes in the 
fidelity of the translational machinery to prevent aberrant cell division or 
eliminate defective T cells in vivo. Failure to activate this checkpoint 
response could potentially lead to a development of pathological processes such 
as tumors and autoimmune diseases.

Abstract

Ribosome biogenesis has been associated with regulation of cell growth and cell division, but the molecular mechanisms that integrate the effect of ribosome biogenesis on these processes in mammalian cells remain unknown. To study the effect of impaired ribosome functions in vivo, we conditionally deleted one or two alleles of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 gene in T cells in the mouse. While complete deletion of S6 abrogated T-cell development, hemizygous expression did not have any effect on T-cell maturation in the thymus, but inhibited the accumulation of T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, as a result of their decreased survival in the peripheral lymphoid organs. Additionally, TCR-mediated stimulation of S6 -heterozygous T cells induced a normal increase in their size, but cell cycle progression was impaired. Genetic inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor rescued development of S6 -homozygous null thymocytes and proliferative defect of S6 -heterozygous T cells. These results demonstrate the existence of a p53-dependent checkpoint mechanism that senses changes in the fidelity of the translational machinery to prevent aberrant cell division or eliminate defective T cells in vivo. Failure to activate this checkpoint response could potentially lead to a development of pathological processes such as tumors and autoimmune diseases.

Discussion

In this study we conditionally deleted the S6 ribosomal protein gene in the thymus. Homozygous deletion of S6 induced a p53-dependent checkpoint response that abolished T-cell development. In contrast, heterozygous S6 deletion did not have any effect on T-cell development and TCR-stimulated cell growth response, but it decreased survival of T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs and inhibited TCR-mediated increases in T-cell numbers in a p53-dependent manner.
