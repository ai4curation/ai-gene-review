Nucleoporins build the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which, as sole gate for 
nuclear-cytoplasmic exchange, is of outmost importance for normal cell function. 
Defects in the process of nucleocytoplasmic transport or in its machinery have 
been frequently described in human diseases, such as cancer and 
neurodegenerative disorders, but only in a few cases of developmental disorders. 
Here we report biallelic mutations in the nucleoporin NUP88 as a novel cause of 
lethal fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) in two families. FADS 
comprises a spectrum of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders with 
congenital malformations related to impaired fetal movement. We show that 
genetic disruption of nup88 in zebrafish results in pleiotropic developmental 
defects reminiscent of those seen in affected human fetuses, including locomotor 
defects as well as defects at neuromuscular junctions. Phenotypic alterations 
become visible at distinct developmental stages, both in affected human fetuses 
and in zebrafish, whereas early stages of development are apparently normal. The 
zebrafish phenotypes caused by nup88 deficiency are rescued by expressing 
wild-type Nup88 but not the disease-linked mutant forms of Nup88. Furthermore, 
using human and mouse cell lines as well as immunohistochemistry on fetal muscle 
tissue, we demonstrate that NUP88 depletion affects rapsyn, a key regulator of 
the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. 
Together, our studies provide the first characterization of NUP88 in vertebrate 
development, expand our understanding of the molecular events causing FADS, and 
suggest that variants in NUP88 should be investigated in cases of FADS.
