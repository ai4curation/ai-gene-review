The epidermis constantly encounters invasions that disrupt its architecture, yet 
whether the epidermal immune system utilizes damaged structures as danger 
signals to activate self-defense is unclear. Here, we used a C. elegans 
epidermis model in which skin-penetrating infection or injury activates immune 
defense and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production. By systemically disrupting 
each architectural component, we found that only disturbance of the apical 
hemidesmosomes triggered an immune response and robust AMP expression. The 
epidermis recognized structural damage through hemidesmosomes associated with a 
STAT-like protein, whose disruption led to detachment of STA-2 molecules from 
hemidesmosomes and transcription of AMPs. This machinery enabled the epidermis 
to bypass certain signaling amplification and directly trigger AMP production 
when subjected to extensive architectural damage. Together, our findings uncover 
an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the epithelial barriers to detect 
danger and activate immune defense.
