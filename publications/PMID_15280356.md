X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of 
the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that is highly expressed during 
embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). In this report, we 
demonstrate that although XEDAR lacks a death domain, it nevertheless induces 
apoptosis in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. The apoptosis-inducing ability of 
XEDAR is dependent on the activation of caspase 8 and can be blocked by its 
genetic and pharmacological inhibitors. Although XEDAR-induced apoptosis can be 
blocked by dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein and FADD 
small interfering RNA, XEDAR does not directly bind to FADD, tumor necrosis 
factor receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, or RIP1. Instead, XEDAR 
signaling leads to the formation of a secondary complex containing FADD, caspase 
8, and caspase 10, which results in caspase activation. Thus, XEDAR belongs to a 
novel class of death receptors that lack a discernible death domain but are 
capable of activating apoptosis in a caspase 8- and FADD-dependent fashion. 
XEDAR may represent an early stage in the evolution of death receptors prior to 
the emergence of the death domain and may play a role in the induction of 
apoptosis during embryonic development and adult life.
