One third of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are characterized by the aberrant 
cytoplasmic localization of nucleophosmin (NPM) due to mutations within its 
putative nucleolar localization signal. NPM mutations are mutually exclusive 
with major AML-associated chromosome rearrangements and are frequently 
associated with a normal karyotype, suggesting that they are critical during 
leukemogenesis. The underlying molecular mechanisms are, however, unknown. NPM 
is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that has been implicated in several 
cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, centrosome duplication, cell 
cycle progression, and stress response. It has been recently shown that NPM is 
required for the stabilization and proper nucleolar localization of the tumor 
suppressor p19(Arf). We report here that the AML-associated NPM mutant localizes 
mainly in the cytoplasm due to an alteration of its nucleus-cytoplasmic 
shuttling equilibrium, forms a direct complex with p19(Arf), but is unable to 
protect it from degradation. Consequently, cells or leukemic blasts expressing 
the NPM mutant have low levels of cytoplasmic Arf. Furthermore, we show that 
expression of the NPM mutant reduces the ability of Arf to initiate a p53 
response and to induce cell cycle arrest. Inactivation of p19(Arf), a key 
regulator of the p53-dependent cellular response to oncogene expression, might 
therefore contribute to leukemogenesis in AMLs with mutated NPM.
