Abstract

The binding of integrin adhesion receptors to their extracellular matrix ligands controls cell morphology, movement, survival, and differentiation in various developmental, homeostatic, and disease processes. Here, we report a methodology to isolate complexes associated with integrin adhesion receptors, which, like other receptor-associated signaling complexes, have been refractory to proteomic analysis. Quantitative, comparative analyses of the proteomes of two receptor-ligand pairs, α 4 β 1 –VCAM-1 and α 5 β 1 –fibronectin, defined both core and receptor-specific components. Regulator of chromosome condensation-2 (RCC2) was detected in the α 5 β 1 –fibronectin signaling network at an intersection between the Rac1 and Arf6 sub-networks. RCC2 knockdown enhanced fibronectin-induced activation of both Rac1 and Arf6 and accelerated cell spreading, suggesting that RCC2 limits the signaling required for membrane protrusion and delivery. Dysregulation of Rac1 and Arf6 function by RCC2 knockdown also abolished persistent migration along fibronectin fibers, indicating a functional role for RCC2 in directional cell movement. This proteomics workflow now opens the way to further dissection and systems-level analyses of adhesion signaling.

INTRODUCTION

Multicellular existence relies on the engagement of integrin cell surface receptors with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and counter-receptors on adjacent cells. Integrins are a family of 24 αβ heterodimers that result from selective non-covalent associations of 18 α and 8 β subunits ( 1 , 2 ). All subunits comprise large extracellular and typically small cytoplasmic domains. The particular combination of extracellular domains determines ligand-binding specificity, the structural basis of which enables the family to be subdivided into four main classes ( 3 ). RGD-binding integrins, including all five α V integrins, two β 1 integrins (α 5 and α 8 ), and α IIb β 3 , share the ability to recognise ligands such as fibronectin (FN), vitronectin, and fibrinogen, which contain the RGD tripeptide motif. LDV-binding integrins α 4 β 1 , α 4 β 7 , α 9 β 1 , and the four members of the β 2 subfamily recognise active sites containing LDV-related sequences in ligands such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). A-domain-containing β 1 integrins (α 1 , α 2 , α 10 , and α 11 ) bind laminin and collagen, whereas the non-αA-domain-containing laminin-binding integrins, comprising three β 1 integrins (α 3 , α 6 , and α 7 ) and α 6 β 4 , are highly selective laminin receptors.

Integrin-ligand binding controls a diverse range of cellular functions in both health and disease and is orchestrated by a combination of membrane-associated signaling complexes and mechanosensitive connections to the actin cytoskeleton ( 4 - 6 ). Approximately 150 components of integrin signaling complexes have been described, and based on their reported pairwise interactions, a hypothetical integrin ‘adhesome’ has been created ( 7 ). However, the networks that translate ligand binding into functional readouts, the extent of receptor-specific and spatiotemporal variation in composition, the stoichiometry of complex components, and the molecular mechanisms that coordinate different pathways within the signaling network are unknown. To date, systematic global analyses of the integrin signaling nexus have been hampered by the inherent lability and inaccessibility of plasma membrane-associated complexes. Here, we report the development of a quantitative proteomic methodology suitable for the analysis of transmembrane receptor-ligand complexes, and the application of the methodology to two related, but functionally distinct, integrin-ligand pairs: α 4 β 1 –VCAM-1 and α 5 β 1 –FN. These structurally related integrins were selected because they have been reported to exhibit distinct functional activities with respect to cell migration and exertion of cellular contractile forces ( 8 , 9 ). We reasoned that their proteomes would contain both shared and receptor-specific interacting proteins.

A quantitative proteomic methodology for the analysis of integrin adhesion complexes

Integrin-associated complexes were isolated from α 5 + /α 4 + K562 cells (K562 cells stably transfected with α 4 integrin) using a ligand affinity purification approach ( Fig. 1A ). α 5 + /α 4 + K562 cells display a similar degree of attachment to VCAM-1 compared to that mediated by endogenous α 5 β 1 to FN and demonstrate similar activation-state modulation of α 4 β 1 compared to that of the endogenously expressed receptor ( 10 ). The restricted integrin expression profile of α 5 + /α 4 + K562 cells, unlike most other cells, thus enabled heterodimer-specific adhesion and signaling events to be pinpointed.

Paramagnetic beads were coated with integrin ligands (FN for α 5 β 1 or VCAM-1 for α 4 β 1 ) and mixed with cells in suspension to induce the formation of adhesion complexes. Following sonication and detergent extraction, bead-associated material was probed for the presence of integrin subunits and the adhesion complex components talin and paxillin by Western blotting. Consistent with previous attempts to identify integrin-associated proteins by immunoprecipitation, low amounts of talin and paxillin were recovered ( Fig. 1, B and C ). However, the addition of the membrane-permeable cross-linker dimethyl-3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP) prior to cell lysis increased the recovery of adhesion complex components compared to the controls, which were anti–transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody or a VCAM-1 Asp 40 →Ala (D40A) mutant that does not bind to integrins. In contrast, the non-membrane-permeable cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) increased the recovery of the primary receptor-ligand complex, but failed to retain talin and paxillin ( Fig. 1B ). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D did not affect the recovery of talin and paxillin, demonstrating that the integrin-associated complexes were not simply trapped in an extended actin network ( fig. S1 ). Taken together, these data demonstrate that specific and efficient isolation of integrin-associated complexes is possible, but that it requires use of a membrane-permeable cross-linker prior to cell lysis.

Tandem mass spectrometry identified with ≥99% confidence 620, 418, and 319 proteins in FN, VCAM-1, and non-integrin-binding control samples, respectively. Of the characterized FN receptors ( 3 ), α 5 was the predominant α integrin subunit detected in FN-induced complexes, whereas β 3 integrin was not detected. In addition, α 4 β 1 was the only integrin receptor detected in VCAM-1-induced complexes. These data demonstrate that the complexes isolated by FN and VCAM-1 are primarily recruited by α 5 β 1 and α 4 β 1 integrins, respectively.

Relative abundance of identified proteins was measured using spectral counting ( 11 , 12 ). Hierarchical clustering was used to identify patterns of recruitment of proteins between samples and to aid the objective assimilation of multiple, large proteomic datasets ( 13 ) ( Fig. 2 and table S1 ). Unbiased Pearson correlation identified five major groups of proteins based on their relative abundance in the different samples, which corresponded to clusters of proteins enriched to VCAM-1 (correlation = 0.66), FN (correlation = 0.72), both FN and VCAM-1 (correlation = 0.71), the negative control (correlation = 0.64), or all three conditions (correlation = 0.65) (displayed from top to bottom, respectively, in Fig. 2A ). We reasoned that the groups identified by hierarchical clustering represented proteins that were either specifically enriched in α 5 β 1 –FN or α 4 β 1 –VCAM-1 complexes, were core components of both types of complex, or were non-specifically recruited. As an important test of the unbiased clustering, the α 4 and α 5 integrin subunits were found to reside, as expected, in clusters enriched in VCAM-1 and FN samples, respectively ( Fig. 2, B and C ). Known adhesion complex proteins, including myosin IIA, vinculin, VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein), filamin, ACF7 (actin cross-linking family protein 7), IQGAP (IQ motif–containing GTPase-activating protein), Rap1b, and protein phosphatase 2, were found in a dual FN- and VCAM-1-enriched cluster, characterized by a higher abundance of the proteins in the FN samples compared to VCAM-1 samples ( Fig. 2D ). The shared β 1 integrin subunit resided in a separate dual FN- and VCAM-1-enriched cluster ( Fig. 2E ), along with several well-characterized adhesion complex proteins, including kindlin-3, talin-1, zyxin, fascin, α-actinin-4, moesin, 14-3-3 protein β/α, myosin IIB, and actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex subunit 3 ( Fig. 2E and tables S1 and S2 ). The proteins identified in the dual FN- and VCAM-1-enriched clusters can therefore be considered core components of the two complexes.

Analysis of the clusters specifically enriched to either integrin ligand revealed a much larger number of proteins enriched in FN samples compared to VCAM-1, suggesting that FN has a greater agonistic potential to recruit the adhesion machinery than VCAM-1 ( Fig. 2, B and C , and tables S1 and S2 ). For FN, this cluster again contained several well-studied adhesion complex proteins including CD98hc (cluster of differentiation 98 heavy chain), ILK (integrin-linked kinase), LASP1 [LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3) and SH3 (Src homology 3) protein 1], disabled-2, Arp2/3 complex components, and 14-3-3 proteins, but it also contained many candidate adhesion components. The smaller VCAM-1 cluster contained proteins such as ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) 1, SHP2 [SH2 (Src homology 2) domain–containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2], and casein kinase 1 that were detected exclusively in VCAM-1 samples, as well as a group of proteins (including galectin-1, Rab5C, and Rac1) that were detected in both integrin ligands but enriched in VCAM-1 compared to FN samples. Intriguingly, some proteins that have been documented as components of mature integrin-containing adhesion complexes, such as tensin, FAK (focal adhesion kinase), p130Cas, and Src, were not identified in our analyses. A distinguishing feature of these proteins is that they are responsive to the application of force ( 2 , 4 , 14 - 16 ), and their absence is consistent with the fact that bead-bound complexes were isolated without the specific application of tension. A similar pattern of recruitment was observed for small signaling GTPases. Rac1, which drives adhesion intiation, was detected but RhoA, which is activated by force and drives the maturation of adhesion complexes ( 17 ), was not. Taken together, these findings suggest that the complex components listed in Fig. 2 and tables S1 and S2 represent early nascent adhesions. In the future, it will be important to adapt the workflow to isolate complexes from adherent cells or from cells in suspension to which force has been applied.

DISCUSSION

Using an integrin-targeted proteomic strategy, we have identified RCC2 as a component of FN-induced signaling pathways that regulate directional cell migration. RCC2 has been previously characterized as a passenger protein, localizing to the centromere during specific stages of the cell cycle. RCC2 is required for alignment of chromosomes on the spindle (chromosome congression), centromeric targeting of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC), and activation of Aurora-B kinase, the catalytic subunit of the CPC ( 25 , 29 ). The CPC functions to regulate chromosomal and cytoskeletal events during cell division, and CPC proteins have well-defined roles in cell cleavage ( 30 ). It is therefore likely that RCC2 is also essential for cell cleavage. RCC2 shares structural homology with other RCC1 family GEFs that act on Ran, Arf1, and Rab proteins, but it is unique among this family with respect to its ability to bind Rac1 ( 25 , 31 ). Inactivation of Rac is essential for cytokinesis ( 32 ) and it is becoming increasingly apparent that integrins help determine the orientation of cytokinesis and subsequent positioning of daughter cells ( 33 , 34 ). How integrin signaling and the activity of RCC2 are spatiotemporally regulated during cell adhesion, spreading, and mitosis remains to be resolved, and it is intriguing that RCC2 colocalizes at the midbody with talin, an integrin-binding cytoskeletal protein, during cytokinesis ( 35 ).

Intriguingly, as well as identifying a large number of known adhesion-related components, our analyses have highlighted numerous putative novel integrin-associated proteins. For example, many proteins with functions relating to protein translation were found to be specifically enriched to FN, VCAM-1, or both integrin ligands. In support of this finding, the translational machinery has been shown to reposition to sites of adhesion ( 36 ), and β 1 integrin was found to be required to stimulate FN-mediated translation in fibroblasts ( 37 ). Moreover, we detected LIM domain–containing proteins, such as the integrin-associated proteins zyxin and paxillin, which can bind nucleic acids and thus may serve a scaffolding role in translational processes ( 36 ). Furthermore, a quantitative proteomics approach identified ribonucleoprotein complexes, likely to be involved in protein translation, which appeared during early stages of cell spreading at locations close to sites of adhesion ( 38 ).

In summary, this first non-candidate-based analysis of integrin ligand-induced signaling has identified core and receptor-specific components of α 5 β 1 and α 4 β 1 integrin signaling complexes and pinpointed RCC2 as a coordinator of FN-dependent adhesion signaling pathways, a dual activity-limiter of Rac1 and Arf6, and a regulator of adhesion complex formation, cell spreading, and directional migration. The abundance of active Rac1 governs the persistence of cell migration through the formation of peripheral lamellae ( 28 ). We speculate that RCC2 acts to restrict activation of Rac1 and Arf6 to a degree that enables effective membrane protrusion and integrin trafficking, thereby permitting cells to both maintain directional migration and respond to the topographic features of their environment. The development of this proteomics pipeline now allows the molecular composition of various adhesion complexes to be measured directly, and opens the way to systems-level analyses of adhesion.
