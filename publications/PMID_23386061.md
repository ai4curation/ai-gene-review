Formation of cilia, microtubule-based structures that function in propulsion and 
sensation, requires Kif3a, a subunit of Kinesin II essential for intraflagellar 
transport (IFT). We have found that, Kif3a is also required to organize 
centrioles. In the absence of Kif3a, the subdistal appendages of centrioles are 
disorganized and lack p150(Glued) and Ninein. Consequently, microtubule 
anchoring, centriole cohesion and basal foot formation are abrogated by loss of 
Kif3a. Kif3a localizes to the mother centriole and interacts with the Dynactin 
subunit p150(Glued). Depletion of p150(Glued) phenocopies the effects of loss of 
Kif3a, indicating that Kif3a recruitment of p150(Glued) is critical for 
subdistal appendage formation. The transport functions of Kif3a are dispensable 
for subdistal appendage organization as mutant forms of Kif3a lacking motor 
activity or the motor domain can restore p150(Glued) localization. Comparison to 
cells lacking Ift88 reveals that the centriolar functions of Kif3a are 
independent of IFT. Thus, in addition to its ciliogenic roles, Kif3a recruits 
p150(Glued) to the subdistal appendages of mother centrioles, critical for 
centrosomes to function as microtubule-organizing centres.
