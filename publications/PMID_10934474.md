PAR (partitioning-defective) proteins, which were first identified in the 
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, are essential for asymmetric cell division and 
polarized growth, whereas Cdc42 mediates establishment of cell polarity. Here we 
describe an unexpected link between these two systems. We have identified a 
family of mammalian Par6 proteins that are similar to the C. elegans PDZ-domain 
protein PAR-6. Par6 forms a complex with Cdc42-GTP, with a human homologue of 
the multi-PDZ protein PAR-3 and with the regulatory domains of atypical protein 
kinase C (PKC) proteins. This assembly is implicated in the formation of normal 
tight junctions at epithelial cell-cell contacts. Thus, Par6 is a key adaptor 
that links Cdc42 and atypical PKCs to Par3.
