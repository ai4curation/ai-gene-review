Meprin β is a dimeric type I transmembrane protein and acts as an ectodomain 
sheddase at the cell surface. It has been shown that meprin β cleaves the 
amyloid precursor protein (APP), thereby releasing neurotoxic amyloid β peptides 
and implicating a role of meprin β in Alzheimer's disease. In order to identify 
non-proteolytic regulators of meprin β, we performed a split ubiquitin yeast 
two-hybrid screen using a small intestinal cDNA library. In this screen we 
identified tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) as interaction partner for meprin β. As 
several members of the tetraspanin family were described to interact with 
metalloproteases thereby affecting their localization and/or activity, we 
hypothesized similar functions of TSPAN8 in the regulation of meprin β. We 
employed cell biological methods to confirm direct binding of TSPAN8 to meprin 
β. Surprisingly, we did not observe an effect of TSPAN8 on the catalytic 
activity of meprin β nor on the specific cleavage of its substrate APP. However, 
both proteins were identified as present in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. 
Therefore we hypothesize that TSPAN8 might be important for the orchestration of 
meprin β at the cell surface with impact on certain proteolytic processes that 
have to be further identified.
