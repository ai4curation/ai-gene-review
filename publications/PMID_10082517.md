Histones are dynamically modified during chromatin assembly, as specific 
transcriptional patterns are established, and during mitosis and development. 
Modifications include acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, 
and ADP-ribosylation, but the biological significance of each of these is not 
well understood. For example, distinct acetylation patterns correlate with 
nucleosome formation and with transcriptionally activated or silenced chromatin, 
yet mutations in genes encoding several yeast histone acetyltransferase (HAT) 
activities result in either no cellular phenotype or only modest growth defects. 
Here we report characterization of ESA1, an essential gene that is a member of 
the MYST family that includes two yeast silencing genes, human genes associated 
with leukemia and with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein, and 
Drosophila mof, a gene essential for male dosage compensation. Esa1p acetylates 
histones in a pattern distinct from those of other yeast enzymes, and 
temperature-sensitive mutant alleles abolish enzymatic activity in vitro and 
result in partial loss of an acetylated isoform of histone H4 in vivo. Strains 
carrying these mutations are also blocked in the cell cycle such that at 
restrictive temperatures, esa1 mutants succeed in replicating their DNA but fail 
to proceed normally through mitosis and cytokinesis. Recent studies show that 
Esa1p enhances transcription in vitro and thus may modulate expression of genes 
important for cell cycle control. These observations therefore link an essential 
HAT activity to cell cycle progression, potentially through discrete 
transcriptional regulatory events.
