Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio 
vulgaris (Hildenborough).

Voordouw G, Brenner S.

The nucleotide sequence of the 4.7-kb SalI/EcoRI insert of plasmid pHV 15 
containing the hydrogenase gene from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough) has 
been determined with the dideoxy chain-termination method. The structural gene 
for hydrogenase encodes a protein product of molecular mass 45820 Da. The 
NH2-terminal sequence of the enzyme deduced from the nucleic acid sequence 
corresponds exactly to the amino acid sequence determined by Edman degradation. 
The nucleic acid sequence indicates that a N-formylmethionine residue precedes 
the NH2-terminal amino acid Ser-1. There is no evidence for a leader sequence. 
The NH2-terminal part of the hydrogenase shows homology to the bacterial 
[8Fe-8S] ferredoxins. The sequence 
Cys-Ile-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Ala-(Ile) occurs twice 
both in the hydrogenase and in [8Fe-8S] ferredoxins, where the Cys residues have 
been shown to coordinate two [4Fe-4S] clusters [Adman, E. T., Sieker, L. C. and 
Jensen, L. H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3987-3996]. These results, therefore, 
suggest that two electron-transferring ferredoxin-like [4Fe-4S] clusters are 
located in the NH2-terminal segment of the hydrogenase molecule. There are ten 
more Cys residues but it is not clear which four of these could participate in 
the formation of the third cluster, which is thought to be the hydrogen binding 
centre. Another gene, encoding a protein of molecular mass 13493 Da, was found 
immediately downstream from the gene for the 46-kDa hydrogenase. The nucleic 
acid sequence suggests that the hydrogenase and the 13.5-kDa protein belong to a 
single operon and are coordinately expressed. Since dodecylsulfate gel 
electrophoresis of purified hydrogenase indicates the presence of a 13.5-kDa 
polypeptide in addition to the 46-kDa component, it is proposed that the 
hydrogenase from D. vulgaris (Hildenborough) is a two-subunit enzyme.
