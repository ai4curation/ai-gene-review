Signaling through G proteins normally involves conformational switching between 
GTP- and GDP-bound states. Several Rho GTPases are also regulated by RhoGDI 
binding and sequestering in the cytosol. Rnd proteins are atypical 
constitutively GTP-bound Rho proteins, whose regulation remains elusive. Here, 
we report a high-affinity 14-3-3-binding site at the C terminus of Rnd3 
consisting of both the Cys241-farnesyl moiety and a Rho-associated coiled coil 
containing protein kinase (ROCK)-dependent Ser240 phosphorylation site. 14-3-3 
binding to Rnd3 also involves phosphorylation of Ser218 by ROCK and/or Ser210 by 
protein kinase C (PKC). The crystal structure of a phosphorylated, farnesylated 
Rnd3 peptide with 14-3-3 reveals a hydrophobic groove in 14-3-3 proteins 
accommodating the farnesyl moiety. Functionally, 14-3-3 inhibits Rnd3-induced 
cell rounding by translocating it from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. Rnd1, 
Rnd2, and geranylgeranylated Rap1A interact similarly with 14-3-3. In contrast 
to the canonical GTP/GDP switch that regulates most Ras superfamily members, our 
results reveal an unprecedented mechanism for G protein inhibition by 14-3-3 
proteins.
