Heat shock proteins maintain protein homeostasis and facilitate the survival of 
an organism under stress. Archaeal heat shock machinery usually consists of only 
sHsps, Hsp70, and Hsp60. Moreover, Hsp70 is absent in thermophilic and 
hyperthermophilic archaea. In the absence of Hsp70, how aggregating protein 
substrates are transferred to Hsp60 for refolding remains elusive. Here, we 
investigated the crosstalk in the heat shock response pathway of 
thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. In the present study, 
we biophysically and biochemically characterized one of the small heat shock 
proteins, Hsp14, of S. acidocaldarius. Moreover, we investigated its ability to 
interact with Hsp20 and Hsp60 to facilitate the substrate proteins' folding 
under stress conditions. Like Hsp20, we demonstrated that the dimer is the 
active form of Hsp14, and it forms an oligomeric storage form at a higher 
temperature. More importantly, the dynamics of the Hsp14 oligomer are maintained 
by rapid subunit exchange between the dimeric states, and the rate of subunit 
exchange increases with increasing temperature. We also tested the ability of 
Hsp14 to form hetero-oligomers via subunit exchange with Hsp20. We observed 
hetero-oligomer formation only at higher temperatures (50 °C-70 °C). 
Furthermore, experiments were performed to investigate the interaction between 
small heat shock proteins and Hsp60. We demonstrated an enthalpy-driven direct 
physical interaction between Hsp14 and Hsp60. Our results revealed that Hsp14 
could transfer sHsp-captured substrate proteins to Hsp60, which then refolds 
them back to their active form.
