Tumor suppression by insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) has 
been demonstrated to occur via insulin-like growth factor-dependent and 
-independent mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. We have recently described 
IGFBP-3-induced mitochondrial translocation of the nuclear receptors 
RXRalpha/Nur77 in the induction of prostate cancer (CaP) cell apoptosis. Herein, 
we demonstrate that IGFBP-3 and Nur77 associate in the cytoplasmic compartment 
in 22RV1 CaP cells. Nur77 is a major component of IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis as 
shown by utilizing mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Nur77 
wild-type and knockout (KO) mice. However, dose-response experiments revealed 
that a small component of IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis is Nur77 independent. 
Reintroduction of Nur77 into Nur77 KO MEFs restores full responsiveness to 
IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 induces phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase and inhibition 
of Akt phosphorylation and activity, which have been associated with Nur77 
translocation. Finally, IGFBP-3 administration to CaP xenografts on SCID mice 
induced apoptosis and translocated Nur77 out of the nucleus. Taken together, our 
results verify an important role for the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 in the 
apoptotic actions of IGFBP-3.
