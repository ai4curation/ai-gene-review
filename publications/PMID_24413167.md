Contraction of the actomyosin ring (AMR) provides the centripetal force that 
drives cytokinesis. In budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), assembly and 
contraction of the AMR is coordinated with membrane deposition and septum 
formation at the bud neck. A central player in this process is Iqg1, which 
promotes recruitment of actin to the myosin ring and links AMR assembly with 
that of septum-forming components. We observed early actin recruitment in 
response to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity, and we find 
that the Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation state of Iqg1 is a determining factor in 
the timing of bud neck localization of both Iqg1 and actin, with both proteins 
accumulating prematurely in cells expressing nonphosphorylatable Iqg1 mutants. 
We also identified the primary septum regulator Hof1 as a binding partner of 
Iqg1, providing a regulatory link between the septation and contractile pathways 
that cooperate to complete cytokinesis.

ABSTRACT

Contraction of the actomyosin ring (AMR) provides the centripetal force that drives cytokinesis. In budding yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), assembly and contraction of the AMR is coordinated with membrane deposition and septum formation at the bud neck. A central player in this process is Iqg1, which promotes recruitment of actin to the myosin ring and links AMR assembly with that of septum-forming components. We observed early actin recruitment in response to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity, and we find that the Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation state of Iqg1 is a determining factor in the timing of bud neck localization of both Iqg1 and actin, with both proteins accumulating prematurely in cells expressing nonphosphorylatable Iqg1 mutants. We also identified the primary septum regulator Hof1 as a binding partner of Iqg1, providing a regulatory link between the septation and contractile pathways that cooperate to complete cytokinesis.

INTRODUCTION

Cytokinesis requires the spatial and temporal regulation of multiple cellular and extracellular components at the site of cell division. In animal and fungal cells, a ring of actin filaments joined by myosin bundles forms along the plasma membrane ( Mabuchi, 1994 ; Satterwhite and Pollard, 1992 ). As myosin motor activity contracts the ring and draws the membrane inwards, new plasma membrane and extracellular matrix components are deposited at the division site. The cell must coordinate these processes with each other and relative to other cell cycle events to ensure that cell division occurs only after completion of mitosis.

In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , cytokinesis is carried out by structures and processes that are largely equivalent to those in animal cells ( Wloka and Bi, 2012 ), including a contractile actomyosin ring (AMR) ( Bi et al., 1998 ) and a cell wall deposition pathway that is analogous to mammalian extracellular matrix remodeling ( Bi and Park, 2012 ). However, the budding yeast life cycle, with its ‘pre-furrowed’ division site, enables perturbation of either process without lethal effects ( Lippincott and Li, 1998b ; Rodriguez and Paterson, 1990 ; Schmidt et al., 2002 ), making S. cerevisiae a valuable model for study of the regulatory relationships among the proteins involved.

The yeast AMR is assembled sequentially throughout the cell cycle ( Lippincott and Li, 1998b ), beginning with the ring-shaped accumulation of septin proteins at the future bud site ( Drubin and Nelson, 1996 ; Pringle et al., 1995 ). A ring of the type-II myosin heavy chain Myo1 forms at the nascent bud neck in a septin-dependent manner. Next, the septin-binding protein Bni5 ( Lee et al., 2002 ) and the formins Bnr1 and Bni1 ( Vallen et al., 2000 ) arrive at and depart from the bud neck in a distinct order, interacting with the Myo1 tail to guide Myo1 into its final position ( Fang et al., 2010 ). The myosin light chain protein Mlc1 arrives in mitosis ( Boyne et al., 2000 ) and facilitates recruitment of the essential protein Iqg1 ( Shannon and Li, 2000 ). Iqg1 both stabilizes the Myo1 ring during mitosis ( Fang et al., 2010 ) and is required for the recruitment of filamentous actin (F-actin), which completes AMR assembly and immediately precedes ring contraction ( Epp and Chant, 1997 ; Lippincott and Li, 1998b ; Shannon and Li, 1999 ).

AMR contraction is coupled with the onset of cell wall formation, which begins with the centripetal deposition of the chitinous primary septum by chitin synthase II (Chs2) ( Sburlati and Cabib, 1986 ; Shaw et al., 1991 ). A secondary septum is then deposited along the primary septum and becomes the cell wall upon digestion of the primary septum. Like AMR assembly, primary septum deposition follows the sequential bud neck localization of several organizing proteins, most importantly Hof1, Cyk3 and Inn1 ( Devrekanli et al., 2012 ; Kamei et al., 1998 ; Korinek et al., 2000 ; Lippincott and Li, 1998a ; Nishihama et al., 2009 ; Sanchez-Diaz et al., 2008 ).

Although disruption of AMR contraction and primary septum deposition together is lethal ( Vallen et al., 2000 ), neither process alone is essential for viability ( Bi et al., 1998 ; Lippincott and Li, 1998b ; Rodriguez and Paterson, 1990 ; Schmidt et al., 2002 ). However, each process is defective in the absence of the other, as myo1Δ cells deposit a misoriented primary septum ( Fang et al., 2010 ; Rodriguez and Paterson, 1990 ) and chs2Δ cells produce unstable and asymmetric AMRs ( Schmidt et al., 2002 ; VerPlank and Li, 2005 ). The two processes are at once physically distinct, mutually interdependent and partially redundant, a relationship that invites and facilitates more detailed molecular investigation. Genetic studies have illuminated the dependencies underlying sequential protein recruitment to the bud neck ( Jendretzki et al., 2009 ; Meitinger et al., 2010 ; Roh et al., 2002 ), but information on the temporal regulation of these components remains limited.

The 173-kDa protein Iqg1 is one of the few cytokinesis components that is essential for viability ( Epp and Chant, 1997 ). Iqg1 is homologous to the mammalian IQGAP proteins that bundle F-actin ( Bashour et al., 1997 ; Fukata et al., 1997 ) and regulate actin-dependent processes including cytokinesis ( Hart et al., 1996 ; White et al., 2012 ). Iqg1 is required for actin recruitment to the bud neck ( Bi et al., 1998 ; Epp and Chant, 1997 ; Lippincott and Li, 1998b ) and interacts genetically with primary septum regulators, such as Cyk3 ( Korinek et al., 2000 ). Its large size and multi-domain architecture, together with its essential function, make Iqg1 a likely physical link between the AMR and primary septum machinery.

Cytokinesis occurs during a period defined by the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and the dephosphorylation of Cdk1 protein substrates, brought on by mitotic cyclin degradation and Cdc14 phosphatase activation ( Stegmeier and Amon, 2004 ). Dephosphorylation of Cdk1 substrates underlies many events of late mitosis and cytokinesis ( Bloom et al., 2011 ; Chin et al., 2012 ; Khmelinskii et al., 2009 ; Mishima et al., 2004 ; Sullivan et al., 2008 ; Teh et al., 2009 ). Cdc14 localizes to the bud neck prior to the onset of cytokinesis and is known to promote primary septum deposition ( Palani et al., 2012 ). Similarly, the mitotic exit network (MEN) that sustains Cdc14 activity regulates septin dynamics ( Cid et al., 2001 ; Lippincott et al., 2001 ), actin localization ( Sanchez-Diaz et al., 2012 ), primary septum function ( Meitinger et al., 2010 ) and AMR contraction ( Lippincott et al., 2001 ; Luca et al., 2001 ; Vallen et al., 2000 ).

Here, we addressed the mechanisms by which Cdk1 substrate dephosphorylation governs AMR assembly and contraction. We identified Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of Iqg1 as a determinant of bud neck localization of Iqg1 itself and of proteins in the AMR assembly and primary septum deposition pathways, providing insight into the mechanisms by which Cdks control the timing and coordination of cytokinetic events.
