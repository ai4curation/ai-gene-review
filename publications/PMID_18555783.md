BAP31 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein-sorting factor that associates with 
newly synthesized integral membrane proteins and controls their fate (i.e., 
egress, retention, survival, or degradation). BAP31 is itself an integral 
membrane protein and a constituent of several large protein complexes. Here, we 
show that a part of the BAP31 population interacts with two components of the 
Sec61 preprotein translocon, Sec61beta and TRAM. BAP31 associates with the N 
terminus of one of its newly synthesized client proteins, the DeltaF508 mutant 
of CFTR, and promotes its retrotranslocation from the ER and degradation by the 
cytoplasmic 26S proteasome system. Depletion of BAP31 reduces the proteasomal 
degradation of DeltaF508 and permits a significant fraction of the surviving 
protein to reach the cell surface. Of note, BAP31 also associates physically and 
functionally with the Derlin-1 protein disclocation complex in the DeltaF508 
degradation pathway. Thus, BAP31 operates at early steps to deliver newly 
synthesized CFTRDeltaF508 to its degradation pathway.
