We provide microarray data comparing genome-wide differential expression and 
pathology throughout life in four lines of "amyloid" transgenic mice (mutant 
human APP, PSEN1, or APP/PSEN1) and "TAU" transgenic mice (mutant human MAPT 
gene). Microarray data were validated by qPCR and by comparison to human 
studies, including genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits. Immune gene 
expression correlated tightly with plaques whereas synaptic genes correlated 
negatively with neurofibrillary tangles. Network analysis of immune gene modules 
revealed six hub genes in hippocampus of amyloid mice, four in common with 
cortex. The hippocampal network in TAU mice was similar except that Trem2 had 
hub status only in amyloid mice. The cortical network of TAU mice was entirely 
different with more hub genes and few in common with the other networks, 
suggesting reasons for specificity of cortical dysfunction in FTDP17. This 
Resource opens up many areas for investigation. All data are available and 
searchable at http://www.mouseac.org.
