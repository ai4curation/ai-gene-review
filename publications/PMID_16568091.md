Breast tumor kinase (Brk) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase distantly related to 
the Src family kinase. It is expressed in more than 60% of breast tumors, but 
the biological role of this kinase remains to be determined. Only a limited 
number of substates have been identified for Brk, and the link of Brk to 
tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that 
the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, STAT3, is a 
physiological target of Brk. Activation of STAT3 previously has been linked to 
oncogenesis, and results in this study demonstrate that STAT3 is tyrosine 
phosphorylated and transcriptionally activated in cells expressing endogenous 
Brk. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 is specifically targeted 
since other STAT members are not responsive to Brk expression. Signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 activation requires the catalytic activity of 
Brk, and expression of both STAT3 and Brk stimulate cellular proliferation. In 
addition, we have identified a negative regulator of Brk, the suppressor of 
cytokine signaling, SOCS3. The SOCS3 protein is known to block signaling 
mediated by cytokine receptors, and here we find that SOCS3 is able to repress 
the activity of the Brk non-receptor tyrosine kinase.
