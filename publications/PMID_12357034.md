Calcineurin (Cn), a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, is 
an important participant in signaling pathways that activate T cells. It is the 
target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. These drugs 
bind proteins known as cyclophilin (Cyp) and FK506-binding protein, 
respectively, and the drug-protein complexes in turn inhibit Cn. We report the 
crystal structure of a Cyp/CsA/Cn ternary complex, determined to a resolution of 
3.1 A. Residues 3-9 of CsA, particularly N-methyl leucines 4 and 6, and Trp-121 
of Cyp form a composite surface for interaction with Cn. The hydrophobic 
interface buries two hydrogen bonds. The structure accounts clearly for the 
effects of mutations in Cn on CsA-resistance and for the way modifications of 
CsA alter immunosuppressive activity.

Abstract

Calcineurin (Cn), a Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, is an important participant in signaling pathways that activate T cells. It is the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. These drugs bind proteins known as cyclophilin (Cyp) and FK506-binding protein, respectively, and the drug–protein complexes in turn inhibit Cn. We report the crystal structure of a Cyp/CsA/Cn ternary complex, determined to a resolution of 3.1 Å. Residues 3–9 of CsA, particularly N -methyl leucines 4 and 6, and Trp-121 of Cyp form a composite surface for interaction with Cn. The hydrophobic interface buries two hydrogen bonds. The structure accounts clearly for the effects of mutations in Cn on CsA-resistance and for the way modifications of CsA alter immunosuppressive activity.

Conclusion

CsA and FK506 have famously resisted substantial efforts to  improve on them as drugs. The structure of the Cyp/CsA/Cn complex,  although it brings no major surprises, does suggest potential  strategies for renewing such a quest. In particular, alteration of the  butenyl substituent of CsA1Bmt might improve its fit against the  hydrophobic primary-contact surface of Cn, and modification of TCsA  ( 18 ) to include a hydrogen-bond donor for the carbonyl of CnA342Trp or  that of CnA312Leu might enhance affinity for Cn while retaining the  desired rigidification of CsA. Comparison with the FKBP/FK506/Cn  complex demonstrates a remarkable similarity in the way two unrelated  molecules recruit two rather different small proteins (although both  are prolyl isomerases) to create a bulky intracellular inhibitor out of  a much smaller, freely diffusible drug.
