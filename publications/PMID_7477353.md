The Syk cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase has two amino-terminal SH2 domains 
and a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain. Syk, and its close relative ZAP-70, are 
apparently pivotal in coupling antigen- and Fc-receptors to downstream 
signalling events. Syk associates with activated Fc receptors, the T cell 
receptor complex and the B-cell antigen-receptor complex (BCR) in immature and 
mature B lymphocytes. On receptor activation, the tandem SH2 domains of Syk bind 
dual phosphotyrosine sites in the conserved ITAM motifs of receptor signalling 
chains, such as the immunoglobulin alpha and beta-chains of the BCR, leading to 
Syk activation. Here we have investigated Syk function in vivo by generating a 
mouse strain with a targeted mutation in the syk gene. Homozygous syk mutants 
suffered severe haemorrhaging as embryos and died perinatally, indicating that 
Syk has a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity or in wound healing 
during embryogenesis. Analysis of syk-/- lymphoid cells showed that the syk 
mutation impaired the differentiation of B-lineage cells, apparently by 
disrupting signalling from the pre-BCR complex and thereby preventing the clonal 
expansion, and further maturation, of pre-B cells.
