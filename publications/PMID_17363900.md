We previously demonstrated that a fraction of the human Nup107-160 nuclear pore 
subcomplex is recruited to kinetochores at the onset of mitosis. However, the 
molecular determinants for its kinetochore targeting and the functional 
significance of this localization were not investigated. Here, we show that the 
Nup107-160 complex interacts with CENP-F, but that CENP-F only moderately 
contributes to its targeting to kinetochores. In addition, we show that the 
recruitment of the Nup107-160 complex to kinetochores mainly depends on the 
Ndc80 complex. We further demonstrate that efficient depletion of the Nup107-160 
complex from kinetochores, achieved either by combining siRNAs targeting several 
of its subunits excluding Seh1, or by depleting Seh1 alone, induces a mitotic 
delay. Further analysis of Seh1-depleted cells revealed impaired chromosome 
congression, reduced kinetochore tension and kinetochore-microtubule attachment 
defects. Finally, we show that the presence of the Nup107-160 complex at 
kinetochores is required for the recruitment of Crm1 and RanGAP1-RanBP2 to these 
structures. Together, our data thus provide the first molecular clues underlying 
the function of the human Nup107-160 complex at kinetochores.
