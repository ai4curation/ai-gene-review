Mutations that cause loss of acidity in the vacuole (lysosome) of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae were identified by screening colonies labeled with the fluorescent, 
pH-sensitive, vacuolar labeling agent, 6-carboxyfluorescein. Thirty nine 
vacuolar pH (Vph-) mutants were identified. Four of these contained mutant 
alleles of the previously described PEP3, PEP5, PEP6 and PEP7 genes. The 
remaining mutants defined eight complementation groups of vph mutations. No 
alleles of the VAT2 or TFP1 genes (known to encode subunits of the vacuolar 
H(+)-ATPase) were identified in the Vph- screen. Strains bearing mutations in 
any of six of the VPH genes failed to grow on medium buffered at neutral pH; 
otherwise, none of the vph mutations caused notable growth inhibition on 
standard yeast media. Expression of the vacuolar protease, carboxypeptidase Y, 
was defective in strains bearing vph4 mutations but was apparently normal in 
strains bearing any of the other vph mutations. Defects in vacuolar morphology 
at the light microscope level were evident in all Vph- mutants. Strains that 
contained representative mutant alleles of the 17 previously described PEP genes 
were assayed for vacuolar pH; mutations in seven of the PEP genes (including 
PEP3, PEP5, PEP6 and PEP7) caused loss of vacuolar acidity.
