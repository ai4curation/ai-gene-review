The NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2 controls ribosomal DNA (rDNA) 
silencing by inhibiting recombination and RNA polymerase II-catalyzed 
transcription in the rDNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2 is recruited to 
nontranscribed spacer 1 (NTS1) of the rDNA array by interaction between the RENT 
( RE: gulation of N: ucleolar S: ilencing and T: elophase exit) complex and the 
replication terminator protein Fob1. The latter binds to its cognate sites, 
called replication termini (Ter) or replication fork barriers (RFB), that are 
located in each copy of NTS1. This work provides new mechanistic insights into 
the regulation of rDNA silencing and intrachromatid recombination by showing 
that Sir2 recruitment is stringently regulated by Fob1 phosphorylation at 
specific sites in its C-terminal domain (C-Fob1), which also regulates 
long-range Ter-Ter interactions. We show further that long-range Fob1-mediated 
Ter-Ter interactions in trans are downregulated by Sir2. These regulatory 
mechanisms control intrachromatid recombination and the replicative life span 
(RLS).
