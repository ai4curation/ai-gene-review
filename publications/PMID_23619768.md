Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a highly conserved mechanism of mRNA 
degradation. NMD eliminates mRNAs containing premature termination codons 
(PTCs), preventing the production of truncated proteins with possible 
deleterious effects. However, there is mounting evidence that NMD factors, like 
Upf1, Upf2 and Upf3, participate in general regulation of gene expression, 
affecting the expression of genes lacking PTCs. We have used the fission yeast 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe to identify mRNAs directly regulated by NMD. Using a 
combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, we have defined a population 
of fission yeast mRNAs specifically regulated by Upf1. We show that other 
components of the Upf complex, Upf2 and Upf3, are required for binding of Upf1 
to its RNA targets and for the proper response of fission yeast to oxidative 
stress. Finally, we investigated the physiological importance of this 
phenomenon, and demonstrate that the Upf1-dependent downregulation of some of 
its direct targets is necessary for normal resistance to oxidative stress.
