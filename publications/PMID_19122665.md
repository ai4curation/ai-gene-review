The floor plate, an essential ventral midline organizing center that produces 
the morphogen Shh, has distinct properties along the neuraxis. The neurogenic 
potential of the floor plate and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using 
Shh as a driver for lineage analysis, we found that the mouse midbrain, but not 
the hindbrain, floor plate is neurogenic, giving rise to dopamine (DA) neurons. 
Distinct spatiotemporal Shh and Wnt expression may distinguish the neurogenetic 
potential of these structures. We discovered an inhibitory role for Shh: removal 
of Shh resulted in neurogenesis from the hindbrain midline and, conversely, high 
doses of Shh inhibited proliferation and DA neuron production in midbrain 
cultures. We found that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is necessary and sufficient 
for antagonizing Shh, DA progenitor marker induction and promotion of 
dopaminergic neurogenesis. These findings demonstrate how the dynamic interplay 
of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and Shh may orchestrate floor plate 
neurogenesis or a lack thereof.
