A role for angiogenic growth factors in trophoblast invasion has been 
postulated. Directional motility (chemotaxis) is an important function of 
trophoblast cells. We have previously shown that vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) increases the random movement of trophoblast cells although 
placental growth factor (PlGF) has no effect. Heparin inhibited this effect of 
VEGF. Motility of trophoblast cells has been proposed to be mediated by a nitric 
oxide (NO) pathway. We hypothesized that VEGF but not PlGF would be chemotactic 
for trophoblast cells. Chemotaxis of a first trimester extravillous trophoblast 
cell line, SGHPL-4, and primary isolates of first trimester and term trophoblast 
cells was measured using a Boyden chamber. Initial experiments to optimize the 
time of the experiment and identify a positive control were performed. 
Subsequent experiments ran for 20 h, used 0.5 per cent FBS or 10 ng/ml PDGF as 
negative and positive controls and were performed in triplicate. VEGF (1, 10 and 
100 ng/ml+/-1 microg/ml heparin or +/-100 microM L-NAME) and PlGF (1, 10, 100 
ng/ml) were tested. The chamber was placed in a 5 per cent CO(2) in air, 37 
degrees C incubator. The number of cells in the lower chamber were counted. 
There was a dose dependent increase in chemotactic motility of the SGHPL-4 cell 
line and term trophoblast cells in response to VEGF. PlGF had no effect on the 
movement of the first trimester trophoblast cell line but did increase the 
motility of the term trophoblast cells in a dose dependent manner. Heparin 
increased the cellular motility of both cell types alone. It also further 
enhanced the chemoactivity of VEGF on the term trophoblast cells but not the 
cell line. L-NAME did not affect the VEGF-stimulated motility of the first 
trimester cell line. However, in the term trophoblast cells L-NAME increased the 
directional cellular motility in the absence of, or in the presence of low 
concentrations of VEGF. In conclusion, the first trimester and term trophoblast 
cells appeared to respond differently to the various factors tested in the 
present study that may reflect differential cellular function as gestation 
progresses.
