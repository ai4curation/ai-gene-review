Human serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex catalyzes the initial and 
rate-limiting step in the de novo biosynthesis of all sphingolipids. ORMDLs 
regulate SPT function, with human ORMDL3 being related to asthma. Here we report 
three high-resolution cryo-EM structures: the human SPT complex, composed of 
SPTLC1, SPTLC2 and SPTssa; the SPT-ORMDL3 complex; and the SPT-ORMDL3 complex 
bound to two substrates, PLP-L-serine (PLS) and a non-reactive palmitoyl-CoA 
analogue. SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 form a dimer of heterodimers as the catalytic core. 
SPTssa participates in acyl-CoA coordination, thereby stimulating the SPT 
activity and regulating the substrate selectivity. ORMDL3 is located in the 
center of the complex, serving to stabilize the SPT assembly. Our structural and 
biochemical analyses provide a molecular basis for the assembly and substrate 
selectivity of the SPT and SPT-ORMDL3 complexes, and lay a foundation for 
mechanistic understanding of sphingolipid homeostasis and for related 
therapeutic drug development.
