PURPOSE: Searching for novel approaches to sensitize glioblastoma for cell 
death, we investigated the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effect of bortezomib on tumor necrosis factor-related 
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis signaling pathways was 
analyzed in glioblastoma cell lines, primary glioblastoma cultures, and in an in 
vivo model.
RESULTS: Bortezomib and TRAIL synergistically trigger cell death and reduce 
colony formation of glioblastoma cells (combination index < 0.1). Investigations 
into the underlying molecular mechanisms reveal that bortezomib and TRAIL act in 
concert to cause accumulation of tBid, the active cleavage product of Bid. Also, 
the stability of TRAIL-derived tBid markedly increases on proteasome inhibition. 
Notably, knockdown of Bid significantly decreases bortezomib- and TRAIL-mediated 
cell death. By comparison, silencing of Noxa, which is also upregulated by 
bortezomib, does not confer protection. Coinciding with tBid accumulation, the 
activation of Bax/Bak and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential are strongly 
increased in cotreated cells. Overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly reduces 
mitochondrial perturbations and cell death, underscoring the functional 
relevance of the mitochondrial pathway. In addition, bortezomib cooperates with 
TRAIL to reduce colony formation of glioblastoma cells, showing an effect on 
long-term survival. Of note, bortezomib profoundly enhances TRAIL-triggered cell 
death in primary cultured glioblastoma cells and in patient-derived glioblastoma 
stem cells, underlining the clinical relevance. Importantly, bortezomib 
cooperates with TRAIL to suppress tumor growth in an in vivo glioblastoma model.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide compelling evidence that the combination of 
bortezomib and TRAIL presents a promising novel strategy to trigger cell death 
in glioblastoma, including glioblastoma stem cells, which warrants further 
investigation.
