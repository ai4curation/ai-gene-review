Axin is known to have an important role in the degradation of beta-catenin in 
the Wnt pathway. Here, we reveal a new function of Axin at the centrosome. Axin 
was localized to the centrosome in various cell lines and formed a complex with 
gamma-tubulin. Knockdown of Axin reduced the localization of gamma-tubulin and 
gamma-tubulin complex protein 2-components of the gamma-tubulin ring complex-to 
the centrosome and the centrosomal microtubule nucleation activity after 
treatment with nocodazole. These phenotypes could not be rescued by the 
reduction in the levels of beta-catenin. Although the expression of Axin rescued 
these phenotypes in Axin-knockdown cells, overexpression of Axin2, which is 
highly homologous to Axin, could not. Axin2 was also localized to the 
centrosome, but it did not form a complex with gamma-tubulin. These results 
suggest that Axin, but not Axin2, is involved in microtubule nucleation by 
forming a complex with gamma-tubulin at the centrosome.
