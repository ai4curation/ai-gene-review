The functionality of the actin cytoskeleton depends on a dynamic equilibrium 
between filamentous and monomeric actin. Proteins of the ADF/cofilin family are 
essential for the high rates of actin filament turnover observed in motile cells 
through regulation of actin polymerization/depolymerization cycles. Rho GTPases 
act through p21-activated kinase-1 (Pak-1) and Rho kinase to inhibit cofilin 
activity via the LIM kinase (LIMK)-mediated phosphorylation of cofilin on Ser3. 
We report the identification of 14-3-3zeta as a novel phosphocofilin binding 
protein involved in the maintenance of the cellular phosphocofilin pool. A Ser3 
phosphocofilin binding protein was purified from bovine brain and was identified 
as 14-3-3zeta by mass spectrometry. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction 
between cofilin and 14-3-3zeta was confirmed in pulldown and 
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Both Ser3 phosphorylation and a 14-3-3 
recognition motif in cofilin are necessary for 14-3-3 binding. The expression of 
14-3-3zeta increases phosphocofilin levels, and the coexpression of 14-3-3zeta 
with LIMK further elevates phosphocofilin levels and potentiates LIMK-dependent 
effects on the actin cytoskeleton. This potentiation of cofilin action appears 
to be a result of the protection of phosphocofilin from phosphatase-mediated 
dephosphorylation at Ser3 by bound 14-3-3zeta. Taken together, these results 
suggest that 14-3-3zeta proteins may play a dynamic role in the regulation of 
cellular actin structures through the maintenance of phosphocofilin levels.
