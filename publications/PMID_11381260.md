The lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans is regulated by the insulin/insulin-like 
growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor homolog DAF-2, which signals through a conserved 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt pathway. Mutants in this pathway 
remain youthful and active much longer than normal animals and can live more 
than twice as long. This lifespan extension requires DAF-16, a 
forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor. DAF-16 is thought to be the main 
target of the DAF-2 pathway. Insulin/IGF-1 signaling is thought to lead to 
phosphorylation of DAF-16 by AKT activity, which in turn shortens lifespan. 
Here, we show that the DAF-2 pathway prevents DAF-16 accumulation in nuclei. 
Disrupting Akt-consensus phosphorylation sites in DAF-16 causes nuclear 
accumulation in wild-type animals, but, surprisingly, has little effect on 
lifespan. Thus the DAF-2 pathway must have additional outputs. Lifespan in C. 
elegans can be extended by perturbing sensory neurons or germ cells. In both 
cases, lifespan extension requires DAF-16. We find that both sensory neurons and 
germline activity regulate DAF-16 accumulation in nuclei, but the nuclear 
localization patterns are different. Together these findings reveal unexpected 
complexity in the DAF-16-dependent pathways that regulate aging.
