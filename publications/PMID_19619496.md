Early endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) transport is organized by the 
retromer complex. Consisting of cargo-selective and membrane-bound subcomplexes, 
retromer coordinates sorting with membrane deformation and carrier formation. 
Here, we describe four mammalian retromers whose membrane-bound subcomplexes 
contain specific combinations of the sorting nexins (SNX), SNX1, SNX2, SNX5, and 
SNX6. We establish that retromer requires a dynamic spatial organization of the 
endosomal network, which is regulated through association of SNX5/SNX6 with the 
p150(glued) component of dynactin, an activator of the minus-end directed 
microtubule motor dynein; an association further defined through genetic studies 
in C. elegans. Finally, we also establish that the spatial organization of the 
retromer pathway is mediated through the association of SNX1 with the proposed 
TGN-localized tether Rab6-interacting protein-1. These interactions describe 
fundamental steps in retromer-mediated transport and establish that the spatial 
organization of the retromer network is a critical element required for 
efficient retromer-mediated sorting.
