The purpose of this study was to identify regulatory molecule(s) involved in the 
inflammatory signaling-induced decrease in P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux function 
at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that may occur in brain diseases. We confirmed 
that in vivo P-gp efflux activity at the BBB was decreased without any change in 
P-gp protein expression level in a mouse model of acute inflammation induced by 
3 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide. In a human BBB model cell line (human brain 
capillary endothelial cells; hCMEC/D3), 1-h treatment with 10 ng/mL tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; an inflammatory mediator) rapidly reduced P-gp efflux 
activity, but had no effect on P-gp protein expression level. To clarify the 
non-transcriptional mechanism that causes the decrease in intrinsic efflux 
activity of P-gp in acute inflammation, we applied comprehensive quantitative 
phosphoproteomics to compare hCMEC/D3 cells treated with TNF-α and vehicle 
(control). Actin filament-associated protein-1 (AFAP-1), MAPK1, and 
transcription factor AP-1 (AP-1) were significantly phosphorylated in 
TNF-α-treated cells, and were selected as candidate proteins. In validation 
experiments, knockdown of AFAP-1 expression blocked the reduction in P-gp efflux 
activity by TNF-α treatment, whereas inhibition of MAPK function or knockdown of 
AP-1 expression did not. Quantitative targeted absolute proteomics revealed that 
the reduction in P-gp activity by TNF-α did not require any change in P-gp 
protein expression levels in the plasma membrane. Our results demonstrate that 
AFAP-1 is a key mediator in the inflammatory signaling-induced, 
translocation-independent rapid attenuation of P-gp efflux activity in human 
brain capillary endothelial cells.
