The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor mammalian achaete-scute 
homolog-1 (MASH-1 in mouse and HASH-1 in human) is essential for proper 
development of olfactory and most peripheral autonomic neurons, and for the 
formation of distinct neuronal circuits within the central nervous system. We 
have previously shown that HASH-1 is expressed in neuroblastoma tumors and cell 
lines, and in this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate 
HASH-1 interacting proteins from a human neuroblastoma cDNA library. Two of the 
isolated clones contained cDNA from the E2-2 gene (also known as ITF2/SEF2-1). 
We show that E2-2 interacts with HASH-1 in both yeast and mammalian cells. The 
HASH-1/E2-2 complex binds an E-box (CACCTG) in vitro, and transactivates an 
E-box containing reporter construct in vivo. Furthermore, E2-2 seems to be one 
of the major HASH-1 interacting proteins in extracts from neuroblastoma cells. 
In conclusion, E2-2 forms a functional complex with HASH-1, and might therefore 
be involved in the development of specific parts of the central and peripheral 
nervous systems.
