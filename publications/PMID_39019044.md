Mitochondria are essential regulators of innate immunity. They generate long 
mitochondrial double-stranded RNAs (mt-dsRNAs) and release them into the cytosol 
to trigger an immune response under pathological stress conditions. Yet the 
regulation of these self-immunogenic RNAs remains largely unknown. Here, we 
employ CRISPR screening on mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA)-binding proteins and 
identify NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 4 (NSUN4) as a key regulator of mt-dsRNA 
expression in human cells. We find that NSUN4 induces 5-methylcytosine (m5C) 
modification on mtRNAs, especially on the termini of light-strand long noncoding 
RNAs. These m5C-modified RNAs are recognized by complement C1q-binding protein 
(C1QBP), which recruits polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase to facilitate 
RNA turnover. Suppression of NSUN4 or C1QBP results in increased mt-dsRNA 
expression, while C1QBP deficiency also leads to increased cytosolic mt-dsRNAs 
and subsequent immune activation. Collectively, our study unveils the mechanism 
underlying the selective degradation of light-strand mtRNAs and establishes a 
molecular mark for mtRNA decay and cytosolic release.
