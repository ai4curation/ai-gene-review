FBXO25 is one of the 68 human F-box proteins that serve as specificity factors 
for a family of ubiquitin ligases composed of s-phase-kinase associated protein 
1, really interesting new gene-box 1, Cullin 1, and F-box protein (SCF1) that 
are involved in targeting proteins for destruction across the ubiquitin 
proteasome system. We recently reported that the FBXO25 protein accumulates in 
novel subnuclear structures named FBXO25-associated nuclear domains (FAND). 
Combining two-step affinity purification followed by MS with a classical 
two-hybrid screen, we identified 132 novel potential FBXO25 interacting 
partners. One of the identified proteins, beta-actin, physically interacts 
through its N-terminus with FBXO25 and is enriched in the FBXO25 nuclear 
compartments. Inhibitors of actin polymerization promote a significant 
disruption of FAND, indicating that they are compartments influenced by the 
organizational state of actin in the nucleus. Furthermore, FBXO25 antibodies 
interfered with RNA polymerase II transcription in vitro. Our results open new 
perspectives for the understanding of this novel compartment and its nuclear 
functions.

Abstract

FBXO25 is one of 68 human F-box proteins that serve as specificity factors for a family of ubiquitin ligases composed of Skp1, Rbx1, Cullin1 and F-box protein (SCF1) that are involved in targeting proteins for destruction across the ubiquitin proteasome system. We recently reported that the FBXO25 protein accumulates in novel subnuclear structures named FBXO25-associated nuclear domains (FANDs). Combining two-step affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry with a classical two-hybrid screen, we identified 132 novel potential FBXO25 interacting partners. One of the identified proteins, β-actin, physically interacts through its N-terminus with FBXO25 and is enriched in the FBXO25 nuclear compartments. Inhibitors of actin polymerization promote a significant disruption of FANDs, indicating that they are compartments influenced by the organizational state of actin in the nucleus. Furthermore, FBXO25 antibodies interfered with RNA polymerase II transcription in vitro . Our results open new perspectives for the understanding of this novel compartment and its nuclear functions.

Introduction

The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays important roles in a variety of cellular functions, controlling the levels of crucial intracellular regulatory proteins including transcription factors and cell cycle regulatory proteins [ 1 ]. UPS protein substrates are targeted for degradation by covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub), which is mediated by an enzymatic cascade consisting of three steps involving Ub activating (E1), Ub conjugating (E2) and Ub ligating (E3) enzymes. Subsequently, Ub-conjugated proteins are degraded by the 26S-proteasome complex [ 2 ]. E3s are critical players in this system because of their roles in substrate recognition.

The largest family of E3 comprises the cullin-really interesting new gene (RING) complexes whose prototype is the SCF1 complex, composed of the invariable components cullin 1 (CUL1), s-phase-kinase associated protein 1 (Skp1), RING-box 1 (RBX1)/regulator of cullin 1 (ROC1), and an interchangeable component known as an F-box protein (FBP) [ 3 ]. In addition to the F-box motif that binds to Skp1, FBP contains distinct protein-protein interaction domains that function in substrate recognition. Posttranslational modifications, such as protein phosphorylation, prolylhydroxylation, or glycosylation are important in regulating interactions of a potential substrate with the FBP [ 4 ]. SCF1-mediated ubiquitination is also regulated by mechanisms that involve both site-specific modification of the cullin 1 protein by the small Ub-like protein Nedd8, and CAND1 (cullin-associated Nedd8-dissociated 1)[ 5 - 7 ].

Previously, we demonstrated that the FBXO25, the closest paralog of atrogin-1, has the properties of an E3 of the SCF class [ 8 , 9 ]. Our biochemical studies have indicated that FBXO25 protein was present in all mouse tissues except striated muscle [ 10 ]. Furthermore, immunochemical visualization of FBXO25 in cultured cells has revealed that the protein is found in the nucleus, either diffusely spread or arranged in dot-like structures, the FANDs [ 10 ]. In the cell nucleus, FANDs are colocalized with the proteasome and ubiquitinated proteins. Interestingly, inhibition of RNA polymerase I disrupted FANDs indicating that they are dynamic structures. In mammalian cells, FANDs recruited polyglutamine-containing proteins and prevented their accumulation in the nucleus [ 10 ]. Taken together, these data suggested that FBXO25 is a functional E3 ligase and that FANDs are competent sites of polyubiquitination in the nucleus.

Cells contain a large number of Ub system enzymes and substrates, but relatively few E3s have been examined for their specific targets and regulators [ 11 ]. In the present study, we employ a combination of two proteomics approaches, the classical yeast two-hybrid screen and modified tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis, to screen for potential FBXO25-interacting proteins. We show the utility of our strategies through confirmation of known subunits and a regulator of the SCF1, and the identification of various novel FBXO25 interacting proteins. We also report the copurification of β-actin, which appears to play an important role in organizing FBXO25 distribution in the nucleus of HEK293H cells.

Discussion

FBPs are components of E3 Ub ligases responsible for recruitment of an extensive range of substrates of ubiquitination and are, therefore, likely to play important roles in various cellular processes. Indeed, several FBPs, such as FBXL1 and FBXW7, have been shown to be involved in regulating proliferation and differentiation of various cell types [ 29 ]. However, the biological functions of the majority of them, including FBXO25, remain uncharacterized. Thus, elucidating the interactions of FBPs with protein partners of known function is essential in further understanding of their cellular function.

Here we describe a novel TAP tagged protein that is compatible with two-step purification under native conditions. Although two-step TAP strategies have been proven to be successful in avoiding contaminants, it should be cautioned that there is a possibility that some of these proteins bind nonspecifically to FBXO25. We demonstrate the efficiency of the GF-TAP-FBXO25 strategy coupled to mass spectrometry through confirmation of known subunits and regulators of the SCF1 complex. Moreover, this strategy has identified a broad spectrum of potential interacting proteins. Among these, β-actin, which was confirmed genetically by YTHS, is of particular interest for the elucidation of FANDs regulation since β-actin is involved in gene expression [ 30 ].

The actin present in the cell nucleus is predominantly in a monomeric globular (G)-actin or short oligomeric form [ 31 , 32 ]. Nuclear actin functions as a key regulatory protein required for RNA transcription, chromatin remodeling, and RNA/protein transport. Importantly, actin is found in the cell nucleus arranged in peculiar foci structures [ 33 ]. Some of these actin enriched structures colocalize in part with p80 coilin-positive Cajal bodies [ 26 ]. Here, we found a pool of nuclear actin, probably distinct from Cajal bodies [ 10 ], which colocalizes and accumulates in FANDs. This argues for multifunctional actin interacting with different components of the cell nucleus.

Cajal bodies are very sensitive to the loss of actin from these structures. Adenovirus infection, which relocates nuclear actin to the periphery of the nucleus, resulted in a disruption of Cajal bodies [ 26 ]. Interestingly, actin polymerization is also required for reorganization of the speckles [ 16 ]. Our studies showed that FANDs were dispersed and that the FBXO25 redistributed within the nucleosplasm after treatment with drugs that depolymerize actin, suggesting that nuclear actin oligomers and/or polymers play a role in the formation of FANDs and probably in its nuclear function.

In addition, the cell nucleus contains profilin, cofilin, non-muscle myosins, gelsolin, and flightless, proteins know to be modulators of actin dynamics [ 34 - 36 ]. All of them, except profilin, were found in the GF-TAP-FBXO25 eluate ( Supplemental Table 1 ), supporting the idea of a cooperative complex. It remains to be shown whether these interactions regulate FANDs formation.

In summary, the integrated proteomics approach described here to identify protein-protein interactions in FBXO25 represents an applicable strategy for identifying protein complexes from mammalian cells. We provide direct biological, genetic, and biochemical evidence that β-actin physically interacts with FBXO25 and to somehow regulates FANDs formation.
