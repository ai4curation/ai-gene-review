Individual members of the RGK family of Ras-related GTPases, which comprise Rad, 
Gem/Kir, Rem and Rem2, have been implicated in important functions such as the 
regulation of voltage-gated calcium channel activity and remodeling of cell 
shape. The GTPase Kir/Gem inhibits the activity of calcium channels by 
interacting with the beta-subunit and also regulates cytoskeleton dynamics by 
inhibiting the Rho-Rho kinase pathway. In addition, Kir/Gem interacts with 
14-3-3 and calmodulin, but the significance of this interaction on Kir/Gem 
function is poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the 
binding of 14-3-3 and calmodulin to Kir/Gem. We show that 14-3-3, in conjunction 
with calmodulin, regulates the subcellular distribution of Kir/Gem between the 
cytoplasm and the nucleus. In addition, 14-3-3 and calmodulin binding modulate 
Kir/Gem-mediated cell shape remodeling and downregulation of calcium channel 
activity. Competition experiments show that binding of 14-3-3, calmodulin and 
calcium channel beta-subunits to Kir/Gem is mutually exclusive, providing a 
rationale for the observed regulatory effects of 14-3-3 and calmodulin on 
Kir/Gem localization and function.
