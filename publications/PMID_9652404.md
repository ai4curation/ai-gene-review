Agrin is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan involved in the development of the 
neuromuscular junction during embryogenesis. In addition to this 
well-characterized function, agrin may have additional functions in other 
tissues and during other stages in development. In this study we present the 
cDNA sequence of human agrin, and demonstrate a high agrin content in adult 
basement membranes. The N-terminal domain of human agrin is highly similar to 
that of chick agrin, suggesting a similar function in laminin binding. The 
presence of three SGXG sequences supports serine-linked glycosylation of the 
core protein, two sites being particularly favorable for heparan sulfate 
attachment. Comparison of levels of agrin mRNA in fetal and adult human tissues 
showed a remarkable upregulation in adult kidney and lung. In both tissues 
truncated agrin transcripts were detected, lacking the region that encodes the 
laminin-binding domain. The high transcription levels in lung and kidney 
corresponded with the accumulation of agrin in the alveolar and glomerular 
basement membranes, suggesting a filtration-associated function. These data 
provide new directions for investigating the role of agrin in its different 
physiological environments, including the basement membranes of the 
neuromuscular junction, kidney and lung.
