A novel Ig superfamily protein, EWI-2, was co-purified with tetraspanin protein 
CD81 under relatively stringent Brij 96 detergent conditions and identified by 
mass spectrometric protein sequencing. EWI-2 associated specifically with CD9 
and CD81 but not with other tetraspanins or with integrins. Immunodepletion 
experiments indicated that EWI-2-CD9/CD81 interactions are highly 
stoichiometric, with approximately 70% of CD9 and CD81 associated with EWI-2 in 
an embryonic kidney cell line. The EWI-2 molecule was covalently cross-linked 
(in separate complexes) to both CD81 and CD9, suggesting that association is 
direct. EWI-2 is part of a novel Ig subfamily that includes EWI-F (F2alpha 
receptor regulatory protein (FPRP), CD9P-1), EWI-3 (IgSF3), and EWI-101 (CD101). 
All four members of this Ig subfamily contain a Glu-Trp-Ile (EWI) motif not seen 
in other Ig proteins. As shown previously, the EWI-F molecule likewise forms 
highly proximal, specific, and stoichiometric complexes with CD9 and CD81. Human 
and murine EWI-2 protein sequences are 91% identical, and transcripts in the two 
species are expressed in virtually every tissue tested. Thus, EWI-2 potentially 
contributes to a variety of CD9 and CD81 functions seen in different cell and 
tissue types.
