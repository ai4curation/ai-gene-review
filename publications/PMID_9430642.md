The nuclear receptor (NR) coactivator TIF2 possesses a single NR interaction 
domain (NID) and two autonomous activation domains, AD1 and AD2. The TIF2 NID is 
composed of three NR-interacting modules each containing the NR box motif LxxLL. 
Mutation of boxes I, II and III abrogates TIF2-NR interaction and stimulation, 
in transfected cells, of the ligand-induced activation function-2 (AF-2) present 
in the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of several NRs. The presence of an intact 
NR interaction module II in the NID is sufficient for both efficient interaction 
with NR holo-LBDs and stimulation of AF-2 activity. Modules I and III are poorly 
efficient on their own, but synergistically can promote interaction with NR 
holo-LBDs and AF-2 stimulation. TIF2 AD1 activity appears to be mediated through 
CBP, as AD1 could not be separated mutationally from the CBP interaction domain. 
In contrast, TIF2 AD2 activity apparently does not involve interaction with CBP. 
TIF2 exhibited the characteristics expected for a bona fide NR coactivator, in 
both mammalian and yeast cells. Moreover, in mammalian cells, a peptide 
encompassing the TIF2 NID inhibited the ligand-induced AF-2 activity of several 
NRs, indicating that NR AF-2 activity is either mediated by endogenous TIF2 or 
by coactivators recognizing a similar surface on NR holo-LBDs.
