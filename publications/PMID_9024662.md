The protein p53 is a key tumour-suppressor, as evidenced by its frequent 
inactivation in human cancers. Animal models have indicated that attenuation of 
p53-dependent cell death (apoptosis) can contribute to both the initiation and 
progression of cancer, but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Although 
p53-mediated transcriptional activation is one possible explanation, none of the 
known p53-responsive genes has been shown to function in p53-dependent 
apoptosis. Here we test the role of the death-promoting gene bax in a transgenic 
mouse brain tumour, a model in which p53-mediated apoptosis attenuates tumour 
growth. Inactivation of p53 causes a dramatic acceleration of tumour growth 
owing to a reduction in apoptosis of over ninety per cent. We show that 
p53-dependent expression of bax is induced in slow-growing apoptotic tumours. 
Moreover, tumour growth is accelerated and apoptosis drops by fifty per cent in 
Bax-deficient mice, indicating that it is required for a full p53-mediated 
response. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that Bax acts as a 
tumour suppressor, and our findings indicate that Bax could be a component of 
the p53-mediated apoptotic response in this system.
