BACKGROUND: Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation plays an important role in 
the development of atherosclerosis. We previously reported that adiponectin, an 
adipocyte-specific plasma protein, accumulated in the human injured artery and 
suppressed endothelial inflammatory response as well as macrophage-to-foam cell 
transformation. The present study investigated the effects of adiponectin on 
proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). 
Methods and Results- HASMC proliferation was estimated by [(3)H] thymidine 
uptake and cell number. Cell migration assay was performed using a Boyden 
chamber. Physiological concentrations of adiponectin significantly suppressed 
both proliferation and migration of HASMCs stimulated with platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF)-BB. Adiponectin specifically bound to (125)I-PDGF-BB and 
significantly inhibited the association of (125)I-PDGF-BB with HASMCs, but no 
effects were observed on the binding of (125)I-PDGF-AA or (125)I-heparin-binding 
epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF) to HASMCs. Adiponectin 
strongly and dose-dependently suppressed PDGF-BB-induced p42/44 extracellular 
signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and PDGF beta-receptor 
autophosphorylation analyzed by immunoblot. Adiponectin also reduced 
PDGF-AA-stimulated or HB-EGF-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent 
manner without affecting autophosphorylation of PDGF alpha-receptor or EGF 
receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: The adipocyte-derived plasma protein adiponectin strongly 
suppressed HASMC proliferation and migration through direct binding with PDGF-BB 
and generally inhibited growth factor-stimulated ERK signal in HASMCs, 
suggesting that adiponectin acts as a modulator for vascular remodeling.
