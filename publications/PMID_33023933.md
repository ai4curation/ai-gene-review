Most mammalian cytoplasmic tRNAs contain ribothymidine (T) and pseudouridine (Ψ) 
at positions 54 and 55, respectively. However, some tRNAs contain Ψ at both 
positions. Several Ψ54-containing tRNAs function as primers in retroviral DNA 
synthesis. The Ψ54 of these tRNAs is produced by PUS10, which can also 
synthesize Ψ55. Two other enzymes, TRUB1 and TRUB2, can also produce Ψ55. By 
nearest-neighbor analyses of tRNAs treated with recombinant proteins and 
subcellular extracts of wild-type and specific Ψ55 synthase knockdown cells, we 
determined that while TRUB1, PUS10, and TRUB2 all have tRNA Ψ55 synthase 
activities, they have different tRNA structural requirements. Moreover, these 
activities are primarily present in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, 
respectively, suggesting a compartmentalization of Ψ55 synthase activity. TRUB1 
produces the Ψ55 of most elongator tRNAs, but cytoplasmic PUS10 produces both Ψs 
of the tRNAs with Ψ54Ψ55. The nuclear isoform of PUS10 is catalytically inactive 
and specifically binds the unmodified U54U55 versions of Ψ54Ψ55-containing 
tRNAs, as well as the A54U55-containing tRNAiMet This binding inhibits 
TRUB1-mediated U55 to Ψ55 conversion in the nucleus. Consequently, the U54U55 of 
Ψ54Ψ55-containing tRNAs are modified by the cytoplasmic PUS10. Nuclear PUS10 
does not bind the U55 versions of T54Ψ55- and A54Ψ55-containing elongator tRNAs. 
Therefore, TRUB1 is able to produce Ψ55 in these tRNAs. In summary, the tRNA Ψ55 
synthase activities of TRUB1 and PUS10 are not redundant but rather are 
compartmentalized and act on different sets of tRNAs. The significance of this 
compartmentalization needs further study.
