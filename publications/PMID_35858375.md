The ability to produce folded and functional proteins is a necessity for 
structural biology and many other biological sciences. This task is particularly 
challenging for numerous biomedically important targets in human cells, 
including membrane proteins and large macromolecular assemblies, hampering 
mechanistic studies and drug development efforts. Here we describe a method 
combining CRISPR-Cas gene editing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to 
rapidly tag and purify endogenous proteins in HEK cells for structural 
characterization. We applied this approach to study the human proteasome from 
HEK cells and rapidly determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of 
major proteasomal complexes, including a high-resolution structure of intact 
human PA28αβ-20S. Our structures reveal that PA28 with a subunit stoichiometry 
of 3α/4β engages tightly with the 20S proteasome. Addition of a hydrophilic 
peptide shows that polypeptides entering through PA28 are held in the 
antechamber of 20S prior to degradation in the proteolytic chamber. This study 
provides critical insights into an important proteasome complex and demonstrates 
key methodologies for the tagging of proteins from endogenous sources.
