RNase H2 cleaves RNA sequences that are part of RNA/DNA hybrids or that are 
incorporated into DNA, thus, preventing genomic instability and the accumulation 
of aberrant nucleic acid, which in humans induces Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a 
severe autoimmune disorder. The 3.1 Å crystal structure of human RNase H2 
presented here allowed us to map the positions of all 29 mutations found in 
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome patients, several of which were not visible in the 
previously reported mouse RNase H2. We propose the possible effects of these 
mutations on the protein stability and function. Bacterial and eukaryotic RNases 
H2 differ in composition and substrate specificity. Bacterial RNases H2 are 
monomeric proteins and homologs of the eukaryotic RNases H2 catalytic subunit, 
which in addition possesses two accessory proteins. The eukaryotic RNase H2 
heterotrimeric complex recognizes RNA/DNA hybrids and (5')RNA-DNA(3')/DNA 
junction hybrids as substrates with similar efficiency, whereas bacterial RNases 
H2 are highly specialized in the recognition of the (5')RNA-DNA(3') junction and 
very poorly cleave RNA/DNA hybrids in the presence of Mg(2+) ions. Using the 
crystal structure of the Thermotoga maritima RNase H2-substrate complex, we 
modeled the human RNase H2-substrate complex and verified the model by 
mutational analysis. Our model indicates that the difference in substrate 
preference stems from the different position of the crucial tyrosine residue 
involved in substrate binding and recognition.
