The MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) plays critical roles in 
diverse cellular processes, such as the epigenetic regulation of gene 
expression. Lysine autoacetylation of the MYST HATs has recently received 
considerable attention. Nonetheless, the mechanism and function of the 
autoacetylation process are not well defined. To better understand the 
biochemical mechanism of MYST autoacetylation and the impact of autoacetylation 
on the cognate histone acetylation, we carried out detailed analyses of 
males-absent-on-the-first (MOF), a key member of the MYST family. A number of 
mutant MOF proteins were produced with point mutations at several key residues 
near the active site of the enzyme. Autoradiography and immunoblotting data 
showed that mutation of these residues affects the autoacetylation activity and 
HAT activity of MOF by various degrees demonstrating that MOF activity is highly 
sensitive to the chemical changes in those residues. We produced MOF protein in 
the deacetylated form by using a nonspecific lysine deacetylase. Interestingly, 
both the autoacetylation activity and the histone acetylation activity of the 
deacetylated MOF were found to be very close to that of wild-type MOF, 
suggesting that autoacetylation of MOF only marginally modulates the enzymatic 
activity. Also, we found that the autoacetylation rates of MOF and deacetylated 
MOF were much slower than the cognate substrate acetylation. Thus, 
autoacetylation does not seem to contribute to the intrinsic enzymatic activity 
in a significant manner. These data provide new insights into the mechanism and 
function of MYST HAT autoacetylation.
