Proteomic analyses of different subcellular compartments, so-called organellar 
proteomics, facilitate the understanding of cellular functions on a molecular 
level. In this work, various orthogonal multidimensional separation techniques 
both on the protein and on the peptide level are compared with regard to the 
number of identified proteins as well as the classes of proteins accessible by 
the respective methodology. The most complete overview was achieved by a 
combination of such orthogonal techniques as shown by the analysis of the yeast 
mitochondrial proteome. A total of 851 different proteins (PROMITO dataset) were 
identified by use of multidimensional LC-MS/MS, 1D-SDS-PAGE combined with 
nano-LC-MS/MS and 2D-PAGE with subsequent MALDI-mass fingerprinting. Our PROMITO 
approach identified the 749 proteins, which were found in the largest previous 
study on the yeast mitochondrial proteome, and additionally 102 proteins 
including 42 open reading frames with unknown function, providing the basis for 
a more detailed elucidation of mitochondrial processes. Comparison of the 
different approaches emphasizes a bias of 2D-PAGE against proteins with very 
high isoelectric points as well as large and hydrophobic proteins, which can be 
accessed more appropriately by the other methods. While 2D-PAGE has advantages 
in the possible separation of protein isoforms and quantitative differential 
profiling, 1D-SDS-PAGE with nano-LC-MS/MS and multidimensional LC-MS/MS are 
better suited for efficient protein identification as they are less biased 
against distinct classes of proteins. Thus, comprehensive proteome analyses can 
only be realized by a combination of such orthogonal approaches, leading to the 
largest dataset available for the mitochondrial proteome of yeast.
