Telomere dysfunction may result in chromosomal abnormalities, DNA damage 
responses, and even cancer. Early studies in lower organisms have helped to 
establish the crucial role of telomerase and telomeric proteins in maintaining 
telomere length and protecting telomere ends. In Oxytricha nova, telomere 
G-overhangs are protected by the TEBP-alpha/beta heterodimer. Human telomeres 
contain duplex telomeric repeats with 3' single-stranded G-overhangs, and may 
fold into a t-loop structure that helps to shield them from being recognized as 
DNA breaks. Additionally, the TEBP-alpha homologue, POT1, which binds telomeric 
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), associates with multiple telomeric proteins (for 
example, TPP1, TIN2, TRF1, TRF2 and RAP1) to form the six-protein 
telosome/shelterin and other subcomplexes. These telomeric protein complexes in 
turn interact with diverse pathways to form the telomere interactome for 
telomere maintenance. However, the mechanisms by which the POT1-containing 
telosome communicates with telomerase to regulate telomeres remain to be 
elucidated. Here we demonstrate that TPP1 is a putative mammalian homologue of 
TEBP-beta and contains a predicted amino-terminal 
oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold. TPP1-POT1 association 
enhanced POT1 affinity for telomeric ssDNA. In addition, the TPP1 OB fold, as 
well as POT1-TPP1 binding, seemed critical for POT1-mediated telomere-length 
control and telomere-end protection in human cells. Disruption of POT1-TPP1 
interaction by dominant negative TPP1 expression or RNA interference (RNAi) 
resulted in telomere-length alteration and DNA damage responses. Furthermore, we 
offer evidence that TPP1 associates with the telomerase in a 
TPP1-OB-fold-dependent manner, providing a physical link between telomerase and 
the telosome/shelterin complex. Our findings highlight the critical role of TPP1 
in telomere maintenance, and support a yin-yang model in which TPP1 and POT1 
function as a unit to protect human telomeres, by both positively and negatively 
regulating telomerase access to telomere DNA.
