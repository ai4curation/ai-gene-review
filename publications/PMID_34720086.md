Although serine metabolism plays a crucial role in the proliferation and 
survival of tumor cells, how it supports tumor cell migration remains poorly 
understood. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) catalyzes the oxidation of 
3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphonooxypyruvate, the first committed step in de 
novo serine biosynthesis. Here we show that PHGDH was monoubiquitinated by 
cullin 4A-based E3 ligase complex at lysine 146 in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
cells, which enhanced PHGDH activity by recruiting a chaperone protein, DnaJ 
homolog subfamily A member 1, to promote its tetrameric formation, thereby 
increasing the levels of serine, glycine, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). 
Increased levels of SAM upregulated the expression of cell adhesion genes 
(laminin subunit gamma 2 and cysteine rich angiogenic inducer 61) by initiating 
SET domain containing 1A-mediated trimethylation of histone H3K4, thereby 
promoting tumor cell migration and CRC metastasis. Intriguingly, SAM levels in 
tumors or blood samples correlated with the metastatic recurrence of patients 
with CRC. Our finding not only reveals a potentially new role and mechanism of 
SAM-promoted tumor metastasis but also demonstrates a regulatory mechanism of 
PHGDH activity by monoubiquitination.
