Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) plays critical roles in Ig class 
switch recombination and V(H) gene somatic hypermutation. We investigated the 
role of IL-4 in AID mRNA induction, the signaling transduction involved in 
IL-4-mediated AID induction, and the effect of CD45 on IL-4-dependent AID 
expression in human B cells. IL-4 was able to induce AID expression in human 
primary B cells and B cell lines, and IL-4-induced AID expression was further 
enhanced by CD40 signaling. IL-4-dependent AID induction was inhibited by a 
dominant-negative STAT6, indicating that IL-4 induced AID expression via the 
Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT6 signaling pathway. Moreover, triggering of CD45 with 
anti-CD45 Abs can inhibit IL-4-induced AID expression, and this CD45-mediated 
AID inhibition correlated with the ability of anti-CD45 to suppress 
IL-4-activated JAK1, JAK3, and STAT6 phosphorylations. Thus, in humans, IL-4 
alone is sufficient to drive AID expression, and CD40 signaling is required for 
optimal AID production; IL-4-induced AID expression is mediated via the JAK/STAT 
signaling pathway, and can be negatively regulated by the JAK phosphatase 
activity of CD45. This study indicates that the JAK phosphatase activity of CD45 
can be induced by anti-CD45 Ab treatment, and this principle may find clinical 
application in modulation of JAK activation in immune-mediated diseases.
