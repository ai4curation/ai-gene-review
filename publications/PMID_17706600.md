The yeast transcriptional regulator Hap1 promotes both transcriptional 
activation and repression. Previous studies have shown that Hap1 binds to the 
promoter of its own gene and represses its transcription. In this report, we 
identified the DNA site that allows Hap1-binding with high affinity. This 
Hap1-binding site contains only one CGG triplet and is distinct from the typical 
Hap1-binding upstream activation sequences (UASs) mediating transcriptional 
activation. Furthermore, at the HAP1 promoter, Ssa is bound to DNA with Hap1, 
whereas Hsp90 is not bound. Intriguingly, we found that histone deacetylases, 
including Rpd3, Hda1, Sin3 and Hos1, are not required for the repression of the 
HAP1 gene by Hap1. Rather, they are required for transcriptional activation of 
the HAP1 promoter, and this requirement is dependent on the HAP1 basal promoter. 
These results reveal a complex mechanism of transcriptional regulation at the 
HAP1 promoter, involving multiple DNA elements and regulatory proteins.
