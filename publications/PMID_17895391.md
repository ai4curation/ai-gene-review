Circadian rhythms can be regulated by many environmental and endogenous factors. 
We show here a sensitivity of circadian clock function to oxidative stress that 
is revealed in flies lacking the foxo gene product. When exposed to oxidative 
stress, wild-type flies showed attenuated clock gene cycling in peripheral 
tissues, whereas foxo mutants also lost behavioral rhythms driven by the central 
clock. FOXO is expressed predominantly in the fat body, and transgenic 
expression in this tissue rescued the mutant behavioral phenotype, suggesting 
that foxo has non-cell-autonomous effects on central circadian clock function. 
Overexpression of signaling molecules that affect FOXO activity, such as the 
insulin receptor or Akt, in the fat body also increased susceptibility of the 
central clock to oxidative stress. Finally, foxo mutants showed a rapid decline 
in rest:activity rhythms with age, supporting the idea that the increase of 
oxidative stress contributes to age-associated degeneration of behavioral 
rhythms and indicating the importance of FOXO in mitigating this deterioration. 
Together these data demonstrate that metabolism affects central clock function 
and provide a link among insulin signaling, oxidative stress, aging, and 
circadian rhythms.
