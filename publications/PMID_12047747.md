The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) supplies peptides into 
the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for binding by major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. TAP comprises two 
polypeptides, TAP1 and TAP2, each a 'half-transporter' encoding a transmembrane 
domain and a nucleotide-binding domain. Immunoprecipitation of rat TAP1 and TAP2 
expressed individually in the human TAP-deficient cell line, T2, revealed that 
both bound the endogenously expressed HLA-A2 and -B51 class I molecules. Using 
HLA-encoding recombinant vaccinia viruses HLA-A*2501, -B*2704, -B*3501 and 
-B*4402, alleles also associated with both TAP1 and TAP2. Thus, TAP1 and TAP2 do 
not appear to differ in their ability to interact with MHC class I alleles. 
Single TAP polypeptide subunits also formed MHC class I peptide-loading 
complexes, and their nucleotide-binding domains retained the ability to interact 
with ATP, and may permit the release of peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules in 
the absence of a peptide transport cycle. It is also demonstrated by chemical 
cross-linking that TAP2, but not TAP1, has the ability to form a homodimer 
complex both in whole cells and in detergent lysates. Together these data 
indicate that single TAP polypeptide subunits possess many of the features of 
the TAP heterodimer, demonstrating them to be useful models in the study of 
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.

Abstract

The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) supplies peptides into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for binding by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. TAP comprises two polypeptides, TAP1 and TAP2, each a ‘half-transporter’ encoding a transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain. Immunoprecipitation of rat TAP1 and TAP2 expressed individually in the human TAP-deficient cell line, T2, revealed that both bound the endogenously expressed HLA-A2 and -B51 class I molecules. Using HLA-encoding recombinant vaccinia viruses HLA-A*2501, -B*2704, -B*3501 and -B*4402, alleles also associated with both TAP1 and TAP2. Thus, TAP1 and TAP2 do not appear to differ in their ability to interact with MHC class I alleles. Single TAP polypeptide subunits also formed MHC class I peptide-loading complexes, and their nucleotide-binding domains retained the ability to interact with ATP, and may permit the release of peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules in the absence of a peptide transport cycle. It is also demonstrated by chemical cross-linking that TAP2, but not TAP1, has the ability to form a homodimer complex both in whole cells and in detergent lysates. Together these data indicate that single TAP polypeptide subunits possess many of the features of the TAP heterodimer, demonstrating them to be useful models in the study of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.

Introduction

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules require peptide for stable cell-surface expression, acquiring relevant peptides during assembly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Such peptides, generated mostly by the activity of the cytosolic proteasome complex, are translocated in an ATP-dependent manner into the ER by an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, termed transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). 1 – 3 This ER-located member of the ABC transporter 4 family comprises a heterodimer of TAP1 and TAP2 polypeptides, each encoding an N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) with multiple transmembrane spanning regions, and a C-terminal region encoding a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). TAP is crucial in the assembly process of MHC class I molecules: in its absence MHC class I assembly is severely impaired. Furthermore, it can act as a hub where up to four non-peptide-loaded class I molecules, with associated accessory molecules, sit awaiting suitable peptides. 5 – 9

The peptide transport specificity of TAP has been studied extensively in several species 2 , 10 and initial studies have started to identify the peptide-binding site. 11 – 13 The peptide transport process is strictly ATP dependent. 3 However, the mechanism by which peptide-loaded class I molecules dissociate from TAP is less clear. Recent data suggest the transmission of a signal from the NBD, allowing release of class I molecules, thus linking the active transport cycle of TAP to the release of peptide-loaded class I molecules. 14 – 16

Most studies of TAP investigate the TAP heterodimer, however, and little is known about the behaviour of individual TAP1 or TAP2 polypeptide subunits. Although they are not active in peptide transport, 17 we have previously reported that both single TAP1 and TAP2 molecules retain the ability to interact with MHC class I molecules and chaperones. 18 Thus, they represent a simplified model for using to study some of the interactions that TAP can undertake. The data we present here demonstrates that single TAP polypeptide subunits interact with a wide variety of MHC molecules and retain features comparable to when present in the heterodimeric TAP complex. Single TAP polypeptide subunits therefore represent useful models to assist in our understanding of the TAP complex and ABC transporters in general.

Discussion

TAP has been studied extensively and we know it to be an ER-resident, ATP-dependent peptide pump, with a promiscuous binding site formed combinatorially by intracellular loops of TAP1 and TAP2 subunits. 3 , 31 – 33 More recently the mechanisms which regulate TAP function have begun to be dissected, revealing complexity in the cycle of nucleotide hydrolysis and release of peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules. 14 , 16 , 34 In this study we set out to investigate the characteristics of single TAP subunits, about which relatively little are known in comparison to the TAP heterodimer.

We extended our original observations on the ability of single TAP1 and TAP2 subunits to interact with MHC class I molecules. 18 Multiple HLA alleles were found to be able to form interactions with both subunits. Thus neither TAP1 nor TAP2 seem capable of distinguishing or selecting what MHC class I molecule they are interacting with. This implies that tapasin bears responsibility for determining the success of the TAP–MHC interaction, and that inefficient interaction with TAP by some HLA alleles is caused solely by weak MHC class I–tapasin interactions. 35 , 36 The binding site for MHC class I–tapasin complexes on TAP is not currently known; however, our data suggest that any potential site(s) on both TAP1 and TAP2 share similar features. We have been unable to verify the number of MHC class I complexes associated with each TAP subunit in this study because TAPs failed to resolve in the two-dimensional gels under conditions where MHC class I and chaperones did resolve. Nevertheless, our data suggest that class I MHC, calreticulin, ERp57 and tapasin are present at essentially equimolar ratios when associated with TAP. 8

Our observations that HLA-A2 molecules have low steady-state levels of association with single TAP subunits were somewhat unexpected, based on our initial metabolic labelling and immunoprecipitation experiments. Mutagenesis of the nucleotide-binding sites on TAP1 and TAP2 has been shown to prevent both peptide transport and dissociation of MHC class I molecules. 14 We therefore expected a failure of MHC class I dissociation to occur in individual TAP1 and TAP2 subunits where no peptide transport occurs. Our observation, that LLnL (which can inhibit protease activity in the ER; see ref. 27 ) reduced A2 dissociation, suggests that the loading of ER-derived, probably signal sequence, peptides may be the cause of the A2 dissociation. The fact that single TAP subunits also retained some ability to bind ATP suggests that retention of an ATP-binding (though non-hydrolysing) NBD maintains a conformation of the whole TAP subunit, which permits the dissociation of MHC class I molecules upon loading with suitable peptide. Densitometry analysis of the results in Fig. 5 , combined with other similar experiments (data not shown), suggest that the individually expressed TAP1 and TAP2 subunits can bind to ATP-agarose beads at between 40 and 70% of the level of the TAP heterodimer, although considerable variation occurs between experiments. Further detailed analysis would need to be performed to more accurately assess the ATP-binding capacity of the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits. Furthermore, the stability of the individual TAP chains appears to differ. In pulse–chase experiments of T2rTAP1 and T2rTAP2 cells, the TAP2 polypeptide is degraded more rapidly than TAP1 (S. J. Powis, unpublished). We are also currently investigating, by the use of ER-targeted minigene constructs and membrane-translocating ‘trojan’ carrier peptides, 37 whether we can also induce the dissociation of B51 molecules from individual TAP1 or TAP2 subunits.

The potential for homodimeric structures of TAP1 and TAP2 arises from the significant homology shared by these two polypeptides and the fact that some ABC transporters do function as homodimers. Homodimeric interactions have been detected during expression of truncated TAP NBDs 29 and in chimeric TAPs, 28 although not in the crystal structure of the NBD of TAP1. 38 In the experiments reported here we used the chemical cross-linker EGS, which can cross-link heterodimeric TAP, to show the formation of a TAP2 homodimer. We did not detect a similar TAP1 homodimer, although this does not preclude its existence. The optimal proximity of suitable residues for EGS cross-linking may be available in rat TAP2, but not in rat TAP1, homodimers.

The formation of the heterodimeric EGS cross-linked TAP product was enhanced by TAP-binding peptides, but a high proportion of TAP remains non-cross-linked. 30 This suggests that in the presence of peptide there is closer proximity of some regions of the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits, and that the cross-linking may occur during distinct stages of the TAP cycle. The failure of peptide to enhance TAP2 homodimer cross-linking indicates that similar events do not occur in this structure.

We have recently performed single-image particle analysis by electron microscopy of the TAP heterodimer and the TAP2 subunit on its own to determine a three-dimensional structure for TAP. 19 We did not detect homodimeric TAP2 structures during that study, probably because our immunoaffinity-based purifications were performed in lysates containing Triton-X-100 which, as described here, do not appear to support the interactions of homodimeric TAP2 post-lysis. However, the use of EGS does provide us now with a method by which we may be able to isolate and perform single-particle image analysis on the TAP2 homodimer.

Crystallographic determination of the structure of TAP has not yet been achieved, and it is only very recently that a whole ABC transporter, the homodimeric MsbA from Escherichia coli , has been crystallised and the structure determined to 4.5 Å resolution. 39 The data we present here, in conjunction with our preliminary analysis by single-particle imaging of TAP2, 19 suggests that single TAP subunits retain sufficient structural integrity and similarities to when present in the TAP heterodimer, to make them ideal substrates for crystallographic studies and also for mutagenic studies to identify tapasin-binding sites.
