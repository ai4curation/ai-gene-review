Most organisms respond to heat by substantial alteration of the pattern of gene 
expression. This has been particularly well studied with Escherichia coli 
although the response has by no means been completely characterized. Here we 
report the characterization of 26 new heat shock genes of E. coli, termed hsl, 
discovered by global transcription analysis with an overlapping lambda clone 
bank. We have measured the molecular weights of the corresponding heat shock 
proteins and mapped each of them to within a few kilobases on the E. coli 
genome. In vitro, 16 of them can be activated by the E sigma 32 RNA polymerase, 
which specifically transcribes heat shock genes. In vivo expression kinetics of 
seven of eight examined new proteins were found to be similar to those of the 
four most studied heat shock proteins, DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL (MopA), and GroES 
(MopB). In the course of this work, we confirmed that the catalytic subunit of 
the ATP-dependent Clp protease (also known as Ti protease), ClpP, is derived 
from a larger precursor protein. Possible assignments of some of the hsl genes 
to known proteins are discussed.
