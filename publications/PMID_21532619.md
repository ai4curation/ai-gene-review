Human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of a fatal 
adult T-cell leukemia. Through deregulation of multiple cellular signaling 
pathways the viral Tax protein has a pivotal role in T-cell transformation. In 
response to stressful stimuli, cells mount a cellular stress response to limit 
the damage that environmental forces inflict on DNA or proteins. During stress 
response, cells postpone the translation of most cellular mRNAs, which are 
gathered into cytoplasmic mRNA-silencing foci called stress granules (SGs) and 
allocate their available resources towards the production of dedicated 
stress-management proteins. Here we demonstrate that Tax controls the formation 
of SGs and interferes with the cellular stress response pathway. In agreement 
with previous reports, we observed that Tax relocates from the nucleus to the 
cytoplasm in response to environmental stress. We found that the presence of Tax 
in the cytoplasm of stressed cells prevents the formation of SGs and counteracts 
the shutoff of specific host proteins. Unexpectedly, nuclear localization of Tax 
promotes spontaneous aggregation of SGs, even in the absence of stress. Mutant 
analysis revealed that the SG inhibitory capacity of Tax is independent of its 
transcriptional abilities but relies on its interaction with histone deacetylase 
6, a critical component of SGs. Importantly, the stress-protective effect of Tax 
was also observed in the context of HTLV-1 infected cells, which were shown to 
be less prone to form SGs and undergo apoptosis under arsenite exposure. These 
observations identify Tax as the first virally encoded inhibitory component of 
SGs and unravel a new strategy developed by HTLV-1 to deregulate normal cell 
processes. We postulate that inhibition of the stress response pathway by Tax 
would favor cell survival under stressful conditions and may have an important 
role in HTLV-1-induced cellular transformation.
