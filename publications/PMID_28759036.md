Vaccinia H1-related phosphatase (VHR/DUSP3) is a member of the dual-specificity 
phosphatase family. Deregulation of VHR is observed in various malignant 
diseases. We identified focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as a VHR-interacting 
molecule. Over-expression of VHR decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and 
decreasing VHR promoted FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. In vitro assays proved 
that recombinant VHR directly dephosphorylated FAK and paxillin. VHR-knockout 
mice did not have obvious abnormality; however, VHR-knockout cells showed 
decreased expression of integrins and FAK but stronger FAK and paxillin 
phosphorylation upon attachment to fibronectin. Additionally, VHR-knockout 
fibroblast and lung epithelial cells had elevated ligand-induced epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation. Inducible expression of VHR 
suppressed directional cell migration, and VHR deficiency resulted in a higher 
cell migratory ability. VHR-knockout cells have stronger FAK phosphorylation in 
cell adhesions, long-lasting trailing ends and slower turnover of focal 
adhesions. These collective data indicate that VHR is a FAK phosphatase and 
participates in regulating the formation and disassembly of focal adhesions.
