Heterotrimeric G proteins are implicated in diverse signaling processes in 
plants, but the molecular mechanisms of their function are largely unknown. 
Finding G protein effectors and regulatory proteins can help in understanding 
the roles of these signal transduction proteins in plants. A yeast two-hybrid 
screen was performed to search for proteins that interact with Arabidopsis G 
protein alpha-subunit (GPA1). One of the identified GPA1-interacting proteins is 
the cupin-domain protein AtPirin1. Pirin is a recently defined protein found 
because of its ability to interact with a CCAAT box binding transcription 
factor. The GPA1-AtPirin1 interaction was confirmed in an in vitro binding 
assay. We characterized two atpirin1 T-DNA insertional mutants and established 
that they display a set of phenotypes similar to those of gpa1 mutants, 
including reduced germination levels in the absence of stratification and an 
abscisic acid-imposed delay in germination and early seedling development. These 
data indicate that AtPirin1 likely functions immediately downstream of GPA1 in 
regulating seed germination and early seedling development.
