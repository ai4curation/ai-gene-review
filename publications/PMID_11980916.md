Multiprotein complexes are key determinants of Golgi apparatus structure and its 
capacity for intracellular transport and glycoprotein modification. Three 
complexes that have previously been partially characterized include (a) the 
Golgi transport complex (GTC), identified in an in vitro membrane transport 
assay, (b) the ldlCp complex, identified in analyses of CHO cell mutants with 
defects in Golgi-associated glycosylation reactions, and (c) the mammalian Sec34 
complex, identified by homology to yeast Sec34p, implicated in vesicular 
transport. We show that these three complexes are identical and rename them the 
conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. The COG complex comprises four 
previously characterized proteins (Cog1/ldlBp, Cog2/ldlCp, Cog3/Sec34, and 
Cog5/GTC-90), three homologues of yeast Sec34/35 complex subunits (Cog4, -6, and 
-8), and a previously unidentified Golgi-associated protein (Cog7). EM of ldlB 
and ldlC mutants established that COG is required for normal Golgi morphology. 
"Deep etch" EM of purified COG revealed an approximately 37-nm-long structure 
comprised of two similarly sized globular domains connected by smaller 
extensions. Consideration of biochemical and genetic data for mammalian COG and 
its yeast homologue suggests a model for the subunit distribution within this 
complex, which plays critical roles in Golgi structure and function.
