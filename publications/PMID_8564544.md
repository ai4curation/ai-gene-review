GroEL is a bacterial chaperonin of 14 identical subunits required to help fold 
newly synthesized proteins. The crystal structure of GroEL with ATP gamma S 
bound to each subunit shows that ATP binds to a novel pocket, whose primary 
sequence is highly conserved among chaperonins. Interaction of Mg2+ and ATP 
involves phosphate oxygens of the alpha-, beta- and gamma-phosphates, which is 
unique for known structures of nucleotide-binding proteins. Although bound ATP 
induces modest conformational shifts in the equatorial domain, the 
stereochemistry that functionally coordinates GroEL's affinity for nucleotides, 
polypeptide, and GroES remains uncertain.
