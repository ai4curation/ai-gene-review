An antibody highly specific for heat-shock protein (hsp)26, the unique small hsp 
of yeast, and mutants carrying a deletion of the HSP26 gene were used to examine 
the physical properties of the protein and to determine its intracellular 
distribution. The protein was found in complexes with a molecular mass of 
greater than 500 kD. Thus, it has all of the characteristics, including sequence 
homology and induction patterns, of small hsps from other organisms. When 
log-phase cells growing in glucose were heat shocked, hsp26 concentrated in 
nuclei and continued to concentrate in nuclei when these cells were returned to 
normal temperatures for recovery. However, hsp26 did not concentrate in nuclei 
under a variety of other conditions. For example, in early stationary-phase 
cells hsp26 is induced at normal growth temperatures. This protein was generally 
distributed throughout the cells, even after heat shock. Similarly, in cells 
genetically engineered to synthesize hsp26 in the presence of galactose, hsp26 
did not concentrate in nuclei, with or without a heat shock. To determine if the 
failure of hsp26 to concentrate in the nucleus of these cells was due to the 
fact that the protein had been produced at 25 degrees C or to a difference in 
the physiological state of the cell, we investigated the distribution of the 
heat-induced protein in cells grown under several different conditions. In 
wild-type cells grown in galactose or acetate and in mitochondrial mutants grown 
in glucose or galactose, hsp26 also failed to concentrate in nuclei with a heat 
shock. We conclude that the intracellular location of hsp26 in yeast depends 
upon the physiological state of the cell and not simply upon the presence or 
absence of heat stress. Our findings may explain why previous investigations of 
the intracellular localization of small hsps in a variety of organisms have 
yielded seemingly contradictory results.
