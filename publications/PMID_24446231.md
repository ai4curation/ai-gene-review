Defective clearance of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) from the brain is considered a 
strong promoter in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Astrocytes and 
microglia are important mediators of Aβ clearance and Aβ aggregation state and 
the presence of amyloid associated proteins (AAPs), such as Apolipoproteins E 
and J (ApoE and ApoJ), may influence Aβ clearance by these cells. Here we set 
out to investigate whether astrocytes and microglia differ in uptake efficiency 
of Aβ oligomers (Aβoligo ) and Aβ fibrils (Aβfib ), and whether the Aβ 
aggregation state and/or presence of AAPs affect Aβ uptake in these cells in 
vitro. Adult human primary microglia and astrocytes, isolated from short delay 
post-mortem brain tissue, were exposed to either Aβoligo or Aβfib alone or 
combined with a panel of certain AAPs whereafter Aβ-positive cells were 
quantified using flow cytometry. Upon exposure to Aβ combined with ApoE, ApoJ, 
α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and a combination of serum amyloid P and complement 
C1q (SAP-C1q), a clear reduction in astrocytic but not microglial Aβoligo 
uptake, was observed. In contrast, Aβfib uptake was strongly reduced in the 
presence of AAPs in microglia, but not in astrocytes. These data provide the 
first evidence of distinct roles of microglia and astrocytes in Aβ clearance. 
More importantly we show that Aβ clearance by glial cells is negatively affected 
by AAPs like ApoE and ApoJ. Thus, targeting the association of Aβ with AAPs, 
such as ApoE and ApoJ, could serve as a therapeutic strategy to increase Aβ 
clearance by glial cells.
