Phosphorylation of the Bad protein is a key regulatory event in the prevention 
of apoptosis by survival factors. Phosphorylated Bad binds to the cytosolic 
14-3-3 protein and is sequestered from the apoptotic machinery of the 
mitochondrial membrane. To examine the role of Bad in cell growth and apoptosis 
in primary cultures, we produced stable Bad transfectants of chicken embryo 
fibroblasts (CEF). As expected, serum starvation of Bad transfectants promoted 
apoptosis. However, Bad-transfected CEF maintained in media with a high serum 
concentration were capable of anchorage-independent growth and grew to a higher 
saturation density than control CEF transfected with the empty vector. High 
dilutions of the infectious retroviral vector RCAS expressing Bad led to the 
formation of multilayered cell foci. The growth-promoting effects of Bad were 
dependent on the serine 136 phosphorylation site and correlated directly with 
binding of Bad to 14-3-3. These results suggest that phosphorylated Bad promotes 
cell growth and in oncogenic transformation may contribute to the neoplastic 
phenotype of the cell.
