Axin and p53 are tumor suppressors, controlling cell growth, apoptosis, and 
development. We show that Axin interacts with homeodomain-interacting protein 
kinase-2 (HIPK2), which is linked to UV-induced p53-dependent apoptosis by 
interacting with, and phosphorylating Ser 46 of, p53. In addition to association 
with p53 via HIPK2, Axin contains a separate domain that directly interacts with 
p53 at their physiological concentrations. Axin stimulates p53-dependent 
reporter transcription in 293 cells, but not in 293T, H1299, or SaOS-2 cells 
that are defective in p53 signaling. Axin, but not AxindeltaHIPK2, activates 
HIPK2-mediated p53 phosphorylation at Ser 46, facilitating p53-dependent 
transcriptional activity and apoptosis. Specific knockdown of Axin by siRNA 
reduced UV-induced Ser-46 phosphorylation and apoptosis. Kinase-dead HIPK2 
reduced Axin-induced p53-dependent transcriptional activity, indicating that 
Axin stimulates p53 function through HIPK2 kinase activity. Interestingly, 
HIPK2deltaAxin that lacks its Axin-binding region acts as a dominant-positive 
form in p53 activation, suggesting that the Axin-binding region of HIPK2 is a 
putative autoinhibitory domain. These results show that Axin acts as a tumor 
suppressor by facilitating p53 function through integration of multiple factors.

Abstract

Axin and p53 are tumor suppressors, controlling cell growth, apoptosis, and development. We show that Axin interacts with homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2), which is linked to UV-induced p53-dependent apoptosis by interacting with, and phosphorylating Ser 46 of, p53. In addition to association with p53 via HIPK2, Axin contains a separate domain that directly interacts with p53 at their physiological concentrations. Axin stimulates p53-dependent reporter transcription in 293 cells, but not in 293T, H1299, or SaOS-2 cells that are defective in p53 signaling. Axin, but not AxinΔHIPK2, activates HIPK2-mediated p53 phosphorylation at Ser 46, facilitating p53-dependent transcriptional activity and apoptosis. Specific knockdown of Axin by siRNA reduced UV-induced Ser-46 phosphorylation and apoptosis. Kinase-dead HIPK2 reduced Axin-induced p53-dependent transcriptional activity, indicating that Axin stimulates p53 function through HIPK2 kinase activity. Interestingly, HIPK2ΔAxin that lacks its Axin-binding region acts as a dominant-positive form in p53 activation, suggesting that the Axin-binding region of HIPK2 is a putative autoinhibitory domain. These results show that Axin acts as a tumor suppressor by facilitating p53 function through integration of multiple factors.

Introduction

Axin was initially identified as a negative regulator of axis formation, deficiency of which causes axial duplication as seen in genetically transmitted Fused mice ( Zeng et al , 1997 ). Molecular analysis has revealed that Axin is a master scaffold for the regulation of the cellular levels of β-catenin, a protein believed to be a common denominator of Wnt signaling ( Cadigan and Nusse, 1997 ; Kikuchi, 1999 ; Peifer and Polakis, 2000 ). We have previously delineated a signaling pathway in which Axin interacts with MEKK1/4 and activates JNK via MKK4/7 ( Zhang et al , 1999 ; Luo et al , 2003 ). A peculiar feature of the Axin/JNK pathway is that Axin requires multiple domains/factors for JNK activation. In the course of identifying molecules that may account for the requirement of the C-terminal region of Axin in JNK activation, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen and found that Axin interacted with homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) that had been previously shown to phosphorylate p53 at Ser 46 and enhanced p53-dependent transcriptional activity as well as apoptosis ( D'Orazi et al , 2002 ; Hofmann et al , 2002 ).

The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a potent inhibitor of cell growth, capable of arresting the cell cycle at several points and, under some circumstances, can participate in DNA repair after genotoxic insult, and can activate the apoptotic machinery leading to cell death ( Gottlieb and Oren, 1996 ; Ko and Prives, 1996 ; Levine, 1997 ; Sharpless and DePinho, 2002 ; Attardi and DePinho, 2004 ). The p53 gene is frequently altered in human cancers ( Greenblatt et al , 1994 ). In addition, apoptosis has recently been suggested to be a major contribution to p53-mediated suppression of tumor formation ( Attardi and DePinho, 2004 ). Besides the well-established roles in tumor suppression, a remarkable recent finding has revealed an unexpected developmental role for p53 in that it promotes mesoderm differentiation ( Cordenonsi et al , 2003 ; Takebayashi-Suzuki et al , 2003 ). Key TGF-β signaling events depend on functional p53, including the full transcriptional activation of the CDK inhibitor p21 waf1 . The p53 and Smad proteins physically interact and synergistically activate TGF-β-induced target genes ( Cordenonsi et al , 2003 ). Under normal conditions, p53 is short lived due to degradation upon ubiquitination by Mdm2, a ubiquitin E3 ligase ( Michael and Oren, 2003 ; Vargas et al , 2003 ). In response to environmental stress, and perhaps developmental cues, it also undergoes a variety of other post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and acetylation ( Prives and Manley, 2001 ; Brooks and Gu, 2003 ; Xu, 2003 ). Stress-induced phosphorylation of two critical residues on p53, Ser 15 and Ser 20, results in stabilization and activation of p53 ( Chehab et al , 1999 ; Dumaz and Meek, 1999 ). In addition to Ser 15 and Ser 20, Ser 46 has been recently shown to be critical for p53 stability regulation ( D'Orazi et al , 2002 ; Hofmann et al , 2002 ). Phosphorylation of Ser 46 on p53 is mediated by HIPK2, which is activated by ultraviolet radiation ( D'Orazi et al , 2002 ; Hofmann et al , 2002 ). The HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation of p53 facilitates CBP-mediated acetylation of p53, increasing the transcriptional activity of p53 and enhancing UV-induced apoptosis ( D'Orazi et al , 2002 ; Hofmann et al , 2002 ). Furthermore, HIPK2 was also shown to downregulate the cellular levels of the transcriptional corepressor CtBP, suggesting that HIPK2 promotes apoptosis by elevating expression of multiple target genes ( Zhang et al , 2003 ).

Here we show that Axin forms a ternary complex with HIPK2 that is bound to p53. In addition, Axin possesses a separate domain that directly interacts with the endogenous p53. Axin stimulates the transcriptional activity of p53 selectively toward some of the p53 target genes, and induces p53-dependent cell death through facilitating HIPK2 phosphorylation of Ser 46. Specific siRNA against Axin reduced UV-induced apoptosis, phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 46, and blocked HIPK2 stimulation of p53-dependent reporter activity. Deletion of the Axin-interacting domain of HIPK2 (HIPK2ΔAxin) failed to diminish Axin-induced p53-dependent transcriptional activities, but rather stimulated p53 transactivation even more dramatically than wild-type HIPK2, suggesting that Axin stimulates HIPK2 by removing an autoinhibitory domain of HIPK2. Taken together, we have found that Axin has an integrating role in the activation of p53-dependent transcription and apoptosis, underscoring its proapoptotic function as a tumor suppressor.

Discussion

In the present work, we provide lines of evidence that Axin, a critical regulator of Wnt signaling, is a scaffold protein for assembly of multimeric protein complex consisting of HIPK2 and p53. We showed that at physiological concentrations, Axin associates with p53 in two ways: one through HIPK2 and the other through direct interaction via a separate domain. Using a combination of deletion mutants and specific siRNAs, we found that Axin mirrors HIPK2-mediated p53 activation in several ways. First of all, Axin stimulates Ser-46 phosphorylation of p53. Second, Axin selectively enhances p53-dependent transcription of target genes, pointing to the possibility that Axin and HIPK2 both preferentially participate in p53-induced apoptosis in tumor suppression. Third, Axin and HIPK2 depend on each other for activation of p53, ultimately enhancing p53-dependent gene transcription and apoptosis. The Axin-mediated enhancement of p53-dependent transcriptional activity and apoptosis is physiologically relevant, as Axin fails to exert these roles in p53-deficient cells including 293T, H1299, and SaOS-2 cells, and specific knockdown of Axin reduced UV-induced apoptosis and Ser-46 phosphorylation of p53.
