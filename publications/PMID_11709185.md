Apoptosis is triggered when proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family 
bearing only the BH3 association domain bind to Bcl-2 or its homologs and block 
their antiapoptotic activity. To test whether loss of the BH3-only protein Bim 
could prevent the cellular attrition caused by Bcl-2 deficiency, we generated 
mice lacking both genes. Mice without Bcl-2 have a fragile lymphoid system, 
become runted, turn gray, and succumb to polycystic kidney disease. Concomitant 
absence of Bim prevented all these disorders. Indeed, loss of even one bim 
allele restored normal kidney development, growth, and health. These results 
demonstrate that Bim levels set the threshold for initiation of apoptosis in 
several tissues and suggest that degenerative diseases might be alleviated by 
blocking BH3-only proteins.
