Networks play a prominent role in the study of complex systems of interacting 
entities in biology, sociology, and economics. Despite this diversity, we 
demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching and 
centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification of 
their architecture. The matching term quantifies the assortative structure in 
which node makes links with which other node, whereas the centrality term 
quantifies the number of links that nodes make. We show, for a diverse set of 
networks, that this decomposition can provide a tight fit to observed networks. 
Then we provide three applications. First, we show that the model allows very 
accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when 
node characteristics are known, we show how the matching-centrality 
decomposition can be related to this external information. Consequently, it 
offers us a simple and versatile tool to explore how node characteristics 
explain network architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and 
flexibility of the model to forecast the links that a novel node would create if 
it were to join an existing network.
