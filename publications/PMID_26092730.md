The survival motor neuron (SMN) protein forms the oligomeric core of a 
multiprotein complex required for the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear 
ribonucleoproteins. Deletions and mutations in the SMN1 gene are associated with 
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a devastating neurodegenerative disease that is 
the leading heritable cause of infant mortality. Oligomerization of SMN is 
required for its function, and some SMA patient mutations disrupt the ability of 
SMN to self-associate. Here, we investigate the oligomeric nature of the 
SMN·Gemin2 complexes from humans and fission yeast (hSMN·Gemin2 and 
ySMN·Gemin2). We find that hSMN·Gemin2 forms oligomers spanning the dimer to 
octamer range. The YG box oligomerization domain of SMN is both necessary and 
sufficient to form these oligomers. ySMN·Gemin2 exists as a dimer-tetramer 
equilibrium with Kd = 1.0 ± 0.9 μM. A 1.9 Å crystal structure of the ySMN YG box 
confirms a high level of structural conservation with the human ortholog in this 
important region of SMN. Disulfide cross-linking experiments indicate that SMN 
tetramers are formed by self-association of stable, non-dissociating dimers. 
Thus, SMN tetramers do not form symmetric helical bundles such as those found in 
glycine zipper transmembrane oligomers. The dimer-tetramer nature of SMN 
complexes and the dimer of dimers organization of the SMN tetramer provide an 
important foundation for ongoing studies to understand the mechanism of 
SMN-assisted small nuclear ribonucleoprotein assembly and the underlying causes 
of SMA.
