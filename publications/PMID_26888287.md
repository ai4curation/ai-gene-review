Cystic fibrosis is a fatal genetic disease, most frequently caused by the 
retention of the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) 
mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The binding of the 14-3-3 
protein to the CFTR regulatory (R) domain has been found to enhance CFTR 
trafficking to the plasma membrane. To define the mechanism of action of this 
protein-protein interaction, we have examined the interaction in vitro. The 
disordered multiphosphorylated R domain contains nine different 14-3-3 binding 
motifs. Furthermore, the 14-3-3 protein forms a dimer containing two amphipathic 
grooves that can potentially bind these phosphorylated motifs. This results in a 
number of possible binding mechanisms between these two proteins. Using multiple 
biochemical assays and crystal structures, we show that the interaction between 
them is governed by two binding sites: The key binding site of CFTR (pS768) 
occupies one groove of the 14-3-3 dimer, and a weaker, secondary binding site 
occupies the other binding groove. We show that fusicoccin-A, a natural-product 
tool compound used in studies of 14-3-3 biology, can stabilize the interaction 
between 14-3-3 and CFTR by selectively interacting with a secondary binding 
motif of CFTR (pS753). The stabilization of this interaction stimulates the 
trafficking of mutant CFTR to the plasma membrane. This definition of the 
druggability of the 14-3-3-CFTR interface might offer an approach for cystic 
fibrosis therapeutics.

Discussion

In recent years, the amount of research done on 14-3-3 proteins has increased significantly. Each year, new protein binding partners for 14-3-3 are found and, with them, the number of diseases and possible therapeutic approaches related to 14-3-3 increases ( 29 ). This brings forward a strong need to understand the different binding mechanisms of this regulatory hub protein. Although a great number of 14-3-3 interactions have been thoroughly quantified, analyzed, and structurally elucidated ( 22 , 23 , 30 – 32 ), the interaction between CFTR and 14-3-3 remains poorly understood. The binding of the intrinsically disordered CFTR R domain to 14-3-3, relying on multiple-phosphorylated 14-3-3 binding motifs, employs a unique binding mechanism. There are several 14-3-3 PPIs known where proteins with multiple-phosphorylated serines and threonines interact with 14-3-3, for example LRRK2, p53, and BAD ( 30 , 33 – 36 ). However, the CFTR R-domain interaction with 14-3-3 is exceptional for the large number of interaction sites (nine). Apart from increasing our understanding of the interactions and specificity of 14-3-3 proteins, we have shown that stabilization of this interaction might present a mechanism for tackling the trafficking defect of the F508del-CFTR mutant protein.

FP binding assays of the nine singly phosphorylated CFTR peptides with 14-3-3β show that their binding to 14-3-3 is weak (≥high micromolar range) ( Fig. 2 A ). These individual affinities are too low to explain the biological function of 14-3-3 in CFTR expression as described in a publication of Liang et al. ( 13 ), and are significantly lower than the affinity of the whole phosphorylated R domain to 14-3-3 published by Bozoky et al. ( K d based on Trp fluorescence measurements: 5.4 ± 1.0 μM) ( 20 ). The affinities of the doubly phosphorylated CFTR peptides to 14-3-3 are significantly stronger (low–middle micromolar range) ( Fig. 2 B ) and comparable to those of earlier published 14-3-3 interaction partners ( 18 ) as well as the full-length R domain ( 20 ). Therefore, the 14-3-3 dimer most probably binds simultaneously to two monophosphoepitope sites on the same CFTR R domain. Bozoky et al. reported a variety of different binding modes in their NMR-based model for CFTR R-domain binding to 14-3-3 ( 20 ). Our structures of CFTR_R6 and CFTR_R7 with 14-3-3 clearly demonstrate that the phosphorylated binding sites do bind in the amphipathic binding grooves of 14-3-3, although the connecting linker in-between is not visible in the electron density and therefore shows no evidence for a functional interaction with 14-3-3 ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 ).

In binding assays, 14-3-3β was used because this isoform is physically relevant in CFTR expression ( 13 ). However, for practical reasons, 14-3-3ζ and 14-3-3γ have been used in crystallography experiments. Although these isoforms are physiologically less relevant, the binding grooves of 14-3-3 are highly conserved among the different isoforms ( 37 ), and should therefore provide a reliable impression of the binding between the R domain and 14-3-3. Additionally, the FP assay of all eight doubly phosphorylated peptides with the seven different isoforms showed that there are no specific preferences for the different binding sites within the isoforms ( Fig. S1 ). Although the different isoforms show different total binding affinities, they display the same trend in binding to the different peptides.

The nine 14-3-3 binding sites in the R domain are all related to the mode I (RSXpSXP) and/or mode II (RX[Y/F]XpSXP) 14-3-3 binding motifs ( 32 ), but none of the motif sequences present in CFTR conform exactly to either of these two modes. The R-domain binding site corresponding best to these published consensus binding sites is pS768 (QARRRQpSVLNLMT) ( Fig. 1 B ). Accordingly, pS768 scored the maximum value in the overview of the estimated relative occupancy of the bound state of the nine different 14-3-3 binding sites in the CFTR R domain ( 13 ). These observations are coherent with our experimental findings that indeed pS768 is the strongest individual binding site of the CFTR R domain to 14-3-3. Furthermore, we expected, based on the amino acid sequence and the estimated relative occupancy of the bound state of Liang et al. ( 13 ), that pS795 would bind more strongly to 14-3-3 than pS753. Our quantification of the binding of CFTR_R6 (pS753–pS768) and CFTR_R7 (pS768–pS795) to 14-3-3 in both the ITC and FP assays confirms this prediction ( Fig. 2 ). However, there are further alternative bivalent modes of CFTR binding to 14-3-3 imaginable. To test some of the possible combinations of two CFTR phosphosites binding to 14-3-3, we synthesized CFTR_R9 (pS712–G 5 –pS768) and CFTR_R10 (pS768–G 5 –pS813), which showed a comparable binding affinity for 14-3-3 as CFTR_R7 ( Fig. S3 ). Although these peptides are not exactly similar to the natural sequence, because both the sequence and length of the glycine linker in the peptide are different from the natural sequence, these results provide valuable insight into the possibility that nonadjacent binding motifs can bind simultaneously to 14-3-3. Additionally, ITC experiments performed on the full R domain showed that phosphorylation of S768 is more important for the binding to 14-3-3 than, for example, phosphorylation of S700 and S753 ( Fig. S3 D – H ).

What is the role for the multiple-phosphorylated 14-3-3 binding sites in the CFTR R domain? One explanation could be that pS768 acts as a main anchor point for the binding between CFTR and 14-3-3. After the binding of one 14-3-3 protomer to this anchor point, the local concentration of weaker binding sites surrounding the other protomer increases significantly, making the binding of a second protomer more likely to happen ( Fig. 6 ). This mechanism is described by Yaffe as the “gatekeeper” model: One dominant site functions as an initiator that must be present and phosphorylated to promote a 14-3-3 interaction, which is then stabilized by a second interaction ( 38 ). However, the case of CFTR is exceptional for the large number of binding sites, of which at least two must be phosphorylated and one has to be pS768. In this way, a mutation to one of the eight weaker binding sites will not significantly affect the functionality of CFTR, whereas having one single anchor point minimizes the chance of multiple 14-3-3 proteins binding to one R domain. Another explanation is more biological. 14-3-3 proteins are expected to increase CFTR function in three different ways: ( i ) supporting the folding of CFTR, ( ii ) masking the degradation recognition site, and ( iii ) assisting the trafficking to the plasma membrane ( 13 , 39 ). Binding of certain sites of the R domain to 14-3-3 could support the folding of the protein, whereas binding of other sites could, for example, mask or present the COPI recognition sites. These sites are located in the CFTR R domain at positions 683 (KKQS) and 696 (KRKNS) ( 40 , 41 ).

Phosphorylation of the CFTR R domain significantly increases its binding to 14-3-3 ( K d based on Trp fluorescence measurements shifts from 34.3 ± 7.4 μM to 5.4 ± 1.0 μM) ( 20 ). Therefore, we should keep in mind that the phosphorylation positions of the R domain and the presence of certain kinases exert an important influence on the binding of 14-3-3 to CFTR. A prediction of phosphorylation sites shows that different kinases are capable of phosphorylating different 14-3-3 binding sites. For example, PKA is able to phosphorylate all nine sites, PKC is predicted to phosphorylate only eight (all but Ser753), and AMPK is able to phosphorylate only five sites (Ser700, Ser737, Ser768, Ser795, and Ser813) ( 42 ). This can cause different levels of phosphorylation at different sites, varying over time, location, and cell fate. In this sense, the multiphosphorylatable R domain could work as an integrator of different signal-transduction pathways, with 14-3-3 acting as a “reader” element of the different phosphorylation patterns. Johnson et al. characterize this as an “AND” gate, where two phosphorylated sites must be engaged before the 14-3-3 dimer can bind, so two inputs (phosphorylation of the R domain by two different kinases) can lead to one output (binding of 14-3-3 to the CFTR R domain) ( 43 ). Furthermore, multiphosphorylation of the R domain could lead to an ultrasensitive response of binding to the 14-3-3 protein. We discovered with this study that at least two phosphorylated binding sites in the R domain, of which one should be pS768, are needed for the interaction with 14-3-3. The “extra” phosphorylation sites are perhaps not per se essential for binding to 14-3-3 but can increase the sensitivity of the system, resulting in a switch-like mechanism. Ferrell and Ha describe this phenomenon in an excellent review ( 44 ) where the Fus3–Ste5 interaction is used as an example. This interaction is important in yeast mating, where an ultrasensitive response is generated by multisite phosphorylation, two-stage binding with one docking site, and steric hindrance ( 45 ). The results reported here provide the first indications, to our knowledge, toward a potential similar ultrasensitive mechanism for regulation of the 14-3-3–CFTR interaction. Interestingly, the CF mutation database contains CF mutations that are present in the 14-3-3 binding sites of the CFTR R domain. We show with an FP assay of the CFTR_R6 peptide containing a selection of these mutations (S753R, V754M, and R766M) that they can decrease the binding affinity of the CFTR R domain to 14-3-3 ( Fig. S3 I ). This indicates that interruption of this PPI could be the underlying mechanism in a certain mutation class of the disease.

To analyze the possibility of stabilizing the 14-3-3–CFTR interaction, known stabilizers for 14-3-3 PPIs were tested in binding assays between 14-3-3 and the different doubly phosphorylated CFTR peptides. Addition of 200 µM FC-A resulted in a ninefold increase of affinity between 14-3-3β and CFTR_R6. Interestingly, until now, FC-A was reported to only stabilize mode III binding motifs ([pS/pT]X-COOH, where X is not Pro) ( 22 ), and yet the R domain does not contain any mode III binding sites. The structure of 14-3-3–CFTR_R6 crystals soaked with FC-A shows that FC-A is only present in the binding groove containing the pS753 binding site ( Fig. 4 D ). This is possibly the reason why the FP assays and ITC measurements showed that FC-A is able to stabilize the 14-3-3–CFTR_R6 (pS753–pS768) interaction but not the 14-3-3–CFTR_R7 (pS768–pS795) interaction ( Figs. 4 A – C and 5 ). The most important interactions between FC-A and CFTR_R6 are the hydrophobic contacts with Val754 and Ile755, which form a hydrophobic pocket together with 14-3-3 residues Leu218, Ile219, Ile168, and Val64 ( Fig. 4 G ). However, the pS768 and pS795 binding motifs also display hydrophobic residues at the +1 and +2 positions of the phosphorylated serine but are not stabilized by FC-A. A possible explanation why the pS768 motif is not stabilized by FC-A is that Leu772 contains hydrophobic contacts with both the Phe117 of 14-3-3 and Leu770 of the peptide itself ( Fig. 4 E ), which would be broken by addition of FC-A in this pocket, leading to a decreased binding affinity. Furthermore, a possibility is that leucine and alanine of the pS795 binding site, and valine and leucine of pS768, do not form the right surface topography to present to FC-A. Another explanation could be that the short linker between pS753 and pS768 (14 amino acids) is “guided” toward the direction of the second binding groove by FC-A, which is not essential for the longer linker between pS768 and pS795 (26 amino acid residues). This would explain why the other doubly phosphorylated, but weaker-binding, peptides containing short linker lengths, CFTR_R1 (pS660–pS670) and CFTR_R3 (pS700–pS712), show stabilization upon addition of FC-A as well ( Fig. S6 B ), whereas peptides with longer linker lengths and the singly phosphorylated peptides do not show a significant increase of affinity through addition of FC-A ( Figs. S6 and S7 ). FP assays of CFTR_R6 with both physiologically relevant 14-3-3 isoforms β and ε, and ζ, showed that there is no isoform specificity in stabilization of the 14-3-3–CFTR interaction ( Fig. S1 B ). In this manner, tool compound FC-A shows the “ligandability” of the 14-3-3–CFTR interaction in an intermolecular specific manner. The difference between the mode I/II binding of pS753 to 14-3-3 and the mode III binding of other known 14-3-3 PPIs that can be stabilized with FC-A could provide the stabilization specificity needed for further drug discovery.

Carlile et al. developed a sensitive F508del-CFTR cell-based assay to detect correctors of trafficking ( 27 ). This assay showed that FC-A increases F508del-CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane, up to 54% of the positive control VX-809 (at a concentration of 100 µM; Fig. 6 A ), thus confirming the biological relevance of the 14-3-3–CFTR PPI and its small-molecule stabilization. This makes FC-A an F508del-CFTR trafficking corrector with a structurally known mechanism of action, which is rare in the field.

In conclusion, we have presented a thorough and quantitative biophysical and structural characterization of the interaction between 14-3-3 and CFTR, and provided clear evidence for a tandem mode-of-action binding event. One anchor binding motif of CFTR (pS768) occupies one binding groove of the 14-3-3 dimer, and a weaker, secondary binding motif (e.g., pS712, pS753, pS795, or pS813) occupies the other binding groove. Additionally, we show that the 14-3-3–CFTR interaction can be specifically stabilized by targeting the secondary binding-motif interaction with 14-3-3 with the small-molecule stabilizer FC-A, which thus might display a possible corrector activity in the trafficking of F508del-CFTR. The characterization of the 14-3-3–CFTR interaction presented in this paper is an important step in understanding the purpose of multisite phosphorylation in disordered domains to initiate 14-3-3 PPIs. Furthermore, it provides a promising approach for CF drug discovery.
