BACKGROUND: Therapeutic plasma exchange (PE) or plasmapheresis is an 
extracorporeal procedure employed to treat immunological disorders. Exosomes, 
nanosized vesicles of endosomal origin, mediate intercellular communication by 
transferring cargo proteins and nucleic acids and regulate many 
pathophysiological processes. Exosomal miRNAs are potential biomarkers due to 
their stability and dysregulation in diseases including complex regional pain 
syndrome (CRPS), a chronic pain disorder with persistent inflammation. A 
previous study showed that a subset of CRPS patients responded to PE.
METHODS: As a proof-of-concept, we investigated the PE-induced exosomal miRNA 
changes in six CRPS patients. Plasma cytokine levels were measured by HPLC and 
correlated with miRNA expression. Luciferase assay following co-transfection of 
HEK293 cells with target 3'UTR constructs and miRNA mimics was used to evaluate 
miRNA mediated gene regulation of target mRNA. Transient transfection of THP-1 
cells with miRNA mimics followed by estimation of target gene and protein 
expression was used to validate the findings.
RESULTS: Comparison of miRNAs in exosomes from the serum of three responders and 
three poor-responders showed that 17 miRNAs differed significantly before and 
after therapy. Of these, poor responders had lower exosomal hsa-miR-338-5p. We 
show that miR-338-5p can bind to the interleukin 6 (IL-6) 3' untranslated region 
and can regulate IL-6 mRNA and protein levels in vitro. PE resulted in a 
significant reduction of IL-6 in CRPS patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that lower pretreatment levels of miR-338-5p in poor 
responders are linked to IL-6 levels and inflammation in CRPS. Our data suggests 
the feasibility of exploring exosomal miRNAs as a strategy in patient 
stratification for maximizing therapeutic outcome of PE.
