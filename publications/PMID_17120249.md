OBJECTIVE: The PARK8 gene responsible for late-onset autosomal dominant 
Parkinson's disease encodes a large novel protein of unknown biological function 
termed leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). The studies herein explore the 
localization of LRRK2 in the mammalian brain.
METHODS: Polyclonal antibodies generated against the amino or carboxy termini of 
LRRK2 were used to examine the biochemical, subcellular, and immunohistochemical 
distribution of LRRK2.
RESULTS: LRRK2 is detected in rat brain as an approximate 280kDa protein by 
Western blot analysis. Subcellular fractionation demonstrates the presence of 
LRRK2 in microsomal, synaptic vesicle-enriched and synaptosomal cytosolic 
fractions from rat brain, as well as the mitochondrial outer membrane. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of rat and human brain tissue and primary rat 
cortical neurons, with LRRK2-specific antibodies, shows widespread 
neuronal-specific labeling localized exclusively to punctate structures within 
perikarya, dendrites, and axons. Confocal colocalization analysis of primary 
cortical neurons shows partial yet significant overlap of LRRK2 immunoreactivity 
with markers specific for mitochondria and lysosomes. Furthermore, 
ultrastructural analysis in rodent basal ganglia detects LRRK2 immunoreactivity 
associated with membranous and vesicular intracellular structures, including 
lysosomes, endosomes, transport vesicles, and mitochondria.
INTERPRETATION: The association of LRRK2 with a variety of membrane and 
vesicular structures, membrane-bound organelles, and microtubules suggests an 
affinity of LRRK2 for lipids or lipid-associated proteins and may suggest a 
potential role in the biogenesis and/or regulation of vesicular and membranous 
intracellular structures within the mammalian brain.
