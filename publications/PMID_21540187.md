The cell cycle is driven by the kinase activity of cyclin·cyclin-dependent 
kinase (CDK) complexes, which is negatively regulated by CDK inhibitor proteins. 
Recently, we identified INCA1 as an interaction partner and a substrate of 
cyclin A1 in complex with CDK2. On a functional level, we identified a novel 
cyclin-binding site in the INCA1 protein. INCA1 inhibited CDK2 activity and cell 
proliferation. The inhibitory effects depended on the cyclin-interacting domain. 
Mitogenic and oncogenic signals suppressed INCA1 expression, whereas it was 
induced by cell cycle arrest. We established a deletional mouse model that 
showed increased CDK2 activity in spleen with altered spleen architecture in 
Inca1(-/-) mice. Inca1(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts showed an increase in the 
fraction of S-phase cells. Furthermore, blasts from acute lymphoid leukemia and 
acute myeloid leukemia patients expressed significantly reduced INCA1 levels 
highlighting its relevance for growth control in vivo. Taken together, this 
study identifies a novel CDK inhibitor with reduced expression in acute myeloid 
and lymphoid leukemia. The molecular events that control the cell cycle occur in 
a sequential process to ensure a tight regulation, which is important for the 
survival of a cell and includes the detection and repair of genetic damage and 
the prevention of uncontrolled cell division.
