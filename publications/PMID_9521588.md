Amyloid-precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) is a membrane-associated glycoprotein, 
whose gene is homologous to the APP gene, which has been shown to be involved in 
the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. APLP1 is predominantly expressed in 
brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex postsynaptic density. The genomic 
organization of mouse APLP1 has been determined, and the human gene has been 
mapped to chromosomal region 19q13.1. In the present study, the entire sequence 
of human APLP1 has been determined from a cosmid clone, and the genomic 
structure has been determined. The gene is 11.8 kb long and contains 17 exons. 
We have previously mapped the gene for congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNF) to 
the APLP1 region, to the vicinity of marker D19S610 located between markers 
D19S191 and DS19608. APLP1 is the only known gene in the vicinity of the marker 
D19S610. Because of its location and the proposed interference of amyloid with 
basement membrane assembly, APLP1 has been considered a candidate gene for CNF. 
All exon regions of the gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and 
sequenced from DNA of CNF patients. No differences were observed between CNF 
patients and controls, suggesting that mutations in APLP1 are not involved in 
the etiology of CNF.
