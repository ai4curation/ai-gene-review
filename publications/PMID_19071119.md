The interplay between hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and histone 
deacetylase (HDACs) have been well studied; however, the mechanism of cross-talk 
is unclear. Here, we investigated the roles of HDAC4 and HDAC5 in the regulation 
of HIF-1alpha function and its associated mechanisms. HDAC4 and HDAC5 enhanced 
transactivation by HIF-1alpha without stabilizing HIF-1alpha. HDAC4 and HDAC5 
physically associated with HIF-1alpha through the inhibitory domain (ID) that is 
the binding site for factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1). In the presence of these 
HDACs, binding of HIF-1alpha to FIH-1 decreased, whereas binding to p300 
increased. These results indicate that HDAC4 and HDAC5 increase the 
transactivation function of HIF-1alpha by promoting dissociation of HIF-1alpha 
from FIH-1 and association with p300.
