The family of mammalian Sirtuin proteins comprises seven members homologous to 
yeast Sir2. Here we show that SIRT2, a cytoplasmic sirtuin, is the most abundant 
sirtuin in adipocytes. Sirt2 expression is downregulated during preadipocyte 
differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Overexpression of SIRT2 inhibits 
differentiation, whereas reducing SIRT2 expression promotes adipogenesis. Both 
effects are accompanied by corresponding changes in the expression of PPARgamma, 
C/EBPalpha, and genes marking terminal adipocyte differentiation, including 
Glut4, aP2, and fatty acid synthase. The mechanism underlying the effects of 
reduced SIRT2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes includes increased acetylation of FOXO1, with 
direct interaction between SIRT2 and FOXO1. This interaction enhances 
insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of FOXO1, which in turn regulates FOXO1 
nuclear and cytosolic localization. Thus, Sirt2 acts as an important regulator 
of adipocyte differentiation through modulation of FOXO1 
acetylation/phosphorylation and activity and may play a role in controlling 
adipose tissue mass and function.
