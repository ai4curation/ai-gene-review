Activating and inhibitory receptors act in concert to regulate cellular 
activation. Inhibitory receptors are characterized by the presence of a 
characteristic sequence known as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory 
motif (ITIM) in their cytoplasmic tail. Phosphorylated ITIM serve as docking 
sites for the SH2-containing phosphatases which then inhibit signal 
transduction. CD33 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and contains 
two immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail 
that has two potential ITIM sequences. CD33 expression is restricted to cells of 
myelomonocytic lineage. The precise function of CD33 is unknown although it is a 
lectin that binds sialic acid residues in N- and O-glycans on cell surfaces. 
Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that CD33 associates with the 
SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in monocytes. The proximal ITIM is 
necessary and sufficient for SHP-1 binding which is mediated by the 
aminoterminal SH2 domain. Treatment of SHP-1 with a phosphopeptide representing 
the proximal CD33 ITIM results in increased SHP-1 enzymatic activity. CD33 
exerts an inhibitory effect on tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca(2+) mobilization 
when co-engaged with the activating FcgammaRI receptor. This data indicates that 
CD33 is an inhibitory receptor that may regulate FcgammaRI signal transduction.
