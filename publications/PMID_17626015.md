SGIP1 has been shown to be an endophilin-interacting protein that regulates 
energy balance, but its function is not fully understood. Here, we identified 
its splicing variant of SGIP1 and named it SGIP1alpha. SGIP1alpha bound to 
phosphatidylserine and phosphoinositides and deformed the plasma membrane and 
liposomes into narrow tubules, suggesting the involvement in vesicle formation 
during endocytosis. SGIP1alpha furthermore bound to Eps15, an important adaptor 
protein of clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery. SGIP1alpha was colocalized 
with Eps15 and the AP-2 complex. Upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, 
SGIP1alpha was colocalized with EGF at the plasma membrane, indicating the 
localization of SGIP1alpha at clathrin-coated pits/vesicles. SGIP1alpha 
overexpression reduced transferrin and EGF endocytosis. SGIP1alpha knockdown 
reduced transferrin endocytosis but not EGF endocytosis; this difference may be 
due to the presence of redundant pathways in EGF endocytosis. These results 
suggest that SGIP1alpha plays an essential role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis 
by interacting with phospholipids and Eps15.
