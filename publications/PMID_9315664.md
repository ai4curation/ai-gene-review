The protein encoded by the human gene HEC (highly expressed in cancer) contains 
642 amino acids and a long series of leucine heptad repeats at its C-terminal 
region. HEC protein is expressed most abundantly in the S and M phases of 
rapidly dividing cells but not in terminal differentiated cells. It localizes to 
the nuclei of interphase cells, and a portion distributes to centromeres during 
M phase. Inactivation of HEC by microinjection of specific monoclonal antibodies 
into cells during interphase severely disturbs the subsequent mitoses. 
Disordered sister chromatid alignment and separation, as well as the formation 
of nonviable cells with multiple, fragmented micronuclei, are common features 
observed. These results suggest that the HEC protein may play an important role 
in chromosome segregation during M phase.
