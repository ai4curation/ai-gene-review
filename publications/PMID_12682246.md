Staphylococcal enterotoxin H (SEH) is a bacterial superantigen secreted by 
Staphylococcus aureus. Superantigens are presented on the MHC class II and 
activate large amounts of T cells by cross-linking APC and T cells. In this 
study, RT-PCR was used to show that SEH stimulates human T cells via the Valpha 
domain of TCR, in particular Valpha10 (TRAV27), while no TCR Vbeta-specific 
expansion was seen. This is in sharp contrast to all other studied bacterial 
superantigens, which are highly specific for TCR Vbeta. It was further confirmed 
by flow cytometry that SEH stimulation does not alter the levels of certain TCR 
Vbeta. In a functional assay addressing cross-reactivity, Vbeta binding 
superantigens were found to form one group, whereas SEH has different properties 
that fit well with Valpha reactivity. As SEH binds on top of MHC class II, an 
interaction between MHC and TCR upon SEH binding is not likely. This concludes 
that the specific expansion of TCR Valpha is not due to contacts between MHC and 
TCR, instead we suggest that SEH directly interacts with the TCR Valpha domain.
