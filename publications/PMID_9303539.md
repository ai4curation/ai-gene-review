EH is a recently identified protein-protein interaction domain found in the 
signal transducers Eps15 and Eps15R and several other proteins of yeast 
nematode. We show that EH domains from Eps15 and Eps15R bind in vitro to 
peptides containing an asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motif. Direct 
screening of expression libraries with EH domains yielded a number of putative 
EH interactors, all of which possessed NPF motifs that were shown to be 
responsible for the interaction. Among these interactors were the human homolog 
of NUMB, a developmentally reguated gene of Drosophila, and RAB, the cellular 
cofactor of the HIV REV protein. We demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation of Eps15 
with NUMB and RAB. Finally, in vitro binding of NPF-containing peptides to 
cellular proteins and EST database screening established the existence of a 
family of EH-containing proteins in mammals. Based on the characteristics of 
EH-containing and EH-binding proteins, we propose that EH domains are involved 
in processes connected with the transport and sorting of molecules within the 
cell.
