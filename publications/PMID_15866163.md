Osteoblasts and chondrocytes are involved in building up the vertebrate skeleton 
and are thought to differentiate from a common mesenchymal precursor, the 
osteo-chondroprogenitor. Although numerous transcription factors involved in 
chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation have been identified, little is known 
about the signals controlling lineage decisions of the two cell types. Here, we 
show by conditionally deleting beta-catenin in limb and head mesenchyme that 
beta-catenin is required for osteoblast lineage differentiation. Osteoblast 
precursors lacking beta-catenin are blocked in differentiation and develop into 
chondrocytes instead. In vitro experiments demonstrate that this is a 
cell-autonomous function of beta-catenin in an osteoblast precursor. 
Furthermore, detailed in vivo and in vitro loss- and gain-of-function analyses 
reveal that beta-catenin activity is necessary and sufficient to repress the 
differentiation of mesenchymal cells into Runx2- and Sox9-positive skeletal 
precursors. Thus, canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is essential for skeletal 
lineage differentiation, preventing transdifferentiation of osteoblastic cells 
into chondrocytes.
