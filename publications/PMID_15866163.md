Osteoblasts and chondrocytes are involved in building up the vertebrate skeleton 
and are thought to differentiate from a common mesenchymal precursor, the 
osteo-chondroprogenitor. Although numerous transcription factors involved in 
chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation have been identified, little is known 
about the signals controlling lineage decisions of the two cell types. Here, we 
show by conditionally deleting beta-catenin in limb and head mesenchyme that 
beta-catenin is required for osteoblast lineage differentiation. Osteoblast 
precursors lacking beta-catenin are blocked in differentiation and develop into 
chondrocytes instead. In vitro experiments demonstrate that this is a 
cell-autonomous function of beta-catenin in an osteoblast precursor. 
Furthermore, detailed in vivo and in vitro loss- and gain-of-function analyses 
reveal that beta-catenin activity is necessary and sufficient to repress the 
differentiation of mesenchymal cells into Runx2- and Sox9-positive skeletal 
precursors. Thus, canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is essential for skeletal 
lineage differentiation, preventing transdifferentiation of osteoblastic cells 
into chondrocytes.

BackgroundThe cranial base is an essential integration of the viscerocranium and the neurocranium, which links the skull with the trunk and supports the cranium and craniofacial development [1, 2]. The mouse cranial base develops from mesenchymal cells of two embryonic origins (cranial neural crest and paraxial mesoderm) through a pattern of endochondral ossification. Two embryonic cells coalesce in the presumptive cranial base region to differentiate into chondrocytes and secrete the corresponding matrix to build cartilage [3–5]. The cartilage of the skull base forms and fuses at specific times and locations to form continuous cartilaginous structures that subsequently ossify sequentially. The cartilage area between the ossification centers is referred to as synchondrosis and is the critical site for continued cranial base growth until maturity [1, 3, 5, 6].The synchondrosis consists of two mirror−image growth plates and is termed intersphenoidal, spheno−occipital, or basi−exoccipital, etc., according to their anatomical site [3, 7]. Growth defects of the cranial base are contributing to midfacial retardation and cranial vault malformation and are often an underlying component of several craniofacial syndromes, including Apert’s syndrome, Crouzon’s syndrome, Muenke’s syndrome, and Pfeiffer’s syndrome [8–10]. Previous studies have shown that Fgfr signaling is involved in endochondral ossification, and its disruption or overexpression can result in premature fusion of synchondrosis after the birth of mice [11–14]. Excessive activation of Bmp signaling demonstrates premature closure of the cranial base synchondrosis in embryonic mice [15, 16]. Overexpression of Lef1 (an effector of Wnt signaling) or knockout of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) exhibited widespread chondrocyte maturation of the cranial base synchondrosis, phenotypically manifesting skull base craniosynostosis [17, 18]. However, the mechanism of premature closure of the cranial base remains largely elusive.The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a vital role in the development and patterning of multiple organs [19–26]. Hh ligands bind to Patched1 (Ptch1), a membrane receptor on target cells, and deregulate another membrane receptor, Smoothened (Smo), thereby causing conformational changes of the downstream Gli transcription factor family (Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3) and translocation of Gli to the nucleus, which activates the Hh pathway [26–31]. Ihh regulates many steps of endochondral osteogenesis through parathyroid hormone−related protein (PTHrP)−dependent and non−dependent pathways [17, 20, 32–34]. Ihh−deficient mice (Ihh−/−) exhibit premature maturation and impaired ossification of cartilage [17, 20, 34]. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is essential for the morphogenesis and patterning of the craniofacial and axial skeleton [19, 21–23, 35–38]. Shh−null mice (Shh−/−) exhibit cyclopia and axial skeletal defects and failure of cranial base formation [22, 25]. Ablation of Smo in the cranial neural crest (Wnt1−cre;smon/c) also results in the absence of the anterior cranial base [21]. Genetic deletion of Shh or Smo leads to an absence of skull base structure while the early pattern of the cranial base in Ihh−null mice is basically normal, suggesting that the Shh signaling is crucial for early development of the cranial base. However, stillborn or early apoptosis of mesenchymal cells in cranial base caused by Shh or Smo knockout limits further studies on their role in the early basicranium development [19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 39], whereas teratogenic mouse models may provide a valuable strategy [40–45]. Vismodegib is a potent small molecule Hh pathway antagonist against Smo [46–49] and has been used to establish craniofacial deformity models in mice [40–42, 44]. Our previous study showed for the first time that inhibition of the Hh pathway at a specific embryonic day (E9.5−E10.5) leads to skull base craniosynostosis, premature terminal differentiation, and osteogenesis of the cranial base synchondroses [44], supporting a unique role of the Hh signaling pathway for developing cranial base.In the current study, we further explored the potential mechanisms underlying this model. Mice treated to Vismodegib exhibit premature terminal differentiation and bone formation of the cranial base synchondroses after E14.5. However, the expression of Ptch1, Gli1, PTHrP, and Phh3 was not downregulated in exposure mice compared to the control, which differs from Ihh-deficient mice. We further demonstrate that Shh and Wnt signaling pathways were activated in the cranial base region at E10.5, where Bmp signaling and Ihh were dormant. Exposed to Vismodegib at E10.5 transiently disrupted Shh signaling in the cranial base region and upregulated β-catenin expression along with the ectopic expression of Lef1 and Runx2 in the ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base at E12.5. The present experiment suggests that early activation of Shh ensures normal embryonic development of cranial base after initial morphogenesis, probably through the “antagonistic” effect of Shh signaling on Wnt signaling (Scheme 1).Scheme 1Early activation of Shh ensures normalembryonic development of cranial base

The cranial base is an essential integration of the viscerocranium and the neurocranium, which links the skull with the trunk and supports the cranium and craniofacial development [1, 2]. The mouse cranial base develops from mesenchymal cells of two embryonic origins (cranial neural crest and paraxial mesoderm) through a pattern of endochondral ossification. Two embryonic cells coalesce in the presumptive cranial base region to differentiate into chondrocytes and secrete the corresponding matrix to build cartilage [3–5].

The cartilage area between the ossification centers is referred to as synchondrosis and is the critical site for continued cranial base growth until maturity [1, 3, 5, 6].

The synchondrosis consists of two mirror−image growth plates and is termed intersphenoidal, spheno−occipital, or basi−exoccipital, etc., according to their anatomical site [3, 7]. Growth defects of the cranial base are contributing to midfacial retardation and cranial vault malformation and are often an underlying component of several craniofacial syndromes, including Apert’s syndrome, Crouzon’s syndrome, Muenke’s syndrome, and Pfeiffer’s syndrome [8–10].

Early activation of Shh ensures normalembryonic development of cranial base

ResultsDose-dependent effect of Shh in the early development of cranial baseSince administration of Vismodegib in 150 mg/kg dose exhibited cranial base craniosynostosis, a completely different phenotype of cranial base compared to the Shh-null mice or Wnt1-cre;smon/c mice, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of Shh in the early development of skull base. To test this, we examined the cranial base phenotype following different levels of Shh inhibition by different doses of administration. In general, the severity of the cranial base deformities worsened with increasing dose of Vismodegib exposure (Fig. 1), with the 50 mg/kg treated mice displaying partial premature fusion of basi-exoccipital synchondrosis (IOS) (Fig. 1B, red arrows, compared to A), and 100 mg/kg exposed animals showing premature closure of IOS and spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS) (Fig. 1C, red arrows, yellow arrow). Precocious mineralization of IOS, SOS, and intersphenoidal synchondrosis (ISS) were significant at 150 mg/kg administrated mice (Fig. 1D, arrows). Embryos exposed to 200 mg/kg Vismodegib demonstrated premature closure of cranial base synchondrosis and the smaller skull (Fig. 1E, arrows), in which the severe phenotype of cranial base that most central structures of cranial base are missing mimicked that of the Shh-deficient mice [22, 25] (Fig. 1F, arrows).Fig. 1Dose-dependent phenotypes of Vismodegib in cranial base synchondroses of mice. A–F, pregnant mice were treated with Vehicle or 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg Vismodegib at E10.5. The ventral skull base of skeletal preparation with mandible removed, embryos on E17.5, bone are stained red and cartilage, blue. ISS, SOS, and IOS were pointed by white-, yellow-, and red-arrows, respectively. Scale bar: 1000 μm in A–F, n = 3. (IOS) basi-exoccipital synchondrosis; (ISS) intersphenoidal synchondrosis; (SOS) spheno-occipital synchondrosisCranial base craniosynostosis in E17.5 mice exposed to Vismodegib at E10.5Our previous study showed that mice treated to 150 mg/kg Vismodegib at E9.5 or E10.5 exhibited premature closure of cranial base synchondrosis, with the highest incidence of malformations (100%) and the lowest rate of stillbirths (2.8%) in the E10.5 administration group [44]. Therefore, we used E10.5−exposed mice as the target of the present study. Mice exposed to Vismodegib at E10.5 displayed premature fusion of SOS (Fig. 2F, G, red arrows), IOS (Fig. 2F, G, white arrows), and alisphenoid synchondrosis (ALS) (Fig. 2G, green arrow) in ventral views of gross dissection and micro−CT, compared to Vehicle−treated animals (Fig. 2A, B, corresponding colored arrows). The E17.5 Vehicle−exposed mice showed the well−patterned cranial base consisting of ossification centers (basioccipital bone and basisphenoid bone) (Fig. 2C, bs and bo) and intervening synchondroses (Fig. 2C, yellow arrow, red arrow, and black arrow in the inset). The hypertrophic chondrocyte zone of the synchondrosis and ossification center was marked by Collagen (Col) X [4, 50] (Fig. 2D, orange; sFigure 1) and Col I [4] (Fig. 2E, orange; sFigure 1), respectively. Embryos treated to Vismodegib demonstrated prematurely hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes (Fig. 2H, yellow arrow, red arrow and black arrow in the inset) and trabecular bone formation (Fig. 2H, yellow arrowhead and red arrowhead) in ISS and SOS, as proven by expression of Col X (Fig. 2I, yellow arrow and red arrow) and Col I (Fig. 2J, yellow arrow and red arrow).Fig. 2Chondrocyte terminal differentiation and osteogenesis are accelerated in the cranial base synchondrosis of Vismodegib-treated mice at E17.5. A–J The spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS), intersphenoidal synchondrosis (ISS), basi-exoccipital synchondrosis (IOS), and alisphenoid synchondrosis (ALS) were indicated by a red arrow, yellow arrow, white arrow, and green arrow in Vehicle-exposure (A–E) or Vismodegib-exposure mice (F–J). A, B, F, G Ventral views of stereo (A, F) and micro-CT (B, G) of the cranial base with the mandible removed in Vehicle-group (A, B) and Vismodegib-group (F, G), the ossification areas of bs, bo, and eo were delineated by dotted lines. The color arrows highlight the premature ossification of the synchondroses in Vismodegib-exposure mice. C–E, H–J Serial parasagittal sections of Vehicle-treated mice (C–E) and Vismodegib-exposed mice (H–J) were performed HE staining (C, H), Col X (D, I), and Col I (E, J) immunofluorescence staining, respectively. The inset shows a higher magnification image of SOS (the dotted frame) in C, H. Orange denotes the primary antibody targets, and blue indicates DAPI. Notice the prematurely hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and trabecular bone formation in synchondrosis of Vismodegib-exposed embryos (H, arrows, and arrowheads, respectively), and the ISS and SOS of Vismodegib-group prematurely express the Col X and Col I (I, J, arrows). Scale bar = 1000 μm in A, F; 1000 μm in B, G; 200 μm in C–E, H–J. (bo) basioccipital bone; (bs) basisphenoid bone; (eo) exoccipital boneEarly patterning of the skull base is approximately normal, but terminal differentiation and osteogenesis synchondrosis are accelerated subsequentlyWe next ask if the cranial base craniosynostosis of Vismodegib−treated mice is caused by disrupted early patterning of the skull base. In the control mice, the major skull base cartilage appears at E14.5 (Fig. 3A), followed by the ossification of basisphenoid bone emerge at E15.5 (Fig. 3B), and the presphenoid bone ossifies at E17.5 (Fig. 3D). In comparison, Vismodegib−group showed the comparable patterning of cranial base in E14.5 (Fig. 3E). However, precocious mineralization of IOS is evident at E15.5 (Fig. 3F, yellow arrow), and the ossification of ISS and SOS are emerging and more extensive at E16.5 (Fig. 3G, black arrow and red arrow) and E17.5 (Fig. 3H, black arrow and red arrow), respectively.Fig. 3Early patterning of the skull base is largely normal, but premature ossification of synchondrosis occurs after E14.5 in Vismodegib-treated embryos. A–H Ventral views of the skeletal preparations of control (A–D) and Vismodegib-exposed mice (E–H) at a different stage, red denotes bone, and blue, cartilage. The inset shows a higher magnification image of the dotted frame. The red arrow, black arrow, and yellow arrow point to spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS), intersphenoidal synchondrosis (ISS), and basi-exoccipital synchondrosis (IOS), respectively. In Vismodegib-treated mice, premature ossification of the IOS occurred at E15.5, whereas premature mineralization of the SOS and ISS appeared after E15.5. Scale bar = 1000 μm in A–H, 1000 μm in enlarged frame of A–H. (bo) basioccipital bone; (bs) basisphenoid bone; (eo) exoccipital boneSimilar to the Alcian blue and alizarin red staining, SOS in Vehicle− and Vismodegib−exposed mice at E14.5 demonstrated similar histological manifestations (Fig. 4A, F), indicated by Col II occupied in the immature cartilage zone[51] and Col X labeled in the hypertrophic cartilage area (Fig. 4B, G). The early osteogenic markers Runx2 [52, 53], Osterix (Osx) [54], and Col I were also normally expressed in the periosteum of hypertrophic cartilage in control (Fig. 4C–E, white and red arrows) and Vismodegib−treated mice (Fig. 4H–J, white and red arrows), reminiscent of the equivalent osteogenic process at this stage. In spite of differences with the skeletal preparation, SOS of E15.5 Vismodegib group already showed premature hypertrophic differentiation (Fig. 5F, compared to A), denoted by a narrowed Col II−positive region (Fig. 5G, orange, compared to B) and an expanded Col X−expressing area (Fig. 5G, green, compared to B), while the expression range of Runx2, Osx, and Col I on both sides of the SOS extended towards to the center (Fig. 5H, I, J, arrows, compared to C, D, E, respectively), demonstrating that the SOS undergoes accelerated chondrocyte maturation and osteogenesis.Fig. 4Chondrocyte differentiation and osteogenesis of cranial base synchondrosis is similar between control and Vismodegib-group at E14.5. A–J Serial sections from the midsagittal cranial base of E14.5 Vehicle- (A–E) and Vismodegib-treated mice (F–J) were processed for HE staining (A, F), and immunofluorescence (B–D, G–I) and immunochemistry (E, J) analysis of the indicated genes, orange or green indicates the primary antibody targets, and blue denotes DAPI, n = 3. The inset shows a higher magnification image of the dotted frame in E, J. The white arrows indicate the perichondrium in hypertrophic chondrocyte area, while red arrows indicate the periosteum of the ossification center.

A–J Serial parasagittal sections from the cranial base of E15.5 Vehicle- (A–E) and Vismodegib-group (F–J) were subjected to HE staining (A, E), and immunofluorescence (B–D, G–I) and immunochemistry (E, J) analysis of the indicated antibody, n = 3. The inset shows a higher magnification image of the dotted frame in E, J. The white arrows indicate the perichondrium in hypertrophic chondrocyte area, while red arrows indicate the periosteum of the ossification center. The shorten area of Col II-expression and expanding region of Col X-, Runx2-, Osx-, Col I-expression demonstrates accelerating chondrocyte differentiation and osteogenesis of SOS in Vismodegib-samples. Scale bar = 200 μm in A–J. (bo) basioccipital bone; (bs) basisphenoid bone; (hz) hypertrophic chondrocyte zone; (sos) spheno-occipital synchondrosisAt E16.5, the hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes was complete in the SOS of the Vismodigib group (Fig. 6G, compared to A), as shown by the replacement of the Col II−positive area by the Col X−expressing zone in the SOS (Fig. 6H, green, compared to B, orange). A large number of early osteogenic markers (Fig. 6I–K, arrows, compared to C–E) were prematurely expressed on the SOS periosteum, as well as the vascularization label (CD31) [55] emerged in SOS (Fig. 6L, red arrows, compared to F), which suggesting the active osteogenesis in SOS, as the vascular invasion is the key step for the replacement of cartilage by bone [56]. Premature osteogenesis in the SOS of Vismodegib−exposed embryos was more severe at E17.5, as evidenced by mineralized connections in the cranial base synchondroses (Fig. 7I, colored arrows, compared to A) and the formation of bone trabeculae within the SOS (Fig. 7J, SOS, compared to B). In addition to the expression of the early osteogenic markers Runx2, Osx, and Col I (Fig. 7K–M, arrows, compared to C–E), the expression of the late osteogenic label Osteocalcin (Oc) that normally express in terminally differentiated osteoblasts of ossification centers was detected in the SOS (Fig. 7O, red arrows, compared to G), as well as the detection of Trap−positive osteoclasts (Fig. 7N, red arrows, compared to F) and the expression of CD31 (Fig. 7P, red arrows, compared to H) in the SOS of E17.5 Vismodegib−exposed mice.Fig. 6The SOS of E16.5 Vismodegib-exposed embryos shown prematurely chondrocyte maturation and osteogenesis. A–J Serial sections from the midsagittal cranial base of E16.5 Vehicle- (A–F) and Vismodegib-group (G–L) were subjected to HE staining (A, G), and immunofluorescence (B–D, H–J) and immunochemistry (E, F, K, L) staining of the indicated genes, n = 3.

The red arrows denote the position of primary antibody expression. The occupying Col X-positive cartilage and strong expression of Runx2, Osx, Col I, and CD31 in SOS or perichondrium denotes the premature chondrocyte maturation and osteogenesis of cranial base synchondrosis in Vismodegib-group.

The location of the positive expression is indicated by the red arrows. The positive expression of Runx2, Osx, Col I, Trap, OC, and CD31 in SOS demonstrates the premature osteogenesis of cranial base synchondrosis in Vismodegib-group.

(bo) basioccipital bone; (bs) basisphenoid bone; (ps) presphenoid bone; (sos) spheno-occipital synchondrosisAs implicated by the above results, terminal chondrocyte differentiation and osteogenesis were precocious in Vismodegib−treated animals after E14.5.Cranial base craniosynostosis inVismodegib-exposed mice is not caused by inhibition of the Ihh-PTHrP pathway or diminished proliferation of the chondrocyte in synchondrosisThe development of the skull base follows the endochondral osteogenesis procedure. Immature chondrocytes of synchondrosis undergo proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation, and apoptosis and eventually replacement by bone. Ihh-PTHrP pathway regulates the rate of chondrocyte maturation [17, 20, 33, 34]. Ihh-null mice displayed extensive hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes in cranial base synchondrosis due to PTHrP reduction [17]. To test if premature maturation of skull base synchondrosis resulted, in part, from similar mechanisms, the expression of transcriptional targets of Hh signaling (Gli1 and Ptch1), Ihh and PTHrP in the SOS of Vehicle- and Vismodegib-mice at E14.5 and E15.5 were examined. At E14.5 and 15.5, control SOS already showed well-established growth plates (Figs. 8A and 9A) with Ihh-positive in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes and periosteum of the hypertrophic chondrocyte zone (Figs. 8B and 9B, arrows and arrowheads) and Ptch1- and Gli1-expressing in proliferating chondrocytes and periosteum of the hypertrophic chondrocyte area (Figs. 8C–F and 9C–F, arrows and arrowheads). PTHrP was located throughout the reserve and proliferative areas of the SOS and periosteum flanking the hypertrophic chondrocyte area (Figs. 8G and 9G, arrows and arrowheads). Surprisingly, the expression pattern of Ihh, Ptch1, Gli1, and PTHrP in SOS of Vismodegib-exposed mice is comparable with control mice at E14.5 (Fig. 8J–O, arrows and arrowheads, compared to B–G), and the PTHrP expression was also not significantly different (Fig. 8S), despite the expression of Ptch1 and Gli1 in Vismodegib-mice was statistically higher than that in the Vehicle group (Fig. 8K–N, arrows and arrowheads, compared to C–F) (Fig. 8Q, R). Even by E15.5, when most chondrocytes in the SOS of the Vismodegib group had undergone terminal differentiation, the Ihh, Ptch1, Gli1, and PTHrP were still clearly detectable in the remaining immature cartilage and periosteum flanking the hypertrophic cartilage (Fig. 9I–N, arrows and arrowheads, compared to B–G), and the expression of PTHrP in Vismodegib-exposed mice was statistically higher than that in the Vehicle-treated mice (sFigure 7P). However, the expression of Gli1 was no statistically different between the Vismodegib and Vehicle groups at E14.5 (sFigure 7O). The above observation suggests that disruption of Ihh-PTHrP is not the cause for cranial base synostosis in Vismodegib-exposed embryos.Fig. 8Expression of chondrocyte-maturation-regulated genes and proliferative mark is not inhibited in the SOS of E14.5 Vismodegib-exposed mice. A–P Serial sections from the midsagittal SOS of E14.5 Vehicle- (A–E) and Vismodegib-group (F–J) were processed for immunofluorescence (A–D, G, I-L, O), RNAscope (E, F, M, N), and immunochemistry (H, P) analysis, orange or green indicates the corresponding target genes, and blue denotes DAPI.

A–N Serial sections from the parasagittal SOS of Vehicle- (A–G) and Vismodegib-group (E–N) in E15.5 were performed immunofluorescence (A–D, G, H–K, N) and RNAscope (E, F, L, M) analysis of the indicated genes, orange or green indicates the related genes, and blue denotes DAPI. B, G, I, N The arrows and arrowheads indicate the expression of Ihh or PTHrP in the proliferative chondrocyte area and the perichondrium of the hypertrophic chondrocyte area, respectively.

The yellow arrowheads denote the perichondrium of the proliferative chondrocyte area. The white arrowheads denote the perichondrium of the hypertrophic chondrocyte area. In Vehicle- and Vismodegib-exposed mice, comparable expression of Ptch1 and Gli1 was observed. Scale bar = 500 μm in F, M; 200 μm in A–C, G, H–J, N; 100 μm in F, N; (rz) reserve chondrocyte zone; (pz) proliferating chondrocyte zone; (hz) hypertrophic chondrocyte zone; (sos) spheno-occipital synchondrosisTo test whether premature closure of the cranial base synchondrosis was due to decreased chondrocyte proliferation, the SOS of E14.5 control and Vismodegib groups were processed for expression of Phh3, a marker of proliferating cells. Phh3-positive chondrocytes were readily detected in the central reserve area and proliferative zones of SOS in Vehicle- and Vismodegib-treated embryos (Fig. 8H, P, arrows), and expression was statistically increased in the Vismodegib-exposed mice compared to the control group (Fig. 8T), indicating that premature closure of the cranial base is not secondary to reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in synchondrosis.Activation of Shh and Wnt in early morphogenesis of cranial baseOur previous study has shown that administration of Vismodegib at E10.5 can effectively inhibit Hh signaling at E11.5 [44], but the expression of Ptch1 and Gli1 was upregulated in the exposed mice compared to the control group at E14.5, suggesting that the disruption of Hh in embryos by maternally administered Vismodegib is not sustained, and further implying that the unique molecular events mediated by Hh signaling have occurred in the cranial base region at E10.5. Therefore, we evaluated the activation of the Hh, Wnt, Bmp, and Tgfβ signaling in the early development of the cranial base by detecting expression of Ptch1 and Gli1 (transcriptional targets of Hh signaling), β-catenin (effector of canonical Wnt signaling), p-Smad1/5/8 (transducer of Bmp signaling), and p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 (effector of canonical Tgfβ signaling) respectively.At E10.5, the presumptive cranial base area had not yet displayed cell condensation (Fig. 10A, arrowheads), but Sox9-positive loose mesenchymal cells (Fig. 10B, arrowheads) indicated its chondrogenic fate, while expression of Gli1 (Fig. 10E, arrowheads) and Ptch1 (Fig. 10F, arrowheads) suggests that Hh signaling has been activated in the skull base. We did not detect the Ihh expression in the adjacent areas of the cranial base (Fig. 10C, white arrowheads), except for the developing vessels (Fig. 10C, red arrowhead) and the ventral epithelium of the neural tube (Fig. 10C, yellow arrowhead), and the normal location of Shh was detected in the dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium (Fig. 10D, white arrowheads) and the ventral epithelium of neural tube (Fig. 10D, yellow arrowhead). Meanwhile, we found the expression of β-catenin in the developing cranial base (Fig. 10G, arrowheads), whereas smad-dependent Bmp signaling was dormant in the cranial base at E10.5 (Fig. 10H, black arrowheads), despite expression in labial side of first branchial arch (Fig. 10H, red arrowhead). In addition, we detected the expression of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 in the cranial base region of E10.5, suggesting activation of Tgfβ signaling (Fig. 10I, arrowhead; sFigure 9 A, B).Fig. 10Activated Shh and Wnt signaling and silenced BMP signaling in the cranial base of E10.5 mice. A–I Serial midsagittal sections of E10.5 embryos were analyzed by HE staining (A), and immunofluorescence (B–D, F, I), immunochemistry (G, H), and RNAscope (E) staining for the indicated genes, n = 3. A shows an enlarged image of a dotted field from the inset image, and the inset in B–I shows a higher magnification view of the dotted frame. Arrows in A and C highlight the notochord. Black arrowheads in A denote the presumptive cartilage of the cranial base, which is marked by Sox9-positive cells in B. White or black arrowheads in inset images of B–I denote the mesenchymal or epithelial cells of presumptive cranial base. Yellow arrowheads in C and D indicate the ventral epithelium of the neural tube. Red arrowheads point to the developing vessel in C and aboral side of ba1 in H.

(ba1) First branchial arch; (r) Rathke’s pouchVismodegib treatment at E10.5 upregulates Wnt signaling in the cranial baseIn E11.5 control mice, condensed mesenchymal cells of cranial base were clearly visible (Fig. 11A, arrows), and vigorous expression of Sox9 indicated chondrogenesis (Fig. 11B, arrows), while Ptch1 and Gli1 expression was more intense (Fig. 11C, D, arrows). The location of β-catenin is slightly nuclear, moderately cytoplasmic and most abundant at cell junctions in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells of the cranial base (Fig. 11E, F, arrows and arrowhead), and the Lef1, a transcriptional regulator of Wnt, is barely detectable in the mesenchymal cells (Fig. 11G, arrow) and visible in the epithelium (Fig. 11G, arrowheads). Similarly, the cranial base region of the E11.5 Vismodegib-exposed mice showed condensed mesenchymal cells and Sox9 expression (Fig. 11H, I, arrows), suggesting a comparable chondrogenic process compared to the control, albeit the number of mesenchymal cells was visibly reduced. As expected, the Ptch1 and Gli1 expression in the cranial base was significantly downregulated (Fig. 11J, K, arrows, compared to C, D) (Fig. 11O, P), demonstrating the antagonistic effect of Vismodegib on the Hh pathway. β-catenin transcription was significantly upregulated (Fig. 11L, arrows and arrowhead, compared to E) (Fig. 11Q), despite the β-catenin protein localization in the nucleus of cranial base cells was not statistically different (Fig. 11M, arrows, compared to F) (Fig. 11R). In addition, the Lef1 expression was only slightly upregulated in the oropharyngeal epithelium adjacent to the skull base (Fig. 11N, arrowheads, compared to G).Fig. 11Upregulated canonical-Wnt signaling of the presumptive cranial base in E11.5 after Hh signaling was inhibited. A–L Serial sections from the parasagittal skull of E11.5 Vehicle (A–G) and Vismodegib groups (H–N) were subjected to HE staining (A, H), immunochemistry (F, M), and immunofluorescence (B, C, G, I, J, N) and RNAscope (D, E, K, L) analysis of the indicated makers, n = 3.

The Sox9-positive cells delineate the presumptive skull base (Fig. 12C, green and yellow arrow), while a small amount of Runx2 expression was detected in chondrogenic cells of the developing cranial base (Fig. 12D, orange and yellow arrow). Ptch1 and Gli1 expression remained active in the cranial base cells (Fig. 12E, F, arrow and arrowheads), and a small amount of active β-catenin transcription (Fig. 12G) and nuclear localization of β-catenin protein (Fig. 12H) was found in chondrocytes (Fig. 12G, H, arrows) and surrounding cells of the cartilage (Fig. 12G, H, arrowheads), while Lef1 expression was only moderately detected in the dorsal mesenchymal cells of the cranial base cartilage (Fig. 12I, white arrow). The cranial base of Vismodegib-exposed mice exhibited a nearly equivalent process of cartilage differentiation (Fig. 12J) marked by Sox9-and Col II-positive areas (Fig. 12K, L, compared to B, C), where Ptch1 and Gli1 expression was not significantly different from the control group (Fig. 12N, O, arrows and arrowheads, compared to E, F) (Fig. 12S, T). Unexpectedly, ectopic Runx2 expression was detected in the ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base cartilage in Vismodegib-treated mice at E12.5 (Fig. 12M, arrowheads, compared to D) (Fig. 12U), and upregulated β-catenin transcription (Fig. 12P, arrowheads, compared to G) (Fig. 12V) and nuclear localization of β-catenin protein (Fig. 12Q, arrowheads, compared to H) (Fig. 12W) as well as ectopic expression of Lef1(Fig. 12R, arrowheads, compared to I) (Fig. 12X) were also observed in the same areas. In addition, ectopic expression of Lef1 in ventral mesenchymal cells of the skull base cartilage of Vismodegib-exposed embryos was still detectable at E13.5 (sFigure 12G, arrowheads, compared to C), but the expression of Runx2 (sFigure 12B, F, arrows) and β-catenin (sFigure 12D, H, arrows and arrowheads) was comparable between the Vehicle- and Vismodegib-treated mice. Nonetheless, the expression of β-catenin and Lef1 were no visibly different between the Vismodegib and control groups at E14.5 (data not shown).Fig. 12Increased Wnt signaling and ectopic activation of Lef1 and Runx2 in the ventral mesenchymal cells of cranial base cartilage in E12.5 mice exposed to Vismodegib. A–P Serial sections from the parasagittal cranial base of E12.5 Vehicle- (A–I) and Vismodegib-group (J–R) were subjected to HE staining (A, J), immunochemistry (H, Q), and immunofluorescence (B-E, I, K-N, R) and RNAscope (F, G, O, P) analysis of the indicated genes, n = 3.

Dose-dependent effect of Shh in the early development of cranial baseSince administration of Vismodegib in 150 mg/kg dose exhibited cranial base craniosynostosis, a completely different phenotype of cranial base compared to the Shh-null mice or Wnt1-cre;smon/c mice, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of Shh in the early development of skull base. To test this, we examined the cranial base phenotype following different levels of Shh inhibition by different doses of administration. In general, the severity of the cranial base deformities worsened with increasing dose of Vismodegib exposure (Fig. 1), with the 50 mg/kg treated mice displaying partial premature fusion of basi-exoccipital synchondrosis (IOS) (Fig. 1B, red arrows, compared to A), and 100 mg/kg exposed animals showing premature closure of IOS and spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS) (Fig. 1C, red arrows, yellow arrow). Precocious mineralization of IOS, SOS, and intersphenoidal synchondrosis (ISS) were significant at 150 mg/kg administrated mice (Fig. 1D, arrows). Embryos exposed to 200 mg/kg Vismodegib demonstrated premature closure of cranial base synchondrosis and the smaller skull (Fig. 1E, arrows), in which the severe phenotype of cranial base that most central structures of cranial base are missing mimicked that of the Shh-deficient mice [22, 25] (Fig. 1F, arrows).Fig. 1Dose-dependent phenotypes of Vismodegib in cranial base synchondroses of mice.

Dose-dependent effect of Shh in the early development of cranial base

Since administration of Vismodegib in 150 mg/kg dose exhibited cranial base craniosynostosis, a completely different phenotype of cranial base compared to the Shh-null mice or Wnt1-cre;smon/c mice, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of Shh in the early development of skull base. To test this, we examined the cranial base phenotype following different levels of Shh inhibition by different doses of administration. In general, the severity of the cranial base deformities worsened with increasing dose of Vismodegib exposure (Fig. 1), with the 50 mg/kg treated mice displaying partial premature fusion of basi-exoccipital synchondrosis (IOS) (Fig. 1B, red arrows, compared to A), and 100 mg/kg exposed animals showing premature closure of IOS and spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS) (Fig. 1C, red arrows, yellow arrow). Precocious mineralization of IOS, SOS, and intersphenoidal synchondrosis (ISS) were significant at 150 mg/kg administrated mice (Fig. 1D, arrows). Embryos exposed to 200 mg/kg Vismodegib demonstrated premature closure of cranial base synchondrosis and the smaller skull (Fig. 1E, arrows), in which the severe phenotype of cranial base that most central structures of cranial base are missing mimicked that of the Shh-deficient mice [22, 25] (Fig. 1F, arrows).Fig. 1Dose-dependent phenotypes of Vismodegib in cranial base synchondroses of mice.

Cranial base craniosynostosis in E17.5 mice exposed to Vismodegib at E10.5Our previous study showed that mice treated to 150 mg/kg Vismodegib at E9.5 or E10.5 exhibited premature closure of cranial base synchondrosis, with the highest incidence of malformations (100%) and the lowest rate of stillbirths (2.8%) in the E10.5 administration group [44]. Therefore, we used E10.5−exposed mice as the target of the present study. Mice exposed to Vismodegib at E10.5 displayed premature fusion of SOS (Fig. 2F, G, red arrows), IOS (Fig. 2F, G, white arrows), and alisphenoid synchondrosis (ALS) (Fig. 2G, green arrow) in ventral views of gross dissection and micro−CT, compared to Vehicle−treated animals (Fig. 2A, B, corresponding colored arrows). The E17.5 Vehicle−exposed mice showed the well−patterned cranial base consisting of ossification centers (basioccipital bone and basisphenoid bone) (Fig. 2C, bs and bo) and intervening synchondroses (Fig. 2C, yellow arrow, red arrow, and black arrow in the inset). The hypertrophic chondrocyte zone of the synchondrosis and ossification center was marked by Collagen (Col) X [4, 50] (Fig. 2D, orange; sFigure 1) and Col I [4] (Fig. 2E, orange; sFigure 1), respectively. Embryos treated to Vismodegib demonstrated prematurely hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes (Fig. 2H, yellow arrow, red arrow and black arrow in the inset) and trabecular bone formation (Fig. 2H, yellow arrowhead and red arrowhead) in ISS and SOS, as proven by expression of Col X (Fig. 2I, yellow arrow and red arrow) and Col I (Fig. 2J, yellow arrow and red arrow).Fig. 2Chondrocyte terminal differentiation and osteogenesis are accelerated in the cranial base synchondrosis of Vismodegib-treated mice at E17.5.

Cranial base craniosynostosis in E17.5 mice exposed to Vismodegib at E10.5

Our previous study showed that mice treated to 150 mg/kg Vismodegib at E9.5 or E10.5 exhibited premature closure of cranial base synchondrosis, with the highest incidence of malformations (100%) and the lowest rate of stillbirths (2.8%) in the E10.5 administration group [44]. Therefore, we used E10.5−exposed mice as the target of the present study.

Early patterning of the skull base is approximately normal, but terminal differentiation and osteogenesis synchondrosis are accelerated subsequentlyWe next ask if the cranial base craniosynostosis of Vismodegib−treated mice is caused by disrupted early patterning of the skull base. In the control mice, the major skull base cartilage appears at E14.5 (Fig. 3A), followed by the ossification of basisphenoid bone emerge at E15.5 (Fig. 3B), and the presphenoid bone ossifies at E17.5 (Fig. 3D). In comparison, Vismodegib−group showed the comparable patterning of cranial base in E14.5 (Fig. 3E). However, precocious mineralization of IOS is evident at E15.5 (Fig. 3F, yellow arrow), and the ossification of ISS and SOS are emerging and more extensive at E16.5 (Fig. 3G, black arrow and red arrow) and E17.5 (Fig. 3H, black arrow and red arrow), respectively.Fig. 3Early patterning of the skull base is largely normal, but premature ossification of synchondrosis occurs after E14.5 in Vismodegib-treated embryos. A–H Ventral views of the skeletal preparations of control (A–D) and Vismodegib-exposed mice (E–H) at a different stage, red denotes bone, and blue, cartilage. The inset shows a higher magnification image of the dotted frame. The red arrow, black arrow, and yellow arrow point to spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS), intersphenoidal synchondrosis (ISS), and basi-exoccipital synchondrosis (IOS), respectively. In Vismodegib-treated mice, premature ossification of the IOS occurred at E15.5, whereas premature mineralization of the SOS and ISS appeared after E15.5. Scale bar = 1000 μm in A–H, 1000 μm in enlarged frame of A–H. (bo) basioccipital bone; (bs) basisphenoid bone; (eo) exoccipital boneSimilar to the Alcian blue and alizarin red staining, SOS in Vehicle− and Vismodegib−exposed mice at E14.5 demonstrated similar histological manifestations (Fig. 4A, F), indicated by Col II occupied in the immature cartilage zone[51] and Col X labeled in the hypertrophic cartilage area (Fig. 4B, G). The early osteogenic markers Runx2 [52, 53], Osterix (Osx) [54], and Col I were also normally expressed in the periosteum of hypertrophic cartilage in control (Fig. 4C–E, white and red arrows) and Vismodegib−treated mice (Fig. 4H–J, white and red arrows), reminiscent of the equivalent osteogenic process at this stage. In spite of differences with the skeletal preparation, SOS of E15.5 Vismodegib group already showed premature hypertrophic differentiation (Fig. 5F, compared to A), denoted by a narrowed Col II−positive region (Fig. 5G, orange, compared to B) and an expanded Col X−expressing area (Fig. 5G, green, compared to B), while the expression range of Runx2, Osx, and Col I on both sides of the SOS extended towards to the center (Fig. 5H, I, J, arrows, compared to C, D, E, respectively), demonstrating that the SOS undergoes accelerated chondrocyte maturation and osteogenesis.Fig. 4Chondrocyte differentiation and osteogenesis of cranial base synchondrosis is similar between control and Vismodegib-group at E14.5.

A large number of early osteogenic markers (Fig. 6I–K, arrows, compared to C–E) were prematurely expressed on the SOS periosteum, as well as the vascularization label (CD31) [55] emerged in SOS (Fig. 6L, red arrows, compared to F), which suggesting the active osteogenesis in SOS, as the vascular invasion is the key step for the replacement of cartilage by bone [56]. Premature osteogenesis in the SOS of Vismodegib−exposed embryos was more severe at E17.5, as evidenced by mineralized connections in the cranial base synchondroses (Fig. 7I, colored arrows, compared to A) and the formation of bone trabeculae within the SOS (Fig. 7J, SOS, compared to B). In addition to the expression of the early osteogenic markers Runx2, Osx, and Col I (Fig. 7K–M, arrows, compared to C–E), the expression of the late osteogenic label Osteocalcin (Oc) that normally express in terminally differentiated osteoblasts of ossification centers was detected in the SOS (Fig. 7O, red arrows, compared to G), as well as the detection of Trap−positive osteoclasts (Fig. 7N, red arrows, compared to F) and the expression of CD31 (Fig. 7P, red arrows, compared to H) in the SOS of E17.5 Vismodegib−exposed mice.Fig. 6The SOS of E16.5 Vismodegib-exposed embryos shown prematurely chondrocyte maturation and osteogenesis. A–J Serial sections from the midsagittal cranial base of E16.5 Vehicle- (A–F) and Vismodegib-group (G–L) were subjected to HE staining (A, G), and immunofluorescence (B–D, H–J) and immunochemistry (E, F, K, L) staining of the indicated genes, n = 3.

Early patterning of the skull base is approximately normal, but terminal differentiation and osteogenesis synchondrosis are accelerated subsequently

We next ask if the cranial base craniosynostosis of Vismodegib−treated mice is caused by disrupted early patterning of the skull base. In the control mice, the major skull base cartilage appears at E14.5 (Fig. 3A), followed by the ossification of basisphenoid bone emerge at E15.5 (Fig. 3B), and the presphenoid bone ossifies at E17.5 (Fig. 3D). In comparison, Vismodegib−group showed the comparable patterning of cranial base in E14.5 (Fig. 3E). However, precocious mineralization of IOS is evident at E15.5 (Fig. 3F, yellow arrow), and the ossification of ISS and SOS are emerging and more extensive at E16.5 (Fig. 3G, black arrow and red arrow) and E17.5 (Fig. 3H, black arrow and red arrow), respectively.Fig. 3Early patterning of the skull base is largely normal, but premature ossification of synchondrosis occurs after E14.5 in Vismodegib-treated embryos.

Similar to the Alcian blue and alizarin red staining, SOS in Vehicle− and Vismodegib−exposed mice at E14.5 demonstrated similar histological manifestations (Fig. 4A, F), indicated by Col II occupied in the immature cartilage zone[51] and Col X labeled in the hypertrophic cartilage area (Fig. 4B, G).

At E16.5, the hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes was complete in the SOS of the Vismodigib group (Fig. 6G, compared to A), as shown by the replacement of the Col II−positive area by the Col X−expressing zone in the SOS (Fig. 6H, green, compared to B, orange). A large number of early osteogenic markers (Fig. 6I–K, arrows, compared to C–E) were prematurely expressed on the SOS periosteum, as well as the vascularization label (CD31) [55] emerged in SOS (Fig. 6L, red arrows, compared to F), which suggesting the active osteogenesis in SOS, as the vascular invasion is the key step for the replacement of cartilage by bone [56].

As implicated by the above results, terminal chondrocyte differentiation and osteogenesis were precocious in Vismodegib−treated animals after E14.5.

Cranial base craniosynostosis inVismodegib-exposed mice is not caused by inhibition of the Ihh-PTHrP pathway or diminished proliferation of the chondrocyte in synchondrosisThe development of the skull base follows the endochondral osteogenesis procedure. Immature chondrocytes of synchondrosis undergo proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation, and apoptosis and eventually replacement by bone. Ihh-PTHrP pathway regulates the rate of chondrocyte maturation [17, 20, 33, 34]. Ihh-null mice displayed extensive hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes in cranial base synchondrosis due to PTHrP reduction [17]. To test if premature maturation of skull base synchondrosis resulted, in part, from similar mechanisms, the expression of transcriptional targets of Hh signaling (Gli1 and Ptch1), Ihh and PTHrP in the SOS of Vehicle- and Vismodegib-mice at E14.5 and E15.5 were examined. At E14.5 and 15.5, control SOS already showed well-established growth plates (Figs. 8A and 9A) with Ihh-positive in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes and periosteum of the hypertrophic chondrocyte zone (Figs. 8B and 9B, arrows and arrowheads) and Ptch1- and Gli1-expressing in proliferating chondrocytes and periosteum of the hypertrophic chondrocyte area (Figs. 8C–F and 9C–F, arrows and arrowheads). PTHrP was located throughout the reserve and proliferative areas of the SOS and periosteum flanking the hypertrophic chondrocyte area (Figs. 8G and 9G, arrows and arrowheads). Surprisingly, the expression pattern of Ihh, Ptch1, Gli1, and PTHrP in SOS of Vismodegib-exposed mice is comparable with control mice at E14.5 (Fig. 8J–O, arrows and arrowheads, compared to B–G), and the PTHrP expression was also not significantly different (Fig. 8S), despite the expression of Ptch1 and Gli1 in Vismodegib-mice was statistically higher than that in the Vehicle group (Fig. 8K–N, arrows and arrowheads, compared to C–F) (Fig. 8Q, R). Even by E15.5, when most chondrocytes in the SOS of the Vismodegib group had undergone terminal differentiation, the Ihh, Ptch1, Gli1, and PTHrP were still clearly detectable in the remaining immature cartilage and periosteum flanking the hypertrophic cartilage (Fig. 9I–N, arrows and arrowheads, compared to B–G), and the expression of PTHrP in Vismodegib-exposed mice was statistically higher than that in the Vehicle-treated mice (sFigure 7P). However, the expression of Gli1 was no statistically different between the Vismodegib and Vehicle groups at E14.5 (sFigure 7O). The above observation suggests that disruption of Ihh-PTHrP is not the cause for cranial base synostosis in Vismodegib-exposed embryos.Fig. 8Expression of chondrocyte-maturation-regulated genes and proliferative mark is not inhibited in the SOS of E14.5 Vismodegib-exposed mice. A–P Serial sections from the midsagittal SOS of E14.5 Vehicle- (A–E) and Vismodegib-group (F–J) were processed for immunofluorescence (A–D, G, I-L, O), RNAscope (E, F, M, N), and immunochemistry (H, P) analysis, orange or green indicates the corresponding target genes, and blue denotes DAPI.

Phh3-positive chondrocytes were readily detected in the central reserve area and proliferative zones of SOS in Vehicle- and Vismodegib-treated embryos (Fig. 8H, P, arrows), and expression was statistically increased in the Vismodegib-exposed mice compared to the control group (Fig. 8T), indicating that premature closure of the cranial base is not secondary to reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in synchondrosis.

Cranial base craniosynostosis inVismodegib-exposed mice is not caused by inhibition of the Ihh-PTHrP pathway or diminished proliferation of the chondrocyte in synchondrosis

The development of the skull base follows the endochondral osteogenesis procedure. Immature chondrocytes of synchondrosis undergo proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation, and apoptosis and eventually replacement by bone. Ihh-PTHrP pathway regulates the rate of chondrocyte maturation [17, 20, 33, 34]. Ihh-null mice displayed extensive hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes in cranial base synchondrosis due to PTHrP reduction [17]. To test if premature maturation of skull base synchondrosis resulted, in part, from similar mechanisms, the expression of transcriptional targets of Hh signaling (Gli1 and Ptch1), Ihh and PTHrP in the SOS of Vehicle- and Vismodegib-mice at E14.5 and E15.5 were examined. At E14.5 and 15.5, control SOS already showed well-established growth plates (Figs. 8A and 9A) with Ihh-positive in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes and periosteum of the hypertrophic chondrocyte zone (Figs. 8B and 9B, arrows and arrowheads) and Ptch1- and Gli1-expressing in proliferating chondrocytes and periosteum of the hypertrophic chondrocyte area (Figs. 8C–F and 9C–F, arrows and arrowheads). PTHrP was located throughout the reserve and proliferative areas of the SOS and periosteum flanking the hypertrophic chondrocyte area (Figs. 8G and 9G, arrows and arrowheads). Surprisingly, the expression pattern of Ihh, Ptch1, Gli1, and PTHrP in SOS of Vismodegib-exposed mice is comparable with control mice at E14.5 (Fig. 8J–O, arrows and arrowheads, compared to B–G), and the PTHrP expression was also not significantly different (Fig. 8S), despite the expression of Ptch1 and Gli1 in Vismodegib-mice was statistically higher than that in the Vehicle group (Fig. 8K–N, arrows and arrowheads, compared to C–F) (Fig. 8Q, R). Even by E15.5, when most chondrocytes in the SOS of the Vismodegib group had undergone terminal differentiation, the Ihh, Ptch1, Gli1, and PTHrP were still clearly detectable in the remaining immature cartilage and periosteum flanking the hypertrophic cartilage (Fig. 9I–N, arrows and arrowheads, compared to B–G), and the expression of PTHrP in Vismodegib-exposed mice was statistically higher than that in the Vehicle-treated mice (sFigure 7P). However, the expression of Gli1 was no statistically different between the Vismodegib and Vehicle groups at E14.5 (sFigure 7O). The above observation suggests that disruption of Ihh-PTHrP is not the cause for cranial base synostosis in Vismodegib-exposed embryos.Fig. 8Expression of chondrocyte-maturation-regulated genes and proliferative mark is not inhibited in the SOS of E14.5 Vismodegib-exposed mice.

Expression pattern of chondrocyte-maturation-regulated genes is comparable in the SOS of E15.5 Vehicle- and Vismodegib-exposed embryos. A–N Serial sections from the parasagittal SOS of Vehicle- (A–G) and Vismodegib-group (E–N) in E15.5 were performed immunofluorescence (A–D, G, H–K, N) and RNAscope (E, F, L, M) analysis of the indicated genes, orange or green indicates the related genes, and blue denotes DAPI.

To test whether premature closure of the cranial base synchondrosis was due to decreased chondrocyte proliferation, the SOS of E14.5 control and Vismodegib groups were processed for expression of Phh3, a marker of proliferating cells. Phh3-positive chondrocytes were readily detected in the central reserve area and proliferative zones of SOS in Vehicle- and Vismodegib-treated embryos (Fig. 8H, P, arrows), and expression was statistically increased in the Vismodegib-exposed mice compared to the control group (Fig. 8T), indicating that premature closure of the cranial base is not secondary to reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in synchondrosis.

Activation of Shh and Wnt in early morphogenesis of cranial baseOur previous study has shown that administration of Vismodegib at E10.5 can effectively inhibit Hh signaling at E11.5 [44], but the expression of Ptch1 and Gli1 was upregulated in the exposed mice compared to the control group at E14.5, suggesting that the disruption of Hh in embryos by maternally administered Vismodegib is not sustained, and further implying that the unique molecular events mediated by Hh signaling have occurred in the cranial base region at E10.5. Therefore, we evaluated the activation of the Hh, Wnt, Bmp, and Tgfβ signaling in the early development of the cranial base by detecting expression of Ptch1 and Gli1 (transcriptional targets of Hh signaling), β-catenin (effector of canonical Wnt signaling), p-Smad1/5/8 (transducer of Bmp signaling), and p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 (effector of canonical Tgfβ signaling) respectively.At E10.5, the presumptive cranial base area had not yet displayed cell condensation (Fig. 10A, arrowheads), but Sox9-positive loose mesenchymal cells (Fig. 10B, arrowheads) indicated its chondrogenic fate, while expression of Gli1 (Fig. 10E, arrowheads) and Ptch1 (Fig. 10F, arrowheads) suggests that Hh signaling has been activated in the skull base. We did not detect the Ihh expression in the adjacent areas of the cranial base (Fig. 10C, white arrowheads), except for the developing vessels (Fig. 10C, red arrowhead) and the ventral epithelium of the neural tube (Fig. 10C, yellow arrowhead), and the normal location of Shh was detected in the dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium (Fig. 10D, white arrowheads) and the ventral epithelium of neural tube (Fig. 10D, yellow arrowhead). Meanwhile, we found the expression of β-catenin in the developing cranial base (Fig. 10G, arrowheads), whereas smad-dependent Bmp signaling was dormant in the cranial base at E10.5 (Fig. 10H, black arrowheads), despite expression in labial side of first branchial arch (Fig. 10H, red arrowhead). In addition, we detected the expression of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 in the cranial base region of E10.5, suggesting activation of Tgfβ signaling (Fig. 10I, arrowhead; sFigure 9 A, B).Fig. 10Activated Shh and Wnt signaling and silenced BMP signaling in the cranial base of E10.5 mice.

Vismodegib treatment at E10.5 upregulates Wnt signaling in the cranial baseIn E11.5 control mice, condensed mesenchymal cells of cranial base were clearly visible (Fig. 11A, arrows), and vigorous expression of Sox9 indicated chondrogenesis (Fig. 11B, arrows), while Ptch1 and Gli1 expression was more intense (Fig. 11C, D, arrows). The location of β-catenin is slightly nuclear, moderately cytoplasmic and most abundant at cell junctions in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells of the cranial base (Fig. 11E, F, arrows and arrowhead), and the Lef1, a transcriptional regulator of Wnt, is barely detectable in the mesenchymal cells (Fig. 11G, arrow) and visible in the epithelium (Fig. 11G, arrowheads). Similarly, the cranial base region of the E11.5 Vismodegib-exposed mice showed condensed mesenchymal cells and Sox9 expression (Fig. 11H, I, arrows), suggesting a comparable chondrogenic process compared to the control, albeit the number of mesenchymal cells was visibly reduced. As expected, the Ptch1 and Gli1 expression in the cranial base was significantly downregulated (Fig. 11J, K, arrows, compared to C, D) (Fig. 11O, P), demonstrating the antagonistic effect of Vismodegib on the Hh pathway. β-catenin transcription was significantly upregulated (Fig. 11L, arrows and arrowhead, compared to E) (Fig. 11Q), despite the β-catenin protein localization in the nucleus of cranial base cells was not statistically different (Fig. 11M, arrows, compared to F) (Fig. 11R). In addition, the Lef1 expression was only slightly upregulated in the oropharyngeal epithelium adjacent to the skull base (Fig. 11N, arrowheads, compared to G).Fig. 11Upregulated canonical-Wnt signaling of the presumptive cranial base in E11.5 after Hh signaling was inhibited. A–L Serial sections from the parasagittal skull of E11.5 Vehicle (A–G) and Vismodegib groups (H–N) were subjected to HE staining (A, H), immunochemistry (F, M), and immunofluorescence (B, C, G, I, J, N) and RNAscope (D, E, K, L) analysis of the indicated makers, n = 3.

The Sox9-positive cells delineate the presumptive skull base (Fig. 12C, green and yellow arrow), while a small amount of Runx2 expression was detected in chondrogenic cells of the developing cranial base (Fig. 12D, orange and yellow arrow). Ptch1 and Gli1 expression remained active in the cranial base cells (Fig. 12E, F, arrow and arrowheads), and a small amount of active β-catenin transcription (Fig. 12G) and nuclear localization of β-catenin protein (Fig. 12H) was found in chondrocytes (Fig. 12G, H, arrows) and surrounding cells of the cartilage (Fig. 12G, H, arrowheads), while Lef1 expression was only moderately detected in the dorsal mesenchymal cells of the cranial base cartilage (Fig. 12I, white arrow). The cranial base of Vismodegib-exposed mice exhibited a nearly equivalent process of cartilage differentiation (Fig. 12J) marked by Sox9-and Col II-positive areas (Fig. 12K, L, compared to B, C), where Ptch1 and Gli1 expression was not significantly different from the control group (Fig. 12N, O, arrows and arrowheads, compared to E, F) (Fig. 12S, T). Unexpectedly, ectopic Runx2 expression was detected in the ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base cartilage in Vismodegib-treated mice at E12.5 (Fig. 12M, arrowheads, compared to D) (Fig. 12U), and upregulated β-catenin transcription (Fig. 12P, arrowheads, compared to G) (Fig. 12V) and nuclear localization of β-catenin protein (Fig. 12Q, arrowheads, compared to H) (Fig. 12W) as well as ectopic expression of Lef1(Fig. 12R, arrowheads, compared to I) (Fig. 12X) were also observed in the same areas. In addition, ectopic expression of Lef1 in ventral mesenchymal cells of the skull base cartilage of Vismodegib-exposed embryos was still detectable at E13.5 (sFigure 12G, arrowheads, compared to C), but the expression of Runx2 (sFigure 12B, F, arrows) and β-catenin (sFigure 12D, H, arrows and arrowheads) was comparable between the Vehicle- and Vismodegib-treated mice. Nonetheless, the expression of β-catenin and Lef1 were no visibly different between the Vismodegib and control groups at E14.5 (data not shown).Fig. 12Increased Wnt signaling and ectopic activation of Lef1 and Runx2 in the ventral mesenchymal cells of cranial base cartilage in E12.5 mice exposed to Vismodegib.

Vismodegib treatment at E10.5 upregulates Wnt signaling in the cranial base

In E11.5 control mice, condensed mesenchymal cells of cranial base were clearly visible (Fig. 11A, arrows), and vigorous expression of Sox9 indicated chondrogenesis (Fig. 11B, arrows), while Ptch1 and Gli1 expression was more intense (Fig. 11C, D, arrows). The location of β-catenin is slightly nuclear, moderately cytoplasmic and most abundant at cell junctions in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells of the cranial base (Fig. 11E, F, arrows and arrowhead), and the Lef1, a transcriptional regulator of Wnt, is barely detectable in the mesenchymal cells (Fig. 11G, arrow) and visible in the epithelium (Fig. 11G, arrowheads). Similarly, the cranial base region of the E11.5 Vismodegib-exposed mice showed condensed mesenchymal cells and Sox9 expression (Fig. 11H, I, arrows), suggesting a comparable chondrogenic process compared to the control, albeit the number of mesenchymal cells was visibly reduced. As expected, the Ptch1 and Gli1 expression in the cranial base was significantly downregulated (Fig. 11J, K, arrows, compared to C, D) (Fig. 11O, P), demonstrating the antagonistic effect of Vismodegib on the Hh pathway. β-catenin transcription was significantly upregulated (Fig. 11L, arrows and arrowhead, compared to E) (Fig. 11Q), despite the β-catenin protein localization in the nucleus of cranial base cells was not statistically different (Fig. 11M, arrows, compared to F) (Fig. 11R).

By E12.5, the cranial base cartilage in control embryos is rapidly forming (Fig. 12A) and Col II expression demonstrates the active secretion of cartilage matrix (Fig. 12B, orange).

The cranial base of Vismodegib-exposed mice exhibited a nearly equivalent process of cartilage differentiation (Fig. 12J) marked by Sox9-and Col II-positive areas (Fig. 12K, L, compared to B, C), where Ptch1 and Gli1 expression was not significantly different from the control group (Fig. 12N, O, arrows and arrowheads, compared to E, F) (Fig. 12S, T). Unexpectedly, ectopic Runx2 expression was detected in the ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base cartilage in Vismodegib-treated mice at E12.5 (Fig. 12M, arrowheads, compared to D) (Fig. 12U), and upregulated β-catenin transcription (Fig. 12P, arrowheads, compared to G) (Fig. 12V) and nuclear localization of β-catenin protein (Fig. 12Q, arrowheads, compared to H) (Fig. 12W) as well as ectopic expression of Lef1(Fig. 12R, arrowheads, compared to I) (Fig. 12X) were also observed in the same areas. In addition, ectopic expression of Lef1 in ventral mesenchymal cells of the skull base cartilage of Vismodegib-exposed embryos was still detectable at E13.5 (sFigure 12G, arrowheads, compared to C), but the expression of Runx2 (sFigure 12B, F, arrows) and β-catenin (sFigure 12D, H, arrows and arrowheads) was comparable between the Vehicle- and Vismodegib-treated mice. Nonetheless, the expression of β-catenin and Lef1 were no visibly different between the Vismodegib and control groups at E14.5 (data not shown).Fig. 12Increased Wnt signaling and ectopic activation of Lef1 and Runx2 in the ventral mesenchymal cells of cranial base cartilage in E12.5 mice exposed to Vismodegib.

DiscussionPremature ossification of the cranial base synchondroses, which are considered to be important sites for growth of the cranial base and midface growth, may result in facial deformities [1, 9, 10]. Patients with these malformations may undergo complex lifelong surgery [57]. Therefore, exploring the etiology of premature closure of the cranial base may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of such disorders. Despite a number of studies have been conducted on late embryonic and postnatal skull base development [12, 13, 29, 58], current knowledge of early development of cranial base and the molecular mechanisms involved remains largely unexplored. This is due to the fact that studies involving ablation of key genes often result in precocious embryonic death or cranial base deletion [22, 25, 26, 59–61], which in turn limits further studies of early skull base development. Our previous studies have exhibited that mice exposed to Vismodegib in E9.5 or E10.5 lead to premature fusion of the cranial base synchondroses by examining the development of the cranial base in mice following administration of 150 mg/kg Vismodegib at E7.5-E13.5 [44]. In addition, Vismodegib exposure between E9.5 and E10.5 led to high rates micrognathia and ectrodactyly/brachydactyly [44]. In addition, clinical trials and practice have shown that Vismodegib 150–540 mg/d has demonstrated good anti-tumor activity and an encouraging safety profile in patients with solid tumors that are refractory to therapy or for which there are no standard therapies (e.g., advanced basal cell carcinoma or medulloblastoma) [48, 62]. In the current study, we further examined the underlying mechanisms. Generally, embryos treated to Vismodegib display precocious terminal differentiation and osteogenesis of the cranial base synchondroses after E14.5. Nevertheless, in contrast to the Ihh-deficient research, the accelerated hypertrophic differentiation of synchondrosis was not secondary to disruption of the Ihh-PTHrP pathway or reduction of chondrocyte proliferation after Vismodegib administration. Since cranial base synostosis only developed following Vismodegib administration at E9.5 or E10.5, we examined the signaling pathways in early development of cranial base. The result showed that Shh and Wnt signaling were activated at E10.5, yet Bmp signaling and Ihh were latent. Administration of Vismodegib at E10.5 transiently disrupted Shh signaling, resulting in upregulated β-catenin expression and ectopic expression of Lef1 and Runx2 in the ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base primordium at E12.5. Different levels of cranial base synostosis caused by various doses of Vismodegib suggest a gradient effect of Shh in early development of cranial base. Our study denotes the antagonistic effect of Shh signaling on Wnt signaling, which ensures normal embryonic development of the cranial base.A novel model of cranial base craniosynostosis induced by Hh inhibitorThe absence of skull base structures after Shh or Smo gene ablation suggests that the developmental regulation of the cranial base by Hh signaling is more than a series of chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and osteogenesis as shown by Ihh deletion [17, 21, 22, 25]. However, further study for Hh pathway in early development of cranial base was precluded owing to early stillbirth or apoptosis of cranial base anlages in Shh-ablation or Smo-deficient mice [21, 22, 25]. By utilizing Vismodegib, a potent inhibitor of the Hh pathway, at different embryonic stages during early basicranium development, we proved that partial interruption of Hh signaling at E9.5 or E10.5 produces premature closure of the skull base synchondroses [44]. In this study, mice exposed to Vismodegib showed precocious endochondral osteogenesis of the cranial base synchondroses after E14.5, indicated by the premature expression of hypertrophic cartilage marker (Col X) and early osteogenesis markers (Runx2, Osx, Col I) in synchondrosis at E14.5-E16.5, as well as the expression of Oc, a terminal osteogenesis label and osteoclast at E17.5. Based on the interference with Hh signaling, the premature hypertrophic differentiation of cranial base synchondrosis in Vismodegib-treated embryos is easily reminiscent of Ihh knockout mice [17], which display a similar phenotype. However, the expression of Ptch1, Gli1, and PTHrP was not downregulated in the Vismodegib group compared to the control group, thus ruling out this possibility. Elevated Phh3 expression in the SOS at E14.5 suggests that diminished proliferation of synchondrosis is not the reason for the Vismodegib-induced craniosynostosis. These detection results are not surprising because the half-life of 100 mg/kg Vismodegib in the mouse is 25.3 h [63], which means that the effective inhibition of Hh by a single dose of Vismodegib at E10.5 probably fades at E14.5, when the premature fusion of cranial base synchondroses has not yet begun, despite the fact that there are no studies for the pharmacokinetics in embryos after maternal dosing. Therefore, our studies provide a new model of skull base craniosynostosis displaying that disturbance of Hh signaling at the early stage of cranial base morphogenesis leads to premature closure of the cranial base synchondrosis at the late stage of embryonic development, implying a new role of Hh signaling in early development of cranial base.Activation of signaling in early cranial base morphogenesisGiven that vismodegib−induced cranial base synostosis only emerges at E9.5 or E10.5 exposure [44], it is reasonable to speculate that a unique molecular event mediated by Hh signaling occurred in the cranial base region during this period. By E10.5, we detected that Ihh was expressed in the central ventral epithelium of neural tube and the skull vascular. Due to the requirement of Ihh for vasculogenesis [24, 64], it is not surprising to detect the expression of Ihh protein in the vasculature. However, whether the location of Ihh in the ventral epithelium of midline neural tube is a demonstration of the nonspecific binding of antibodies or a unique role of Ihh for this area is still obscure. Similar to earlier studies that Ihh transcripts were not found in skull base until E12 [21, 65], the Ihh expression in the cranial base is undetectable at E10.5 in the present experiments. Many studies have revealed that Desert hedgehog (Dhh) expression is mainly restricted to the male reproductive tract and that most Dhh−null mice do not present a mutant phenotype in most tissues [66–68]. Thus, the effect of Dhh on cranial base development appears to be negligible. Previous studies exhibit that the cranial base is refractory to Shh signaling until E11.5, and Bmp and Wnt also do not antagonize Shh in the early development of cranial base [69]. Our experiments provide different insights. Combining the cranial base synostosis induced by administration of Vimodegib at E9.5 or E10.5 [44] with the expression of Gli1, Ptch1, and Shh in the presumptive cranial base at E10.5 demonstrate that Shh signaling is activated prior to the condensation of skull base progenitors, which is consistent with the requirement of Shh for early cartilage specification [19, 25, 36, 69], as the loose mesenchymal cells in the cranial base at E10.5 already possess a chondrogenic fate as denoted by vigorous expression of Sox9. Therefore, Shh triggers the expression of Ptch1 in the cranial base region at E10.5.We did not detect p−Smad1/5/8 signals in the early cranial base, and the specificity of the antibody we used is proven by the positive location in the aboral side of the first branchial arch at E10.5 [35]. Numerous studies have confirmed the multiple vital effects of the canonical smad pathways of Bmp in endochondral bone formation [60, 70], but little attention has been paid to its role in early morphogenesis of cranial base, which remains elusive, although expression of Bmp2 and Bmp4 has been slightly detected in cranial base area at E10−E11 [71]. Our results demonstrated that p−Smad2 and p−Smad3 (sFigure 9 A, B) were already activated at the cranial base at E10.5, predicting a potential role for Tgf−β signaling in early skull base development, as Tgf−β signaling has been implicated in mesenchymal cell condensation and bone development [72]. However, the specific role of Tgf−β signaling in skull base development needs to be explored in further studies.The diverse and redundant functions of Wnt ligands make it difficult to study the role of Wnt signaling in cranial base development by directly targeting ligands; however, this can be achieved through genetic manipulation of β−catenin, a key effector of the Wnt pathway [18]. Knockout of β−catenin in the cranial neural crest give rise to deficiency of anterior cranial base [59], which may be caused by apoptosis of crest cells, as β−catenin ablation does not induce chondrogenesis failure of mesoderm [73–75]. Thus the activation of β−catenin that we detected in the cranial base area at E10.5 most likely indicates effects of Wnt on proliferation and/or survival of the postmigration cells of the cranial neural crest and mesoderm.The Fgfr pathway regulates the development of endochondral ossification has been confirmed by many studies [11–14]. However, cartilage abnormalities resulting from ablation or overexpression of Fgfr usually manifest after birth [11–14]. Therefore we believe it is not essential for early development of cranial base in embryonic stage.Role of perichondrium cells for normal differentiation of cranial base synchondrosisWnt signaling plays various roles in multiple steps of endochondral bone formation [59, 73–79], and Lef1 is a target of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts [73]. Deletion of β−catenin in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells delayed chondrocyte maturation and blocked osteoblast differentiation, and resulted in ectopic cartilage formation [73–76, 79]. In contrast, overexpression of β−catenin prevents mesenchymal cells from accepting the chondrogenesis fate [78]. These studies demonstrate that Wnt inhibits the differentiation of progenitor cells to chondrocytes. Consistent with this, the cranial base chondroprogenitors of the control mice had relatively lower levels of β−catenin expression in E10.5−E12.5. The precursor cells of skull base at E12.5 were undergoing rapid chondrogenic differentiation, as denoted by the expression of Sox9 and Col II, whereas the negative expression of Sox9 and Runx2 of ventral and dorsal mesenchymal cells in the cranial base implying that they do not have a chondrogenic fate. These cells may eventually participate in the perichondrium of the cranial base.Importantly, the upregulated expression of β−catenin and aberrant expression of Lef1 in ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base were detected in Vismodegib−exposed mice at E12.5, those cells also aberrantly expressed Runx2, but the Sox9 expression was negative. Runx2 is expressed in osteochondroprogenitors at E11−E13 [52, 53] and is mainly located in osteoblasts, pre−hypertrophic, and hypertrophic chondrocytes after E14.5 [52, 53, 80], while Sox9 is a specific marker for chondrogenic cells [81], suggesting those cells that are Runx2−positive and Sox9−negative are not chondrogenic cells per se, but have a potential osteoblastic fate. Therefore, after Hh signaling is interrupted by Vismodegib, ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base received enhanced Wnt signaling, which may lead to prematurely acquired osteoblast lineage, labeled by Runx2−positive and Lef1−expressing. It is common sense that if the ventral perichondrium cells of Vismodegib−exposed embryos are the trigger for premature closure of skull base synchondrosis, the premature hypertrophic differentiation and osteogenesis should follow a ventral−dorsal sequence. Supporting the above hypothesis, such a tendency of sequence was detected in intersphenoidal synchondrosis (data not shown).In agreement with these apparent changes at E12.5, a few cells that ectopic expression of Lef1 in the ventral perichondrium of the skull base cartilage was detected in Vismodegib−treated mice at E13.5, but the expression pattern of Runx2 was essentially the same as in controls, and no abnormal activation of Lef1 was seen at E14.5 and E15.5. This is easily associated with the fact that the upregulated Wnt signaling, after the transient inhibition of Hh by Vismodegib has disappeared, also normalizes after E12.5, since the inhibition of Hh signaling by a single dose of 150 mg/kg Vismodegib at E10.5 was absent by E12.5. The central point of interest is whether transient upregulation of Wnt signaling and ectopic expression of Runx2 in ventral cells of cranial base causes subsequent premature terminal differentiation and osteogenesis of synchondrosis, and why they did not exhibit cranial base synostosis until after E14.5. Overexpression of Runx2 using the type II collagen promoter has been displayed acceleration of endochondral ossification due to precocious chondrocyte maturation [82, 83]. Curiously, forced expression of Lef1 in chondrocytes appears to produce opposite phenotypes in the limb and skull base: blocking chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral ossification in the limb [78], and precocious chondrocyte hypertrophy in the cranial base cartilage [18]. Nevertheless, no current studies have forced the expression of Runx2 or Lef1 in the perichondrium, probably because there is no specific marker for such cells. As the skull base cartilage is not yet formed in E12.5, identifying and isolating presumptive perichondrium cells for the cellular experiment is quite difficult, and in vitro culture studies of the early cranial base are precluded because culturing the skull base before E14.5 leads to abnormal cartilage proliferation [15].In summary, our study proposes that the normality of ventral perichondrium cells of the skull base is essential for the appropriate rate of differentiation of the cranial base synchondrosis. Future research is needed to develop transgenic mice to manipulate the Hh or Wnt pathway specifically in the perichondrium to further investigate this hypothesis.Antagonistic effect of Shh on Wnt in cranial base morphogenesisAnother interesting question is the reason for the enhanced Wnt that occurs in the ventral cranial base. Shh or Smo deletion mice have demonstrated the deficiency of skull base [21, 22, 25]. However, the cranial base cartilage in Vismodegib−exposed embryos can form and continue to develop, because the interruption of Hh signaling by 150 mg/kg Vismodegib was not absolute, as shown by the decreased but not absent expression of Ptch1 and Gli1. In addition, an evident reduction in condensed mesenchymal cells of cranial base and skull base perforation after significant inhibition of Hh by Vismodegib exposure [44] is consistent with the reports of the specification of cranial base cartilage and the promotion of survival and proliferation of cranial base progenitors by Shh [19, 21, 22, 25, 39]. Therefore, given that Shh is the only Hh ligand present in the cranial base area during the window of Hh inhibition (E10.5−E12.5), we reasonably attributed the cranial base synostosis to the significant inhibition, but not ablation, of Shh signaling by Vismodegib administration. Several studies have revealed that Shh is expressed in the notochord, floor plate, and dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium at E10.5 [21, 22, 25, 65], all of which are vicinity to the developing cranial base. Mice treated to Vismodegib displayed a precocious fusion of synchondroses in anterior and posterior cranial base (i.e., ISS, SOS, and IOS) and aberrant enhancement of Wnt signaling in ventral cranial base; thus, the dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium, immediately adjacent to the full length of the ventral skull base, has raised our concern. Our experiments also detected the location of Shh in the dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium. The antagonism of Shh and Wnt underlies the normal development of many tissues and organs [84–86]. Therefore, the present study suggests that a similar antagonistic effect of Shh on Wnt may also exist in the early morphogenesis of the cranial base. Shh signaling emitted from the dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium acts on precursor cells of cranial base and presumptive perichondrium cells to promote the survival and/or proliferation of these postmigration progenitors, while antagonizing Wnt signaling in the ventral region of cranial base anlage to standardized the development rate of cranial base synchondrosis in the subsequent developmental stages. Moreover, the effect of Shh is dose−dependent. As the degree of Shh interruption increases, the severity of skull base synostosis also rises, and cranial base cartilage eventually fails to form due to apoptosis of progenitors or failure of cartilage specification, when Shh or Smo is completely blocked [19, 21, 22, 25, 39].

Premature ossification of the cranial base synchondroses, which are considered to be important sites for growth of the cranial base and midface growth, may result in facial deformities [1, 9, 10]. Patients with these malformations may undergo complex lifelong surgery [57]. Therefore, exploring the etiology of premature closure of the cranial base may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of such disorders. Despite a number of studies have been conducted on late embryonic and postnatal skull base development [12, 13, 29, 58], current knowledge of early development of cranial base and the molecular mechanisms involved remains largely unexplored.

Activation of signaling in early cranial base morphogenesisGiven that vismodegib−induced cranial base synostosis only emerges at E9.5 or E10.5 exposure [44], it is reasonable to speculate that a unique molecular event mediated by Hh signaling occurred in the cranial base region during this period.

Therefore, Shh triggers the expression of Ptch1 in the cranial base region at E10.5.We did not detect p−Smad1/5/8 signals in the early cranial base, and the specificity of the antibody we used is proven by the positive location in the aboral side of the first branchial arch at E10.5 [35]. Numerous studies have confirmed the multiple vital effects of the canonical smad pathways of Bmp in endochondral bone formation [60, 70], but little attention has been paid to its role in early morphogenesis of cranial base, which remains elusive, although expression of Bmp2 and Bmp4 has been slightly detected in cranial base area at E10−E11 [71]. Our results demonstrated that p−Smad2 and p−Smad3 (sFigure 9 A, B) were already activated at the cranial base at E10.5, predicting a potential role for Tgf−β signaling in early skull base development, as Tgf−β signaling has been implicated in mesenchymal cell condensation and bone development [72]. However, the specific role of Tgf−β signaling in skull base development needs to be explored in further studies.The diverse and redundant functions of Wnt ligands make it difficult to study the role of Wnt signaling in cranial base development by directly targeting ligands; however, this can be achieved through genetic manipulation of β−catenin, a key effector of the Wnt pathway [18]. Knockout of β−catenin in the cranial neural crest give rise to deficiency of anterior cranial base [59], which may be caused by apoptosis of crest cells, as β−catenin ablation does not induce chondrogenesis failure of mesoderm [73–75]. Thus the activation of β−catenin that we detected in the cranial base area at E10.5 most likely indicates effects of Wnt on proliferation and/or survival of the postmigration cells of the cranial neural crest and mesoderm.The Fgfr pathway regulates the development of endochondral ossification has been confirmed by many studies [11–14]. However, cartilage abnormalities resulting from ablation or overexpression of Fgfr usually manifest after birth [11–14]. Therefore we believe it is not essential for early development of cranial base in embryonic stage.

Activation of signaling in early cranial base morphogenesis

Given that vismodegib−induced cranial base synostosis only emerges at E9.5 or E10.5 exposure [44], it is reasonable to speculate that a unique molecular event mediated by Hh signaling occurred in the cranial base region during this period. By E10.5, we detected that Ihh was expressed in the central ventral epithelium of neural tube and the skull vascular. Due to the requirement of Ihh for vasculogenesis [24, 64], it is not surprising to detect the expression of Ihh protein in the vasculature. However, whether the location of Ihh in the ventral epithelium of midline neural tube is a demonstration of the nonspecific binding of antibodies or a unique role of Ihh for this area is still obscure. Similar to earlier studies that Ihh transcripts were not found in skull base until E12 [21, 65], the Ihh expression in the cranial base is undetectable at E10.5 in the present experiments. Many studies have revealed that Desert hedgehog (Dhh) expression is mainly restricted to the male reproductive tract and that most Dhh−null mice do not present a mutant phenotype in most tissues [66–68]. Thus, the effect of Dhh on cranial base development appears to be negligible. Previous studies exhibit that the cranial base is refractory to Shh signaling until E11.5, and Bmp and Wnt also do not antagonize Shh in the early development of cranial base [69]. Our experiments provide different insights. Combining the cranial base synostosis induced by administration of Vimodegib at E9.5 or E10.5 [44] with the expression of Gli1, Ptch1, and Shh in the presumptive cranial base at E10.5 demonstrate that Shh signaling is activated prior to the condensation of skull base progenitors, which is consistent with the requirement of Shh for early cartilage specification [19, 25, 36, 69], as the loose mesenchymal cells in the cranial base at E10.5 already possess a chondrogenic fate as denoted by vigorous expression of Sox9. Therefore, Shh triggers the expression of Ptch1 in the cranial base region at E10.5.

We did not detect p−Smad1/5/8 signals in the early cranial base, and the specificity of the antibody we used is proven by the positive location in the aboral side of the first branchial arch at E10.5 [35]. Numerous studies have confirmed the multiple vital effects of the canonical smad pathways of Bmp in endochondral bone formation [60, 70], but little attention has been paid to its role in early morphogenesis of cranial base, which remains elusive, although expression of Bmp2 and Bmp4 has been slightly detected in cranial base area at E10−E11 [71]. Our results demonstrated that p−Smad2 and p−Smad3 (sFigure 9 A, B) were already activated at the cranial base at E10.5, predicting a potential role for Tgf−β signaling in early skull base development, as Tgf−β signaling has been implicated in mesenchymal cell condensation and bone development [72]. However, the specific role of Tgf−β signaling in skull base development needs to be explored in further studies.

The diverse and redundant functions of Wnt ligands make it difficult to study the role of Wnt signaling in cranial base development by directly targeting ligands; however, this can be achieved through genetic manipulation of β−catenin, a key effector of the Wnt pathway [18]. Knockout of β−catenin in the cranial neural crest give rise to deficiency of anterior cranial base [59], which may be caused by apoptosis of crest cells, as β−catenin ablation does not induce chondrogenesis failure of mesoderm [73–75]. Thus the activation of β−catenin that we detected in the cranial base area at E10.5 most likely indicates effects of Wnt on proliferation and/or survival of the postmigration cells of the cranial neural crest and mesoderm.

The Fgfr pathway regulates the development of endochondral ossification has been confirmed by many studies [11–14]. However, cartilage abnormalities resulting from ablation or overexpression of Fgfr usually manifest after birth [11–14]. Therefore we believe it is not essential for early development of cranial base in embryonic stage.

Role of perichondrium cells for normal differentiation of cranial base synchondrosisWnt signaling plays various roles in multiple steps of endochondral bone formation [59, 73–79], and Lef1 is a target of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts [73]. Deletion of β−catenin in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells delayed chondrocyte maturation and blocked osteoblast differentiation, and resulted in ectopic cartilage formation [73–76, 79]. In contrast, overexpression of β−catenin prevents mesenchymal cells from accepting the chondrogenesis fate [78]. These studies demonstrate that Wnt inhibits the differentiation of progenitor cells to chondrocytes. Consistent with this, the cranial base chondroprogenitors of the control mice had relatively lower levels of β−catenin expression in E10.5−E12.5. The precursor cells of skull base at E12.5 were undergoing rapid chondrogenic differentiation, as denoted by the expression of Sox9 and Col II, whereas the negative expression of Sox9 and Runx2 of ventral and dorsal mesenchymal cells in the cranial base implying that they do not have a chondrogenic fate. These cells may eventually participate in the perichondrium of the cranial base.Importantly, the upregulated expression of β−catenin and aberrant expression of Lef1 in ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base were detected in Vismodegib−exposed mice at E12.5, those cells also aberrantly expressed Runx2, but the Sox9 expression was negative. Runx2 is expressed in osteochondroprogenitors at E11−E13 [52, 53] and is mainly located in osteoblasts, pre−hypertrophic, and hypertrophic chondrocytes after E14.5 [52, 53, 80], while Sox9 is a specific marker for chondrogenic cells [81], suggesting those cells that are Runx2−positive and Sox9−negative are not chondrogenic cells per se, but have a potential osteoblastic fate. Therefore, after Hh signaling is interrupted by Vismodegib, ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base received enhanced Wnt signaling, which may lead to prematurely acquired osteoblast lineage, labeled by Runx2−positive and Lef1−expressing. It is common sense that if the ventral perichondrium cells of Vismodegib−exposed embryos are the trigger for premature closure of skull base synchondrosis, the premature hypertrophic differentiation and osteogenesis should follow a ventral−dorsal sequence. Supporting the above hypothesis, such a tendency of sequence was detected in intersphenoidal synchondrosis (data not shown).In agreement with these apparent changes at E12.5, a few cells that ectopic expression of Lef1 in the ventral perichondrium of the skull base cartilage was detected in Vismodegib−treated mice at E13.5, but the expression pattern of Runx2 was essentially the same as in controls, and no abnormal activation of Lef1 was seen at E14.5 and E15.5. This is easily associated with the fact that the upregulated Wnt signaling, after the transient inhibition of Hh by Vismodegib has disappeared, also normalizes after E12.5, since the inhibition of Hh signaling by a single dose of 150 mg/kg Vismodegib at E10.5 was absent by E12.5. The central point of interest is whether transient upregulation of Wnt signaling and ectopic expression of Runx2 in ventral cells of cranial base causes subsequent premature terminal differentiation and osteogenesis of synchondrosis, and why they did not exhibit cranial base synostosis until after E14.5. Overexpression of Runx2 using the type II collagen promoter has been displayed acceleration of endochondral ossification due to precocious chondrocyte maturation [82, 83]. Curiously, forced expression of Lef1 in chondrocytes appears to produce opposite phenotypes in the limb and skull base: blocking chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral ossification in the limb [78], and precocious chondrocyte hypertrophy in the cranial base cartilage [18]. Nevertheless, no current studies have forced the expression of Runx2 or Lef1 in the perichondrium, probably because there is no specific marker for such cells. As the skull base cartilage is not yet formed in E12.5, identifying and isolating presumptive perichondrium cells for the cellular experiment is quite difficult, and in vitro culture studies of the early cranial base are precluded because culturing the skull base before E14.5 leads to abnormal cartilage proliferation [15].In summary, our study proposes that the normality of ventral perichondrium cells of the skull base is essential for the appropriate rate of differentiation of the cranial base synchondrosis. Future research is needed to develop transgenic mice to manipulate the Hh or Wnt pathway specifically in the perichondrium to further investigate this hypothesis.

Role of perichondrium cells for normal differentiation of cranial base synchondrosis

Wnt signaling plays various roles in multiple steps of endochondral bone formation [59, 73–79], and Lef1 is a target of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts [73]. Deletion of β−catenin in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells delayed chondrocyte maturation and blocked osteoblast differentiation, and resulted in ectopic cartilage formation [73–76, 79].

These studies demonstrate that Wnt inhibits the differentiation of progenitor cells to chondrocytes.

These cells may eventually participate in the perichondrium of the cranial base.

Importantly, the upregulated expression of β−catenin and aberrant expression of Lef1 in ventral mesenchymal cells of the cranial base were detected in Vismodegib−exposed mice at E12.5, those cells also aberrantly expressed Runx2, but the Sox9 expression was negative. Runx2 is expressed in osteochondroprogenitors at E11−E13 [52, 53] and is mainly located in osteoblasts, pre−hypertrophic, and hypertrophic chondrocytes after E14.5 [52, 53, 80], while Sox9 is a specific marker for chondrogenic cells [81], suggesting those cells that are Runx2−positive and Sox9−negative are not chondrogenic cells per se, but have a potential osteoblastic fate.

In summary, our study proposes that the normality of ventral perichondrium cells of the skull base is essential for the appropriate rate of differentiation of the cranial base synchondrosis. Future research is needed to develop transgenic mice to manipulate the Hh or Wnt pathway specifically in the perichondrium to further investigate this hypothesis.

Antagonistic effect of Shh on Wnt in cranial base morphogenesisAnother interesting question is the reason for the enhanced Wnt that occurs in the ventral cranial base. Shh or Smo deletion mice have demonstrated the deficiency of skull base [21, 22, 25]. However, the cranial base cartilage in Vismodegib−exposed embryos can form and continue to develop, because the interruption of Hh signaling by 150 mg/kg Vismodegib was not absolute, as shown by the decreased but not absent expression of Ptch1 and Gli1. In addition, an evident reduction in condensed mesenchymal cells of cranial base and skull base perforation after significant inhibition of Hh by Vismodegib exposure [44] is consistent with the reports of the specification of cranial base cartilage and the promotion of survival and proliferation of cranial base progenitors by Shh [19, 21, 22, 25, 39]. Therefore, given that Shh is the only Hh ligand present in the cranial base area during the window of Hh inhibition (E10.5−E12.5), we reasonably attributed the cranial base synostosis to the significant inhibition, but not ablation, of Shh signaling by Vismodegib administration. Several studies have revealed that Shh is expressed in the notochord, floor plate, and dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium at E10.5 [21, 22, 25, 65], all of which are vicinity to the developing cranial base. Mice treated to Vismodegib displayed a precocious fusion of synchondroses in anterior and posterior cranial base (i.e., ISS, SOS, and IOS) and aberrant enhancement of Wnt signaling in ventral cranial base; thus, the dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium, immediately adjacent to the full length of the ventral skull base, has raised our concern. Our experiments also detected the location of Shh in the dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium. The antagonism of Shh and Wnt underlies the normal development of many tissues and organs [84–86]. Therefore, the present study suggests that a similar antagonistic effect of Shh on Wnt may also exist in the early morphogenesis of the cranial base. Shh signaling emitted from the dorsal oropharyngeal epithelium acts on precursor cells of cranial base and presumptive perichondrium cells to promote the survival and/or proliferation of these postmigration progenitors, while antagonizing Wnt signaling in the ventral region of cranial base anlage to standardized the development rate of cranial base synchondrosis in the subsequent developmental stages. Moreover, the effect of Shh is dose−dependent. As the degree of Shh interruption increases, the severity of skull base synostosis also rises, and cranial base cartilage eventually fails to form due to apoptosis of progenitors or failure of cartilage specification, when Shh or Smo is completely blocked [19, 21, 22, 25, 39].

ConclusionsIn conclusion, the present study has developed the first mouse model of premature closure of the cranial base synchondrosis associated with transient partial disruption of the Shh pathway. Following Vismodegib administration at E10.5, skull base synchondrosis accelerated differentiation and osteogenesis after E14.5, culminating in synostosis at E17.5. In contrast to Ihh null studies, the acceleration of hypertrophic differentiation of synchondroses was not secondary to disruption of the Ihh-PTHrP pathway or a reduction in chondrocyte proliferation, but instead may be related to upregulation of Wnt signaling at the cranial base after transient disruption of Shh signaling and to ectopic expression of Lef1 and Runx2 in the ventral mesenchymal cells of the skull base primordium. Our investigation suggests that antagonism of the Wnt pathway by Shh signaling at an early stage (before the aggregation of cranial base mesenchymal cells) ensures normal embryonic development of the skull base at a later stage (after the formation of cranial base cartilage). We have identified for the first time such a regulatory effect of Shh on cranial base development and there may be a potential gradient effect.

MethodsAnimalsThis study conformed to the Arrive Guidelline, and all animal experiments was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fujian Medical University and was in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (No. FJMU IACUC 2022–0824). ICR mice were nurtured in ventilated cages with specific pathogen−free conditions. Two female mice were housed with one male overnight. Noon on the day that presence of a copulation plug was considered embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).Vismodegib administrationFour hundred microliters Vismodegib (Selleckchem, Houston, Texas) was suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose (Aladdin, Shanghai) and 0.2% Tween (Shenggong, Shanghai). A single dose of Vismodegib (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, or 200 mg/kg) was administered by intragastric intubation to E10.5 pregnant mice. Mice exposed to 150 mg/kg Vismodegib were used for the main experimental procedure. The control mice were treated with an equivalent volume of Vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose with 0.2% Tween) at E10.5. Embryos were collected at E10.5−E17.5 and decapitated for the next procedure.Micro−computed tomographyE17.5 skulls with mandible removed that had been exposed to Vehicle or Vismodegib (150 mg/kg) at E10.5 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4℃ and then placed to 70% alcohols. The samples were scanned on a micro−computed tomography (micro−CT) system (SCANCO Medical AG: µCT100, Hangzhou Yue Bo Biotechnology Co., Ltd) and then reconstructed three−dimensional images. Two−dimensional slice images were processed by Horos (GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 3) to reduce noise and increase contrast for better visibility.Skeletal preparationSkulls were fixed in 100% ethanol for 3 days and samples with skin removed were stained overnight in an Alcian blue staining solution (4 volumes glacial acetic acid, 5 volumes 100% ethanol and 1 volume 1% Alcian blue/3% acetic acid [Sigma]) at 37℃ for dyeing of cartilage elements. Then they were rinsed in 100% ethanol for 1 day and subsequently transferred to 0.5% potassium hydroxide (KOH) overnight. Bone staining was performed by macerating the specimens in Alizarin red staining solution (1% KOH with 80 μg/mL Alizarin red−S [Sigma]) for 4 to 7 h. For E13.5 samples, no bone staining was conducted. The skulls were then placed in 1% KOH until probably cleared. Finally, the samples were stored at 4℃ in 1:1 glycerol in 1% KOH. Specimens were photographed in a light field.Histology and immunohistochemistryEmbryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4℃. E17.5 skulls were decalcified in 20% EDTA for 24 h at 37℃. Then the samples were dehydrated through graded ethanol and embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned at a thickness of 4 mm. The sections were subjected to hematoxylineosin (HE) or Trap staining. For immunofluorescence, paraffin sections were processed for antigen retrieval and then blocking 30 min with goat serum, followed by incubation overnight with primary antibody (Col X, 1:300, Abcam, ab260040; Col II, 1:200, Abcam, ab34712; Col I, 1:200, Abcam, ab138492; Ptch1, 1:100, Abcam, ab53715; Shh, 1:150, Abcam, ab53281; Ihh, 1:200, Abcam, ab52919; PTHrP, 1:200, ThermoFisher, PA5−102455; Runx2, 1:250, Abcam, ab192256; Osterix, 1:250, Abcam, ab22552; Lef1, 1:200, Abcam, ab137872; Sox9, 1:250, Abcam, ab185966; β−catenin (1:100, OriGene Technologies, TA375200); p−Smad3,1:100, HuaBio, ST0493; p−Smad2, 1:100, HuaBio, PSH05−76) at 4℃. The next day of incubation, after rewarming for 30 min, sections were washed in phosphate−buffered saline (PBS) 3 times for 5 min each and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 (1:250, Abcam, ab150080) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti−rabbit secondary antibodies (1:250, Abcam, ab150077) for 1 h at 37℃. Nuclear counterstaining was performed by staining with DAPI solution under light−proof conditions for 5 min at room temperature. For immunohistochemistry, for blocking endogenous peroxidase activity, the specimens were immersed in 3% H2O2 for 15 min at 37℃ after antigen retrieval. The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti−CD31 (1:300, Abcam, ab28364); p−Smad1/5/8 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, 13820 T); Osteocalcin (1:200, Wanleibio, WLH4378); Phh3 (1:1000, Abcam, ab47297); Col I (1:1000, Abcam, ab138492). The secondary antibody was peroxidase−conjugated streptavidin goat anti−rabbit IgG (MXB−Bio, KIT−9720). The staining was incubated with diaminobenzidine. Nuclear counterstaining was conducted with hematoxylin.RNAScope stainingGli1 and Ctnnb1 (β-catenin) expression of Vehicle- and Vismodegib-exposed mice at E11.5, E12.5, E14.5, and E15.5 were examined. All samples were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Then the samples were dehydrated through graded ethanol at 4℃ and embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned at a thickness of 4 mm. Fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents V2 (ACD, 323,110), Gli1 (ACD, 311,001), and Ctnnb1 (ACD, 311,741-C3) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Imaging was performed using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with 40_/1.3NA lens.Statistical analysisData were obtained from sections of 2–3 embryos from each treatment group for each marker gene in this experiment, and at least three replicates of each experiment were performed. For the quantitative analysis of Ptch1, Phh3, PTHrP, Runx2, and Lef1 expression of the cranial base, the section images of the Vehicle− and Vismodegib−exposed mice taken under the same exposure conditions were imported into ImageJ 2.0.0, the same regions of the cranial base below the pituitary gland were selected to measure the average fluorescence intensity of Ptch1 and PTHrP, and the cell positivity rate of Phh3, Runx2, and Lef1. For the quantification of immunohistochemical analysis for β−catenin signaling, 2–3 zones in the presumptive cranial base or the ventral mesenchymal cell of the cranial base cartilage of each image were randomly selected, and the cell positivity rate for nuclear localization of β−catenin was performed. For the quantitative analysis of RNAscope for Gli1 and β−catenin signaling of the cranial base, 2–3 equal zones of each RNAscope image were randomly selected in the cranial base cartilage or its ventral mesenchymal cell in the cranial base region below the pituitary gland, and the analysis of Gli1 and β−catenin signaling was performed according to a semi−quantitative ACD scoring system for RNAscope assays [87]. The obtained data were performed statistical analysis by GraphPad Prism 8.0.0 software. After normal distribution test, Student’s t test was used if the normal distribution was satisfied and the variances were flush; when the normal distribution was satisfied but the variances were not flush, Welch’s method corrected independent sample t−test was used; if the normal distribution was not satisfied, a Mann–Whitney test (rank−sum test) was used. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Two−dimensional slice images were processed by Horos (GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 3) to reduce noise and increase contrast for better visibility.

Skeletal preparationSkulls were fixed in 100% ethanol for 3 days and samples with skin removed were stained overnight in an Alcian blue staining solution (4 volumes glacial acetic acid, 5 volumes 100% ethanol and 1 volume 1% Alcian blue/3% acetic acid [Sigma]) at 37℃ for dyeing of cartilage elements. Then they were rinsed in 100% ethanol for 1 day and subsequently transferred to 0.5% potassium hydroxide (KOH) overnight. Bone staining was performed by macerating the specimens in Alizarin red staining solution (1% KOH with 80 μg/mL Alizarin red−S [Sigma]) for 4 to 7 h. For E13.5 samples, no bone staining was conducted. The skulls were then placed in 1% KOH until probably cleared. Finally, the samples were stored at 4℃ in 1:1 glycerol in 1% KOH. Specimens were photographed in a light field.

Statistical analysisData were obtained from sections of 2–3 embryos from each treatment group for each marker gene in this experiment, and at least three replicates of each experiment were performed. For the quantitative analysis of Ptch1, Phh3, PTHrP, Runx2, and Lef1 expression of the cranial base, the section images of the Vehicle− and Vismodegib−exposed mice taken under the same exposure conditions were imported into ImageJ 2.0.0, the same regions of the cranial base below the pituitary gland were selected to measure the average fluorescence intensity of Ptch1 and PTHrP, and the cell positivity rate of Phh3, Runx2, and Lef1. For the quantification of immunohistochemical analysis for β−catenin signaling, 2–3 zones in the presumptive cranial base or the ventral mesenchymal cell of the cranial base cartilage of each image were randomly selected, and the cell positivity rate for nuclear localization of β−catenin was performed. For the quantitative analysis of RNAscope for Gli1 and β−catenin signaling of the cranial base, 2–3 equal zones of each RNAscope image were randomly selected in the cranial base cartilage or its ventral mesenchymal cell in the cranial base region below the pituitary gland, and the analysis of Gli1 and β−catenin signaling was performed according to a semi−quantitative ACD scoring system for RNAscope assays [87]. The obtained data were performed statistical analysis by GraphPad Prism 8.0.0 software. After normal distribution test, Student’s t test was used if the normal distribution was satisfied and the variances were flush; when the normal distribution was satisfied but the variances were not flush, Welch’s method corrected independent sample t−test was used; if the normal distribution was not satisfied, a Mann–Whitney test (rank−sum test) was used. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
