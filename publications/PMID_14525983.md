The vertebrate homologues of Drosophila dachsund, DACH1 and DACH2, have been 
implicated as important regulatory genes in development. DACH1 plays a role in 
retinal and pituitary precursor cell proliferation and DACH2 plays a specific 
role in myogenesis. DACH proteins contain a domain (DS domain) that is conserved 
with the proto-oncogenes Ski and Sno. Since the Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes repress 
AP-1 and SMAD signaling, we hypothesized that DACH1 might play a similar 
cellular function. Herein, DACH1 was found to be expressed in breast cancer cell 
lines and to inhibit transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced 
apoptosis. DACH1 repressed TGF-beta induction of AP-1 and Smad signaling in gene 
reporter assays and repressed endogenous TGF-beta-responsive genes by microarray 
analyses. DACH1 bound to endogenous NCoR and Smad4 in cultured cells and DACH1 
co-localized with NCoR in nuclear dotlike structures. NCoR enhanced DACH1 
repression, and the repression of TGF-beta-induced AP-1 or Smad signaling by 
DACH1 required the DACH1 DS domain. The DS domain of DACH was sufficient for 
NCoR binding at a Smad4-binding site. Smad4 was required for DACH1 repression of 
Smad signaling. In Smad4 null HTB-134 cells, DACH1 inhibited the activation of 
SBE-4 reporter activity induced by Smad2 or Smad3 only in the presence of Smad4. 
DACH1 participates in the negative regulation of TGF-beta signaling by 
interacting with NCoR and Smad4.
