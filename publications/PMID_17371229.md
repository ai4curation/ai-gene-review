PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases) regulate diverse cellular functions such as 
metabolism, growth, gene expression and migration. The p110delta isoform of PI3K 
is mainly expressed in cells of the immune system and contributes to cellular 
and humoral immunity. In the thymus, p110delta and p110gamma play complementary 
roles in regulating the transition through key developmental checkpoints. In 
addition, p110delta regulates the differentiation of peripheral Th (helper 
T-cells) towards the Th1 and Th2 lineages. Moreover, p110delta is critical for 
Treg (regulatory T-cell) function. Here, we review the role of PI3Ks in T-cell 
development and function.
