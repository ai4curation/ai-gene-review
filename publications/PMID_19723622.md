Ischemic injury of the heart is associated with activation of multiple signal 
transduction systems including the heterotrimeric G-protein system. Here, we 
report a role of the ischemia-inducible regulator of G betagamma subunit, AGS8, 
in survival of cardiomyocytes under hypoxia. Cultured rat neonatal 
cardiomyocytes (NCM) were exposed to hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation following 
transfection of AGS8siRNA or pcDNA::AGS8. Hypoxia-induced apoptosis of NCM was 
completely blocked by AGS8siRNA, whereas overexpression of AGS8 increased 
apoptosis. AGS8 formed complexes with G-proteins and channel protein connexin 43 
(CX43), which regulates the permeability of small molecules under hypoxic 
stress. AGS8 initiated CX43 phosphorylation in a G betagamma-dependent manner by 
providing a scaffold composed of G betagamma and CX43. AGS8siRNA blocked 
internalization of CX43 following exposure of NCM to repetitive hypoxia; however 
it did not influence epidermal growth factor-mediated internalization of CX43. 
The decreased dye flux through CX43 that occurred with hypoxic stress was also 
prevented by AGS8siRNA. Interestingly, the G betagamma inhibitor Gallein 
mimicked the effect of AGS8 knockdown on both the CX43 internalization and the 
changes in cell permeability elicited by hypoxic stress. These data indicate 
that AGS8 is required for hypoxia-induced apoptosis of NCM, and that AGS8-G 
betagamma signal input increased the sensitivity of cells to hypoxic stress by 
influencing CX43 regulation and associated cell permeability. Under hypoxic 
stress, this unrecognized response program plays a critical role in the fate of 
NCM.
