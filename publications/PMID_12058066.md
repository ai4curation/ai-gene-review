modulated by phosphorylation with a cell cycle-dependent kinase and by 
association with its subtype.

Nucleophosmin/B23 is a nucleolar phosphoprotein. It has been shown that B23 
binds to nucleic acids, digests RNA, and is localized in nucleolar granular 
components from which preribosomal particles are transported to cytoplasm. The 
intracellular localization of B23 is significantly changed during the cell 
cycle. Here, we have examined the cellular localization of B23 proteins and the 
effect of mitotic phosphorylation of B23.1 on its RNA binding activity. Two 
splicing variants of B23 proteins, termed B23.1 and B23.2, were complexed both 
in vivo and in vitro. The RNA binding activity of B23.1 was impaired by 
hetero-oligomer formation with B23.2. Both subtypes of B23 proteins were 
phosphorylated during mitosis by cyclin B/cdc2. The RNA binding activity of 
B23.1 was repressed through cyclin B/cdc2-mediated phosphorylation at specific 
sites in B23. Thus, the RNA binding activity of B23.1 is stringently modulated 
by its phosphorylation and subtype association. Interphase B23.1 was mainly 
localized in nucleoli, whereas B23.2 and mitotic B23.1, those of which were 
incapable of binding to RNA, were dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm and 
cytoplasm, respectively. These results suggest that nucleolar localization of 
B23.1 is mediated by its ability to associate with RNA.
