One of the most complex organs in the human body is the testis, where 
spermatogenesis takes place. This physiological process involves thousands of 
genes and proteins that are activated and repressed, making testis the organ 
with the highest number of tissue-specific genes. However, the function of a 
large proportion of the corresponding proteins remains unknown and testis 
harbors many missing proteins (MPs), defined as products of protein-coding genes 
that lack experimental mass spectrometry evidence. Here, an integrated omics 
approach was used for exploring the cell type-specific protein expression of 
genes with an elevated expression in testis. By combining genome-wide 
transcriptomics analysis with immunohistochemistry, more than 500 proteins with 
distinct testicular protein expression patterns were identified, and these were 
selected for in-depth characterization of their in situ expression in eight 
different testicular cell types. The cell type-specific protein expression 
patterns allowed us to identify six distinct clusters of expression at different 
stages of spermatogenesis. The analysis highlighted numerous poorly 
characterized proteins in each of these clusters whose expression overlapped 
with that of known proteins involved in spermatogenesis, including 85 proteins 
with an unknown function and 60 proteins that previously have been classified as 
MPs. Furthermore, we were able to characterize the in situ distribution of 
several proteins that previously lacked spatial information and cell 
type-specific expression within the testis. The testis elevated expression 
levels both at the RNA and protein levels suggest that these proteins are 
related to testis-specific functions. In summary, the study demonstrates the 
power of combining genome-wide transcriptomics analysis with antibody-based 
protein profiling to explore the cell type-specific expression of both 
well-known proteins and MPs. The analyzed proteins constitute important targets 
for further testis-specific research in male reproductive disorders.
