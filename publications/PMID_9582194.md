We mapped 75 genes that collectively encode >90% of the proteins found in human 
ribosomes. Because localization of ribosomal protein genes (rp genes) is 
complicated by the existence of processed pseudogenes, multiple strategies were 
devised to identify PCR-detectable sequence-tagged sites (STSs) at introns. In 
some cases we exploited specific, pre-existing information about the intron/exon 
structure of a given human rp gene or its homolog in another vertebrate. When 
such information was unavailable, selection of PCR primer pairs was guided by 
general insights gleaned from analysis of all mammalian rp genes whose 
intron/exon structures have been published. For many genes, PCR amplification of 
introns was facilitated by use of YAC pool DNAs rather than total human genomic 
DNA as templates. We then assigned the rp gene STSs to individual human 
chromosomes by typing human-rodent hybrid cell lines. The genes were placed more 
precisely on the physical map of the human genome by typing of radiation hybrids 
or screening YAC libraries. Fifty-one previously unmapped rp genes were 
localized, and 24 previously reported rp gene localizations were confirmed, 
refined, or corrected. Though functionally related and coordinately expressed, 
the 75 mapped genes are widely dispersed: Both sex chromosomes and at least 20 
of the 22 autosomes carry one or more rp genes. Chromosome 19, known to have a 
high gene density, contains an unusually large number of rp genes (12). This map 
provides a foundation for the study of the possible roles of ribosomal protein 
deficiencies in chromosomal and Mendelian disorders.
