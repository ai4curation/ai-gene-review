The F-box protein Skp2 and its isoform Skp2B are both overexpressed in breast 
cancers. Skp2 alters the activity of p53 by inhibiting its interaction with p300 
and by promoting p300 degradation. Here, we report that Skp2B also attenuates 
the activity of p53; however, this effect is independent of p300, suggesting 
that another mechanism might be involved. Prohibitin, a protein reported to 
activate p53, was isolated in a two-hybrid screen with the carboxy-terminal 
domain unique to Skp2B. We observed that prohibitin is a new substrate of Skp2B 
and that the degradation of prohibitin is responsible for the attenuated 
activity of p53 in cells overexpressing Skp2B. Furthermore, we show that the 
activity of p53 is reduced in the mammary glands of Skp2B transgenic mice. This 
study indicates that both Skp2 and Skp2B attenuate p53 activity through 
different pathways, suggesting that amplification of the Skp2 locus represents a 
powerful mechanism to attenuate p53 function in cancer.

Abstract

The F-box protein Skp2 and its isoform Skp2B are both overexpressed in breast cancers. Skp2 alters the activity of p53 by inhibiting its interaction with p300 and by promoting p300 degradation. Here, we report that Skp2B also attenuates the activity of p53; however, this effect is independent of p300, suggesting that another mechanism might be involved. Prohibitin, a protein reported to activate p53, was isolated in a two-hybrid screen with the carboxy-terminal domain unique to Skp2B. We observed that prohibitin is a new substrate of Skp2B and that the degradation of prohibitin is responsible for the attenuated activity of p53 in cells overexpressing Skp2B. Furthermore, we show that the activity of p53 is reduced in the mammary glands of Skp2B transgenic mice. This study indicates that both Skp2 and Skp2B attenuate p53 activity through different pathways, suggesting that amplification of the Skp2 locus represents a powerful mechanism to attenuate p53 function in cancer.

Introduction

F-box proteins function as the substrate recognition subunits of specific ubiquitin ligase complexes. Skp2 is one of the best-characterized F-box proteins and has been implicated in the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Skp2 was recently shown to attenuate p53 function by affecting the activity and level of the acetyltransferase enzyme p300 ( Kitagawa et al , 2008 ). Skp2B is an isoform of Skp2 that differs at the carboxy-terminal domain and is important for substrate recognition. As a result, Skp2B does not show a significant effect on Skp2 substrates ( Radke et al , 2005 ). Both Skp2 and Skp2B are overexpressed in breast cancer.

To determine whether Skp2B does have a role in breast cancer, we established transgenic mice overexpressing Skp2B in the mammary gland under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter ( Umanskaya et al , 2007 ). We found that MMTV - Skp2B mice develop several phenotypes including mammary tumours ( Umanskaya et al , 2007 ), but the substrate of Skp2B involved in its oncogenic effect remained unidentified. Here, we report that prohibitin, a protein reported to activate p53, is targeted for degradation upon Skp2B overexpression and that as a result, the activity of p53 is attenuated both in vitro and in vivo .

Discussion

Our data indicate that the overexpression of Skp2B promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of prohibitin and as a consequence results in an attenuated transcriptional activity of p53 both in vitro and in vivo . However, we cannot rule out that other, yet to be identified, substrates of Skp2B might also contribute to the attenuation of p53 activity. Skp2 overexpression also promotes the attenuation of p53 function by affecting p300 levels and activity ( Kitagawa et al , 2008 ). We previously observed that in most cases, Skp2 and Skp2B are amplified in primary breast cancers ( Radke et al , 2005 ). The model of the combined effect of Skp2 and Skp2B is presented in Fig 4D . These observations raise the possibility that even in absence of p53 mutations or mdm2 amplification, the activity of p53 might be attenuated owing to the amplification of the Skp2 locus. Furthermore, as Skp2 promotes the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 ( Carrano et al , 1999 )—and although we found that Skp2B promotes the activity of the oestrogen receptor ( Umanskaya et al , 2007 )—the combined effect of Skp2 and Skp2B is predicted to be the acceleration of cellular proliferation in the context of an attenuated p53 checkpoint, and might indicate the worst prognosis associated with Skp2/2B overexpression. ( Kitagawa et al , 2008 ). As Skp2 and Skp2B differ only at the C-terminal domain but are otherwise identical, molecules able to inhibit both isoforms are predicted to be the most promising.

Methods

Cell lines, plasmids and transfections. The MCF-7 and MCF-7-Skp2B cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All transfections were performed with the Mirus reagent (TransIT-LT-1, Mirus, Madison, WI, USA).

Transfection of siRNAs. siRNA transfections were performed by using RNAiFect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The sequences for the siRNAs inhibiting Skp2B expression were designed and used as described previously ( Umanskaya et al , 2007 ): siRNA#1, 5′-AGCCAGUUUCCUCGCAUCUTT-3′; siRNA#2, 5′-UGUCAACAUCACACUGCGCTT-3′; siRNA#3, 5′-CCCAGAAAUCACUGUGAAATT-3′.

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. These methods were performed as described previously ( Radke et al , 2005 ) with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-Prohibitin (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), mouse prohibitin (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA) for immunoprecipitation, mouse Flag (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA), mouse anti-Skp2 (Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA), mouse tubulin antibody (Sigma), mouse Myc antibody 9E10 to detect Myc-ubiquitin, and p53 DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Luciferase assay. To measure the transcriptional activity of p53, MCF-7 and MCF-7-Skp2B cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid pGL3-E1bTATA and with a plasmid constitutively expressing the Renilla luciferase. Luciferase activity was measured by using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

DMBA treatment. The carcinogen DMBA (Sigma) was dissolved in corn oil at a concentration of 10 mg per ml. The seven-week-old virgin female transgenic and wild-type mice were treated with four weekly doses of 100 μl of a 10 mg per ml solution of DMBA by gavage.
