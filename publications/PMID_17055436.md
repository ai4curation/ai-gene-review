The T cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta heterodimer communicates ligand binding to 
the cell interior via noncovalently associated CD3gammaepsilon, CD3deltaepsilon, 
and zetazeta dimers. While structures of extracellular components of the TCR-CD3 
complex are known, the transmembrane (TM) domains that mediate assembly have 
eluded structural characterization. Incorporation of the zetazeta signaling 
module is known to require one basic TCRalpha and two zetazeta aspartic acid TM 
residues. We report the NMR structure of the zetazeta(TM) dimer, a left-handed 
coiled coil with substantial polar contacts. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrate 
that three polar positions are critical for zetazeta dimerization and assembly 
with TCR. The two aspartic acids create a single structural unit at the zetazeta 
interface stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding, and there is evidence for a 
structural water molecule (or molecules) within close proximity. This structural 
unit, representing only the second transmembrane dimer interface solved to date, 
serves as a paradigm for the assembly of all modules involved in TCR signaling.

INTRODUCTION

The T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes peptide fragments presented by MHC molecules and delivers signals that control T cell development and function. The TCRαβ heterodimer communicates ligand binding events to the interior of the cell via the noncovalently associated CD3γε, CD3δε, and ζζ dimers that contain tyrosine-based phosphorylation motifs ( Samelson et al., 1985 ; Sussman et al., 1988 ; Weissman et al., 1988 ; Exley et al., 1991 ). Early studies suggested that basic and acidic residues in the trans-membrane (TM) domains of the TCR and CD3 subunits contribute to assembly ( Alcover et al., 1990 ; Blumberg et al., 1990 ; Rutledge et al., 1992 ; Dietrich et al., 1996 ), and it was proposed that these residues form pairwise interactions similar to salt bridges ( Cosson et al., 1991 ). There are three basic residues in the TM domains of the TCRαβ heterodimer and a pair of acidic residues in the TM regions of each of the three dimeric signaling modules, and we recently demonstrated that each of three assembly steps requires the formation of a three-chain interface involving a basic TCR TM residue and both acidic TM residues of the respective signaling dimer ( Call et al., 2002 ). Formation of the eight-chain TCRαβ-CD3δε-CD3γε-ζζ complex is thus dependent on proper placement of three groups of three ionizable TM residues ( Punt et al., 1994 ; Kearse et al., 1995 ; Call et al., 2002 , 2004 ).

Subsequent studies demonstrated that a diverse group of activating receptors in cells of hematopoietic origin converged on a strikingly similar assembly mechanism involving basic and acidic TM residues ( Feng et al., 2005 ; Garrity et al., 2005 ). Examples include the natural killer (NK) cell receptors KIR2DS, NKp46, and NKG2C/CD94; the FcαRI receptor for IgA; and the platelet collagen receptor GPVI ( Feng et al., 2005 ; Lanier, 2005 ). Each of these receptors assembles with a signaling module belonging to one of two major families: the ζ chain and the common Fc receptor γ subunit (Fcγ) form one family ( Samelson et al., 1985 ; Sussman et al., 1988 ; Kuster et al., 1990 ), while the DAP10 and DAP12 proteins form the second ( Tomasello et al., 1998 ; Lanier et al., 1998a ; Wu et al., 1999 ). The ζ chain and Fcγ share a high degree of sequence homology within the TM domains and have conserved cysteine and aspartic acid residues at positions 2 and 6 of the predicted TM domains, respectively. In the DAP10 and DAP12 dimers, the aspartic acid pair is located closer to the center of the TM domains, and the interchain disulfide bonds are positioned in the short ectodomains.

Surprisingly, TM peptides are sufficient for assembly of several distinct receptors with their signaling modules. For example, a TCRα TM peptide assembles with CD3δε ( Call et al., 2002 ), and TM peptides of the KIR and NKG2C receptors each form the appropriate three-chain complex with the DAP12 signaling module ( Feng et al., 2005 ). A major unresolved question concerns how the two acidic TM residues of the dimeric signaling modules create the essential functional unit for assembly of these diverse receptor complexes. Biochemical studies suggest that the two acidic TM residues act as a functional pair because mutation of aspartic acid to asparagine (N) or alanine (A) in even one strand results in profound assembly defects ( Call et al., 2002 ; Feng et al., 2005 ; Garrity et al., 2005 ). Given this striking result, a central goal is to understand how the orientation and ionization states of the two acidic side chains relate to the formation of the critical structure for receptor assembly. These findings therefore raise the following critical questions: Are the two aspartic acids within sufficient proximity to interact directly with each other? If that is the case, how is such an interaction between two highly polar acidic groups stabilized in the membrane? To directly address these issues, we determined the structure of the ζ chain TM (ζζ TM ) dimer as a representative signaling module through multidimensional solution NMR methods. The disulfide-stabilized ζζ dimer specifically interacts with the TM arginine of the TCRα chain and also acts as the signaling subunit for the activating NK cell receptor NKp46 ( Vitale et al., 1998 ). Given the high degree of sequence homology between ζ and Fcγ, the structure of the ζζ TM dimer is also relevant for receptors that associate with the Fcγ dimer, such as the Fc receptor for IgA, the platelet collagen receptor GPVI, and the osteoclast receptor OSCAR ( Ishikawa et al., 2004 ; Feng et al., 2005 ).

The technical challenges in expression, reconstitution, and structural NMR analysis of a hydrophobic peptide dimer are substantial, and only one such structure has been reported to date. Pioneering work on the erythrocyte surface protein glycophorin A (GpA) demonstrated that interactions among the TM domains result in a highly stable dimer. Mutagenesis studies identified a 7 residue TM dimerization motif (LIxxGVxxGVxxT) ( Lemmon et al., 1992a , 1992b ), and the solution NMR structure of the GpA TM dimer demonstrated intimate contacts between the two TM helices involving the two critical glycines of one strand and opposing valines of the other strand ( MacKenzie et al., 1997 ). It has been postulated that a similar glycine-based motif directs ζζ TM dimerization ( Bolliger and Johansson, 1999 ), but we report that the ζζ TM dimer is in fact different from GpA in almost every aspect, displaying polar features that are critical for both ζζ dimer formation and functional association with the TCR-CD3 complex.

DISCUSSION

For a large number of activating receptors, it appears that the critical structural information for assembly with their dimeric signaling modules is contained within the TM domains because TM peptides were assembly competent in all receptor systems studied ( Call et al., 2002 ; Feng et al., 2005 ; Garrity et al., 2005 ). The critical feature of this assembly mechanism is the requirement for a pair of acidic residues as the ligand for a single basic TM residue. We therefore sought to define the structure of the assembly-competent state of one of these dimeric signaling modules. We now report the high-resolution structure of the ζ chain TM dimer, a key component of both the TCR-CD3 complex and the activating NK cell receptor NKp46 ( Vitale et al., 1998 ). Sequence alignments reveal that the residues at the ζζ TM dimer interface are identical in the related Fcγ dimer, with the exception of a minor change at position 20 (F versus Y; Kuster et al., 1990 ; Rutledge et al., 1992 ), and the structure is thus also relevant for the large group of activating receptors that signal through the Fcγ dimer. The structure reveals several distinctive features that are of functional significance for ζζ dimerization and assembly with TCR.
