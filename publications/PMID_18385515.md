The AAA+ ATPase VPS4 plays an essential role in multivesicular body biogenesis 
and is thought to act by disassembling ESCRT-III complexes. VPS4 oligomerization 
and ATPase activity are promoted by binding to LIP5. LIP5 also binds to the 
ESCRT-III like protein CHMP5/hVps60, but how this affects its function remains 
unclear. Here we confirm that LIP5 binds tightly to CHMP5, but also find that it 
binds well to additional ESCRT-III proteins including CHMP1B, CHMP2A/hVps2-1, 
and CHMP3/hVps24 but not CHMP4A/hSnf7-1 or CHMP6/hVps20. LIP5 binds to a 
different region within CHMP5 than within the other ESCRT-III proteins. In 
CHMP1B and CHMP2A, its binding site encompasses sequences at the proteins' 
extreme C-termini that overlap with "MIT interacting motifs" (MIMs) known to 
bind to VPS4. We find unexpected evidence of a second conserved binding site for 
VPS4 in CHMP2A and CHMP1B, suggesting that LIP5 and VPS4 may bind simultaneously 
to these proteins despite the overlap in their primary binding sites. Finally, 
LIP5 binds preferentially to soluble CHMP5 but instead to polymerized CHMP2A, 
suggesting that the newly defined interactions between LIP5 and ESCRT-III 
proteins may be regulated by ESCRT-III conformation. These studies point to a 
role for direct binding between LIP5 and ESCRT-III proteins that is likely to 
complement LIP5's previously described ability to regulate VPS4 activity.

INTRODUCTION

Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are a subset of late endosomes morphologically characterized by the presence of intralumenal vesicles (ILVs; Gruenberg, 2004 ; Piper and Katzmann, 2007 ). Signaling receptors destined for degradation as well as certain lysosomal proteins are sorted into ILVs en route to the lysosome ( Katzmann et al. , 2002 ). Protein machinery involved in MVB biogenesis was discovered in studies of protein sorting to the vacuole in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Functional loss of what are termed the class E Vps (vacuolar protein sorting) proteins prevents delivery of cargo into the vacuole. Cargo accumulates instead on the limiting membrane of the vacuole and in an adjacent abnormal compartment referred to as the “class E compartment” ( Raymond et al. , 1992 ). Eighteen class E Vps proteins have been identified in yeast, and these proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution ( Babst, 2005 ; Hurley and Emr, 2006 ; Saksena et al. , 2007 ). Interestingly, several mammalian class E Vps proteins are also involved in viral budding and cytokinesis, demonstrating a conserved role in topologically similar membrane budding and fission reactions ( Demirov and Freed, 2004 ; Morita and Sundquist, 2004 ; Bieniasz, 2006 ; Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007 ; Morita et al. , 2007 ).

A majority of class E Vps proteins are components of four complexes that include Vps27/Hse1 (sometimes referred to as ESCRT-0), ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-III, where ESCRT is an acronym for endosomal sorting complex required for transport. These complexes are recruited (possibly sequentially) to endosomal membranes where they function in sorting cargo and generating ILVs. The AAA+ ATPase Vps4 is recruited by ESCRT-III to disassemble and recycle the ESCRT machinery ( Hurley and Emr, 2006 ; Saksena et al. , 2007 ; Williams and Urbe, 2007 ).

ESCRT-III components are small (200–250 amino acid) structurally related proteins. All have basic N-terminal and acidic C-terminal halves and are thought to share a common set of six α-helices ( Muziol et al. , 2006 ; Shim et al. , 2007 ). There are six ESCRT-III–related proteins in yeast (Vps2, Vps24, Vps20, and Snf7, core members; and Did2/Vps46 and Vps60, proposed regulatory members), and these are extended to eleven proteins in humans ( Kranz et al. , 2001 ; Babst et al. , 2002 ; Saksena et al. , 2007 ). Mammalian ESCRT-III proteins are referred to either as orthologues of their yeast counterparts or as CHMPs (charged multivesicular body proteins). To standardize our discussion of the large group of mammalian ESCRT-III proteins, we will primarily use the CHMP nomenclature in this article.

Unlike ESCRT-I and -II that are stable heteropolymeric complexes, ESCRT-III proteins are monomers in the cytoplasm and only assemble into complex on the endosomal membrane ( Babst et al. , 2002 ). In current models, ESCRT-III proteins are maintained in a metastable “closed” conformation in the cytoplasm and “open” when they bind to the membrane and assemble into polymers ( Hurley and Emr, 2006 ; Saksena et al. , 2007 ; Williams and Urbe, 2007 ; Shim et al. , 2007 ). These polymers may deform the membrane and participate in forming ILVs ( Hanson et al. , 2008 ). Previously we defined ∼40 amino acids at the extreme C-terminus of each core ESCRT-III protein as an autoregulatory domain that controls transition between these states ( Shim et al. , 2007 ). These 40 amino acids include a short C-terminal α-helix and a linker that connects it to the rest of the protein.

ESCRT-III does not spontaneously disassemble, but instead requires energy input from the AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) protein Vps4 ( Babst et al. , 1998 ), of which there are two isoforms in mammalian cells, VPS4A and VPS4B/SKD1. We will use VPS4 to refer generically to the different forms of this enzyme. VPS4 has recently been shown to bind via its N-terminal microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain to a short motif present in a subset of ESCRT-III proteins, including CHMP1 (Did2 in yeast), CHMP2 (Vps2 in yeast), and CHMP3 (Vps24 in yeast; Obita et al. , 2007 ; Stuchell-Brereton et al. , 2007 ). This VPS4 binding motif is in a short C-terminal α-helix and is referred to as the MIT domain–interacting motif (MIM; Obita et al. , 2007 ). The C-termini of the remaining ESCRT-III proteins (CHMP4 [Snf7 in yeast], CHMP5 [Vps60 in yeast], and CHMP6 [Vps20 in yeast]) do not contain the conserved MIM despite the fact that some of them have previously been shown to bind to VPS4 ( von Schwedler et al. , 2003 ; Yeo et al. , 2003 ; Xiao et al. , 2007 ). How VPS4 interacts with these proteins remains to be determined.

Although VPS4 activity is essential for MVB biogenesis, little is known about how it works. The AAA+ domain of VPS4 is similar to other AAA+ domains with the exception of an inserted β-sheet motif (referred to as the β domain) and a C-terminal α-helix ( Scott et al. , 2005a ; Xiao et al. , 2007 ). Like other AAA+ ATPases, VPS4 is thought to function as an oligomeric ring. VPS4 is primarily a monomer or dimer in the cytoplasm, and its assembly into a ring is enhanced by interaction of its β domain with the cofactor LIP5 (Vta1 in yeast; Scott et al. , 2005a ; Azmi et al. , 2006 ; Vajjhala et al. , 2006 ; Hartmann et al. , 2008 ; Yu et al. , 2008 ).

LIP5/Vta1 is a ∼300 amino acid long highly charged protein. Deletion of Vta1 in yeast leads to defects in cargo sorting and vacuolar morphology ( Shiflett et al. , 2004 ) and knockdown of LIP5 in mammalian cells significantly impairs receptor down-regulation and viral budding ( Ward et al. , 2005 ). A conserved domain at the C-terminus of LIP5 (the “VSL (Vta1/SBP1/LIP5) domain”) mediates LIP5 dimerization and interaction with Vps4 ( Azmi et al. , 2006 ).

In addition to binding to VPS4, LIP5/Vta1 has been found to interact with CHMP5/Vps60, one of the proposed regulatory ESCRT-III proteins ( Shiflett et al. , 2004 ; Ward et al. , 2005 ; Azmi et al. , 2006 ; Rue et al. , 2007 ). This interaction is robust and has been documented in many systems. Less well explored connections between Vta1 and a few other ESCRT-III–related proteins have been reported, primarily in yeast. In particular, Vta1 binds to Did2/Vps46 (yeast ortholog of CHMP1; Lottridge et al. , 2006 ) and the name Vta1 (Vps twenty [Vps20]–associated 1) was originally derived from a connection between Vps20 and Vta1, although this interaction has not been reproduced ( Yeo et al. , 2003 ; Azmi et al. , 2006 ).

In the present study, we directly examine the ability of LIP5 to bind each of the six classes of ESCRT-III–related proteins in order to determine whether ternary interactions between LIP5, VPS4, and ESCRT-III might play a role in ESCRT-III disassembly. We confirm that LIP5 binds to CHMP5, but also find that it binds to CHMP1B, CHMP2A, and CHMP3 but not to CHMP4A or CHMP6. Mapping the binding sites reveals that LIP5 binds to the extreme C-terminal region of CHMP1B and CHMP2A and instead to an internal sequence in CHMP5. Complexes of LIP5 with CHMP5 are preferentially soluble, whereas those between LIP5 and CHMP2A are polymeric and insoluble. The C-terminal binding site for LIP5 in CHMP1B and CHMP2A overlaps with the previously defined “MIT interacting motif” or MIM responsible for recruiting Vps4. Surprisingly, we find evidence of a second binding site for VPS4 within these ESCRT-III proteins that may allow them to simultaneously interact with VPS4 and LIP5. These studies suggest that LIP5 is deeply intertwined with ESCRT-III and VPS4 in the pathway leading to multivesicular body formation.

DISCUSSION

LIP5 (Vta1 in yeast) emerged in recent years as a protein involved in late stages of MVB formation and viral budding. It participates in these events at least in part by binding via its C-terminal “VSL domain” to the AAA ATPase VPS4 to enhance oligomerization and ATPase activity ( Scott et al. , 2005a ; Azmi et al. , 2006 ; Lottridge et al. , 2006 ; Vajjhala et al. , 2006 ). At the same time, LIP5 also binds via its N-terminus to the ESCRT-III–related protein CHMP5 (Vps60 in yeast; Shiflett et al. , 2004 ; Ward et al. , 2005 ; Rue et al. , 2007 ), and in yeast Vta1 has been shown to bind to Vps46, another ESCRT-III–related protein ( Lottridge et al. , 2006 ). Whether, and if so how, these interactions affect VPS4 activity toward ESCRT-III complexes has been unclear. Here, we define new and unexpected relationships among these proteins, including a high-affinity connection between LIP5 and the C-termini of a subset of ESCRT-III proteins and a second binding site for VPS4 further inside these proteins. In addition, comparison of LIP5's interaction with CHMP5 and the other ESCRT-III proteins revealed important differences in where and how the proteins bind to each other, suggesting the possibility of a unique role for CHMP5. These findings lead us to propose that there are at least two ways in which LIP5 is involved in ESCRT-III disassembly.

LIP5 has been clearly shown to be a positive modulator of the MVB sorting pathway. Reducing its expression by RNAi decreases degradation of the EGF receptor and blocks HIV viral particle release, whereas overexpressing it has no effect ( Ward et al. , 2005 ). In yeast, mutations in VTA1 impair membrane protein degradation and create a weak class E phenotype, the severity of which may depend on the flux of cargo through the endosomal pathway ( Shiflett et al. , 2004 ; Azmi et al. , 2006 ; Rue et al. , 2007 ). Although LIP5's known role in VPS4 oligomerization might explain these effects, our results reveal that LIP5 also directly and efficiently engages a number of ESCRT-III proteins, including in particular those that contain the C-terminal MIM known to bind VPS4 ( Figures 1 and 2 ; Obita et al. , 2007 ; Stuchell-Brereton et al. , 2007 ).

How might LIP5 bound to ESCRT-III proteins modulate progress through the MVB pathway? Because LIP5 and ESCRT-III are already thought to be cofactor and substrate of VPS4, respectively, it is logical to think that their interaction will affect VPS4 function. This idea is supported by the fact that the same ESCRT-III proteins that bind well to VPS4 (CHMP1, CHMP2, and CHMP3) bind well to LIP5 ( Howard et al. , 2001 ; Scott et al. , 2005b ; Nickerson et al. , 2006 ; Obita et al. , 2007 ; Stuchell-Brereton et al. , 2007 ). One possibility is that the extra link between LIP5 and ESCRT-III complex ensures that VPS4 oligomerizes only where it is needed. In the simplest scenario, this would predict that interactions between these three proteins would reinforce each other. Indeed, VPS4 interacts with ESCRT-III and LIP5/Vta1 via separate domains ( Azmi et al. , 2006 ; Vajjhala et al. , 2006 ). Similarly, LIP5/Vta1 binds to VPS4 and the ESCRT-III like protein CHMP5/Vps60 via its C-terminus and N-terminus, respectively ( Azmi et al. , 2006 ). However, we found that the VPS4 MIT domain reduces LIP5 binding to both CHMP2A and CHMP1B, indicating that everything cannot happen simultaneously ( Figure 5 ).

At the same time, we found evidence for a second, more internal, binding site for VPS4 in these ESCRT-III proteins ( Figures 6 and 7 ), leading us to suggest that the interaction of VPS4 with the MIM motifs in α6 may represent only one step in ESCRT-III disassembly. Although we were unable to precisely define the second VPS4 binding motif in vitro, deletion and alanine scanning studies in both CHMP2A and CHMP1B indicated that this interaction depends on conserved sequences within these proteins' α5 helix and in particular on two acidic residues that are conserved across ESCRT-III proteins. Interestingly, α5 occupies an exposed position in the crystal structure of CHMP3 ( Muziol et al. , 2006 ), which probably represents the “open” form of these proteins ( Saksena et al. , 2007 ). We propose that interaction of VPS4–using its MIT domain, elements within its AAA+ domain such as the “pore loops” known to be important for its function ( Scott et al. , 2005a ), or possibly an associated cofactor such as the recently described Ist1 ( Dimaano et al. , 2008 )—with α5 in all ESCRT-III proteins is likely to be an important additional step in ESCRT-III complex disassembly.

Although LIP5 is clearly established as a positive modulator of the MVB sorting pathway, the role played by CHMP5 (Vps60 in yeast) is less clear. CHMP5 binds with high affinity to LIP5 ( Figure 8 ), and deleting these two proteins in yeast has overlapping rather than additive effects ( Rue et al. , 2007 ). However, reducing or eliminating CHMP5 expression in mammalian tissues or cells does not prevent formation of MVBs (nor incorporation of TGF-β receptors into the internal vesicles; Shim et al. , 2006 ) and in fact enhances HIV budding from cells ( Ward et al. , 2005 ). These effects, together with the fact that LIP5's interaction with CHMP5 is fundamentally different from its interaction with the other ESCRT-III proteins, lead us to suggest that CHMP5 bound to LIP5 might negatively regulate LIP5 for engagement with other ESCRT-III proteins and VPS4. This possibility remains to be further explored.

A model that summarizes our results and how they impact thinking about the cooperation between LIP5 and VPS4 in regulating ESCRT-III is shown in Figure 9 . Binding sites for LIP5 (α5 in CHMP5 and α6 in CHMP1B and CHMP2A) and for VPS4B (previously described primary site in α6, secondary binding site in α5) are shown in Figure 9 A. The relationship between ESCRT-III subunits, ESCRT-III complex, and LIP5 and VPS4 is depicted in Figure 9 B. ESCRT-III proteins are closed monomers in the cytosol. In this state, our results suggest that only CHMP5 binds to LIP5. When ESCRT-III proteins polymerize into complexes on the endosomal membrane (presumably nucleated by upstream factors that are connected to cargo) the subunits open, exposing sequences at their C-termini for binding to LIP5 and/or VPS4. How these two proteins share their overlapping binding sites remains to be determined, but their separate ability to bind each other (via domains that are not engaged with the ESCRT-III proteins, the β domain in VPS4 ( Scott et al. , 2005a ; Vajjhala et al. , 2006 ) and the VSL domain in LIP5 ( Azmi et al. , 2006 ) is likely to reinforce their association. Once some threshold is reached (perhaps full assembly of a VPS4 oligomer; Hartmann et al. , 2008 ; Yu et al. , 2008 ), we hypothesize that VPS4 engages its secondary contact site. This in turn may allow VPS4 to unfold individual ESCRT-III subunits and release them into the cytoplasm, where they revert to their closed and monomeric states. Although aspects of this model remain to be confirmed, and importantly any ESCRT-III disassembly reaction has yet to be reconstituted, the intricacies of this important step in MVB biogenesis are finally starting to come into focus.

While this article was being reviewed and revised, two articles examining the structure and interactions of Vta1 (the yeast equivalent of LIP5) were published ( Azmi et al. , 2008 ; Xiao et al. , 2008 ). In one, the high-resolution crystal structure of the Vta1 N-terminus revealed two MIT-like domains, each consisting of three α-helices ( Xiao et al. , 2008 ). This structure strongly supports our finding of a high-affinity interaction between LIP5 and the MIM-containing ESCRT-III proteins CHMP1B and CHMP2A and suggests that one or both of LIP5's MIT domains binds to these proteins. In the second article, the interaction between Vta1 and Vps60 (yeast CHMP5) was explored in more detail with results that largely agree with what we report here for mammalian proteins ( Azmi et al. , 2008 ). Significant differences are the failure to see a high-affinity interaction between Vta1 and Vps2 in the yeast system and mapping of the Vta1 binding site in Vps60 to α4 instead of α5 as found here for CHMP5 and LIP5. Whether these differences reflect differences in the protein interactions or in the conditions used to study them remains to be established.
