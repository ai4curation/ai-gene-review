both microvascular and macrovascular endothelial cells leading to suppression of 
angiogenesis. Peg3 coimmunoprecipitated with Beclin 1 and LC3 and was required 
for maintaining basal levels of Beclin 1. Decorin, via Peg3, induced 
transcription of Beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 
alpha genes, thereby leading to a protracted autophagic program. 
Mechanistically, decorin interacted with VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in a region 
overlapping with its natural ligand VEGFA, and VEGFR2 was required for

Abstract

Soluble decorin affects the biology of several receptor tyrosine kinases by triggering receptor internalization and degradation. We found that decorin induced paternally expressed gene 3 ( Peg3 ), an imprinted tumor suppressor gene, and that Peg3 relocated into autophagosomes labeled by Beclin 1 and microtubule-associated light chain 3. Decorin evoked Peg3-dependent autophagy in both microvascular and macrovascular endothelial cells leading to suppression of angiogenesis. Peg3 coimmunoprecipitated with Beclin 1 and LC3 and was required for maintaining basal levels of Beclin 1. Decorin, via Peg3, induced transcription of Beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha genes, thereby leading to a protracted autophagic program. Mechanistically, decorin interacted with VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in a region overlapping with its natural ligand VEGFA, and VEGFR2 was required for decorin-evoked Beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha expression as well as for Peg3 induction in endothelial cells. Moreover, decorin induced VEGFR2-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, we have unveiled a mechanism for a secreted proteoglycan in inducing Peg3, a master regulator of macroautophagy in endothelial cells.

Discussion

The evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic process of autophagy promotes nonspecific turnover of bulk cytosolic components, long-lived proteins, and cellular organelles that have exceeded operational capacity or have become damaged ( 45 ). Autophagy can exert a potent oncosuppressive function by acting to discard critical organelles that otherwise would be involved in the promotion of the tumorigenic phenotype ( 46 ). This function is in perfect accordance with an emergent body of evidence that reinforces decorin as a soluble paracrine tumor repressor whose absence is permissive for tumorigenic growth. This activity is manifested through the concerted efforts to evoke intracellular degradation of several oncogenes downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling known to promote malignant conditions, including the myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (Myc) and hypoxia-inducible factor alpha ( 5 , 22 , 23 ) as a molecular basis for angiostasis.

We hypothesized that decorin could down-regulate β-catenin by inducing expression of Peg3. Zebrafish embryos injected with Peg3 mRNA display marked defects in tail development ( 31 ). Similarly, injection of decorin in zebrafish embryos causes shortening of the body axis with defects in convergent extension ( 47 ) that are strikingly similar to those seen with injection of Peg3 mRNA. The noncanonical wingless-type MMTV integration site family (Wnt) pathway regulates convergent extension, because Wnt5 and Wnt11 mutants show cyclopia and defects in convergent extension ( 48 , 49 ). Thus, decorin and Peg3 are two key modulators of the noncanonical Wnt pathway in vertebrate development and possibly act within the same pathway during both developmental and tumorigenic processes. Notably, Wnt3a induces decorin expression in cocultures of hematopoietic stem progenitor and stromal cells ( 50 ). In this system, decorin causes changes similar to those caused by Wnt3a. Moreover, the number of hematopoietic stem cells is increased significantly in the bone marrow and spleen of decorin-null mice. Thus, decorin plays a key role in the mechanism of Wnt signaling and could shape niches supportive of hematopoiesis ( 50 ).

The first line of evidence to tie decorin signaling to Peg3 came from the empirical demonstration of Peg3 induction exclusively within the tumor microenvironment following systemic administration of decorin ( 24 ). Immunofluorescence studies revealed a dramatic association of Peg3 with subcellular structures resembling autophagosomes. The identity of these structures later was confirmed with prominent colocalization of the canonical autophagic markers Beclin 1 and LC3. Thus, we have linked a soluble constituent of the extracellular matrix to the intracellular digestive machinery in both macrovascular and microvascular endothelial cells.

The interaction discovered via confocal microscopy was corroborated by coimmunoprecipitation studies, which confirmed that Peg3 physically associates with Beclin 1 under basal conditions with further recruitment of LC3 and β-catenin in response to decorin. Collectively, these data implicate Peg3 as a putative component of the initial Beclin 1-containing autophagic scaffold, potentially integrating cellular bioenergetic inputs into autophagic outputs. Exogenous agents such as decorin engaging and signaling via VEGFR2 would further stimulate this association. We note that decorin-evoked autophagy in endothelial cells occurs under normoxia and nutrient-enriched conditions, suggesting a distinct pathway likely mediated by an antagonistic effect on the key angiogenic receptor VEGFR2. Furthermore, Peg3 also modulates LC3 in the later autophagic pathway but only after initiation of the process. In our current working model ( Fig. S7 ) we postulate that decorin, by binding to VEGFR2, triggers a signaling cascade leading to induction of Class III PI3K and enhanced Peg3 stability and/or accumulation which in turn recruits Beclin 1, β-catenin, and LC3 to evoke autophagy. Decorin significantly stabilizes BECN1 and MAPLC3A mRNA, but not PEG3 mRNA, in HUVEC. Therefore enhanced Peg3 protein stability conceivably could orchestrate decorin-evoked autophagy via activation of BECN1 and MAPLC3A expression. This process can be inhibited efficiently by depleting VEGFR2 with siRNA or pharmacologically blocking the VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase activity with the small molecule SU5416. It currently is unknown whether decorin triggers internalization of VEGFR2 in an analogous fashion to EGFR and Met, followed by lysosomal fusion and degradation. Further, it also remains to be shown whether decorin also cointernalizes with the targeted RTK; presumably decorin also is degraded by the lysosome following down-regulation. Decorin-induced Peg3 can transcriptionally enhance Beclin 1 and LC3, both of which can be blocked by Peg3 suppression via siRNA ( Fig. S7 ). Thus, Peg3 can be considered a key protein in the initiation and maintenance of autophagy. Notably, Peg3 has been shown previously to be involved in regulation of cachexia ( 51 ), a severe muscle-wasting condition often associated with poor outcome in advanced cancer.

The functional role of Peg3 was proven to be indispensable not only for decorin-evoked autophagy, as signified by induction of Beclin 1, but also for maintaining basal levels of Beclin 1. Indeed, siRNA-mediated silencing of Peg3 substantially reduces basal levels of Beclin 1 mRNA and protein, most prominently in HUVEC. However, this effect is not achieved in MDEC. This difference might result from inherent differences in these primary cells, in that HUVEC are more embryonic than MDEC and thus might be more attuned to the function of Peg3, recently characterized as a candidate stem cell marker ( 52 ). Intriguingly, basal levels of MAPLC3A are relatively unperturbed by Peg3 silencing. However, in both MDEC and HUVEC, silencing of Peg3 severely compromises decorin-dependent induction of BECN1 and MAPLC3A expression. These effects are mirrored at the protein level, thereby indicating that Peg3 has a vital transcriptional function over these critical autophagic targets. Further, Peg3 is wholly responsible for decorin-mediated induction of Beclin 1 and thus decorin-evoked endothelial cell autophagy. Importantly, loss of Peg3 via siRNA also prevents rapamycin from inducing Beclin1 and LC3. This result provides insight into the upstream regulation of Peg3, because rapamycin potently inhibits mTOR.

We should point out that when the decorin proteoglycan was used, we obtained comparable results, indicating that the glycosaminoglycan chain is dispensable. Specificity was confirmed by the lack of an autophagic response in the presence of equimolar amounts of biglycan protein core, the closest molecular relative of decorin. Decorin, by signaling via RTK interactions, can ameliorate the overall antitumor properties of the tumor stroma by counteracting malignant development to stymie tumor progression ( 5 , 13 , 24 ) and angiogenesis ( 20 , 23 ). Typically, these interactions are exclusively antagonistic. However, in HUVEC and MDEC, incubation with SU5416 completely abrogates decorin-dependent induction of BECN1 and MAPLC3A expression. This effect is further confirmed with siRNA targeting VEGFR2 in HUVEC, which phenocopy the results obtained with SU5416. Pretreatment of HUVEC with VEGFA completely abrogates the ability of decorin to induce transcriptional activation of BECN1 , whereas VEGFA alone is sufficient to evoke suppression of basal BECN1 mRNA. These data confirm not only that VEGFR2 is required but also that decorin must signal through this RTK to achieve transcriptional activation of the target loci, in a mechanism inherently different from that of VEGFA. Moreover, VEGFR2 lies upstream of Peg3, because these data are entirely epistatic to the depletion of Peg3 and the ensuing effects on decorin-evoked expression of BECN1 and MAPLC3A .

Decorin can signal through the EGFR and induce rapid thrombospondin-1 secretion from the tumor parenchyma and mammary carcinoma cells ( 53 ). This signaling could represent an additional anti-angiogenic activity of this molecule that could modulate the biology of several types of cancer by directly affecting the tumor microenvironment ( 54 , 55 ). Moreover, we have shown previously that there is a genetic cooperation between decorin and p53, because double-null mice succumb to a highly aggressive thymic lymphoma within the first 6 mo of postnatal life, whereas p53-null mice live longer and present several types of neoplasia ( 56 ). Notably, Peg3 has been shown to regulate p53-mediated apoptosis by interacting directly with the Seven in absentia homolog 1 (Siah1a) ( 57 ) and by inducing Bcl2-associated X (Bax) translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria ( 58 ). Thus, it is plausible that decorin might affect this pathway in endothelial cells also, because we have shown previously that decorin induces apoptosis in carcinoma cells by activating caspase 3 ( 59 ).

The functional consequences of Beclin 1 induction being dependent on VEGFR2 and Peg3 regulation could be important for blunting capillary morphogenesis, restricting endothelial cell migration, and compromising mitochondrial membrane integrity. This scenario is further supported by the loss of Δψm, typically an early harbinger of the intrinsic apoptotic response ( 43 ). However, this function also may activate autophagy as a mechanism to eliminate damaged mitochondria in an attempt to save the cell from the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species and ensuing peroxidative stressors, leading to further mutagenic events that foster tumorigenesis. The induction of endothelial cell autophagy in the light of inhibited capillary morphogenesis might be functionally linked via Peg3, a master regulator of macroautophagy. The requirement of decorin-mediated autophagy within the stroma might form the fundamental basis for decorin-dependent angiostasis and therefore underlies the basic tumoricidal properties of the molecule.

In conclusion, our studies delineate a key role for soluble decorin in reprogramming the tumor stroma via direct induction of endothelial cell autophagy, a fundamental cellular process that in this context acts to combat tumor angiogenesis. The discovery that decorin-induced Peg3 is competent to activate the transcription of autophagic proteins such as Beclin 1 and LC3 indicates that messages embedded in the extracellular milieu can profoundly affect autophagy. These data further stress the need for treatment based on systemic delivery of decorin, a genuinely multifaceted matrix constituent, as a viable modality in the ongoing war against cancer.
