The transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC) targets cytoplasmic 
C-terminal tail-anchored (TA) proteins to their respective membranes in the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and mitochondria. It is composed of three 
proteins, GET4, BAG6, and GET5. We identified an individual with compound 
heterozygous missense variants (p.Arg122His, p.Ile279Met) in GET4 that reduced 
all three TRC proteins by 70% to 90% in his fibroblasts, suggesting a possible 
defect in TA protein targeting. He presented with global developmental delay, 
intellectual disabilities, seizures, facial dysmorphism, and delayed bone age. 
We found the TA protein, syntaxin 5, is poorly targeted to Golgi membranes 
compared to normal controls. Since GET4 regulates ER to Golgi transport, we 
hypothesized that such transport would be disrupted in his fibroblasts, and 
discovered that retrograde (but not anterograde) transport was significantly 
reduced. Despite reduction in the three TRC proteins, their mRNA levels were 
unchanged, suggesting increased degradation in patient fibroblasts. Treating 
fibroblasts with the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (10 nM), 
restored syntaxin 5 localization and nearly normalized the levels of all three 
TRC proteins. Our study identifies the first individual with GET4 mutations.
