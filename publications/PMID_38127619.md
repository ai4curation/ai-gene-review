Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a master regulator that monitors the 
availability of various amino acids to promote cell growth in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. It is activated via two distinct upstream pathways: the Gtr pathway, 
which corresponds to mammalian Rag, and the Pib2 pathway. This study shows that 
Ser3 was phosphorylated exclusively in a Pib2-dependent manner. Using Ser3 as an 
indicator of TORC1 activity, together with the established TORC1 substrate Sch9, 
we investigated which pathways were employed by individual amino acids. 
Different amino acids exhibited different dependencies on the Gtr and Pib2 
pathways. Cysteine was most dependent on the Pib2 pathway and increased the 
interaction between TORC1 and Pib2 in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, cysteine 
directly bound to Pib2 via W632 and F635, two critical residues in the T(ail) 
motif that are necessary to activate TORC1. These results indicate that Pib2 
functions as a sensor for cysteine in TORC1 regulation.
