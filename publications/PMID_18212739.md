Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disorder characterized by cancer susceptibility 
and cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinks and other damages. Thirteen 
complementation groups and genes are identified, including BRCA2, which is 
defective in the FA-D1 group. Eight of the FA proteins, including FANCG, 
participate in a nuclear core complex that is required for the 
monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 and FANCI. FANCD2, like FANCD1/BRCA2, is not part 
of the core complex, and we previously showed direct BRCA2-FANCD2 interaction 
using yeast two-hybrid analysis. We now show in human and hamster cells that 
expression of FANCG protein, but not the other core complex proteins, is 
required for co-precipitation of BRCA2 and FANCD2. We also show that 
phosphorylation of FANCG serine 7 is required for its co-precipitation with 
BRCA2, XRCC3 and FANCD2, as well as the direct interaction of BRCA2-FANCD2. 
These results argue that FANCG has a role independent of the FA core complex, 
and we propose that phosphorylation of serine 7 is the signalling event required 
for forming a discrete complex comprising FANCD1/BRCA2-FANCD2-FANCG-XRCC3 
(D1-D2-G-X3). Cells that fail to express either phospho-Ser7-FANCG, or full 
length BRCA2 protein, lack the interactions amongst the four component proteins. 
A role for D1-D2-G-X3 in homologous recombination repair (HRR) is supported by 
our finding that FANCG and the RAD51-paralog XRCC3 are epistatic for sensitivity 
to DNA crosslinking compounds in DT40 chicken cells. Our findings further define 
the intricate interface between FANC and HRR proteins in maintaining chromosome 
stability.

Native Mass Spectrometry (nMS) is a versatile technique for elucidating protein structure. Surface-Induced Dissociation (SID) is an activation method in tandem MS predominantly employed for determining protein complex stoichiometry, alongside information on interface strengths. SID-nMS data can be collected over a range of acceleration energies, yielding Energy Resolved Mass Spectrometry (ERMS) data. Previous work demonstrated that the onset/appearance energy from SID-nMS can be used in integrative computational/experimental modeling to guide multimeric structure determination in some cases. However, the appearance energy is a single data point, while ERMS data provide a full pattern of interface breakage. We hypothesized that incorporation of ERMS data into multimeric protein structure prediction would significantly outperform appearance energy. To test this hypothesis, we generated models of 20 protein complexes with RosettaDock using subunits generated from AlphaFold2. We simulated the ERMS data for each predicted model and rescored based on its agreement to experimental ERMS data. We demonstrated that more accurately predicted models exhibited simulated ERMS data in better agreement to the experimental data. As part of our ERMS-based rescoring, we matched or improved the RMSD of the best scoring model compared to Rosetta in 16 out of 20 cases, with 4 out of 20 cases improving to become a highly accurate (below 5 Å) structure. Finally, we benchmarked our method against our previously published appearance energy-based rescoring and showed improvement in 14 out of 20 cases, with 6 out of 20 becoming a highly accurate (below 5 Å) model. Our method is freely available through Rosetta Commons, with a usage tutorial and test files provided in the supplementary information.
