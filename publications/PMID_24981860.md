Chromatin regulation is driven by multicomponent protein complexes, which form 
functional modules. Deciphering the components of these modules and their 
interactions is central to understanding the molecular pathways these proteins 
are regulating, their functions, and their relation to both normal development 
and disease. We describe the use of affinity purifications of tagged human 
proteins coupled with mass spectrometry to generate a protein-protein 
interaction map encompassing known and predicted chromatin-related proteins. On 
the basis of 1,394 successful purifications of 293 proteins, we report a 
high-confidence (85% precision) network involving 11,464 protein-protein 
interactions among 1,738 different human proteins, grouped into 164 often 
overlapping protein complexes with a particular focus on the family of 
JmjC-containing lysine demethylases, their partners, and their roles in 
chromatin remodeling. We show that RCCD1 is a partner of histone H3K36 
demethylase KDM8 and demonstrate that both are important for 
cell-cycle-regulated transcriptional repression in centromeric regions and 
accurate mitotic division.
