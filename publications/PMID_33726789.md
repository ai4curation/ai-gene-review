TMEM132D is a human gene identified with multiple risk alleles for panic 
disorders, anxiety and major depressive disorders. Defining a conserved family 
of transmembrane proteins, TMEM132D and its homologs are still of unknown 
molecular functions. By generating loss-of-function mutants of the sole TMEM132 
ortholog in C. elegans, we identify abnormal morphologic phenotypes in the 
dopaminergic PDE neurons. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we find that NAP1 
directly interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of human TMEM132D, and mutations 
in C. elegans tmem-132 that disrupt interaction with NAP1 cause similar 
morphologic defects in the PDE neurons. NAP1 is a component of the WAVE 
regulatory complex (WRC) that controls F-actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Decreasing 
activity of WRC rescues the PDE defects in tmem-132 mutants, whereas 
gain-of-function of TMEM132D in mammalian cells inhibits WRC, leading to 
decreased abundance of select WRC components, impaired actin nucleation and cell 
motility. We propose that metazoan TMEM132 family proteins play evolutionarily 
conserved roles in regulating NAP1 protein homologs to restrict inappropriate 
WRC activity, cytoskeletal and morphologic changes in the cell.
