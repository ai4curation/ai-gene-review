The NPM-ALK fusion gene, formed by the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation in 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, encodes a 75-kDa hybrid protein that contains the 
amino-terminal 117 amino acid residues of the nucleolar phosphoprotein 
nucleophosmin (NPM) joined to the entire cytoplasmic portion of the receptor 
tyrosine kinase ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). Here, we demonstrate the 
transforming ability of NPM-ALK and show that oncogenesis by the chimeric 
protein requires the activation of its kinase function as a result of 
oligomerization mediated by the NPM segment. Sedimentation gradient experiments 
revealed that NPM-ALK forms in vivo multimeric complexes of approximately 200 
kDa or greater that also contain normal NPM. Cell fractionation studies of the 
t(2;5) translocation-containing lymphoma cell line SUP-M2 showed NPM-ALK to be 
localized within both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Immunostaining 
performed with both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-ALK antibodies confirmed the 
dual location of the oncoprotein and also indicated that NPM-ALK is abundant 
within both the nucleoplasm and the nucleolus. An intact NPM segment is 
absolutely required for NPM-ALK-mediated oncogenesis, as indicated by our 
observation that three different NPM-ALK mutant proteins lacking nonoverlapping 
portions of the NPM segment were each unable to form complexes, lacked kinase 
activity in vivo, and failed to transform cells. However, NPM could be 
functionally replaced in the fusion protein with the portion of the unrelated 
translocated promoter region (TPR) protein that activates the TPR-MET fusion 
kinase by mediating dimerization through its leucine zipper motif. This 
engineered TPR-ALK hybrid protein, which transformed cells almost as efficiently 
as NPM-ALK, was localized solely within the cytoplasm of cells. These data 
indicate that the nuclear and nucleolar localization of NPM-ALK, which probably 
occur because of transport via the shuttling activity of NPM, is not required 
for oncogenesis. Further, the activation of the truncated ALK protein by a 
completely heterologous oligomerization domain suggests that the functionally 
important role of the NPM segment of NPM-ALK in transformation is restricted to 
the formation of kinase-active oligomers and does not involve the alteration of 
normal NPM functions.
