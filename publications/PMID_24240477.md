Dense multicilia in higher vertebrates are important for luminal flow and the 
removal of thick mucus. To generate hundreds of basal bodies for 
multiciliogenesis, specialized terminally differentiated epithelial cells 
undergo massive centriole amplification. In proliferating cells, however, 
centriole duplication occurs only once per cell cycle. How cells ensure proper 
regulation of centriole biogenesis in different contexts is poorly understood. 
We report that the centriole amplification is controlled by two duplicated 
genes, Cep63 and Deup1. Cep63 regulates mother-centriole-dependent centriole 
duplication. Deup1 governs deuterosome assembly to mediate large-scale de novo 
centriole biogenesis. Similarly to Cep63, Deup1 binds to Cep152 and then 
recruits Plk4 to activate centriole biogenesis. Phylogenetic analyses suggest 
that Deup1 diverged from Cep63 in a certain ancestor of lobe-finned fishes 
during vertebrate evolution and was subsequently adopted by tetrapods. Thus, the 
Cep63 gene duplication has enabled mother-centriole-independent assembly of the 
centriole duplication machinery to satisfy different requirements for centriole 
number.
