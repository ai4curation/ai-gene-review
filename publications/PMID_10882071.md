Iron absorption by the duodenal mucosa is initiated by uptake of ferrous Fe(II) 
iron across the brush border membrane and culminates in transfer of the metal 
across the basolateral membrane to the portal vein circulation by an unknown 
mechanism. We describe here the isolation and characterization of a novel cDNA 
(Ireg1) encoding a duodenal protein that is localized to the basolateral 
membrane of polarized epithelial cells. Ireg1 mRNA and protein expression are 
increased under conditions of increased iron absorption, and the 5' UTR of the 
Ireg1 mRNA contains a functional iron-responsive element (IRE). IREG1 stimulates 
iron efflux following expression in Xenopus oocytes. We conclude that IREG1 
represents the long-sought duodenal iron export protein and is upregulated in 
the iron overload disease, hereditary hemochromatosis.
