The yeast mitochondrial Hsp70, Ssc1p, functions as a molecular chaperone with 
its partner proteins, Mdj1p (DnaJ homologue) and Yge1p (GrpE homologue). We have 
purified a mature form of Ssc1p from yeast mitochondria and those of Mdj1p and 
Yge1p from Escherichia coli overexpresser cells. With these purified components 
of the mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone system, we have succeeded in reconstituting 
their chaperone functions in the protection of firefly luciferase against 
thermal damage in vitro. Heat-denatured luciferase is prevented from 
irreversible aggregation and is maintained in a refolding-competent state by 
Ssc1p and/or Mdj1p at 42 degreesC. Luciferase denatured at 42 degreesC is 
actively reactivated by Ssc1p, Mdj1p and/or Yge1p after lowering the temperature 
to 25 degreesC. The reactivation process of heat-denatured luciferase shows 
two-phase kinetics. The slow refolding process requires either Ssc1p or Mdj1p at 
42 degreesC but the presence of Ssc1p, Mdj1p and Yge1p, and ATP hydrolysis, is 
essential at 25 degreesC. The slow refolding of luciferase involves multiple 
rounds of formation and dissociation of the complex between luciferase and 
Mdj1p/Ssc1p. On the other hand, the fast refolding process is most enhanced when 
luciferase is incubated with Ssc1p alone at 42 degreesC, and it requires neither 
the assistance of Mdj1p and Yge1p nor ATP hydrolysis. We have observed a similar 
two-pathway reactivation of heat-denatured luciferase by the bacterial Hsp70 and 
the yeast cytosolic Hsp70 systems.
