OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 
polymorphisms in the promoter region of the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic 
subunit (GCLC) gene may be associated with coronary endothelial vasomotor 
dysfunction and myocardial infarction (MI).
BACKGROUND: Glutamate-cysteine ligase is a rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of 
glutathione (GSH) that plays a crucial role in the intracellular antioxidant 
defense systems. Oxidants transcriptionally upregulate the GCLC gene for GSH 
synthesis, providing a protective mechanism against oxidant-induced endothelial 
dysfunction or activation, which plays a pathogenetic role in cardiovascular 
diseases.
METHODS: The association of the possible polymorphisms with coronary arterial 
diameter responses to acetylcholine was determined in 62 male subjects. The 
frequency of polymorphisms was compared between 255 male patients with MI and 
179 male control subjects.
RESULTS: We found a polymorphism (-129C/T) in which the T allele showed lower 
promoter activity (50% to 60% of the activity of the C allele) in response to 
H(2)O(2) in human endothelial cells. Endothelium-dependent dilation of coronary 
arteries was impaired in subjects with the -129T allele (n = 31), as compared 
with the age-matched subjects without the -129T allele (n = 31). The T allele 
was highly frequent in patients with MI as compared with control subjects, and 
it was a significant risk factor for MI, independent of traditional coronary 
risk factors (odds ratio [OR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08 to 3.03; p 
= 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The -129T polymorphism of the GCLC gene may suppress the GCLC gene 
induction response to an oxidant, and it is implicated in coronary endothelial 
vasomotor dysfunction and MI.
