Optimal timing of flowering in higher plants is crucial for successful 
reproduction and is coordinated by external and internal factors, including 
light and the circadian clock. In Arabidopsis, light-dependent stabilization of 
the rhythmically expressed CONSTANS (CO) is required for the activation of 
FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), resulting in the initiation of flowering. Phytochrome A 
and cryptochrome photoreceptors stabilize CO in the evening by attenuating the 
activity of the CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1-SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 1 
(COP1-SPA1) ubiquitin ligase complex, which promotes turnover of CO. In 
contrast, phytochrome B (phyB) facilitates degradation of CO in the morning and 
delays flowering. Accordingly, flowering is accelerated in phyB mutants. 
Paradoxically, plants overexpressing phyB also show early flowering, which may 
arise from an early phase of rhythmic CO expression. Here we demonstrate that 
overexpression of phyB induces FT transcription at dusk and in the night without 
affecting the phase or level of CO transcription. This response depends on the 
light-activated Pfr form of phyB that inhibits the function of the COP1-SPA1 
complex by direct interactions. Our data suggest that attenuation of COP1 
activity results in the accumulation of CO protein and subsequent induction of 
FT. We show that phosphorylation of Ser-86 inhibits this function of phyB by 
accelerating dark reversion and thus depletion of Pfr forms in the night. Our 
results explain the early flowering phenotype of phyB overexpression and reveal 
additional features of the molecular machinery by which photoreceptors mediate 
photoperiodism.
