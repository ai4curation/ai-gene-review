Methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin produced in natural environments from 
inorganic mercury by anaerobic bacteria. However, until now the genes and 
proteins involved have remained unidentified. Here, we report a two-gene 
cluster, hgcA and hgcB, required for mercury methylation by Desulfovibrio 
desulfuricans ND132 and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA. In either bacterium, 
deletion of hgcA, hgcB, or both genes abolishes mercury methylation. The genes 
encode a putative corrinoid protein, HgcA, and a 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin, HgcB, 
consistent with roles as a methyl carrier and an electron donor required for 
corrinoid cofactor reduction, respectively. Among bacteria and archaea with 
sequenced genomes, gene orthologs are present in confirmed methylators but 
absent in nonmethylators, suggesting a common mercury methylation pathway in all 
methylating bacteria and archaea sequenced to date.
