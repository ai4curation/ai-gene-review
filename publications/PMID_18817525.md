The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs, Batten disease) are a group of 
inherited childhood-onset neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the 
lysosomal accumulation of undigested material within cells. To understand this 
dysfunction, we analysed trafficking of the cation-independent mannose 
6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), which delivers the digestive enzymes to 
lysosomes. A common form of NCL is caused by mutations in CLN3, a multipass 
transmembrane protein of unknown function. We report that ablation of CLN3 
causes accumulation of CI-MPR in the trans Golgi network, reflecting a 50% 
reduction in exit. This CI-MPR trafficking defect is accompanied by a fall in 
maturation and cellular activity of lysosomal cathepsins. CLN3 is therefore 
essential for trafficking along the route needed for delivery of lysosomal 
enzymes, and its loss thereby contributes to and may explain the lysosomal 
dysfunction underlying Batten disease.
