BACKGROUND: Mutations in the nuclear-encoded subunits of complex I of the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain are a recognized cause of Leigh syndrome (LS). 
Recently, 6 mutations in the NDUFS1 gene were identified in 3 families.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a Spanish family with LS, complex I deficiency in muscle, 
and a novel mutation in the NDUFS1 gene.
DESIGN: Using molecular genetic approaches, we identified the underlying 
molecular defect in a patient with LS with a complex I defect.
PATIENT: The proband was a child who displayed the clinical features of LS.
RESULTS: Muscle biochemistry results showed a complex I defect of the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain. Sequencing analysis of the mitochondrial 
DNA-encoded ND genes, the nuclear DNA-encoded NDUFV1, NDUFS1, NDUFS2, NDUFS4, 
NDUFS6, NDUFS7, NDUFS8, and NDUFAB1 genes, and the complex I assembly factor 
CIA30 gene revealed a novel homozygous L231V mutation (c.691C-->G) in the NDUFS1 
gene. The parents were heterozygous carriers of the L231V mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying nuclear mutations as a cause of respiratory chain 
disorders will enhance the possibility of prenatal diagnosis and help us 
understand how molecular defects can lead to complex I deficiency.
