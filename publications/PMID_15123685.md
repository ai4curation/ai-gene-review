The selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase regulates redox-sensitive proteins 
involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis, including ribonucleotide reductase, 
p53, NFkappaB, and others. Little is known about endogenous cellular factors 
that modulate thioredoxin reductase activity. Here we report that several 
metabolites of 15-lipoxygenase-1 inhibit purified thioredoxin reductase in 
vitro. 15(S)-Hydroperoxy-5,8,11-cis-13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid, a metastable 
hydroperoxide generated by 15-lipoxygenase-1, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, its 
non-enzymatic rearrangement product inhibit thioredoxin reductase with IC(50) = 
13 +/- 1.5 microm and 1 +/- 0.2 microm, respectively. Endogenously generated 
metabolites of 15-lipoxygenase-1 also inhibit thioredoxin reductase in HEK-293 
cells that harbor a 15-LOX-1 gene under the control of an inducible promoter 
complex. Conditional, highly selective induction of 15-lipoxygenase-1 caused an 
inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity, cell cycle arrest in G(1), 
impairment of anchorage-independent growth, and accumulation of the 
pro-apoptotic protein BAX. All of these responses are consistent with inhibition 
of thioredoxin reductase via 15-lipoxygenase-1 overexpression. In contrast, 
metabolites of 5-lipoxygenase were poor inhibitors of isolated thioredoxin 
reductase, and the overexpression of 5-lipoxygenase did not inhibit thioredoxin 
reductase or cause a G cell cycle arrest. The influences of 15-lipoxygenase-1 on 
(1)inflammation, cell growth, and survival may be attributable, in part, to 
inhibition of thioredoxin reductase and several redox-sensitive processes 
subordinate to thioredoxin reductase.
