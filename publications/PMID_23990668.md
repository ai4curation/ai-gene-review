BACKGROUND: Cell migration is a critical determinant of cancer metastasis, and a 
better understanding of the genes involved will lead to the identification of 
novel targets aimed at preventing cancer dissemination. KIAA1199 has been shown 
to be upregulated in human cancers, yet its role in cancer progression was 
hitherto unknown.
METHODS: Clinical relevance was assessed by examining KIAA1199 expression in 
human cancer specimens. In vitro and in vivo studies were employed to determine 
the function of KIAA1199 in cancer progression. Cellular localization of 
KIAA1199 was microscopically determined. SNAP-tag pull-down assays were used to 
identify binding partner(s) of KIAA1199. Calcium levels were evaluated using 
spectrofluorometric and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses. 
Signaling pathways were dissected by Western blotting. Student t test was used 
to assess differences. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: KIAA1199 was upregulated in invasive breast cancer specimens and 
inversely associated with patient survival rate. Silencing of KIAA1199 in 
MDA-MB-435 cancer cells resulted in a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition that 
reduced cell migratory ability in vitro (75% reduction; P < .001) and decreased 
metastasis in vivo (80% reduction; P < .001). Gain-of-function assays further 
demonstrated the role of KIAA1199 in cell migration. KIAA1199-enhanced cell 
migration required endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization, where it forms a 
stable complex with the chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). A novel 
ER-retention motif within KIAA1199 that is required for its ER localization, BiP 
interaction, and enhanced cell migration was identified. Mechanistically, 
KIAA1199 was found to mediate ER calcium leakage, and the resultant increase in 
cytosolic calcium ultimately led to protein kinase C alpha activation and cell 
migration.
CONCLUSIONS: KIAA1199 serves as a novel cell migration-promoting gene and plays 
a critical role in maintaining cancer mesenchymal status.

Methods

Clinical relevance was assessed by examining KIAA1199 expression in human cancer specimens. In vitro and in vivo studies were employed to determine the function of KIAA1199 in cancer progression. Cellular localization of KIAA1199 was microscopically determined. SNAP-tag pull-down assays were used to identify binding partner(s) of KIAA1199. Calcium levels were evaluated using spectrofluorometric and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses. Signaling pathways were dissected by Western blotting. Student t test was used to assess differences. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

KIAA1199 was upregulated in invasive breast cancer specimens and inversely associated with patient survival rate. Silencing of KIAA1199 in MDA-MB-435 cancer cells resulted in a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition that reduced cell migratory ability in vitro (75% reduction; P < .001) and decreased metastasis in vivo (80% reduction; P < .001). Gain-of-function assays further demonstrated the role of KIAA1199 in cell migration. KIAA1199-enhanced cell migration required endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization, where it forms a stable complex with the chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). A novel ER-retention motif within KIAA1199 that is required for its ER localization, BiP interaction, and enhanced cell migration was identified. Mechanistically, KIAA1199 was found to mediate ER calcium leakage, and the resultant increase in cytosolic calcium ultimately led to protein kinase C alpha activation and cell migration.

Conclusions

KIAA1199 serves as a novel cell migration–promoting gene and plays a critical role in maintaining cancer mesenchymal status.

Discussion

Before this work, the only studies on KIAA1199 were in regard to its upregulation in various forms of cancer. However, the pathological consequences of this upregulation were unknown. The key findings reported here are the unveiling of the pathological role of KIAA1199 in cancer cell migration and the elucidation of the signaling pathway downstream of KIAA1199. We show that elevated levels of KIAA1199 are exhibited in both invasive human cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KIAA1199 induces cancer cell migration by a BiP–Ca 2+ –PKCα cascade. In vivo analysis links the role of KIAA1199 in cell migration to cancer dissemination, as cell migration is one of the critical determinants of metastasis. Hence, this study establishes KIAA1199 as both a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and target for cancer therapy aimed at preventing metastasis.

Our studies link KIAA1199 expression to cell migration and invasion based on the reversal of EMT upon silencing of endogenous KIAA1199 in invasive cancer cells. Subsequent studies showed that overexpression of KIAA1199 causes an EMT, leading to an increased migratory capacity of nonaggressive cancer cells. Multiple cell lines in loss- or gain-of-function studies were employed to validate these observations. Interestingly, knockdown of KIAA1199 inhibited both primary tumor growth and metastasis in a spontaneous metastasis mouse model without affecting cell proliferation in vitro. It is generally accepted that metastasis correlates closely with tumor burden ( 29 ), which is supported by the finding that inhibition of primary tumor growth often delays spontaneous metastasis ( 30 ). Based on our study, we speculate that a collaborative effort between reduced cell migration and subsequent decreased primary tumor growth contributes to reduced lung metastasis in mice bearing KIAA1199-silenced tumor cells. To precisely investigate the association of KIAA1199-mediated cell migration with metastasis, an in vivo experimental metastasis model was employed that demonstrated diminished lung metastasis in mice intravenously injected with KIAA1199-silenced cancer cells exhibiting impaired cell migration. This observation is consistent with the concept that both increased proteolytic activity and cell migratory ability are required for cancer invasion and blocking either biological role can reduce cancer invasion and metastasis.

Our study demonstrates that ER localization of KIAA1199 is a prerequisite for enhanced cell migration because loss of ER retention results in abrogation of cell migration. KIAA1199 has previously been reported to be localized primarily in the cytoplasm of cells ( 6–8 ), although nuclear localization has been reported in colon adenocarcinomas ( 31 ). Nevertheless, detailed cellular distribution has not been previously reported. Here we have demonstrated for the first time that both endogenous and exogenous KIAA1199 are localized in the ER, which requires a special motif (the B-domain) rather than the conventional ER retention signals. Additional data suggest that cooperation of this motif with other KIAA1199 domains is required for cell migration.

Further characterization reveals that KIAA1199 interacts with BiP by the B-domain to remain in the ER. We provide evidence to suggest a functional interaction between KIAA1199 and BiP: 1) deletion of the B-domain results in loss of interaction with BiP, KIAA1199 ER-retention, and inhibition of cell migration; and 2) silencing of BiP results in reduced KIAA1199-mediated cell migration. Collectively, our data indicate that the KIAA1199–BiP interaction is a specific cellular event required for ER retention and subsequent KIAA1199-mediated cell migration. Although the exact role of this interaction in KIAA1199-mediated cancer cell migration will require further study, BiP has been shown to negatively correlate with patient survival, and silencing of BiP has been shown to abrogate gastraic and head and neck cancer cell invasion ( 23 , 32 ).

The mechanism underlying KIAA1199-mediated cell migration relies on ER Ca 2+ leakage followed by PKCα activation. Because of calcium’s involvement in numerous cellular processes, including development, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and motility ( 33 ), it is strictly maintained within the cell, with the ER serving as the major storage site ( 34 ). A rise in intracellular Ca 2+ has been shown to lead to activation of various signaling cascades, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PKC, and integrin signaling, all of which play roles in cell movement ( 35 ). Our study demonstrates a requirement for KIAA1199-induced cytosolic Ca 2+ accumulation in cell migration. Although the exact mechanism of KIAA1199-induced ER Ca 2+ release needs further elucidation, recent studies have reported proteins capable of causing changes in steady-state Ca 2+ levels, including Bcl-2 and Presenilin ( 36 , 37 ). Of particular interest is another KIAA protein, known as Fam38A or KIAA0233, that is also localized to the ER. Fam38A has been shown to mediate cell adhesion by a pathway that requires increased release of calcium, resulting in downstream signaling that ultimately leads to integrin activation ( 38 ). Furthermore, elevated cytosolic Ca 2+ has been shown to result in increased migration by PKC activation ( 35 ). These findings are in agreement with our data demonstrating involvement of PKCα downstream of Ca 2+ signaling in KIAA1199-mediated cell migration. Additionally, PKCα has been shown to be involved in cancer cell motility and invasion, and it has been correlated with aggressiveness ( 39 ).

Although our study links KIAA1199 to enhanced cancer cell migration, it seems likely that there is not a unique route through which tumor cells gain the capacity to migrate. Pinpointing the requirement for KIAA1199 in the complicated signaling network involved in cancer cell migration will determine whether KIAA1199 is a key druggable target in prevention of cancer metastasis. One of the limitations of this study is the lack of a deep understanding of the minimal binding motif of KIAA1199 required for the BiP interaction. Although we identified a region within KIAA1199 that is required for this interaction and retention within the ER, further characterization of this minimal motif can potentially provide a novel treatment strategy aimed at blocking KIAA1199-mediated cell migration. Another limitation of this study is the cell line used in the animal models. Although the role of KIAA1199 has been validated in different cell lines using various in vitro models, only MDA-MB-435 cells have been examined in spontaneous and experimental metastasis mouse models. Because the origin of MDA-MB-435 cells is still debatable, additional in vivo studies using cell lines from other cancer types may strengthen our observations and ensure that the role of KIAA1199 described here is applicable to other cancer cell types. The lack of a knockout mouse model, which would allow for further testing of the physiological role of KIAA1199, is an additional limitation of this study. Nonetheless, this study widens our understanding of cancer cell migration and provides a novel target for preventing cancer invasion and metastasis. Overall, our observations have reinforced the connections between KIAA1199, BiP, ER Ca 2+ leakage, and PKCα activation in KIAA1199-induced cell migration ( Figure 8 ). In addition, recently published data on KIAA1199 promoter regulation now provides insights into the mechanism of upregulation of KIAA1199 expression in human cancer by direct binding of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells to the KIAA1199 promoter ( 40 ). However, our understanding of other potential pathways involved in KIAA1199-mediated cell migration is far from complete. Further work will be required to understand the complete mechanistic basis of the effects we have observed. Given the long half-life of KIAA1199 and constant association with BiP, KIAA1199 may also function as part of an undiscovered BiP chaperoning complex, which we are currently investigating. Nonetheless, this study widens our understanding of cancer cell migration and provides a novel target for preventing metastasis. Our data demonstrate that alterations in KIAA1199 expression contribute to the loss of epithelial cell architecture and aggressiveness, making KIAA1199 a strong candidate for a bona fide human invasion-promoting gene.
