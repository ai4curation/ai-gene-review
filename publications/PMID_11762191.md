We identified and characterized the cDNA coding for human LANCL2, a new member 
of the eukaryotic LanC-like protein family which is related to the bacterial 
lanthionine synthetase components C (LanC). The composite nucleotide sequence 
revealed a coding region of 1353 bp, a 5'-UTR of 186 bp and a 3'-UTR of 2421 bp. 
The deduced sequence of 450 amino acids showed 57.9% identity (74.7% similarity) 
when compared with the human LANCL1 homologue. In contrast to LANCL1, a unique 
ATP/GTP-binding site motif A was found in LANCL2. Northern blot analysis 
revealed the presence of two major transcripts in the brain, 4.7 kb and 4.1 kb 
in size, and a major 1.8 kb transcript in testis. Accordingly, expression array 
analysis showed prominent signals in these tissues. Because of the structural 
similarity to LanC, we postulate that LANCL2 may play a role as a component of a 
peptide-modifying complex.
