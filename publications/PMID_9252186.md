Nuclear transcription factors of the NF-kappaB/Rel family are inhibited by 
IkappaB proteins, which inactivate NF-kappaB by trapping it in the cell 
cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of IkappaBs marks them out for destruction, thereby 
relieving their inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB. A cytokine-activated protein 
kinase complex, IKK (for IkappaB kinase), has now been purified that 
phosphorylates IkappaBs on the sites that trigger their degradation. A component 
of IKK was molecularly cloned and identified as a serine kinase. IKK turns out 
to be the long-sought-after protein kinase that mediates the critical regulatory 
step in NF-kappaB activation.
