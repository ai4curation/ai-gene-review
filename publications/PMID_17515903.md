BRCA2 has an essential function in DNA repair by homologous recombination, 
interacting with RAD51 via short motifs in the middle and at the C terminus of 
BRCA2. Here, we report that a conserved 36-residue sequence of human BRCA2 
encoded by exon 27 (BRCA2Exon27) interacts with RAD51 through the specific 
recognition of oligomerized RAD51 ATPase domains. BRCA2Exon27 binding stabilizes 
the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament against disassembly by BRC repeat 4. The 
protection is specific for RAD51 filaments formed on single-stranded DNA and is 
lost when BRCA2Exon27 is phosphorylated on Ser3291. We propose that productive 
recombination results from the functional balance between the different 
RAD51-binding modes [corrected] of the BRC repeat and exon 27 regions of BRCA2. 
Our results further suggest a mechanism in which CDK phosphorylation of 
BRCA2Exon27 at the G2-M transition alters the balance in favor of RAD51 filament 
disassembly, thus terminating recombination.

Abstract

BRCA2 is essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination via its interaction with RAD51, mediated by short motifs in the middle and at the C-terminus of its sequence. Here we report that a conserved 36-residue exon 27 sequence of human BRCA2 (BRCA2 Exon 27 ) interacts with RAD51 through the specific recognition of oligomerised RAD51 ATPase domains. BRCA2 Exon 27 binding stabilizes the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament against disassembly by BRC repeat 4. The protection is specific for RAD51 filaments formed on single-stranded DNA and is lost when BRCA2 Exon 27 is phosphorylated on Ser3291. We propose that productive recombination results from the functional balance between the different modes of interaction with RAD51 of the BRC repeat and exon 27 regions of BRCA2. Our results further suggest a mechanism whereby CDK phosphorylation of BRCA2 Exon 27 at the G 2 -M transition alters the balance in favor of RAD51 filament disassembly, thus terminating recombination.

DISCUSSION

The BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein contains two distinct regions, unrelated by amino acid sequence and distant in location, that possess the ability to bind RAD51. Whereas the interaction between RAD51 and the BRC repeat sequences in the central region of BRCA2 has been well characterized, much less is known about the mode of interaction of RAD51 with the C-terminal binding site coded within the exon 27 of BRCA2, BRCA2 Exon 27 . Here we have provided a first account of the mechanism by which BRCA2 Exon 27 interacts with RAD51. We find that a 36 amino-acid sequence within a highly conserved region of exon 27 specifically recognizes and interacts with RAD51 oligomers and RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments: unlike the BRC repeats, BRCA2 Exon 27 does not bind to a monomeric RAD51 mutant and is unable to interfere with the oligomeric state of RAD51. Furthermore, we show that the ATPase domain of RAD51 is sufficient for the interaction with BRCA2 Exon 27 , whereas the N-terminal domain is not required for binding. These observations can be integrated in a model in which BRCA2 Exon 27 occupies the groove formed by adjacent protomers of oligomeric RAD51 assemblies, making specific contacts with the ATPase domains of neighboring subunits. The observation that mutations of Ser3291 to alanine and glutamic acid abrogate RAD51 binding implicates the hydroxyl moiety of the serine in a crucial hydrogen bonding interaction, possibly required in order to maintain the exon 27 conformation necessary for RAD51 binding.

The conservative mode of RAD51 binding by BRCA2 Exon 27 contrasts with the ability of BRC repeats to disrupt RAD51 oligomers and nucleoprotein filaments through the formation of 1:1 BRC:RAD51 complexes 8 , 16 , 26 . Thus, BRCA2 can bind RAD51 in multiple ways: via the disruptive action of BRC repeats with a potential RAD51 remodeling function, through a non-disruptive association of the BRC repeats with RAD51 filaments, and via the conservative interaction of the exon 27 region that stabilizes the RAD51–ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. We have further defined a functional interplay between RAD51-binding modes by demonstrating that BRCA2 Exon 27 can protect RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments from disassembly by BRC repeats. The effect is specific to ssDNA as free RAD51 and RAD51 filaments formed on dsDNA experience no protection upon binding to BRCA2 Exon 27 . These observations suggest that once the BRC repeats have remodeled free oligomeric RAD51 into RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments, BRCA2 Exon 27 might stabilize and protect the filaments from subsequent BRC repeat-dependent disruption. Interestingly, whilst BRC repeats have been identified in BRCA2 molecules from a wide range of eukaryotes, the C-terminal RAD51-binding motif is specific to vertebrate BRCA2 sequences. It is possible that the BRCA2 Exon 27 sequence of vertebrate proteins might have evolved to protect RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments from the disruptive effects of their BRC repeats. In this respect, it will be interesting to compare the disruptive potency towards RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments of vertebrate BRC repeats with that of the single BRC repeat found in primitive BRCA2 proteins lacking the BRCA2 Exon 27 RAD51-binding motif.

Homologous recombination is active during the S- and G 2 -phases of the cell cycle and is terminated at the G 2 -M transition in order to prepare for cellular entry into mitosis. As phosphorylation of Ser3291 at the G 2 -M transition abrogates the ability of BRCA2 Exon 27 to bind RAD51, it has been proposed that this phosphorylation event is in part responsible for terminating recombination prior to mitosis 28 . Here, we present a mechanistic explanation for this observation. It has previously been reported that BRC repeats may interact with RAD51 in ways that can interfere or be compatible with its oligomeric state, and that both binding modes are likely to be relevant to recombination-mediated repair. Within the context of the housing exon 11 sequence, BRCA2 BRC1-8 can stimulate strand exchange through a direct association with the RAD51 filament 11 . However, when present in excess, individual BRC repeats 16 , 27 and the BRCA2 BRC1-8 region (ORD & LP, unpublished observations) can disrupt RAD51 filaments. Remodeling cellular RAD51 into nucleoprotein filaments likely represents an important function of the BRC repeats, but it also raises the possibility that the BRC repeats may inadvertently disrupt RAD51 filaments that are engaged in repair. This highlights a requirement for a cellular mechanism that permits remodeling of free oligomeric RAD51 at the onset of repair, but protects established RAD51 filaments during active repair. The work presented here suggests that the exon 27 region of BRCA2 may fulfill such protective function: we find that BRCA2 Exon 27 exercises a specific stabilizing effect on RAD51–ssDNA filaments against interference from BRC repeats. At the G 2 -M transition, CDK phosphorylation removes the ability of BRCA2 Exon 27 to preserve the integrity of RAD51–ssDNA filaments from BRC repeat-dependent depolymerisation. We propose that this shift in balance between the disruptive and protective functions of BRCA2 induces filament disassembly upon cellular entry into mitosis, thus terminating recombination.
