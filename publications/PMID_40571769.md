Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are a hallmark of inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) and constitute a major mechanism of epithelial cell death. 
Approaches to broadly inhibit ROS have had limited efficacy in treating IBD. 
Here we show that lipid peroxidation contributes to the pathophysiology of IBD 
by promoting ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death. 
Mechanistically, we provide evidence of heterocellular crosstalk between 
intestinal fibroblasts and epithelial cells. In IBD tissues and mouse models of 
chronic colitis, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family 4 (ACSL4) is 
overexpressed in fibroblasts. ACSL4 in fibroblasts reprograms lipid metabolism 
and mediates intestinal epithelial cell sensitivity to ferroptosis. In mouse 
models, overexpressing ACSL4 in fibroblasts results in increased intestinal 
epithelial ferroptosis and worsened colitis, while pharmacological inhibition or 
deletion of fibroblast ACSL4 ameliorates colitis. Our work provides a targeted 
approach to therapeutic antioxidant treatments for IBD.
