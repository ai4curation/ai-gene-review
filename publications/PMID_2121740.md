## Abstract

1. J Cell Biol. 1990 Nov;111(5 Pt 1):1741-51. doi: 10.1083/jcb.111.5.1741.

SSB-1 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a nucleolar-specific, 
silver-binding protein that is associated with the snR10 and snR11 small nuclear 
RNAs.

SSB-1, the yeast single-strand RNA-binding protein, is demonstrated to be a 
yeast nucleolar-specific, silver-binding protein. In double-label 
immunofluorescence microscopy experiments antibodies to two other nucleolar 
proteins, RNA Pol I 190-kD and fibrillarin, were used to reveal the site of rRNA 
transcription; i.e., the fibrillar region of the nucleolus. SSB-1 colocalized 
with fibrillarin in a double-label immunofluorescence mapping experiment to the 
yeast nucleolus. SSB-1 is located, though, over a wider region of the nucleolus 
than the transcription site marker. Immunoprecipitations of yeast cell extracts 
with the SSB-1 antibody reveal that in 150 mM NaCl SSB-1 is bound to two small 
nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). These yeast snRNAs are snR10 and snR11, with snR10 being 
predominant. Since snR10 has been implicated in pre-rRNA processing, the 
association of SSB-1 and snR10 into a nucleolar snRNP particle indicates SSB-1 
involvement in rRNA processing as well. Also, another yeast protein, SSB-36-kD, 
isolated by single-strand DNA chromatography, is shown to bind silver under the 
conditions used for nucleolar-specific staining. It is, most likely, another 
yeast nucleolar protein.
