Like other biological processes, aging is regulated by genetic pathways. 
However, it remains largely unknown whether aging is determined by an innate 
programmed timing mechanism and, if so, how this timer is linked to the 
mechanisms that control developmental timing. Here, we demonstrate that sea-2, 
which encodes a zinc-finger protein, controls developmental timing in C. elegans 
larvae by regulating expression of the heterochronic gene lin-28 at the 
post-transcriptional level. lin-28 is also essential for the autosomal signal 
element (ASE) function of sea-2 in X:A signal assessment. We also show that 
sea-2 modulates aging in adulthood. Loss of function of sea-2 slows the aging 
process and extends the adult lifespan in a DAF-16/FOXO-dependent manner. 
Mutation of sea-2 promotes nuclear translocation of DAF-16 and subsequent 
activation of daf-16 targets. We further demonstrate that insulin/IGF-1 
signaling functions in the larval heterochronic circuit. Loss of function of the 
insulin/IGF-1 receptor gene daf-2, which extends lifespan, also greatly enhances 
the retarded heterochronic defects in sea-2 mutants. Regulation of developmental 
timing by daf-2 requires daf-16 activity. Our study provides evidence for 
intricate interplay between the heterochronic circuit that controls 
developmental timing in larvae and the timing mechanism that modulates aging in 
adults.
