Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits avoidance behavior when presented with diverse 
bacterial pathogens. We hypothesized that exposure to pathogens might not only 
cause worms to move away but also simultaneously activate pathways that promote 
resistance to the pathogen. We show that brief exposure to virulent or avirulent 
strains of the bacterial pathogen enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) "immunizes"C. 
elegans to survive a subsequent exposure that would otherwise prove lethal, a 
phenomenon we refer to as "conditioning." Conditioning requires dopaminergic 
neurons; the p38 MAP kinase pathway, which regulates innate immunity; and the 
insulin/IGFR pathway, which regulates lifespan. Our findings suggest that the 
molecular pathways that control innate immunity and lifespan may be regulated or 
"conditioned" by exposure to pathogens to allow survival in noxious 
environments.
