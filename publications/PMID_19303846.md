The Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene is disrupted by a balanced 
chromosomal translocation (1; 11) (q42; q14.3) in a Scottish family with a high 
incidence of major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Subsequent 
studies provided indications that DISC1 plays a role in brain development. Here, 
we demonstrate that suppression of DISC1 expression reduces neural progenitor 
proliferation, leading to premature cell cycle exit and differentiation. Several 
lines of evidence suggest that DISC1 mediates this function by regulating 
GSK3beta. First, DISC1 inhibits GSK3beta activity through direct physical 
interaction, which reduces beta-catenin phosphorylation and stabilizes 
beta-catenin. Importantly, expression of stabilized beta-catenin overrides the 
impairment of progenitor proliferation caused by DISC1 loss of function. 
Furthermore, GSK3 inhibitors normalize progenitor proliferation and behavioral 
defects caused by DISC1 loss of function. Together, these results implicate 
DISC1 in GSK3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathways and provide a framework for 
understanding how alterations in this pathway may contribute to the etiology of 
psychiatric disorders.
