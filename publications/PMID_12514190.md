The full-length cDNA clone of a novel GRP78-binding protein (GBP) was isolated 
from rat brain using PCR-selected cDNA subtraction. GBP was predominantly 
expressed in neuronal cells among various brain tissues. GBP mRNA was already 
detected in the E12 brain and then gradually increased to reach a peak within 
P0-2 weeks after birth. GBP expression in the brain decreased age-dependently to 
approximately 30% of the postnatal level at 12 months. GBP encoded 1021 amino 
acids and was predicted to have two transmembrane regions and glutamic acid- and 
proline-rich regions. Because the sequence of GBP offered few clues to the 
possible function, we performed a GST-tagged GBP pull-down assay in PC12 lysates 
and identified GRP78, one of the heat shock proteins, as a counterpart. 
Observation of COS7 cells expressing green fluorescent protein- or Myc-tagged 
GBP showed that GBP was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi domain 
where BODIPY 558/568 
(4,4-difluro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3alpha,4alpha-diaza-S-indacene)-labeled 
brefeldin A accumulated. To investigate a biological role for GBP, we 
established Neuro2a cells stably expressing Myc-tagged GBP. Overexpression of 
GBP did not affect cell growth or morphological features but attenuated the 
time-dependent decrease in cell viability caused by serum deprivation compared 
with control cells. After 48 h of serum starvation, Neuro2a cells overexpressing 
GBP were resistant to the cell death induced by serum withdrawal. These results 
suggest that GBP would have a relevant functional role in embryonic and 
postnatal development of the brain.
