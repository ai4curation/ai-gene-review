Uridine-cytidine kinases (UCK) have important roles for the phosphorylation of 
nucleoside analogs that are being investigated for possible use in chemotherapy 
of cancer. We have cloned the cDNA of two human UCKs. The approximately 30-kDa 
proteins, named UCK1 and UCK2, were expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to 
catalyze the phosphorylation of Urd and Cyd. The enzymes did not phosphorylate 
deoxyribonucleosides or purine ribonucleosides. UCK1 mRNA was detected as two 
isoforms of approximately 1.8 and approximately 2.7 kb. The 2.7-kb band was 
ubiquitously expressed in the investigated tissues. The band of approximately 
1.8 kb was present in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and kidney. The two 
isoforms of UCK2 mRNA of 1.2 and 2.0 kb were only detected in placenta among the 
investigated tissues. The genes encoding UCK1 and UCK2 were mapped to chromosome 
9q34.2-9q34.3 and 1q22-1q23.2, respectively. We tested 28 cytidine and uridine 
nucleoside analogs as possible substrates of the enzymes. The enzymes 
phosphorylated several of the analogs, such as 6-azauridine, 5-fluorouridine, 
4-thiouridine, 5-bromouridine, N(4)-acetylcytidine, N(4)-benzoylcytidine, 
5-fluorocytidine, 2-thiocytidine, 5-methylcytidine, and N(4)-anisoylcytidine. 
The cloning and recombinant expression of the two human UCKs will be important 
for development of novel pyrimidine ribonucleoside analogs and the 
characterization of their pharmacological activation.
