The Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 (DSL) domain-containing proteins, Delta1, Jagged1, and 
Jagged2, are considered to be ligands for Notch receptors. However, the physical 
interaction between the three DSL proteins and respective Notch receptors 
remained largely unknown. In this study, we investigated this issue through the 
targeting of Notch1 and Notch3 in two experimental systems using fusion proteins 
comprising their extracellular portions. Cell-binding assays showed that soluble 
forms of Notch1 and Notch3 proteins physically bound to the three DSL proteins 
on the cell surface. In solid-phase binding assays using immobilized soluble 
Notch1 and Notch3 proteins, it was revealed that each DSL protein directly bound 
to the soluble Notch proteins with different affinities. All interactions 
between the DSL proteins and soluble Notch proteins were dependent on Ca(2+). 
Taken together, these results suggest that Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2 are 
ligands for Notch1 and Notch3 receptors.
