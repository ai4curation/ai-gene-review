Thrombospondin-1 regulates nitric oxide (NO) signaling in vascular cells via 
CD47. Because CD47 binding motifs are conserved in the C-terminal signature 
domains of all five thrombospondins and indirect evidence has implied CD47 
interactions with other family members, we compared activities of recombinant 
signature domains of thrombospondin-1, -2, and -4 to interact with CD47 and 
modulate cGMP signaling. Signature domains of thrombospondin-2 and -4 were less 
active than that of thrombospondin-1 for inhibiting binding of radiolabeled 
signature domain of thrombospondin-1 or SIRPalpha (signal-regulatory protein) to 
cells expressing CD47. Consistent with this binding selectivity, the signature 
domain of thrombospondin-1 was more potent than those of thrombospondin-2 or -4 
for inhibiting NO-stimulated cGMP synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells and 
downstream effects on cell adhesion. In contrast to thrombospondin-1- and 
CD47-null cells, primary vascular cells from thrombospondin-2-null mice lack 
enhanced basal and NO-stimulated cGMP signaling. Effects of endogenous 
thrombospondin-2 on NO/cGMP signaling could be detected only in 
thrombospondin-1-null cells. Furthermore, tissue survival of ischemic injury and 
acute recovery of blood flow in thrombospondin-2-nulls resembles that of wild 
type mice. Therefore, thrombospondin-1 is the dominant regulator of NO/cGMP 
signaling via CD47, and its limiting role in acute ischemic injury responses is 
not shared by thrombospondin-2.

RESULTS

Selective Binding of the Signature Domain of TSP1 to CD47-expressing
 Cells —Because others have failed to detect TSP1 binding to a
 recombinant extracellular domain of CD47
 ( 22 ), we chose to examine TSP1
 binding to native CD47 using a cell binding assay. TSP1 engages multiple cell
 surface receptors, and high affinity binding via the N domain to heparan
 sulfate proteoglycans is typically dominant in such cell binding studies
 ( 31 ). To detect CD47 binding,
 therefore, we used a recombinant signature domain of TSP1 that is known to
 mediate CD47-dependent signaling but lacks the high affinity heparin-binding
 site ( Fig. 1 A ). The
 only other cell surface receptors known to interact with this domain are
 α v β 3 integrin, which is not expressed in
 Jurkat T lymphoma cells ( 32 ),
 and β 1 integrins, which interact with low affinity with the
 E123 domain ( 33 ). In Jurkat
 cells, β 1 integrin interaction with this domain of TSP1
 requires activating signals that were not present in these studies. Jurkat
 cells were also chosen for the binding studies based on their well
 characterized CD47-mediated responses to TSP1
 ( 32 ) and the availability of a
 somatic mutant of the Jurkat line lacking CD47 (JinB8)
 ( 24 ).

125 I-Labeled E123CaG1 bound at much higher levels to wild type
 Jurkat cells than to CD47-negative JinB8 cells
 ( Fig. 1 B ).
 Furthermore, binding to Jurkat cells expressing CD47 was inhibited to
 background levels in a dose-dependent manner by the function-blocking CD47
 antibody B6H12 ( Fig.
 1 C ). An isotype-matched control IgG 1 did not
 significantly inhibit binding of E123CaG1 at the same concentrations. Binding
 was also significantly inhibited by the TSP1-derived CD47 binding peptide 1102 FIRVVMYEGKK 1112 (7N3) at 1 μ m ( p = 0.02) but not by the respective control peptide FIRGGMYEGKK
 (604, Fig. 1 D ).

Specific binding of 125 I-E123CaG1 to Jurkat cells was inhibited
 in the presence of 22 p m TSP1
 ( Fig. 1 B ), consistent
 with the known potency of TSP1 for inhibiting NO/cGMP signaling via CD47
 ( 5 ). Unlabeled E123CaG1 was
 similarly active for self-inhibition of labeled ligand binding to Jurkat cells
 ( Fig. 1 E ). In
 contrast, the corresponding signature domain of TSP2 (E123CaG2) was inactive
 over the same concentration range, and although the signature domain of TSP4
 (E1234CaG4) produced consistent inhibition, the changes did not achieve
 significance ( Fig.
 1 E ). Therefore, high affinity interaction with CD47
 appears to be relatively specific for the signature domain of TSP1.

Selective Inhibition by TSP1 of SIRP α Binding to Cell
 Surface CD47 —We were concerned that the relatively high
 non-displaceable fraction of E123CaG1 binding in Fig. 1 could reflect residual
 interactions with other TSP1 receptors. Therefore, competition with the well
 characterized CD47 ligand SIRPα
 ( 34 ) was used to further
 assess TSP1 binding to cell surface CD47. TSP1 potently and dose-dependently
 inhibited 125 I-SIRPα binding to Jurkat cells
 ( Fig. 2 A ). Analysis of
 the binding data using Scafit (Version 2.4 of Ligand software
 ( 35 )) gave an apparent
 dissociation constant for TSP1 of 12 p m with a B max of
 ∼5000 sites/cell ( Fig.
 2 A , inset ). The latter value is consistent with
 the known copy numbers for CD47 on other cell lines
 ( 36 ). The apparent K d is consistent with the known potency of TSP1 for
 inhibiting cGMP signaling, but we caution that this number is dependent on
 assumptions used in the analysis and does not represent an intrinsic
 dissociation constant.

The requirement of CD47 for this interaction was confirmed by complete
 inhibition of 125 I-SIRPα binding to Jurkat cells in the
 presence of the CD47 blocking antibody B6H12 and the absence of 125 I-SIRPα binding to CD47-negative JinB8 cells
 ( Fig. 2 B ). The dose
 dependence for B6H12 inhibition of SIRPα binding paralleled that for
 inhibiting E123CaG1 binding (compare Figs. 2 C and 1 C ), and an
 isotype-matched control IgG 1 did not significantly inhibit binding
 of SIRPα to wild type Jurkat cells
 ( Fig. 2 C ).

E123CaG1 showed a similar dose dependence for inhibiting SIRPα
 binding to Jurkat cells as intact TSP1, but the corresponding signature
 domains of TSP2 (E123CaG2) and TSP4 (E1234CaG4) were essentially inactive
 ( Fig. 2 D ). This
 confirmed the relative specificity of CD47 for TSP1 and also established that
 TSP1 binding to CD47 can prevent interaction with its counter-receptor
 SIRPα. This has been hypothesized to occur in smooth muscle cells based
 on reduced co-immunoprecipitation of SIRPα with CD47 in the presence of
 TSP1 ( 37 ), but here is the
 first direct proof that such inhibition occurs at the level of
 SIRPα-CD47 binding.

Differential Effects of TSPs on NO-driven cGMP in Porcine
 VSMC —As previously reported for human VSMC
 ( 5 ), pretreatment of porcine
 VSMC with the full-length signature domain of TSP1 (E123CaG1) before exposure
 to the rapidly releasing NO donor DEA/NO at 10 μ m to activate
 sGC potently inhibited NO-stimulated cGMP accumulation in VSMC
 ( Fig. 3 A ). The
 corresponding signature domains of TSP2 and TSP4 and a trimeric N-terminal
 region of TSP1 did not show significant inhibition under the same conditions
 ( Fig. 3 A ). Decreasing
 the NO donor concentration to 1 μ m , however, increased the
 sensitivity to inhibition by E123CaG1, and E123CaG2 and E1234CaG4 showed
 significant inhibition of cGMP levels under these conditions
 ( Fig. 3 B ). The
 relative inhibitory potencies E123CaG1 > E1234CaG4 > E123CaG2 are
 consistent with their respective CD47 binding activities in Fig. 1 E .

A truncated construct CaG1 retained inhibitory activity, showing that the
 epidermal growth factor repeats of TSP1 are not required for activity
 ( Fig. 3 C ). Consistent
 with the lesser activity of the full-length TSP2 signature domain, CaG2
 retained activity but was less active than CaG1. However, the isolated calcium
 wire (Ca1) only marginally changed cGMP levels, consistent with our previous
 report that bacterially expressed recombinant G 1 is sufficient to
 inhibit NO-stimulated cGMP synthesis
 ( 5 ).

Because a polymorphism in the signature domain of TSP4 is associated with
 premature coronary artery disease
 ( 16 ), we also compared
 signature domains containing the normal sequence and the A387P variant for
 inhibiting cGMP signaling in porcine VSMC
 ( Fig. 3 D ). No
 significant difference in inhibitory activity was noted for this variant,
 indicating that both variants can signal through CD47.

NO-stimulated VSMC Adhesion on Type I Collagen Is Selectively Blocked
 by the Signature Domain of TSP1 —As previously reported
 ( 3 ), human aortic VSMC
 demonstrate enhanced adhesion to immobilized type I collagen in the presence
 of 10 μ m DEA/NO, and the signature domain of TSP1 potently
 inhibits this stimulation ( Fig.
 4 A ). In the absence of NO, VSMC adhesion to collagen was
 not significantly altered by recombinant signature domains of either TSP1 or
 TSP2 ( Fig. 4 B ).
 Similar to their effects on cGMP levels, signature domains of TSP2 and TSP4
 did not significantly inhibit NO-stimulated adhesion at a concentration
 sufficient for the corresponding domain of TSP1 to maximally inhibit this
 response ( Fig. 4 C ,
 p = 0.006).

Endogenous TSP2 Does Not Limit NO-driven cGMP Flux in Vascular
 Cells —The absence of either TSP1 or its receptor CD47 was
 previously shown to elevate basal and NO-stimulated cGMP levels in primary
 murine vascular cells ( 2 , 5 ). To assess whether
 endogenous TSP2 can significantly limit NO/cGMP signaling in vascular cells,
 wild type and TSP2-null lung-derived murine endothelial cells were treated
 with exogenous NO and cGMP levels assayed
 ( Fig. 5 A ). In
 untreated cells no difference was seen between wild type and TSP2-null cell
 cGMP levels. After NO treatment, cGMP levels were moderately but consistently
 lower in TSP2-null endothelial cells ( p < 0.05 in 3 independent
 experiments). NO/cGMP signaling also stimulates proliferation in these cells
 ( 2 ), but we observed no
 significant differences in basal or NO-stimulated proliferation between wild
 type and TSP2-null lung endothelial cells
 ( Fig. 5 B , p =
 0.38).

Although both of these results suggest that endogenous TSP2 expressed by
 vascular cells does not limit their sGC response to NO, it is possible that
 these cells do not express sufficient concentrations of TSP2 to limit this
 response. Quantitative real time RT-PCR confirmed expression of TSP2 mRNA in
 primary cultures of wild type lung endothelial cells, but the level was
 somewhat lower than that of TSP1 mRNA ( Fig.
 5 C ). Therefore, the endogenous TSP1 produced by these
 cells may mask any activity of the endogenous TSP2.

To more clearly define the ability of endogenous TSP2 to modulate cGMP
 signaling, we used primary TSP1-null vascular cells and employed an antisense
 morpholino to suppress TSP2 expression. In wild type primary cells,
 pretreatment with the morpholino had no significant effect on basal or
 NO-stimulated cGMP levels ( Fig.
 5 D ). However, pretreatment of primary TSP1-null
 endothelial cells with the TSP2 morpholino demonstrated increased
 intracellular cGMP after stimulation with exogenous NO compared with the
 response of cells treated with a 5-base mismatched control morpholino
 ( Fig. 5 D , p =
 0.02 and 0.08 in 2 independent experiments). A heparin capture enzyme-linked
 immunosorbent assay confirmed significant suppression of TSP2 secretion by the
 morpholino-treated cells that was lacking in cells treated with the mismatched
 control morpholino ( Fig.
 5 E ). Because we lack purified native TSP2 as a standard,
 it was not possible to quantify the extent of suppression. These data
 establish that endogenous TSP2 can limit NO/cGMP signaling, but this activity
 is normally masked by the greater activity of endogenous TSP1.

Ischemic Cutaneous Tissue Survival Is Not Limited by
 TSP2 —Although TSP2 only weakly limited cGMP signaling in lung
 endothelial cells in vitro , we wanted to determine whether endogenous
 TSP2 has any effect in vivo under ischemic stress conditions. We
 previously reported that endogenous TSP1 and CD47 limit ischemic tissue
 survival in dorsal random skin flaps in a C57BL/6 background
 ( 4 , 38 ). We found that wild type
 129SvJ/BL6 are more resistant to the dorsal flap injury than C57BL/6 mice but
 observed no difference between wild type and TSP2-null animals assessed 72 h
 post-operatively ( Fig.
 6 A ). Furthermore, the rate of acute decrease in flow in
 the ischemic flaps as assessed in the first 60 min after surgery using laser
 Doppler imaging did not differ between TSP2-null mice and their wild type
 controls ( Fig. 6 B ).
 Therefore, endogenous TSP2 does not acutely limit tissue perfusion under these
 conditions.

Hindlimb Perfusion under Ischemic Challenge Is Not Limited by
 TSP2 —Because mice in this background appear to be relatively
 resistant to skin flap ischemia, we turned to a more severe fixed ischemic
 injury model using femoral artery ligation of the hindlimb. A similar although
 not identical hindlimb model was recently shown to have moderately improved
 long term restoration of flow in the TSP2-null
 ( 39 ). Wild type and TSP2-null
 12-week-old male mice underwent ligation of the femoral artery. Laser Doppler
 analysis was then performed. During the first post-operative hour, both wild
 type and TSP2-null animals demonstrated profound decreases in hindlimb
 perfusion ( Fig. 7 A ).
 Analysis of hindlimb perfusion 72 h post-operatively demonstrated similar
 persistence in the perfusion defect in wild type and TSP2-null mice
 ( Fig. 7 B ), and
 clinical assessment indicated no acute advantage of the TSP2-null mouse in
 this ischemic injury model.

DISCUSSION

The present results establish that the signature domain of TSP1 is a ligand
 for cell surface CD47 and demonstrate more avid recognition by cell surface
 CD47 of the signature domain of TSP1 versus those of TSP2 and TSP4.
 The signature domain of TSP1 binds with high affinity only to CD47-positive T
 cells, and its binding is inhibited by a known CD47 blocking antibody. This
 selectivity correlates with stronger inhibition of NO/cGMP signaling by the
 signature domain of TSP1 and suggests a more potent activity of TSP1 as
 opposed to TSP2 or TSP4 for blocking NO-stimulated vascular cell responses and
 tissue perfusion and survival under ischemic challenge. Despite the similar
 activities of TSP1 and TSP2 for inhibiting tumor growth and tumor-driven
 angiogenesis ( 40 , 41 ), TSP1 more potently
 inhibits NO/cGMP signaling in vascular cells. Indeed, significant effects of
 endogenous TSP2 on NO/cGMP signaling in vascular cells can only be detected in
 TSP1-null cells. We have previously shown that TSP1 inhibits NO/cGMP signaling
 via CD36, which is also a TSP2 receptor
 ( 42 ), but only at nanomolar
 concentrations ( 6 ). Therefore,
 the selective interaction of TSP1 with CD47 rather than CD36 is critical for
 its potent inhibition of NO/cGMP signaling.

The differential activities of recombinant signature domains of TSP1 and
 TSP2 for binding to CD47 are reflected in the phenotypes of TSP1 and TSP2-null
 mice. Vascular cells and platelets lacking TSP1 demonstrate significant
 differences in both basal and NO-stimulated cGMP levels compared with cells
 that produce functional TSP1
 ( 2 , 3 , 43 ). In contrast vascular
 cells obtained from TSP2-null animals do not demonstrate differences in cGMP
 accumulation under either basal or NO-stimulated conditions.

Although initial studies clearly identified CD47 as a receptor for two
 synthetic peptides derived from the signature domain of TSP1
 ( 21 ), some recent publications
 have raised concerns about the relevance of such peptide binding to
 physiological TSP1 signaling through CD47. Independent studies have concluded
 that some signaling responses to such peptides can be CD47-independent
 ( 44 ). Although genetic
 evidence has established that CD47 is necessary for a number of signaling
 responses to TSP1 ( 5 , 32 , 44 ), direct binding of native
 TSP1 to this receptor has not previously been reported. Furthermore, surface
 plasmon resonance studies using a recombinant extracellular domain of CD47
 that was verified to bind to its other known ligand SIRPα failed to
 detect TSP1 binding ( 22 ). This
 could be interpreted as evidence that TSP1 does not directly bind to CD47, but
 the recombinant CD47 domain used may simply exist in a conformation that
 selectively precludes TSP1 binding. Recent computational modeling also
 suggests that CD47 binding may require a conformation change in TSP1
 ( 45 ). Our current data show
 that saturable binding of the signature domain of TSP1 to the surface of
 Jurkat cells requires CD47 and is inhibited by a function-blocking CD47
 antibody. Furthermore, binding of SIRPα to CD47 on the same cells is
 potently inhibited by TSP1. Therefore, it is clear that platelet TSP1 exists
 in a conformation that can bind to CD47 and does so via its signature domain.
 We further established that the G module is required for this interaction.

The weaker activity of signature domains from TSP2 and TSP4 to compete with
 that of TSP1 for binding to CD47 or to inhibit SIRPα binding suggests
 that conservation of VVM motifs is not sufficient for high affinity binding of
 other TSPs to CD47. Notably, we found that the CD47-binding peptide 7N3 does
 compete with the signature domain of TSP1 for binding to cell surface CD47,
 and disrupting the VVM motif in the peptide abolishes this activity. Although
 computational modeling suggests that the VVM could become exposed in intact
 TSP1 ( 45 ), other residues in
 this active peptide are exposed in the published crystal structure and may
 play more important roles in CD47 binding. We propose that mutating the VVM
 motif in the peptide 7N3 changes the conformation of these adjacent residues
 to prevent its binding to CD47.

Defining the CD47 binding site in the signature domain of TSP1 still
 requires further study. One necessary step will be to solve the structure of
 native CD47. The existing recombinant domains of CD47 may not be suitable for
 this purpose based on their failure to replicate the binding of TSP1 to native
 CD47 on the cell surface ( 22 ).
 Interactions with the membrane spanning domain of CD47 may alter the
 conformation of the extracellular domain to permit TSP1 binding. Indeed a
 disulfide bond connects the IgV domain to a cell surface loop of the
 transmembrane domain of CD47 in its native structure
 ( 46 ). An additional
 possibility is that specific interactions of CD47 with other proteins on the
 cell surface such as integrins may be required to enable high affinity TSP1
 binding.

In vivo , endogenous TSP1 continuously limits cGMP levels in
 vascular cells and thereby antagonizes NO to maintain blood pressure and
 platelet homeostasis. Consequently, TSP1-null animals demonstrate enhanced
 tissue perfusion and survival to various ischemic challenges compared with
 wild type animals due to enhanced NO/cGMP responses
 ( 4 , 38 , 43 ). In contrast, TSP2-null
 animals showed no tissue survival or perfusion advantage in the same ischemia
 models. TSP2 may play other roles in cardiovascular pathophysiology, but it
 does not play a major role in ischemic injury responses. Similarly, we
 recently showed that TSP2-null mice do not replicate the radioresistance
 phenotypes of TSP1- and CD47-null mice
 ( 47 ).

The weak activity of TSP2 to inhibit NO/cGMP signaling via CD47 may explain
 why TSP2-null animals respond so poorly to ischemic challenge. Strain-specific
 characteristics may account for some variation in responses to ischemia as the
 TSP1-null is in a C57Bl/6 background, whereas the TSP2-null is in a B6129sf1/J
 background. Nonetheless, despite the reported overall increase in vascular
 density in the TSP2-null basally and after wounding
 ( 48 ), these animals
 consistently showed no acute advantage in tissue perfusion and survival in two
 fixed ischemia models compared with their respective controls, and a modest
 long term advantage that was attributed to increased arteriogenesis and matrix
 remodeling in a third model employing hindlimb arteriectomy
 ( 39 ). In contrast, TSP1-null
 animals always show dramatic acute increases in tissue blood flow, perfusion,
 and survival compared with controls in ischemic stress models
 ( 4 , 7 , 38 , 43 ).

The dominant activity of TSP1 in blocking NO-driven sGC activation is
 particularly important as it is by sGC activation through cGMP that NO
 stimulates dephosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 to relax VSMC. These
 findings underscore the priority role TSP1 plays in regulating NO-driven
 responses in vascular cells and ischemic tissues. We caution that our results
 to not preclude roles of TSP2 and TSP4 in modulating NO/cGMP signaling via
 CD47 in other disease states. In tissues that express high levels of these
 TSPs, their weaker interactions with CD47 may be sufficient to inhibit NO/cGMP
 signaling. For example, TSP4 is highly expressed in heart
 ( 19 ), so it may significantly
 engage CD47 in that tissue.
