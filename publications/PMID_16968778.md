Innate immunity is an ancient and conserved defense mechanism. Although host 
responses toward various pathogens have been delineated, how these responses are 
orchestrated in a whole animal is less understood. Through an unbiased 
genome-wide study performed in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified a conserved 
function for endodermal GATA transcription factors in regulating local 
epithelial innate immune responses. Gene expression and functional RNAi-based 
analyses identified the tissue-specific GATA transcription factor ELT-2 as a 
major regulator of an early intestinal protective response to infection with the 
human bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the adult worm, ELT-2 is 
required specifically for infection responses and survival on pathogen but makes 
no significant contribution to gene expression associated with intestinal 
maintenance or to resistance to cadmium, heat, and oxidative stress. We further 
demonstrate that this function is conserved, because the human endodermal 
transcription factor GATA6 has a protective function in lung epithelial cells 
exposed to P. aeruginosa. These findings expand the repertoire of innate 
immunity mechanisms and illuminate a yet-unknown function of endodermal GATA 
proteins.
