BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for most cases of familial, early onset breast and/or 
ovarian cancer and encode products that each interact with hRAD51. Results 
presented here show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 coexist in a biochemical complex and 
colocalize in subnuclear foci in somatic cells and on the axial elements of 
developing synaptonemal complexes. Like BRCA1 and RAD51, BRCA2 relocates to 
PCNA+ replication sites following exposure of S phase cells to hydroxyurea or UV 
irradiation. Thus, BRCA1 and BRCA2 participate, together, in a pathway(s) 
associated with the activation of double-strand break repair and/or homologous 
recombination. Dysfunction of this pathway may be a general phenomenon in the 
majority of cases of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer.
