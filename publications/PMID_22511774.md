Lysosome-related organelles (LROs) are synthesized in specialized cell types 
where they largely coexist with conventional lysosomes. Most of the known 
cellular transport machinery involved in biogenesis are ubiquitously expressed 
and shared between lysosomes and LROs. Examples of common components are the 
adaptor protein complex-3 (AP-3) and biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle 
complex (BLOC)-2. These protein complexes control sorting and transport of newly 
synthesized integral membrane proteins from early endosomes to both lysosomes 
and LROs such as the melanosome. However, it is unknown what factors cooperate 
with the ubiquitous transport machinery to mediate transport to LROs in 
specialized cells. Focusing on the melanosome, we show that the ubiquitous 
machinery interacts with cell type-specific Rab proteins, Rab38 and Rab32, to 
facilitate transport to the maturing organelle. BLOC-2, AP-3, and AP-1 
coimmunoprecipitated with Rab38 and Rab32 from MNT-1 melanocytic cell extracts. 
BLOC-2, AP-3, AP-1, and clathrin partially colocalized with Rab38 and Rab32 by 
confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in MNT-1 cells. Rab38- and 
Rab32-deficient MNT-1 cells displayed abnormal trafficking and steady state 
levels of known cargoes of the BLOC-2, AP-3, and AP-1 pathways, the 
melanin-synthesizing enzymes tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1. These 
observations support the idea that Rab38 and Rab32 are the specific factors that 
direct the ubiquitous machinery to mediate transport from early endosomes to 
maturing LROs. Additionally, analysis of tyrosinase-related protein-2 and total 
melanin production indicates that Rab32 has unique functions that cannot be 
carried out by Rab38 in melanosome biogenesis.
