Gene targeting techniques and early mouse embryos have been used to produce 
immortalized fibroblasts genetically deficient in phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma1, 
a ubiquitous tyrosine kinase substrate. Plcg1(-/-) embryos die at embryonic day 
9; however, cells derived from these embryos proliferate as well as cells from 
Plcg1(+/+) embryos. The null cells do grow to a higher saturation density in 
serum-containing media, as their capacity to spread out is decreased compared 
with that of wild-type cells. In terms of epidermal growth factor receptor 
activation and internalization, or growth factor induction of mitogen-activated 
protein kinase, c-fos, or DNA synthesis in quiescent cells, PLcg1(-/-) cells 
respond equivalently to PLcg1(+/+) cells. Also, null cells are able to migrate 
effectively in a wounded monolayer. Therefore, immortalized fibroblasts do not 
require PLC-gamma1 for many responses to growth factors.
