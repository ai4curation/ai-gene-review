## Full Text

The purpose of this research was to investigate the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions as the primary binder liquid in a 2-step agglomeration process performed in a rotary processor and characterize the resulting granules and their tableting characteristics. This was done by granulation of binary mixtures of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and either lactose, calcium phosphate, acetaminophen, or theophylline, in a 1âˆ¶3 ratio, using a 50% (wt/wt) aqueous solution of PEG and water as the binder liquid. Formulations containing lactose were agglomerated using 5 different amounts of the PEG binder solution, giving rise to a PEG content in the range of 6% to 43% (wt/wt). The process outcome was characterized according to adhesion, yield, and water requirement, and the prepared granules were characterized according to size, size distribution, and flow properties as well as tableting properties. The agglomeration of all mixtures resulted in high yields of free-flowing agglomerates and gave rise to good reproducibility of the investigated agglomerate characteristics. The process allowed for the incorporation of 42.5% (wt/wt) PEG, which is higher than the percentage of PEG reported for other equipment. Tables of sufficient strength could be prepared with all investigated excipients using 20% wt/wt PEG; higher PEG contents gave rise to adhesion and prolonged disintegration. In conclusion, agglomeration in a torque-controlled rotary processor using solutions of PEG as the primary binder liquid was found to be a robust process, suitable for the incorporation of high contents of PEG and/or drug compounds.
