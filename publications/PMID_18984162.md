Tumor cells exhibit two different modes of individual cell movement. 
Mesenchymal-type movement is characterized by an elongated cellular morphology 
and requires extracellular proteolysis. In amoeboid movement, cells have a 
rounded morphology, are less dependent on proteases, and require high Rho-kinase 
signaling to drive elevated levels of actomyosin contractility. These two modes 
of cell movement are interconvertible. We show that mesenchymal-type movement in 
melanoma cells is driven by activation of the GTPase Rac through a complex 
containing NEDD9, a recently identified melanoma metastasis gene, and DOCK3, a 
Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Rac signals through WAVE2 to direct 
mesenchymal movement and suppress amoeboid movement through decreasing 
actomyosin contractility. Conversely, in amoeboid movement, Rho-kinase signaling 
activates a Rac GAP, ARHGAP22, that suppresses mesenchymal movement by 
inactivating Rac. We demonstrate tight interplay between Rho and Rac in 
determining different modes of tumor cell movement, revealing how tumor cells 
switch between different modes of movement.
