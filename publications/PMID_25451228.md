Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an anti-apoptotic protein, is overexpressed in many 
tumors and enhances tumorigenesis and chemo-resistance. However, the regulation 
mechanism controlling the sCLU maturation process or activity remains 
undetermined. In this study, we found PACAP as a negative regulator of CLU. 
Overexpression of the PACAP gene in cervical cancer cell lines lacking PACAP 
expression significantly inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis. We further 
demonstrated that interaction of PACAP with CLU significantly downregulated CLU 
expression and secretion, inhibited the Akt-Raf-ERK pathway, and suppressed the 
growth of human tumor xenografts in nude mice. This novel inhibitory function of 
PACAP may be applicable for developing novel molecular therapies for tumors with 
increased sCLU expression.
