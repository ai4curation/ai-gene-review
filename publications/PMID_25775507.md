c-Myc protein stability and activity are tightly regulated by the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system. Aberrant stabilization of c-Myc contributes to many 
human cancers. c-Myc is ubiquitinated by SCF(Fbw7) (a SKP1-cullin-1-F-box 
complex that contains the F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7, Fbw7, as the 
F-box protein) and several other ubiquitin ligases, whereas it is 
deubiquitinated and stabilized by ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) 28. The bulk 
of c-Myc degradation appears to occur in the nucleolus. However, whether c-Myc 
is regulated by deubiquitination in the nucleolus is not known. Here, we report 
that the nucleolar deubiquitinating enzyme USP36 is a novel c-Myc 
deubiquitinase. USP36 interacts with and deubiquitinates c-Myc in cells and in 
vitro, leading to the stabilization of c-Myc. This USP36 regulation of c-Myc 
occurs in the nucleolus. Interestingly, USP36 interacts with the nucleolar Fbw7γ 
but not the nucleoplasmic Fbw7α. However, it abolished c-Myc degradation 
mediated both by Fbw7γ and by Fbw7α. Consistently, knockdown of USP36 reduces 
the levels of c-Myc and suppresses cell proliferation. We further show that 
USP36 itself is a c-Myc target gene, suggesting that USP36 and c-Myc form a 
positive feedback regulatory loop. High expression levels of USP36 are found in 
a subset of human breast and lung cancers. Altogether, these results identified 
USP36 as a crucial and bono fide deubiquitinating enzyme controlling c-Myc's 
nucleolar degradation pathway.

Abstract

c-Myc protein stability and activity are tightly regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Aberrant stabilization of c-Myc contributes to many human cancers. c-Myc is ubiquitinated by SCF Fbw7 (a SKP1-cullin-1-F-box complex that contains the F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7, Fbw7, as the F-box protein) and several other ubiquitin ligases, whereas it is deubiquitinated and stabilized by ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) 28. The bulk of c-Myc degradation appears to occur in the nucleolus. However, whether c-Myc is regulated by deubiquitination in the nucleolus is not known. Here, we report that the nucleolar deubiquitinating enzyme USP36 is a novel c-Myc deubiquitinase. USP36 interacts with and deubiquitinates c-Myc in cells and in vitro, leading to the stabilization of c-Myc. This USP36 regulation of c-Myc occurs in the nucleolus. Interestingly, USP36 interacts with the nucleolar Fbw7γ but not the nucleoplasmic Fbw7α. However, it abolished c-Myc degradation mediated both by Fbw7γ and by Fbw7α. Consistently, knockdown of USP36 reduces the levels of c-Myc and suppresses cell proliferation. We further show that USP36 itself is a c-Myc target gene, suggesting that USP36 and c-Myc form a positive feedback regulatory loop. High expression levels of USP36 are found in a subset of human breast and lung cancers. Altogether, these results identified USP36 as a crucial and bono fide deubiquitinating enzyme controlling c-Myc’s nucleolar degradation pathway.

Discussion

Ubiquitination plays a key and complex role in the regulation of c-Myc protein turnover and activity. c-Myc is ubiquitinated by Fbw7γ in the nucleolus, where c-Myc is mainly degraded ( 12 , 23 , 24 ), but the nucleolus is also the site where c-Myc contributes to ribosomal biogenesis ( 3 ). Thus, the nucleolus plays a central role in regulating c-Myc levels and oncogenic activity. However, whether c-Myc stability can be regulated by deubiquitination in the nucleolus was not known. In this study, we identified USP36 as a novel nucleolar DUB for c-Myc, counteracting c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation in the nucleolus.

Materials and Methods

Cell lines were cultured and maintained as described in SI Materials and Methods . Flag-tagged USP36 (WT and the C131A mutant) plasmids and rabbit polyclonal anti-USP36 serum were previously described ( 28 , 29 ). Flag–Fbw7 plasmids were provided by B. E. Clurman (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA) ( 12 ). A detailed description of all other plasmids, i n vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays, RNA interference, IB, co-IP, ChIP, reverse transcriptase–quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), cell proliferation, cell fractionation, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, GST-fusion protein association, and soft agar assays can be found SI Materials and Methods .
