Mutations in TARDBP, encoding TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), are 
associated with TDP-43 proteinopathies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). We compared wild-type TDP-43 
and an ALS-associated mutant TDP-43 in vitro and in vivo. The A315T mutant 
enhances neurotoxicity and the formation of aberrant TDP-43 species, including 
protease-resistant fragments. The C terminus of TDP-43 shows sequence similarity 
to prion proteins. Synthetic peptides flanking residue 315 form amyloid fibrils 
in vitro and cause neuronal death in primary cultures. These data provide 
evidence for biochemical similarities between TDP-43 and prion proteins, raising 
the possibility that TDP-43 derivatives may cause spreading of the disease 
phenotype among neighboring neurons. Our work also suggests that decreasing the 
abundance of neurotoxic TDP-43 species, enhancing degradation or clearance of 
such TDP-43 derivatives and blocking the spread of the disease phenotype may 
have therapeutic potential for TDP-43 proteinopathies.
