lineage, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated in other myeloid precursor 
populations.

IFI 16 is an interferon-inducible nucleoprotein expressed by human monocytes. 
IFI 16 and a related mouse protein, p202, control cellular proliferation by 
binding and modulating the functions of cell cycle regulatory factors including 
p53 and the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb. In this study, we examined IFI 16 
expression in myeloid precursor cells cultured in vitro in colony-forming assays 
using granulocyte (G-) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-) colony-stimulating 
factor (CSF). IFI 16 was expressed in 100% of CD34+ cells isolated from human 
bone marrow. When the CD34+ cells were induced to differentiate, two 
sub-populations of cells were identified by two-color cytofluorography: the 
CD14+ (monocytoid) cells all expressed IFI 16, whereas the CD14- 
(polymorphonuclear precursor) cells did not. The strongest expression of IFI 16 
was in the cells staining brightest for CD14, whereas depletion of CD14+ 
monocytoid cells from mixed monocytic/granulocytic cultures largely abolished 
IFI 16-stained cells. Furthermore, in eight independent colony-forming assays, 
the number of IFI 16+ cells correlated closely with the numbers of monocyte 
precursors identified morphologically (R2 = 0.99), but was unrelated to the 
numbers of myelocytes, promyelocytes, and metamyelocytes; nor was IFI 16 
expressed by erythroid or eosinophil precursors. We conclude that IFI 16 is 
expressed in CD34+ and monocytoid daughter cells, but is rapidly and markedly 
down-regulated at the corresponding stages of polymorphonuclear and erythroid 
development. This differential expression of IFI 16 in myeloid precursor 
subpopulations and its perceived molecular properties are consistent with a 
possible role in regulating myelopoiesis.
