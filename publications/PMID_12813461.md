The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is critical for normal mammalian 
development, the specification of epidermal cells and neoplastic transformation 
of intestinal epithelium. However, precise molecular information regarding 
cell-specific responses to beta-catenin signaling has been limited. This 
question was addressed using a mouse model in which exon 3 of the beta-catenin 
gene was deleted in several cell types with loxP-mediated recombination 
utilizing a Cre transgene under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus-long 
terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR). The stabilization of beta-catenin in prostate 
epithelium resulted in hyperplasias and extensive transdifferentiation into 
epidermal-like structures, which expressed keratins 1 and 6, filaggrin, loricrin 
and involucrin. The cell-specific loss of NKCC1 protein and reduced nuclear 
Stat5a is further suggestive of a loss of prostate epithelial characteristics. 
In addition to the prostate, hyperplasias and squamous metaplasias were detected 
in epithelia of the epididymis, vas deferens, coagulating gland, preputial gland 
and salivary gland. However, and in contrast to a recent study, no lesions 
reminiscent of high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia were detected. 
Since beta-catenin was activated in several cell types and impinged upon the 
viability of these mice, it was not possible to evaluate the cumulative effect 
over more than 3 months. To assess long-term consequences of beta-catenin 
activation, mutant and control prostate tissues were transplanted into the 
mammary fat pads of wild-type males. Notably, squamous metaplasias, 
intra-acinous hyperplasia and possible neoplastic transformation were observed 
after a total of 18 weeks of beta-catenin stimulation. This suggests that the 
transdifferentiation into squamous metaplasias is an early response of 
endoderm-derived cells to beta-catenin, and that the development of 
intra-acinous hyperplasias or neoplastic foci is a later event.
