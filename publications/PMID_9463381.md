Bcl-2 and close homologues such as Bcl-xL promote cell survival, while other 
relatives such as Bax antagonize this function. Since only the pro-survival 
family members possess a conserved N-terminal region denoted BH4, we have 
explored the role of this amphipathic helix for their survival function and for 
interactions with several agonists of apoptosis, including Bax and CED-4, an 
essential regulator in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. BH4 of Bcl-2 could 
be replaced by that of Bcl-x without perturbing function but not by a somewhat 
similar region near the N-terminus of Bax. Bcl-2 cell survival activity was 
reduced by substitutions in two of ten conserved BH4 residues. Deletion of BH4 
rendered Bcl-2 (and Bcl-xL) inactive but did not impair either Bcl-2 
homodimerization or ability to bind to Bax or five other pro-apoptotic relatives 
(Bak, Bad, Bik, Bid or Bim). Hence, association with these death agonists is not 
sufficient to promote cell survival. Significantly, however, Bcl-xL lacking BH4 
lost the ability both to bind CED-4 and antagonize its pro-apoptotic activity. 
These results favour the hypothesis that the BH4 domain of pro-survival Bcl-2 
family members allows them to sequester CED-4 relatives and thereby prevent 
apoptosis.
