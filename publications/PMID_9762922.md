We describe the cloning, expression, and localization of gamma2-adaptin, a novel 
isoform of gamma-adaptin. The predicted human and mouse gamma2-adaptin proteins 
are approximately 90 kDa and 64.4% and 61.7%) identical to gamma-adaptin, 
respectively. gamma2-Adaptin was localized to the Golgi, its localization 
distinct from gamma-adaptin. The membrane association of gamma- and 
gamma2-adaptin could further be distinguished by differential sensitivity to the 
fungal metabolite brefeldin A, gamma2-adaptin binding being insensitive to drug 
treatment. Together, these results suggest that gamma2-adaptin plays a role in 
membrane transport distinct from that played by gamma-adaptin.
