Muscle-type creatine kinase (MM-CK) is a member of the CK isoenzyme family with 
key functions in cellular energetics. MM-CK interacts in an isoform-specific 
manner with the M-band of sarcomeric muscle, where it serves as an efficient 
intramyofibrillar ATP-regenerating system for the actin-activated myosin ATPase 
located nearby on both sides of the M-band. Four MM-CK-specific and highly 
conserved lysine residues are thought to be responsible for the interaction of 
MM-CK with the M-band. A yeast two-hybrid screen led to the identification of 
MM-CK as a binding partner of a central portion of myomesin (My7-8). An 
interaction was observed with domains six to eight of the closely related 
M-protein but not with several other Ig-like domains, including an M-band 
domain, of titin. The observed interactions were corroborated and characterised 
in detail by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BiaCore). In both cases, 
they were CK isoform-specific and the MM-CK-specific lysine residues (K8. K24, 
K104 and K115) are involved in this interaction. At pH 6.8, the dissociation 
constants for the myomesin/MM-CK and the M-protein/MM-CK binding were in the 
range of 50-100 nM and around 1 microM, respectively. The binding showed 
pronounced pH-dependence and indicates a dynamic association/dissociation 
behaviour, which most likely depends on the energy state of the muscle. Our data 
propose a simple model for the regulation of this dynamic interaction.
