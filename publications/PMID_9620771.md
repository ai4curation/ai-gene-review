Sequential cleavage of the precursor protein pre-pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) 
generates the melanocortin peptides adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), 
melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH) alpha, beta and gamma as well as the 
opioid-receptor ligand beta-endorphin. While a few cases of isolated ACTH 
deficiency have been reported (OMIM 201400), an inherited POMC defect has not 
been described so far. Recent studies in animal models elucidated a central role 
of alpha-MSH in the regulation of food intake by activation of the brain 
melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4-R; refs 3-5) and the linkage of human obesity to 
chromosome 2 in close proximity to the POMC locus, led to the proposal of an 
association of POMC with human obesity. The dual role of alpha-MSH in regulating 
food intake and influencing hair pigmentation predicts that the phenotype 
associated with a defect in POMC function would include obesity, alteration in 
pigmentation and ACTH deficiency. The observation of these symptoms in two 
probands prompted us to search for mutations within their POMC genes. Patient 1 
was found to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in exon 3 (G7013T, 
C7133delta) which interfere with appropriate synthesis of ACTH and alpha-MSH. 
Patient 2 was homozygous for a mutation in exon 2 (C3804A) which abolishes POMC 
translation. These findings represent the first examples of a genetic defect 
within the POMC gene and define a new monogenic endocrine disorder resulting in 
early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation.
