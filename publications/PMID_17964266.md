Human SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase protein that plays a role in cell 
death/survival, senescence, and endocrine signaling. While its substrates, 
including p53, have been well characterized, no direct regulators are known. We 
describe here a nuclear protein, active regulator of SIRT1 (AROS), which 
directly regulates SIRT1 function. AROS enhanced SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of 
p53 both in vitro and in vivo, and it inhibited p53-mediated transcriptional 
activity. AROS activity was abrogated by the SIRT1 inhibitors splitomicin and 
nicotinamide and by SIRT1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In addition, AROS was 
unable to cooperate in p53 inactivation in an AROS-binding-defective SIRT1 
mutant. Finally, knockdown of endogenous AROS using an antisense expression 
vector enhanced p21WAF1 expression and increased both the G0/G1 population and 
apoptosis in response to DNA damage, while AROS overexpression improved cell 
survival. To our knowledge, AROS is the first direct SIRT1 regulator to be 
identified that modulates p53-mediated growth regulation.
