Genomic silencing is a fundamental mechanism of transcriptional regulation, yet 
little is known about conserved mechanisms of silencing. We report here the 
discovery of four Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs of the SIR2 silencing gene 
(HSTs), as well as conservation of this gene family from bacteria to mammals. At 
least three HST genes can function in silencing; HST1 overexpression restores 
transcriptional silencing to a sir2 mutant and hst3 hst4 double mutants are 
defective in telomeric silencing. In addition, HST3 and HST4 together contribute 
to proper cell cycle progression, radiation resistance, and genomic stability, 
establishing new connections between silencing and these fundamental cellular 
processes.
