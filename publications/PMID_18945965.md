The identification of novel factors regulating human T helper (Th)-cell 
differentiation into functionally distinct Th1 and Th2 subsets is important for 
understanding the mechanisms behind human autoimmune and allergic diseases. We 
have identified a protein of relevant evolutionary and lymphoid interest 
(PRELI), a novel protein that induces oxidative stress and a mitochondrial 
apoptosis pathway in human primary Th cells. We also demonstrated that PRELI 
inhibits Th2-cell development and down-regulates signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 6 (STAT6), a key transcription factor driving Th2 
differentiation. Our data suggest that calpain, an oxidative stress-induced 
cysteine protease, is involved in the PRELI-induced down-regulation of STAT6. 
Moreover, we observed that a strong T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulus induces 
expression of PRELI and inhibits Th2 development. Our results suggest that PRELI 
is involved in a mechanism wherein the strength of the TCR stimulus influences 
the polarization of Th cells. This study identifies PRELI as a novel factor 
influencing the human primary Th-cell death and differentiation.
