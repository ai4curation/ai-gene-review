The thylakoid proteome of chloroplasts contains multiple proteins involved in 
antioxidative defense, protein folding, and repair. To understand this 
functional protein network, we analyzed the quantitative response of the 
thylakoid-associated proteome of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) wild type 
and the ascorbate-deficient mutant vtc2-2 after transition to high light (HL; 
1,000 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1)). The soluble thylakoid proteomes of wild 
type and vtc2-2 were compared after 0, 1, 3, and 5 d of HL using two-dimensional 
gels with three independent experiments, followed by a multivariant statistical 
analysis and tandem mass spectrometry. After 5 d of HL, both wild-type and 
vtc2-2 plants accumulated anthocyanins, increased their total ascorbate content, 
and lost 10% of photosystem II efficiency, but showed no bleaching. Anthocyanin 
and total ascorbate concentrations in vtc2-2 were respectively 34% and 20% of 
wild type, potentially leading to enhanced oxidative stress in vtc2-2. 
Forty-five protein spots significantly changed as a consequence of genotype, 
light treatment, or both. Independent confirmation was obtained from western 
blots. The most significant response was the up-regulation of thylakoid YCF37 
likely involved in photosystem I assembly, and specific fibrillins, a flavin 
reductase-like protein, and an aldolase, each located in thylakoid-associated 
plastoglobules. Fe-superoxide dismutase was down-regulated in vtc2-2, while 
Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase was up-regulated. vtc2-2 also showed a systematic 
up-regulation of a steroid dehydrogenase-like protein. A number of other 
stress-related proteins, several thylakoid proteases, and lumenal isomerases did 
not change, while PsbS increased in wild type upon light stress. These findings 
are discussed in terms of plastid metabolism and oxidative stress defense, and 
emphasize that understanding of the chloroplast stress-response network must 
include the enzymatic role of plastoglobules.
