Human MOF (MYST1), a member of the MYST (Moz-Ybf2/Sas3-Sas2-Tip60) family of 
histone acetyltransferases (HATs), is the human ortholog of the Drosophila males 
absent on the first (MOF) protein. MOF is the catalytic subunit of the 
male-specific lethal (MSL) HAT complex, which plays a key role in dosage 
compensation in the fly and is responsible for a large fraction of histone H4 
lysine 16 (H4K16) acetylation in vivo. MOF was recently reported to be a 
component of a second HAT complex, designated the non-specific lethal (NSL) 
complex (Mendjan, S., Taipale, M., Kind, J., Holz, H., Gebhardt, P., Schelder, 
M., Vermeulen, M., Buscaino, A., Duncan, K., Mueller, J., Wilm, M., Stunnenberg, 
H. G., Saumweber, H., and Akhtar, A. (2006) Mol. Cell 21, 811-823). Here we 
report an analysis of the subunit composition and substrate specificity of the 
NSL complex. Proteomic analyses of complexes purified through multiple candidate 
subunits reveal that NSL is composed of nine subunits. Two of its subunits, WD 
repeat domain 5 (WDR5) and host cell factor 1 (HCF1), are shared with members of 
the MLL/SET family of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes, 
and a third subunit, MCRS1, is shared with the human INO80 chromatin-remodeling 
complex. In addition, we show that assembly of the MOF HAT into MSL or NSL 
complexes controls its substrate specificity. Although MSL-associated MOF 
acetylates nucleosomal histone H4 almost exclusively on lysine 16, 
NSL-associated MOF exhibits a relaxed specificity and also acetylates 
nucleosomal histone H4 on lysines 5 and 8.
