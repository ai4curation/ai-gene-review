Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and gamma-interferon (IFNgamma) activate an overlapping set 
of genes via the Jak/STAT pathway. However, at least in human cells, a 
differential activation of STAT transcription factors was observed: IL-6 
activates both acute phase response factor (APRF)/STAT3 and STAT1, whereas 
IFNgamma leads only to STAT1 activation. All STATs cloned so far contain SH2 
domains. Since all cytokine receptors using the Jak/STAT pathway were found to 
be tyrosine-phosphorylated after ligand binding, it has been proposed that 
specific phosphotyrosine modules within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor 
chains recruit different STAT factors. We have analyzed by mutational studies 
and by phosphopeptide competition assays which of the tyrosine modules of the 
IL-6 signal transducer gp130 are capable of recruiting either APRF or STAT1. We 
found that two of the four tyrosine modules that are important for APRF 
activation also activate STAT1. For these modules, we propose the new consensus 
sequence YXPQ. We further present evidence that STAT1 is activated independently 
from APRF suggesting that gp130 contains multiple independent STAT binding 
sites. We compare the APRF and STAT1 activation motifs of gp130 with the STAT1 
activation motif of the IFNgamma receptor and demonstrate that the specificity 
of activation can be changed from APRF to STAT1 and vice versa by only two point 
mutations within a tyrosine module. These data strongly support the concept that 
the activation of a specific STAT is determined mainly by the phosphotyrosine 
module. The significance of these findings for other receptor systems is 
discussed.
