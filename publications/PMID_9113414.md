One attractive candidate for a Ras effector protein, other than the Raf kinases, 
is Ras-GAP. Indeed, recent literature suggests that besides the Raf/MAP kinase 
cascade, additional pathways must be stimulated to elicit a full biological 
response to Ras. Ras binds the COOH terminal domain of Ras-GAP, while the NH2 
terminal domain appears to be essential for triggering downstream signals. Since 
Ras-GAP itself has no obvious enzymatic function that might explain a role in 
processes associated with proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis, 
candidates for downstream Ras-GAP effectors that fulfill this role remain to be 
identified. The newly found GAP-SH3 domain Binding Protein (G3BP) may be one of 
these. This review will briefly overview the candidates Ras effectors and 
discuss the results that position Ras-GAP as a critical effector downstream of 
Ras.
