Nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II), also designated RNA helicase A, is a 
multifunctional protein involved in transcription, RNA processing, and 
transport. Here we report that NDH II binds to F-actin. NDH II was partially 
purified from HeLa nuclear extracts by ion-exchange chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 
and DEAE-Sepharose. Upon gel-filtration chromatography on Sepharose 4B, 
partially purified NDH II resolved into two distinct peaks. The first NDH II 
peak, corresponding to the void volume of Sepharose 4B, displayed coelution with 
an abundant 42-kDa protein that was subsequently identified as actin. Several 
nuclear proteins such as RNA polymerase II, the U5 small nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-associated WD40 protein, and heterogeneous nuclear RNPs 
(hnRNPs) copurified with NDH II. However, only hnRNPs A1 and C were found 
together with NDH II and actin polymers during gel filtration. NDH II and hnRNP 
C from the HeLa nuclear extract coeluted with F-actin on Sepharose 4B in an 
RNase-resistant manner, whereas hnRNP A1 was nearly completely removed from 
F-actin-associated hnRNP complexes following RNA digestion. The association of 
NDH II and hnRNP C with F-actin was abolished by gelsolin, an 
F-actin-depolymerizing protein that fragments actin polymers into oligomers or 
monomers. Furthermore, NDH II co-immunoprecipitated with F-actin and hnRNP C, 
respectively. In vitro translated NDH II coeluted with F-actin on Sepharose 4B, 
whereas no coelution with F-actin was observed for in vitro translated hnRNP A1 
or C1. Binding to F-actin requires an intact C terminus of NDH II and most 
likely a native protein conformation. Electron microscopy indicated a close 
spatial proximity among NDH II, hnRNP C, and F-actin within the HeLa nucleus. 
These results suggest an important function of NDH II in mediating the 
attachment of hnRNP-mRPP RNP complexes to the actin nucleoskeleton for RNA 
processing, transport, or other actin-related processes.
