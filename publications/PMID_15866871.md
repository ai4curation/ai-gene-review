Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key negative regulator of insulin 
and leptin signaling and a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 
diabetes, obesity, and other associated metabolic syndromes. Because PTP1B 
regulates multiple signal pathways and it can both enhance and antagonize a 
cellular event, it is important to establish the physiological relevance of 
PTP1B in these processes. In this study, we utilize potent and selective PTP1B 
inhibitors to delineate the role of PTP1B in integrin signaling. We show that 
down-regulation of PTP1B activity with small molecule inhibitors suppresses cell 
spreading and migration to fibronectin, increases Tyr(527) phosphorylation in 
Src, and decreases phosphorylation of FAK, p130(Cas), and ERK1/2. In addition, 
PTP1B "substrate-trapping" mutants bind Tyr(527)-phosphorylated Src and protect 
it from dephosphorylation by endogenous PTP1B. These results establish that 
PTP1B promotes integrin-mediated responses in fibroblasts by dephosphorylating 
the inhibitory pTyr(527) and thereby activating the Src kinase. We also show 
that PTP1B forms a complex with Src and p130(Cas), and that the proline-rich 
motif PPRPPK (residues 309-314) in PTP1B is essential for the complex formation. 
We suggest that the specificity of PTP1B for Src pTyr(527) is mediated by 
protein-protein interactions involving the docking protein p130(Cas) with both 
Src and PTP1B in addition to the interactions between the PTP1B active site and 
the pTyr(527) motif.
