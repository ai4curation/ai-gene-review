CREG1 is a small glycoprotein which has been proposed as a transcription 
repressor, a secretory ligand, a lysosomal, or a mitochondrial protein. This is 
largely because of lack of antibodies for immunolocalization validated through 
gain- and loss-of-function studies. In the present study, we demonstrate, using 
antibodies validated for immunofluorescence microscopy, that CREG1 is mainly 
localized to the endosomal-lysosomal compartment. Gain- and loss-of-function 
analyses reveal an important role for CREG1 in both macropinocytosis and 
clathrin-dependent endocytosis. CREG1 also promotes acidification of the 
endosomal-lysosomal compartment and increases lysosomal biogenesis. 
Functionally, overexpression of CREG1 enhances macroautophagy/autophagy and 
lysosome-mediated degradation, whereas knockdown or knockout of CREG1 has 
opposite effects. The function of CREG1 in lysosomal biogenesis is likely 
attributable to enhanced endocytic trafficking. Our results demonstrate that 
CREG1 is an endosomal-lysosomal protein implicated in endocytic trafficking and 
lysosomal biogenesis.Abbreviations: AIFM1/AIF: apoptosis inducing factor
