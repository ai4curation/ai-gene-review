Human mammary cells present on the cell surface a polymorphic epithelial mucin 
(PEM) which is developmentally regulated and aberrantly expressed in tumors. PEM 
carries tumor-associated epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies 
HMFG-1, HMFG-2, and SM-3. Previously isolated partial cDNA clones revealed that 
the core protein contained a large domain consisting of variable numbers of 
20-amino acid repeat units. We now report the full sequence for PEM, as deduced 
from cDNA sequences. The encoded protein consists of three distinct regions: the 
amino terminus consisting of a putative signal peptide and degenerate repeats; 
the major portion of the protein which is the tandem repeat region; the carboxyl 
terminus consisting of degenerate tandem repeats and a unique sequence 
containing a transmembrane sequence and a cytoplasmic tail. Potential 
O-glycosylation sites (serines or threonines) make up more than one-fourth of 
the amino acids. Length variations in the tandem repeat result in PEM being an 
expressed variable number tandem repeat locus. Tandem repeats appear to be a 
general characteristic of mucin core proteins.
