cpSRP54 (for chloroplast SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE54) is involved in 
cotranslational and posttranslational sorting of thylakoid proteins. The 
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cpSRP54 null mutant, ffc1-2, is pale green 
with delayed development. Western-blot analysis of individual leaves showed that 
the SRP sorting pathway, but not the SecY/E translocon, was strongly 
down-regulated with progressive leaf development in both wild-type and ffc1-2 
plants. To further understand the impact of cpSRP54 deletion, a quantitative 
comparison of ffc2-1 was carried out for total leaf proteomes of young seedlings 
and for chloroplast proteomes of fully developed leaves using stable isotope 
labeling (isobaric stable isotope labeling and isotope-coded affinity tags) and 
two-dimensional gels. This showed that cpSRP54 deletion led to a change in 
light-harvesting complex composition, an increase of PsbS, and a decreased 
photosystem I/II ratio. Moreover, the cpSRP54 deletion led in young leaves to 
up-regulation of thylakoid proteases and stromal chaperones, including ClpC. In 
contrast, the stromal protein homeostasis machinery returned to wild-type levels 
in mature leaves, consistent with the developmental down-regulation of the SRP 
pathway. A differential response between young and mature leaves was also found 
in carbon metabolism, with an up-regulation of the Calvin cycle and the 
photorespiratory pathway in peroxisomes and mitochondria in young leaves but not 
in old leaves. The Calvin cycle was down-regulated in mature leaves to adjust to 
the reduced capacity of the light reaction, while reactive oxygen species 
defense proteins were up-regulated. The significance of ClpC up-regulation was 
confirmed through the generation of an ffc2-1 clpc1 double mutant. This mutant 
was seedling lethal under autotrophic conditions but could be partially rescued 
under heterotrophic conditions.
