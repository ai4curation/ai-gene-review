Light harvested by plants is essential for the survival of most life forms. This 
light perception ability requires the activities of proteins termed 
photoreceptors. We report a function for photoreceptors in mediating resistance 
(R) protein-derived plant defense. The blue-light photoreceptors, cryptochrome 
(CRY) 2 and phototropin (PHOT) 2, are required for the stability of the R 
protein HRT, and thereby resistance to Turnip Crinkle virus (TCV). Exposure to 
darkness or blue-light induces degradation of CRY2, and in turn HRT, resulting 
in susceptibility. Overexpression of HRT can compensate for the absence of PHOT2 
but not CRY2. HRT does not directly associate with either CRY2 or PHOT2 but does 
bind the CRY2-/PHOT2-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase, COP1. Application of the 
proteasome inhibitor, MG132, prevents blue-light-dependent degradation of HRT, 
consequently these plants show resistance to TCV under blue-light. We propose 
that CRY2/PHOT2 negatively regulate the proteasome-mediated degradation of HRT, 
likely via COP1, and blue-light relieves this repression resulting in HRT 
degradation.

Abstract

Light harvested by plants is essential for the survival of most life forms. This light perception ability requires the activities of proteins termed photoreceptors. We report a function for photoreceptors in mediating resistance (R) protein-derived plant defense. The blue-light photoreceptors, cryptochrome (CRY) 2 and phototropin (PHOT) 2, are required for the stability of the R protein HRT, and thereby resistance to Turnip Crinkle virus (TCV). Exposure to darkness or blue-light induces degradation of CRY2, and in turn HRT, resulting in susceptibility. Overexpression of HRT can compensate for the absence of PHOT2 but not CRY2. HRT does not directly associate with either CRY2 or PHOT2 but does bind the CRY2-/PHOT2-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase, COP1. Application of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, prevents blue-light-dependent degradation of HRT, consequently these plants show resistance to TCV under blue-light. We propose that CRY2/PHOT2 negatively regulate the proteasome-mediated degradation of HRT, likely via COP1, and blue-light relieves this repression resulting in HRT degradation.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our results provide definitive evidence for a mechanistic role for blue-light photoreceptors in R protein-mediated resistance to TCV. These blue-light photoreceptors appear to affect multiple steps in the resistance signaling pathway including their indirect roles in maintaining R protein stability by repressing COP1 activity as well as by regulating pathogen-responsive accumulation of SA and downstream resistance signaling.
