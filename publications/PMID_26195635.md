through proteolytic cleavage of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). STC1 potently (Ki 
= 68 pm) inhibits PAPP-A cleavage of IGFBP-4, and we show in a cell-based assay 
that STC1 effectively antagonizes PAPP-A-mediated type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) 
phosphorylation. It has recently been found that the homologous STC2 inhibits 
PAPP-A proteolytic activity, and that this depends on the formation of a 
covalent complex between the inhibitor and the proteinase, mediated by Cys-120 
of STC2. We find that STC1 is unable to bind covalently to PAPP-A, in agreement 
with the absence of a corresponding cysteine residue. It rather binds to PAPP-A 
with high affinity (KD = 75 pm). We further demonstrate that both STC1 and STC2 
show inhibitory activity toward PAPP-A2, but not selected serine proteinases and 
metalloproteinases. We therefore conclude that the STCs are proteinase 
inhibitors, probably restricted in specificity to the pappalysin family of 
metzincin metalloproteinases. Our data are the first to identify STC1 as a 
proteinase inhibitor, suggesting a previously unrecognized function of STC1 in 
the IGF system.

Introduction

Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) 3 is a glycoprotein, first isolated from the corpuscles of Stannius (CS) in teleost fish, where it is known to function as a hypocalcemic hormone important for serum calcium homeostasis ( 1 , 2 ). STC1 is synthesized in the CS and released from this unique gland in response to elevated serum calcium levels. It negatively regulates calcium ion uptake from the environment via gill ionocytes by regulating the expression of the epithelial calcium ion channel ( 3 , 4 ). Although the CS or any comparable structure is absent in mammals, mammalian STC1 has been identified ( 5 , 6 ) and is abundantly expressed in many organs, e.g. kidney, heart, lung, liver, adrenal gland, prostate, and ovary ( 5 , 7 ). However, through the analysis of genetically modified animals, a role of STC1 in mammalian mineral homeostasis has been questioned, in particular because STC1 knock-out mice do not show an altered level of serum calcium compared with wild-type mice ( 8 , 9 ).

Although STC1 is not believed to affect systemic ion balances in mammals, functions relating to ion transport in isolated cells or in individual organs have been proposed ( 2 ). For example, it has been found that STC1 reversibly inhibits transmembrane calcium currents in cardiomyocytes ( 10 ), that it inhibits renal phosphate excretion ( 11 ), and that it suppresses intestinal calcium absorption ( 12 ). Furthermore, mammalian STC1 has been suggested to be involved in physiological processes such as adipogenesis ( 13 ), chondrogenesis ( 14 ), and development of human cancer ( 2 ).

Interestingly, a mammalian homolog of STC1 was discovered more recently and named STC2 ( 15 – 17 ). Although STC2 has been studied less than STC1, it is known to negatively regulate growth, as evidenced by the severe dwarf phenotype of transgenic STC2 mice ( 18 ), and also by the increased growth rate of STC2 knock-out mice ( 9 ). The molecular mechanism behind this growth-suppressive effect was revealed recently, when STC2 was demonstrated to be a proteinase inhibitor of the metzincin metalloproteinase, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) ( 19 ).

PAPP-A is a regulator within the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system ( 20 ), and knock-out of the PAPP-A gene in mice causes a severe dwarf phenotype ( 21 ), strikingly similar to the phenotype observed upon transgenic overexpression of STC2 ( 18 ). IGF-I and -II are ubiquitous polypeptides that exert their effects on cell proliferation and survival by binding to the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) ( 22 ). In tissues, the bioavailability of the IGFs is tightly regulated by six homologous IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1–6), which function to antagonize receptor activation by high affinity binding of the IGFs. However, proteolytic cleavage of the IGFBPs causes diminished affinity for the growth factors and thus release of bioactive IGF ( 23 ). One of the best studied IGFBP proteinases is PAPP-A, which together with its homolog, PAPP-A2 ( 24 ), comprises the pappalysin family of the metzincin metalloproteinases ( 25 ). PAPP-A is expressed in most tissues ( 26 ), and it cleaves IGFBP-4 at a single site in an IGF-dependent manner ( 27 , 28 ). Additional known substrates of PAPP-A are IGFBP-2 ( 29 ) and IGFBP-5 ( 28 ).

Thus, STC2 has the potential to silence IGF signaling in tissues where this depends on PAPP-A activity. Curiously, the inhibitory activity of STC2 toward PAPP-A is dependent on the formation of a covalent proteinase·inhibitor complex between PAPP-A and STC2. In agreement with this mechanism, mice transgenic for a variant of STC2, which is unable to bind covalently to PAPP-A, grow like wild-type mice, supporting the interpretation that STC2 reduces IGF signaling through inhibition of PAPP-A ( 19 ).

Although STC1 knock-out mice do not show any growth-related phenotype ( 8 ), it is interesting that transgenic overexpression of STC1 causes a severe reduction in growth ( 30 ), similar to the phenotype of STC2 transgenic mice ( 18 ). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that STC1 possesses proteinase inhibitory activity toward PAPP-A.

Discussion

We have established STC1 as a novel proteinase inhibitor of the metzincin metalloproteinase PAPP-A, and we have shown that the inhibitory activity of STC1 is based on high affinity interactions between the proteinase and the inhibitor. This is in contrast to the homolog STC2, which is dependent on the formation of a covalent complex for inhibition of PAPP-A ( 19 ). We have also shown that STC1 is able to inhibit IGF signaling in vitro through silencing of PAPP-A activity. Finally, we have demonstrated that PAPP-A2, the other member of the pappalysin family of metalloproteinases, can be inhibited by both STC1 and STC2. In contrast, neither STC1 nor STC2 showed inhibitory activity toward other selected metzincin metalloproteinases or serine proteinases.

Secondary structure predictions and circular dichroism spectroscopy indicate that both STC1 and STC2 have a high α-helical content ( 19 , 38 ), but no known modules or motifs can be recognized in the amino acid sequences. Therefore, the inhibitory function of the proteins is surprising and could not have been predicted. The degree of sequence identity between STC1 and STC2 is relatively low, and hence the conserved pattern of cysteine residues is important for defining the STCs, particularly relevant for evolutionary distant species ( 41 ). Comparison of the human STCs shows that the region contained between the first (Cys-45) and the 10th (Cys-170) cysteine of STC1, containing all intrachain disulfide bridges (see Fig. 4 A ), has a sequence identity of 39%. The C-terminal portion of the proteins are less conserved, and STC2 contains an extended sequence stretch of more than 40 residues with no counterpart in STC1 ( 41 ). This indicates that structural features important for the common inhibitory function of STC1 and STC2 lie within a core region of 126 residues, containing a total of five intrachain disulfide bonds.

The covalent complex between STC2 and PAPP-A, which is proteolytically inactive, forms in vitro over hours and requires Cys-120 of STC2. In fact, substitution of this cysteine residue for an alanine causes loss of inhibitory activity toward PAPP-A ( 19 ). In agreement with the absence of a corresponding cysteine residue in its sequence, STC1 binds PAPP-A noncovalently but with high affinity ( K D = 75 p m ). Concordantly, kinetic analysis showed that STC1 potently ( K i = 68 p m ) inhibits PAPP-A and therefore has the potential to be a physiological regulator of PAPP-A activity and hence IGF signaling in vivo . For comparison, the physical interaction between STC1 and PAPP-A is comparable in strength to some of the high affinity interactions between many well characterized pairs of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases and their target proteinases ( 42 ).

Is there any evidence to suggest a functional connection between the role of STC1 as a proteinase inhibitor of PAPP-A and other possible biological activities of STC1? In teleost fish, STC1 inhibits uptake of calcium ions from the environment through the gills ( 3 ), and recently, studies in zebrafish have revealed that this involves regulated expression of the epithelial calcium ion channel in gill ionocytes ( 43 , 44 ), although some molecular details are still lacking. In this regard, it is interesting that an apparent link between calcium levels and IGF-induced cell proliferation has been demonstrated for zebrafish skin ionocytes, which have a similar regulatory role in the embryo before the gills are developed: activation of IGF1R-PI3K-Akt signaling was found to result from low levels of extracellular calcium ions ( 45 ). The proposed signaling mechanism involves zebrafish IGFBP-5, which is also a PAPP-A substrate ( 46 ). Although speculative, STC1 and PAPP-A may therefore in some cells or tissues be functionally connected in the network of proteins regulating transepithelial calcium ion uptake, possibly also relevant in mammals ( 4 ).

Based on overexpression studies in mice, it is fair to assume that not only STC2 ( 18 , 19 ) but also STC1 ( 30 ) can function as inhibitors of PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 in vivo . The two pappalysins and the STCs are ubiquitously expressed in many human tissues and we therefore suggest that functional interactions occur in vivo , which is likely to affect IGF signaling locally in both human health and disease. For example, increased IGF signaling has consistently been linked to several aspects of human cancer development ( 47 ). For this reason, it is no surprise to find that expression of PAPP-A is up-regulated in several different types of cancer ( 20 ) and has in fact proved useful in animal models as a target to indirectly inhibit IGF signaling ( 48 , 49 ). Many studies link STC1 and STC2 to different aspects of human cancer, in particular metastasis ( 50 ). Although some studies report a loss of STC expression, e.g. in breast cancer as a consequence of lost BRCA1 activity ( 51 ), the majority of these studies report increased levels of expression ( 2 , 52 ). This is in apparent conflict with a role of the STCs as inhibitors of PAPP-A and hence IGF signaling. On the other hand, a recent paper reported that breast cancer cells become more invasive following down-regulation of PAPP-A ( 53 ). Because the STCs have not previously been connected to PAPP-A or other components of the IGF system, they have been considered to represent different biological systems and therefore been studied separately. Future studies are required to address the raised questions. In particular, distinction between tumor stages and between individual cells of the tumor microenvironment may lead to a better understanding of how these molecules function together.

Overall, we have shown that STC1 is a proteinase inhibitor of the pappalysins, and we hypothesize that STC1 is a relevant modulator of the IGF system in human physiology. However, whereas this hypothesis has a solid biochemical rationale, it is also possible that the pappalysins have modulatory effects on functions of the stanniocalcins, which may be unrelated to IGF signaling. This hypothesis should also be tested.
