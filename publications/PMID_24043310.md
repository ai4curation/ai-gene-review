Sirtuins are a family of protein deacetylases, deacylases, and 
ADP-ribosyltransferases that regulate life span, control the onset of numerous 
age-associated diseases, and mediate metabolic homeostasis. We have uncovered a 
novel role for the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT4 in the regulation of hepatic 
lipid metabolism during changes in nutrient availability. We show that SIRT4 
levels decrease in the liver during fasting and that SIRT4 null mice display 
increased expression of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α 
(PPARα) target genes associated with fatty acid catabolism. Accordingly, primary 
hepatocytes from SIRT4 knockout (KO) mice exhibit higher rates of fatty acid 
oxidation than wild-type hepatocytes, and SIRT4 overexpression decreases fatty 
acid oxidation rates. The enhanced fatty acid oxidation observed in SIRT4 KO 
hepatocytes requires functional SIRT1, demonstrating a clear cross talk between 
mitochondrial and nuclear sirtuins. Thus, SIRT4 is a new component of 
mitochondrial signaling in the liver and functions as an important regulator of 
lipid metabolism.
