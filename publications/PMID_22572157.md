To prevent and treat immune-mediated platelet disorders (e.g. neonatal 
allo-immune thrombocytopenia and platelet transfusion refractoriness) the 
causative idiotypic platelet-reactive antibodies have to be detected with high 
sensitivity and specificity. The "Monoclonal Antibody Immobilization Platelet 
Assay" (MAIPA) is the diagnostic gold standard for immunotyping sera with 
respect to alloantibodies against human platelet antigens (HPA). However, it is 
labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, an automated protein chip 
assay (enzyme-linked sandwich immunoassay) based on interdigitated gold 
microelectrodes in combination with an electrical read-out system was developed 
and optimized. For this purpose, specific capture antibodies were immobilized on 
the gold electrodes. The binding of the target is detected via an enzyme-labeled 
detection antibody by a redox-recycling process that corresponds to the amount 
of bound target molecule. With this electrical chip assay it is possible to 
detect antibodies against HPA-1a, HPA-5b and HLA with high sensitivity and 
specificity in less than half the duration of the MAIPA protocol with similar 
intra- and interassay variance.
