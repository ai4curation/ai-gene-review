The Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that 
is expressed in glomerular podocytes during a narrow window in kidney 
development. By immunoprecipitation and protein microsequencing analysis, we 
have identified a major cellular protein associated with endogenous WT1 to be 
the inducible chaperone Hsp70. WT1 and Hsp70 are physically associated in 
embryonic rat kidney cells, in primary Wilms tumor specimens and in cultured 
cells with inducible expression of WT1. Colocalization of WT1 and Hsp70 is 
evident within podocytes of the developing kidney, and Hsp70 is recruited to the 
characteristic subnuclear clusters that contain WT1. The amino-terminal 
transactivation domain of WT1 is required for binding to Hsp70, and expression 
of that domain itself is sufficient to induce expression of Hsp70 through the 
heat shock element (HSE). Substitution of a heterologous Hsp70-binding domain 
derived from human DNAJ is sufficient to restore the functional properties of a 
WT1 protein with an amino-terminal deletion, an effect that is abrogated by a 
point mutation in DNAJ that reduces binding to Hsp70. These observations 
indicate that Hsp70 is an important cofactor for the function of WT1, and 
suggest a potential role for this chaperone during kidney differentiation.
