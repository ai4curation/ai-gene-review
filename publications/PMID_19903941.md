Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a messenger molecule generated by cystathionine 
gamma-lyase, acts as a physiologic vasorelaxant. Mechanisms whereby H2S signals 
have been elusive. We now show that H2S physiologically modifies cysteines in a 
large number of proteins by S-sulfhydration. About 10 to 25% of many liver 
proteins, including actin, tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GAPDH), are sulfhydrated under physiological conditions. Sulfhydration augments 
GAPDH activity and enhances actin polymerization. Sulfhydration thus appears to 
be a physiologic posttranslational modification for proteins.
