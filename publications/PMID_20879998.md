Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia, 
adheres to ciliated respiratory epithelia resulting in ciliostasis and 
epithelial cell death. The cilium adhesin P97 (Mhp183) contains two repeat 
regions, designated R1 and R2, that play key roles in adherence. Eight 
pentapeptide repeats in R1 are sufficient to bind porcine cilia; however, both 
R1 and R2 are needed to bind heparin. Mhp271, a paralogue of P97, is the only 
other M. hyopneumoniae protein to contain both R1 and R2 repeats. These repeats 
are arranged as a set of three pentapeptide repeats (designated R1A₂₇₁), two 
decapeptide repeats (designated R2₂₇₁), and a second set of six pentapeptide 
repeats (designated R1B₂₇₁). To determine their function, recombinant proteins 
containing R1A₂₇₁) (F1₂₇₁) and R2₂₇₁-R1B₂₇₁ (F2₂₇₁) were constructed and used in 
in vitro binding assays. F2₂₇₁, but not F1₂₇₁, bound heparin (K(D)=8.1 ± 0.4 
nM), fibronectin (K(D)=174 ± 13 nM) and porcine cilia. Pre-incubation of F2₂₇₁ 
with 100 µM heparin blocked cilium binding by ~69%. Cell surface shaving with 
trypsin combined with two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem 
mass spectrometry analysis identified Mhp271 as surface-exposed. Our data 
suggest that both R1 and R2 in Mhp271 are involved in binding to host molecules.
