PURPOSE: ADAMTSL4 mutations cause autosomal recessive isolated ectopia lentis 
(IEL) and ectopia lentis et pupillae. Dominant FBN1 mutations cause IEL or 
syndromic ectopia lentis (Marfan syndrome and Weill-Marchesani syndrome). The 
authors sought to characterize recombinant ADAMTSL4 and the ocular distribution 
of ADAMTSL4 and to investigate whether ADAMTSL4 influences the biogenesis of 
fibrillin-1 microfibrils, which compose the zonule.
METHODS: ADAMTSL4 was expressed by the transfection of HEK293F cells. Protein 
extracts and paraffin sections from human eyes were analyzed by Western blot 
analysis and by immunoperoxidase staining, respectively. Immunofluorescence was 
used to evaluate fibrillin-1 deposition in the ECM of fetal bovine nuchal 
ligament cells after culture in ADAMTSL4-conditioned medium or control medium. 
Confocal microscopy was performed to investigate ADAMTSL4 and fibrillin-1 
colocalization in these cultures.
RESULTS: Western blot analysis identified ADAMTSL4 as a glycoprotein in HEK293F 
cells and as a major band of 150 kDa in ocular tissues including ciliary body, 
sclera, cornea, and retina. Immunoperoxidase staining showed a broad ocular 
distribution of ADAMTSL4, associated with both cells and fibrillar ECM. When 
cultured in ADAMTSL4-containing medium, fetal bovine nuchal ligament cells 
showed accelerated fibrillin-1 deposition in ECM. ADAMTSL4 colocalized with 
fibrillin-1 microfibrils in the ECM of these cells.
CONCLUSIONS: ADAMTSL4 is a secreted glycoprotein that is widely distributed in 
the human eye. Enhanced fibrillin-1 deposition in the presence of ADAMTSL4 and 
colocalization of ADAMTSL4 with fibrillin-1 in the ECM of cultured fibroblasts 
suggest a potential role for ADAMTSL4 in the formation or maintenance of the 
zonule.
