Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a paramyxovirus that produces airway 
inflammation, in part by inducing interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression, a CXC-type 
chemokine, via the NF-kappaB/RelA and STAT/IRF signaling pathways. In 
RSV-infected A549 cells, IL-8 transcription attenuates after 24 h in spite of 
ongoing viral replication and persistence of nuclear RelA, suggesting a 
mechanism for transcriptional attenuation. RSV infection induces B-cell lymphoma 
protein -3 (Bcl-3) expression 6 to 12 h after viral infection, at times when 
IL-8 transcription is inhibited. By contrast, 293 cells, deficient in inducible 
Bcl-3 expression, show no attenuation of IL-8 transcription. We therefore 
examined Bcl-3's role in terminating virus-inducible IL-8 transcription. 
Transient expression of Bcl-3 potently inhibited virus-inducible IL-8 
transcription by disrupting both the NF-kappaB and STAT/IRF pathways. Although 
previously Bcl-3 was thought to capture 50-kDa NF-kappaB1 isoforms in the 
cytoplasm, immunoprecipitation (IP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
indicate that nuclear Bcl-3 associates with NF-kappaB1 without affecting DNA 
binding. Additionally, Bcl-3 potently inhibited the STAT/IRF pathway. 
Nondenaturing co-IP assays indicate that nuclear Bcl-3 associates with STAT-1 
and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC-1), increasing HDAC-1 recruitment to the IL-8 
promoter. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A blocks attenuation of 
IL-8 transcription. A nuclear targeting-deficient Bcl-3 is unable to enhance 
HDAC-1-mediated chemokine repression. Finally, small inhibitory RNA-mediated 
Bcl-3 "knockdown" resulted in enhanced RSV-induced chemokine expression in A549 
cells. These data indicate that Bcl-3 is a virus-inducible inhibitor of 
chemokine transcription by interfering with the NF-kappaB and STAT/IRF signaling 
pathways by complexing with them and recruiting HDAC-1 to attenuate target 
promoter activity.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a paramyxovirus that produces airway inflammation, in part by inducing interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression, a CXC-type chemokine, via the NF-κB/RelA and STAT/IRF signaling pathways. In RSV-infected A549 cells, IL-8 transcription attenuates after 24 h in spite of ongoing viral replication and persistence of nuclear RelA, suggesting a mechanism for transcriptional attenuation. RSV infection induces B-cell lymphoma protein -3 (Bcl-3) expression 6 to 12 h after viral infection, at times when IL-8 transcription is inhibited. By contrast, 293 cells, deficient in inducible Bcl-3 expression, show no attenuation of IL-8 transcription. We therefore examined Bcl-3's role in terminating virus-inducible IL-8 transcription. Transient expression of Bcl-3 potently inhibited virus-inducible IL-8 transcription by disrupting both the NF-κB and STAT/IRF pathways. Although previously Bcl-3 was thought to capture 50-kDa NF-κB1 isoforms in the cytoplasm, immunoprecipitation (IP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that nuclear Bcl-3 associates with NF-κB1 without affecting DNA binding. Additionally, Bcl-3 potently inhibited the STAT/IRF pathway. Nondenaturing co-IP assays indicate that nuclear Bcl-3 associates with STAT-1 and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC-1), increasing HDAC-1 recruitment to the IL-8 promoter.
