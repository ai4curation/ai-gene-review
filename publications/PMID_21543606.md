There is a strong genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but so 
far few gene variants have been identified that reliably contribute to that 
risk. A newly confirmed genetic risk allele C of the clusterin (CLU) gene 
variant rs11136000 is carried by ∼88% of Caucasians. The C allele confers a 1.16 
greater odds of developing late-onset AD than the T allele. AD patients have 
reductions in regional white matter integrity. We evaluated whether the CLU risk 
variant was similarly associated with lower white matter integrity in healthy 
young humans. Evidence of early brain differences would offer a target for 
intervention decades before symptom onset. We scanned 398 healthy young adults 
(mean age, 23.6 ± 2.2 years) with diffusion tensor imaging, a variation of 
magnetic resonance imaging sensitive to white matter integrity in the living 
brain. We assessed genetic associations using mixed-model regression at each 
point in the brain to map the profile of these associations with white matter 
integrity. Each C allele copy of the CLU variant was associated with lower 
fractional anisotropy--a widely accepted measure of white matter integrity--in 
multiple brain regions, including several known to degenerate in AD. These 
regions included the splenium of the corpus callosum, the fornix, cingulum, and 
superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi in both brain hemispheres. Young 
healthy carriers of the CLU gene risk variant showed a distinct profile of lower 
white matter integrity that may increase vulnerability to developing AD later in 
life.
