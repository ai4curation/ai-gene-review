Telomerase activity is critical for normal and transformed human cells to escape 
from crisis and is implicated in oncogenesis. Here we describe a novel Pin2/TRF1 
binding protein, PinX1 that inhibits telomerase activity and affects 
tumorigenicity. PinX1 and its small TID domain bind the telomerase catalytic 
subunit hTERT and potently inhibit its activity. Overexpression of PinX1 or its 
TID domain inhibits telomerase activity, shortens telomeres, and induces crisis, 
whereas depletion of endogenous PinX1 increases telomerase activity and 
elongates telomeres. Depletion of PinX1 also increases tumorigenicity in nude 
mice, consistent with its chromosome localization at 8p23, a region with 
frequent loss of heterozygosity in a number of human cancers. Thus, PinX1 is a 
potent telomerase inhibitor and a putative tumor suppressor.
