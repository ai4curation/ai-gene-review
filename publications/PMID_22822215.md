UV light-induced photoproducts are recognized and removed by the 
nucleotide-excision repair (NER) pathway. In humans, the UV-damaged DNA-binding 
protein (UV-DDB) is part of a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2)) 
that initiates NER by recognizing damaged chromatin with concomitant 
ubiquitination of core histones at the lesion. We report the X-ray crystal 
structure of the human UV-DDB in a complex with damaged DNA and show that the 
N-terminal domain of DDB2 makes critical contacts with two molecules of DNA, 
driving N-terminal-domain folding and promoting UV-DDB dimerization. The 
functional significance of the dimeric UV-DDB [(DDB1-DDB2)(2)], in a complex 
with damaged DNA, is validated by electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, 
solution biophysical, and functional analyses. We propose that the binding of 
UV-damaged DNA results in conformational changes in the N-terminal domain of 
DDB2, inducing helical folding in the context of the bound DNA and inducing 
dimerization as a function of nucleotide binding. The temporal and spatial 
interplay between domain ordering and dimerization provides an elegant molecular 
rationale for the unprecedented binding affinities and selectivities exhibited 
by UV-DDB for UV-damaged DNA. Modeling the DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) complex according to 
the dimeric UV-DDB-AP24 architecture results in a mechanistically consistent 
alignment of the E3 ligase bound to a nucleosome harboring damaged DNA. Our 
findings provide unique structural and conformational insights into the 
molecular architecture of the DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) E3 ligase, with significant 
implications for the regulation and overall organization of the proteins 
responsible for initiation of NER in the context of chromatin and for the 
consequent maintenance of genomic integrity.
