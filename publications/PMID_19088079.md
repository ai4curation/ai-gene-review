The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway is a critical 
regulator of animal development and homeostasis. Activation of the PDGF pathway 
leads to neointimal proliferative responses to artery injury; it promotes a 
switch of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) to a less contractile phenotype by 
inhibiting the SMC-specific gene expression and increasing the rate of 
proliferation and migration. The molecular mechanism for these pleiotropic 
effects of PDGFs has not been fully described. Here, we identify the 
microRNA-221 (miR-221), a small noncoding RNA, as a modulator of the phenotypic 
change of vSMCs in response to PDGF signaling. We demonstrate that miR-221 is 
transcriptionally induced upon PDGF treatment in primary vSMCs, leading to 
down-regulation of the targets c-Kit and p27Kip1. Down-regulation of p27Kip1 by 
miR-221 is critical for PDGF-mediated induction of cell proliferation. 
Additionally, decreased c-Kit causes inhibition of SMC-specific contractile gene 
transcription by reducing the expression of Myocardin (Myocd), a potent 
SMC-specific nuclear coactivator. Our study demonstrates that PDGF signaling, by 
modulating the expression of miR-221, regulates two critical determinants of the 
vSMC phenotype; they are SMC gene expression and cell proliferation.
