The metabolism of one- and two-carbon compounds by the methylotrophic bacterium 
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 involves high carbon flux through the 
ethylmalonyl coenzyme A (ethylmalonyl-CoA) pathway (EMC pathway). During growth 
on ethylamine, the EMC pathway operates as a linear pathway carrying the full 
assimilatory flux to produce glyoxylate, malate, and succinate. Assimilatory 
carbon enters the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway directly as acetyl-CoA, bypassing 
pathways for formaldehyde oxidation/assimilation and the regulatory mechanisms 
controlling them, making ethylamine growth a useful condition to study the 
regulation of the EMC pathway. Wild-type M. extorquens cells were grown at 
steady state on a limiting concentration of succinate, and the growth substrate 
was then switched to ethylamine, a condition where the cell must make a sudden 
switch from utilizing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to using the 
ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for assimilation, which has been an effective strategy 
for identifying metabolic control points. A 9-h lag in growth was observed, 
during which butyryl-CoA, a degradation product of ethylmalonyl-CoA, 
accumulated, suggesting a metabolic imbalance. Ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity 
increased to a level sufficient for the observed growth rate at 9 h, which 
correlated with an upregulation of RNA transcripts for ecm and a decrease in the 
levels of ethylmalonyl-CoA. When the wild-type strain overexpressing ecm was 
tested with the same substrate switchover experiment, ethylmalonyl-CoA did not 
accumulate, growth resumed earlier, and, after a transient period of slow 
growth, the culture grew at a higher rate than that of the control. These 
findings demonstrate that ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase is a metabolic control point 
in the EMC pathway, expanding our understanding of its regulation.
