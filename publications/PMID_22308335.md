ATPases and histone chaperones facilitate RNA polymerase II (pol II) elongation 
on chromatin. In vivo, the coordinated action of these enzymes is necessary to 
permit pol II passage through a nucleosome while restoring histone density 
afterward. We have developed a biochemical system recapitulating this basic 
process. Transcription through a nucleosome in vitro requires the ATPase 
remodels structure of chromatin (RSC) and the histone chaperone nucleosome 
assembly protein 1 (NAP1). In the presence of NAP1, RSC generates a hexasome. 
Despite the propensity of RSC to evict histones, NAP1 reprograms the reaction 
such that the hexasome is retained on the template during multiple rounds of 
transcription. This work has implications toward understanding the mechanism of 
pol II elongation on chromatin.
