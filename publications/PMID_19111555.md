Surfaces of many binding domains are plastic, enabling them to interact with 
multiple targets. An understanding of how they bind and recognize their partners 
is therefore predicated on characterizing such dynamic interfaces. Yet, these 
interfaces are difficult to study by standard biophysical techniques that often 
'freeze' out conformations or that produce data averaged over an ensemble of 
conformers. In this study, we used NMR spectroscopy to study the interaction 
between the C-terminal SH3 domain of CIN85 and ubiquitin that involves the 
'classical' binding sites of these proteins. Notably, chemical shift titration 
data of one target with another and relaxation dispersion data that report on 
millisecond time scale exchange processes are both well fit to a simple binding 
model in which free protein is in equilibrium with a single bound conformation. 
However, dissociation constants and chemical shift differences between free and 
bound states measured from both classes of experiment are in disagreement. It is 
shown that the data can be reconciled by considering three-state binding models 
involving two distinct bound conformations. By combining titration and 
dispersion data, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the three-state binding 
reaction are obtained along with chemical shifts for each state. A picture 
emerges in which one bound conformer has increased entropy and enthalpy relative 
to the second and chemical shifts similar to that of the free state, suggesting 
a less packed interface. This study provides an example of the interplay between 
entropy and enthalpy to fine-tune molecular interactions involving the same 
binding surfaces.
