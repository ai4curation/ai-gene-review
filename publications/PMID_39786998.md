tRNA modifications are critical for several aspects of their functions, 
including decoding, folding, and stability. Using a multifaceted approach 
encompassing eCLIP-seq and nanopore tRNA-seq, we show that the human tRNA 
methyltransferase TRMT1L interacts with the component of the Rix1 ribosome 
biogenesis complex and binds to the 28S rRNA as well as to a subset of tRNAs. 
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRMT1L is responsible for catalyzing 
N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m22G) solely at position 27 of tRNA-Tyr-GUA. 
Surprisingly, TRMT1L depletion also impaired the deposition of 
3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine (acp3U) and dihydrouridine on tRNA-Tyr-GUA, 
Cys-GCA, and Ala-CGC. TRMT1L knockout cells have a marked decrease in 
tRNA-Tyr-GUA levels, coinciding with a reduction in global translation rates and 
hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Our results establish TRMT1L as the 
elusive methyltransferase catalyzing the m22G27 modification on tRNA Tyr, 
resolving a long-standing gap of knowledge and highlighting its potential role 
in a tRNA modification circuit crucial for translation regulation and stress 
response.
