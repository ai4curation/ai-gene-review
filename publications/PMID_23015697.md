Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a leading cause of respiratory infections in 
pediatric populations globally, with no prophylactic or therapeutic measures. 
Recently, a recombinant hMPV lacking the M2-2 protein (rhMPV-ΔM2-2) demonstrated 
reduced replication in the respiratory tract of animal models, making it a 
promising live vaccine candidate. However, the exact nature of the interaction 
between the M2-2 protein and host cells that regulates viral 
infection/propagation is largely unknown. By taking advantage of the available 
reverse genetics system and ectopic expression system for viral protein, we 
found that M2-2 not only promotes viral gene transcription and replication but 
subverts host innate immunity, therefore identifying M2-2 as a novel virulence 
factor, in addition to the previously described hMPV G protein. Since we have 
shown that the RIG-I/MAVS pathway plays an important role in hMPV-induced 
signaling in airway epithelial cells, we investigated whether M2-2 antagonizes 
the host cellular responses by targeting this pathway. Reporter gene assays and 
coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that M2-2 targets MAVS, an inhibitory 
mechanism different from what we previously reported for hMPV G, which affects 
RIG-I- but not MAVS-dependent gene transcription. In addition, we found that the 
domains of M2-2 responsible for the regulation of viral gene transcription and 
antiviral signaling are different. Our findings collectively demonstrate that 
M2-2 contributes to hMPV immune evasion through the inhibition of MAVS-dependent 
cellular responses.

INTRODUCTION

Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is the first and only identified human pathogen belonging to the genus Metapneumovirus in the Pneumovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae family ( 50 ). It was discovered in 2001 and quickly recognized as a leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients worldwide ( 17 , 18 , 55 ). hMPV encodes nine proteins. Among them, phosphoprotein P, glycoprotein G, and small hydrophobic protein SH have been shown to modulate hMPV-induced innate immune response, the first line of host defense against invading pathogens ( 5 , 6 , 23 , 33 ). Whether or not other hMPV proteins are involved in the regulation of host cellular responses is currently unknown.

hMPV M2 encodes two overlapping proteins: M2-1 and M2-2. The M2-1 open reading frame (ORF) of strain CAN 97-83 is assumed to start with the first AUG at nucleotide (nt) position 14 and encodes a protein of 187 amino acids. The M2-2 ORF possibly initiates with the AUGs at positions 525 and 537, overlapping the M2-1 ORF by 53 or 41 nucleotides, respectively ( 13 , 49 ). The M2-1 protein of hMPV is not essential for virus recovery using the reverse genetic system in vitro , in contrast to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) M2-1 protein, which is essential for full viral transcription ( 13 , 27 , 45 ). The role of hMPV M2-2 protein in regulating viral replication, both in vitro and in vivo , using a rodent and a primate model of infection, was recently investigated ( 10 , 13 , 41 ). Compared to its counterpart rhMPV-WT, rhMPV-ΔM2-2 exhibited increased viral gene transcription and no change in viral genome accumulation ( 13 , 41 ). This contradicts the results obtained using a minigenome reporter system, which demonstrated that hMPV M2-2 protein inhibited viral genome replication in addition to viral gene transcription ( 32 ). The initial aim of our study was to define the exact role of M2-2 in viral RNA synthesis. To accomplish this, we first generated a mutant recombinant hMPV, which has an intact M2-1 and genome length but lacks M2-2 expression, by site-directed mutagenesis. We found that accumulation of viral RNAs, both viral messenger and genomic RNAs, was significantly inhibited by M2-2 deletion, demonstrating that M2-2 promotes viral RNA synthesis.

Virus-induced innate immune signaling is regulated by viral RNA recognition through the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and/or two DExD/H box RNA helicases, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and MDA5 (reviewed in references 1 and 30 ). MAVS, a mitochondrial protein, links RIG-I/MDA5 to downstream kinases tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs)/IκB kinases (IKKs), responsible for NF-κB and interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) activation, leading to proinflammatory and antiviral gene expression ( 43 , 44 ). Recently, we have shown that hMPV infection of alveolar epithelial cells, the primary target of respiratory viruses, induces cytokine, chemokine, and type I IFN via RIG-I/MAVS-dependent signaling, but not via TLR-3- and MDA5-dependent pathways ( 34 ). In this study, we discovered that the M2-2 protein antagonizes MAVS-mediated innate antiviral response.

This new function of M2-2 in blocking host innate immunity was initially considered because of results showing that rhMPV-ΔM2-2-infected cells produced higher levels of beta interferon (IFN-β) and other immune mediators than did rhMPV-WT-infected cells. Although the expression of hMPV G protein (a previously described virulence protein) was suppressed by the lower growth of rhMPV-ΔM2-2, which might contribute indirectly to the enhancement of innate immunity by M2-2 deletion, ectopic expression of G in rhMPV-ΔM2-2-infected cells at a higher level than that of G in rhMPV-WT-infected cells only partially reversed the enhancement, suggesting that M2-2 contributed to hMPV immune evasion as well.

In reporter gene assays, the M2-2 protein, but not other soluble hMPV proteins, inhibited the MAVS-activated IFN-β promoter but not the one specifically mediated by downstream signaling molecules, suggesting that MAVS is a target of M2-2. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies, either in an overexpression system or in the context of viral infection, showed an association of M2-2 with MAVS, further supporting the idea that M2-2 targets MAVS.

In this study, we also identified the domains of M2-2 responsible for the regulation of viral gene transcription, viral replication, and RIG-I-mediated signaling. We found that the first 25 amino acids of M2-2 are critical to promote viral gene transcription but not involved in the regulation of viral replication and hMPV-induced signaling. In contrast, the domains spanning from amino acids 26 to 69 are dispensable for the regulation of viral gene transcription but responsible for RIG-I signaling inhibition and viral replication facilitation. Of note, two M2-2 deletion mutants (Δ26–54 and Δ55–69), which exhibited regulation on viral gene transcription similar to that of wild-type (WT) M2-2, did not suppress IFN-β secretion as well as did M2-2 in response to rhMPV-ΔM2-2 infection, suggesting a G-independent inhibition of host innate immunity by M2-2. In reporter gene assays, these two mutants also failed to block the MAVS-activated IFN-β promoter, confirming the importance of these domains in suppressing hMPV-induced immune responses.

DISCUSSION

The innate immune response functions as a first line of host defense against invading pathogens, as well as a critical component in regulating adaptive immune responses. The effectiveness of innate immune response against viral infection depends on the interactive nature of virus components with the host innate antiviral immune systems, including the type I interferon synthesis system ( 1 ). hMPV is a major cause of epidemic respiratory infections in infants, as well as in the elderly and immunocompromised patients. As it is a recently identified virus, little is known about the role of individual hMPV proteins in modulating host cell responses. Reverse genetic systems were recently developed for hMPV, providing an important tool for characterizing hMPV protein function and for designing live-attenuated hMPV vaccines ( 5 , 6 , 10 , 12 – 14 , 41 ). Currently, recombinant ΔM2-2 virus is listed as a live vaccine candidate, as it is attenuated, immunogenic, and protective against hMPV challenge in both African green monkeys and hamsters ( 10 , 13 , 41 ). In this study, we focused on the possible mechanism(s) underlying ΔM2-2 attenuation. We found that M2-2 elimination reduced the accumulation of viral genomic and messenger RNAs and enhanced antiviral signaling. All of these likely contribute to the attenuation of ΔM2-2.

The ability to inhibit the production of type I IFN appears to be a common feature of paramyxoviruses ( 20 ). Upon hMPV infection, the airway epithelial cells activate the RIG-I/MAVS, but not TLR-3 and MDA5, signaling pathway for the expression of important antiviral molecules ( 34 ) (see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). In the meantime, hMPV is also able to develop strategies to evade the host defense. Previously, we showed that hMPV G protein interacts with RIG-I and inhibits RIG-I-dependent gene transcription ( 6 ). In the present study, we demonstrate that hMPV M2-2 protein also plays a significant role in inhibiting host innate immunity. However, the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory role of M2-2 and G seemed different. M2-2 blocked IFN-β transcription likely through targeting MAVS because (i) the inhibitory effect of M2-2 on RIG-I signaling stopped at the level of MAVS ( Fig. 4 ), (ii) M2-2 did not bind to RIG-I, and (iii) M2-2 interacted with MAVS ( Fig. 5 ), which prevented the recruitment of MAVS to RIG-I ( Fig. 5C ), while G inhibits IFN-β transcription by attacking RIG-I as (i) G inhibits IFN-β transcription at the level of RIG-I as the signaling induced by RIG-I downstream molecules was not affected by G expression ( Fig. 4A ) ( 6 ) and (ii) G associated with RIG-I, which is MAVS independent ( Fig. 5C ) ( 6 ). There are still many questions that need to be addressed for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of MAVS by M2-2. Besides blocking MAVS–RIG-I association, does M2-2 also prevent MAVS from binding to its adaptors? It has been recently reported that the phosphorylation of MAVS is important for MAVS activity ( 54 ); does M2-2 affect the phosphorylation of MAVS? In addition, studying the cellular localization of M2-2, MAVS, and MAVS interactive signaling molecules, in response to hMPV infection, is also critical to dissect the regulation mechanisms in further detail.

The inhibitory effect of M2-2 on antiviral signaling is M2-2 specific, as other hMPV proteins, such as N, P, SH, and M2-1 proteins, did not have similar inhibitory effects ( Fig. 4A ; see also Fig. S6 in the supplemental material), and the inhibitory effect of M2-2 was dose dependent (see Fig. S5) and protein structure dependent ( Fig. 6B ). Collectively, these series of experiments from overexpression systems highlighted the specificity of M2-2 for antiviral signaling.

Compared to WT-infected cells, ΔM2-2-infected cells induced more IFN-β transcription, which was reversed by M2-2, but not by N, overexpression ( Fig. 3C ). As shown in Fig. 3C and also in Fig. S2 in the supplemental material, ΔM2-2 attenuation also led to reduced G expression, suggesting that the cellular responses promoted by M2-2 elimination might indirectly result from the reduced G expression (hMPV G protein is a known virulence factor antagonizing host innate immunity by attacking RIG-I [ 6 ]). However, we found that ectopic expression of G only partially blocked ΔM2-2-enhanced cytokine/chemokine secretion, suggesting that M2-2 contributed to the signaling inhibition as well ( Fig. 3B ). In this study, we also identified the domains responsible for the regulation of viral gene transcription, viral replication, and RIG-I signaling. Of note, two M2-2 mutants, Δ26–54 and Δ55–69, had an inhibition of hMPV G transcription similar to that of WT M2-2 ( Fig. 6C ). In addition, these two mutants promoted less viral replication than did WT M2-2 ( Fig. 6D ), meaning less RIG-I activation, and yet reduced the suppression of ΔM2-2-induced IFN-β synthesis by M2-2 ( Fig. 6E ), highlighting a G-independent role of M2-2 in antiviral signaling. In a luciferase reporter study, these two domains were also responsible for the suppression of MAVS-induced signaling by M2-2 ( Fig. 6B ). Collectively, results from both overexpression and recombinant virus systems complementarily revealed a novel function of M2-2 as an innate immunity regulator and provided additional insight into the attenuation mechanism of ΔM2-2.

The mechanism by which viruses use two distinct viral proteins to target molecules belonging to the same cellular signaling pathway is becoming recognized as a common strategy to evade host immune defenses. For example, the influenza virus uses its NS1 protein to target RIG-I ( 26 , 37 ) and its PB1-F2 and PB2 proteins to interact with MAVS ( 24 , 51 ). In the case of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the NS2 protein of RSV antagonizes the activation of IFN-β transcription by interaction with RIG-I ( 36 ), and we recently found that NS1 protein inhibits IFN-β synthesis by associating with RIG-I downstream transcription factor IRF-3 and its transcriptional coactivator CBP ( 40 ). Why multiple viral proteins are needed to antagonize the same antiviral signaling is currently unknown but is an interesting topic.

The functions of the M2-2 protein have been extensively identified for RSV ( 9 , 28 , 47 ). Deletion of RSV M2-2 resulted in an increase of viral mRNA and a decreased production of viral genome. Thus, RSV M2-2 is involved in regulating the balance between transcription and genome replication. Reports on the role of hMPV M2-2 in regulating viral RNAs are controversial. Recombinant viruses with deleted M2-2 sequence showed enhanced viral gene transcription but no changes in the accumulation of viral genomic RNAs ( 13 , 41 ). A different study using an hMPV minigenome reporter system demonstrated that the M2-2 protein inhibited both viral transcription and replication ( 32 ). In the present study, we observed that hMPV M2-2 elimination reduced accumulation of both viral mRNAs and genomic RNAs during hMPV infection. Differences in the strategies to generate recombinant ΔM2-2 (deletion versus site-directed mutagenesis), research systems, and/or viral strain may account for the observed discrepancy. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to manipulate start and stop codons of M2-2 for gene silencing. Therefore, the whole genomic length of hMPV was unlikely changed ( Fig. 1B ). We also found that reduced viral RNA accumulation by M2-2 elimination is IFN-β independent, as such reduction was present in Vero cells, a cell line deficient in type I IFN genes ( Fig. 1D ). On the other hand, the inhibition of antiviral signaling by M2-2 does not require the presence of viral replication ( Fig. 4 ). In the future, we will continue to dissect domains in further detail. Since the domains after the first 25 amino acids are critical for the regulation of viral replication and antiviral signaling, we will determine whether there are subdomains which can separately regulate viral replication and cellular signaling. It will be ideal to generate a recombinant hMPV mutant(s) whose M2-2 proteins are deficient in viral RNA synthesis regulation but maintain the full function of M2-2 to antagonize antiviral signaling, to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms by which the M2-2 protein inhibits MAVS function. Nevertheless, this study reveals a novel function of hMPV M2-2 protein in regulating host antiviral response, providing an additional molecular mechanism underlying the attenuation of ΔM2-2.
