The interaction between the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and a Gram-positive 
bacterial pathogen, Microbacterium nematophilum, provides a model for an innate 
immune response in nematodes. This pathogen adheres to the rectal and post-anal 
cuticle of the worm, causing slowed growth, constipation, and a defensive 
swelling response of rectal hypodermal cells. To explore the genomic responses 
that the worm activates after pathogenic attack we used microarray analysis of 
transcriptional changes induced after 6-h infection, comparing virulent with 
avirulent infection. We defined 89 genes with statistically significant 
expression changes of at least twofold, of which 68 were up-regulated and 21 
were down-regulated. Among the former, those encoding C-type lectin domains were 
the most abundant class. Many of the 89 genes exhibit genomic clustering, and we 
identified one large cluster of 62 genes, of which most were induced in response 
to infection. We tested 41 of the induced genes for involvement in immunity 
using mutants or RNAi, finding that six of these are required for the swelling 
response and five are required more generally for defense. Our results indicate 
that C-type lectins and other putative pathogen-recognition molecules are 
important for innate immune defense in C. elegans. We also found significant 
induction of genes encoding lysozymes, proteases, and defense-related proteins, 
as well as various domains of unknown function. The genes induced during 
infection by M. nematophilum appear largely distinct from genes induced by other 
pathogens, suggesting that C. elegans mounts pathogen-specific responses to 
infection.
