CONTEXT: Primary aldosteronism is a heterogeneous group of disorders comprising 
both sporadic and familial forms. Mutations in the KCNJ5 gene, which encodes the 
inward rectifier K(+) channel 4 (G protein-activated inward rectifier K(+) 
channel 4, Kir3.4), cause familial hyperaldosteronism type III (FH-III) and are 
involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic aldosterone-producing adenomas.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to characterize the effects of a newly 
described KCNJ5 mutation in vitro.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The index case is a 62-year-old woman affected by primary 
aldosteronism, who underwent left adrenalectomy after workup for adrenal 
adenoma. Exon 1 of KCNJ5 was PCR amplified from adrenal tissue and peripheral 
blood and sequenced. Electrophysiological and gene expression studies were 
performed to establish the functional effects of the new mutation on the 
membrane potential and adrenal cell CYP11B2 expression.
RESULTS: KCNJ5 sequencing in the index case revealed a new p.Y152C germline 
mutation; interestingly, the phenotype of the patient was milder than most of 
the previously described FH-III families. The tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution 
resulted in pathological Na(+) permeability, cell membrane depolarization, and 
disturbed intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, effects similar, albeit smaller, to 
the ones demonstrated for other KCNJ5 mutations. Gene expression studies 
revealed an increased expression of CYP11B2 and its transcriptional regulator 
NR4A2 in HAC15 adrenal cells overexpressing KCNJ5(Y152C) compared to the 
wild-type channel. The effect was clearly Ca(2+)-dependent, because it was 
abolished by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein we describe a new germline mutation in KCNJ5 responsible for 
FH-III.
