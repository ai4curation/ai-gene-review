A combined multidimensional chromatography-mass spectrometry approach known as 
"MudPIT" enables rapid identification of proteins that interact with a tagged 
bait while bypassing some of the problems associated with analysis of 
polypeptides excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. However, the reproducibility, 
success rate, and applicability of MudPIT to the rapid characterization of 
dozens of proteins have not been reported. We show here that MudPIT reproducibly 
identified bona fide partners for budding yeast Gcn5p. Additionally, we 
successfully applied MudPIT to rapidly screen through a collection of tagged 
polypeptides to identify new protein interactions. Twenty-five proteins involved 
in transcription and progression through mitosis were modified with a new tandem 
affinity purification (TAP) tag. TAP-MudPIT analysis of 22 yeast strains that 
expressed these tagged proteins uncovered known or likely interacting partners 
for 21 of the baits, a figure that compares favorably with traditional 
approaches. The proteins identified here comprised 102 previously known and 279 
potential physical interactions. Even for the intensively studied Swi2p/Snf2p, 
the catalytic subunit of the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex, our analysis 
uncovered a new interacting protein, Rtt102p. Reciprocal tagging and TAP-MudPIT 
analysis of Rtt102p revealed subunits of both the Swi/Snf and RSC complexes, 
identifying Rtt102p as a common interactor with, and possible integral component 
of, these chromatin remodeling machines. Our experience indicates it is feasible 
for an investigator working with a single ion trap instrument in a conventional 
molecular/cellular biology laboratory to carry out proteomic characterization of 
a pathway, organelle, or process (i.e. "pathway proteomics") by systematic 
application of TAP-MudPIT.
