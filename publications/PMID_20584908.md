Angiotensin II (ANG II) stimulates renal tubular reabsorption of NaCl by 
targeting Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE3. We have shown previously that inositol 
1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-binding protein released with inositol 
1,4,5-triphosphate (IRBIT) plays a critical role in stimulation of NHE3 in 
response to elevated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). In this 
study, we investigated the role of IRBIT in mediating NHE3 activation by ANG II. 
IRBIT is abundantly expressed in the proximal tubules where NHE3 is located. ANG 
II at physiological concentrations stimulates NHE3 transport activity in a model 
proximal tubule cell line. ANG II-induced activation of NHE3 was abrogated by 
knockdown of IRBIT, whereas overexpression of IRBIT enhanced the effect of ANG 
II on NHE3. ANG II transiently increased binding of IRBIT to NHE3 at 5 min but 
became dissociated by 45 min. In comparison, it took at least 15 min of ANG II 
treatment for an increase in NHE3 activity and NHE3 surface expression. The 
stimulation of NHE3 by ANG II was dependent on changes in [Ca(2+)](i) and 
Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II. Inhibition of CaMKII completely 
blocked the ANG II-induced binding of IRBIT to NHE3 and the increase in NHE3 
surface abundance. Several serine residues of IRBIT are thought to be important 
for IRBIT binding. Mutations of Ser-68, Ser-71, and Ser-74 of IRBIT decreased 
binding of IRBIT to NHE3 and its effect on NHE3 activity. In conclusion, our 
current findings demonstrate that IRBIT is critically involved in mediating 
activation of NHE3 by ANG II via a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases 
II-dependent pathway.

Abstract

Angiotensin II (ANG II) stimulates renal tubular reabsorption of NaCl by targeting Na + /H + exchanger NHE3. We have shown previously that inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-binding protein released with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IRBIT) plays a critical role in stimulation of NHE3 in response to elevated intracellular Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ). In this study, we investigated the role of IRBIT in mediating NHE3 activation by ANG II. IRBIT is abundantly expressed in the proximal tubules where NHE3 is located. ANG II at physiological concentrations stimulates NHE3 transport activity in a model proximal tubule cell line. ANG II-induced activation of NHE3 was abrogated by knockdown of IRBIT, whereas overexpression of IRBIT enhanced the effect of ANG II on NHE3. ANG II transiently increased binding of IRBIT to NHE3 at 5 min but became dissociated by 45 min. In comparison, it took at least 15 min of ANG II treatment for an increase in NHE3 activity and NHE3 surface expression. The stimulation of NHE3 by ANG II was dependent on changes in [Ca 2+ ] i and Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II. Inhibition of CaMKII completely blocked the ANG II-induced binding of IRBIT to NHE3 and the increase in NHE3 surface abundance. Several serine residues of IRBIT are thought to be important for IRBIT binding. Mutations of Ser-68, Ser-71, and Ser-74 of IRBIT decreased binding of IRBIT to NHE3 and its effect on NHE3 activity. In conclusion, our current findings demonstrate that IRBIT is critically involved in mediating activation of NHE3 by ANG II via a Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II-dependent pathway.

Introduction

The mammalian kidney plays an essential role in the control of systemic water, ion, and acid-base balance. Na + /H + exchanger type 3 (NHE3) plays a pivotal role in salt and fluid reabsorption in the proximal tubule ( 1 ), accounting for ∼50% of NaCl and 70% of NaHCO 3 reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate ( 2 ). In fact, mice deficient in NHE3 expression are relatively hypotensive, even when NHE3 in the intestine is rescued by transgenic expression ( 3 ).

The renin-angiotensin system is critically involved in regulation of body blood pressure and fluid balance. The kidney secretes renin when blood pressure is low that stimulates the production of ANG 3 I, which is subsequently converted into ANG II by angiotensin-converting enzyme. The presence of ANG II receptor on the membrane of renal proximal tubules was first reported in the 1980s ( 4 ). Through the binding with its cognate receptor(s), ANG II is importantly involved in fluid reabsorption in the proximal tubules. Substantial earlier evidence from Cogan and co-workers ( 5 – 8 ) has demonstrated that ANG II is a potent agonist of H + secretion and HCO 3 − absorption in rat proximal tubules through mechanisms dependent on decrease of cAMP, increase of [Ca 2+ ] i , and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). It was later shown that ANG II, at low concentrations, stimulates NHE3 activity in renal proximal tubule cells ( 9 – 11 ). Studies have implicated the roles of PKC and c-Src in ANG II-mediated activation of NHE3 ( 9 , 12 ). In addition, ANG II stimulates NHE3 activity through increased exocytotic insertion of NHE3 in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner ( 13 ). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying NHE3 activation by ANG II remain incompletely delineated.

IRBIT was initially identified as an IP 3 receptor-binding protein and was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of Ca 2+ release by IP 3 receptor ( 14 , 15 ). We have recently identified IRBIT as a novel NHE3-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening of a kidney library ( 16 ). Our study demonstrated that IRBIT binds the C-terminal domain of NHE3 and activates NHE3 activity in response to thapsigargin or ionomycin-induced rise of [Ca 2+ ] i in PS120 fibroblast cells ( 16 ). IRBIT mRNA is ubiquitously present in all tissues, but the highest expression was reported in the brain, reproductive tissues, and kidney ( 14 ). These findings prompted us to hypothesize that IRBIT might play an important role in NHE3 regulation in the kidney. In this work, we investigated the role of IRBIT in the regulation of NHE3 by ANG II. Our findings show that IRBIT is critically involved in the activation of NHE3 by ANG II, and this regulation is Ca 2+ -CaMKII-dependent.

DISCUSSION

The proximal tubule represents an important location where ANG II regulates salt and water transport. Although new and exciting developments have emerged in the past decades, the mechanisms by which ANG II stimulates the proximal tubule apical Na + /H + exchanger NHE3 remain incompletely delineated. We initially cloned IRBIT as an NHE3-interacting protein from a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human kidney library ( 16 ). We demonstrated here that ANG II stimulates Na + /H + exchange by NHE3 in a mechanism dependent on the presence of IRBIT. Our data show that silencing of IRBIT resulted in significant inhibition of NHE3 transport activity, whereas ectopic expression of IRBIT potentiated the effect of ANG II. Moreover, the involvement of IRBIT in modulating NHE3 activity was dependent on Ca 2+ -CaMKII signaling, which facilitated the interaction of IRBIT with NHE3 and the translocation of NHE3 to the apical membrane of OKP cells. These results indicate the physiological relevance of IRBIT as an NHE3-interacting protein and its critical importance in regulation of NHE3 activity at least in vitro by ANG II.

A large body of studies has shown that NHE3 is regulated through its interaction with a family of scaffold proteins containing PDZ ( p ostsynaptic density 95, d iscs large, and z onula occludens-1) domains, such as Na + /H + regulatory factor 1 and 2 (NHERF1 and -2), and PDZ domain-containing protein in kidney 1 (PDZK1) ( 21 , 32 – 34 ). In all cases, the PDZ proteins constitutively bind to NHE3, and their interactions with NHE3 were not regulated by hormones or second messengers. One novel finding of this study is that ANG II acutely induces the binding of IRBIT to NHE3 in OKP cells. The interaction between NHE3 and IRBIT was acutely stimulated (5–15 min) but declined to the basal level by 45 min of ANG II treatment. The interaction between NHE3 and IRBIT in OKP cells differs from our earlier work in PS120 fibroblasts where the NHE3-IRBIT association was not regulated by thapsigargin or ionomycin ( 16 ). These contradicting data indicate that a similar effect, a rise in [Ca 2+ ] i by the physiological agonist ANG II and the nonphysiological agonists, thapsigargin or ionomycin, does not result in an identical physiological outcome. The basis for the difference between OKP cells and PS120 fibroblasts is unclear, but the difference might be due to the pattern of Ca 2+ mobilization induced by ANG II versus thapsigargin or ionomycin. ANG II in OKP cells induced a slow rise in [Ca 2+ ] i ( Fig. 5 A ), whereas thapsigargin or ionomycin has been shown to evoke a rapid and robust change in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] i ( 35 , 36 ).

Although the interaction between NHE3 and IRBIT was acutely regulated, NHE3 activity or NHE3 expression in the apical membrane was not elevated until 15 min and instead remained elevated long after the decline of IRBIT-NHE3 interaction. Moreover, ANG II treatment for 45 min potentiated NHE3 immunofluorescence labeling in the apical membrane of OKP cells ( Fig. 4 B ), but not IRBIT, suggesting that IRBIT might be targeted to the apical membrane in a transient manner. Clearly, these data show that there is a temporal separation between the transient protein-protein interaction of NHE3 and IRBIT and the change in ion transport activity.

The effects of Ca 2+ in regulation of NHE3 have been previously reported. For example, endothelin 1 stimulates NHE3 activity through a Ca 2+ -CaMK-dependent pathway ( 37 ). On the other hand, increased Ca 2+ mobilization by low dose adenosine resulted in NHE3 activation via a negative control on adenylate cyclase activity ( 38 ). In our previous study using PS120 fibroblasts, we showed that increased [Ca 2+ ] i by thapsigargin or ionomycin stimulated NHE3 via IRBIT ( 16 ). In the current study, we report that low dose ANG II induced an apparent rise in [Ca 2+ ] i , and the obligatory role of the cellular Ca 2+ response in NHE3 regulation was demonstrated by clamping cellular Ca 2+ with BAPTA or inhibition of IP 3 receptor by 2-APB ( Fig. 4 ). Our data are consistent with previous studies where ANG II stimulates IP 3 generation and subsequent Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum in a variety of cell lines ( 39 – 41 ). However, it is intriguing that NHE3 activity was decreased to a level below the basal level when Ca 2+ mobilization was blocked in the presence of ANG II. This was unexpected as BAPTA or 2-APB alone had no observable effect on NHE3 activity. The exact reason for these observations is not known, but we postulate that ANG II might exert opposing effects on NHE3, Ca 2+ -dependent stimulation and Ca 2+ -independent inhibition, such that the blockade of Ca 2+ mobilization revealed the Ca 2+ -independent inhibitory effect of ANG II. In support of this, it was shown that inhibition of NHE3 activity by high concentrations of ANG II (>10 −6 m ) was not sensitive to Ca 2+ -CaM inhibition but was blocked by inhibition of the cytochrome p-450 ( 9 ).

IRBIT contains a cluster of 16 serine residues within its PEST domain ( 14 ). The importance of phosphorylation of the serine residues within the PEST domain of IRBIT has been shown for interaction of IRBIT with the IP 3 receptor, pNBC1, or the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor ( 14 , 42 , 43 ). Protein kinases phosphorylating IRBIT in vivo remain unknown, but several candidate protein kinases, including CaMKII, casein kinase, and protein kinase A, have been suggested ( 44 ). The decreased NHE3-IRBIT interaction when CaMKII was inhibited makes CaMKII a strong candidate protein kinase that phosphorylates IRBIT in OKP cells ( Fig. 8 ). Although we could not provide unequivocal evidence that IRBIT is phosphorylated by the ANG II-induced signaling cascade, our finding that mutations in either Ser-68 or Ser-68/Ser-71/Ser-74 drastically reduced the affinity of IRBIT for NHE3 suggests for phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the NHE3-IRBIT interaction. The triple mutations at Ser-68, Ser-71, and Ser-74 did not have a more severe effect than the mutation at Ser-68. However, this might not be unexpected in light of a previous report that phosphorylation at Ser-68 is prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation of Ser-71 and Ser-74 ( 15 ). Of note, it is interesting that the mutant IRBITs did not function as dominant negatives blocking the effect of ANG II. This outcome is not surprising, as the mutant IRBIT proteins do not compete with WT IRBIT for NHE3, the mutants should not affect the binding property of WT IRBIT.

What initiates the dissociation of NHE3 from IRBIT? IRBIT is able to interact with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which can dephosphorylate Ser-68 in vitro ( 28 ). Hence, the diminished NHE3-IRBIT interaction at later times could be mediated by dephosphorylation of IRBIT by a protein phosphatase, such as PP1. It is known that CaMKII, as a decoder of Ca 2+ signaling, is able to phosphorylate the IP 3 receptor and inhibits its activity ( 45 ). Given that IRBIT is a competitive inhibitor of Ca 2+ release by the IP 3 receptor ( 15 ), it is conceivable that the phosphorylation of IRBIT by CaMKII, or other kinases downstream of CaMKII, provides a negative feedback loop for the release of Ca 2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum by enhanced binding of phosphorylated IRBIT to the IP 3 receptor.

Changes in surface abundance of NHE3 protein through regulated endocytosis and exocytosis are the primary mechanism controlling NHE3 function ( 16 , 19 , 46 ). ANG II-induced regulation of NHE3 also involves protein trafficking as demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo studies; du Cheyron et al. ( 13 ) showed that ANG II stimulates the exocytotic insertion of NHE3 into the apical membrane of cultured mouse kidney cortical tubule cells; infusion of rats with ANG II increases NHE3 expression in the proximal tubular brush border ( 23 , 47 ). Similarly, we showed that ANG II stimulated apical membrane expression of NHE3 in OKP cells. The enhanced NHE3 surface expression by ANG II in OKP/HA-IRBIT cells and the abrogation by silencing of IRBIT suggest that IRBIT plays an important role in facilitating NHE3 trafficking in OKP cells by ANG II. The exocytic trafficking of NHE3 partially delineates the mechanism underlying the IRBIT-dependent NHE3 regulation. However, other mechanisms, such as phosphorylation of NHE3, cannot be ruled out. There are multiple putative CaMKII phosphorylation sites in NHE3 as well as IRBIT. Together with the interaction of IRBIT with NHE3 and CaMKII, it is possible that CaMKII could phosphorylate both NHE3 and IRBIT in response to ANG II.

In summary, we propose the following model of IRBIT-dependent regulation of NHE3 in response to ANG II ( Fig. 10 ). Stimulation of AT1R activates CaMKII, which induces the interaction of IRBIT with NHE3. The NHE3-IRBIT association is a necessary event for stimulation of NHE3 activity. The NHE3-IRBIT association is transient, and the dissociation of IRBIT from NHE3 is matched by the translocation of NHE3 to the apical membrane of the OKP cells and the increase in NHE3 activity. However, there remain unanswered questions regarding the precise spatiotemporal timing of the dissociation of IBRIT from NHE3 and the necessity of this dissociation for NHE3 regulation. Future analyses are required to address these issues.
