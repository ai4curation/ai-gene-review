We have identified Wnt10b as a potent inhibitor of adipogenesis that must be 
suppressed for preadipocytes to differentiate in vitro. Here, we demonstrate 
that a specific inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3, CHIR 99021, mimics Wnt 
signaling in preadipocytes. CHIR 99021 stabilizes free cytosolic beta-catenin 
and inhibits adipogenesis by blocking induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding 
protein alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Preadipocyte 
differentiation is inhibited when 3T3-L1 cells are exposed to CHIR 99021 for any 
24 h period during the first 3 days of adipogenesis. Consistent with this time 
frame of inhibition, expression of Wnt10b mRNA is suppressed upon induction of 
differentiation, with a 50% decline by 6 h and complete inhibition by 36 h. Of 
the agents used to induce differentiation, exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to 
methyl-isobutylxanthine or cAMP is sufficient to suppress expression of Wnt10b 
mRNA. Inhibition of adipogenesis by Wnt10b is likely mediated by Wnt receptors, 
Frizzled 1, 2, and/or 5, and co-receptors low density lipoprotein 
receptor-related proteins 5 and 6. These receptors, like Wnt10b, are highly 
expressed in preadipocytes and stromal vascular cells. Finally, we demonstrate 
that disruption of extracellular Wnt signaling by expression of secreted 
Frizzled related proteins causes spontaneous adipocyte conversion.
