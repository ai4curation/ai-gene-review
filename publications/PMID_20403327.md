A plethora of growth factors regulate keratinocyte proliferation and 
differentiation that control hair morphogenesis and skin barrier formation. Wavy 
hair phenotypes in mice result from naturally occurring loss-of-function 
mutations in the genes for TGF-alpha and EGFR. Conversely, excessive activities 
of TGF-alpha/EGFR result in hairless phenotypes and skin cancers. Unexpectedly, 
we found that mice lacking the Trpv3 gene also exhibit wavy hair coat and curly 
whiskers. Here we show that keratinocyte TRPV3, a member of the transient 
receptor potential (TRP) family of Ca(2+)-permeant channels, forms a signaling 
complex with TGF-alpha/EGFR. Activation of EGFR leads to increased TRPV3 channel 
activity, which in turn stimulates TGF-alpha release. TRPV3 is also required for 
the formation of the skin barrier by regulating the activities of 
transglutaminases, a family of Ca(2+)-dependent crosslinking enzymes essential 
for keratinocyte cornification. Our results show that a TRP channel plays a role 
in regulating growth factor signaling by direct complex formation.

Introduction

Skin and its appendages provide a protective barrier essential for animal survival. Hair morphogenesis and epidermal development are orchestrated by an array of cytokines and growth factors ( Fuchs and Raghavan, 2002 ). Signaling by these diffusible molecules provides spatially and temporally controlled cellular programs for keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, migration, and finally, terminal differentiation and cornification. TGF-α and EGF are related autocrine/paracrine growth factors that activate the EGF receptor (EGFR; ErbB1) to regulate the balance between keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation ( Schneider et al., 2008 ). Defective TGF-α/EGFR signaling leads to abnormal hair morphogenesis, manifested by the “wavy hair” and “curly whiskers” phenotype of spontaneous loss-of-function mouse mutations in TGF-α (named waved-1 or wa1 ) and in the EGFR (named waved-2 or wa2 ), respectively ( Ballaro et al., 2005 ; Luetteke et al., 1994 ; Luetteke et al., 1993 ; Mann et al., 1993 ; Murillas et al., 1995 ; Schneider et al., 2008 ; Sibilia and Wagner, 1995 ; Threadgill et al., 1995 ). Excessive activities of TGF-α/EGFR cause a hairless phenotype and skin cancers ( Ferby et al., 2006 ; Schneider et al., 2008 ). The mechanisms by which TGF-α/EGFR signaling determines cell ate (proliferation versus differentiation) of follicular and interfollicular (epidermal) keratinocytes are not completely understood.

Accumulated evidence suggests that both negative and positive feedback mechanisms coexist in the TGF-α/EGFR signaling axis. EGF binding triggers rapid degradation of the EGFR through endocytic pathways, but also leads to further production and release/shedding of TGF-α/EGF ( Coffey et al., 1987 ; Peschon et al., 1998 ). This unique auto-induction mechanism may contribute to the effects of TGF-α/EGF on keratinocyte terminal differentiation ( Peus et al., 1997 ; Sakai et al., 1994 ; Schneider et al., 2008 ). TGF-α is expressed in both basal (proliferating) and suprabasal (differentiating) layers of epidermis and in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle ( Coffey et al., 1987 ; Luetteke et al., 1993 ; Mann et al., 1993 ; Schneider et al., 2008 ). Although most highly expressed in the basal layer, suprabasal keratinocytes also express EGFR ( Luetteke et al., 1993 ; Mann et al., 1993 ; Schneider et al., 2008 ). While induction of differentiation dramatically increases the production of TGF-α/EGF ( Denning et al., 2000 ), these same growth factors promote terminal differentiation ( Wakita and Takigawa, 1999 ).

Previous studies suggest that TGF-α/EGF regulate keratinocyte terminal differentiation likely in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner ( Denning et al., 2000 ; Sakai et al., 1994 ). Intracellular Ca 2+ regulates both expression and shedding from the membrane-tethered precursors of EGFR ligands ( Denning et al., 2000 ; Horiuchi et al., 2007 ). Ca 2+ ionophores are sufficient to induce both production and release of TGF-α ( Horiuchi et al., 2007 ; Pandiella and Massague, 1991 ). The Ca 2+ influx pathway under physiological conditions, however, has not been identified.

The cornified cell envelope (CE) is a protein-lipid layer that replaces the plasma membrane of terminally-differentiated keratinocytes (corneocytes), and is crucial for the stratum corneum epidermal barrier ( Lorand and Graham, 2003 ). The CE is a complex layer of lipids attached to a layer of cross-linked proteins. The transglutaminases (TGases) primarily form ε-(γ-glutamyl) lysine isopeptide bonds between proteins and their activities strongly depend on intracellular Ca 2+ levels ( Lorand and Graham, 2003 ). EGF can acutely activate TGases to induce CE formation and keratinocyte terminal differentiation ( Lorand and Graham, 2003 ). Cornification-promoting cellular cues may activate an unidentified Ca 2+ influx channel to induce TGase activity and subsequent CE formation.

Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) proteins are a large family of Ca 2+ -permeable channels with diverse functions ( Montell, 2005 ; Nilius et al., 2007 ; Ramsey et al., 2006 ). Among these, TRPV3 and TRPV4 are functionally expressed in keratinocytes ( Chung et al., 2004 ; Moqrich et al., 2005 ). These channels detect ambient temperature changes and are activated by various plant-derived and synthetic compounds ( Moqrich et al., 2005 ; Xu et al., 2006 ). In this study, we find that TRPV3-deficient mice exhibit hair phenotypes similar to wa1 and wa2 . Molecular and biochemical analyses of TRPV3-deficient mice and isolated keratinocytes reveal defective TGF-α/EGFR signaling. We propose that TRPV3 is a Ca 2+ entry pathway tightly associated with the TGF-α/EGFR signaling complex orchestrating keratinocyte terminal differentiation.

Discussion

Intracellular Ca 2+ regulates both the production and release of EGFR ligands ( Denning et al., 2000 ; Dlugosz et al., 1994 ). Since TGF-α production/release is an auto-induction process ( Coffey et al., 1987 ), the reduced production of TGF-α might result from reduced EGFR activity. The positive feedback loop ( Fig. 7 ) in which TGF-α/EGFR activation potentiates TRPV3-mediated Ca 2+ entry, which in turn potentiates TGF-α/EGFR signaling, may provide an explanation for its unique property of auto-induction ( Coffey et al., 1987 ). Ca 2+ -induced differentiation dramatically increases TGF-α production, suggesting a non-proliferative role of the TGF-α/EGFR signaling axis ( Denning et al., 2000 ). On the other hand, EGF/TGF-α itself is known to promote late terminal differentiation both in vitro and in vivo, by dramatically increasing TGase activity and CE formation while suppressing the expression of K10 ( Dlugosz et al., 1994 ; Wakita and Takigawa, 1999 ). Thus, for suprabasal cells, the function of EGFR signaling is to promote late terminal differentiation ( Wakita and Takigawa, 1999 ). The primary defect in V3 KO mice is late terminal differentiation, but not proliferation. Thus, the feed-forward mechanism described above may contribute to the process of late terminal differentiation.

It is still not clear how TRPV3 is activated to trigger or promote late terminal differentiation. Temperatures in the range of 31–39 °C activate TRPV3 in heterologous expression systems ( Ramsey et al., 2006 ). Thus temperature may be the primary activator for keratinocyte TRPV3. Consistent with this notion, temperature is known to affect the barrier function and modulate the effect of EGF/TGF-α on keratinocyte differentiation ( Denda et al., 2007 ; Ponec et al., 1997 ). At skin temperatures in vivo (~32 °C), TRPV3 is constitutively but weakly active. Thus release of TGF-α may increase the activity of weakly constitutively active TRPV3.

We provide evidence that TRPV3 and TGF-α/EGFR are in the same signaling complex regulating epidermal homeostasis. While loss-of-function in TGF-α/EGFR leads to “wavy hair” ( Luetteke et al., 1994 ; Luetteke et al., 1993 ; Mann et al., 1993 ; Schneider et al., 2008 ; Sibilia and Wagner, 1995 ; Threadgill et al., 1995 ), elevated TGF-α/EGFR activities cause a “hairless” phenotype ( Ferby et al., 2006 ; Schneider et al., 2008 ; Wang et al., 2006 ). Interestingly, while our V3 KO mice exhibit “wavy hair”, mice carrying a gain-of-function mutation in TRPV3 are hairless ( Asakawa et al., 2006 ). It may prove informative to generate transgenic mice with TRPV3 loss-of-function and concurrent TGF-α/EGFR gain-of-function, or with TRPV3 gain-of-function and concurrent TGF-α/EGFR loss-of-function.

The EGFR is the prototype of the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) family. EGFR signaling is necessary for proper development and tissue homeostasis while its dysregulation rapidly results in defects in cellular proliferation and differentiation. The consequences of its malfunction are abnormal hair follicle morphogenesis, impaired would healing, and tumorigenesis ( Schneider et al., 2008 ). We have identified another key element in this important signaling pathway, the TRPV3 channel. Our studies not only provide the first in vivo evidence in mammals for the close interaction of RTK and TRP channels, but also suggest that TRPV3 can be a novel target for hair growth and removal agents, and as well as in treatment of skin cancers or other dermatological diseases.
