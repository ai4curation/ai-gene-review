Mitochondria are epicentres of eukaryotic metabolism and bioenergetics. 
Pioneering efforts in recent decades have established the core protein 
componentry of these organelles1 and have linked their dysfunction to more than 
150 distinct disorders2,3. Still, hundreds of mitochondrial proteins lack clear 
functions4, and the underlying genetic basis for approximately 40% of 
mitochondrial disorders remains unresolved5. Here, to establish a more complete 
functional compendium of human mitochondrial proteins, we profiled more than 200 
CRISPR-mediated HAP1 cell knockout lines using mass spectrometry-based 
multiomics analyses. This effort generated approximately 8.3 million distinct 
biomolecule measurements, providing a deep survey of the cellular responses to 
mitochondrial perturbations and laying a foundation for mechanistic 
investigations into protein function. Guided by these data, we discovered that 
PIGY upstream open reading frame (PYURF) is an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent 
methyltransferase chaperone that supports both complex I assembly and coenzyme Q 
biosynthesis and is disrupted in a previously unresolved multisystemic 
mitochondrial disorder. We further linked the putative zinc transporter SLC30A9 
to mitochondrial ribosomes and OxPhos integrity and established RAB5IF as the 
second gene harbouring pathogenic variants that cause cerebrofaciothoracic 
dysplasia. Our data, which can be explored through the interactive online 
MITOMICS.app resource, suggest biological roles for many other orphan 
mitochondrial proteins that still lack robust functional characterization and 
define a rich cell signature of mitochondrial dysfunction that can support the 
genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases.
