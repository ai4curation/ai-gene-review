p53 maintains genome integrity either by regulating the transcription of genes 
involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair or by interacting with partner 
proteins. Here we provide evidence for a direct physical interaction between the 
tumor suppressors p53 and BRCA2. We found that the transactivation domain of p53 
made specific interactions with the C-terminal 
oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding-fold domains of BRCA2 (BRCA2(CTD)). A 
second distinct site situated on the p53 DNA-binding domain, bound to a region 
containing BRC repeats of BRCA2 (BRCA2([BRC1-8])) and may contribute 
synergistically for high affinity association of intact full-length proteins. 
Overexpression of BRCA2 and BRCA2(CTD) suppressed the transcriptional activity 
of p53 with a concomitant reduction in the expression of p53-target genes such 
as Bax and p21. Consequently, p53-mediated apoptosis was significantly 
attenuated by BRCA2. The observed physical association of p53 and BRCA2 may have 
important functional implications in the p53 transactivation-independent 
suppression of homologous recombination and suggests a possible interregulatory 
role for both proteins in apoptosis and DNA repair.
