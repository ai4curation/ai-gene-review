Transcriptional responses to interferon (IFN) are mediated by tyrosine 
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors of the signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) family. The Stat1 protein is 
required for all transcriptional responses to IFN (both type I and type II). 
Responses to type I IFN (alpha and beta) also require Stat2 and the IFN 
regulatory factor family protein p48, which form a heterotrimeric transcription 
complex with Stat1 termed ISGF3. Stat1 homodimers formed in response to 
IFN-gamma treatment can also interact with p48 and function as transcriptional 
activators. We now show that Stat2 is capable of forming a stable homodimer that 
interacts with p48, can be recruited to DNA, and can activate transcription, 
raising a question of why Stat1 is required. Analysis of the transcriptional 
competence, affinity, and specificity of Stat2-p48 complexes compared with other 
Stat protein-containing transcription factor complexes suggests distinct roles 
for each component. Although Stat2 is a potent transactivator, it does not 
interact stably with DNA in complex with p48 alone. Adding Stat1 increases the 
affinity and alters the sequence selectivity of p48-DNA interactions by 
contacting a half-site of its palindromic recognition motif adjacent to a p48 
interaction sequence. Thus, ISGF3 assembly involves p48 functioning as an 
adaptor protein to recruit Stat1 and Stat2 to an IFN-alpha-stimulated response 
element, Stat2 contributes a potent transactivation domain but is unable to 
directly contact DNA, while Stat1 stabilizes the heteromeric complex by 
contacting DNA directly.

The binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to genomic enhancers activates gene expression in mammalian cells. However, the molecular details that link enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state, and gene expression levels remain opaque. We applied single-molecule footprinting (SMF) to measure the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes, and components of the transcription machinery on engineered enhancer/promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic and an endogenous TF. We find that activation domains enhance a TFâ€™s capacity to compete with nucleosomes for binding to DNA in a BAF-dependent manner, TF binding on nucleosome-free DNA is consistent with independent binding between TFs, and average TF occupancy linearly contributes to promoter activation rates. We also decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms, which can be tuned and perturbed independently. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the binding microstates observed at the enhancer and subsequent time-dependent gene expression. This work provides a template for quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene activation, including the activity of chromatin remodelers, TF activation domains, chromatin acetylation, TF concentration, TF binding affinity, and TF binding site configuration.
