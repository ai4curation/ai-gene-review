AIM: To investigate the clinical significance of BMP and activin membrane-bound 
inhibitor (BAMBI) which is a pseudoreceptor of transforming growth factor-beta 
(TGF-beta) type I receptors and acts as a negative regulator of TGF-beta 
signaling and expression aberrantly elevated in colorectal cancers (CRCs). We 
studied BAMBI expression in CRCs.
METHODS: We studied BAMBI expression in 183 surgically resected CRCs by 
immunochemical and immunoblotting analyses using a generated monoclonal 
anti-BAMBI antibody. Commercially available anti-beta-catenin and anti-p53 
antibodies were also applied for immunochemical analyses as a comparison 
control.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that BAMBI expression was 
observed in 148 (80.8%), and strong BAMBI expression was observed in 46% of the 
CRCs. Strong BAMBI expression was positively correlated with histological type, 
depth of invasion, lymph node metastases, and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage 
(P < 0.05). Clear associations were found between BAMBI and beta-catenin (P = 
0.035) and p53 (P = 0.049) expression. In curatively resected CRC, 5-year 
recurrence-free survival was 51.9% (P = 0.037) for strong BAMBI expression 
compared to 79.8% for weak BAMBI expression. In the Cox's multivariate analysis, 
lymph node metastases (RR 6.685; P < 0.001) and depth of invasion (RR 14.0; P = 
0.013) were significant indicators for recurrence, and strong BAMBI expression 
(RR 2.26; P = 0.057) tended to be significant.
CONCLUSION: BAMBI was linked to a potentially aggressive tumor phenotype and 
predicted tumor recurrence and cancer-related death in CRC. BAMBI expression 
might be applicable in the routine clinical setting of CRC.

Abstract

AIM: To investigate the clinical significance of BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) which is a pseudoreceptor of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) type I receptors and acts as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling and expression aberrantly elevated in colorectal cancers (CRCs). We studied BAMBI expression in CRCs.

METHODS: We studied BAMBI expression in 183 surgically resected CRCs by immunochemical and immunoblotting analyses using a generated monoclonal anti-BAMBI antibody. Commercially available anti-β-catenin and anti-p53 antibodies were also applied for immunochemical analyses as a comparison control.

RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that BAMBI expression was observed in 148 (80.8%), and strong BAMBI expression was observed in 46% of the CRCs. Strong BAMBI expression was positively correlated with histological type, depth of invasion, lymph node metastases, and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage ( P < 0.05). Clear associations were found between BAMBI and β-catenin ( P = 0.035) and p53 ( P = 0.049) expression. In curatively resected CRC, 5-year recurrence-free survival was 51.9% ( P = 0.037) for strong BAMBI expression compared to 79.8% for weak BAMBI expression. In the Cox’s multivariate analysis, lymph node metastases (RR 6.685; P < 0.001) and depth of invasion (RR 14.0; P = 0.013) were significant indicators for recurrence, and strong BAMBI expression (RR 2.26; P = 0.057) tended to be significant.

CONCLUSION: BAMBI was linked to a potentially aggressive tumor phenotype and predicted tumor recurrence and cancer-related death in CRC. BAMBI expression might be applicable in the routine clinical setting of CRC.

INTRODUCTION

Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a critical process in the malignant transformation of colonic epithelium[ 1 - 5 ]. Wnt signaling promotes the stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin, which in turn interacts with the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and activates the transcription of downstream genes such as c-Myc , cyclin D1 , and Axin2 [ 6 - 10 ]. Constitutive activation of β-catenin-TCF-mediated transcription is believed to be a critical step in the tumorigenesis of various cancers[ 11 - 13 ]. Conversely, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway participates in tumor suppressor activities such as growth inhibition and apoptosis, and this negative regulation is lost during colorectal carcinogenesis, with mutations in the type II receptor, SMAD2, and SMAD4[ 14 - 17 ]. TGF-β also mediates tumor-promoting effects such as growth stimulation, as well as increases in motility, invasion, and metastasis through either differential effects on tumor and stromal cells or a fundamental alteration in the TGF-β responsiveness of the tumor cells themselves[ 18 - 20 ].

The TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways cross talk to regulate tumor biology[ 20 ]. Axin, a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway, activates TGF-β signaling through Smad3 binding[ 21 ], while TCF/LEF interacts directly with Smad3 to regulate the expression of their target genes[ 22 ]. It is also known that β-catenin and TCF/LEF both interact directly with Smad4 to regulate target genes during development[ 23 ].

BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) is a transmembrane glycoprotein induced by BMP signaling[ 24 ] that is related to TGF-β-type I receptors, but lacks an intracellular kinase domain[ 25 ]. BAMBI inhibits TGF-β signaling by forming a heterodimer with TGF-β-type II receptors[ 25 ]. Previously, we found that both Wnt/β-catenin signaling and TGF-β signaling activate transcription of BAMBI and that BAMBI expression is aberrantly elevated in most colorectal cancers (CRCs)[ 26 ]. To analyze the clinical significance of BAMBI, we studied its expression in CRC using immunohistochemical staining. We show that BAMBI overexpression is correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and predicts tumor recurrence and cancer-related death in CRC. BAMBI may be usable as a target for diagnostic and antibody medicine.

Methods

Frozen samples (25 CRCs and 5 tubular adenomas were picked at random) kept at -80°C were thawed, cut into small pieces, and homogenized in SDS lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was estimated using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Twenty micrograms of protein from each supernatant was electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After treatment with blocking solution, the membrane was incubated with anti-BAMBI antibody (dilution 1:1000) overnight at 4°C. The membrane was then treated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Carpentaria, CA, dilution 1:200 000) for 1 h at room temperature, and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL Advance detection kit, Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) was used for development according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The luminescence image was captured and digitized using Lumi Analyst 3.0v (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany), and the integrated densities of each band were quantified using densitometry software (ImageJ 1.37v, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To examine the equality of protein loading, the total amount of protein loaded in each lane was examined by staining with Coomassie blue.

For the immunohistochemical study, 3 μm thick sections were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks containing representative tumor histology. The sections were de-waxed in xylene, rehydrated with graded ethanol, and subjected to an antigen retrieval step. For antigen retrieval, the slides for β-catenin and p53 were placed in 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer, 20% ZnSO 4 solution, and heated in a microwave processor (Energy Beam Science, East Granby, CT) at 95°C for 20 min. They were then cooled and rinsed in 0.01 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The antigen retrieval was not performed on the immunohistochemistry for BAMBI. The slides were then reduced with nonspecific antibody binding by incubating the sections with 10% normal serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After decanting the excess serum, the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with each monoclonal antibody for BAMBI (1:2000 dilution), β-catenin (1:1600 dilution), and p53 (1:50 dilution) in humidified chambers. After washing thoroughly with PBS, the sections were set in a Ventana Nexus Automated Stainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) for immunostaining. The automated protocol was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, which were based on the labeled streptavidin–biotin method and used the I-VIEW DAB universal kit (Ventana Medical Systems); the kit included a universal biotinylated IgG secondary antibody (anti-mouse), avidin horseradish peroxidase, DAB, 0.03% H 2 O 2 , and 0.5% CuSO 4 . After immunostaining, the sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin, and then mounted in a carousel inside the staining module and run to completion. To standardize and confirm the immunohistochemical evaluation of BAMBI, 26 samples of colon carcinoma with tubular adenoma were collected and were tentatively subjected to immunohistochemistry using paraffin sections. Immunohistochemical staining intensity was categorized blindly by two pathologists (T.N, S.S). Most tubular adenomas showed weak immunoreactivity compared to the cancer component.

Therefore, diffuse BAMBI immunoreactivity, which was observed in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, but not in the nucleus, was evaluated as weak expression if the positivity was similar to that of tubular adenomas. If the BAMBI immunoreactivity was far stronger than that of tubular adenomas, it was evaluated as strong expression (Figures 1 and 2 ). No BAMBI immunoreactivity was evaluated as negative.

The intensity of nuclear β-catenin immunostaining was graded semiquantitatively into four categories: negative, weakly positive, moderately positive, and strongly positive[ 27 ]. This evaluation was grouped into two categories: low expression (negative and weakly positive) and high expression (moderately to strongly positive). To evaluate the p53 immunostaining, the nuclear immunoreactivity for p53 was counted in five random tumor areas at high magnification (× 400), and the average percentage of these positive cells was calculated. The p53 immunoreactivity was evaluated as negative or positive expression if the percentage of nuclear positivity was less than or more than 70%, respectively[ 28 ].

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.5 software (SPSS Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The Mann-Whitney U -test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Spearman’s coefficient of rank correlation were used to examine the correlation of BAMBI with other protein and pathological factors. Recurrence-free and overall survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to compare the curves. Deaths without recurrence were included as censored observations. The relative risk and confidence limits were estimated for each variable using the Cox univariate model, using the most suitable prognostic category as the referent group. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was also developed using stepwise regression (forward selection) with predictive variables. The limits for entry and removal were both P < 0.5. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

DISCUSSION

BAMBI was expressed in 80% of CRC tumors, and strong BAMBI expression was observed in 46% of CRC tumors. The region with BAMBI expression matched the region of β-catenin expression, and the expression of BAMBI and β-catenin were correlated, consistent with the fact that β-catenin is responsible for the aberrant expression of BAMBI[ 26 ]. In addition, the association of BAMBI expression and p53 expression is consistent with a previous report that p53 induces Siah-1, which mediates β-catenin degradation[ 29 ]. The overexpression of BAMBI inhibits the response of tumor cells to TGF-β signaling, and interferes with TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in vitro [ 25 , 26 ]. These results indicate that BAMBI expression is one of the critical early genetic events in CRC tumorigenesis.

Strong BAMBI expression was more frequently associated with deep tumor penetration, lymph node metastases, and advanced TNM stage. Patients with strong BAMBI expression had shorter recurrence-free and overall survival, and strong BAMBI expression was an independent factor predicting a lower recurrence-free survival in the multivariate analysis. The nuclear accumulation of β-catenin contributes to the transactivation of target genes, which encode regulators of differentiation and effectors supporting invasion and metastasis (CD44, laminin-52, matrix metalloproteinase MMP-7 and MT1-MMP) and angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor), among others[ 5 ]. In fact, the overexpression of nuclear β-catenin is reported to be an independent predictor of short patient survival time[ 30 - 33 ]. Inconsistent with these reports, we showed that nuclear β-catenin accumulation alone does not affect survival and is not a prognostic factor in the univariate and multivariate analyses. However, we found that patients with both strong BAMBI expression and the overexpression of β-catenin have poorer survival compared to those without β-catenin expression. Smad activation or expression is lost in approximately 10% of CRC occurrences, and these patients have a poor prognosis because of its association with advanced disease and the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis[ 34 ]. BAMBI expression allows tumor cells to escape from TGF-β signaling and activate oncogenic processes such as growth stimulation, increases in motility, and invasion. Therefore, BAMBI plays an important role in the invasiveness and metastatic potential of colon cancers through cross-talk with the Wnt and TGF-β signaling pathways.

Although the available data on the correlation of p53 status and the prognosis of colorectal cancers are controversial[ 35 ], we found that p53 expression status did not influence the recurrence-free and overall survival and was not a prognostic factor in the univariate and multivariate analyses. Nevertheless, patients with both strong BAMBI expression and p53 overexpression had lower survival compared to those without p53 expression. We speculate that target genes induced by BAMBI overexpression may complement or cooperate with those induced by p53 inactivation and thereby contribute to poorer survival.

Although CRC prognosis is stage and grade dependent, cancers with similar clinicopathological features may have major differences in outcome. A large proportion of patients with Stage II disease and some with Stage III disease can be cured by surgery alone and do not derive any benefit from adjuvant therapy[ 36 ]. Therefore, the identification of robust molecular prognostic markers to supplement conventional pathological staging systems is highly desirable. Several molecular markers are promising prognostic predictors for the outcome in CRC, including deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), microsatellite instability (MSI), and loss of heterozygosity at 18q[ 37 , 38 ]. CRC patients with strong BAMBI expression had more aggressive disease and their recurrence-free survival was markedly shorter. In contrast, patients with weak BAMBI expression had less aggressive disease and significantly longer recurrence-free survival. Strong BAMBI expression was tending to be an independent molecular predictor for survival secondary to lymph node metastasis and depth of tumor in the Cox hazard model. Therefore, strong BAMBI expression might be applicable in clinical practice to predict recurrence in additional to lymph node metastasis and depth of tumor.

In clinical scenarios, targeting the TGF-β signaling pathway for chemoprevention and the treatment of human cancers should decrease or abrogate TGF-β signaling, particularly for advanced or metastatic disease[ 20 ]. Given that the TGF-β signaling pathway has a important role in tumor-induced immunosuppression[ 39 ], inhibitors of this pathway may be used to improve natural immunosurveillance of tumor cells or to enhance the effectiveness of active or passive immunotherapy strategies. Our findings suggest that the development of a new active monoclonal anti-BAMBI antibody may offer a great improvement in survival of CRC patients and might also serve as a diagnostic tool for CRC prognosis.
