Early meiotic gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated through 
chromatin alterations. To elucidate chromatin function in meiotic gene 
expression, we have studied the roles of histone methyltransferases in 
sporulation. Three histone lysine methyltransferases, Set1p, Set2p and Dot1p, 
have been identified in S. cerevisiae. We constructed a series of strains 
carrying set1delta set2delta and dot1delta mutations, and characterized 
sporulation process of these mutant strains. It was found that set1delta 
set2delta double and set1delta set2delta dot1delta triple mutations severely 
impaired spore formation. Because set1delta and set2delta affect this process 
additively, we suggest that Set1p and Set2p have overlapping functions in this 
developmental process.
