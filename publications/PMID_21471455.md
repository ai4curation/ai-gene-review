The C-Repeat Binding Factor (CBF) cold-response pathway has a prominent role in 
cold acclimation, the process whereby certain plants increase tolerance to 
freezing in response to low nonfreezing temperatures. In Arabidopsis, the CBF 
pathway is characterized by rapid induction of the C-Repeat Binding Factor 1 
(CBF1), CBF2, and CBF3 genes, which encode transcriptional activators, followed 
by induction of the CBF-targeted genes known as the "CBF regulon." Expression of 
the CBF regulon results in an increase in freezing tolerance. Previous studies 
established that CBF1, CBF2, and CBF3 are subject to circadian regulation and 
that their cold induction is gated by the circadian clock. Here we present the 
results of genetic analysis and ChIP experiments indicating that both these 
forms of regulation involve direct positive action of two transcription factors 
that are core components of the clock, i.e., Circadian Clock-Associated 1 (CCA1) 
and Late Elongated Hypocotyl (LHY). In plants carrying the cca1-11/lhy-21 double 
mutation, cold induction of CBF1, CBF2, and CBF3 was greatly impaired, and 
circadian regulation of CBF1 and CBF3 was essentially eliminated; circadian 
regulation of CBF2 continued, although with significantly reduced amplitude. 
Circadian regulation and cold induction of three CBF regulon genes, i.e., 
COld-regulated Gene15a (COR15A), COR47, and COR78, also were greatly diminished 
in plants carrying the cca1-11/lhy-21 double mutation. Furthermore, the 
cca1-11/lhy-21 double mutation resulted in impaired freezing tolerance in both 
nonacclimated and cold-acclimated plants. These results indicate that 
CCA1/LHY-mediated output from the circadian clock contributes to plant cold 
tolerance through regulation of the CBF cold-response pathway.

Abstract

The C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR (CBF) cold-response pathway has a prominent role in cold acclimation, the process whereby certain plants increase tolerance to freezing in response to low nonfreezing temperatures. In Arabidopsis , the CBF pathway is characterized by rapid induction of the C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR 1 ( CBF1 ), CBF2 , and CBF3 genes, which encode transcriptional activators, followed by induction of the CBF-targeted genes known as the “CBF regulon.” Expression of the CBF regulon results in an increase in freezing tolerance. Previous studies established that CBF1, CBF2 , and CBF3 are subject to circadian regulation and that their cold induction is gated by the circadian clock. Here we present the results of genetic analysis and ChIP experiments indicating that both these forms of regulation involve direct positive action of two transcription factors that are core components of the clock, i.e., CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). In plants carrying the cca1 -11/ lhy -21 double mutation, cold induction of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 was greatly impaired, and circadian regulation of CBF1 and CBF3 was essentially eliminated; circadian regulation of CBF2 continued, although with significantly reduced amplitude. Circadian regulation and cold induction of three CBF regulon genes, i.e., COLD-REGULATED GENE15A ( COR15A ), COR47 , and COR78 , also were greatly diminished in plants carrying the cca1 -11/ lhy -21 double mutation. Furthermore, the cca1 -11/ lhy -21 double mutation resulted in impaired freezing tolerance in both nonacclimated and cold-acclimated plants. These results indicate that CCA1/LHY-mediated output from the circadian clock contributes to plant cold tolerance through regulation of the CBF cold-response pathway.

Discussion

The CBF cold-response pathway is highly conserved among plants and has a major role in plant freezing tolerance ( 1 – 3 , 9 ). Accordingly, there is considerable interest in understanding the mechanisms that control expression of this stress-response pathway. Here we establish that the CBF pathway is subject to positive regulation by the circadian clock components CCA1 and LHY. We show that these factors have roles in both circadian regulation and cold induction of the pathway and that they are required for plants to attain maximum freezing tolerance at both basal and cold-acclimating temperatures.

At basal growth temperature, the transcript levels for CBF1, CBF2 , and CBF3 oscillate, with peaks and troughs occurring at about ZT8 and ZT20, respectively ( 19 – 21 ) ( Fig. 1 ). Our genetic and ChIP analyses indicate that this circadian regulation is caused by the direct action of CCA1 and LHY binding at the CBF1-3 locus—presumably at the EE, CBS, and related motifs—and induces transcription of the CBF genes. In the morning hours, when CCA1 and LHY protein levels peak ( 25 , 35 , 36 ), the transcript levels of CBF1, CBF2 , and CBF3 peak; in the evening hours, when CCA1 and LHY protein levels are low, the transcript levels for CBF1, CBF2 , and CBF3 are low ( Fig. 5 ). The finding that circadian regulation of CBF1 and CBF3 is nearly eliminated in plants carrying the cca1 - 11 / lhy-21 double mutation indicates that no other regulatory proteins are sufficient to impart positive circadian regulation of these genes. In contrast, circadian regulation of CBF2 continues in plants carrying the cca1 - 11 / lhy-21 double mutation, albeit with reduced amplitude and shortened periodicity. Thus, at least one additional regulatory protein appears to drive positive circadian regulation of CBF2 . Prime candidates for this residual regulation are the four REVEILLE (RVE) proteins RVE1, RVE3, RVE4, and RVE8 ( 42 ). These Myb-like transcription factors fall into the CCA1 subfamily, bind to the EE motif, are circadian regulated, and, like CCA1 and LHY, have peak transcript levels at dawn ( 42 ).

Kidokoro et al. ( 21 ) reported that circadian regulation of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 also involves negative regulation. These investigators found that PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 7 (PIF7) binds to a G-box element in the promoter of CBF2 and that this element is required for down-regulation of the CBF2 promoter during the subjective evening. In addition, they found that PIF7 physically interacts with TOC1 ( 21 ). Thus, circadian-controlled down-regulation of the CBF genes appears to involve action of a PIF7–TOC1 protein complex binding to G-box elements in their promoters ( Fig. 5 ).

In addition to establishing a role for CCA1 and LHY in circadian regulation of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3, our results indicate that CCA1 and LHY also act as positive regulators of CBF cold induction. This action is evidenced by the finding that cold induction of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 is greatly impaired in plants carrying the cca1 - 11 / lhy-21 double mutation ( Fig. 4 ). We propose that the gating of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 cold induction results, in part, from positive synergistic interaction between cold-signaling and clock-output pathways, the former mediated by ICE1 and CAMTA3 and the latter by CCA1 and LHY ( Fig. 5 ). If the temperature drops in the morning, CCA1 and LHY are present at the CBF locus and can act with ICE1 and CAMTA3 to induce high-level expression of C BF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 . In contrast, if the temperature drops in the evening, CCA1 and LHY are at low levels; consequently there is little synergy between the low-temperature and clock pathways, and the induction of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 is low, approximating the peak levels obtained with circadian regulation ( Fig. 5 ).

Cold induction of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 during the evening hours also may involve negative regulation. Such regulation would not appear to involve PIF7, because Kidokoro et al. ( 21 ) showed that the gating of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 expression is not impaired in plants carrying the pif7 -2 mutation ( 21 ). However, Nakamichi et al. ( 34 ) found that circadian regulation of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 and the gating of their cold induction do not occur in plants carrying the prr9 -11 /prr7 -10 /prr5 -10 triple mutation. When plants were grown at basal temperature, the transcript levels for CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 remained high throughout the day in the triple-mutant plants ( 34 ). Similarly, the cold induction of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 in the triple-mutant plants remained at about the peak levels observed in wild-type plants regardless of the time of day at which the mutant plants were exposed to low temperature ( 34 ). Nakamichi et al. ( 34 ) concluded that PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 are negative regulators of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 and proposed two possible mechanisms. One is that PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 directly repress expression of the CBF genes. Alternatively, they suggested that aberrant expression of the CBF genes might result from the “circadian disorder” caused by the prr9 -11 /prr7 -10 /prr5 -10 triple mutation. Our results provide no direct evidence in favor of or against the first model. However, the consistently high CBF expression may be explained in part by the constitutively elevated expression of CCA1 and LHY in the triple-mutant plants ( 34 , 43 ).

A final point should be mentioned in regard to the role of the clock in freezing tolerance. Our results indicate that CCA1 and LHY are required for Arabidopsis to attain maximum levels of freezing tolerance at both non-acclimating and cold-acclimating temperatures ( Fig. 3 ). Recently, Espinoza et al. ( 44 ) independently reached the same conclusion; they too found that the cca1 - 11 / lhy-21 double mutation resulted in impaired freezing tolerance. Our results also indicate a mechanism whereby cold-signaling and clock-regulatory pathways are integrated to condition freezing tolerance: the positive regulation of the CBF cold-response pathway mediated through CCA1 and LHY binding at the CBF1–3 locus and inducing expression of CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 ( Fig. 5 ). Taken together, our results suggest that the integration of cold-signaling pathways with the circadian clock may have been an important evolutionary event that has contributed to plant adaptation to cold environments.
