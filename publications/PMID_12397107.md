In C. elegans, a TGFbeta-related signaling pathway regulates body size. Loss of 
function of the signaling ligand (dbl-1), receptors (daf-4 and sma-6) or Smads 
(sma-2, sma-3 and sma-4) results in viable, but smaller animals because of a 
reduction in postembryonic growth. We have investigated the tissue specificity 
of this pathway in body size regulation. We show that different tissues are 
reduced in size by different proportions, with hypodermal blast cell size most 
closely proportional to body size. We show that SMA-3 Smad is expressed in 
pharynx, intestine and hypodermis, as has been previously reported for the type 
I receptor SMA-6. Furthermore, we find that SMA-3::GFP is nuclear localized in 
all of these tissues, and that nuclear localization is enhanced by SMA-6 
activity. Interestingly, SMA-3 protein accumulation was found to be negatively 
regulated by the level of Sma/Mab pathway activity. Using genetic mosaic 
analysis and directed expression of SMA-3, we find that SMA-3 activity in the 
hypodermis is necessary and sufficient for normal body size. As dbl-1 is 
expressed primarily in the nervous system, these results suggest a model in 
which postembryonic growth of hypodermal cells is regulated by TGFbeta-related 
signaling from the nervous system to the hypodermis.
