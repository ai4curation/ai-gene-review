Frataxin (FXN) is involved in mitochondrial iron‑sulfur (Fe-S) cluster 
biogenesis and serves to accelerate Fe-S cluster formation. FXN deficiency is 
associated with Friedreich ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease. We have used a 
combination of isothermal titration calorimetry and multinuclear NMR 
spectroscopy to investigate interactions among the components of the biological 
machine that carries out the assembly of iron‑sulfur clusters in human 
mitochondria. Our results show that FXN tightly binds a single Fe2+ but not 
Fe3+. While FXN (with or without bound Fe2+) does not bind the scaffold protein 
ISCU directly, the two proteins interact mutually when each is bound to the 
cysteine desulfurase complex ([NFS1]2:[ISD11]2:[Acp]2), abbreviated as (NIA)2, 
where "N" represents the cysteine desulfurase (NFS1), "I" represents the 
accessory protein (ISD11), and "A" represents acyl carrier protein (Acp). FXN 
binds (NIA)2 weakly in the absence of ISCU but more strongly in its presence. 
Fe2+-FXN binds to the (NIA)2-ISCU2 complex without release of iron. However, 
upon the addition of both l-cysteine and a reductant (either reduced FDX2 or 
DTT), Fe2+ is released from FXN as consistent with Fe2+-FXN being the proximal 
source of iron for Fe-S cluster assembly.

## Full Text

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are ubiquitous protein cofactors that are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including
respiration, electron transfer, DNA replication and repair, cofactor biosynthesis, and gene regulation [1–4]. The canonical mechanism for Fe-S cluster biogenesis
involves the pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzyme cysteine desulfurase, L-cysteine as the source of sulfur, an iron delivery protein, a
reductant (ferredoxin), and a scaffold protein [5,6]. We have shown that the human scaffold protein ISCU (like its Escherichia coli counterpart IscU
[7]) populates two interconverting conformational states: one that is structured
(S), and one that is dynamically disordered (D) [8]. Human cysteine desulfurase
(NFS1) differs from that of E. coli (IscS) by the requirement for two accessory proteins: ISD11 and mitochondrial acyl
carrier protein (ACP). ISD11 (also known as LYRM4), which is a member of the ‘LYRM’ (Leu-Tyr-Arg motif) family of
mitochondrial proteins [9], is essential both for Fe-S cluster assembly and the
maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis [10]. Mitochondrial ACP is an acidic
protein well known for its role in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (FASII) [11],
but its separate role as an essential component of the human cysteine desulfurase complex that catalyzes Fe-S cluster biosynthesis has
only recently come to light [12]. The desulfurase complex produced by co-expressing
human ISD11 and NFS1 in E. coli cells contains the covalently-bound 4′-phosphopantetheine form of E.
coli acyl carrier protein (Acp) [13]. Because this chimeric complex
has been found to exhibit cysteine desulfurase activity and to support Fe-S cluster assembly in vitro [14], E. coli Acp appears to substitute for the human mitochondrial ACP. We
determined the stoichiometry of the cysteine desulfurase complex as
[NFS1]2:[ISD11]2:[Acp]2 [13], hence-forth abbreviated as “(NIA)2”. The presence of E.
coli Acp and this stoichiometry has been confirmed by recent X-ray structures of (NIA)2 complexes produced by
co-expressing human ISD11 and NFS1 in E. coli cells [15,16].

Ferredoxin serves as an electron donor for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis [17–20]. It has been shown that E. coli ferredoxin
(Fdx) and the bacterial homolog of frataxin (CyaY) compete for a binding site on the E. coli cysteine desulfurase (IscS)
[17,18]. By contrast, in eukaryotes,
ferredoxin forms a larger complex with cysteine desulfurase and frataxin [19].
Human mitochondria contain two ferredoxins (FDX1 and FDX2), whose roles in Fe-S cluster assembly have been subject to debate
[19,21,22]. It was shown recently that both FDX1 and FDX2 can interact with (NIA)2 and donate electrons for Fe-S
cluster assembly in vitro, although FDX2 binds more tightly and promotes more rapid cluster assembly than FDX1
[14].

The full function of human cysteine desulfurase also requires frataxin (FXN) [23,24]; defects in FXN are associated with the neurodegenerative disease
Friedreich ataxia [25]. The homolog of FXN in the E. coli system,
CyaY, paradoxically, is an inhibitor for Fe-S cluster assembly [26]; whether
frataxin stimulates or inhibits depends on the nature of the cysteine desulfurase rather than on differences between human and bacterial
frataxin [27,28].

We provided evidence that IscX (coded by the isc operon) is the iron donor in E. coli Fe-S
cluster synthesis [29]. IscX has no eukaryotic homolog, and while FXN is a
candidate, the iron donor in mitochondrial cluster assembly has not been identified definitively. There are different schools of thought
regarding FXN. All agree that frataxin binds iron [30–35]. One camp holds that FXN is the iron donor [34,36–39]. Another camp contends that FXN is
simply an allosteric effector [23,27,40,41].

Here, by using a combination of isothermal calorimetry (ITC), NMR spectroscopy, and in vitro Fe-S cluster
assembly, we have delved into the molecular details of how FXN, ISCU, and ferredoxin interact when bound to the cysteine desulfurase
complex. Our results indicate that FXN-Fe2+ binds to the cysteine desulfurase complex when ISCU is present and only
releases iron when two factors required for Fe-S cluster assembly are present (L-cysteine and reductant). These findings are consistent
with Fe2+ bound to FXN being the proximal source of iron for Fe-S cluster assembly.

1. Results1.1. ISCU modulates the interaction between FXN and the cysteine desulfurase complexWe prepared the cysteine desulfurase complex (NIA)2 by co-expressing genes coding for NFS1 and ISD11 in
E. coli cells. As noted above, upon purification, this yields a complex containing the holo-form of
E. coli acyl carrier protein [13]. We used ITC to
quantify the interaction of (NIA)2 with ISCU and FXN (here indicating its mature form, FXN81–210).
Titration of (NIA)2 with ISCU resulted in an endothermic reaction that was fitted to a 1:1 binding model with
Kd = 1.7 ± 0.4 μM (Fig. 1A).
Titration of (NIA)2 with FXN resulted in an exothermic binding reaction that was fitted to a 1:1 binding mode with
Kd = 26.2 ± 2.4 μM (Fig. 1B). The
weak interaction between FXN and (NIA)2 explains our inability to isolate the (NIA)2-FXN2 complex
by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Interestingly, titration of the
[NFS1]2:[ISD11]2:[Acp]2:[ISCU]2
(NIAU)2 complex with FXN resulted in an exothermic reaction that was fitted to a 1:1 binding mode with
Kd = 3.0 ± 0.6 μM (Fig. 1C). The
tighter interaction between FXN and (NIAU)2 is consistent with the observation that the
[NFS1]2:[ISD11]2:
[Acp]2:[ISCU]2:[FXN]2 (NIAUF)2
complex can be readily isolated through SEC [13], as was found in several
earlier studies, although the authors did not note the presence of Acp in the complex [23,41–43]. These results
suggest that ISCU modulates and enhances the interaction between FXN and (NIA)2.Control ITC experiments revealed that the heats of dilution of (NIA)2, FXN and ISCU were negligible (Fig. 2).1.2. The same protein face of frataxin binds iron and the cysteine desulfurase complexWe employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between FXN and the cysteine
desulfurase complex (NIA)2. Peaks in the 2D 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC spectrum (where TROSY stands for
transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy and HSQC stands for heteronuclear single-quantum correlation) of
[U-15N]-FXN were identified according to assignments deposited in the Bio-MagResBank (BMRB)
[44] from prior studies [45,46].The addition of 1.0 subunit equivalent of unlabeled (NIA)2 led to severe line broadening of these signals
(Fig. 3A–B) as consistent with formation of a high molecular weight complex, and
the subsequent addition of 1.0 subunit equivalent of unlabeled ISCU caused further peak disappearances as expected for formation
of an even larger complex (Fig. 3C). Titration of a sub-stoichiometric amount (0.5 subunit
equivalent) of unlabeled (NIA)2 into [U-15N]-FXN allowed us to map the (NIA)2
binding site on FXN: the backbone 1HN–15NH peaks that were significantly
shifted or broadened included those from FXN residues D104–S105, E108–T119, D124–F127, K171–N172,
and A204. Most of these residues are located on helix α1 and strand β1 of FXN (Fig.
3D and E).1.3. Frataxin binds Fe2+ but not Fe3+We used NMR to investigate iron binding to FXN. The anaerobic addition of 2.0 molar equivalents of ferrous iron
(Fe2+) led to significant changes to the TROSY-HSQC spectrum of [U-15N]-FXN
(Fig. 3F–H). The peaks exhibiting chemical shift perturbations corresponded to
residues D104–S105, A107–K116 and Y121–F127, most of which lie on helix α1 and strand β1
of FXN (Fig. 3I and J). These results are consistent with previous findings from iron binding
to yeast [33] and human frataxin [48]. Notably, the iron-binding domain of FXN is the same as the region that is involved in the interaction
with (NIA)2 (Fig. 3E and J).Previous studies suggested that FXN binds ferric iron (Fe3+) as well as ferrous iron
(Fe2+) [36,48]; however, in our hands, the addition of a 5-fold excess of FeCl3 did not lead to significant
chemical shift perturbations in the TROSY-HSQC spectrum of [U-15N]-FXN (Fig. 3I, green dots and Fig. 4A–C). Because we saw no evidence for
precipitation of iron, the lack of an effect appears not to have been due to the low solubility of Fe3+ in the
buffer used. To confirm this result, we carried out an experiment in which we mixed [U-15N]-FXN with
2-fold ferrous iron (Fe2+), and then allowed the Fe2+ to be oxidized by exposing the mix to
O2. Significant spectral changes resulted from the addition of Fe2+ (Fig. 4D). However, after Fe2+ oxidation, the spectrum became equivalent to that of
iron-free FXN (Fig. 4E), indicating that oxidized Fe2+ lost affinity to
FXN. Our finding of no interaction between FXN and Fe3+ is consistent with conclusions from a study that used
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) together with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) [33].1.4. FXN and ISCU do not interact on their own but interact when both are bound to (NIA)2We used a similar NMR titration approach to identify the residues of FXN that interact with the (NIAU)2
complex. Titration of 0.5 subunit equivalent of unlabeled (NIAU)2 into [U-15N]-FXN allowed
us to map the (NIAU)2 binding site on FXN. In addition to the set of
1HN,15NH peaks affected by interaction with (NIA)2 (Fig. 3D), another set of peaks exhibited significant shifts or line broadening in the complex containing
ISCU. These peaks correspond to FXN residues I145–T149, N151–S158, K164, R165, and W168, most of which map to
strands β3–β5 of FXN (Fig. 5A and B). These results suggest that the
α1-β1 site of FXN forms the binding interface with (NIA)2 and that strands
β3–β5 of FXN are involved in the interaction with ISCU in the (NIAU)2 complex. A conserved
tryptophan of FXN (W155), which has been shown to be important for ISCU interaction [49], is located in strand β4 (Fig. 5B; W155 represented in stick
format).However, in the absence of (NIA)2, we were unable to detect by NMR a direct interaction between FXN and ISCU,
without (Fig. 6A–C) or with the presence of Fe2+ (Fig. 6D–F). In the presence of Fe2+, we observed transfer of
Fe2+ from FXN to ISCU, but no evidence of interaction between FXN and ISCU (Fig. 6D–F). Thus, we conclude that (NIA)2 provides an anchor for each protein that leads to the
observed FXN-ISCU interaction.1.5. Iron release from FXN bound to the (NIAU)2 complex requires both cysteine and reductantA recent study suggested that FXN controls both the sulfur production and the iron entry into the (NIAU)2
complex [42]. To address this issue, we investigated the iron-binding
properties of FXN in the context of the cluster assembly machinery.Several 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC peaks of [U-15N]-FXN corresponding to FXN
residues in the region of the Fe2+ binding site were monitored before and after adding (NIAU)2. As
expected, they broadened upon formation of the (NIAU)2-[U-15N]-FXN2 complex
(Fig. 7, row 1 and 2).We next prepared Fe2+-loaded FXN by anaerobically incubating 0.3 mM of
[U-15N]-FXN with 10-fold excess Fe2+ for 2 h and removing the excess
Fe2+ by passage through a desalting column. We quantified the Fe2+ bound to FXN after
desalting by using a colorimetric assay [50], and determined the
Fe2+ content to be 0.92 ± 0.15 mol Fe2+/mol FXN. Comparison of the
1H,15N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of [U-15N]-FXN, without and with bound
Fe2+, revealed that iron binding led to shifts of peaks from residues D112, L113, and D115 and the
disappearance of peaks from residues V125, S126, and F127 (Fig. 7A, rows 1 and 3). All these
residues are located on the α1-β1 site of FXN (Fig. 7B, residues in stick
representation). Then a sub-stoichiometric amount (0.5 subunit equivalent) of (NIAU)2 was added to the sample of
[U-15N]-FXN containing Fe2+ and the mix was incubated for 2 h. The addition of
(NIAU)2 led to additional shifts in the peaks from D112, L113, and D115 and the continued disappearance of the
peaks from V125, S126, and F127 (Fig. 7A, row 4). However, when a 5.0 subunit equivalent each
of L-cysteine and DTT were added and the mix was incubated for 2 h, the peaks from D112, L113, and D115 shifted back toward their
positions in the spectrum of iron-free FXN, and, more remarkably, the peaks from V125, S126, and F127 reappeared (Fig. 8A, row 5).As a control, we investigated whether iron would be released with the addition of L-cysteine alone, DTT alone as the
reductant, or reduced ferredoxin 2 (red-FDX2) alone as the reductant. As shown in Fig. 8, the
continued broadening of 1H-15N signals under all three conditions (Fig.
8, row 4–6) indicated no iron release over a period of hours. When both L-cysteine (5.0 subunit equivalent) and
red-FDX2 (2.0 subunit equivalent) were added and mix was incubated for 2 h, the peaks from V125, S126, and F127 reappeared,
indicating that Fe2+ had been released (Fig. 9, row 7).We interpret these results as indicating that the FXN-Fe2+ complex binds to the (NIAU)2
complex without iron release because the iron-binding site (α1-β1) on FXN is shielded from solvent by interaction
with the cysteine desulfurase complex (NIA)2, but that initiation of cluster assembly by addition of L-cysteine and
reductant leads to a conformational change that allows dissociation of Fe2+ from FXN.1.6. Iron delivered by frataxin supports in vitro cluster assemblyPrevious studies of iron-sulfur cluster assembly have utilized soluble free iron(II). We carried out a cluster assembly
reaction with reduced FDX2 as the reductant and FXN loaded with Fe2+ as the sole iron donor to determine
whether this would suffice for in vitro cluster assembly. The results (Fig.
9) demonstrated that iron from Fe2+-FXN and electrons provided by red-FDX2 support cluster
assembly.

1.1. ISCU modulates the interaction between FXN and the cysteine desulfurase complexWe prepared the cysteine desulfurase complex (NIA)2 by co-expressing genes coding for NFS1 and ISD11 in
E. coli cells. As noted above, upon purification, this yields a complex containing the holo-form of
E. coli acyl carrier protein [13]. We used ITC to
quantify the interaction of (NIA)2 with ISCU and FXN (here indicating its mature form, FXN81–210).
Titration of (NIA)2 with ISCU resulted in an endothermic reaction that was fitted to a 1:1 binding model with
Kd = 1.7 ± 0.4 μM (Fig. 1A).
Titration of (NIA)2 with FXN resulted in an exothermic binding reaction that was fitted to a 1:1 binding mode with
Kd = 26.2 ± 2.4 μM (Fig. 1B). The
weak interaction between FXN and (NIA)2 explains our inability to isolate the (NIA)2-FXN2 complex
by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Interestingly, titration of the
[NFS1]2:[ISD11]2:[Acp]2:[ISCU]2
(NIAU)2 complex with FXN resulted in an exothermic reaction that was fitted to a 1:1 binding mode with
Kd = 3.0 ± 0.6 μM (Fig. 1C). The
tighter interaction between FXN and (NIAU)2 is consistent with the observation that the
[NFS1]2:[ISD11]2:
[Acp]2:[ISCU]2:[FXN]2 (NIAUF)2
complex can be readily isolated through SEC [13], as was found in several
earlier studies, although the authors did not note the presence of Acp in the complex [23,41–43]. These results
suggest that ISCU modulates and enhances the interaction between FXN and (NIA)2.Control ITC experiments revealed that the heats of dilution of (NIA)2, FXN and ISCU were negligible (Fig. 2).

Titration of (NIA)2 with FXN resulted in an exothermic binding reaction that was fitted to a 1:1 binding mode with
Kd = 26.2 ± 2.4 μM (Fig. 1B). The
weak interaction between FXN and (NIA)2 explains our inability to isolate the (NIA)2-FXN2 complex
by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Interestingly, titration of the
[NFS1]2:[ISD11]2:[Acp]2:[ISCU]2
(NIAU)2 complex with FXN resulted in an exothermic reaction that was fitted to a 1:1 binding mode with
Kd = 3.0 ± 0.6 μM (Fig. 1C). The
tighter interaction between FXN and (NIAU)2 is consistent with the observation that the

suggest that ISCU modulates and enhances the interaction between FXN and (NIA)2.

Control ITC experiments revealed that the heats of dilution of (NIA)2, FXN and ISCU were negligible (Fig. 2).

1.2. The same protein face of frataxin binds iron and the cysteine desulfurase complexWe employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between FXN and the cysteine
desulfurase complex (NIA)2. Peaks in the 2D 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC spectrum (where TROSY stands for
transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy and HSQC stands for heteronuclear single-quantum correlation) of
[U-15N]-FXN were identified according to assignments deposited in the Bio-MagResBank (BMRB)
[44] from prior studies [45,46].The addition of 1.0 subunit equivalent of unlabeled (NIA)2 led to severe line broadening of these signals
(Fig. 3A–B) as consistent with formation of a high molecular weight complex, and
the subsequent addition of 1.0 subunit equivalent of unlabeled ISCU caused further peak disappearances as expected for formation
of an even larger complex (Fig. 3C). Titration of a sub-stoichiometric amount (0.5 subunit
equivalent) of unlabeled (NIA)2 into [U-15N]-FXN allowed us to map the (NIA)2
binding site on FXN: the backbone 1HN–15NH peaks that were significantly
shifted or broadened included those from FXN residues D104–S105, E108–T119, D124–F127, K171–N172,
and A204. Most of these residues are located on helix α1 and strand β1 of FXN (Fig.
3D and E).

1.3. Frataxin binds Fe2+ but not Fe3+We used NMR to investigate iron binding to FXN. The anaerobic addition of 2.0 molar equivalents of ferrous iron
(Fe2+) led to significant changes to the TROSY-HSQC spectrum of [U-15N]-FXN
(Fig. 3F–H). The peaks exhibiting chemical shift perturbations corresponded to
residues D104–S105, A107–K116 and Y121–F127, most of which lie on helix α1 and strand β1
of FXN (Fig. 3I and J). These results are consistent with previous findings from iron binding
to yeast [33] and human frataxin [48]. Notably, the iron-binding domain of FXN is the same as the region that is involved in the interaction
with (NIA)2 (Fig. 3E and J).Previous studies suggested that FXN binds ferric iron (Fe3+) as well as ferrous iron
(Fe2+) [36,48]; however, in our hands, the addition of a 5-fold excess of FeCl3 did not lead to significant
chemical shift perturbations in the TROSY-HSQC spectrum of [U-15N]-FXN (Fig. 3I, green dots and Fig. 4A–C). Because we saw no evidence for
precipitation of iron, the lack of an effect appears not to have been due to the low solubility of Fe3+ in the
buffer used. To confirm this result, we carried out an experiment in which we mixed [U-15N]-FXN with
2-fold ferrous iron (Fe2+), and then allowed the Fe2+ to be oxidized by exposing the mix to
O2. Significant spectral changes resulted from the addition of Fe2+ (Fig. 4D). However, after Fe2+ oxidation, the spectrum became equivalent to that of
iron-free FXN (Fig. 4E), indicating that oxidized Fe2+ lost affinity to
FXN. Our finding of no interaction between FXN and Fe3+ is consistent with conclusions from a study that used
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) together with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) [33].

1.3. Frataxin binds Fe2+ but not Fe3+

1.4. FXN and ISCU do not interact on their own but interact when both are bound to (NIA)2We used a similar NMR titration approach to identify the residues of FXN that interact with the (NIAU)2

us to map the (NIAU)2 binding site on FXN. In addition to the set of
1HN,15NH peaks affected by interaction with (NIA)2 (Fig. 3D), another set of peaks exhibited significant shifts or line broadening in the complex containing
ISCU. These peaks correspond to FXN residues I145–T149, N151–S158, K164, R165, and W168, most of which map to
strands β3–β5 of FXN (Fig. 5A and B). These results suggest that the
α1-β1 site of FXN forms the binding interface with (NIA)2 and that strands
β3–β5 of FXN are involved in the interaction with ISCU in the (NIAU)2 complex. A conserved
tryptophan of FXN (W155), which has been shown to be important for ISCU interaction [49], is located in strand β4 (Fig. 5B; W155 represented in stick
format).However, in the absence of (NIA)2, we were unable to detect by NMR a direct interaction between FXN and ISCU,
without (Fig. 6A–C) or with the presence of Fe2+ (Fig. 6D–F). In the presence of Fe2+, we observed transfer of
Fe2+ from FXN to ISCU, but no evidence of interaction between FXN and ISCU (Fig. 6D–F). Thus, we conclude that (NIA)2 provides an anchor for each protein that leads to the
observed FXN-ISCU interaction.

1.4. FXN and ISCU do not interact on their own but interact when both are bound to (NIA)2

We used a similar NMR titration approach to identify the residues of FXN that interact with the (NIAU)2
complex. Titration of 0.5 subunit equivalent of unlabeled (NIAU)2 into [U-15N]-FXN allowed
us to map the (NIAU)2 binding site on FXN. In addition to the set of
1HN,15NH peaks affected by interaction with (NIA)2 (Fig. 3D), another set of peaks exhibited significant shifts or line broadening in the complex containing
ISCU. These peaks correspond to FXN residues I145–T149, N151–S158, K164, R165, and W168, most of which map to
strands β3–β5 of FXN (Fig. 5A and B). These results suggest that the
α1-β1 site of FXN forms the binding interface with (NIA)2 and that strands
β3–β5 of FXN are involved in the interaction with ISCU in the (NIAU)2 complex. A conserved
tryptophan of FXN (W155), which has been shown to be important for ISCU interaction [49], is located in strand β4 (Fig. 5B; W155 represented in stick
format).

However, in the absence of (NIA)2, we were unable to detect by NMR a direct interaction between FXN and ISCU,
without (Fig. 6A–C) or with the presence of Fe2+ (Fig. 6D–F). In the presence of Fe2+, we observed transfer of
Fe2+ from FXN to ISCU, but no evidence of interaction between FXN and ISCU (Fig. 6D–F). Thus, we conclude that (NIA)2 provides an anchor for each protein that leads to the
observed FXN-ISCU interaction.

1.5. Iron release from FXN bound to the (NIAU)2 complex requires both cysteine and reductantA recent study suggested that FXN controls both the sulfur production and the iron entry into the (NIAU)2
complex [42]. To address this issue, we investigated the iron-binding
properties of FXN in the context of the cluster assembly machinery.Several 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC peaks of [U-15N]-FXN corresponding to FXN
residues in the region of the Fe2+ binding site were monitored before and after adding (NIAU)2. As
expected, they broadened upon formation of the (NIAU)2-[U-15N]-FXN2 complex
(Fig. 7, row 1 and 2).We next prepared Fe2+-loaded FXN by anaerobically incubating 0.3 mM of
[U-15N]-FXN with 10-fold excess Fe2+ for 2 h and removing the excess
Fe2+ by passage through a desalting column. We quantified the Fe2+ bound to FXN after
desalting by using a colorimetric assay [50], and determined the
Fe2+ content to be 0.92 ± 0.15 mol Fe2+/mol FXN. Comparison of the
1H,15N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of [U-15N]-FXN, without and with bound
Fe2+, revealed that iron binding led to shifts of peaks from residues D112, L113, and D115 and the
disappearance of peaks from residues V125, S126, and F127 (Fig. 7A, rows 1 and 3). All these
residues are located on the α1-β1 site of FXN (Fig. 7B, residues in stick
representation). Then a sub-stoichiometric amount (0.5 subunit equivalent) of (NIAU)2 was added to the sample of
[U-15N]-FXN containing Fe2+ and the mix was incubated for 2 h. The addition of
(NIAU)2 led to additional shifts in the peaks from D112, L113, and D115 and the continued disappearance of the
peaks from V125, S126, and F127 (Fig. 7A, row 4). However, when a 5.0 subunit equivalent each
of L-cysteine and DTT were added and the mix was incubated for 2 h, the peaks from D112, L113, and D115 shifted back toward their
positions in the spectrum of iron-free FXN, and, more remarkably, the peaks from V125, S126, and F127 reappeared (Fig. 8A, row 5).As a control, we investigated whether iron would be released with the addition of L-cysteine alone, DTT alone as the
reductant, or reduced ferredoxin 2 (red-FDX2) alone as the reductant. As shown in Fig. 8, the
continued broadening of 1H-15N signals under all three conditions (Fig.
8, row 4–6) indicated no iron release over a period of hours. When both L-cysteine (5.0 subunit equivalent) and
red-FDX2 (2.0 subunit equivalent) were added and mix was incubated for 2 h, the peaks from V125, S126, and F127 reappeared,
indicating that Fe2+ had been released (Fig. 9, row 7).We interpret these results as indicating that the FXN-Fe2+ complex binds to the (NIAU)2
complex without iron release because the iron-binding site (α1-β1) on FXN is shielded from solvent by interaction
with the cysteine desulfurase complex (NIA)2, but that initiation of cluster assembly by addition of L-cysteine and
reductant leads to a conformational change that allows dissociation of Fe2+ from FXN.

1.5. Iron release from FXN bound to the (NIAU)2 complex requires both cysteine and reductant

A recent study suggested that FXN controls both the sulfur production and the iron entry into the (NIAU)2
complex [42]. To address this issue, we investigated the iron-binding
properties of FXN in the context of the cluster assembly machinery.

Several 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC peaks of [U-15N]-FXN corresponding to FXN
residues in the region of the Fe2+ binding site were monitored before and after adding (NIAU)2. As
expected, they broadened upon formation of the (NIAU)2-[U-15N]-FXN2 complex
(Fig. 7, row 1 and 2).

We next prepared Fe2+-loaded FXN by anaerobically incubating 0.3 mM of
[U-15N]-FXN with 10-fold excess Fe2+ for 2 h and removing the excess
Fe2+ by passage through a desalting column. We quantified the Fe2+ bound to FXN after
desalting by using a colorimetric assay [50], and determined the
Fe2+ content to be 0.92 ± 0.15 mol Fe2+/mol FXN. Comparison of the
1H,15N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of [U-15N]-FXN, without and with bound
Fe2+, revealed that iron binding led to shifts of peaks from residues D112, L113, and D115 and the
disappearance of peaks from residues V125, S126, and F127 (Fig. 7A, rows 1 and 3). All these
residues are located on the α1-β1 site of FXN (Fig. 7B, residues in stick
representation). Then a sub-stoichiometric amount (0.5 subunit equivalent) of (NIAU)2 was added to the sample of
[U-15N]-FXN containing Fe2+ and the mix was incubated for 2 h. The addition of
(NIAU)2 led to additional shifts in the peaks from D112, L113, and D115 and the continued disappearance of the
peaks from V125, S126, and F127 (Fig. 7A, row 4). However, when a 5.0 subunit equivalent each
of L-cysteine and DTT were added and the mix was incubated for 2 h, the peaks from D112, L113, and D115 shifted back toward their
positions in the spectrum of iron-free FXN, and, more remarkably, the peaks from V125, S126, and F127 reappeared (Fig. 8A, row 5).

As a control, we investigated whether iron would be released with the addition of L-cysteine alone, DTT alone as the
reductant, or reduced ferredoxin 2 (red-FDX2) alone as the reductant. As shown in Fig. 8, the
continued broadening of 1H-15N signals under all three conditions (Fig.
8, row 4–6) indicated no iron release over a period of hours. When both L-cysteine (5.0 subunit equivalent) and
red-FDX2 (2.0 subunit equivalent) were added and mix was incubated for 2 h, the peaks from V125, S126, and F127 reappeared,
indicating that Fe2+ had been released (Fig. 9, row 7).

We interpret these results as indicating that the FXN-Fe2+ complex binds to the (NIAU)2
complex without iron release because the iron-binding site (α1-β1) on FXN is shielded from solvent by interaction
with the cysteine desulfurase complex (NIA)2, but that initiation of cluster assembly by addition of L-cysteine and
reductant leads to a conformational change that allows dissociation of Fe2+ from FXN.

1.6. Iron delivered by frataxin supports in vitro cluster assemblyPrevious studies of iron-sulfur cluster assembly have utilized soluble free iron(II). We carried out a cluster assembly
reaction with reduced FDX2 as the reductant and FXN loaded with Fe2+ as the sole iron donor to determine
whether this would suffice for in vitro cluster assembly. The results (Fig.
9) demonstrated that iron from Fe2+-FXN and electrons provided by red-FDX2 support cluster
assembly.

2. DiscussionFXN is a conserved small acidic protein that is highly expressed in tissues rich in mitochondria, such as heart, liver, and
neurons [51,52]. Deficiency of FXN is
associated with the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich ataxia, commonly resulting from a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the
FXN gene [25,52].
It has been shown that FXN binds iron and interacts with the core complex of Fe-S cluster biosynthesis; however, only a few molecular
details of its interactions have been established.We have shown here that FXN binds Fe2+ (Fig. 3) but not
Fe3+ (Fig. 4). Neither the Fe2+-bound nor the iron-free
form of FXN binds to ISCU in the absence of the (NIA)2 complex (Fig. 6). FXN interacts
weakly with (NIA)2, but the presence of ISCU greatly enhances the interaction (Fig.
1). These results are consistent with the fact that it is relatively easy to isolate the (NIAUF)2 complex, as shown
by previous reports [23,24,42,43]. Both the iron-free and Fe2+-bound
forms of FXN bind to (NIAU)2.Chemical shift perturbations of [U-15N]-FXN upon titration with (NIAU)2 revealed that
the β3–β5 sheet region of FXN interacts with ISCU (Fig. 5). Although
previous studies reported direct interactions between ISCU and FXN mediated by Fe2+ in the absence of
(NIA)2 [48,53,54], our NMR results failed to replicate such an interaction (Fig.
6). An iron-mediated interaction would be hard to understand, because the iron-binding and ISCU-binding sites on FXN are
non-overlapping. We conclude that (NIA)2 serves as an anchor that allows FXN and ISCU to physically interact. This view is
reinforced by recent findings on E. coli and yeast proteins [55,56]. Mutations of residues in the β3–β5 sheet of FXN, including
I154F and W155R, are linked to certain forms of Friedreich ataxia [57]. Several
lines of evidence have established that the conserved W155 on the β-sheet of FXN is involved in the interaction with ISCU
[43,49,55,57], and our results are consistent with these findings. Interestingly,
the conserved ‘99LPPVK103’ motif of ISCU, which interacts with HSP70 [58], also interacts with FXN as shown by a recent study in yeast [55].Our NMR CS perturbation studies revealed that the highly conserved α1-β1 site of FXN participates in the
binding of both Fe2+ and (NIA)2 (Fig. 3). The α1-β1
site constitutes an acidic ridge that has been shown previously to bind Fe2+ and to be essential for the function
of FXN [33,48]; mutation of residues on
this acidic ridge have been shown to severely impair the Fe-S cluster metabolism in yeast [59]. Shielding of the iron-binding site on FXN by its interaction with the cysteine desulfurase complex
(NIA)2 may explain why Fe2+ is blocked from transfer to ISCU in the (NIAU)2 complex
(Figs. 7 and 8). Apparently, this shielding remains in
the presence of added L-cysteine or reductant alone (Fig. 8). However, the addition of both
L-cysteine and reductant (DTT or reduced FDX2) leads to the release of iron (Figs. 7 and 8). These two factors (L-cysteine and reductant) are required to activate the cysteine desulfurase
which converts L-cysteine to L-alanine with the generation of sulfur. Presumably, activation of the cysteine desulfurase leads to a
conformational change that allows iron release. Although the present results do not prove that the released iron is picked up by ISCU
and used for Fe-S cluster formation, we have shown that Fe2+-FXN can serve as the sole iron donor for this process
in vitro (Fig. 9). Further studies are needed to determine the nature of the
conformational changes of the core complex that leads to iron release and the steps involved in transferring sulfur and iron to ISCU
for Fe-S cluster assembly. Although our data show iron-bound FXN can serve as the iron donor in vitro, they do not
rule out the existence of other iron sources in vivo.Our results demonstrate that desulfurase activation by L-cysteine, electron transfer from ferredoxin, and iron entry are
closely coupled, as suggested by a previous study [42]. The discovery of a
frataxin-bypassing Isu1 mutant in yeast presented a strong argument against the role of FXN as the primary iron source for
mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis [60–63]. A plausible scenario is that FXN receives a single Fe2+ from a primary iron source, binds
to the cysteine desulfurase-ISCU complex and positions the Fe2+ in an optimal position for transfer to ISCU, but
holds onto the Fe2+ until the cysteine desulfurase has been activated by the presence of L-cysteine and the
donation of an electron from ferredoxin. FXN has been shown to directly enhance the sulfur transfer from NFS1 to ISCU [40,41].Our current model of the mechanism of mitochondrial Fe-S cluster assembly consists of the following steps. It starts with the
recruitment of ISCU by (NIA)2 to form (NIAU)2. Then, reduced ferredoxin (X) and Fe2+-FXN (F)
bind to yield (NIAUFX)2. Binding of FXN opens up the active site of NFS1 allowing the entry of L-cysteine, which upon
conversion to L-alanine generates S0 bound to the active site cysteine (C381) of NFS1. An electron from reduced ferredoxin
converts the bound sulfur to a radical anion (–S•), which is transferred to one of the cysteine residues of ISCU (the
identity of that residue remains in question [41,64–66]). Then an electron transferred from Fe2+
to the radical anion leads to the formation of –S2− and Fe3+. In the next stage, FXN and
oxidized ferredoxin are released. Ferredoxin is reduced by ferredoxin reductase (FDXR), which binds to the same surface of ferredoxin
that binds NFS1 [14,67], and
Fe2+-FXN is regenerated with Fe2+ from a yet to be identified mitochondrial iron protein.
Then reduced ferredoxin and Fe2+-FXN bind back to the (NIAU)2 complex, and the cycle is repeated to
complete the assembly of a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Further studies are needed to verify this mechanism and to determine if
Fe2+ is released from FXN prior to electron transfer or if its conversion to Fe3+ is the
cause of its release.

2. Discussion

FXN is a conserved small acidic protein that is highly expressed in tissues rich in mitochondria, such as heart, liver, and
neurons [51,52]. Deficiency of FXN is
associated with the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich ataxia, commonly resulting from a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the
FXN gene [25,52].
It has been shown that FXN binds iron and interacts with the core complex of Fe-S cluster biosynthesis; however, only a few molecular
details of its interactions have been established.

We have shown here that FXN binds Fe2+ (Fig. 3) but not
Fe3+ (Fig. 4). Neither the Fe2+-bound nor the iron-free
form of FXN binds to ISCU in the absence of the (NIA)2 complex (Fig. 6). FXN interacts
weakly with (NIA)2, but the presence of ISCU greatly enhances the interaction (Fig.
1). These results are consistent with the fact that it is relatively easy to isolate the (NIAUF)2 complex, as shown
by previous reports [23,24,42,43]. Both the iron-free and Fe2+-bound
forms of FXN bind to (NIAU)2.

Chemical shift perturbations of [U-15N]-FXN upon titration with (NIAU)2 revealed that
the β3–β5 sheet region of FXN interacts with ISCU (Fig. 5). Although
previous studies reported direct interactions between ISCU and FXN mediated by Fe2+ in the absence of
(NIA)2 [48,53,54], our NMR results failed to replicate such an interaction (Fig.
6). An iron-mediated interaction would be hard to understand, because the iron-binding and ISCU-binding sites on FXN are
non-overlapping. We conclude that (NIA)2 serves as an anchor that allows FXN and ISCU to physically interact. This view is
reinforced by recent findings on E. coli and yeast proteins [55,56]. Mutations of residues in the β3–β5 sheet of FXN, including
I154F and W155R, are linked to certain forms of Friedreich ataxia [57]. Several
lines of evidence have established that the conserved W155 on the β-sheet of FXN is involved in the interaction with ISCU
[43,49,55,57], and our results are consistent with these findings. Interestingly,
the conserved ‘99LPPVK103’ motif of ISCU, which interacts with HSP70 [58], also interacts with FXN as shown by a recent study in yeast [55].

Our NMR CS perturbation studies revealed that the highly conserved α1-β1 site of FXN participates in the
binding of both Fe2+ and (NIA)2 (Fig. 3). The α1-β1
site constitutes an acidic ridge that has been shown previously to bind Fe2+ and to be essential for the function
of FXN [33,48]; mutation of residues on
this acidic ridge have been shown to severely impair the Fe-S cluster metabolism in yeast [59]. Shielding of the iron-binding site on FXN by its interaction with the cysteine desulfurase complex
(NIA)2 may explain why Fe2+ is blocked from transfer to ISCU in the (NIAU)2 complex
(Figs. 7 and 8). Apparently, this shielding remains in
the presence of added L-cysteine or reductant alone (Fig. 8). However, the addition of both
L-cysteine and reductant (DTT or reduced FDX2) leads to the release of iron (Figs. 7 and 8). These two factors (L-cysteine and reductant) are required to activate the cysteine desulfurase
which converts L-cysteine to L-alanine with the generation of sulfur. Presumably, activation of the cysteine desulfurase leads to a
conformational change that allows iron release. Although the present results do not prove that the released iron is picked up by ISCU
and used for Fe-S cluster formation, we have shown that Fe2+-FXN can serve as the sole iron donor for this process
in vitro (Fig. 9). Further studies are needed to determine the nature of the
conformational changes of the core complex that leads to iron release and the steps involved in transferring sulfur and iron to ISCU
for Fe-S cluster assembly. Although our data show iron-bound FXN can serve as the iron donor in vitro, they do not
rule out the existence of other iron sources in vivo.

Our results demonstrate that desulfurase activation by L-cysteine, electron transfer from ferredoxin, and iron entry are
closely coupled, as suggested by a previous study [42]. The discovery of a
frataxin-bypassing Isu1 mutant in yeast presented a strong argument against the role of FXN as the primary iron source for
mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis [60–63]. A plausible scenario is that FXN receives a single Fe2+ from a primary iron source, binds
to the cysteine desulfurase-ISCU complex and positions the Fe2+ in an optimal position for transfer to ISCU, but
holds onto the Fe2+ until the cysteine desulfurase has been activated by the presence of L-cysteine and the
donation of an electron from ferredoxin. FXN has been shown to directly enhance the sulfur transfer from NFS1 to ISCU [40,41].

Our current model of the mechanism of mitochondrial Fe-S cluster assembly consists of the following steps. It starts with the
recruitment of ISCU by (NIA)2 to form (NIAU)2. Then, reduced ferredoxin (X) and Fe2+-FXN (F)
bind to yield (NIAUFX)2. Binding of FXN opens up the active site of NFS1 allowing the entry of L-cysteine, which upon
conversion to L-alanine generates S0 bound to the active site cysteine (C381) of NFS1. An electron from reduced ferredoxin
converts the bound sulfur to a radical anion (–S•), which is transferred to one of the cysteine residues of ISCU (the
identity of that residue remains in question [41,64–66]). Then an electron transferred from Fe2+
to the radical anion leads to the formation of –S2− and Fe3+. In the next stage, FXN and
oxidized ferredoxin are released. Ferredoxin is reduced by ferredoxin reductase (FDXR), which binds to the same surface of ferredoxin
that binds NFS1 [14,67], and
Fe2+-FXN is regenerated with Fe2+ from a yet to be identified mitochondrial iron protein.
Then reduced ferredoxin and Fe2+-FXN bind back to the (NIAU)2 complex, and the cycle is repeated to
complete the assembly of a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Further studies are needed to verify this mechanism and to determine if
Fe2+ is released from FXN prior to electron transfer or if its conversion to Fe3+ is the
cause of its release.

3. Materials and methods3.1. Protein expression and purificationSamples of unlabeled ISCU, (NIA)2, FDX2 and unlabeled and
[U-15N]-FXN81–210 were produced and purified as described previously
[8,13,14].3.2. NMR SpectroscopyNMR spectra were collected at the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison on 600 or 750 MHz (1H) Bruker
NMR spectrometers equipped with z-gradient cryogenic probes. The buffer used for NMR samples (HNT buffer)
contained 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, and 8% D2O as the lock signal. Chemical shifts are
relative to internal DSS. All samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm centrifuge tube filter (Sigma-Aldrich) before being
transferred into NMR tubes. All sample temperatures were regulated at 25 °C. NMRPipe software was used to process the raw
NMR data [68] and NMRFAM-SPARKY [69] software was utilized to visualize and analyze the processed NMR data.To study the interactions of FXN with (NIA)2 and (NIAU)2, 0.3 mM samples of
[U-15N]-FXN in HNT buffer were placed in 5 mm Shigemi NMR tubes, and 2D 1H,15N
TROSY-HSQC spectra were collected before and after titration of these samples with unlabeled (NIA)2 or
(NIAU)2. To study binding of Fe2+ to FXN, samples of 0.3 mM
[U-15N]-FXN were prepared in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory) without and with added
Fe2(NH4)2(SO4)2 and transferred to Wilmad NMR tubes equipped with
air-tight seals in the anaerobic chamber. Fe2+ solutions were prepared anaerobically by dissolving
Fe2(NH4)2(SO4)2 inside the anaerobic chamber. To study binding to
Fe3+, FeCl3 was added to 0.3 mM [U-15N]-FXN; alternatively a sample
of the [U-15N]-FXN-Fe2+ complex prepared as described above in the anaerobic chamber
was exposed to air and allowed to oxidize. To study the effect of Fe2+ bound to FXN, 2-fold of
Fe2+ was added anaerobically to 0.2 mM [U-15N]-FXN, and a 2D
1H,15N TROSY-HSQC spectrum was taken. Then Fe2+ was oxidized by exposing the solution
to air and bubbling O2 gas into the solution over a two-hour period, and a 2D 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC
was retaken.Chemical shift perturbations (ΔδHN absolute value ppm) were calculated by Eq. (1): (1)ΔδHN=[(ΔδH)2+(ΔδN/6)2]1/2 where ΔδH and ΔδN are the chemical shift
changes in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively.The NMR peak lists relevant to Figs. 3–6
have been deposited at the BMRB under accession number 27171.3.3. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurementA Nano ITC system (TA Instruments) was used to investigate interactions of (NIA)2, FXN and ISCU. Proteins were
dialyzed overnight in the HNT buffer. The experiments were conducted at 25 °C. For the heat of dilution control experiment
of (NIA)2, the syringe (volume 50 μL) contained 1.1 mM (NIA)2 and the sample cell (169 μL)
contained HNT buffer. For the heat of dilution control experiments of ISCU and FXN, the syringe (volume 50 μL) contained
HNT buffer and the sample cell (169 μL) contained 0.1 mM ISCU or FXN. For the ITC experiment between FXN and
(NIA)2, the syringe contained 0.8 mM (NIA)2 and the sample cell (169 μL) contained 0.07 mM FXN.
For the ITC experiment between FXN and (NIAU)2, the syringe contained 0.7 mM (NIAU)2 and the sample cell
(169 μL) contained 0.05 mM FXN. For the ITC experiment between ISCU and (NIA)2, the syringe contained 1.1 mM
(NIA)2 and the sample cell (169 μL) contained 0.1 mM ISCU. For all the experiments, 20 2.5 μL
aliquots of the sample in the syringe were injected into the solution in the sample cell, and the heat generated was measured. The
ITC data processing and fitting were conducted using NanoAnalyse Software (TA Instruments).3.4. In vitro Fe-S cluster assembly reactionThe in vitro Fe-S cluster reconstitution assay was carried out as follows. The reaction mixture (1 mL)
prepared in the anaerobic chamber contained 100 μM red-FDX2 as the reductant, 5 μM (NIA)2, 50
μM ISCU, and 100 μM Fe2+-FXN. Fe2+-FXN was prepared by anaerobically
incubating FXN with 10-fold excess Fe2+ for 2 h and removing the excess Fe2+ by passage
through a Zeba Spin desalting column (Thermo Fisher). All the protein samples were buffer-exchanged extensively prior to the
experiment with anaerobic buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl (HN buffer). L-cysteine (final concentration 250
μM) was added to initiate the experiment, and the sample was then transferred to 1-cm path-length quartz cuvette, sealed
with rubber septa; uv/vis spectra were collected with 5-min intervals on a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer at 25 °C.
The oxidation of reduced ferredoxin is proportional to Fe-S cluster assembly on ISCU (the electrons provided by ferredoxins are
utilized for Fe-S cluster formation). Despite the spectral overlap of the signals from oxidized FDX2 and the Fe-S cluster, the
increase at 456 nm can be used as a means to assess the cluster assembly rates. This was earlier verified by separating
[2Fe-2S]-ISCU from oxidized FDX2 prior to collecting the spectrum at 456 nm [14].3.5. Quantification of iron binding to FXN after desaltingFe2+ was quantified by a colorimetric assay as described previously [50]. 200 μL of 12 M HCl was added to 20 μL of 0.26 mM
Fe2+-FXN after desalting. The concentration of FXN was determined from absorbance at 280 nm with an assumed
extinction coefficient of 30,940 M−1 cm−1. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 15
min. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a 1.5 mL
Eppendorf tube and diluted to 1 mL with water, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0. 5 μL of 0.15 M
1,10-phenanthroline (Phen, Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO was added to the solution, leading to formation of the red
Fe2+-Phen complex. All the above procedures were done inside the anaerobic chamber to avoid oxidation of
Fe2+. After incubating for 30 min, the solution was transferred to a 1-cm path-length quartz cuvette,
sealed with a rubber septum, and the absorbance at 510 nm was recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer. The experiment was
performed in triplicate, and the concentration of Fe2+ was determined by comparison to a standard curve
obtained from known concentration of Fe2+.

contained 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, and 8% D2O as the lock signal. Chemical shifts are
relative to internal DSS. All samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm centrifuge tube filter (Sigma-Aldrich) before being
transferred into NMR tubes. All sample temperatures were regulated at 25 °C. NMRPipe software was used to process the raw
NMR data [68] and NMRFAM-SPARKY [69] software was utilized to visualize and analyze the processed NMR data.To study the interactions of FXN with (NIA)2 and (NIAU)2, 0.3 mM samples of
[U-15N]-FXN in HNT buffer were placed in 5 mm Shigemi NMR tubes, and 2D 1H,15N
TROSY-HSQC spectra were collected before and after titration of these samples with unlabeled (NIA)2 or
(NIAU)2. To study binding of Fe2+ to FXN, samples of 0.3 mM
[U-15N]-FXN were prepared in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory) without and with added
Fe2(NH4)2(SO4)2 and transferred to Wilmad NMR tubes equipped with
air-tight seals in the anaerobic chamber. Fe2+ solutions were prepared anaerobically by dissolving
Fe2(NH4)2(SO4)2 inside the anaerobic chamber. To study binding to
Fe3+, FeCl3 was added to 0.3 mM [U-15N]-FXN; alternatively a sample
of the [U-15N]-FXN-Fe2+ complex prepared as described above in the anaerobic chamber
was exposed to air and allowed to oxidize. To study the effect of Fe2+ bound to FXN, 2-fold of
Fe2+ was added anaerobically to 0.2 mM [U-15N]-FXN, and a 2D
1H,15N TROSY-HSQC spectrum was taken. Then Fe2+ was oxidized by exposing the solution
to air and bubbling O2 gas into the solution over a two-hour period, and a 2D 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC
was retaken.Chemical shift perturbations (ΔδHN absolute value ppm) were calculated by Eq. (1): (1)ΔδHN=[(ΔδH)2+(ΔδN/6)2]1/2 where ΔδH and ΔδN are the chemical shift
changes in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively.The NMR peak lists relevant to Figs. 3–6

3.3. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurementA Nano ITC system (TA Instruments) was used to investigate interactions of (NIA)2, FXN and ISCU. Proteins were
dialyzed overnight in the HNT buffer. The experiments were conducted at 25 °C. For the heat of dilution control experiment
of (NIA)2, the syringe (volume 50 μL) contained 1.1 mM (NIA)2 and the sample cell (169 μL)
contained HNT buffer. For the heat of dilution control experiments of ISCU and FXN, the syringe (volume 50 μL) contained
HNT buffer and the sample cell (169 μL) contained 0.1 mM ISCU or FXN. For the ITC experiment between FXN and
(NIA)2, the syringe contained 0.8 mM (NIA)2 and the sample cell (169 μL) contained 0.07 mM FXN.
For the ITC experiment between FXN and (NIAU)2, the syringe contained 0.7 mM (NIAU)2 and the sample cell

3.4. In vitro Fe-S cluster assembly reactionThe in vitro Fe-S cluster reconstitution assay was carried out as follows. The reaction mixture (1 mL)
prepared in the anaerobic chamber contained 100 μM red-FDX2 as the reductant, 5 μM (NIA)2, 50
μM ISCU, and 100 μM Fe2+-FXN. Fe2+-FXN was prepared by anaerobically
incubating FXN with 10-fold excess Fe2+ for 2 h and removing the excess Fe2+ by passage
through a Zeba Spin desalting column (Thermo Fisher). All the protein samples were buffer-exchanged extensively prior to the
experiment with anaerobic buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl (HN buffer). L-cysteine (final concentration 250
μM) was added to initiate the experiment, and the sample was then transferred to 1-cm path-length quartz cuvette, sealed
with rubber septa; uv/vis spectra were collected with 5-min intervals on a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer at 25 °C.
The oxidation of reduced ferredoxin is proportional to Fe-S cluster assembly on ISCU (the electrons provided by ferredoxins are
utilized for Fe-S cluster formation). Despite the spectral overlap of the signals from oxidized FDX2 and the Fe-S cluster, the
increase at 456 nm can be used as a means to assess the cluster assembly rates. This was earlier verified by separating
[2Fe-2S]-ISCU from oxidized FDX2 prior to collecting the spectrum at 456 nm [14].

3.5. Quantification of iron binding to FXN after desaltingFe2+ was quantified by a colorimetric assay as described previously [50]. 200 μL of 12 M HCl was added to 20 μL of 0.26 mM
Fe2+-FXN after desalting. The concentration of FXN was determined from absorbance at 280 nm with an assumed
extinction coefficient of 30,940 M−1 cm−1. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 15
min. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a 1.5 mL
Eppendorf tube and diluted to 1 mL with water, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0. 5 μL of 0.15 M
1,10-phenanthroline (Phen, Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO was added to the solution, leading to formation of the red
Fe2+-Phen complex. All the above procedures were done inside the anaerobic chamber to avoid oxidation of
Fe2+. After incubating for 30 min, the solution was transferred to a 1-cm path-length quartz cuvette,
sealed with a rubber septum, and the absorbance at 510 nm was recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer. The experiment was
performed in triplicate, and the concentration of Fe2+ was determined by comparison to a standard curve
obtained from known concentration of Fe2+.
