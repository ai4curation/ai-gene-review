The compartmentalization of catalase, fatty acyl-CoA oxidase and urate oxidase 
was examined in the livers of mice, rats and guinea pigs, using the technique of 
digitonin extraction in order to avoid the trauma associated with centrifugation 
procedures. The results are interpreted as indicating that an appreciable 
proportion of catalase activity occurs in the cytoplasmic compartment of these 
cells. Following treatment of the animals with clofibrate, the specific activity 
in both peroxisomal and cytoplasmic compartments was increased, with a higher 
proportion of cytoplasmic catalase being evident in mice. The results for 
catalase were compared with those for fatty acyl-CoA oxidase and urate oxidase 
both of which were indicated as showing a closer association with the 
peroxisomal compartment than was the case for catalase. These data have been 
discussed in relation to their significance on present understanding of 
peroxisomal structure and function.
