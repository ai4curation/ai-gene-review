The p110δ subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) is selectively 
expressed in leukocytes and is critical for lymphocyte biology. Here we report 
fourteen patients from seven families who were heterozygous for three different 
germline, gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CD (which encodes p110δ). These 
patients presented with sinopulmonary infections, lymphadenopathy, nodular 
lymphoid hyperplasia and viremia due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and/or 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Strikingly, they had a substantial deficiency in naive 
T cells but an over-representation of senescent effector T cells. In vitro, T 
cells from patients exhibited increased phosphorylation of the kinase Akt and 
hyperactivation of the metabolic checkpoint kinase mTOR, enhanced glucose uptake 
and terminal effector differentiation. Notably, treatment with rapamycin to 
inhibit mTOR activity in vivo partially restored the abundance of naive T cells, 
largely 'rescued' the in vitro T cell defects and improved the clinical course.
