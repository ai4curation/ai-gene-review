Nonstop mRNA decay, a specific mRNA surveillance pathway, rapidly degrades 
transcripts that lack in-frame stop codons. The cytoplasmic exosome, a complex 
of 3'-5' exoribonucleases involved in RNA degradation and processing events, 
degrades nonstop transcripts. To further understand how nonstop mRNAs are 
recognized and degraded, we performed a genomewide screen for nonessential genes 
that are required for nonstop mRNA decay. We identified 16 genes that affect the 
expression of two different nonstop reporters. Most of these genes affected the 
stability of a nonstop mRNA reporter. Additionally, three mutations that 
affected nonstop gene expression without stabilizing nonstop mRNA levels 
implicated the proteasome. This finding not only suggested that the proteasome 
may degrade proteins encoded by nonstop mRNAs, but also supported previous 
observations that rapid decay of nonstop mRNAs cannot fully explain the lack of 
the encoded proteins. Further, we show that the proteasome and Ski7p affected 
expression of nonstop reporter genes independently of each other. In addition, 
our results implicate inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate as an inhibitor of 
nonstop mRNA decay.
