Phagophore maturation is a key step in the macroautophagy pathway, which is 
critical in many important physiological and pathological processes. Here 
we identified Drosophila N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein 2 (dNSF2) and 
soluble NSF attachment protein (Snap) as strong genetic modifiers of mutant 
CHMP2B, an ESCRT-III component that causes frontotemporal dementia and 
autophagosome accumulation. Among several SNAP receptor (SNARE) genes, 
Drosophila syntaxin 13 (syx13) exhibited a strong genetic interaction with 
mutant CHMP2B. Knockdown of syntaxin 13 (STX13) or its binding partner Vti1a in 
mammalian cells caused LC3-positive puncta to accumulate and blocks autophagic 
flux. STX13 was present on LC3-positive phagophores induced by rapamycin and was 
highly enriched on multilamellar structures induced by dysfunctional ESCRT-III. 
Loss of STX13 also caused the accumulation of Atg5-positive puncta and the 
formation of multilamellar structures. These results suggest that STX13 is a 
genetic modifier of ESCRT-III dysfunction and participates in the maturation of 
phagophores into closed autophagosomes.
