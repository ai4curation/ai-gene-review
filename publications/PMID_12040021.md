Multiprotein bridging factor (MBF-1) is a cofactor that was first described for 
its capacity to modulate the activity of fushi tarazu factor 1, a nuclear 
receptor originally implicated in Drosophila development. Recently, it has been 
shown that human MBF-1 stimulates the transcriptional activity of steroidogenic 
factor 1, a human homolog of fushi tarazu factor 1, which is implicated in 
steroidogenesis. Here we show that this cofactor enhances the transcriptional 
activity of several nonsteroid nuclear receptors that are implicated in lipid 
metabolism, i.e. the liver receptor homolog 1, the liver X receptor alpha, and 
PPARgamma. MBF-1 interacts with distinct domains in these receptors, depending 
on whether the receptor binds DNA as a monomer or as a heterodimer with RXR. 
MBF-1 does not possess any of the classical histone modifying activities such as 
histone acetyl- or methyl transferase activities, linked to chromatin 
remodeling, but interacts in vitro with the transcription factor IID complex. 
MBF-1 seems therefore to act as a bridging factor enabling interactions of 
nuclear receptors with the transcription machinery.
