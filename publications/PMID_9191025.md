We have identified and characterized a homolog of the 40 kDa cyclophilins in the 
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At the amino acid level, this novel 
yeast cyclophilin, termed Cyp40, is 47% identical to human cyclophilin-40. 
Recombinant Cyp40 produced in bacteria has a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase 
activity with a catalytic efficiency (k[cat]/K[m]) of 0.5 x 10(6)M(-1)s(-1), 
which can be inhibited by cyclosporin A with an IC50 value of 60nM. Using a 
polyclonal antibody against Cyp40 we have found that Cyp40 is predominantly 
cytoplasmic, and that its expression is induced 3-4-fold by heat shock. 
Moreover, Cyp40 can be coprecipitated from yeast extracts with the cytosolic 
molecular chaperone Hsp90. Surprisingly, a Cyp40-deficient yeast strain is fully 
viable at normal and elevated temperatures. Cyp40 is also dispensable for normal 
regulation of vertebrate steroid receptors in yeast. While other immunophilins 
could conceivably compensate a Cyp40 defect, our results are compatible with the 
notion that immunophilins may be fortuitous partners in the biochemically 
established steroid receptor-Hsp90 complex.
