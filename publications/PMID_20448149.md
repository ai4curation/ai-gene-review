The thickness of the myelin sheath that insulates axons is fitted for optimal 
nerve conduction velocity. Here, we show that, in Schwann cells, mammalian disks 
large homolog 1 (Dlg1) interacts with PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog 
deleted on chromosome 10) to inhibit axonal stimulation of myelination. This 
mechanism limits myelin sheath thickness and prevents overmyelination in mouse 
sciatic nerves. Removing this brake results also in myelin outfoldings and 
demyelination, characteristics of some peripheral neuropathies. Indeed, the Dlg1 
brake is no longer functional in a mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
Therefore, negative regulation of myelination appears to be essential for 
optimization of nerve conduction velocity and myelin maintenance.
