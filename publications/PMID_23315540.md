BACKGROUND: The genetic complexity of infantile cardiomyopathies is remarkable, 
and the importance of mitochondrial translation defects as a causative factor is 
only starting to be recognised. We investigated the genetic basis for infantile 
onset recessive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two siblings.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of respiratory chain enzymes revealed a combined 
deficiency of complexes I and IV in the heart and skeletal muscle. Exome 
sequencing uncovered a homozygous mutation (L156R) in MRPL44 of both siblings. 
MRPL44 encodes a protein in the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and 
is suggested to locate in close proximity to the tunnel exit of the yeast 
mitochondrial ribosome. We found severely reduced MRPL44 levels in the patient's 
heart, skeletal muscle and fibroblasts suggesting that the missense mutation 
affected the protein stability. In patient fibroblasts, decreased MRPL44 
affected assembly of the large ribosomal subunit and stability of 16S rRNA 
leading to complex IV deficiency. Despite this assembly defect, de novo 
mitochondrial translation was only mildly affected in fibroblasts suggesting 
that MRPL44 may have a function in the assembly/stability of nascent 
mitochondrial polypeptides exiting the ribosome. Retroviral expression of 
wild-type MRPL44 in patient fibroblasts rescued the large ribosome assembly 
defect and COX deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that mitochondrial ribosomal subunit 
defects can generate tissue-specific manifestations, such as cardiomyopathy.
