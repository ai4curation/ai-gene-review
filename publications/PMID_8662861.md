DnaJ is a molecular chaperone, which not only binds to its various protein 
substrates, but can also activate the DnaK cochaperone to bind to its various 
protein substrates as well. DnaJ is a modular protein, which contains a putative 
zinc finger motif of unknown function. Quantitation of the released Zn(II) ions, 
upon challenge with p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid, and by atomic 
absorption showed that two Zn(II) ions interact with each monomer of DnaJ. 
Following the release of Zn(II) ions, the free cysteine residues probably form 
disulfide bridge(s), which contribute to overcoming the destabilizing effect of 
losing Zn(II). Supporting this view, infrared and circular dichroism studies 
show that the DnaJ secondary structure is largely unaffected by the release of 
Zn(II). Moreover, infrared spectra recorded at different temperatures, as well 
as scanning calorimetry, show that the Zn(II) ions help to stabilize DnaJ's 
tertiary structure. An internal 57-amino acid deletion of the cysteine-reach 
region did not noticeably affect the affinity of this mutant protein, 
DnaJDelta144-200, to bind DnaK nor its ability to stimulate DnaK's ATPase 
activity. However, the DnaJDelta144-200 was unable to induce DnaK to a 
conformation required for the stabilization of the DnaK-substrate complex. 
Additionally, the DnaJDelta144-200 mutant protein alone was unimpaired in its 
ability to interact with its final sigma32 transcription factor substrate, but 
exhibited reduced affinity toward its P1 RepA and lambdaP substrates. Finally, 
these in vitro results correlate well with the in vivo observed partial 
inhibition of bacteriophage lambda growth in a DnaJDelta144-200 mutant 
background.
