TGF-beta signaling involves a wide array of signaling molecules and multiple 
controlling events. Scaffold proteins create a functional proximity of signaling 
molecules and control the specificity of signal transduction. While many 
components involved in the TGF-beta pathway have been elucidated, little is 
known about how those components are coordinated by scaffold proteins. Here, we 
show that Axin activates TGF-beta signaling by forming a multimeric complex 
consisting of Smad7 and ubiquitin E3 ligase Arkadia. Axin depends on Arkadia to 
facilitate TGF-beta signaling, as their small interfering RNAs reciprocally 
abolished the stimulatory effect on TGF-beta signaling. Specific knockdown of 
Axin or Arkadia revealed that Axin and Arkadia cooperate with each other in 
promoting Smad7 ubiquitination. Pulse-chase experiments further illustrated that 
Axin significantly decreased the half-life of Smad7. Axin also induces nuclear 
export of Smad7. Interestingly, Axin associates with Arkadia and Smad7 
independently of TGF-beta signal, in contrast to its transient association with 
inactive Smad3. However, coexpression of Wnt-1 reduced Smad7 ubiquitination by 
downregulating Axin levels, underscoring the importance of Axin as an intrinsic 
regulator in TGF-beta signaling.
