The goal of this study was to discover novel partners for perlecan, a major 
heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes, and to examine new 
interactions through which perlecan may influence cell behavior. We employed the 
yeast two-hybrid system and used perlecan domain V as bait to screen a human 
keratinocyte cDNA library. Among the strongest interacting clones, we isolated a 
approximately 1.6-kb cDNA insert that encoded extracellular matrix protein 1 
(ECM1), a secreted glycoprotein involved in bone formation and angiogenesis. The 
sequencing of the clone revealed the existence of a novel splice variant that we 
name ECM1c. The interaction was validated by co-immunoprecipitation studies, 
using both cell-free systems and mammalian cells, and the specific binding site 
within each molecule was identified employing various deletion mutants. The C 
terminus of ECM1 interacted specifically with the epidermal growth factor-like 
modules flanking the LG2 subdomain of perlecan domain V. Perlecan and ECM1 were 
also co-expressed by a variety of normal and transformed cells, and 
immunohistochemical studies showed a partial expression overlap, particularly 
around dermal blood vessels and adnexal epithelia. ECM1 has been shown to 
regulate endochondral bone formation, stimulate the proliferation of endothelial 
cells, and induce angiogenesis. Similarly, perlecan plays an important role in 
chondrogenesis and skeletal development, as well as harboring pro- and 
anti-angiogenic activities. Thus, a physiological interaction could also occur 
in vivo during development and in pathological events, including tissue 
remodeling and tumor progression.
