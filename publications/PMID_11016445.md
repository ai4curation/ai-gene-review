Fructosamines are thought to play an important role in the development of 
diabetic complications. Little is known about reactions that could metabolize 
these compounds in mammalian tissues, except for recent indications that they 
can be converted to fructosamine 3-phosphates. The purpose of the present work 
was to identify and characterize the enzyme responsible for this conversion. 
Erythrocyte extracts were found to catalyze the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of 
1-deoxy-1-morpholinofructose (DMF), a synthetic fructosamine. The enzyme 
responsible for this conversion was purified approximately 2,500-fold by 
chromatography on Blue Sepharose, Q Sepharose, and Sephacryl S-200 and shown to 
copurify with a 35,000-M(r) protein. Partial sequences of tryptic peptides were 
derived from the protein by nanoelectrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, which 
allowed for the identification of the corresponding human and mouse cDNAs. Both 
cDNAs encode proteins of 309 amino acids, showing 89% identity with each other 
and homologous to proteins of unknown function predicted from the sequences of 
several bacterial genomes. Both proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and 
purified. They were shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of DMF, 
fructoselysine, fructoseglycine, and fructose in order of decreasing affinity. 
They also phosphorylated glycated lysozyme, though not unmodified lysozyme. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of phosphorylated DMF and phosphorylated 
fructoseglycine showed that the phosphate was bound to the third carbon of the 
1-deoxyfructose moiety. The physiological function of fructosamine-3-kinase may 
be to initiate a process leading to the deglycation of fructoselysine and of 
glycated proteins.
