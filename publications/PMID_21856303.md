Bcl-XL is a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family that can be found in the 
outer mitochondrial membrane and in soluble cytosolic homodimers. Bcl-XL can 
bind pro-apoptotic members of this family preventing them from activating the 
execution phase of apoptosis. Bcl-XL has been shown to homodimerize in different 
ways, although most binding and structural assays have been carried out in the 
absence of its carboxyl terminal transmembrane domain. We show here that this 
domain can by itself direct protein oligomerization, which could be related to 
its previously reported role in mitochondrial morphology alterations and 
apoptosis inhibition.
