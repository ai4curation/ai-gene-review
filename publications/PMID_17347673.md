In response to a number of genotoxic stimuli that induce DNA damage in cells, 
the tumour suppressor p53 is activated resulting in cell cycle arrest or 
apoptosis. In this study, we have identified stimulated with retinoic acid 13 
(Stra13), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a regulator of 
ionizing-radiation-induced apoptosis. We show that Stra13 is induced in response 
to several DNA-damaging agents in a p53-independent manner. Stra13-/- thymocytes 
show impaired apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation, and consistently, p53 
levels and also expression of its key transcriptional targets Puma and Noxa are 
reduced in the mutant thymocytes. In vitro, Stra13 regulates p53 levels in a 
mouse double mutant 2 (Mdm2)-dependent manner by physically interacting with p53 
and preventing Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and nuclear export. Together, our 
studies provide evidence that Stra13 is involved in DNA-damage-induced apoptosis 
and indicate its role in tumorigenesis.

Abstract

In response to a number of genotoxic stimuli that induce DNA damage in cells, the tumour suppressor p53 is activated resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In this study, we have identified stimulated with retinoic acid 13 (Stra13), a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor, as a regulator of ionizing-radiation-induced apoptosis. We show that Stra13 is induced in response to several DNA-damaging agents in a p53-independent manner. Stra13 −/− thymocytes show impaired apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation, and consistently, p53 levels and also expression of its key transcriptional targets Puma and Noxa are reduced in the mutant thymocytes. In vitro , Stra13 regulates p53 levels in a mouse double mutant 2 (Mdm2)-dependent manner by physically interacting with p53 and preventing Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and nuclear export. Together, our studies provide evidence that Stra13 is involved in DNA-damage-induced apoptosis and indicate its role in tumorigenesis.

Introduction

Transcription factors belonging to the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) family are important regulators of cellular differentiation, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Stimulated with retinoic acid 13 (Stra13; also known as differentially expressed in chondrocytes/enhancer of split and hairy related protein 2 (Dec1/Sharp2)), a bHLH factor, is widely expressed during mouse embryogenesis ( Boudjelal et al , 1997 ). Studies of overexpression have implicated Stra13 in many biological responses including cell-cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis ( Sun & Taneja, 2000 ; Seimiya et al , 2002 ; Ivanova et al , 2004 ). Conversely, Stra13 −/− mice show a defect in Fas-mediated apoptosis of activated T and B cells, leading to the development of a lupus-like autoimmune disorder ( Sun et al , 2001 ) and impaired skeletal muscle regeneration in response to injury ( Sun et al , 2007 ). Although Stra13 transcriptionally regulates its target genes, it also interacts with several proteins including Usf (upstream stimulatory factor), Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and Clock/Bmal (clock/brain and muscle arnt-like protein), and modulates their activity by transcription-independent mechanisms ( Dhar & Taneja, 2001 ; Ivanova et al , 2004 ; Sato et al , 2004 ). Recent studies have shown that Stra13 is upregulated in response to stress stimuli such as serum deprivation, hypoxia and various cytokines ( Sun & Taneja, 2000 ; Ivanova et al , 2001 , 2004 ; Yun et al , 2002 ), indicating that it might mediate cellular responses to stress. However, the signalling pathways and molecular mechanisms by which it participates in stress responses are not completely understood.

A pivotal target that mediates DNA-damage-induced cellular responses of growth arrest and apoptosis is the tumour suppressor p53. p53 is a short-lived protein that is normally expressed at low levels owing to its interaction with mouse double mutant 2 (Mdm2), which signals its degradation. Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with the amino-terminus of p53 and promotes its degradation by ubiquitination ( Haupt et al , 1997 ). In response to DNA damage, p53 becomes phosphorylated and this prevents its interaction with Mdm2, leading to its stabilization and activation ( Ko & Prives, 1996 ; Giaccia & Kastan, 1998 ; Oren, 1999 ). p53, in its active form, transcriptionally upregulates the expression of target genes that are important for cell-cycle arrest, such as p21 Waf1 ( Brugarolas et al , 1995 ), and apoptosis, such as Puma, Noxa and Bax ( McCurrach et al , 1997 ; Villunger et al , 2003 ).

In this study, we examined the role of Stra13 in DNA-damage-induced cellular responses. We show that Stra13 is upregulated by ionizing radiation and genotoxic agents both in vitro and in vivo in a p53-independent manner. Stra13-deficient thymocytes show resistance to γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis and express reduced levels of p53 and its target genes Puma and Noxa after DNA damage. Conversely, overexpression of Stra13 results in the accumulation of p53 in an Mdm2-dependent manner by protecting it from Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Our studies provide evidence that Stra13 is involved in p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Thus, these results provide new observations that link Stra13 to DNA-damage-induced cellular responses.

Methods

Mice. Stra13 −/− mice have been described previously ( Sun et al , 2001 ). All animal protocols followed institutional guidelines.

DNA damage. Four- to six-week-old wild-type and Stra13 −/− mice, or cultured cells, were γ-irradiated using a 137 Cs source as indicated. NIH3T3 cells were treated with 20 μg/ml etoposide (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) or 20 μg/ml cisplatin (Sigma) for various durations as indicated.

Apoptosis of thymocytes. Thymocytes from wild-type and Stra13 −/− mice were irradiated, stained with AnnexinV–fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and PI (Sigma) and analysed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACScan, San Jose, CA, USA).

GST pull-down assays, co-immunoprecipitation and antibodies. GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously ( Sun & Taneja, 2000 ). GST pull-down assays were carried out with equivalent amounts of various GST–p53 mutants or GST alone, and 35 S-labelled in vitro -translated Stra13. Conversely, GST–Stra13 mutants ( Sun & Taneja, 2000 ) were used for the interaction with 35 S-labelled in vitro -translated p53. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, H1299 or p53/Mdm2 −/− MEFs were transfected with p53, Mdm2 and Flag–Stra13, as indicated. Lysates were immunoprecipitated and detected by western blotting with appropriate antibodies. β-Actin was used to confirm equivalent loading of proteins. The primary antibodies were Stra13 (Dec1; kindly provided by Dr B. Yan, University of Rhode Island), p53 (FL393 and DO-1; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Flag (M2; Sigma); Mdm2 (SMP14 and N-20; Santa Cruz), ubiquitin (P4D1; Santa Cruz) and β-actin (Sigma).

Reverse transcriptase–PCR. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR was carried out as described ( Boudjelal et al , 1997 ). HCT116 and HCT116 p53 −/− cells were transfected with vector (pCS2) alone or pCS2–Stra13. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol. The following primers were used: p53: 5′-GCTGCTCAGATAGCGATG-3′ and 5′-GGCATCCTTGAGTTCCAAG-3′ for 30 cycles; Mdm2: 5′-GGAAATGCACTTCATG-3′ and 5′-CAGGGCTTATTCCTTTTC-3′ for 30 cycles; and 36B4: 5′-CAGCTCTGGAGAAACTGCTG-3′ and 5′-GTGTACTCAGTCTCCACAGA-3′ for 19 cycles. PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Ubiquitination assays. For in vitro ubiquitination assays, 10 ng of purified p53 (ProteinOne, Bethesda, MD, USA) was incubated with 25 ng E1 (Boston Biochemicals, Cambridge, MA, USA), 100 ng E2 (GST–UbcH5c; Boston Biochemicals), 150 ng GST–Mdm2, 10 μg His–ubiquitin, 5 μM ubiquitin aldehyde and 2 mM ATPγS in the absence or presence of 6 μl (∼60 ng) of in vitro -translated Stra13 for 2 h at 37°C in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris–HCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM dithiothreitol. Reactions were analysed by western blotting using p53 antibody. For in vivo experiments, p53, Mdm2 and Flag–Stra13 were transfected in NIH3T3 cells. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor (ALLN; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) for 4 h and analysed by western blot using p53 antibody. For Mdm2 ubiquitination assays in vitro , 250 ng of GST–Mdm2 was incubated with E1 (25 ng), E2 (100 ng) and His–ubiquitin (5 μg) for 1 h at 37°C in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris–HCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM dithiothreitol and 2 mM ATP. BSA or in vitro -translated Stra13 (750 ng) was added as indicated. Reactions were analysed by immunoblotting with ubiquitin antibody.

Immunofluorescence microscopy. H1299 cells were transfected with Flag-Stra13 and p53. After 24 h, cells were treated with 20 μM etoposide and immunostained with Flag and p53 antibodies. p53 subcellular localization in the presence or absence of Mdm2 and Stra13 was similarly analysed. Nuclei were detected with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. A total of 1,000 nuclei were counted for cellular distribution of p53.
