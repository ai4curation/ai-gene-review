The C. elegans gene ced-12 functions in the engulfment of apoptotic cells and in 
cell migration, acting in a signaling pathway with ced-2 Crkll, ced-5 DOCK180, 
and ced-10 Rac GTPase and acting upstream of ced-10 Rac. ced-12 encodes a 
protein with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and an SH3 binding motif, both of 
which are important for ced-12 function. CED-12 acts in engulfing cells for cell 
corpse engulfment and interacts physically with CED-5, which contains an SH3 
domain. CED-12 has Drosophila and human counterparts. Expression of CED-12 and 
its counterparts in murine Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts induced Rho GTPase-dependent 
formation of actin filament bundles. We propose that through interactions with 
membranes and with a CED-2/CED-5 protein complex, CED-12 regulates Rho/Rac 
GTPase signaling and leads to cytoskeletal reorganization by an evolutionarily 
conserved mechanism.
