Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) are GTPase-activating proteins 
(GAPs) for G(i) and/or G(q) class G protein alpha subunits. RGS GAP activity is 
inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) but not by other 
lipid phosphoinositides or diacylglycerol. Both the negatively charged head 
group and long chain fatty acids (C16) are required for binding and inhibition 
of GAP activity. Amino acid substitutions in helix 5 within the RGS domain of 
RGS4 reduce binding affinity and inhibition by PIP(3) but do not affect 
inhibition of GAP activity by palmitoylation. Conversely, the GAP activity of a 
palmitoylation-resistant mutant RGS4 is inhibited by PIP(3). Calmodulin binds 
all RGS proteins we tested in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner but does not directly 
affect GAP activity. Indeed, Ca(2+)/calmodulin binds a complex of RGS4 and a 
transition state analog of Galpha(i1)-GDP-AlF(4)(-). Ca(2+)/calmodulin reverses 
PIP(3)-mediated but not palmitoylation-mediated inhibition of GAP activity. 
Ca(2+)/calmodulin competition with PIP(3) may provide an intracellular mechanism 
for feedback regulation of Ca(2+) signaling evoked by G protein-coupled 
agonists.
