Meckel syndrome (MKS) is a ciliopathy characterized by encephalocele, cystic 
renal disease, liver fibrosis and polydactyly. An identifying feature of MKS1, 
one of six MKS-associated proteins, is the presence of a B9 domain of unknown 
function. Using phylogenetic analyses, we show that this domain occurs 
exclusively within a family of three proteins distributed widely in ciliated 
organisms. Consistent with a ciliary role, all Caenorhabditis elegans 
B9-domain-containing proteins, MKS-1 and MKS-1-related proteins 1 and 2 (MKSR-1, 
MKSR-2), localize to transition zones/basal bodies of sensory cilia. Their 
subcellular localization is largely co-dependent, pointing to a functional 
relationship between the proteins. This localization is evolutionarily 
conserved, because the human orthologues also localize to basal bodies, as well 
as cilia. As reported for MKS1, disrupting human MKSR1 or MKSR2 causes 
ciliogenesis defects. By contrast, single, double and triple C. elegans mks/mksr 
mutants do not display overt defects in ciliary structure, intraflagellar 
transport or chemosensation. However, we find genetic interactions between all 
double mks/mksr mutant combinations, manifesting as an increased lifespan 
phenotype, which is due to abnormal insulin-IGF-I signaling. Our findings 
therefore demonstrate functional interactions between a novel family of proteins 
associated with basal bodies or cilia, providing new insights into the molecular 
etiology of a pleiotropic human disorder.
