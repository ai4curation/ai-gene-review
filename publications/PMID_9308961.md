Candidate transcription factors involved in pancreatic endocrine development 
have been isolated using insulin gene regulation as a paradigm. The cell-type 
restricted basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene, BETA2/NeuroD, expressed in 
pancreatic endocrine cells, the intestine, and the brain, activates insulin gene 
transcription and can induce neurons to differentiate. To understand the 
importance of BETA2 in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation, mice lacking a 
functional BETA2 gene were generated by gene targeting experiments. Mice 
carrying a targeted disruption of the BETA2 gene developed severe diabetes and 
died perinatally. Homozygous BETA2 null mice had a striking reduction in the 
number of insulin-producing beta cells and failed to develop mature islets. 
Islet morphogenesis appeared to be arrested between E14.5 and E17.5, a period 
characterized by major expansion of the beta cell population. The presence of 
severe diabetes in these mice suggests that proper islet structure plays an 
important role in blood glucose homeostasis. In addition, secretin- and 
cholecystokinin-producing enteroendocrine cells failed to develop in the absence 
of BETA2. The absence of these two pancreatic secretagogs may explain the 
abnormal cellular polarity and inability to secrete zymogen granules in 
pancreatic acinar exocrine cells. The nervous system appeared to develop 
normally, despite abundant expression of BETA2 in differentiating neurons. Thus, 
BETA2 is critical for the normal development of several specialized cell types 
arising from the gut endoderm.
