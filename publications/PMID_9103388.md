The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) system has been implicated in the 
etiology of numerous cancers, including that of ovarian cancer. Elevated levels 
of EGFR are associated with poor patient prognosis. Moreover, a significant 
number of ovarian cancers express both the receptor and one of its ligands, 
suggesting an autocrine mechanism for autonomous tumor growth. Because of the 
implicated role of the EGFR system in neoplasia, a greater understanding of the 
factors involved in this system is necessary. We have recently characterized a 
truncated EGFR-like protein (TEGFR) in human placenta, and we now extend this 
investigation to ovarian cancer. We report that TEGFR is expressed in ovarian 
cancer and its level correlates to that of EGFR. Moreover, the level of TEGFR is 
reduced in metastatic compared to primary tumors. These results suggest that 
TEGFR may play a role in the EGFR system.
