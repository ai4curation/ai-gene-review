TOR is the target of the immunosuppressant rapamycin and a key regulator of cell 
growth. It modulates diverse cellular processes in the cytoplasm and nucleus, 
including the expression of amino acid transporters, ribosomal RNAs and 
ribosomal proteins. Despite considerable recent progress, little is known about 
the spatial and temporal regulation of TOR signalling, particularly that leading 
into the nucleus. Here we show that Tor1 is dynamically distributed in the 
cytoplasm and nucleus in yeast. Tor1 nuclear localization is nutrient dependent 
and rapamycin sensitive: starvation or treatment with rapamycin causes Tor1 to 
exit from the nucleus. Tor1 nuclear localization is critical for 35S rRNA 
synthesis, but not for the expression of amino acid transporters and ribosomal 
protein genes. We show further that Tor1 is associated with 35S ribosomal DNA 
(rDNA) promoter chromatin in a rapamycin- and starvation-sensitive manner; this 
association is necessary for 35S rRNA synthesis and cell growth. These results 
indicate that the spatial regulation of TOR complex 1 (TORC1) might be involved 
in differential control of its target genes. TOR is known as a classic 
cytoplasmic kinase that mediates the cytoplasm-to-nucleus signalling by 
controlling the localization of transcription factors. Our data indicate that 
TOR might be more intimately involved in gene regulation than previously 
thought.
