The cuticle and epidermis of Caenorhabditis elegans provide the first line of 
defense against invading pathogens. Upon invasion by the fungal pathogen 
Drechmeria coniospora, C. elegans responds by upregulating the expression of 
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the epidermis via activation of at least two 
pathways, a neuroendocrine TGF-β pathway and a p38 MAPK pathway. Here, we 
identify the sodium-neurotransmitter symporter SNF-12, a member of the solute 
carrier family (SLC6), as being essential for both these immune signaling 
pathways. We also identify the STAT transcription factor-like protein STA-2 as a 
direct physical interactor of SNF-12 and show that the two proteins function 
together to regulate AMP gene expression in the epidermis. Both SNF-12 and STA-2 
act cell autonomously and specifically in the epidermis to govern the 
transcriptional response to fungal infection. These findings reveal an 
unorthodox mode of regulation for a STAT factor and highlight the molecular 
plasticity of innate immune signaling.
