Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are anaerobes readily found in oxic-anoxic 
interfaces. Multiple defense pathways against oxidative conditions were 
identified in these organisms and proposed to be differentially expressed under 
different concentrations of oxygen, contributing to their ability to survive 
oxic conditions. In this study, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough cells were 
exposed to the highest concentration of oxygen that SRB are likely to encounter 
in natural habitats, and the global transcriptomic response was determined. 
Three hundred and seven genes were responsive, with cellular roles in energy 
metabolism, protein fate, cell envelope and regulatory functions, including 
multiple genes encoding heat shock proteins, peptidases and proteins with heat 
shock promoters. Of the oxygen reducing mechanisms of D. vulgaris only the 
periplasmic hydrogen-dependent mechanism was up-regulated, involving the 
[NiFeSe] hydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase(s) and the Hmc membrane complex. The 
oxidative defense response concentrated on damage repair by metal-free enzymes. 
These data, together with the down-regulation of the ferric uptake regulator 
operon, which restricts the availability of iron, and the lack of response of 
the peroxide-sensing regulator operon, suggest that a major effect of this 
oxygen stress is the inactivation and/or degradation of multiple metalloproteins 
present in D. vulgaris as a consequence of oxidative damage to their metal 
clusters.
