The endoplasmic reticulum is the site of folding, assembly and quality control 
for proteins of the secretory pathway. The ATP-regulated Hsp70 chaperone BiP 
(heavy chain-binding protein), together with cochaperones, has important roles 
in all of these processes. The functional cycle of Hsp70s is determined by 
conformational transitions that are required for substrate binding and release. 
Here, we used the intrinsically disordered C(H)1 domain of antibodies as an 
authentic substrate protein and analyzed the conformational cycle of BiP by 
single-molecule and ensemble Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) 
measurements. Nucleotide binding resulted in concerted domain movements of BiP. 
Conformational transitions of the lid domain allowed BiP to discriminate between 
peptide and protein substrates. A major BiP cochaperone in antibody folding, 
ERdj3, modulated the conformational space of BiP in a nucleotide-dependent 
manner, placing the lid subdomain in an open, protein-accepting state.
