G protein-coupled receptors are regulated by ligand stimulation, endocytosis, 
degradation of recycling to the cell surface. Little information is available on 
the molecular mechanisms underlying G protein-coupled receptors recycling. We 
have investigated recycling of the G protein-coupled thyroid stimulating hormone 
receptor (TSHR) and found that it relies on hScrib, a membrane-associated PDZ 
protein. hScrib directly binds to TSHR, inhibits basal receptor endocytosis and 
promotes recycling, and thus TSHR signalling, at the cell membrane. We 
previously demonstrated that hScrib is associated with a betaPIX-GIT1 complex 
comprised of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and a GTPase-activating 
protein for ADP ribosylation factors that is involved in vesicle trafficking. We 
used dominant-negative constructs and small interfering RNA to show that TSHR 
recycling is regulated by the interaction between hScrib and betaPIX, and by the 
activity of GIT1. In addition, ARF6, a major target for GIT1, is activated 
during TSH stimulation of HEK293 and FRTL-5 thyroid cells, and plays a key role 
in TSHR recycling. Thus, we have uncovered an hScrib-betaPIX-GIT1-ARF6 pathway 
devoted to TSHR trafficking and function.
