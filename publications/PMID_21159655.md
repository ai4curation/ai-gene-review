Retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 genes are mutated or inactivated in most human 
cancers and mutually regulate each other. Recently, we reported that expression 
of diverse genes was altered in Rb-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). 
In this study, we found that Pierce1, a novel transcript upregulated in 
Rb-deficient MEFs, is a transcriptional target of p53. Although Pierce1 promoter 
did not respond to the ectopic expression of E2F1, it was strongly activated by 
p53 via 2 cis-elements. Consistently, the expression of Pierce1 was induced by 
genotoxic stresses that activate p53 but was not detected in p53-deficient MEFs. 
Pierce1 was posttranslationally stabilized by ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation, 
and UVC-activated ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related) signaling 
suppressed proteosomal degradation of Pierce1 protein. Furthermore, knockdown of 
Pierce1 compromised the checkpoint response of wild-type MEFs to UVC 
irradiation, accompanying the diminished expression of p53 target genes. 
Together, our data suggest that Pierce1 is an important p53 target gene 
contributing to normal DNA damage response and may play crucial roles in 
maintaining genomic integrity against genotoxic stresses, including UVC 
irradiation.
