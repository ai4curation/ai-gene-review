Dopamine D1A receptor-deficient mice were assessed in a wide variety of tasks 
chosen to reflect the diverse roles of this receptor subtype in behavioural 
regulation. The protocol included examination of exploration and locomotor 
activity in an open field, a test of sensorimotor orienting, both place and cue 
learning in the Morris water maze, and assessment of simple associative learning 
in an olfactory discrimination task. Homozygous mice showed broad-based 
impairments that were characterized by deficiencies in initiating movement 
and/or reactivity to external stimuli. Data obtained from flash evoked 
potentials indicated that these deficits did not reflect gross visual 
impairments. The partial reduction in D1A receptors in the heterozygous mice did 
not affect performance in most tasks, although circumscribed deficits in some 
tasks were observed (e.g., failure to develop a reliable spatial bias in the 
water maze). These findings extend previous behavioural studies of null mutant 
mice lacking D1A receptors and provide additional support for the idea that the 
D1A receptor participates in a wide variety of behavioural functions. The 
selective impairments of heterozygous mice in a spatial learning task suggest 
that the hippocampal/cortical dopaminergic system may be uniquely vulnerable to 
the partial loss of the D1A receptor.
