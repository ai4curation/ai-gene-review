Apert syndrome (AS) is characterized by craniosynostosis (premature fusion of 
cranial sutures) and severe syndactyly of the hands and feet. Two activating 
mutations, Ser-252 --> Trp and Pro-253 --> Arg, in fibroblast growth factor 
receptor 2 (FGFR2) account for nearly all known cases of AS. To elucidate the 
mechanism by which these substitutions cause AS, we determined the crystal 
structures of these two FGFR2 mutants in complex with fibroblast growth factor 2 
(FGF2). These structures demonstrate that both mutations introduce additional 
interactions between FGFR2 and FGF2, thereby augmenting FGFR2-FGF2 affinity. 
Moreover, based on these structures and sequence alignment of the FGF family, we 
propose that the Pro-253 --> Arg mutation will indiscriminately increase the 
affinity of FGFR2 toward any FGF. In contrast, the Ser-252 --> Trp mutation will 
selectively enhance the affinity of FGFR2 toward a limited subset of FGFs. These 
predictions are consistent with previous biochemical data describing the effects 
of AS mutations on FGF binding. Alterations in FGFR2 ligand affinity and 
specificity may allow inappropriate autocrine or paracrine activation of FGFR2. 
Furthermore, the distinct gain-of-function interactions observed in each crystal 
structure provide a model to explain the phenotypic variability among AS 
patients.
