Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of many human pathologies, including cancer. 
The sustained proliferation rate of tumor cells leads to alterations of the 
tumor microenvironment, that progressively becomes more acidic, 
nutrient-deprived, and hypoxic. The reduced partial pressure of oxygen triggers 
the onset of an adaptive response, aimed at increasing the local oxygen 
concentration by several complementary actions. Although directly exposed to the 
blood stream, endothelial cells lining the vascular lumen in tumors also can be 
exposed to hypoxia and therefore can contribute to the onset of the adaptive 
response that leads to tumor angiogenesis. Aiming at getting a detailed insight 
into the oxygen-dependent regulation of the transcriptional program of vascular 
endothelial cells and at identifying new relevant markers that may be used as 
targets for therapeutic intervention in tumor angiogenesis, we have performed a 
broad-range transcriptomic analysis, using the Affymetrix HG-U133A Gene Chips, 
of mRNA expression levels in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells 
(HUVEC), exposed in vitro to hypoxia for different time periods. The 
transcriptomic analysis was complemented by a semiquantitative reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of mRNA levels and 
alternative splicing for some selected extracellular matrix protein genes, and 
by a proteomic analysis, using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) and tandem mass spectrometry for protein separation 
and identification, of hypoxic and normoxic HUVEC whole-cell lysates and 
subcellular fractions. Our analysis confirmed previous findings on genes whose 
expression is regulated by oxygen concentration but also identified new genes 
(e.g., CXCR4, claudin 3, CD24, tetranectin, Del-1, procollagen lysyl hydroxylase 
1 and 2) which are transcriptionally upregulated in hypoxic conditions.
