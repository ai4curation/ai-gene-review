In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, paternally provided organelles, including 
mitochondria, are eliminated by a process of selective autophagy called 
allophagy, the mechanism by which mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally. 
However, it remains unclear how paternal organelles are recognized and targeted 
for autophagy. Here, we identified an autophagy receptor for allophagy, ALLO-1. 
ALLO-1 is essential for autophagosome formation around paternal organelles and 
directly binds to the worm LC3 homologue LGG-1 through its LC3-interacting 
region (LIR) motif. After fertilization, ALLO-1 accumulates on the paternal 
organelles before autophagosome formation, and this localization depends on the 
ubiquitin modification of the paternal organelles. We also identified IKKE-1, a 
worm homologue of the TBK1 and IKKε family kinase, as another critical regulator 
of allophagy. IKKE-1 interacts with ALLO-1, and the IKKE-1-dependent 
phosphorylation of ALLO-1 is important for paternal organelle clearance. Thus, 
we propose that ALLO-1 is the allophagy receptor whose function is regulated by 
IKKE-1-dependent phosphorylation.
