The UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT) is a protein folding 
sensor and glycosyltransferase that constitutes an important component of the 
protein quality control machinery. With the use of quantitative immunogold 
electron microscopy, we established the subcellular distribution of GT in rat 
liver and pancreas and Drosophila melanogaster salivary gland as well as cell 
lines and correlated it with that of glucosidase II, calreticulin, and pre-Golgi 
intermediate markers. Labeling for GT, as well as for glucosidase II and 
calreticulin, was found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), including nuclear 
envelope and pre-Golgi intermediates located between ER and Golgi apparatus, and 
in the cell periphery. In the rough ER, labeling for GT was inhomogeneous, with 
variously sized labeled and unlabeled cisternal regions alternating, indicative 
of a meshwork of quality control checkpoints. Notably, labeling intensity for GT 
was highest in pre-Golgi intermediates, corresponding to twice that of rough ER, 
whereas the Golgi apparatus exhibited no specific labeling. These results 
suggest that protein quality control is not restricted to the ER and that the 
pre-Golgi intermediates, by virtue of the presence of GT, glucosidase II, and 
calreticulin, are involved in this fundamental cellular process.
