A 4.0 kb region of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 DNA which complements three 
mutants unable to convert acetyl-CoA to glyoxylate (and therefore defective in 
the assimilation of methanol and ethanol) has been isolated and sequenced. It 
contains two ORFs and the 3'-end of a third one. The mutations in all three 
mutants mapped within the first ORF, which was designated meaA; it encodes a 
protein having similarity with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. However, 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was measured in extracts of one of the mutants and the 
specific activity was found to be similar to that in extracts of wild-type 
cells. Furthermore, although the predicted meaA gene product has the proposed 
cobalamin-binding site, it does not contain a highly conserved sequence (RIARNT) 
which is present in all known methylmalonyl-CoA mutases; meaA may therefore 
encode a novel vitamin-B12-dependent enzyme. The predicted polypeptide encoded 
by the second ORF did not have similarity with any known proteins. The partial 
ORF encoded a protein with similarity with the 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] 
reductases; it was not essential for growth on methanol or ethanol.
