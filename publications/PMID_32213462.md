Membrane contact sites, where two organelles are in close proximity, are 
critical regulators of cellular membrane homeostasis, with roles in signaling, 
lipid metabolism, and ion dynamics. A growing catalog of specialized lipid 
transfer proteins carry out lipid exchange at these sites. Currently 
characterized eukaryotic lipid transport proteins are shuttles that typically 
extract a single lipid from the membrane of the donor organelle, solubilize it 
during transport through the cytosol, and deposit it in the acceptor organelle 
membrane. Here, we highlight the recently identified chorein_N family of lipid 
transporters, including the Vps13 proteins and the autophagy protein Atg2. These 
are elongated proteins that, distinct from previously characterized transport 
proteins, bind tens of lipids at once. They feature an extended channel, most 
likely lined with hydrophobic residues. We discuss the possibility that they are 
not shuttles but instead are bridges between membranes, with lipids traversing 
the cytosol via the hydrophobic channel.
