We have isolated a novel gene, DIR1, from L132 cells that is transiently 
repressed after exposure to low radiation doses and has a potential role in 
induced radioresistance. Molecular and cellular characterization of this gene 
reveals that it is unique but has similarities to a family of heat-shock-related 
proteins known as immunophilins. These have been implicated in various cellular 
functions including general stress responses and control of the cell cycle. 
Antisense strategies have demonstrated that the DIR1 gene also appears to have 
some involvement in the control of the cell cycle. Furthermore, there appears be 
a potential role for this gene product in the phenomenon of induced 
radioresistance through a mechanism that increases the rate of DNA repair in 
cells exposed to X rays and subsequently increases the cells' resistance to 
radiation. This is the first description of an immunophilin-like gene that has a 
possible role in adaptive/inducible responses to X rays in mammalian cells.
