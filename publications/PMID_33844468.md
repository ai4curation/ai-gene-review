Despite its potential clinical relevance, the product of the DMWD (dystrophia 
myotonica, WD repeat containing) gene is a largely uncharacterized protein. The 
DMWD amino acid sequence is similar to that of WDR20, a known regulator of the 
USP12 and USP46 deubiquitinases (DUBs). Here, we apply a combination of 
in silico and experimental methods to investigate several aspects of DMWD 
biology. Molecular evolution and phylogenetic analyses reveal that WDR20 and 
DMWD, similar to USP12 and USP46, arose by duplication of a common ancestor 
during the whole genome duplication event in the vertebrate ancestor lineage. 
The analysis of public human gene expression datasets suggests that DMWD 
expression is positively correlated with USP12 expression in normal tissues and 
negatively correlated with WDR20 expression in tumors. Strikingly, a survey of 
the annotated interactome for DMWD and WDR20 reveals a largely nonoverlapping 
set of interactors for these proteins. Experimentally, we first confirmed that 
DMWD binds both USP12 and USP46 through direct coimmunoprecipitation of 
epitope-tagged proteins. We found that DMWD and WDR20 share the same binding 
interface in USP12, suggesting that their interaction with the DUB may be 
mutually exclusive. Finally, we show that both DMWD and WDR20 promote USP12 
enzymatic activity, but they differentially modulate the subcellular 
localization of the DUB. Altogether, our findings suggest a model whereby 
mutually exclusive binding of DMWD and WDR20 to USP12 may lead to formation of 
deubiquitinase complexes with distinct subcellular localization, potentially 
targeting different substrate repertoires.
