Familial idiopathic nephrotic syndromes represent a heterogeneous group of 
kidney disorders, and include autosomal recessive steroid-resistant nephrotic 
syndrome, which is characterized by early childhood onset of proteinuria, rapid 
progression to end-stage renal disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. A 
causative gene for this disease, NPHS2, was mapped to 1q25-31 and we report here 
its identification by positional cloning. NPHS2 is almost exclusively expressed 
in the podocytes of fetal and mature kidney glomeruli, and encodes a new 
integral membrane protein, podocin, belonging to the stomatin protein family. We 
found ten different NPHS2 mutations, comprising nonsense, frameshift and 
missense mutations, to segregate with the disease, demonstrating a crucial role 
for podocin in the function of the glomerular filtration barrier.
