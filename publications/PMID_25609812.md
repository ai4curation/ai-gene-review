Virus infection triggers immediate innate immune responses. Apoptosis represents 
another effective means to restrict virus invasion, besides robust expression of 
host cytokines and chemokines. IRF3 was recently demonstrated to be 
indispensable for Sendai virus (SeV)-induced apoptosis, but the underlying 
mechanism is not fully understood. Here we report that a dynamic protein 
complex, Tom70/Hsp90/IRF3/Bax, mediates SeV-induced apoptosis. The cytosolic 
proapoptotic protein Bax interacts specifically with IRF3 upon virus infection. 
The mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom70 recruits IRF3 to mitochondria via 
Hsp90. Consequently, the relocation of Bax onto mitochondria induces the leakage 
of cytochrome c into the cytosol and initiates the corresponding apoptosis. 
Interestingly, IKK-i is essential for this apoptosis, whereas TBK1 is 
dispensable. Collectively, our study characterizes a novel protein complex that 
is important for SeV-induced apoptosis.
IMPORTANCE: Apoptosis is an effective means of sacrificing virus-infected cells 
and restraining the spread of virus. In this study, we demonstrate that IRF3 
associates with Bax upon virus infection. Tom70 recruits this protein complex to 
the mitochondrial outer membrane through Hsp90, which thus induces the release 
of cytochrome c into the cytosol, initiating virus-induced apoptosis. 
Interestingly, IKK-i plays an essential role in this activation. This study 
uncovers a novel mechanism of SeV-induced apoptosis.
