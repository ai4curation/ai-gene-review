Acute leukemias induced by MLL chimeric oncoproteins are among the subset of 
cancers distinguished by a paradoxical dependence on GSK-3 kinase activity for 
sustained proliferation. We demonstrate here that GSK-3 maintains the MLL 
leukemia stem cell transcriptional program by promoting the conditional 
association of CREB and its coactivators TORC and CBP with homedomain protein 
MEIS1, a critical component of the MLL-subordinate program, which in turn 
facilitates HOX-mediated transcription and transformation. This mechanism also 
applies to hematopoietic cells transformed by other HOX genes, including CDX2, 
which is highly expressed in a majority of acute myeloid leukemias, thus 
providing a molecular approach based on GSK-3 inhibitory strategies to target 
HOX-associated transcription in a broad spectrum of leukemias.
