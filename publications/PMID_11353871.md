Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is specifically incorporated into the virions of HIV-1 and 
has been shown to enhance significantly an early step of cellular HIV-1 
infection. Our preliminary studies implicated CD147 as a receptor for 
extracellular CyPA. Here, we demonstrate a role for CyPA-CD147 interaction 
during the early steps of HIV-1 infection. Expression of human CD147 increased 
infection by HIV-1 under one-cycle conditions. However, susceptibility to 
infection by viruses lacking CyPA (simian immunodeficiency virus or HIV-1 
produced in the presence of cyclosporin A) was unaffected by CD147. 
Virus-associated CyPA coimmunoprecipitated with CD147 from infected cells. 
Antibody to CD147 inhibited HIV-1 entry as evidenced by the delay in 
translocation of the HIV-1 core proteins from the membrane and inhibition of 
viral reverse transcription. Viruses whose replication did not require CyPA (SIV 
or mutant HIV-1) were resistant to the inhibitory effect of anti-CD147 antibody. 
These results suggest that HIV-1 entry depends on an interaction between 
virus-associated CyPA and CD147 on a target cell.

Abstract

Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is specifically incorporated into the virions
 of HIV-1 and has been shown to enhance significantly an early step of
 cellular HIV-1 infection. Our preliminary studies implicated CD147 as a
 receptor for extracellular CyPA. Here, we demonstrate a role for
 CyPA–CD147 interaction during the early steps of HIV-1 infection.
 Expression of human CD147 increased infection by HIV-1 under one-cycle
 conditions. However, susceptibility to infection by viruses lacking
 CyPA (simian immunodeficiency virus or HIV-1 produced in the presence
 of cyclosporin A) was unaffected by CD147. Virus-associated CyPA
 coimmunoprecipitated with CD147 from infected cells. Antibody to CD147
 inhibited HIV-1 entry as evidenced by the delay in translocation of the
 HIV-1 core proteins from the membrane and inhibition of viral reverse
 transcription. Viruses whose replication did not require CyPA (SIV or
 mutant HIV-1) were resistant to the inhibitory effect of anti-CD147
 antibody. These results suggest that HIV-1 entry depends on an
 interaction between virus-associated CyPA and CD147 on a target cell.

Discussion

Taken together, results presented in this report indicate
 that CD147 interacts with virus-associated CyPA and regulates an early
 step in HIV-1 replication. A recent study by Saphire et al. ( 28 ) suggested a role for CyPA in virus attachment through binding to
 sulfated proteoglycans (heparans). It seems plausible that CyPA
 interaction with CD147 is downstream of CyPA–heparan interaction.
 Indeed, initial interaction of CyPA with heparans might facilitate its
 subsequent binding to CD147, similar to the situation with chemokines
 whose binding to glycosaminoglycans enhances
 subsequent interaction with their receptors ( 38 , 39 ). Similarly,
 binding of CyPB to heparans presumably presents the immunophilin for
 interaction with its functional receptor (type I site) ( 40 ).
 Involvement of a CyPA-interacting receptor in an early step of HIV-1
 infection is consistent with our earlier finding ( 16 ) that exogenously
 added CyPA inhibits HIV-1 infection, presumably by competition for
 CD147 with virus-associated CyPA.

Several mechanisms may account for the activity of CD147 during the
 early phase of the HIV-1 life cycle. Intracellular signaling events
 initiated by CyPA–CD147 interaction (V.Y., G.Z., M. O'Connor, W.
 W. Dai, T. Hao, H.G., B.T., B.S., and M.B, unpublished data) might
 induce MA phosphorylation, which was suggested to regulate detachment
 of the RT complex from the membrane ( 41 ). Signaling from CD147 might
 also induce cytoskeleton rearrangements, facilitating virus entry. It
 is also conceivable that CyPA binding to CD147 might affect
 conformation of another CyPA-binding partner, CA, leading to
 destabilization of the capsid shell. This latter mechanism is similar
 to the one proposed in earlier studies ( 15 ). Finally, CyPA binding to
 CD147 might promote transition from the step of hemifusion to complete
 fusion ( 42 ), allowing liberation of the RT complex into the cytoplasm.
 All these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and may well function
 simultaneously or sequentially.

Interaction between virus-associated CyPA and CD147 during HIV-1
 entry suggests that different binding sites on CyPA are engaged by CA
 and CD147. This notion is supported indirectly by our finding that
 CyPA-CD147 binding is resistant to CsA (V.Y., G.Z., M. O'Connor,
 W. W. Dai, T. Hao, H.G., B.T., B.S., and M.B, unpublished data),
 whereas CyPA–CA interaction is sensitive to this agent ( 11 ). Our
 recent studies also demonstrated an important role of the CD147
 transmembrane domain in CyPA-induced signaling and chemotaxis (V.Y.,
 G.Z., M. O'Connor, W. W. Dai, T. Hao, H.G., B.T., B.S., and M.B,
 unpublished data). It should be noted that the mechanisms of
 interaction between free CyPA and CD147 do not necessarily apply to the
 interaction between CD147 and HIV-1-associated CyPA. Indeed, in
 contrast to free CyPA studied there, CyPA in the virus particle is
 bound to the capsid protein ( 11 ). The activities and interactions of
 free vs. bound CyPA may be very different. As an example, a complex
 between CyPA and CsA binds and inhibits calcineurin, whereas neither
 CsA nor CyPA alone are capable of binding calcineurin ( 3 , 43 ). More
 studies will be needed to define the binding interactions between CD147
 and CyPA during HIV-1 infection.

Expression of the human CD147 on CHO cells does not appear
 to be absolutely necessary for HIV-1 infection (in contrast to CD4,
 CCR5 or CXCR4), as low level infection occurs without it. This is
 illustrated by only a 6- to 8-fold difference between CyPA-positive and
 CyPA-deficient HIV-1 in one-cycle infection ( 21 ). During long-term
 culture, this difference is exponentially amplified with each infection
 cycle. The role of CyPA–CD147 interaction might be even more
 pronounced in vivo , where low amounts of transmitted
 infectious virus and a low probability of successful infection make the
 establishment of new infections critically dependent on every small
 enhancement the virus can achieve. It appears that HIV-1 evolved to
 enhance its infection process by using not only a cellular receptor but
 also its ligand, thus subverting the target cell's ligand–receptor
 interaction pathway for the virus's own purpose.

The use of CyPA and CD147 for infection sets HIV-1 apart from other
 primate lentiviruses that do not rely on these factors. The ability to
 incorporate CyPA and use CD147 might have been acquired at the early
 stages of HIV evolution, during adaptation of the virus to the
 human host, and might contribute to high replication capacity and
 pathogenicity of HIV-1. Further detailed analysis of CD147 activity
 during HIV-1 infection is likely to identify the exact step regulated
 by CD147 and might define novel targets for anti-HIV interventions.
