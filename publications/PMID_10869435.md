Transcription is controlled in part by the dynamic acetylation and deacetylation 
of histone proteins. The latter process is mediated by histone deacetylases 
(HDACs). Previous analysis of the regulation of HDAC activity in transcription 
has focused primarily on the recruitment of HDAC proteins to specific promoters 
or chromosomal domains by association with DNA-binding proteins. To characterize 
the cellular function of the recently identified HDAC4 and HDAC5 proteins, 
complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation. Both HDACs were found to 
interact with14-3-3 proteins at three phosphorylation sites. The association of 
14-3-3 with HDAC4 and HDAC5 results in the sequestration of these proteins in 
the cytoplasm. Loss of this interaction allows HDAC4 and HDAC5 to translocate to 
the nucleus, interact with HDAC3, and repress gene expression. Regulation of the 
cellular localization of HDAC4 and HDAC5 by 14-3-3 represents a mechanism for 
controlling the transcriptional activity of these class II HDAC proteins.
