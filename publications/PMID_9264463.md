The E-cadherin-catenin adhesion complex has been the subject of many structural 
and functional studies because of its importance in development, normal tissue 
function and carcinogenesis. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain 
of E-cadherin binds either beta-catenin or plakoglobin, which both can assemble 
alpha-catenin into the complex. Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin 
binding site in beta-catenin and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence 
analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic 
interaction mechanism. Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary 
binding site in alpha-catenin which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin 
and plakoglobin. Using in vitro association assays with C-terminal truncations 
of alpha-catenin expressed as recombinant fusion proteins, we found that the 
N-terminal 146 amino acids are required for this interaction. We then identified 
a peptide of 27 amino acids within this sequence (amino acid positions 117-143) 
which is necessary and sufficient to bind beta-catenin or plakoglobin. As shown 
by mutational analysis, hydrophobic amino acids within this binding site are 
important for the interaction. The results described here, together with our 
previous work, give strong support for the idea that these proteins associate by 
hydrophobic interactions of two alpha-helices.
