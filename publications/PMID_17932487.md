Tau is an axonal microtubule-associated protein involved in microtubule assembly 
and stabilization. Mutations in Tau cause frontotemporal dementia and 
parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), and tau aggregates are present 
in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. The mechanisms leading from tau 
dysfunction to neurodegeneration are still debated. The dynein-activator complex 
dynactin has an essential role in axonal transport and mutations in its gene are 
associated with lower motor neuron disease. We show here for the first time that 
the N-terminal projection domain of tau binds to the C-terminus of the p150 
subunit of the dynactin complex. Tau and dynactin show extensive colocalization, 
and the attachment of the dynactin complex to microtubules is enhanced by tau. 
Mutations of a conserved arginine residue in the N-terminus of tau, found in 
patients with FTDP-17, affect its binding to dynactin, which is abnormally 
distributed in the retinal ganglion cell axons of transgenic mice expressing 
human tau with a mutation in the microtubule-binding domain. These findings, 
which suggest a direct involvement of tau in axonal transport, have implications 
for understanding the pathogenesis of tauopathies.
