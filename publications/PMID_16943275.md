Ciliary localization of the transient receptor potential polycystin 2 channel 
(TRPP2/PKD-2) is evolutionarily conserved, but how TRPP2 is targeted to cilia is 
not known. In this study, we characterize the motility and localization of 
PKD-2, a TRPP2 homolog, in C. elegans sensory neurons. We demonstrate that 
GFP-tagged PKD-2 moves bidirectionally in the dendritic compartment. 
Furthermore, we show a requirement for different molecules in regulating the 
ciliary localization of PKD-2. PKD-2 is directed to moving dendritic particles 
by the UNC-101/adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) complex. When expressed in non-native 
neurons, PKD-2 remains in cell bodies and is not observed in dendrites or cilia, 
indicating that cell-type specific factors are required for directing PKD-2 to 
the dendrite. PKD-2 stabilization in cilia and cell bodies requires LOV-1, a 
functional partner and a TRPP1 homolog. In lov-1 mutants, PKD-2 is greatly 
reduced in cilia and forms abnormal aggregates in neuronal cell bodies. 
Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is not essential for PKD-2 dendritic motility or 
access to the cilium, but may regulate PKD-2 ciliary abundance. We propose that 
both general and cell-type-specific factors govern TRPP2/PKD-2 subcellular 
distribution by forming at least two steps involving somatodendritic and ciliary 
sorting decisions.
