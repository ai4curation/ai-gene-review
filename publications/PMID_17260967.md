Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a product of a causative gene for the 
autosomal-dominant form of familial Parkinson's disease (PARK8), harbors a 
Ras-like small GTP binding protein-like (ROC) domain besides the kinase domain, 
although the relationship between these two functional domains remains elusive. 
Here we show by thin-layer chromatographic analysis that LRRK2 stably binds GTP 
but lacks a GTPase activity in HEK293 and Neuro-2a cells. A ROC domain mutation 
that converts LRRK2 to a guanine nucleotide-free form (T1348N) abolishes the 
kinase activity of LRRK2 as well as its phosphate incorporation upon metabolic 
labeling. The phosphorylation of LRRK2 was inhibited by potential inhibitors for 
cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. These data suggest that binding of GTP to 
the ROC domain regulates the kinase activity of LRRK2 as well as its 
phosphorylation by other kinase(s).
