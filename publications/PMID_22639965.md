Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the leading causes of 
genetically inherited Parkinson's disease (PD) identified so far. The underlying 
mechanism whereby missense alterations in LRRK2 initiate neurodegeneration 
remains largely unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized to 
contribute to the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial PD. The pathogenic 
gain-of-function mutant form of LRRK2, LRRK2 G2019S, is associated with elevated 
kinase activity and PD. Here we show that LRRK2 G2019S can cause defects in the 
morphology and dynamics of mitochondria in cortical neurons. In neurons, 
endogenous LRRK2 and the mitochondrial fission factor Dynamin like protein 1 
(DLP1) interact with and partially co-localize with each other. DLP1 plays an 
essential role in LRRK2-induced mitochondrial fission. In support of this, 
expression of LRRK2 leads to the translocation of DLP1 from the cytosol to the 
mitochondria and knockdown of DLP1 expression inhibits LRRK2-induced 
mitochondrial fission. In addition, co-expression of LRRK2 and DLP1 induces 
mitochondrial clearance. Furthermore, we have found that expression of LRRK2 
leads to increased reactive oxygen species levels in cells. Taken together, our 
results provide insights into the pathobiology of LRRK2 and suggest that LRRK2 
G2019S may induce neuronal dysfunction or cell death by disturbing normal 
mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics and function.
