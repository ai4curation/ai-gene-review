To understand the role of the CCAAT-binding factor, CBF, in transcription, we 
developed a strategy to purify the heterotrimeric CBF complex from HeLa cell 
extracts using two successive immunoaffinity chromatography steps. Here we show 
that the p32 protein, previously identified as the ASF/SF2 splicing 
factor-associated protein, copurified with the CBF complex. Studies of 
protein-protein interaction demonstrated that p32 interacts specifically with 
CBF-B subunit and also associates with CBF-DNA complex. Cellular localization by 
immunofluorescence staining revealed that p32 is present in the cell throughout 
the cytosol and nucleus, whereas CBF is present primarily in the nucleus. A 
portion of the p32 colocalizes with CBF-B in the nucleus. Interestingly, 
reconstitution of p32 in an in vitro transcription reaction demonstrated that 
p32 specifically inhibits CBF-mediated transcription activation. Altogether, our 
study identified p32 as a novel and specific corepressor of CBF-mediated 
transcription activation in vitro.
