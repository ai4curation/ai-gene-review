AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Islet antigen-2 (IA-2), a major autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, 
is an enzymatically inactive member of the transmembrane protein tyrosine 
phosphatase (PTP) family. IA-2 is located in dense-core secretory vesicles and 
is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion. The present experiments were 
initiated to identify those proteins that interact with IA-2 (i.e. the IA-2 
interactome) as a first step towards elucidating the mechanism(s) by which IA-2 
influences insulin secretion and serves as an autoantigen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the proteins with which IA-2 interacts, a 
yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a human foetal library, and deletion 
mutants were used to determine the binding sites. Positive interactions were 
confirmed by immunoprecipitation pull-down experiments using cell lysate from 
transfected mammalian cell lines.
RESULTS: Six new interacting proteins were identified by this approach: 
mitogen-activated protein kinase-activating death domain (MADD), the MADD 
isoform IG20, PTPrho, PTPsigma, sorting nexin 19 (SNX19) and cyclophilin A. 
Using a series of IA-2 deletion mutants, we identified the regions on the IA-2 
molecule to which five of the interacting proteins bound. Amino acids 744-979 of 
IA-2 were required for the maximum binding of MADD, IG20 and SNX19, whereas 
amino acids 602-907 of IA-2 were required for the maximum binding of PTPrho and 
PTPsigma. Pull-down experiments with cell lysate from transfected mammalian 
cells confirmed the binding of the interacting proteins to IA-2.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The IA-2 interactome based on, pull-down 
experiments, currently consists of 12 proteins. The identification of these 
interacting proteins provides clues as to how IA-2 exerts its biological 
functions.
