Progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) involves spatial and temporal occurrences 
of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereby tumour cells acquire a more 
invasive and metastatic phenotype. Subsequently, the disseminated mesenchymal 
tumour cells must undergo a reverse transition (mesenchymal-epithelial 
transition, MET) at the site of metastases, as most metastases recapitulate the 
pathology of their corresponding primary tumours. Importantly, initiation of 
tumour growth at the secondary site is the rate-limiting step in metastasis. 
However, investigation of this dynamic reversible EMT and MET that underpins CRC 
morphogenesis has been hindered by a lack of suitable in vitro models. To this 
end, we have established a unique in vitro model of CRC morphogenesis, which we 
term LIM1863-Mph (morphogenetic). LIM1863-Mph cells spontaneously undergo cyclic 
transitions between two-dimensional monolayer (migratory, mesenchymal) and 
three-dimensional sphere (carcinoid, epithelial) states. Using RNAi, we 
demonstrate that FZD7 is necessary for MET of the monolayer cells as loss of 
FZD7 results in the persistence of a mesenchymal state (increased 
SNAI2/decreased E-cadherin). Moreover, FZD7 is also required for migration of 
the LIM1863-Mph monolayer cells. During development, FZD7 orchestrates either 
migratory or epithelialization events depending on the context. Our findings 
strongly implicate similar functional diversity for FZD7 during CRC 
morphogenesis.
