Glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5) deficiency has previously been identified as a cause of 
anemia in a zebrafish model and of sideroblastic anemia in a human patient. Here 
we report that GLRX5 is essential for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and the 
maintenance of normal mitochondrial and cytosolic iron homeostasis in human 
cells. GLRX5, a mitochondrial protein that is highly expressed in erythroid 
cells, can homodimerize and assemble [2Fe-2S] in vitro. In GLRX5-deficient 
cells, [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis was impaired, the iron-responsive 
element-binding (IRE-binding) activity of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) was 
activated, and increased IRP2 levels, indicative of relative cytosolic iron 
depletion, were observed together with mitochondrial iron overload. Rescue of 
patient fibroblasts with the WT GLRX5 gene by transfection or viral transduction 
reversed a slow growth phenotype, reversed the mitochondrial iron overload, and 
increased aconitase activity. Decreased aminolevulinate delta, synthase 2 
(ALAS2) levels attributable to IRP-mediated translational repression were 
observed in erythroid cells in which GLRX5 expression had been downregulated 
using siRNA along with marked reduction in ferrochelatase levels and increased 
ferroportin expression. Erythroblasts express both IRP-repressible ALAS2 and 
non-IRP-repressible ferroportin 1b. The unique combination of IRP targets likely 
accounts for the tissue-specific phenotype of human GLRX5 deficiency.

Abstract

Glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5) deficiency has previously been identified as a cause of anemia in a zebrafish model and of sideroblastic anemia in a human patient. Here we report that GLRX5 is essential for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and the maintenance of normal mitochondrial and cytosolic iron homeostasis in human cells. GLRX5, a mitochondrial protein that is highly expressed in erythroid cells, can homodimerize and assemble [2Fe-2S] in vitro. In GLRX5-deficient cells, [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis was impaired, the iron-responsive element–binding (IRE-binding) activity of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) was activated, and increased IRP2 levels, indicative of relative cytosolic iron depletion, were observed together with mitochondrial iron overload. Rescue of patient fibroblasts with the WT GLRX5 gene by transfection or viral transduction reversed a slow growth phenotype, reversed the mitochondrial iron overload, and increased aconitase activity. Decreased aminolevulinate δ, synthase 2 (ALAS2) levels attributable to IRP-mediated translational repression were observed in erythroid cells in which GLRX5 expression had been downregulated using siRNA along with marked reduction in ferrochelatase levels and increased ferroportin expression. Erythroblasts express both IRP-repressible ALAS2 and non-IRP–repressible ferroportin 1b. The unique combination of IRP targets likely accounts for the tissue-specific phenotype of human GLRX5 deficiency.

Introduction

Iron-sulfur clusters [Fe-S] are prosthetic groups that facilitate a wide range of cellular activities, including electron transfer, enzymatic catalysis, and sensing of iron and oxygen ( 1 , 2 ). More than 20 proteins are involved in biogenesis of [Fe-S] clusters ( 3 – 7 ). Many [Fe-S] biogenesis proteins are located primarily in mitochondria, including the sulfur donor ISCS proteins, the proposed iron donor frataxin, multiple scaffolds including ISCU and NFU as well as molecular chaperones, and redox proteins. [Fe-S] clusters in cytosol are also synthesized by a cytosolic machinery ( 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 ), which in mammalian cells includes alternative isoforms of the sulfur donor, ISCS ( 10 ), the major scaffold protein, ISCU ( 8 , 9 ), and a possible alternative scaffold, NFU ( 11 ). In humans, because of the presence of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), regulation of cellular iron homeostasis is linked to the [Fe-S] biosynthesis machinery ( 12 – 16 ). When IRP1 contains an [Fe-S] cluster, it functions as an aconitase in cytosol, but loss of its [Fe-S] cluster activates binding to RNA stem loops known as iron-responsive elements (IREs) found in either 5′ or 3′ terminal UTR of numerous gene transcripts, most of which encode proteins implicated in iron metabolism. The translation of proteins encoded by transcripts that contain a 5′ IRE is repressed by binding of IRPs, whereas the stability of mRNAs that contain IREs in the 3′ UTR is increased by binding of IRPs. The transcript of aminolevulinate δ, synthase 2 (ALAS2), which catalyzes the first step of heme synthesis in mitochondria of erythroblasts, contains a 5′ IRE, and its translation can be repressed by IRP binding. Mammalian ferrochelatase (FECH) ( 17 ) contains a labile [2Fe-2S] cluster that is required for function and stability ( 18 ). Thus, activity of the first and last steps of heme biosynthesis in erythroid cells can be governed by iron-sulfur cluster status of cells, either by determining activity of IRP1 or by directly contributing to activity and/or stability of an iron-sulfur enzyme.

Disruption of [Fe-S] biogenesis can cause serious human diseases ( 19 ). Although these [Fe-S] synthetic components work at different points in the same pathway, different phenotypes arise from inherited mutations in these genes, including Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) ( 20 , 21 ), ISCU myopathy ( 22 , 23 ), and the recently characterized sideroblastic anemia (SA), associated with a mutation in glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5) ( 24 ). The patient with GLRX5 deficiency and SA has an A294G mutation in the last nucleotide of exon-1, which impedes intron-1 splicing and dramatically reduces GLRX5 mRNA levels. The patient did not develop symptoms until midlife, when he developed microcytic hypochromic anemia, type II diabetes, cirrhosis, and liver iron overload. Inherited SAs comprise a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by reduced heme synthesis, mitochondrial iron overload, and the presence of ringed sideroblasts ( 25 ). Other genetic defects that cause SA include mutations of ALAS2 and ABCB7, both of which are on chromosome X, and the resulting SAs are accordingly referred to as X-linked SAs (XLSA). ABCB7 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter on the inner membrane of mitochondria, which has previously been proposed to transport an [Fe-S] compound to cytosol ( 7 , 26 ). More recently, a new form of SA was identified, which is caused by mutations of SLC25A38 that may encode an erythroid-specific glycine importer on the mitochondrial inner membrane ( 27 ).

Glutaredoxins (GRX) are small redox proteins generally thought to be important for the reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSH) and/or for removal of GSH modifications of proteins. Under oxidative stress, the cysteine thiol groups of many proteins are protected by the reversible addition of the tripeptide, GSH (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly), in a process known as glutathionylation, and the removal of GSH requires reduction of the disulfide bond formed between the cysteine of GSH and the cysteine thiol of target proteins. Two major classes of GRX are recognized, including monothiol GRX, which contain a CXXS motif, and dithiol GRX, which contain CXXC domains ( 28 , 29 ). Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 5 GRX, and the phenotypic defects of GRX5 deficiency were suppressed by overexpression of 2 [Fe-S] cluster biosynthetic proteins, SSQ1 or ISA2, but not by the addition of DTT reductant, suggesting that defects of the GRX5 mutant were not due to the alteration of intracellular redox potential ( 30 ), but rather to a specific role in biogenesis of [Fe-S] clusters. The human genome contains 4 GRX, including a GRX5 homolog and a GRX3/4-like protein known as PICOT ( 31 ). Thus far, there are no known links between PICOT and iron metabolism. Although deficiency of GLRX5 in both zebrafish ( 32 ) and a human patient ( 24 ) was associated with anemia, the molecular relationship between the anemia and the status of [Fe-S] assembly has not been characterized in GLRX5-deficient mammalian cells.

Here we report that human GLRX5 is essential for mitochondrial [Fe-S] biogenesis. Reconstitution studies reveal that GLRX5 can assemble a [2Fe-2S] cluster, enabling it to function as an [Fe-S] scaffold or sensor. In GLRX5 RNAi cells and GLRX5-deficient patient cells, [Fe-S] synthesis is impaired, and mitochondrial iron overload develops in conjunction with relative cytosolic iron depletion. Transcriptional remodeling in response to cell stress may account for cytosolic iron depletion, which activates IRPs, repressing ALAS2 synthesis in erythroid cells and thus inhibiting heme synthesis in GLRX5 deficiency.

Discussion

Here we have shown that GLRX5 is a mitochondrial protein required for iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. GLRX5 can assemble a [2Fe-2S] cluster when GSH ligands are present in vitro, and it may function as a [2Fe-2S] donor in vivo. GLRX5 knockdown experiments in HeLa cells revealed that diminished mitochondrial aconitase activity was associated with mitochondrial iron overload and markedly increased levels of IRP2, an indication that cytosolic iron levels were decreased. In erythroid cells, GLRX5 knockdown resulted in decreased expression of ferritin, ALAS2, and FECH. ALAS2 catalyzes the first reaction of heme biosynthesis in erythroid cells, and FECH catalyzes the last, and decreased ALAS2 and FECH expression were associated with decreased heme content. Activation of IRE-binding activity was demonstrated in fibroblasts from a patient with a splicing mutation that rendered GLRX5 protein undetectable both in lymphoblasts and fibroblasts. Increased IRE-binding activity repressed ferritin translation in several cell types and was also expected to repress ALAS2 translation in erythroid cells because ALAS2 contains an IRE in its 5′ UTR. As expected, but not previously directly observed, ALAS2 protein levels were reduced in GLRX5-deficient erythroid cells. In addition, FECH levels were diminished in erythroid cells. We speculate that GLRX5 may be required to donate the [2Fe-2S] cluster to human FECH, and recent work has demonstrated that FECH is unstable when it does not acquire its [2Fe-2S] cluster ( 18 ). FECH levels were diminished in lymphoblasts from the patient, but not in fibroblasts from the same patient, indicating some tissue specificity in FECH stability when [Fe-S] biogenesis is impaired.

In GLRX5 knockdown experiments, we showed that mitochondrial aconitase activity was diminished by GLRX5 siRNA treatment, but cytosolic aconitase activity was not significantly changed. These results implied that GLRX5 has a direct role in mitochondrial [Fe-S] biogenesis. We hypothesize that GLRX5-deficient cells fail to correctly assess mitochondrial iron status, and they therefore import more iron into mitochondria or export less, leading to mitochondrial iron overload and concomitant cytosolic iron deficiency. Under cytosolic iron deficiency, IRP2 levels are expected to increase, as was observed, and eventually cytosolic aconitase activity would decrease as a result of cytosolic iron depletion and loss of the iron-sulfur cluster required for aconitase activity. IRP1 is a bifunctional protein that converts from activity as a cytosolic aconitase when it contains an intact [4Fe-4S] cluster to an IRE-binding protein when the cluster is absent, and IRE-binding activity of IRP1 would accordingly increase in GLRX5-deficient cells. In fibroblasts from the GLRX5-deficient patient, we observed decreased cytosolic aconitase activity and increased IRE-binding activity in a gel shift assay, as expected.

Although the proteins of the glutaredoxin family are suggested to perform multiple functions, including reduction of disulfide bonds and de/glutathionylation ( 28 ), the exact function of GLRX5 in [Fe-S] biogenesis has not yet been fully characterized. Based on prior experiments in the yeast model system, some have suggested that GLRX5 regulates activities of IscS and IscU in the [Fe-S] machinery by addition to or removal of GSH groups from active site cysteines ( 30 , 50 ), whereas others concluded that GLRX5 is involved in an [Fe-S] cluster delivery from scaffold IscU to target proteins ( 51 ). Recently, a number of glutaredoxin proteins were found to ligate [2Fe-2S] clusters in vitro. The discovery that plant monothiol GRX bind a [2Fe-2S] cluster has led to the proposal that these monothiol GRX function as scaffold proteins that deliver [2Fe-2S] clusters to specific recipient target proteins ( 34 ). Our observation that a [2Fe-2S] bridging cluster can be reconstituted on human GLRX5 is consistent with this hypothesis. In the reconstituted holo-GLRX5, the catalytic residue C67 and external GSH are required to ligate the [2Fe-2S] cluster between 2 monomers. Point mutagenesis revealed that K59, T108, and D123 residues were likely involved in the docking of the GSH ligand to GLRX5 protein. Thus, as suggested for its plant counterparts (AtGrxS14 and AtGrxS16) ( 34 ), GLRX5 could function as a potential scaffold, delivering the preassembled [2Fe-2S] cluster to target proteins.

A possible cause for the observation that relative cytosolic iron deficiency occurs in conjunction with compromise of [Fe-S] biogenesis ( 52 ) was revealed by gene profiling, in which we observed that HMOX1 and ferroportin transcript levels increased markedly in GLXR-deficient cells, likely in response to the stress associated with functional failure of [Fe-S] proteins. With the disruption in mitochondrial iron homeostasis caused by defective [Fe–S] assembly in yeast, reactive iron can compete with manganese for binding to SOD2, and iron binding to eukaryotic SOD2 irreversibly inactivates the SOD enzyme, thus leading to oxidative stress ( 53 , 54 ). Diminished expression of FTMT mRNA in GLRX5-deficient fibroblasts could also contribute further to the damage from mitochondrial iron overload by failing to provide a protein that can sequester mitochondrial iron. Cytosolic iron deficiency may contribute to the slow-growth phenotype observed in Caenorhabditis elegans that lack GLRX5 and in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from the GLRX5-deficient patients. Notably, we demonstrated here that the slow growth of the GLRX5-deficient patient fibroblasts was reversed by GLRX5 expression.

Hereditary mutations of several different [Fe-S] synthetic genes are known to cause human disorders ( 19 ), including mutations in the gene of the proposed iron donor, frataxin in FRDA, in the iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein ISCU in patients with hereditary myopathy, and in the SA patient discussed in this paper. Although these mutations affect the same basic process, the manifestations of disease differ greatly; heart and brain are the primary affected tissues in FRDA, whereas skeletal muscle is affected in ISCU myopathy, and erythroid cells are adversely affected in the GLRX5-deficient patient, raising the question of why symptoms and affected tissues are so variable. The mutations of ISCU myopathy and GLRX5-related SA are caused by splicing defects, whereas mutations of ABCB7 that cause inherited SA/ataxia syndrome are missense mutations. Thus, one possible reason for tissue specificity may be that splicing defects are tissue specific.

However, a tissue-specific splicing defect cannot explain the GLRX5-caused SA, since we have shown that GLRX5 is absent in both hematopoietic (lymphoblast) and nonhematopoietic (fibroblast) cells. We suggest that SA occurs with GLRX5 deficiency mainly because ALAS2, which is expressed almost exclusively in erythroid cells, contains an IRE in its 5′ UTR that renders it susceptible to translational repression by IRPs. The defect in regulation of mitochondrial iron homeostasis caused by loss of GLRX5 also affects nonerythroid cells, as we demonstrated with GLRX5 knockdown experiments and in patient fibroblasts, but many effects may remain below the threshold for clinical detection, whereas repression of ALAS2 in erythroid cells causes profound symptoms (Figure 9 ).

We propose that the tissue-specific phenotype of human GLRX5 deficiency depends not only on the erythroid-specific expression of ALAS2, which contains an IRE and is translationally repressed by IRPs, but also on the expression of ferroportin 1b, a ferroportin transcript that lacks an IRE and cannot be repressed by IRPs. Increased expression of both FPN transcripts likely occurs in response to stress caused by mitochondrial failure to synthesize iron-sulfur clusters and to correctly regulate iron homeostasis, but the expression of ferroportin 1b then exacerbates the cytosolic iron depletion and further misregulates iron homeostasis in erythroid precursors. Thus, GLRX5 deficiency would be expected to impair [Fe-S] biogenesis in many tissues, but only in erythroid precursors would the unique profile of IRP targets cause a clinically significant syndrome. We propose that as more [Fe-S] synthetic components are identified and characterized, more insights into possible causes of tissue specificity for diseases of Fe-S biogenesis may be discovered.
