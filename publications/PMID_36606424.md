The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that serves as a hub for 
many signaling pathways. It functions as part of the centrosome or cilium 
complex, which also contains the basal body and the centriolar satellites. 
Little is known about the mechanisms by which the microtubule-based ciliary 
axoneme is assembled with a proper length and structure, particularly in terms 
of the activity of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and the crosstalk 
between the different compartments of the centrosome or cilium complex. Here, we 
analyzed CCDC66, a MAP implicated in cilium biogenesis and ciliopathies. 
Live-cell imaging revealed that CCDC66 compartmentalizes between centrosomes, 
centriolar satellites, and the ciliary axoneme and tip during cilium biogenesis. 
CCDC66 depletion in human cells causes defects in cilium assembly, length and 
morphology. Notably, CCDC66 interacts with the ciliopathy-linked MAPs CEP104 and 
CSPP1, and regulates axonemal length and Hedgehog pathway activation. Moreover, 
CCDC66 is required for the basal body recruitment of transition zone proteins 
and intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) machinery. Overall, our results establish 
CCDC66 as a multifaceted regulator of the primary cilium and provide insight 
into how ciliary MAPs and subcompartments cooperate to ensure assembly of 
functional cilia.
