Mitochondrial Ca(2+) Uniporter (MCU)-dependent mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is 
the primary mechanism for increasing matrix Ca(2+) in most cell types. However, 
a limited understanding of the MCU complex assembly impedes the comprehension of 
the precise mechanisms underlying MCU activity. Here, we report that mouse 
cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells lacking MCU regulator 1 (MCUR1) have 
severely impaired [Ca(2+)]m uptake and IMCU current. MCUR1 binds to MCU and EMRE 
and function as a scaffold factor. Our protein binding analyses identified the 
minimal, highly conserved regions of coiled-coil domain of both MCU and MCUR1 
that are necessary for heterooligomeric complex formation. Loss of MCUR1 
perturbed MCU heterooligomeric complex and functions as a scaffold factor for 
the assembly of MCU complex. Vascular endothelial deletion of MCU and MCUR1 
impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, cell proliferation, and migration but 
elicited autophagy. These studies establish the existence of a MCU complex that 
assembles at the mitochondrial integral membrane and regulates Ca(2+)-dependent 
mitochondrial metabolism.
