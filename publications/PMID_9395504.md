The 110-kDa heat shock protein (hsp110) has long been recognized as one of the 
primary heat shock proteins in mammalian cells. It belongs to a recently 
described protein family that is a significantly diverged subgroup of the hsp70 
family and has been found in organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals. We 
describe here the first analysis of the ability of hsp110 to protect cellular 
and molecular targets from heat damage. It was observed that the overexpression 
in vivo of hsp110 conferred substantial heat resistance to both Rat-1 and HeLa 
cells. In vitro heat denaturation and refolding assays demonstrate that hsp110 
is highly efficient in selectively recognizing denatured proteins and 
maintaining them in a soluble, folding-competent state and is significantly more 
efficient in performing this function than is hsc70. hsp110-bound proteins can 
then be refolded by the addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate or hsc70 and 
Hdj-1, whereas Hdj-1 does not itself function as a co-chaperone in folding with 
hsp110. hsp110 is one of the principal molecular chaperones of mammalian cells 
and represents a newly identified component of the primary protection/repair 
pathway for denatured proteins and thermotolerance expression in vivo.
