Ethanol stress (10% v/v) causes selective mRNA export in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae in a similar manner to heat shock (42 degrees C). Bulk poly(A)(+) 
mRNA accumulates in the nucleus, whereas heat shock protein mRNA is exported 
under such conditions. Here we investigated the effects of stress on mRNA export 
factors. In cells treated with ethanol stress, the DEAD box protein Rat8p showed 
a rapid and reversible change in its localization, accumulating in the nucleus. 
This change correlated closely with the blocking of bulk poly(A)(+) mRNA export 
caused by ethanol stress. We also found that the nuclear accumulation of Rat8p 
is caused by a defect in the Xpo1p/Crm1p exportin. Intriguingly, the 
localization of Rat8p did not change in heat shocked cells, suggesting that the 
mechanisms blocking bulk poly(A)(+) mRNA export differ for heat shock and 
ethanol stress. These results suggest that changes in the localization of Rat8p 
contribute to the selective export of mRNA in ethanol stressed cells, and also 
indicate differences in mRNA export between the heat shock response and ethanol 
stress response.
