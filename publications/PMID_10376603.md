Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is a 
fundamental determinant of cardiovascular homesotasis: it regulates systemic 
blood pressure, vascular remodelling and angiogenesis. Physiologically, the most 
important stimulus for the continuous formation of NO is the viscous drag (shear 
stress) generated by the streaming blood on the endothelial layer. Although 
shear-stress-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS is thought to regulate enzyme 
activity, the mechanism of activation of eNOS is not yet known. Here we 
demonstrate that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB mediates the 
activation of eNOS, leading to increased NO production. Inhibition of the 
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/Akt pathway or mutation of the Akt site on eNOS 
protein (at serine 1177) attenuates the serine phosphorylation and prevents the 
activation of eNOS. Mimicking the phosphorylation of Ser 1177 directly enhances 
enzyme activity and alters the sensitivity of the enzyme to Ca2+, rendering its 
activity maximal at sub-physiological concentrations of Ca2+. Thus, 
phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt represents a novel Ca2+-independent regulatory 
mechanism for activation of eNOS.
