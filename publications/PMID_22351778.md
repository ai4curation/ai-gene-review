Mutations in α-actinin 4 (ACTN4) are linked to familial forms of focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disease characterized by proteinuria due to 
podocyte injury. The mechanisms underlying ACTN4 mutant-associated FSGS are not 
completely understood. Although α-actinins are better known to cross-link actin 
filaments and modulate cytoskeletal organization, we have previously shown that 
ACTN4 interacts with transcription factors including estrogen receptor and MEF2s 
and potentiates their transcriptional activity. Nuclear receptors including 
retinoic acid receptor (RAR) have been proposed to play a protective role in 
podocytes. We show here that ACTN4 interacts with and enhances transcriptional 
activation by RARα. In addition, FSGS-linked ACTN4 mutants not only mislocalized 
to the cytoplasm, but also lost their ability to associate with nuclear 
receptors. Consequently, FSGS-linked ACTN4 mutants failed to potentiate 
transcriptional activation by nuclear hormone receptors in podocytes. In 
addition, overexpression of these mutants suppressed the transcriptional 
activity mediated by endogenous wild-type ACTN4 possibly by a cytoplasmic 
sequestration mechanism. Our data provide the first link between FSGS-linked 
ACTN4 mutants and transcriptional activation by nuclear receptor such as RARα 
and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ.
