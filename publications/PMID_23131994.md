Routinely used therapies are not adequate to treat the heterogeneity of breast 
cancer, and consequently, more therapeutic targets are desperately needed. To 
identify novel targets, we generated a breast cancer cDNA library enriched for 
genes that encode membrane and secreted proteins. From this library we 
identified SUSD2 (Sushi Domain Containing 2), which encodes an 822-amino acid 
protein containing a transmembrane domain and functional domains inherent to 
adhesion molecules. Previous studies describe the mouse homolog, Susd2, but 
there are no studies on the human gene associated with breast cancer. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of human breast tissues showed weak or no 
expression of SUSD2 in normal epithelial cells, with the endothelial lining of 
vessels staining positive for SUSD2. However, staining was observed in 
pathologic breast lesions and in lobular and ductal carcinomas. SUSD2 interacts 
with galectin-1 (Gal-1), a 14-kDa secreted protein that is synthesized by 
carcinoma cells and promotes tumor immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. 
Interestingly, we found that localization of Gal-1 on the surface of cells is 
dependent on the presence of SUSD2. Various phenotype assays indicate that SUSD2 
increases the invasion of breast cancer cells and contributes to a potential 
immune evasion mechanism through induction of apoptosis of Jurkat T cells. Using 
a syngeneic mouse model, we observed accelerated tumor formation and decreased 
survival in mice with tumors expressing Susd2. We found significantly fewer CD4 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in mice with tumors expressing Susd2. Together, 
our findings provide evidence that SUSD2 may represent a promising therapeutic 
target for breast cancer.
