By stimulating distinct receptor subtypes, dopamine (DA) exerts presynaptic and 
postsynaptic actions on both large aspiny (LA) cholinergic and fast-spiking (FS) 
parvalbumin-positive interneurons of the striatum. Lack of receptor- and 
isoform-specific pharmacological agents, however, has hampered the progress 
toward a detailed identification of the specific DA receptors involved in these 
actions. To overcome this issue, in the present study we used four different 
mutant mice in which the expression of specific DA receptors was ablated. In D1 
receptor null mice, D1R-/-, DA dose-dependently depolarized both LA and FS 
interneurons. Interestingly, SCH 233390 (10 microm), a D1-like (D1 and D5) 
receptor antagonist, but not l-sulpiride (3-10 microm), a D2-like (D2, D3, D4) 
receptor blocker, prevented this effect, implying D5 receptors in this action. 
Accordingly, immunohistochemical analyses in both wild-type and D1R-/- mice 
confirmed the expression of D5 receptors in both cholinergic and 
parvalbumin-positive interneurons of the striatum. In mice lacking D2 receptors, 
D2R-/-, the DA-dependent inhibition of GABA transmission was lost in both 
interneuron populations. Both isoforms of D2 receptor, D2L and D2S, were very 
likely involved in this inhibitory action, as revealed by the 
electrophysiological analysis of the effect of the DA D2-like receptor agonist 
quinpirole in two distinct mutants lacking D2L receptors and expressing variable 
contents of D2S receptors. The identification of the receptor subtypes involved 
in the actions of DA on different populations of striatal cells is essential to 
understand the circuitry of the basal ganglia and to develop pharmacological 
strategies able to interfere selectively with specific neuronal functions.
