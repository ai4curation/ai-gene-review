Human ribosomal protein S3 (hS3) has a high apparent binding affinity for the 
oxidative lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). The hS3 ribosomal protein 
has also been found to inhibit the base excision repair (BER) enzyme hOGG1 from 
liberating 8-oxoG residing in a 5'-end-labeled oligonucleotide. To understand 
the in vivo involvement of hS3 in BER, we have turned to RNA interference to 
generate knockdown of hS3 in cells exposed to DNA damaging agents. Here we show 
that a 40% knockdown of hS3 resulted in as much as a seven-fold increase in the 
24h survival-rate of HEK293 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Significant 
protection to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) was also 
observed. Protection to the chemotherapeutic alkylating agent Thio-TEPA was only 
revealed at longer exposure times where the agent became more toxic to 
untransfected human cells. Overall, these results raise the possibility that hS3 
interferes with the repair of the DNA lesions produced by genotoxic agents that 
potentially could play a role in the onset of cancer and other pathological 
states such as aging.
