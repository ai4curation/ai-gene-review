CAPN3/p94/calpain-3 is a skeletal-muscle-specific member of the calpain protease 
family. Multiple muscle cell functions have been reported for CAPN3, and 
mutations in this protease cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A. Little 
is known about the molecular mechanisms that allow CAPN3 to be so 
multifunctional. One hypothesis is that the very rapid and exhaustive autolytic 
activity of CAPN3 needs to be suppressed by dynamic molecular interactions for 
specific periods of time. The previously identified interaction between CAPN3 
and connectin/titin, a giant molecule in muscle sarcomeres, supports this 
assumption; however, the regulatory mechanisms of non-sarcomere-associated CAPN3 
are unknown. Here, we report that a novel CAPN3-binding protein, PLEIAD 
[Platform element for inhibition of autolytic degradation; originally called 
SIMC1/C5orf25 (SUMO-interacting motif containing protein 1/chromosome 5open 
reading frame 25)], suppresses the protease activity of CAPN3. Database analyses 
showed that PLEIAD homologs, like CAPN3 homologs, are evolutionarily conserved 
in vertebrates. Furthermore, we found that PLEIAD also interacts with CTBP1 
(C-terminal binding protein 1), a transcriptional co-regulator, and CTBP1 is 
proteolyzed in COS7 cells expressing CAPN3. The identified cleavage sites in 
CTBP1 suggested that it undergoes functional modification upon its proteolysis 
by CAPN3, as well as by conventional calpains. These results indicate that 
PLEIAD can shift its major function from CAPN3 suppression to CAPN3-substrate 
recruitment, depending on the cellular context. Taken together, our data suggest 
that PLEIAD is a novel regulatory scaffold for CAPN3, as reflected in its name.
