Hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B viruses) cause transient and chronic infections of 
the liver. Transient infections run a course of several months, and chronic 
infections are often lifelong. Chronic infections can lead to liver failure with 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The replication strategy of these 
viruses has been described in great detail, but virus-host interactions leading 
to acute and chronic disease are still poorly understood. Studies on how the 
virus evades the immune response to cause prolonged transient infections with 
high-titer viremia and lifelong infections with an ongoing inflammation of the 
liver are still at an early stage, and the role of the virus in liver cancer is 
still elusive. The state of knowledge in this very active field is therefore 
reviewed with an emphasis on past accomplishments as well as goals for the 
future.
