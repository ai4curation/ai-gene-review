The SWI/SNF complex is required for the transcription of several genes and has 
been shown to alter nucleosome structure in an ATP-dependent manner. The tumor 
suppressor protein p53 displays growth and transformation suppression functions 
that are frequently lost in mutant p53 proteins detected in various cancers. 
Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we show that several subunits of the 
human SWI/SNF complex bind to the tumor suppressor protein p53 in vivo and in 
vitro. The transactivation function of p53 is stimulated by overexpression of 
hSNF5 and BRG-1 and dominant forms of hSNF5 and BRG-1 repress p53-dependent 
transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay shows that hSNF5 and BRG-1 
are recruited to a p53-dependent promoter in vivo. Overexpression of dominant 
negative forms of either hSNF5 or BRG-1 inhibited p53-mediated cell growth 
suppression and apoptosis. Molecular connection between p53 and the SWI/SNF 
complex implicates that (i) the SWI/SNF complex is necessary for p53-driven 
transcriptional activation, and (ii) the SWI/SNF complex plays an important role 
in p53-mediated cell cycle control.
