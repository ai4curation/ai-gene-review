The mammalian cilium protrudes from the apical/lumenal surface of polarized 
cells and acts as a sensor of environmental cues. Numerous developmental 
disorders and pathological conditions have been shown to arise from defects in 
cilia-associated signaling proteins. Despite mounting evidence that cilia are 
essential sites for coordination of cell signaling, little is known about the 
cellular mechanisms controlling their formation and disassembly. Here, we show 
that interactions between the prometastatic scaffolding protein HEF1/Cas-L/NEDD9 
and the oncogenic Aurora A (AurA) kinase at the basal body of cilia causes 
phosphorylation and activation of HDAC6, a tubulin deacetylase, promoting 
ciliary disassembly. We show that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient 
for ciliary resorption and that it constitutes an unexpected nonmitotic activity 
of AurA in vertebrates. Moreover, we demonstrate that small molecule inhibitors 
of AurA and HDAC6 selectively stabilize cilia from regulated resorption cues, 
suggesting a novel mode of action for these clinical agents.
