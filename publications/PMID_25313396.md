The bacterial flagellum is assembled from over 20 structural components, and 
flagellar gene regulation is morphogenetically coupled to the assembly state by 
control of the anti-sigma factor FlgM. In the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella 
enterica, FlgM inhibits late-class flagellar gene expression until the 
hook-basal body structural intermediate is completed and FlgM is inhibited by 
secretion from the cytoplasm. Here we demonstrate that FlgM is also secreted in 
the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and is degraded extracellularly by 
the proteases Epr and WprA. We further demonstrate that, like in S. enterica, 
the structural genes required for the flagellar hook-basal body are required for 
robust activation of σ(D)-dependent gene expression and efficient secretion of 
FlgM. Finally, we determine that FlgM secretion is strongly enhanced by, but 
does not strictly require, hook-basal body completion and instead demands a 
minimal subset of flagellar proteins that includes the FliF/FliG basal body 
proteins, the flagellar type III export apparatus components FliO, FliP, FliQ, 
FliR, FlhA, and FlhB, and the substrate specificity switch regulator FliK.
