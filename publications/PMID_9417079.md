The co-stimulatory antigen CD28 has been shown to bind to several intracellular 
proteins including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, growth factor receptor-bound 
protein 2 (Grb2), and ITK. Paradoxically, Grb2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
binding has been mapped to a similar pYMNM motif within the CD28 cytoplasmic 
tail. Given the importance of CD28 co-signaling to T cell function, questions 
exist regarding the mechanism by which Grb2 binds to CD28, and whether the 
interaction plays a role in co-stimulation. To biochemically characterize 
Grb2/CD28 binding, we initially utilized glutathione S-transferase-Grb2 fusion 
proteins carrying inactivating mutations within the SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2, 
and assessed their ability to bind to CD28. In vitro binding experiments 
indicated that the Grb2 SH2 domain is critical for the association, while the 
SH3 domain plays an additional role in facilitating optimal binding. Enhanced 
binding via the SH3 domains was not observed when the C-terminal PXXP motif 
within CD28 was disrupted, thereby indicating that both SH2 and SH3 domains 
contribute to CD28 binding. Mutations that alter Grb2 binding were found to 
block the CD28-dependent interleukin-2 production. Further, tyrosine 
phosphorylation of Vav and the costimulation-dependent activation of Jun 
N-terminal kinase was blocked in cells defective in CD28/Grb2 binding. These 
results provide evidence for an alternate CD28-mediated signaling process 
involving Grb2 binding to the co-receptor.
