Histone chaperones are a group of proteins that aid in the dynamic chromatin 
organization during different cellular processes. Here, we report that the human 
histone chaperone nucleophosmin interacts with the core histones H3, H2B, and H4 
but that this histone interaction is not sufficient to confer the chaperone 
activity. Significantly, nucleophosmin enhances the acetylation-dependent 
chromatin transcription and it becomes acetylated both in vitro and in vivo. 
Acetylation of nucleophosmin and the core histones was found to be essential for 
the enhancement of chromatin transcription. The acetylated NPM1 not only shows 
an increased affinity toward acetylated histones but also shows enhanced histone 
transfer ability. Presumably, nucleophosmin disrupts the nucleosomal structure 
in an acetylation-dependent manner, resulting in the transcriptional activation. 
These results establish nucleophosmin (NPM1) as a human histone chaperone that 
becomes acetylated, resulting in the enhancement of chromatin transcription.
