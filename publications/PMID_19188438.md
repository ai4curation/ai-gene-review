It is well documented that mutations in the MYOCILIN gene may lead to juvenile- 
and adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma. However, the functions of wild-type 
myocilin are still not well understood. To study the functions of human myocilin 
and its two proteolytic fragments, these proteins were expressed in HEK293 
cells. Conditioned medium from myocilin-expressing cells, as well as purified 
myocilin, induced the formation of stress fibers in primary cultures of human 
trabecular meshwork or NIH 3T3 cells. Stress fiber-inducing activity of myocilin 
was blocked by antibodies against myocilin, as well as secreted inhibitors of 
Wnt signaling, secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) or sFRP3, and 
beta-catenin small interfering RNA. Interaction of myocilin with sFRP1, sFRP3, 
and several Frizzled receptors was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments 
and by binding of myocilin to the surface of cells expressing cysteine-rich 
domains of different Frizzled and sFRPs. Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with 
myocilin and its fragments induced intracellular redistribution of beta-catenin 
and its accumulation on the cellular membrane but did not induce nuclear 
accumulation of beta-catenin. Overexpression of myocilin in the eye angle 
tissues of transgenic mice stimulated accumulation of beta-catenin in these 
tissues. Myocilin and Wnt proteins may perform redundant functions in the 
mammalian eye, since myocilin modulates Wnt signaling by interacting with 
components of this signaling pathway.
