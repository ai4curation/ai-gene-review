Understanding how nutrients affect gene expression will help us to understand 
the mechanisms controlling plant growth and development as a function of 
nutrient availability. Nitrate has been shown to serve as a signal for the 
control of gene expression in Arabidopsis. There is also evidence, on a 
gene-by-gene basis, that downstream products of nitrogen (N) assimilation such 
as glutamate (Glu) or glutamine (Gln) might serve as signals of organic N status 
that in turn regulate gene expression. To identify genome-wide responses to such 
organic N signals, Arabidopsis seedlings were transiently treated with ammonium 
nitrate in the presence or absence of MSX, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, 
resulting in a block of Glu/Gln synthesis. Genes that responded to organic N 
were identified as those whose response to ammonium nitrate treatment was 
blocked in the presence of MSX. We showed that some genes previously identified 
to be regulated by nitrate are under the control of an organic N-metabolite. 
Using an integrated network model of molecular interactions, we uncovered a 
subnetwork regulated by organic N that included CCA1 and target genes involved 
in N-assimilation. We validated some of the predicted interactions and showed 
that regulation of the master clock control gene CCA1 by Glu or a Glu-derived 
metabolite in turn regulates the expression of key N-assimilatory genes. Phase 
response curve analysis shows that distinct N-metabolites can advance or delay 
the CCA1 phase. Regulation of CCA1 by organic N signals may represent a novel 
input mechanism for N-nutrients to affect plant circadian clock function.

Abstract

Understanding how nutrients affect gene expression will help us to understand the mechanisms controlling plant growth and development as a function of nutrient availability. Nitrate has been shown to serve as a signal for the control of gene expression in Arabidopsis . There is also evidence, on a gene-by-gene basis, that downstream products of nitrogen (N) assimilation such as glutamate (Glu) or glutamine (Gln) might serve as signals of organic N status that in turn regulate gene expression. To identify genome-wide responses to such organic N signals, Arabidopsis seedlings were transiently treated with ammonium nitrate in the presence or absence of MSX, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, resulting in a block of Glu/Gln synthesis. Genes that responded to organic N were identified as those whose response to ammonium nitrate treatment was blocked in the presence of MSX. We showed that some genes previously identified to be regulated by nitrate are under the control of an organic N-metabolite. Using an integrated network model of molecular interactions, we uncovered a subnetwork regulated by organic N that included CCA1 and target genes involved in N-assimilation. We validated some of the predicted interactions and showed that regulation of the master clock control gene CCA1 by Glu or a Glu-derived metabolite in turn regulates the expression of key N-assimilatory genes. Phase response curve analysis shows that distinct N-metabolites can advance or delay the CCA1 phase. Regulation of CCA1 by organic N signals may represent a novel input mechanism for N-nutrients to affect plant circadian clock function.

Discussion

We used genomic and pharmacological approaches to distinguish organic from inorganic N responses in Arabidopsis seedlings. The majority of the genes regulated by the N treatments used in our study (81%) responded to organic N signals. Among the genes regulated by organic N, we distinguished two classes of genes: ( i ) genes that responded only to external Glu application and ( ii ) genes that responded to internal and external sources of Glu ( Table 1 ). The difference in these two expression patterns raises the possibility that there are different mechanisms for sensing internally produced cellular Glu versus extra cellular Glu. The other possibility is that the differences in internal versus external Glu responses observed in our study reflect distinct threshold responses to Glu levels. There is precedence for internal and external Glu-sensing mechanisms in other organisms. Bacteria regulate ammonium assimilation via a mechanism involving PII, a sensor that measures levels of α-ketoglutarate and Glu ( 20 ). Plants contain a PII protein that is localized to chloroplasts ( 21 ), a potential sensor of internal levels of Glu. By contrast, extracellular Glu is sensed by Glu receptors in animal brains ( 22 ). The presence of Glu receptor genes in plants ( 23 ) raises the possibility that Glu receptors in plants may serve to sense levels of external apoplastic transported Glu.

Analysis of the genes regulated by N identified a gene network with transcription factors that appear to regulate the expression of N-assimilatory genes. New to this study is the finding that the NR genes ( NIA1 and NIA2 ) are repressed by organic N, as is GLN1.3 , which is involved in Gln biosynthesis. Within this N-regulated network we also found genes involved in N uptake and metabolism including an ammonium transporter ( AMT1.1 ), genes involved in assimilating N into and out of Asn ( ASN1 and ANS ), and amino acid transporter genes. Organic N negatively regulated AMT1.1 and ANS but induced the ASN1 gene. We therefore hypothesized that, in the presence of Glu or a Glu-derived metabolite, Asn production is optimized and regulated at the level of transcription by increasing levels of ASN1 and decreasing levels of ANS transcripts. Our results are consistent with Asn serving as a major N storage compound ( 24 ) controlled by the ASN1 gene and suggest a mechanism to maximize Asn production, degradation, and distribution depending on levels of internal sources of organic N.

The network analysis proposed a mechanism for transcriptional regulation of N-assimilation. ASN1 was a predicted target of the transcription factor bZIP1; GDH1 , GLN1.3 , and bZIP1 were predicted targets of GLK1 and CCA1. Because bZIP1 is also regulated by carbon ( 13 ), this gene may be an integrator of C and N signaling for regulation of N-assimilation in Arabidopsis . We validated our network model by measuring mRNA levels of the target genes in CCA1-ox and glk1 knockout lines. As predicted, ASN1 and GDH1 mRNA levels were down-regulated and GLN1.3 mRNA was elevated in the CCA1 -ox line. In contrast, mRNA levels for these three genes were not affected in the glk1 knockout line. The lack of a molecular phenotype in the glk1 knockout may be explained by the fact that CCA1 and GLK1 are predicted to have the same regulatory function in the subnetwork. We also validated the predictions that CCA1 directly targets a number of genes in the network using CCA1 antibodies in ChIP experiments. Because CCA1 is one of the central components of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis , regulation of CCA1 expression in response to organic N suggests that the circadian clock may receive N-nutritional inputs in plants. Thus, in addition to light and temperature ( 17 , 25 ), nutrients—such as N—may act as input for the clock. Our phase response curve analysis results are consistent with weak (type 1) resetting similar to those observed in response to light pulses in Lemna gibba ( 26 ), KCl, or ethanol pulses in Phaseolus coccineus ( 27 ) and cAMP or imidazole pulses in Trifolium repens ( 28 ), strengthening the hypothesis that N status feeds back to the clock, at least in part through its effect on CCA1 expression. In Arabidopsis , light pulses evoke strong delays (≈8 h) in the early night and strong advances (5–10 h) later in the night ( 29 ). Although the molecular basis of these phase shifts is not definitively established, they may involve induction of CCA1 by light ( 14 ). In our experiments, N treatment would decrease CCA1 mRNA abundance. That this elicits only small phase shifts suggests that posttranscriptional regulation buffers against CCA1 activity changes from reduced mRNA, at least over the time frames tested with our 4-h N pulses. Alternatively, N treatment may also modulate other clock components at the mRNA, protein abundance, or protein activity level in ways that reduce the magnitude of the phase shifts in response to CCA1 mRNA decrease. The emerging view of the circadian clock is as a key integrator of multiple metabolic and physiologic processes ( 19 , 30 ). As such it receives input not only from environmental stimuli but also from multiple metabolic pathways, many of which are subject to circadian regulation. Thus, the clock regulates a number of steps in N metabolism, such as NR expression and activity ( 18 ) and ASN1 expression [this and previous studies ( 19 )]. In turn, N status feeds back to the clock, at least in part through its effect on CCA1 expression. This feedback is more subtle than the effects of saturating light pulses, and our results are consistent with N status fine-tuning clock function rather than conferring large changes such as those observed in response to light ( Fig. 4 ).

Oscillations in the mRNA of genes that code for metabolic enzymes could have an impact on metabolite levels, as recently shown ( 31 ). Predicting time of food availability is key for the survival in most animals ( 32 ). Our data suggest that this may also be the case in Arabidopsis , e.g., anticipating the availability of carbon skeletons produced by photosynthesis to assimilate inorganic N into amino acids. Moreover, our data provide a plausible molecular mechanism for how this could happen in plants via CCA1 . Our study thus provides evidence that plant nutrition, like in animals, is tightly linked to circadian functions as previously hypothesized ( 19 ). Recently, it was shown that the central clock gene Per2 is necessary for food anticipation in mice ( 33 ). Our data indicate that the central clock gene CCA1 plays a role in circadian regulation of N-assimilation in plants. Our data are consistent with a model in which the N-assimilatory pathway is a downstream target of the clock with CCA1 being the direct regulatory factor. Moreover, Glu or other Glu-derived signals act as input to the circadian clock providing a link between plant N-nutrition and circadian rhythms ( Fig. 4 ).
