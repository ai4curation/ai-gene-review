Agrin is a basement membrane-associated proteoglycan that induces the formation 
of postsynaptic specializations at the neuromuscular junction. This activity is 
modulated by alternative splicing and is thought to be mediated by receptors 
expressed in muscle fibers. An isoform of agrin that does not induce 
postsynaptic specializations binds with high affinity to dystroglycan, a 
component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Transcripts encoding this 
agrin isoform are expressed in a variety of non-muscle tissues. Here, we 
analyzed the tissue distribution of agrin and dystroglycan on the protein level 
and determined their binding affinities. We found that agrin is most abundant in 
lung, kidney, and brain. Only a little agrin was detected in skeletal muscle, 
and no agrin was found in liver. Dystroglycan was highly expressed in all 
tissues examined except in liver. In a solid-phase radioligand binding assay, 
agrin bound to dystroglycan from lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle with a 
dissociation constant between 1.8 and 2.2 nM, while the affinity to 
brain-derived dystroglycan was 4.6 nM. In adult kidney and lung, agrin 
co-purified and co-immunoprecipitated with dystroglycan, and both molecules were 
co-localized in embryonic tissue. These data show that the agrin isoform 
expressed in non-muscle tissue is a high-affinity binding partner of 
dystroglycan and they suggest that this interaction, like that between laminin 
and dystroglycan, may be important for the mechanical integrity of the tissue.
