Constitutive overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in myocytes 
protects them from apoptosis and interferes with myocyte hypertrophy in the 
normal and pathological heart. Conversely, angiotensin II (Ang II) triggers cell 
death and promotes myocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, activation of p53 upregulates 
the cellular renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Therefore, IGF-1 overexpression in 
FVB.Igf+/- mice may downregulate the local RAS through the attenuation of p53 
and p53-inducible genes. On this basis, p53 DNA binding activity to 
angiotensinogen (Aogen), bax, and the AT1 receptor was determined in left 
ventricular myocytes from FVB.Igf-/- and FVB.Igf+/- mice. The quantity of Bax, 
Bcl-2, Aogen, and AT1 receptor in these cells was evaluated. The presence of 
Mdm2-p53 complexes was also established. Finally, Ang II levels in myocytes were 
measured. Upregulation of IGF-1 in myocytes was associated with a 
protein-to-protein interaction between Mdm2 and p53, which attenuated p53 
transcriptional activity for bax, Aogen, and AT1 receptor. Similarly, the amount 
of Bax, Aogen, and AT1 receptor proteins in these cells decreased. In contrast, 
the expression of Bcl-2 remained constant. The downregulation of Aogen in 
myocytes from FVB.Igf+/- mice was characterized by a reduction in Ang II. In 
conclusion, IGF-1 negatively influences the myocyte RAS through the upregulation 
of Mdm2 and its binding to p53. This may represent the molecular mechanism 
responsible for the effects of IGF-1 on cell viability and myocyte hypertrophy 
in the nonpathological and pathological heart in vivo.
