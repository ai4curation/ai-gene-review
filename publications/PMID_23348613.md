Prolyl oligopeptidase is a serine protease that cleaves peptides shorter 30-mer 
at carboxyl side of an internal proline. This enzyme has been proposed to be 
involved in the maturation and degradation of peptide hormones and 
neuropeptides. However, conclusive results have not yet been reported, and the 
primary physiological role remains to be elucidated. Here, we describe the 
identification of a novel protein that interacts with prolyl oligopeptidase in a 
human neuroblastoma cell line NB-1. Using an affinity column with immobilized 
recombinant human prolyl oligopeptidase as ligand, we identified 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a novel prolyl oligopeptidase 
binding protein in NB-1 cell extracts. The interaction between prolyl 
oligopeptidase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was confirmed by 
immunoprecipitation both in vitro and in vivo. To study the functional relevance 
of prolyl oligopeptidase-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase interactions, 
we investigated whether this interaction was involved in cytosine 
arabinoside-induced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase nuclear 
translocation and cell death. Prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor, SUAM-14746, and 
prolyl oligopeptidase knockdown successfully inhibited 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase translocation and promoted the survival 
of cytosine arabinoside-treated NB-1 cells. We also found that the interactions 
between prolyl oligopeptidase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in 
the cytoplasm but not in nuclei of NB-1 cell treated with cytosine arabinoside 
using an in situ proximity ligation assay. These results indicate that the 
interaction between prolyl oligopeptidase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase is required for cytosine arabinoside-induced 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase nuclear translocation and cell death. 
Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrate a novel function for 
prolyl oligopeptidase in cell death.
