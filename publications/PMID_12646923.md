Interactions between ligands and receptors are central to communication between 
cells and tissues. Human airway epithelia constitutively produce both a ligand, 
the growth factor heregulin, and its receptors--erbB2, erbB3 and erbB4 (refs 
1-3). Although heregulin binding initiates cellular proliferation and 
differentiation, airway epithelia have a low rate of cell division. This raises 
the question of how ligand-receptor interactions are controlled in epithelia. 
Here we show that in differentiated human airway epithelia, heregulin-alpha is 
present exclusively in the apical membrane and the overlying airway surface 
liquid, physically separated from erbB2-4, which segregate to the basolateral 
membrane. This physical arrangement creates a ligand-receptor pair poised for 
activation whenever epithelial integrity is disrupted. Indeed, immediately 
following a mechanical injury, heregulin-alpha activates erbB2 in cells at the 
edge of the wound, and this process hastens restoration of epithelial integrity. 
Likewise, when epithelial cells are not separated into apical and basolateral 
membranes ('polarized'), or when tight junctions between adjacent cells are 
opened, heregulin-alpha activates its receptor. This mechanism of 
ligand-receptor segregation on either side of epithelial tight junctions may be 
vital for rapid restoration of integrity following injury, and hence critical 
for survival. This model also suggests a mechanism for abnormal receptor 
activation in diseases with increased epithelial permeability.
