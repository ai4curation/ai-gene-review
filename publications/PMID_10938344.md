Brassinosteroid (BR) mutants of Arabidopsis have pleiotropic phenotypes and 
provide evidence that BRs function throughout the life of the plant from 
seedling development to senescence. Screens for BR signaling mutants identified 
one locus, BRI1, which encodes a protein with homology to leucine-rich repeat 
receptor serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) kinases. Twenty-seven alleles of this 
putative BR receptor have been isolated to date, and we present here the 
identification of the molecular lesions of 14 recessive alleles that represent 
five new mutations. BR-insensitive-1 (BRI1) is expressed at high levels in the 
meristem, root, shoot, and hypocotyl of seedlings and at lower levels later in 
development. Confocal microscopy analysis of full-length BRI1 fused to green 
fluorescent protein indicates that BRI1 is localized in the plasma membrane, and 
an in vitro kinase assay indicates that BRI1 is a functional Ser/Thr kinase. 
Among the bri1 mutants identified are mutants in the kinase domain, and we 
demonstrate that one of these mutations severely impairs BRI1 kinase activity. 
Therefore, we conclude that BRI1 is a ubiquitously expressed leucine-rich repeat 
receptor that plays a role in BR signaling through Ser/Thr phosphorylation.

Abstract

Brassinosteroid (BR) mutants of Arabidopsis have pleiotropic phenotypes and provide evidence that BRs function throughout the life of the plant from seedling development to senescence. Screens for BR signaling mutants identified one locus, BRI1 , which encodes a protein with homology to leucine-rich repeat receptor serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) kinases. Twenty-seven alleles of this putative BR receptor have been isolated to date, and we present here the identification of the molecular lesions of 14 recessive alleles that represent five new mutations. BR-insensitive-1 (BRI1) is expressed at high levels in the meristem, root, shoot, and hypocotyl of seedlings and at lower levels later in development. Confocal microscopy analysis of full-length BRI1 fused to green fluorescent protein indicates that BRI1 is localized in the plasma membrane, and an in vitro kinase assay indicates that BRI1 is a functional Ser/Thr kinase. Among the bri1 mutants identified are mutants in the kinase domain, and we demonstrate that one of these mutations severely impairs BRI1 kinase activity. Therefore, we conclude that BRI1 is a ubiquitously expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor that plays a role in BR signaling through Ser/Thr phosphorylation.
