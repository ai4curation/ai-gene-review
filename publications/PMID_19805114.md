Mutations in the rhodopsin gene that disrupt the encoded protein's folding 
properties are a major cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). 
This disease is faithfully modeled in Drosophila where similar mutations in the 
ninaE gene, encoding rhodopsin-1 (Rh-1), cause ER stress and dominantly trigger 
age-related retinal degeneration. In addition, mutant flies bearing certain 
ninaE alleles have dramatically reduced Rh-1 protein levels, but the underlying 
mechanism for this reduction and significance of its contribution to the ADRP 
phenotype remains unclear. To address this question, we specifically analyzed 
the role of Drosophila genes homologous to the known yeast and animal regulators 
of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, a process that reduces levels 
of misfolded proteins in the ER through proteasomal degradation. We found that 
loss-of-function of these putative ERAD factors resulted in increased levels of 
Rh-1 in ninaE mutant flies. Conversely, in an ER stress assay where mutant or 
wild-type Rh-1 were overexpressed in developing imaginal discs beyond the ER 
protein folding capacity of those cells, co-expression of certain ERAD factors 
was sufficient to reduce Rh-1 protein levels and to completely suppress ER 
stress reporter activation. Significantly, those ERAD factors that specifically 
reduced misfolded Rh-1 in the imaginal disc assay also delayed age-related 
retinal degeneration caused by an endogenous ninaE allele, indicating that ERAD 
acts as a protective mechanism against retinal degeneration in the Drosophila 
model for ADRP. These results suggest that manipulation of ERAD may serve as a 
powerful therapeutic strategy against a number of diseases associated with ER 
stress.
