Approximately 10% of human protein kinases are believed to be inactive and named 
pseudokinases because they lack residues required for catalysis. Here, we show 
that the highly conserved pseudokinase selenoprotein-O (SelO) transfers AMP from 
ATP to Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues on protein substrates (AMPylation), uncovering 
a previously unrecognized activity for a member of the protein kinase 
superfamily. The crystal structure of a SelO homolog reveals a protein 
kinase-like fold with ATP flipped in the active site, thus providing a 
structural basis for catalysis. SelO pseudokinases localize to the mitochondria 
and AMPylate proteins involved in redox homeostasis. Consequently, SelO activity 
is necessary for the proper cellular response to oxidative stress. Our results 
suggest that AMPylation may be a more widespread post-translational modification 
than previously appreciated and that pseudokinases should be analyzed for 
alternative transferase activities.
