Dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine release has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of several life-threatening acute lung illnesses such as pneumonia, 
sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Suppressors of cytokine 
signaling proteins, particularly SOCS2, have recently been described as 
antiinflammatory mediators. However, the regulation of SOCS2 protein has not 
been described. Here we describe a mechanism of SOCS2 regulation by the action 
of the ubiquitin E3 ligase KIAA0317. KIAA0317-mediated degradation of SOCS2 
exacerbated inflammation in vitro, and depletion of KIAA0317 in vivo ameliorated 
pulmonary inflammation. KIAA0317-knockout mice exhibited resistance to 
LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation, while KIAA03017 reexpression mitigated this 
effect. We uncovered a small molecule inhibitor of KIAA0317 protein (BC-1365) 
that prevented SOCS2 degradation and attenuated LPS- and P. aeruginosa-induced 
lung inflammation in vivo. These studies show KIAA0317 to be a critical mediator 
of pulmonary inflammation through its degradation of SOCS2 and a potential 
candidate target for therapeutic inhibition.
