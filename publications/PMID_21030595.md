HDAC3 is a member of the class I histone deacetylase family that regulates gene 
expression by deacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. HDAC3 activity 
has been shown to be modulated by interaction with the co-repressors NCoR and 
SMRT. Here, we present evidence that the nuclear protein DBC1 is an endogenous 
inhibitor of HDAC3. DBC1 has been previously identified as a regulator of some 
nuclear receptors, the methyltransferase SUV39H1, and the NAD-dependent 
deacetylase SIRT1. Furthermore, DBC1 has been shown to influence transcription 
regulation and apoptosis, and it may also act as a tumor suppressor. We found 
that DBC1 interacts and specifically inhibits the deacetylase HDAC3. This 
interaction depends on the N terminus of DBC1 and the C terminus of HDAC3. 
Expression of DBC1 not only inhibited HDAC3 activity but also altered its 
subcellular distribution. In addition, knockdown of endogenous DBC1 in cells and 
knock-out in mouse tissues increased HDAC3 deacetylase activity. Together, these 
results identify DBC1 as a new regulator of HDAC3 and demonstrate that DBC1 is a 
negative regulator of two key distinct deacetylases, SIRT1 and HDAC3. These 
findings may lead to a better understanding of the biological roles of DBC1 and 
HDAC3 in metabolic diseases and cancer.
