A human DNA damage binding protein implicated in the DNA excision repair 
disorder xeroderma pigmentosum E was purified to near homogeneity from HeLa 
cells. The protein is abundant (approximately 10(5) copies/cell) and has a 
native molecular weight of 154,000-163,000 as estimated by gel filtration and 
glycerol gradient sedimentation. DNA damage binding activity copurified with 
polypeptides of 124 and 41 kDa. Based on the native molecular weight, 
cosedimentation of both polypeptides with DNA damage binding activity on 
glycerol gradients, and a molar ratio of approximately 1:1 for the two 
polypeptides, it appears that p124 and p41 are subunits of a heterodimeric 
protein. Binding to damaged DNA was resistant to K+ concentrations approaching 1 
M, but showed anion-specific sensitivity to Cl- concentrations above 0.5 M, 
suggesting that the majority of the binding energy is contributed by nonionic 
interactions. In contrast to previous reports, the DNA damage binding protein 
was shown to recognize cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in addition to a 
nonphotoreactivable lesion(s), most likely the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) 
photoproduct.
