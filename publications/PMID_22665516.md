Chaperones and foldases in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ensure correct protein 
folding. Extensive protein-protein interaction maps have defined the 
organization and function of many cellular complexes, but ER complexes are 
under-represented. Consequently, chaperone and foldase networks in the ER are 
largely uncharacterized. Using complementary ER-specific methods, we have mapped 
interactions between ER-lumenal chaperones and foldases and describe their 
organization in multiprotein complexes. We identify new functional chaperone 
modules, including interactions between protein-disulfide isomerases and 
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerases. We have examined in detail a novel 
ERp72-cyclophilin B complex that enhances the rate of folding of immunoglobulin 
G. Deletion analysis and NMR reveal a conserved surface of cyclophilin B that 
interacts with polyacidic stretches of ERp72 and GRp94. Mutagenesis within this 
highly charged surface region abrogates interactions with its chaperone partners 
and reveals a new mechanism of ER protein-protein interaction. This ability of 
cyclophilin B to interact with different partners using the same molecular 
surface suggests that ER-chaperone/foldase partnerships may switch depending on 
the needs of different substrates, illustrating the flexibility of 
multichaperone complexes of the ER folding machinery.
