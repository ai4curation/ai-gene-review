Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is 
caused by an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the SCA2 gene, encoding a 
polyglutamine stretch in the gene product ataxin-2. Although evidence has been 
provided that ataxin-2 is involved in RNA metabolism, the physiological function 
of ataxin-2 remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ataxin-2 interacts with 
two members of the endophilin family, endophilin-A1 and endophilin-A3. To 
elucidate the physiological implications of these interactions, we exploited 
yeast as a model system and discovered that expression of ataxin-2 as well as 
both endophilin proteins is toxic for yeast lacking the SAC6 gene product 
fimbrin, a protein involved in actin filament organization and endocytotic 
processes. Intriguingly, expression of huntingtin, another polyglutamine protein 
interacting with endophilin-A3, was also toxic in Deltasac6 yeast. These effects 
can be suppressed by simultaneous expression of one of the two human fimbrin 
orthologs, L- or T-plastin. Moreover, we have discovered that ataxin-2 
associates with L- and T-plastin and that overexpression of ataxin-2 leads to 
accumulation of T-plastin in mammalian cells. Thus, our findings suggest an 
interplay between ataxin-2, endophilin proteins and huntingtin in 
plastin-associated cellular pathways.
