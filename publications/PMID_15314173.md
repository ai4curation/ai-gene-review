The p53-MDM2 feedback loop is vital for cell growth control and is subjected to 
multiple regulations in response to various stress signals. Here we report 
another regulator of this loop. Using an immunoaffinity method, we purified an 
MDM2-associated protein complex that contains the ribosomal protein L23. L23 
interacted with MDM2, forming a complex independent of the 80S ribosome and 
polysome. The interaction of L23 with MDM2 was enhanced by treatment with 
actinomycin D but not by gamma-irradiation, leading to p53 activation. This 
activation was inhibited by small interfering RNA against L23. Ectopic 
expression of L23 reduced MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and also induced p53 
activity and G(1) arrest in p53-proficient U2OS cells but not in p53-deficient 
Saos-2 cells. These results reveal that L23 is another regulator of the p53-MDM2 
feedback regulation.

Abstract

The p53-MDM2 feedback loop is vital for cell growth control and is subjected to multiple regulations in response to various stress signals. Here we report another regulator of this loop. Using an immunoaffinity method, we purified an MDM2-associated protein complex that contains the ribosomal protein L23. L23 interacted with MDM2, forming a complex independent of the 80S ribosome and polysome. The interaction of L23 with MDM2 was enhanced by treatment with actinomycin D but not by gamma-irradiation, leading to p53 activation. This activation was inhibited by small interfering RNA against L23. Ectopic expression of L23 reduced MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and also induced p53 activity and G 1 arrest in p53-proficient U2OS cells but not in p53-deficient Saos-2 cells. These results reveal that L23 is another regulator of the p53-MDM2 feedback regulation.

DISCUSSION

The p53-MDM2 feedback loop is regulated by distinct pathways in response to different stress signals ( 48 ). Here we have described a ribosomal protein that regulates this loop in response to ribosomal biogenesis stress. First, we have purified an MDM2-associated cytoplasmic complex by immunoaffinity purification from human 293 cells. This complex contains multiple ribosomal proteins, including the previously reported L5 ( 37 ), the recently reported L11 ( 35 , 74 ), and a new componentâ€”the ribosomal protein L23 (Fig. 1 ). Our further characterization of this complex indicates that L23, unlike L5, which binds to the first acidic region (aa 221 to 274) of MDM2 ( 15 ), and L11, which binds to aa 284 to 374 of MDM2 ( 35 , 74 ), preferentially binds to the second acidic domain (aa 384 to 425) of MDM2 with a minor binding site at the first acidic domain (Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, L23 appears to interact with MDM2 in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm when they are overexpressed (Fig. 2 ). In response to actinomycin D, this interaction may mostly occur in the nuclei of U2OS cells (data not shown). Functionally, ectopic expression of L23 inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 degradation and thus induces p53 levels as well as its activity (Fig. 6 ). L23 also leads to p53-dependent G 1 arrest (Fig. 7 ) by inducing p53-dependent p21 cip1 production (Fig. 6 ). Finally, the interaction between L23 and MDM2 is dramatically enhanced by a low dose of actinomycin D that only inhibits rRNA synthesis. Further, removal of endogenous L23 molecules by siRNA alleviates p53 induction by this drug (Fig. 9 ). Hence, our study documents L23 as another possible regulator of the p53-MDM2 feedback pathway in response to ribosomal biogenesis perturbation.
