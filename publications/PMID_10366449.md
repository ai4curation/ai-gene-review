We have isolated a human gene homologous to Drosophila melanogaster rotated 
abdomen, rt, a poorly viable recessive mutation causing a clockwise twisted 
abdomen in affected flies due to defects in embryonic muscle development. The 
human gene, like rt, encodes a protein with high homology to the yeast 
mannosyl-transferases (Pmts) and has been named POMT1. POMT1 is expressed as a 
3.1-kb transcript in all tissues tested, with highest levels in testis and fetal 
brain. Alternative splicing of several exons in all tissues predicts the 
generation of several protein isoforms. The most common mRNA variant encodes a 
725-aa protein with 40% identity and 62.5% similarity to rt, as well as 30.5% 
identity and 54% similarity to yeast Pmts. Computer prediction of protein 
sorting suggests that the POMT1 product could be an integral protein of the 
endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Given the strong conservation of protein motifs 
between POMT1 and the yeast Pmts, POMT1 may function as a mannosyl-transferase 
involved in O-mannosylation of proteins, being the first of such a class found 
in mammals. The POMT1 locus has been assigned to human chromosome 9q34.1 by 
somatic cell hybrids, radiation hybrids, and linkage analysis. On the basis of 
the rt phenotype, POMT1 could be a candidate for uncharacterized genetic 
disorders of the muscular system, such as some forms of congenital muscular 
dystrophy or congenital myopathy.
