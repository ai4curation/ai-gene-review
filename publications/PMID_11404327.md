The CCR4-NOT complex is involved in the regulation of gene expression both 
positively and negatively. The repressive effects of the complex appear to 
result in part from restricting TBP access to noncanonical TATAA binding sites 
presumably through interaction with multiple TAF proteins. We provide here 
genetic evidence that the CCR4-NOT complex also plays a role in transcriptional 
elongation. First, defects in CCR4-NOT components as well as overexpression of 
the NOT4 gene elicited 6-azauracil (6AU) and mycophenolic acid sensitivities, 
hallmarks of transcriptional elongation defects. A number of other transcription 
initiation factors known to interact with the CCR4-NOT complex did not elicit 
these phenotypes nor did defects in factors that reduced mRNA degradation and 
hence the recycling of NTPs. Second, deletion of ccr4 resulted in severe 
synthetic effects with mutations or deletions in the known elongation factors 
RPB2, TFIIS, and SPT16. Third, the ccr4 deletion displayed allele-specific 
interactions with rpb1 alleles that are thought to be important in the control 
of elongation. Finally, we found that a ccr4 deletion as well as overexpression 
of the NOT1 gene specifically suppressed the cold-sensitive phenotype associated 
with the spt5-242 allele. The only other known suppressors of this spt5-242 
allele are factors involved in slowing transcriptional elongation. These genetic 
results are consistent with the model that the CCR4-NOT complex, in addition to 
its known effects on initiation, plays a role in aiding the elongation process.
