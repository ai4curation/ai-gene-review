Transcription from the asparagine synthetase (A.S.) gene is increased in 
response to either amino acid (amino acid response) or glucose (endoplasmic 
reticulum stress response) deprivation. These two independent pathways converge 
on the same set of genomic cis-elements within the A.S. promoter referred to as 
nutrient-sensing response elements (NSRE) 1 and 2, both of which are necessary 
for gene activation. The NSRE-1 sequence was used to screen ATF/CREB family 
members by electrophoresis mobility shift assays and supershift by specific 
antibodies. The results indicated that ATF4 binds to the NSRE-1 sequence and 
that the amount of the ATF4 complex was increased when extracts from amino 
acid-deprived or glucose-deprived cells were tested. Using electrophoresis 
mobility shift assay experiments and a probe that contained both NSRE-1 and 
NSRE-2, mutation of the NSRE-1 sequence completely prevented formation of the 
ATF4-containing complexes, whereas mutation of the NSRE-2 sequence did not. 
Overexpression of ATF4 increased A.S. promoter-driven transcription, whereas an 
inhibitory dominant negative ATF4 mutant blocked both basal and 
starvation-enhanced transcription. Collectively, the results provide both in 
vitro and in vivo evidence for a role of ATF4 in the transcriptional activation 
of the A.S. gene in response to nutrient deprivation.
