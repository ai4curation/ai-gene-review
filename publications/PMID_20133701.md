Corepressors play an essential role in nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional 
repression. In general, corepressors directly bind to nuclear receptors via 
CoRNR boxes (L/I-X-X-I/V-I) in the absence of ligand and appear to act as 
scaffolds to further recruit chromatin remodeling complexes to specific target 
genes. Here, we describe the identification of the multiple LIM domain protein 
Ajuba as a unique corepressor for a subset of nuclear hormone receptors. Ajuba 
contains functional nuclear-receptor interacting motifs and selectively 
interacts with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and rexinoid receptor (RXRs) 
subtypes in a ligand-dependent manner. Simultaneous mutation of these motifs 
abolishes RAR binding and concomitantly leads to loss of repression on RARE 
reporter genes. P19 cells depleted of Ajuba are highly sensitized to all-trans 
retinoic acid (atRA)-induced transcription and differentiation. In the absence 
of atRA, Ajuba can be readily found at the RARE control elements of RAR 
endogenous target genes. Stimulation of cells with atRA results in the 
dissociation of Ajuba from these regions. Moreover, we observed that 
coexpression of the known Ajuba binding partner Prmt5 (protein arginine 
methyltransferase-5) inhibited the Ajuba/RAR interaction. The high-affinity 
Ajuba-RAR/RXR interaction site overlaps the region responsible for Ajuba/Prmt5 
binding, and thus binding appears to be mutually exclusive, providing a 
potential mechanism for these observations. Identification of Ajuba as a unique 
corepressor for nuclear receptors sheds new light on mechanisms for nuclear 
receptor-mediated repression and provides a unique target for developing more 
effective therapeutics to modulate this important pathway.
