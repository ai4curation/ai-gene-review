Mutations in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been 
linked to increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Neurobiological functions of 
TREM2 and its pathophysiological ligands remain elusive. Here we found that 
TREM2 directly binds to β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers with nanomolar affinity, 
whereas AD-associated TREM2 mutations reduce Aβ binding. TREM2 deficiency 
impairs Aβ degradation in primary microglial culture and mouse brain. Aβ-induced 
microglial depolarization, K+ inward current induction, cytokine expression and 
secretion, migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and morphological changes are 
dependent on TREM2. In addition, TREM2 interaction with its signaling adaptor 
DAP12 is enhanced by Aβ, regulating downstream phosphorylation of SYK and GSK3β. 
Our data demonstrate TREM2 as a microglial Aβ receptor transducing physiological 
and AD-related pathological effects associated with Aβ.
