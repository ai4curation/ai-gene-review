The endothelial monolayer forms a barrier between the lumen of blood vessels and 
the underlying tissues. Stable VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions are 
essential for maintaining this barrier, whereas their remodeling is required for 
angiogenesis in health and disease. Here, we position the ERAD-associated 
ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 as a determinant of angiogenic sprouting and barrier 
integrity through its ability to promote the degradation of the rate-limiting 
cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Accordingly, MARCHF6 
ablation in endothelial cells increases SQLE protein and cholesterol load. This 
leads to altered membrane order, disorganized adherens junctions, decreased 
endothelial barrier function, and impaired SQLE-dependent sprouting 
angiogenesis. Akin to MARCHF6 silencing, the overexpression of SQLE impairs 
angiogenesis. However, angiogenesis is also attenuated when SQLE is silenced, 
indicating that fine-tuning cholesterol biosynthesis is a determinant of healthy 
endothelial function. In summary, we propose a mechanistic link between 
regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by the MARCH6-SQLE axis and endothelial 
integrity and angiogenesis.
