Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which amyloid β 
plaques are a pathological characteristic. Little is known about the 
physiological functions of amyloid β precursor protein (APP). Based on its 
structure as a type I transmembrane protein, it has been proposed that APP might 
be a receptor, but so far, no ligand has been reported. In the present study, 9 
proteins binding to the extracellular domain of APP were identified using a 
yeast two-hybrid system. After confirming the interactions in the mammalian 
system, mutated PLP1, members of the FLRT protein family, and KCTD16 were shown 
to interact with APP. These proteins have been reported to be involved in 
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and axon guidance. Therefore, our results 
shed light on the mechanisms of physiological function of APP in AD, PMD, and 
axon guidance.

Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which amyloid β plaques are a pathological characteristic. Little is known about the physiological functions of amyloid β precursor protein (APP). Based on its structure as a type I transmembrane protein, it has been proposed that APP might be a receptor, but so far, no ligand has been reported. In the present study, 9 proteins binding to the extracellular domain of APP were identified using a yeast two-hybrid system. After confirming the interactions in the mammalian system, mutated PLP1, members of the FLRT protein family, and KCTD16 were shown to interact with APP. These proteins have been reported to be involved in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and axon guidance. Therefore, our results shed light on the mechanisms of physiological function of APP in AD, PMD, and axon guidance.

Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid widely scattered in the brain. The beta-amyloid is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic processing. APP is a type I transmembrane protein with a long extracellular domain and a short intracellular domain and is involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion [ 1 – 4 ], and axon guidance [ 5 , 6 ]. Although the mechanisms underlying AD are far from being fully understood, it is possible that disturbance of APP function may contribute to the disease process.

An important approach to the study of APP function is to explore its binding partners. So far, many proteins including F-spondin [ 7 ], apolipoprotein E [ 8 ], Fe65 [ 9 , 10 ], and JNK-interacting protein 1 [ 11 ] have been reported to interact with APP. However, the physiological function of APP is not fully understood due to its unknown binding proteins. Also, the structure of APP indicates that it may function as a cellular receptor. Therefore, finding the possible ligands of APP is of importance in revealing its physiological and pathological functions. The yeast two-hybrid method is a powerful tool for discovering unknown protein-protein interactions, so we used the extracellular domain of APP 695 as the bait to identify possible membrane or secreted binding proteins.
