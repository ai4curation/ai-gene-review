We have previously shown that a forkhead transcription factor Foxa1 interacts 
with androgen signaling and controls prostate differentiated response. Here, we 
show the mouse Foxa1 expression marks the entire embryonic urogenital sinus 
epithelium (UGE), contrasting with Shh and Foxa2, which are restricted to the 
basally located cells during prostate budding. The Foxa1-deficient mouse 
prostate shows a severely altered ductal pattern that resembles primitive 
epithelial cords surrounded by thick stromal layers. Characterization of these 
mutant cells indicates a population of basal-like cells similar to those found 
in the embryonic UGE, whereas no differentiated or mature luminal epithelial 
cells are found in Foxa1-deficient epithelium. These phenotypic changes are 
accompanied with molecular aberrations, including focal epithelial activation of 
Shh and elevated Foxa2 and Notch1 in the null epithelium. Perturbed 
epithelial-stromal interactions induced by Foxa1-deficient epithelium is 
evident, as demonstrated by the expansion of surrounding smooth muscle and 
elevated levels of stromal factors (Bmp4, Fgf7, Fgf10 and Gli). The prostatic 
homeobox protein Nkx3.1, a known proliferation inhibitor, was downregulated in 
Foxa1-deficient epithelial cells, while several prostate-specific 
androgen-regulated markers, including a novel Foxa1 target, are absent in the 
null prostate. These data indicate that Foxa1 plays a pivotal role in 
controlling prostate morphogenesis and cell differentiation.
