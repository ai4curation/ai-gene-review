In C. elegans, loss-of-function (lf) mutations of the stomatin-like protein 
(SLP) UNC-1 and the innexin UNC-9 inhibit locomotion [1, 2] and modulate 
sensitivity to volatile anesthetics [3, 4]. It was unknown why unc-1(lf) and 
unc-9(lf) mutants have similar phenotypes. We tested the hypothesis that UNC-1 
is a regulator of gap junctions formed by UNC-9. Analyses of junctional currents 
between body-wall muscle cells showed that electrical coupling was inhibited to 
a similar degree in unc-1(lf), unc-9(lf), and unc-1(lf);unc-9(lf) double 
mutants, suggesting that UNC-1 and UNC-9 function together. Expression of 
Punc-1::DsRED2 and Punc-9::GFP transcriptional fusions suggests that unc-1 and 
unc-9 are coexpressed in neurons and body-wall muscle cells. 
Immunohistochemistry showed that UNC-1 and UNC-9 colocalized at intercellular 
junctions and that unc-1(lf) did not alter UNC-9 expression or subcellular 
localization. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays suggest 
that UNC-1 and UNC-9 are physically very close at intercellular junctions. 
Targeted rescue experiments suggest that UNC-9 and UNC-1 function predominantly 
in neurons to control locomotion. Thus, in addition to the recently reported 
function of regulating mechanosensitive ion channels [5, 6], SLPs might have a 
novel function of regulating gap junctions.
