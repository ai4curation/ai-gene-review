Neutral ceramidase (nCDase) catalyzes conversion of the apoptosis-associated 
lipid ceramide to sphingosine, the precursor for the proliferative factor 
sphingosine-1-phosphate. As an enzyme regulating the balance of ceramide and 
sphingosine-1-phosphate, nCDase is emerging as a therapeutic target for cancer. 
Here, we present the 2.6-Å crystal structure of human nCDase in complex with 
phosphate that reveals a striking, 20-Å deep, hydrophobic active site pocket 
stabilized by a eukaryotic-specific subdomain not present in bacterial 
ceramidases. Utilizing flexible ligand docking, we predict a likely binding mode 
for ceramide that superimposes closely with the crystallographically observed 
transition state analog phosphate. Our results suggest that nCDase uses a new 
catalytic strategy for Zn(2+)-dependent amidases, and generates ceramide 
specificity by sterically excluding sphingolipids with bulky headgroups and 
specifically recognizing the small hydroxyl head group of ceramide. Together, 
these data provide a foundation to aid drug development and establish common 
themes for how proteins recognize the bioactive lipid ceramide.
