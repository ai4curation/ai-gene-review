Heritable phosphorylase kinase (Phk) deficiency is responsible for several forms 
of glycogen storage disease in humans and animals that differ in mode of 
inheritance and tissue-specificity. Mutations affecting different subunits and 
isoforms of Phk are expected to contribute to this heterogeneity. In the present 
study, we have investigated a case of muscle-specific, adult-onset Phk 
deficiency. The coding sequences of three candidate genes were analyzed by 
RT-PCR and sequencing: the muscle isoform of the alpha subunit (alpha M), a 
muscle-specifically expressed exon of the beta subunit, and the muscle isoform 
of the gamma subunit. Whereas the latter two sequences were found to be normal, 
we identified a nonsense mutation in alpha M. The condition of this patient 
therefore is a human homolog of the X-linked muscle Phk deficiency of I-strain 
mice. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a human Phk deficiency 
mutation.
