The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST displays remarkable substrate 
specificity, in vitro and in vivo for p130cas a signalling intermediate 
implicated in mitogenic signalling, cell-adhesion induced signalling, and in 
transformation by a variety of oncogenes. We have identified a high affinity 
interaction between the SH3 domain of p130cas and a proline-rich sequence 
(P335PPKPPR) within the C-terminal segment of PTP-PEST. Mutation of proline 337 
within this sequence to alanine significantly impairs the ability of PTP-PEST to 
recognise tyrosine phosphorylated p130cas as a substrate, without qualitatively 
affecting the selectivity of the interaction. Thus the highly specific nature of 
the interaction between PTP-PEST and p130cas appears to result from a 
combination of two distinct substrate recognition mechanisms; the catalytic 
domain of PTP-PEST contributes specificity to the interaction with p130cas, 
whereas the SH3 domain-mediated association of p130cas and PTP-PEST dramatically 
increases the efficiency of the interaction. Furthermore, our results indicate 
that one important function of the p130cas SH3 domain is to associate with 
PTP-PEST and thereby facilitate the dephosphorylation of p130cas, resulting in 
the termination of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signalling events 
downstream of p130cas.
