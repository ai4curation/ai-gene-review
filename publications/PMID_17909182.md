Deregulation of the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling is highly 
correlated with oncogenesis. Intracellular activated Notch (ICN) is a 
protooncogene linked to the transcription activation of a number of cellular 
genes involved in cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and proliferation. 
Stability of ICN is tightly regulated by the Sel10-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome 
pathway. Sel10 can function as a negative regulator of Notch and exhibits 
activities of a tumor-suppressor protein. This article shows that the Kaposi's 
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) 
directly interacts with Sel10 and forms a complex in KSHV-infected cells. This 
results in suppression of ICN ubiquitination and degradation. The carboxyl 
terminus of LANA interacts with the F-box and WD40 domains of Sel10 and competes 
with ICN for binding to Sel10. This elevated level of ICN is also critical for 
maintaining the enhanced proliferation of KSHV-infected tumor cells. These 
findings describe a mechanism by which the KSHV-encoded LANA protein regulates 
ubiquitination of ICN mediated by the F-box component of the E3 ligase Sel10, 
leading to proliferation of the virus-infected cells.
