We report the crystal structure of the middle domain of the Pob3 subunit 
(Pob3-M) of S. cerevisiae FACT (yFACT, facilitates chromatin transcription), 
which unexpectedly adopts an unusual double pleckstrin homology (PH) 
architecture. A mutation within a conserved surface cluster in this domain 
causes a defect in DNA replication that is suppressed by mutation of replication 
protein A (RPA). The nucleosome reorganizer yFACT therefore interacts in a 
physiologically important way with the central single-strand DNA (ssDNA) binding 
factor RPA to promote a step in DNA replication. Purified yFACT and RPA display 
a weak direct physical interaction, although the genetic suppression is not 
explained by simple changes in affinity between the purified proteins. Further 
genetic analysis suggests that coordinated function by yFACT and RPA is 
important during nucleosome deposition. These results support the model that the 
FACT family has an essential role in constructing nucleosomes during DNA 
replication, and suggest that RPA contributes to this process.
