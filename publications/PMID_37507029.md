Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) plays a key role in protein synthesis and 
in its regulation. The assembly of this heterotrimeric factor is facilitated by 
Cdc123, a member of the ATP grasp family that binds the γ subunit of eIF2. 
Notably, some mutations related to MEHMO syndrome, an X-linked intellectual 
disability, affect Cdc123-mediated eIF2 assembly. The mechanism of action of 
Cdc123 is unclear and structural information for the human protein is awaited. 
Here, the crystallographic structure of human Cdc123 (Hs-Cdc123) bound to domain 
3 of human eIF2γ (Hs-eIF2γD3) was determined. The structure shows that the 
domain 3 of eIF2γ is bound to domain 1 of Cdc123. In addition, the long 
C-terminal region of Hs-Cdc123 provides a link between the ATP and Hs-eIF2γD3 
binding sites. A thermal shift assay shows that ATP is tightly bound to Cdc123 
whereas the affinity of ADP is much smaller. Yeast cell viability experiments, 
western blot analysis and two-hybrid assays show that ATP is important for the 
function of Hs-Cdc123 in eIF2 assembly. These data and recent findings allow us 
to propose a refined model to explain the mechanism of action of Cdc123 in eIF2 
assembly.
