Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is an X-linked condition shown to be the 
result of deletions of the glypican-3 (GPC3) gene. GPC3 is a proteoglycan 
localized to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor. 
To further elucidate the GPC3 function(s), we have screened various cell lines 
for proteins that interact with GPC3, resulting in the isolation of a 115 kDa 
protein, identified as CD26. The interaction occurred with both the glycosylated 
and unglycosylated forms of GPC3 and led to the inhibition of CD26 peptidase 
activity. Moreover, introduction of CD26 into Cos-1 cells was accompanied by the 
up-regulation of cell growth, while inclusion of recombinant GPC3 in the media 
reduced the growth of CD26 transfected Cos-1 cells, drastically. Furthermore, 
HepG2 C3A cells containing CD26 underwent apoptosis in the presence of 
recombinant GPC3 in both concentration and time-dependant manner. In light of 
the fact that inhibition of CD26 reduces the rate of cell proliferation, we 
propose that a number of physical findings observed in SGBS patients may be a 
consequence of a direct interaction of GPC3 with CD26. Furthermore, GPC3 without 
the GPI anchor is capable of inducing apoptosis indicating that neither the GPI 
anchor nor the membrane attachment is required for apoptosis induction.
