The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is a protein-binding module that mediates 
the assembly of CARD-containing proteins into apoptosis and NF-kappaB signaling 
complexes. We report here that CARD protein 11 (CARD11) and CARD protein 14 
(CARD14) are novel CARD-containing proteins that belong to the 
membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, a class of proteins that 
functions as molecular scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes at 
specialized regions of the plasma membrane. CARD11 and CARD14 have homologous 
structures consisting of an N-terminal CARD domain, a central coiled-coil 
domain, and a C-terminal tripartite domain comprised of a PDZ domain, an Src 
homology 3 domain, and a GUK domain with homology to guanylate kinase. The CARD 
domains of both CARD11 and CARD14 associate specifically with the CARD domain of 
BCL10, a signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB through the IkappaB kinase 
complex in response to upstream stimuli. When expressed in cells, CARD11 and 
CARD14 activate NF-kappaB and induce the phosphorylation of BCL10. These 
findings suggest that CARD11 and CARD14 are novel MAGUK family members that 
function as upstream activators of BCL10 and NF-kappaB signaling.
