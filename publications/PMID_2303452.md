A 2.2-kilobase cDNA clone for human arylsulfatase B (ASB) and several genomic 
clones were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of 533 amino 
acids contains a 41-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and a mature 
polypeptide of 492 amino acid residues. Overexpression of ASB in transfected 
baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells resulted in up to 68-fold higher ASB activity 
than in untransfected BHK cells. Pulse-chase labeling showed that ASB was 
synthesized and secreted as a 64-kDa precursor and processed to a 47-kDa mature 
form in BHK cells. The 47-kDa ASB form was located in dense lysosomes. Transport 
of ASB to the lysosomes was accomplished in a mannose 6-phosphate 
receptor-dependent manner. The ASB cDNA clone hybridizes to 4.8-, 2.5-, and 
1.8-kilobase species of RNA from human fibroblasts. The same pattern was 
observed in RNA from fibroblasts of three Maroteaux-Lamy patients who were 
deficient in ASB activity, as well as in RNA from fibroblasts of three patients 
with multiple sulfatase deficiency, in which all known sulfatases were markedly 
diminished. Deduced amino acid sequences of human arylsulfatase A, human ASB, 
human steroid sulfatase, human glucosamine-6-sulfatase, and an arylsulfatase 
from sea urchin showed a substantial degree of similarity suggesting that they 
arose from a common ancestral gene and are members of an arylsulfatase gene 
family.
