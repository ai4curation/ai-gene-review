The modulation of adhesive interaction between lymphocyte progenitors and bone 
marrow stroma may critically determine the maturation and migration of B cell 
progenitors. mAb against CD9 and beta 1 integrins are reported to induce the 
homotypic adhesion of pre-B cells. We present evidence that the anti-CD9 mAb 
50H.19 and ALB6 but not the proaggregatory anti-VLA-4 mAb 44H6 also enhance the 
Fc-independent heterotypic adhesion of the human pre-B cell lines NALM-6 and 
HOON to bone-marrow stromal fibroblasts (BM-FB) but not to bone marrow stroma. 
CD9-enhanced binding of NALM-6 cells to BM-FB was inhibited 58% by the 
anti-VLA-4 mAb HP2/1, 36% by the anti-VLA-5 mAb BIIG2, and 99% by their 
combination. The mAb effectively inhibited adhesion when prebound to NALM-6 
cells but not when prebound to BM-FB. The anti-VCAM-1 mAb E1/6 inhibited 
CD9-enhanced adhesion by only 14% suggesting the involvement of other ligands. 
Adhesion was inhibited by mAbs against the COOH-terminus and central cell 
binding domains of fibronectin, as well as by the corresponding CS1 and RGD 
peptides. Adhesion was not affected by H-7 and sphingosine, inhibitors of 
protein kinase C. These results suggest that perturbation of CD9 on pre-B cells 
promotes recognition of stromal cell fibronectin by VLA-4 and VLA-5 and 
implicates CD9 as a novel regulator of inside-out signaling relevant to B 
lymphopoiesis.
