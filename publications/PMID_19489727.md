The proteasome is an intricate molecular machine, which serves to degrade 
proteins following their conjugation to ubiquitin. Substrates dock onto the 
proteasome at its 19-subunit regulatory particle via a diverse set of ubiquitin 
receptors and are then translocated into an internal chamber within the 
28-subunit proteolytic core particle (CP), where they are hydrolyzed. Substrate 
is threaded into the CP through a narrow gated channel, and thus translocation 
requires unfolding of the substrate. Six distinct ATPases in the regulatory 
particle appear to form a ring complex and to drive unfolding as well as 
translocation. ATP-dependent, degradation-coupled deubiquitination of the 
substrate is required both for efficient substrate degradation and for 
preventing the degradation of the ubiquitin tag. However, the proteasome also 
contains deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that can remove ubiquitin before 
substrate degradation initiates, thus allowing some substrates to dissociate 
from the proteasome and escape degradation. Here we examine the key elements of 
this molecular machine and how they cooperate in the processing of proteolytic 
substrates.
