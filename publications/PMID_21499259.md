The circadian clock controls many metabolic, developmental and physiological 
processes in a time-of-day-specific manner in both plants and animals. The 
photoreceptors involved in the perception of light and entrainment of the 
circadian clock have been well characterized in plants. However, how light 
signals are transduced from the photoreceptors to the central circadian 
oscillator, and how the rhythmic expression pattern of a clock gene is generated 
and maintained by diurnal light signals remain unclear. Here, we show that in 
Arabidopsis thaliana, FHY3, FAR1 and HY5, three positive regulators of the 
phytochrome A signalling pathway, directly bind to the promoter of ELF4, a 
proposed component of the central oscillator, and activate its expression during 
the day, whereas the circadian-controlled CCA1 and LHY proteins directly 
suppress ELF4 expression periodically at dawn through physical interactions with 
these transcription-promoting factors. Our findings provide evidence that a set 
of light- and circadian-regulated transcription factors act directly and 
coordinately at the ELF4 promoter to regulate its cyclic expression, and 
establish a potential molecular link connecting the environmental light-dark 
cycle to the central oscillator.
