SOX2 is a dose-dependent master stem cell protein that controls the self-renewal 
and pluripotency or multipotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells and many adult 
stem cells. We have previously found that SOX2 protein is monomethylated at 
lysine residues 42 and 117 by SET7 methyltransferase to promote SOX2 
proteolysis, whereas LSD1 and PHF20L1 act on both methylated Lys-42 and Lys-117 
to prevent SOX2 proteolysis. However, the mechanism by which the methylated SOX2 
protein is degraded remains unclear. Here, we report that L3MBTL3, a protein 
with the malignant-brain-tumor (MBT) methylation-binding domain, is required for 
SOX2 proteolysis. Our studies showed that L3MBTL3 preferentially binds to the 
methylated Lys-42 in SOX2, although mutation of Lys-117 also partially reduces 
the interaction between SOX2 and L3MBTL3. The direct binding of L3MBTL3 to the 
methylated SOX2 protein leads to the recruitment of the CRL4DCAF5 ubiquitin E3 
ligase to target SOX2 protein for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Whereas loss 
of either LSD1 or PHF20L1 destabilizes SOX2 protein and impairs the self-renewal 
and pluripotency of mouse ES cells, knockdown of L3MBTL3 or DCAF5 is sufficient 
to restore the protein levels of SOX2 and rescue the defects of mouse ES cells 
caused by LSD1 or PHF20L1 deficiency. We also found that retinoic acid-induced 
differentiation of mouse ES cells is accompanied by the enhanced degradation of 
the methylated SOX2 protein at both Lys-42 and Lys-117. Our studies provide 
novel insights into the mechanism by which the methylation-dependent degradation 
of SOX2 protein is controlled by the L3MBTL3-CRL4DCAF5 ubiquitin ligase complex.
