Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) binding protein (MTBP) has been implicated in 
tumor cell proliferation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The 
results of MTBP expression analysis during cell cycle progression demonstrated 
that MTBP protein was rapidly degraded during mitosis. Immunofluorescence 
studies revealed that a portion of MTBP was localized at the kinetochores during 
prometaphase. MTBP overexpression delayed mitotic progression from nuclear 
envelope breakdown (NEB) to anaphase onset and induced abnormal chromosome 
segregation such as lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges, and multipolar 
chromosome segregation. Conversely, MTBP downmodulation caused an abbreviated 
metaphase and insufficient mitotic arrest, resulting in abnormal chromosome 
segregation, aneuploidy, decreased cell proliferation, senescence, and cell 
death, similar to that of Mad2 (mitotic arrest-deficient 2) downmodulation. 
Furthermore, MTBP downmodulation inhibited the accumulation of Mad1 and Mad2, 
but not BubR1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles related 1), on the 
kinetochores, whereas MTBP overexpression inhibited the release of Mad2 from the 
metaphase kinetochores. These results may imply that MTBP has an important role 
in recruiting and/or retaining the Mad1/Mad2 complex at the kinetochores during 
prometaphase, but its degradation is required for silencing the mitotic 
checkpoint. Together, this study indicates that MTBP has a crucial role in 
proper mitotic progression and faithful chromosome segregation, providing new 
insights into regulation of the mitotic checkpoint.
