The plant hormone auxin elicits many specific context-dependent developmental 
responses. Auxin promotes degradation of Aux/IAA proteins that prevent 
transcription factors of the auxin response factor (ARF) family from regulating 
auxin-responsive target genes. Aux/IAAs and ARFs are represented by large gene 
families in Arabidopsis. Here we show that stabilization of BDL/IAA12 or its 
sister protein IAA13 prevents MP/ARF5-dependent embryonic root formation whereas 
stabilized SHY2/IAA3 interferes with seedling growth. Although both bdl and 
shy2-2 proteins inhibited MP/ARF5-dependent reporter gene activation, shy2-2 was 
much less efficient than bdl to interfere with embryonic root initiation when 
expressed from the BDL promoter. Similarly, MP was much more efficient than 
ARF16 in this process. When expressed from the SHY2 promoter, both shy2-2 and 
bdl inhibited cell elongation and auxin-induced gene expression in the seedling 
hypocotyl. By contrast, gravitropism and auxin-induced gene expression in the 
root, which were promoted by functionally redundant NPH4/ARF7 and ARF19 
proteins, were inhibited by shy2-2, but not by bdl protein. Our results suggest 
that auxin signals are converted into specific responses by matching pairs of 
coexpressed ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.
