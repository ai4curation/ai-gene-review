Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the temporal and spatial expression 
pattern of the amyloid protein precursor (APP) during the development of the 
mouse embryo. APP was first detected at day 9.5 of gestation in motor neurons of 
the hind brain and the spinal cord. APP proteins were also evident in cells of 
the floor plate, and in neurons of the cranial, dorsal root, and sympathetic 
ganglia shortly after their formation. Except for floor plate cells, APP 
expression was restricted to differentiated neurons. Comparison with the 
expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), a marker for 
neurodifferentiation, showed that APP is expressed on a subset of differentiated 
neurons. APP can also serve as an early marker for the developing nuclei of the 
hind brain. The onset of APP expression in neurons appeared to be correlated 
with axonal outgrowth, whereas later expression of APP may be associated with 
functional specialization in the developing nervous system.
