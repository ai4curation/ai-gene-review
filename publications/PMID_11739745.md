Telomere maintenance is essential for the continuous growth of tumor cells. In 
most human tumors telomeres are maintained by telomerase, a specialized reverse 
transcriptase. Tankyrase 1, a human telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 
(PARP), positively regulates telomere length through its interaction with TRF1, 
a telomeric DNA-binding protein. Tankyrase 1 ADP-ribosylates TRF1, inhibiting 
its binding to telomeric DNA. Overexpression of tankyrase 1 in the nucleus 
promotes telomere elongation, suggesting that tankyrase 1 regulates access of 
telomerase to the telomeric complex. The recent identification of a closely 
related homolog of tankyrase 1, tankyrase 2, opens the possibility for a second 
PARP at telomeres. We therefore sought to establish the role of tankyrase 1 at 
telomeres and to determine if tankyrase 2 might have a telomeric function. We 
show that endogenous tankyrase 1 is a component of the human telomeric complex. 
We demonstrate that telomere elongation by tankyrase 1 requires the catalytic 
activity of the PARP domain and does not occur in telomerase-negative primary 
human cells. To investigate a potential role for tankyrase 2 at telomeres, 
recombinant tankyrase 2 was subjected to an in vitro PARP assay. Tankyrase 2 
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated itself and TRF1. Overexpression of tankyrase 2 in the 
nucleus released endogenous TRF1 from telomeres. These findings establish 
tankyrase 2 as a bona fide PARP, with itself and TRF1 as acceptors of 
ADP-ribosylation, and suggest the possibility of a role for tankyrase 2 at 
telomeres.
