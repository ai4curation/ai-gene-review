The functional association of NPM1 with Aurora kinases is well documented. 
Surprisingly, although NPM1 is a well characterized phosphoprotein, it is 
unknown whether it is a substrate of Aurora kinases. We have found that Aurora 
kinases A and B can phosphorylate NPM1 at a single serine residue, Ser125, in 
vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylated-S125-NPM1 (pS125-NPM1) localizes to the 
midbody region during late cytokinesis where it colocalizes with Aurora B. The 
overexpression of mutant (S125A) NPM1 resulted in the deregulation of centrosome 
duplication and mitotic defects possibly due to cytokinesis failure. These data 
suggest that Aurora kinase B-mediated phosphorylation of NPM1 plays a critical 
role during mitosis, which could have wider implications in oncogenesis.
