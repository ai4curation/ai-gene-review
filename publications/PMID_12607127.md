OBJECTIVE: GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH I) catalyzes the de novo biosynthesis of 
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an essential cofactor of NO-synthase. The enzyme 
underlies negative feedback regulation by the end product BH(4). This feedback 
inhibition is mediated through complex formation with the GTP cyclohydrolase I 
feedback regulatory protein (GFRP). To further classify the mechanism involved 
in the regulation of BH(4) synthesis, we measured expression of GTPCH I and GFRP 
in different human tissues. Furthermore, we looked for the influence of 
phenylalanine that is known to reverse BH(4)-mediated feedback inhibition of 
GTPCH I, and of immunostimulation with interferon gamma on the expression of 
GTPCH I and GFRP.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using RT-PCR and northern blot technique, coexpression of 
GFRP and GTPCH I could be demonstrated in a number of different tissues such as 
endothelial cells and peripheral blood cells. Following stimulation of human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with phenylalanine (1 mM), there was no 
change of GFRP mRNA. In contrast, the mRNA level of GTPCH I was significantly 
upregulated with a maximum after 6 hours (p = 0.04). Incubation of HUVEC with 
interferon-gamma (100 U/ml) showed an increase of GTPCH I mRNA and a significant 
downregulation of GFRP mRNA after 24 hours (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: This study shows for the first time the expression of GFRP in 
different human tissues. The biosynthesis of BH(4) is not only regulated on the 
substrate level but also through transcription of the interacting proteins. 
Phenylalanine stimulates the biosynthesis of BH(4) not only by reversing the 
negative feedback inhibition of GTPCH I but also by increasing the mRNA level of 
GTPCH I. Immunostimulation alters protein expression of GTPCH I and GFRP in a 
way that favors BH(4) synthesis.
