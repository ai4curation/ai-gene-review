Tumor cells commonly have increased glucose uptake and lactate accumulation. 
Lactate is produced from pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), which is 
frequently overexpressed in tumor cells and is important for cell growth. 
Elevated transcription by c-Myc or HIF1α may contribute to increased LDH-A in 
some cancer types. Here, we show that LDH-A is acetylated at lysine 5 (K5) and 
that this acetylation inhibits LDH-A activity. Furthermore, the K5-acetylated 
LDH-A is recognized by the HSC70 chaperone and delivered to lysosomes for 
degradation. Replacement of endogenous LDH-A with an acetylation mimetic mutant 
decreases cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, K5 acetylation of LDH-A 
is reduced in human pancreatic cancers. Our study reveals a mechanism of LDH-A 
upregulation in pancreatic cancers.
