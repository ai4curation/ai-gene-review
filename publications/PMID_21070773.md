PER3 is a member of the PERIOD genes, but does not play essential roles in the 
circadian clock. Depletion of Per3 by siRNA almost completely abolished 
activation of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) after inducing DNA damage in human 
cells. In addition, Per3 physically interacted with ATM and Chk2. Per3 
overexpression induced Chk2 activation in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, 
and this activation depended on ATM. Per3 overexpression also led to the 
inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death. These combined 
results suggest that Per3 is a checkpoint protein that plays important roles in 
checkpoint activation, cell proliferation and apoptosis.
