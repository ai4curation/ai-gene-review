We characterized changes of nucleosome assembly activity, intracellular 
localization, and reversible phosphorylation of the human chromatin assembly 
factor CAF-1 during the somatic cell division cycle. HeLa cells were 
synchronized in the G1, S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle. All three 
subunits of human CAF-1 (p150, p60, and p48) are present during the entire cell 
cycle. In interphase, p150 and p60 are bound to the nucleus, but they 
predominantly dissociate from chromatin during mitosis. During S phase, p150 and 
p60 are concentrated at sites of intranuclear DNA replication. Only a fraction 
of total p48 is associated with p150 and p60, and the majority is present in 
other high molecular weight complexes. The other nucleosome assembly protein, 
NAP-1, is predominantly cytosolic throughout the cell cycle. Human CAF-1 
efficiently mediates nucleosome assembly during complementary DNA strand 
synthesis in G1, S, and G2 phase cytosolic extracts. Active CAF-1 can be 
isolated as a 6.5 S complex from G1, S, and G2 phase nuclei. In contrast, CAF-1 
isolated from mitotic cytosol does not support nucleosome assembly during DNA 
synthesis. In mitosis, the p60 subunit of inactive CAF-1 is hyperphosphorylated, 
whereas active CAF-1 in interphase contains hypophosphorylated and/or 
phosphorylated forms of p60.
