Nitric oxide synthases belong to a family of dual-flavin enzymes that transfer 
electrons from NAD(P)H to a variety of heme protein acceptors. During catalysis, 
their FMN subdomain plays a central role by acting as both an electron acceptor 
(receiving electrons from FAD) and an electron donor, and is thought to undergo 
large conformational movements and engage in two distinct protein-protein 
interactions in the process. This minireview summarizes what we know about the 
many factors regulating nitric oxide synthase flavoprotein domain function, 
primarily from the viewpoint of how they impact electron input/output and 
conformational behaviors of the FMN subdomain.

Abstract

Nitric oxide synthases belong to a family of dual-flavin enzymes that transfer electrons from NAD(P)H to a variety of heme protein acceptors. During catalysis, their FMN subdomain plays a central role by acting as both an electron acceptor (receiving electrons from FAD) and an electron donor, and is thought to undergo large conformational movements and engage in two distinct protein–protein interactions in the process. This minireview summarizes what we know about the many factors regulating niric oxide synthase flavoprotein domain function, primarily from the viewpoint of how they impact electron input/output and conformational behaviors of the FMN subdomain.

Introduction

Flavoproteins are a versatile group of biological catalysts that may represent 1–3% of all genes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes [ 1 , 2 ]. Nitric oxide synthases (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39) are members of a dual-flavin reductase family, which transfer electrons from NADPH to a variety of heme protein acceptors [ 3 – 5 ]. The electron transfer occurs in a linear manner from NADPH to FAD to FMN. During catalysis, the FMN subdomain plays a central role by acting as both an electron acceptor (receiving an electron from FADH 2 ) and an electron donor (transferring an electron typically from FMNH − ), and is thought to undergo large conformational movements in the process. How this process occurs and is regulated in dual-flavin enzymes like NOS is a topic of current interest.

Conclusions

Although the NOS flavoprotein domain has fundamental structural, thermodynamic and mechanistic features in common with the dual-flavin family of reductases, there are unique aspects related to NO synthesis that constrain and shape its function. Both common and unique features govern electron flux through the NOS flavoprotein domain. Many of these appear to act by influencing a conformational equilibrium ( K eq A) that defines the interaction between the FMN subdomain and the FNR subdomain, although some may also influence the rate of electron import into the FMN subdomain and the resulting formation of FMNH 2 . The extent to which K eq A or the rate of FMNH 2 formation influences electron flux through the NOS flavoprotein can vary depending on the circumstances. However, the K eq A, and specifically the dissociation rate of the reduced FMN subdomain, appears to be the primary factor that determines electron flux through the CaM-free nNOS and eNOS flavoproteins. A second conformational equilibrium ( K eq B) defines the interaction of the reduced FMN subdomain with the NOSoxy domain that is required for heme reduction and NO synthesis. This equilibrium appears to have a different set point and regulation compared to K eq A, but has not been as thoroughly studied. An intrinsic heme–NO binding event occurs in NOS enzymes during catalysis and is likely to restrict the electron transfer function (heme reduction) of the NOS FMN subdomain relative to its function in related dual-flavin enzyme systems.
