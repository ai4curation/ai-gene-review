STUDY QUESTION: Which human sperm proteins interact with zona pellucida (ZP) 
glycoproteins, ZPA/2, ZPB/4 and ZPC/3?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Co-precipitation experiments with recombinant human ZP (rhZP) 
coated beads demonstrated interactions with various proteins, including 
glutathione S-transferase M3 (GSTM) with ZPB/4 and voltage-dependent anion 
channel 2 (VDAC2) with ZPA/2 and ZPC/3.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Regarding sperm-ZP binding, several target spot/proteins 
have been detected in several species, but not all have been characterized. The 
limit of these studies was that a mixture of the different ZP glycoproteins was 
used and did not allow the identification of the specific ZP glycoprotein 
(ZPA/2, ZPC/3 or ZPB/4) involved in the interaction with the sperm proteins.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To identify the human sperm proteins interacting 
with the oocyte ZP, we combined two approaches: immunoblot of human spermatozoa 
targeted by antisperm antibodies (ASAs) from infertile men and far western blot 
of human sperm proteins overlayd by each of the rhZP proteins.
MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We used rhZP expressed in Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells and ASA eluted from infertile patients undergoing IVF failure. Sperm 
proteins separated by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis recognized by both 
sperm-eluted ASAs from infertile patients and rhZP were identified by mass 
spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS). Some of these proteins were further validated by 
co-precipitation experiments with rhZP and functional zona binding tests.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We identified proteins that are glycolytic 
enzymes such as pyruvate kinase 3, enolase 1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase, aldolase A, triosephosphate isomerase, detoxification enzymes 
such as GSTM or phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, ion channels 
such as VDAC2 and structural proteins such as outer dense fibre 2. Several of 
the proteins were localized on the sperm head. However, these proteins have also 
been described to exert other functions in the flagellum. Co-precipitation 
experiments with rhZP-coated beads confirmed the direct interaction of GSTM with 
ZP4 and of VDAC2 with ZP2 and ZP3.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We used recombinant ZP in place of native ZP. 
Thus, the post-translational modifications of the proteins, such as 
glycosylations, can be different and can influence their function. However, CHO 
cell-expressed rhZP are functional, e.g. can bind human spermatozoa and induce 
the acrosome reaction. Moreover, the identification of relevant proteins was 
limited by the need for sufficient amounts of proteins on the preparative 2D-gel 
to be subsequently analysed in MALDI-TOF MS/MS.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results bring new insights on the 
ability of sperm proteins to exert several functions depending on their 
sub-cellular localization, either the head or flagellum. Their multiple roles 
suggest that these sperm proteins are multifaceted or moonlighting proteins.
