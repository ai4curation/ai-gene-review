PURPOSE: A prior report showed ornithine cytotoxicity in 
ornithine-delta-aminotransferase (OAT)-deficient human retinal pigment 
epithelial (RPE) cells in an in vitro model of gyrate atrophy of the choroid and 
retina. This study was intended to clarify the mechanism of ornithine 
cytotoxicity and to determine the responsible amino acid transporters.
METHODS: The mRNA expression of amino acid transporters in human telomerase 
reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-RPE cells was examined by reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot analysis. Carrier-mediated 
ornithine transport via the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT)1, LAT2, cationic 
amino acid transporter (CAT)-1, and y(+)LAT2 systems was evaluated by short 
interfering (si)RNA-mediated gene silencing. The cytoprotective effect of 
CAT-1-specific siRNA on ornithine cytotoxicity was measured using quantitative 
analysis of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at 24 hours after treatment 
with ornithine in OAT-deficient RPE cells.
RESULTS: LAT1, LAT2, CAT-1, and y(+)LAT2 mRNA expression was detected by 
Northern blot analysis, whereas RT-PCR revealed that LAT1, LAT2, y(+)LAT1, 
y(+)LAT2, CAT-1, and b(0,+)AT mRNAs were expressed together with the 
heterodimeric glycoproteins 4F2hc and rBAT in hTERT-RPE cells. 
l-[(14)C]ornithine uptake in hTERT-RPE cells was decreased by 46.6% and 22.0% by 
CAT-1 and y(+)LAT2 siRNA, respectively, whereas LAT1 and LAT2 siRNA had no 
significant effect. Further, CAT-1 silencing by siRNA reduced ornithine 
cytotoxicity in OAT-deficient RPE cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ornithine transport via CAT-1 may play a 
crucial role in ornithine cytotoxicity in hTERT-RPE cells. Reduction of the 
ornithine transport via CAT-1 may be a new target for treatment of gyrate 
atrophy.
