Arabidopsis DREB2A is a key transcription factor of heat- and drought-responsive 
gene expression, and DREB2A expression is induced by these stresses. We analyzed 
the DREB2A promoter and found a heat shock element that functions as a 
cis-acting element in the heat shock (HS)-responsive expression of DREB2A. Among 
the 21 Arabidopsis heat shock factors, we chose 4 HsfA1-type proteins as 
candidate transcriptional activators (HsfA1a, HsfA1b, HsfA1d, and HsfA1e) based 
on transactivation activity and expression patterns. We generated multiple 
mutants and found that the HS-responsive expression of DREB2A disappeared in 
hsfa1a/b/d triple and hsfa1a/b/d/e quadruple mutants. Moreover, HS-responsive 
gene expression, including that of molecular chaperones and transcription 
factors, was globally and drastically impaired in the hsfa1a/b/d triple mutant, 
which exhibited greatly reduced tolerance to HS stress. HsfA1 protein 
accumulation in the nucleus was negatively regulated by their interactions with 
HSP90, and other factors potentially strongly activate the HsfA1 proteins under 
HS stress. The hsfa1a/b/d/e quadruple mutant showed severe growth retardation, 
and many genes were downregulated in this mutant even under non-stress 
conditions. Our study indicates that HsfA1a, HsfA1b, and HsfA1d function as main 
positive regulators in HS-responsive gene expression and four HsfA1-type 
proteins are important in gene expression for normal plant growth.
