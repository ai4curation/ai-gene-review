The human HtrA4 protein, belonging to the HtrA family of proteases/chaperones, 
participates in oncogenesis and placentation, and plays a role in preeclampsia. 
As the knowledge concerning the biochemical features of this protein and its 
role at the molecular level is limited, in this work we characterized the HtrA4 
molecule and searched for its cellular function. We found that recombinant HtrA4 
composed of the protease and PDZ domains is a trimeric protein of intermediate 
thermal stability whose activity is considerably lower compared to other human 
HtrA proteases. By pull-down combined with mass spectrometry we identified a 
large array of potential HtrA4 partners. Using other experimental approaches, 
including immunoprecipitation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 
fluorescence microscopy we confirmed that HtrA4 formed complexes in vitro and in 
cellulo with proteins such as XIAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein), caspases 7 
and 9, β-tubulin, actin, TCP1α and S100A6. The recombinant HtrA4 degraded XIAP, 
the caspases, β-tubulin and actin but not TCP1α or S100A6. Together, these 
results suggest that HtrA4 may influence various cellular functions, including 
apoptosis. Furthermore, the panel of potential HtrA4 partners may serve as a 
basis for future studies of HtrA4 function.
