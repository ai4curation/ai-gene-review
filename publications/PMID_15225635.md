The 14-3-3 proteins are known to interact with a number of proteins involved in 
the regulation of cell signaling. Here, we describe an association of 14-3-3zeta 
with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is rapidly induced by EGF. 
The 1028-EGFR truncated mutant which lacks the cytoplasmic tail from amino acids 
1029-1186 identified the binding site for 14-3-3 to be between amino acid 1028 
and the receptor carboxyl terminus. Mutational deletion of serine residues 1046, 
1047, 1057 and 1142 did not inhibit EGF-induced 14-3-3 association with the 
receptor. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated an EGF-induced co-localization 
of EGFR and HA-14-3-3zeta along the plasma membrane. Our finding adds to the 
growing complexity of EGF receptor signaling and indicates a role for 14-3-3 
proteins in EGF receptor signaling or regulation.
