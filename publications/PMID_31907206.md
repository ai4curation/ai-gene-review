Morgana (Mora, also known as CHORD in flies) and its mammalian homologue, called 
CHORDC1 or CHP1, is a highly conserved cysteine and histidine-rich domain 
(CHORD)-containing protein that has been proposed to function as an Hsp90 
co-chaperone. Morgana deregulation promotes carcinogenesis in both mice and 
humans while, in Drosophila, loss of mora causes lethality and a complex mitotic 
phenotype that is rescued by a human morgana transgene. Here, we show that 
Drosophila Mora localises to mitotic spindles and co-purifies with the 
Hsp90-R2TP-TTT supercomplex and with additional well-known Hsp90 co-chaperones. 
Acute inhibition of Mora function in the early embryo results in a dramatic 
reduction in centrosomal microtubule stability, leading to small spindles 
nucleated from mitotic chromatin. Purified Mora binds to microtubules directly 
and promotes microtubule polymerisation in vitro, suggesting that Mora directly 
regulates spindle dynamics independently of its Hsp90 co-chaperone role.
