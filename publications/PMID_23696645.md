Peroxynitrite is a highly reactive chemical species with antibacterial 
properties that are synthesized in immune cells. In a proteomic approach, we 
identified specific target proteins of peroxynitrite-induced modifications in 
Escherichia coli. Although peroxynitrite caused a fairly indiscriminate 
nitration of tyrosine residues, reversible modifications of protein thiols were 
highly specific. We used a quantitative redox proteomic method based on 
isotope-coded affinity tag chemistry and identified four proteins consistently 
thiol-modified in cells treated with peroxynitrite as follows: AsnB, FrmA, MaeB, 
and RidA. All four were required for peroxynitrite stress tolerance in vivo. 
Three of the identified proteins were modified at highly conserved cysteines, 
and MaeB and FrmA are known to be directly involved in the oxidative and 
nitrosative stress response in E. coli. In in vitro studies, we could show that 
the activity of RidA, a recently discovered enamine/imine deaminase, is 
regulated in a specific manner by the modification of its single conserved 
cysteine. Mutation of this cysteine 107 to serine generated a constitutively 
active protein that was not susceptible to peroxynitrite.
