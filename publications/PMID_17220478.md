NDRG1 is known to play important roles in both androgen-induced cell 
differentiation and inhibition of prostate cancer metastasis. However, the 
proteins associated with NDRG1 function are not fully enumerated. Using 
coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 58 proteins 
that interact with NDRG1 in prostate cancer cells. These proteins include 
nuclear proteins, adhesion molecules, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperons, 
proteasome subunits, and signaling proteins. Integration of our data with 
protein-protein interaction data from the Human Proteome Reference Database 
allowed us to build a comprehensive interactome map of NDRG1. This interactome 
map consists of several modules such as a nuclear module and a cell membrane 
module; these modules explain the reported versatile functions of NDRG1. We also 
determined that serine 330 and threonine 366 of NDRG1 were phosphorylated and 
demonstrated that the phosphorylation of NDRG1 was prominently mediated by 
protein kinase A (PKA). Further, we showed that NDRG1 directly binds to 
beta-catenin and E-cadherin. However, the phosphorylation of NDRG1 did not 
interrupt the binding of NDRG1 to E-cadherin and beta-catenin. Finally, we 
showed that the inhibition of NDRG1 expression by RNA interference decreased the 
ER inducible chaperon GRP94 expression, directly proving that NDRG1 is involved 
in the ER stress response. Intriguingly, we observed that many members of the 
NDRG1 interactome are androgen-regulated and that the NDRG1 interactome links to 
the androgen response network through common interactions with beta-catenin and 
heat shock protein 90. Therefore we overlaid the transcriptomic expression 
changes in the NDRG1 interactome in response to androgen treatment and built a 
dual dynamic picture of the NDRG1 interactome in response to androgen. This 
interactome map provides the first road map for understanding the functions of 
NDRG1 in cells and its roles in human diseases, such as prostate cancer, which 
can progress from androgen-dependent curable stages to androgen-independent 
incurable stages.
