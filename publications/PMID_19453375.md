Ca(2+) influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptor at excitatory synapses causes 
activation of post-synaptic Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II 
(CaMKII) and its translocation to the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor. The major 
binding site for CaMKII on NR2B undergoes phosphorylation at Ser1303, in vivo. 
Even though some regulatory effects of this phosphorylation are known, the mode 
of dephosphorylation of NR2B-Ser1303 is still unclear. We show that 
phosphorylation status at Ser1303 enables NR2B to distinguish between the 
Ca(2+)/calmodulin activated form and the autonomously active 
Thr286-autophosphorylated form of CaMKII. Green fluorescent protein-alpha-CaMKII 
co-expressed with NR2B sequence in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was used to 
study intracellular binding between the two proteins. Binding in vitro was 
studied by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay. Thr286-autophosphorylated 
alpha-CaMKII or the autophosphorylation mimicking mutant, T286D-alpha-CaMKII, 
binds NR2B sequence independent of Ca(2+)/calmodulin unlike native wild-type 
alpha-CaMKII. We show enhancement of this binding by Ca(2+)/calmodulin. 
Phosphorylation or a phosphorylation mimicking mutation on NR2B (NR2B-S1303D) 
abolishes the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-independent binding whereas it allows the 
Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent binding of alpha-CaMKII in vitro. Similarly, the 
autonomously active mutants, T286D-alpha-CaMKII and F293E/N294D-alpha-CaMKII, 
exhibited Ca(2+)-independent binding to non-phosphorylatable mutant of NR2B 
under intracellular conditions. We also show for the first time that 
phosphatases in the brain such as protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 
2A dephosphorylate phospho-Ser1303 on NR2B.
