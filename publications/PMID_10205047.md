Mutation of the VHL tumor suppressor is associated with the inherited von 
Hippel-Lindau (VHL) cancer syndrome and the majority of kidney cancers. VHL 
binds the ElonginC-ElonginB complex and regulates levels of hypoxia-inducible 
proteins. The structure of the ternary complex at 2.7 angstrom resolution shows 
two interfaces, one between VHL and ElonginC and another between ElonginC and 
ElonginB. Tumorigenic mutations frequently occur in a 35-residue domain of VHL 
responsible for ElonginC binding. A mutational patch on a separate domain of VHL 
indicates a second macromolecular binding site. The structure extends the 
similarities to the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) complex that targets proteins 
for degradation, supporting the hypothesis that VHL may function in an analogous 
pathway.
