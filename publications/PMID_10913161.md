Heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) is a molecular chaperone responsible for protein 
folding and maturation in vivo. Interaction of hsp90 with human 
glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) was found by genetic screening, 
co-immunoprecipitation, and in vitro binding experiments. This interaction was 
sensitive to the hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, and also ATP, suggesting that 
the chaperone activity of hsp90 is required for interaction with EPRS. 
Interaction of EPRS with hsp90 was targeted to the region of three tandem 
repeats linking the two catalytic domains of EPRS that is also responsible for 
the interaction with isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IRS). Interaction of EPRS and 
IRS also depended on the activity of hsp90, implying that their association was 
mediated by hsp90. EPRS and IRS form a macromolecular protein complex with at 
least six other tRNA synthetases and three cofactors. hsp90 preferentially binds 
to most of the complex-forming enzymes rather than those that are not found in 
the complex. In addition, inactivation of hsp90 interfered with the in vivo 
incorporation of the nascent aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases into the multi-ARS 
complex. Thus, hsp90 appears to mediate protein-protein interactions of 
mammalian tRNA synthetases.
