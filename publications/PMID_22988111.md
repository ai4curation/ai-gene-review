UV-B light initiates photomorphogenic responses in plants. Arabidopsis UV 
RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) specifically mediates these responses by functioning as 
a UV-B photoreceptor. UV-B exposure converts UVR8 from a dimer to a monomer, 
stimulates the rapid accumulation of UVR8 in the nucleus, where it binds to 
chromatin, and induces interaction of UVR8 with CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 
(COP1), which functions with UVR8 to control photomorphogenic UV-B responses. 
Although the crystal structure of UVR8 reveals the basis of photoreception, it 
does not show how UVR8 initiates signaling through interaction with COP1. Here 
we report that a region of 27 amino acids from the C terminus of UVR8 (C27) 
mediates the interaction with COP1. The C27 region is necessary for UVR8 
function in the regulation of gene expression and hypocotyl growth suppression 
in Arabidopsis. However, UVR8 lacking C27 still undergoes UV-B-induced 
monomerization in both yeast and plant protein extracts, accumulates in the 
nucleus in response to UV-B, and interacts with chromatin at the UVR8-regulated 
ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) gene. The UV-B-dependent interaction of UVR8 and COP1 
is reproduced in yeast cells and we show that C27 is both necessary and 
sufficient for the interaction of UVR8 with the WD40 domain of COP1. 
Furthermore, we show that C27 interacts in yeast with the REPRESSOR OF UV-B 
PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS proteins, RUP1 and RUP2, which are negative regulators of 
UVR8 function. Hence the C27 region has a key role in UVR8 function.

Abstract

UV-B light initiates photomorphogenic responses in plants. Arabidopsis UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) specifically mediates these responses by functioning as a UV-B photoreceptor. UV-B exposure converts UVR8 from a dimer to a monomer, stimulates the rapid accumulation of UVR8 in the nucleus, where it binds to chromatin, and induces interaction of UVR8 with CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), which functions with UVR8 to control photomorphogenic UV-B responses. Although the crystal structure of UVR8 reveals the basis of photoreception, it does not show how UVR8 initiates signaling through interaction with COP1. Here we report that a region of 27 amino acids from the C terminus of UVR8 (C27) mediates the interaction with COP1. The C27 region is necessary for UVR8 function in the regulation of gene expression and hypocotyl growth suppression in Arabidopsis . However, UVR8 lacking C27 still undergoes UV-B–induced monomerization in both yeast and plant protein extracts, accumulates in the nucleus in response to UV-B, and interacts with chromatin at the UVR8-regulated ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 ( HY5 ) gene. The UV-B–dependent interaction of UVR8 and COP1 is reproduced in yeast cells and we show that C27 is both necessary and sufficient for the interaction of UVR8 with the WD40 domain of COP1. Furthermore, we show that C27 interacts in yeast with the REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS proteins, RUP1 and RUP2, which are negative regulators of UVR8 function. Hence the C27 region has a key role in UVR8 function.

Discussion

Although recent research has established the physiological importance of UVR8 and the structural basis of its action as a photoreceptor, the mechanism of UVR8 signaling, which is initiated by interaction with COP1, is poorly understood. The data presented here show that the C27 region of UVR8 is key to understanding UVR8 signaling. The C27 region is not present in structurally related proteins such as RCC1 and is not present in other Arabidopsis proteins, including those with moderate sequence similarity to UVR8. However, the C27 region contains stretches of amino acids that are highly conserved in UVR8 sequences from various plant species, including lower plants, consistent with its importance in UVR8 function. Both the uvr8-2 allele, which lacks the C-terminal 40 amino acids of the protein, and transgenic uvr8-1 plants expressing the GFP–ΔC27UVR8 fusion show no detectable UV-B induction of HY5 or CHS transcripts. It is known that HY5, sometimes acting redundantly with the closely related HYH (HY5 HOMOLOG) transcription factor ( 7 , 18 ), has a key role in mediating UVR8-regulated gene expression ( 5 , 6 ), and hence the loss of HY5 expression in plants lacking C27 will impair responses. Thus, uvr8-1 plants expressing GFP–ΔC27UVR8 are both highly sensitive to UV-B, likely because of a general absence of UVR8-regulated gene expression, and impaired in the suppression of hypocotyl growth by UV-B, similar to uvr8-1 ( 5 , 6 , 8 ) and hy5 ( 6 ) or hy5 hyh ( 7 ) mutants.

The loss of function of GFP–ΔC27UVR8 is not because deletion of the C-terminal region of UVR8 leads to instability and degradation of the protein, as the mutant protein is expressed in both uvr8-2 and transgenic GFP–ΔC27UVR8 plants. The nonfunctional GFP–ΔC27UVR8 protein still forms a dimer, as in the wild-type, indicating that the C27 region is not required for interaction between UVR8 molecules. Moreover, the GFP–ΔC27UVR8 protein is converted to a monomer following UV-B exposure in both yeast and plants, and so the primary effect of UV-B on the protein is not prevented by the C27 deletion. Similar findings are obtained with purified trypsin-treated UVR8 lacking 40 amino acids at the C terminus ( 10 ). Furthermore, the GFP–ΔC27UVR8 protein accumulates in the nucleus of plants in response to UV-B and interacts with chromatin at the HY5 gene similar to wild-type UVR8. Thus, the C27 region is not required for nuclear accumulation of UVR8 and its interaction with histones.

The data presented here show that the C27 region is required for the interaction of UVR8 with COP1, which is pivotal to photomorphogenic UV-B responses. The ΔC27UVR8 protein fails to interact with COP1 in either yeast or plants. Although COP1 is required for the induction of gene expression by UVR8, it is not required for either monomerization ( 12 ) or the interaction of UVR8 with chromatin ( 5 ), consistent with the findings reported here for plants expressing GFP–ΔC27UVR8. The observation that the GFP–ΔC27UVR8 protein accumulates in the nucleus in response to UV-B indicates that this process also does not require COP1. The experiments in yeast show that the C27 region is both necessary and sufficient for interaction with the WD40 region of COP1. Holm et al. ( 18 ) identified a motif in HY5 and several other proteins that is responsible for interaction with the WD40 region of COP1. This motif (VPE/D-hydrophobic residue-G with several upstream negatively charged residues) is partly conserved in the C27 region of UVR8 (VPDETG with one upstream glutamate residue) and could be involved in the interaction with COP1.

There is no reason to suppose that yeast itself contains a photoreceptor that would mediate the UV-B–dependent interaction between UVR8 and COP1. Yeast is very unlikely to have a protein that could substitute as a plant UV-B photoreceptor and the activation of DNA damage signaling is not responsible for initiating the interaction between UVR8 and COP1. This interaction is induced specifically by UV-B wavelengths and requires intact UVR8 acting as the photoreceptor. Intact UVR8 is able to mediate a UV-B–dependent interaction with the WD40 region of COP1 alone, whereas intact COP1 is unable to mediate a UV-B-dependent interaction with the C27 region alone, and thus C27 binds to COP1 (and specifically to the WD40 domain) in both darkness and following UV-B exposure. It is interesting that the C27 region alone binds constitutively to COP1, whereas intact UVR8 binds to COP1 only following UV-B exposure. It is possible that the C27 region is shielded from COP1 in intact UVR8, which is in the dimeric form in darkness, and that UV-B–induced monomerization, together with associated conformational changes, exposes the C27 region to COP1. The crystal structure of UVR8 ( 10 , 11 ) does not include the C-terminal 40 amino acids and hence it is important to determine where the C27 region resides in the protein and whether its position changes after UV-B exposure.

COP1 interacts with various other components involved in regulating photomorphogenesis, including the cry1 photoreceptor ( 19 , 20 ), SPA proteins ( 21 ), CULLIN4, and DAMAGED DNA BINDING PROTEIN1 (DDB1) ( 22 , 23 ). Hence UVR8 could possibly interact with other photomorphogenic proteins via its association with COP1 or influence the interaction of COP1 with other components. For instance, the interaction of COP1 with UVR8 might reduce its availability to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in association with other proteins ( 23 ). Moreover, interaction with UVR8 following UV-B exposure could possibly inhibit the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of COP1 and contribute to the light inactivation of COP1, which is not fully understood ( 15 ). Thus, further research is required to establish both how the interaction of UVR8 with COP1 leads to transcriptional regulation in photomorphogenic UV-B responses and how it impacts on the function of COP1 in other photomorphogenic responses.

RUP1 and RUP2 are WD40 repeat proteins, like COP1 ( 17 ), and the data presented here indicate that they interact with the C27 region of UVR8, which also binds COP1. Hence, in addition to its key role in binding COP1 to initiate signaling, the C27 region is important in the regulation of UVR8 activity through its ability to interact with other WD40 proteins. Although the interaction of RUP1 and RUP2 with C27 is stimulated by UV-B in yeast, both proteins bind to UVR8 in the absence of UV-B, in contrast to COP1, whose interaction is dependent on UV-B. As discussed above, COP1 is unable to access C27 in the UVR8 dimer. The much smaller size of the RUP proteins does not explain their stronger interaction with the C27 region in darkness, because the WD40 region of COP1 alone, which is similar in size to the RUP proteins, shows a UV-B–dependent interaction with C27 ( Fig. 3 B ). Hence, there are likely differences in the primary sequence or structure of the RUPs compared with the WD40 region of COP1 that enable them to interact with the C27 region in dimeric UVR8. It is not clear how the RUP proteins repress UV-B photomorphogenic responses in vivo. The data presented here suggest that COP1 and the RUP proteins have similar strength of interaction with C27 in yeast in the presence of UV-B, so the RUPs may not impair interaction of COP1 with UVR8 in plants by having greater binding affinities for C27. Because the RUPs are UV-B induced, an increase in their abundance relative to COP1 may limit binding of COP1 to C27. However, more detailed study of the amounts, availability, and binding affinities of the proteins in planta is needed to understand the mechanism of negative regulation.
