RIG-I is a critical RNA virus sensor that serves to initiate antiviral innate 
immunity. However, posttranslational regulation of RIG-I signaling remains to be 
fully understood. We report here that RNA viruses, but not DNA viruses or 
bacteria, specifically upregulate lectin family member Siglecg expression in 
macrophages by RIG-I- or NF-κB-dependent mechanisms. Siglec-G-induced 
recruitment of SHP2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to RIG-I leads to RIG-I 
degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination at Lys813 by c-Cbl. By increasing type 
I interferon production, targeted inactivation of Siglecg protects mice against 
lethal RNA virus infection. Taken together, our data reveal a negative feedback 
loop of RIG-I signaling and identify a Siglec-G-mediated immune evasion pathway 
exploited by RNA viruses with implication in antiviral applications. These 
findings also provide insights into the functions and crosstalk of Siglec-G, a 
known adaptive response regulator, in innate immunity.
