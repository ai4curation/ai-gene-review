Defects in closure of embryonic tissues such as the neural tube, body wall, face 
and eye lead to severe birth defects. Cell adhesion is hypothesized to 
contribute to closure of the neural tube and body wall; however, potential 
molecular regulators of this process have not been identified. Here we identify 
an ENU-induced mutation in mice that reveals a molecular pathway of embryonic 
closure. Line2F homozygous mutant embryos fail to close the neural tube, body 
wall, face, and optic fissure, and they also display defects in lung and heart 
development. Using a new technology of genomic sequence capture and 
high-throughput sequencing of a 2.5Mb region of the mouse genome, we discovered 
a mutation in the grainyhead-like 2 gene (Grhl2). Microarray analysis revealed 
Grhl2 affects the expression of a battery of genes involved in cell adhesion and 
E-cadherin protein is drastically reduced in tissues that require Grhl2 
function. The tissue closure defects in Grhl2 mutants are similar to that of 
AP-2α null mutants and AP-2α has been shown to bind to the promoter of 
E-cadherin. Therefore, we tested for a possible interaction between these genes. 
However, we find that Grhl2 and AP-2α do not regulate each other's expression, 
E-cadherin expression is normal in AP-2α mutants during neural tube closure, and 
Grhl2;AP-2α trans-heterozygous embryos are morphologically normal. Taken 
together, our studies point to a complex regulation of neural tube fusion and 
highlight the importance of comparisons between these two models to understand 
more fully the molecular pathways of embryonic tissue closure.

Introduction

Neurulation, the process that gives rise to the central nervous system, in mammals is a complex and highly dynamic morphogenetic process during which the flat neural plate rolls up and closes to form the neural tube. Neurulation occurs in at least four distinct steps, namely thickening of the ectoderm to form a flat neural plate, elevation of the lateral edges of the neural plate to form the neural folds, apposition of the neural folds, and finally, joining of the neural folds in the midline. This last step includes separation of the neural ectoderm from the non-neural ectoderm and closing of these tissues to form the neural tube covered by a single layer of ectoderm. This final closure event has traditionally been called fusion, although the cells do not actually fuse. Neural tube defects (NTD) or failure of neural tube closure occurs in ~1:1000 live human births. Studies in mice have lent considerable insight into the genetics of neural tube closure and have identified genes involved in processes including neural patterning, cell proliferation, and tissue architecture, however, relatively little is known about the molecular basis of fusion of the neural folds ( Harris and Juriloff, 2010 ). Other embryonic tissues also undergo closure events and it has been proposed that similar mechanisms of fusion are utilized. Body wall closure occurs when the lateral edges of the embryonic ectoderm and mesoderm are joined and fuse at the ventral midline. Defective body wall closure can lead to an open abdominal and/or thoracic cavity. Closure of the optic fissure occurs through joining of the folds of the optic cup, disruption of which results in coloboma. Finally, the facial prominences also undergo fusion and defects in facial closure can result in birth defects ranging from cleft lip and palate to clefting of the entire face. Although birth defects due to failure of closure of embryonic tissues are of considerable medical consequence, the cellular and molecular events that regulate fusion remain unknown.

It has been long hypothesized that fusion relies on adhesion molecules for its completion. Although this is a compelling idea, the molecules that regulate the process of neural tube, body wall or optic fissure closure are not well defined. With respect to neural tube closure, mutations in adhesion molecules, such as EphrinA5 and EphrinA7, can cause NTD in mice ( Holmberg et al., 2000 ) although neither has been shown to be directly involved in the step of neural fold fusion. Cadherins are also thought to be predominant cell adhesion molecules involved in initial recognition and formation of cell-cell interactions between the juxtaposed neural folds during mammalian neural tube formation. Two observations that support this hypothesis are different subtypes of cadherins control various aspects of embryonic development ( Takeichi, 1988 ), and subtypes of cadherins are essential for neurulation in a number of animal models, including Xenopus ( Rashid et al., 2006 ) and mice ( Chen and Hales, 1995 ). However, the details of their function and what step of neurulation these molecules control are not fully understood. No specific adhesion molecules are yet implicated in closure of the body wall. The AP-2α null mouse is one example of a gene mutation that causes defects in body wall and neural tube closure ( Brewer and Williams, 2004 ; Nottoli et al., 1998 ). In cancer cell lines, AP-2α has been shown to bind the promoter of E-cadherin and the functional consequences of this have been studied in adult tissues and cancer cells ( Baldi et al., 2001 ; Schwartz et al., 2007 ). The relationship between AP-2α and E-cadherin in the embryo has only been explored in the cornea of the developing eye ( West-Mays et al., 2003 ).

Here we describe the identification of an ENU-induced nonsense mutation in the grainyhead-like 2 (Grhl2 ) gene that encodes a transcription factor. This mutation reveals the requirement for Grhl2 in closure of embryonic tissues as Grhl2 mutants display cranial NTD (exencephaly), cleft face, body wall closure defect (thoracoabdominoschisis), and defective optic fissure closure (coloboma). Moreover, Grhl2 is required in other tissues as mutant embryos display lung and heart defects, soft tissue syndactyly, and molecular changes in the skin and hair follicle. Microarray analysis comparing wildtype and mutant cranial tissue reveals changes in a number of genes that encode proteins involved in cell adhesion. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrates a dramatic reduction in E-cadherin expression in mutant tissues, corresponding to where Grhl2 would normally be expressed. Moreover, we explore the relationship between the Grhl2 and AP-2α transcription factors during neural tube closure. Despite the similar fusion defects, Grhl2 and AP-2α do not regulate one another’s transcription and AP-2α is not required for E-cadherin protein expression. Thus, comparisons between these two models will be important in uncovering the molecular complexity that underlies the regulation of key embryonic closure events.

Analysis of Sequencing Results

The data were analyzed using the 454 GS-mapper software by the Consortium for Comparative Genomics at the University of Colorado Denver with assistance by V. Vemulapali. The targeted region of the mouse genome from C57BL/6 strain was downloaded from the UCSC browser and used as a reference for mapping of 454 sequence reads. Default parameters were used for 454 GS-mapper software analyses. Approximately 80% of the sequence obtained from the enriched library mapped back to the region of interest. The GS-mapper produced a file with the details of high quality mutations, and this file was further processed and summarized using a Perl script. Because our source genomic DNA was expected to be homozygous for any mutations within the targeted region, the Perl script filtered out putative mutations at sites where at least one read matched the reference sequence. Sequencing data from the 454 GS-FLX sequencer were aligned with the published C57BL/6 sequence using the 454 sequencer software to generate a list with nucleotides that differed in the mutant DNA (referred to as SNPs). Further analysis of the SNPs was done through Ensembl ( http://uswest.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Info/Index ) and the Expasy translation engine ( http://www.expasy.ch/tools/dna.html ) to determine the effect of the nucleotide change on predicted proteins and potential regulatory elements.

These analyses identified a SNP in the coding region of Grhl2 predicted to create a stop codon. To verify this result, DNA from 4 mutant and 4 wildtype embryos was extracted using Qiagen DNA extraction kit (cat#69581). A 400-nucleotide region around position 37,200,529 bp on chromosome 15 was PCR amplified with custom designed primers (Sequencing Forward: AAA GAC TAG TGG CCT TAG TGC CCA; Sequencing Reverse: CTC GGT GAT GGA TAC ACT GTA CTG CT). Sequencing of the 400 nucleotide region was performed at the Barbara Davis Diabetes Center Molecular Biology Core using these same custom primers.

For genotyping of carrier animals and embryos, the Grhl2 1Nisw mutation was specifically detected using ARMS primers according to Ye et al. (2001) : Outer primer 1: TAG TGG CCT TAG TGC CCA TGC CCA GTG; outer primer 2: TGA AGT TGG GTT TCA CAA GGG GGG AGG; A allele primer: CTG CCG CCC TGG GCC TGC TCA AA; T allele primer: CCA AGG GAG AGC CCA CCT TGT AGT AGA CA.

Discussion

Neural tube development has been an area of intense research since the beginning of the previous century. A major goal within the field is to relate the knowledge acquired in various animal systems to better understand the causes and methods of prevention of neural tube defects in humans that occur at high frequency and with a significant emotional and medical impact. Despite the substantial increase in knowledge of neural tube development, there are gaps in our understanding of this process. The last step of neural tube formation, joining of the neural folds, is a good example of a poorly understood aspect of neural tube development. Moreover, there are few animal models for the study of closure or fusion of the body wall, optic fissure and face. In this study we explored a novel mutation in mouse that causes a general defect in embryonic tissue closure, affecting closure of the neural tube, face, body wall, and optic fissure.

From a forward genetic screen for neural tube defects, the mutant mouse line, Line2F, was identified and found to have a wide range of phenotypes including a general closure defect as well as abnormalities in lung and heart development. Using a new technology of genomic sequence capture and high-throughput sequencing of the 2.5 Mb region associated with the Line2F phenotype, we identified an ENU-induced point mutation in the Grhl2 gene, a transcription factor that belongs to the Grainyhead-like (Grhl) family of proteins. Mutations in mammalian Grhl2 have been implicated in age-related hearing impairment in humans, although the mechanism is unknown ( Peters et al., 2002 ; Van Laer et al., 2008 ). In cancer cells, Grhl2 has been implicated in telomerase regulation and cell proliferation ( Tanaka et al., 2008 ; Kang et al., 2009 ). However, we saw no alteration in proliferation in the embryonic neural tube of Grhl2 mutant mouse embryos. With respect to the function of Grhl2 during embryonic development, our studies and recent results ( Rifat et al., 2010 ; Werth et al. 2010) show that loss of Grhl2 in embryos leads to neural tube defects. In the case of the neural tube, our data indicate that formation of hinge points is not disrupted in Grhl2 1Nisw mutants and neural fold elevation and apposition occurs normally, and thus we suggest that neural fold fusion is the critical step disrupted in Grhl2 1Nisw mutants. Our results differ from those of Rifat et al. (2010) in that they report lack of dorsolateral hinge point formation after loss of Grhl2. The discrepancy between their findings and ours may be due to a) the different genetic backgrounds as our results show that Grhl2 1Nisw phenotypes are strain dependent and b) the use of different mutant alleles. Our work here also extends the role of Grhl2 to show that it is required more generally in the closure of embryonic tissues and development of various organs. Moreover, we show that Grhl2 expression correlates well with the embryonic tissues that show a phenotype in Grhl2 1Nisw mutant embryos. The discovery of the importance of Grhl2 transcription factor in tissue morphogenesis opens new avenues to explore the cellular and molecular basis of these critical embryonic processes.

In the field of neural tube development, the idea that adhesion molecules are crucial for the process of neural fold fusion has been widely accepted, but very little evidence provides solid support for this idea. For example, Eph5A has been long hypothesized to regulate the last step of neural tube closure, based on its adhesive properties and the fact that Eph5A null mice develop cranial neural tube defects, but definite evidence for such involvement is lacking ( Holmberg et al., 2000 ). The fusion defects in the Grhl2 1Nisw mutant led us to hypothesize that Grhl2 transcription factor affects the expression of adhesion molecules during embryonic development. To explore this hypothesis we used microarray analysis to identify direct and indirect targets of Grhl2 . Our microarray results supports the hypothesis that Grhl2 is involved in regulation of adhesion, as many of the genes that are misexpressed in Grhl2 1Nisw mutants encode proteins involved in adhesion/epithelial function. We then specifically explored the relationship between Grhl2 and E-cadherin and showed that E-cadherin expression coincides with that of Grhl2 and E-cadherin protein is downregulated in the Grhl2 1Nisw mutant in the tissues that display a phenotype. The relationship between Grhl2 and E-cadherin was also observed by Werth et al. (2010) and they showed that Grhl2 directly binds to the promoters of E-cadherin and Claudin4 (another target identified in our microarray) to directly regulate their transcription. Our microarray results also reveal a number of other genes affected by the loss of Grhl2. One intriguing possibility is that the Grhl2 transcription factor may bind to the promoter elements of a battery of genes to coordinately regulate the expression of proteins needed for epithelial-mediated morphogenesis. Following this reasoning, the spatial and temporal regulation of Grhl2 expression could induce the expression of a cohort of targets and serve to rapidly alter adhesion and epithelial function in a highly synchronized manner.

One of the top targets of Grhl2 revealed by the microarray experiment was E-cadherin (cadherin1). Homozygous null mutation of E-cadherin is not compatible with life as these embryos show severe abnormalities before implantation ( Riethmacher et al., 1995 ). In the Grhl2 mutant, E-cadherin expression is altered in a specific spatial and temporal pattern. There is a striking correlation between Grhl2 expression and specific downregulation of E-cadherin expression in those tissues that are affected in the Grhl2 1Nisw mutants (neural tube, face, body wall, skin, lung). In the closing neural folds, Grhl2 and E-cadherin are expressed on the non-neural ectoderm, which is the single cell layer that overlies and wraps around the tip of the neural fold. E-cadherin expression in the non-neural ectoderm is abolished in Grhl2 1Nisw mutants. Our recent in vivo imaging studies have demonstrated that the non-neural ectoderm initiates the process of neural fold fusion (Pyrgaki et al., 2010). Chen and Hale (1995) cultured rat embryos with an antisense oligonucleotide against E-cadherin and showed that this led to cranial neural tube malformations ( Chen and Hales, 1995 ). Taken together with our results suggesting that fusion is the defective step of neural tube development in the Grhl2 1Nisw mutants, we propose that disruption of Grhl2 function affects expression of E-cadherin, as well as likely other adhesion molecules revealed by the microarray, causing the non-neural ectoderm to lose its adhesive capacity. This we propose results in failure of the opposing neural folds to adhere, leading to NTD. Although it has been long hypothesized that E-cadherin plays a crucial role in neural tube development, this is the first time that loss of E-cadherin from the non-neural ectoderm of the neural folds is correlated with failure of the neural tube to close. Further studies are necessary to determine whether loss of E-cadherin alone is responsible for NTD. Indeed, our results indicate that other adhesion and apical junctional complex molecules are also downregulated in Grhl2 mutants and therefore, it may be the combined loss of these molecules that disrupts neural tube closure.

E-cadherin also plays an essential role in generation and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity ( Behrens et al., 1993 ; McNeill et al., 1990 ). An alternate mechanism that could lead to the same NTD outcome is that loss of Grhl2 function, with its consequent effects on E-cadherin and other genes needed for epithelial cell function, may disrupt the structure of the non-neural ectodermal layer so that the cells are misoriented and/or have aberrant polarity and hence cannot associate properly. The epithelium of the neural folds, lung and skin is surprising normal in terms of cell shape and organization. In the mutant lung, there is a loss of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and Ezrin expression, suggesting a defect in cell polarity and/or maintenance of the epithelial cell layer. Indeed, the smaller airways may indicate a structural defect in the lung epithelium. However, this is not a consistent finding as in the skin and hair follicle, despite the loss of E-cadherin, β-catenin is localized normally on the plasma membrane of the cells and appendage structure appears normal.

Our results with the AP2α mutant highlight the molecular complexity of neural fold fusion. Although the closure defects in AP2a null and Grhl2 1Nisw mutant embryos are strikingly similar, we found that AP2α and Grhl2 do not regulate one another’s transcription and, moreover, AP2α mutants show normal expression of E-cadherin in the neural folds whereas Grhl2 1Nisw mutants show loss of E-cadherin. Moreover, trans-heterozygotes do not show evidence for genetic interaction. The work described here demonstrates that Grhl2 directly or indirectly regulates an extensive set of genes involved in adhesion and epithelial function, many of which may contribute to the process of neural fold fusion. In the future, it will be of interest to determine whether AP2α regulates a subset of these genes or whether it acts through an independent mechanism. In this respect, recent evidence demonstrates a critical function for protease signaling and Rac1 function from the non-neural ectoderm during neural tube closure ( Camerer et al., 2010 ). Our microarray data on the Grhl2 mutant does not suggest an intersection between Grhl2 and this protease network, at least at a transcriptional level. The present study opens new avenues to explore the commonalities and differences between the molecular pathways regulated by protease signaling, AP2α, and Grhl family members in the closure of embryonic tissues.
