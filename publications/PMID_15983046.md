Keap1 is a BTB-Kelch protein that functions as a substrate adaptor protein for a 
Cul3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Keap1 targets its substrate, the 
Nrf2 transcription factor, for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 
26 S proteasome. Inhibition of Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2 increases 
steady-state levels of Nrf2 and enables activation of cytoprotective 
Nrf2-dependent genes. In this report, we demonstrate that Keap1 and three other 
BTB-Kelch proteins, including GAN1, ENC1, and Sarcosin, are ubiquitinated by a 
Cul3-dependent complex. Ubiquitination of Keap1 is markedly increased in cells 
exposed to quinone-induced oxidative stress, occurs in parallel with inhibition 
of Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2, and results in decreased steady-state 
levels of Keap1, particularly in cells that are unable to synthesize 
glutathione. Degradation of Keap1 is independent of the 26 S proteasome, because 
inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome do not prevent loss of Keap1 following 
exposure of cells to quinone-induced oxidative stress. Our results suggest that 
a switch from substrate to substrate adaptor ubiquitination is a critical 
regulatory step that controls steady-state levels of both BTB-Kelch substrate 
adaptor proteins and their cognate substrates.
