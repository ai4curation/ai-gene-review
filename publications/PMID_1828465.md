## Abstract

The flaA locus of Bacillus subtilis is part of a large operon coding for 
flagellar structures, motility functions, and an ATPase-like polypeptide.

We cloned and sequenced 8.3 kb of Bacillus subtilis DNA corresponding to the 
flaA locus involved in flagellar biosynthesis, motility, and chemotaxis. The DNA 
sequence revealed the presence of 10 complete and 2 incomplete open reading 
frames. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences to data banks showed 
similarities of nine of the deduced products to a number of proteins of 
Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium for which a role in flagellar 
functioning has been directly demonstrated. In particular, the sequence data 
suggest that the flaA operon codes for the M-ring protein, components of the 
motor switch, and the distal part of the basal-body rod. The gene order is 
remarkably similar to that described for region III of the enterobacterial 
flagellar regulon. One of the open reading frames was translated into a protein 
with 48% amino acid identity to S. typhimurium FliI and 29% identity to the beta 
subunit of E. coli ATP synthase.
