The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) of the MAP kinase superfamily is activated in 
response to a variety of cellular stresses and is involved in apoptosis in 
neurons. However, the roles of the JNK signaling pathway in the nervous system 
are unknown. The genes for the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of JNK, JNK-1, and 
its direct activator, JKK-1, were isolated based on their abilities to function 
in the Hog1 MAP kinase pathway in yeast. JKK-1 is a member of the MAP kinase 
kinase superfamily and functions as a specific activator of JNK. Both jnk-1 and 
jkk-1 are expressed in most neurons. jkk-1 null mutant animals exhibit defects 
in locomotion that can be rescued by the conditional expression of JKK-1 in 
mutant adults, suggesting that the defect is not due to a developmental error. 
Furthermore, ectopic expression of JKK-1 in type-D motor neurons is sufficient 
to rescue the movement defect. Thus, the C.elegans JNK pathway functions in 
type-D GABAergic motor neurons and thereby modulates coordinated locomotion.
