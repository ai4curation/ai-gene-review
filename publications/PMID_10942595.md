The human cDNA and genomic sequencing projects will result in the identification 
and isolation of some 140,000 genes, the majority of which lack predicted 
functions and for which the cellular localizations are not known. The 
identification and characterization of protein components of specific cell 
structures and machineries are essential steps not only toward defining 
functions of genes but also toward understanding cell function and regulation. 
We describe here a new approach, termed PROLOC, which uses full-length cDNAs for 
systematic classification of novel proteins as a functional pointer. We have 
PCR-amplified 25 uncharacterized human genes and expressed the encoded proteins 
as GFP fusions in a human cell line. This pilot project has identified novel 
proteins associated with the nucleolus, mitochondria, the ER, the 
ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the GC, the plasma membrane, and 
cytoplasmic foci. This visual classification approach may be scaled up to handle 
a large number of novel genes and permit the generation of a global cellular 
protein localization map. Such information should be valuable for many aspects 
of functional genomics and cell biology.
