Homologous recombination was utilized to generate mice with a deletion in the 
coding sequence of the nerve growth factor (NGF) gene. Animals homozygous for 
NGF disruption failed to respond to noxious mechanical stimuli, and histological 
analysis revealed profound cell loss in both sensory and sympathetic ganglia. 
Within dorsal root ganglia, effects of the mutation appeared to be restricted to 
small and medium peptidergic neurons. These observations confirm the critical 
dependence of sensory and sympathetic neurons on NGF and demonstrate that other 
neurotrophins are not able to compensate for the loss of NGF action on these 
cells. Examination of the central nervous system revealed that, in marked 
contrast with neurons of sensory and sympathetic ganglia, basal forebrain 
cholinergic neurons differentiate and continue to express phenotypic markers for 
the life span of the null mutant mice. Thus, differentiation and initial 
survival of central NGF-responsive neurons can occur in the absence of NGF.
