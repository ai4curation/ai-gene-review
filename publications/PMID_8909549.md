Molecular mechanisms linking pre- and postsynaptic membranes at the 
interneuronal synapses are little known. We tested the cadherin adhesion system 
for its localization in synapses of mouse and chick brains. We found that two 
classes of cadherin-associated proteins, alpha N- and beta-catenin, are broadly 
distributed in adult brains, colocalizing with a synaptic marker, synaptophysin. 
At the ultrastructural level, these proteins were localized in synaptic 
junctions of various types, forming a symmetrical adhesion structure. These 
structures sharply bordered the transmitter release sites associated with 
synaptic vesicles, although their segregation was less clear in certain types of 
synapses. N-cadherin was also localized at a similar site of synaptic junctions 
but in restricted brain nuclei. In developing synapses, the catenin-bearing 
contacts dominated their junctional structures. These findings demonstrate that 
interneuronal synaptic junctions comprise two subdomains, transmitter release 
zone and catenin-based adherens junction. The catenins localized in these 
junctions are likely associated with certain cadherin molecules including 
N-cadherin, and the cadherin/ catenin complex may play a critical role in the 
formation or maintenance of synaptic junctions.
