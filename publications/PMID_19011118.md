The floral regulators GIGANTEA (GI), CONSTANS (CO), and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) 
play key roles in the photoperiodic flowering responses of the long-day plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana. The GI-CO-FT pathway is highly conserved in plants. Here, 
we demonstrate that the circadian clock proteins LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) 
and CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) not only repressed the floral transition 
under short-day and long-day conditions but also accelerated flowering when the 
plants were grown under continuous light (LL). LHY and CCA1 accelerated 
flowering in LL by promoting FT expression through a genetic pathway that 
appears to be independent of the canonical photoperiodic pathway involving GI 
and CO proteins. A genetic screen revealed that the late-flowering phenotype of 
the lhy;cca1 double mutant under LL was suppressed through mutations in SHORT 
VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), a MADS box transcription factor. Yeast two-hybrid 
analysis demonstrated an interaction between SVP and FLOWERING LOCUS C, and 
genetic analysis indicated that these two proteins act as partially redundant 
repressors of flowering time. SVP protein accumulated in lhy;cca1 plants under 
LL. We propose a model in which LHY and CCA1 accelerate flowering in part by 
reducing the abundance of SVP and thereby antagonizing its capacity to repress 
FT expression under LL.

Abstract

The floral regulators GIGANTEA (GI), CONSTANS (CO), and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) play key roles in the photoperiodic flowering responses of the long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana . The GI-CO-FT pathway is highly conserved in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the circadian clock proteins LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK–ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) not only repressed the floral transition under short-day and long-day conditions but also accelerated flowering when the plants were grown under continuous light (LL). LHY and CCA1 accelerated flowering in LL by promoting FT expression through a genetic pathway that appears to be independent of the canonical photoperiodic pathway involving GI and CO proteins. A genetic screen revealed that the late-flowering phenotype of the lhy;cca1 double mutant under LL was suppressed through mutations in SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), a MADS box transcription factor. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated an interaction between SVP and FLOWERING LOCUS C, and genetic analysis indicated that these two proteins act as partially redundant repressors of flowering time. SVP protein accumulated in lhy;cca1 plants under LL. We propose a model in which LHY and CCA1 accelerate flowering in part by reducing the abundance of SVP and thereby antagonizing its capacity to repress FT expression under LL.

INTRODUCTION

Pioneering work by Garner and Allard (1920) classified plants into different daylength response types. They showed that long-day (LD) plants (LDP) take a shorter time to flower when light exposure exceeds a certain critical daylength, while short-day (SD) plants flower earlier when daylength is shorter than a critical length. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that SD plants actually measure the length of the night, which must exceed a critical length to induce flowering, and that these plants do not flower if grown under continuous light ( Thomas and Vince-Prue, 1997 ). Photoperiodic control of flowering time is tightly linked to the circadian clock, which acts as the time-keeping mechanism that measures the duration of the day and night ( Suarez-Lopez et al., 2001 ; Yanovsky and Kay, 2002 ; Más, 2005 ). The circadian clock is an endogenous oscillator with an approximate period of 24 h that can be synchronized, or entrained, to the exact period of daily oscillations in light and temperature ( Dunlap, 1999 ). This process enables an organism to phase its biological activities to the correct time of day.

The LDP are classified into two types, which flower only (absolute LDP) or flower most rapidly (facultative LDP) with more than a certain number of hours of light in each 24-h period ( Thomas and Vince-Prue, 1997 ). Arabidopsis thaliana is a facultative LDP and flowers much earlier in a daily regime with a long light period and a short dark period (e.g., 16 h of light/8 h of dark) than in one with a short light period and a long dark period (e.g., 8 h of light/16 h of dark or 10 h of light/14 h of dark). In Arabidopsis , two closely related MYB proteins, LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK–ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), are essential clock components with redundant functions that play important roles in photoperiodic flowering by controlling the rhythmic expression of flowering-time genes (Carre and Kim, 2002; Mizoguchi et al., 2002 , 2005 ). In particular, LHY and CCA1 regulate a flowering pathway comprising the genes GIGANTEA ( GI ), CONSTANS ( CO ), and FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) in light/dark cycles such as LD and SD ( Mizoguchi et al., 2002 , 2005 ; Más, 2005 ). FT gene expression is activated under LDs mainly through a conserved pathway consisting of GI and CO ( Mizoguchi et al., 2005 ).

Several other Arabidopsis genes, in which mutations also delay or accelerate flowering, have been identified previously ( Más, 2005 ). The relationship between flowering and daylength in Arabidopsis involves rhythmic, circadian clock–controlled expression of CO mRNA. In this model, CO mRNA levels rise and fall over the course of a day and produce an unstable protein. If CO mRNA levels are high when the plant is exposed to light, the CO protein product is stabilized and activates the expression of FT ( Suarez-Lopez et al., 2001 ; Valverde et al., 2004 ; Más, 2005 ). Comparative analysis of Arabidopsis and rice ( Oryza sativa ), a SD plant, demonstrated that functional differences between the Arabidopsis CO and its rice ortholog Heading date1 (Hd1) are the basis of the reversal in response type ( Hayama and Coupland, 2004 ). In rice, CO represses flowering under LD by repressing expression of the rice ortholog of FT , Heading date3 ( Hd3a ), whereas in Arabidopsis , it activates flowering by activating FT expression ( Hayama and Coupland, 2004 ). FT and Hd3a are candidates for a floral hormone, florigen ( Corbesier et al., 2007 ; Tamaki et al., 2007 ).

Although GI ( Suarez-Lopez et al., 2001 ; Mizoguchi et al., 2005 ), FLAVIN BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1 (FKF1), and CYCLING DOF FACTOR1 (CDF1) ( Imaizumi et al., 2005 ) are required for the rhythmic expression of CO mRNA, the molecular mechanism underlying the cooperation between GI and FKF1-CDF1 was largely unknown. Recent characterization of protein–protein interactions between FKF1 and GI ( Sawa et al., 2007 ) and between ZEITLUPE (ZTL) and GI ( Kim et al., 2007 ) has advanced our knowledge of how the circadian clock controls the upregulation of FT transcription just after evening under the inductive LD condition ( Rubio and Deng, 2007 ). The circadian clock controls rhythmic expression of the GI protein by an unidentified mechanism(s) ( David et al., 2006 ). Molecular interaction between GI and ZTL is stabilized by blue light. The ZTL–GI interaction controls the accumulation of the clock component TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), thus allowing robust circadian oscillations in gene expression ( Kim et al., 2007 ). Blue light also induces the formation of an FKF1-GI protein complex, which in turn targets CDF1, a transcriptional repressor of flowering, for degradation ( Sawa et al., 2007 ). CDF1 proteolysis releases transcriptional repression of the CO gene, which allows CO protein expression and LD-dependent accumulation to promote FT expression and flowering.

The effects of loss of function of LHY and CCA1 on flowering time under light/dark cycles such as LD and SD conditions were characterized in detail ( Mizoguchi et al., 2002 , 2005 ). Even though abnormal, plants with severe defects in circadian function showed rhythmic expression of clock-controlled genes such as Cab , CCR2 , GI , and LHYL1 under light/dark cycles. This suggests that some defects caused by loss of the internal clock function can be partially rescued by external rhythmic conditions. However, the roles of the circadian clock proteins in the long-term developmental control of animals and plants under continuous conditions without any rhythmic stimuli are not fully understood.

Here, we show that mutations in the circadian clock genes LHY and CCA1 ( lhy;cca1 ) delay flowering time of Arabidopsis under continuous light (LL), although they accelerate flowering under light/dark cycles such as LD and SD. Our genetic studies indicate that two mutations, short vegetative phase ( svp ) and flowering locus C ( flc ), partially suppress the late-flowering phenotype of lhy;cca1 . Accumulation of a floral repressor protein (SVP) in lhy;cca1 plants under LL and a diurnal pattern of SVP protein accumulation under LD explain a molecular mechanism for the novel activity of LHY and CCA1. Our results demonstrate that both an internal biological clock and external rhythms are required for the proper development of Arabidopsis .

DISCUSSION

In summary, our analysis of Arabidopsis mutants with severe defects in circadian clock function in LL has revealed a role for LHY and CCA1 in the control of flowering via FT expression. We propose that LHY and CCA1 can regulate flowering independently of their role in regulating the established photoperiodic response pathway through the transcription of GI - CO - FT (shown in blue in Figure 7 ). We hypothesize that LHY and CCA1 both activate the photoperiodic response pathway that promotes flowering and repress inhibitors of flowering such as SVP and FLC (shown in red in Figure 7 ). FLC delays flowering by repressing FT expression in the leaf ( Searle et al., 2006 ). In addition, FLC expression in the meristem impairs the response to the FT signal by directly repressing the expression of SOC1 ( Searle et al., 2006 ). FLC and SVP directly repress FT expression ( Searle et al., 2006 ; Lee et al., 2007 ). One possibility to explain the role of LHY and CCA1 is that they reduce the accumulation of SVP and thereby prevent SVP and FLC from forming a repressive complex that represses FT expression. These data are discussed in more detail in the following sections.

Under SD, lhy-12;cca1-101 plants flowered earlier than LL ( Figure 1 ). Moreover, lhy-12;cca1-101 plants flowered earlier as the dark period was extended, indicating that mutations in circadian clock components appeared to change photoperiodic response type in Arabidopsis ( Figures 1C and 1D ). When these mutants are grown under LL, the repression of flowering may occur through interactions with two MADS box proteins, SVP and FLC, which cause later flowering. Accumulation of SVP protein in lhy;cca1 plants under LL supports this idea ( Figure 6A ). However, under light/dark cycles the promotion of flowering in lhy;cca1 mutants through the photoperiodic pathway predominates and early flowering occurs. In wild-type plants, the balance in activity between these pathways differs from that in lhy;cca1 mutants, so that even in LL the promotion of flowering by the photoperiodic pathway overcomes the effect of SVP and FLC. Therefore, by altering the balance between these pathways, lhy;cca1 double mutants exhibit unique characteristics, flowering earlier under SD than under LL.

SVP was required for the late flowering of lhy;cca1 plants in LL ( Figures 3A and 3B ). However, lhy;cca1 did not affect the level of SVP mRNA in LL ( Figure 5C ). The hypocotyl length of lhy;cca1 is shorter than that of the wild type under red light, indicating that lhy;cca1 is sensitive to light ( Mizoguchi et al., 2005 ). These findings suggest that light may increase SVP activity to delay flowering. In fact, an increased level of SVP protein was found in lhy;cca1 under LL ( Figure 6A ). In LL, the late-flowering phenotype of 35S:SVP was much stronger than that in LD ( Figures 5D and 5E ), and expression levels of FT and SOC1 in 35S:SVP plants under LL were lower than those under LD (see Supplemental Figures 3A, 3C, and 3D online). GI and CO mRNA levels were less affected by 35S:SVP (see Supplemental Figures 3A, 3B, and 3E online). These results are consistent with our ideas that (1) SVP negatively regulates FT and SOC1 expression downstream of GI and CO, and (2) SVP activity may be affected by light. LHY and CCA1 play key roles in the Arabidopsis circadian clock ( Alabadí et al., 2001 , 2002 ; Mizoguchi et al., 2002 , 2005 ; Yanovsky and Kay, 2002 ). LHY and CCA1 are shown as negative regulators of GI based on the earlier phase of GI expression detected in a lhy;cca1 double mutant ( Mizoguchi et al., 2002 , 2005 ). In the control of flowering time, GI increases the amplitude of CO and FT expression ( Mizoguchi et al., 2005 ).

At least four processes involved in the control of flowering appear to be affected by light. First, the circadian clock can be entrained by light ( Yanovsky and Kay, 2002 ). Second, light plays a key role in the stabilization of CO protein in the process ( Valverde et al., 2004 ). Third, the light-dependent regulation of CO expression by GI-ZTL/FKF1-CDF1 was recently demonstrated ( Kim et al., 2007 ; Sawa et al., 2007 ). Fourth, we propose a novel role for LHY and CCA1 in the GI-CO–independent process to regulate flowering, based on molecular genetic, biochemical, and yeast two-hybrid analyses. This pathway probably includes the floral repressors encoding the MADS box transcription factors SVP and FLC and regulates the expression of FT and other floral activator genes.

Autonomous pathway proteins, including FCA and FLC, also regulate the expression of FT and SOC1 ( Hepworth et al., 2002 ). Although the lhy-12;cca1-101 double mutant had a tendency to show higher transcript levels of FLC compared with the wild type, we did not get consistent results (see Supplemental Figures 5A to 5C online). Of 21 biologically independent trials, 15 showed a great increase in FLC transcription in lhy-12;cca1-101 compared with the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 5A online). Meanwhile, another three samples showed only moderate increases (see Supplemental Figure 5B online), and the other three showed no differences (Supplemental Figure 5C online). In addition, lhy - 12 and cca1-101 single mutants, which flowered much earlier than the lhy-12;cca1-101 double mutant under LL, also showed higher FLC transcription (see Supplemental Figures 5A and 5D online). These data suggest that the FLC transcript level does not show correlation with flowering-time phenotype. For these reasons, we consider that the late-flowering phenotype of lhy;cca1 is not explained by the upregulation of FLC transcription.

Light appears to affect the activities of SVP and FLC to repress the expression of FT and SOC1 . Alternatively, the late flowering of lhy;cca1 may be explained by the destabilization of CO protein ( Valverde et al., 2004 ). However, this is not likely because (1) the late flowering of lhy;cca1 in LL was partially suppressed by svp ( Figures 3A and 3B ) and flc ( Figure 4E ) but that of co was not affected by flc (Michaels and Amasino, 1999) and (2) co did not show dark-green/curled leaves and short-hypocotyl phenotypes in LL. Loss and gain of function of the MADS box gene FLM/MAF1 caused early- and late-flowering phenotypes, respectively ( Scortecci et al., 2003 ). The late flowering of 35S:FLM and 35S:SVP is dependent on SVP and FLM activities, respectively. MADS box proteins can interact and constitute heterodimers or homodimers in yeast two-hybrid systems ( Folter et al., 2005 ). In this study, we detected protein–protein interaction between SVP and FLC in the yeast two-hybrid assay ( Figure 4B ). Complex formation among SVP, FLM/MAF1, and FLC as homodimers and heterodimers (or trimers) ( Folter et al., 2005 ) is likely to play key roles in the LHY/CCA1-dependent flowering pathway.

We show genetically that early flowering of the svp mutant required elevated transcript levels of FT and SOC1 , since mutations in these genes suppressed the early-flowering phenotype of svp ( Figures 3E and 3F ). The addition of the soc1 mutation to the ft-1 mutation, while not so evident in plants with normal SVP , was highly evident in plants with the svp mutation. This suggests that SVP may normally repress SOC1 , but not through FT.

Although only a short exposure to darkness appears to be effective to cause the switch from late to early flowering in lhy;cca1 , the precise mechanism underlying this effect remains to be elucidated and further analysis will be needed to understand it. Nevertheless, investigations of the multilayered regulation of flowering, through the classical photoperiodic pathway and the MADS box repressors of flowering, play a key role in identifying the relationship between photoperiod and flowering. We have established an unexpected role for LHY and CCA1 in regulating the abundance of the protein encoded by the floral repressor gene SVP. The regulation of this protein is influenced by light, so that it accumulates to high levels in lhy;cca1 plants under LL.

Under LD, the effect of lhy;cca1 on flowering time is reversed, so that the plants flower early. To understand the precise molecular mechanisms relating LHY and CCA1 to SVP stability and to internal and external rhythms will be an important challenge.

Recently, a central role of the interaction between SVP and FLC in the integration of various flowering signals was proposed ( Li et al., 2008 ). The precise mechanisms underlying the negative regulation of flowering in lhy;cca1 under LL are still not clear, because lhy;cca1 mutations did not greatly affect the mRNA levels of SVP ( Figure 5C ) or FLC (see Supplemental Figures 5A to 5C online) and we did not detect protein–protein interactions between LHY/CCA1 and SVP/FLC (R. Yoshida and T. Mizoguchi, unpublished data). Therefore, h ow SVP and FLC delayed flowering more strongly in lhy;cca1 mutants than in wild-type plants under LL is unknown. To find the missing link between LHY/CCA1 and SVP/FLC, the characterization of other mutations than svp and flc that cause lhy;cca1 to flower earlier than wild-type plants under LL will be useful.
