DNA methylation is a well-characterized epigenetic landmark involved in 
transcriptional regulation; however, mechanisms underlying its regulation remain 
poorly characterized. Recent studies demonstrate that activation-induced 
cytidine deaminase (AID) is involved in active DNA demethylation. AID is 
aberrantly expressed in inflammation-associated cancers and generates point 
mutations; however, cellular disorders attributed to its demethylation function 
are largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that ectopic AID expression perturbs 
tumor-related gene expression. AID (with Gadd45) activated a methylated paired 
box gene 5 (Pax5) reporter construct, and induced expression and association of 
endogenous Pax5 with the AID promoter, suggesting that aberrant AID expression 
triggers an auto-activation circuit to consolidate self-expression.
