Intestinal villus atrophy is a major complication of total parenteral nutrition 
(TPN). Our previous study revealed that TPN-induced villus atrophy is 
accompanied by elevated expression of CUGBP, Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1); 
however, its mechanism of action has not been fully understood. Herein, we 
report a pivotal role of CELF1/p53 axis, which induces a sustained 
antiproliferative signal, leading to suppressed proliferation of intestinal 
epithelial cells (IECs). By using a rat model of TPN, we found synchronous 
upregulation of CELF1 and p53 in jejunum mucosa, accompanied by a 51% decrease 
in crypt cell proliferation rate. By using HCT-116 cells as an IEC model in 
vitro, we found that the expression of CELF1 altered dynamically in parallel to 
proliferation rate, suggesting a self-adaptive expression pattern in IECs in 
vitro. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of CELF1 elicited a significant 
antiproliferative effect in HCT-116, Caco-2, and IEC-6 cells, whereas knockdown 
of CELF1 elicited a significant proproliferative effect. Moreover, cell-cycle 
assay revealed that ectopic overexpression of CELF1 induced sustained G2 arrest 
and G1 arrest in HCT-116 and IEC-6 cells, respectively, which could be abolished 
by p53 silencing. Mechanistically, polysomal profiling and nascent protein 
analysis revealed that regulation of p53 by CELF1 was mediated through 
accelerating its protein translation in polysomes. Taken together, our findings 
revealed a sustained suppression of IEC proliferation evoked by CELF1/p53 axis, 
which may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of TPN-induced 
villus atrophy.-Yan, J.-K., Zhang, T., Dai, L.-N., Gu, B.-L., Zhu, J., Yan,
