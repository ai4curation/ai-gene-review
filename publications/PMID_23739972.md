Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the CNS. They differentiate 
from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) that are produced from progenitors 
throughout life but more actively during the neonatal period and in response to 
demyelinating insults. An accurate regulation of oligodendrogenesis is required 
to generate oligodendrocytes during these developmental or repair processes. We 
hypothesized that this regulation implicates transcription factors, which are 
expressed by OPCs and/or their progenitors. Ascl1/Mash1 is a proneural 
transcription factor previously implicated in embryonic oligodendrogenesis and 
operating in genetic interaction with Olig2, an essential transcriptional 
regulator in oligodendrocyte development. Herein, we have investigated the 
contribution of Ascl1 to oligodendrocyte development and remyelination in the 
postnatal cortex. During the neonatal period, Ascl1 expression was detected in 
progenitors of the cortical subventricular zone and in cortical OPCs. Different 
genetic approaches to delete Ascl1 in cortical progenitors or OPCs reduced 
neonatal oligodendrogenesis, showing that Ascl1 positively regulated both OPC 
specification from subventricular zone progenitors as well as the balance 
between OPC differentiation and proliferation. Examination of remyelination 
processes, both in the mouse model for focal demyelination of the corpus 
callosum and in multiple sclerosis lesions in humans, indicated that Ascl1 
activity was upregulated along with increased oligodendrogenesis observed in 
remyelinating lesions. Additional genetic evidence indicated that remyelinating 
oligodendrocytes derived from Ascl1(+) progenitors/OPCs and that Ascl1 was 
required for proper remyelination. Together, our results show that Ascl1 
function modulates multiple steps of OPC development in the postnatal brain and 
in response to demyelinating insults.
