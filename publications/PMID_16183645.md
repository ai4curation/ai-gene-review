Glutathione deficiency is an early biochemical feature that occurs during 
apoptotic neuronal death associated with certain neurological disorders such as 
Parkinson disease. However, whether specific targeting of glutathione 
biosynthesis in neurons is sufficient to trigger neurodegeneration remains 
undetermined. To address this issue, we used a vector-based small hairpin RNA 
(shRNA) strategy to knock down each subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL; 
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase), the heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the 
rate-limiting step of glutathione biosynthesis. Independent targeting of the 
catalytic and modulatory subunits by shRNA caused disruption of GCL as assessed 
by Northern and Western blotting, enzyme activity, and glutathione 
concentrations. Silencing each subunit in primary cortical neurons spontaneously 
elicited time-dependent apoptotic death, an effect that was synergistic with 
glutamate or nitric oxide treatment. Moreover, neuronal apoptosis by GCL 
knockdown was rescued by expressing the corresponding subunit full-length cDNA 
carrying silent mutations within the shRNA target cDNA sequence and by 
incubating neurons with gamma-glutamylcysteine or glutathione ethyl ester. In 
contrast, supplying glutathione precursors to neurons from co-cultured 
astrocytes did not prevent the apoptotic death triggered by GCL knockdown. 
Finally, overexpressing the catalytic (but not modulatory) GCL subunit 
full-length cDNA increased enzyme activity and glutathione concentrations, 
yielding neurons more resistant to glutamate- or nitric oxide-mediated 
apoptosis. Thus, specific and independent disruption of each subunit of GCL in 
neurons can be said to cause a primary decrease in glutathione that is 
sufficient to promote neurodegeneration.
