BACKGROUND: Germline gain-of-function (GOF) variants in the signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene lead to a rare inherited disorder 
characterized by early-onset multiorgan autoimmunity.
METHODS: We described a Chinese patient with infantile-onset diabetes and 
multiorgan autoimmunity. The patient presented with early-onset type 1 diabetes 
and autoimmune hypothyroidism at 7 months. During the 7.5-year follow-up, she 
developed pseudo-celiac enteropathy at 1 year of age and showed severe growth 
retardation. Whole-exome sequencing was performed and the novel variant was 
further assessed by in vitro functional assays.
RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel variant (c.1069G>A, 
p.Glu357Lys) in the DNA-binding domain of STAT3. In vitro functional studies 
revealed that p.Glu357Lys was a GOF variant by increasing STAT3 transcriptional 
activity and phosphorylation. In addition, the STAT3 Glu357Lys variant caused 
dysregulation of insulin gene expression by enhancing transcriptional inhibition 
of the insulin gene enhancer binding protein factor 1 (ISL1).
CONCLUSION: In the current study, we describe clinical manifestations and 
identify a novel STAT3 GOF variant (c.1069G>A) in a Chinese patient. This 
activating variant impairs insulin expression by increasing transcriptional 
inhibition of its downstream transcription factor ISL1, which could be involved 
in the pathogenesis of early-onset diabetes.
