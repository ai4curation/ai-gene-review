Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its fetal form, transforming growth factor 
alpha (TGF-alpha) are renal mitogens which induce epithelial hyperplasia, 
proximal tubular cyst formation (TC), and accelerated distal nephron 
differentiation in metanephric organ culture. To delineate the intracellular 
mechanisms mediating these growth factor effects, we studied the specific role 
of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), the common receptor for both 
ligands, as an activated tyrosine kinase in TC formation and nephrogenesis. 
Fetal murine metanephric explants were incubated for 120 hours in control, and 
EGF (15 ng/ml)/TGF-alpha (10 ng/ml) supplemented medium with and without EGF-R 
blocking monoclonal antibody (50 mg/ml), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor. EGF-R 
tyrosine kinase inhibition was achieved by incubation with a synthetic 
tyrphostin (TP B42) (0.1 microM) or genestein (5.5 micrograms/ml). The following 
parameters were assessed: (a) segment-specific nephron development using 
morphometry and immunohistology; (b) tubular epithelial hyperplasia by protein 
content and BrdU uptake; and (c) TC formation by morphometric cystic index. Both 
growth factors produced hyperplastic proximal TC, significantly increased 
explant growth, and significantly increased distal nephron differentiation. 
Inhibiting the ligand-EGF-R interaction with EGF-R blocking monoclonal antibody 
abolished all growth factor-induced effects and resulted in increased amounts of 
undifferentiated mesenchyme and decreased distal nephron differentiation. 
Inhibition of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity with either Tyrphostin B42 or 
genestein blocked TC formation and produced nodular blastemal hyperplasia and 
decreased distal nephron differentiation.
