TGFbeta ligands act as tumor suppressors in early stage tumors but are 
paradoxically diverted into potent prometastatic factors in advanced cancers. 
The molecular nature of this switch remains enigmatic. Here, we show that 
TGFbeta-dependent cell migration, invasion and metastasis are empowered by 
mutant-p53 and opposed by p63. Mechanistically, TGFbeta acts in concert with 
oncogenic Ras and mutant-p53 to induce the assembly of a mutant-p53/p63 protein 
complex in which Smads serve as essential platforms. Within this ternary 
complex, p63 functions are antagonized. Downstream of p63, we identified two 
candidate metastasis suppressor genes associated with metastasis risk in a large 
cohort of breast cancer patients. Thus, two common oncogenic lesions, mutant-p53 
and Ras, selected in early neoplasms to promote growth and survival, also 
prefigure a cellular set-up with particular metastasis proclivity by 
TGFbeta-dependent inhibition of p63 function.
