Interleukin 35 (IL-35) belongs to the IL-12 family of heterodimeric cytokines 
but has a distinct functional profile. IL-35 suppresses T cell proliferation and 
converts naive T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells (iTr35 
cells). Here we found that IL-35 signaled through a unique heterodimer of 
receptor chains IL-12Rβ2 and gp130 or homodimers of each chain. Conventional T 
cells were sensitive to IL-35-mediated suppression in the absence of one 
receptor chain but not both receptor chains, whereas signaling through both 
chains was required for IL-35 expression and conversion into iTr35 cells. 
Signaling through the IL-35 receptor required the transcription factors STAT1 
and STAT4, which formed a unique heterodimer that bound to distinct sites in the 
promoters of the genes encoding the IL-12 subunits p35 and Ebi3. This 
unconventional mode of signaling, distinct from that of other members of the 
IL-12 family, may broaden the spectrum and specificity of IL-35-mediated 
suppression.
