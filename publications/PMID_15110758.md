The TIA-1-interacting protein Fas-activated serine/threonine phosphoprotein 
(FAST) is a component of a signaling cascade that is initiated by ligation of 
the Fas receptor. Immunofluorescence microscopy using affinity-purified 
antibodies raised against recombinant FAST reveals that the endogenous protein 
associates with mitochondria. Subcellular fractionation confirms that FAST is a 
component of mitochondria. FAST is tethered to mitochondria by a 
lysine/arginine-rich domain at its carboxyl terminus that is structurally 
similar to the mitochondrial tethering motifs of monoamine oxidase B and 
cytochrome b5. At the mitochondrial membrane, FAST interacts with BCL-X(L). The 
BCL-X(L) binding domain maps to a BCL-2-homology-3 (BH3)-related domain that is 
distinct from the mitochondrial-tethering domain (MTD). Although interactions 
between FAST and BCL-X(L) require both the BH3-related domain and the MTD, the 
requirement for mitochondrial tethering can be conferred by a heterologous MTD. 
Our results suggest that FAST-BCL-X(L) interactions are likely to regulate 
mitochondrial metabolism during Fas-induced apoptosis.
