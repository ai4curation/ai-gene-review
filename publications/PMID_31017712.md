Lanthanide (Ln)-dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) have recently been 
shown to be widespread in methylotrophic bacteria. Along with the core MDH 
protein, XoxF, these systems contain two other proteins, XoxG (a c-type 
cytochrome) and XoxJ (a periplasmic binding protein of unknown function), about 
which little is known. In this work, we have biochemically and structurally 
characterized these proteins from the methyltroph Methylobacterium extorquens 
AM1. In contrast to results obtained in an artificial assay system, assays of 
XoxFs metallated with LaIII , CeIII , and NdIII using their physiological 
electron acceptor, XoxG, display Ln-independent activities, but the Km for XoxG 
markedly increases from La to Nd. This result suggests that XoxG's redox 
properties are tuned specifically for lighter Lns in XoxF, an interpretation 
supported by the unusually low reduction potential of XoxG (+172 mV). The X-ray 
crystal structure of XoxG provides a structural basis for this reduction 
potential and insight into the XoxG-XoxF interaction. Finally, the X-ray crystal 
structure of XoxJ reveals a large hydrophobic cleft and suggests a role in the 
activation of XoxF. These studies enrich our understanding of the underlying 
chemical principles that enable the activity of XoxF with multiple lanthanides 
in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract

Lanthanide (Ln)-dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) have been recently shown to be widespread in methylotrophic bacteria. Along with the core MDH protein, XoxF, these systems comprise two other proteins, XoxG (a c -type cytochrome) and XoxJ (a periplasmic binding protein of unknown function), about which little is known. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize these proteins from the methyltroph, Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. In contrast to results obtained via an artificial assay system, assays of XoxFs metallated with La III , Ce III , and Nd III using their physiological electron acceptor, XoxG, display Ln-independent activities, but the K m for XoxG markedly increases from La to Nd. This result suggests that XoxG’s redox properties are tuned specifically for lighter Lns in XoxF, an interpretation supported by the unusually low reduction potential of XoxG (+172 mV). The x-ray crystal structure of XoxG provides a structural basis for this reduction potential and insight into the XoxG-XoxF interaction. Finally, the x-ray crystal structure of XoxJ reveals a large hydrophobic cleft and suggests a role in activation of XoxF. These studies enrich our understanding of the underlying chemical principles that enable the activity of XoxF with multiple lanthanides in vitro and in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

Methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) are abundant periplasmic enzymes in methylotrophic bacteria, catalyzing the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and enabling use of methane and/or methanol as these organisms’ sole carbon source. [ 1 ] The active site of the canonical MDH, MxaFI, contains a Ca II ion coordinated to a pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor. [ 1b , 2 ] The Ca II ion facilitates activation of the PQQ cofactor for the formal hydride transfer reaction from methanol to PQQ. [ 1b , 3 ] The electrons extracted from methanol by this cofactor are transferred to the respiratory complex via a relay of two c -type cytochromes: a cytochrome c L (MxaG) interacts directly with the MDH and transfers electrons to cytochrome c H ( Scheme 1A ). [ 1b , 4 ] Recently, it was discovered that many methylotrophs also encode MDHs [ 5 ] and other PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases [ 6 ] that utilize a lanthanide ion (Ln III ) rather than calcium in their active sites. The Ln-dependent MDH, XoxF, contains an analogous active site, except with the PQQ cofactor coordinated to a Ln III ion and an additional carboxylate ligand to the metal ion. [ 5b , 7 ] Presumably, the greater Lewis acidity of Ln III ions over that of Ca II is advantageous for increasing the reduction potential of PQQ to facilitate this reaction. [ 6d , 8 ]

An unusual feature of the characterized Ln-dependent enzymes, relative to most other metalloenzymes, is that multiple metal ions are able to support their activity. Accordingly, there is significant interest in understanding the chemical underpinnings of the preference that these enzymes, as well as the bacteria that encode them, exhibit for the more abundant, lighter Lns – especially La, Ce, Pr, and Nd – over the subsequent less abundant, heavier Lns, Sm-Lu. The systems for which the most information is currently available are Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV and Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. The first detailed biochemical and structural characterization of a Ln-dependent MDH was the XoxF from M. fumariolicum , [ 5b ] an organism that requires Lns for growth, with La-Nd preferred, although Sm, Eu, and Gd can also support weak growth. Further studies [ 8d , 9 ] demonstrated that this XoxF had maximal activity in the standard artificial dye-linked assay ( Scheme 1B ) when metallated with Pr and Nd. Activity was ~30% lower with La and fell off quickly beyond Nd. This biphasic behavior was attributed to competition between the Lewis acidity of the Ln III ion, increasing across the series and therefore enhancing reactivity of the PQQ cofactor, with other, opposing factors. These other factors may include coordination number preferences and substrate binding affinity but are poorly understood. [ 8d ]

For M. extorquens , the subject of the present study, it was shown [ 10 ] that only La-Nd, and Sm to a lesser extent, supported Ln-dependent growth on methanol in the absence of the Ca-MDH. The same series of Lns selectively activated the xox promoter. At the time, it was unclear whether this effect was due to sub-optimal cellular uptake of heavy Lns, diminished activity of XoxF with heavy Lns, or both. Recently, we demonstrated, using a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for Lns, [ 11 ] that only light Lns, La-Nd, are efficiently imported into the bacterial cytosol, a process likely facilitated by a secreted metallophore. [ 11c ] Therefore, it appears that on multiple levels – including, at least, regulation, [ 10 ] uptake, [ 11c , 12 ] and trafficking, [ 11a ] – M. extorquens is fine-tuned for utilization of solely light Lns.

An understudied aspect of Ln-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases is the involvement of partner proteins in their activity inside the cell. PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases such as XoxF and MxaFI are found in operons [ 6d , 13 ] along with genes encoding the cytochrome c L (XoxG and MxaG, respectively) and a protein of unknown function (XoxJ and MxaJ, respectively). MxaJ was recently characterized as a member of the periplasmic binding protein (PBP) family – proteins typically associated with membrane-bound transport systems for small molecules – but its substrate is unknown. [ 14 ] Deletion of mxaJ disrupts activation of the Ca-MDH, suggesting a role for MxaJ in this process, which is not well understood in any MDH system. [ 15 ] By extension, we presume that XoxJ plays an analogous role in Ln-MDH activation. MxaG is the electron acceptor [ 4c ] for MxaFI. [ 4a , 4b , 16 ] Recently, Chistoserdova and co-workers [ 17 ] reported the first purification of a XoxG protein, from Methylomonas sp. LW13, and showed that it has an absorption spectrum consistent with bound heme and that it can act as the electron acceptor for La-XoxF, but no detailed biochemical or kinetic characterization was performed.

We set out to provide a physiological context for understanding the activity of M. extorquens XoxF metallated with different Lns, by characterizing the other proteins encoded by the xox operon. We focused on the effect of Ln III coordination on the midpoint reduction potential ( E m ) of the PQQ cofactor in XoxF. This property is expected to increase as a function of Ln III Lewis acidity, via enhanced withdrawal of electron density from the reactive C5 carbonyl of the cofactor. Lewis acidity increases left to right across the period due to decreasing ionic radius, [ 18 ] but we presume that XoxG’s reduction potential is relatively fixed. Therefore, after a certain point in the Ln series, XoxG may become a progressively less efficient oxidant for the reduced Ln III -PQQ cofactor, providing a possible chemical rationale for the unsuitability of Lns beyond Nd in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we characterized XoxG and its interaction with XoxF. We show that the V max parameters of XoxFs metallated with La, Ce, and Nd are similar when assayed with XoxG. However, the K m for XoxG increases sharply from La-XoxF to Nd-XoxF. Biochemical characterization of XoxG reveals a surprisingly low E m for a c -type cytochrome, and structural characterization shows that, compared to MxaG, the heme binding site is significantly more solvent exposed. These findings may account for the observed redox properties and modulation of K m . We also complete the characterization of the xox operon by reporting the first biochemical and structural studies of a XoxJ protein, and we discuss potential functions in activation of XoxF, about which little is currently known. These studies yield insight into the selectivity of Ln-utilizing bacteria for light Lns and emphasize the importance of understanding enzymatic systems in the context of their physiological partners.

DISCUSSION

In this manuscript, we have reported the first detailed characterization of XoxF activity with its physiological electron acceptor, XoxG. These studies reveal that the redox properties of XoxG are tuned to favor the lighter Lns in XoxF, with catalytic efficiencies markedly decreasing even over the range of Lns tolerated by M. extorquens for growth. Structural characterization of XoxG suggests a potential rationale for these observations. Here we focus on the ramifications of these data for understanding the physiological activities of XoxF systems. We also discuss the insights that our structural and biochemical characterization of XoxJ, the third and most enigmatic member of the xox operon, offers into the function of this protein and of MxaJ in the Ca-MDH.

Conclusion

Biology’s preference for lighter lanthanides to oxidize methanol, while perhaps necessitated by elemental abundance considerations, is nevertheless an intriguing chemical problem on multiple levels – from selective metal ion recognition and incorporation into XoxF, to chemical ramifications of utilization of a range of Ln III s in one enzyme. The availability of the entire Ln III series and Y III for in vitro analysis offers a unique opportunity to dissect these many intersecting factors in a single enzyme system. Our work provides the first insights into the implications for cofactor electron transfer, necessary for enzyme activity in vivo, that are associated with substitution of Lns in XoxFs. Not only has Nature developed sophisticated (and yet to be fully elucidated) mechanisms for selective uptake [ 11c ] and regulation [ 6c , 10 , 46 ] of light Lns – it has carefully tuned redox properties of the MDH and its electron acceptor, XoxG, to prefer these metals over the later Lns. Furthermore, our characterization of the third and least understood member of the xox operon, XoxJ, provides a path forward to unraveling the mechanism of activation of MDHs with PQQ and metal ions. An understanding of this mechanism would facilitate studies of Ln substitution in XoxF, providing a deeper understanding of how and why methylotrophs have harnessed Ln chemistry for one of their most crucial reactions.
