Drosophila neuroblasts provide an excellent model for asymmetric cell divisions, 
where cell-fate determinants such as Miranda localize at the basal cortex and 
segregate to one daughter cell. Mechanisms underlying this process, however, 
remain elusive. We found that Mo25 and the GC kinase Fray act in this 
regulation. mo25 and fray mutants show an indistinguishable defect in Miranda 
localization. On the other hand, Drosophila Mo25 interacts with the tumor 
suppressor kinase Lkb1 in vivo, as have shown in mammals. Overexpression of 
Lkb1, which accumulates in the cell cortex, drastically relocalizes both Mo25 
and Fray from the cytoplasm to the cortex, causing the same phenotype as 
mo25-mutant neuroblasts. Recovery from this defect caused by Lkb1 overexpression 
requires simultaneous overexpression of Mo25 and Fray. We suggest from those 
results that Mo25 and Fray operate together or in the same pathway in Drosophila 
asymmetric processes, and that their function counterbalances Lkb1.
