In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes in close proximity to 
telomeres are subject to transcriptional silencing through the process of 
telomere position effect (TPE). Here, we show that the protein Ku, previously 
implicated in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and in telomeric length 
maintenance, is also essential for telomeric silencing. Furthermore, using an in 
vivo plasmid rejoining assay, we demonstrate that SIR2, SIR3 and SIR4, three 
genes shown previously to function in TPE, are essential for Ku-dependent DSB 
repair. As is the case for Ku-deficient strains, residual repair operating in 
the absence of the SIR gene products ensues through an error-prone DNA repair 
pathway that results in terminal deletions. To identify novel components of the 
Ku-associated DSB repair pathway, we have tested several other candidate genes 
for their involvement in DNA DSB repair, telomeric maintenance and TPE. We show 
that TEL1, a gene required for telomeric length maintenance, is not required for 
either DNA DSB repair or TPE. However, RAD50, MRE11 and XRS2 function both in 
Ku-dependent DNA DSB repair and in telomeric length maintenance, although they 
have no major effects on TPE. These data provide important insights into DNA DSB 
repair and the linkage of this process to telomere length homeostasis and 
transcriptional silencing.
