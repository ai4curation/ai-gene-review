p53 induces apoptosis by target gene regulation and transcription-independent 
signaling. However, a mechanism for the latter was unknown. We recently reported 
that a fraction of induced p53 translocates to the mitochondria of apoptosing 
tumor cells. Targeting p53 to mitochondria is sufficient to launch apoptosis. 
Here, we provide evidence that p53 translocation to the mitochondria occurs in 
vivo in irradiated thymocytes. Further, we show that the p53 protein can 
directly induce permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming 
complexes with the protective BclXL and Bcl2 proteins, resulting in cytochrome c 
release. p53 binds to BclXL via its DNA binding domain. We probe the 
significance of mitochondrial p53 and show that tumor-derived 
transactivation-deficient mutants of p53 concomitantly lose the ability to 
interact with BclXL and promote cytochrome c release. This opens the possibility 
that mutations might represent "double-hits" by abrogating the transcriptional 
and mitochondrial apoptotic activity of p53.
