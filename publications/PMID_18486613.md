Identification of pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) interacting partners 
may reveal new molecular mechanisms of PBEF in the pathogenesis of acute lung 
injury (ALI). The interactions between PBEF and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 
1(ND1), ferritin light chain and interferon induced transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) in 
human pulmonary vascular endothelial cells were identified and validated. ND1, 
ferritin and IFITM3 are involved in oxidative stress and inflammation. 
Overexpression of PBEF increased its interactions and intracellular oxidative 
stress, which can be attenuated by rotenone. The interaction modeling between 
PBEF and ND1 is consistent with the corresponding experimental finding. These 
interactions may underlie a novel role of PBEF in the pathogenesis of ALI.
