We screened radiation-sensitive yeast mutants for DNA damage checkpoint defects 
and identified Dot1, the conserved histone H3 Lys 79 methyltransferase. DOT1 
deletion mutants (dot1Delta) are G1 and intra-S phase checkpoint defective after 
ionizing radiation but remain competent for G2/M arrest. Mutations that affect 
Dot1 function such as Rad6-Bre1/Paf1 pathway gene deletions or mutation of H2B 
Lys 123 or H3 Lys 79 share dot1Delta checkpoint defects. Whereas dot1Delta alone 
confers minimal DNA damage sensitivity, combining dot1Delta with histone 
methyltransferase mutations set1Delta and set2Delta markedly enhances lethality. 
Interestingly, set1Delta and set2Delta mutants remain G1 checkpoint competent, 
but set1Delta displays a mild S phase checkpoint defect. In human cells, H3 Lys 
79 methylation by hDOT1L likely mediates recruitment of the signaling protein 
53BP1 via its paired tudor domains to double-strand breaks (DSBs). Consistent 
with this paradigm, loss of Dot1 prevents activation of the yeast 53BP1 ortholog 
Rad9 or Chk2 homolog Rad53 and decreases binding of Rad9 to DSBs after DNA 
damage. Mutation of Rad9 to alter tudor domain binding to methylated Lys 79 
phenocopies the dot1Delta checkpoint defect and blocks Rad53 phosphorylation. 
These results indicate a key role for chromatin and methylation of histone H3 
Lys 79 in yeast DNA damage signaling.
