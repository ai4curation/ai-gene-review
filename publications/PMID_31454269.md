BACKGROUND: CaM (calmodulin) mutations are associated with congenital arrhythmia 
susceptibility (calmodulinopathy) and are most often de novo. In this report, we 
sought to broaden the genotype-phenotype spectrum of calmodulinopathies with 2 
novel calmodulin mutations and to investigate mosaicism in 2 affected families.
METHODS: CaM mutations were identified in 4 independent cases by DNA sequencing. 
Biochemical and electrophysiological studies were performed to determine 
functional consequences of each mutation.
RESULTS: Genetic studies identified 2 novel CaM variants (CALM3-E141K in 2 
cases; CALM1-E141V) and one previously reported CaM pathogenic variant 
(CALM3-D130G) among 4 probands with shared clinical features of prolonged QTc 
interval (range 505-725 ms) and documented ventricular arrhythmia. A fatal 
outcome occurred for 2 of the cases. The parents of all probands were 
asymptomatic with normal QTc duration. However, 2 of the families had multiple 
affected offspring or multiple occurrences of intrauterine fetal demise. The 
mother from the family with recurrent intrauterine fetal demise exhibited the 
CALM3-E141K mutant allele in 25% of next-generation sequencing reads indicating 
somatic mosaicism, whereas CALM3-D130G was present in 6% of captured molecules 
of the paternal DNA sample, also indicating mosaicism. Two novel mutations 
(E141K and E141V) impaired Ca2+ binding affinity to the C-domain of CaM. 
Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes overexpressing mutant 
or wild-type CaM showed that both mutants impaired Ca2+-dependent inactivation 
of L-type Ca2+ channels and prolonged action potential duration.
CONCLUSIONS: We report 2 families with somatic mosaicism associated with 
arrhythmogenic calmodulinopathy, and demonstrate dysregulation of L-type Ca2+ 
channels by 2 novel CaM mutations affecting the same residue. Parental mosaicism 
should be suspected in families with unexplained fetal arrhythmia or fetal 
demise combined with a documented CaM mutation.

Methods

CaM mutations were identified in four independent cases by DNA sequencing. Biochemical and electrophysiological studies were performed to determine functional consequences of each mutation.

Results

Genetic studies identified two novel CaM variants ( CALM3 -E141K in two cases; CALM1 -E141V) and one previously reported CaM pathogenic variant ( CALM3 -D130G) among four probands with shared clinical features of prolonged QTc interval (range 505 – 725 ms) and documented ventricular arrhythmia. A fatal outcome occurred for two of the cases. The parents of all probands were asymptomatic with normal QTc duration. However, two of the families had multiple affected offspring or multiple occurrences of intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). The mother from the family with recurrent IUFD exhibited the CALM3 -E141K mutant allele in 25% of next-generation sequencing reads indicating somatic mosaicism, whereas CALM3 -D130G was present in 6% of captured molecules of the paternal DNA sample, also indicating mosaicism. Two novel mutations (E141K, E141V) impaired Ca 2+ binding affinity to the C-domain of CaM. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cardiomyocytes overexpressing mutant or WT CaM showed that both mutants impaired Ca 2+ -dependent inactivation (CDI) of L-type Ca 2+ channels (LTCC) and prolonged action potential duration.

Conclusions

We report two families with somatic mosaicism associated with arrhythmogenic calmodulinopathy, and demonstrate dysregulation of the LTCC by two novel CaM mutations affecting the same residue. Parental mosaicism should be suspected in families with unexplained fetal arrhythmia or fetal demise combined with a documented CaM mutation.

Introduction

Mutations in the Ca 2+ sensing protein calmodulin (CaM) are associated with a spectrum of severe congenital arrhythmia susceptibility referred to as calmodulinopathy. 1 – 10 A common clinical presentation associated with CaM mutations is long QT syndrome (LQTS), which significantly increases the likelihood of arrhythmic events and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young. Other clinical presentations of calmodulinopathy have included catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and sudden unexplained death. Most CaM mutations identified to date have been classified as de novo because the mutation is not detectable in the biological parents.

Calmodulin is a ubiquitously expressed protein that exhibits a high degree of evolutionary conservation. 11 There is also genomic redundancy within vertebrates as evidenced by the existence of three separate CaM genes ( CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 ) each encoding an identical 149 amino acid polypeptide. 12 CaM is composed of C-terminal and N-terminal domains, each with two Ca 2+ binding EF-hand motifs, which are connected by a flexible linker helix. 13 Most identified human CaM mutations affect residues within the 3 rd and 4 th EF-hands in the C-domain, and most replace highly conserved residues essential for Ca 2+ binding. Previous studies demonstrated that LQTS-associated CaM mutations cause impaired Ca 2+ binding to the C-domain, dysregulation of LTCC inactivation, and prolongation of cardiac action potentials in a variety of cardiac cellular models. 7 , 14 , 15 Elucidating genotype-phenotype correlations and a complete mutation spectrum are expected to improve diagnostic accuracy, and enable stratification of patients for the most appropriate and mechanistically-guided therapy.

In this study, we report two novel mutations affecting the same amino acid residue in CaM encoded by either CALM1 or CALM3 . These cases provide further evidence of genotype-phenotype correlation in LQTS-associated calmodulinopathy with mutations that impair CaM Ca 2+ binding affinity. Additionally, we report two families in which a pathogenic CaM mutation was inherited from a mosaic parent, which we believe are the first documented examples of mosaicism in calmodulinopathy. Recognizing mosaicism has important implications for family counseling in this disorder.

The study was approved by institutional review committees and the participants gave informed consent as follows. Genetic testing and review of medical records of Proband 1 was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital. Approval for investigating Probands 2 and 4 were obtained from the Unit of Biomedical Ethics Research Committee, King Abdulaziz University. The parents of Proband 3 gave written informed consent for molecular studies and research using a consent document approved by the IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano.

Discussion

In this study, we report two novel CaM mutations that affect the same amino acid residue in CaM but occur in two different genes. Both CALM3 -E141K and CALM1 -E141V cause impaired C-domain Ca 2+ binding in recombinant CaM proteins, and cause a pattern of LTCC dysfunction consistent with impaired CDI. This study provides further evidence of the effect of CaM dysfunction on human cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, and supports dysregulation of LTCC as a pathogenic mechanism in calmodulinopathy presenting with LQTS. Importantly, we also report evidence of parental somatic mosaicism in the families with CALM3 -E141K and CALM3 -D130G, and these findings have important implications for genetic counseling in the setting of unexplained fetal demise or multiple sudden unexplained deaths of young children in families with a pathogenic CaM mutation.

Calmodulin mutations are associated with a diversity of heart rhythm disorders, including LQTS, CPVT, idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death. We report novel mutations associated with the LQTS and sudden death phenotypes, and demonstrated parental somatic mosaicism in two families. Our findings expand the mutational spectrum and add to the emerging genotype-phenotype correlation in this severe congenital arrhythmia syndrome.
