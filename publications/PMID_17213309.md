Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is in a complex with WASP-interacting 
protein (WIP). WASP levels, but not mRNA levels, were severely diminished in T 
cells from WIP(-/-) mice and were increased by introduction of WIP in these 
cells. The WASP binding domain of WIP was shown to protect WASP from degradation 
by calpain in vitro. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and 
bortezomib increased WASP levels in T cells from WIP(-/-) mice and in T and B 
lymphocytes from two WAS patients with missense mutations (R86H and T45M) that 
disrupt WIP binding. The calpain inhibitor calpeptin increased WASP levels in 
activated T and B cells from the WASP patients, but not in primary T cells from 
the patients or from WIP(-/-) mice. Despite its ability to increase WASP levels 
proteasome inhibition did not correct the impaired IL-2 gene expression and low 
F-actin content in T cells from the R86H WAS patient. These results demonstrate 
that WIP stabilizes WASP and suggest that it may also be important for its 
function.
