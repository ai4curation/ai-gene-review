Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous protein that plays a critical role in 
regulating cellular functions by altering the activity of a large number of 
proteins, including the d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor 
(IP3R). CaM inhibits IP3 binding in both the presence and absence of Ca2+ and 
IP3-induced Ca2+ release in the presence of Ca2+. We have now mapped and 
characterized a Ca2+-independent CaM-binding site in the N-terminal part of the 
type 1 IP3R (IP3R1). This site could be responsible for the inhibitory effects 
of CaM on IP3 binding. We therefore expressed the N-terminal 581 amino acids of 
IP3R1 as a His-tagged recombinant protein, containing the functional IP3-binding 
pocket. We showed that CaM, both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, inhibited 
IP3 binding to this recombinant protein with an IC50 of approx. 2 microM. 
Deletion of the N-terminal 225 amino acids completely abolished the effects of 
both Ca2+ and CaM on IP3 binding. We mapped the Ca2+-independent CaM-binding 
site to a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the 
first 159 amino acids of IP3R1 and then made different synthetic peptides 
overlapping this region. We demonstrated that two synthetic peptides matching 
amino acids 49-81 and 106-128 bound CaM independently of Ca2+ and could reverse 
the inhibition of IP3 binding caused by CaM. This suggests that these sequences 
are components of a discontinuous Ca2+-independent CaM-binding domain, which is 
probably involved in the inhibition of IP3 binding by CaM.
