A new aspect of research into the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF) is a 
genetics-based search for ;modifier genes' that may affect the severity of CF 
lung disease. Using an alternative, cell biological approach, we show that ITPK1 
should be considered a modifier gene. ITPK1 synthesizes an intracellular signal, 
inositol (3,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate [Ins(3,4,5,6)P4]. A bio-activatable, 
cell-permeable analogue of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 inhibited Ca2+-dependent secretion of 
Cl- from polarized monolayers of immortalized mouse tracheal epithelial cells 
(MTEs). Analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography showed endogenous 
Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels in CF MTEs were approximately 60% below those in wild-type 
MTEs (P<0.03). This adaptation, which improves purinergic activation of 
Ca2+-dependent Cl- secretion in CF MTEs, was exceptionally specific; there was 
no effect upon the cellular levels of all the other inositol phosphate signals. 
Real-time PCR provided the explanation: the level of ITPK1 expression in 
wild-type MTEs was twice as high as that in CF MTEs (P<0.002). The biological 
impact of this differential gene expression is amplified by ITPK1 being 
concentrated at the apical membrane of MTEs, which we discovered following 
confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Compartmentalization of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 
synthesis adjacent to its site of action will enhance its regulatory capacity.
