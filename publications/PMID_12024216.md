Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating 
microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin 
is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant 
in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as 
neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes 
responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. 
Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions 
as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where 
it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex 
containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a 
global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases 
alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates 
alpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 
promotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated 
deacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. Our results show 
that HDAC6 is the tubulin deacetylase, and provide evidence that reversible 
acetylation regulates important biological processes beyond histone metabolism 
and gene transcription.
