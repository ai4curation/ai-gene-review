Hydrogen is a good energy vector, and its production from renewable sources is a 
requirement for its widespread use. [NiFeSe] hydrogenases (Hases) are attractive 
candidates for the biological production of hydrogen because they are capable of 
high production rates even in the presence of moderate amounts of O(2), 
lessening the requirements for anaerobic conditions. The three-dimensional 
structure of the [NiFeSe] Hase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough has 
been determined in its oxidised "as-isolated" form at 2.04-A resolution. 
Remarkably, this is the first structure of an oxidised Hase of the [NiFe] family 
that does not contain an oxide bridging ligand at the active site. Instead, an 
extra sulfur atom is observed binding Ni and Se, leading to a SeCys conformation 
that shields the NiFe site from contact with oxygen. This structure provides 
several insights that may explain the fast activation and O(2) tolerance of 
these enzymes.
