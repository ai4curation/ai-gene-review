The c-Myc and E2F transcription factors are among the most potent regulators of 
cell cycle progression in higher eukaryotes. This report describes the isolation 
of a novel, highly conserved 434 kDa protein, designated TRRAP, which interacts 
specifically with the c-Myc N terminus and has homology to the ATM/PI3-kinase 
family. TRRAP also interacts specifically with the E2F-1 transactivation domain. 
Expression of transdominant mutants of the TRRAP protein or antisense RNA blocks 
c-Myc- and E1A-mediated oncogenic transformation. These data suggest that TRRAP 
is an essential cofactor for both the c-Myc and E1A/E2F oncogenic transcription 
factor pathways.
