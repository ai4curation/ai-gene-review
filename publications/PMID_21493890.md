OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the role of 
dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) in degrading the endogenous 
nitric oxide synthase inhibitors asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) and 
N(g)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated a global-DDAH1 gene-deficient (DDAH1(-/-)) 
mouse strain to examine the role of DDAH1 in ADMA and l-NMMA degradation and the 
physiological consequences of loss of DDAH1. Plasma and tissue ADMA and L-NMMA 
levels in DDAH1(-/-) mice were several folds higher than in wild-type mice, but 
growth and development of these DDAH1(-/-) mice were similar to those of their 
wild-type littermates. Although the expression of DDAH2 was unaffected, DDAH 
activity was undetectable in all tissues tested. These findings indicate that 
DDAH1 is the critical enzyme for ADMA and L-NMMA degradation. Blood pressure was 
≈ 20 mm Hg higher in the DDAH1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice, but no other 
cardiovascular phenotype was found under unstressed conditions. Crossing 
DDAH1(+/-) male with DDAH1(+/-) female mice yielded DDAH1(+/+), DDAH1(+/-), and 
DDAH1(-/-) mice at the anticipated ratio of 1:2:1, indicating that DDAH1 is not 
required for embryonic development in this strain.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that DDAH1 is required for metabolizing ADMA 
and L-NMMA in vivo, whereas DDAH2 had no detectable role for degrading ADMA and 
l-NMMA.
