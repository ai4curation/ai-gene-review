The PML protein is best known for its role as a tumor suppressor for acute 
promyelocytic leukemia. Both PML and the key Wnt signaling regulator AXIN 
regulate p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage. However, how the two 
major tumor suppressors coordinate with each other is unknown, and the molecular 
components orchestrating the PML-induced apoptosis remain enigmatic. Here we 
show that AXIN interacts with PML in vivo, and further that AXIN, PML and p53 
form a ternary complex. Exposure to genotoxic signals including UV and 
doxorubicin induces AXIN to enter into the nucleus where it colocalizes with PML 
in the nuclear bodies. Domain-mapping experiments revealed that the C-terminal 
region (aa 597-832) of AXIN is responsible for its interaction with PML. AXIN 
fails to activate p53 in PML(-/-) cells, and conversely, PML is unable to 
activate p53 in AXIN-null SNU475 cells. Consistently, knockdown with respective 
siRNAs revealed that AXIN and PML depend on each other to elevate p53-Ser-46 
phosphorylation and to induce apoptosis after treatment with genotoxins. 
Moreover, we found that dominant-negative mutants of PML blocked AXIN-induced 
p53 activation, and that AXIN promotes PML sumoylation, a modification necessary 
for PML functions. Our finding has thus provided a new avenue for understanding 
the mechanism by which PML activates p53 and exerts its role as a tumor 
suppressor.
