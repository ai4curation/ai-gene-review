Loss of cell polarity is one of the initial alterations in the development of 
human epithelial cancers. Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) 
homologous adaptors 1 and 2 are membrane-associated proteins composed of two 
amino (N)-terminal PDZ domains and an ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding (EB) 
carboxyl (C)-terminal region. We describe here an intramolecular conformation of 
NHERF1/EBP50 (ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50) in which the C-terminal EB region 
binds to the PDZ2 domain. This novel head-to-tail conformation masked the 
interaction of both PDZ domains with PDZ domain-specific ligands, such as PTEN 
and beta-catenin. An EB region composite structure comprising an alpha-helix 
ending in a PDZ-binding motif imparted opposite effects to NHERF1 associations, 
mediating binding to ERM proteins and inhibiting binding of PDZ domain ligands. 
The PDZ domain inhibition was released by prior association of ezrin with the EB 
region, a condition that occurs in vivo and likely disrupts NHERF1 head-to-tail 
interaction. In contrast, NHERF2 did not present a regulatory mechanism for 
protein complex formation. Functionally, NHERF1 is required to organize 
complexes at the apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells. The regulation 
of NHERF1 interactions at the apical membrane thus appears to be a dynamic 
process that is important for maintaining epithelial-tissue integrity.

Abstract

Loss of cell polarity is one of the initial alterations in the development of human epithelial cancers. Na + /H + exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) homologous adaptors 1 and 2 are membrane-associated proteins composed of two amino (N)-terminal PDZ domains and an ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding (EB) carboxyl (C)-terminal region. We describe here an intramolecular conformation of NHERF1/EBP50 (ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50) in which the C-terminal EB region binds to the PDZ2 domain. This novel head-to-tail conformation masked the interaction of both PDZ domains with PDZ domain-specific ligands, such as PTEN and β-catenin. An EB region composite structure comprising an α-helix ending in a PDZ-binding motif imparted opposite effects to NHERF1 associations, mediating binding to ERM proteins and inhibiting binding of PDZ domain ligands. The PDZ domain inhibition was released by prior association of ezrin with the EB region, a condition that occurs in vivo and likely disrupts NHERF1 head-to-tail interaction. In contrast, NHERF2 did not present a regulatory mechanism for protein complex formation. Functionally, NHERF1 is required to organize complexes at the apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells. The regulation of NHERF1 interactions at the apical membrane thus appears to be a dynamic process that is important for maintaining epithelial-tissue integrity.

DISCUSSION

The regulated dynamics of association and dissociation of proteins in complexes is a topic of increasing importance, as defects of protein complex formation are responsible for many human pathological conditions, including cancer ( 27 , 28 ). As a consequence, many therapeutic efforts were recently directed toward the discovery of small molecules inhibiting protein complex formation in signaling pathways that are altered in cancer, the most notorious being the p53/Mdm2 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways ( 19 , 39 ). The study of adaptor proteins, formed only from modular domains mediating protein-protein interactions, is of particular interest in this respect. NHERF proteins emerged recently as critical adaptors in controlling epithelial-tissue polarity via interaction with ERM proteins ( 2 , 24 ), metabolic processes via interaction with transmembrane ion transporters ( 32 , 35 , 42 ), and cellular growth via interaction with growth factor receptors and tumor suppressor proteins ( 22 , 25 , 34 , 37 ). In this study, we found that NHERF1/EBP50 folds in a head-to-tail conformation that inhibits the interaction of its PDZ domains with ligands. Structurally, the intramolecular interaction took place between the NHERF1 PDZ2 domain and the EB region that ends in a PDZ motif, which was previously described as a consensus PDZ motif for NHERF PDZ domain binding ( 11 ). Predictably, this folding would engender competition for PDZ2 domain binding between the NHERF1 PDZ motif and the PDZ motifs of heterotypic ligands. Surprisingly, we found that the EB region masked not only the association of the PDZ2 domain with the PDZ2 domain-specific ligand β-catenin, but also the associations of the PDZ1 domain-specific ligands PTEN and PDGFRβ. Another peculiarity of this intramolecular folding was that although the PDZ motif was required for the homotypic interaction and to some extent for the masking of the PDZ domains, the most important structural element for PDZ domain masking was a C-terminal three-turn α-helix. This α-helix is the same structural element of the EB region that mediates binding to ERM proteins ( 38 ), and the PDZ motif is embedded in its last half-turn (Fig. 5A ). The folding of the NHERF1 PDZ motif thus appears to be unique compared to linear PDZ motifs in other proteins ( 5 ) (Fig. 5A ), and the nature or even the site of the intramolecular interaction with the PDZ2 domain may very likely be different from those characterizing a classical PDZ motif-PDZ domain interaction, such as the one between the β-catenin PDZ motif and the PDZ2 domain. Although we did not find direct interaction between the EB region and the PDZ1 domain, it is conceivable that PDZ1 participates in the stabilization of intramolecular folding, possibly by making contacts with the C-terminal α-helix or other EB elements. These contacts would be sufficient to mask the access of linear PDZ motifs to the NHERF1 PDZ1-binding groove ( 17 ), explaining the inhibition by the EB region of both PDZ domains' ligand binding. NHERF1 intramolecular folding appeared to inhibit PDZ domain association with PDZ motif-containing ligands and to slightly increase PDZ domain-mediated dimerization. This finding argued for different binding interfaces within NHERF PDZ domains for these distinct types of PDZ domain interactions, most likely as in the case of a GRIP1 PDZ6 domain that also engages in homodimerization ( 15 ). However, it also pointed out that a more complex structural change than just the PDZ-binding groove masking/unmasking takes place when NHERF1 switches from a “closed” to an “open” conformation. It appears that the open conformation, as induced by prior interaction with ezrin, would favor the interaction with PDZ ligands but not the dimerization. Along this line, we detected NHERF1 dimers containing ezrin only in very small amounts (Fig. 5A ). On the other hand, the subsequent interaction of NHERF1 PDZ domains with PDZ ligands might restore the dimerization ability, similarly to the intramolecular closed conformation. This possibility might explain the observed increase of NHERF1 dimerization by prior binding to C-terminal fragments of β2-adrenergic receptor and PDGFR ( 18 ).

Because of the involvement of the NHERF1 EB region in intramolecular folding, we reasoned that the engagement of this region by binding to ERM proteins would open the molecule and allow access by PDZ domain ligands. Accordingly, we characterized a mechanism for unmasking the PDZ domains by prior interaction of the NHERF1 EB region with ERM proteins (Fig. 7 ). Preincubation of NHERF1 with ezrin completely unmasked the PDZ domains for heterotypic ligand binding and allowed the assembly of various protein complexes containing both ezrin and PDZ domain ligands. In vitro, we could distinguish ternary complexes containing ezrin and one PDZ domain ligand that were bridged mainly by single NHERF1 molecules. In overlay assays, we could even show that NHERF1 prebound to ezrin could assemble PDZ domain ligands to both PDZ domains, most likely on single NHERF1 molecules (Fig. 5B ). This diversity of protein complexes triggered by a prior interaction between NHERF1 and ezrin suggested a possible model in vivo in which the high-affinity binding between NHERF1 and ERM proteins at the plasma membrane ( 24 , 26 , 29 ) would engender unmasking of NHERF1 PDZ domains and subsequent recruitment of intracellular ligands, such as PTEN or β-catenin, to the cortical compartment or strong binding of NHERF1 to transmembrane PDZ domain ligands, such as PDGFR, GPCRs, or ion transporters. In these cortical complexes, NHERF1 would regulate or stabilize its PDZ domain ligands ( 33 ). In support of this hypothesis, the presence of the EB region was found to be necessary for the regulation and membrane stabilization of transmembrane ion transporters and GPCRs by NHERF1 ( 21 , 36 , 41 ).

In contrast to NHERF1, NHERF2 interacted well with PDZ domain ligands, to an even greater degree than with ezrin. In the absence of ezrin prebinding, NHERF2 could assemble complexes containing PDZ domain ligands to extents similar to those of NHERF1 prebound to ezrin (Fig. 4B ). Furthermore, the ability of NHERF2 to form complexes was not enhanced by prior interaction with ezrin, suggesting that NHERF2 is in an “open” conformation and that the binding of ezrin does not regulate its ability to interact with PDZ domain ligands. A possibility explaining the difference in intramolecular folding between the NHERF proteins could be that the EB region of NHERF2, which differs by several residues from that of NHERF1 (Fig. 5B ), does not mask the PDZ domains. However, both EB regions were reported to form the C-terminal three-turn α-helix ( 38 ) that we showed to be necessary for PDZ domain masking, and the swapping of one or two residues from NHERF2 to the NHERF1 PDZ motif and α-helix did not unmask NHERF1 PDZ domains or change NHERF1 subcellular localization. Perhaps these changes were not sufficient to disrupt NHERF1 intramolecular folding, and a more extensive swap of the EB region might be necessary to achieve this effect. The fact that we did not detect binding between NHERF1 PDZ1-2 and NHERF2 constructs containing the whole EB region (Fig. 1D ) favors this possibility. Another possibility is that the conformations of the PDZ domains differ in the two proteins and NHERF2 PDZ domains are less prone to entail a head-to-tail interaction. We have previously shown that the PDZ domains of NHERF1 and NHERF2 are not equivalent and that ligands of the NHERF1 PDZ1 domain have higher affinity for the NHERF2 PDZ2 domain ( 37 ). Regardless of the affinities of individual PDZ domains for ligands, the difference in ligand accessibility to the PDZ domains and the possibility to regulate this accessibility in NHERF1 suggest important functional differences between the two NHERF proteins. While NHERF2 may constitutively interact with PDZ domain ligands, the controlled interaction of NHERF1 with PDZ domain ligands may implicate NHERF1 in more dynamic processes, such as trafficking.

Although intramolecular head-to-tail inhibitory conformations have been described for many molecules, including the ERM proteins ( 3 ), this is the first such folding involving PDZ domains. Because of the novel features of NHERF1 intramolecular interaction, most likely involving both PDZ domains and at least two structural elements of the EB region, solving the three-dimensional structure of the full-length molecule appears to be an important step in elucidating these interactions. Moreover, this approach will shed light on the mechanism of PDZ domain masking, providing important insights for the development of PDZ domain-blocking drugs for cancer therapy.
