The signal transduction mechanisms of the oxidative stress response in plants 
remain largely unexplored. Previously, increased levels of cellular hydrogen 
peroxide (H(2)O(2)) had been shown to drastically affect the plant 
transcriptome. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses allowed us to build a 
comprehensive inventory of H(2)O(2)-induced genes in plants. Here, the primary 
objective was to determine the subcellular localization of these genes and to 
assess potential trafficking during oxidative stress. After high-throughput 
cloning in Gateway-derived vectors, the subcellular localization of 49 proteins 
fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was identified in a transient assay 
in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) by means of agro-infiltration and confirmed 
for a selection of genes in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Whereas 
eight of the GFP-tagged proteins are exclusively localized in the nucleus, 23 
reside both in the nucleus and cytosol, in which several classes of known 
transcription factors and proteins of unknown function can be recognized. In 
this study, the mapping of the subcellular localization of H(2)O(2) -induced 
proteins paves the way for future research to unravel the H(2)O(2) responses in 
plants. Furthermore, the effect of increased H(2)O(2) levels on the subcellular 
localization of a subset of proteins was assessed.
