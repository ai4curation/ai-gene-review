Expression of the β-subunit (CaVβ) is required for normal function of cardiac 
L-type calcium channels, and its up-regulation is associated with heart failure. 
CaVβ binds to the α1 pore-forming subunit of L-type channels and augments 
calcium current density by facilitating channel opening and increasing the 
number of channels in the plasma membrane, by a poorly understood mechanism. 
Actin, a key component of the intracellular trafficking machinery, interacts 
with Src homology 3 domains in different proteins. Although CaVβ encompasses a 
highly conserved Src homology 3 domain, association with actin has not yet been 
explored. Here, using co-sedimentation assays and FRET experiments, we uncover a 
direct interaction between CaVβ and actin filaments. Consistently, 
single-molecule localization analysis reveals streaklike structures composed by 
CaVβ2 that distribute over several micrometers along actin filaments in HL-1 
cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of CaVβ2-N3 in HL-1 cells induces an increase in 
L-type current without altering voltage-dependent activation, thus reflecting an 
increased number of channels in the plasma membrane. CaVβ mediated L-type 
up-regulation, and CaVβ-actin association is prevented by disruption of the 
actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D. Our study reveals for the first time an 
interacting partner of CaVβ that is directly involved in vesicular trafficking. 
We propose a model in which CaVβ promotes anterograde trafficking of the L-type 
channels by anchoring them to actin filaments in their itinerary to the plasma 
membrane.
