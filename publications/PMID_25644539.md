AIMS: In this study, we sought to determine the role of ecto-nucleotidases and 
adenosine receptors in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). The expression of 
ecto-nucleotidases, which modify the levels of extracellular 
nucleotides/nucleosides, may control the mineralization of valve interstitial 
cells (VICs). We hypothesized that expression of ectonucleotide 
pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (NPP1), which generates AMP, and 
5'-nucleotidase (CD73), an enzyme using AMP as a substrate to produce adenosine, 
may co-regulate the mineralization of the aortic valve.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We have investigated the expression of NPP1 and 
5'-nucleotidase in CAVD tissues and determined the role of these 
ecto-nucleotidases on the mineralization of isolated VICs. In CAVD tissues 
(stenotic and sclerotic), we documented that NPP1 and 5'-nucleotidase were 
overexpressed by VICs. In isolated VICs, we found that mineralization induced by 
adenosine triphosphate was decreased by silencing NPP1 and 5'-nucleotidase, 
suggesting a role for adenosine. Adenosine and specific A2a adenosine receptor 
(A2aR) agonist increased the mineralization of VICs. Silencing of A2aR in human 
VICs and the use of A2aR(-/-) mouse VICs confirmed that A2aR promotes the 
mineralization of cells. Also, A2aR-mediated mineralization was negated by the 
transfection of a mutant dominant-negative Gαs vector. Through several lines of 
evidence, we next documented that adenosine stimulated the mineralization of 
VICs through a cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding protein 
(CREB) pathway, and found that CREB positively regulated the expression of NPP1 
in a positive feedback loop by physically interacting with the promoter.
CONCLUSION: Expression of NPP1 and 5'-nucleotidase by VICs promotes the 
mineralization of the aortic valve through A2aR and a cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway.
