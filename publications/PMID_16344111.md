Survivin is a fascinating little protein that acts as a component of the 
chromosomal passenger complex, which is essential for cell division, and as an 
inhibitor of apoptosis. With dual roles in promoting cell proliferation and 
preventing apoptosis, it is considered a protein that interfaces life and death. 
Interest in survivin has been fueled by its abundance in human cancers, where it 
has potential as a prognostic marker for cancer, and as a target for 
chemotherapy. Accordingly, since its discovery in 1997, publications on survivin 
have risen exponentially in basic and clinical fields alike. This review 
highlights the key advances in our understanding of the cellular function of 
this protein.
