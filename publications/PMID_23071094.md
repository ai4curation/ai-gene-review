The gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex 
in human myeloid cells is heterotetrameric, consisting of glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA 
synthetase (EPRS), NS1-associated protein 1 (NSAP1), ribosomal protein L13a, and 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The complex binds a structural 
GAIT element in the 3' untranslated region of VEGF-A and other 
inflammation-related transcripts and inhibits their translation. EPRS is dually 
phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Ser(886) and then by a 
Cdk5-dependent-AGC kinase at Ser(999); L13a is phosphorylated at Ser(77) by 
death-associated protein kinases DAPK and ZIPK. Because profound differences in 
inflammatory responses between mice and humans are known, we investigated the

lacking NSAP1. As in humans, IFN-γ activates the mouse macrophage GAIT system 
via induced phosphorylation of EPRS and L13a. Murine L13a is phosphorylated at 
Ser(77) by the DAPK-ZIPK cascade, but EPRS is phosphorylated only at Ser(999). 
Loss of EPRS Ser(886) phosphorylation prevents NSAP1 incorporation into the GAIT

Abstract

The gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex in human myeloid cells is heterotetrameric, consisting of glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), NS1-associated protein 1 (NSAP1), ribosomal protein L13a, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The complex binds a structural GAIT element in the 3′ untranslated region of VEGF-A and other inflammation-related transcripts and inhibits their translation. EPRS is dually phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Ser 886 and then by a Cdk5-dependent-AGC kinase at Ser 999 ; L13a is phosphorylated at Ser 77 by death-associated protein kinases DAPK and ZIPK. Because profound differences in inflammatory responses between mice and humans are known, we investigated the GAIT system in mouse macrophages. The murine GAIT complex is heterotrimeric, lacking NSAP1. As in humans, IFN-γ activates the mouse macrophage GAIT system via induced phosphorylation of EPRS and L13a. Murine L13a is phosphorylated at Ser 77 by the DAPK-ZIPK cascade, but EPRS is phosphorylated only at Ser 999 . Loss of EPRS Ser 886 phosphorylation prevents NSAP1 incorporation into the GAIT complex. However, the triad of Ser 999 -phosphorylated EPRS, Ser 77 -phosphorylated L13a, and GAPDH forms a functional GAIT complex that inhibits translation of GAIT target mRNAs. Thus, translational control by the heterotrimeric GAIT complex in mice exemplifies the distinctive species-specific responses of myeloid cells to inflammatory stimuli.

INTRODUCTION

Transcript-selective translation inhibition is an important posttranscriptional mechanism to regulate gene expression. It is generally mediated by the binding of a protein or complex (or noncoding RNA) to specific sequence or structural elements in the 5′ or 3′ untranslated region (UTR) ( 8 , 44 ). 3′ UTR-specific posttranscriptional mechanisms are particularly critical in regulating the expression of genes associated with inflammation ( 22 , 26 ). In human myeloid cells, the inflammatory cytokine gamma interferon (IFN-γ) induces the formation of a heterotetrameric, IFN- γ - a ctivated i nhibitor of t ranslation (GAIT) complex that binds a defined, split stem-loop GAIT element in the 3′ UTR of multiple inflammation-related mRNAs and inhibits their translation ( 26 ). Among the targets are vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), ceruloplasmin (Cp), death-associated protein kinases DAPK and ZIPK, and several chemokines and their receptors ( 26 , 43 ). The human GAIT complex is heterotetrameric, consisting of glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), NS1-associated protein 1 (NSAP1), ribosomal protein L13a, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) ( 37 ).

Recruitment of the four GAIT proteins and their assembly into GAIT complex is regulated by a network of IFN-γ-activated kinases. The human GAIT complex is assembled in two distinct stages. After about 2 to 4 h of IFN-γ treatment, EPRS is phosphorylated at two sites, first at Ser 886 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and subsequently at Ser 999 by a Cdk5-dependent AGC kinase ( 2 , 3 ). Both phosphorylation events occur in the noncatalytic linker domain that joins the functional ERS and PRS synthetases. Two-site Ser phosphorylation induces the release of EPRS from its residence in the tRNA multisynthetase complex (MSC). Free, phosphorylated EPRS binds NSAP1 to form the nonfunctional pre-GAIT complex that does not bind GAIT element RNA; EPRS Ser 886 phosphorylation is essential for NSAP1 interaction. About 12 to 16 h later, ribosomal protein L13a is phosphorylated at Ser 77 by a kinase cascade of DAPK and ZIPK ( 27 ). L13a phosphorylation induces its translocation from the 60S ribosomal subunit to join GAPDH and then the pre-GAIT complex to form the heterotetrameric GAIT complex that binds GAIT element RNA. Phosphorylation of EPRS at Ser 999 is critical for translational repression activity, as it facilitates the interaction of L13a in the RNA-bound GAIT complex with a eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF4G, of the translation initiation complex at or near the eIF3-binding site ( 3 , 15 ). This interaction blocks the recruitment of 40S ribosome-containing preinitiation complex, thereby inhibiting translation of GAIT element-bearing mRNA.

To date, the GAIT system has been investigated in detail in human cells only. To begin to understand how widespread the GAIT system is in vertebrates, we have investigated its presence and function in mouse myeloid cells. Mice have small genetic differences compared to humans, with only about 300 unique genes ( 23 ). Moreover, the primary sequences of the four human GAIT proteins are highly conserved in mice. Mice can be genetically manipulated and thus are oft-used models of human disease. Not surprisingly, mouse models are imperfect and differ from humans in several fundamental processes, including inflammation. For example, several inflammation-responsive genes in humans, such as the genes for interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 4 (MCP4), are absent in mice ( 23 ). Marked differences between mouse and human intestinal immunity have also been observed ( 9 ). Differences between humans and mice in both innate and acquired immunity are not surprising because the two species diverged about 65 million to 75 million years ago and inhabit very different environments with markedly dissimilar pathogenic challenges ( 23 , 33 ).

Previous work showed that cytosolic extracts from IFN-γ-activated mouse macrophages inhibit in vitro translation of a GAIT element-containing reporter, suggesting a functional GAIT pathway in murine macrophages ( 34 ). To unambiguously establish the activity of the GAIT pathway, its regulation, and the identity of its constituents, we investigated the GAIT system in murine macrophages. Here we report that IFN-γ activates GAIT-mediated translational silencing in mouse macrophages, with important similarities to and unexpected differences from activation in human macrophages. Unlike that in humans, the GAIT complex in mice is heterotrimeric and contains EPRS phosphorylated at Ser 999 but not at Ser 886 , Ser 77 -phosphorylated L13a, and GAPDH, but it is devoid of NSAP1.

DISCUSSION

Our results reveal important similarities and unexpected differences between the IFN-γ-induced GAIT systems in human and mouse myeloid cells. The human GAIT system is induced by two-site Ser phosphorylation in EPRS at Ser 886 by Cdk5 and Ser 999 by a cascade of Cdk5 and an unidentified AGC kinase ( 1 – 3 ). EPRS phosphorylation is followed by release from the MSC and interacts with NSAP1 to form the dimeric pre-GAIT complex ( Fig. 7 , top). Subsequent phosphorylation of L13a at Ser 77 by the DAPK-ZIPK cascade releases it from the 60S ribosomal subunit. Phosphorylated L13a binds GAPDH, and together they bind the pre-GAIT complex to form the heterotetrameric GAIT complex. The GAIT complex binds the 3′ UTR GAIT element in the target mRNA, and by a mechanism dependent on end-to-end interactions of the mRNA, P-L13a in GAIT complex interacts with eIF4G of the translation initiation complex, thereby blocking recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit and translation initiation. In mice, IFN-γ similarly activates the GAIT system via induced phosphorylation of EPRS and L13a ( Fig. 7 , bottom). However, mouse EPRS is subject to single-site phosphorylation at Ser 999 only. Despite the specific loss of the Ser 886 phosphosite in mouse EPRS, the Ser 886 kinase Cdk5 is required for activation of the AGC kinase that phosphorylates Ser 999 . The lack of Ser 886 phosphorylation prevents interaction with NSAP1 but permits release of EPRS from the MSC and joining with L13a and GAPDH to form a functional, heterotrimeric GAIT complex that binds GAIT element in target mRNAs and represses translation.

The absence of NSAP1 from the murine GAIT complex indicates that its function is secondary rather than essential in the human system. This concept was verified experimentally by the in vitro reconstitution of GAIT activity by the human (and mouse) EPRS linker with GAPDH and P-L13a ( Fig. 6B and C ). The function of NSAP1 in the human GAIT system has been investigated before ( 3 , 13 ). NSAP1 binding to human EPRS requires phosphorylation of Ser 886 in the spacer between the second (R2) and third (R3) of the three helix-turn-helix WHEP repeats (named after the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that contain them, i.e., Trp( W )RS, His( H )RS, and EP RS [ 12 , 41 ]) that populate the human and mouse EPRS linker domains ( Fig. 6A ). NSAP1 binding to human EPRS blocks the binding of GAIT element-bearing mRNA to the first (R1) and second (R2) WHEP repeats. The NSAP1-mediated inhibition is reversed by the subsequent interaction of P-L13a and GAPDH to EPRS that induces a conformational shift in the linker and exposes the RNA binding sites of EPRS. In view of the nearly 16-h residence in the cell before maturation as the GAIT complex, it is possible, if not likely, that the human pre-GAIT complex exhibits a GAIT-independent function. It is also possible that the human NSAP1-containing, pre-GAIT complex binds non-GAIT mRNA targets and affects a different function, for example, mRNA stability. This possibility is supported by reports of multiple RNA-related regulatory functions of NSAP1, also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) Q or synaptotagmin-binding cytoplasmic RNA interacting protein (SYNCRIP), including editing, splicing, stabilization, transport, surveillance by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation ( 4 – 6 , 11 , 17 , 25 , 29 ). Like the human pre-GAIT complex, mouse phospho-EPRS might exhibit GAIT-independent functions until joined by other constituents of the functional GAIT complex. Two important structural and functional differences distinguish the released murine phospho-EPRS from its human counterpart. First, the absence of NSAP1 binding to murine P-EPRS eliminates any role of the former in regulating the RNA-binding property of the latter. Second, unlike the human pre-GAIT complex, free murine P-EPRS can bind GAIT element-bearing target mRNAs, but it is unable to silence translation until P-L13a and GAPDH join to form the active trimeric complex. Free murine phospho-EPRS therefore could influence GAIT mRNA targets by GAIT-independent mechanisms, for example, by influencing mRNA stability or by binding to other, non-GAIT translational control complexes.

The absence of the Ser 886 phosphorylation site in mice is not particularly exceptional. Global alignment of orthologs of functional phosphorylation sites indicates that about 80% of phospho-Ser and -Thr sites are conserved in mammals, suggesting that phosphorylation sites are frequently gained or lost during evolution, most likely to direct species-specific activities ( 10 ). Conservation of the Ser 886 phosphosite in primates, rat, horse, and opossum (an early-appearing placental mammal) suggests that its absence in mice is due to a species-specific loss ( Fig. 3A ). Several differences between mouse and human phosphosites have been investigated. In one example, the Thr 157 phosphosite in human p27kip1 is not conserved in mice ( 28 ). Phosphorylation at this site has been implicated in protein-protein interactions and nuclear localization and is critical for regulation of cell cycle progression ( 24 , 40 , 42 ). Likewise, phosphorylation of Ser 216 in the dual-specificity protein phosphatase Cdc25C is essential for G 2 arrest after DNA damage but is absent in mice ( 19 , 30 ).

Expression patterns and functions of the vast majority of genes are common to humans and mice ( 16 ). However, 65 million to 75 million years of evolutionary divergence have introduced significant functional differences in both orthologous and paralogous genes in the two species ( 23 ). In fact, mitochondrial DNAs from museum skins of white-footed mice living in the same location from 1855 to the present exhibit surprisingly rapid microevolution ( 31 ). Multiple species-specific differences related to immune- or inflammation-related responses have been reported, driven in part by challenges to widely different pathogens in distinct ecological niches ( 23 , 39 ). Several examples involve differential responses to specific agonists and inflammatory challenges. For example, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is induced by IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharide in mouse but not in human macrophages ( 38 ). Also, in mice a higher concentration of endotoxin is required to induce an acute inflammatory response, e.g., induction of plasma interleukin-6 ( 7 ). More specifically, Toll-like receptors in murine macrophages trigger direct antimicrobial activity against intracellular bacteria compared to the indirect, vitamin D-dependent activation in human monocytes/macrophages ( 18 ). Important constitutive, stimulus-independent differences between the species have been reported. For example, human blood is neutrophil rich, whereas mouse blood is lymphocyte rich ( 23 ); moreover, only human neutrophils produce defensins ( 23 , 35 ). These species-specific differences in inflammatory responses are not just of evolutionary interest; they also profoundly affect the clinical applicability of therapeutic agents successfully tested in mouse models, e.g., in septic shock ( 20 , 32 , 39 ). Thus, it is neither exceptional nor surprising that the protein constituents and activation mechanisms of the GAIT system differ in mouse and human myeloid cells. It is also possible, if not likely, that the mRNA targets differ between species. Although VEGF-A is targeted in both species, secondary-structure analysis by Mfold suggests that the GAIT element is not conserved in mouse Cp ( 33 ). Our validation and characterization of the murine GAIT system lay a solid foundation for future in vivo studies. However, our results certainly recommend a cautious approach in extrapolating to humans the findings from genetic mouse models of defective or absent GAIT system components.
