Phytochromes are red/far-red light receptors that regulate various light 
responses by initiating the transcriptional cascades responsible for changing 
the expression patterns of 10-30% of the entire plant transcriptome. Several 
transcription factors that are thought to participate in this process have been 
identified, but the functional relationships among them have not yet been fully 
elucidated. Here we investigated the functional relationship between two such 
transcription factors, PIF3 and HY5, and their effects on anthocyanin 
biosynthesis. Our results revealed that PIF3 and HY5 do not regulate each other 
at either the transcriptional or the protein levels in continuous light 
conditions, suggesting that they are not directly linked within 
phytochrome-mediated signaling. We found that both PIF3 and HY5 positively 
regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis by activating the transcription of the same 
anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, but the positive effects of PIF3 required 
functional HY5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that both PIF3 
and HY5 regulate anthocyanin biosynthetic gene expression by directly binding to 
different regions of the gene promoters in vivo. Additional experiments revealed 
that PIF3 bound the promoters regardless of light and HY5. Collectively, these 
data show that PIF3 and HY5 regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis by simultaneously 
binding anthocyanin biosynthetic gene promoters at separate sequence elements.
