A sequence within the E2 domain of soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) 
stimulates iron efflux. This activity has been attributed to a ferroxidase 
activity suggested for this motif. We demonstrate that the stimulation of efflux 
supported by this peptide and by sAPPα is due to their stabilization of the 
ferrous iron exporter, ferroportin (Fpn), in the plasma membrane of human brain 
microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVEC). The peptide does not bind ferric iron 
explaining why it does not and thermodynamically cannot promote ferrous iron 
autoxidation. This peptide specifically pulls Fpn down from the plasma membrane 
of hBMVEC; based on these results, FTP, for ferroportin-targeting peptide, 
correctly identifies the function of this peptide. The data suggest that in 
stabilizing Fpn via the targeting due to the FTP sequence, sAPP will increase 
the flux of iron into the cerebral interstitium. This inference correlates with 
the observation of significant iron deposition in the amyloid plaques 
characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.
