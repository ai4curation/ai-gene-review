Evidence is accumulating that the adverse tumor microenvironment both modifies 
the malignant progression of tumor cells and contributes to chemotherapy and 
radiation resistance. We hypothesized that some of the effects on malignant 
progression are mediated through the transcriptional regulation of genes 
responsive to the stresses of the microenvironment, such as low oxygen or low 
glucose conditions. To determine epigenetic changes in gene expression that were 
consistent with that hypothesis, we used an in vitro subtractive hybridization 
method, representational difference analysis, to identify hypoxia-induced cDNAs 
from cultured human cervical epithelial cells. We identified 12 induced genes: 
two novel genes (HIG1 and HIG2), three genes known to be hypoxia-inducible 
(tissue factor, GAPDH, thioredoxin), and seven genes not previously identified 
as hypoxia-inducible [HNRNP(a1), ribosomal L7, annexin V, lipocortin 2, Ku(70), 
PRPP synthase, and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase]. In cultured cells, HIG1 and HIG2 
expression is induced by hypoxia and by glucose deprivation, but their 
expression is not induced by serum deprivation, UV, or ionizing radiation. The 
putative HIG1 and HIG2 open reading frames are expressed in cells, as confirmed 
by epitope tagging. In addition, tumor xenografts derived from human cervical 
cancer cells display increased expression of HIG1 and HIG2 when they are 
deprived of oxygen. Taken together, these data suggest a coordinated 
transcriptional response of eukaryotic cells to microenvironmental stresses 
found in the solid tumor.
