Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) inhibits growth factor signaling at the receptor level 
in microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC), and CD36 has been suggested to be 
involved in this inhibition, but the mechanisms are not known. We hypothesized 
that CD36-TSP-1 interaction recruits Src homology 2 domain-containing protein 
tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 to the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
2 (VEGFR2) signaling complex and attenuates vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) signaling. Western blots of anti-CD36 and anti-VEGFR2 immunoprecipitates 
from VEGF-treated MVEC showed that exposure of the cells to a recombinant 
protein containing the CD36 binding domain of thrombospondin-1 (known as the TSR 
domain) induced association of SHP-1 with the VEGFR2/CD36 signaling complex and 
thereby suppressed VEGFR2 phosphorylation. SHP-1 phosphatase activity was 
increased in immunoprecipitated VEGFR2 complexes from TSR-treated cells. 
Silencing CD36 expression in MVEC by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or genetic 
deletion of cd36 in mice showed that TSR-induced SHP-1/VEGFR2 complex formation 
required CD36 in vitro and in vivo. Silencing SHP-1 expression in MVEC by siRNA 
abrogated TSR-mediated inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation as well as 
TSR-mediated inhibition of VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and tube 
formation. These studies reveal a SHP-1-mediated antiangiogenic pathway induced 
by CD36-TSP-1 interaction that inhibits VEGFR2 signaling and they provide a 
novel target to modulate angiogenesis therapeutically.

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) inhibits growth factor signaling at the receptor level in microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC), and CD36 has been suggested to be involved in this inhibition, but the mechanisms are not known.

These studies reveal a SHP-1–mediated antiangiogenic pathway induced by CD36-TSP-1 interaction that inhibits VEGFR2 signaling and they provide a novel target to modulate angiogenesis therapeutically.

Introduction

CD36 is a multiligand scavenger receptor expressed on the surface of platelets, MVEC, mononuclear phagocytes, adipocytes, hepatocytes, myocytes, and some epithelia. 1 It was first identified as glycoprotein IV on platelets. 2 On MVEC, CD36 is a receptor for TSP-1 and related proteins containing the so-called “thrombospondin type I structural homology domain (TSR).” It functions as a negative regulator of angiogenesis 1 , 3 - 5 and therefore plays a role in tumor growth, inflammation, wound healing, and other pathological processes requiring neovascularization. 6 , 7 Binding of TSP-1 or TSR proteins to CD36 inhibits growth factor–induced proangiogenic signals that mediate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, and instead generates antiangiogenic signals that lead to apoptosis. 4 , 8 In vivo, CD36 null mice exhibit an increase in vessel density in the brain, an organ in which early angiogenesis is modulated by high levels of TSP-1, increased tumor angiogenesis in subcutaneously injected TSP-expressing tumor cells, and a lack of response to antiangiogenic effect of TSP-1 in in vivo angiogenesis assays. 8 , 9

It was recently shown that TSP-1 also inhibits growth factor signaling at the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) receptor level in endothelial cells and a mouse model. 10 - 12 In these studies, VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation and downstream Akt signaling were inhibited by pretreatment of cells with recombinant TSR. The studies showed that CD36 and VEGFR2 form a complex in MVEC, therefore suggesting that VEGFR2 dephosphorylation could be mediated by CD36. No direct evidence demonstrated a CD36 requirement in this inhibition, and the molecular mechanisms remain unclear.

CD36 modulates cell signaling in some cases by interacting with other receptors on the cell surface, including integrins, 11 , 13 , 14 tetraspanins, 13 and Toll-like receptors. 15 , 16 The 2 cytoplasmic domains of CD36 are very short, with no intrinsic kinase or phosphatase activity, but the carboxyl terminal domain has been shown to form a complex with intracellular signaling molecules, including Src family kinases and upstream mitogen-activated protein kinases. 1 , 8 , 17

Of the 3 known VEGF receptors, VEGFR2 is the primary mediator of angiogenic signaling. 18 There are several tyrosine residues on VEGFR2 that become phosphorylated upon VEGF exposure. Among these, Tyr1175 is the most important in angiogenesis. 19 Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 is regulated by members of the SHP family. 20 - 22 There are 2 members in this cytoplasmic phosphatase family: SHP-1 and SHP-2. Dephosphorylation of VEGFR2 Tyr1175 is mediated by SHP-1, but not by SHP-2. 21 , 23 Knockdown of SHP-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) promotes VEGF-mediated DNA synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and accelerates angiogenesis in a rat model. 20 , 21

Interestingly, our group recently showed that SHP-2 interacts with CD36 in macrophages and that its activity was modulated by the binding of oxidized low-density lipoprotein to CD36. 24 Whether SHP-1 interacts with CD36 is not known. In this paper, we used in vitro and in vivo assays to define a mechanism by which TSP-1 or recombinant TSR peptide suppresses VEGF signaling in MVEC via CD36 by regulating SHP-1 localization and activity. We found that TSR induced the association of SHP-1 with both CD36 and VEGFR2, and that in the presence of TSR, the addition of VEGF dramatically increased phosphatase activity associated with VEGFR2. Using siRNA gene silencing in cultured MVEC and genetic deletion in mice, we showed that CD36 was required for TSR-induced SHP-1/VEGFR2 complex formation and for TSR-mediated VEGFR2 dephosphorylation. By using SHP-1 siRNA and a pharmacologic inhibitor, we also showed that SHP-1 was required for dephosphorylation of VEGFR2, inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration, and in vitro tube formation by TSR. These studies establish that recruitment of SHP-1 to CD36-VEGFR2 complexes by CD36 interaction with TSP-1 plays a key role in CD36 antiangiogenic signaling in MVEC that is different from the previously well-described proapoptotic pathways mediated by Fyn and p38 MAP kinases. This study adds to the current understanding of the role of CD36 in angiogenesis and provides new insight into modulating angiogenesis.

Discussion

TSP-1 was identified as an angiogenesis inhibitor more than 20 years ago. 26 , 27 The mechanisms underlying this activity were initially demonstrated to involve a specific MVEC receptor, CD36, which generates antiangiogenic signals that lead to apoptosis in the presence of angiogenic growth factors. 4 , 8 An inhibitory effect of TSP-1 on VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation is a more recent observation, 10 although molecular mechanisms have not been identified. In this manuscript we defined 2 mechanistic components of the pathway. We used CD36 siRNA-transfected MVEC and cd36 null mice to provide evidence that CD36 is required for TSR-mediated VEGFR2 dephosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. We also found that the suppression of VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation by TSP-1 or TSR peptide was mediated by CD36-dependent recruitment of a specific phosphatase, SHP-1, to the VEGFR2 signaling complex.

CD36 was previously shown by Zhang et al to associate with VEGFR2 in cultured MVEC. 10 Similar to what was reported by this group, we also found that detection of the CD36-VEGFR2 interaction depended on the choice of detergent used to lyse the cells (data not shown), suggesting perhaps that the interaction occurs in specific membrane microdomains. 28 , 29 Here we report for the first time that the association of CD36 with VEGFR2 in vivo in murine lung has functional consequences with regard to VEGF response. Our in vivo finding that VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation was enhanced by genetic deletion of cd36 suggests that physiological levels of TSP-1 or other endogenous CD36 ligands normally dampen VEGF signaling. The concentration of TSP-1 and TSR required to dephosphorylate VEGFR2 phosphorylated by VEGF in MVEC is at the nanomolar level, well within the range of reported plasma concentrations of TSP-1. 30 Our results are also consistent with the observation that endogenous levels of TSP-1 were sufficient to inhibit VEGF-induced Akt phosphorylation in the mouse retina. 11

SHP-1 was reported to associate with VEGFR2 constitutively in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, 21 whereas in VEGFR2-transfected porcine aortic endothelial cells, the association required induction by VEGF. 31 In murine lung in vivo we now show that the association was CD36-dependent and induced by VEGF. In vitro in human MVEC, however, the association was neither constitutive nor induced by VEGF, but rather it was induced by TSR in a CD36-dependent manner. Unlike in vitro, endothelial cells in vivo are constantly exposed to low levels of VEGF and other TSR-containing proteins that could account for these differences. The association of SHP-1 with target proteins is mediated by the binding of its SH2 domain to phospho-tyrosine residues. It is possible that the multiple potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation on VEGFR2 that can be SHP-1 targets are differentially phosphorylated under basal conditions in endothelial cells from different sites so that some cells require VEGF stimulation to create a docking site, whereas others constitutively present a docking site. CD36 is not known to contain any phospho-tyrosine, but it does form a signaling complex with adaptor proteins, such as Vav, that could function in this regard. 32

Although other studies have shown by using siRNA that SHP-1 is the critical phosphatase that regulates VEGFR2 in endothelial cells, 20 , 21 we now show with an in vitro assay that phosphatase activity within the VEGFR2 complex was induced by VEGF and enhanced by TSR in a CD36-dependent manner. Although this is consistent with our data showing that TSR-induced association of SHP-1 with VEGFR2, we further demonstrated using siRNA that SHP-1 was required for TSR-mediated VEGFR2 dephosphorylation and contributed to the phosphatase activity within the VEGFR2 complex. The physiological relevance of these findings was shown with in vitro endothelial tube formation and migration assays, in which we demonstrated using both pharmacologic and genetic approaches that inhibition of VEGF signaling by TSR was mediated by CD36 and SHP-1. Although the SHP inhibitor blocks both SHP-1 and SHP-2 activity, 33 , 34 our data show that the association of SHP-2 was not affected by VEGF or TSR, and that SHP-2 did not contribute to TSR-induced VEGFR2 dephosphorylation or inhibition of migration in MVEC. Our work demonstrates, in vitro and in vivo, that CD36, SHP-1, and VEGFR2 are components of a ligand-dependent, detergent-sensitive, multiprotein complex. The precise molecular mechanisms mediating these protein-protein interactions remain to be determined, although previous studies show that the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD36 was sufficient to precipitate a signaling complex from macrophages. 35 Because Fyn kinase is known to function downstream of CD36 in MVEC proapoptotic responses to TSR, we also examined the role of this kinase in TSR regulation of VEGFR2 phosphorylation. Genetic and pharmacologic approaches showed that Fyn was not required, suggesting that the TSR/CD36-mediated proapoptotic signaling pathway differs from the SHP-1–mediated pathway that regulates VEGFR2 phosphorylation and MVEC migration and tube formation.

We also probed the role of Syk kinase in the TSR/CD36 pathway because it has been reported to phosphorylate VEGFR2 on Tyr1175 and it may function downstream of CD36. 36 Interestingly, we found by using both genetic and pharmacologic approaches that inhibition of Syk abrogated TSR/CD36-mediated inhibition of VEGF-induced MVEC migration but had no effect on VEGFR2 Tyr1175 phosphorylation. The latter result is different from that reported by Kazerounian et al 36 and is likely related to the use of a different inhibitor or maybe a different MVEC system. The discordance between inhibition of the TSR effect on migration and lack of TSR effect on VEGFR2 dephosphorylation could be related to the different kinetics of the assays. The phosphorylation studies assessed an acute (5 minutes) response to VEGF stimulation and are consistent with the abundant data showing that VEGFR2 Tyr1175 is auto-phosphorylated upon VEGF stimulation, 37 , 38 whereas the migration assays were carried out over many hours. We thus hypothesize that Syk activation by CD36 contributes to phosphorylation and activation of SHP-1 in the long-term inhibition of VEGF-induced cell migration by TSR. This model is consistent with known functions of the Syk homolog, ZAP70, which has been shown to interact with SHP-1 and enhance its phosphatase activity via phosphorylation of Tyr536 and Tyr564. 39 - 42

Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that CD36 signaling in macrophages in response to oxidized phospholipids results in downregulation of SHP-2 activity. 24 Mechanistically this was because of generation of intracellular oxidant stress and oxidative modification of a critical cysteine residue at the active site of the phosphatase. Endothelial cells signaling by TSR is fundamentally different because SHP-2 was not affected, yet SHP-1 activity was increased. This difference could be a result of the use of different CD36 ligands (TSR peptide vs oxidized phospholipid) and/or differences in downstream Src-family or mitogen-activated protein kinases in the different cell types.

In summary, we showed that binding of TSP-1 or TSR to CD36 suppressed VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation via CD36-dependent recruitment of SHP-1 phosphatase to the VEGFR2 signaling complex ( Figure 7 ). These studies identify a novel mechanistic regulatory pathway that could potentially be targeted to enhance or inhibit angiogenesis in a therapeutic context.
