To understand the role of the various components of TFIIH, a DNA 
repair/transcription factor, a yeast four-hybrid system was designed. When the 
ternary Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex composed of Cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1 
was used as bait, the xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) D helicase of transcription 
factor IIH (TFIIH), among other proteins, was identified as an interacting 
partner. Deletion mutant analyses demonstrated that the coiled-coil and the 
hydrophobic domains of MAT1 interlink the CAK complex directly with the 
N-terminal domain of XPD. Using immunoprecipitates from cells coinfected with 
baculoviruses, we further validated the bridging function of XPD, which anchors 
CAK to the core TFIIH. In addition we show that upon interaction with MAT1, CAK 
inhibits the helicase activity of XPD. This inhibition is overcome upon binding 
to p44, a subunit of the core TFIIH. It is not surprising that under these 
conditions some XPD mutations affect interactions not only with p44, but also 
with MAT1, thus preventing either the CAK inhibitory function within CAK.XPD 
and/or the role of CAK within TFIIH and, consequently, explaining the variety of 
the XP phenotypes.
