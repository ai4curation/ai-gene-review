A major pathway of mRNA turnover in eukaryotic cells initiates with 
deadenylation, leading to mRNA decapping and subsequent 5' to 3' exonuclease 
digestion. We show that a highly conserved member of the DEAD box family of 
helicases, Dhh1p, stimulates mRNA decapping in yeast. In dhh1delta mutants, 
mRNAs accumulate as deadenylated, capped species. Dhh1p's effects on decapping 
only occur on normal messages as nonsense-mediated decay still occurs in 
dhh1delta mutants. The role of Dhh1p in decapping appears to be direct, as Dhh1p 
physically interacts with several proteins involved in mRNA decapping including 
the decapping enzyme Dcp1p, as well as Lsm1p and Pat1p/Mrt1p, which function to 
enhance the decapping rate. Additional observations suggest Dhh1p functions to 
coordinate distinct steps in mRNA function and decay. Dhh1p also associates with 
Pop2p, a subunit of the mRNA deadenylase. In addition, genetic phenotypes 
suggest that Dhh1p also has a second biological function. Interestingly, Dhh1p 
homologs in others species function in maternal mRNA storage. This provides a 
novel link between the mechanisms of decapping and maternal mRNA translational 
repression.
