Human mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (the fourth enzyme of 
pyrimidine de novo synthesis) has been overproduced by means of a recombinant 
baculovirus that contained the human cDNA fragment for this protein. After virus 
infection and protein expression in Trichoplusia ni cells (BTI-Tn-5B1-4), the 
subcellular distribution of the recombinant dihydroorotate dehydrogenase was 
determined by two distinct enzyme-activity assays and by Western blot analysis 
with anti-(dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) Ig. The targeting of the recombinant 
protein to the mitochondria of the insect cells was verified. The activity of 
the recombinant enzyme in the mitochondria of infected cells was about 740-fold 
above the level of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in human liver mitochondria. In 
a three-step procedure, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase was purified to a specific 
activity of greater than 50 U/mg. Size-exclusion chromatography showed a 
molecular mass of 42 kDa and confirmed the existence of the fully active enzyme 
as a monomeric species. Fluorimetric cofactor analysis revealed the presence of 
FMN in recombinant dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. By kinetics analysis, Km values 
for dihydroorotate and ubiquinone-50 were found to be 4 microM and 9.9 microM, 
respectively, while Km values for dihydroorotate and decylubiquinone were 9.4 
microM and 13.7 microM, respectively. The applied expression system will allow 
preparation of large quantities of the enzyme for structure and function 
studies. Purified recombinant human dihytdroorotate dehydrogenase was tested for 
its sensitivity to a reported inhibitor A77 1726 (2-hydroxyethyliden-cyanoacetic 
acid 4-trifluoromethyl anilide), which is the active metabolite of the isoxazole 
derivative leflunomide [5-methyl-N-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-4-isoxazole 
carboximide]. An IC50 value of 1 microM was determined for A77 1726. Detailed 
kinetics experiments revealed uncompetitive inhibition with respect to 
dihydroorotate (Kiu = 0.94 microM) and non-competitive inhibition with respect 
to decylubiquinone (Kic = 1.09 microM, Kiu = 1.05 microM). These results suggest 
that the immunomodulating agent A77 1726 (currently in clinical phase III 
studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis) is a very good inhibitor of 
human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.
