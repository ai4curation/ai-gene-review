WHSC2, a novel gene recently isolated within the critical region of 
Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, is expressed in endothelial cells. WHSC2 is 
downregulated by HIV-1 Tat, whereas it is not modulated by angiogenic and 
pro-differentiative molecules. WHSC2 encodes a basic polypeptide of 528 amino 
acids. The in vitro translated protein shows a molecular weight of 57 kDa. WHSC2 
has two nuclear translocation sequences which actively mediate its transport to 
the nucleus, as shown in whsc2-GFP-transfected NIH-3T3. We also found a 
helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif in region 130-185. Since members of the HLH family 
control differentiation and cell cycle progression, we hypothesize that WHSC2 
may function as a transcriptional repressor.
