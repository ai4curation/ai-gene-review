Skp of Escherichia coli (OmpH of Salmonella typhimurium) is a protein whose 
precise function has been obscured by its ubiquity in a wide range of 
subcellular fractions such as those containing DNA, ribosomes, and outer 
membranes. Combining in vitro and in vivo techniques we show that Skp is 
synthesized as a larger precursor that is processed upon translocation across 
the plasma membrane. Translocation is dependent on the H(+)-gradient, ATP, SecA, 
and SecY. Upon cellular subfractionation (avoiding non-specific electrostatic 
interactions) Skp partitions with beta-lactamase into the fraction of soluble, 
periplasmic proteins. In the context of the export factor properties of Skp 
previously demonstrated in vitro it is conceivable that this protein is involved 
in the later steps of protein translocation across the plasma membrane and/or 
sorting to the outer membrane.
