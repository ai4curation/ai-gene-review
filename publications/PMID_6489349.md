Thrombospondin interactions with fibronectin and fibrinogen. Mutual inhibition 
in binding.

Lahav J, Lawler J, Gimbrone MA.

Thrombospondin synthesized and secreted by human endothelial cells in culture 
binds specifically to fibronectin immobilized on Sepharose beads. It can also 
bind to immobilized platelet-derived thrombospondin but not to immobilized 
gelatin or albumin. These interactions are not dependent on the presence of 
divalent cations or of other secreted materials. Purified platelet 
thrombospondin binds to fibronectin and fibrinogen immobilized on plastic 
surfaces with dissociation constants of 1.12 +/- 0.37 X 10(-7) M and 1.27 +/- 
0.41 X 10(-7) M respectively, and to thrombospondin immobilized on plastic with 
dissociation constant of 4.82 +/- 1.01 X 10(-7) M. The affinities of interaction 
are not significantly affected by removal of divalent cations. Soluble 
fibrinogen inhibits binding of thrombospondin to fibronectin regardless of which 
of the latter two is surface-bound. Thrombospondin-fibronectin interaction is 
also inhibited by soluble thrombospondin. The binding of soluble thrombospondin 
to surface-bound fibrinogen is inhibited both by soluble fibronectin and soluble 
fibrinogen. These results suggest that thrombospondin plays a role both in 
platelet-platelet aggregation and in platelet-substratum adhesion, and that it 
may also take part in the construction of the extracellular matrix.
