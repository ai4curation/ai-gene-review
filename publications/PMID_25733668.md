Iron is an essential metal cofactor that is required for many biological 
processes. Eukaryotic cells have consequently developed different strategies for 
its acquisition. Until now, Schizosaccharomyces pombe was known to use reductive 
iron uptake and siderophore-bound iron transport to scavenge iron from the 
environment. Here, we report the identification of a gene designated shu1(+) 
that encodes a protein that enables S. pombe to take up extracellular heme for 
cell growth. When iron levels are low, the transcription of shu1(+) is induced, 
although its expression is repressed when iron levels rise. The iron-dependent 
down-regulation of shu1(+) requires the GATA-type transcriptional repressor 
Fep1, which strongly associates with a proximal promoter region of shu1(+) in 
vivo in response to iron repletion. HA4-tagged Shu1 localizes to the plasma 
membrane in cells expressing a functional shu1(+)-HA4 allele. When heme 
biosynthesis is selectively blocked in mutated S. pombe cells, their ability to 
acquire exogenous hemin or the fluorescent heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin IX is 
dependent on the expression of Shu1. Further analysis by absorbance spectroscopy 
and hemin-agarose pulldown assays showed that Shu1 interacts with hemin, with a 
KD of ∼2.2 μm. Taken together, results reported here revealed that S. pombe 
possesses an unexpected pathway for heme assimilation, which may also serve as a 
source of iron for cell growth.

## Full Text

Background: Organisms have evolved diverse strategies to scavenge extracellular iron.

Results: The iron-regulated cell-surface Shu1 protein serves as a novel component for heme acquisition.

Conclusion: This study is the first report to show that a member of Archiascomycetes can acquire exogenous heme.

Significance: Shu1 is a noncanonical heme-binding protein possessing a unique role.

Iron is an essential metal cofactor that is required for many biological processes. Eukaryotic cells have consequently developed different strategies for its acquisition. Until now, Schizosaccharomyces pombe was known to use reductive iron uptake and siderophore-bound iron transport to scavenge iron from the environment. Here, we report the identification of a gene designated shu1+ that encodes a protein that enables S. pombe to take up extracellular heme for cell growth. When iron levels are low, the transcription of shu1+ is induced, although its expression is repressed when iron levels rise. The iron-dependent down-regulation of shu1+ requires the GATA-type transcriptional repressor Fep1, which strongly associates with a proximal promoter region of shu1+
in vivo in response to iron repletion. HA4-tagged Shu1 localizes to the plasma membrane in cells expressing a functional shu1+-HA4 allele. When heme biosynthesis is selectively blocked in mutated S. pombe cells, their ability to acquire exogenous hemin or the fluorescent heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin IX is dependent on the expression of Shu1.
