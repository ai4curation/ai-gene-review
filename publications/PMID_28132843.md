Ribosomes that experience terminal stalls during translation are resolved by 
ribosome-associated quality control (QC) pathways that oversee mRNA and nascent 
chain destruction and recycle ribosomal subunits. The proximal factors that 
sense stalled ribosomes and initiate mammalian ribosome-associated QC events 
remain undefined. We demonstrate that the ZNF598 ubiquitin ligase and the 40S 
ribosomal protein RACK1 help to resolve poly(A)-induced stalled ribosomes. They 
accomplish this by regulating distinct and overlapping regulatory 40S ribosomal 
ubiquitylation events. ZNF598 primarily mediates regulatory ubiquitylation of 
RPS10 and RPS20, whereas RACK1 regulates RPS2, RPS3, and RPS20 ubiquitylation. 
Gain or loss of ZNF598 function or mutations that block RPS10 or RPS20 
ubiquitylation result in defective resolution of stalled ribosomes and 
subsequent readthrough of poly(A)-containing stall sequences. Together, our 
results indicate that ZNF598, RACK1, and 40S regulatory ubiquitylation plays a 
pivotal role in mammalian ribosome-associated QC pathways.
