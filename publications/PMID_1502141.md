Full-length and truncated human BCL2 lacking the entire C-terminal hydrophobic 
domain have been overexpressed in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells with the 
baculovirus expression system. Immunoblot analysis with BCL2-specific antibodies 
revealed that both full-length and truncated BCL2 are expressed as multiple 
immunoreactive species, suggesting posttranslational modifications. The 
expression of the full-length but not the truncated BCL2 extended the survival 
of baculovirus-infected cells by preventing virus-induced DNA cleavage. This 
result is consistent with the reported protective effect of BCL2 against 
apoptosis in mammalian lymphocytes and suggests a conserved function in 
evolution. Subcellular fractionation and indirect immunofluorescence studies in 
intact cells demonstrated that the recombinant full-length and truncated BCL2 
proteins were expressed predominantly as nuclear membrane-associated proteins. 
These results imply that BCL2 must utilize hydrophobic domains other than the 
deleted domain for its association with the subcellular membranes. Metabolic 
labeling of insect cells expressing the full-length and the truncated form of 
BCL2 with 32P(i) demonstrated that BCL2 is a phosphoprotein.
