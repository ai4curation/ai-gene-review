Cdc10p is a major component of the cell cycle transcription factor complex MBF 
that controls G1-S phase specific gene expression in the fission yeast 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here, we describe the identification of a new binding 
partner to Cdc10p and Pol5p. Pol5p was discovered through a 2-hybrid screen, 
with the direct interaction confirmed by in vitro "pull-down" experiments with 
bacterially expressed proteins. Pol5p appears to have no role in cell cycle gene 
expression, but is instead required for rRNA production. Pol5p is an essential 
gene, expressed constitutively throughout both the mitotic and meiotic life 
cycles, and localises to the nucleus. Over-expressing Pol5p has no phenotype, 
but reducing levels of Pol5p inhibits rRNA production. Pol5p is shown to bind to 
rDNA promoter fragments. Potentially, we have identified a mechanism by which 
Cdc10p controls rDNA gene expression, therefore linking the cell cycle with 
cellular growth.
