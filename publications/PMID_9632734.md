The human ST5 gene encodes three proteins with predicted molecular masses of 
126, 82, and 70 kDa. These widely expressed proteins share a C-terminal region 
that bears significant sequence homology to a group of GDP/GTP exchange proteins 
for the Rab3 family of small GTP binding proteins. The N-terminal region of the 
largest ST5 protein, p126, contains two proline-rich sequences, PR1 and PR2, 
with consensus motifs similar to Src homology 3 (SH3) binding regions and to 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation sites. Based on these 
properties, we sought to investigate the activity of ST5 proteins in signal 
transduction pathways. In vitro, p126 displayed preferential binding to c-Abl 
SH3, as compared with other SH3 domains. This interaction was mediated by the 
PR2 sequence. In vivo, expression of p126, but not p82 or p70, activated 
MAPK/ERK2 in response to EGF in COS-7 cells. Expression of c-Abl with p126 
greatly enhanced this activity. Deletion of PR1 blocked the ability of p126 to 
activate ERK2. Deletion of PR2 did not affect the basal activity, but blocked 
the stimulatory effect of c-Abl. Whereas p82 expression had no effect on ERK2 
activation by p126, p70 completely abrogated this activity. These observations 
suggest that ST5 can function as a signaling protein and can provide a link 
between c-Abl and ERK2.
