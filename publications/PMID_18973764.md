Human ribosomal protein S3 (hRpS3) is a small ribosomal subunit showing 
apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity and has been suggested to play a role 
in the cellular DNA-damage response pathway. However, the functional 
interactions between hRpS3 and other base excision repair (BER) DNA glycosylases 
have not been reported. We identified, for the first time, the interaction 
between hRpS3 and human uracil-DNA glycosylase (hUNG) and investigated the 
functional consequences of this interaction. hRpS3 was shown to interact with 
hUNG in co-immunoprecipitation assay using transiently transfected HEK293 cells 
and GST pull-down assay using microbial expression systems. In an assay using a 
5'-end-radiolabeled 39-mer oligonucleotide duplex containing a U/G mismatch, 
hRpS3 dramatically stimulated the uracil-excision activity of hUNG, whereas 
hRpS3 alone had no cleavage activity. Pre-incubation of hRpS3 with the U/G 
mismatch containing DNA duplex also increased the hUNG uracil-excision activity; 
however, hRpS3 did not increase the DNA binding activity of hUNG in a trapping 
assay of hUNG and the U/G mismatch containing DNA duplex using UV cross-linking. 
hRpS3 has been suggested to stimulate the uracil-excision activity of hUNG by 
enhancing its dissociation from AP sites and increasing its turn-over rate. The 
disruption of hRpS3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA-hRpS3) transfection reduced 
the uracil-excision activity preserved in cell extracts, whereas the supplement 
of purified hRpS3 retained uracil-excision activity. These results strongly 
suggest that hRpS3 may be involved in the uracil-excision pathway, probably by 
participating in the DNA repair mechanism to remove uracil generated by the 
deamination of cytosine in DNA, and by preventing C/G-->T/A transition 
mutations.
