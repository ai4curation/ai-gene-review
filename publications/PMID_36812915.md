How exercise elicits systemic metabolic benefits in both muscles and 
non-contractile tissues is unclear. Autophagy is a stress-induced lysosomal 
degradation pathway that mediates protein and organelle turnover and metabolic 
adaptation. Exercise activates autophagy in not only contracting muscles but 
also non-contractile tissues including the liver. However, the role and 
mechanism of exercise-activated autophagy in non-contractile tissues remain 
mysterious. Here, we show that hepatic autophagy activation is essential for 
exercise-induced metabolic benefits. Plasma or serum from exercised mice is 
sufficient to activate autophagy in cells. By proteomic studies, we identify 
fibronectin (FN1), which was previously considered as an extracellular matrix 
protein, as an exercise-induced, muscle-secreted, autophagy-inducing circulating 
factor. Muscle-secreted FN1 mediates exercise-induced hepatic autophagy and 
systemic insulin sensitization via the hepatic receptor α5β1 integrin and the 
downstream IKKα/β-JNK1-BECN1 pathway. Thus, we demonstrate that hepatic 
autophagy activation drives exercise-induced metabolic benefits against diabetes 
via muscle-secreted soluble FN1 and hepatic α5β1 integrin signaling.
