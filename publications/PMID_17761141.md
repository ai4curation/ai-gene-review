The current study aimed to understand the anti-apoptotic effect of overexpressed 
gap junction forming protein connexin (Cx) 43 in C6 glioma cells. C6 cells 
exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or staurosporine demonstrated morphological 
and biochemical changes consistent with apoptosis, whereas C6 cells expressing 
Cx43 demonstrated relative resistance to H2O2, but not to staurosporine. This 
selective protection against H2O2 was due to inhibition of caspase-3 activation 
in Cx43 expressing cells. siRNA knockdown experiments in rat primary astrocytes 
confirmed the presence of endogenous Cx43-mediated anti-apoptotic effect. Cx43 
interacts with the upstream apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 known to 
mediate H2O2-induced apoptosis providing a possible mechanism for protection. 
These findings provided new evidence for regulation of the mitogen activated 
protein kinase pathway and apoptosis by Cx43 implicating this protein in 
intracellular signaling beyond its role as a gap junction forming protein on the 
plasma membrane.
