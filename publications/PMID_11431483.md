epsilon-N-Trimethyllysine hydroxylase (EC ) is the first enzyme in the 
biosynthetic pathway of l-carnitine and catalyzes the formation of 
beta-hydroxy-N-epsilon-trimethyllysine from epsilon-N-trimethyllysine, a 
reaction dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate, Fe(2+), and oxygen. We purified the 
enzyme from rat kidney and sequenced two internal peptides by 
quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. The peptide sequences were used to 
search the Expressed Sequence Tag data base, which led to the identification of 
a rat cDNA of 1218 base pairs encoding a polypeptide of 405 amino acids with a 
calculated molecular mass of 47.5 kDa. Using the rat sequence we also identified 
the homologous cDNAs from human and mouse. Heterologous expression of both the 
rat and human cDNAs in COS cells confirmed that they encode 
epsilon-N-trimethyllysine hydroxylase. Subcellular fractionation studies 
revealed that the rat enzyme is localized exclusively in mitochondria. 
Expression studies in yeast indicated that the rat enzyme is synthesized as a 
47.5-kDa precursor and subsequently processed to a mature protein of 43 kDa, 
presumably upon import in mitochondria. The Michaelis-Menten constants of the 
purified rat enzyme for trimethyllysine, alpha-ketoglutarate, and Fe(2+) were 
1.1 mm, 109 microm, and 54 microm, respectively. Both gel filtration and blue 
native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the native enzyme 
has a mass of approximately 87 kDa, indicating that in rat 
epsilon-N-trimethyllysine hydroxylase is a homodimer.
