The function of protein phosphatases with EF-hand domains (PPEF) in mammals is 
not known. Large-scale expression profiling experiments suggest that PPEF 
expression may correlate with stress protective responses, cell survival, 
growth, proliferation, or neoplastic transformation. Apoptosis signal regulating 
kinase-1 (ASK1) is a MAP kinase kinase kinase implicated in cancer, 
cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. ASK1 is activated by oxidative 
stress and induces pro-apoptotic or inflammatory signalling, largely via 
sustained activation of MAP kinases p38 and/or JNK. We identify human PPEF2 as a 
novel interacting partner and a negative regulator of ASK1. In COS-7 or HEK 293A 
cells treated with H(2)O(2), expression of PPEF2 abrogated sustained activation 
of p38 and one of the JNK p46 isoforms, and prevented ASK1-dependent caspase-3 
cleavage and activation. PPEF2 efficiently suppressed H(2)O(2)-induced 
activation of ASK1. Overexpessed as well as endogenous ASK1 
co-immunoprecipitated with PPEF2. PPEF2 was considerably more potent both as a 
suppressor of ASK1 activation and as its interacting partner as compared to 
protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), a well-known negative regulator of ASK1. PPEF2 was 
found to form complexes with endogenous Hsp70 and to a lesser extent Hsp90, 
which are also known interacting partners of PP5. These data identify, for the 
first time, a possible downstream signalling partner of a mammalian PPEF 
phosphatase, and suggest that, despite structural divergence, PPEF and PP5 
phosphatases may share common interacting partners and functions.
