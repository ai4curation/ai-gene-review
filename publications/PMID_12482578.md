Skeletal muscle nebulin is thought to determine thin filament length and 
regulate actomyosin interaction in a calcium/calmodulin or S100 sensitive 
manner. We have investigated the binding of nebulin SH3 with proline-rich 
peptides derived from the 28-mer PEVK modules of titin and the Z-line protein 
myopalladin, using fluorescence, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic 
resonance techniques. Of the six peptides studied, PR2 of titin (VPEKKAPVAPPK) 
and myopalladin MyoP2 (646VKEPPPVLAKPK657) bind to nebulin SH3 with micromolar 
affinity (approximately 31 and 3.4 microM, respectively), whereas the other four 
peptides bind weakly (>100 microM). Sequence analysis of titins reveals numerous 
SH3 binding motifs that are highly enriched in the PEVK segments of titin 
isoforms. Our findings suggest that titin PEVK and myopalladin may play 
signaling roles in targeting and orientating nebulin to the Z-line during 
sarcomere assembly.
