The tetraspanin web is composed of a network of tetraspanins and their partner 
proteins that facilitate cellular interactions and fusion events by an unknown 
mechanism. Our aim was to unravel the web partnership between the tetraspanin 
CD81 and CD19, a cell surface signaling molecule in B lymphocytes. We found that 
CD81 plays multiple roles in the processing, intracellular trafficking, and 
membrane functions of CD19. Surprisingly, these different roles are embodied in 
distinct CD81 domains, which function in the different cellular compartments: 
the N-terminal tail of CD81 has an effect on the glycosylation of CD19; the 
first transmembrane domain of CD81 is sufficient to support the exit of CD19 
from the endoplasmic reticulum, although the large extracellular loop (LEL) of 
CD81 associates physically with CD19 early during biosynthesis; and finally, the 
TM2 and TM3 domains of CD81 play a role in the transmission of signals initiated 
upon engagement of the LEL. The participation of distinct CD81 domains in varied 
functions may explain the pleiotropic effects of CD81 within the tetraspanin 
web.
