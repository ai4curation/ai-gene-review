FKHR is a member of the FOXO subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors, which 
are important targets for insulin and growth factor signaling. FKHR contains 
three predicted protein kinase B phosphorylation sites (Thr-24, Ser-256, and 
Ser-319) that are conserved in other FOXO proteins. We have reported that 
phosphorylation of Ser-256 is critical for the ability of insulin and 
insulin-like growth factors to suppress transactivation by FKHR (Guo, S., Rena, 
G., Cichy, S., He, X., Cohen, P., and Unterman, T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 
17184-17192) and for its exclusion from the nucleus (Rena, G., Prescott, A. R., 
Guo, S., Cohen, P., and Unterman, T. G. (2001) Biochem. J. 354, 605-612). 
Ser-256 is located in a basic region of the FKHR DNA binding domain where 
phosphorylation may have direct effects on DNA binding and/or nuclear targeting. 
Phosphorylation of Ser-256 may also be required for the phosphorylation of 
Thr-24 and Ser-319. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that basic 
residues in the FKHR DNA binding domain are critical for DNA binding and that 
Ser-256 phosphorylation alters binding activity. Ser-256 phosphorylation also is 
critical for regulating nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking; however, this effect 
requires Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. Transient transfection studies with 
reporter gene constructs in 293 cells reveal that the phosphorylation of Ser-256 
can inhibit the function of FKHR independent of Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. 
Studies with GFP(1) fusion proteins indicate that Ser-256 phosphorylation is 
critical for nuclear exclusion of FKHR. However, this effect is disrupted when 
Thr-24 and Ser-319 are replaced by alanine, indicating that nuclear exclusion of 
FKHR also requires Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. Gel shift and fluorescence 
anisotropy studies reveal that basic residues at the C-terminal end of the FKHR 
DBD are important for DNA binding, and the introduction of a negative charge at 
the site of Ser-256 limits binding activity. Binding is rapid and reversible, 
providing an opportunity for the phosphorylation of Ser-256 and subsequent 
phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319 and nuclear exclusion of FKHR.
