Abstract

The plant hormone ethylene plays important roles in growth and development. Ethylene is perceived by a family of membrane-bound receptors that actively repress ethylene responses. When the receptors bind ethylene, their signaling is shut off, activating responses. REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY ( RTE1 ) encodes a novel membrane protein conserved in plants and metazoans. Genetic analyses in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that RTE1 promotes the signaling state of the ethylene receptor ETR1 through the ETR1 N-terminal domain. RTE1 and ETR1 have been shown to co-localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in Arabidopsis . Here, we demonstrate a physical association of RTE1 and ETR1 using in vivo and in vitro methods. Interaction of RTE1 and ETR1 was revealed in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in a tobacco cell transient assay and in stably transformed Arabidopsis . The association was also observed using a truncated version of ETR1 comprising the N terminus (amino acids 1–349). Interaction of RTE1 and ETR1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from Arabidopsis . The interaction occurs with high affinity ( K d , 117 n m ) based on tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy using purified recombinant RTE1 and a tryptophan-less version of purified recombinant ETR1. An amino acid substitution (C161Y) in RTE1 that is known to confer an ETR1 loss-of-function phenotype correspondingly gives a nearly 12-fold increase in the dissociation constant ( K d , 1.38 μ m ). These findings indicate that a high affinity association of RTE1 and ETR1 is important in the regulation of ETR1.

Introduction

The gaseous plant hormone ethylene is important in regulating many aspects of growth and development, including fruit ripening, senescence, abscission, and stress responses ( 1 ). There are a number of known components in ethylene signaling that form a pathway starting with the perception of ethylene and leading to gene expression changes ( 2 , 3 ). Arabidopsis thaliana has five homologous ethylene receptors with sequence similarity to histidine protein kinase receptors ( 4 – 7 ). The receptors appear to be largely redundant in ethylene signaling, although the ETR1 ethylene receptor has a more predominant role ( 8 – 10 ). The N terminus of the ethylene receptors comprises an ethylene-binding domain ( 11 – 13 ) consisting of three membrane-spanning domains localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ( 14 – 16 ) and the Golgi apparatus ( 16 ). The cytosolic portion of the receptors exhibits histidine and/or serine/threonine protein kinase activity in vitro ( 17 , 18 ) and control of autokinase activity by ethylene was demonstrated by in vitro phosphorylation studies using purified full-length ETR1 ( 19 ). However, the molecular mechanism of ethylene receptor signaling is still unknown, particularly as protein kinase activity appears to be largely dispensable for ethylene receptor signaling ( 8 , 9 ).

The ethylene receptors are negative regulators of ethylene response, repressing responses in the absence of ethylene ( 10 , 20 ) with the N-terminal domain controlling the signaling state of the receptor ( 21 ). When ethylene is bound, a conformational change presumably occurs within the receptor to turn off its signaling. Dominant gain-of-function mutations in any of the receptor genes encode amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal domain that cause the receptor to signal constitutively, resulting in dominant ethylene insensitivity ( 21 ).

The ethylene receptors are disulfide-linked homodimers ( 12 , 22 , 23 ) and form higher order multimeric complexes through non-covalent interactions ( 15 , 23 , 24 ). The five Arabidopsis ethylene receptors can form both homomeric and heteromeric complexes ( 23 ), and protein-protein interactions have been detected for all possible receptor combinations ( 15 , 24 ). It is thought that higher order clustering allows for conformational changes within one receptor to be propagated to other receptors in the cluster, providing a mechanism for signal amplification.

The Arabidopsis REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY 1 ( RTE1 ) 2 gene is a positive regulator of ETR1 that was identified in a genetic screen for suppressors of the dominant etr1-2 receptor mutant ( 25 ). rte1 loss-of-function mutants display ethylene hypersensitivity similar to etr1 loss of function mutants. Interestingly, some dominant etr1 alleles, such as etr1-2 , are highly dependent on RTE1 to confer ethylene insensitivity, while other dominant etr1 alleles, such as etr1-1 , are largely or entirely RTE1 independent ( 26 ). All of these dominant alleles encode amino acid substitutions within the ETR1 N-terminal domain, leading to speculation that the basis for RTE1 dependence/independence may be related to the specific conformation of the ETR1 N terminus. Unexpectedly, RTE1 is highly specific for ETR1 and has no apparent role in the signaling of the four other Arabidopsis ethylene receptors ( 25 , 27 , 28 ).

RTE1 encodes a novel protein carrying two to four predicted transmembrane domains ( 25 ). RTE1 is highly conserved in plants and metazoans. Homologs all carry a domain of unknown function called DUF778, which is also found in some protists and fungi. The only functional insight into this protein family comes from ethylene signaling in plants, and the only known target of RTE1 action is the ETR1 ethylene receptor. The Arabidopsis genome carries a second copy of RTE1 , called RTE1-HOMOLOG ( RTH ), but RTH does not appear to play the same role as RTE1 in ethylene signaling. 3 Overexpression of a tomato RTE1 homolog, GREEN-RIPE , confers inhibition of tomato fruit ripening along with other ethylene-insensitive phenotypes ( 29 ). Likewise, RTE1 overexpression in Arabidopsis confers ethylene insensitivity ( 25 , 28 ). This insensitivity is partially blocked by an etr1 -null mutation, but is restored by expression of the ETR1 N terminus (residues 1–349), indicating that the ETR1 N terminus (residues 1–349) is the downstream target of RTE1 action ( 28 ).

RTE1 is found in the microsomal fraction 3 and co-localizes with ETR1 at the ER and Golgi apparatus ( 16 ). This report demonstrates a physical interaction of the RTE1 protein with the ETR1 receptor both in vivo and in vitro , examining the specificity of the interaction and the effects of rte1 and etr1 mutations. This work advances our understanding of RTE1 function and indicates that a physical association of RTE1 and the ETR1 receptor may be important for the regulation of ETR1 in ethylene signaling.

DISCUSSION

RTE1 is a novel protein conserved in plants and animals. In Arabidopsis , RTE1 negatively regulates ethylene signaling ( 25 ), but the molecular mechanism of this regulation is unknown. RTE1 and ETR1 are both transmembrane proteins that co-localize to the ER and Golgi apparatus ( 16 ). Genetic data suggest that RTE1 promotes the signaling state of the ETR1 ethylene receptor ( 26 ). Here, we demonstrate a physical association between RTE1 and ETR1 in vivo and in vitro . Our findings suggest that RTE1 action in ethylene signaling involves a direct interaction with ETR1.

We first detected association of RTE1 and ETR1 using BiFC in a transient assay in tobacco leaf epidermal cells. Subsequently, we detected the interaction in stably transformed Arabidopsis using both BiFC and co-IP. The BiFC signal was observed when the N terminus of RTE1 and the C terminus of ETR1 were fused to cYFP and nYFP, respectively. We had previously shown that fusing RFP and a 5xMyc epitope tag at these particular termini of RTE1 and ETR1, respectively, does not disrupt RTE1 or ETR1 function in Arabidopsis ( 16 ). The C terminus of ETR1 is very likely to be in the cytoplasm based on the topology of a melon ethylene receptor ( 43 ). RTE1 is predicted to have two to four transmembrane domains ( 25 ) but the membrane topology of RTE1 is unknown. We found that RTE1 lacks N -linked glycosylation, 3 precluding the use of N -linked glycosylation to determine the topology. Nevertheless, the positive BiFC signal produced by the combination of cYFP-RTE1 and ETR1-nYFP suggested that the N terminus of RTE1 lies on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is where the C terminus of ETR1 is believed to reside. Moreover, the subcellular pattern of the BiFC signal was comparable to that of GFP-tagged ETR1. In addition, we obtained a BiFC signal for cYFP-RTE1 paired with ETR1(1–349)-nYFP. ETR1(1–349) has been shown to have the same subcellular localization as wild-type ETR1 ( 14 ). This is consistent with genetic data that indicates RTE1 promotes ETR1 signaling via the ETR1 N terminus (residues 1–349) ( 28 ).

The in vivo molecular interaction of RTE1 and ETR1 was confirmed by co-IP in Arabidopsis , and the affinity of the interaction was examined by tryptophan fluorescence quenching measurements, using purified RTE1 and ETR1 proteins expressed in E. coli . Association in vitro occurred with high affinity, based on the determined K d value of ∼117 n m . This low K d value is indicative of a specific interaction, rather than a nonspecific interaction arising from hydrophobic interactions, and is comparable to that of other known, highly specific protein-protein interactions, such as NusB:S10 ( 46 ), the NusA:core RNA polymerase ( 47 ), Ras:Raf ( 48 ), and EGF:EGF receptor ( 49 ). This in vitro association suggests that the physical interaction of RTE1 and ETR1 does not require the presence of other plant proteins.

The rte1-1 mutation encodes a C161Y substitution and confers an ethylene hypersensitive phenotype similar to the etr1 loss-of-function phenotype. Significantly, we found that the rte1-1 mutation reduces the affinity of the molecular association of RTE1 with ETR1, in both BiFC and fluorescence spectroscopy. The dissociation constant for the in vitro association was nearly 12-fold higher for the recombinant RTE1-1 mutant protein compared with the recombinant RTE1 wild-type protein. Thus, the physical interaction of ETR1 with RTE1 appears to be required to maintain ETR1 function.

BiFC signals were observed for wild-type RTE1 and the two dominant gain-of function mutants, etr1-1 and etr1-2 , even though etr1-1 signaling is independent of RTE1 . This suggests that the RTE1 independence of the etr1-1 allele is not due to a loss of association between ETR1-1 and RTE1. Perhaps the particular conformation of ETR1-1, or an interacting protein, is the basis for its RTE1 independence.

Although genetic analysis indicates that RTE1 specifically acts on ETR1 and not on the other Arabidopsis ethylene receptors ( 25 , 27 , 28 ), we also detected a weak signal for cYFP-RTE1 paired with ERS1-nYFP, which suggests that RTE1 might interact to some extent with the ERS1 receptor. Given that ERS1 and ETR1 are likely to be in contact with each other in the ethylene receptor complex ( 23 ), it is conceivable that there was reconstitution of the BiFC signal based on close proximity of the YFP halves, or that there is actually a non-functional interaction of RTE1 and ERS1. The absence of detectable interaction between cYFP-RTH (the RTE1 homolog) and ETR1-nYFP is consistent with data suggesting that the RTE1 homolog, RTH, does not play the same role as RTE1 in ethylene signaling. 3

The physical association of RTE1 and ETR1 is consistent with the highly specific functional interaction of RTE1 and ETR1 that has been suggested by genetic analyses. RTE1 and ETR1 have possibly co-evolved, as implicated by their physical and functional association. This is interesting in light of the fact that RTE1 is present not only in plants, but is conserved in metazoans and some fungi. Because these other organisms are not known to encode ethylene receptors, RTE1 homologs might possess a more general conserved cellular function.
