The molecular chaperone complex Hsp90-p23 interacts with the rate-limiting 
catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT. Although their interactions are required 
for proper folding of nascent hTERT as well as the assembly of active 
telomerase, the precise role of the chaperone proteins in regulation of nuclear 
localization of hTERT remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that curcumin 
inhibits telomerase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner by decreasing 
the level of hTERT expression. Following curcumin treatment, we observed a clear 
accumulation of hTERT in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell. The 
curcumin-induced cytoplasmic retention of hTERT could be due to failure of 
nuclear import, and the resulting cytoplasmic hTERT protein was rapidly 
ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. We also report that curcumin 
treatment results in a substantial decrease in association of p23 and hTERT but 
does not affect the Hsp90 binding to hTERT. In contrast, the treatment of the 
Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin promotes dissociation of both Hsp90 and p23 
proteins from hTERT. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the 
interaction of the Hsp90-p23 complex with hTERT is critical for regulation of 
the nuclear localization of telomerase, and that down-regulation of hTERT by 
curcumin involves dissociating the binding of hTERT with p23. Thus, inhibition 
of nuclear translocation of hTERT by curcumin may provide new perspectives for 
regulation of telomerase activity during tumorigenic progression.
