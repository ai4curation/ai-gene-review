Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by cholinergic hypofunction, neuronal 
marker loss, and decreased nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) density from 
the cortex and hippocampus. alpha7 nAChRs expressed on cholinergic projection 
neurons and target regions have been implicated in neuroprotection against 
beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity and maintenance of the septohippocampal phenotype. 
We tested the role that alpha7 nAChRs perform in the etiology of early AD by 
genetically deleting the alpha7 nAChR subunit from the Tg2576 mouse model for AD 
and assessing animals for cognitive function and septohippocampal integrity. 
Thus, Tg2576 mice transgenic for mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
were crossed with alpha7 nAChR knock-out mice (A7KO) to render an animal with 
elevated Abeta in the absence of alpha7 nAChRs (A7KO-APP). We found that 
learning and memory deficits seen in 5-month-old APP mice are more severe in the 
A7KO-APP animals. Analyses of animals in early-stage preplaque cognitive decline 
revealed signs of neurodegeneration in A7KO-APP hippocampus as well as loss of 
cholinergic functionality in the basal forebrain and hippocampus. These changes 
occurred concomitant with the appearance of a dodecameric oligomer of Abeta that 
was absent from all other genotypic groups, generating the hypothesis that 
increased soluble oligomeric Abeta may underlie additional impairment of 
A7KO-APP cognitive function. Thus, alpha7 nAChRs in a mouse model for 
early-stage AD appear to serve a neuroprotective role through maintenance of the 
septohippocampal cholinergic phenotype and preservation of hippocampal integrity 
possibly through influences on Abeta accumulation and oligomerization.
