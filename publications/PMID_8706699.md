Reverse-phase HPLC was used to fractionate 40S ribosomal proteins from human 
placenta. Application of a C4 reverse-phase column allowed us to obtain 27 
well-resolved peaks. The protein composition of each chromatographic fraction 
was established by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
N-terminal sequencing. N-terminally blocked proteins were cleaved with 
endoproteinase Lys-C, and suitable peptides were sequenced. All sequences were 
compared with those of ribosomal proteins available from data bases. This 
allowed us to identify all proteins from the 40S human ribosomal subunit in the 
HPLC elution profile. By matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass 
spectrometry the masses of the 40S proteins were determined and checked for the 
presence of post-translational modifications. For several proteins differences 
to the deduced sequences and the calculated masses were found to be due to 
post-translational modifications.
