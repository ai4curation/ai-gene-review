Growth Hormone is essential for the regulation of growth and the homeostatic 
control of intermediary metabolism. GH actions are mediated by the Growth 
Hormone Receptor; a member of the cytokine receptor super family that signals 
chiefly through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Target tissue responsiveness to GH is 
under regulatory control to avoid excessive and off-target effects upon GHR 
activation. The suppressor of cytokine signalling 2 (SOCS) is a key regulator of 
GHR sensitivity. This is clearly shown in mice where the SOCS2 gene has been 
inactivated, which show 30-40% increase in body length, a phenotype that is 
dependent on endogenous GH secretion. SOCS2 is a GH-stimulated, STAT5b-regulated 
gene that acts in a negative feedback loop to downregulate GHR signalling. Since 
the biochemical basis for these actions is poorly understood, we studied the 
molecular function of SOCS2. We demonstrated that SOCS2 is part of a multimeric 
complex with intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity. Mutational analysis shows that 
the interaction with Elongin B/C controls SOCS2 protein turnover and affects its 
molecular activity. Increased GHR levels were observed in livers from SOCS2⁻/⁻ 
mice and in the absence of SOCS2 in in vitro experiments. We showed that SOCS2 
regulates cellular GHR levels through direct ubiquitination and in a 
proteasomally dependent manner. We also confirmed the importance of the SOCS-box 
for the proper function of SOCS2. Finally, we identified two phosphotyrosine 
residues in the GHR to be responsible for the interaction with SOCS2, but only 
Y487 to account for the effects of SOCS2. The demonstration that SOCS2 is an 
ubiquitin ligase for the GHR unveils the molecular basis for its physiological 
actions.
