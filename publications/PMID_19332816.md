The GerD protein of Bacillus subtilis is required for efficient spore 
germination in l-alanine, and for germination in the alternative germinant 
combination of amino acids plus sugars. Only germination via nutrient receptors 
is affected in the mutant. The GerD protein is predicted to be a lipoprotein 
that is produced in the forespore compartment of the sporulating cell. Using 
antibody raised against the GerD protein, Western blots of proteins from spore 
fractions revealed that, as might be expected, the protein was detected in the 
inner membrane of spores, but it was also present at a high level in spore 
integuments (comprising coat, cortex and germ cell wall layers), and to some 
extent in the soluble fraction. It is likely that the GerD protein in the outer 
layers of dormant spores is located in the germ cell wall, as it was detected in 
coat-defective spores, and in the cell wall fraction of cells that were 
outgrowing from spores. Which of the multiple locations of GerD is important for 
its function is not known, but the inner membrane association would be 
appropriate for any interaction with germinant receptor proteins or SleB cortex 
lytic enzyme. Substitution of alanine for cysteine in the conserved cleavage 
site of the predicted prelipoprotein signal sequence of GerD resulted in mutant 
spores that lacked the GerD protein entirely.
