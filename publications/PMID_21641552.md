Rapid regulation of oxidative phosphorylation is crucial for mitochondrial 
adaptation to swift changes in fuels availability and energy demands. An 
intramitochondrial signaling pathway regulates cytochrome oxidase (COX), the 
terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain, through reversible phosphorylation. We 
find that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of a COX subunit dictates mammalian 
mitochondrial energy fluxes and identify the specific residue (S58) of COX 
subunit IV-1 (COXIV-1) that is involved in this mechanism of metabolic 
regulation. Using protein mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and 
induced fit docking, we show that mitochondrial energy metabolism regulation by 
phosphorylation of COXIV-1 is coupled with prevention of COX allosteric 
inhibition by ATP. This regulatory mechanism is essential for efficient 
oxidative metabolism and cell survival. We propose that S58 COXIV-1 
phosphorylation has evolved as a metabolic switch that allows mammalian 
mitochondria to rapidly toggle between energy utilization and energy storage.
