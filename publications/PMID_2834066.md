Evidence is presented that the E. coli secB gene encodes a soluble protein that 
interacts with the mature region of the precursor maltose-binding protein (MBP), 
and promotes MBP export by preventing premature folding of the newly synthesized 
polypeptide into an export-incompetent form. The interaction of SecB with MBP 
was indicated by the finding that synthesis of various export-defective MBP 
species interfered with normal protein export by limiting SecB availability. The 
antifolding activity of SecB was demonstrated by the following: the defect in 
MBP export in SecB- cells was suppressed by mutational alterations affecting MBP 
folding; export of a mutant MBP that is accomplished in a strictly 
posttranslational mode was totally blocked in SecB- cells; and the rate of 
folding of wild-type MBP synthesized in vitro was found to be accelerated when 
SecB was absent and greatly retarded when excess SecB was present.
