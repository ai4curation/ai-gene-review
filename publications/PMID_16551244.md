Within the paradigm of the two-signal model of lymphocyte activation, the 
interest in costimulation has witnessed a remarkable emergence in the past few 
years with the discovery of a large array of molecules that can serve this role, 
including some with an inhibitory function. Interest has been further enhanced 
by the realization of these molecules' potential as targets to modulate clinical 
immune responses. Although the therapeutic translation of mechanistic knowledge 
in costimulatory molecules has been relatively straightforward, the capacity to 
target their inhibitory counterparts has remained limited. This limited capacity 
is particularly apparent in the case of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated 
antigen-4 (CTLA-4), a major negative regulator of T cell responses. Because 
there have been several previous comprehensive reviews on the function of this 
molecule, we focus here on the physiological implications of its structural 
features. Such an exercise may ultimately help us to design immunotherapeutic 
agents that target CTLA-4.
