Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) detect molecular signatures of microbes and 
initiate immune responses to infection. Prototypical PRRs such as Toll-like 
receptors (TLRs) signal via a conserved pathway to induce innate response genes. 
In contrast, the signaling pathways engaged by other classes of putative PRRs 
remain ill defined. Here, we demonstrate that the beta-glucan receptor Dectin-1, 
a yeast binding C type lectin known to synergize with TLR2 to induce TNF alpha 
and IL-12, can also promote synthesis of IL-2 and IL-10 through phosphorylation 
of the membrane proximal tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain and recruitment of 
Syk kinase. syk-/- dendritic cells (DCs) do not make IL-10 or IL-2 upon yeast 
stimulation but produce IL-12, indicating that the Dectin-1/Syk and 
Dectin-1/TLR2 pathways can operate independently. These results identify a novel 
signaling pathway involved in pattern recognition by C type lectins and suggest 
a potential role for Syk kinase in regulation of innate immunity.
