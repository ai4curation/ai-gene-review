Cullin-RING ligases (CRL) are ubiquitin E3 enzymes that bind substrates through 
variable substrate receptor proteins and are activated by attachment of the 
ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to the cullin subunit. DCNs are NEDD8 E3 ligases 
that promote neddylation. Mammalian cells express five DCN-like (DCNL) proteins 
but little is known about their specific functions or interaction partners. We 
found that DCNLs form stable stoichiometric complexes with CAND1 and cullins 
that can only be neddylated in the presence of a substrate adaptor. These 
CAND-cullin-DCNL complexes might represent 'reserve' CRLs that can be rapidly 
activated when needed. We further found that all DCNLs interact with most cullin 
subtypes, but that they are probably responsible for the neddylation of 
different subpopulations of any given cullin. This is consistent with the fact 
that the subcellular localization of DCNLs in tissue culture cells differs and 
that they show unique tissue-specific expression patterns in mice. Thus, the 
specificity between DCNL-type NEDD8 E3 enzymes and their cullin substrates is 
only apparent in well-defined physiological contexts and related to their 
subcellular distribution and restricted expression.
