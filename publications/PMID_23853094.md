Foxp3 is a transcription factor required for the development of regulatory T 
cells (Treg). Mice and humans with a loss of Foxp3 function suffer from 
uncontrolled autoimmunity and inflammatory disease. Expression of Foxp3 is 
necessary for the anti-inflammatory capacity of Treg, but whether Foxp3 activity 
is further subject to regulation by extracellular signals is unclear. The 
primary structure of Foxp3 contains four cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) motifs 
(Ser/Thr-Pro) within the N-terminal repressor domain, and we show that CDK2 can 
partner with cyclin E to phosphorylate Foxp3 at these sites. Consistent with our 
previous demonstration that CDK2 negatively regulates Treg function, we find 
that mutation of the serine or threonine at each CDK motif to alanine (S/T→A) 
results in enhanced Foxp3 protein stability in CD4(+) T cells. T cells 
expressing the S/T→A mutant of Foxp3 showed enhanced induction (e.g. CD25) and 
repression (e.g. IL2) of canonical Foxp3-responsive genes, exhibited an 
increased capacity to suppress conventional T cell proliferation in vitro, and 
were highly effective at ameliorating colitis in an in vivo model of 
inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicate that CDK2 negatively 
regulates the stability and activity of Foxp3 and implicate CDK-coupled receptor 
signal transduction in the control of regulatory T cell function and stability.
