The eponymous term nucleus of Edinger-Westphal (EW) has come to be used to 
describe two juxtaposed and somewhat intermingled cell groups of the midbrain 
that differ dramatically in their connectivity and neurochemistry. On one hand, 
the classically defined EW is the part of the oculomotor complex that is the 
source of the parasympathetic preganglionic motoneuron input to the ciliary 
ganglion (CG), through which it controls pupil constriction and lens 
accommodation. On the other hand, EW is applied to a population of centrally 
projecting neurons involved in sympathetic, consumptive, and stress-related 
functions. This terminology problem arose because the name EW has historically 
been applied to the most prominent cell collection above or between the somatic 
oculomotor nuclei (III), an assumption based on the known location of the 
preganglionic motoneurons in monkeys. However, in many mammals, the nucleus 
designated as EW is not made up of cholinergic, preganglionic motoneurons 
supplying the CG and instead contains neurons using peptides, such as urocortin 
1, with diverse central projections. As a result, the literature has become 
increasingly confusing. To resolve this problem, we suggest that the term EW be 
supplemented with terminology based on connectivity. Specifically, we recommend 
that 1) the cholinergic, preganglionic neurons supplying the CG be termed the 
Edinger-Westphal preganglionic (EWpg) population and 2) the centrally 
projecting, peptidergic neurons be termed the Edinger-Westphal centrally 
projecting (EWcp) population. The history of this nomenclature problem and the 
rationale for our solutions are discussed in this review.
