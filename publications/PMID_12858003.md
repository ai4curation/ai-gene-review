We review the significance of a network of proneural basic helix-loop-helix 
(bHLH) factors. Immunohistochemically, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) 
are positive for Mash1, one of the activator bHLHs, and non-PNECs such as Clara 
cells are positive for Hes1, one of the repressor bHLHs. Since mice deficient 
for the Mash1 gene do not possess PNEC and mice deficient for the Hes1 gene have 
many PNECs, it is suggested that a network of bHLHs work in cell fate 
determination of lung epithelium. Moreover, the Notch pathway could play a role 
in cell differentiation mechanisms in the lung because this signaling pathway 
has been reported to work in various tissues. PNECs have been reported to 
modulate various nonneoplastic human lung diseases. We demonstrate that PNECs in 
usual interstitial pneumonia and hASH1 (human homolog of Mash1) are upregulated 
in diseased lung tissues. Moreover, studies of small cell carcinoma and non- 
small cell carcinoma suggest that neuroendocrine differentiation could be 
regulated by hASH1. In non-small cell carcinoma, Hes1 and Notch signaling may 
have roles in maintaining cell differentiation. Thus, a network of bHLHs and 
Notch signaling are important in cell differentiation of normal and pathologic 
lung epithelial cells.
