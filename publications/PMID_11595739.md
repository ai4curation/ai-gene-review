The subunit that mediates binding of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 
to human DNA polymerase delta has not been clearly defined. We show that the 
third subunit of human DNA polymerase delta, p66, interacts with PCNA through a 
canonical PCNA-binding sequence located in its C terminus. Conversely, p66 
interacts with the domain-interconnecting loop of PCNA, a region previously 
shown to be important for DNA polymerase delta activity and for binding of the 
cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1). In accordance with this, a peptide containing 
the PCNA-binding domain of p21(Cip1) inhibited p66 binding to PCNA and the 
activity of native three-subunit DNA polymerase delta. Furthermore, pull-down 
assays showed that DNA polymerase delta requires p66 for interaction with PCNA. 
More importantly, only reconstituted three-subunit DNA polymerase delta 
displayed PCNA-dependent DNA replication that could be inhibited by the 
PCNA-binding domain of p21(Cip1). Direct participation of p66 in PCNA-dependent 
DNA replication in vivo is demonstrated by co-localization of p66 with PCNA and 
DNA polymerase delta within DNA replication foci. Finally, in vitro 
phosphorylation of p66 by cyclin-dependent kinases suggests that p66 activity 
may be subject to cell cycle-dependent regulation. These results suggest that 
p66 is the chief mediator of PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase 
delta.
