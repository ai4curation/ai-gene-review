cDNA encoding for carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT) of yeast S. cerevisiae was 
isolated by screening a yeast cDNA lambda gt11 library with antibody. The whole 
coding sequence was obtained from the cDNA and from a YEP 13 DNA clone 
identified using the cDNA as probe. The coding sequence consists of 670 
residues, which amounts to a molecular mass of 77,300 kDa. This cDNA was used 
successfully to disrupt the gene for the mitochondrial isoenzyme of CAT, which 
was shown by measuring the enzyme activity and by immunoblot. The 
acetylcarnitine content of these cells decreased significantly. A search in the 
PIR protein data base revealed that besides the known carnitine 
acyltransferases, choline acyltransferases are highly homologous to yeast CAT. 
The mitochondrial CAT-deficient (CAT-) cells were able to grow on different 
fermentable and nonfermentable carbon sources, even on acetate at the same rate 
as the parental strain. In contrast to these, 13C NMR studies revealed 
significant differences between parental and CAT- cells. In CAT-cells 
[3-13C]pyruvate was converted mainly to lactate and acetate, whereas in the 
parental cells alanine and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were found as 
the main products of pyruvate metabolism beside acetate. These results suggest 
diminished flux through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the absence of 
mitochondrial CAT in yeast cells.
