Notch signaling regulates many aspects of metazoan development and tissue 
renewal. Accordingly, the misregulation or loss of Notch signaling underlies a 
wide range of human disorders, from developmental syndromes to adult-onset 
diseases and cancer. Notch signaling is remarkably robust in most tissues even 
though each Notch molecule is irreversibly activated by proteolysis and signals 
only once without amplification by secondary messenger cascades. In this Review, 
we highlight recent studies in Notch signaling that reveal new molecular details 
about the regulation of ligand-mediated receptor activation, receptor 
proteolysis, and target selection.
