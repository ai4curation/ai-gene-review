From a large-scale screen using splicing microarrays and RT-PCR, we identified 
63 alternative splicing (AS) events that are coordinated in 3 distinct temporal 
patterns during mouse heart development. More than half of these splicing 
transitions are evolutionarily conserved between mouse and chicken. 
Computational analysis of the introns flanking these splicing events identified 
enriched and conserved motifs including binding sites for CUGBP and ETR-3-like 
factors (CELF), muscleblind-like (MBNL) and Fox proteins. We show that CELF 
proteins are down-regulated >10-fold during heart development, and MBNL1 protein 
is concomitantly up-regulated nearly 4-fold. Using transgenic and knockout mice, 
we show that reproducing the embryonic expression patterns for CUGBP1 and MBNL1 
in adult heart induces the embryonic splicing patterns for more than half of the 
developmentally regulated AS transitions. These findings indicate that CELF and 
MBNL proteins are determinative for a large subset of splicing transitions that 
occur during postnatal heart development.
