We identified a new protein containing the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain 
through tyrosine phosphoproteomics using epidermal growth factor-stimulated 
cells. The tandem PH domains of this protein can bind to mitochondria-specific 
phospholipid, cardiolipin or its dehydro product, phosphatidic acid; therefore, 
we have designated this protein as cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid-binding 
protein (CLPABP). In this study, we show that CLPABP is localized on the tubulin 
network and the mitochondrial surface in the granular form along with other 
proteins and RNA. The affinity of CLPABP to mitochondria is elevated depending 
on the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation. The CLPABP complex contains various 
proteins related to cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism. The unique subcellular 
localization of CLPABP requires its PH domains and a multifunctional protein, 
SF2p32, as its binding protein. The CLPABP granule also contains the cytochrome 
c transcript, which may be mediated by the RNA-binding protein HuR. 
Immunofluorescence staining reveals that the CLPABP granule is colocalized with 
cytochrome c and various ribosomal proteins that are present in the CLPABP 
complex. Therefore, the CLPABP RNA-protein complex may play a role in 
transporting cytochrome c mRNA and its translated product to the mitochondria.
