1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) damages dopaminergic neurons 
in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) as seen in Parkinson's disease. 
Here, we show that the pro-apoptotic protein Bax is highly expressed in the SNpc 
and that its ablation attenuates SNpc developmental neuronal apoptosis. In adult 
mice, there is an up-regulation of Bax in the SNpc after MPTP administration and 
a decrease in Bcl-2. These changes parallel MPTP-induced dopaminergic 
neurodegeneration. We also show that mutant mice lacking Bax are significantly 
more resistant to MPTP than their wild-type littermates. This study demonstrates 
that Bax plays a critical role in the MPTP neurotoxic process and suggests that 
targeting Bax may provide protective benefit in the treatment of Parkinson's 
disease.
