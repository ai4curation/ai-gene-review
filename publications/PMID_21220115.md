The shared cytokine receptor gp130 signals as a homodimer or heterodimer through 
activation of Janus kinases (Jaks) associated with the receptor intracellular 
domains. Here, we reconstitute, in parts and whole, the full-length gp130 
homodimer in complex with the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), its alpha receptor 
(IL-6Rα) and Jak1, for electron microscopy imaging. We find that the full-length 
gp130 homodimer complex has intimate interactions between the trans- and 
juxtamembrane segments of the two receptors, appearing to form a continuous 
connection between the extra- and intracellular regions. 2D averages and 3D 
reconstructions of full-length Jak1 reveal a three lobed structure comprising 
FERM-SH2, pseudokinase, and kinase modules possessing extensive intersegmental 
flexibility that likely facilitates allosteric activation. Single-particle 
imaging of the gp130/IL-6/IL-6Rα/Jak1 holocomplex shows Jak1 associated with the 
membrane proximal intracellular regions of gp130, abutting the would-be inner 
leaflet of the cell membrane. Jak1 association with gp130 is enhanced by the 
presence of a membrane environment.

The shared cytokine receptor gp130 signals as a homodimer or heterodimer through activation of Janus kinases (Jaks) associated with the receptor intracellular domains. Here we reconstitute, in parts and whole, the full-length gp130 homodimer in complex with the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), its alpha receptor (IL-6Rα) and Jak1, for electron microscopy imaging. We find that the full-length gp130 homodimer complex has intimate interactions between the trans- and juxtamembrane segments of the two receptors, appearing to rigidify the connection between the extra- and intracellular regions. 2D averages and 3D reconstructions of full-length Jak1 reveal a three-lobed structure comprised of FERM-SH2, pseudokinase and kinase modules possessing extensive inter-segmental flexibility that likely facilitates allosteric activation. Single-particle imaging of the gp130/IL-6/IL-6Rα/Jak1 holocomplex shows Jak1 associated with the membrane proximal intracellular regions of gp130, abutting the would-be inner leaflet of the cell membrane. Jak1 association with gp130 is enhanced by the presence of a membrane environment.
