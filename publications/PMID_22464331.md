Bromodomains (BRDs) are protein interaction modules that specifically recognize 
ε-N-lysine acetylation motifs, a key event in the reading process of epigenetic 
marks. The 61 BRDs in the human genome cluster into eight families based on 
structure/sequence similarity. Here, we present 29 high-resolution crystal 
structures, covering all BRD families. Comprehensive crossfamily structural 
analysis identifies conserved and family-specific structural features that are 
necessary for specific acetylation-dependent substrate recognition. Screening 
of more than 30 representative BRDs against systematic histone-peptide arrays 
identifies new BRD substrates and reveals a strong influence of flanking 
posttranslational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, 
suggesting that BRDs recognize combinations of marks rather than singly 
acetylated sequences. We further uncovered a structural mechanism for the 
simultaneous binding and recognition of diverse diacetyl-containing peptides by 
BRD4. These data provide a foundation for structure-based drug design of 
specific inhibitors for this emerging target family.
