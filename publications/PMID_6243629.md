Cluster of mrdA and mrdB genes responsible for the rod shape and mecillinam 
sensitivity of Escherichia coli.

Tamaki S, Matsuzawa H, Matsuhashi M.

Two closely linked genes, mrdA and mrdB, located at ca. 14.2 min on the 
Escherichia coli chromosomal linkage map, seen to be responsible for the normal 
rod shape and mecillinam sensitivity of E. coli. The product of mrdA was 
concluded to be penicillin-binding protein 2, because mrdA mutations caused 
formation of thermosensitive penicillin-binding protein 2. The product of the 
mrdB gene is unknown. At 42 degrees, C, mutation in either of these genes caused 
formation of spherical cells and mecillinam resistance. Both mutations was 
recessive, and complementation, as detected in +-/-+ meroheterodiploids having 
the wild-type phenotype, provided strong evidence that the two mutations are in 
different complementation groups. P1 transduction suggested that the most 
plausible gene order is leuS-mrdA-mrdB-lip. The rodA mutation reported 
previously seems to be similar to the mrdB murations, but the identities of the 
two have not yet been proven.
