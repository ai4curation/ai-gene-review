The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) functions as an 
ATPase and as a chloride channel. It has been hypothesized, on the basis of 
electrophysiological findings, that the catalytic activity of CFTR is tightly 
coupled to the opening and closing of the channel gate. In the present study, to 
determine the structural basis for the ATPase activity of CFTR, we assessed the 
effect of mutations within the "Walker A" consensus motifs on ATP hydrolysis by 
the purified, intact protein. Mutation of the lysine residue in the "Walker A" 
motif of either the first nucleotide binding fold (CFTRK464A) or the second 
nucleotide binding fold (CFTRK1250A) inhibited the ATPase activity of the 
purified intact CFTR protein significantly, by greater than 50%. This finding 
suggests that the two nucleotide binding folds of CFTR are functioning 
cooperatively in catalysis. However, the rate of channel gating was only 
significantly inhibited in one of these purified mutants, CFTRK1250A, suggesting 
that ATPase activity may not be tightly coupled to channel gating as previously 
hypothesized.

Abstract

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily that functions as an ATP-gated channel. Considerable progress has been made over the last years in the understanding of the molecular basis of the CFTR functions, as well as dysfunctions causing the common genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). This review provides a global overview of the theoretical studies that have been performed so far, especially molecular modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A special emphasis is placed on the CFTR-specific evolution of an ABC transporter framework towards a channel function, as well as on the understanding of the effects of disease-causing mutations and their specific modulation. This in silico work should help structure-based drug discovery and design, with a view to develop CFTR-specific pharmacotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of CF in the context of precision medicine.

Introduction

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein belongs to the large ABC superfamily, which is characterized by a typical ATP-binding cassette (ABC) [ 1 , 2 ]. This cassette, also designated as nucleotide binding domain (NBD), contains a number of specific sequences (the Walker A (P-loop) and Walker B motifs, the C-motif (also known as the signature sequence) and the A-, D-, Q- and H-loops). The vast majority of ABC proteins are transmembrane proteins, which function as ATP-dependent active transporters. Although the NBDs from ABC transporters share highly conserved structures, the membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) are much more diverse and thus form distinct families, distinguishing between importers and exporters.

CFTR, also called ABCC7, is a large protein comprising 1480 amino acids. It shares the typical and unique architecture of ABC exporters, referred to as the B-family ABC-exporter fold, which is made of two MSDs, each composed of six transmembrane helices and each followed by an NBD [ 3 , 4 ]. The two halves (MSD1–NBD1 and MSD2–NBD2) are fused together to produce a heterodimeric organization. The CFTR protein is however unique in the ABC superfamily as it is the only known member that functions as a channel and is not believed to mediate active transport [ 5 , 6 ]. The CFTR protein is indeed an ATP-gated chloride channel, the opening of which is directly linked to ATP-driven tight dimerization of the NBDs [ 7 , 8 ]. The CFTR protein also possesses a unique additional domain (~195 amino acids), called the regulatory (R) region, linking the two halves of the protein, as well as N-terminal and C-terminal extensions (~65 and 33 amino acids, respectively). The R region contains multiple phosphorylation sites, which are the target of Protein Kinase A (PKA) and Protein Kinase C (PKC), and control the gating and trafficking of the chloride channel [ 9 – 12 ]. Most importantly, mutations in the CFTR protein cause cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common lethal autosomal recessive diseases in the Caucasian population [ 13 – 15 ].

Hence, considerable research has been undertaken to understand the normal function of CFTR and how CF mutations cause CFTR dysfunctions, with the ultimate goal of developing specific therapies targeting the root cause of disease [ 16 ]. In particular, there have been tremendous efforts to characterize the experimental 3D structure of the full-length CFTR protein, which is however difficult to express at high levels, purify and reconstitute in an active form [ 17 ]. In addition to the difficulties generally encountered for crystallizing membrane proteins, CFTR certainly suffers from the high flexibility of its R domain, which is commonly described as intrinsically disordered and acts as a hub for phosphorylation-dependent intra- and inter-molecular interactions [ 18 ]. So far, published information about the full-length protein was limited to low-resolution 3D structures [ 17 , 19 – 24 ] and crystal structures at atomic resolution have only been obtained for individual NBDs, generally with the help of solubilizing mutations [ 25 – 29 ]. NMR studies have also been reported, focusing on the effects of perturbations (such as mutations and ligand binding), on the conformational fluctuations and interactions of isolated NBD1, as well as on the phosphorylation-dependent interaction landscape of the isolated NBD1 and R region [ 11 , 18 , 30 – 34 ]. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques have also been used to unveil structural changes occurring within the NBDs and the R region [ 35 – 37 ], as well as within detergent–CFTR complexes [ 38 ]. Detailed descriptions of most of these experimental studies have already been provided elsewhere (for reviews see [ 17 , 39 ]).

In this context, where critical experimental information is still missing, several theoretical studies have been performed in order to gain insight into the structure and dynamics of the CFTR channel. Molecular modelling studies have been performed to understand the complex, multi-domain architecture of the CFTR protein, some of which have been coupled to molecular dynamics simulations for refining the proposed models, evaluating their stability and investigating conformational changes. Several theoretical approaches have also specifically addressed the dynamics of the individual NBD1 domain, which is affected by the most common CF mutation (deletion of F508). In an interesting review published 2 years ago [ 40 ], Odolczyk and Zielenkiewicz have summarized most of these molecular modelling studies already performed at that time with a view to gain insight into various features of the CFTR protein, especially as regards its 3D structure, its dynamics and its interactions with partners, including drug-like compounds. In particular, they emphasized the importance of sequence alignments with various 3D protein templates (on which the relevance of the final CFTR models depends quite largely) and they critically discussed the major differences between the models obtained so far. Since then, there were only a few theoretical studies that have provided additional information about the general MSD:NBD assembly [ 41 – 43 ] and about the dynamics of the NBD1 domain in presence of several perturbations [ 44 ].

Here, we have thus made the choice to concentrate on the whole set of molecular modelling studies, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in light of specific features. Our first aim (see “ From ABC exporters to the CFTR ion channel ”) is to describe how theoretical studies, i.e. comparative modelling and MD simulations, allowed to gain insight into the CFTR protein 3D structure in terms of its specific evolution towards a channel function starting from an ABC-exporter framework. Next (“ Disease-causing mutations: prediction of their impact and searching for modulators ”), we also describe how these theoretical studies allowed estimation of the impact of disease-causing mutations, as well as prediction of potential 3D sites that can be targeted for correcting functional or folding defects. For the discussion of these different points, we took into account the CF literature (but obviously not in an exhaustive manner given its huge size) and combined our descriptions with numerous references to various experimental data that could provide support to the predictive studies or that were inspired by the modelling work. We believe that this last point is critical for assessing the quality of the theoretical studies, as the modelling of membrane proteins is generally a challenging task, due to the general low sequence identity observed with the templates used for modelling and the large conformational changes at play in the activity of such proteins.
