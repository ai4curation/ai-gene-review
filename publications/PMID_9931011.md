The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) functions as an 
ATPase and as a chloride channel. It has been hypothesized, on the basis of 
electrophysiological findings, that the catalytic activity of CFTR is tightly 
coupled to the opening and closing of the channel gate. In the present study, to 
determine the structural basis for the ATPase activity of CFTR, we assessed the 
effect of mutations within the "Walker A" consensus motifs on ATP hydrolysis by 
the purified, intact protein. Mutation of the lysine residue in the "Walker A" 
motif of either the first nucleotide binding fold (CFTRK464A) or the second 
nucleotide binding fold (CFTRK1250A) inhibited the ATPase activity of the 
purified intact CFTR protein significantly, by greater than 50%. This finding 
suggests that the two nucleotide binding folds of CFTR are functioning 
cooperatively in catalysis. However, the rate of channel gating was only 
significantly inhibited in one of these purified mutants, CFTRK1250A, suggesting 
that ATPase activity may not be tightly coupled to channel gating as previously 
hypothesized.
