Post-translational modification of forkhead family transcription factor, FoxO1, 
is an important regulatory mode for its diverse activities. FoxO1 is acetylated 
by HAT coactivators and its transcriptional activity is decreased via reduced 
DNA binding affinity. Here, we report that SET/TAF-Iβ inhibited p300-mediated 
FoxO1 acetylation in an INHAT domain-dependent manner. SET/TAF-Iβ interacted 
with FoxO1 and activated transcription of FoxO1 target gene, p21. Moreover, 
SET/TAF-Iβ inhibited acetylation of FoxO1 and increased p21 transcription 
induced by oxidative stress. Our results suggest that SET/TAF-Iβ inhibits FoxO1 
acetylation and activates its transcriptional activity toward p21.
