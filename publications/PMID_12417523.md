Mutations in the phosphotyrosine-binding domain protein ARH cause autosomal 
recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), an inherited form of hypercholesterolemia 
due to a tissue-specific defect in the removal of low density lipoproteins (LDL) 
from the circulation. LDL uptake by the LDL receptor (LDLR) is markedly reduced 
in the liver but is normal or only moderately impaired in cultured fibroblasts 
of ARH patients. To define the molecular mechanism underlying ARH we examined 
ARH mRNA and protein in fibroblasts and lymphocytes from six probands with 
different ARH mutations. None of the probands had detectable full-length ARH 
protein in fibroblasts or lymphoblasts. Five probands were homozygous for 
mutations that introduced premature termination codons. No relationship was 
apparent between the site of the mutation in ARH and the amount of mRNA. The 
only mutation identified in the remaining proband was a SINE VNTR Alu (SVA) 
retroposon insertion in intron 1, which was associated with no detectable ARH 
mRNA. (125)I-LDL degradation was normal in ARH fibroblasts, as previously 
reported. In contrast, LDLR function was markedly reduced in ARH lymphoblasts, 
despite a 2-fold increase in LDL cell surface binding in these cells. These data 
indicate that all ARH mutations characterized to date preclude the synthesis of 
full-length ARH and that ARH is required for normal LDLR function in lymphocytes 
and hepatocytes, but not in fibroblasts. Residual LDLR function in cells that do 
not require ARH may explain why ARH patients have lower plasma LDL levels than 
do patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who have no functional 
LDLRs.
