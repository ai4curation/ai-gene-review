The dimeric cell-surface glycoprotein CD8 is crucial to the positive selection 
of cytotoxic T cells in the thymus. The homodimer CD8alpha(alpha) or the 
heterodimer alpha beta stabilizes the interaction of the T-cell antigen receptor 
(TCR) with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I/peptide by binding to 
the class I molecule. Here we report the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution 
of a complex between CD8alpha(alpha) and the human MHC molecule HLA-A2, which is 
associated with peptide. CD8alpha(alpha) binds one HLA-A2/peptide molecule, 
interfacing with the alpha2 and alpha3 domains of HLA-A2 and also contacting 
beta2-microglobulin. A flexible loop of the alpha3 domain (residues 223-229) is 
clamped between the complementarity-determining region (CDR)-like loops of the 
two CD8 subunits in the classic manner of an antibody-antigen interaction, 
precluding the binding of a second MHC molecule. The position of the alpha3 
domain is different from that in uncomplexed HLA-A2, being most similar to that 
in the TCR/Tax/HLA-A2 complex, but no conformational change extends to the 
MHC/peptide surface presented for TCR recognition. Although these shifts in 
alpha3 may provide a synergistic modulation of affinity, the binding of CD8 to 
MHC is clearly consistent with an avidity-based contribution from CD8 to 
TCR-peptide-MHC interactions.
