Although polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys(29) of ubiquitin have been 
implicated in the targeting of certain substrates to proteasomes, the signaling 
properties of these chains are poorly understood. We previously described a 
ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) from erythroid cells that assembles 
polyubiquitin chains through either Lys(29) or Lys(48) of ubiquitin 
(Mastrandrea, L. D., You, J., Niles, E. G., and Pickart, C. M. (1999) J. Biol. 
Chem. 274, 27299-27306). Here we describe the purification of this E3 based on 
its affinity for a linear fusion of ubiquitin to the ubiquitin-conjugating 
enzyme UbcH5A. Among five major polypeptides in the affinity column eluate, the 
activity of interest was assigned to the product of a previously cloned human 
cDNA known as KIAA10 (Nomura, N., Miyajima, N., Sazuka, T., Tanaka, A., 
Kawarabayasi, Y., Sato, S., Nagase, T., Seki, N., Ishikawa, K., and Tabata, S. 
(1994) DNA Res. 1, 27-35). The KIAA10 protein is a member of the HECT 
(homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain family of E3s. These E3s share a 
conserved C-terminal (HECT) domain that functions in the catalysis of 
ubiquitination, while their divergent N-terminal domains function in cognate 
substrate binding (Huibregtse, J. M., Scheffner, M., Beaudenon, S., and Howley, 
P. M. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 2563-2567). Recombinant KIAA10 
catalyzed the assembly of both Lys(29)- and Lys(48)-linked polyubiquitin chains. 
Surprisingly, the C-terminal 428 residues of KIAA10 were both necessary and 
sufficient for this activity, suggesting that the ability to assemble 
polyubiquitin chains may be a general property of HECT domains. The N-terminal 
domain of KIAA10 interacted in vitro with purified 26 S proteasomes and with the 
isolated S2/Rpn1 subunit of the proteasome's 19 S regulatory complex, suggesting 
that the N-terminal domains of HECT E3s may function in proteasome binding as 
well as substrate binding.
