Embedded in the nuclear envelope, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) not only 
regulate nuclear transport but also interface with transcriptionally active 
euchromatin, largely silenced heterochromatin, as well as the boundaries between 
these regions. It is unclear what functional role NPCs play in establishing or 
maintaining these distinct chromatin domains. We report that the yeast NPC 
protein Nup170p interacts with regions of the genome that contain ribosomal 
protein and subtelomeric genes, where it functions in nucleosome positioning and 
as a repressor of transcription. We show that the role of Nup170p in 
subtelomeric gene silencing is linked to its association with the RSC 
chromatin-remodeling complex and the silencing factor Sir4p, and that the 
binding of Nup170p and Sir4p to subtelomeric chromatin is cooperative and 
necessary for the association of telomeres with the nuclear envelope. Our 
results establish the NPC as an active participant in silencing and the 
formation of peripheral heterochromatin.
