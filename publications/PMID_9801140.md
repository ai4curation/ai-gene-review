The heat shock factor (HSF1) is the central regulator of the heat stress (hs) 
response and is required for stimulating the transcription of the hs genes and 
consequently the expression of heat shock proteins. To promote the polymerase 
II-dependent transcription of the hs genes, HSF has to communicate with the 
basal transcription machinery. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana 
HSF1 interacts directly with TBP, the general TATA box binding transcription 
factor, as shown by affinity chromatography and electrophoretic mobility shift 
analyses in vitro. An in vivo interaction between AtHSF1 and AtTBP1 was 
suggested by results employing the yeast two-hybrid system.
