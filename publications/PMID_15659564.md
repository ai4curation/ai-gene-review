Nephronophthisis (NPHP), an autosomal-recessive cystic kidney disease, is the 
most frequent genetic cause of end-stage renal failure in children. NPHP types 1 
and 4 are caused by mutations in NPHP1 and NPHP4, encoding the proteins 
nephrocystin-1 and nephrocystin-4, respectively. Nephrocystin-1 and 
nephrocystin-4 are expressed in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells. NPHP1 
and NPHP4 are highly conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, this species 
does not have a kidney but an excretory system that consists of an excretory 
cell, an excretory gland cell, a duct cell, and a pore cell. Therefore, cell 
type-specific expression pattern and function of the nephrocystin homologs in C. 
elegans were of interest. Expression of green fluorescence protein fusion 
constructs that contain the C. elegans promoter regions for nph-1 and nph-4 was 
not found in the excretory system but in ciliated sensory neurons of the head 
(amphid neurons) and the tail in hermaphrodites (phasmid neurons) and males 
(sensory ray neurons). As the knockout phenotype for the PKD homologs lov-1 and 
pkd-2 shows impaired male mating behavior, RNAi knockdown animals were analyzed 
for this phenotype. A similar phenotype was found in the nph-1 and nph-4 RNAi 
knockdown animals compared with the lov-1 and pkd-2 knockout phenotype. Thus, it 
is suggested that renal cyst-causing genes may be part of a shared functional 
module, highly conserved in evolution. The NPHP homologs may be necessary for 
initial assembly of the cilium, whereas the polycystic kidney disease homologs 
may function as sensory transducers.
