Many heat-shock proteins (Hsp) are members of evolutionarily conserved families 
of chaperone proteins that inhibit the aggregation of unfolded polypeptides and 
refold denatured proteins, thereby remedying phenotypic effects that may result 
from protein aggregation or protein instability. Here we report that the 
mitochondrial chaperone Hsp40, also known as Dnaja3 or Tid1, is differentially 
expressed during cardiac development and pathological hypertrophy. Mice 
deficient in Dnaja3 developed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and died before 10 
weeks of age. Progressive respiratory chain deficiency and decreased copy number 
of mitochondrial DNA were evident in cardiomyocytes lacking Dnaja3. Profiling of 
Dnaja3-interacting proteins identified the alpha-subunit of DNA polymerase gamma 
(Polga) as a client protein. These findings suggest that Dnaja3 is crucial for 
mitochondrial biogenesis, at least in part, through its chaperone activity on 
Polga and provide genetic evidence of the necessity for mitochondrial Hsp40 in 
preventing DCM.
