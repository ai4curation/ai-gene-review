The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that 
participates in the regulation of the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway by 
controlling the function of cullin-RING-ubiquitin ligases. Impressive progress 
has been made in deciphering its critical role in diverse cellular and 
developmental processes. However, little is known about the underlying 
regulatory principles that coordinate its function. Through biochemical and 
fluorescence microscopy analyses, we determined that the complex is localized in 
the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and chromatin-bound fractions, each differing in the 
composition of posttranslationally modified subunits, depending on its location 
within the cell. During the cell cycle, the segregation between subcellular 
localizations remains steady. However, upon UV damage, a dose-dependent temporal 
shuttling of the CSN complex into the nucleus was seen, accompanied by 
upregulation of specific phosphorylations within CSN1, CSN3, and CSN8. Taken 
together, our results suggest that the specific spatiotemporal composition of 
the CSN is highly controlled, enabling the complex to rapidly adapt and respond 
to DNA damage.
