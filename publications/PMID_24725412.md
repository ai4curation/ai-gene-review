Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common cause of familial 
and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Elevated LRRK2 kinase activity and 
neurodegeneration are linked, but the phosphosubstrate that connects LRRK2 
kinase activity to neurodegeneration is not known. Here, we show that ribosomal 
protein s15 is a key pathogenic LRRK2 substrate in Drosophila and human neuron 
PD models. Phosphodeficient s15 carrying a threonine 136 to alanine substitution 
rescues dopamine neuron degeneration and age-related locomotor deficits in 
G2019S LRRK2 transgenic Drosophila and substantially reduces G2019S 
LRRK2-mediated neurite loss and cell death in human dopamine and cortical 
neurons. Remarkably, pathogenic LRRK2 stimulates both cap-dependent and 
cap-independent mRNA translation and induces a bulk increase in protein 
synthesis in Drosophila, which can be prevented by phosphodeficient T136A s15. 
These results reveal a novel mechanism of PD pathogenesis linked to elevated 
LRRK2 kinase activity and aberrant protein synthesis in vivo.
