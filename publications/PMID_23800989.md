The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen is chemically complex and crowded with 
polypeptides in different stages of assembly. ER quality control monitors 
chaperone-assisted protein folding, stochastic errors and off-pathway 
intermediates. In acute conditions, potentially toxic polypeptides overflow the 
capacity of the chaperone system and lead to ER stress. Activation of the 
unfolded protein response (UPR) following ER stress buys time for non-native 
polypeptides to refold or be eliminated; otherwise cell death occurs. The 
clearance routes for deleterious proteins are endoplasmic reticulum-associated 
degradation (ERAD) and ER stress-activated autophagy. The ERAD pathway is a 
chaperone and proteasome-mediated polypeptide degradation, while autophagy 
applies to wider range of substances. ER stress signal transduction recruits 
diverse molecules and pathways upon UPR induction to compensate stress 
condition. NF-E2-related factor 1 (Nrf1) and Nrf2 are two transcription factors 
mostly known by their induction through an antioxidant response; they can also 
be activated by UPR machinery. Discovery of diverse molecules downstream of Nrf1 
and Nrf2 has expanded our understanding of the biological impacts of these 
transcription factors beyond classic antioxidant activation. In this review, we 
summarize our current understanding of mutual relationships between Nrf1, Nrf2, 
and ER stress clearance mechanisms and highlight the crosstalk of specific 
molecules mediating these correlations.
