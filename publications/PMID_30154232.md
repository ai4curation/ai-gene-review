Ceramidases hydrolyze ceramides into sphingosine and fatty acids, with 
sphingosine being further metabolized into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P); thus, 
ceramidases control the levels of these bioactive sphingolipids in cells and 
tissues. Neutral ceramidase (nCDase) is highly expressed in colorectal tissues, 
and a recent report showed that nCDase activity is involved in Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling. In addition, the inhibition of nCDase decreases the development and 
progression of colorectal tumor growth. Here, to determine the action of nCDase 
in colorectal cancer cells, we focused on the subcellular localization and 
metabolic functions of this enzyme in HCT116 cells. nCDase was found to be 
located in both the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus, but it had 
minimal effects on basal levels of ceramide, sphingosine, or S1P. Cells 
overexpressing nCDase were protected from the cell death and Golgi fragmentation 
induced by C6-ceramide, and they showed reduced levels of C6-ceramide and higher 
levels of S1P and sphingosine. Furthermore, compartment-specific metabolic 
functions of the enzyme were probed using C6-ceramide and Golgi-targeted 
bacterial SMase (bSMase) and bacterial ceramidase (bCDase). The results showed 
that Golgi-specific bCDase also demonstrated resistance against the cell death 
stimulated by C6-ceramide, and it catalyzed the metabolism of ceramides and 
produced sphingosine in the Golgi. Targeting bSMase to the Golgi resulted in 
increased levels of ceramide that were attenuated by the expression of nCDase, 
also supporting its ability to metabolize Golgi-generated ceramide. These 
results are critical in understanding the functions of nCDase actions in 
colorectal cancer cells as well as the compartmentalized pathways of 
sphingolipid metabolism.
