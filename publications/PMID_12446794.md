The SAGA complex is a conserved histone acetyltransferase-coactivator that 
regulates gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SAGA contains a number of 
subunits known to function in transcription including Spt and Ada proteins, the 
Gcn5 acetyltransferase, a subset of TATA-binding-protein-associated factors 
(TAF(II)s), and Tra1. Here we report the identification of SLIK (SAGA-like), a 
complex related in composition to SAGA. Notably SLIK uniquely contains the 
protein Rtg2, linking the function of SLIK to the retrograde response pathway. 
Yeast harboring mutations in both SAGA and SLIK complexes displays synthetic 
phenotypes more severe than those of yeast with mutation of either complex 
alone. We present data indicating that distinct forms of the SAGA complex may 
regulate specific subsets of genes and that SAGA and SLIK have multiple partly 
overlapping activities, which play a critical role in transcription by RNA 
polymerase II.
