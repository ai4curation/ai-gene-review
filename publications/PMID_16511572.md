It has been shown that MDMX inhibits the activity of the tumor suppressor p53 by 
primarily cooperating with the p53 feedback regulator MDM2. Here, our study 
shows that this inhibition can be overcome by 14-3-3gamma and Chk1. 14-3-3gamma 
was identified as an MDMX-associated protein via an immuno-affinity 
purification-coupled mass spectrometry. Consistently, 14-3-3gamma directly 
interacted with MDMX in vitro, and this interaction was stimulated by MDMX 
phosphorylation in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, in response to UV 
irradiation, the wild-type, but not the kinase-dead mutant, Chk1 phosphorylated 
MDMX at serine 367, enhanced the 14-3-3gamma-MDMX binding and the cytoplasmic 
retaining of MDMX. The Chk1 specific inhibitor UCN-01 repressed all of these 
effects. Moreover, overexpression of 14-3-3gamma, but not its mutant K50E, which 
did not bind to MDMX, suppressed MDMX-enhanced p53 ubiquitination, leading to 
p53 stabilization and activation. Finally, ablation of 14-3-3gamma by siRNA 
reduced UV-induced p53 level and G1 arrest. Thus, these results demonstrate 
14-3-3gamma and Chk1 as two novel regulators of MDMX in response to UV 
irradiation.

Abstract

It has been shown that MDMX inhibits the activity of the tumor suppressor p53 by primarily cooperating with the p53 feedback regulator MDM2. Here, our study shows that this inhibition can be overcome by 14-3-3γ and Chk1. 14-3-3γ was identified as an MDMX-associated protein via an immuno-affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry. Consistently, 14-3-3γ directly interacted with MDMX in vitro , and this interaction was stimulated by MDMX phosphorylation in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, in response to UV irradiation, the wild-type, but not the kinase-dead mutant, Chk1 phosphorylated MDMX at serine 367, enhanced the 14-3-3γ-MDMX binding and the cytoplasmic retaining of MDMX. The Chk1 specific inhibitor UCN-01 repressed all of these effects. Moreover, overexpression of 14-3-3γ, but not its mutant K50E, which did not bind to MDMX, suppressed MDMX-enhanced p53 ubiquitination, leading to p53 stabilization and activation. Finally, ablation of 14-3-3γ by siRNA reduced UV-induced p53 level and G1 arrest. Thus, these results demonstrate 14-3-3γ and Chk1 as two novel regulators of MDMX in response to UV irradiation.

Introduction

In response to stresses, the tumor suppressor p53 protein is stabilized and activated to induce cell growth arrest and/or apoptosis, consequently protecting normal cells from undergoing neoplasmic transformation ( Vogelstein et al , 2000 ). These functions of p53 primarily attribute to its nuclear transcriptional activity to induce the expression of a broad panel of genes. Some of these genes encode proteins, such as p21 or 14-3-3σ, responsible for stopping the cell growth ( el-Deiry et al , 1993 ; Harper et al , 1993 ; Dulic et al , 1994 ; Hermeking et al , 1997 ; Bunz et al , 1998 ), and others encode proteins, such as Bax or PIGs, important for apoptosis ( Miyashita and Reed, 1995 ; Venot et al , 1998 ). Also, p53 directly travels to the mitochondria, triggering apoptosis ( Mihara et al , 2003 ; Chipuk et al , 2004 ; Leu et al , 2004 ). To control these cytotoxic effects of p53, cells have developed a negative feedback regulatory loop to monitor its level. The key component of this loop is MDM2 (also called HDM2 in human) ( Barak et al , 1993 ; Fakharzadeh et al , 1993 ; Wu et al , 1993 ). MDM2 mediates p53 proteasomal degradation ( Haupt et al , 1997 ; Kubbutat et al , 1997 ) through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity ( Honda et al , 1997 ). To warrant the efficient execution of this feedback regulation, the cells also recruit an assistant for MDM2.

This assistant protein is MDMX (also called MDM4, or HDMX for human) ( Shvarts et al , 1996 ). MDMX resembles MDM2 at the N-terminal p53-binding and the C-terminal ring-finger domains ( Sharp et al , 1999 ). Like MDM2, MDMX binds to p53 and inhibits its functions ( Jackson and Berberich, 2000 ; Rallapalli et al , 2003 ). Similar to the mdm2–p53 double-knockout (KO) phenotype ( Jones et al , 1995 ; Montes de Oca Luna et al , 1995 ), deleting the p53 gene also rescues the lethal phenotype of mdmx null mice ( Parant et al , 2001 ; Migliorini et al , 2002b ), suggesting that MDMX is an essential MDM2 partner. But, unlike MDM2, MDMX transcript is not regulated by p53 ( Shvarts et al , 1996 ) and MDMX by itself is unable to ubiquitinate p53 ( Jackson and Berberich, 2000 ; Stad et al , 2000 ). Also, MDMX resides mostly in the cytoplasm ( Rallapalli et al , 1999 ), but can be recruited to the nucleus by MDM2 ( Gu et al , 2002 ; Migliorini et al , 2002a ), which is induced by γ irradiation ( Li et al , 2002 ). MDMX is thought to enhance MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation ( Ghosh et al , 2003 ), which are prevented by siRNAs against MDMX ( Gu et al , 2002 ; Linares et al , 2003 ). Hence, to activate p53, stress signals must turn on cellular mechanisms that surmount the negative control by MDM2 and MDMX.

Indeed, the MDM2–p53 loop is highly tuned through post-translational regulations in response to stresses ( Appella and Anderson, 2001 ). For instance, UV activates the ATR kinase, which phosphorylates p53 at serine 15 or MDM2 at serine 407 ( Tibbetts et al , 1999 ), or Chk1 that in turn phosphorylates p53 at serine 15 and serine 20 ( Shieh et al , 2000 ), resulting in p53 activation. Also, 14-3-3σ was shown to activate p53 by binding to and protecting it from MDM2 attack ( Yang et al , 2003 ). 14-3-3σ is one of the seven 28–33 kDa 14-3-3 proteins, which mostly localize in the cytoplasm. These acidic proteins are ubiquitously expressed and play multiple roles in cellular signaling, trafficking, apoptosis, cell cycle, and stress response. They prefer binding to serine/threonine-phosphoryated proteins at the consensus-binding motifs RSXpS/T/XP (type 1) or RXXXpS/TXP (type 2) ( Muslin et al , 1996 ; Yaffe et al , 1997 ), where X stands for any amino acids. Thus, those post-translational regulations ultimately activate p53 by blocking the MDM2 feedback loop. Although recent studies have begun to link post-translational regulations with MDMX ( Elias et al , 2005 ; Meulmeester et al , 2005 ; Pereg et al , 2005 ), less is known about how stress signals may activate p53 by influencing MDMX function and why MDMX mostly resides in the cytoplasm.

To address these issues, we generated a stable Flag-MDMX expression cell line using human embryonic kidney (HEK) epithelial 293 cells. Using this cell line for immuno-affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry, we identified 14-3-3γ as an MDMX-associated protein from the cytoplasmic extracts. Further analyses verified the association of this γ form with MDMX in cells. This binding is enhanced by Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of MDMX at serine 367 in response to UV, resulting in p53 activation.

Discussion

The oncoprotein MDMX plays an essential role in the MDM2–p53 feedback loop to further consolidate the inhibitory regulation of p53 by MDM2 ( Marine and Jochemsen, 2005 ). Interrupting this loop is crucial for activating p53 and preventing cell transformation ( Vousden, 2002 ). Our study unveils 14-3-3γ and Chk1 as two novel MDMX regulators to block this loop.

Our study demonstrates a direct and phosphorylation-stimulated interaction between 14-3-3γ and MDMX in response to UV. Previously, 14-3-3σ was shown to be induced by p53 to mediate p53-dependent G2 arrest ( Hermeking et al , 1997 ) and in turn to activate p53 by binding to it ( Yang et al , 2003 ). Unlike 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3γ did not bind to p53 ( Figure 9 ), instead strongly bound to MDMX in cells ( Figures 2 , 3 , 4 5 and 6 ). Consistently, there exists a 14-3-3-binding motif 363 R RTI Sp A P 369 in MDMX, but not in the same region of MDM2 ( Figure 1B ). Mutagenesis analyses of S367 or P369 in MDMX and of K50 in 14-3-3γ demonstrate the importance of these motifs in their interaction as well as functional regulation ( Figures 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 ). Although MDM2 displays two tentative 14-3-3-binding sites in different regions as detected using the ‘Scansite' program ( Obenauer et al , 2003 ), our results demonstrate that 14-3-3γ does not bind to MDM2 in vitro and in cells ( Figure 9 ).

One remaining puzzle is whether 14-3-3γ requires homo- or hetero-dimerization to bind to MDMX. In contrast to 14-3-3σ, which prefers forming homodimers in cells ( Benzinger et al , 2005 ; Wilker et al , 2005 ), 14-3-3γ may form a heterodimer with other isoforms in order to associate with MDMX, as more than two isoforms were copurified with Flag-MDMX from cells ( Figure 1A ). Also, a report published during the revision of our article has shown that exogenous MDMX also associates with the β, ɛ and τ isoforms in addition to 14-3-3γ ( Okamoto et al , 2005 ). By contrast, we found that MDMX binds to the γ isoform more efficiently than to other isoforms ( Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S1 ; data not shown). This discrepancy might be due to different cells or washing conditions used by the two laboratories. Or, it suggests that 14-3-3γ might possess a higher affinity to MDMX than others. The latter speculation is supported by our observation that endogenous 14-3-3γ, but not 14-3-3ɛ, bound to MDMX without apparent stresses ( Figure 2C ). Also, ablation of 14-3-3γ by siRNA alleviated UV-induced p53 activation and G1 arrest ( Figure 8 ), suggesting that 14-3-3γ plays a role in UV-induced p53 activation ( Figures 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ), at least at the early response to UV irradiation ( Supplementary Figure S2 ).

It has been shown that UV activates several kinases, including Chk1 that activates p53 ( Appella and Anderson, 2001 ). Interestingly, Chk1, but not its kinase-dead mutant, also stimulated the 14-3-3γ–MDMX interaction in response to UV ( Figure 5B ). This stimulation was specific for Chk1, as p38MAPK did not affect the 14-3-3γ–MDMX binding in response to UV ( Figure 5A ), and the Chk1-specific inhibitor UCN-01 effectively inhibited this stimulation ( Figures 5C and 6 ). Also Chk1 phosphorylated MDMX, but not the MDMX S367G or S367E mutant, in vitro and in cells ( Figure 6 ). These results demonstrate that Chk1 is a bona fide kinase for serine 367 and enhances the MDMX–14-3-3γ binding in response to UV. But it remains likely that the Chk1–14-3-3γ–MDMX pathway may respond to different stresses and that serine 367 may be phosphorylated by other kinases, such as Chk2 ( Chen et al , 2005 ), as other DNA-damaging agents were recently shown to induce the interaction of MDMX with 14-3-3β ( Okamoto et al , 2005 ).

The functional consequence of the interaction between 14-3-3γ and MDMX is p53 activation and G1 arrest ( Figure 7 ). One mechanism underlying this action is the inhibition of MDMX-enhanced p53 ubiquitination by 14-3-3γ ( Figure 9A ). This inhibition might not be due to the competition for protein binding, as MDM2 and p53 were pulled down with Flag-14-3-3γ in the presence of MDMX by the anti-Flag antibody ( Figure 9B ). It is likely that 14-3-3γ might interfere with the ubiquitin conjugation process by associating with MDMX as a stereo block. An alternative mechanism would be the nuclear exclusion of MDMX by associating with cytoplasmic 14-3-3γ in response to UV ( Figures 1 , 4 and 6 ). By contrast, γ irradiation may reduce this interaction by enhancing the nuclear import ( Figure 4 ) and MDMX degradation by MDM2 ( Chen et al , 2005 ). This is not the case after UV ( Figures 4 and 6 ) as it decreases MDM2 level ( Zeng et al , 2000 ). It still remains unclear if the 14-3-3γ–MDMX binding affects MDMX stability.

In sum, our study suggests a model for the action of 14-3-3γ working with Chk1 on the MDM2–MDMX–p53 pathway in response to UV irradiation ( Figure 9D ). This model raises some important questions. For instance, in which cellular compartment does Chk1 phosphorylate MDMX? Though our result suggests that it may occur in the cytoplasm ( Figure 6D ), this notion needs to be verified. Also, is 14-3-3γ mutated in human cancers? Addressing these and other tempting questions as aforementioned would shed light on our better understanding of the role of 14-3-3γ in the MDMX–MDM2–p53 pathway.
