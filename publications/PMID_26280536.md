PTEN is one of the most frequently mutated tumour suppressors and reduction in 
PTEN protein stability also plays a role in tumorigenesis. Although several 
ubiquitin ligases for PTEN have been identified, the deubiquitylase for 
de-polyubiquitylation and stabilization of PTEN is less defined. Here, we report 
OTUD3 as a deubiquitylase of PTEN. OTUD3 interacts with, de-polyubiquitylates 
and stabilizes PTEN. Depletion of OTUD3 leads to the activation of Akt 
signalling, induction of cellular transformation and cancer metastasis. OTUD3 
transgenic mice exhibit higher levels of the PTEN protein and are less prone to 
tumorigenesis. Reduction of OTUD3 expression, concomitant with decreased PTEN 
abundance, correlates with human breast cancer progression. Furthermore, we 
identified loss-of-function OTUD3 mutations in human cancers, which either 
abolish OTUD3 catalytic activity or attenuate the interaction with PTEN. These 
findings demonstrate that OTUD3 is an essential regulator of PTEN and that the 
OTUD3-PTEN signalling axis plays a critical role in tumour suppression.
