RATIONALE: Cocaine increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress protein 
expression via glutamate and dopamine receptor activation in the dorsal 
striatum.
OBJECTIVES: The present study was performed to investigate ER stress response in 
the dorsal striatum in response to acute or repeated cocaine stimulation. It was 
hypothesized that cocaine upregulates the ER stress protein immunoglobulin heavy 
chain binding protein (BiP) and the ER stress-associated protein caspase-12 via 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and D1 dopamine receptor activation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Western immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses were 
mainly performed to test this hypothesis in the rat dorsal striatum.
RESULTS: The results showed that BiP and caspase-12 immunoreactivities were 
significantly increased at 30, 60, and 120 min after acute or repeated 
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of three doses (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) of cocaine 
for seven consecutive days. Intrastriatal (i.s.) infusion of the selective NMDA 
antagonist MK801 (2 nmol) or AP5 (2 nmol) significantly attenuated the increase 
in the immunoreactivity of caspase-12 in the dorsal striatum induced by 
repeated, but not acute, cocaine (20 mg/kg) administration. However, i.p. 
injection of the selective D1 antagonist SCH23390 (0.1 mg/kg) significantly 
attenuated the increase in the immunoreactivity of caspase-12 in the dorsal 
striatum induced by both acute and repeated cocaine (20 mg/kg) stimulation.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that acute or repeated cocaine administration 
can cause ER stress response in the dorsal striatum in which NMDA and D1 
dopamine receptors participate in the mediation of the process.
