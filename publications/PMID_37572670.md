Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) utilize reversibly oxidized cysteine residues to reduce 
peroxides and promote H2O2 signal transduction, including H2O2-induced 
activation of P38 MAPK. Prdxs form H2O2-induced disulfide complexes with many 
proteins, including multiple kinases involved in P38 MAPK signaling. Here, we 
show that a genetically encoded fusion between a Prdx and P38 MAPK is sufficient 
to hyperactivate the kinase in yeast and human cells by a mechanism that does 
not require the H2O2-sensing cysteine of the Prdx. We demonstrate that a 
P38-Prdx fusion protein compensates for loss of the yeast scaffold protein Mcs4 
and MAP3K activity, driving yeast into mitosis. Based on our findings, we 
propose that the H2O2-induced formation of Prdx-MAPK disulfide complexes 
provides an alternative scaffold and signaling platform for MAPKK-MAPK 
signaling. The demonstration that formation of a complex with a Prdx is 
sufficient to modify the activity of a kinase has broad implications for 
peroxide-based signal transduction in eukaryotes.
