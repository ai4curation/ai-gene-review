T-cell receptors (TCR) recognize their antigen ligand at the interface between T 
cells and antigen-presenting cells, known as the immunological synapse (IS). The 
IS provides a means of sustaining the TCR signal which requires the continual 
supply of new TCRs. These are endocytosed and redirected from distal membrane 
locations to the IS. In our search for novel cytoplasmic effectors, we have 
identified β-arrestin-1 as a ligand of non-phosphorylated resting TCRs. Using 
dominant-negative and knockdown approaches we demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 is 
required for the internalization and downregulation of non-engaged bystander 
TCRs. Furthermore, TCR triggering provokes the β-arrestin-1-mediated 
downregulation of the G-protein coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4, but not of 
other control receptors. We demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 recruitment to the 
TCR, and bystander TCR and CXCR4 downregulation, are mechanistically mediated by 
the TCR-triggered PKC-mediated phosphorylation of β-arrestin-1 at Ser163. This 
mechanism allows the first triggered TCRs to deliver a stop migration signal, 
and to promote the internalization of distal TCRs and CXCR4 and their 
translocation to the IS. This receptor crosstalk mechanism is critical to 
sustain the TCR signal.

Abstract

T-cell receptors (TCR) recognize their antigen ligand at the interface between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, known as the immunological synapse (IS). The IS provides a means of sustaining the TCR signal which requires the continual supply of new TCRs. These are endocytosed and redirected from distal membrane locations to the IS. In our search for novel cytoplasmic effectors, we have identified β-arrestin-1 as a ligand of non-phosphorylated resting TCRs. Using dominant-negative and knockdown approaches we demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 is required for the internalization and downregulation of non-engaged bystander TCRs. Furthermore, TCR triggering provokes the β-arrestin-1-mediated downregulation of the G-protein coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4, but not of other control receptors. We demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 recruitment to the TCR, and bystander TCR and CXCR4 downregulation, are mechanistically mediated by the TCR-triggered PKC-mediated phosphorylation of β-arrestin-1 at Ser163. This mechanism allows the first triggered TCRs to deliver a stop migration signal, and to promote the internalization of distal TCRs and CXCR4 and their translocation to the IS. This receptor crosstalk mechanism is critical to sustain the TCR signal.

Introduction

Cells integrate extracellular cues that activate different membrane receptors, which in turn modulate the activity of a panel of transcription factors, and/or mediate the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and organelles. This signal integration does not always occur in the nucleus or through the cytoplasmic scaffold of signaling proteins. Moreover, some membrane receptors crosscommunicate, whereby one receptor type uses the signaling machinery of another receptor (Natarajan & Berk, 2006 ). A typical example of this is the crosstalk between the 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) initiated upon binding of either GPCR or RTK ligands (Natarajan & Berk, 2006 ; Shenoy & Lefkowitz, 2011 ). As such, ligand binding to RTKs can result in the appropriation of several components of the GPCR-mediated signaling machinery, including β-arrestin and G protein-receptor kinases (Shenoy & Lefkowitz, 2011 ). This crosstalk may be mediated by RTK-triggered activation of GPCR-associated G proteins, or even through direct interactions (Piiper & Zeuzem, 2004 ; Delcourt et al , 2007 ).

The TCR interacts functionally and physically with the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, a GPCR involved in the migration of T cells into lymphoid organs in response to gradients of the chemokine CXCL12 (Peacock & Jirik, 1999 ; Molon et al , 2005 ; Kumar et al , 2006 ). TCR triggering provokes the desensitization of T cells to CXCL12, blocking their migratory behavior and facilitating the formation of a stable contact between T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) (Bromley et al , 2000 ; Molon et al , 2005 ). Upon contacting an antigen-loaded APC, T cells rearrange their actin cytoskeleton and form a tight apposition with the APC membrane, generating a structure known as the immunological synapse (IS) (Dustin et al , 2010 ; Yokosuka & Saito, 2010 ). The TCR binds to the peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) ligand at the periphery of the IS, forming micron-sized clusters termed microclusters. TCRs transmit signals from within these microclusters, which move centripetally to form a central aggregation of TCRs, which results in the termination of TCR signaling and their subsequent removal from the center of the IS by a phagocytotic-like mechanism (Alarcon et al , 2011 ; Martinez-Martin et al , 2011 ). For full activation, exhausted TCRs must be replaced by new TCRs to engage pMHC, thereby sustaining TCR signaling for hours (Huppa et al , 2003 ). Thus, while horizontal movements of TCRs initially positioned at the T cell-APC contact site can mediate initial signaling events, distal TCRs must be internalized and rerouted to the IS in order to sustain the TCR signal (Das et al , 2004 ).

At least two independent mechanisms can be used to internalize pMHC-triggered TCRs: a clathrin-coated pit mechanism and a phagocytic-like mechanism. However, in addition to inducing the internalization of pMHC-engaged TCRs, TCR triggering provokes the internalization and downregulation of non-contacted bystander TCRs (Niedergang et al , 1998 ; San Jose et al , 2000 ; Monjas et al , 2004 ). This co-modulation of bystander TCRs occurs via a clathrin-coated pit-dependent mechanism that requires the activation and participation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (Monjas et al , 2004 ; von Essen et al , 2006 ).

TCR engagement by pMHC induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which consist of a double stretch of tyrosine and leucine (or isoleucine) residues with the consensus sequence YxxL/I(x)6-9YxxL/I. The dual phosphorylated ITAMs serve as high-affinity docking sites for signaling proteins containing tandem SH2 domains, such as the Syk-family tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. However, in their non-phosphorylated form, ITAMs are docking sites for other proteins such as adaptins, which can recognize each of the YxxL/I motifs and participate in endocytosis (Szymczak & Vignali, 2005 ). Other proteins that bind non-phosphorylated ITAMs include TC21 (also known as RRas2), a member of the Ras-related subfamily of GTPases, and EB1, a plus-end microtubule-tracking protein (Delgado et al , 2009 ; Martin-Cofreces et al , 2012 ).

To identify novel TCR effectors that bind to non-phosphorylated ITAMs, we employed a proteomic approach using synthetic peptides as baits. Among others, we identified β-arrestin-1 (β-Arr1; also known as arrestin-2) as a protein that binds to non-phosphorylated ITAMs in a manner dependent on TCR triggering and mediated by PKC. β-Arr1 binding induces the co-modulation of distal bystander TCRs and their re-routing to the IS, accompanied by CXCR4. We demonstrate that this mechanism is required to supply the IS with new TCRs and hence, to sustain the TCR signal.

Discussion

In this study, we have adopted a proteomic approach to characterize new ligands of the TCR-signaling ITAM motifs. In this way, we identified the GPCR-interacting protein β-Arr1 as a novel direct ligand of the TCR that is recruited to unphosphorylated ITAMs in a manner dependent on TCR triggering. While β-Arr1 was previously described as a cytoplasmic effector of both GPCRs and RTKs (Hupfeld & Olefsky, 2007 ), this is the first demonstration of β-Arr1 binding to the TCR, a multi-subunit receptor without intrinsic enzymatic activity. We found that β-Arr1 recruitment to the TCR was induced by TCR triggering. However, in contrast to the recruitment of other TCR signaling effectors, such as the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 or the adaptor protein Nck (Gil et al , 2002 ), that is mediated by changes in the TCR itself, recruitment of β-Arr1 to the TCR was mediated by modifying β-Arr1. The mechanism by which TCR triggering induces the recruitment of β-Arr1 to non-triggered TCRs involves the activation of PKC, in line with the proposed role of PKC in the down-regulation of bystander TCRs (Geisler, 2004 ). We demonstrate that PKC phosphorylates β-Arr1 at a single residue, Ser163, both in vitro and in vivo ; thus being this, to our knowledge, the first report showing that β-Arr1 is a substrate of PKC. Interestingly, Ser163 is placed within the previously characterized “phosphate sensor” of β-Arr1, which upon interaction with phosphorylated GPCRs provokes the opening of β-Arr1 into an active conformation enabled to bind GPCRs through C-terminal sequences (Gurevich & Gurevich, 2006 ). Thus, the finding that Ser163 becomes phosphorylates by PKC and that this phosphorylation is required to bind the TCR, suggests a new mechanism to change the charge of the “phosphate sensor” by direct phosphorylation and resulting in β-Arr1 activation.

While pMHC ligand binding to the TCR induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAMs within seconds and the activation of most of the TCR downstream pathways occurs within minutes, full T-cell activation requires contact between T cells and 1 or more antigen-loaded APCs for several hours (Grakoui et al , 1999 ). Thus, T cells require a sustained TCR signal over hours to proliferate or fully differentiate into effector cells. However, TCRs are rapidly internalized from the IS, the site of contact between the pMHC and the APC, and down-regulated (Lee et al , 2003 ; Alarcon et al , 2011 ). Down-regulation of TCRs at the IS involves their replacement by other unengaged TCRs. It has been recently demonstrated that engagement of a single TCR is sufficient to promote its translocation to the center of the IS (Xie et al , 2012 ). However, once all available TCRs at the T cell:APC contact surface have been engaged and down-regulated, other non-engaged TCRs must repopulate the IS, a process that involves the internalization of TCRs from sites distal to the IS and their relocation via endocytotic and exocytotic routes (Das et al , 2004 ; Soares et al , 2013 ). Our finding that β-Arr1 is required to down-regulate TCR-triggered bystander TCRs provides a mechanism for the crosstalk between pMHC-engaged TCRs at the IS and distal TCRs. In addition to its role in down-regulating bystander TCRs, β-Arr1 is required for TCR accumulation at the IS, which decreases in T cells either expressing the β-Arr1 (319-418) construct or depleted of β-Arr1. Taken together, inhibiting the TCR-induced down-regulation of distal TCRs and TCR accumulation at the IS by strategies that interfere with β-Arr1 function suggests that this protein mediates the TCR signal-mediated internalization of distal TCRs and their rerouting to the IS. Indeed, in cells expressing the β-Arr1(319-418) construct, TCRs are trapped in clathrin-positive endocytotic vesicles, suggesting that this construct not only acts as a dominant-negative mutant for TCR internalization but that it also prevents the rerouting of endocytotic vesicles to the IS.

Interfering with β-Arr1 function inhibits late T-cell activation events such as T-cell proliferation and expression of activation markers but also, β-Arr1-deficient T cells exhibit less sustained phosphorylation of the CD3ζ subunit of the TCR, indicating that β-Arr1 is required to sustain the TCR signal at the TCR level. This is in line with β-Arr1 participating in the rerouting of distal TCRs to the IS and sustaining the TCR signal. Interestingly, β-Arr1 is over-expressed in patients with multiple sclerosis. In addition, neurological symptoms in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis are attenuated and exacerbated by decreases and increases in β-Arr1 expression, respectively (Shi et al , 2007 ). These findings were interpreted in the context of the multiple roles of β-Arr1 as a scaffolding protein and activator, promoting the expression of pro-survival factors such as Bcl-2. Thus, the role of β-Arr1 in multiple sclerosis could be explained as a pro-survival effect on non-activated and activated CD4 + T cells. However, these results could also be interpreted in light of the present findings demonstrating a role of β-Arr1 in sustaining the TCR signal at the IS, suggesting that a more sustained TCR signal enhances autoimmunity. It would be of interest to explore if β-Arr1 plays a similar role in other autoimmune diseases. In fact, a recent report has shown that β-Arr1 levels are increased in T lymphocytes from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune disease characterized by T cell-mediated destruction of bile ducts, and that β-Arr1 overexpression increased T-cell proliferation and cytokine production (Hu et al , 2011 ).

The effect of TCR signaling on the internalization and down-regulation of distal membrane receptors was not generalized, as it failed to affect transferrin internalization or MHC-I expression. Nevertheless, TCR signaling did affect receptors other than the TCR itself, as TCR triggering provoked the down-regulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 via a mechanism mediated by β-Arr1. TCR signaling could therefore potentially mediate the down-regulation of all membrane receptors that recruit β-Arr1. The effect on CXCR4 is clearly relevant, as CXCR4 and the TCR associate at the IS (Molon et al , 2005 ). The activation of β-Arr1 by the TCR and its effect on CXCR4 down-regulation is also in line with the stop signal emitted by the TCR that terminates chemokine-driven T-cell migration when T cells begin to form an IS. Therefore, the modification of β-Arr1 induced by TCR signals appears to be instrumental in the transition from a migratory to a static behavior, whereby T cells must remain associated to an APC long enough to activate as many TCRs at the IS as are required for full T-cell activation. Indeed, it has been reported that unlike CXCR4, the chemokine receptor CCR7 is not recruited to the IS (Molon et al , 2005 ). Since CCR7 ligation inhibits T-cell activation, it is tempting to speculate that this is so because it does not receive the stop signal generated by TCR signaling (Bromley et al , 2000 ). We demonstrate that this lack of response correlates with an unresponsiveness to TCR-induced receptor down-regulation, suggesting that this effect is due to the inability of CCR7 to recruit β-Arr1 (Byers et al , 2008 ).

Although TCR triggering induces the down-regulation of distal TCRs and CXCR4, β-Arr1 appears to interact differently with each receptor. It was previously reported that the β-Arr1 (319-418) fragment exerts a dominant negative effect on GPCR down-regulation but at it does not bind to GPCRs (Krupnick et al , 1997 ; Gurevich & Gurevich, 2006 ), while the present findings demonstrate that this construct binds the TCR. Furthermore, we delimit the ITAM-binding domain of β-Arr1 to residues 319-382, which differ from the residues involved in GPCR-binding that appear to be scattered over the sequence of β-Arr1 (Moore et al , 2007 ), and which contains conserved sequences not present in β-Arr2 that might be responsible for ITAM binding. Regardless of which domains are responsible for the binding of β-Arr1 to TCRs and GPCRs, we describe a mechanism of membrane receptor cross-communication mediated by β-Arr1 that promotes the internalization and rerouting of distal receptors to a location in the membrane where another receptor is signaling. It remains to be determined whether this crosstalk also occurs in membrane receptors functionally linked to β-Arr1 other than the TCR.
