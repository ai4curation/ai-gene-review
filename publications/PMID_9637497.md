IL-10 is an important regulator of the production of proinflammatory cytokines. 
Its effect on IFN-alpha production, however, has not been reported. In this 
study, PBMC from healthy donors were stimulated with virus in the presence of 
IL-10. Human IL-10 (hIL-10) caused reductions in both the frequency of 
IFN-alpha-producing cells (IPC) and bulk IFN in response to herpes simplex virus 
type-1 (HSV-1), Sendai virus, Newcastle disease virus, and vesicular stomatitis 
virus. The inhibitory effect occurred when IL-10 was added 2 or 4 h before, or 2 
h poststimulation with HSV or Sendai virus, but not when added 4 h 
postinduction. Unlike IL-10, IL-4 did not affect the IFN-alpha response to HSV. 
However, when PBMC were induced with Sendai virus, IFN-alpha production was also 
reduced by IL-4. IL-10 treatment of PBMC resulted in strong reductions in the 
steady state levels of both HSV- and Sendai virus-induced IFN-alpha1, -alpha2, 
and -beta mRNA as determined by RT-PCR. IFN-alpha production to Sendai virus 
occurs predominantly by monocytes, whereas most enveloped viruses stimulate low 
frequency "natural IFN-producing cells (NIPC)," which are thought to be 
dendritic cells. Peripheral blood dendritic cells were found to express the 
IL-10 receptor, suggesting that IL-10 may directly act on the dendritic IPC. 
Addition of monoclonal anti-IL-10 to PBMC resulted in a significant increase in 
both the frequency of IPC and the amount of secreted IFN-alpha in response to 
HSV but not Sendai virus. We conclude that human IL-10 can serve as both an 
endogenous and exogenous regulator of IFN-alpha production.
