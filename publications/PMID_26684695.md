Abstract

The ribosome has historically been considered to have no cell-specific function but rather serve in a “housekeeping” capacity. This view is being challenged by evidence showing that heterogeneity in the protein composition of the ribosome can lead to the functional specialization of the ribosome. Expression profiling of different tissues revealed that ribosomal protein large 3-like ( Rpl3l ) is exclusively expressed in striated muscle. In response to a hypertrophic stimulus, Rpl3l expression in skeletal muscle was significantly decreased by 82% whereas expression of the ubiquitous paralog Rpl3 was significantly increased by ~5-fold. Based on these findings, we developed the hypothesis that Rpl3l functions as a negative regulator of muscle growth. To test this hypothesis, we used the Tet-On system to express Rpl3l in myoblasts during myotube formation. In support of our hypothesis, RPL3L expression significantly impaired myotube growth as assessed by myotube diameter (−23%) and protein content (−14%). Further analysis showed that the basis of this impairment was caused by a significant decrease in myoblast fusion as the fusion index was significantly lower (−17%) with RPL3L expression. These findings are the first evidence to support the novel concept of ribosome specialization in skeletal muscle and its role in the regulation of skeletal muscle growth.

INTRODUCTION

The ribosome is a supramolecular ribonucleoprotein complex that is comprised of two subunits: the small 40S subunit which is composed of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 32 ribosomal proteins (RPs) and the large 60S subunit, which consists of 5S, 5.8S, 28S rRNAs and 47 RPs. As the sole molecular machine responsible for translating mRNA into protein, ribosome function, not surprisingly, is intimately linked to cell growth, proliferation and homeostasis ( Grummt 2013 , Campbell and White 2014 ).

The ribosome has historically been viewed as functioning in a constitutive manner, decoding ribonucleotide sequences into amino acid sequences without any real regulative properties. Contrary to this perspective, Mauro and Edelman proposed the ribosome filter hypothesis which states that through specialization, the ribosome can preferentially translates different subsets of mRNAs ( Mauro and Edelman 2002 ). The specialization of ribosome function is thought to occur through differences in ribosomal protein composition, post-translational modification of ribosomal proteins and alternative forms of rRNA and their post-transcriptional modification ( Xue and Barna 2012 , Sauert, Temmel et al. 2014 ). Based on their investigation into the potential functional differences of ribosomal protein paralogs, Komili and colleagues put forth the concept of the “ribosome code”, drawing parallels to the histone code ( Komili, Farny et al. 2007 ). The ribosome code posits that functionally distinct classes of ribosomes are generated through the combined effect of the different forms of specialization, providing a new level of gene regulation through the selective translation of target mRNAs ( Komili, Farny et al. 2007 ). Importantly, a study by Kondrashov and coworkers extended the concept of ribosome specialization to mammals, demonstrating that the tissue-specific expression of Rpl38 during mouse embryonic development was required for proper patterning via translation of specific Hox transcripts ( Kondrashov, Pusic et al. 2011 ).

One way in which specialization of the ribosome is thought to occur is through changes in the protein composition of the ribosome by paralog substitution ( Xue and Barna 2012 ). During the course of characterizing the polycystic kidney disease type I gene region, Burn and colleagues identified a gene with 74% sequence identity to the Rpl3 (ribosomal protein large 3) gene which was designated Rpl3-like ( Rpl3l ) ( Burn, Connors et al. 1996 ). In a follow-up study, they unexpectedly discovered that Rpl3l expression, in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of Rpl3 , was restricted to skeletal muscle and the heart ( Van Raay, Connors et al. 1996 ). Studies on genome evolution, and the development of gene families, revealed that, unlike almost every other ribosomal protein gene duplicate, Rpl3l arose as the result of a DNA-mediated duplication event ( Jun, Ryvkin et al. 2009 ). The muscle-specific expression of Rpl3l is consistent with the finding that genes derived by such a duplication mechanism are often subject to more complex regulation because upstream regulatory sequences tend to be copied along with the protein coding region ( Dharia, Obla et al. 2014 ). A recent analysis of human RNA-seq data by Gupta and Warner confirmed the muscle-specific expression of Rpl3l and further showed Rpl3l to be one of only a few ribosomal proteins with tissue-specific expression ( Gupta and Warner 2014 ). Collectively, the findings from these studies highlight just how unique Rpl3l is among ribosomal proteins and raise the intriguing question as to why skeletal muscle has evolved its own version of the Rpl3 protein.

A hint as to what Rpl3l might be doing in skeletal muscle came from our transcriptome analysis of skeletal muscle hypertrophy ( Chaillou, Lee et al. 2013 ). We found that Rpl3l expression was dramatically down-regulated in response to a hypertrophic stimulus while Rpl3 expression was concomitantly up-regulated, suggesting Rpl3l has a role in regulating skeletal muscle mass. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that Rpl3l functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. To test this hypothesis, we generated a Rpl3l stable clone in C2C12 myogenic cells employing a Tet-On system to allow for the inducible expression of RPL3L protein during myogenic differentiation. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that expression of RPL3L caused a significant decrease in myotube diameter that was associated with reduced myoblast fusion. While our results do not exclude an extra-ribosomal function for Rpl3l , they are consistent with the idea that Rpl3l alters ribosome function in a yet-to-be determined way such that myoblast fusion was significantly decreased. Moreover, the findings of this study represent the first evidence to support the novel concept of ribosome specialization in skeletal muscle and its role in the regulation of skeletal muscle growth.

DISCUSSION

The ribosome has generally been considered to have no cell-specific function but rather serves in a “housekeeping” capacity. This view has been challenged by evidence showing that heterogeneity in the protein composition of the ribosome can result in the functional specialization of the ribosome ( Xue and Barna 2012 , Sauert, Temmel et al. 2014 ). Ribosome specialization can alter the intrinsic translational activity of the ribosome in a number of different ways such that there is the preferential translation of specific mRNAs, a change in translational fidelity or the level of IRES-mediated translation. For example, during mouse embryonic development, specific Hox mRNAs were shown to be selectively translated in those tissues that are enriched in ribosomal protein L38 ( Kondrashov, Pusic et al. 2011 ). The specialization of ribosome function represents a fundamental shift in how the ribosome is viewed – mRNA translation by the ribosome is not just a strictly constitutive process but can be regulative in nature. Moreover, the cellular specialization of ribosome function is an exciting discovery because it represents a completely new level of gene regulation, reminiscent of where the nascent field of microRNAs was in the early 2000s ( Couzin 2002 , Moss and Poethig 2002 , Gilbert 2011 , Xue and Barna 2012 ).

The Rpl3l gene was originally identified by Burn and colleagues and found to share high sequence homology with Rpl3 gene ( Burn, Connors et al. 1996 ). In a subsequent study, the same group provided the first evidence that, in stark contrast to the ubiquitously expressed gene Rpl3 , expression of Rpl3l was restricted to skeletal muscle and heart ( Van Raay, Connors et al. 1996 ). Here, we confirmed the striated muscle-specific expression of Rpl3l , showing that it was highly expressed in diaphragm, plantaris and heart but almost undetectable by qPCR in non-muscle tissue. Moreover, the finding that Rpl3l expression was extremely low in the intestine, a tissue containing a high proportion of smooth muscle, further emphasizes the striated muscle-specific expression of Rpl3l .

We became aware of Rpl3l while analyzing microarray data from a study examining changes in gene expression of skeletal muscle in response to a robust hypertrophic stimulus induced by synergist ablation ( Chaillou, Lee et al. 2013 ). This fortuitous finding prompted us to look at the expression profile of the complete set of 79 ribosomal protein genes following synergist ablation. Somewhat to our surprise, Rpl3l , and its paralog Rpl3 , were the only two ribosomal protein genes to show such a large (> 2.5-fold) change in expression (see Fig. 1B ). Even more curious was the apparent reciprocal change in Rpl3l and Rpl3 expression, being down- and up-regulated, respectively. This finding, coupled with the fact that Rpl3l is muscle-specific, raised the intriguing question, why has skeletal muscle evolved to have its own version of the ubiquitously expressed Rpl3 gene?

Beyond reports on its muscle-specific expression, there is nothing known about the function of Rpl3l ( Van Raay, Connors et al. 1996 , Thorrez, Van Deun et al. 2008 ). Based on the high-degree of amino acid conservation (~80%) between RPL3 and RPL3L, it is reasonable to suggest that RPL3L performs a similar, but distinct, function as RPL3 ( Van Raay, Connors et al. 1996 ). As one of the largest ribosomal proteins, RPL3 has been shown to be required for peptidyltransferase activity of the ribosome as well as being one of only two ribosomal proteins able to initiate the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit ( Nowotny and Nierhaus 1982 , Schulze and Nierhaus 1982 ). More recently, genetic and biochemical studies by the Dinman laboratory have shown that RPL3 functions as the “gatekeeper” of the A site allowing for the synchronization of aa-tRNA binding and translocation ( Petrov, Meskauskas et al. 2004 , Meskauskas, Petrov et al. 2005 , Meskauskas and Dinman 2007 ). Although the results of the current study do not offer any insight into just how Rpl3l might be altering ribosome function, our findings do provide the first evidence of a role for Rpl3l in the regulation of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. In particular, the results from our in vitro study support the idea that Rpl3l acts to inhibit myotube growth by limiting myoblast fusion through an unknown mechanism but one that presumably involves altering ribosome function. The magnitude of myotube atrophy caused by RPL3L expression is comparable to that reported following oxidative stress, cytokine exposure or glucocorticoid treatment ( Sultan, Henkel et al. 2006 , Menconi, Gonnella et al. 2008 , Li, Moylan et al. 2009 , McClung, Judge et al. 2009 , Yamaki, Wu et al. 2012 ). Similarly, our data suggest the down-regulation of Rpl3l expression in response to synergist ablation may be necessary for effective satellite cell fusion that is known to occur during compensatory hypertrophy ( McCarthy, Mula et al. 2011 ). The notion that Rpl3l may be acting as a break on hypertrophic growth through the regulation of satellite cell fusion is supported by microarray data showing that Rpl3l expression is progressively up-regulated in skeletal muscle during post-natal development, a period during which the rate of satellite cell fusion, and subsequently muscle growth, gradually levels off ( Cheng, Merriam et al. 2004 , White, Bierinx et al. 2010 ). The details of how a change in ribosome function by Rpl3l affects myoblast or satellite cell fusion remains unknown but is the focus of ongoing studies.

Several lines of evidence provide further support for the idea that Rpl3l regulates myoblast or satellite cell fusion. In an effort to gather additional clues about Rpl3l function, we searched online microarray databases with the hope of finding other conditions under which Rpl3l expression changed. First, we found that Rpl3l expression was barely detectable in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes by qPCR analysis (data not shown), a finding consistent with those reported in both mouse and human myoblasts and myotubes ( GSE10428 and GSE10435 ), in quiescent and activated mouse satellite cells ( GSE15155 ) as well as in myogenic progenitors during embryogenesis ( GSE42389 ) ( Harel, Maezawa et al. 2012 , Pallafacchina, Blaauw et al. 2013 ). Next, we found data showing that Rpl3l expression was decreased during the first days of skeletal muscle regeneration following cardiotoxin injection, as well as in skeletal muscle of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a myopathic disorder characterized by continuous cycles of degeneration-regeneration ( Haslett, Sanoudou et al. 2002 , Lukjanenko, Brachat et al. 2013 ). Finally, as mentioned previously, Rpl3l expression is very low during the early phase of post-natal development ( Cheng, Merriam et al. 2004 ), a period characterized by a robust increase in muscle fiber size and myonuclear number as a result of significant satellite cell fusion ( White, Bierinx et al. 2010 ). Collectively, these studies along with our data demonstrate a clear relationship between the down-regulation of Rpl3l expression and myoblast fusion. As a correlative, the high level of Rpl3l expression observed in adult skeletal muscle under basal conditions may function to make the muscle recalcitrant to myoblast fusion. Given the unique fusogenic property of skeletal muscle, it seems likely that it would be important to regulate this property to prevent the untimely fusion of myoblast or other fusogenic cells that come in contact with the muscle fiber.

The inverse pattern of expression of Rpl3 and Rpl3l reported in this study during skeletal muscle hypertrophy as well as during post-natal development ( Cheng, Merriam et al. 2004 ) and skeletal muscle regeneration ( Lukjanenko, Brachat et al. 2013 ) indicates there is coordinated regulation of these paralogs. In plants, and more recently in the mouse, there is evidence that the expression of ribosomal protein paralogs are in fact coordinately regulated, suggesting the cell tries to maintain a reciprocal level of paralog expression ( Popescu and Tumer 2004 , O’Leary, Schreiber et al. 2013 ). Unlike what we observed during skeletal muscle hypertrophy, we did not observe any change in RPL3 protein expression in myotubes upon induction of RPL3L expression (data not shown), suggesting that RPL3L does not regulate RPL3 expression in myotubes. Future studies are necessary to determine the mechanism responsible for the regulation of Rpl3 and Rpl3l during skeletal muscle hypertrophy.

How might ribosome specialization by RPL3L regulate myoblast fusion? Although there are a number of different scenarios for how RPL3L might be altering ribosome function, we favor the notion that the association of RPL3L with the ribosome increases the efficiency of −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF). This idea is based on the work of the Dinman laboratory which has shown that mutation in RPL3 can increase the efficiency of −1 PRF ( Meskauskas, Petrov et al. 2005 ). Further, particular transcripts are more suspectible to −1 PRF because of the presence of a “slippery” site that, in turn, can lead to non-sense mediated decay (NMD) as the result of a premature stop codon in the −1 reading frame. Thus, according to our working model, RPL3L reduces the abundance of transcripts encoding proteins required for myoblast fusion via NMD as the result of increased −1 PRF. Ongoing experiments are assessing the ability of RPL3L to alter the efficiency of −1 PRF and to identify relevant transcripts harboring a “slippery” site and a downstream premature stop codon.

In conclusion, we have shown in this study that the striated muscle-specific ribosomal protein gene Rpl3l was down-regulated during skeletal muscle hypertrophy. In an effort to investigate the role of this gene during skeletal muscle growth, we expressed RPL3L protein in C2C12 myogenic cells during myotube formation. Our results demonstrated that RPL3L expression decreased myotube size as a result of decreased myoblast fusion, suggesting the down-regulation of Rpl3l during skeletal muscle hypertrophy promotes satellite cell fusion. The results of this study provide the first evidence of ribosome specialization in adult tissue, skeletal muscle in particular. Furthermore, the findings of this study support the hypothesis that ribosome specialization has a role in the regulation of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Future studies will investigate the necessity of ribosome specialization in skeletal muscle hypertrophy in the adult and during post-natal development and the mechanism through which this specialization regulates skeletal muscle growth.
