When starved for nitrogen, MATa/MAT alpha cells of the budding yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergo a dimorphic transition to pseudohyphal growth. 
A visual genetic screen, called PHD (pseudohyphal determinant), for S. 
cerevisiae pseudohyphal growth mutants was developed. The PHD screen was used to 
identify seven S. cerevisiae genes that when overexpressed in MATa/MAT alpha 
cells growing on nitrogen starvation medium cause precocious and unusually 
vigorous pseudohyphal growth. PHD1, a gene whose overexpression induced invasive 
pseudohyphal growth on a nutritionally rich medium, was characterized. PHD1 maps 
to chromosome XI and is predicted to encode a 366-amino-acid protein. PHD1 has a 
SWI4- and MBP1-like DNA binding motif that is 73% identical over 100 amino acids 
to a region of Aspergillus nidulans StuA. StuA regulates two pseudohyphal 
growth-like cell divisions during conidiophore morphogenesis. Epitope-tagged 
PHD1 was localized to the nucleus by indirect immunofluorescence. These facts 
suggest that PHD1 may function as a transcriptional regulatory protein. 
Overexpression of PHD1 in wild-type haploid strains does not induce pseudohyphal 
growth. Interestingly, PHD1 overexpression enhances pseudohyphal growth in a 
haploid strain that has the diploid polar budding pattern because of a mutation 
in the BUD4 gene. In addition, wild-type diploid strains lacking PHD1 undergo 
pseudohyphal growth when starved for nitrogen. The possible functions of PHD1 in 
pseudohyphal growth and the uses of the PHD screen to identify morphogenetic 
regulatory genes from heterologous organisms are discussed.
