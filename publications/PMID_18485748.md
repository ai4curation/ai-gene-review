OBJECTIVE: As we previously reported, ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12, two members of 
ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs) family, 
degrade cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in vitro and are 
significantly induced in the cartilage and synovium of arthritic patients [Liu 
CJ, Kong W, Ilalov K, Yu S, Xu K, Prazak L, et al. ADAMTS-7: a metalloproteinase 
that directly binds to and degrades cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. FASEB J 
2006;20(7):988-90; Liu CJ, Kong W, Xu K, Luan Y, Ilalov K, Sehgal B, et al. 
ADAMTS-12 associates with and degrades cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. J 
Biol Chem 2006;281(23):15800-8]. The purpose of this study was to determine (1) 
whether cleavage activity of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 of COMP are associated with 
COMP degradation in osteoarthritis (OA); (2) whether alpha-2-macroglobulin 
(a(2)M) is a novel substrate for ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12; and (3) whether a(2)M 
inhibits ADAMTS-7 or ADAMTS-12 cleavage of COMP.
METHODS: An in vitro digestion assay was used to examine the degradation of COMP 
by ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 in the cartilage of OA patients; in cartilage explants 
incubated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin-1-beta 
(IL-1beta) with or without blocking antibodies; and in human chondrocytes 
treated with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown ADAMTS-7 or/and 
ADAMTS-12. Digestion of a(2)M by ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 in vitro and the 
inhibition of ADAMTS-7 or ADAMTS-12-mediated digestion of COMP by a(2)M were 
also analyzed.
RESULTS: The molecular mass of the COMP fragments produced by either ADAMTS-7 or 
ADAMTS-12 were similar to those observed in OA patients. Specific blocking 
antibodies against ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 dramatically inhibited TNF-alpha- or 
IL-1beta-induced COMP degradation in the cultured cartilage explants. The 
suppression of ADAMTS-7 or ADAMTS-12 expression by siRNA silencing in the human 
chondrocytes also prevented TNF-alpha- or IL-1beta-induced COMP degradation. 
Both ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 were able to cleave a(2)M, giving rise to 180- and 
105-kDa cleavage products, respectively. Furthermore, a(2)M inhibited both 
ADAMTS-7- and ADAMTS-12-mediated COMP degradation in a concentration (or 
dose)-dependent manner.
CONCLUSION: Our observations demonstrate the importance of COMP degradation by 
ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 in vivo. Furthermore, a(2)M is a novel substrate for 
ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12. More significantly, a(2)M represents the first 
endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12.

Methods

An in vitro digestion assay was used to examine the degradation of COMP by ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 in the cartilage of OA patients; in cartilage explants incubated with TNF-α or IL-1β with or without blocking antibodies; and in human chondrocytes treated with specific siRNA to knock down ADAMTS-7 or/and-12. Digestion of alpha-2-macroglobulin (a2M) by ADAMTS-7 and -12 in vitro and the inhibition of ADAMTS-7 or -12-mediated digestion of COMP by α2M were also analyzed.

Results

The molecular mass of the COMP fragments produced by either ADAMTS-7 or ADAMTS-12 were similar to those observed in OA patients. Specific blocking antibodies against ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 dramatically inhibited TNF-α- or IL-1β-induced COMP degradation in the cultured cartilage explants. The suppression of ADAMTS-7 or ADAMTS-12 expression by siRNA silencing in the human chondrocytes also prevented TNF-α- or IL-1β-induced COMP degradation. Both ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 were able to cleave α 2 M, giving rise to 180 and 105 kDa cleavage products, respectively. Furthermore, α 2 M inhibited both ADAMTS-7- and ADAMTS-12-mediated COMP degradation in a concentration (or dose)-dependent manner.

Conclusion

Our observations demonstrate the importance of COMP degradation by ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 in vivo. Furthermore, α 2 M is a novel substrate for ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12. More significantly, α 2 M represents the first endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12.

Introduction

Cartilage consists mainly of extracellular matrix (ECM) with very few cells, mostly chondrocytes. Arthritis is characterized by the breakdown of the ECM and subsequent loss of articular cartilage typically mediated by an excessive amount of active proteolytic activity[ 1 ]. The ECM is a network of proteins and macromolecules that provides both strength and nutrients for the cells. Articular cartilage is composed of 60-85% water, 15-22% type II collagen, 4-7% aggrecan and less than 5% other matrix proteins such as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), decorin and collagens I, V, VI, IX, and XI among others. COMP, a prominent noncollagenous component of cartilage, accounts for approximately 1% of the wet weight of articular tissue [ 2 , 3 ]. COMP is a 524-kDa pentameric, disulfide-bonded, multidomain glycoprotein composed of approximately equal subunits (∼110 kDa each) [ 4 , 5 ]. COMP fragments have been detected in the cartilage, synovial fluid, and serum of patients with knee injuries, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis[ 6 - 8 ]. In previous studies to identify the physiological enzymes responsible for COMP degradation, we performed a functional genetic screen, which led to the isolation of ADAMTS-7 and -12 as COMP-binding partners [ 9 , 10 ]. Subsequent studies showed that both ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 were able to digest COMP in vitro and that their levels were significantly upregulated in arthritic cartilage and synovium compared to a normal controls [ 6 - 10 ].

ADAMTS-7 and -12 belong to the metalloproteinase ADAMTS ( a d isintegrin a nd m etalloprotease with t hrombo s pondin motifs) family. The ADAMTS family consists of secreted zinc metalloproteinases with a precisely ordered modular organization that includes at least one thrombospondin type I repeat [ 11 ]. So far, nineteen members have been cloned in this family and some of them have known functions that have been implicated in specific diseases [ 12 ]. For instance, ADAMTS-13 mutants have a role in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a disease characterized by a decrease in the amount of circulating platelets[ 13 ]. Mutations in the ADAMTS-2 gene (procollagen I N-proteinase) cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type VII C, a genetic condition characterized by defects in collagen synthesis, as well as bovine dermatopraxis[ 14 ]. A number of ADAMTS members have been implicated in the breakdown of cartilage in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, including ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase 1), ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase 2)[ 15 - 18 ], ADAMTS-7[ 9 ] and ADAMTS-12[ 10 ].

α 2 -Macroglobulin (α 2 M) is a member of the α-macroglobulin family of proteins found in the circulation of a broad range of species [ 19 ]. Human α 2 M is found at relatively high levels (2-4 mg/ml) in plasma and is a tetramer of four identical 185-kDa subunits, each of which has an exposed 39-amino acid “bait region” that contains cleavage sites for a variety of proteinases [ 20 , 21 ]. The function of the bait region is to trap the proteinase, potentially accounting for its capacity to bind and inhibit ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5 and ADAMTS-10[ 22 , 23 ]. ADAMTS-1 forms a stable complex with α 2 M that is dependent on the zinc binding catalytic domain of ADAMTS-1[ 24 ].

Inhibition of degradative enzymes can slow or block disease progression. The isolation of physiological inhibitors for the cartilage degradative enzymes is, therefore, of great interest from both a pathophysiological and a therapeutic standpoint. α2M is an inhibitor of several metalloproteases, including collagenase, stromelysis [ 25 ], ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 [ 23 ]. In addition, a2M also associates with ADAMTS-7 [ 26 ]. The purpose of the study was to examine the potential association of the ADAMTS-7 and -12-mediated cleavage of COMP with osteoarthritis damage, and the possible role of α2M as a substrate for and inhibitor of ADAMTS-7 or -12 enzyme activity against COMP.

DISCUSSION

ADAMTS family proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of different diseases, including arthritis [ 37 - 43 ]. We previously reported that ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12, two members in this family sharing similar domain organization and structure, associated with and cleaved COMP in the in vitro digestion system, and their levels were significantly elevated in the cartilage and synovium of patients with arthritis [ 9 , 10 ]. The present study provides insight into the importance of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 in the degradation of COMP in the course of arthritis, since the size of the COMP fragment produced by ADAMTS-7 or -12 is similar to that of COMP-degradative fragments seen in OA patients ( Fig. 1 ). Antibody blocking assays with cartilage explants have been widely used [ 44 - 46 ]. Using this model we found that anti-ADAMTS-7 and/or anti-ADAMTS-12 antibody dramatically inhibited COMP degradation induced by TNF-α and IL-1β, two key cytokines in the progression of arthritis that induce the expression of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 (Figs. 2 , 3 ). In addition, both anti-ADAMTS-7 or anti-ADAMTS-12 antibody did not inhibit ADAMTS-4-mediated COMP digestion in an in vitro assay (not shown). These data indicated that ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 are important for the cytokine-induced COMP degradation. The present study also presents evidence that α2M is a novel substrate for ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 (Figs. 4 , 5 ) and acts as an inhibitor of COMP degradation mediated by these two enzymes (Figs. 6 , 7).

Nineteen distinct human ADAMTS gene products have been cloned and can be divided into five subgroups based on their known functions [ 12 ]. The first of the divisions, consisting of ADAMTS-1, -4, -5, -8, -9, -15 and -20, cleave aggrecan [ 12 ]. ADAMTS-1 also cleaves the related hyalectan versican at analogous sites and ADAMTS-4 has been demonstrated to cleave brevican [ 47 ]. Among them, ADAMTS-4 and -5 have been best characterized and implicated in aggrecan degradation in osteoarthritis [ 16 ]. ADAMTS-5 is probably the major aggrecanase responsible for aggrecan degradation in vivo [ 41 , 48 ]. ADAMTS-4 has been also shown to cleave COMP as well as fibromodulin and decorin [ 49 - 51 ]. A second subgroup contains ADAMTS-2, -3 and -14. ADAMTS-2 cleaves the amino peptides of type I, type II and type III procollagens [ 52 , 53 ], ADAMTS-3 has since been identified as a type II procollagen N-propeptidase, whose expression is about 5-fold that of ADAMTS-2 in cartilage [ 54 ]. ADAMTS-14 has been identified as a homologue of ADAMTS-2, functioning as the major type I procollagen N-propeptidase activity in tendon [ 55 ]. ADAMTS-13, a von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease, stands as one subgroup [ 56 , 57 ]. ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 that specifically associate with and degrade COMP represent another subgroup [ 9 , 10 , 26 , 58 ]. And the remaining ADAMTS members form a loosely defined subgroup with unknown functions[ 12 ].

In addition to ADAMTS-7 and -12, ADAMTS-4 and several members of the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), collagenase-3 (MMP-13), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), gelatinase-B (MMP-9), MMP-19, and enamelysin (MMP-20) also digest purified COMP in vitro. Here we also show that, an additional fragment ( Fig. 1 , small arrowhead) was observed in OA samples that was absent in ADAMTS-12- and ADAMTS-7-mediated COMP digestion, suggesting that additional enzyme(s) may contribute to COMP degradation in OA patients. In addition to COMP, a recent report revealed that aggrecan was also a substrate of ADAMTS-12[ 59 ], suggesting that competitive substrate might lead to the enzyme inhibition. In addition, several reports suggest that COMP may function to stabilize the articular cartilage extracellular matrix by specific cation-dependent interactions with matrix components, including collagen types II and IX, fibronectin, aggrecan, and matrilin-1, -3, and -4 [ 32 , 60 - 63 ]. Thus, it is conceivable that the inhibition of COMP degradation may stabilize the cartilage matrix and in turn affect the degradation of the main macromolecules, including collagens and aggrecan.

Full length α2M is approximately 185 kD and forms a tetramer. It may be cleaved by ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5, two major aggrecanases, and can inhibit their activities [ 23 ]. In this study we demonstrated that α2M is also a substrate for ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12, two known COMP-associating and -degrading metalloproteinases (Figs. 4 and 5 ) and prevents the degradation of COMP by these enzymes in a does-dependent manner (Figs. 6 and 7). Degradation of a2M by ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 gives rise to two fragments, one major 180 kD and one minor 105 kDa fragment, suggesting that a2M may contain two cleavage sites of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 (Figs. 4 and 5 ). Tortorella et al. have shown that ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 digested a2M at one major sensitive site and at additional insensitive sites with much less efficiency [ 23 ].

Evidence showing the importance of ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 for the in vivo degradation of COMP, identification of α2M as a novel substrate for ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12, and subsequent characterization of its inhibitory activities on the degradation of COMP by ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 significantly extends our understanding of the degradative events that occur in joint disorders. These findings will also contribute to our ability to monitor the biological and physical properties of cartilage extracellular matrix, and provide us with promising therapeutic targets, including α2M or its derivatives, for treating or preventing extracellular matrix degeneration.
