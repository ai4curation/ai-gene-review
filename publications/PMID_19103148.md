Human liver CYP3A4 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored hemoprotein 
responsible for the metabolism of >50% of clinically prescribed drugs. After 
heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is degraded via the 
ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent 26S proteasomal pathway that utilizes Ubc7p/Cue1p, but 
none of the canonical Ub-ligases (E3s) Hrd1p/Hrd3p, Doa10p, and Rsp5p involved 
in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). To identify an Ub-ligase capable of 
ubiquitinating CYP3A4, we examined various in vitro reconstituted mammalian E3 
systems, using purified and functionally characterized recombinant components. 
Of these, the cytosolic domain of the ER-protein gp78, also known as the tumor 
autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), an UBC7-dependent polytopic 
RING-finger E3, effectively ubiquitinated CYP3A4 in vitro, as did the 
UbcH5a-dependent cytosolic E3 CHIP. CYP3A4 immunoprecipitation coupled with 
anti-Ub immunoblotting analyses confirmed its ubiquitination in these 
reconstituted systems. Thus, both UBC7/gp78 and UbcH5a/CHIP may be involved in 
CYP3A4 ERAD, although their relative physiological contribution remains to be 
established.
