Both dauer formation (a stage of developmental arrest) and adult life-span in 
Caenorhabditis elegans are negatively regulated by insulin-like signaling, but 
little is known about cellular pathways that mediate these processes. Autophagy, 
through the sequestration and delivery of cargo to the lysosomes, is the major 
route for degrading long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles in eukaryotic 
cells. Using nematodes with a loss-of-function mutation in the insulin-like 
signaling pathway, we show that bec-1, the C. elegans ortholog of the yeast and 
mammalian autophagy gene APG6/VPS30/beclin1, is essential for normal dauer 
morphogenesis and life-span extension. Dauer formation is associated with 
increased autophagy and also requires C. elegans orthologs of the yeast 
autophagy genes APG1, APG7, APG8, and AUT10. Thus, autophagy is a cellular 
pathway essential for dauer development and life-span extension in C. elegans.
