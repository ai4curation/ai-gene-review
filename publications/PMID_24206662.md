Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that regulate diverse cellular 
processes. In canonical activation, ligand availability is sufficient to produce 
receptor binding, entraining downstream signaling. The mineralocorticoid 
receptor (MR) is normally activated by aldosterone, which is produced in both 
volume depletion and hyperkalemia, states that require different homeostatic 
responses. We report phosphorylation at S843 in the MR ligand-binding domain 
that prevents ligand binding and activation. In kidney, MR(S843-P) is found 
exclusively in intercalated cells of the distal nephron. In volume depletion, 
angiotensin II and WNK4 signaling decrease MR(S843-P) levels, whereas 
hyperkalemia increases MR(S843-P). Dephosphorylation of MR(S843-P) results in 
aldosterone-dependent increases of the intercalated cell apical proton pump and 
Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchangers, increasing Cl(-) reabsorption and promoting increased 
plasma volume while inhibiting K(+) secretion. These findings reveal a mechanism 
regulating nuclear hormone receptor activity and implicate selective MR 
activation in intercalated cells in the distinct adaptive responses to volume 
depletion and hyperkalemia.
