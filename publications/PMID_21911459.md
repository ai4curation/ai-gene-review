Periodontal disease is a chronic oral inflammatory disease that is triggered by 
bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. gingivalis strains exhibit great 
heterogeneity, with some strains being encapsulated while others are 
nonencapsulated. Although the encapsulated strains have been shown to be more 
virulent in a mouse abscess model, so far the role of the capsule in P. 
gingivalis interactions with host cells is not well understood and its role in 
virulence has not been defined. Here, we investigated the contribution of the 
capsule to triggering a host response following microbial infection, as well as 
its protective role following bacterial internalization by host phagocytic cells 
with subsequent killing, using the encapsulated P. gingivalis strain W50 and its 
isogenic nonencapsulated mutant, PgC. Our study shows significant time-dependent 
upregulation of the expression of various groups of genes in macrophages 
challenged with both the encapsulated and nonencapsulated P. gingivalis strains. 
However, cells infected with the nonencapsulated strain showed significantly 
higher upregulation of 9 and 29 genes at 1 h and 8 h postinfection, 
respectively, than cells infected with the encapsulated strain. Among the genes 
highly upregulated by the nonencapsulated PgC strain were ones coding for 
cytokines and chemokines. Maturation markers were induced at a 2-fold higher 
rate in dendritic cells challenged with the nonencapsulated strain for 4 h than 
in dendritic cells challenged with the encapsulated strain. The rates of 
phagocytosis of the nonencapsulated P. gingivalis strain by both macrophages and 
dendritic cells were 4.5-fold and 7-fold higher, respectively, than the rates of 
phagocytosis of the encapsulated strain. On the contrary, the survival of the 
nonencapsulated P. gingivalis strain was drastically reduced compared to the 
survival of the encapsulated strain. Finally, the encapsulated strain exhibited 
greater virulence in a mouse abscess model. Our results indicate that the P. 
gingivalis capsule plays an important role in aiding evasion of host immune 
system activation, promoting survival of the bacterium within host cells, and 
increasing virulence. As such, it is a major virulence determinant of P. 
gingivalis.
