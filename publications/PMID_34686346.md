FBXO31 is the substrate receptor of one of many CUL1-RING ubiquitin ligase 
(CRL1) complexes. Here, we show that low FBXO31 mRNA levels are associated with 
high pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and Gleason grade in 
human prostate cancer. Mechanistically, the ubiquitin ligase CRL1FBXO31 promotes 
the ubiquitylation-mediated degradation of DUSP6, a dual specificity phosphatase 
that dephosphorylates and inactivates the extracellular-signal-regulated 
kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2). Depletion of FBXO31 stabilizes DUSP6, suppresses ERK 
signaling, and activates the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade. Moreover, deletion of 
FBXO31 promotes tumor development in a mouse orthotopic model of prostate 
cancer. Treatment with BCI, a small molecule inhibitor of DUSP6, suppresses AKT 
activation and prevents tumor formation, suggesting that the FBXO31 tumor 
suppressor activity is dependent on DUSP6. Taken together, our studies highlight 
the relevance of the FBXO31-DUSP6 axis in the regulation of ERK- and 
PI3K-AKT-mediated signaling pathways, as well as its therapeutic potential in 
prostate cancer.
