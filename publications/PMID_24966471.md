Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α) is a proinflammatory cytokine that exerts 
both homeostatic and pathophysiological roles in the central nervous system. In 
pathological conditions, microglia release large amounts of TNF-α; this de novo 
production of TNF-α is an important component of the so-called neuroinflammatory 
response that is associated with several neurological disorders. In addition, 
TNF-α can potentiate glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity by two complementary 
mechanisms: indirectly, by inhibiting glutamate transport on astrocytes, and 
directly, by rapidly triggering the surface expression of Ca(+2) permeable-AMPA 
receptors and NMDA receptors, while decreasing inhibitory GABAA receptors on 
neurons. Thus, the net effect of TNF-α is to alter the balance of excitation and 
inhibition resulting in a higher synaptic excitatory/inhibitory ratio. This 
review summarizes the current knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms 
by which TNF-α links the neuroinflammatory and excitotoxic processes that occur 
in several neurodegenerative diseases, but with a special emphasis on 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). As microglial activation and upregulation 
of TNF-α expression is a common feature of several CNS diseases, as well as 
chronic opioid exposure and neuropathic pain, modulating TNF-α signaling may 
represent a valuable target for intervention.
