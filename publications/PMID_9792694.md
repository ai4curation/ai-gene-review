We have isolated the cDNA encoding a novel c-Myc-binding protein, MM-1, by the 
yeast two-hybrid screening of a human HeLa cell cDNA library. The protein 
deduced from the cDNA comprises 167 amino acids and was localized in the nucleus 
of introduced COS-I cells. The MM-1 mRNA was highly expressed in human pancreas 
and skeletal muscle and moderately in other tissues. As for the c-Myc binding, 
glutathione S-transferase MM-1 expressed in Escherichia coli bound in vitro to 
c-Myc translated in reticulocyte lysate, and almost whole, the MM-1 molecule was 
necessary for the binding in the yeast two-hybrid system. The mammalian 
two-hybrid assays in hamster CHO cells revealed that MM-1 interacts in vivo with 
the N-terminal domain covering the myc box 2, a transcription-activating domain, 
of c-Myc. Furthermore, MM-1 repressed the activation of E-box-dependent 
transcription by c-Myc.
