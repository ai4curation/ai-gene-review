BACKGROUND: Naturally occurring electric fields (EFs) are an intrinsic property 
of wounds. Endogenous EFs in skin wounds play critical roles in the dynamic and 
well-ordered biological process of wound healing. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) allows keratinocytes to transition from sedentary cells to 
motile cells, facilitating wound healing. However, EMT-related studies have been 
performed without considering endogenous EFs. Thus, the relationship between 
electrical signals and the EMT remain elusive.
OBJECTIVE: Phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) and mammalian target of 
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) are key molecules in sensing electrical cues, and 
they play significant roles in cellular responses to EFs. In addition, these 
molecules are closely related to the occurrence of the EMT in other cells. We 
used primary human keratinocytes to investigate the influence of EFs on the EMT 
as well as the roles of PTEN and mTORC1 in this process.
METHODS: The effects of EFs on the EMT were investigated by analyzing the levels 
of specific proteins and transcription factors. The roles of mTORC1 and PTEN and 
their relationship with each other were studied via pharmacological inhibition 
or genetic knockdown. A Zeiss imaging system and scratch assays were used to 
study single-cell motility and monolayer cell migration.
RESULTS: EFs induced a range of both biochemical changes (e.g., increased Snail, 
Slug, vimentin, and N-cadherin expression, decreased E-cadherin expression) and 
functional changes (e.g., enhanced migratory capacity) that are characteristic 
of the EMT. EF-stimulated cells exhibited suppressed PTEN expression, and 
further PTEN downregulation led to the acquisition of more mesenchymal features 
and the loss of epithelial characteristics, which was accompanied by increased 
migratory capacity. PTEN overexpression reversed the EF-induced EMT and 
inhibited the migratory capacity of keratinocytes. EF-induced mTORC1 activation 
was a required component of the causal relationship between PTEN suppression and 
the EMT, as mTORC1 inhibition reversed the EMT induced by PTEN downregulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the EF-induced suppression of PTEN drives 
the EMT via mTORC1 activation, thereby revealing a new and promising role of EFs 
in facilitating wound reepithelialization. These results provide a novel 
perspective regarding the significance of EFs in wound healing; therefore, 
electrical stimulation offers a new avenue of wound management for improved and 
accelerated wound healing.
