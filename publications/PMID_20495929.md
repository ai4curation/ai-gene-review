Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is an evolutionary diverse enzyme. In higher 
eukaryotes, TrxR contains a selenocysteine in the active site which confers high 
activity and a broad substrate range. The parasitic nematode Haemonchus 
contortus contains two TrxRs, a cytoplasmic enzyme HcTrxR1 with a selenocysteine 
in the active site (Gly-Cys-SeCys-Gly), similar to the mammalian TrxR, and a 
mitochondrial enzyme HcTrxR2 with a Gly-Cyc-Cys-Gly active site which is unique 
to nematodes. Both enzymes were cloned and expressed and their activity compared 
to rat TrxR. Although the expressed HcTrxR1 contained a cysteine to replace the 
selenocycteine, it showed broad activity with thioredoxins from Escherichia 
coli, sheep, and H. contortus similar to the rat selenoenzyme. However, HcTrxR2 
had high activity only with the mitochondrial H. contortus thioredoxin. HcTrxR2 
was also active with the commonly used substrate 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) 
and sodium selenite and was inhibited by auranofin and the natural product 
compounds curcumin and theaflavin. This demonstrates that the non-seleno-enzyme 
HcTrxR2 is as active as the rat seleno-containing enzyme when reacting with the 
H. contortus thioredoxin.
