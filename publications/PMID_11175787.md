Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes that 
have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression, cell-cycle control 
and oncogenesis. MyoD is a muscle-specific regulator able to induce myogenesis 
in numerous cell types. To ascertain the requirement for chromatin remodeling 
enzymes in cellular differentiation processes, we examined MyoD-mediated 
induction of muscle differentiation in fibroblasts expressing dominant-negative 
versions of the human brahma-related gene-1 (BRG1) or human brahma (BRM), the 
ATPase subunits of two distinct SWI/SNF enzymes. We find that induction of the 
myogenic phenotype is completely abrogated in the presence of the mutant 
enzymes. We further demonstrate that failure to induce muscle-specific gene 
expression correlates with inhibition of chromatin remodeling in the promoter 
region of an endogenous muscle-specific gene. Our results demonstrate that 
SWI/SNF enzymes promote MyoD-mediated muscle differentiation and indicate that 
these enzymes function by altering chromatin structure in promoter regions of 
endogenous, differentiation-specific loci.
