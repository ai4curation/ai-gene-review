The regulatory role of N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and its nuclear binding 
protein YTHDC1 in pre-mRNA splicing remains an enigma. Here we show that YTHDC1 
promotes exon inclusion in targeted mRNAs through recruiting pre-mRNA splicing 
factor SRSF3 (SRp20) while blocking SRSF10 (SRp38) mRNA binding. Transcriptome 
assay with PAR-CLIP-seq analysis revealed that YTHDC1-regulated exon-inclusion 
patterns were similar to those of SRSF3 but opposite of SRSF10. In vitro 
pull-down assay illustrated a competitive binding of SRSF3 and SRSF10 to YTHDC1. 
Moreover, YTHDC1 facilitates SRSF3 but represses SRSF10 in their nuclear speckle 
localization, RNA-binding affinity, and associated splicing events, 
dysregulation of which, as the result of YTHDC1 depletion, can be restored by 
reconstitution with wild-type, but not m(6)A-binding-defective, YTHDC1. Our 
findings provide the direct evidence that m(6)A reader YTHDC1 regulates mRNA 
splicing through recruiting and modulating pre-mRNA splicing factors for their 
access to the binding regions of targeted mRNAs.
