Synaptic plasticity involves a series of coordinate changes occurring both pre- 
and postsynaptically, of which alpha-synuclein is an integral part. We have 
investigated on mouse primary hippocampal neurons in culture whether 
redistribution of alpha-synuclein during plasticity involves retrograde 
signaling activation through nitric oxide (NO), cGMP, cGMP-dependent protein 
kinase (cGK) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. We have found that 
deletion of the alpha-synuclein gene blocks both the long-lasting enhancement of 
evoked and miniature transmitter release and the increase in the number of 
functional presynaptic boutons evoked through the NO donor, DEA/NO, and the cGMP 
analog, 8-Br-cGMP. In agreement with these findings both DEA/NO and 8-Br-cGMP 
were capable of producing a long-lasting increase in number of clusters for 
alpha-synuclein through activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, cGK and 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha. Thus, our results suggest 
that NO, cGMP, GMP-dependent protein kinase and calmodulin-dependent protein 
kinase II play a key role in the redistribution of alpha-synuclein during 
plasticity.
