BACKGROUND: Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) has been implicated in a number 
of psychiatric diseases along with neurodevelopmental phenotypes such as the 
proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. While there has 
been significant effort directed toward understanding the function of DISC1 
through the determination of its protein-protein interactions within an in vitro 
setting, endogenous interactions involving DISC1 within a cell type-specific 
setting relevant to neural development remain unclear.
METHODS: Using CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) genome engineering technology, we inserted 
an endogenous 3X-FLAG tag at the C-terminus of the canonical DISC1 gene in human 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We further differentiated these cells 
and used affinity purification to determine protein-protein interactions 
involving DISC1 in iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells and astrocytes.
RESULTS: We were able to determine 151 novel cell type-specific proteins present 
in DISC1 endogenous interactomes. The DISC1 interactomes can be clustered into 
several subcomplexes that suggest novel DISC1 cell-specific functions. In 
addition, the DISC1 interactome in iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells 
associates in a connected network containing proteins found to harbor de novo 
mutations in patients affected by schizophrenia and contains a subset of novel 
interactions that are known to harbor syndromic mutations in neurodevelopmental 
disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous DISC1 interactomes within iPSC-derived human neural 
progenitor cells and astrocytes are able to provide context to DISC1 function in 
a cell type-specific setting relevant to neural development and enables the 
integration of psychiatric disease risk factors within a set of defined 
molecular functions.
