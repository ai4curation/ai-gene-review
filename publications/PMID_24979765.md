The Caenorhabditis elegans LSD1 H3K4me2 demethylase SPR-5 reprograms epigenetic 
transcriptional memory during passage through the germ line. Here we show that 
mutants in the H3K9me2 methyltransferase, met-2, result in transgenerational 
epigenetic effects that parallel spr-5 mutants. In addition, we find that 
spr-5;met-2 double mutants have a synergistic effect on sterility, H3K4me2, and 
spermatogenesis expression. These results implicate MET-2 as a second 
histone-modifying enzyme in germ-line reprogramming and suggest a model in which 
SPR-5 and MET-2 function cooperatively to reestablish an epigenetic ground state 
required for the continued immortality of the C. elegans germ line. Without 
SPR-5 and MET-2, we find that the ability to express spermatogenesis genes is 
transgenerationally passed on to the somatic cells of the subsequent generation. 
This indicates that H3K4me2 may act in the maintenance of cell fate. Finally, we 
demonstrate that reducing H3K4me2 causes a large increase in H3K9me2 added by 
the SPR-5;MET-2 reprogramming mechanism. This finding suggests a novel histone 
code interaction in which the input chromatin environment dictates the output 
chromatin state. Taken together, our results provide evidence for a broader 
reprogramming mechanism in which multiple enzymes coordinately regulate histone 
information during passage through the germ line.
