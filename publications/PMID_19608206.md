Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) has been implicated in the regulation of 
glucose and lipid metabolism including actions such as insulin-independent 
glucose transport, glucose transporter 4 expression, and fatty acid utilization 
in skeletal muscle. These effects are similar to the exercise-induced and 
5'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated metabolic 
changes in skeletal muscle, suggesting that caffeine is involved in the 
regulation of muscle metabolism through AMPK activation. We explored whether 
caffeine acts on skeletal muscle to stimulate AMPK. Incubation of rat 
epitrochlearis and soleus muscles with Krebs buffer containing caffeine (> or =3 
mmol/L, > or =15 minutes) increased the phosphorylation of AMPKalpha Thr(172), 
an essential step for full kinase activation, and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 
Ser(79), a downstream target of AMPK, in dose- and time-dependent manners. 
Analysis of isoform-specific AMPK activity revealed that both AMPKalpha1 and 
alpha2 activities increased significantly. This enzyme activation was associated 
with a reduction in phosphocreatine content and an increased rate of 
3-O-methyl-d-glucose transport activity in the absence of insulin. These results 
suggest that caffeine has similar actions to exercise by acutely stimulating 
skeletal muscle AMPK activity and insulin-independent glucose transport with a 
reduction of the intracellular energy status.
