Spindle morphogenesis and dynamics follow an orderly sequence of events coupled 
to the oscillatory activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Using S. 
cerevisiae, we have addressed the requirement of CDK for phosphorylation of the 
spindle midzone component Ase1p and its significance to spindle assembly. Ase1p 
is related to human PRC1, a protein negatively regulated by CDK until late 
mitosis, when it is required for central spindle organization and cytokinesis. 
By contrast, we show here that Ase1p phosphorylation by CDK promotes correct 
spindle assembly. Indeed, Ase1p phosphorylation coincident with spindle assembly 
requires Clb5p, Clb3p and Clb4p. Moreover, in clb5Δ cells, Ase1p recruitment and 
the kinetics of spindle formation were perturbed. These phenotypes were enhanced 
in a cdc28-4 clb5Δ mutant to the extent that midzone disruption resulted in 
transient breaks of the short spindle. By contrast, clb3Δ clb4Δ cells delayed 
spindle assembly downstream to Ase1p recruitment. Expression of Ase1(7D) p that 
mimics the phosphorylated state restored timely recruitment in clb5Δ cells and 
fully rescued the corresponding spindle phenotypes. Finally, Ase1(7D) p 
partially suppressed the spindle assembly delay in clb3Δ clb4Δ cells. Thus, 
Ase1p phosphorylation by CDK promotes the assembly and stability of the mitotic 
spindle. It follows that CDK may differentially alter the functionality of 
members of the Ase1p/PRC1 family to place their distinct roles in their 
respective stage-specific contexts, a further factor of complexity in the 
organization of pathways promoting spindle assembly and dynamics.
