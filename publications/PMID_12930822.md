Loss-of-function mutations in parkin are the major cause of early-onset familial 
Parkinson's disease. To investigate the pathogenic mechanism by which loss of 
parkin function causes Parkinson's disease, we generated a mouse model bearing a 
germline disruption in parkin. Parkin-/- mice are viable and exhibit grossly 
normal brain morphology. Quantitative in vivo microdialysis revealed an increase 
in extracellular dopamine concentration in the striatum of parkin-/- mice. 
Intracellular recordings of medium-sized striatal spiny neurons showed that 
greater currents are required to induce synaptic responses, suggesting a 
reduction in synaptic excitability in the absence of parkin. Furthermore, 
parkin-/- mice exhibit deficits in behavioral paradigms sensitive to dysfunction 
of the nigrostriatal pathway. The number of dopaminergic neurons in the 
substantia nigra of parkin-/- mice, however, is normal up to the age of 24 
months, in contrast to the substantial loss of nigral neurons characteristic of 
Parkinson's disease. Steady-state levels of CDCrel-1, synphilin-1, and 
alpha-synuclein, which were identified previously as substrates of the E3 
ubiquitin ligase activity of parkin, are unaltered in parkin-/- brains. Together 
these findings provide the first evidence for a novel role of parkin in dopamine 
regulation and nigrostriatal function, and a non-essential role of parkin in the 
survival of nigral neurons in mice.
