CTLA-4 and CD28 are differentially expressed on T-cells. They bind to a common 
ligand B71/2 (CD80/86), however with different avidities. Unlike CD28 which 
augments the T-cell response, CTLA-4 operates predominately as a negative 
regulator of T-cell proliferation. The mechanism by which CTLA-4 can generate 
these intracellular signals is unclear. Little is known regarding the identity 
of the protein-tyrosine kinase(s) responsible for CTLA-4 phosphorylation and 
thus creating conditions for the reported binding to PI 3-kinase and the protein 
tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. In this study, we demonstrate that Rlk (resting 
lymphocyte kinase) is capable of phosphorylating CTLA-4 at the YVKM motif. 
Consistent with this finding, Rlk is capable of providing conditions for the 
binding of the SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase to the receptor. CTLA-4 is therefore 
the first known substrate for Rlk suggesting the possibility that this kinase 
may participate in CTLA-4 function.
