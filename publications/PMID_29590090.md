Nutrients, such as amino acids and glucose, signal through the Rag GTPases to 
activate mTORC1. The GATOR1 protein complex-comprising DEPDC5, NPRL2 and 
NPRL3-regulates the Rag GTPases as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAGA; 
loss of GATOR1 desensitizes mTORC1 signalling to nutrient starvation. GATOR1 
components have no sequence homology to other proteins, so the function of 
GATOR1 at the molecular level is currently unknown. Here we used cryo-electron 
microscopy to solve structures of GATOR1 and GATOR1-Rag GTPases complexes. 
GATOR1 adopts an extended architecture with a cavity in the middle; NPRL2 links 
DEPDC5 and NPRL3, and DEPDC5 contacts the Rag GTPase heterodimer. Biochemical 
analyses reveal that our GATOR1-Rag GTPases structure is inhibitory, and that at 
least two binding modes must exist between the Rag GTPases and GATOR1. Direct 
interaction of DEPDC5 with RAGA inhibits GATOR1-mediated stimulation of GTP 
hydrolysis by RAGA, whereas weaker interactions between the NPRL2-NPRL3 
heterodimer and RAGA execute GAP activity. These data reveal the structure of a 
component of the nutrient-sensing mTORC1 pathway and a non-canonical interaction 
between a GAP and its substrate GTPase.
