Abstract

In Arabidopsis, ethylene is perceived by a receptor family consisting of five members, one of these being ETR1. The N-terminal half of ETR1 functions as a signal input domain. The C-terminal region of ETR1, consisting of a His kinase domain and a putative receiver domain, is likely to function in signal output. The role of the proposed signal output region in ethylene signaling was examined in planta. For this purpose, the ability of mutant versions of ETR1 to rescue the constitutive ethylene-response phenotype of the etr1-6;etr2-3;ein4-4 triple loss-of-function mutant line was examined. A truncated version of ETR1 that lacks both the His kinase domain and the receiver domain failed to rescue the triple mutant phenotype. A truncated ETR1 receptor that lacks only the receiver domain restored normal growth to the triple mutant in air, but the transgenic seedlings displayed hypersensitivity to low doses of ethylene. A mutation that eliminated His kinase activity had a modest effect upon the ability of the receptor to repress ethylene responses in air. These results demonstrate that the His kinase domain plays a role in the repression of ethylene responses. The potential roles of the receiver domain and His kinase activity in ethylene signaling are discussed.

DISCUSSION

The function of ethylene receptors in ethylene signal transduction can be considered in terms of their roles in (1) the repression of ethylene responses in the absence of ethylene (in air), and (2) the establishment of ethylene responses in the presence of ethylene. The ethylene receptors do not act alone to regulate ethylene signal transduction, and both genetic and biochemical evidence supports a physical association between ethylene receptors and CTR1 ( Clark et al., 1998 ; Cancel and Larsen, 2002 ; Gao et al., 2003 ). CTR1 is a Raf-like kinase that acts as a negative regulator of ethylene signaling, with loss-of-function mutations in CTR1 resulting in a constitutive ethylene response ( Kieber et al., 1993 ; Huang et al., 2003 ). According to the current model, ethylene receptor/CTR1 signaling complexes are localized to the ER membrane. In air, the kinase domain of CTR1 actively represses ethylene responses. Binding of ethylene by the receptor leads to a conformational change in CTR1 that reduces its kinase activity, thereby relieving repression of the ethylene-response pathway. Higher order ethylene receptor loss-of-function mutations result in a constitutive ethylene-response phenotype ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ), apparently due to the loss of CTR1 from the ER membrane ( Gao et al., 2003 ). Thus, the role of ethylene receptors in air may be achieved by maintaining both the activity and the correct location for action of CTR1, this occurring via their association with CTR1 within the same protein complex. The role of the receptors in establishing ethylene responses upon binding ethylene may be achieved by down-regulating the kinase activity of CTR1, a process that could involve enzymatic and/or allosteric mechanisms.

In this study, we used a triple mutant lacking three members of the ethylene receptor family and analyzed the ability of various mutant forms of ETR1 to rescue the constitutive ethylene-response phenotype found in the triple mutant, focusing on the triple response shown by dark-grown seedlings in response to ethylene. By performing ethylene dose-response analysis on the transgenic lines, we were able to detect subtle deviations from the wild-type ethylene response. Importantly, we observed virtually identical ethylene dose-response curves for multiple independent transgenic lines. The reproducibility of these dose-response curves, despite varying expression levels of the transgenic receptors, indicates that the observed perturbations in ethylene signal transduction are most likely due to the mutations introduced into ETR1.

Analysis of the truncated ETR1(1-349) and ETR1(1-603) receptors in the etr1;etr2;ein4 triple loss-of-function mutant background indicates that the His kinase domain is needed for the role of the receptor in repressing ethylene responses in air. The truncated ETR1(1-349) receptor lacking both His kinase and receiver domains failed to rescue the triple mutant phenotype of dark-grown seedlings in air. In contrast, a truncated ETR1(1-603) receptor lacking only the receiver domain restored normal growth to the triple mutant in air. This result is consistent with a role for the His kinase domain in activation of CTR1. Previous studies indicate that CTR1 can physically associate with the His kinase domain of ETR1 ( Clark et al., 1998 ; Gao et al., 2003 ) and that the interaction between CTR1 and ethylene receptors is required for the ability of CTR1 to repress ethylene responses. The ctr1-8 mutant contains a missense mutation that disrupts the interaction of CTR1 with ethylene receptors, resulting in mislocalization of CTR1 to the cytosol and a constitutive ethylene-response phenotype ( Gao et al., 2003 ; Huang et al., 2003 ). Our data suggest that the His kinase domain of ETR1 may help recruit CTR1 to its site of action. Although His kinase activity of ETR1 is not required for the interaction between ETR1 and CTR1 ( Gao et al., 2003 ), this does not preclude the possibility that the enzymatic activity of ETR1 may play a role in regulating the kinase activity of CTR1.

Although the truncated ETR1(1-603) receptor is able to repress ethylene responses in air, the transgenic seedlings display hypersensitivity to ethylene, suggesting an involvement of the receiver domain in the establishment of ethylene responses. One possible mechanism, based on the ability of the receiver domain of ETR1 to interact with CTR1 ( Clark et al., 1998 ), is that the truncated ETR1(1-603) receptor may not be as effective as the wild-type receptor at maintaining CTR1 in an active state. This could increase the sensitivity of the seedlings to ethylene because CTR1 would be less effective at repressing the ethylene responses. Alternatively, the receiver domain could modulate activity of other potential downstream targets such as CTR1-like proteins ( Tang and Innes, 2002 ; Huang et al., 2003 ) and/or Arabidopsis His-containing phosphotransfer proteins ( Urao et al., 2000 ). Regulation of the receiver domain activity could potentially be elicited by conformational changes, resulting from binding of ethylene to the receptor, or by phosphorylation occurring at the Asp residue within the receiver domain.

Even though the ethylene responses of the triple mutant carrying ETR1(1-603) were perturbed, these transgenic lines still repressed the ethylene response in air and established the response in ethylene. The active receptors in these transgenic lines would include ERS1, ERS2, and ETR1(1-603), none of which contain a receiver domain. Thus, analysis of these transgenic lines suggests that a multistep phosphorelay is not required for ethylene signaling, although it could potentially modulate the signaling kinetics. In a multistep phosphorelay, signal transduction involves phosphorylation upon the conserved His in the His kinase domain of the receptor, subsequent transfer of the phosphate to the receiver domain of the receptor, then phosphotransfer to a separate His-containing phosphotransfer protein, then finally phosphotransfer to the receiver domain of a response regulator ( Schaller et al., 2002 ). It might still be possible, however, for phosphotransfer to occur directly from the His kinase domain of the receptor to the receiver domain of a separate response regulator.

Previous genetic analyses have not revealed a role for the His-kinase activity of ETR1 in ethylene signal transduction ( Gamble et al., 2002 ; Wang et al., 2003 ). Our results are suggestive that the kinase activity of ETR1 may play a role in modulating ethylene signal transduction, because the full-length kinase-inactive ETR1(G2) receptor only partially rescued the etr1;etr2;ein4 triple loss-of-function mutant phenotype. Dose-response curves indicate that the primary perturbation of ETR1(G2) transgenic seedlings is that they are shorter than wild-type seedlings in air, although a slightly increased sensitivity to ethylene is also observed.

The inability of ETR1(G2) to fully rescue growth of the triple mutant in air can be accounted for by two general models that are not mutually exclusive, one based on repression and the other upon hypersensitivity. In the first model, ETR1(G2) is not as effective as the wild-type receptor in the repression of ethylene responses. Repression could occur by several mechanisms. For example, because ETR1 interacts directly with CTR1 ( Clark et al., 1998 ; Gao et al., 2003 ), it is possible that the His kinase activity of ETR1 may modulate CTR1 activity, thereby affecting its ability to repress ethylene responses. It is, however, also possible that the G2 mutation itself could physically affect the interaction between CTR1 and the receptor such that ETR1(G2) is less effective at activating CTR1. Alternatively, the mutant phenotype of the transgenic seedlings could arise from a partial dependence of ETR1 on phosphorylation as part of a two-component signaling system involving a His to Asp phosphorelay mechanism. In the second model, the ETR1(G2) plants are hypersensitive to very low concentrations of ethylene. We included the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethylvinyl-Gly in all assays, but this does not preclude the production of ethylene below readily detectable levels. This model would imply the existence of a mechanism for sensing very low ethylene concentrations, below those normally associated with the triple response, because the ETR1(G2) transgenic seedlings did not show pronounced hypersensitivity to ethylene between 0.01 and 1,000 μ L L −1 ethylene.

Our ability to detect an effect of the kinase-deficient ETR1(G2) on signaling likely arises because of the genetic background employed in these studies. Other studies in which the kinase activity of ETR1 was shown to be dispensable for signaling used as a genetic background either wild type, a single loss-of-function etr1 mutant ( Gamble et al., 2002 ), or a double etr1;ers1 mutant ( Wang et al., 2003 ). None of these backgrounds has as pronounced an effect upon the dark-grown growth of seedlings as does the triple mutant etr1 ; etr2 ; ein4 . It should be noted that the triple mutant background we employed still contains the ethylene receptor ERS1, which, like ETR1, contains all the conserved residues required for His kinase activity ( Gamble et al., 1998 ; Schaller and Kieber, 2002 ). It is also possible that the ers1-2 mutation, previously used in an etr1 ; ers1 background to study the effect of a kinase-deficient version of ETR1 on signaling ( Wang et al., 2003 ), is a hypomorphic allele rather than a complete loss of function. The ers1-2 mutant still produces transcript and, although this transcript contains several additional ATGs in the 5′-untranslated region, the wild-type gene itself contains two ATGs in the 5′-untranslated region, indicating that the upstream ATGs in ers1-2 may still allow for translation and production of the ERS1 receptor ( Gamble et al., 2002 ; Wang et al., 2003 ). Thus, all studies on the role of His kinase activity in signaling, including this one, may have been hampered by residual activity from ERS1. Further studies will be required to determine if the His kinase activity of ETR1 plays a larger role in signaling than that found here.

It has been previously reported that, besides a shift in ethylene sensitivity, the etr1 loss-of-function mutations also lead to enhanced responsiveness to ethylene; mutant seedlings display an exaggerated reduction in hypocotyl length in comparison with wild type ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ; Cancel and Larsen, 2002 ). This exaggerated reduction in hypocotyl length is also seen in higher order mutants such as the etr1;etr2;ein4 triple mutant that we used in our studies. Interestingly, we found that the exaggerated ethylene response was fully reversed by transformation of the triple mutant line with all the mutant versions of ETR1 that we tested, including the truncated receptor ETR1 ( 1-349 ; Fig. 3C ). Thus, all the constructs can rescue a phenotype found in the triple mutant at higher concentrations of ethylene. In addition, when grown in light, rosettes of the triple mutant containing the ETR1 ( 1-349 ) transgene were slightly larger than those of the triple mutant itself, although still substantially smaller than the triple mutant lines containing ETR1-FL , ETR1 ( 1-603 ), and ETR1 ( G2 ), which were wild type in appearance (results not shown). These data suggest that the N-terminal half of the receptor may play some role in modulating plant growth that does not require signal output through the C-terminal domain. Such an effect could be mediated by the GAF domain, which was present in all constructs tested, and for which no function has been yet determined. Alternatively, it could be mediated by the transmembrane ethylene-binding domain that was also present in all constructs, potentially through interactions with other membrane proteins.

etr1-1 is a dominant ethylene-insensitive mutant allele of ETR1 ( Chang et al., 1993 ). Previously, we found that a truncated version of etr1-1 lacking the His kinase domain, etr1-1(1-349), still conferred dominant ethylene insensitivity in both the wild-type and the etr1-7 loss-of-function mutant background ( Gamble et al., 2002 ). Thus, etr1-1(1-349) is able to repress ethylene responses even though it lacks the C-terminal half. We proposed two models that could account for this ability: (1) the etr1-1(1-349) receptor might be directly capable of signal output; or (2) the truncated etr1-1(1-349) receptor might be incapable of signal output, but be able to “convert” other wild-type receptors to an ethylene-insensitive signaling state. Our data here demonstrate that the N-terminal half of the receptor ETR1 is not sufficient for the repression of ethylene responses in air, a result that lends support to the second of the proposed models. On the other hand, we also found a possible role for the N-terminal half of ETR1 in modulating plant responsiveness to higher concentrations of ethylene, which thus leaves open the possibility that the N-terminal half of the receptor may be capable of some signal output independent of the C-terminal half.

In summary, the results described here establish the importance of the proposed signal output region of ETR1 in ethylene signaling. The His kinase domain of the receptor is required for repression of ethylene responses in dark-grown seedlings. The receiver domain is not required for repression of ethylene responses in air but may play a regulatory role in the establishment of ethylene responses. The role of these domains in modulating ethylene signaling is likely to involve their interaction with the Raf-like kinase CTR1 with which the ethylene receptor ETR1 forms a signaling complex ( Clark et al., 1998 ; Gao et al., 2003 ). Although these data confirm a role for the His kinase domain of ETR1 in ethylene signaling, they cannot fully resolve the question as to what role enzymatic activity of this domain may play. The mutant background used for these experiments still contains ERS1 , another member of ethylene receptor subfamily 1, which is predicted to contain His kinase activity. Further analysis of mutant versions of ETR1 in different mutant backgrounds should resolve the role(s) of kinase activity and phosphorylation in ethylene signal transduction.
