The mechanism underlying perforin (PFN)-dependent delivery of apoptotic 
granzymes during cytotoxic cell granule-mediated death remains speculative. 
Granzyme B (GrB) and perforin were found to coexist as multimeric complexes with 
the proteoglycan serglycin (SG) in cytotoxic granules, and cytotoxic cells were 
observed to secrete exclusively macromolecular GrB-SG. Contrary to the view that 
PFN acts as a gateway for granzymes through the plasma membrane, monomeric PFN 
and, strikingly, PFN-SG complexes were shown to mediate cytosolic delivery of 
macromolecular GrB-SG without producing detectable plasma membrane pores. These 
results indicate that granule-mediated apoptosis represents a phenomenon whereby 
the target cell perceives granule contents as a multimeric complex consisting of 
SG, PFN, and granzymes, which are, respectively, the scaffold, translocator, and 
targeting/informational components of this modular delivery system.
