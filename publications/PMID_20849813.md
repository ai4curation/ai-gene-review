Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) are dioxygenases that use oxygen as a co-substrate to 
hydroxylate proline residues. Three PHD isoforms (PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3) have been 
identified in mammalian cells. PHD3 expression is upregulated in some cardiac 
diseases such as cardiomyopathy, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and 
congestive heart failure, all of which are associated with apoptosis. However, 
the role of PHDs in cardiomyocyte apoptosis remains unknown. Here, we have found 
that exposure of embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells to doxorubicin (DOX) 
induced cell apoptosis as evaluated by caspase-3/7 activity, mitochondrial 
membrane potential (Δψm) and cell viability, and that this apoptosis was linked 
to PHD3 upregulation. PHD inhibition or PHD3 silencing substantially ameliorated 
DOX-induced apoptosis, but PHD1 or PHD2 knockdown did not significantly 
influence apoptosis. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments showed that 
PHD3 upregulation reduced the formation of the Bax-Bcl-2 complex, inhibiting the 
anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2. Thus, PHD3 upregulation may be partially 
responsible for DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via its interaction with 
Bcl-2. Inhibition of PHD3 is likely to be cardioprotective against apoptosis in 
some heart disorders.
