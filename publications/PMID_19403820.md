Axonal degeneration is a hallmark of many neurological disorders. Studies in 
animal models of neurodegenerative diseases indicate that axonal degeneration is 
an early event in the disease process, and delaying this process can lead to 
decreased progression of the disease and survival extension. Overexpression of 
the Wallerian degeneration slow (Wld(s)) protein can delay axonal degeneration 
initiated via axotomy, chemotherapeutic agents, or genetic mutations. The Wld(s) 
protein consists of the N-terminal portion of the ubiquitination factor Ube4b 
fused to the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) biosynthetic enzyme 
nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 1 (Nmnat1). We previously 
showed that the Nmnat1 portion of this fusion protein was the critical moiety 
for Wld(s)-mediated axonal protection. Here, we describe the development of an 
automated quantitative assay for assessing axonal degeneration. This method 
successfully showed that Nmnat1 enzymatic activity is important for axonal 
protection as mutants with reduced enzymatic activity lacked axon protective 
activity. We also found that Nmnat enzymes with diverse sequences and structures 
from various species, including Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, and archaebacterium Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, which encodes a 
protein with no homology to eukaryotic Nmnat enzymes, all mediate robust axonal 
protection after axotomy. Besides the importance of Nmnat enzymatic activity, we 
did not observe changes in the steady-state NAD(+) level, and we found that 
inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), which synthesizes 
substrate for Nmnat in mammalian cells, did not affect the protective activity 
of Nmnat1. These results provide the possibility of a role for new Nmnat 
enzymatic activity in axonal protection in addition to NAD(+) synthesis.
