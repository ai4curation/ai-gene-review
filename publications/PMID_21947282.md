DNA methylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation are distinct biochemical 
processes that control gene expression. While DNA methylation is a common 
epigenetic signal that inhibits gene transcription, histone deacetylation 
similarly represses transcription but can be both an epigenetic and 
nonepigenetic phenomenon. Here we report that the histone deacetylase SIRT1 
regulates the activities of DNMT1, a key enzyme responsible for DNA methylation. 
In mass spectrometry analysis, 12 new acetylated lysine sites were identified in 
DNMT1. SIRT1 physically associates with DNMT1 and can deacetylate acetylated 
DNMT1 in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, deacetylation of different lysines on 
DNMT1 has different effects on the functions of DNMT1. For example, 
deacetylation of Lys1349 and Lys1415 in the catalytic domain of DNMT1 enhances 
DNMT1's methyltransferase activity, while deacetylation of lysine residues in 
the GK linker decreases DNMT1's methyltransferase-independent transcriptional 
repression function. Furthermore, deacetylation of all identified acetylated 
lysine sites in DNMT1 abrogates its binding to SIRT1 and impairs its capability 
to regulate cell cycle G(2)/M transition. Finally, inhibition of SIRT1 
strengthens the silencing effects of DNMT1 on the expression of tumor suppressor 
genes ER-α and CDH1 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Together, these results 
suggest that SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of DNMT1 is crucial for DNMT1's

INTRODUCTION

Posttranslational modification of proteins often alters protein function. Common modifications include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, methylation, and acetylation. Acetylation is reversible and occurs on lysine side chains. Histone acetyltransferases such as p300 (KAT3B) and PCAF (KAT2B) add acetyl groups to histones, their canonical substrates, and nonhistone proteins. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups: deacetylation of histones in active chromatin represses transcription, and deacetylation of nonhistone proteins has a variety of functional consequences (e.g., changes in protein stability, DNA binding, and catalytic activities) ( 26 , 39 , 77 ).

The human HDAC family has 18 members, which are grouped into four classes: I, II, III, and IV ( 78 ). The sirtuins (class III) differ from class I, II, and IV HDACs in three respects: they are homologous to yeast Sir2 rather than Rpd3 or Hda1, they require NAD (NAD + ) for activity, and they are refractory to inhibition by the class I and II inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) ( 26 , 61 ). As the founding member of Sir2 proteins (sirtuins), SIRT1 has been implicated in caloric restriction-related longevity, insulin sensitivity, DNA damage, and tumorigenesis. In addition to histones, SIRT1 also deacetylates and functionally modifies numerous proteins, including p53, FOXO3, and NBS1 ( 10 , 28 , 35 , 69 , 80 ).

DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) add methyl groups to the 5′ position of cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotides. Methylated CpG islands interfere with transcription factor binding and recruit repressor complexes ( 13 , 43 ). Actively transcribed DNA is typically hypomethylated; conversely, hypermethylated DNA is silenced. Hypermethylation promotes chromosome instability and tumorigenesis and influences genomic imprinting and chromatin remodeling ( 4 , 5 , 9 , 33 , 34 , 36 , 45 , 46 , 72 ).

The first identified and most abundant and ubiquitous DNMT is DNMT1 ( 6 , 8 , 29 ). DNMT1 is a large protein (185 kDa) that preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA. It consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain, which mediates nuclear localization and targeting to replication foci and discriminates between unmethylated and hemimethylated DNA; a C-terminal catalytic domain; and a central region, which contains a cysteine-rich Zn-binding motif, a polybromo motif, and a series of repeating glycine-lysine dipeptides (the GK linker) ( 7 , 42 , 44 , 67 ). DNMT1 is essential for maintenance of methylation patterns, silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), and cell survival ( 19 ). In addition to methylating DNA, DNMT1 also represses transcription by methylation-independent mechanisms, for example, by recruiting transcription corepressor DNMT1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1), HDAC1, HDAC2, and methyl-CpG-binding protein to DNA ( 25 , 38 , 59 ).

The mechanisms by which DNMT1 controls gene expression have been much explored. However, less is known about the mechanisms that regulate DNMT1 abundance and activity, although a role for posttranslational modification is emerging. Recent studies demonstrate that sumoylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination of DNMT1 may associate with changes in catalytic activity, DNA binding activity, and/or stability ( 21 , 41 , 63 , 81 ). In addition, acetylation of DNMT1 has been suggested in two global proteomics analyses ( 14 , 37 ). The functional significance of DNMT1 acetylation, however, is not known. Here we report acetylation of DNMT1 at 12 lysines in its N- and C-terminal regions and deacetylation of DNMT1 by SIRT1 in vivo and in vitro . Acetylation/deacetylation of DNMT1 changes its enzymatic activity, its capacity to silence TSG expression, and its ability to regulate the cell cycle. These findings reveal a novel cross talk between two important epigenetic effectors, DNMT1 and SIRT1.

DISCUSSION

Given its fundamental importance, the key DNA methyltransferase enzyme, DNMT1, is tightly regulated in mammalian cells. Data presented here show that DNMT1 is an acetylated protein. Proteomics analysis identified 12 acetylated lysines in DNMT1: four in the N-terminal region containing the nuclear localization signal and replication focus targeting domain (Lys160, Lys188, Lys259, and Lys266), six further downstream around the BAH1 and BAH2 domains (Lys749, Lys861, Lys957, Lys961, Lys975, and Lys1054), and two in the C-terminal domain (Lys1349 and Lys1415). These findings extend previous reports showing acetylation of four lysines in the GK linker of DNMT1 (Lys1111, Lys1113, Lys1115, and Lys1117) ( 14 , 37 ).

SIRT1, -6, and -7 are nuclear, and SIRT2 is mostly in the cytoplasm, whereas SIRT3, -4, and -5 are predominantly mitochondrial ( 51 ). Of the nuclear SIRTs, only SIRT1 deacetylated DNMT1. SIRT1 colocalized with DNMT1 in the nucleus, and antibody to SIRT1 coprecipitated DNMT1 and vice versa. SIRT1 deacetylated DNMT1 both in vivo and in vitro , and cells depleted of SIRT1 contained hyperacetylated DNMT1 compared to SIRT1-expressing cells. Thus, SIRT1 physically interacts with and directly deacetylates DNMT1 and is a biologically relevant DNMT1 deacetylase. Our results fit well with previous observation of an association of SIRT1 with DNMT1 and its consequent recruitment to rRNA genes in colon cancer cells ( 20 ). SIRT1, however, is not the only DNMT1 deacetylase. Our results show that the class I/II HDAC inhibitor TSA also increased DNMT1 acetylation, and ectopic expression of HDAC1 and -3 decreased DNMT1 acetylation. Also, a recent study suggests that HDAC1 deacetylates DNMT1 and protects it from proteasomal degradation ( 17 ).

Our results report for the first time that DNMT1 deacetylation by SIRT1 increases its DNA methyltransferase activity and alters its transcription repression function. Previous studies show that different regions of DNMT1 repress transcription by different means. The C terminus of DNMT1 catalyzes the methylation of hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides often present in 5′ regulatory gene regions, which ultimately leads to transcription silencing. In contrast, the N-terminal and central regions recruit transcriptional repressors (DMAP1 and class I/II HDACs, respectively) and direct repressors to DNA and transcription complexes ( 25 , 59 ), although it is controversial whether the methyltransferase-independent mode of transcription repression by DNMT1 is biologically relevant. We show that SIRT1 interacts with and deacetylates lysines in multiple regions of DNMT1 and suggest that SIRT1-mediated deacetylation has multiple, domain-specific consequences. As determined by arginine substitution of specific lysines, deacetylation of the two lysines in the catalytic domain increased the methyltransferase activity of DNMT1, whereas deacetylation of the four lysines in the GK linker reduced the methyltransferase-independent transcription repression activity of DNMT1. These alterations appear to be antagonistic: deacetylation of the catalytic region and increasing methyltransferase activity would presumably turn off gene expression, whereas deacetylation of the GK linker renders DNMT1 less capable of repression and presumably turns on gene expression independent of methyltransferase activity.

There are several possible explanations for these seemingly contradictory effects. First, multiple different domains independently or coordinately regulate the functions of DNMT1. As shown in this study, the overall effect of DNMT1 is also controlled by deacetylation of lysines outside the catalytic domain and GK linker. Second, lysine deacetylation of distinct domains of DNMT1 may occur temporally and spatially and is dependent on cellular text. Not all domains are simultaneously acetylated and deacetylated. Finally, although SIRT1 interacts with the catalytic domain of DNMT1, it does not necessarily deacetylate K1349 and K1415 in the catalytic domain of DNMT1 alone. Because of the low affinity of panantiacetyllysine antibody and the low density of acetylated lysine residues in the catalytic domain, at this time, we could not detect acetylation of the catalytic domain and thereby its possible deacetylation by SIRT1. The generation of an anti-site-specific acetyl antibody in the future will help resolve this issue.

In addition to catalytic and repression activity, we also examined the effects of DNMT1 deacetylation on other functions. Interestingly, not all acetylated lysine on DNMT1 affects obvious biological functions. For example, deacetylation of K188, which is located in the nuclear localization signal sequence, did not alter DNMT1 nuclear localization (data not shown). Further, deacetylation of DNMT1 most likely does not affect its interaction with PCNA (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). We did, however, find that HCT116 cells that are nearly devoid of DNMT1 accumulate in G 2 /M more readily than do wild-type cells. Ectopic expression of wild-type DNMT1 or of the 2KR or DR mutant in DNMT1-KO cells partially prevented G 2 /M accumulation, whereas expression of the 16KR mutant did not. Thus, deacetylation of DNMT1 impairs its ability to rescue cells from DNA damage-induced G 2 /M arrest. These results suggest that the functional consequences of DNMT1 deacetylation extend beyond DNA methylation and gene transcription.

The mechanisms by which DNMT1 inhibits gene expression are complicated and controversial. Methylation of gene promoters and genomic DNA is a well-recognized function of DNMT1; however, whether DNMT1 requires its methyltransferase activity to silence TSGs or to promote cell survival is less clear ( 18 , 52 , 60 , 65 ). For example, knockdown of DNMT1 in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells reactivated estrogen receptor expression without affecting DNA methylation. Discrepancies in the literature may reflect an incomplete elimination of DNMT1 from cells; complete genomic depletion of DNMT1 resulted in cell death ( 12 , 31 , 47 , 66 ), whereas knockdown of DNMT1 in another study did not significantly affect genomic 5-methylcytosine content or CpG methylation of TSGs ( 57 , 65 ). In fact, we did not find apparent changes in 5′-methylcytosine content of the whole genome in HCT116 DNMT1-knockout cells transfected with wild-type or mutant DNMT1 (data not shown). As a result, we did not examine DNA methylation of CpG islands on specific gene promoters in cells expressing wild-type DNMT1 or DNMT1 mutants.

It is commonly believed that DNA methylation is tightly linked to other epigenetic signals, particularly histone deacetylation. For example, HDAC1 and HDAC2 complex with the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 ( 53 ). Like histone deacetylation, high levels of methyl-CpG DNA correlate with transcriptional inactivity. Also, hyperacetylated histones are found on hypomethylated CpG islands ( 64 ). Indeed, in one study, synergy of demethylation and histone deacetylase inhibition was found in the reexpression of genes silenced in cancer ( 11 ). The results presented here suggest that SIRT1 may regulate gene transcription independently of its classic role in histone deacetylation. Conceivably, as a protein deacetylase, SIRT1 deacetylates histones to maintain transcriptionally repressive chromatin and simultaneously functions in transcription repression through deacetylation of nonhistones.

In summary, we show that DNMT1 is acetylated at multiple lysines and that SIRT1 deacetylates DNMT1 in vitro and in vivo . Deacetylation of DNMT1 at specific lysines enhanced its methyltransferase activity, changed its transcription repression activity and cell cycle regulatory function, and impaired its capacity to silence TSGs. In contrast to class I HDACs, which boost the silencing effect of DNMT1 by chromatin modification or stabilization of DNMT1 ( 59 , 81 ), SIRT1 directly modifies DNMT1 activity. Our study provides new insight into the posttranslational regulation of DNMT1 function and the functional diversity of SIRT1 in gene silencing.
