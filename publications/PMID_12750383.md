Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder that predisposes affected 
individuals to cancer development. The affected gene, WRN, encodes an RecQ 
homologue whose precise biological function remains elusive. Altered DNA 
recombination is a hallmark of WS cells suggesting that WRN plays an important 
role in these pathways. Here we report a novel physical and functional 
interaction between WRN and the homologous recombination mediator protein RAD52. 
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses show that WRN and RAD52 
form a complex in vivo that co-localizes in foci associated with arrested 
replication forks. Biochemical studies demonstrate that RAD52 both inhibits and 
enhances WRN helicase activity in a DNA structure-dependent manner, whereas WRN 
increases the efficiency of RAD52-mediated strand annealing between non-duplex 
DNA and homologous sequences contained within a double-stranded plasmid. These 
results suggest that coordinated WRN and RAD52 activities are involved in 
replication fork rescue after DNA damage.
