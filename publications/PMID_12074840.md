Metabolism of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is closely associated with the 
pathology and etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since neprilysin is the only 
rate-limiting catabolic peptidase proven by reverse genetics to participate in 
Abeta metabolism in vivo, we performed detailed immunohistochemical analysis of 
neprilysin in mouse brain using neprilysin-deficient mice as a negative control. 
The aim was to assess, at both the cellular and subcellular levels, where Abeta 
undergoes neprilysin-dependent degradation in the brain and how neprilysin 
localization relates to Abeta pathology in amyloid precursor protein 
(APP)-transgenic mice. In hippocampus, neprilysin was present in the stratum 
pyramidale and stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1-3 fields and the 
molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Confocal double immunofluorescence 
analyses revealed the subcellular localization of neprilysin along axons and at 
synapses. This observation suggests that after synthesis in the soma, 
neprilysin, a type II membrane-associated protein, is axonally transported to 
the terminals, where Abeta degradation is likely to take place. Among various 
cell types, GABAergic and metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor-positive neurons 
but not catecholaminergic or cholinergic neurons, expressed neprilysin in 
hippocampus and neocortex, implying the presence of a cell type-specific 
mechanism that regulates neprilysin gene expression. As expected, Abeta 
deposition correlated inversely with neprilysin expression in TgCRND8 
APP-transgenic mice. These observations not only support the notion that 
neprilysin functions as a major Abeta-degrading enzyme in the brain but also 
suggest that down-regulation of neprilysin activity, which may be caused by 
aging, is likely to elevate local concentrations of Abeta at and around neuronal 
synapses.
