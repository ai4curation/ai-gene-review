P53 is renowned as a cellular tumor suppressor poised to instigate remedial 
responses to various stress insults that threaten DNA integrity. P53 levels and 
activities are kept under tight regulation involving a complex network of 
activators and inhibitors, which determine the type and extent of p53 growth 
inhibitory signaling. Within this complexity, the p53-Mdm2 negative 
auto-regulatory loop serves as a major route through which intra- and 
extra-cellular stress signals are channeled to appropriate p53 responses. Mdm2 
inhibits p53 transcriptional activities and through its E3 ligase activity 
promotes p53 proteasomal degradation either within the nucleus or following 
nuclear export. Upon exposure to stress signals these actions of Mdm2 have to be 
moderated, or even interrupted, in order to allow sufficient p53 to accumulate 
in an active form. Multiple mechanisms involving a variety of factors have been 
demonstrated to mediate this interruption. C-Abl is a critical factor that under 
physiological conditions is required for the maximal and efficient accumulation 
of active p53 in response to DNA damage. C-Abl protects p53 by antagonizing the 
inhibitory effect of Mdm2, an action that requires a direct interplay between 
c-Abl and Mdm2. In addition, c-Abl protects p53 from other inhibitors of p53, 
such as the HPV-E6/E6AP complex, that inhibits and degrades p53 in HPV-infected 
cells. Surprisingly, the oncogenic form of c-Abl, the Bcr-Abl fusion protein in 
CML cells, also promotes the accumulation of wt p53. However, in contrast to the 
activation of p53 by c-Abl, its oncogenic form, Bcr-Abl, counteracts the growth 
inhibitory activities of p53 by modulating the p53-Mdm2 loop. Thus, it appears 
that by modulating the p53-Mdm2 loop, c-Abl and its oncogenic forms critically 
determine the type and extent of the cellular response to DNA damage.
