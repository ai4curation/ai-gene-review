AIMS: The BolA protein family is widespread among eukaryotes and bacteria. In 
Escherichia coli, BolA causes a spherical cell shape and is overexpressed during 
oxidative stress. Here we aim to elucidate the possible role of its human 
homolog BOLA1 in mitochondrial morphology and thiol redox potential regulation.
RESULTS: We show that BOLA1 is a mitochondrial protein that counterbalances the 
effect of L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO)-induced glutathione (GSH) 
depletion on the mitochondrial thiol redox potential. Furthermore, 
overexpression of BOLA1 nullifies the effect of BSO and S-nitrosocysteine on 
mitochondrial morphology. Conversely, knockdown of the BOLA1 gene increases the 
oxidation of mitochondrial thiol groups. Supporting a role of BOLA1 in 
controlling the mitochondrial thiol redox potential is that BOLA1 orthologs only 
occur in aerobic eukaryotes. A measured interaction of BOLA1 with the 
mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5 provides hints for potential 
mechanisms behind BOLA1's effect on mitochondrial redox potential. Nevertheless, 
we have no direct evidence for a role of GLRX5 in BOLA1's function.
INNOVATION: We implicate a new protein, BOLA1, in the regulation of the 
mitochondrial thiol redox potential.
CONCLUSION: BOLA1 is an aerobic, mitochondrial protein that prevents 
mitochondrial morphology aberrations induced by GSH depletion and reduces the 
associated oxidative shift of the mitochondrial thiol redox potential.

Introduction

D isbalance of the cellular redox potential has been implicated in normal aging and in aging-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes. To identify new proteins involved in the defense against such disbalance and/or its consequences, we have analyzed the role of human BolA homolog 1 (BOLA1), a protein whose bacterial homolog (BolA) is upregulated under oxidative stress conditions. The BolA protein family was originally described in Escherichia coli , where overexpression of the protein induces a spherical cell shape ( 2 ). In human and yeast, the BolA protein family has three members, BolA homolog 1, 2, and 3. The eukaryotic representatives of the BolA protein family appear derived from the proteobacteria ( 10 ) and presumably have resulted from the endosymbiosis of an α-proteobacterium that became the mitochondrion. BolA has been mainly studied in E. coli , where its gene is upregulated under stress ( 31 ) and is under control of the transcription regulator RpoS that is induced in the stationary phase and other general stress conditions ( 28 ). BolA in E. coli is involved in the regulation of cell wall proteins PBP5, PBP6, and AmpC ( 32 ), but its exact molecular function remains unknown. Comparative genomics analyses have pointed to an interaction of BolA with monothiol glutaredoxins, based on gene order conservation ( 16 ), phylogenetic distribution ( 16 ), and a physical interaction between BolA homolog 2 and Grx3/4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( 14 , 17 ) and Drosophila melanogaster ( 11 ).

BolA homolog 2 has been shown to be cytoplasmic in S. cerevisiae and to interact with the cytoplasmic monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3 and Grx4 ( 23 ). In S. cerevisiae , it has been named Fra2 and, together with Grx3/4 and another protein (Fra1), is involved in regulation of the iron regulon via the nucleoplasmatic shuttling of the transcription factor Aft1 ( 23 ). BOLA3 has recently been implicated in the biogenesis of [Fe-S] clusters for oxidative phosphorylation complexes and 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase enzymes in mitochondria ( 6 ).

Little experimental data are available on the function of Bola homolog 1. BOLA1 has been observed to be overexpressed in mononuclear cells of female patients with chronic fatigue syndrome ( 12 ), but that observation could not be reproduced in a systematic study ( 4 ). Here we set out to examine the function of BOLA1, with specific emphasis on its role in regulating mitochondrial morphology.

Discussion

To date, experimental data on the biological function of BOLA1 are lacking. Here we show that BOLA1 is a mitochondrial protein that, in agreement with comparative genomics analyses, appears to interact with the mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5. Recent work in human ( 5 ) and zebrafish ( 39 ) has linked GLRX5 deficiency to decreased haem synthesis in erythroid cells, and it has been linked to protection against oxidative stress in osteoblasts ( 26 ). It has a single glutaredoxin domain, and although it can reduce GSH mixed disulfides, it does so at a rate 100 times lower than the dithiol glutaredoxin GLRX2 ( 18 ). Furthermore Grx5 in S. cerevisiae is only inefficiently reduced by GSH ( 34 ). One explanation for the low catalytic efficiency of Grx5 and GLRX5 is that they interact with a protein that increases the rate at which they reduce GSH mixed disulfides and/or at which they are reduced by GSH. Here we provide first evidence that BOLA1 might exert such a role and that one of the target proteins of the BOLA1/GLRX5 complex is involved in maintaining the normal mitochondrial shape. It should thereby be noted that, although BolA's 3D structure is similar to that of the bacterial reductase OsmC, suggesting a reducing activity of BolA itself, BolA1 does not contain any conserved cysteines, rendering any reducing function dependent on an external source of reducing equivalents ( 16 ).

Knockdown of endogenous BOLA1 significantly increased the amount of oxidized mito-roGFP1. Because mito-roGFP1 senses the redox potential of the mitochondrial GSH buffer, this indicates that BOLA1 plays a role in keeping this buffer in a reduced state. As evidence has been provided that glutaredoxins act as mediators of reversible electron flow between GSH and mito-roGFP1 ( 27 ), changes in the affinity of a glutaredoxin toward GSH and/or its endogenous protein substrates might lead to alterations in the degree of oxidation of these latter molecules. Conversely, when fibroblasts were treated with BSO to decrease the amount of GSH, BOLA1 overexpression attenuated the BSO-induced increase in mito-roGFP1 oxidation without interfering with the BSO-induced decrease in GSH. These observations are compatible with a model in which the observed physical interaction between BOLA1 and GLRX5 leads to an increase in GLRX5 activity and, therewith, to maintenance of the reduced state of mito-roGFP1 at decreased GSH concentrations. Nevertheless, GLRX5 protein levels do not depend on BOLA1 expression, and we have no direct evidence that BOLA1's effect on mitochondrial morphology and thiol redox potential depends on an interaction with GLRX5.

We provide a first indication for a possible physiological role of BOLA1. Both BSO and SNOC caused a marked decrease in mitochondrial length and degree of branching, which was completely prevented by overexpression of BOLA1. The effect of BOLA1 was mimicked by DTT, indicating that a putative target protein of the BOLA1 has to be in the reduced state to perform its effect. Our observation that BOLA1 could also prevent the SNOC-induced change in the mitochondrial shape can be explained by a SNOC-induced increased oxidation of GSH, thus reducing the amount of GSH available, for example, for GLRX5, to keep the putative target protein in the reduced state. SNOC has been shown to cause a fragmented mitochondrial phenotype, in part, through S-nitrosylation of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 ( 7 ). Here we show that BSO treatment did not alter the amount of mitochondria per cell, suggesting mitochondrial shrinkage rather than fragmentation. The effect of SNOC on the mitochondrial shape was completely reversed by overexpression of BOLA1. An alternative explanation, that BOLA1 would directly prevent SNOC-induced S-nitrosylation of Drp1, rather than reduce the effect of SNOC-induced increase of GSH oxidation, remains to be established. This might be of critical importance because beta-amyloid protein found in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease was found to induce S-nitrosylation of Drp1 and S-nitrosylated Drp1 was shown to be increased in brains of these patients, suggesting that S-nitrosylation of Drp1 might contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration ( 7 ).

In bacterial operons, BolA tends to occur not only with a monothiol glutaredoxin, but also with proteins involved in defense against oxidative stress: glutathione-S-transferase and Toluene exporters ( 16 ). We found, however, no evidence for upregulation of BOLA1 under conditions of oxidative stress in human gene expression data ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Nor did we detect increased oxidation of HEt, which measures superoxides, in BOLA1 knockdowns, suggesting that BOLA1 is specific for thiol oxidation. Alternatively, to directly affecting the thiol oxidation state of target proteins, BOLA1 could have an indirect effect, for example, by being involved in the assembly of Fe-S clusters, like its mitochondrial paralog BOLA3 ( 6 ). Interactions between Grx5 and the Fe-S assembly protein ISA1 have been measured in S. cerevisiae ( 36 ) and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( 19 ), implicating Grx5 in Fe-S assembly, and GLRX5 has been implicated in Fe-S cluster assembly in human erythroblasts ( 41 ). The nonassembly of Fe-S clusters in mitochondria will lead to free iron, which via Fenton chemistry can lead to the formation of hydroxyl radicals, and therewith to increased oxidation of biomolecules. The increased thiol redox potential that we observe in BOLA1 knockdowns could thus be an indirect effect of the inability to assemble Fe-S clusters. Also, a fusion protein of BolA1 and the chloroplastic Fe-S assembly protein SufE in plants ( 40 ) argue for a role of BolA1 in Fe-S assembly or repair. Nevertheless, mitochondrial Fe-S assembly proteins, including Grx5 ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ) have a wider phylogenetic distribution than only aerobic species. BolA1's strictly aerobic genomic occurrence, its reducing effect on the mitochondrial thiol redox potential, its interaction with Grx5 and the role in Fe-S assembly of the latter, suggest that BolA1 functions by increasing an aspect of Grx5's activity in Fe-S assembly or another process that is specifically required under aerobic, thiol-oxidizing conditions.
