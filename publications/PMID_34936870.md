Chronic pain is a prevalent medical problem, and its molecular basis remains 
poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the significance of the transmembrane 
protein (Tmem) 160 for nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. An extensive 
behavioral assessment suggests a pain modality- and entity-specific phenotype in 
male Tmem160 global knockout (KO) mice: delayed establishment of tactile 
hypersensitivity and alterations in self-grooming after nerve injury. In 
contrast, Tmem160 seems to be dispensable for other nerve injury-induced pain 
modalities, such as non-evoked and movement-evoked pain, and for other pain 
entities. Mechanistically, we show that global KO males exhibit dampened 
neuroimmune signaling and diminished TRPA1-mediated activity in cultured dorsal 
root ganglia. Neither these changes nor altered pain-related behaviors are 
observed in global KO female and male peripheral sensory neuron-specific KO 
mice. Our findings reveal Tmem160 as a sexually dimorphic factor contributing to 
the establishment, but not maintenance, of discrete nerve injury-induced pain 
behaviors in male mice.
