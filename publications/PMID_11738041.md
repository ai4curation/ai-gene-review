BACKGROUND: Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) sequentially phosphorylates four 
serine residues on glycogen synthase (GS), in the sequence 
SxxxSxxxSxxx-SxxxS(p), by recognizing and phosphorylating the first serine in 
the sequence motif SxxxS(P) (where S(p) represents a phosphoserine). FRATtide (a 
peptide derived from a GSK-3 binding protein) binds to GSK-3 and blocks GSK-3 
from interacting with Axin. This inhibits the Axin-dependent phosphorylation of 
beta-catenin by GSK-3.
RESULTS: Structures of uncomplexed Tyr216 phosphorylated GSK-3beta and of its 
complex with a peptide and a sulfate ion both show the activation loop adopting 
a conformation similar to that in the phosphorylated and active forms of the 
related kinases CDK2 and ERK2. The sulfate ion, adjacent to Val214 on the 
activation loop, represents the binding site for the phosphoserine residue on 
'primed' substrates. The peptide FRATtide forms a helix-turn-helix motif in 
binding to the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain; the FRATtide binding site 
is close to, but does not obstruct, the substrate binding channel of GSK-3. 
FRATtide (and FRAT1) does not inhibit the activity of GSK-3 toward GS.
CONCLUSIONS: The Axin binding site on GSK-3 presumably overlaps with that for 
FRATtide; its proximity to the active site explains how Axin may act as a 
scaffold protein promoting beta-catenin phosphorylation. Tyrosine 216 
phosphorylation can induce an active conformation in the activation loop. 
Pre-phosphorylated substrate peptides can be modeled into the active site of the 
enzyme, with the P1 residue occupying a pocket partially formed by 
phosphotyrosine 216 and the P4 phosphoserine occupying the 'primed' binding 
site.
