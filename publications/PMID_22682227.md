Ferroportin exports iron into plasma from absorptive enterocytes, 
erythrophagocytosing macrophages, and hepatic stores. The hormone hepcidin 
controls cellular iron export and plasma iron concentrations by binding to 
ferroportin and causing its internalization and degradation. We explored the 
mechanism of hepcidin-induced endocytosis of ferroportin, the key molecular 
event in systemic iron homeostasis. Hepcidin binding caused rapid ubiquitination 
of ferroportin in cell lines overexpressing ferroportin and in murine bone 
marrow-derived macrophages. No hepcidin-dependent ubiquitination was observed in 
C326S ferroportin mutant which does not bind hepcidin. Substitutions of lysines 
between residues 229 and 269 in the third cytoplasmic loop of ferroportin 
prevented hepcidin-dependent ubiquitination and endocytosis of ferroportin, and 
promoted cellular iron export even in the presence of hepcidin. The human 
ferroportin mutation K240E, previously associated with clinical iron overload, 
caused hepcidin resistance in vitro by interfering with ferroportin 
ubiquitination. Our study demonstrates that ubiquitination is the functionally 
relevant signal for hepcidin-induced ferroportin endocytosis.
