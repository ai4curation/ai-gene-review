The association of cdk4 with D-type cyclins to form functional kinase complexes 
is comparatively inefficient. This has led to the suggestion that assembly might 
be a regulated step. In this report we demonstrate that the CDK inhibitors 
p21(CIP), p27(KIP), and p57(KIP2) all promote the association of cdk4 with the 
D-type cyclins. This effect is specific and does not occur with other cdk 
inhibitors or cdk-binding proteins. Both in vivo and in vitro, the abundance of 
assembled cdk4/cyclin D complex increases directly with increasing inhibitor 
levels. The promotion of assembly is not attributable to a simple cell cycle 
block and requires the function of both the cdk and cyclin-binding domains. 
Kinetic studies demonstrate that p21 and p27 lead to a 35- and 80-fold increase 
in K(a), respectively, mostly because of a decrease in K(off). At low 
concentrations, p21 promotes the assembly of active kinase complexes, whereas at 
higher concentrations, it inhibits activity. Moreover, immunodepletion 
experiments demonstrate that most of the active cdk4-associated kinase activity 
also associates with p21. To confirm these results in a natural setting, we 
examine the assembly of endogenous complexes in mammary epithelial cells after 
release from a G(0) arrest. In agreement with our other data, cyclin D1 and p21 
bind concomitantly to cdk4 during the in vivo assembly of cdk4/cyclin D1 
complexes. This complex assembly occurs in parallel to an increase in cyclin 
D1-associated kinase activity. Immunodepletion experiments demonstrate that most 
of the cellular cyclin D1-associated kinase activity is also p21 associated. 
Finally, we find that all three CIP/KIP inhibitors target cdk4 and cyclin D1 to 
the nucleus. We suggest that in addition to their roles as inhibitors, the p21 
family of proteins, originally identified as inhibitors, may also have roles as 
adaptor proteins that assemble and program kinase complexes for specific 
functions.
