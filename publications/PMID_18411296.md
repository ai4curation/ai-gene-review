Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a bacterial pathogen of the human respiratory tract 
that causes a wide range of airway diseases as well as extrapulmonary symptoms. 
It possesses a distinct, differentiated terminal structure, termed the 
attachment organelle, that mediates adherence to the host respiratory 
epithelium. Previously, we reported that surface-associated M. pneumoniae 
elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu, also called MPN665) serves as a fibronectin 
(Fn)-binding protein, facilitating interactions between mycoplasmas and 
extracellular matrix. In the present study, we determined that binding of M. 
pneumoniae EF-Tu to Fn is primarily mediated by the EF-Tu carboxyl region. A 
179-amino-acid region spanning the carboxyl terminus (designated EC; amino acids 
192 to 394) binds Fn in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis of carboxyl 
constructs (ED3 and ED4) and their deletion truncations (ED3.1, ED3.2, and 
ED4.1) revealed that the carboxyl region possessed two distinct sites with 
different Fn-binding efficiencies. Immunogold electron microscopy using 
antibodies raised against recombinant ED3 and ED4 demonstrated the surface 
accessibility of the EF-Tu carboxyl region. Competitive binding assays using 
intact radiolabeled mycoplasmas and purified recombinant ED3 and ED4 proteins, 
along with antibody blocking assays, reinforced the role of the surface-exposed 
EF-Tu carboxyl region in Fn binding. Alkali and high-salt treatment of 
mycoplasma membranes and Triton X-114-partitioned mycoplasma fractions confirmed 
the stable association of EF-Tu within the mycoplasma membrane. These 
observations highlight the unique, multifaceted, and unpredictable role of the 
classically defined cytoplasmic protein EF-Tu relative to cellular function, 
compartmentalization, and topography.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a bacterial pathogen of the human respiratory tract that causes a wide range of airway diseases as well as extrapulmonary symptoms. It possesses a distinct, differentiated terminal structure, termed the attachment organelle, that mediates adherence to the host respiratory epithelium. Previously, we reported that surface-associated M. pneumoniae elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu, also called MPN665) serves as a fibronectin (Fn)-binding protein, facilitating interactions between mycoplasmas and extracellular matrix. In the present study, we determined that binding of M. pneumoniae EF-Tu to Fn is primarily mediated by the EF-Tu carboxyl region. A 179-amino-acid region spanning the carboxyl terminus (designated EC; amino acids 192 to 394) binds Fn in a dose-dependent manner.

DISCUSSION

In this study we characterized the regions of M. pneumoniae EF-Tu that interact with Fn. We determined that Fn binding by EF-Tu is primarily mediated by the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 192 to 394; recombinant peptides ED3 and ED4) (Fig. 2 ), which includes the well-described EF-Tu domains 2 and 3 (amino acids 209 to 394) involved in interactions with macromolecular ligands during the translation process ( 31 ). In contrast, EN (amino acids 1 to 215) and its truncation ED2 (Fig. 2 ), which correspond to domain 1 (amino acids 1 to 200) and are involved in binding GTP ( 31 ), exhibited minimal Fn-binding properties. Based on our experimental data using deletion truncations, EF-Tu possessed two Fn-interacting regions in the carboxyl terminus with different binding properties. One Fn-binding region included amino acids 192 to 292 (Fig. 3 , ED3.1), and the other Fn-binding region included amino acids 314 to 394 (Fig. 3 , ED4.1). Amino acids 192 to 214 contributed to maximum Fn binding, as observed by the deletion of these 23 amino acids from ED3.1 (i.e., truncation ED3.2) (Fig. 3A ) which decreased binding to Fn by ∼50% (Fig. 3C ). However, these 23 amino acids by themselves do not appear to directly mediate Fn interactions, since ED2 alone (amino acids 91 to 215) (Fig. 3A ) exhibited minimal Fn binding (Fig. 2 ). Of interest are the amino acids EDT (216 to 218) that follow the 23 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus. Amino acids EDT belong to a larger motif that mediates Fn binding in several MSCRAMM FnBPs ( 13 , 51 ). Interestingly, ED3, ED3.1, and ED3.2 possess the EDT motif, although ED3.2 exhibits reduced Fn binding. In ED3 and ED3.1, EDT is preceded by 192 to 215 amino acids, and Fn binding is enhanced. In contrast, ED2, regardless of possessing these 23 amino acids, lacks EDT and exhibits negligible Fn-binding ability. Hence, the 23 amino acids plus the EDT motif appear essential for efficient EF-Tu-Fn interactions.

The second carboxyl-terminal Fn-interacting region of EF-Tu is located within ED4 (amino acids 292 to 394) and ED4.1 (amino acids 314 to 394) (Fig. 3 ). This region revealed no significant homologies to any conserved motifs identified in other FnBPs. Several sequence and organizational variations have been reported as motifs in Fn-binding bacterial proteins. For example, in staphylococci and streptococci, the primary Fn-binding site is localized to unstructured repeats of 35 to 40 residues, and a secondary Fn-binding site lies outside of the carboxyl-terminal repeats ( 51 ). Further, FnBPs like the Fn attachment protein family in mycobacteria consist of two noncontiguous regions of four amino acids ( 58 ), and Campylobacter jejuni CadF consists of a single Fn-binding domain of four amino acids ( 30 ). Overall, M. pneumoniae EF-Tu lacks the recognizable motifs and repeats associated with other FnBPs, indicating the existence of alternative sequence-independent and conformational properties that mediate Fn interactions.

The existence of two Fn-binding regions within the carboxyl terminus of M. pneumoniae EF-Tu was unexpected and led us to predict that more than one recognition site on Fn served as a target for EF-Tu. Like a majority of FnBPs ( 26 , 42 ), EF-Tu FL and its carboxyl truncations exhibited significant interaction with the N-terminal 30-kDa type I fibrin-heparin-binding region (Fig. 4A and B ). Also, the carboxyl region of EF-Tu interacted with the C-terminal 40-kDa type II heparin-binding domain. Similar interactions have been observed with some FnBPs ( 9 , 36 ). ED3 interacted specifically with the 120-kDa cell-binding domain. Thus, M. pneumoniae EF-Tu has at least two Fn-interacting regions, and these two regions recognize common as well as specific domains on Fn. Interestingly, EF-Tu FL did not recognize the 40- or 120-kDa Fn domains (Fig. 4B ), suggesting that in recombinant EF-Tu FL, the ED3 and ED4 sites are unavailable for Fn binding. Clearly, the contribution of EF-Tu and its potential impact on mycoplasma airway colonization and internalization via Fn-binding dynamics need to be further investigated.

Using Triton X-114, we demonstrated the presence of EF-Tu in all mycoplasma fractions (Fig. 5A ). Similar studies with Triton X-100 identified M. pneumoniae EF-Tu as a major component of the insoluble cytoskeleton fraction ( 46 ). The inability to remove membrane-associated EF-Tu with alkali or high-salt treatments (Fig. 5B ) lends credence to its strong membrane association. While M. pneumoniae membrane-localized EF-Tu was reported to be trypsin sensitive ( 17 ), competitive ELISAs using recombinant ED3 and ED4 and antibody blocking assays with antisera generated against ED3 and ED4 proved conclusively that the Fn-interacting carboxyl terminus is surface exposed. Antiserum generated against EF-Tu FL exhibited blocking consistent with our previous report ( 17 ). Immunoelectron microscopy results further supported the surface accessibility of the EF-Tu carboxyl terminus (Fig. 6 ).

Despite the classification of EF-Tu as a cytosolic protein, we have shown that EF-Tu can relocate to the mycoplasma membrane surface with an exposed carboxyl terminus to facilitate Fn binding. While there are other reports that document the presence of cytosolic proteins, including EF-Tu, on surfaces of different bacteria, important questions regarding how these proteins translocate to the surface remain unanswered, especially since conventional secretion or anchoring signals are absent. Physiological factors, including osmotic stress, have been implicated in E. coli EF-Tu association with the periplasm, and other possible mechanisms for export of cytosolic proteins have been described ( 50 ), including the impact of posttranslational modifications ( 7 ).

Attachment and colonization of target tissues by M. pneumoniae and other microbial pathogens are prerequisites for successful infection and disease progression. While adherence of virulent M. pneumoniae is primarily mediated by adhesins, like P1 ( 24 ), the absence of this protein ( 21 , 32 ) still permits weak adherence. Furthermore, monospecific antibodies against P1 inhibit attachment of virulent M. pneumoniae to the respiratory epithelium by a maximum of 75% ( 3 ), further suggesting the involvement of other adhesin-like proteins, as well as alternate mechanisms of mycoplasma binding to host cells. Fn is an abundant and available pathogen target, as earlier noted; it exists in soluble form in blood fluids and plasma and in fibrillar form in ECM. As ECM underlies the epithelial and endothelial cells and surrounds connective tissue, mycoplasmas could readily access ECM following epithelial damage. Events following M. pneumoniae cytadherence have been studied in infected hamster tracheal organ cultures and include inhibition of respiratory cell macromolecular synthesis, followed by characteristic ciliostasis, cytoplasmic and nuclear vacuolization, and extensive epithelial cell fragmentation and sloughing ( 11 , 12 ). Recently, we described the role of a unique ADP-ribosylating and vacuolating M. pneumoniae toxin (annotated MPN372) in eliciting the characteristic cytopathology associated with mycoplasma infection ( 28 ). Interestingly, this toxin is surface associated and binds selectively to human lung surfactant protein A ( 29 ). Thus, in association with toxin-mediated epithelial cell damage, M. pneumoniae could also directly access subepithelial tissue targets and ECM by multiple pathways, including EF-Tu interactions with Fn. Further, these distinct pathogenic pathways may also contribute to the ability of M. pneumoniae to invade and establish intracellular and perinuclear residence ( 15 , 56 ). Taken together, these findings indicate that M. pneumoniae is a sophisticated and versatile bacterial pathogen with wide-ranging colonization strategies to overcome host defenses and trigger acute and chronic airway and extrapulmonary diseases.
