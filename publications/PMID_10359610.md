Eukaryotic cells actively block entry into mitosis in the presence of DNA damage 
or incompletely replicated DNA. This response is mediated by signal transduction 
cascades called cell cycle checkpoints. We show here that the human checkpoint 
control protein hRAD9 physically associates with two other checkpoint control 
proteins, hRAD1 and hHUS1. Furthermore, hRAD1 and hHUS1 themselves interact, 
analogously to their fission yeast homologues Rad1 and Hus1. We also show that 
hRAD9 is present in multiple phosphorylation forms in vivo. These phosphorylated 
forms are present in tissue culture cells that have not been exposed to 
exogenous sources of DNA damage, but it remains possible that endogenous damage 
or naturally occurring replication intermediates cause the observed 
phosphorylation. Finally, we show that hRAD9 is a nuclear protein, indicating 
that in this signal transduction pathway, hRAD9 is physically proximal to the 
upstream (DNA damage) signal rather than to the downstream, cytoplasmic, cell 
cycle machinery.
