Bax, a member of Bcl-2 family, plays an essential role in apoptotic pathways 
induced by a number of apoptotic stimulus. In a search for new potential binding 
partners of Bax, we identified the receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1) by 
a yeast two-hybrid assay. We demonstrated that RACK1 interacts with Bax through 
its BH3 domain both in vitro and in vivo. Using immunostaining and 
immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that RACK1 colocalizes with Bax 
oligomers and promotes Bax oligomerization both in vitro and in vivo. 
Furthermore, we observed that RACK1 also interacts with Bcl-XL, an 
anti-apoptotic protein associated with Bax. Interestingly, the Bcl-XL/Bax 
interaction is decreased when RACK1 is overexpressed, but is increased when 
RACK1 is depleted, suggesting RACK1 disrupts the association of Bax and Bcl-XL. 
In addition, we found that overexpression of RACK1 promotes UV-induced 
apoptosis, while knocking down RACK1 inhibits the effects. Together, these 
results indicate that RACK1 promotes apoptosis by promoting Bax oligomerization 
and dissociating the complex of Bax and Bcl-XL.
