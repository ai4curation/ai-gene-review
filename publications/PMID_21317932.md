It has been suggested that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK) and 12 AMPK-related kinases (ARK), including novel (nua) kinase family 1 
(NUAK1), are activated by master kinase LKB1, a major tumor suppressor. Apart 
from evidence to suggest that NUAK1 participates in induction of tumor survival, 
invasion and p53-independent cellular senescence, its detailed biological 
functions remain unclear. Here we showed that in the presence of wild-type LKB1, 
NUAK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates p53 in vitro and in vivo. The 
phosphorylation of p53 induced by LKB1 required the kinase activity of NUAK1 and 
phosphorylation of NUAK1 at Thr211 by LKB1 was essential for its kinase 
activity, which leads to the conclusion that LKB1 activates NUAK1 and regulates 
phosphorylation of p53 through the NUAK1 kinase, at least partially. LKB1/NUAK1 
activation leads to cell cycle arrest at the G(1)/S border by inducing 
expression of p21/WAF1. Under the regulation of LKB1, NUAK1 interacts with p53 
in the nucleus and binds to the p53-responsive element of p21/WAF1 promoter. 
These findings have highlighted a novel role for NUAK1 in LKB1-related signaling 
pathways; NUAK1 can regulate cell proliferation and exert tumor suppression 
through direct interaction with p53.
