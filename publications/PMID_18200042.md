Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcriptional 
factor that performs a broad spectrum of biological functions in response to 
various stimuli. However, no specific coactivator that regulates the 
transcriptional activity of STAT3 has been identified. Here we report that 
CR6-interacting factor 1 (Crif1) is a specific transcriptional coactivator of 
STAT3, but not of STAT1 or STAT5a. Crif1 interacts with STAT3 and positively 
regulates its transcriptional activity. Crif1-/- embryos were lethal around 
embryonic day 6.5, and manifested developmental arrest accompanied with 
defective proliferation and massive apoptosis. The expression of STAT3 target 
genes was markedly reduced in a Crif1-/- blastocyst culture and in Oncostatin 
M-stimulated Crif1-deficient MEFs. Importantly, the key activities of 
constitutively active STAT3-C, such as transcription, DNA binding, and cellular 
transformation, were abolished in the Crif1-null MEFs, suggesting the essential 
role of Crif1 in the transcriptional activity of STAT3. Our results reveal that 
Crif1 is a novel and essential transcriptional coactivator of STAT3 that 
modulates its DNA binding ability, and shed light on the regulation of oncogenic 
STAT3.
