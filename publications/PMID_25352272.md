A key unanswered question in plant biology is how a plant regulates metabolism 
to maximize performance across an array of biotic and abiotic environmental 
stresses. In this study, we addressed the potential breadth of transcriptional 
regulation that can alter accumulation of the defensive glucosinolate 
metabolites in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). A systematic yeast one-hybrid 
study was used to identify hundreds of unique potential regulatory interactions 
with a nearly complete complement of 21 promoters for the aliphatic 
glucosinolate pathway. Conducting high-throughput phenotypic validation, we 
showed that >75% of tested transcription factor (TF) mutants significantly 
altered the accumulation of the defensive glucosinolates. These glucosinolate 
phenotypes were conditional upon the environment and tissue type, suggesting 
that these TFs may allow the plant to tune its defenses to the local 
environment. Furthermore, the pattern of TF/promoter interactions could 
partially explain mutant phenotypes. This work shows that defense chemistry 
within Arabidopsis has a highly intricate transcriptional regulatory system that 
may allow for the optimization of defense metabolite accumulation across a broad 
array of environments.

Abstract

A key unanswered question in plant biology is how a plant regulates metabolism to maximize performance across an array of biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. In this study, we addressed the potential breadth of transcriptional regulation that can alter accumulation of the defensive glucosinolate metabolites in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). A systematic yeast one-hybrid study was used to identify hundreds of unique potential regulatory interactions with a nearly complete complement of 21 promoters for the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway. Conducting high-throughput phenotypic validation, we showed that >75% of tested transcription factor ( TF ) mutants significantly altered the accumulation of the defensive glucosinolates. These glucosinolate phenotypes were conditional upon the environment and tissue type, suggesting that these TF s may allow the plant to tune its defenses to the local environment. Furthermore, the pattern of TF /promoter interactions could partially explain mutant phenotypes. This work shows that defense chemistry within Arabidopsis has a highly intricate transcriptional regulatory system that may allow for the optimization of defense metabolite accumulation across a broad array of environments.

DISCUSSION

Conducting large-scale Y1H with 22 promoters from the aliphatic GLS genes representing nearly the entire biosynthetic pathway and known regulators identified 52 TF s that interacted with at least the same number of promoters as MYB28, which has been validated to interact with these promoters ( Figs. 4 and 5 ). This was conducted using a library that only had approximately one-third of the known TF s in Arabidopsis, albeit a collection that was focused on TF s functioning in the major biosynthetic cell type for aliphatic GLS s, the vasculature ( Sønderby et al., 2010a , 2010b ; Gaudinier et al., 2011 ). None of these TF s had been previously linked to determining the function of the aliphatic GLS pathway. Using metabolic profiling to test the role of 29 of these TF s in controlling this pathway showed that we could validate that 75% of the identified TF s had the capacity to alter the accumulation of aliphatic GLS s ( Table I ). Obtaining this level of validation required measuring the aliphatic GLS s in multiple tissues and environments in accordance with the concept that these TF s may be playing a role in coordinating the aliphatic GLS defense pathway across a complex environment ( Fig. 6 ). Thus, it is possible to use Y1H assays to identify new TF s that can influence a metabolic pathway with a high success rate using metabolic profiling for validation.

CONCLUSION

By utilizing greater than 90% of the promoters for aliphatic biosynthetic genes with a large, focused Y1H library, we were able to develop a better image of the potential scale of GLS pathway transcriptional regulation. Incorporating metabolic profiling, we were able to show that there are at least dozens of TF s that have the capacity to significantly affect this pathway’s function. Furthermore, the effects of these TF s effects are highly conditional, indicating that the aliphatic GLS pathway is regulated to optimize growth and defense in a multifaceted environment. Future work is required to fully map out the molecular connections in this pathway and to expand this analysis to the full Arabidopsis complement of TF s. This will then allow the development of a regulatory model that is more inclusive of multiple environmental and growth inputs then have currently been proposed.
