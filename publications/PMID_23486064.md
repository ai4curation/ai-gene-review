Centrosome duplication is critical for cell division, and genome instability can 
result if duplication is not restricted to a single round per cell cycle. 
Centrosome duplication is controlled in part by CP110, a centriolar protein that 
positively regulates centriole duplication while restricting centriole 
elongation and ciliogenesis. Maintenance of normal CP110 levels is essential, as 
excessive CP110 drives centrosome over-duplication and suppresses ciliogenesis, 
whereas its depletion inhibits centriole amplification and leads to highly 
elongated centrioles and aberrant assembly of cilia in growing cells. CP110 
levels are tightly controlled, partly through ubiquitination by the ubiquitin 
ligase complex SCF(cyclin F) during G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Here, 
using human cells, we report a new mechanism for the regulation of centrosome 
duplication that requires USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme that is able to 
regulate CP110 levels. USP33 interacts with CP110 and localizes to centrioles 
primarily in S and G2/M phases, the periods during which centrioles duplicate 
and elongate. USP33 potently and specifically deubiquitinates CP110, but not 
other cyclin-F substrates. USP33 activity antagonizes SCF(cyclin F)-mediated 
ubiquitination and promotes the generation of supernumerary centriolar foci, 
whereas ablation of USP33 destabilizes CP110 and thereby inhibits centrosome 
amplification and mitotic defects. To our knowledge, we have identified the 
first centriolar deubiquitinating enzyme whose expression regulates centrosome 
homeostasis by countering cyclin-F-mediated destruction of a key substrate. Our 
results point towards potential therapeutic strategies for inhibiting 
tumorigenesis associated with centrosome amplification.
