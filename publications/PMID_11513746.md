Progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanism by which the 
binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to cognate receptors 
induces a range of biological responses, but it is far from complete. 
Identification of receptor autophosphorylation sites will allow us to determine 
how activated VEGF receptors are coupled to specific downstream signalling 
proteins. In the present study, we have expressed human VEGF receptors in insect 
cells using the baculovirus expression system, identified a major 
autophosphorylation site on the VEGF receptor fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) 
by HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS, and characterized in vitro 
interactions between Flt-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-kinase). 
Infection of High 5 insect cells with Flt-1 recombinant virus resulted in the 
expression of a 170 kDa glycoprotein, which bound VEGF with a K(d) of 2 x 
10(-10) M in intact insect cells. The overexpressed recombinant Flt-1 receptors 
exhibited tyrosine kinase activity and were constitutively phosphorylated. 
Analysis of Flt-1 tryptic peptides by HPLC-ESI-MS with selective phosphate ion 
monitoring identified a hexapeptide (YVNAFK; where single-letter amino-acid code 
has been used) containing a phosphotyrosine (pTyr) residue at position 1213. 
Using synthetic phosphopeptides, this pTyr residue was found to be directly 
involved in the binding of PI3-kinase in vitro even though it did not fall 
within a consensus pYM/VXM PI3-kinase binding motif. These results suggest that 
phosphorylated Flt-1 associates with PI3-kinase at pTyr(1213) to mediate the 
activation of this pathway in VEGF signalling.
