Many human inherited neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by loss of 
balance due to cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) degeneration. Although the 
disease-causing mutations have been identified for a number of these disorders, 
the normal functions of the proteins involved remain, in many cases, unknown. To 
gain insight into the function of proteins involved in PC degeneration, we 
developed an interaction network for 54 proteins involved in 23 inherited 
ataxias and expanded the network by incorporating literature-curated and 
evolutionarily conserved interactions. We identified 770 mostly novel 
protein-protein interactions using a stringent yeast two-hybrid screen; of 75 
pairs tested, 83% of the interactions were verified in mammalian cells. Many 
ataxia-causing proteins share interacting partners, a subset of which have been 
found to modify neurodegeneration in animal models. This interactome thus 
provides a tool for understanding pathogenic mechanisms common for this class of 
neurodegenerative disorders and for identifying candidate genes for inherited 
ataxias.
