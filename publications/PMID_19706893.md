The regulation of metal ion transport within neurons is critical for normal 
brain function. Of particular importance is the regulation of redox metals such 
as iron (Fe), where excess levels can contribute to oxidative stress and protein 
aggregation, leading to neuronal death. The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) 
plays a central role in the regulation of Fe as well as other metals; hence, 
failure of DMT1 regulation is linked to human brain pathology. However, it 
remains unclear how DMT1 is regulated in the brain. Here, we show that DMT1 is 
regulated by Ndfip1 (Nedd4 family-interacting protein 1), an adaptor protein 
that recruits E3 ligases to ubiquitinate target proteins. Using human neurons we 
show the Ndfip1 is upregulated and binds to DMT1 in response to Fe and cobalt 
(Co) exposure. This interaction results in the ubiquitination and degradation of 
DMT1, resulting in reduced metal entry. Induction of Ndfip1 expression protects 
neurons from metal toxicity, and removal of Ndfip1 by shRNAi results in 
hypersensitivity to metals. We identify Nedd4-2 as an E3 ligase recruited by 
Ndfip1 for the ubiquitination of DMT1 within human neurons. Comparison of brains 
from Ndfip1(-/-) with Ndfip1(+/+) mice exposed to Fe reveals that Ndfip1(-/-) 
brains accumulate Fe within neurons. Together, this evidence suggests a critical 
role for Ndfip1 in regulating metal transport in human neurons.
