Reversible acetylation of Tat is critical for its transactivation activity 
toward HIV-1 transcription. However, the enzymes involved in the 
acetylation/deacetylation cycles have not been fully characterized. In this 
study, by yeast two-hybrid assay, we have discovered the histone deacetylase 
HDAC6 to be a binding partner of Tat. Our data show that HDAC6 interacts with 
Tat in the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent manner. In addition, HDAC6 
deacetylates Tat at Lys-28 and thereby suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation 
of the HIV-1 promoter. Inactivation of HDAC6 promotes the interaction of Tat 
with cyclin T1 and leads to an increase in Tat transactivation activity. These 
findings establish HDAC6 as a Tat deacetylase and support a model in which 
Lys-28 deacetylation decreases Tat transactivation activity through affecting 
the ability of Tat to form a ribonucleoprotein complex with cyclin T1 and the 
transactivation-responsive RNA.
