The product of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1, BRCA1, plays pivotal roles 
in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Mounting evidence indicates that BRCA1 
associates with many proteins or protein complexes to regulate diverse processes 
important for the cellular response to DNA damage. One of these complexes, which 
mediates the accumulation of BRCA1 at sites of DNA breaks, involves the 
ubiquitin-binding motif (UIM)-containing protein RAP80, a coiled-coil domain 
protein CCDC98/Abraxas, and a deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC36. Here we describe 
the characterization of a novel component of this complex, MERIT40 (Mediator of 
Rap80 Interactions and Targeting 40 kd), which together with an adaptor protein 
BRE/BRCC45, enforces the BRCA1-dependent DNA damage response. MERIT40 is 
assembled into this RAP80/CCDC98-containing complex via its direct interaction 
with BRE/BRCC45. Importantly, MERIT40 regulates BRCA1 retention at DNA breaks 
and checkpoint function primarily via a role in maintaining the stability of BRE 
and this five-subunit protein complex at sites of DNA damage. Together, our 
study reveals that a stable complex containing MERIT40 acts early in DNA damage 
response and regulates damage-dependent BRCA1 localization.

Abstract

The product of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1, BRCA1, plays pivotal roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Mounting evidence indicates that BRCA1 associates with many proteins or protein complexes to regulate diverse processes important for the cellular response to DNA damage. One of these complexes, which mediates the accumulation of BRCA1 at sites of DNA breaks, involves the ubiquitin-binding motif (UIM)-containing protein RAP80, a coiled-coil domain protein CCDC98/Abraxas, and a deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC36. Here we describe the characterization of a novel component of this complex, MERIT40 (Mediator of Rap80 Interactions and Targeting 40 kd), which together with an adaptor protein BRE/BRCC45, enforces the BRCA1-dependent DNA damage response. MERIT40 is assembled into this RAP80/CCDC98-containing complex via its direct interaction with BRE/BRCC45. Importantly, MERIT40 regulates BRCA1 retention at DNA breaks and checkpoint function primarily via a role in maintaining the stability of BRE and this five-subunit protein complex at sites of DNA damage. Together, our study reveals that a stable complex containing MERIT40 acts early in DNA damage response and regulates damage-dependent BRCA1 localization.

Discussion

In this study, we adopted the TAP approach to isolate RAP80/CCDC98-containing protein complex and identified a novel component, MERIT40, in this complex. Similar to RAP80 and CCDC98, MERIT40 localizes to sites of DNA break, participates in G2/M checkpoint control, and promotes cell survival following DNA damage, suggesting that MERIT40 is an important factor within the RAP80 complex that plays crucial roles in the DNA damage response. More importantly, we analyzed the RAP80/CCDC98 protein complex in great detail. Our data suggest that this RAP80/CCDC98 complex consists of five core subunits ( Fig. 5D ), with CCDC98 as the central component that facilitates the assembly of this protein complex. CCDC98 binds to RAP80 via a large N-terminal region ( Kim et al. 2007b ; Wang and Elledge 2007 ) and interacts with the DUB BRCC36 through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain ( Wang and Elledge 2007 ). CCDC98 also directly interacts with BRE/BRCC45 via its N terminus. While MERIT40 does not associate directly with CCDC98, it is brought into this complex through its interaction with BRE. We were able to reconstitute this five-protein complex in vitro using baculovirus expression system (Supplemental Fig. 1D). Interestingly, we showed that a stable complex formation among these five subunits is not only required for their own IRIF formation, but is also involved in the recruitment of BRCA1 to the sites of DNA breaks. Previous studies indicated that the very C terminus of CCDC98 is phosphorylated and directly recruits BRCA1 ( Kim et al. 2007b ; Liu et al. 2007 ; Wang et al. 2007 ). Here, we showed that in the absence of MERIT40, BRE, or BRCC36, we also observed a significant reduction in BRCA1 foci formation. This is mediated by the destabilization of this protein complex, especially by the reduced interaction between RAP80 and CCDC98 in cells missing any one of these components ( Fig. 3 ).

Early studies have already suggested that the localization of this RAP80/CCDC98-containing protein complex to DNA damage sites requires the interaction between the RAP80 UIM domain and ubiquitin chains formed at the sites of DNA breaks ( Kim et al. 2007a , b ; Liu et al. 2007 ; Sobhian et al. 2007 ; Wang and Elledge 2007 ; Wang et al. 2007 ). Intriguingly, we observed that depletion of any one of the four other components beside RAP80 also greatly reduced RAP80 focus formation ( Fig. 4 ), a phenomenon that was also noticed in an early study in cells with CCDC98 depletion ( Wang and Elledge 2007 ). Exactly how these proteins, of which their IRIF formation all depend on RAP80, can also feedback and influence RAP80 DSB localization is still elusive. One plausible explanation is that the stable complex formation among these proteins may lead to important conformational changes that enhance the interaction between RAP80 and the ubiquitination chains formed at the sites of DNA breaks. An alternative but not exclusive explanation could be that there is a second chromatin-binding protein that exists in this complex that may facilitate the stable accumulation of the entire complex at or near the sites of DNA breaks. Another interesting phenomenon is that while RAP80 IRIF can be easily detected, we have to use a pre-extraction method to visualize BRE/MERIT40 and BRCC36 foci formation. This implies that only a fraction of cellular BRE/MERIT40 and BRCC36 localizes to the sites of DNA breaks, raising the possibility that BRE/MERIT40 and BRCC36 may also have other functions in the cell.

A prominent feature of the recently advanced DNA damage signaling pathway that involves BRCA1 is the presence of many ubiquitination and presumably deubiquitination events. Several groups, including ourselves, have shown that an E3 ligase RNF8 localizes to DNA damage sites and probably initiates K63-linked ubiquitin chains at the vicinity of DNA breaks ( Bennett and Harper 2008 ; Yan and Jetten 2008 ). This initiation ubiquitination event is believed to lead to the accumulation of a RAP80-containing complex to the sites of DNA damage, at least in part, via a direct interaction between protein ubiquitination chains and the RAP80 UIM domains. There are several additional ubiquitination-related events after that. First, the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is a ubiquitin ligase that promotes K6-linked protein ubiquitination and has a number of substrates including CtIP involved in DNA damage response ( Morris and Solomon 2004 ; Yu et al. 2006 ). Second, BRCC36 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination chains, but not K48-linked polyubiquitin chains ( Sobhian et al. 2007 ). Third, an early study has also suggested that BRCC36 may facilitate BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity ( Dong et al. 2003 ). Putting these together, an attractive model is that there may be a ubiquitin-editing event that occurs at or near the sites of DNA breaks, which could be similar to the case of A20 in the NF-ÎºB pathway ( Wertz et al. 2004 ; Balakirev and Wilkinson 2008 ). Such editing activity may be mediated by BRCC36 and thus convert the initial K63-linked polyubiquitination chains to BRCA1-dependent, K6-linked polyubiquitination chains for subsequent accumulation of yet-to-be-identified DNA damage checkpoint and repair proteins. Future studies will be conducted to test this hypothesis.

It is also noteworthy to mention that checkpoint defect or IR sensitivity observed in cells that are deficient of RAP80 or any other component in this five-subunit protein complex are usually not as severe as those observed in BRCA1-deficient cells. In addition, incomplete BRCA1 localization at laser-induced DSBs still occurs in the absence of RAP80 ( Sobhian et al. 2007 ). This agrees with an early study suggesting that transient BRCA1 localization at DNA damage sites can occur in the absence of H2AX ( Celeste et al. 2003 ). All of these point out that the possibility of a parallel pathway that acts cooperatively with the H2AX/MDC1/RNF8/RAP80 pathway to regulate the localization and function of BRCA1 in response to DNA damage.
