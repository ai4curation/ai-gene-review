The product of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1, BRCA1, plays pivotal roles 
in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Mounting evidence indicates that BRCA1 
associates with many proteins or protein complexes to regulate diverse processes 
important for the cellular response to DNA damage. One of these complexes, which 
mediates the accumulation of BRCA1 at sites of DNA breaks, involves the 
ubiquitin-binding motif (UIM)-containing protein RAP80, a coiled-coil domain 
protein CCDC98/Abraxas, and a deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC36. Here we describe 
the characterization of a novel component of this complex, MERIT40 (Mediator of 
Rap80 Interactions and Targeting 40 kd), which together with an adaptor protein 
BRE/BRCC45, enforces the BRCA1-dependent DNA damage response. MERIT40 is 
assembled into this RAP80/CCDC98-containing complex via its direct interaction 
with BRE/BRCC45. Importantly, MERIT40 regulates BRCA1 retention at DNA breaks 
and checkpoint function primarily via a role in maintaining the stability of BRE 
and this five-subunit protein complex at sites of DNA damage. Together, our 
study reveals that a stable complex containing MERIT40 acts early in DNA damage 
response and regulates damage-dependent BRCA1 localization.
