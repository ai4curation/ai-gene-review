Autophagy is an essential process for physiological homeostasis, but its role in 
viral infection is only beginning to be elucidated. We show here that the 
Atg5-Atg12 conjugate, a key regulator of the autophagic process, plays an 
important role in innate antiviral immune responses. Atg5-deficient mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus 
replication, which was largely due to hyperproduction of type I interferons in 
response to immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA), such as virus-derived, 
double-stranded, or 5'-phosphorylated RNA. Similar hyperresponse to isRNA was 
also observed in Atg7-deficient MEFs, in which Atg5-Atg12 conjugation is 
impaired. Overexpression of Atg5 or Atg12 resulted in Atg5-Atg12 conjugate 
formation and suppression of isRNA-mediated signaling. Molecular interaction 
studies indicated that the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate negatively regulates the type I 
IFN production pathway by direct association with the retinoic acid-inducible 
gene I (RIG-I) and IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) through the caspase 
recruitment domains (CARDs). Thus, in contrast to its role in promoting the 
bactericidal process, a component of the autophagic machinery appears to block 
innate antiviral immune responses, thereby contributing to RNA virus replication 
in host cells.
