Mitochondrial diseases and aging are associated with defects in the oxidative 
phosphorylation machinery (OXPHOS), which are the only complexes composed of 
proteins encoded by separate genomes. To better understand genome coordination 
and OXPHOS recovery during mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined ATFS-1, a 
transcription factor that regulates mitochondria-to-nuclear communication during 
the mitochondrial UPR, via ChIP-sequencing. Surprisingly, in addition to 
regulating mitochondrial chaperone, OXPHOS complex assembly factor, and 
glycolysis genes, ATFS-1 bound directly to OXPHOS gene promoters in both the 
nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Interestingly, atfs-1 was required to limit 
the accumulation of OXPHOS transcripts during mitochondrial stress, which 
required accumulation of ATFS-1 in the nucleus and mitochondria. Because 
balanced ATFS-1 accumulation promoted OXPHOS complex assembly and function, our 
data suggest that ATFS-1 stimulates respiratory recovery by fine-tuning OXPHOS 
expression to match the capacity of the suboptimal protein-folding environment 
in stressed mitochondria, while simultaneously increasing proteostasis capacity.
