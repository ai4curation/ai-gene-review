Huntington's disease (HD), is a genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized 
by a DNA CAG triplet repeat expansion in the first exon of the disease gene, HD. 
CAG DNA expansion results in a polyglutamine tract expansion in mutant 
huntingtin protein. Wild-type and mutant full-length huntingtin have been 
detected in the nucleus, but elevated levels of mutant huntingtin and huntingtin 
amino-terminal proteolytic fragments are seen to accumulate in the nuclei of 
HD-affected neurons. The presence of huntingtin in both the nucleus and the 
cytoplasm suggested that huntingtin may be dynamic between these compartments. 
By live cell time-lapse video microscopy, we have been able to visualize 
polyglutamine-mediated aggregation and the transient nuclear localization of 
huntingtin over time in a striatal cell line. A classical nuclear localization 
signal could not be detected in huntingtin, but we have discovered a nuclear 
export signal (NES) in the carboxy-terminus of huntingtin. Leptomycin B 
treatment of clonal striatal cells enhanced the nuclear localization of 
huntingtin, and a mutant NES huntingtin displayed increased nuclear 
localization, indicating that huntingtin can shuttle to and from the nucleus. 
The huntingtin NES is strictly conserved among all huntingtin proteins from 
diverse species. This export signal may be important in Huntington's disease 
because this fragment of huntingtin is proteolytically cleaved away during HD. 
The huntingtin NES therefore defines a potential role for huntingtin as a member 
of a nucleocytoplasmic dynamic protein complex.
