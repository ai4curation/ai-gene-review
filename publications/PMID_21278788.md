Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is implicated in cell growth and 
malignant transformation. TCTP has been found to interact directly with the 
third cytoplasmic domain of the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase, but whether this 
interaction has a role in tumorigenesis is unclear. In this study, we examined 
TCTP-induced tumor progression signaling networks in human breast epithelial 
cells, using adenoviral infection. We found that TCTP (a) induces Src release 
from Na,K-ATPase α subunit and Src activation; (b) phosphorylates tyrosine 
residues 845, 992, 1086, 1148 and 1173 on anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR); (c) activates PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase )-AKT, 
Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2, Rac-PAK1/2, MKK3/6-p38 and phospholipase C (PLC)-γ pathways; 
(d) enhances NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation; 
(e) stimulates cytoskeletal remodeling and cell motility and (f) upregulates 
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 3 and 13. These findings suggest that TCTP 
induces tumorigenesis through distinct multicellular signaling pathways 
involving Src-dependent EGFR transactivation, ROS generation and MMP expression.
