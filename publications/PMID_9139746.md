Small heat shock proteins (smHSPs) and alpha-crystallins constitute a family of 
related molecular chaperones that exhibit striking variability in size, ranging 
from 16 to 43 kDa. Structural studies on these proteins have been hampered by 
their tendency to form large, often dynamic and heterogeneous oligomeric 
complexes. Here we describe the structure and expression of HSP12.6, a member of 
a novel class of smHSPs from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Like other 
members of its class, HSP12.6 possesses a conserved alpha-crystallin domain but 
has the shortest N- and C-terminal regions of any known smHSP. Expression of 
HSP12.6 is limited to the first larval stage of C. elegans and is not 
significantly up-regulated by a wide range of stressors. Unlike other smHSPs, 
HSP12.6 does not form large oligomeric complexes in vivo. HSP12.6 was produced 
in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein and purified. Cross-linking and 
sedimentation velocity analyses indicate that the recombinant HSP12.6 is 
monomeric, making it an ideal candidate for structure determination. 
Interestingly, HSP12.6 does not function as a molecular chaperone in vitro, 
since it is unable to prevent the thermally induced aggregation of a test 
substrate. The structural and functional implications of these findings are 
discussed.
