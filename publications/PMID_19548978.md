RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1 (RCD1) is an important regulator of stress and 
hormonal and developmental responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Together with its 
closest homolog, SIMILAR TO RCD-ONE1 (SRO1), it is the only Arabidopsis protein 
containing the WWE domain, which is known to mediate protein-protein 
interactions in other organisms. Additionally, these two proteins contain the 
core catalytic region of poly-ADP-ribose transferases and a conserved C-terminal 
domain. Tissue and subcellular localization data indicate that RCD1 and SRO1 
have partially overlapping functions in plant development. In contrast mutant 
data indicate that rcd1 has defects in plant development, whereas sro1 displays 
normal development. However, the rcd1 sro1 double mutant has severe growth 
defects, indicating that RCD1 and SRO1 exemplify an important genetic principle 
- unequal genetic redundancy. A large pair-wise interaction test against the 
REGIA transcription factor collection revealed that RCD1 interacts with a large 
number of transcription factors belonging to several protein families, such as 
AP2/ERF, NAC and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and that SRO1 interacts with a 
smaller subset of these. Full genome array analysis indicated that in many cases 
targets of these transcription factors have altered expression in the rcd1 but 
not the sro1 mutant. Taken together RCD1 and SRO1 are required for proper plant 
development.
