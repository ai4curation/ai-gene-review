The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are severe inherited neurodegenerative 
disorders affecting children. In this disease, lysosomes accumulate 
autofluorescent storage material and there is death of neurons. Five types of 
NCL are caused by mutations in lysosomal proteins (CTSD, CLN1/PPT1, CLN2/TTPI, 
CLN3 and CLN5), and one type is caused by mutations in a protein that recycles 
between the ER and ERGIC (CLN8). The CLN6 gene underlying a variant of late 
infantile NCL (vLINCL) was recently identified. It encodes a novel 311 amino 
acid transmembrane protein. Antisera raised against CLN6 peptides detected a 
protein of 30 kDa by Western blotting of human cells, which was missing in cells 
from some CLN6 deficient patients. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, CLN6 was 
shown to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). CLN6 protein tagged with GFP 
at the C-terminus and expressed in HEK293 cells was also found within the ER. 
Investigation of the effect of five CLN6 disease mutations that affect single 
amino acids showed that the mutant proteins were retained in the ER. These data 
suggest that CLN6 is an ER resident protein, the activity of which, despite this 
location, must contribute to lysosomal function.
