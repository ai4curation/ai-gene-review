While beta 2 integrin ligand-receptor recognition interactions are well 
characterized, less is known about how these events trigger signal transduction 
cascades to regulate the transition from tethering to firm adhesion, spreading, 
and transendothelial migration. We have identified critical positive and 
negative regulatory components of this cascade in monocytes. Whereas the Syk 
tyrosine kinase is essential for beta 2 integrin signaling and cell spreading, 
the Src family kinase Fgr is a negative regulator of this pathway. Fgr 
selectively inhibits beta 2 but not beta 1 integrin signaling and Syk kinase 
function via a direct association between the Fgr SH2 domain and Syk tyrosine 
Y342. The inhibitory effects of Fgr are independent of its kinase activity, are 
dose dependent, and can be overcome by chemokines and inflammatory mediators.
