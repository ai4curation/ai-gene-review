The T-shaped radial spoke (RS) is a protein complex attached to the A 
microtubule of the outer doublet microtubules, and it extends toward the central 
pair (CP). It modulates the beat frequency, amplitude, and waveform of the 
flagella and cilia by serving as a mechanochemical signal transducer between the 
CP and dyneins. In humans, RS defects cause primary ciliary dyskinesia, but the 
structural components of triple RSs (RS1, RS2, and RS3) in mammals remain to be 
elucidated in detail. Here, we introduce a mouse model that lacked the entire 
RS1 in sperm flagella, due to the deletion of Iqub, while the tracheal cilia 
possessed intact triple RSs. Furthermore, the absence of IQUB only resulted in 
male infertility, owing to the sperm motility defect. Based on the mouse model, 
the RS1 compositions are identified in sperm flagella. In summary, this study 
elucidates the RS1 components and function in mammalian flagella.
