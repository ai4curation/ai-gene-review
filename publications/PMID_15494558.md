To investigate the nuclear-controlled mechanisms of [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly in 
chloroplasts, we selected Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with a decreased content 
of photosystem I (PSI) containing three [4Fe-4S] clusters. One identified gene, 
ACCUMULATION OF PHOTOSYSTEM ONE1 (APO1), belongs to a previously unknown gene 
family with four defined groups (APO1 to APO4) only found in nuclear genomes of 
vascular plants. All homologs contain two related motifs of approximately 100 
amino acid residues that could potentially provide ligands for [4Fe-4S] 
clusters. APO1 is essentially required for photoautotrophic growth, and levels 
of PSI core subunits are below the limit of detection in the apo1 mutant. Unlike 
other Arabidopsis PSI mutants, apo1 fails to accumulate significant amounts of 
the outer antenna subunits of PSI and PSII and to form grana stacks. In 
particular, APO1 is essentially required for stable accumulation of other 
plastid-encoded and nuclear-encoded [4Fe-4S] cluster complexes within the 
chloroplast, whereas [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing complexes appear to be 
unaffected. In vivo labeling experiments and analyses of polysome association 
suggest that translational elongation of the PSI transcripts psaA and psaB is 
specifically arrested in the mutant. Taken together, our findings suggest that 
APO1 is involved in the stable assembly of several [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing 
complexes of chloroplasts and interferes with translational events probably in 
association with plastid nucleoids.

To investigate the nuclear-controlled mechanisms of [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly in chloroplasts, we selected Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with a decreased content of photosystem I (PSI) containing three [4Fe-4S] clusters. One identified gene, ACCUMULATION OF PHOTOSYSTEM ONE1 (APO1), belongs to a previously unknown gene family with four defined groups (APO1 to APO4) only found in nuclear genomes of vascular plants. All homologs contain two related motifs of ∼100 amino acid residues that could potentially provide ligands for [4Fe-4S] clusters. APO1 is essentially required for photoautotrophic growth, and levels of PSI core subunits are below the limit of detection in the apo1 mutant. Unlike other Arabidopsis PSI mutants, apo1 fails to accumulate significant amounts of the outer antenna subunits of PSI and PSII and to form grana stacks. In particular, APO1 is essentially required for stable accumulation of other plastid-encoded and nuclear-encoded [4Fe-4S] cluster complexes within the chloroplast, whereas [2Fe-2S] cluster–containing complexes appear to be unaffected. In vivo labeling experiments and analyses of polysome association suggest that translational elongation of the PSI transcripts psaA and psaB is specifically arrested in the mutant. Taken together, our findings suggest that APO1 is involved in the stable assembly of several [4Fe-4S] cluster–containing complexes of chloroplasts and interferes with translational events probably in association with plastid nucleoids.
