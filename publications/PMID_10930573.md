We have so far cloned a cDNA encoding a hybrid-type histidine kinase (ATHK1), 
three cDNAs encoding phosphorelay intermediates (ATHP1-3), and four cDNAs 
encoding response regulators (ATRR1-4) from Arabidopsis thaliana. To determine 
which molecules constitute a His to Asp phosphorelay pathway, we examined 
protein-protein interactions between them using a pairwise yeast two-hybrid 
analysis, as an initial step. We detected a specific interaction between ATHK1 
and ATHP1. We further examined protein-protein interactions between ATHP1-3 and 
other histidine kinases. We detected interactions between ETR1 and all ATHPs, 
and between CKI1 and ATHP1 or ATHP2. Interestingly, ERS1 could not interact with 
any ATHPs. We also examined protein-protein interactions between ATHP1-3 and 
ATRR1-4. The results indicated that ATHP2 could interact with ATRR4, and that 
ATHP3 could interact with ATRR1 or ATRR4. However, ATHP1 could not interact with 
any ATRRs. On the basis of these results, we discuss the possible phosphorelay 
networks in an Arabidopsis two-component system.
