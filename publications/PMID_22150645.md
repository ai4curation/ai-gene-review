PURPOSE: Dravet syndrome (DS), a devastating epileptic encephalopathy, is mostly 
caused by mutations of the SCN1A gene, coding for the voltage-gated Na(+) 
channel Na(V)1.1 α subunit. About 50% of SCN1A DS mutations truncate Na(V)1.1, 
possibly causing complete loss of its function. However, it has not been 
investigated yet if Na(V)1.1 truncated mutants are dominant negative, if they 
impair expression or function of wild-type channels, as it has been shown for 
truncated mutants of other proteins (e.g., Ca(V) channels). We studied the 
effect of two DS truncated Na(V)1.1 mutants, R222* and R1234*, on coexpressed 
wild-type Na(+) channels.
METHODS: We engineered R222* or R1234* in the human cDNA of Na(V)1.1 (hNa(V)1.1) 
and studied their effect on coexpressed wild-type hNa(V)1.1, hNa(V)1.2 or 
hNa(V)1.3 cotransfecting tsA-201 cells, and on hNa(V)1.6 transfecting an human 
embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line stably expressing this channel. We also studied 
hippocampal neurons dissociated from Na(V)1.1 knockout (KO) mice, an animal 
model of DS expressing a truncated Na(V)1.1 channel.
KEY FINDINGS: We found no modifications of current amplitude coexpressing the 
truncated mutants with hNa(V)1.1, hNa(V)1.2, or hNa(V)1.3, but a 30% reduction 
coexpressing them with hNa(V)1.6. However, we showed that also coexpression of 
functional full-length hNa(V)1.1 caused a similar reduction. Therefore, this 
effect should not be involved in the pathomechanism of DS. Some gating 
properties of hNa(V)1.1, hNa(V)1.3, and hNa(V)1.6 were modified, but recordings 
of hippocampal neurons dissociated from Na(V)1.1 KO mice did not show any 
significant modifications of these properties. Therefore, Na(V)1.1 truncated 
mutants are not dominant negative, consistent with haploinsufficiency as the 
cause of DS.
SIGNIFICANCE: We have better clarified the pathomechanism of DS, pointed out an 
important difference between pathogenic truncated Ca(V)2.1 mutants and hNa(V)1.1 
ones, and shown that hNa(V)1.6 expression can be reduced in physiologic 
conditions by coexpression of hNa(V)1.1. Moreover, our data may provide useful 
information for the development of therapeutic approaches.
