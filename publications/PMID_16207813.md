Cellular protein quality control involves a close interplay between molecular 
chaperones and the ubiquitin/proteasome system. We recently identified a 
degradation pathway, on which the chaperone Hsc70 delivers chaperone clients, 
such as misfolded forms of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR), to the proteasome. The cochaperone CHIP is of central 
importance on this pathway, because it acts as a chaperone-associated ubiquitin 
ligase. CHIP mediates the attachment of a ubiquitin chain to a 
chaperone-presented client protein and thereby stimulates its proteasomal 
degradation. To gain further insight into the function of CHIP we isolated 
CHIP-containing protein complexes from human HeLa cells and analyzed their 
composition by peptide mass fingerprinting. We identified the Hsc70 cochaperone 
BAG-2 as a main component of CHIP complexes. BAG-2 inhibits the ubiquitin ligase 
activity of CHIP by abrogating the CHIP/E2 cooperation and stimulates the 
chaperone-assisted maturation of CFTR. The activity of BAG-2 resembles that of 
the previously characterized Hsc70 cochaperone and CHIP inhibitor HspBP1. The 
presented data therefore establish multiple mechanisms to control the 
destructive activity of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase in human cells.

Abstract

Cellular protein quality control involves a close interplay between molecular chaperones and the ubiquitin/proteasome system. We recently identified a degradation pathway, on which the chaperone Hsc70 delivers chaperone clients, such as misfolded forms of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), to the proteasome. The cochaperone CHIP is of central importance on this pathway, because it acts as a chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase. CHIP mediates the attachment of a ubiquitin chain to a chaperone-presented client protein and thereby stimulates its proteasomal degradation. To gain further insight into the function of CHIP we isolated CHIP-containing protein complexes from human HeLa cells and analyzed their composition by peptide mass fingerprinting. We identified the Hsc70 cochaperone BAG-2 as a main component of CHIP complexes. BAG-2 inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP by abrogating the CHIP/E2 cooperation and stimulates the chaperone-assisted maturation of CFTR. The activity of BAG-2 resembles that of the previously characterized Hsc70 cochaperone and CHIP inhibitor HspBP1. The presented data therefore establish multiple mechanisms to control the destructive activity of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase in human cells.

INTRODUCTION

The cochaperone and ubiquitin ligase CHIP is a key regulator of protein folding and protein degradation in human cells (reviewed in Höfeld et al. , 2001; Esser et al., 2004 , 2005 ). CHIP associates with the molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 and attaches a ubiquitin-derived degradation signal onto chaperone-bound client proteins, thereby inducing client degradation by the proteasome. Affected chaperone clients can be broadly divided into two subgroups: 1) proteins that associate with the chaperones during their conformational regulation, such as the glucocorticoid hormone receptor and the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 ( Connell et al., 2001 ; Demand et al., 2001 ; Xu et al., 2002 ), and 2) aggregation-prone proteins that are recognized by the chaperones during protein quality control, for example, immature forms of CFTR and hyperphosphorylated tau ( Meacham et al., 2001 ; Murata et al., 2001 ; Shimura et al., 2004 ). Accordingly, CHIP modulates intracellular signaling and quality control processes.

In light of the central role of CHIP in linking molecular chaperones to the ubiquitin/proteasome system, it seems important to elucidate how the activity of CHIP is regulated in mammalian cells. Recently, a cooperation of CHIP with other cochaperones of Hsc70 emerged as a regulatory principle ( Demand et al., 2001 ; Alberti et al., 2002 , 2004 ; Westhoff et al., 2005 ). The cochaperone BAG-1, for example, was shown to stimulate the CHIP-mediated degradation of the glucocorticoid hormone receptor (GR; Demand et al., 2001 ). BAG-1 belongs to a family of proteins, which all share a BAG domain for binding to Hsc70 and which act as a nucleotide exchange factors in the ATP-dependent chaperone cycle of Hsc70 ( Höhfeld and Jentsch, 1997 ; Takayama et al., 1999 ; Sondermann et al., 2001 ). Moreover, BAG-1 possesses a ubiquitin-like domain that is utilized for an association of the cochaperone with the proteasome ( Lüders et al., 2000a ; Alberti et al., 2002 ). Its domain arrangement enables BAG-1 to recruit Hsc70 complexes to the proteasome, which apparently underlies its stimulating activity in the proteasomal degradation of chaperone clients. The cooperation of BAG-1 and CHIP during proteasomal sorting reflects the ability of the two cochaperones to bind simultaneously to Hsc70 ( Demand et al., 2001 ). BAG-1 interacts with the amino terminal ATPase domain of Hsc70 through its BAG domain and leaves the carboxy terminus of the chaperone available for an association with CHIP ( Höhfeld and Jentsch, 1997 ; Ballinger et al., 1999 ; Demand et al., 2001 ).

Importantly, cochaperone cooperation not only provides a means to stimulate chaperone-assisted degradation but also to interfere with it. This was revealed when the Hsc70 cochaperone HspBP1 was identified as an inhibitor of CHIP ( Alberti et al., 2004 ). Like BAG-1, HspBP1 binds to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and is present in ternary complexes with Hsc70 and CHIP. Intriguingly, HspBP1 inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP in the assembled chaperone/cochaperone complex. As a consequence HspBP1 interferes with the CHIP-induced degradation of CFTR at the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and stimulates the maturation of the ion channel ( Alberti et al., 2004 ). HspBP1 apparently exerts an important control function to define the destructive activity of CHIP.

To gain further insight into the function and regulation of CHIP we isolated CHIP-containing protein complexes from human HeLa cells and analyzed their protein composition. We detected the previously uncharacterized BAG-1-related cochaperone BAG-2 as a main component in CHIP complexes and observed that BAG-2 attenuates chaperone-assisted degradation. Our data reveal an unexpected diversity with regard to Hsc70/CHIP complexes that assemble in human cells and identify a novel CHIP inhibitor.

DISCUSSION

Here we identify the Hsc70 cochaperone BAG-2 as an inhibitor of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase and regulator of chaperone-mediated protein quality control. BAG-2 associates with the Hsc70/CHIP chaperone machinery through binding to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and interferes with CHIP-mediated ubiquitylation by abrogating the cooperation between CHIP and its partner E2 enzyme.

Previously, the cochaperone HspBP1 was identified as an inhibitor of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase ( Alberti et al., 2004 ). Like BAG-2, HspBP1 interferes with CHIP-mediated ubiquitylation in an assembled chaperone/cochaperone complex. This may enable CHIP to participate in the regulation of the Hsc70 chaperone cycle without inducing client degradation, consistent with recently established degradation-independent functions of CHIP ( Cardozo et al., 2003 ; Dai et al., 2003 ; Jiang et al., 2003 ; Kampinga et al., 2003 ). Remarkably, BAG-2 and HspBP1 seem to achieve CHIP inhibition by distinct mechanisms. Although BAG-2 abrogates the CHIP/E2 cooperation, HspBP1 does not and may therefore induce conformational changes of the chaperone complex, which interfere with CHIP-mediated ubiquitylation, as previously suggested ( Alberti et al., 2004 ). In any case, the finding that two distinct Hsc70 cochaperones act as inhibitors of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase illustrates the necessity to define the destructive activity of CHIP. The inhibitors may have distinct but nonetheless overlapping functions. Indeed, BAG-2 and HspBP1 both stimulated the maturation of CFTR at the ER membrane ( Alberti et al., 2004 ; Figure 6 ). The Hsc70 chaperone machinery is intimately involved in the folding and degradation of CFTR ( Yang et al., 1993 ; Strickland et al., 1997 ; Meacham et al., 1999 , 2001 ; Farinha et al., 2002 ; Kostova and Wolf, 2003 ; Alberti et al., 2004 ; Younger et al., 2004 ). Hsc70 associates cotranslationally with the first nucleotide-binding domain of the ion channel (NBD1), which is exposed into the cytoplasm, and facilitates the folding or degradation of CFTR dependent on the cochaperones Hsc70 interacts with. Using cellulose-bound peptide scans, we determined the regions in NBD1 that are recognized by Hsc70. Chaperone-binding sites are mainly located in the α-subdomain of NBD1, which also harbors the most common cystic fibrosis-causing mutations ( Lewis et al., 2004 ). Binding sites comprise patches of hydrophobic amino acids flanked by positively charged residues, largely consistent with previous findings for recognition motifs of Hsp70 family members ( Rüdiger et al., 1997 ). Remarkably, a recognition pattern similar to that observed for Hsc70 was also obtained when peptide scans were incubated with purified BAG-2. The ability to recognize hydrophobic patches in NBD1 obviously enables the cochaperone to display a chaperone activity on its own. This might be important for client loading onto Hsc70 and for the stabilization of clients upon ATP-induced release from Hsc70. Notably, binding of BAG-2 to CFTR peptides was abolished in the presence of the ATPase domain of Hsc70 (i.e., the contact region of BAG-2 on Hsc70). Client- and chaperone-binding sites on BAG-2 are apparently overlapping. In this regard it is noteworthy that BAG-2 forms homodimers. Conceivably, one subunit of the dimer may engage in Hsc70 binding and regulation, whereas the other subunit stabilizes the nonnative client protein. In any case, the stimulating activity of BAG-2 in CFTR maturation seems to reflect not only its ability to inhibit the CHIP-mediated ubiquitylation of CFTR, but also to stabilize immature CFTR conformations.

Another BAG domain cochaperone previously shown to regulate CHIP activity is BAG-1 ( Lüders et al., 2000a ). In contrast to BAG-2, BAG-1 stimulates CHIP-mediated degradation ( Demand et al., 2001 ). In part this might be explained by the ability of BAG-1 to associate with the proteasome through its ubiquitin-like domain and to act as a substrate release factor of Hsc70 in the vicinity of the proteasome. Moreover, BAG-1, but not BAG-2, is efficiently ubiquitylated by the CHIP conjugation machinery, which further promotes binding of BAG-1 to the proteolytic complex. Thus, BAG-1 and BAG-2 might be viewed as antagonistic regulators of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase. However, differences in substrate specificity have to be taken into account here. BAG-2 is an essential component in CFTR maturation, whereas BAG-1 does not affect the CHIP-mediated degradation of the ion channel (Mecham et al., 2001). The two cochaperones may thus cooperate with Hsc70 in the biogenesis of distinct sets of chaperone substrates. Taken together, a functional diversity among BAG domain cochaperones becomes apparent. These cochaperones were often described as inhibitors of Hsc70, because they were found to abrogate the chaperone-mediated stabilization of some model chaperone clients such as heat-denatured firefly luciferase in in vitro and cell culture experiments ( Takayama et al., 1999 ; Nollen et al., 2001 ). However, depending on the experimental conditions used (i.e., cochaperone concentration, chaperone client, and particular BAG family member investigated), folding-stimulating activities also were detected for BAG cochaperones ( Gässler et al., 2001 ; Lüders et al., 2000b ). A recent study even identifies BAG-1 as a neuroprotective protein that enhances Hsc70 chaperone function ( Liman et al., 2005 ). This illustrates that BAG family members cannot be generally described as inhibitors of Hsc70. Rather, the acceleration of nucleotide exchange on Hsc70 in the presence of BAG cochaperones may result in the abrogation or the stimulation of chaperone-assisted folding dependent on the individual properties of each client protein and the physiological situation. The data presented here clearly identify BAG-2 as a cochaperone that stimulates the maturation of CFTR in conjunction with Hsc70. The full repertoire of chaperone clients that are affected by BAG-2, however, remains to be elucidated. Intriguingly, functional impairment of the C. elegans homologue of BAG-2, UNC-23, causes fragile skeletal muscle attachment, consistent with a role of the cochaperone in the assembly or positioning of proteins in the muscle attachment complex ( Plenefisch et al., 2000 ). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the cooperation between BAG-2 and CHIP established here exerts regulatory functions in diverse chaperone-assisted processes in healthy and diseased cells.

While this work was under review, Patterson and coworkers independently identified BAG-2 as an inhibitor of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase ( Dai et al., 2005 ).
