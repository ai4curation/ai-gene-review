Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are essential molecules for mammalian 
development. The nine known FGF ligands and the four signaling FGF receptors 
(and their alternatively spliced variants) are expressed in specific spatial and 
temporal patterns. The activity of this signaling pathway is regulated by ligand 
binding specificity, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and the differential 
signaling capacity of individual FGF receptors. To determine potentially 
relevant ligand-receptor pairs we have engineered mitogenically responsive cell 
lines expressing the major splice variants of all the known FGF receptors. We 
have assayed the mitogenic activity of the nine known FGF ligands on these cell 
lines. These studies demonstrate that FGF 1 is the only FGF that can activate 
all FGF receptor splice variants. Using FGF 1 as an internal standard we have 
determined the relative activity of all the other members of the FGF family. 
These data should serve as a biochemical foundation for determining 
developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological processes that involve FGF 
signaling pathways.
