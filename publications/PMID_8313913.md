Cell death is a prominent feature of B cell development. For example, a large 
population of B cells dies at the pre-B cell stage presumably due to the failure 
to express a functional immunoglobulin receptor. In addition, developing B cells 
expressing antigen receptors for self are selectively eliminated at the immature 
B cell stage. The molecular signals that control B cell survival are largely 
unknown. The product of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene may be involved as its 
overexpression inhibits apoptotic cell death in a variety of biological systems. 
However, the physiological role of the endogenous Bcl-2 protein during B cell 
development is undetermined. Here we show a striking developmental regulation of 
the Bcl-2 protein in B lymphocytes. Bcl-2 is highly expressed in CD43+ B cell 
precursors (pro-B cells) and mature B cells but downregulated at the pre-B and 
immature B cell stages of development. We found that Bcl-2 expressed by B cells 
is a long-lived protein with a half-life of approximately 10 h. Importantly, 
susceptibility to apoptosis mediated by the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone 
is stage-dependent in developing B cells and correlates with the levels of Bcl-2 
protein. Furthermore, expression of a bcl-2 transgene rescued pre-B and immature 
B cells from dexamethasone-induced cell death, indicating that Bcl-2 can inhibit 
the apoptotic cell death of progenitors and early B cells. Taken together, these 
findings argue that Bcl-2 is a physiological signal controlling cell death 
during B cell development.
