Mutations in BRCA1 are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. 
BRCA1 participates in the DNA damage response and acts as a ubiquitin ligase. 
However, its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we report that BRCA1 is 
modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in response to genotoxic 
stress, and co-localizes at sites of DNA damage with SUMO1, SUMO2/3 and the 
SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. PIAS SUMO E3 ligases co-localize with and modulate 
SUMO modification of BRCA1, and are required for BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity 
in cells. In vitro SUMO modification of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer greatly 
increases its ligase activity, identifying it as a SUMO-regulated ubiquitin 
ligase (SRUbL). Further, PIAS SUMO ligases are required for complete 
accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) damage-repair proteins subsequent to 
RNF8 accrual, and for proficient double-strand break repair. These data 
demonstrate that the SUMOylation pathway plays a significant role in mammalian 
DNA damage response.
