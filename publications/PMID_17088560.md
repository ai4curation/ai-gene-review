Eukaryotic cells respond to a variety of DNA insults by triggering a common 
signal transduction cascade, known as checkpoint response, which temporarily 
halts cell-cycle progression. Although the main players involved in the cascade 
have been identified, there is still uncertainty about the nature of the 
structures that activate these surveillance mechanisms. To understand the role 
of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in checkpoint activation, we analyzed the 
UV-induced phosphorylation of the key checkpoint proteins Chk1 and p53, in 
primary fibroblasts from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne 
syndrome (CS), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), or UV light-sensitive syndrome. These 
disorders are due to defects in transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) and/or global 
genome NER (GG-NER), the NER subpathways repairing the transcribed strand of 
active genes or the rest of the genome, respectively. We show here that in G0/G1 
and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, triggering of the DNA damage cascade requires 
recognition and processing of the lesions by the GG-NER. Loss of TC-NER does not 
affect checkpoint activation. Mutations in XPD, XPB, and in TTDA, encoding 
subunits of the TFIIH complex, involved in both transcription and NER, impair 
checkpoint triggering. The only exception is represented by mutations in XPD, 
resulting in combined features of XP and CS (XP/CS) that lead to activation of 
the checkpoint cascade after UV radiation. Inhibition of RNA polymerase II 
transcription significantly reduces the phosphorylation of key checkpoint 
factors in XP/CS fibroblasts on exposure to UV damage.
