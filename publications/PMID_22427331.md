In a strategy to identify novel genes involved in glioma pathogenesis by 
molecular characterization of chromosomal translocation breakpoints, we 
identified the KIAA1797 gene, encoding a protein with an as yet undefined 
function, to be disrupted by a 7;9 translocation in a primary glioblastoma 
culture. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization detected deletions 
involving KIAA1797 in around half of glioblastoma cell lines and glioblastomas 
investigated. Quantification of messenger RNA levels in human tissues 
demonstrated highest KIAA1797 expression in brain, reduced levels in all 
glioblastoma cell lines and most glioblastomas and similar levels in glial and 
neuronal cells by analysis of different hippocampal regions from murine brain. 
Antibodies against KIAA1797 were generated and showed similar protein levels in 
cortex and subcortical white matter of human brain, while levels were 
significantly reduced in glioblastomas with KIAA1797 deletion. By 
immunofluorescence of astrocytoma cells, KIAA1797 co-localized with vinculin in 
focal adhesions. Physical interaction between KIAA1797 and vinculin was 
demonstrated via co-immunoprecipitation. Functional in vitro assays demonstrated 
a significant decrease in colony formation, migration and invasion capacity of 
LN18 and U87MG glioma cells carrying a homozygous KIAA1797 deletion ectopically 
expressing KIAA1797 compared with mock-transduced cells. In an in vivo 
orthotopic xenograft mouse model, U87MG tumour lesions expressing KIAA1797 had a 
significantly reduced volume compared to tumours not expressing KIAA1797. In 
summary, the frequently deleted KIAA1797 gene encodes a novel focal adhesion 
complex protein with tumour suppressor function in gliomas, which we name 
'focadhesin'. Since KIAA1797 genetic variation has been implicated in 
Alzheimer's disease, our data are also relevant for neurodegeneration.
