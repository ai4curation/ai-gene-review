The term innate immunity refers to a number of evolutionary ancient mechanisms 
that serve to defend animals and plants against infection. Genetically tractable 
model organisms, especially Drosophila, have contributed greatly to advances in 
our understanding of mammalian innate immunity. Essentially, nothing is known 
about immune responses in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using 
high-density cDNA microarrays, we show here that infection of C. elegans by the 
Gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens provokes a marked upregulation of 
the expression of many genes. Among the most robustly induced are genes encoding 
lectins and lysozymes, known to be involved in immune responses in other 
organisms. Certain infection-inducible genes are under the control of the 
DBL-1/TGFbeta pathway. We found that dbl-1 mutants exhibit increased 
susceptibility to infection. Conversely, overexpression of the lysozyme gene 
lys-1 augments the resistance of C. elegans to S. marcescens. These results 
constitute the first demonstration of inducible antibacterial defenses in C. 
elegans and open new avenues for the investigation of evolutionary conserved 
mechanisms of innate immunity.
