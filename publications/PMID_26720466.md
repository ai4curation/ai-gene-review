PURPOSE: To describe the clinical characteristics associated with a newly 
identified mutant of autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB) and confirm the 
associated physiological functional defects.
METHODS: Two patients with ARB from one family underwent a full ophthalmic 
examination, including dilated fundus examination, fundus photography, 
fluorescein angiography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, spectral-domain 
optical coherence tomography (OCT), electroretinography (ERG), and 
electrooculography (EOG). Subsequently, genetic analysis for bestrophin-1 
(BEST1) mutations was conducted through direct Sanger sequencing. The effect of 
ARB-associated mutations of BEST1 on the cellular localization was determined by 
in vitro experiments. Whole-cell patch clamping was conducted to measure the 
chloride conductance of wild-type BEST1 and the identified BEST1 mutants in 
transfected HEK293T cells.
RESULTS: Two related patients (66-year-old brother and 52-year-old sister) 
presented with reduced visual acuity and bilateral symmetrical subretinal 
deposits of hyperautofluorescent materials in the posterior pole. 
Spectral-domain OCT showed macular thinning with submacular fluid. The female 
patient had a concomitant macular edema associated with branched retinal vein 
occlusion in the left eye, which responded well to intravitreal bevacizumab 
injections. Genetic analysis demonstrated that both patients were compound 
heterozygous for one novel (Leu40Pro) and one previously identified (Ala195Val) 
BEST1 variant. HEK293T cells transfected with the identified BEST1 mutant showed 
significantly small currents compared to those transfected with the wild-type 
gene, whereas cells cotransfected with mutant and wild-type BEST1 showed good 
chloride conductance. Cellular localization of BEST1 was well conserved to the 
plasma membrane in the mutants.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified and described the phenotype and in vitro 
functional aspects of a new BEST1 mutation causing ARB. Clinically suspected ARB 
cases warrant genetic confirmation to confirm the diagnosis.
