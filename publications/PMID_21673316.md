The basal-like subtype of breast cancer has an aggressive clinical behavior 
compared to that of the luminal subtype. We identified the microRNAs (miRNAs) 
miR-221 and miR-222 (miR-221/222) as basal-like subtype-specific miRNAs and 
showed that expression of miR-221/222 decreased expression of 
epithelial-specific genes and increased expression of mesenchymal-specific 
genes, and increased cell migration and invasion in a manner characteristic of 
the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The transcription factor FOSL1 
(also known as Fra-1), which is found in basal-like breast cancers but not in 
the luminal subtype, stimulated the transcription of miR-221/222, and the 
abundance of these miRNAs decreased with inhibition of the epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) or MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular 
signal-regulated protein kinase kinase), placing miR-221/222 downstream of the 
RAS pathway. Furthermore, miR-221/222-mediated reduction in E-cadherin abundance 
depended on their targeting the 3' untranslated region of the GATA family 
transcriptional repressor TRPS1 (tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome type 1), which 
inhibited EMT by decreasing ZEB2 (zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox2) 
expression. We conclude that by promoting EMT, miR-221/222 may contribute to the 
more aggressive clinical behavior of basal-like breast cancers.
