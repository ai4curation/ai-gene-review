Atopy is a genetically determined disorder that affects 10%-20% of the 
population. Many symptoms of patients with atopy (allergic rhinitis, 
conjunctivitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis) result from events occurring after 
crosslinking of cell-bound IgE by per se innocuous environmental antigens. The 
frequently raised hypothesis that autosensitization can also be a pathogenetic 
factor in atopy, gained support by our recent demonstration of IgE antibodies 
against human proteins in atopic dermatitis patients. To unravel the molecular 
nature of IgE-defined autoantigens, we used serum IgE from atopic dermatitis 
patients to screen a human epithelial cDNA expression library. One of the 
cDNA-encoding IgE-reactive products contained 1501 bp of a 2274 bp open-reading 
frame finally identified by sequence analysis of two additional cDNA clones 
resulting from oligonucleotide screening. The IgE-defined autoantigen, 
designated Hom s 1, exhibited an almost complete sequence identity with a 
recently described antigen recognized by cytotoxic T cells of a squamous cell 
carcinoma patient. Purified recombinant Hom s 1 specifically bound IgE from 
patients with severe atopy. When used as immunogen in rabbits, recombinant Hom s 
1 gave rise to an anti-serum that reacted with a cytoplasmic protein exhibiting 
a broad cellular and tissue reactivity (skin, lung >> gastrointestinal tract >> 
muscle, brain) and identified a 55 kDa protein in blotted serum IgE 
preparations. The attractive possibility remains that the Hom s 1-triggered IgE 
response contributes to the events resulting in allergic tissue inflammation. If 
so, the respective recombinant molecule may serve as a paradigmatic tool for the 
diagnosis and treatment of patients with "intrinsic" atopy.
