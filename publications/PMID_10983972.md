Skeletal muscle differentiation is controlled by associations between myogenic 
basic-helix-loop-helix and MEF2 transcription factors. We show that chromatin 
associated with muscle genes regulated by these transcription factors becomes 
acetylated during myogenesis and that class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), 
which interact with MEF2, specifically suppress myoblast differentiation. These 
HDACs do not interact directly with MyoD, yet they suppress its myogenic 
activity through association with MEF2. Elevating the level of MyoD can override 
the repression imposed by HDACs on muscle genes. HDAC-mediated repression of 
myogenesis also can be overcome by CaM kinase and insulin-like growth factor 
(IGF) signaling. These findings reveal central roles for HDACs in chromatin 
remodeling during myogenesis and as intranuclear targets for signaling pathways 
controlled by IGF and CaM kinase.
