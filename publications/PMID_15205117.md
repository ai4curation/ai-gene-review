Sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis in the gut has implications in colonic 
tumorigenesis and cholesterol absorption. It is triggered by intestinal alkaline 
sphingomyelinase (Alk-SMase) that is present in the intestinal mucosa and 
content. The mechanism by which the enzyme is released into the lumen is not 
clear. We studied whether trypsin can dissociate Alk-SMase from the mucosa and 
affect its activity. During luminal perfusion of rat intestine, addition of 
trypsin to the buffer increased Alk-SMase activity in the perfusate output by 
about threefold. Treating COS-7 cells transfected with Alk-SMase cDNA with 
trypsin increased the SMase activity in the medium and reduced that in the cell 
lysate dose dependently. The appearance of Alk-SMase in the perfusate and 
culture medium was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The effect of trypsin was 
blocked by trypsin inhibitor, and neither chymotrypsin nor elastase had a 
similar effect. We also expressed the full length and COOH-terminal truncated 
Alk-SMase in COS-7 cells and found that the activity of the full-length enzyme 
is mainly in the cells, whereas that of the truncated form is mainly in the 
medium. Both forms were active, but only the activity of the full-length 
Alk-SMase was enhanced by trypsin. By linking a poly-His tag to the constructed 
cDNA, we found that the first tryptic site Arg440 upstream of the signal anchor 
was attacked by trypsin. In conclusion, trypsin cleaves the Alk-SMase at the 
COOH terminal, releases it from mucosa, and meanwhile enhances its activity. The 
findings indicate a physiological role of trypsin in SM digestion.
