Pituitary tumor-transforming gene (PTTG) is a recently characterized 
proto-oncogene that is expressed specifically in adult testis. In this study, we 
have used in situ hybridization and developmental Northern blot assays to 
demonstrate that PTTG mRNA is expressed stage-specifically in spermatocytes and 
spermatids during rat spermatogenic cycle. We have used the yeast two-hybrid 
system to identify proteins that interact with PTTG in testicular cells. Two 
positive clones were characterized. One of the clones is the ribosomal protein 
S10, the other encodes a novel human DnaJ homologue designated HSJ2. Northern 
blot analysis showed that testis contains higher levels of HSJ2 mRNA than other 
tissues examined, and the expression pattern of HSJ2 mRNA in postnatal rat 
testis is similar to PTTG. S10 mRNA levels do not vary remarkably among 
different tissues and remains unchanged during testicular germ cell 
differentiation. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that both S10 and HSJ2 
bind to PTTG specifically and that PTTG can be co-immunoprecipitated with S10 
and HSJ2 from transfected cells. Moreover, the binding sites for both proteins 
were located within the C-terminal 75 amino acids of the PTTG protein. These 
results suggest that PTTG may play a role in spermatogenesis.
