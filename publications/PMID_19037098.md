The Tim9-Tim10 complex plays an essential role in mitochondrial protein import 
by chaperoning select hydrophobic precursor proteins across the intermembrane 
space. How the complex interacts with precursors is not clear, although it has 
been proposed that Tim10 acts in substrate recognition, whereas Tim9 acts in 
complex stabilization. In this study, we report the structure of the yeast 
Tim9-Tim10 hexameric assembly determined to 2.5 A and have performed mutational 
analysis in yeast to evaluate the specific roles of Tim9 and Tim10. Like the 
human counterparts, each Tim9 and Tim10 subunit contains a central loop flanked 
by disulfide bonds that separate two extended N- and C-terminal tentacle-like 
helices. Buried salt-bridges between highly conserved lysine and glutamate 
residues connect alternating subunits. Mutation of these residues destabilizes 
the complex, causes defective import of precursor substrates, and results in 
yeast growth defects. Truncation analysis revealed that in the absence of the 
N-terminal region of Tim9, the hexameric complex is no longer able to 
efficiently trap incoming substrates even though contacts with Tim10 are still 
made. We conclude that Tim9 plays an important functional role that includes 
facilitating the initial steps in translocating precursor substrates into the 
intermembrane space.
