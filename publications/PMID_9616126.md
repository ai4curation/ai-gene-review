The tumor suppressor PTEN is a phosphatase with sequence similarity to the 
cytoskeletal protein tensin. Here the cellular roles of PTEN were investigated. 
Overexpression of PTEN inhibited cell migration, whereas antisense PTEN enhanced 
migration. Integrin-mediated cell spreading and the formation of focal adhesions 
were down-regulated by wild-type PTEN but not by PTEN with an inactive 
phosphatase domain. PTEN interacted with the focal adhesion kinase FAK and 
reduced its tyrosine phosphorylation. Overexpression of FAK partially 
antagonized the effects of PTEN. Thus, PTEN phosphatase may function as a tumor 
suppressor by negatively regulating cell interactions with the extracellular 
matrix.
