BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Infants requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) 
have the highest rates of protein catabolism ever reported. Recent 
investigations have found that such extreme protein breakdown is refractory to 
conventional nutritional management. In this pilot study, the authors sought to 
use the anabolic hormone insulin to reduce the profound protein degradation in 
this cohort.
METHODS: Four parenterally fed infants on ECMO were enrolled in a prospective, 
randomized, crossover trial. Subjects were administered an insulin infusion 
using a 4-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp followed by a control saline 
infusion on consecutive days in random order. Whole-body protein flux and 
breakdown were quantified using a primed continuous infusion of the stable 
isotope L-[1-13C]leucine. Statistical analyses were performed using paired t 
tests.
RESULTS: Serum insulin levels were increased 15-fold during the insulin clamp 
compared with the saline control (407 +/- 103 v 26 +/- 12 microU/mL; P <.05). 
During the insulin infusion, infants had decreased rates of total leucine flux 
(214 +/- 25 v 298 +/- 38 micromol/kg/h; P <.05) and leucine flux derived from 
protein breakdown (156 +/- 40 v 227 +/- 54 micromol/kg/h; P <.05) when compared 
with saline control. Overall, insulin administration produced a 32% reduction in 
protein breakdown (P <.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, the anabolic hormone insulin markedly reduced 
protein breakdown in critically ill infants on ECMO. Because elevated protein 
breakdown correlates with mortality and morbidity, the administration of 
intravenous insulin may ultimately have broad applicability to the metabolic 
management of critically ill infants.

Methods

Four parenterally fed infants on ECMO were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, crossover trial. Subjects were administered an insulin infusion using a 4-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp followed by a control saline infusion on consecutive days in random order. Whole-body protein flux and breakdown were quantified using a primed continuous infusion of the stable isotope l -[1- 13 C]leucine. Statistical analyses were performed using paired t tests.

Results

Serum insulin levels were increased 15-fold during the insulin clamp compared with the saline control (407 ± 103 v 26 ± 12 µU/mL; P < .05). During the insulin infusion, infants had decreased rates of total leucine flux (214 ± 25 v 298 ± 38 µmol/kg/h; P < .05) and leucine flux derived from protein breakdown (156 ± 40 v 227 ± 54 µmol/kg/h; P < .05) when compared with saline control. Overall, insulin administration produced a 32% reduction in protein breakdown ( P < .05).

Conclusions

In this pilot study, the anabolic hormone insulin markedly reduced protein breakdown in critically ill infants on ECMO. Because elevated protein breakdown correlates with mortality and morbidity, the administration of intravenous insulin may ultimately have broad applicability to the metabolic management of critically ill infants.

RESULTS

Four infants (3 boys, 1 girl) on ECMO were studied including 3 neonates beginning on day of life 5 ± 1 and 1 infant at 6 months of age. The mean gestational age of subjects was 37 ± 1 weeks with a mean weight at time of study of 3.43 ± 0.73 (range 2.50 to 5.60) kg. The following primary diagnoses were present in 1 patient each: persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, fetal hydrops, and complex congenital cardiac disease. In the 2 subjects undergoing operative repair of their primary diagnoses, the study was initiated on postoperative day 6.

At the time of the study, 2 infants were on venoarterial ECMO, and 2 were on venovenous ECMO. Flow rates ranged from 290 to 1,500 mL/min, usually at 0.1 L/kg/min, according to institutional ECMO protocol. The average time on the ECMO circuit at the start of the experimental protocol was 4 ± 1 days.

Care was taken to maintain the same PN regimen on both days of the study protocol, and there were no statistical differences in nutritional composition. On the treatment day of the study, the PN consisted of 62 ± 9 kcal/kg/d, 1.3 ± 0.3 g/kg/d protein, and 1.7 ± 0.3 g/kg/d lipid (20% lipid formulation: Intralipid, Baxter Healthcare/Fresenius Kabi Clayton LP, Clayton, NC). On the control day of the study, the PN consisted of 68 ± 15 kcal/kg/d, 1.6 ± 0.6 g/kg/d protein, and 1.6 ± 0.6 g/kg/d lipid. The glucose infusion rates before initiation of the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp were similar between experimental and control study days (8.57 ± 1.44 [4.32–10.43] v 9.54 ± 1.74 [5.08–13.52] mg/kg/min). The mean glucose infusion rate at steady state was 5.88 ± 0.44 (5.21–7.15) mg/kg/min, and, therefore, the mean total glucose infusion rate including supplemental and PN glucose at steady state was 15.41 ± 1.40 mg/kg/min.

The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp increased serum insulin levels 15-fold at steady state compared with saline infusion (407 ± 103 [185–662] v 26 ± 12 [9–59] µU/mL; P < .05; Fig 1 ). There were no episodes of hypoglycemia in any subject during the study period. The insulin infusion did not change acid-base balance or serum levels of lactic acid compared with control. Euglycemia was maintained for each subject throughout the insulin and saline infusions.

The 4-hour experimental protocol achieved physiologic steady state for [1- 13 C] α-KICA between 180 and 240 minutes ( Fig 2 ). The coefficient of variance of α-KICA enrichment at plateau was 8.4%. Total leucine turnover (leucine R a ) was significantly reduced with the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp compared with saline infusion (214 ± 25 [166–274] v 298 ± 38 [230–382] µmol/kg/h; P < .05, Fig 3A ). Exogenous leucine from PN was then subtracted from total leucine turnover for each day of the study, and the endogenous leucine turnover (ie, the plasma leucine derived from endogenous protein breakdown) was reduced by 32% with the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (156 ± 40 [83–250] v 227 ± 54 [116–342] µmol/kg/h; P < .05, Fig 3B ). When converted to whole-body protein units, the reduction in protein breakdown was 3.1 ± 0.7 g/kg/d. All 4 subjects showed a substantial reduction in endogenous leucine turnover with the intravenous insulin infusion.

The plasma-free amino acid concentration was decreased significantly after insulin infusion (159 ± 19 [108–197] v 233 ± 26 [162–286] µmol/dL; P < .05). In particular, the plasma concentration of the essential amino acid leucine was significantly decreased with the intravenous insulin infusion (9 ± 1 [7–10] v 16 ± 2 [10–18] µmol/dL; P < .05). There were no differences in CRP (5.05 ± 1.94 [1.77–17.00] v 4.43 ± 1.86 [1.21– 16.90] mg/dL; P value, not significant), a marker of critical illness severity, between insulin and control respectively.

DISCUSSION

It is well established that the systemic response to critical illness includes a dramatic mobilization of host amino acids, thereby accelerating the rate of whole-body protein breakdown. In the critically ill neonate, studies have reported a significant negative protein balance. 17 , 18 Neonates on ECMO have been found to have the highest rate of protein catabolism ever reported with a net negative protein balance of −2.3 g/kg/d. 1 The increase in protein catabolism is in contrast to the positive protein balance that the healthy neonate requires (1.5 g/kg/d). This problem is further compounded by limited neonatal body protein stores. 19 Thus, in addition to the ongoing disease process, the critically ill neonate has distinct metabolic and nutritional challenges.

Attempts at affecting protein balance in critically ill infants using conventional nutritional management have made only modest gains. Exogenous protein and caloric provisions through parenteral nutrition help to increase the synthesis of new protein but have little effect on the body’s increased protein degradation. 4 , 5 Excessive caloric allotments may increase CO 2 production rates and thereby exacerbate the ventilatory burden of the child. 6 One study of ECMO neonates has shown a possible paradoxical increase in protein breakdown with the administration of increased carbohydrate regimens. 7 Thus, research into alternative means to promote positive protein balance in this population is of metabolic interest and clinical relevance.

The current pilot study used the intravenous administration of insulin to pharmacologically modulate the rate of protein breakdown in neonates dependent on ECMO. In the data presented here, the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was associated with significant reductions in overall amino acid turnover and endogenous leucine flux, a marker of protein breakdown. The rates of protein catabolism were measured by a previously validated stable isotopic tracer technique using L-[1- 13 C]leucine. 1 , 13 , 19 Supporting the isotopic findings, insulin significantly reduced the serum concentrations of total amino acids and the essential amino acid leucine, presumably caused by the decreased degradation of protein into its constituent amino acids. Importantly, the mitigating effects of intravenous insulin on protein catabolism took place with no associated hypoglycemic complications or changes in lactate or acid-base status. The substantial reduction in protein degradation was observed after just 4 hours of insulin infusion; using these measurements, whole-body protein breakdown was reduced by 32% and equivalent to 3.1 g/kg/d.

The anabolic effects of insulin have been described previously, and numerous studies have used insulin infusions to promote protein accretion in adult volunteers and burn patients. 8 – 10 , 20 , 21 In the pediatric population, one previous study measured the effects of insulin on protein metabolism in a cohort of 4 extremely low-birth-weight neonates. 22 The investigators showed a 20% reduction in protein breakdown, although this was associated with a corresponding decrease in protein synthetic rate. The current study therefore represents the first reported use of an intravenous insulin infusion to reduce protein catabolism in a critically ill infant population.

Based on the results of this study, additional clinical investigation is warranted into the effects of intravenous insulin on the protein metabolism of critically ill infants. Although insulin appears to reduce protein breakdown in neonates on ECMO, the pattern must be confirmed in a larger population of critically ill babies. In addition, because protein metabolism is dependent on protein synthesis as well as breakdown, studies designed to measure insulin’s effects on protein synthesis are ongoing. Interestingly, several clinical studies in adults have shown an increase in protein synthesis when insulin is administered with parenteral amino acids. 9 , 10 , 23 If this finding is confirmed in parenterally fed infants, the protein-sparing effects associated with insulin would be even more substantial.

The data presented here are consistent with those reported in previous studies 22 , 24 and suggest that the experimental use of insulin infusions may be performed safely and effectively in neonates. Given the absence of nutritional methods to reduce protein breakdown, insulin may ultimately have broad applicability to the metabolic support of critically ill infants.

Discussion

W. Chwals (Cleveland OH) : This work is potentially important because it was conducted during the catabolic phase of the injury response. The study results provide a putative protein-sparing advantage during acute metabolic stress, but, if you also consider the insulin administration data that have been generated in adults and older children recovering from burns (Herndon and Wolfe), there’s a putative advantage in increasing protein synthesis as well as decreasing break-down, thus, promoting earlier growth recovery if a lower insulin dose is used. The amount of insulin you gave was 10 µU/kg/min. In the burn studies in the adults and older children, when 7.8 µU/kg/min were given for 7 days, there was a substantial glucose administration requirement to maintain appropriate glucose levels and avoid hypoglycemia. When insulin infusion was decreased to 2.6 µU/kg/min for 2 days in a similar population, muscle protein synthesis was increased without any associated proteolysis and without the requirement of excessive exogenous glucose administration. In this regard, and from a practical standpoint, how would you propose to employ insulin clinically in this patient population to optimize protein metabolic advantages while avoiding caloric overload resulting from large quantities of exogenous glucose required to maintain euglycemia? Also, why did you choose not to measure leucine oxidation, which would establish the irreversible loss of leucine carbon and would, thus, be a better indicator of catabolism? Have you considered a second clamp later in the clinical course (during the recovery stage) to help establish the degree of insulin resistance and whether that equates to acute metabolic stress?

P.J. Javid (response) : Thank you for those questions. Our main principle in this study was to demonstrate that insulin at a relatively high dose can reduce rates of protein breakdown in this population. Once this principle has been established in a cohort of critically ill pediatric patients, further studies may be performed to construct an insulin dose response curve. In this way, the optimal concentration of insulin to reduce protein catabolism but limit the risk of hypoglycemia and the amount of exogenous glucose required can then be elucidated. The second question, pertaining to leucine oxidation, is a very good question, because if you can measure leucine oxidation, you can also measure protein synthesis, which we have not included in this pilot data. Leucine oxidation is difficult to measure in this population because you need to give a small amount of isotopic bicarbonate and then measure the isotopic enrichment of carbon dioxide in that subject’s expired breath. It is difficult to perform this experiment in subjects on ECMO because it requires the removal of sweep gas from the ECMO membrane. Subsequently, these babies on ECMO develop an alkalemia. We are employing a new stable isotope technique using the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine to measure the rate of protein synthesis with the insulin infusion. And the final question about performing an additional insulin clamp in the study introduces an interesting concept because this would allow us to measure changes in both insulin resistance and protein metabolism throughout the course of acute illness. It is an experiment that we have not yet performed, but it would clearly provide valuable data in this study.
