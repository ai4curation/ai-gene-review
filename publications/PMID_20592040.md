Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are potent signal molecules rapidly generated in 
response to stress. Detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns induces 
a transient apoplastic ROS through the function of the NADPH respiratory burst 
oxidase homologs D (RbohD). However, little is known about the regulation of 
pathogen-associated molecular pattern-elicited ROS or its role in plant 
immunity. We investigated ROS production triggered by bacterial flagellin 
(flg22) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The oxidative burst was 
diminished in ethylene-insensitive mutants. Flagellin Sensitive2 (FLS2) 
accumulation was reduced in etr1 and ein2, indicating a requirement of ethylene 
signaling for FLS2 expression. Multiplication of virulent bacteria was enhanced 
in Arabidopsis lines displaying altered ROS production at early but not late 
stages of infection, suggesting an impairment of preinvasive immunity. Stomatal 
closure, a mechanism used to reduce bacterial entry into plant tissues, was 
abolished in etr1, ein2, and rbohD mutants. These results point to the 
importance of flg22-triggered ROS at an early stage of the plant immune 
response.

Abstract

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are potent signal molecules rapidly generated in response to stress. Detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns induces a transient apoplastic ROS through the function of the NADPH respiratory burst oxidase homologs D (RbohD). However, little is known about the regulation of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-elicited ROS or its role in plant immunity. We investigated ROS production triggered by bacterial flagellin (flg22) in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). The oxidative burst was diminished in ethylene-insensitive mutants. Flagellin Sensitive2 (FLS2) accumulation was reduced in etr1 and ein2 , indicating a requirement of ethylene signaling for FLS2 expression. Multiplication of virulent bacteria was enhanced in Arabidopsis lines displaying altered ROS production at early but not late stages of infection, suggesting an impairment of preinvasive immunity. Stomatal closure, a mechanism used to reduce bacterial entry into plant tissues, was abolished in etr1 , ein2 , and rbohD mutants. These results point to the importance of flg22-triggered ROS at an early stage of the plant immune response.

DISCUSSION

Among the mutant collection surveyed in this study, mutants impaired in ethylene sensing were identified as strongly diminished in the flg22-triggered oxidative burst. This is in accordance with findings that ethylene-insensitive mutants did not accumulate callose in response to flg22, whereas other hormone signaling mutants reacted like the wild type ( Clay et al., 2009 ; Millet et al., 2010 ). Altogether, ethylene sensing is required for flg22-induced ROS production and callose deposition but not for flg22-triggered MAP kinase activation, seedling growth arrest, and induced resistance ( Figs. 1 and 3 ; Zipfel et al., 2004 ; Adams-Phillips et al., 2008 ; Clay et al., 2009 ). It is evident from these findings that there are different genetic requirements for individual PAMP responses. However, different response assays likely differ in sensitivity, and the possibility that genetic redundancy obscures the importance of other than ethylene signaling pathways cannot be excluded. Indeed, the dde2 / ein2 / pad4 / sid2 quadruple mutant defective in SA, jasmonic acid, and ethylene signaling displayed reduced responsiveness in flg22-induced resistance and seedling growth arrest ( Tsuda et al., 2009 ). Noteworthy, etr1-1 represents a dominant ethylene-insensitive mutant allele, while ein2-1 and ein3-1 are loss-of-function alleles conferring complete and reduced ethylene insensitivity, respectively ( Kieber et al., 1993 ; Chao et al., 1997 ; McCourt, 1999 ).

FLS2, but not BAK1, steady-state levels were significantly lower in plants carrying strong etr1-1 and ein2-1 alleles. Moreover, etr1-1 and ein2-1 mutants accumulated reduced amounts of FLS2 transcripts. Ethylene signaling, therefore, is necessary for basal expression of FLS2. Recently, ein3-4 , a semidominant ethylene-insensitive mutant allele, was shown to accumulate less callose upon flg22 treatment and concomitantly allow enhanced bacterial multiplication compared with wild-type plants ( Chen et al., 2009 ). This is in accordance with data obtained in our study and provides evidence that FLS2 abundance may be downstream of EIN3. However, plants carrying the weak etr1-3 allele, which were reduced in flg22-induced ROS production, accumulated wild-type-like FLS2 levels. This suggests that ethylene signaling is not only required for proper FLS2 expression but also for the oxidative burst response.

Remarkably, wounding appears to counteract defects in etr1-1 and ein2-1 mutants, because both wild-type-like FLS2 levels and the flg22-triggered oxidative burst were recovered in ethylene-insensitive mutants when leaf discs instead of whole seedlings were used. EIN3-like transcription factors are transcriptionally altered in response to wounding and involved in the regulation of wound-induced genes in rice ( Oryza sativa ; Hiraga et al., 2009 ). In addition, wound signaling is mediated by MAP kinase activation via MPK6 and involves ethylene ( Schweighofer et al., 2007 ). Ethylene signaling is required for flg22-triggered dissociation of MPK6 and the ethylene response factor ERF104 ( Nühse et al., 2000 ; Bethke et al., 2009 ). Genetic interference with ERF104 function altered the growth arrest in seedlings treated with flg22. It is likely, therefore, that wounding primes ethylene-insensitive mutants competent to flg22-induced ROS production by at least partly utilizing the same signaling components.

In this study, we observed that ethylene signaling through ETR1 and EIN2 contributes to flg22-dependent stomatal closure. The etr1-1 and ein2-1 mutants were also impaired in stomatal closure when incubated with PtoDC3000 ΔAvrPto/ΔAvrPtoB bacteria and accordingly facilitated enhanced bacterial growth compared with the wild type at early stages of infection. Increased susceptibility of ethylene-insensitive mutants was described before for nonhost pathogens and when bacteria were surface inoculated ( Knoester et al., 1998 ; Pieterse et al., 1998 ; Clay et al., 2009 ). Previously reported unaltered immunity of ethylene-insensitive mutants in flg22-induced resistance might be due to hand inoculation ( Zipfel et al., 2004 ). Bacterial growth rates were comparable between mutants and the wild type later during infection, indicating a different requirement of ethylene signaling at this stage. Notably, the bacterial strain PtoDC3000 ΔAvrPto/ΔAvrPtoB is disarmed in virulence but still able to produce coronatine and therefore is able to reopen stomata and colonize leaf tissues ( Melotto et al., 2006 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ).

We revealed that RbohD contributes to restricting bacterial numbers at an early stage of infection. PAMP perception is particularly relevant at the level of preinvasive immunity. It can induce stomatal closure and thereby hinder the entry of pathogens into plant tissues ( Melotto et al., 2006 ; Zeng and He, 2010 ). We identified RbohD as specifically required for flg22- and bacteria-induced stomatal closure. This defect in PAMP-triggered stomatal closure, which would largely compromise preinvasive immunity, is likely to be the cause of elevated bacterial numbers at early but not late stages of infection. An interaction between ROS and stomatal aperture in response to flg22 is consistent with a reduced oxidative burst in mutants devoid of OST1 , another mediator of PAMP-induced stomatal closure and indicated to phosphorylate RbohF, which might also be postulated for RbohD ( Melotto et al., 2006 ; Nühse et al., 2007 ; Sirichandra et al., 2009 ).

Regulation of stomatal closure in plant immunity also involves nitric oxide and GPA1, the G-subunit of heterotrimeric G protein ( Melotto et al., 2006 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ; Zeng and He, 2010 ). GPA1-dependent ROS production through RbohD/F is necessary for stomatal closure triggered by treatment with exogenous calmodulin ( Li et al., 2009 ). Thus, ROS production is an intrinsic component regulating stomatal aperture in various stress responses. It is notable that the functions of Coronatine Insensitive1, previously identified as a crucial component of PAMP-triggered stomatal closure ( Melotto et al., 2006 ), or Abscisic acid Insensitive1 (ABI1) and ABI2, key regulators of stomatal closure upon abiotic stress ( Assmann et al., 2001 ), appear to be dispensable for flg22-induced oxidative burst.

The ETR1 receptor was previously proposed as a point of convergence for ethylene and ROS signaling in stomatal function ( Desikan et al., 2005 , 2006 ), and a role for EIN2 in ROS signaling was demonstrated in ozone-dependent accumulation of ROS ( Overmyer et al., 2000 ). Altogether, our data revealed an interaction between flg22-induced ROS production and signaling through ethylene, a hormone that itself accumulates in response to flg22. We propose that ethylene signaling contributes to basal expression of FLS2 and provide evidence for RbohD-dependent PAMP-triggered stomatal closure, which is required for proper plant immunity at early stages of infection.
