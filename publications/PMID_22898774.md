The mitotic checkpoint evolved to prevent cell division when chromosomes have 
not established connections with the chromosome segregation machinery. Many of 
the fundamental molecular principles that underlie the checkpoint, its 
spatiotemporal activation, and its timely inactivation have been uncovered. Most 
of these are conserved in eukaryotes, but important differences between species 
exist. Here we review current concepts of mitotic checkpoint activation and 
silencing. Guided by studies in model organisms and our phylogenomics analysis 
of checkpoint constituents and their functional domains and motifs, we highlight 
ancient and taxa-specific aspects of the core checkpoint modules in the context 
of mitotic checkpoint function.
