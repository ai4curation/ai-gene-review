The human CDC25 tyrosine phosphatases trigger activation of CDC2 by removing 
inhibitory phosphates; thus the genes encoding these phosphatases may be 
suspected as potential oncogenes due to their role in promoting cell division. 
To date, three human CDC25 genes have been identified: CDC25A, B, and C. This 
communication describes the mapping of CDC25A to chromosome 3p21 and CDC25B to 
chromosome 20p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization with confirmation by the 
polymerase chain reaction of hamster-human somatic cell hybrid DNA. 3p21 is near 
an area frequently involved in karyotypic abnormalities in renal carcinomas, 
small cell carcinomas of the lung, and benign tumors of the salivary gland. 
20p13 does not seem to be a common area for karyotypic alteration in tumors. 
Mapping of these genes to their chromosomal loci may help identify tumors with 
abnormal regulation of CDC25 genes due to genomic alterations.
