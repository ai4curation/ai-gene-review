To identify target genes for the hemizygous deletions of chromosome 13 that are 
recurrently observed in malignant gliomas, we performed genome-wide DNA 
copy-number analysis using array-based comparative genomic hybridization and 
gene expression analysis using an oligonucleotide-array. The response gene to 
complement 32 (RGC32) at 13q14.11 was identified as a deletion target, and its 
expression was frequently silenced in glioma cell lines compared with normal 
brain. Levels of RGC32 mRNA tended to decrease toward higher grades of primary 
astrocytomas, especially in tumors with mutations of p53. Expression of RGC32 
mRNA was dramatically increased by exogenous p53 in a p53-mutant glioma cell 
line, and also by endogenous p53 in response to DNA damage in p53+/+ 
colon-cancer cells, but not in isogenic p53-/- cells. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation and reporter assays demonstrated binding of endogenous p53 
protein to the promoter region of the RGC32 gene, implying p53-dependent 
transcriptional activity. Transiently and stably overexpressed RGC32 suppressed 
the growth of glioma cells, probably owing to induction of G2/M arrest. 
Immunocytochemical analysis revealed a concentration of RGC32 protein at the 
centrosome during mitosis. RGC32 formed a protein complex with polo-like kinase 
1 and was phosphorylated in vitro. These observations implied a novel mechanism 
by which p53 might negatively regulate cell-cycle progression by way of this 
newly identified transcriptional target. Our results provide the first evidence 
that RGC32 might be a possible tumor-suppressor for glioma, that it is directly 
induced by p53, and that it mediates the arrest of mitotic progression.
