Calreticulin is an intracellular protein known to be involved in calcium 
binding, but is also known to appear as an autoantigen in certain autoimmune 
diseases. The cDNA sequence is known but the protein has not yet been well 
characterized at the amino acid level. Owing to the possible involvement of this 
protein in autoimmune disease and with the aim of making monoclonal antibodies 
for use in assay development and immunohistochemistry, we have purified 
calreticulin using human placental material. Amino acid analysis of the purified 
protein confirmed the cDNA-derived composition, and only one discrepancy between 
the cDNA-predicted sequence and the amino acid sequence was found by peptide 
mapping and microsequencing. The protein contains one disulfide bridge and has 
one free SH group and the protein is neither glycosylated nor phosphorylated. 
Affinity chromatography of a placental protein extract on a column with 
immobilized calreticulin showed the existence of at least six proteins 
interacting with calreticulin. Using the purified calreticulin in Western blots, 
two out of eight patients with autoimmune disease diagnosed as having anti DNA 
antibodies in their serum were found also to contain autoantibodies to 
calreticulin in their serum.
