Human mesangial cells secrete tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and 
plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), the latter being secreted in large 
excess in vitro. We demonstrate that PAI-1 is a major component of the 
extracellular matrix of cultured human mesangial cells, where its deposition is 
dependent on cell density. By immunogold silver staining, epipolarization 
microscopy and dispersive X-ray spectrometry, we have shown that 
matrix-associated PAI-1 is synthesized by spreading human mesangial cells, as 
indicated by the time-dependent accumulation of PAI-1 and the inhibitory effect 
of cycloheximide. Furthermore, by in situ hybridization, PAI-1 mRNA was detected 
in cultured mesangial cells. t-PA is present inside the cells, or at the cell 
surface, but is never associated with the extracellular matrix. Exogenous t-PA 
can remove matrix-associated PAI-1 without affecting cell adhesion. A similar 
effect was obtained by addition of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) 
but not with fibrinolysis unrelated enzymes. In conclusion, PAI-1 is synthesized 
by human cultured mesangial cells and is deposited in the extracellular matrix 
by nonconfluent cells, whereas less PAI-1 is seen between confluent cells. This 
can explain the absence of detectable PAI-1 in normal human kidney biopsies. 
t-PA released by mesangial cells can bind and detach matrix PAI-1.
