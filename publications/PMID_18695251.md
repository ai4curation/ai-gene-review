AIMP2/p38 is a scaffolding protein required for the assembly of the 
macromolecular tRNA synthetase complex. Here, we describe a previously unknown 
function for AIMP2 as a positive regulator of p53 in response to genotoxic 
stresses. Depletion of AIMP2 increased resistance to DNA damage-induced 
apoptosis, and introduction of AIMP2 into AIMP2-deficient cells restored the 
susceptibility to apoptosis. Upon DNA damage, AIMP2 was phosphorylated, 
dissociated from the multi-tRNA synthetase complex, and translocated into the 
nuclei of cells. AIMP2 directly interacts with p53, thereby preventing 
MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Mutations in AIMP2, 
affecting its interaction with p53, hampered its ability to activate p53. 
Nutlin-3 recovered the level of p53 and the susceptibility to UV-induced cell 
death in AIMP2-deficient cells. This work demonstrates that AIMP2, a component 
of the translational machinery, functions as proapoptotic factor via p53 in 
response to DNA damage.

Abstract

AIMP2/p38 is a scaffolding protein required for the assembly of the macromolecular tRNA synthetase complex. Here, we describe a previously unknown function for AIMP2 as a positive regulator of p53 in response to genotoxic stresses. Depletion of AIMP2 increased resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and introduction of AIMP2 into AIMP2-deficient cells restored the susceptibility to apoptosis. Upon DNA damage, AIMP2 was phosphorylated, dissociated from the multi-tRNA synthetase complex, and translocated into the nuclei of cells. AIMP2 directly interacts with p53, thereby preventing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Mutations in AIMP2, affecting its interaction with p53, hampered its ability to activate p53. Nutlin-3 recovered the level of p53 and the susceptibility to UV-induced cell death in AIMP2-deficient cells. This work demonstrates that AIMP2, a component of the translational machinery, functions as proapoptotic factor via p53 in response to DNA damage.

Discussion

In this article, we have shown that AIMP2 works as a proapoptotic factor via a direct interaction with p53. Because c-Myc can also activate p53 and enhance p53-dependent apoptosis ( 26 ), we were curious to see whether the up-regulation of c-Myc in the absence of AIMP2 ( 12 ) would result in the activation of p53. Although levels of FBP and c-Myc in AIMP2-deficient cells are actually higher than in WT cells ( 12 ), the level of p53 and its activity are more suppressed, implying that the pathway of AIMP2 to p53 would not be directly linked to the AIMP2-FBP-c-Myc pathway in response to TGF-β or the up-regulation of c-Myc in response to UV irradiation ( 27 ).

EPRS was previously shown to be phosphorylated and dissociated from the complex by IFN-γ treatment to form a new multiprotein complex that suppresses translation of specific transcripts ( 28 ). However, EPRS does not seem to be mobilized by UV irradiation ( Fig. 2 D ), suggesting that the components of the multi-ARS complex respond differentially to incoming stimuli. Despite the importance of AIMP2 for the integrity of the multi-ARS complex ( 11 , 14 ), the assembly of the whole complex does not seem to be significantly affected by the UV-dependent dissociation of AIMP2. Perhaps the majority of the complex remains intact because the amount of AIMP2 dissociated from the multi-ARS complex upon UV irradiation appears to be minor ( Fig. 2 A and H ). Second, there may be a mechanism to sustain the integrity of the complex through additional modification of other components or refilling the space of AIMP2 with other factor(s) after its dissociation. Third, the disassembly of the complex may occur in a sequential manner rather than simultaneously after the departure of AIMP2. It was not yet determined whether AIMP2 dissociated from multi-ARS complex would exist as a free form or would form another complex with other cellular factors. Considering that EPRS dissociated from the complex by IFN-γ forms another multisubunit complex called GAIT, AIMP2 could be recruited to other protein complexes, which may be necessary for the maintenance of cellular stability, nuclear translocation, or the interaction of AIMP2 with p53. Although the interaction of AIMP2 with p53 should be efficient and rapid enough to block the attack of MDM2, AIMP2 should also be able to dissociate from p53 to make way for subsequent processes involving p53. In fact, we observed that AIMP2 showed a decreased affinity toward phosphorylated p53 (data not shown).

Although JNK was shown to be the kinase responsible for the UV-induced phosphorylation of AIMP2, and AIMP2 contains a putative JNK recognition site (data not shown), it is yet to be determined whether JNK is actually the direct upstream kinase of AIMP2. Because the nuclear interaction of AIMP2 with p53 takes place rapidly after UV irradiation, there might be a mechanism involving JNK rapidly responding to UV irradiation that would lead to the activation of AIMP2. Although the early response of AIMP2 involves its posttranslational modification, continuous exposure to genotoxic stresses may accompany the regulation at transcriptional level to refill the depletion of cytosolic portion of AIMP2. Although these questions remain to be solved, the results of this work suggest the existence of tight communication between the cytosolic and nuclear machinery during the maintenance of chromosome integrity and AIMP2 functioning as a unique liaison between them working toward p53 activation during genotoxic stresses. This work also demonstrates that the multi-ARS complex is a molecular reservoir responding to DNA damage, in addition to its role during protein synthesis.

p53 is finely regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels ( 29 ). Among the diverse pathways leading to p53 activation, AIMP2 appears to specifically respond to DNA damage involving MDM2 but not to regulation by HDAC inhibition or by mitogen treatment ( Fig. 3 F ). Although mitogenic signals such as EGF can also activate p53 via the suppression of MDM2 ( 20 ), they may not trigger nuclear localization of AIMP2, unlike the stress induced by DNA damage. Although the regulation mechanisms of p53 have been intensively studied for the last decade ( 29 – 31 ), more regulation mechanisms are expected to be found. Because the balance between p53 and MDM2 is critical for the determination of cell fate, tight feedback regulation of p53 is necessary to prevent the unnecessary hyperactivation of p53 ( 32 ). The fine tuning of p53 with a battery of diverse regulators is reflected by the damped oscillations between p53 and MDM2 after DNA damage ( 33 ).

It is not clear why AIMP2 has evolved as a modulator of p53. One possibility is that AIMP2 can rapidly respond to genotoxic stresses because it is ubiquitously present as a component of the translational machinery. In addition, p53 has been known to function as a repressor of RNA polymerase III transcription and inhibits the synthesis of essential small RNAs including tRNAs ( 34 ). Therefore, AIMP2 may control tRNA synthesis in coordination with p53 activation, although its role in the regulation of translation requires further investigation. In summary, this work suggests that AIMP2, a scaffolding component of the translational machinery, is a positive and direct regulator of p53 with a unique working mechanism. This work also suggests a potential coordination between cytosolic protein synthesis and nuclear DNA metabolism.
