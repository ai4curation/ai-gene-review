Class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate a variety of cellular processes, 
including cardiac growth, bone development, and specification of skeletal muscle 
fiber type. Multiple serine/threonine kinases control the subcellular 
localization of these HDACs by phosphorylation of common serine residues, but 
whether certain class IIa HDACs respond selectively to specific kinases has not 
been determined. Here we show that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II 
(CaMKII) signals specifically to HDAC4 by binding to a unique docking site that 
is absent in other class IIa HDACs. Phosphorylation of HDAC4 by CaMKII promotes 
nuclear export and prevents nuclear import of HDAC4, with consequent 
derepression of HDAC target genes. In cardiomyocytes, CaMKII phosphorylation of 
HDAC4 results in hypertrophic growth, which can be blocked by a signal-resistant 
HDAC4 mutant. These findings reveal a central role for HDAC4 in CaMKII signaling 
pathways and have implications for the control of gene expression by calcium 
signaling in a variety of cell types.
