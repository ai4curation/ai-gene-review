Specific granule protein of 28 kDa (SGP28), also termed cysteine-rich secretory 
protein 3 (CRISP-3), is a glycoprotein that belongs to a family of cysteine-rich 
secretory proteins (CRISPs). SGP28 was originally discovered in human 
neutrophils, but transcripts are widely distributed in exocrine glands (salivary 
glands, pancreas, and prostate) and also found at lower levels in epididymis, 
ovary, thymus, and colon. The function of SGP28/CRISP-3 is not yet known. 
Similarities to pathogenesis-related proteins in plants and the expression in 
neutrophils and exocrine glands suggest that SGP28/CRISP-3 may play a role in 
innate host defense. We describe here the production of a recombinant, 
C-terminally truncated form of CRISP-3 (rCRISP-3Delta) and the generation of 
polyclonal antibodies against rCRISP-3Delta that are useful in immunoblotting 
and immunocytochemistry. We present a specific, accurate, and reproducible 
enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) for the measurement of CRISP-3 with a 
detection limit of 2 ng/ml. We further demonstrate the presence of CRISP-3 
protein in human plasma (6.3 microg/ml), saliva (21.8 microg/ml), seminal plasma 
(11.2 microg/ml), and sweat (0.15 microg/ml), and describe the coexistence of 
two different molecular weight forms of CRISP-3, representing an N-glycosylated 
and a non-glycosylated form of the mature protein.
