Components of caveolae and lipid rafts are characterized by their buoyancy after 
detergent extraction. Using flotations in density gradients, we now show that 
non-raft membrane molecules are also associated with detergent-insoluble, 
buoyant assemblies. When Triton X-100 cellular extracts were spun to equilibrium 
in Nycodenz, only components of classical rafts floated. In contrast, with the 
zwitterionic detergent CHAPS, non-raft residents such as calnexin and APP also 
buoyed. When CHAPS extracts were spun in non-equilibrium (velocity) conditions, 
some raft components rapidly exited the input fractions while other raft markers 
and non-raft molecules remained relatively immobile. This pointed to size 
heterogeneities of CHAPS-insoluble complexes. Combined velocity/equilibrium 
gradients broadly divided CHAPS-insoluble membrane complexes into three size 
categories, which all contained cholesterol and the glycosphingolipid GM1. Large 
complexes were enriched in caveolin and ESA. Medium size complexes were enriched 
in PrP, whereas small complexes contained non-raft proteins, PrP, and some ESA. 
While Alzheimer's APP was primarily confined to small assemblies, a portion of 
its glycosylated form did buoy with large complexes. Large CHAPS-insoluble 
complexes resemble, but are not equal to, classical rafts. These findings extend 
considerably the range of detergent-insoluble membranal domains.
