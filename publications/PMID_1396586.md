The crystal structure of the homodimeric BB isoform of human recombinant 
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) has been determined by X-ray analysis 
to 3.0 A resolution. The polypeptide chain is folded into two highly twisted 
antiparallel pairs of beta-strands and contains an unusual knotted arrangement 
of three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Dimerization leads to the clustering of 
three surface loops at each end of the elongated dimer, which most probably form 
the receptor recognition sites.
