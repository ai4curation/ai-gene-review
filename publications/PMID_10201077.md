Photomorphogenic development in Arabidopsis is regulated by the key repressor 
COP1, which interacts with specific transcription factors in the nucleus to 
modulate their activities. In the dark, COP1 accumulates in the nucleus and 
represses photomorphogenic development. Light diminishes the nuclear 
accumulation of COP1 and abrogates its repressor activity. A number of cellular 
components are involved in light-dependent nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of 
COP1, including the multisubunit COP9 complexes and at least three 
well-characterized photoreceptors. This review discusses current understanding 
of the mechanisms of COP1 action.
