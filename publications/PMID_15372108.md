complex I deficiency, the most common respiratory chain defect, is genetically 
heterogeneous: mutations in 8 nuclear and 7 mitochondrial DNA genes encoding 
complex I subunits have been described. However, these genes account for disease 
in only a minority of complex I-deficient patients. We investigated whether 
there may be an unknown common gene by performing functional complementation 
analysis of cell lines from 10 unrelated patients. Two of the patients were 
found to have mitochondrial DNA mutations. The other 8 represented 7 different 
(nuclear) complementation groups, all but 1 of which showed abnormalities of 
complex I assembly. It is thus unlikely that any one unknown gene accounts for a 
large proportion of complex I cases. The 2 patients sharing a nuclear 
complementation group had a similar abnormal complex I assembly profile and were 
studied further by homozygosity mapping, chromosome transfers, and microarray 
expression analysis. NDUFS6, a complex I subunit gene not previously associated 
with complex I deficiency, was grossly underexpressed in the 2 patient cell 
lines. Both patients had homozygous mutations in this gene, one causing a 
splicing abnormality and the other a large deletion. This integrated approach to 
gene identification offers promise for identifying other unknown causes of 
respiratory chain disorders.
