The DNA mismatch repair machinery is involved in the correction of a wide 
variety of mutational intermediates. In bacterial cells, homodimers of the MutS 
protein bind mismatches and MutL homodimers couple mismatch recognition to 
downstream processing steps [1]. Eukaryotes possess multiple MutS and MutL 
homologs that form discrete, heterodimeric complexes with specific mismatch 
recognition and repair properties. In yeast, there are six MutS (Msh1-6p) and 
four MutL (Mlh1-3p and Pms1p) family members [2] [3]. Heterodimers comprising 
Msh2p and Msh3p or Msh2p and Msh6p recognize mismatches in nuclear DNA [4] [5] 
and the subsequent processing steps most often involve a Mlh1p-Pms1P heterodimer 
[6] [7]. Mlh1p also forms heterodimeric complexes with Mlh2p and Mlh3p [8], and 
a minor role for Mlh3p in nuclear mismatch repair has been reported [9]. No 
mismatch repair function has yet been assigned to the fourth yeast MutL homolog, 
Mlh2p, although mlh2 mutants exhibit weak resistance to some DNA damaging agents 
[10]. We have used two frameshift reversion assays to examine the roles of the 
yeast Mlh2 and Mlh3 proteins in vivo. This analysis demonstrates, for the first 
time, that yeast Mlh2p plays a role in the repair of mutational intermediates, 
and extends earlier results implicating Mlh3p in mismatch repair.
