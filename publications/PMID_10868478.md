Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a compound occurring naturally in cruciferous 
vegetables and has been indicated as a promising agent in preventing breast 
cancer development and progression. In the present study we have investigated 
the effect of I3C on the cell migration and invasion behavior in estrogen 
receptor positive MCF-7 and estrogen receptor negative MDA-MB-468 human breast 
cancer cell lines. Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 were poorly invasive cell lines and 
exhibited modest invasion and migration capacity in the presence of fibronectin 
as the chemoattractant. I3C (50 or 100 microM) elicited a significant inhibition 
of in vitro cell adhesion, migration, and invasion as well as in vivo lung 
metastasis formation in both cell lines. I3C also suppressed the 
17beta-estradiol stimulated migration and invasion in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 
cells. These results indicate that anti-invasion and antimigration activities of 
I3C occur via estrogen-independent and estrogen-dependent pathways. Moreover, 
I3C significantly caused a dose-dependent increase in E-cadherin, three major 
catenins (alpha, beta, and gamma-catenin) and BRCA1 expression. Our current 
finding is the first demonstration that I3C can activate the function of 
invasion suppressor molecules associated with the suppression of invasion and 
migration in breast cancer cells. Thus, clinical application of I3C may 
contribute to the potential benefit for suppression of breast cancer invasion 
and metastasis.
