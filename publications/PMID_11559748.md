A multivesicular body is a vesicle-filled endosome that targets proteins to the 
interior of lysosomes. We have identified a conserved eukaryotic protein, human 
CHMP1, which is strongly implicated in multivesicular body formation. 
Immunocytochemistry and biochemical fractionation localize CHMP1 to early 
endosomes and CHMP1 physically interacts with SKD1/VPS4, a highly conserved 
protein directly linked to multivesicular body sorting in yeast. Similar to the 
action of a mutant SKD1 protein, overexpression of a fusion derivative of human 
CHMP1 dilates endosomal compartments and disrupts the normal distribution of 
several endosomal markers. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae further 
support a conserved role of CHMP1 in vesicle trafficking. Deletion of CHM1, the 
budding yeast homolog of CHMP1, results in defective sorting of 
carboxypeptidases S and Y and produces abnormal, multi-lamellar prevacuolar 
compartments. This phenotype classifies CHM1 as a member of the class E vacuolar 
protein sorting genes. Yeast Chm1p belongs to a structurally-related, but rather 
divergent family of proteins, including Vps24p and Snf7p and three novel 
proteins, Chm2p, Chm5p and Chm6p, which are all essential for multivesicular 
body sorting. These observations identify the conserved CHMP/Chmp family as a 
set of proteins fundamental to understanding multivesicular body sorting in 
eukaryotic organisms.
