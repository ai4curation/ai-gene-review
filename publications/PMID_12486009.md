Abstract

The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) binds to the pre-mRNA 5′ splice site (ss) at early stages of spliceosome assembly. Recruitment of U1 to a class of weak 5′ ss is promoted by binding of the protein TIA-1 to uridine-rich sequences immediately downstream from the 5′ ss. Here we describe a molecular dissection of the activities of TIA-1. RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) 2 and 3 are necessary and sufficient for binding to the pre-mRNA. The non- consensus RRM1 and the C-terminal glutamine-rich (Q) domain are required for association with U1 snRNP and to facilitate its recruitment to 5′ ss. Co-precipitation experiments revealed a specific and direct interaction involving the N-terminal region of the U1 protein U1-C and the Q-rich domain of TIA-1, an interaction enhanced by RRM1. The results argue that binding of TIA-1 in the vicinity of a 5′ ss helps to stabilize U1 snRNP recruitment, at least in part, via a direct interaction with U1-C, thus providing one molecular mechanism for the function of this splicing regulator.

Introduction

The excision of introns from mRNA precursors is important to generate translatable mRNAs in higher eukaryotes. The process is often regulated to generate alternatively spliced transcripts able to encode distinct proteins ( Hastings and Krainer, 2001 ; Will and Lührmann, 2001 ; Modrek and Lee, 2002 ). The chemical process of intron removal occurs within the spliceosome, a complex of >100 polypeptides and five uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U snRNPs) assembled on the pre-mRNA ( Nilsen, 2002 ; Zhou and Reed, 2002 ).

U1 snRNP recognizes the 5′ splice site (ss) and is among the first factors to interact with the pre-mRNA to form complexes (complex E in mammalian extracts) that commit the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway ( Ruby and Abelson, 1988 ; Séraphin and Rosbash 1989 ; Michaud and Reed, 1991 , 1993 ). Human U1 snRNP is composed of a 165 nucleotide RNA (U1 snRNA), seven different Sm proteins common to other snRNPs and three U1-specific polypeptides: U1-70K, U1-A and U1-C ( Lührmann et al ., 1990 ). The sequence of the 5′ end of U1 snRNA is complementary to the 5′ ss region ( Rinke et al ., 1984 ), and stem–loops I and II are bound directly by U1-70K and U1-A, respectively. A uridine-rich motif, the Sm site, is bound by the Sm proteins, most probably forming a ring-like structure around the Sm site ( Hamm et al ., 1987 ; Patton and Pederson 1988 ; Scherly et al ., 1989 , 1990 ; Lutz-Freyermuth et al ., 1990 ; Kambach et al ., 1999 ). U1-C does not interact directly with naked U1 snRNA, but depends on other U1 protein components for association with the snRNP. Interactions have been detected between the N-terminal 45 amino acids of U1-C, which include a zinc finger-like motif, and U1-70K, as well as with the Sm proteins B′/B ( Nelissen et al ., 1994 ). This region of U1-C has been shown to stimulate formation or stabilization of complex E ( Will et al ., 1996 ). In contrast, reconstituted snRNPs lacking U1-A, or lacking the binding sites for U1-A or U1-70K, can support splicing and complex E formation ( Will et al ., 1996 ). These results indicate that U1-C plays an important role in U1 snRNP function. Recent results indicate that U1-C recognizes the sequence of the 5′ ss, and argue that this RNA–protein recognition precedes base pairing with U1 snRNA ( Du and Rosbash, 2002 ).

Comprehensive biochemical and mass spectrometric analysis of the composition of yeast U1 snRNP revealed the association of four polypeptides not observed in purified preparations of human U1 ( Gottschalk et al ., 1998 ). One of these, the protein Nam8p, interacts with sequences downstream from the 5′ ss and modulates U1 snRNP binding ( Puig et al ., 1999 ). A human homolog of Nam8p, the protein TIA-1, has been shown to bind to uridine-rich sequences downstream from 5′ ss and promote U1 snRNP binding ( Del Gatto et al ., 2000 ; Förch et al ., 2000 ; Le Guiner et al ., 2001b ).

TIA-1 is composed of three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal Q-rich domain (Figure 1 A) ( Tian et al ., 1991 ). Here we identify domains of TIA-1 required for pre-mRNA recognition, association with U1 snRNP and recruitment of U1 snRNP to 5′ ss. We report that the U1-C protein interacts directly with TIA-1 and, based on the results of functional domain analysis, we propose that this interaction is important for the recruitment of U1 snRNP by TIA-1.

Results

TIA-1 was reported to cross-link to uridine-rich regions downstream of 5′ ss of Drosophila msl-2 and the human Fas receptor pre-mRNAs ( Förch et al., 2000 ). To identify domains of TIA-1 required for pre-mRNA recognition, mobility shift assays were carried out using a battery of domain deletion mutants (Figure 1 A) and in vitro transcribed RNAs containing the msl-2 5′ ss region. Binding of individual RRM domains was only detectable with RRM2 (Figure 1 B, lanes 18–20). A protein including RRMs 2 and 3 bound the RNA with essentially the same affinity as the full-length protein (compare lanes 2–4 with 12–14, apparent K D 3 × 10 –8 M), while a construct composed of RRMs 1 and 2 displayed the same affinity as RRM2 alone (compare lanes 8–10 with 18–20, apparent K D 3 × 10 –7 M). The presence of the C-terminal Q-rich domain did not increase RNA binding (compare lanes 2–4 with 5–7), although it caused some retention of the complexes at the origin of the gel. Taken together, the binding data argue that pre-mRNA recognition is achieved by RRMs 2 and 3, which is consistent with previous results indicating that these domains can select uridine-rich sequences from a random pool of RNAs ( Dember et al., 1996 ).

Discussion

Recent work has shown that the yeast protein Nam8p is a component of U1 snRNP that cross-links to a region of the pre-mRNA downstream from the 5′ ss, modulates U1 snRNP binding depending on the sequence present in that region and facilitates U1 snRNP assembly on weak 5′ ss or uncapped substrates ( Gottschalk et al ., 1998 ; Puig et al ., 1999 ; Zhang and Rosbash, 1999 ). These activities resemble those of TIA-1 in the mammalian system ( Del Gatto et al ., 2000 ; Förch et al ., 2000 ; Le Guiner et al ., 2001b ) and, together with the significant amino acid sequence homology between Nam8p and TIA-1, suggest that the two proteins are functional homologs. A difference between the two systems, however, is that only a limited fraction of the U1 snRNP pool in HeLa nuclear extracts is associated with TIA-1 (Figure 3 A), while Nam8p is a stable component of yeast U1. This could be due to relatively weak interactions between TIA-1 and U1 when not assembled on a 5′ ss region. It is conceivable that a less tight association between TIA-1 and U1 snRNP serves to make their mutual stabilizing interactions on 5′ ss more sensitive to regulation, for example by independent modulation of the levels or activity of TIA-1. Alternatively, TIA-1 may associate with a subpopulation of U1 snRNP.

The observation that U1-70K was not detectable in precipitates of pull-down experiments using GST–TIA-1, which contained all other U1 components (see Supplementary data), opens up the possibility that U1 snRNP particles devoid of U1-70K can be recruited to certain 5′ ss by TIA-1. Interestingly, both TIA-1 and U1-70K can interact with the N-terminal region of U1-C ( Nelissen et al ., 1994 ; Figure 7 ). It cannot be ruled out, however, that U1-70K was not lost during the GST–TIA-1 pull-down procedure, which would be more consistent with the observation that TIA-1 can be found in precipitates of U1-70K and vice versa (Figure 3 C; Supplementary data).

Several splicing regulators have been shown to modulate U1 snRNP binding to 5′ ss. This is in agreement with the idea that regulation often occurs at the earliest steps in spliceosome assembly that commit pre-mRNAs to the splicing pathway. Thus, the Drosophila regulator Sex-lethal has been shown to bind to uridine-rich sequences downstream from the 5′ ss of an intron at the 5′-untranslated region of msl-2 and prevent U1 snRNP binding by antagonizing TIA-1 activity ( Förch et al., 2001 ).

The SR protein ASF/SF2 promotes U1 snRNP binding and modulates 5′ ss choice, most probably by equalizing differences in U1 binding affinity ( Kohtz et al ., 1994 ; Eperon et al ., 2000 ). Protein–protein interactions between the arginine- and serine- (RS) rich domain of ASF/SF2 and a similar domain in U1-70K have been shown to be important for this activity ( Wu and Maniatis, 1993 ; Kohtz et al ., 1994 ; Cao and García-Blanco, 1998 ).

The Drosophila splicing regulator PSI is important for restriction of P element transposition to the germline. PSI protein is expressed only in the soma, where it is required for splicing inhibition of P element third intron ( Siebel et al., 1994 , 1995 ; Adams et al., 1997 ). PSI is part of a repressive complex that sequesters U1 snRNP at a cryptic, non-productive 5′ ss upstream from the bona fide 5′ ss ( Siebel et al., 1992 ). PSI has been shown to bind directly to U1-70K, and this interaction is important for the regulatory function of PSI ( Labourier et al., 2001 ). The region of PSI that contacts U1-70K has similarities to a sequence within KSRP, a protein that has been involved in alternative splicing of c- src exon N ( Min et al., 1997 ). It is therefore possible that interaction with U1-70K is also at the basis of the regulatory activity of KSRP ( Labourier et al., 2001 ).

The results of Figures 3 – 7 point to U1-C as one U1 snRNP component involved in direct protein–protein interactions with TIA-1. U1-C has been shown to be required for spliceosome assembly in yeast ( Tang et al ., 1997 ) and mammals ( Heinrichs et al ., 1990 ; Will et al ., 1996 ). The protein can be cross-linked to the 5′ ss region and is responsible for the first recognition event of the 5′ ss sequence, most probably preceding and/or facilitating base pairing of U1 snRNA with the 5′ ss ( Tang et al ., 1997 ; Zhang and Rosbash, 1999 ; Du and Rosbash, 2002 ). As TIA-1 binds to the uridine-rich stretch immediately downstream from the 5′ ss ( Förch et al ., 2000 ), it is conceivable that the TIA-1–U1-C interaction can stabilize the association of both proteins (and consequently of U1 snRNP) with their adjacent binding sites (Figure 8 ). Cryo-electron microscopy studies ( Stark et al ., 2001 ) could be instrumental in validating or modifying this model.

Interestingly, several other proteins have been shown to contact U1-C and be implicated in splicing regulation. The gene EWS encodes a transcription factor, and its translocation is often associated with progression of a variety of tumors. Translocation of the EWS locus to the gene encoding another transcription factor, FLI, or that encoding the nuclear receptor NOR1 gives rise to fusion proteins that have been shown to have, in addition to abnormal properties as transcriptional activators, the ability to alter 5′ ss selection ( Knoop and Baker, 2000 , 2001 ; Ohkura et al ., 2002 ). Interestingly, both EWS/FLI and EWS/NOR1 interact with U1-C and, remarkably, EWS/NOR1 expression can complement loss-of-function mutants of snu23p, a component of yeast spliceosomes ( Gottschalk et al ., 1998 ; Knoop and Baker, 2000 ; Ohkura et al ., 2002 ). These observations open up the possibility that the regulatory activities of these proteins are based on direct contacts with U1-C, as for TIA-1.

The interaction of TIA-1 with U1-C requires a region of the protein that includes the cystidine/histidine zinc finger-like motif ( Nelissen et al ., 1991 ), which is essential for interaction with U1 snRNP ( Nelissen et al ., 1994 ) and also for homodimerization ( Gunnewiek et al ., 1995 ). The fact that mutations that disrupt these structural elements do not compromise TIA-1 binding (Figure 7 B) argue that distinct surfaces mediate U1 snRNP attachment and TIA-1 binding.

Both RRM1 and the Q-rich domain contribute to U1-C binding, association with U1 snRNP and snRNP recruitment to 5′ ss (Figures 2 , 4 and 6 ). While Q-rich domains have often been involved in protein–protein interactions ( McBride and Silver, 2001 ), the RRM fold is a characteristic RNA-binding module ( Varani and Nagai, 1998 ). RRM1, however, does not contribute to binding to the pre-mRNA, as expected from the presence of negatively charged residues within a conserved octamer motif involved in direct contacts with RNA ( Varani and Nagai, 1998 ). Protein–protein interactions mediated by RRM domains, however, have also been reported previously ( Scherly et al ., 1990 ; Kielkopf et al ., 2001 ).

While RRM1 was essential for association of TIA-1 with U1 snRNP (Figure 4 ), and contributes significantly to U1 snRNP recruitment, even in the absence of the Q-rich domain (Figure 2 ), it failed to show by itself detectable binding to U1-C (Figure 6 C). It promoted, however, binding to U1-C in the presence of the Q-rich domain (Figure 6 E). It is possible that the U1-C-binding activity of RRM1 will be maximal only in the context of the complete protein, or upon recognition of the pre-mRNA by RRMs 2 and 3. Alternatively, RRM1 could contribute to U1 snRNP recruitment through other mechanisms in addition to facilitating contacts with U1-C (Figure 8 ). Finally, it is also possible that quantitative differences between activities for the various domain mutants are due to inherent differences in the stringency or detection levels of the assays used. In this context, it is worth noting that U1 snRNP binding involves multiple RNA–RNA, protein– RNA and protein–protein interactions, and that even the well-established base-pairing interactions between the 5′ end of U1 snRNA and the 5′ ss can be dispensable under certain experimental conditions ( Du and Rosbash, 2001 , 2002 ; Lund and Kjems, 2002 ).

Previous work has shown that TIA-1 modulates alternative splicing of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 2 ( Del Gatto et al., 2000 ). TIA-1 promotes inclusion of the K-SAM exon by binding downstream from the 5′ ss associated with the exon. The mechanism of TIA-1 function on this pre-mRNA can therefore be assimilated easily with that in msl-2 : higher levels of TIA-1 activity will promote U1 snRNP assembly on exon K-SAM 5′ ss and therefore K-SAM exon inclusion. Additional cis -acting elements contribute to fine tuning of this splicing event ( Del Gatto et al., 1997 ; Le Guiner et al., 2001a ).

In summary, our results provide one molecular mechanism for how TIA-1 can promote U1 snRNP recruitment to 5′ ss by portraying a direct interaction between TIA-1 and U1-C as an important component of these effects.
