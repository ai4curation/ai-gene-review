Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a high-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor. 
The transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1 play crucial roles in promoting 
malignant behavior and survival of human SCLC cell lines. Here, we find that 
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 identify heterogeneity in SCLC, bind distinct genomic loci, 
and regulate mostly distinct genes. ASCL1, but not NEUROD1, is present in mouse 
pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, and only ASCL1 is required in vivo for tumor 
formation in mouse models of SCLC. ASCL1 targets oncogenic genes including 
MYCL1, RET, SOX2, and NFIB while NEUROD1 targets MYC. ASCL1 and NEUROD1 regulate 
different genes that commonly contribute to neuronal function. ASCL1 also 
regulates multiple genes in the NOTCH pathway including DLL3. Together, ASCL1 
and NEUROD1 distinguish heterogeneity in SCLC with distinct genomic landscapes 
and distinct gene expression programs.
