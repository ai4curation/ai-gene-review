Destruction of the transcriptional inhibitor IkappaB by the ubiquitin (Ub) 
system is required for signal-dependent activation of the multifunctional 
transcriptional factor NF-kappaB, but details of this ubiquitination are largely 
unknown. We report here that the IkappaBalpha-ubiquitin ligase (IkappaBalpha-E3) 
is an SCF-like complex containing Skp1, cullin-1, and two homologous 
F-box/WD40-repeat proteins, betaTrCP1 and betaTrCP2. Intriguingly, all these 
components are cooperatively recruited to bind to a phosphorylated IkappaBalpha 
(pIkappaBalpha) produced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulation. 
IkappaBalpha-E3 bound to pIkappaBalpha catalyzed in vitro ubiquitination of 
pIkappaBalpha in the presence of ATP, Ub, and E1-activating and E2-conjugating 
enzymes. Forced expression of betaTrCP1 and betaTrCP2 resulted in dramatic 
augmentation of the in vitro polyubiquitination activity of IkappaBalpha-E3. 
These results indicate that the long-sought IkappaBalpha-E3 is an SCF-like 
complex consisting of multiple proteins which are coordinately assembled during 
phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha in response to external signals.
