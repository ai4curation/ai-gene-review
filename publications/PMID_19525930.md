Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness worldwide, 
is as prevalent as cancer in industrialized nations. Most blindness in AMD 
results from invasion of the retina by choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). Here 
we show that the eosinophil/mast cell chemokine receptor CCR3 is specifically 
expressed in choroidal neovascular endothelial cells in humans with AMD, and 
that despite the expression of its ligands eotaxin-1, -2 and -3, neither 
eosinophils nor mast cells are present in human CNV. Genetic or pharmacological 
targeting of CCR3 or eotaxins inhibited injury-induced CNV in mice. CNV 
suppression by CCR3 blockade was due to direct inhibition of endothelial cell 
proliferation, and was uncoupled from inflammation because it occurred in mice 
lacking eosinophils or mast cells, and was independent of macrophage and 
neutrophil recruitment. CCR3 blockade was more effective at reducing CNV than 
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) neutralization, which is in 
clinical use at present, and, unlike VEGF-A blockade, is not toxic to the mouse 
retina. In vivo imaging with CCR3-targeting quantum dots located spontaneous CNV 
invisible to standard fluorescein angiography in mice before retinal invasion. 
CCR3 targeting might reduce vision loss due to AMD through early detection and 
therapeutic angioinhibition.

## Full Text

AMD affects 30-50 million people globally, with approximately 90% of severe vision loss attributed to CNV1. The worldwide prevalence of CNV is expected to double in the next decade due to population aging. Targeting the pro-angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A has been validated in patients with CNV2-4. However, substantial improvement of vision occurs only in one-third of patients treated with VEGF-A antagonists, and one-sixth of treated patients still progress to legal blindness. Moreover, safety concerns with continual blockade of VEGF-A, which is constitutively expressed in the normal adult human retina5, are emerging6,7. Thus, treatment strategies based on more specific targeting of CNV are desirable. However, no molecular marker specific for human CNV has yet been reported.

CCR3 expression restricted to CNV in human eyesIn our studies examining the role of chemokines in angiogenesis, we discovered that CCR3 (also known as CD193), a chemokine receptor best known for its role in promoting eosinophil and mast cell trafficking8, was expressed in human choroidal endothelial cells (CECs) only in the context of CNV due to AMD and not in other non-proliferating or proliferating choroidal vasculature (Fig. 1). Immunolocalization studies showed that CCR3 was expressed in CECs of all examined specimens of surgically excised CNV tissue from patients with AMD (18/18) who had received no prior treatment for AMD (Fig. 1a, b; Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, CCR3 was not expressed in CECs in the choroid of any patients with early (atrophic) AMD (0/10) or in age-matched patients without AMD (0/10) (Fig. 1c, d). CCR3 also was not immunolocalized in surgically excised tissue from patients with epiretinal fibrotic membranes (0/6) or in CECs in patients with choroidal melanoma (0/8) (Fig. 1e, f). Collectively these data point to a highly specific pattern of expression of CCR3 (P = 7×10−14, exact contingency table test) in CECs in neovascular AMD. In addition, we identified the expression of the CCR3 ligands eotaxin-1 (CCL11), -2 (CCL24), and -3 (CCL26) in all examined specimens of surgically excised CNV tissue from patients with AMD who had received no prior treatment for AMD (Fig. 1g-j), suggesting that the eotaxin-CCR3 axis could play a role in this disease state. Interestingly, despite the abundance of eotaxins, eosinophils and mast cells were not identified in human CNV (Supplementary Fig. S2), consistent with earlier findings9.

CCR3 stimulation promotes CEC migration and proliferationThe best elucidated pathological functions of CCR3 to date have been its role in allergic diseases such as asthma10-14 and eosinophilic esophagitis15. There is a single report of its direct role in angiogenesis16. Although eosinophils and mast cells have been reported to be involved in angiogenesis17,18, such actions are considered minor or isolated. Therefore, we studied the effects of CCR3 modulation on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Neutralizing anti-CCR3 antibodies inhibited the tube formation of primary human CECs cultured in Matrigel in vitro (Fig. 2a). In an experimental model of CNV induced by laser injury in wild-type mice19-24, neutralizing anti-CCR3 antibodies reduced the fraction of CECs in vivo that was in the proliferative state of the cell cycle (Fig. 2b). Consistent with this finding, each of the three eotaxins stimulated human CEC proliferation (Fig. 2c). Cytoskeletal rearrangement through polymerization of monomeric actin to microfilamentous F-actin, which is essential for eosinophil chemotaxis induced by the eotaxins, is also critical in angiogenic migration of endothelial cells. Stimulation of human CECs with any of the three eotaxins induced a rapid polymerization of actin molecules (Fig. 2d, e). All three eotaxins also activated Rac-1 (Supplementary Fig. S3), a small GTPase that is critical in regulating endothelial cell spreading and migration, and promoted human CEC migration in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2f). Collectively these data demonstrate that CCR3 activation can promote multiple steps of angiogenesis. The expression of CCR3 on CECs in vivo is confined to CNV tissues; however, in vitro, human CECs responded to CCR3 ligands. This might be due to the presence of several CNV-promoting growth factors in the culture medium.

CCR3 receptor or ligand antagonism inhibits CNVWe studied the in vivo effects of CCR3 targeting in a mouse model of CNV induced by laser injury22 that is the most widely utilized animal model of this disease. A single intraocular administration of either CCR3 neutralizing antibodies or a small molecule CCR3 receptor antagonist ((S)-Methyl-2-naphthoylamino-3-(4-nitrophenyl)propionate) both suppressed laser injury-induced CNV in wild-type mice in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3a-c). CNV was also diminished in Ccr3−/− mice25 compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 3d). The specificity of pharmacological CCR3 blockade was confirmed by demonstrating that CNV was not reduced in Ccr3−/− mice by CCR3 neutralizing antibodies or CCR3 receptor antagonist (116±7% and 109±16% of control, respectively; n = 5; P > 0.1). CCL-11 and CCL-24, the principal mouse ligands for CCR3, were markedly increased soon after laser injury and immunolocalized to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), which is adjacent to CECs (Fig. 3e, f). Also, human RPE cells synthesized all three eotaxins (Supplementary Fig. S4), implicating these cells, which are abundantly interspersed in CNV9, as a source of CCR3 ligands in CNV. Genetic ablation of either Ccl11 (ref. 26) or Ccl24 (ref. 12) reduced CNV, while the neovascular response in Ccl11−/− × Ccl24−/− mice12 was suppressed to a greater extent than in either of the “single knockout” mice, suggesting cooperation between these two ligands in this system (Fig. 3g). A single intraocular administration of neutralizing antibodies against CCL-11 or CCL-24 also suppressed CNV in wild-type mice (Fig. 3h, i), validating these CCR3 ligands as anti-angiogenic targets. Together, these data demonstrate that CCR3 activation is essential for in vivo angiogenesis in the most widely used preclinical model of neovascular AMD.

CCR3-driven angiogenesis uncoupled from inflammationWe sought to determine whether CCR3 targeting reduced CNV solely via anti-angiogenic mechanisms or whether anti-inflammatory mechanisms also were involved. Neither eosinophils nor mast cells (defined as CCR3hiCD3−CD117intCD49d+ and CCR3intCD3−CD117hiCD49d+ cells, respectively) were recruited to the choroid following laser injury, as monitored by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore, the CNV response in eosinophil-deficient Δdbl GATA mice11 and mast cell-deficient KitW-v/KitW-v mice27 was not different from that in wild-type mice (Fig. 3j). In addition, intraocular administration of neutralizing anti-CCR3 antibodies reduced CNV in Δdbl GATA or KitW-v/KitW-v mice to the same extent as in wild-type mice. Thus, although eosinophils and mast cells have been reported to be capable of driving angiogenesis in other systems17,18, both cell types are dispensable in the development of experimental CNV. Although neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are crucial for the development of experimental CNV23,28, CCR3 receptor targeting did not affect recruitment of either inflammatory cell type (defined as Gr-1+F4/80− and F4/80+CD11c− cells, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, the angioinhibitory effect of CCR3 blockade in this model is a direct anti-vascular effect and does not appear to involve modulation of cellular inflammation. The mechanisms underlying the paucity of eosinophils and mast cells in CNV remain to be defined. One potential explanation could be the expression of CXCL9, which blocks eotaxin-induced CCR3-mediated eosinophil recruitment29,30, in CNV (Supplementary Fig. S6). Other mechanisms influencing adhesion or mobilization of these leukocytes also might be operative.

CNV bioimaging by CCR3 targetingBecause invasion of the retina by CNV results in morphological and functional disruption of the retina, early detection of CNV is desirable; indeed, detection of CNV before retinal invasion would be ideal. CNV that has breached the retina can be detected by fluorescein angiography. However, this diagnostic modality cannot detect CNV before it has invaded the retina, i.e., when it is still limited to the choroid. Yet postmortem histopathological studies have shown that substantial numbers of patients in whom fluorescein angiography does not reveal the presence of CNV nevertheless have CNV that has not yet invaded the retina31. Therefore, we explored whether CCR3-targeted bioimaging using anti-CCR3 Fab antibody fragments (Supplementary Fig. S7) conjugated to quantum dots (QDot-CCR3 Fab) could detect CNV before it became clinically evident.We previously described the spontaneous development of CNV in senescent mice deficient in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL-2) or its CCR2 receptor32. Similar pathology occurs at a younger age in Ccl2−/− × Ccr2−/− mice (unpublished data). These mice also undergo outer retinal degeneration rapidly (Supplementary Fig. S8). We tested whether fundus angiography following intravenous injection of QDot-CCR3 Fab could detect subretinal CNV in these mice. QDot-CCR3 Fab angiography demonstrated hyperfluorescent signals in regions of the fundus of these mice that were silent on fluorescein angiography (Fig. 4a,b). The specificity of CCR3 targeting was confirmed by the absence of hyperfluorescent signals in Ccl2−/− × Ccr2−/− mice injected with QDot-isotype Fab and in wild-type mice injected with QDot-CCR3 Fab (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. S9). Histological examination of these areas revealed proliferating (Ki67+) CCR3+ blood vessels in the choroid that had not yet invaded the retina, along with accumulation of QDot-CCR3 Fab in these vessels (Fig. 4c-e). These data provide proof of principle that CCR3-targeted bioimaging can detect subclinical CNV before it disrupts the retina and causes vision loss.

CCR3 targeting superior to VEGF-A targetingIn comparing CCR3 targeting to VEGF-A targeting, the most effective approved treatment for human CNV, we found that CCR3 neutralizing antibodies were more effective than VEGF-A neutralizing antibodies (68±3% vs. 57±4%) at inhibiting laser-induced CNV in mice (Supplementary Fig. S10). In the laser injury model, CCR3 neutralization did not change VEGF-A levels in the RPE/choroid and VEGF-A blockade did not change CCR3 expression on CECs (Supplementary Fig. S11): these two pathways appear to be not directly coupled. Repeated intravitreous administration of anti-VEGF-A antibodies resulted in anatomic and functional damage to the retina in wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. S12), consistent with earlier reports that anti-VEGF-A therapy induces dysfunction in and damage to the inner and outer murine retina6,7. These effects were modest at a dose of anti-VEGF-A antibodies that suppressed mouse CNV but more pronounced at a higher dose that is comparable to the dose used in humans. It should be noted that anti-VEGF-A pharmacotherapy has not been associated with an increased risk of profound retinal damage in humans33, but subtle abnormalities have been observed34,35 and some adverse effects might be misattributed to disease progression. In contrast to VEGF-A blockade, neither CCR3 Ab nor CCR3 receptor antagonist induced retinal toxicity in wild-type mice as confirmed by fundus imaging and electrophysiological function (Supplementary Fig. S12). Vegfa deletion is embryonically lethal36,37 and conditional ablation of Vegfa in the RPE induces profound retinal degeneration and visual dysfunction38. In contrast, the Ccr3−/− mouse retina was normal in appearance and electrophysiological function (Supplementary Fig. S13).

DiscussionOur findings suggest that CCR3 targeting may be a safe and viable strategy for early detection (using biocompatible quantum dots or other bioimaging fluorochromes such as near infrared dyes) and treatment of CNV (by receptor or ligand targeting) that might be superior to current standard of care. CCR3 bioimaging is likely to be most useful in individuals with RPE pigmentary disturbances and multiple subretinal lipoproteinaceous deposits known as drusen or fellow eye involvement with clinically evident CNV, as they are known to be at high risk for developing CNV39,40. Similar techniques might be useful in non-invasively bioimaging other metabolic or molecular markers to provide information about disease pathogenesis or activity.Several strategies have yielded molecular markers that are preferentially expressed on proliferating endothelial cells such as those in tumour vasculature41,42; however, CCR3 has not been identified in any of these reports. Therefore, our studies identify CCR3 as a novel marker of pathological angiogenesis and as a functional target in neovascular AMD. These findings also should prompt a search for genetic polymorphisms in the eotaxin-CCR3 axis in patients with AMD, and investigations of CCR3 function in other models of angiogenesis. Also, it is tempting to speculate that targeting CCR3 might provide dual benefits in asthma, which involves varying degrees of eosinophilic inflammation as well as angiogenic airway remodelling43.

Methods SummaryMouse model of CNVLaser photocoagulation (OcuLight GL, Iridex Corporation) was performed on mouse eyes to induce CNV, and CNV volumes were measured 7 days after injury by scanning laser confocal microscope (TCS SP, Leica) as previously described22.Drug injectionsRat IgG2a neutralizing antibody against mouse CCR3 (R&D Systems), control rat IgG2a (Serotec), goat neutralizing antibody against mouse CCL11 (R&D Systems), goat neutralizing antibody against mouse CCL24 (R&D Systems), control goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), or (S)-Methyl-2-naphthoylamino-3-(4-nitrophenyl)propionate (SB328437; Calbiochem) dissolved in DMSO were injected into the vitreous humor using a 33-gauge double-calibre needle (Ito Corporation) once, immediately after laser injury as previously described22.CCR3 bioimagingF(ab) fragments were created from monoclonal IgG2a antibody raised against the extracellular domain of murine CCR3 (R&D Systems) and an isotype rat IgG2a (R&D Systems) using a commercially available papain-based kit (Pierce). Recovered fragments were conjugated with quantum dots (Invitrogen, QDot-800) and resuspended in sterile PBS. Ccl2−/− × Ccr2−/− mice were administered 100 μg of tagged CCR3 F(ab) or isotype F(ab) via tail vein injection after acquiring baseline fluorescent imaging using a Topcon retinal camera (TRC-50IX). Serial images were then acquired at 1, 4, and 12 h after which eyes were harvested and frozen in OCT for immunofluorescent analyses. Retinal images were analyzed (ImageNet, Topcon) by comparison to baseline and fluorescein angiographic data. Hyperfluorescent areas were then cropped, equally thresholded, and pseudocoloured (Photoshop CS3, Adobe). Sections from QDot-conjugated CCR3 or rat IgG2a isotype F(ab) injected animals were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum/5% goat serum in PBS, stained with rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Biosciences) and either rabbit anti-mouse CCR3 (Santa Cruz) or rabbit anti-Ki67 (Abcam) followed by appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488/594, Invitrogen), and evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica SP-5).

Rat IgG2a neutralizing antibody against mouse CCR3 (R&D Systems), control rat IgG2a (Serotec), goat neutralizing antibody against mouse CCL11 (R&D Systems), goat neutralizing antibody against mouse CCL24 (R&D Systems), control goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), or (S)-Methyl-2-naphthoylamino-3-(4-nitrophenyl)propionate (SB328437; Calbiochem) dissolved in DMSO were injected into the vitreous humor using a 33-gauge double-calibre needle (Ito Corporation) once, immediately after laser injury as previously described22.

CCR3 bioimagingF(ab) fragments were created from monoclonal IgG2a antibody raised against the extracellular domain of murine CCR3 (R&D Systems) and an isotype rat IgG2a (R&D Systems) using a commercially available papain-based kit (Pierce). Recovered fragments were conjugated with quantum dots (Invitrogen, QDot-800) and resuspended in sterile PBS. Ccl2−/− × Ccr2−/− mice were administered 100 μg of tagged CCR3 F(ab) or isotype F(ab) via tail vein injection after acquiring baseline fluorescent imaging using a Topcon retinal camera (TRC-50IX). Serial images were then acquired at 1, 4, and 12 h after which eyes were harvested and frozen in OCT for immunofluorescent analyses. Retinal images were analyzed (ImageNet, Topcon) by comparison to baseline and fluorescein angiographic data. Hyperfluorescent areas were then cropped, equally thresholded, and pseudocoloured (Photoshop CS3, Adobe). Sections from QDot-conjugated CCR3 or rat IgG2a isotype F(ab) injected animals were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum/5% goat serum in PBS, stained with rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Biosciences) and either rabbit anti-mouse CCR3 (Santa Cruz) or rabbit anti-Ki67 (Abcam) followed by appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488/594, Invitrogen), and evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica SP-5).
