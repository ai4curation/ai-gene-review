Photic entrainment of insect circadian rhythms can occur through either 
extraretinal (brain) or retinal photoreceptors, which mediate sensitivity to 
blue light or longer wavelengths, respectively. Although visual transduction 
processes are well understood in the insect retina, almost nothing is known 
about the extraretinal blue light photoreceptor of insects. We now have 
identified and characterized a candidate blue light photoreceptor gene in 
Drosophila (DCry) that is homologous to the cryptochrome (Cry) genes of mammals 
and plants. The DCry gene is located in region 91F of the third chromosome, an 
interval that does not contain other genes required for circadian rhythmicity. 
The protein encoded by DCry is approximately 50% identical to the CRY1 and CRY2 
proteins recently discovered in mammalian species. As expected for an 
extraretinal photoreceptor mediating circadian entrainment, DCry mRNA is 
expressed within the adult brain and can be detected within body tissues. 
Indeed, tissue in situ hybridization demonstrates prominent expression in cells 
of the lateral brain, which are close to or coincident with the Drosophila clock 
neurons. Interestingly, DCry mRNA abundance oscillates in a circadian manner in 
Drosophila head RNA extracts, and the temporal phasing of the rhythm is similar 
to that documented for the mouse Cry1 mRNA, which is expressed in clock tissues. 
Finally, we show that changes in DCry gene dosage are associated predictably 
with alterations of the blue light resetting response for the circadian rhythm 
of adult locomotor activity.
