The salivary scavenger and agglutinin (SALSA), also known as gp340, salivary 
agglutinin and deleted in malignant brain tumor 1, is a 340-kDa glycoprotein 
expressed on mucosal surfaces and secreted into several body fluids. SALSA binds 
to a broad variety of microbes and endogenous ligands, such as complement factor 
C1q, surfactant proteins D and A, and IgA. Our search for novel ligands of SALSA 
by direct protein-interaction studies led to the identification of 
mannan-binding lectin (MBL) as a new binding partner. We observed that 
surface-associated SALSA activates complement via binding of MBL. On the other 
hand, soluble SALSA was found to inhibit Candida albicans-induced complement 
activation. Thus, SALSA has a dual complement activation modifying function. It 
activates the lectin pathway when bound to a surface and inhibits it when free 
in the fluid phase. These activities are mediated via a direct interaction with 
MBL. This suggests that SALSA could target the innate immune responses to 
certain microorganisms and simultaneously limit complement activation in the 
fluid phase.
