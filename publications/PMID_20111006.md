Cytoplasmic protein transport in axons ('slow axonal transport') is essential 
for neuronal homeostasis, and involves Kinesin-1, the same motor for membranous 
organelle transport ('fast axonal transport'). However, both molecular 
mechanisms of slow axonal transport and difference in usage of Kinesin-1 between 
slow and fast axonal transport have been elusive. Here, we show that slow axonal 
transport depends on the interaction between the DnaJ-like domain of the kinesin 
light chain in the Kinesin-1 motor complex and Hsc70, scaffolding between 
cytoplasmic proteins and Kinesin-1. The domain is within the tetratricopeptide 
repeat, which can bind to membranous organelles, and competitive perturbation of 
the domain in squid giant axons disrupted cytoplasmic protein transport and 
reinforced membranous organelle transport, indicating that this domain might 
have a function as a switchover system between slow and fast transport by Hsc70. 
Transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant-negative form of the domain showed 
delayed slow transport, accelerated fast transport and optic axonopathy. These 
findings provide a basis for the regulatory mechanism of intracellular transport 
and its intriguing implication in neuronal dysfunction.
