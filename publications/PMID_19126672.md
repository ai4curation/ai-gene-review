During directed cell migration (chemotaxis), cytoskeletal dynamics are 
stimulated and spatially biased by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and other 
signal transduction pathways. Live-cell imaging using total internal reflection 
fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy revealed that, in the absence of soluble cues, 
3'-phosphoinositides are enriched in a localized and dynamic fashion during 
active spreading and random migration of mouse fibroblasts on adhesive surfaces. 
Surprisingly, we found that PI3K activation is uncoupled from classical 
integrin-mediated pathways and feedback from the actin cytoskeleton. Inhibiting 
PI3K significantly impairs cell motility, both in the context of normal 
spreading and when microtubules are dissociated, which induces a dynamic 
protrusion phenotype as seen by TIRF in our cells. Accordingly, during random 
migration, 3'-phosphoinositides are frequently localized to regions of membrane 
protrusion and correlate quantitatively with the direction and persistence of 
cell movement. These results underscore the importance of localized PI3K 
signaling not only in chemotaxis but also in basal motility/migration of 
fibroblasts.

Introduction

Cell migration is central to wound healing, immune surveillance,
 development and cancer. It is characterized by cyclic protrusion, adhesion and
 contractile processes that are regulated through a complex network of
 intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization pathways that are
 influenced, and in many cases directed, by soluble and adhesion-based factors
 ( Lauffenburger and Horwitz,
 1996 ; Ridley et al.,
 2003 ). During wound healing, fibroblasts residing in the nearby
 tissue sense a gradient of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and exhibit a
 chemotactic response that accelerates their invasion of the fibrin clot, where
 they also encounter dramatic changes in the content of the extracellular
 matrix (ECM) ( Singer and Clark,
 1999 ). An established requirement for PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis
 is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signal transduction pathway
 ( Anand-Apte and Zetter, 1997 ; Rönnstrand and Heldin,
 2001 ), which we have previously characterized in the context of
 its intracellular localization in fibroblasts and sensitivity to PDGF
 gradients of varying magnitude and steepness
 ( Haugh et al., 2000 ; Schneider and Haugh, 2005 ).
 PI3K signaling has been broadly studied in the context of chemotaxis, and the
 finer points of its dynamics and roles in other cells are still emerging
 ( Ferguson et al., 2007 ; Kay et al., 2008 ; Loovers et al., 2006 ; Takeda et al., 2007 ).

Ligated PDGF receptors are among the most potent activators of Type IA
 PI3Ks ( Auger et al., 1989 ; Jackson et al., 1992 ), and
 ECM-bound integrins have also been implicated in PI3K signaling
 ( Chen et al., 1996 ; Khwaja et al., 1997 ; King et al., 1997 ). Upon
 translocation to the plasma membrane, type I PI3Ks phosphorylate
 phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5) P 2 ] to
 generate PtdIns(3,4,5) P 3 and its breakdown product,
 PtdIns(3,4) P 2 ( Hawkins
 et al., 2006 ; Vanhaesebroeck
 et al., 2001 ). These lipid second messengers control a wide range
 of cellular responses, including cell survival and proliferation, in addition
 to their roles in cell migration and chemotaxis
 ( Engelman et al., 2006 ).
 Downstream effectors such as adaptor proteins, protein kinases, guanine
 nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins are localized and
 in some cases activated through phosphoinositide binding, which is generally
 mediated by their pleckstrin-homology domains
 ( Lemmon et al., 2002 ). PI3K
 signaling is thought to affect motility through local recruitment of guanine
 nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho-family GTPases, Rac and Cdc42, which
 drive the formation of protrusive structures through recruitment of WAVE/WASP
 and Arp2/3 ( Burridge and Wennerberg,
 2004 ; Etienne-Manneville and
 Hall, 2002 ; Pollard and
 Borisy, 2003 ), and activation of effector kinases such as Pak, LIM
 kinases, PDK1 and Akt ( del Pozo et al.,
 2000 ; Edwards et al.,
 1999 ; Primo et al.,
 2007 ; Sells et al.,
 1997 ; Sumi et al.,
 1999 ).

Although the role of PI3K in promoting cell motility is appreciated,
 especially during chemotaxis, as is its influence on cell adhesion and random
 cell migration on ECM ( King et al.,
 1997 ; Pankov et al.,
 2005 ; Reiske et al.,
 1999 ), the nature of PI3K signaling triggered by adhesion remains
 largely obscure. Here, we show using total internal reflection fluorescence
 (TIRF) microscopy that PI3K is robustly activated in fibroblasts during their
 initial spreading on adhesive surfaces. Its lipid products are generated
 equally well in the presence or absence of classical integrin-mediated
 signaling, with dynamics that are consistently localized in regions of
 transient membrane protrusion. We further show that membrane protrusion is
 largely PI3K dependent. This is seen most dramatically when microtubules are
 depolymerized using nocodazole, which induces rapid protrusion-retraction
 events as seen by TIRF. In the context of random fibroblast migration,
 formation of branched lamellipodia and turning events were found to coincide
 with localized enrichment of 3′-phosphoinositides.

Discussion

PI3K signaling is important in a variety of chemotactic systems, and its
 localization is polarized in response to chemoattractant gradients. Using TIRF
 microscopy, we have shown here that PI3K is also dynamically activated in
 fibroblasts during adhesion-based motility, both in the context of cell
 spreading and random migration, and our results reinforce that PI3K signaling
 is important for motility in these cells. Many studies suggest that PI3K is
 activated in response to integrin-mediated adhesion to ECM, and so we were
 surprised to find that PI3K is activated quite similarly in cells plated on
 fibronectin and poly-D-lysine, even though the latter does not elicit
 classical integrin-mediated signaling responses. At least two intriguing
 possibilities might explain this result. The first is that both fibronectin
 and poly-D-lysine activate a common receptor that mediates PI3K activation.
 Indeed, we were initially intrigued by the prospect that fibronectin activates
 not only integrins but also syndecans via one of its heparin-binding domains,
 which is rich in the basic amino acids arginine and lysine
 ( Barkalow and Schwarzbauer,
 1991 ; McCarthy et al.,
 1990 ) and that syndecans might be responsible for the activation
 of PI3K. However, treatment of our cells with heparinase I and III, at
 extremely high concentrations (up to 20 U/ml), did not noticeably affect cell
 spreading or PI3K activation on poly-D-lysine or fibronectin (data not shown).
 An alternative possibility that we are currently investigating is that PI3K
 signaling is responsive to mechanical cues, in which case the interplay
 between motile forces and PI3K signaling might constitute a positive-feedback
 loop. Positive-feedback loops have been implicated in spontaneous polarization
 of PI3K signaling and random migration in cells that exhibit amoeboid motility
 (neutrophils and Dictyostelium discoideum ), although in those
 contexts F-actin is required for maintaining PI3K activation
 ( Sasaki et al., 2007 ; Xu et al., 2003 ). In certain
 transformed cells, constitutive membrane localization of PI3K has been
 implicated in spontaneous cell polarization and migration
 ( Wicki and Niggli, 2001 ).

Although basic motility of our cells was more often than not sensitive to
 PI3K inhibition, a significant number of cells exhibited PI3K-independent
 spreading behavior. This is not surprising in light of the growing evidence
 that PI3K is but one of at least a few pathways capable of transducing
 receptor-mediated signals to the cytoskeleton
 ( Chen et al., 2007 ; Kay et al., 2008 ; van Haastert et al., 2007 ; van Rheenen et al., 2007 ). The
 importance of each of those pathways is proving to be context dependent. For
 example, it was reported some years ago that the dependence of PDGF-stimulated
 chemotaxis on PI3K signaling can be overcome if the phospholipase C pathway is
 overly active ( Rönnstrand et al.,
 1999 ). Such redundancy might reflect an ability to affect
 cytoskeletal dynamics in distinct ways, or parallel pathways might converge to
 activate a common downstream effector. Indeed, actin polymerization in
 epithelial cells can be stimulated by both Cdc42 and PI3K signaling, each
 acting through Rac, such that inhibition of either pathway alone is not
 sufficient to fully abolish actin assembly
 ( Bosse et al., 2007 ).

The use of TIRF microscopy afforded us the ability to observe novel contact
 area motility dynamics. Whereas dissociation of actin filaments halted or at
 least retarded cell spreading, effectively decoupling PI3K signaling from
 membrane protrusion, dissociation of microtubules using nocodazole resulted in
 contraction of the contact area and, in half of the cells spreading on
 fibronectin, a dynamic protrusion phenotype that we found to be PI3K
 dependent. The transient protrusion-retraction events sometimes appear to be
 non-random, firing in a radial pattern around the contact area. It would be
 interesting to investigate whether or not these dynamics seen by TIRF are
 related to previous observations that nocodazole induces orbital oscillations
 of the nucleus and of membrane blebs in spreading cells
 ( Cuvelier et al., 2007 ; Pletjushkina et al., 2001 ).
 Microtubules have several roles in cell migration, including the local
 repression of contractility and maturation of focal adhesions near the leading
 edge ( Small and Kaverina,
 2003 ). During migration, contraction forces stimulate adhesion
 maturation and also the dissociation of mature adhesions and retraction at the
 rear of the cell ( Galbraith et al.,
 2002 ; Palecek et al.,
 1998 ). A speculative hypothesis would therefore hold that the
 dynamics we observe reflect the tenuous relationship between contractility,
 presumably enhanced in the absence of microtubules, and the stability of focal
 adhesions. That this behavior is observed on fibronectin and not on
 poly-D-lysine lends some credence to this hypothesis.

Compared with the seemingly chaotic dynamics observed during cell
 attachment and spreading, the pattern of PI3K signaling during random cell
 migration seems to be tightly controlled in spite of its stochastic nature. It
 has been shown previously that polarized fibroblasts often exhibit a
 non-uniform PI3K-activation pattern ( Haugh
 et al., 2000 ), and that protrusive structures in these cells are
 predisposed to higher levels of PI3K signaling in response to PDGF stimulation
 ( Arrieumerlou and Meyer, 2005 ; Schneider et al., 2005 ). Here,
 we characterized the orchestration of PI3K signaling as fibroblasts executed
 persistent migration and turning behavior on adhesive surfaces. Persistent
 migration was accompanied by stable polarization of PI3K signaling at the
 front of the cell, whereas cells exhibiting a more tortuous path typically
 showed localized regions of PI3K signaling that were more transient. The
 distinctions between these two modes of migration warrant further study at the
 molecular level, but in both cases we find that the appearance, persistence,
 and disappearance of localized PI3K activation correlates with the ensuing
 membrane protrusion dynamics. For migration of cells such as fibroblasts,
 inexorably linked to adhesion, both soluble and matrix- or
 substratum-associated inputs must be integrated at the level of signal
 transduction pathways to affect cytoskeletal dynamics, and our results suggest
 that the PI3K pathway is one common medium for doing so.
