A paired homeodomain transcription factor, PAX6, is a well-known regulator of 
eye development, and its heterozygous mutations in humans cause congenital eye 
anomalies such as aniridia. Because it was recently shown that PAX6 also plays 
an indispensable role in islet cell development, a PAX6 gene mutation in humans 
may lead to a defect of the endocrine pancreas. Whereas heterozygous mutations 
in islet-cell transcription factors such as IPF1/IDX-1/STF-1/PDX-1 and 
NEUROD1/BETA2 serve as a genetic cause of diabetes or glucose intolerance, we 
investigated the possibility of PAX6 gene mutations being a genetic factor 
common to aniridia and diabetes. In five aniridia and one Peters' anomaly 
patients, all of the coding exons and their flanking exon-intron junctions of 
the PAX6 gene were surveyed for mutations. The results of direct DNA sequencing 
revealed three different mutations in four aniridia patients: one previously 
reported type of mutation and two unreported types. In agreement with 
polypeptide truncation and a lack of the carboxyl-terminal transactivation 
domain in all of the mutated PAX6 proteins, no transcriptional activity was 
found in the reporter gene analyses. Oral glucose tolerance tests revealed that 
all of the patients with a PAX6 gene mutation had glucose intolerance 
characterized by impaired insulin secretion. Although we did not detect a 
mutation within the characterized portion of the PAX6 gene in one of the five 
aniridia patients, diabetes was cosegregated with aniridia in her family, and a 
single nucleotide polymorphism in intron 9 of the PAX6 gene was correlated with 
the disorders, suggesting that a mutation, possibly located in an 
uncharacterized portion of the PAX6 gene, can explain both diabetes and aniridia 
in this family. In contrast, the patient with Peters' anomaly, for which a PAX6 
gene mutation is a relatively rare cause, showed normal glucose tolerance (NGT) 
and did not show a Pax6 gene mutation. Taken together, our present observations 
suggest that heterozygous mutations in the PAX6 gene can induce eye anomaly and 
glucose intolerance in individuals harboring these mutations.
