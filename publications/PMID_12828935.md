Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy that is associated with elevated intraocular 
pressure in most patients. We have previously demonstrated that the mechanism by 
which pressure damages optic nerve axons involves excessive nitric oxide 
generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2). We have now found that 
activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induces NOS-2 in 
astrocytes of the human optic nerve head (ONH) in vitro and EGFR is 
significantly upregulated and tyrosine phosphorylated in reactive astrocytes in 
human glaucomatous ONHs in vivo. Furthermore, in response to elevated 
hydrostatic pressure, EGFR rapidly becomes phosphorylated in the nucleus. This 
pressure-dependent activation of EGFR is necessary for NOS-2 induction. Our 
results suggest that activation and nuclear localization of EGFR may be needed 
for induction of NOS-2 in response to elevated intraocular pressure in 
glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Identification of this key signaling pathway 
provides new therapeutic approaches to pharmacological neuroprotection for 
glaucoma.
