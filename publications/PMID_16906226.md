Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; also known as von Recklinghausen's disease) is a 
common autosomal-dominant condition primarily affecting neural crest-derived 
tissues. The disease gene, NF1, encodes neurofibromin, a protein of over 2,800 
amino acids that contains a 216-amino acid domain with Ras-GTPase-activating 
protein (Ras-GAP) activity. Potential therapies for NF1 currently in development 
and being tested in clinical trials are designed to modify NF1 Ras-GAP activity 
or target downstream effectors of Ras signaling. Mice lacking the murine homolog 
(Nf1) have mid-gestation lethal cardiovascular defects due to a requirement for 
neurofibromin in embryonic endothelium. We sought to determine whether the GAP 
activity of neurofibromin is sufficient to rescue complete loss of function or 
whether other as yet unidentified functions of neurofibromin might also exist. 
Using cre-inducible ubiquitous and tissue-specific expression, we demonstrate 
that the isolated GAP-related domain (GRD) rescued cardiovascular development in 
Nf1(-/-) embryos, but overgrowth of neural crest-derived tissues persisted, 
leading to perinatal lethality. These results suggest that neurofibromin may 
possess activities outside of the GRD that modulate neural crest homeostasis and 
that therapeutic approaches solely aimed at targeting Ras activity may not be 
sufficient to treat tumors of neural crest origin in NF1.
