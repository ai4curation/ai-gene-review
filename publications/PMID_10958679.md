Pretreatment with mild heat shock is known to protect cells from severe stress 
(acquired thermotolerance). Here we addressed the mechanism of this phenomenon 
by using primary human fibroblasts. Severe heat shock (45 degrees C, 75 min) of 
the fibroblasts caused cell death displaying morphological characteristics of 
apoptosis; however, it was caspase independent. This cell death process was 
accompanied by strong activation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 
(ERK1) and ERK2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal (JNK) kinases. Suppression of Akt or 
ERK1 and -2 kinases increased cell thermosensitivity. In contrast, suppression 
of stress kinase JNK rendered cells thermoresistant. Development of 
thermotolerance was not associated with Akt or ERK1 and -2 regulation, and 
inhibition of these kinases did not reduce acquired thermotolerance. On the 
other hand, acquired tolerance to severe heat shock was associated with 
downregulation of JNK. Using an antisense-RNA approach, we found that 
accumulation of the heat shock protein Hsp72 is necessary for JNK downregulation 
and is critical for thermotolerance. The capability of naive cells to withstand 
moderate heat treatment also appears to be dependent on the accumulation of 
Hsp72 induced by this stress. Indeed, exposure to 45 degrees C for 45 min caused 
only transient JNK activation and was nonlethal, while prevention of Hsp72 
accumulation prolonged JNK activation and led to massive cell death. We also 
found that JNK activation by UV irradiation, interleukin-1, or tumor necrosis 
factor was suppressed in thermotolerant cells and that Hsp72 accumulation was 
responsible for this effect. Hsp72-mediated suppression of JNK is therefore 
critical for acquired thermotolerance and may play a role in tolerance to other 
stresses.

Abstract

Pretreatment with mild heat shock is known to protect cells from severe stress (acquired thermotolerance). Here we addressed the mechanism of this phenomenon by using primary human fibroblasts. Severe heat shock (45°C, 75 min) of the fibroblasts caused cell death displaying morphological characteristics of apoptosis; however, it was caspase independent. This cell death process was accompanied by strong activation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal (JNK) kinases. Suppression of Akt or ERK1 and -2 kinases increased cell thermosensitivity. In contrast, suppression of stress kinase JNK rendered cells thermoresistant. Development of thermotolerance was not associated with Akt or ERK1 and -2 regulation, and inhibition of these kinases did not reduce acquired thermotolerance. On the other hand, acquired tolerance to severe heat shock was associated with downregulation of JNK. Using an antisense-RNA approach, we found that accumulation of the heat shock protein Hsp72 is necessary for JNK downregulation and is critical for thermotolerance. The capability of naive cells to withstand moderate heat treatment also appears to be dependent on the accumulation of Hsp72 induced by this stress. Indeed, exposure to 45°C for 45 min caused only transient JNK activation and was nonlethal, while prevention of Hsp72 accumulation prolonged JNK activation and led to massive cell death. We also found that JNK activation by UV irradiation, interleukin-1, or tumor necrosis factor was suppressed in thermotolerant cells and that Hsp72 accumulation was responsible for this effect. Hsp72-mediated suppression of JNK is therefore critical for acquired thermotolerance and may play a role in tolerance to other stresses.

DISCUSSION

Priming of cells with mild heat shock leads to thermotolerance ( 3 , 10 , 23 , 32 , 43 ); however, the role of Hsp72 in this process has not been addressed specifically. Indeed, mild heat shock can induce a variety of Hsps besides Hsp72 (e.g., Hsp40, Hsp27, and Hsp90) through heat shock factor activation, as well as some proteins whose expression depends on activation of transcriptional factors, such as AP-1 ( 6 ; see also reference 17 for review). In addition, heat pretreatment activates a number of posttranscriptional events (e.g., heat-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation [ 21 ]) which may contribute to heat tolerance. Therefore, to evaluate the role of Hsp72 in thermotolerance, it is necessary to specifically inhibit Hsp72 accumulation without affecting the expression of other proteins.

Inspired by previous publications, we first approached this goal by using 15- to 24-mer synthetic Hsp72 antisense oligonucleotides, including oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′ translated region of Hsp72. However, the effects of these oligonucleotides were quite nonspecific (i.e., similar to that of sense or random-sequence oligonucleotides) (unpublished data). Therefore, in this study we applied a novel approach: expression of the full antisense Hsp72 RNA by a recombinant adenovirus under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter. We found that this treatment was very effective and specific. Indeed, expression of Hsp72 antisense RNA markedly (by about 75%) reduced heat-induced accumulation of Hsp72 without any effect on the closely related Hsc73 or on Hsp40 (Fig. 1 A). Thus, an adenovirus expressing Hsp72 antisense RNA appears to be a very helpful tool for elucidating the role of this protein in various heat-inducible processes. Using this approach, we demonstrated that Hsp72 accumulation is crucial for acquired thermotolerance (Fig. 1 C). In other words, the whole scope of other events triggered by mild heat shock was insufficient to significantly protect cells. As a model for these experiments, we used an IMR90 primary human fibroblast culture at early passages (10 to 20), since it is more physiologically relevant than stable cultures of immortalized cells. In later passages of fibroblasts (30 to 40), antisense-RNA-expressing adenovirus was also effective but to a lesser extent (unpublished data).

An unexpected finding of this work is that heat shock induces an unusual caspase-independent type of cell death in the primary fibroblasts which is distinct from classical apoptosis. On the other hand, this death is a regulated process, since it requires activation of JNK and can be suppressed by the ERKs and Akt kinases (Fig. 3 and 4 ). Therefore, it appears to be a programmed cell death, which may be similar to a caspase-independent apoptosis (see reference 2 for review), and morphologically this kind of death is very different from necrosis (Fig. 2 F). Accordingly, Hsp72 appears to regulate various types of cell death that are activated by JNK.

Another problem addressed in this study is the mechanism of acquired thermotolerance. Earlier works suggested that this mechanism may be based on the Hsp72-mediated suppression of stress kinase JNK ( 8 , 30 , 43 ). In the present study we obtained evidence in favor of this mechanism. This evidence is based on the following observations. (i) The time course of acquisition of thermotolerance correlated with that of Hsp72 accumulation and JNK suppression (Fig. 6 ). (ii) Prevention of heat-induced Hsp72 accumulation eliminated the suppression of JNK activity and development of thermotolerance (Fig. 1 and 7 ). (iii) Suppression of heat-induced JNK activity by expression of dnSEK1, an upstream component of the JNK signaling pathway, markedly reduced heat-induced cell death (Fig. 4 ). Therefore, Hsp72-mediated suppression of JNK appears to be an important component of acquired thermotolerance (Fig. 11 ). On the other hand, pretreatment of cells with mild heat shock did not upregulate either ERKs or Akt in response to the challenging heat shock. Therefore, the development of thermotolerance is unrelated to upregulation of these kinases.

It should be noted that acquired thermotolerance may partly depend on heat-induced (activated) factors besides Hsp72. Indeed, in fibroblasts a slight decline in both JNK activation and death in response to a challenging heat shock was observed at 2 h after the preheating, when no increase in the Hsp72 level could be detected yet (Fig. 6 A and B). Therefore, this initial (though rather minor) JNK suppression and thermotolerance acquisition are independent of Hsp72 accumulation. Interestingly, this Hsp72-independent protection in fibroblasts appears to be also associated with JNK suppression (Fig. 6 A and B). This protection may be related to rapid induction of a JNK phosphatase (e.g., mitogen-kinase phosphatase 1) whose expression is also activated by heat shock ( 18 , 19 ), or it could also be independent of the synthesis of novel proteins ( 21 ). On the other hand, it is clear that the major and limiting factor in JNK regulation is Hsp72, since its overexpression is sufficient to suppress JNK, while specific inhibition of Hsp72 induction prevents JNK suppression (Fig. 11 ).

In addition to Hsp72, other heat-induced proteins may also participate in suppression of JNK. Indeed, to block JNK activation by expression of Hsp72 alone, much higher levels of Hsp72 are needed than that induced by mild heat shock (Fig. 8 ) ( 8 , 43 ). One of the heat-induced proteins implicated in JNK suppression in cooperation with Hsp72 may be Hsp40, a well-known cochaperone which increases the binding of Hsp72 to substrates ( 11 , 29 ). Other Hsp72 cofactors, like BAG-1 or Hip, as well as Hsp90, may also play a role in this regulation. In fact, BAG-1 was reported to function in suppression of apoptosis ( 37 ). It is possible that its prosurvival activity is mediated by the interaction of BAG-1 with Hsp72 and consequently with JNK.

A rather unexpected observation made in this study is that the intrinsic resistance of cells to moderate heat shock is dependent on the accumulation of Hsp72. Indeed, exposure of fibroblasts to 45°C for 45 min, which was not toxic in control cells, evoked a massive death of cells expressing Hsp72 antisense RNA (Fig. 9 A). This phenomenon is probably related to the previous observation that heat-induced apoptosis requires prolonged JNK activation, while transient although strong JNK activation is insufficient to induce cell death ( 41 ). Accordingly, in control fibroblasts which were able to accumulate Hsp72, JNK activity after heat shock returned to the basal level within 6 h. In contrast, in the cells where Hsp72 accumulation was blocked, JNK activity remained elevated for a much longer time period (Fig. 9 C). Therefore, accumulated Hsp72 may participate in the decline of JNK activity after heat stress, thus preventing induction of cell death.

Apparently, there is a fine balance in a cell between Hsp72 synthesis and the triggering of death after heat shock (Fig. 11 ). It appears that during the first hours after heat shock, cells try to synthesize Hsp72 in order to repair damaged molecules and survive. If they fail to synthesize enough Hsp72 during this initial period (e.g., in the presence of Hsp72 antisense virus), the death program prevails. Interference with the death program during this time (e.g., by suppression of JNK via dnSEK1-expressing adenovirus) leads to cell survival, although the cells' reparation capability is likely to remain unchanged (Fig. 11 ).

It is known that both pretreatment with mild heat shock and expression of recombinant Hsp72 can protect cells from apoptosis caused by a variety of stresses, including UV irradiation ( 36 ) and TNF ( 3 , 13 , 14 ). On the other hand, JNK was shown to be essential for initiation of apoptosis by these stimuli, at least in certain cell lines ( 4 , 38 , 40 , 46 ). Therefore, we have previously proposed that mild heat shock or expression of Hsp72 suppresses activation of JNK by these agents, thus preventing apoptosis ( 9 ). In this work we tested an important prediction of this proposal and found that heat shock pretreatment did suppress JNK activation by such diverse stresses as UV irradiation and TNF and that accumulation of Hsp72 is necessary for this regulation (Fig. 10 ). These data suggest that Hsp72-mediated JNK suppression may play an important role not only in acquired thermotolerance but also in tolerance of various other stressful stimuli.
