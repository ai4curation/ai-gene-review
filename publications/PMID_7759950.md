The recently cloned ligand binding component of the type I human 
interferon-alpha/beta receptor (IFN-alpha/beta R) and its soluble analogue (p40) 
were characterized. p40 is a potent inhibitor of type I IFNs and antibodies 
directed against p40 completely block the activity of type I IFNs in human 
cells. These antibodies immunoprecipitate cellular 102-kDa (major) and 51-kDa 
(minor) forms of IFN-alpha/beta R. We find that the 51-kDa IFN-alpha/beta R. Two 
types of cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced, a 1.5-kb cDNA coding for the 
transmembrane 51-kDa IFN-alpha/beta R and a 4.5-kb cDNA coding for p40. In 
addition to ligand binding, IFN-alpha/beta R is directly involved in signaling, 
because it becomes phosphorylated at Tyr residues on ligand binding and it is 
physically associated with the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase JAK1.
