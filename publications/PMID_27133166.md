Organisms respond to mitochondrial stress through the upregulation of an array 
of protective genes, often perpetuating an early response to metabolic 
dysfunction across a lifetime. We find that mitochondrial stress causes 
widespread changes in chromatin structure through histone H3K9 di-methylation 
marks traditionally associated with gene silencing. Mitochondrial stress 
response activation requires the di-methylation of histone H3K9 through the 
activity of the histone methyltransferase met-2 and the nuclear co-factor 
lin-65. While globally the chromatin becomes silenced by these marks, remaining 
portions of the chromatin open up, at which point the binding of canonical 
stress responsive factors such as DVE-1 occurs. Thus, a metabolic stress 
response is established and propagated into adulthood of animals through 
specific epigenetic modifications that allow for selective gene expression and 
lifespan extension.
