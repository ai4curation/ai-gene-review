The human E48 antigen, highly homologous to the murine Ly-6 antigen ThB, is a 
GPI-anchored molecule apparently involved in keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion.

The E48 antigen, a putative human homologue of the 20-kD protein present in 
desmosomal preparations of bovine muzzle, and formerly called desmoglein III 
(dg4), is a promising target antigen for antibody-based therapy of squamous cell 
carcinoma in man. To anticipate the effect of high antibody dose treatment, and 
to evaluate the possible biological involvement of the antigen in 
carcinogenesis, we set out to molecularly characterize the antigen. A cDNA clone 
encoding the E48 antigen was isolated by expression cloning in COS cells. 
Sequence analysis revealed that the clone contained an open reading frame of 128 
amino acids, encoding a core protein of 13,286 kD. Database searching showed 
that the E48 antigen has a high level of sequence similarity with the mouse ThB 
antigen, a member of the Ly-6 antigen family. Phosphatidylinositol-specific 
(PI-specific) phospholipase-C treatment indicated that the E48 antigen is 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI-anchored) to the plasma membrane. The 
gene encoding the E48 antigen is a single copy gene, located on human chromosome 
8 in the 8q24-qter region. The expression of the gene is confined to 
keratinocytes and squamous tumor cells. The putative mouse homologue, the ThB 
antigen, originally identified as an antigen on cells of the lymphocyte lineage, 
was shown to be highly expressed in squamous mouse epithelia. Moreover, the ThB 
expression level is in keratinocytes, in contrast to that in lymphocytes, not 
mouse strain related. Transfection of mouse SV40-polyoma transformed mouse 
NIH/3T3 cells with the E48 cDNA confirmed that the antigen is likely to be 
involved in cell-cell adhesion.
