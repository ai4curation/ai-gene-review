SlyD (sensitive to lysis D) is a putative folding helper from the bacterial 
cytosol and harbors prolyl isomerase and chaperone activities. We determined the 
solution NMR structure of a truncated version of SlyD (1-165) from Escherichia 
coli (SlyD*) that lacks the presumably unstructured C-terminal tail. SlyD* 
consists of two well-separated domains: the FKBP domain, which harbors the 
prolyl isomerase activity, and the insert-in-flap (IF) domain, which harbors the 
chaperone activity. The IF domain is inserted into a loop of the FKBP domain 
near the prolyl isomerase active site. The NMR structure of SlyD* showed no 
distinct orientation of the two domains relative to each other. In the FKBP 
domain, Tyr68 points into the active site, which might explain the lowered 
intrinsic prolyl isomerase activity and the much lower FK506 binding affinity of 
the protein compared with archetype human FKBP12 (human FK506 binding protein 
with 12 kDa). The thermodynamics and kinetics of substrate binding by SlyD* were 
quantified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. NMR titration experiments 
revealed that the IF domain recognizes and binds unfolded or partially folded 
proteins and peptides. Insulin aggregation is markedly slowed by SlyD* as 
evidenced by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy in real time, probably due to 
SlyD* binding to denatured insulin. The capacity of the IF domain to establish 
an initial encounter-collision complex, together with the flexible orientation 
of the two interacting domains, makes SlyD* a very powerful catalyst of protein 
folding.
