BRCA1-associated RING domain protein BARD1, along with its heterodimeric partner 
BRCA1, plays important roles in cellular response to DNA damage. Immediate 
cellular response to genotoxic stress is mediated by a family of 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinases, such as ataxia-telangiectasia 
mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad3-related, and DNA-dependent protein kinase. 
ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 enhances the DNA damage checkpoint 
functions of BRCA1, but how BARD1 is regulated during DNA damage signaling has 
not been examined. Here, we report that BARD1 undergoes phosphorylation upon 
ionizing radiation or UV radiation and identify Thr(714) as the in vivo BARD1 
phosphorylation site. Importantly, DNA damage functions of BARD1 (i.e., 
inhibition of pre-mRNA polyadenylation and degradation of RNA polymerase II) are 
abrogated in T714A and T734A mutants. Our findings suggest that phosphorylation 
of BARD1 is critical for the DNA damage functions of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex.
