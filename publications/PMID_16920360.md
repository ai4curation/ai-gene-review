Translation initiation in eukaryotes depends on many eukaryotic initiation 
factors (eIFs) that stimulate both recruitment of the initiator tRNA, 
Met-tRNA(i)(Met), and mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit and subsequent scanning 
of the mRNA for the AUG start codon. The largest of these initiation factors, 
the eIF3 complex, organizes a web of interactions among several eIFs that 
assemble on the 40S subunit and participate in the different reactions involved 
in translation. Structural analysis suggests that eIF3 performs this scaffolding 
function by binding to the 40S subunit on its solvent-exposed surface rather 
than on its interface with the 60S subunit, where the decoding sites exist. This 
location of eIF3 seems ideally suited for its other proposed regulatory 
functions, including reinitiating translation on polycistronic mRNAs and acting 
as a receptor for protein kinases that control protein synthesis.
