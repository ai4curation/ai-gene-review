Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) possesses a C-terminal domain that interacts 
with GTP-bound Ras, and an N-terminal region containing two SH2 domains and an 
SH3 domain. In addition to its association with Ras, GAP binds stably to 
autophosphorylated beta PDGF receptors, and to two cytoplasmic phosphoproteins: 
p62, an RNA binding protein, and p190, which possesses GAP activity towards 
small guanine nucleotide binding proteins in the Rho/Rac family. To define the 
region of GAP that mediates these interactions with cellular phosphoproteins, 
and to investigate the biological significance of these complexes, a truncated 
GAP polypeptide (GAP-N) containing residues 1-445 was stably expressed in Rat-2 
fibroblasts. GAP-N contains the SH2 and SH3 domains, but lacks the Ras GTPase 
activating domain. Stimulation of cells expressing GAP-N with PDGF induced 
association of GAP-N with the beta PDGF receptor, and phosphorylation of GAP-N 
on tyrosine, consistent with the notion that GAP SH2 domains direct binding to 
the autophosphorylated beta PDGF receptor in vivo. GAP-N bound constitutively to 
p190 in both serum-deprived and growth factor-stimulated cells. This GAP-N-p190 
complex had Rho GAP activity in vitro. The expression of GAP-N in Rat-2 cells 
correlated with changes in the cytoskeleton and in cell adhesion, typified by 
the disruption of action stress fibres, a reduction in focal contacts, and an 
impaired ability to adhere to fibronectin. These results suggest that the 
N-terminal domain of GAP can direct interactions with cellular phosphoproteins 
in vivo, and thereby exert an effector function which modulates the cytoskeleton 
and cell adhesion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) possesses a C-terminal domain that interacts with GTP-bound Ras, and an N-terminal region containing two SH2 domains and an SH3 domain. In addition to its association with Ras, GAP binds stably to autophosphorylated beta PDGF receptors, and to two cytoplasmic phosphoproteins: p62, an RNA binding protein, and p190, which possesses GAP activity towards small guanine nucleotide binding proteins in the Rho/Rac family. To define the region of GAP that mediates these interactions with cellular phosphoproteins, and to investigate the biological significance of these complexes, a truncated GAP polypeptide (GAP-N) containing residues 1-445 was stably expressed in Rat-2 fibroblasts. GAP-N contains the SH2 and SH3 domains, but lacks the Ras GTPase activating domain. Stimulation of cells expressing GAP-N with PDGF induced association of GAP-N with the beta PDGF receptor, and phosphorylation of GAP-N on tyrosine, consistent with the notion that GAP SH2 domains direct binding to the autophosphorylated beta PDGF receptor in vivo.
