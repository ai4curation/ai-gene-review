Primary structure of human transferrin receptor deduced from the mRNA sequence.

Schneider C, Owen MJ, Banville D, Williams JG.

In vertebrates all iron is taken up via the carrier protein transferrin. The 
carrier first binds its receptor and the receptor-ligand complex is then 
internalized via coated pits. The transferrin receptor is a transmembrane 
glycoprotein (apparent molecular weight (MW) 180,000) composed of two 
disulphide-bonded sub-units (each of apparent MW 90,000) It contains three 
N-linked glycan units and is post-translationally modified with both phosphate 
and fatty acyl groups. Here we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the 
coding region of the human transferrin receptor mRNA and from this deduced the 
amino acid sequence of the protein. The receptor does not contain an N-terminal 
signal peptide but there is a membrane-spanning segment 62 amino acids from the 
N-terminus. It therefore has a somewhat unusual configuration with a small 
N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a C-terminal extracellular domain of 672 amino 
acids.
