STAT2 is a positive modulator of the transcriptional response to type I 
interferons (IFNs). STAT2 acquires transcriptional function by becoming tyrosine 
phosphorylated and imported to the nucleus following type I IFN receptor 
activation. Although most STAT proteins become dually phosphorylated on specific 
tyrosine and serine residues to acquire full transcriptional activity, no serine 
phosphorylation site in STAT2 has been reported. To find novel phosphorylation 
sites, mass spectrometry of immunoprecipitated STAT2 was used to identify 
several phosphorylated residues. Of these, substitution of serine 287 with 
alanine (S287A) generated a gain-of-function mutant that enhanced the biological 
effects of IFN-α. S287A-STAT2 increased cell growth inhibition, prolonged 
protection against vesicular stomatitis virus infection and enhanced 
transcriptional responses following exposure of cells to IFN-α. In contrast, a 
phosphomimetic STAT2 mutant (S287D) produced a loss-of-function protein that 
weakly activated IFN-induced ISGs. Our mechanistic studies suggest that 
S287A-STAT2 likely mediates its gain-of-function effects by prolonging 
STAT2/STAT1 dimer activation and retaining it in transcriptionally active 
complexes with chromatin. Altogether, we have uncovered that in response to type 
I IFN, STAT2 is serine phosphorylated in the coiled-coil domain that when 
phosphorylated can negatively regulate the biological activities of type I IFNs.

## Full Text

Background: STAT2 is a key transcription factor that mediates the protective role of type I interferons in host defense.

Results: Type I interferons induce the phosphorylation of STAT2 at serine 287.

Conclusion: Serine 287-STAT2 is a regulatory site involved in modulating the transcriptional and cellular responses to type I interferons.

Significance: Deregulated STAT2 signaling may contribute to heightened type I interferon responses and susceptibility to many diseases.
