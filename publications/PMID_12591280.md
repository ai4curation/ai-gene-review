OBJECTIVE: We studied two adult brothers with severe congenital thrombocytopenia 
in order to determine the genetic etiology of their inherited disorder. Despite 
the absence of eczema or immunodeficiency, a mutation of the Wiskott-Aldrich 
syndrome (WAS) gene was suspected because of the presence of microthrombocytes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained for characterization of 
hematopoietic cells and megakaryocyte progenitors. The coding region of the WAS 
gene was fully sequenced, and expression of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome 
protein, WASP, was evaluated by immunoblotting. The ability of WASP to 
physically associate with the WASP-interacting protein, WIP, was tested by yeast 
and mammalian two-hybrid techniques.
RESULTS: In addition to thrombocytopenia, our investigation revealed an 
increased frequency of peripheral megakaryocyte progenitors (CFU-Mk) and 
incomplete cytoplasmic maturation by electron microscopy. Sequencing the WAS 
gene revealed a single base mutation, resulting in substitution of proline for 
arginine 138 (i.e., Arg138Pro). Immunoblotting demonstrated reduced expression 
of the mutant WAS protein, and we showed that the Arg138Pro mutation 
significantly, but incompletely, disrupts WASP-WIP interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pedigree, X-linked thrombocytopenia is caused by a rare 
mutation in the fourth exon of the WAS gene. WASP levels are reduced in 
lymphocyte cell lines derived from the affected individuals. Furthermore, the 
mutation significantly but incompletely disrupts WASP-WIP interaction, whereas 
substitution of alanine or glutamic acid residues at the same position does not. 
This raises the possibility that protein-protein interaction and WASP stability 
are related properties.
