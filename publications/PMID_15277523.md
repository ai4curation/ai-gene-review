In an analogous manner to protein ubiquitination, The C terminus of Atg8p, a 
yeast protein essential for autophagy, conjugates to a head group of 
phosphatidylethanolamine via an amide bond. Though physiological role of this 
reaction is assigned to membrane organization during autophagy, its molecular 
details are still unknown. Here, we show that Escherichia coli cells coexpressed 
Atg8p, Atg7p (E1), and Atg3p (E2) allowed to form conjugate of Atg8p with 
endogenous PE. Further, we established an in vitro Atg8p-PE reconstitution 
system using purified Atg8pG116, Atg7p, Atg3p, and PE-containing liposomes, 
demonstrating that the Atg7p and the Atg3p are minimal catalysts for Atg8p-PE 
conjugate reaction. Efficiency of this lipidation reaction depends on the state 
of the substrate, PE (phospholipid bilayer and its lipid composition). It is 
also suggested that the lipidation induces a conformational change in the 
N-terminal region of Atg8p. In vitro system developed here will provide a 
powerful system for further understanding the precise role of lipidation and 
interaction of two ubiquitin-like systems essential for autophagy.
