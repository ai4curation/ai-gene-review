Human Topoisomerase II is present in two isoforms, 170KDa alpha and 180KDa beta. 
Both the isoforms play a crucial role in maintenance of topological changes 
during DNA replication and recombination. It has been shown that Topoisomerase 
II activity is required for HIV-1 replication and the enzyme is phosphorylated 
during early time points of HIV-1 replication. In the present study, we have 
studied the molecular action of Topoisomerase II inhibitors, azalactone 
ferrocene (AzaFecp), Thiomorpholide amido methyl ferrocene (ThioFecp), and 
Ruthenium benzene amino pyridine (Ru(ben)Apy) on cell proliferation and also on 
various events of HIV-1 replication cycle. The Topoisomerase II beta 
over-expressing neuroblastoma cell line shows a higher sensitivity to these 
compounds compared to the Sup-T1 cell line. All the three Topoisomerase II 
inhibitors show significant anti-HIV activity at nanomolar concentrations 
against an Indian isolate of HIV-1(93IN101) in Sup-T1 cell line. An analysis of 
action of these compounds on proviral DNA synthesis at 5h of post-infection 
shows that they inhibit proviral DNA synthesis as well as the formation of 
pre-integration complexes completely. Further analysis, using polymerase chain 
reaction and western blot, showed that both the Topoisomerase II alpha and beta 
isoforms are present in the pre-integration complexes, suggesting their 
significant role in HIV-1 replication.
