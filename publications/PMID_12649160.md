Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by 
progressive bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. Eight FA 
complementation groups have been identified. The FANCA, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, and 
FANCG proteins form a nuclear complex required for the monoubiquination of the 
FANCD2 protein. To investigate the architecture of the FA protein complex, the 
yeast 2-hybrid system was used to map contact points of the FANCA/FANCG, 
FANCC/FANCE, and FANCF/FANCG interactions. FANCG was shown to interact with both 
the amino-terminus of FANCA and the carboxyl-terminal region of FANCF. A FANCG 
mutant truncated at the carboxyl-terminus retained the ability to interact with 
FANCA. The interaction between FANCG and FANCF was ablated by a Leu71Pro mutant 
of FANCG. A central region of FANCE was sufficient for FANCC binding. A 
Leu554Pro mutant of FANCC failed to interact with FANCE. To further examine 
complex assembly, the yeast 3-hybrid system was used to investigate the ability 
of FANCG to act as a molecular bridge in mediating interaction between other FA 
proteins. FANCG was able to mediate interaction between FANCA and FANCF, as well 
as between monomers of FANCA. Direct interaction between FANCE and FANCD2 was 
also demonstrated in the yeast 2-hybrid system. This interaction involving an 
amino-terminal region of FANCD2 may provide a link between the FA protein 
complex and its downstream targets.
