The dopamine D2 receptor (D2) system has been implicated in several neurological 
and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. There 
are two isoforms of the D2 receptor: the long form (D2L) and the short form 
(D2S). The two isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of the same gene 
and differ only by 29 amino acids in their protein structures. Little is known 
about the distinct functions of either D2 isoform, primarily because selective 
pharmacological agents are not available. We generated D2L receptor-deficient 
(D2L-/-) mice by making a subtle mutation in the D2 gene. D2L-/- mice (which 
still express functional D2S) displayed reduced levels of locomotion and rearing 
behavior. Interestingly, haloperidol produced significantly less catalepsy and 
inhibition of locomotor activity in D2L-/- mice. These findings suggest that D2L 
and D2S may contribute differentially to the regulation of certain motor 
functions and to the induction of the extrapyramidal side effects associated 
with the use of typical antipsychotic drugs (e.g., haloperidol). Quinpirole 
induced a similar initial suppression of locomotor activity in both D2L-/- and 
wild-type mice. In addition, the D2S receptor in the mutant mice functioned 
approximately equally well as did D2L as an impulse-modulating autoreceptor. 
This suggests that the functions of these two isoforms are not dependent on the 
formation of receptor heterodimers. Our findings may provide novel information 
for potentially developing improved antipsychotic drugs.
