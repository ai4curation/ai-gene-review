The surface receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator (uPAR) has been 
recognized in recent years as a key molecule in regulating plasminogen mediated 
extracellular proteolysis. Surface plasminogen activation controls the 
connections between cells, basement membrane and extracellular matrix, and 
therefore the capacity of cells to migrate and invade neighboring tissues. We 
have isolated a 1.4 kb cDNA clone coding for the entire human uPAR. An 
oligonucleotide synthesized on the basis of the N-terminal sequence of the 
purified protein was used to screen a cDNA library made from SV40 transformed 
human fibroblasts [Okayama and Berg (1983) Mol. Cell Biol., 3, 280-289]. The 
cDNA encodes a protein of 313 amino acids, preceded by a 21 residue signal 
peptide. A hydrophobicity plot suggests the presence of a membrane spanning 
domain close to the C-terminus. The cDNA hybridizes to a 1.4 kb mRNA from human 
cells, a size very close to that of the cloned cDNA. Expression of the uPAR cDNA 
in mouse cells confirms that the clone is complete and expresses a functional 
uPA binding protein, located on the cell surface and with properties similar to 
the human uPAR. Caseinolytic plaque assay, immunofluorescence analysis, direct 
binding studies and cross-linking experiments show that the transfected mouse 
LB6 cells specifically bind human uPA, which in turn activates plasminogen. The 
Mr of the mature human receptor expressed in mouse cells is approximately 
55,000, in accordance with the naturally occurring, highly glycosylated human 
uPAR. The Mr calculated on the basis of the cDNA sequence, approximately 35,000, 
agrees well with that of the deglycosylated receptor.
