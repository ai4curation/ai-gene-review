The clonal expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells requires the 
interaction with the microenvironment and is under the control of several 
cytokines. Here, we investigated the effect of IL-15 and IL-21, which are 
closely related to IL-2 and share the usage of the common gamma chain and of its 
JAK3-associated pathway. We found remarkable differences in the signal 
transduction pathways activated by these cytokines, which determined different 
responses in CLL cells. IL-15 caused cell proliferation and prevented apoptosis 
induced by surface IgM cross-linking. These effects were more evident in cells 
stimulated via surface CD40, which exhibited increased cell expression of 
IL-15Ralpha chain and, in some of the cases, also of IL-2Rbeta. IL-21 failed to 
induce CLL cell proliferation and instead promoted apoptosis. Following cell 
exposure to IL-15, phosphorylation of STAT5 was predominantly observed, whereas, 
following stimulation with IL-21, there was predominant STAT1 and STAT3 
activation. Moreover, IL-15 but not IL-21 caused an increased phosphorylation of 
Shc and ERK1/2. Pharmacological inhibition of JAK3 or of MEK, which 
phosphorylates ERK1/2, efficiently blocked IL-15-induced CLL cell proliferation 
and the antiapoptotic effect of this cytokine. The knowledge of the signaling 
pathways regulating CLL cell survival and proliferation may provide new 
molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.
