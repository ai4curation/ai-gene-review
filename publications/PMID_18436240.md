Tankyrases are recently discovered proteins implicated in many important 
functions in the cell including telomere homeostasis and mitosis. Tankyrase 
modulates the activity of target proteins through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and 
here we report the structure of the catalytic poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 
domain of human tankyrase 1. This is the first structure of a PARP domain from 
the tankyrase subfamily. The present structure reveals that tankyrases contain a 
short zinc-binding motif, which has not been predicted. Tankyrase activity 
contributes to telomere elongation observed in various cancer cells and 
tankyrase inhibition has been suggested as a potential route for cancer therapy. 
In comparison with other PARPs, significant structural differences are observed 
in the regions lining the substrate-binding site of tankyrase 1. These findings 
will be of great value to facilitate structure-based design of selective PARP 
inhibitors, in general, and tankyrase inhibitors, in particular.
