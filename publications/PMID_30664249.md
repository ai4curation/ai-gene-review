Stress granules (SGs) are evolutionary conserved aggregates of proteins and 
untranslated mRNAs formed in response to stress. Despite their importance for 
stress adaptation, no complete proteome composition has been reported for plant 
SGs. In this study, we addressed the existing gap. Importantly, we also provide 
evidence for metabolite sequestration within the SGs. To isolate SGs we used 
Arabidopsis seedlings expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of the 
SGs marker protein, Rbp47b, and an experimental protocol combining differential 
centrifugation with affinity purification (AP). SGs isolates were analysed using 
mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics. A quarter of the identified 
proteins constituted known or predicted SG components. Intriguingly, the 
remaining proteins were enriched in key enzymes and regulators, such as 
cyclin-dependent kinase A (CDKA), that mediate plant responses to stress. In 
addition to proteins, nucleotides, amino acids and phospholipids also 
accumulated in SGs. Taken together, our results indicated the presence of a 
preexisting SG protein interaction network; an evolutionary conservation of the 
proteins involved in SG assembly and dynamics; an important role for SGs in 
moderation of stress responses by selective storage of proteins and metabolites.
