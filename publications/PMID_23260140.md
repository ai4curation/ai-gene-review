Mitochondrial respiratory-chain complexes assemble from subunits of dual genetic 
origin assisted by specialized assembly factors. Whereas core subunits are 
translated on mitochondrial ribosomes, others are imported after cytosolic 
translation. How imported subunits are ushered to assembly intermediates 
containing mitochondria-encoded subunits is unresolved. Here, we report a 
comprehensive dissection of early cytochrome c oxidase assembly intermediates 
containing proteins required for normal mitochondrial translation and reveal 
assembly factors promoting biogenesis of human respiratory-chain complexes. We 
find that TIM21, a subunit of the inner-membrane presequence translocase, is 
also present in the major assembly intermediates containing newly 
mitochondria-synthesized and imported respiratory-chain subunits, which we term 
MITRAC complexes. Human TIM21 is dispensable for protein import but required for 
integration of early-assembling, presequence-containing subunits into 
respiratory-chain intermediates. We establish an unexpected molecular link 
between the TIM23 transport machinery and assembly of respiratory-chain 
complexes that regulate mitochondrial protein synthesis in response to their 
assembly state.
