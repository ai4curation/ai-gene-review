Bves is an integral membrane protein with no determined function and no homology 
to proteins outside of the Popdc family. It is widely expressed throughout 
development in myriad organisms. Here, we demonstrate an interaction between 
Bves and guanine nucleotide exchange factor T (GEFT), a GEF for Rho-family 
GTPases. This interaction represents the first identification of any protein 
that has a direct physical interaction with any member of the Popdc family. Bves 
and GEFT are shown to colocalize in adult skeletal muscle. We also demonstrate 
that exogenous expression of Bves reduces Rac1 and Cdc42 activity levels while 
not affecting levels of active RhoA. Consistent with a repression of Rac1 and 
Cdc42 activity, we show changes in speed of cell locomotion and cell roundness 
also result from exogenous expression of Bves. Modulation of Rho-family GTPase 
signaling by Bves would be highly consistent with previously described 
phenotypes occurring upon disruption of Bves function in a wide variety of model 
systems. Therefore, we propose Bves as a novel regulator of the Rac1 and Cdc42 
signaling cascades.
