Mutations in the genes encoding the inner nuclear membrane proteins lamin A/C 
and emerin produce cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy in humans and mice. The 
mechanism by which these broadly expressed gene products result in 
tissue-specific dysfunction is not known. We have identified a protein of the 
inner nuclear membrane that is highly expressed in striated and smooth muscle. 
This protein, myne-1 (myocyte nuclear envelope), is predicted to have seven 
spectrin repeats, an interrupted LEM domain and a single transmembrane domain at 
its C-terminus. We found that myne-1 is expressed upon early muscle 
differentiation in multiple intranuclear foci concomitant with lamin A/C 
expression. In mature muscle, myne-1 and lamin A/C are perfectly colocalized, 
although colocalization with emerin is only partial. Moreover, we show that 
myne-1 and lamin A/C coimmunoprecipitate from differentiated muscle in vitro. 
The muscle-specific inner nuclear envelope expression of myne-1, along with its 
interaction with lamin A/C, indicates that this gene is a potential mediator of 
cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy.
