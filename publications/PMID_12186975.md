Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) is a previously described histone 
acetyltransferase/transcriptional coactivator complex in yeast. At promoters of 
certain genes (HIS3 and TRP3), SAGA has an inhibitory function involving a 
nonproductive TATA-binding protein interaction mediated by the Spt3 and Spt8 
subunits. Related to this, Spt8-less SAGA is a major form of the complex under 
activating conditions for these genes. In the present study, we purify this 
activation-specific complex, called SALSA (SAGA altered, Spt8 absent). Besides 
lacking Spt8, SALSA contains Spt7 subunit that is truncated. Examining the role 
of this subunit, we find that C-terminally truncated SPT7 resulted in 
derepressed HIS3 transcription. Furthermore, when grown in rich media 
(repressing conditions), wild-type cells yielded predominantly SAGA, but Spt7 
C-terminal truncations resulted primarily in a form of complex similar to SALSA. 
Thus, SALSA-like structure and activating function can be partially 
recapitulated in yeast by truncating the C terminus of Spt7. Overall, these 
results lead to a model that for a subset of promoters SAGA is inhibitory 
through Spt3, Spt8, and an Spt8-interacting subdomain of Spt7, whereas SALSA is 
a form of complex for positive transcriptional regulation. These data clarify a 
mechanism by which a transcriptional regulatory complex can switch between 
positive and negative modulation.
