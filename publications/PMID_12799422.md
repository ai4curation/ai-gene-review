CrkII belongs to a family of adaptor proteins that become tyrosine 
phosphorylated after various stimuli. We examined the role of CrkII tyrosine 
phosphorylation in fibronectin-induced cell migration. Overexpression of CrkII 
inhibited dephosphorylation of focal adhesion components such as p130 
Crk-associated substrate (p130cas) and paxillin by protein tyrosine phosphatase 
1B (PTP1B). Tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII was dephosphorylated by PTP1B both in 
vitro and in vivo, showing for the first time that PTP1B directly 
dephosphorylates CrkII. A CrkII mutant in which tyrosine residue 221 was 
substituted by phenylalanine (CrkII-Y221F) could not be tyrosine phosphorylated, 
and it showed significantly increased binding to p130cas and paxillin. Enhanced 
binding of CrkII to p130cas has been reported to promote cell migration. 
Nonphosphorylated CrkII-Y221F promoted HT1080 cell migration on fibronectin, 
whereas wild-type CrkII did not at moderate expression levels. Moreover, 
co-expression of CrkII and PTP1B promoted HT1080 cell migration on fibronectin 
and retained tyrosine phosphorylation and binding of p130cas to CrkII, whereas 
paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced. These findings support the 
concepts that CrkII binding activity is regulated by tyrosine kinases and 
phosphatases, and that tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII can downmodulate cell 
migration mediated by the focal adhesion kinase/p130cas pathway.
