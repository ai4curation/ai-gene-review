In land plants, very-long-chain (VLC) alkanes are major components of cuticular 
waxes that cover aerial organs, mainly acting as a waterproof barrier to prevent 
nonstomatal water loss. Although thoroughly investigated, plant alkane synthesis 
remains largely undiscovered. The Arabidopsis thaliana ECERIFERUM1 (CER1) 
protein has been recognized as an essential element of wax alkane synthesis; 
nevertheless, its function remains elusive. In this study, a screen for CER1 
physical interaction partners was performed. The screen revealed that CER1 
interacts with the wax-associated protein ECERIFERUM3 (CER3) and endoplasmic 
reticulum-localized cytochrome b5 isoforms (CYTB5s). The functional relevance of 
these interactions was assayed through an iterative approach using yeast as a 
heterologous expression system. In a yeast strain manipulated to produce VLC 
acyl-CoAs, a strict CER1 and CER3 coexpression resulted in VLC alkane synthesis. 
The additional presence of CYTB5s was found to enhance CER1/CER3 alkane 
production. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that CER1 His clusters are 
essential for alkane synthesis, whereas those of CER3 are not, suggesting that 
CYTB5s are specific CER1 cofactors. Collectively, our study reports the 
identification of plant alkane synthesis enzymatic components and supports a new 
model for alkane production in which CER1 interacts with both CER3 and CYTB5 to 
catalyze the redox-dependent synthesis of VLC alkanes from VLC acyl-CoAs.

INTRODUCTION

The aerial epidermis of terrestrial plants produces and secretes a mixture of very-long-chain ( VLC ) lipids that assemble into a waterproof barrier called the cuticle. Strategically located at the plant–air interface, the cuticle plays a critical role in the interactions between the plant and its environment. Besides its main function in preventing plant desiccation, the cuticle is also involved in plant protection from UV radiation, a self-cleaning process called the lotus effect, which limits the deposition of biotic and abiotic pollutants on plant surfaces, and protection against plant pathogens and insects ( Shepherd and Wynne Griffiths, 2006 ). Furthermore, several lines of evidence have linked the cuticle to plant development processes, such as specialized epidermal cell differentiation and delimitation of organ boundaries ( Javelle et al., 2011 ). The protective capacities of the cuticle are mainly based on physical and biochemical properties of its two highly hydrophobic components, cutin and cuticular waxes ( Pollard et al., 2008 ; Domínguez et al., 2011 ). Overlying the epidermis cell wall, the first layer of the cuticle consists of cutin, a polyester of modified fatty acids and glycerol monomers, embedded with intracuticular waxes ( Pollard et al., 2008 ; Li and Beisson, 2009 ); covering the cutin matrix, epicuticular waxes form the smooth or crystalloid outermost layer of the cuticle ( Jeffree, 1996 ). Beyond the polymerized cutin, cuticular waxes mostly consist of a complex mixture of VLC aliphatic compounds, triterpenoids, as well as minor sterols and flavonoids ( Buschhaus and Jetter, 2011 ). Aliphatic acyl chains of waxes derive from very-long-chain fatty acids ( VLCFAs ), with predominant chain lengths ranging from 26 to 32 carbons, resulting from the epidermal acyl-CoA elongase activity ( Zheng et al., 2005 ; Bach et al., 2008 ; Joubès et al., 2008 ; Beaudoin et al., 2009 ). After elongation, acyl chains are processed according to two different biosynthetic routes: either the alcohol-forming pathway, yielding fatty alcohols and alkyl esters, or the alkane-forming pathway, generating fatty aldehydes, alkanes, and their derivatives ( Samuels et al., 2008 ).

In the past 20 years, reverse genetic analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants have provided significant advances in the understanding of wax metabolism ( Kunst and Samuels, 2009 ). In fact, biosynthesis of compounds on the alcohol-forming pathway is now well described, because genes have been clearly identified, and the corresponding proteins have been functionally characterized ( Rowland et al., 2006 ; Li et al., 2008 ). However, these approaches failed to uncover the enzymes involved in alkane synthesis, leaving the alkane-forming pathway poorly understood. Yet VLC alkanes dominate the wax mixture of many plant species, representing up to 70% of the total wax amount in Arabidopsis leaves, where they play critical roles in plant physiology, notably in pollen hydration and thus plant fertility, resistance to drought stress, and plant–pathogen interactions ( Aarts et al., 1995 ; Kosma et al., 2009 ; Bourdenx et al., 2011 ). Moreover, because alkanes are the major constituents of liquid fuels, the discovery of the alkane biosynthetic machinery in plants would provide a toolbox of enzymes for the production of renewable hydrocarbon sources and the next generations of biofuels ( Joyce and Stewart, 2011 ). Therefore, because of the importance of alkanes for both biotechnological purposes and plant physiological functions, the characterization of the plant VLC alkane–forming enzymes has been a challenging goal for decades ( Jetter and Kunst, 2008 ; Kunst and Samuels, 2009 ).

Early biochemical analyses led to the proposal that alkanes could be produced from elongated acyl chains via intermediate aldehydes. This hypothesis was based on the observed conversion of C 18 aldehyde into C 17 alkane with the release of CO in pea ( Pisum sativum ) and a green algae ( Botryococcus braunii ), suggesting that a potential decarbonylation mechanism occurred ( Cheesbrough and Kolattukudy, 1984 ; Dennis and Kolattukudy, 1991 ; Schneider-Belhaddad and Kolattukudy, 2000 ). Further characterization of the partially purified alkane synthesis activity in pea indicated that it requires metal ions and is inhibited by O 2 and reducing agents, suggesting that the reaction would be redox-independent ( Schneider-Belhaddad and Kolattukudy, 2000 ). Because VLC aldehydes are found in the pool of cuticular waxes, it was proposed that VLCFAs could be reduced by a fatty acid reductase into corresponding even-numbered aldehydes, and then an aldehyde decarbonylase ( AD ) could catalyze the conversion into VLC alkanes with the loss of one carbon ( Samuels et al., 2008 ). However, definitive evidence for intermediate aldehydes has never been provided, and enzymatic activities were never assessed. Interestingly, this putative biochemical mechanism can be compared with the long-chain alkane biosynthesis in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp and Nostoc punctiforme . Indeed, the microbial mechanism was recently reported to proceed via a two-step pathway from acyl–Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) precursors to an aldehyde intermediate and the hydrocarbon product involving two enzymes, an acyl reductase and an aldehyde decarbonylase ( Schirmer et al., 2010 ; Das et al., 2011 ).

The analysis of the Arabidopsis eceriferum1 ( cer1 ) mutant indicated the involvement of the corresponding protein in alkane biosynthesis. Indeed, the cer1 mutant is characterized by a nearly depleted load of alkanes and their derivates accompanied by a slight increase in aldehyde content ( Koornneef et al., 1989 ; Aarts et al., 1995 ; Jenks et al., 1995 ; Bourdenx et al., 2011 ). Support for the central role of CER1 in alkane production was provided by the recent characterization of Arabidopsis transgenic lines, in which CER1 overexpression led to a large and specific accumulation of wax VLC alkanes ( Bourdenx et al., 2011 ). Consistent with such an involvement in wax metabolism, CER1 expression was found confined to the epidermis of aerial organs and the CER1 protein located to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ), where wax biosynthesis takes place ( Kamigaki et al., 2009 ; Bourdenx et al., 2011 ). CER1 is a membrane-bound protein that shares no significant sequence similarity with functionally characterized proteins, except for a short sequence containing a tripartite His-rich motif HX 3 H+HX 2 HH+HX 2 HH ( Aarts et al., 1995 ). His-rich clusters are part of the di-iron catalytic core found in a large family of integral membrane enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism ( Shanklin and Cahoon, 1998 ). Therefore, it has been suggested that CER1 could have an enzymatic activity associated with alkane production (i.e., that CER1 could be the alkane-forming enzyme [ Aarts et al., 1995 ]). This hypothesis is further supported by the characterization of the ADs from cyanobacteria, which belong to a family of soluble nonheme di-iron carboxylate enzymes ( Schirmer et al., 2010 ). Nevertheless, the function of CER1 has never been provided, partly because of the lack of information about VLC alkane–forming activity at the molecular level, the unknown substrate, and the low solubility and unavailability of commercial VLC aldehydes. Furthermore, because expression of CER1 in heterologous systems did not lead to production of alkanes ( Bourdenx et al., 2011 ), the CER1 function remains a crucial open question for the understanding of VLC alkane formation.

In this article, the CER1 protein was used as a starting point to reconstitute the plant alkane–forming pathway. To learn more about CER1 function, an exploratory screen was conducted to identify CER1 physical interaction partners. In both yeast and plant cells, CER1 was found to interact with the wax-associated protein CER3 and with the cytochrome b5 isoforms (CYTB5s) serving as ER -reducing components. Through an iterative approach performed in a yeast heterologous system producing VLC acyl-CoAs, we showed that a mandatory CER1/CER3 coexpression results in VLC alkane production, thus identifying the enzymatic components catalyzing plant alkane synthesis. Arabidopsis CYTB5s were found to increase alkane production, and analysis of point-mutated CER1 and CER3 proteins suggested that CYTB5s are specific CER1 cofactors, highlighting a potential redox-dependent CER1 activity for alkane synthesis. Taken together, our results elucidate the plant alkane–forming pathway and support a new model for alkane synthesis in which CER1 and CER3 constitute the core components of a multiprotein enzymatic complex catalyzing the redox-dependent conversion of VLC acyl-CoAs to VLC alkanes.
