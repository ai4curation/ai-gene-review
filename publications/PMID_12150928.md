The Arabidopsis BAK1 (BRI1 Associated receptor Kinase 1) was identified by a 
yeast two-hybrid screen as a specific interactor for BRI1, a critical component 
of a membrane brassinosteroid (BR) receptor. In yeast, BAK1/BRI1 interaction 
activates their kinase activities through transphosphorylation. BAK1 and BRI1 
share similar gene expression and subcellular localization patterns and 
physically associate with each other in plants. Overexpression of the BAK1 gene 
leads to a phenotype reminiscent of BRI1-overexpression transgenic plants and 
rescues a weak bri1 mutant. In contrast, a bak1 knockout mutation gives rise to 
a weak bri1-like phenotype and enhances a weak bri1 mutation. We propose that 
BAK1 and BRI1 function together to mediate plant steroid signaling.
