The influence of bcl-2 and bax expression on apoptotic cell death in mouse 
intestinal epithelia was assessed using homozygously null mice. Apoptosis was 
induced in vivo by the enterotoxin 5-fluorouracil (5FU) or by gamma-irradiation 
and its cell positional incidence was assessed. 5FU and gamma-radiation treated 
bax-null mice surprisingly showed no reductions in apoptotic yield in the small 
intestine or midcolon at 4.5 h at cell positions in which both agents had 
previously been shown to strongly induce p53 protein expression. The colonic 
epithelia of 5FU treated bcl-2-null mice showed elevated levels of apoptosis at 
4.5 h: from 48 apoptotic events in wild-type mice to 273 in the nulls, scoring 
200 half crypts. The increase occurred specifically in the cell positions 
considered to harbour colonic stem cells, at the base of crypts, where there is 
selective expression of bcl-2. There was a modest but significant increase in 
apoptosis in the small intestine of the bcl-2-null mice although the epithelia 
of wild-type mice here are not immunohistochemically positive for bcl-2 protein. 
These findings show that bcl-2 plays a key role in determining the sensitivity 
of colonic stem cells to damage-induced death but that bax is not responsible 
for the p53-dependent induction of apoptosis in this context.
