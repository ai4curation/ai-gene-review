Hepatic binding of human and bovine growth hormones and ovine prolactin in the 
dwarf "little" mouse.

Herington AC, Harrison D, Graystone J.

Binding of human (hGH) and bovine (bGH) GH and ovine PRL (oPRL) has been 
compared in liver membranes from GH-deficient dwarf "little" mice (lit/lit) and 
their normal-sized littermates (lit/+). Binding of [125I]hGH to lit/lit 
membranes was dependent on time, temperature, and membrane concentration and was 
reversible. Scatchard plots of the binding of [125I]hGH to male and female 
lit/lit and lit/+ membranes were linear, with no significant differences between 
binding affinities (overall mean +/- SE, 1.42 +/- 0.27 X 10(9) M-1; n = 24). The 
hormonal specificity of binding was complex, with hGH being displaced by both 
somatotropic (bGH) and lactogenic (oPRL) competitors, indicating the presence of 
a mixed population of receptors. This conclusion was supported by the specific 
binding of both [125I]bGH and [125I]oPRL to membranes from male and female 
lit/lit and lit/+ mice. No differences in the specific binding of [125I]bGH to 
any membrane type was observed, indicating that GH receptors were at normal 
levels in lit/lit mice despite their deficiency of pituitary and serum GH. A sex 
difference in hGH and oPRL binding was seen only in normal (lit/+) mice. Male 
and female lit/lit mice exhibited the same degree of binding as normal female 
mice. These studies have demonstrated that dwarf little mice have normal levels 
of hepatic GH and PRL receptors, with binding characteristics not different from 
those of normal mice. Thus, it would appear that the mechanism of regulation of 
GH receptors by GH itself is different in this animal model of GH deficiency 
than in the Snell dwarf mouse and the hypophysectomized rat, where GH receptor 
levels are very low or absent. The failure of lit/lit mice to grow normally 
despite normal levels of GH receptor raises questions regarding the site and 
mechanism of the growth defect in the little mouse.
