PURPOSE: The small eye mouse mutant (Sey) is caused by a mutation of the Pax6 
gene. Previous studies, in which aggregation chimeras were used, have 
demonstrated that Sey/Sey cells contribute poorly to the neural retina forming 
small clumps of cells restricted to the inner retina at embryonic day 16.5. In 
addition, Sey/+ cells are absent from the lens epithelium during this embryonic 
period and postnatally. This study was conducted to determine the fates of these 
Sey/Sey and Sey/+ cells with continued development in chimeric mouse eyes.
METHODS: Observations were made on heterozygous and homozygous Sey cells in 
chimeric eyes from postnatal day (P)0 to P10.
RESULTS: In Sey/Sey<-->wild-type (wt) chimeras, all Sey/Sey cells originating 
from retinal progenitor cells died at perinatal times. The only remaining 
Sey/Sey cells in the neural retina were associated with blood vessels, including 
vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia, which have 
extraretinal origins. In contrast, Sey/+ cells formed all retinal cell classes. 
As previously reported, Sey/Sey cells were absent from the lens and corneal 
epithelium. However, in contrast to previous reports, Sey/+ cells contributed to 
the lens epithelium as well as corneal tissues, and Sey/Sey cells were absent 
from the anterior retinal pigment epithelium.
CONCLUSIONS: All evidence showed that, when Pax6 is absent at the initial stages 
of the development, Sey/Sey cells that contribute to the neural retina die, even 
when wild-type cells are available to provide normal environmental cues.
