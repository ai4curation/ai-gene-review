Ribosomes are translational machineries that catalyse protein synthesis. 
Ribosome structures from various species are known at the atomic level, but 
obtaining the structure of the human ribosome has remained a challenge; efforts 
to address this would be highly relevant with regard to human diseases. Here we 
report the near-atomic structure of the human ribosome derived from 
high-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and atomic model 
building. The structure has an average resolution of 3.6 Å, reaching 2.9 Å 
resolution in the most stable regions. It provides unprecedented insights into 
ribosomal RNA entities and amino acid side chains, notably of the transfer RNA 
binding sites and specific molecular interactions with the exit site tRNA. It 
reveals atomic details of the subunit interface, which is seen to remodel 
strongly upon rotational movements of the ribosomal subunits. Furthermore, the 
structure paves the way for analysing antibiotic side effects and diseases 
associated with deregulated protein synthesis.
