Prohibitin (PHB) is a highly conserved protein that has multiple functions in 
the cell. We recently demonstrated that PHB plays an important role in combating 
oxidative stress and its expression is down-regulated in human and animal models 
of inflammatory bowel disease. Little is known regarding the regulation of PHB 
expression in intestine or other tissues. In this study we examined the 
regulation of PHB expression in intestinal epithelial cells using the model cell 
line Caco2-BBE. We successfully cloned the 1192-bp human PHB promoter region and 
identified the transcription start site 1594 bp upstream from the translation 
start site due to an intervening intron. We show that the acute phase cytokine 
interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases PHB protein and mRNA abundance and induces PHB 
promoter activation. The IL-6 response element site in the PHB promoter is 
required for maximal basal promoter activity and responsiveness to IL-6. IL-6 
also increases binding of nuclear proteins to the IL-6 response element in the 
PHB promoter that are supershifted by a STAT3 antibody. Both basal promoter 
activity and IL-6 responsiveness are attenuated by signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3 short interference RNA, suggesting that signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 mediates PHB activity by IL-6. 
Confirming these in vitro results, IL-6(-/-) mice exhibit reduced PHB expression 
in the colon compared with wild-type mice. These results suggest that IL-6 
modulates PHB expression in cultured intestinal epithelial cells and in the 
intestine in vivo.
