We show that phorbol ester treatment of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts induces rapid 
translocation of PKC from a perinuclear site to the nucleus, extending findings 
in PC12 and NG108-15 cells and in myocytes. We have immunoprecipitated the PKC 
from nuclei isolated from phorbol ester-treated fibroblasts and identified six 
proteins which associate with nuclear PKC. These have been characterised as 
matrin 3, transferrin, Rac GTPase activating protein 1, vimentin, beta-actin and 
annexin II by MALDI-TOF-MS. We have confirmed that these proteins associate with 
PKC by gel overlay and/or dot blotting assays. The role of these PKC-associating 
proteins in the nucleus and their interaction with PKC are considered.
