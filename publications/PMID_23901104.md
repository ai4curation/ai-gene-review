The multisubunit homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) 
membrane-tethering complex is required for late endosome-lysosome and 
autophagosome-lysosome fusion in mammals. We have determined the crystal 
structure of the human HOPS subunit Vps33A, confirming its identity as a 
Sec1/Munc18 family member. We show that HOPS subunit Vps16 recruits Vps33A to 
the human HOPS complex and that residues 642-736 are necessary and sufficient 
for this interaction, and we present the crystal structure of Vps33A in complex 
with Vps16(642-736). Mutations at the binding interface disrupt the Vps33A-Vps16 
interaction both in vitro and in cells, preventing recruitment of Vps33A to the 
HOPS complex. The Vps33A-Vps16 complex provides a structural framework for 
studying the association between Sec1/Munc18 proteins and tethering complexes.
