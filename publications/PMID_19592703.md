Human FBP21 (formin-binding protein 21) contains a matrin-type zinc finger and 
two tandem WW domains. It is a component of the spliceosomes and interacts with 
several established splicing factors. Here we demonstrate for the first time 
that FBP21 is an activator of pre-mRNA splicing in vivo and that its splicing 
activation function and interaction with the splicing factor SIPP1 (splicing 
factor that interacts with PQBP1 and PP1) are both mediated by the two tandem WW 
domains of group III. We determined the solution structure of the tandem WW 
domains of FBP21 and found that the WW domains recognize peptide ligands 
containing either group II (PPLP) or group III (PPR) motifs. The binding 
interfaces involve both the XP and XP2 grooves of the two WW domains. 
Significantly, the tandem WW domains of FBP21 are connected by a highly flexible 
region, enabling their simultaneous interaction with two proline-rich motifs of 
SIPP1. The strong interaction between SIPP1 and FBP21 can be explained by the 
conjugation of two low affinity interactions with the tandem WW domains. Our 
study provides a structural basis for understanding the molecular mechanism 
underlying the functional implication of FBP21 and the biological specificity of 
tandem WW domains.
