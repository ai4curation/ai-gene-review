The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway promotes cell growth in response to many 
cues, including amino acids, which act through the Rag guanosine triphosphatases 
(GTPases) to promote mTORC1 translocation to the lysosomal surface, its site of 
activation. Although progress has been made in identifying positive regulators 
of the Rags, it is unknown if negative factors also exist. Here, we identify 
GATOR as a complex that interacts with the Rags and is composed of two 
subcomplexes we call GATOR1 and -2. Inhibition of GATOR1 subunits (DEPDC5, 
Nprl2, and Nprl3) makes mTORC1 signaling resistant to amino acid deprivation. In 
contrast, inhibition of GATOR2 subunits (Mios, WDR24, WDR59, Seh1L, and Sec13) 
suppresses mTORC1 signaling, and epistasis analysis shows that GATOR2 negatively 
regulates DEPDC5. GATOR1 has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for RagA 
and RagB, and its components are mutated in human cancer. In cancer cells with 
inactivating mutations in GATOR1, mTORC1 is hyperactive and insensitive to amino 
acid starvation, and such cells are hypersensitive to rapamycin, an mTORC1 
inhibitor. Thus, we identify a key negative regulator of the Rag GTPases and 
reveal that, like other mTORC1 regulators, Rag function can be deregulated in 
cancer.
