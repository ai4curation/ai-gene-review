As sessile organisms, plants have evolved multiple mechanisms to respond to 
environmental changes to improve survival. Arabidopsis plants show accelerated 
flowering at increased temperatures. Here we show that Jumonji-C 
domain-containing protein JMJ30 directly binds to the flowering-repressor 
FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) locus and removes the repressive histone modification H3 
lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). At elevated temperatures, the JMJ30 RNA and 
protein are stabilized, and FLC expression is maintained at high levels to 
prevent extreme precocious flowering. The double mutant of JMJ30 and its 
homologue JMJ32, grown at elevated temperatures, exhibits an early-flowering 
phenotype similar to the flc mutant, which is associated with increased H3K27me3 
levels at the FLC locus and decreased FLC expression. Furthermore, ectopic 
expression of JMJ30 causes an FLC-dependent late-flowering phenotype. Taken 
together, JMJ30/JMJ32-mediated histone demethylation at the FLC locus 
constitutes a balancing mechanism in flowering control at warm temperatures to 
prevent premature early flowering.
