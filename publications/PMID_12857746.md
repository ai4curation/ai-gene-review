The oncoprotein Ski represses transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling in 
an N-CoR-independent manner. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this 
event has not been elucidated. Here, we identify an additional domain in Ski 
that mediates interaction with Smad3 which is important for this repression. 
This domain is distinct from the previously reported N-terminal Smad3 binding 
domain in Ski. Individual alanine substitution of several residues in the domain 
significantly affected Ski-Smad3 interaction. Furthermore, combined mutations 
within this domain, together with those in the previously identified Smad3 
binding domain, can completely abolish the interaction of Ski with Smad3, while 
mutation in each domain alone retained partial interaction. By introducing those 
mutations that abolish direct interaction with Smad3 or Smad4 individually, or 
in combination, we show that interaction of Ski with either Smad3 or Smad4 is 
sufficient for Ski-mediated repression of TGF-beta signaling. Furthermore our 
results clearly demonstrate that Ski does not disrupt Smad3-Smad4 heteromer 
formation, and recruitment of Ski to the Smad3/4 complex through binding to 
either Smad3 or Smad4 is both necessary and sufficient for repression.
