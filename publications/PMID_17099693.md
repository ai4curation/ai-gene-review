The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) of Aurora-B, Borealin, INCENP (inner 
centromere protein) and Survivin coordinates essential chromosomal and 
cytoskeletal events during mitosis. Here, we show that the nuclear export 
receptor Crm1 is crucially involved in tethering the CPC to the centromere by 
interacting with a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), evolutionarily 
conserved in all mammalian Survivin proteins. We show that inhibition of the 
Survivin-Crm1 interaction by treatment with leptomycin B or by 
RNA-interference-mediated Crm1 depletion prevents centromeric targeting of 
Survivin. The genetic inactivation of the Survivin-Crm1 interaction by mutation 
of the NES affects the correct localization and function of Survivin and the CPC 
during mitosis. By contrast, CPC assembly does not seem to require the 
Survivin-Crm1 interaction. Our report shows the functional significance of the 
Survivin-Crm1 interface and provides a novel link between the mitotic effector 
Crm1 and the CPC.
