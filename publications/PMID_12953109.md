Abstract

Ethylene responses in Arabidopsis are controlled by the ETR receptor family. The receptors function as negative regulators of downstream signal transduction components and fall into two distinct subfamilies based on sequence similarity. To clarify the levels of functional redundancy between receptor isoforms, combinatorial mutant lines were generated that included the newly isolated ers1-2 allele. Based on the etiolated seedling growth response, all mutant combinations tested exhibited some constitutive ethylene responsiveness but also remained responsive to exogenous ethylene, indicating that all five receptor isoforms can contribute to signaling and no one receptor subtype is essential. On the other hand, light-grown seedlings and adult ers1 etr1 double mutants exhibited severe phenotypes such as miniature rosette size, delayed flowering, and sterility, revealing a distinct role for subfamily I receptors in light-grown plants. Introduction of an ein2 loss-of-function mutation into the ers1 etr1 double mutant line resulted in plants that phenocopy ein2 single mutants, indicating that all phenotypes observed in the ers1 etr1 double mutant are EIN2 dependent.

INTRODUCTION

Studies in Arabidopsis have provided a relatively detailed model of the primary steps in the signaling pathway elicited by the gaseous plant hormone ethylene. According to this model, ethylene is perceived by a family of five membrane-bound receptors related to bacterial two-component regulators (for review, see Bleecker and Kende, 2000 ). These receptors are thought to transmit signal through the interaction with a Raf-related Ser/Thr kinase, CTR1 ( Kieber et al., 1993 ; Clark et al., 1998 ). The receptor/CTR1 complex acts to negatively regulate ethylene-response pathways by suppressing the activity of the putative ion channel, EIN2 ( Alonso et al., 1999 ). Ethylene binding to the receptor complex inhibits signaling, leading to an increase in EIN2 activity and an upregulation of ethylene-response pathways ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ). The EIN2 protein is thought to stimulate ethylene responses through the activation of a transcriptional cascade mediated by the EIN3 family of transcription factors ( Chao et al., 1997 ; Solano et al., 1998 ).

This model of ethylene signal transduction provides a conceptual framework that is consistent with phenotypes exhibited by plants with mutations in the genetically defined ethylene-signaling components. The placement of CTR1 between the receptors and EIN2 in the pathway model is based on epistatic relationships determined by double mutant analyses and on data demonstrating physical interactions between the transmitter domains of ETR1, ETR2, and ERS1 and the regulatory domain of CTR1 ( Roman et al., 1995 ; Clark et al., 1998 ; Cancel and Larsen, 2002 ). The role of ethylene as an inverse agonist is supported by the discovery that Arabidopsis lines containing loss-of-function mutations in three or more ethylene receptor genes exhibit a constitutive ethylene-response phenotype, similar to the phenotype of loss-of-function mutants in CTR1 ( Kieber et al., 1993 ; Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ).

Although the five members of the Arabidopsis ethylene receptor family share a high degree of sequence identity, each has distinguishing characteristics. All members contain an N-terminal membrane-associated sensor domain, which shows high-affinity ethylene binding in the case of ERS1 and ETR1 ( Schaller and Bleecker, 1995 ; Schaller et al., 1995 ; Hall et al., 2000 ). Additional studies with ETR1 indicated that ethylene binding is mediated through a copper cofactor ( Rodriguez et al., 1999 ). The C-terminal domains of the receptors show varying degrees of sequence identity to the His kinase catalytic domains of bacterial two-component regulators. In bacterial systems, these proteins transduce signal via the autophosphorylation of a His residue in the kinase transmitter domain, followed by the transfer of phosphate to an Asp residue in the receiver domain of a response regulator protein ( West and Stock, 2001 ).

The ETR1 , ETR2 , and EIN4 receptors are termed “hybrid kinases” because they include a C-terminal receiver domain, whereas the ERS1 and ERS2 receptors lack this domain. The residues thought to be essential for His kinase activity are conserved in ETR1 and ERS1 ( Chang et al., 1993 ; Hua et al., 1995 ) but are not conserved completely in ETR2 , EIN4 , and ERS2 ( Hua et al., 1998 ; Sakai et al., 1998 ). Based on overall sequence similarity, the members of the ETR receptor family can be divided into two subfamilies: subfamily I, which includes ETR1 and ERS1 ; and subfamily II, which includes ETR2 , EIN4 , and ERS2 .

All members of the ETR family are functionally linked to ethylene signaling by virtue of the fact that specific missense mutations in the ethylene binding domain of any one family member leads to dominant ethylene insensitivity that affects responses throughout the plant ( Bleecker et al., 1988 ; Hua et al., 1995 , 1998 ; Sakai et al., 1998 ). No ethylene-response phenotype is exhibited by etr1 , etr2 , ein4 , or ers2 single loss-of-function mutants, indicating some level of redundancy between receptor isoforms ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ). In addition, the constitutive ethylene-response phenotype observed in various receptor triple-mutant combinations provides evidence that each receptor isoform makes some contribution to signaling through the ethylene-response pathway. However, differences in the structural features of individual receptor isoforms raise the question of whether specific members of the ETR family perform unique functions.

The studies of receptor-deficient Arabidopsis lines also raised the question of whether the ETR family mediates signaling events distinct from the CTR1/EIN2 -dependent ethylene-response pathway. A general growth deficiency in etr1 loss-of-function mutants was suggested to be an ethylene-independent phenotype ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ). In addition, the quadruple loss-of-function etr1 etr2 ein4 ers2 mutant displays phenotypes that are not observed in ctr1 loss-of-function lines or in wild-type plants treated continuously with high levels of ethylene, including a substantial delay in flowering time and sterility ( Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ). It was not established whether these severe phenotypes required EIN2 function or whether such phenotypes resulted from the ethylene receptors regulating additional pathways. Furthermore, no loss-of-function ERS1 mutant had been identified, allowing for studies of the specific contribution of ERS1 to ethylene signaling. Recently, a loss-of-function allele of ERS1 , ers1-2 , was isolated ( Zhao et al., 2002 ; Wang et al., 2003 ). As with previous loss-of-function receptor mutants, ers1-2 single mutants exhibited no obvious defects. However, an ers1 etr1 double loss-of-function line showed a severe constitutive response phenotype, suggesting that subfamily I receptors play a particularly important role in signaling.

To extend our understanding of the distinct functions of specific ethylene receptor isoforms in Arabidopsis growth and development, we report here the detailed characterization of combinatorial loss-of-function receptor mutants, including ers1 etr1 double mutants. In addition to displaying severe constitutive ethylene-response phenotypes, the ers1 etr1 double mutant showed a number of defects in reproductive development not usually associated with ethylene signaling. However, evidence is presented here that even these severe phenotypic effects are mediated through EIN2.
