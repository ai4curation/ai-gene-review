Meiosis is a specialized cell division that halves the genome complement, 
producing haploid gametes/spores from diploid cells. Proper separation of 
homologous chromosomes at the first meiotic division requires the production of 
physical connections (chiasmata) between homologs through recombinational 
exchange of chromosome arms after sister-chromatid cohesion is established but 
before chromosome segregation takes place. The events of meiotic prophase must 
thus occur in a strictly temporal order, but the molecular controls coordinating 
these events have not been well elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the 
budding yeast cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 directly regulates the formation of 
the DNA double-strand breaks that initiate recombination by phosphorylating the 
Mer2/Rec107 protein and thereby modulating interactions of Mer2 with other 
proteins required for break formation. We propose that this function of Cdc28 
helps to coordinate the events of meiotic prophase with each other and with 
progression through prophase.

Introduction

During the first meiotic division, homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes are segregated. In most organisms, homologs must be physically connected to ensure their proper alignment on the meiosis I spindle (reviewed in Page and Hawley, 2003 ; Petronczki et al., 2003 ). Physical connections are achieved by exchange of chromosome arms through chiasma formation, while sister chromatid cohesion is maintained distal to the exchange. Failure to establish chiasmata causes missegregation at meiosis I and results in meiotic cell death or aneuploid gametes. Although the cues triggering meiotic entry differ between organisms, the orderly progression of events leading to chiasma formation and many of the proteins involved are widely conserved (reviewed in Gerton and Hawley, 2005 ; Zickler and Kleckner, 1999 ).

Each chiasma is an ensemble of local DNA exchange (a crossover recombination product) plus higher order chromosome structure changes at the site of recombination (exchange of chromosome axes and local separation of sister chromatids) ( Jones, 1987 ; Page and Hawley, 2003 ; Zickler and Kleckner, 1999 ). To build this ensemble, different processes must occur in the correct order: premeiotic DNA replication and establishment of sister chromatid cohesion must precede initiation of recombination and, in turn, these events must precede dissolution of arm cohesion and chromosome segregation ( Page and Hawley, 2003 ; Petronczki et al., 2003 ). Thus, several processes must be temporally coordinated with each other and with progression through meiotic prophase. The molecular basis for this coordination is not well understood.

One candidate for coordinating events of meiotic prophase is the cell-cycle regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK; in budding yeast, Cdc28). Indeed, Cdc28 is required for exit from the pachytene stage ( Shuster and Byers, 1989 ) and, along with its B-type cyclin activators, Clb5 and Clb6, for premeiotic DNA replication, analogous to its role in promoting S phase during vegetative growth ( Benjamin et al., 2003 ; Stuart and Wittenberg, 1998 ). Although the relevant substrates of Cdc28 remain to be identified, these findings demonstrate that CDK does regulate at least some of the processes required for chiasma formation.

It has proven more difficult to establish whether CDK also directly promotes meiotic recombination. In the absence of Clb5 and Clb6, the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination are not formed ( Smith et al., 2001 ). Because several conditions that block premeiotic S phase also block DSB formation ( Borde et al., 2000 ; Simchen et al., 1976 ), it appeared that DSB formation might be indirectly promoted by CDK through control of DNA replication (reviewed in Baudat and Keeney, 2001 ; Smith et al., 2001 ). However, other studies in budding and fission yeasts suggest that recombination is not absolutely dependent on premeiotic DNA replication (e.g., Hochwagen et al., 2005 ; Murakami and Nurse, 2001 ), raising the alternative possibility that recombination is more directly dependent on CDK activity.

Here, we demonstrate that CDK directly promotes DSB formation and we identify a phosphorylation target important in this process. DSBs are formed by the conserved Spo11 protein plus accessory factors that in budding yeast include Mer2/Rec107 (hereafter Mer2) ( Keeney, 2001 ). Phosphorylation of Mer2 by cyclin-CDK complexes modulates interactions of Mer2 with other DSB proteins and is critical for DSB formation. These results suggest that regulation of DSB formation by CDK is part of the mechanism that coordinates recombination with progression through meiotic prophase.

Discussion

Chiasma formation requires temporal coordination of the initiation of meiotic recombination with progression through prophase, but the molecular events ensuring this coordination are not well understood. We provide evidence that Mer2 is phosphorylated by Cdc28-Clb5/Clb6 complexes early in meiosis and that this phosphorylation promotes DSB formation by fostering physical interactions between Mer2 and other proteins. These results provide a mechanistic link between DSB formation and the activity levels of specific cyclin-Cdc28 complexes. We propose that this link is one facet of the mechanism for coordinating DSB formation with progression through meiotic prophase. Although it is certainly likely that many other processes also contribute to controlling the timing of DSB formation (discussed further below), these studies are the first to establish a direct connection between initiation of meiotic recombination and a key regulator of cell cycle progression.

Yeast strains and culture methods

Strains are isogenic diploid derivatives of SK1 ( Kane and Roth, 1974 ) and are listed in Supplemental Table 1 . The mer2 δ ::kanMX4 allele was amplified from a Research Genetics knockout strain. Strains expressing Mer2 tagged with 5 myc repeats were used for all experiments except those in Figure 1 , in which Mer2 was tagged with 8 myc repeats. Similar immunocytological results were obtained with a MER2myc5 strain (data not shown). MER2myc8::URA3 was generated using the tag-URA3-tag strategy previously described ( Kee et al., 2004 ). A MER2myc5 derivative of a MER2myc8::URA3 strain was generated by recombination to lose the URA3 cassette. To generate subsequent MER2myc5::URA3 constructs, MER2myc5 plus ~500 bp upstream and downstream was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pRS314 ( Sikorski and Hieter, 1989 ). Desired mutations were introduced by the QuickChange system (Stratagene), verified by sequencing, then subcloned into pRS306 ( URA3 integrating vector). Untagged versions of the mer2 mutants were created similarly, except that the starting plasmid contained untagged MER2 amplified from SK1 genomic DNA and cloned directly into pRS306. Tagged and untagged MER2 alleles were integrated at mer2 δ ::kanMX4 by linearization of vectors with EcoRI and yeast transformation by electroporation. Correct targeting was confirmed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA, and retention of the desired point mutations was confirmed by diagnostic restriction patterns of PCR-amplified genomic DNA. MER2myc5 complemented a mer2 null mutant well, but not completely as indicated by a slight decrease in spore viability ( Figure 4E ) and by an increase in the frequency of polycomplexes observed in meiotic chromosome spreads (data not shown). The clb5 δ ::kanMX4 and clb6 δ ::TRP1 alleles ( Stuart and Wittenberg, 1998 ) were obtained from strains provided by C. Wittenberg (Scripps Research Institute) and the cdc28as1 allele from a strain ( Benjamin et al., 2003 ) provided by K. Benjamin and I. Herskowitz (University of California, San Francisco).

Meiotic cultures were prepared as decribed ( Kee and Keeney, 2002 ). Briefly, cultures were grown in liquid YPA (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto Peptone, and 1% potassium acetate) for 13.5 hr at 30°C, followed by harvesting and resuspension in SPM (0.3% potassium acetate and 0.02% raffinose) preequilibrated at 30°C. Cells were cultured in SPM at 30°C and samples taken at the times indicated.

Cytological methods

Surface spread meiotic chromosomes were prepared as described ( Kee et al., 2004 ). Staining was performed as described ( Gasior et al., 1998 ) with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-myc (1:500, Covance), guinea pig polyclonal anti-GST-Zip1 (1:1000, this laboratory), and rabbit polyclonal Red1 (1:100, G.S. Roeder, Yale University). Secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at a 1:500 dilution: goat anti-mouse Alexa-488, goat anti-guinea pig Alexa-546, and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa-594. The anti-myc antibody yielded no detectable chromatin labeling in either meiotic or nonmeiotic cells ( Figure 1E and data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence images were captured as described ( Kee and Keeney, 2002 ).
