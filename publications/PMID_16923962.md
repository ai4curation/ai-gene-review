The NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2 plays a key role in connecting 
cellular metabolism with gene silencing and aging. The androgen receptor (AR) is 
a ligand-regulated modular nuclear receptor governing prostate cancer cellular 
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to androgens, 
including dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Here, SIRT1 antagonists induce endogenous 
AR expression and enhance DHT-mediated AR expression. SIRT1 binds and 
deacetylates the AR at a conserved lysine motif. Human SIRT1 (hSIRT1) repression 
of DHT-induced AR signaling requires the NAD-dependent catalytic function of 
hSIRT1 and the AR lysine residues deacetylated by SIRT1. SIRT1 inhibited 
coactivator-induced interactions between the AR amino and carboxyl termini. 
DHT-induced prostate cancer cellular contact-independent growth is also blocked 
by SIRT1, providing a direct functional link between the AR, which is a critical 
determinant of progression of human prostate cancer, and the sirtuins.
