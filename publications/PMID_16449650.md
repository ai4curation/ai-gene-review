The transcriptional corepressor mSin3 is associated with histone deacetylases 
(HDACs) and is utilized by many DNA-binding transcriptional repressors. We have 
cloned and characterized a novel mSin3A-binding protein, SAP25. SAP25 binds to 
the PAH1 domain of mSin3A, associates with the mSin3A-HDAC complex in vivo, and 
represses transcription when tethered to DNA. SAP25 is required for 
mSin3A-mediated, but not N-CoR-mediated, repression. SAP25 is a 
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, actively exported from the nucleus by a 
CRM1-dependent mechanism. A fraction of SAP25 is located in promyelocytic 
leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies, and PML induces a striking nuclear 
accumulation of SAP25. An isotope-coded affinity tag quantitative proteomic 
analysis of the SAP25 complex revealed that SAP25 is associated with several 
components of the mSin3 complex, nuclear export machinery, and regulators of 
transcription and cell cycle. These results suggest that SAP25 is a novel core 
component of the mSin3 corepressor complex whose subcellular location is 
regulated by PML.
