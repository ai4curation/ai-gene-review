The PTEN tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated in human tumors, 
including prostate cancer. Based on the Cre/loxP system, we generated a novel 
mouse prostate cancer model by targeted inactivation of the Pten gene. In this 
model, Cre recombinase was expressed under the control of the prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) promoter. Conditional biallelic and monoallelic Pten knock-out 
mice were viable and Pten recombination was prostate-specific. Mouse cohorts 
were systematically characterized at 4 to 5, 7 to 9, and 10 to 14 months. A 
slightly increased proliferation rate of epithelial cells was observed in all 
prostate lobes of monoallelic Pten knock-out mice (PSA-Cre;Pten-loxP/+), but 
minimal pathologic changes were detected. All homozygous knock-out mice 
(PSA-Cre;Pten-loxP/loxP) showed an increased size of the luminal epithelial 
cells, large areas of hyperplasia, focal prostate intraepithelial neoplasia 
lesions and an increased prostate weight at 4 to 5 months. More extensive 
prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and focal microinvasion occurred at 7 to 9 
months; invasive prostate carcinoma was detected in all male 
PSA-Cre;Pten-loxP/loxP mice at 10 to 14 months. At 15 to 16 months, a rare lymph 
node metastasis was found. In hyperplastic cells and in tumor cells, the 
expression of phospho-AKT was up-regulated. In hyperplastic and tumor cells, 
expression of luminal epithelial cell cytokeratins was up-regulated; tumor cells 
were negative for basal epithelial cell cytokeratins. Androgen receptor 
expression remained detectable at all stages of tumor development. The 
up-regulation of phospho-AKT correlated with an increased proliferation rate of 
the epithelial cells, but not with a reduced apoptosis.
