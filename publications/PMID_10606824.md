This study investigated the effects of varying durations of exercise training on 
heat shock proteins 72 and 73 (HSP72/73) induction in the rat adrenal gland. 
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (120 days old) were assigned to either a sedentary 
control group (C) or one of the three endurance exercise training groups. 
Trained animals ran on a treadmill at approximately 75% VO2max for 10 weeks (4-5 
days week-1) at one of the three different exercise durations (30 min day-1=T30, 
60 min day-1=T60, or 90 min day-1=T90). All durations of exercise training 
resulted in an increase in the HSP72 levels (P < 0.0001). The magnitude of the 
training-induced elevation in the HSP72 levels in the adrenal gland increased as 
a function of the training duration ( approximately 60-fold increase in T90; 
approximately 40-fold increase in T60; and approximately 15-fold increase in 
T30). Longer exercise durations (>60 min day-1), also resulted in small but 
significant increase in HSP73 level ( approximately 1.2-fold increase in both 
T60 and T90; P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the physiological stress 
created by chronic treadmill running can induce both HSP72 and HSP73 in rat 
adrenal gland. Increased levels of adrenal HSP72/73 expression during rigorous 
exercise, may be one of the adaptive mechanisms of the adrenals to cope with an 
increased dose of stress.
