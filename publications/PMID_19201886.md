EBV persists for life in the human host while facing vigorous antiviral 
responses that are induced upon primary infection. This persistence supports the 
idea that herpesviruses have acquired dedicated functions to avoid immune 
elimination. The recently identified EBV gene product BNLF2a blocks TAP. As a 
result, reduced amounts of peptides are transported by TAP from the cytoplasm 
into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen for binding to newly synthesized HLA 
class I molecules. Thus, BNLF2a perturbs detection by cytotoxic T cells. The 
60-aa-long BNLF2a protein prevents the binding of both peptides and ATP to TAP, 
yet further mechanistic insight is, to date, lacking. In this study, we report 
that EBV BNLF2a represents a membrane-associated protein that colocalizes with 
its target TAP in subcellular compartments, primarily the ER. In cells devoid of 
TAP, expression levels of BNLF2a protein are greatly diminished, while ER 
localization of the remaining BNLF2a is retained. For interactions of BNLF2a 
with the HLA class I peptide-loading complex, the presence of TAP2 is essential, 
whereas tapasin is dispensible. Importantly, we now show that in B cells 
supporting EBV lytic replication, the BNLF2a protein is expressed early in 
infection, colocalizing and associating with the peptide-loading complex. These 
results imply that, during productive EBV infection, BNLF2a contributes to TAP 
inhibition and surface HLA class I down-regulation. In this way, EBV 
BNLF2a-mediated evasion from HLA class I-restricted T cell immunity contributes 
to creating a window for undetected virus production.
