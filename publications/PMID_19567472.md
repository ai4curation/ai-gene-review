Maintaining proper telomere length requires the presence of the telomerase 
enzyme. Here we show that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic 
component of telomerase, is recruited to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear 
bodies through its interaction with PML-IV. Treatment of interferon-alpha 
(IFNalpha) in H1299 cells resulted in the increase of PML proteins with a 
concurrent decrease of telomerase activity, as previously reported. PML 
depletion, however, stimulated telomerase activity that had been inhibited by 
IFNalpha with no changes in TERT mRNA levels. Upon treatment with IFNalpha, 
exogenous TERT localized to PML nuclear bodies and binding between TERT and PML 
increased. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses showed that TERT 
specifically bound to PML-IV. Residues 553-633 of the C-terminal region of 
PML-IV were required for its interaction with the TERT region spanning residues 
1-350 and 595-946. The expression of PML-IV and its deletion mutant, 553-633, 
suppressed intrinsic telomerase activity in H1299. TERT-mediated 
immunoprecipitation of PML or the 553-633 fragment demonstrated that these 
interactions inhibited telomerase activity. H1299 cell lines stably expressing 
PML-IV displayed decreased telomerase activity with no change of TERT mRNA 
levels. Accordingly, telomere length of PML-IV stable cell lines was shortened. 
These results indicate that PML-IV is a negative regulator of telomerase in the 
post-translational state.
