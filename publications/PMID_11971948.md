Feeding interleukin-4 (IL-4) deficient C57BL/6 LDL receptor (LDLr)(-/-) mice a 
modified diet to investigate the role of this cytokine in cholesterol metabolism 
led to an unexpected phenotype. IL-4(-/-) --> LDLr(-/-) mice had enlarged 
gallbladders and an increased mortality that was preceded by acute body weight 
loss. To determine if IL-4 deficiency accounted for these findings, C57BL/6 
IL-4(+/+) and IL-4(-/-) mice were fed either a normal or modified diet. IL-4 
deficiency did not alter bile composition or cause liver toxicity in mice fed a 
fat-enriched diet. Following 8 weeks of feeding a fat-enriched diet, no 
gallstones were detected in IL-4(+/+) mice, and only 20% had cholesterol 
crystals. In contrast, IL-4(-/-) mice had a 100% incidence of gallstones and 
cholesterol crystals. IL-4(-/-) deficiency also increased serum concentrations 
of bilirubin following feeding a fat-enriched diet. Therefore, these studies 
revealed an unexpected finding that IL-4 deficiency predisposes to gallstone 
formation.
