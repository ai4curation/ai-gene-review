A protein expressed in immune cells and muscle was detected in muscle extracts 
as a substrate for several SAPKs (stress-activated protein kinases). It 
interacted specifically with the F-actin capping protein CapZ in splenocytes, 
and was therefore termed 'CapZIP' (CapZ-interacting protein). Human CapZIP was 
phosphorylated at Ser-179 and Ser-244 by MAPKAP-K2 (mitogen-activated protein 
kinase-activated protein kinase 2) or MAPKAP-K3 in vitro. Anisomycin induced the 
phosphorylation of CapZIP at Ser-179 in Jurkat cells, which was prevented by SB 
203580, consistent with phosphorylation by MAPKAP-K2 and/or MAPKAP-K3. However, 
osmotic shock-induced phosphorylation of Ser-179 was unaffected by SB 203580. 
These and other results suggest that CapZIP is phosphorylated at Ser-179 in 
cells by MAPKAP-K2/MAPKAP-K3, and at least one other protein kinase. 
Stress-activated MAP kinase family members phosphorylated human CapZIP at many 
sites, including Ser-68, Ser-83, Ser-108 and Ser-216. Ser-108 became 
phosphorylated when Jurkat cells were exposed to osmotic shock, which was 
unaffected by SB 203580 and/or PD 184352, or in splenocytes from mice that do 
not express either SAPK3/p38gamma or SAPK4/p38delta. Our results suggest that 
CapZIP may be phosphorylated by JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), which 
phosphorylates CapZIP to >5 mol/mol within minutes in vitro. Osmotic shock or 
anisomycin triggered the dissociation of CapZIP from CapZ in Jurkat cells, 
suggesting that phosphorylation of CapZIP may regulate the ability of CapZ to 
remodel actin filament assembly in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

Identifying the physiological substrates of the 500-plus protein kinases encoded by the human genome is one of the major challenges in the post-genomic era, and powerful methodologies will be needed to tackle this problem effectively. A few years ago we introduced a new biochemical approach for the identification of protein kinase substrates, termed KESTREL (for K inas e S ubstrate Tr acking and El ucidation), and exploited it to identify eEF2K (eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase) as a likely physiological target for SAPK4 (stress-activated protein kinase 4, also called p38δ) [ 1 ]. More recently, KESTREL has been used successfully to identify novel physiological substrates for several other protein kinases, including SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1) [ 2 ], PKB (protein kinase B) [ 3 , 4 ] and GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) [ 5 ]. In the present study, we have exploited KESTREL to identify a protein that is targeted by several SAPKs in vivo .

Exposing cells to cellular stresses, such as heat shock, osmotic shock or the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, triggers the activation of several MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases), including SAPK2a (also called p38α MAPK), SAPK2b/p38β, SAPK3/p38γ, SAPK4/p38δ, JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1) and JNK2 (reviewed in [ 6 ]). The physiological roles of SAPK2a/p38α include the activation of other protein kinases, such as MAPKAP-K2 (MAPK-activated protein kinase 2) and MAPKAP-K3, MSK1 (mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1) and MSK2, and MNK1 (MAPK-integrating kinase 1) and MNK2 (reviewed in [ 7 ]). MAPKAP-K5 [also called PRAK (p38-regulated, activated kinase)] was originally identified as a protein kinase activated by SAPK2/p38α in vitro [ 8 ], but recent work has established that it is phosphorylated and activated in vivo by ERK3 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-3) [ 9 , 10 ], a distinct MAPK family member which does not appear to be activated by cellular stresses.

Identification of the physiological substrates of SAPK2a/p38α has been greatly facilitated by the availability of relatively specific inhibitors of this protein kinase, most notably SB 203580 [ 11 ]. This compound also inhibits SAPK2b/p38β, but not SAPK3/p38γ, SAPK4/p38δ or other MAPK family members [ 12 ]. However, the lack of potent and specific inhibitors for SAPK3/p38γ and SAPK4/p38δ has hampered progress in understanding the physiological roles of these enzymes.

The results presented in the present paper started as three separate projects, aimed at using KESTREL to identify new physiological substrates for MAPKAP-K2, SAPK3/p38γ and SAPK4/p38δ in skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, one of the most prominent substrates we detected in skeletal-muscle extracts with all three protein kinases turned out to be the same protein. Here, we identify this protein and demonstrate that it interacts specifically with CapZ, an actin-capping protein. We have therefore termed this substrate ‘CapZIP’ (CapZ-interacting protein). Cellular stresses trigger the dissociation of CapZIP from CapZ, suggesting that CapZIP phosphorylation may modulate the ability of CapZ to remodel actin filaments.

DISCUSSION

In the present paper we have identified CapZIP as a protein that is phosphorylated exceptionally rapidly by several SAPKs in vitro ( Figure 4 ), and which is expressed in muscles and immune cells. Both MAPKAP-K2 and MAPKAP-K3 phosphorylated CapZIP at Ser-179 in vitro , and this residue became phosphorylated when cells were exposed to several of the cellular stresses that induce the activation of these protein kinases ( Figures 5 A and 5 B). The anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of CapZIP at Ser-179 was prevented by SB 203580 in Jurkat cells, consistent with phosphorylation of this residue being catalysed by MAPKAP-K2/K3, but the HOS-induced phosphorylation of Ser-179 was not. Thus an additional protein kinase(s) is clearly involved in mediating Ser-179 phosphorylation by this stimulus that is independent of the SAPK2/p38 pathway. Interestingly, CapZIP also became phosphorylated when skeletal muscle was made to contract by stimulating it electrically ( Figure 5 C). At the frequency of electrical stimulation employed, the phosphorylation of CapZIP at Ser-179 reached a maximum level after approx. 30 s, a time at which MAPKAP-K2 is not yet activated [ 13 ], again pointing to the involvement of another protein kinase, perhaps a CaMK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase). MAPKAP-K2/K3 belong to the same protein kinase subfamily as the CaMKs, and CaMKII and MAPKAP-K2 are known to phosphorylate similar motifs when synthetic peptides are used as substrates, as shown previously [ 17 ]. HOS is known to elevate the intracellular concentration of calcium ions [ 24 ], raising the possibility that a CaMK phosphorylates Ser-179 in response to this stimulus.

CapZIP was also found to be a remarkably good substrate for several stress-activated MAPKs in vitro and, indeed, is far and away the best substrate for JNK that has so far been identified. MAPKs phosphorylate Ser/Thr-Pro sequences, 17 of which are present in human CapZIP, 11 being conserved in the mouse protein ( Figure 3 ). There are also four Ser/Thr-Pro sequences in the C-terminal region of mouse CapZIP that are not conserved in human CapZIP. We have shown that at least four Ser-Pro sequences, conserved in human and murine CapZIP, can be phosphorylated by stress-activated MAPKs in vitro . So far, we have only examined the phosphorylation of one of these residues in cells, namely Ser-108. This residue became phosphorylated when Jurkat cells or primary splenocytes were exposed to HOS ( Figure 6 A). The phosphorylation of this residue was not prevented by SB 203580 and/or PD 184352, demonstrating that SAPK2a/p38α, SAPK2b/p38β, ERK1 and ERK2 are not rate-limiting for the phosphorylation of this residue under these conditions. HOS also induced a similar phosphorylation of Ser-108 in primary splenocytes from wild-type mice or mice that do not express SAPK3/p38γ or SAPK4/p38δ ( Figure 6 B). Thus, although we originally identified CapZIP as a protein in muscle extracts that is phosphorylated rapidly by SAPK3/p38γ or SAPK4/p38δ, these protein kinases are dispensable for the HOS-induced phosphorylation of Ser-108 in splenocytes. The protein kinase(s) that phosphorylate Ser-108 in response to HOS remain to be identified, but JNK isoforms are likely candidates, since CapZIP is such a good substrate for this protein kinase in vitro . However, the stress-activated MAPKs that phosphorylate Ser-108 may well vary with cell type and/or the type of stress to which they are exposed. For example, SAPK3/p38γ is expressed at extremely high levels in muscle, and might play a more important role in phosphorylating CapZIP in this tissue. Moreover, as CapZIP is likely to be phosphorylated at multiple Ser/Thr-Pro sequences in cells, different MAPKs may be involved in phosphorylating distinct residues.

An important clue to the function of CapZIP and its phosphorylation came from the finding that it binds to the actin-capping protein CapZ ( Figure 7 A), and that cellular stresses trigger the dissociation of these two proteins ( Figure 7 B). CapZ is a heterodimer composed of two subunits CapZα and CapZβ [ 25 , 26 ]. It is thought to regulate actin filament assembly and organization by binding to the barbed ends of the filaments. Here it works as a ‘cap’, preventing the addition and/or the loss of actin monomers at the ends, and can therefore reduce the length of actin filaments. One could therefore envisage that the interaction between CapZIP and CapZ affects the ability of the latter to remodel actin filaments. Such an effect is presumably lost when CapZIP is phosphorylated and dissociates from CapZ.

Although much further work is clearly needed to determine how CapZIP modulates the function of CapZ in the immune cells and muscles where it is expressed, it is intriguing that CapZIP is yet another example of an actin-binding protein that is a physiological substrate for MAPKAP-K2. For example MAPKAP-K2 phosphorylates HSP27 [ 20 – 22 ], a protein also known to act as an actin Cap-binding protein in vitro [ 27 ]. When phosphorylated, HSP27 contributes to enhanced actin polymerization and reorganization in vivo , a process thought to be involved in protecting the cytoskeleton from stress-induced damage, thereby aiding cell survival [ 28 ]. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that the amount of HSP27 and CapZ associated with actin increased and decreased, respectively, when smooth muscle from the saphenous vein was exposed to haemodynamic stress [ 29 ]. These changes would favour the generation of contractile stress fibres. An intriguing possibility is that these effects are both mediated by MAPKAP-K2 via the phosphorylation of HSP27 and CapZIP respectively. MAPKAP-K2 is also implicated in regulating another actin-dependent process, namely the chemotactic migration of cells to sites of inflammation. This appears to involve the phosphorylation of further MAPKAP-K2 substrates, such as LSP1 (lymphocyte-specific protein 1) [ 30 , 31 ] and NOGO-B (S. Rousseau, M. Peggie, D. G. Campbell, A. Nebreda and P. Cohen, unpublished work), but the possibility that CapZIP is also involved in this process merits investigation.

Finally, we note that the present study has again illustrated the power of the KESTREL method to identify interesting new physiological substrates of protein kinases.
