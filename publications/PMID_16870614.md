The serotonin transporter (SERT) belongs to the SLC6 family of sodium- and 
chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporters responsible for uptake of amino 
acids and biogenic amines from extracellular spaces. Their activities and 
subcellular distributions are regulated by various cellular mechanisms, 
including interactions with other proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid approach 
we screened a human brain cDNA library and identified secretory carrier membrane 
protein 2 (SCAMP2) as a novel SERT-interacting protein. GST-pulldown assays 
confirmed the physical interaction between SCAMP2 and the N-terminal domain of 
SERT. In addition, SERT was found to form a complex with SCAMP2 as demonstrated 
by co-immunoprecipitation from a heterologous expression system and from rat 
brain homogenate. Co-expression of SERT and SCAMP2 in mammalian cells results in 
the subcellular redistribution of SERT with a decrease in cell surface SERT and 
a concomitant reduction in 5-HT uptake activity. Using confocal microscopy we 
show that in neuronal cells endogenous SERT co-localizes with SCAMP2 in discrete 
structures also containing the lipid raft marker flotillin-1 and the SNARE 
protein syntaxin 1A. In contrast, SERT immunoreactivity is clearly segregated 
from transferrin receptor-containing endosomes. A single amino acid mutation, 
cysteine-201 to alanine, within the conserved cytoplasmic E peptide of SCAMP2, 
abolished SCAMP2-mediated down-regulation of SERT, although this mutation had no 
effect on the physical interaction between SERT and SCAMP2. Taken together, our 
results suggest that SCAMP2 plays an important role in the regulation of the 
subcellular distribution of SERT.
