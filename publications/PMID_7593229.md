The balance of serine proteases and inhibitors in nerve and muscle is altered 
during programmed- and injury-induced remodeling. A serpin, alpha 
1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1-ACT), and Kunitz-inhibitor containing forms of the 
beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) may be important components of this 
balance. In the present study, we analyzed their expression in primary cultures 
of human myogenic (satellite) cells that mimic myogenic differentiation using 
Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. In vitro results were compared to in 
vivo results from normal adult human skeletal muscle biopsies. Using an 
anti-alpha 1-ACT polyclonal antibody, we detected a 62 kDa immunoreactive band 
both in cultured human myogenic cells (mononucleated myoblasts as well as 
multi-nucleated myotubes) and in extracts of human muscle biopsies. With a 
polyclonal anti-beta APP antibody we found two bands (105 and 120 kDa) in 
myoblasts and myotubes in culture. However, the same antibody recognized only a 
single band at 92 kDa in biopsies. By immunocytochemistry, both alpha 1-ACT and 
beta APP were indistinctly present on localized to the surface of myoblasts in 
culture. In contrast, these inhibitors were dense on myotube surfaces, where 
they often formed distinct aggregates and frequently co-localized. In 
permeabilized muscle cells, alpha 1-ACT and beta APP appeared to be localized to 
the perikarya of both myoblasts and myotubes. Confirming previous results, both 
alpha 1-ACT and beta APP were present at the neuromuscular junction in human 
muscle sections. These developmental changes found during in vitro myogenesis 
for alpha 1-ACT and beta APP, both serine protease inhibitors, reinforce the 
hypothesis that regulation of the serine proteases and serine protease 
inhibitors plays an important role in neuromuscular differentiation.
