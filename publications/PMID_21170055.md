We isolated the postsynaptic density from human neocortex (hPSD) and identified 
1,461 proteins. hPSD mutations cause 133 neurological and psychiatric diseases 
and were enriched in cognitive, affective and motor phenotypes underpinned by 
sets of genes. Strong protein sequence conservation in mammalian lineages, 
particularly in hub proteins, indicates conserved function and organization in 
primate and rodent models. The hPSD is an important structure for nervous system 
disease and behavior.
