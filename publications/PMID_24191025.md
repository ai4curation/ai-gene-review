The bypass of DNA lesions by the replication fork requires a switch between the 
replicative DNA polymerase (Pol) and a more specialized translesion synthesis 
(TLS) Pol to overcome the obstacle. DNA Pol δ-interacting protein 2 (PolDIP2) 
has been found to physically interact with Pol η, Pol ζ, and Rev1, suggesting a 
possible role of PolDIP2 in the TLS reaction. However, the consequences of 
PolDIP2 interaction on the properties of TLS Pols remain unknown. Here, we 
analyzed the effects of PolDIP2 on normal and TLS by five different human 
specialized Pols from three families: Pol δ (family B), Pol η and Pol ι (family 
Y), and Pol λ and Pol β (family X). Our results show that PolDIP2 also 
physically interacts with Pol λ, which is involved in the correct bypass of 
8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-G) lesions. This interaction increases both the 
processivity and catalytic efficiency of the error-free bypass of a 8-oxo-G 
lesion by both Pols η and λ, but not by Pols β or ι. Additionally, we provide 
evidence that PolDIP2 stimulates Pol δ without affecting its fidelity, 
facilitating the switch from Pol δ to Pol λ during 8-oxo-G TLS. PolDIP2 
stimulates Pols λ and η mediated bypass of other common DNA lesions, such as 
abasic sites and cyclobutane thymine dimers. Finally, PolDIP2 silencing 
increases cell sensitivity to oxidative stress and its effect is further 
potentiated in a Pol λ deficient background, suggesting that PolDIP2 is an 
important mediator for TLS.
