The SIR2, SIR3, and SIR4 silent information regulator proteins are involved in 
the assembly of silent chromatin domains in the budding yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Using a series of biochemical experiments, we have studied 
protein-protein interactions involving these proteins. We found that yeast 
extracts contained a SIR2/SIR4 complex that was associated with little or no 
SIR3. However, truncations of the N-terminal two-thirds of the SIR4 protein 
allowed it to efficiently associate with SIR3, suggesting that the N-terminal 
domain of SIR4 inhibited its interaction with SIR3. We propose that the SIR3 and 
SIR4 proteins interact only during the assembly of the SIR protein complex at 
the silencer and that an early step in assembly unmasks the SIR4 protein to 
allow its association with SIR3. To test whether the interactions observed in 
yeast extracts were direct, we tested these SIR-SIR interactions using 
bacterially expressed SIR proteins. We observed direct interactions between SIR4 
and SIR2, SIR4 and SIR3, SIR2 and SIR3, SIR2 and SIR2, and SIR4 and SIR4, 
indicating that the associations observed in yeast extracts were direct.
