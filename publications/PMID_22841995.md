Shigella boydii causes bacillary dysentery or shigellosis and generates a 
significant burden in the developing nations. S. boydii-mediated infection 
assays were performed at both physiological and molecular levels using 
Caenorhabditis elegans as a host. Continuous exposure of worms to S. boydii 
showed a reduced life span indicating the pathogenicity of Shigella. 
Quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis was performed to analyze the expression and 
regulation of host specific candidate-antimicrobial genes (clec-60, clec-87, 
lys-7), which were expressed significantly during early infection, but weakened 
during the latter hours. Increased mortality of mutant RB1285 by S. boydii and 
Shigella flexneri indicated the role of lys-7 during Shigella infection. 
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) database was used to analyze the interaction 
of immune proteins in both C. elegans and humans. In addition, the expression 
and regulation were revealed about immune genes (clec-61, clec-62, clec-63, 
F54D5.3 and ZK1320.2), which encode several intermediate immune protein partners 
(CLEC-61, CLEC-62, CLEC-63, F54D5.3, ZK1320.2, W03D2.6 and THN-2) that interact 
with LYS-7 and CLEC-60 and were found to play a role in C. elegans immune 
defense against S. boydii infections. Similarly, the immune genes that are 
specific to the human defense system, which encode IGHV4-39, A2M, LTF, and 
CD79A, were predicted to be expressed with LYZ and MBL2, thus indicating their 
regulation during Shigella infections. Our results using the lowest eukaryotic 
model system and human database indicated that the major players involved in 
immunity-related processes appear to be common in cases of Shigella sp. mediated 
immune responses. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 
Computational Methods for Protein Interaction and Structural Prediction.
