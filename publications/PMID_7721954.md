Withangulatin A (WA), a newly discovered withanolide isolated from an antitumor 
Chinese herb, has been shown to be a vimentin intermediate filament-targeting 
drug by using immunofluorescence microscopy. Together with cytochalasin D and 
colchicine, these drugs were employed to investigate the importance of vimentin 
intermediate filaments, actin filaments, and microtubules in the development of 
acquired thermotolerance in 9L rat brain tumor cells treated at 45 degrees C for 
15 min (priming heat-shock). Acquired thermotolerance was abrogated in cells 
incubated with WA before the priming heat-shock but it could be detected in 
cells treated with WA after the priming heat-shock. In contrast, cytochalasin D 
and colchicine do not interfere with the development of thermotolerance at all. 
The intracellular localizations of vimentin and the constitutive heat-shock 
protein70 (HSC70) in treated cells were examined by using immunofluorescence 
microscopy and detergent-extractability studies. In cells treated with WA before 
the priming heat-shock, vimentin IFs were tightly aggregated around the nucleus 
and unable to return to their normal organization after a recovery under normal 
growing conditions. In contrast, the IF network in cells treated with WA after 
the priming heat-shock was able to reorganize into filamentous form after a 
recovery period, a behavior similar to that of the cells treated with heat-shock 
only. HSC70 was found to be co-localized with vimentin during these changes. It 
is suggested that the integrity of intermediate filaments is important for the 
development of thermotolerance and that HSC70 may be involved in this process by 
stabilizing the intermediate filaments through direct or indirect binding.
