Memory is essential for our normal daily lives and our sense of self. Ca(2+) 
influx through the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) and the ensuing 
activation of the Ca(2+) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) are 
required for memory formation and its physiological correlate, long-term 
potentiation (LTP). The Ca(2+) influx induces CaMKII binding to the NMDAR to 
strategically recruit CaMKII to synapses that are undergoing potentiation. We 
generated mice with two point mutations that impair CaMKII binding to the NMDAR 
GluN2B subunit. Ca(2+)-triggered postsynaptic accumulation is largely abrogated 
for CaMKII and destabilized for TARPs, which anchor AMPA-type glutamate 
receptors (AMPAR). LTP is reduced by 50% and phosphorylation of the AMPAR GluA1 
subunit by CaMKII, which enhances AMPAR conductance, impaired. The mutant mice 
learn the Morris water maze (MWM) as well as WT but show deficiency in recall 
during the period of early memory consolidation. Accordingly, the 
activity-driven interaction of CaMKII with the NMDAR is important for recall of 
MWM memory as early as 24 h, but not 1-2 h, after training potentially due to 
impaired consolidation.
