Platelet activation is associated with an increase of cytosolic Ca(++) levels. 
The (1,4,5)IP(3) receptors [(1,4,5)IP(3)R] are known to mediate Ca(++) release 
from intracellular stores of many cell types. Currently there are at least 3 
distinct subtypes of (1,4, 5)IP(3)R-type I, type II, and type III-with 
suggestions of distinct roles in Ca(++) elevation. Specific receptors for 
(1,3,4,5)IP(4) belonging to the GAP1 family have also been described though 
their involvement with Ca(++) regulation is controversial. In this study we 
report that platelets contain all 3 subtypes of (1,4,5)IP(3)R but in different 
amounts. Type I and type II receptors are predominant. In studies using highly 
purified platelet plasma (PM) and intracellular membranes (IM) we report a 
distinct localization of these receptors. The PM fractions were found to contain 
the type III (1,4,5)IP(3)R and GAP1(IP4BP) in contrast to IM, which contained 
type I (1,4,5)IP(3)R. The type II receptor exhibited a dual distribution. In 
studies examining the labeling of surface proteins with biotin in intact 
platelets only the type III (1,4,5)IP(3)R was significantly labeled. Immunogold 
studies of ultracryosections of human platelets showed significantly more 
labeling of the PM with the type III receptor antibodies than with type I 
receptor antibodies. Ca(++) flux studies were carried out with the PM to 
demonstrate in vitro function of inositol phosphate receptors. Ca(++) release 
activities were present with both (1,4,5)IP(3) and (1, 3,4,5)IP(4) (EC(50) = 1.3 
and 0.8 micromol/L, respectively). Discrimination of the Ca(++)-releasing 
activities was demonstrated with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent 
protein kinase (cAMP-PK) specifically inhibiting (1,4,5)IP(3) but not (1,3,4, 
5)IP(4)-induced Ca(++) flux. In experiments with both PM and intact platelets, 
the (1,4,5)IP(3)Rs but not GAP1(IP4BP) were found to be substrates of cAMP-PK 
and cGMP-PK. Thus the Ca(++) flux property of (1,3,4,5)IP(4) is insensitive to 
cAMP-PK. These studies suggest distinct roles for the (1,4,5)IP(3)R subtypes in 
Ca(++) movements, with the type III receptor and GAP1(IP4BP) associated with 
cation entry in human platelets and the type I receptor involved with Ca(++) 
release from intracellular stores.
