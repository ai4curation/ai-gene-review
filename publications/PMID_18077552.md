As part of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) 
machinery, Tsg101 is essential for endosomal sorting, membrane receptor 
degradation and the final stages of cytokinesis. Depletion or overproduction of 
the protein can cause disruption of these vital processes and results in severe 
consequences for the cell. Tsg101 expression is thus controlled 
posttranslationally within a narrow range and this autoregulation has been 
mapped to the C-terminus of the protein. Here we elucidate further the 
mechanisms of this regulation and describe a novel function of Tsg101-associated 
ligase (Tal) in mediating this control. We show that Tal polyubiquitinates 
lysine residues in the C-terminus of uncomplexed Tsg101, resulting in 
proteasomal degradation. However, accessibility to these lysines is prevented by 
the presence of the other ESCRT-I proteins. We show that VPS28 is a limiting 
factor, and consequently Tsg101 expression surplus to ESCRT-I function is 
vulnerable to degradation. The role of Tal in the regulation of Tsg101 
steady-state control is highlighted when Tsg101 is overexpressed; however, our 
data also suggest that additional ligases regulate Tsg101 expression under 
normal conditions. Lastly, we demonstrate that while the C-terminal lysines are 
targets for polyubiquitination, they are not required for any additional 
function necessary for ESCRT activity.
