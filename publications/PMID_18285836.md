A number of germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 gene confer susceptibility to 
breast and ovarian cancer. However, it remains difficult to determine whether 
many single amino-acid (missense) changes in the BRCA1 protein that are 
frequently detected in the clinical setting are pathologic or not. Here, we used 
a combination of functional, crystallographic, biophysical, molecular and 
evolutionary techniques, and classical genetic segregation analysis to 
demonstrate that the BRCA1 missense variant M1775K is pathogenic. Functional 
assays in yeast and mammalian cells showed that the BRCA1 BRCT domains carrying 
the amino-acid change M1775K displayed markedly reduced transcriptional 
activity, indicating that this variant represents a deleterious mutation. 
Importantly, the M1775K mutation disrupted the phosphopeptide-binding pocket of 
the BRCA1 BRCT domains, thereby inhibiting the BRCA1 interaction with the 
proteins BRIP1 and CtIP, which are involved in DNA damage-induced checkpoint 
control. These results indicate that the integrity of the BRCT 
phosphopeptide-binding pocket is critical for the tumor suppression function of 
BRCA1. Moreover, this study demonstrates that multiple lines of evidence 
obtained from a combination of functional, structural, molecular and 
evolutionary techniques, and classical genetic segregation analysis are required 
to confirm the pathogenicity of rare variants of disease-susceptibility genes 
and obtain important insights into the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.
