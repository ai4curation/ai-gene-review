Caspases, the cysteine proteases that execute apoptosis, are tightly regulated 
via phosphorylation by a series of kinases. Although all apoptotic caspases work 
in concert to promote apoptosis, different kinases regulate individual caspases. 
Several sites of caspase-7 phosphorylation have been reported, but without 
knowing the molecular details, it has been impossible to exploit or control 
these complex interactions, which normally prevent unwanted proliferation. 
During dysregulation, PAK2 kinase plays an alternative anti-apoptotic role, 
phosphorylating caspase-7 and promoting unfettered cell growth and 
chemotherapeutic resistance. PAK2 phosphorylates caspase-7 at two sites, 
inhibiting activity using two different molecular mechanisms, before and during 
apoptosis. Phosphorylation of caspase-7 S30 allosterically obstructs its 
interaction with caspase-9, preventing intersubunit linker processing, slowing 
or preventing caspase-7 activation. S239 phosphorylation renders active 
caspase-7 incapable of binding substrate, blocking later events in apoptosis. 
Each of these mechanisms is novel, representing new opportunities for 
synergistic control of caspases and their counterpart kinases.
