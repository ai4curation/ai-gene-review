Expression of the src homology 3 (SH3)-encoding, expressed in tumorigenic 
astrocytes (SETA) gene is associated with astrocyte transformation in culture 
and tumors in the adult brain. SETA binds to the apoptosis regulator 
apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2) interacting protein 1 (AIP1), and modulates 
apoptosis in astrocytes. The predicted protein structure of SETA revealed two 
SH3 domains, while related proteins were reported to have three. Here we report 
the identification of an additional SH3 domain N-terminal to the previously 
identified SETA sequence. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a p53(-/-) astrocyte 
cDNA library with this SH3 domain identified a novel gene, SETA binding protein 
1 (SB1), with 55% amino acid identity to the renal tumor antigen, NY-REN-45. In 
vitro confrontation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the binding 
of SB1 to SETA. Evidence that SETA binds to the CD2 protein, the proto-oncogene 
c-Cbl, and the signal transduction molecule Grb2, and can dimerize via its 
C-terminal coiled coil (CC) domain is also presented.
