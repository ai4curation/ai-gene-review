Interactions between proteins and material or cellular surfaces are able to 
trigger protein aggregation in vitro and in vivo. The human insulin peptide 
segment LVEALYL is able to accelerate insulin aggregation in the presence of 
hydrophobic surfaces. We show that this peptide needs to be previously adsorbed 
on a hydrophobic surface to induce insulin aggregation. Moreover, the study of 
different mutant peptides proves that its sequence is less important than the 
secondary structure of the adsorbed peptide on the surface. Indeed, these 
pro-aggregative peptides act by providing stable β-sheets to incoming insulin 
molecules, thereby accelerating insulin adsorption locally and facilitating the 
conformational changes required for insulin aggregation. Conversely, a peptide 
known to form α-helices on hydrophobic surfaces delays insulin aggregation.
