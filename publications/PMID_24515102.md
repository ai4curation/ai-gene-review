The hexa-coordinate heme in the H2S-generating human enzyme cystathionine 
β-synthase (CBS) acts as a redox-sensitive regulator that impairs CBS activity 
upon binding of NO(•) or CO at the reduced iron. Despite the proposed 
physiological relevance of this inhibitory mechanism, unlike CO, NO(•) was 
reported to bind at the CBS heme with very low affinity (Kd = 30-281 μm). This 
discrepancy was herein reconciled by investigating the NO(•) reactivity of 
recombinant human CBS by static and stopped-flow UV-visible absorption 
spectroscopy. We found that NO(•) binds tightly to the ferrous CBS heme, with an 
apparent Kd ≤ 0.23 μm. In line with this result, at 25 °C, NO(•) binds quickly 
to CBS (k on ∼ 8 × 10(3) m(-1) s(-1)) and dissociates slowly from the enzyme (k 
off ∼ 0.003 s(-1)). The observed rate constants for NO(•) binding were found to 
be linearly dependent on [NO(•)] up to ∼ 800 μm NO(•), and >100-fold higher than 
those measured for CO, indicating that the reaction is not limited by the slow 
dissociation of Cys-52 from the heme iron, as reported for CO. For the first 
time the heme of human CBS is reported to bind NO(•) quickly and tightly, 
providing a mechanistic basis for the in vivo regulation of the enzyme by NO(•). 
The novel findings reported here shed new light on CBS regulation by NO(•) and 
its possible (patho)physiological relevance, enforcing the growing evidence for 
an interplay among the gasotransmitters NO(•), CO, and H2S in cell signaling.
