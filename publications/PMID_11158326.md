In a previous study, we found that the SHIP2 protein became tyrosine 
phosphorylated and associated with the Shc adapter protein in response to the 
treatment of cells with growth factors and insulin (T. Habib, J. A. Hejna, R. E. 
Moses, and S. J. Decker, J. Biol. Chem. 273:18605-18609, 1998). We describe here 
a novel interaction between SHIP2 and the p130(Cas) adapter protein, a mediator 
of actin cytoskeleton organization. SHIP2 and p130(Cas) association was detected 
in anti-SHIP2 immunoprecipitates from several cell types. Reattachment of 
trypsinized cells stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP2 and increased the 
formation of a complex containing SHIP2 and a faster-migrating 
tyrosine-phosphorylated form of p130(Cas). The faster-migrating form of 
p130(Cas) was no longer recognized by antibodies to the amino terminus of 
p130(Cas) and appeared to be generated through proteolysis. Interaction of the 
SHIP2 protein with the various forms of p130(Cas) was mediated primarily through 
the SH2 domain of SHIP2. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that SHIP2 
localized to focal contacts and to lamellipodia. Increased adhesion was observed 
in HeLa cells transiently expressing exogenous WT-SHIP2. These effects were not 
seen with SHIP2 possessing a mutation in the SH2 domain (R47G). Transfection of 
a catalytic domain deletion mutant of SHIP2 (DeltaRV) inhibited cell spreading. 
Taken together, our studies suggest an important role for SHIP2 in adhesion and 
spreading.
