The nucleolus is a subnuclear compartment and the site of ribosome biogenesis. 
Previous studies have implicated protein ubiquitylation in nucleolar activity. 
Here we show that USP36, a deubiquitylating enzyme of unknown function, 
regulates nucleolar activity in mammalian cells. USP36 localized to nucleoli via 
the C-terminal region, which contains basic amino acid stretches. 
Dominant-negative inhibition of USP36 caused the accumulation of 
ubiquitin-protein conjugates in nucleoli, suggesting that nucleoli are the site 
of USP36 action. USP36 deubiquitylated the nucleolar proteins nucleophosmin/B23 
and fibrillarin, and stabilized them by counteracting ubiquitylation-mediated 
proteasomal degradation. RNAi-mediated depletion of cellular USP36 resulted in 
reduced levels of rRNA transcription and processing, a less-developed nucleolar 
morphology and a slight reduction in the cytoplasmic ribosome level, which 
eventually led to a reduced rate of cell proliferation. We conclude that by 
deubiquitylating various nucleolar substrate proteins including 
nucleophosmin/B23 and fibrillarin, USP36 plays a crucial role in regulating the 
structure and function of nucleoli.
