Interactions between members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
family mediates cellular responses to ligand stimulation. Measurement of these 
interactions could provide important information and may prove useful as 
prognostic markers in malignancy. Therefore, to develop methods to study these 
interactions in genetically unmodified cells, such as clinical samples, in a 
sensitive and selective way, with good statistical accuracy, is important. The 
in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA) was used to quantify homo- and 
heteromeric interactions between EGFR and HER2 in cultured cells, using flow 
cytometry as the readout method. Cells were monitored for changes in 
dimerization patterns and phosphorylation status upon stimulation. The different 
cell lines displayed varying amounts of interactions between EGFR and HER2, but 
the amount of dimerization was not found to be affected significantly upon 
stimulation by EGF. Activation of EGFR could be visualized by in situ PLA, but 
not by immunofluorescence staining. In situ PLA was successfully used to study 
receptor dimerization and activation of the EGF-receptor family with high 
selectivity and sensitivity. The combination of in situ PLA and flow cytometry 
provided a statistically powerful way of analyzing protein-protein interactions 
and post-translational modifications on a single-cell basis.
