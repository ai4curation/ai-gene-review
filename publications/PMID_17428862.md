The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7a protein, which 
is not expressed by other known coronaviruses, can induce apoptosis in various 
cell lines. In this study, we show that the overexpression of Bcl-XL, a 
prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 family, blocks 7a-induced apoptosis, suggesting 
that the mechanism for apoptosis induction by 7a is at the level of or upstream 
from the Bcl-2 family. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that 7a 
interacts with Bcl-XL and other prosurvival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and 
A1) but not with the proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bid). A good 
correlation between the abilities of 7a deletion mutants to induce apoptosis and 
to interact with Bcl-XL was observed, suggesting that 7a triggers apoptosis by 
interfering directly with the prosurvival function of Bcl-XL. Interestingly, 
amino acids 224 and 225 within the C-terminal transmembrane domain of Bcl-XL are 
essential for the interaction with the 7a protein, although the BH3 domain of 
Bcl-XL also contributes to this interaction. In addition, fractionation 
experiments showed that 7a colocalized with Bcl-XL at the endoplasmic reticulum 
as well as the mitochondria, suggesting that they may form complexes in 
different membranous compartments.
