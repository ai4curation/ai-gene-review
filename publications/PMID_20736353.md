The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an important and 
abundant protein in eukaryotic cells, essential for the activation of a large 
set of signal transduction and regulatory proteins. During the functional cycle, 
the Hsp90 dimer performs large conformational rearrangements. The transient 
N-terminal dimerization of Hsp90 has been extensively investigated, under the 
assumption that the C-terminal interface is stably dimerized. Using a 
fluorescence-based single molecule assay and Hsp90 dimers caged in lipid 
vesicles, we were able to separately observe and kinetically analyze N- and 
C-terminal dimerizations. Surprisingly, the C-terminal dimer opens and closes 
with fast kinetics. The occupancy of the unexpected C-terminal open conformation 
can be modulated by nucleotides bound to the N-terminal domain and by N-terminal 
deletion mutations, clearly showing a communication between the two terminal 
domains. Moreover our findings suggest that the C- and N-terminal dimerizations 
are anticorrelated. This changes our view on the conformational cycle of Hsp90 
and shows the interaction of two dimerization domains.
