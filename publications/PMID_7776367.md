Hsp70 chaperons interact with protein substrates in an ATP-dependent manner to 
prevent aggregation and promote protein folding. For the Escherichia coli 
homolog DnaK, we have characterized the ATP hydrolysis cycle as well as the 
effects of the DnaJ and GrpE cofactors on substrate interaction to reach 
conclusions on the functional cycle. DnaK ATPase was stimulated by substrates 
(ninefold) and DnaJ (13-fold) through stimulation of the rate limiting step, 
gamma-phosphate cleavage (approximately tenfold slower than ADP release). 
Substrates stimulate ATPase after binding with high affinity (KA < 10 microM) to 
preformed DnaK-ATP complexes. The rapid binding kinetics lead to the conclusion 
that ATP-bound DnaK is the primary form initiating interaction with substrates 
for chaperone activity. The resulting DnaK-ATP-substrate complexes, however, are 
also characterized by rapid dissociation of bound substrate, but can be 
stabilized by hydrolysis of ATP (stimulated either by the substrate itself or 
DnaJ through their effects on the rate-limiting step). Stimulation of the 
gamma-phosphate cleavage reaction by DnaJ is much more efficient (complete 
conversion of bound ATP to ADP within five seconds) than that by substrates, 
indicating the special and important role for DnaJ in stabilization of 
DnaK-substrate interactions.
