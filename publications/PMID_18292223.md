BIG1, a brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein, activates 
class I ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF1-3) by catalyzing the replacement of bound 
GDP by GTP, an action critical for the regulation of protein transport in 
eukaryotic cells. Our earlier report [Padilla PI, Pancheco-Rodriguez G, Moss J, 
Vaughan M (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:2752-2757] that BIG1 concentrated in 
nucleoli of serum-starved HepG2 cells prompted us to identify molecules 
associated with BIG1 in dynamic nucleolar structures. Antibodies against BIG1 or 
nucleolin coprecipitated both proteins from nuclei, which was abolished by the 
incubation of nuclei with RNase A or DNase, indicating that the interaction 
depended on nucleic acids. (32)P labeling of RNAs immunoprecipitated with BIG1 
or nucleolin from nuclei revealed bands of approximately 210 bases that also 
hybridized with U3 small nucleolar (sno)RNA-specific oligonucleotides. Clones of 
U3 snoRNA cDNAs from the material precipitated by antibodies against BIG1 or 
nucleolin yielded identical nucleotide sequences that also were found in genomic 
DNA. Later analyses revealed the presence of fibrillarin, nucleoporin p62, and 
La in BIG1 and nucleolin immunoprecipitates. Our data demonstrate that BIG1, 
nucleolin, U3, the U3-binding protein fibrillarin, and the RNA-binding protein 
La may exist together in nuclear complexes, consistent with a potential role for 
BIG1 in nucleolar processes. Evidence that BIG1 and nucleolin, but not 
fibrillarin, can be present with p62 at the nuclear envelope confirms the 
presence of BIG1 and nucleolin in dynamic molecular complexes that change in 
composition while moving through nuclei. Nuclear functions of BIG1 remain to be 
determined.
