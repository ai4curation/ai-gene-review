Many groups of proteins play important roles in the cell's response to various 
stresses. The molecular chaperone GroEL of Escherichia coli represents one such 
highly conserved family of stress proteins. We have observed that isolated GroEL 
complexes from stationary cultures contain various polypeptides that can be 
released from the chaperonin by GroES and/or ATP, and identified two such 
polypeptides as the proteins GatY and UP12. Whereas GatY had been isolated 
previously, as an in vivo substrate of GroEL, the isolation of UP12 in a complex 
with GroEL was intriguing, because based on sequence similarity it was suggested 
that UP12 might also be a functional stress protein. UP12 belongs to a family of 
universal stress proteins (UspA family), of which UspA itself, and three 
additional paralogues, have been characterized previously. Here we show that 
UP12 accumulates under various growth inhibitory conditions and induced by heat 
shock. Furthermore, unlike wild-type cells, a UP12 deletion mutant recovers 
slowly from late stationary growth conditions, and has a marked sensitivity to 
the toxic agent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP). Finally, 
coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the initial observation that UP12 
interacts with GroEL. Therefore, we suggest that UP12 may function as a 
universal stress protein, interaction of which with GroEL possibly ensures its 
proper folding state.
