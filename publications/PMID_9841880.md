Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GLCL) catalyses the rate-limiting step in glutathione 
biosynthesis. To identify cysteine residues in GLCL that are involved in its 
activity, eight conserved cysteine residues in human GLCL catalytic subunit 
(hGLCLC) were replaced with glycine residues by PCR-based site-directed 
mutagenesis. Both recombinant hGLCLC and hGLCL holoenzyme were expressed and 
purified with a baculovirus expression system. The activity of purified hGLCL 
holoenzyme with the mutant hGLCLC-C553G was 110+/-12 micromol/h per mg of 
protein compared with 370+/-20 micromol/h per mg of protein for the wild-type. 
Holoenzymes with hGLCLC-C52G, -C248G, -C249G, -C295G, -C491G, -C501G or -C605G 
showed activities similar to the wild type. The Km values of hGLCL containing 
hGLCLC-C553G were slightly lower than those of the wild type, indicating that 
the replacement of cysteine-553 with Gly in hGLCLC did not significantly affect 
substrate binding by the enzyme. hGLCLC-C553G was more easily dissociated from 
hGLCLR than the wild-type hGLCLC. GLCL activity increased by 11% after 
hGLCLC-C553G was incubated with an equimolar amount of purified hGLCL regulatory 
subunit (hGLCLR) at room temperature for 30 min, but increased by 110% after 
wild-type hGLCLC was incubated with hGLCLR for 10 min. These results indicate 
that cysteine-553 in hGLCLC is involved in heterodimer formation between hGLCLC 
and hGLCLR.
