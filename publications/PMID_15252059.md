The folding and assembly of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and 
membrane are monitored by ER quality control. Misfolded or unassembled proteins 
are retained in the ER and, if they cannot fold or assemble correctly, 
ultimately undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mediated by the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system. Whereas luminal and integral membrane ERAD 
substrates both require the proteasome for their degradation, the ER quality 
control machinery for these two classes of proteins likely differs because of 
their distinct topologies. Here we establish the requirements for the ERAD of 
Ste6p*, a multispanning membrane protein with a cytosolic mutation, and compare 
them with those for mutant form of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY*), a soluble luminal 
protein. We show that turnover of Ste6p* is dependent on the ubiquitin-protein 
isopeptide ligase Doa10p and is largely independent of the ubiquitin-protein 
isopeptide ligase Hrd1p/Der3p, whereas the opposite is true for CPY*. 
Furthermore, the cytosolic Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1p and the Hsp40 co-chaperones 
Ydj1p and Hlj1p are important in ERAD of Ste6p*, whereas the ER luminal 
chaperone Kar2p is dispensable, again opposite their roles in CPY* turnover. 
Finally, degradation of Ste6p*, unlike CPY*, does not appear to require the 
Sec61p translocon pore but, like CPY*, could depend on the Sec61p homologue 
Ssh1p. The ERAD pathways for Ste6p* and CPY* converge at a post-ubiquitination, 
pre-proteasome step, as both require the ATPase Cdc48p. Our results demonstrate 
that ERAD of Ste6p* employs distinct machinery from that of the soluble luminal 
substrate CPY* and that Ste6p* is a valuable model substrate to dissect the 
cellular machinery required for the ERAD of multispanning membrane proteins with 
a cytosolic mutation.
