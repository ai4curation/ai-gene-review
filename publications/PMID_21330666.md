PURPOSE: Autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB) is a retinal dystrophy 
affecting macular and retinal pigmented epithelium function resulting from 
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in BEST1. In this study we 
characterize the functional implications of missense bestrophin-1 mutations that 
cause ARB by investigating their effect on bestrophin-1's chloride conductance, 
cellular localization, and stability.
METHODS: The chloride conductance of wild-type bestropin-1 and a series of ARB 
mutants were determined by whole-cell patch-clamping of transiently transfected 
HEK cells. The effect of ARB mutations on the cellular localization of 
bestrophin-1 was determined by confocal immunofluorescence on transiently 
transfected MDCK II cells that had been polarized on Transwell filters. Protein 
stability of wild-type and ARB mutant forms of bestrophin-l was determined by 
the addition of proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors to transiently transfected 
MDCK II cells. Lysates were then analyzed by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: All ARB mutants investigated produced significantly smaller chloride 
currents compared to wild-type bestrophin-1. Additionally, co-transfection of 
compound heterozygous mutants abolished chloride conductance in contrast to 
co-transfections of a single mutant with wild-type bestrophin-l, reflecting the 
recessive nature of the condition. In control experiments, expression of two 
dominant vitelliform macular dystrophy mutants was shown to inhibit wild-type 
currents. Cellular localization of ARB mutants demonstrated that the majority 
did not traffic correctly to the plasma membrane and that five of these seven 
mutants were rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Two ARB-associated mutants 
(p.D312N and p.V317M) that were not trafficked correctly nor targeted to the 
proteasome had a distinctive appearance, possibly indicative of aggresome or 
aggresome-like inclusion bodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in cellular processing mechanisms for different ARB 
associated mutants lead to the same disease phenotype. The existence of distinct 
pathogenic disease mechanisms has important ramifications for potential gene 
replacement therapies since we show that missense mutations associated with an 
autosomal recessive disease have a pathogenic influence beyond simple loss of 
function.
