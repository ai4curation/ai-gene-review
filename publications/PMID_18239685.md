TAX1BP1 are born normal, but develop age-dependent inflammatory cardiac 
valvulitis, die prematurely, and are hypersensitive to low doses of TNF-alpha

Abstract

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a key mediator of inflammation. Unchecked NF-κB signalling can engender autoimmune pathologies and cancers. Here, we show that Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) is a negative regulator of TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation and that binding to mono- and polyubiquitin by a ubiquitin-binding Zn finger domain in TAX1BP1 is needed for TRAF6 association and NF-κB inhibition. Mice genetically knocked out for TAX1BP1 are born normal, but develop age-dependent inflammatory cardiac valvulitis, die prematurely, and are hypersensitive to low doses of TNF-α and IL-1β. TAX1BP1 −/− cells are more highly activated for NF-κB than control cells when stimulated with TNF-α or IL-1β. Mechanistically, TAX1BP1 acts in NF-κB signalling as an essential adaptor between A20 and its targets.

Introduction

Chronic inflammation is frequently mediated via the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway ( Beg et al , 1995 ; Schulze-Osthoff et al , 1997 ; Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000 ; Greten, 2004 ; Karin, 2006 ). The NF-κB family encompasses five members, NF-κB 1 (p105/p50), NF-κB 2 (p100/p52), RelA (p65), RelB, and cRel ( Pomerantz and Baltimore, 2002 ), which are sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes with inhibitors of kappa B (IκB) proteins ( Pomerantz and Baltimore, 2002 ). Cytoplasmic NF-κB complexes can be activated by a variety of stimuli, including viral and bacterial pathogens, cytokines, and stress-inducing agents ( Karin and Lin, 2002 ; Pomerantz and Baltimore, 2002 ). Recent studies have characterized ubiquitination as a mechanism for NF-κB activation ( Chen, 2005 ; Haglund and Dikic, 2005 ). Hence, TNF-α and IL-1β stimulation of cells is followed by K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF2 ( Shi and Kehrl, 2003 ), RIP1 ( Legler et al , 2003 ; Lee et al , 2004 ), and TRAF6 ( Wang, 2001 ; Dunne and O'Neill, 2003 ). K63 ubiquitination does not trigger proteasome-dependent degradation, but rather creates a docking site on TRAF/RIP1 for downstream NF-κB signalling proteins ( Wullaert et al , 2006 ) ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Conversely, de-ubiquitination of signalling proteins serves a negative regulatory mechanism. Thus, de-ubiquitinases A20 and CYLD have been reported to de-ubiquitinate specific substrates, including TRAF6 and RIP1 ( Boone, 2004 ; Evans et al , 2004 ; Jono et al , 2004 ; Wertz et al , 2004b ), to downmodulate signalling events.

Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1; also known as TXBP151 or T6BP) was originally identified as a molecule that binds the human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 Tax oncoprotein ( Chin et al , 2007 ). Tax is a potent NF-κB activator, and it efficiently immortalizes mammalian peripheral blood lymphocytes ex vivo ( Yoshida, 2001 ; Matsuoka, 2005 ; Matsuoka and Jeang, 2007 ). Previous studies have shown that TAX1BP1 binds the NF-κB inhibitory protein A20 ( De Valck et al , 1999 ), and in an IL-1β-specific manner the NF-κB signalling protein TRAF6 ( Ling and Goeddel, 2000 ). These findings suggest that TAX1BP1 plays a regulatory role in NF-κB activation.

To understand better the physiological function of TAX1BP1, we created TAX1BP1 knockout (KO) mice. TAX1BP1-deficient mice are born developmentally normal; however, TAX1BP1 −/− animals develop age-dependent inflammatory cardiac valvulitis and skin dermatitis, die prematurely, and are hypersensitive to low doses of TNF-α and IL-1β. Cultured TAX1BP1 −/− cells exposed to TNF-α or IL-1β activate NF-κB more robustly than TAX1BP1 +/+ cells. Furthermore, TAX1BP1 inhibits RIP1 and TRAF6 polyubiquitination and recruits the ubiquitin-editing protein A20 to these molecules. Finally, we characterized a novel ubiquitin-binding domain in TAX1BP1, which is needed for the interaction of TAX1BP1 with TRAF6. Our findings support TAX1BP1 as an essential adaptor for linking A20 to TRAF6 and other factors in order to influence NF-κB activation.

Discussion

Worldwide, chronic rheumatic heart disease is estimated to affect 5–30 million children and young adults, and 90 000 patients die from this disease each year ( WHO, 2004 ). Valve pathology is the most common finding in inflammatory heart disease ( Rullan and Sigal, 2001 ). To date, approximately four million valve operations have been performed globally on patients of all ages, with about 300 000 procedures performed annually in the United States. As yet, a full understanding of the molecular basis for valvulitis and an animal model for this pathology are wanting.

Here, we report a model of cardiac valvulitis characterized by age-dependent morbid valve disease and intractable skin inflammation in TAX1BP1 −/− mice. TAX1BP1 −/− mice show inflammation-induced valve changes that resemble the valve disease in human rheumatic fever ( Roberts et al , 2001 ; Rullan and Sigal, 2001 ) with infiltrations of T cells and macrophages in the cardiac valves and myocardium of TAX1BP1-deficient mice. TAX1BP1 −/− mice also display skin inflammation, and skin tissues are infiltrated with T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages.

TAX1BP1 is an 86 kDa protein that was previously shown to bind the NF-κB inhibitory protein A20 ( De Valck et al , 1999 ) and the NF-κB signalling molecule TRAF6 ( Ling and Goeddel, 2000 ). Our current study shows that TAX1BP1 is a novel ubiquitin-binding protein that negatively modulates IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB signalling. While signalling through IL-1β and TNF-α is critical for host defences against pathogens ( Dinarello, 2004 ; Kollias, 2005 ), unchecked signalling can have catastrophic consequences ( Liew et al , 2005 ). Accordingly, a major in vivo consequence of loss of TAX1BP1 function in moderating inflammatory signalling is illustrated by fatal hypersensitivities experienced by TAX1BP1 −/− mice when dosed with amounts of TNF-α and IL-1β that are otherwise innocuous to WT mice.

Our current results implicate TAX1BP1 as an adapter that recruits A20 to TRAF6 and/or RIP1. A result of this recruitment is a reduction in polyubiquitinated TRAF6 and RIP1. Polyubiquitination of TRAF6 and RIP1 has been reported to be involved in their interaction with the adaptor proteins NEMO and TAB2 ( Kanayama, 2004 ; Wu et al , 2006 ), which are essential for downstream NF-κB signalling. Ubiquitin binding to NEMO and TAB2 is facilitated by specific ubiquitin-binding motifs. Similarly, we delineated a novel ubiquitin-binding motif in TAX1BP1 that is essential for its binding to A20 and TRAF6, and its ability to downmodulate TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation. A20 has previously been shown to negatively regulate NF-κB activation by de-ubiquitinating TRAF6 and RIP1. Our data indicate a role for polyubiquitination of TRAF6 and RIP in the binding of TAX1BP1, which recruits the de-ubiquitinating protein A20. The latter might then de-ubiquitinate TRAF6 and RIP1, thus terminating NF-κB signalling. However, we cannot exclude an alternative mechanism in which TAX1BP1+A20 interfere with the growth of the ubiquitin chain on TRAF6. As both TRAF6 and A20 seem to bind the same UBZ2 domain of TAX1BP1, one can question how two molecules can bind simultaneously to the same region in TAX1BP1. We have found that TAX1BP1 can form homodimers (data not shown), and we propose that TAX1BP1 functions as a dimer with one molecule binding A20 and the other binding TRAF6. This would also explain the dominant-negative effect of overexpression of a TAX1BP1 UBZ2 mutant that we observed. The identification of TAX1BP1 as a ubiquitin-dependent negative regulator of NF-κB signalling expands the versatility of ubiquitin binding as a mechanism for regulating both positive and negative signalling ( Haglund and Dikic, 2005 ). Interestingly, TAX1BP1 provides a means for pathway-specific regulation since we demonstrated that TAX1BP1 is a negative regulator of NF-κB but not JNK signalling. The underlying mechanistic basis for this specificity remains to be clarified. It can be speculated that TAX1BP1 also recruits A20 to other polyubiquitinated proteins. In this context, it is worth mentioning that TAX1BP1 has previously been shown to mediate the anti-apoptotic activities of A20 in TNF signalling ( De Valck et al , 1999 ). It will therefore be interesting to identify specific ubiquitinated targets for TAX1BP1 and A20 in the TNF cell death signalling pathway.

The phenotype of TAX1BP1 KO mice is largely different from the phenotype of A20 KO mice, which succumb shortly after birth due to strong inflammation in different organs. Moreover, the strong cardiac pathology of TAX1BP1-deficient mice is peculiar in view of the critical function of NF-κB in the normal physiology of different organs. One reason for the more tissue-restricted phenotype of TAX1BP1-deficient mice might be the redundancy with other A20 adaptor proteins. In this context, A20 has been shown to bind three different ABIN family members, which have been suggested to be involved in the NF-κB inhibitory function of A20 ( Heyninck and Beyaert, 1999 ; Van Huffel et al , 2001 ; Wullaert et al , 2007 ). Moreover, ABIN-1 was recently shown to facilitate the binding of A20 to NEMO and to be essential for NEMO de-ubiquitination by A20 ( Mauro et al , 2006 ). Interestingly, we recently demonstrated the presence of a novel ubiquitin-binding motif in ABINs that is essential for their NF-κB inhibitory function (Wagner et al , submitted for publication). Speculatively, ABINs may fulfil a similar bridging function between A20 and its specific ubiquitinated targets as shown here for TAX1BP1.

After our study was completed, we noted the publication of a paper by Shembade et al (2007) , who reported on an alternate approach to generate homozygous TAX1BP1-deficient mice. There are significant technical and scientific differences between our work and Shembade et al (2007) . First, Shembade et al employed a random viral insertion strategy to ‘knock out' the TAX1BP1 gene. In this strategy, a viral vector is inserted into ES cells to trap upstream exons, resulting in a fused mRNA that directs the expression of a fusion protein comprised of the sequences encoded in the trapped exons, an antibiotic (neomycin) gene, and a colorimetric marker (β-galactosidase). This approach does not produce a ‘cleanly' targeted KO but rather creates a mutant genotype (i.e. termed m/m by Shembade et al ) that expresses an artefactual protein–antibiotic marker–galactosidase fusion moiety that could produce phenotype(s) not simply due to loss of gene function. Second, the above technical nuance could be biologically confounding because Shembade et al 's TAX1BP1m/m mouse is embryonic lethal while our TAX1BP1 −/− mouse is born alive. Third, unlike TAX1BP1 −/− MEFs, Shembade et al 's m/m cells are not viable for propagation unless first transformed with SV40 large T antigen. A T antigen transformation event can produce cryptic secondary changes in m/m cells, which complicate biochemical analyses. This may explain why Shembade et al found that TAX1BP1 is critical to both NF-κB and JNK signalling, while our results restrict TAX1BP1 to only NF-κB and exclude its involvement in JNK signalling. Other differences between the studies could arise from different genetic backgrounds in the mice; nevertheless, on balance, our results agree with Shembade et al that TAX1BP1 is a novel adaptor protein that recruits A20 to cognate substrate(s).

In conclusion, in vivo loss of TAX1BP1 engenders A20-dependent hyperinflammation through NF-κB dysregulation. While NF-κB is likely important to all tissues and cells, the observation that TAX1BP1 −/− mice that expire prematurely exhibit serious cardiac valvulitis suggests a hitherto unexplored importance of NF-κB signalling to the normal physiology of valve leaflets. This suggestion will need to be investigated further. However, TAX1BP1 −/− mice could provide a candidate inflammatory cardiac valvulitis animal model that could be useful for checking whether drugs that specifically interrupt NF-κB activity ( May et al , 2000 ) can be used to treat rheumatic heart disease.
