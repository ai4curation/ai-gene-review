We have isolated the Arabidopsis heat shock factor gene Athsf1 as genomic and 
corresponding cDNA sequences via cross-hybridization with tomato clones. 
Sequence analysis indicates only a partial homology with the HSFs from tomato 
and other organisms which is confined to the DNA-binding and the oligomerization 
domains. The gene is constitutively expressed but the level of mRNA for Athsf1 
increases two-fold upon heat shock. However, the putative promoter region lacks 
the canonical heat shock elements. After expression in Escherichia coli the 
recombinant Athsf1 protein binds specifically to a synthetic oligonucleotide 
containing five heat shock elements. The native size of recombinant ATHSF1 in 
vitro is consistent with a trimer as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking and 
pore exclusion limit analysis.
