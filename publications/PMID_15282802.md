The localization of proteins can give important clues about their function and 
help sort data from large-scale proteomic screens. Forty-five proteins were 
tagged with the GFP variant YFP. These proteins were chosen because they are 
encoded by genes that display strong cell cycle-dependent expression that peaks 
in G(1). Most of these proteins localize to either the nucleus or to sites of 
cell growth. We are able to assign new cellular component GO terms to ASF2, 
TOS4, RTT109, YBR070C, YKR090W, YOL007C, YOL019W and YPR174C. We also have 
localization data for 21 other proteins. Noteworthy localizations were found for 
Rfa1p, a member of the DNA replication A complex, and Pri2p and Pol12p, subunits 
of the alpha-DNA polymerase : primase complex. In addition to its nuclear 
localization, Rfa1p assembled into cytoplasmic foci adjacent to the nucleus in 
cells during the G(1)-S phase transition of the cell cycle. Pri2 and Pol12 took 
on a beaded appearance at the G(1)-S transition and later in the cell cycle were 
enriched in the nuclear envelope. A new spindle pole body/nuclear envelope 
component encoded by YPR174 was identified. The cell cycle-dependent abundance 
of Tos4p mirrored Yox1p and these two proteins were the only proteins that were 
found exclusively at the G(1)-S phase of the cell cycle. A complete list of 
localizations, along with images, can be found at our website
