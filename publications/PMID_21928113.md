Phytochrome Interacting Factor 1 (PIF1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 
protein, functions as a negative regulator of various facets of 
photomorphogenesis. To indentify PIF1-interacting proteins, we performed yeast 
two-hybrid screening using PIF1 as a bait and identified a group of proteins 
including PIF1 itself, PIF3 and long hypocotyl in far-red 1 (HFR1), an atypical 
HLH protein. Directed yeast two-hybrid interaction assays showed that PIF1 can 
form heterodimers with all other PIFs as well as with HFR1. PIF1 and PIF3 
interacted with each other in both in vitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation 
assays. PIF1-PIF3 heterodimer also bound to a G-box DNA sequence element in 
vitro. To understand the biological significance of these interactions, a 
pif1pif3 double mutant was obtained and characterized. Analyses of the single 
and double mutants showed that PIF3 plays a prominent role in repressing 
photomorphogenesis under continuous blue light conditions. pif1 and pif3 showed 
additive phenotypes more prominently under discontinuous blue light conditions. 
Similar to PIF1, PIF3 was also rapidly phosphorylated, poly-ubiquitylated and 
degraded in response to blue light. PIF3 also interacted with phytochromes in 
response to blue light. A PIF3 mutant defective in interaction with both phyA 
and phyB displayed reduced degradation under blue light, suggesting that 
phy-interaction was necessary for the blue light-induced degradation of PIF3. 
Taken together, these data suggest a combinatorial control of photomorphogenesis 
by bHLH proteins in response to light in Arabidopsis.
