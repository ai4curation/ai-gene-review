RINT-1 was first identified as a Rad50-interacting protein that participates in 
radiation-induced G2/M checkpoint control. We have recently reported that 
RINT-1, together with the dynamitin-interacting protein ZW10 and others, is 
associated with syntaxin 18, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized SNARE 
involved in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi. To address the role 
of RINT-1 in membrane trafficking, we examined the effects of overexpression and 
knockdown of RINT-1 on Golgi morphology and protein transport from the ER. 
Overexpression of the N-terminal region of RINT-1, which is responsible for the 
interaction with ZW10, caused redistribution of ZW10. Concomitantly, ER-to-Golgi 
transport was blocked and the Golgi was dispersed. Knockdown of RINT-1 also 
disrupted membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi. Notably, silencing of 
RINT-1 resulted in a reduction in the amount of ZW10 associated with syntaxin 
18, concomitant with ZW10 redistribution. In contrast, no redistribution or 
release of RINT-1 from the syntaxin 18 complex was observed when ZW10 expression 
was reduced. These results taken together suggest that RINT-1 coordinates the 
localization and function of ZW10 by serving as a link between ZW10 and the 
SNARE complex comprising syntaxin 18.
