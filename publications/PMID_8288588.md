The thrombospondins (TSPs) are a growing family of cell surface and 
extracellular matrix molecules composed of multiple repeating elements. 
Thrombospondin 3 is a recently described member that possesses the calcium 
binding Type 3 repeats, has 4 epidermal growth factor receptor-like Type 2 
repeats, a complete absence of the complement-like Type 1 repeats, and a 
distinct N terminus that has no significant homology to the other TSPs. 
Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation analysis of cells transfected with a 
TSP3 expression vector revealed it to be an oligomeric heparin binding protein 
present in both the cell layer and medium. Finally, a combination of in situ 
hybridization and immunocytochemistry demonstrated TSP3 to be expressed in a 
temporal and spatial manner during murine embryogenesis, especially in the gut, 
cartilage, lung, and central nervous system.
