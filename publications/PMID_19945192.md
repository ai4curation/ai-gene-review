Class A heat shock factors (Hsfs) of Arabidopsis are known to function as 
transcriptional activators of stress genes. Genetic and functional analysis 
suggests that HsfA1a and HsfA1b are central regulators required in the early 
phase of the heat shock response, which have the capacity to functionally 
replace each other. In order to examine Hsf interaction in vivo, we conducted 
interaction assays using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) on 
Arabidopsis protoplasts co-transformed with suitable Hsf-YFP fusion genes. BiFC 
assays were quantified with confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow 
cytometry, and confirmed with immunoprecipitation assays. For each Hsf we could 
not only demonstrate homomeric interactions but also detect heteromeric 
interaction between HsfA1a and HsfA1b. Truncated versions of these of Hsfs, 
containing deletions of the oligomerization domains (ODs), provided clear 
evidence that the ODs are required and sufficient for the HSF interaction in 
vivo. By contrast there was only homomeric but no heteromeric interaction 
detected between two different class B Hsf transcription factors (HsfB1 and 
HsfB2b) in a yeast two-hybrid assay. HsfB1/HsfB2b functions are not directly 
linked with the expression of conventional heat shock genes; class B Hsfs are 
devoid of the activation domain motif conserved in class A Hsfs. In order to 
identify other proteins interacting with HsfB1 and HsfB2b we performed yeast 
two-hybrid screenings of cDNA libraries. Three of the identified proteins were 
common to both screenings. This suggests that HsfB1 and HsfB2b may be involved 
in complex regulatory networks, which are linked to other stress responses and 
signaling processes.
