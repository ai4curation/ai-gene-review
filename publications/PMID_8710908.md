High molecular weight kininogen (HK) and factor XII are known to bind to human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a zinc-dependent and saturable 
manner indicating that HUVEC express specific binding site(s) for those 
proteins. However, identification and immunochemical characterization of the 
putative receptor site(s) has not been previously accomplished. In this report, 
we have identified a cell surface glycoprotein that is a likely candidate for 
the HK binding site on HUVECs. When solubilized HUVEC membranes were subjected 
to an HK-affinity column in the presence or absence of 50 microM ZnCl2 and the 
bound membrane proteins eluted, a single major protein peak was obtained only in 
the presence of zinc. SDS/PAGE analysis and silver staining of the protein peak 
revealed this protein to be 33 kDa and partial sequence analysis matched the NH2 
terminus of gC1q-R, a membrane glycoprotein that binds to the globular "heads" 
of C1q. Two other minor proteins of approximately 70 kDa and 45 kDa were also 
obtained. Upon analysis by Western blotting, the 33-kDa band was found to react 
with several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing different epitopes on 
gC1q-R. Ligand and dot blot analyses revealed zinc-dependent binding of 
biotinylated HK as well as biotinylated factor XII to the isolated 33-kDa HUVEC 
molecule as well as recombinant gC1q-R. In addition, binding of 125I-HK to HUVEC 
cells was inhibited by selected monoclonal anti-gC1q-R antibodies. C1q, however, 
did not inhibit 125I-HK binding to HUVEC nor did those monoclonals known to 
inhibit C1q binding to gC1q-R. Taken together, the data suggest that HK (and 
factor XII) bind to HUVECs via a 33-kDa cell surface glycoprotein that appears 
to be identical to gC1q-R but interact with a site on gC1q-R distinct from that 
which binds C1q.
