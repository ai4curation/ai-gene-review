The Snf-2-related CREB-binding protein activator protein (SRCAP) serves as a 
coactivator for a number of transcription factors known to interact with CBP. 
Swr1, the closest Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of SRCAP, is a component of 
the chromatin remodeling complex SWR-C, which catalyzes exchange of the histone 
variant H2A.Z into nucleosomes. In this report, we use a combination of 
conventional chromatography and anti-SRCAP immunoaffinity chromatography to 
purify a native human SRCAP complex with a polypeptide composition similar to 
that of SWR-C, and we show for the first time that this SRCAP-containing complex 
supports ATP-dependent exchange of histone dimers containing H2B and H2A.Z into 
mononucleosomes reconstituted with recombinant H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Our 
findings, together with previous evidence implicating H2A.Z in transcriptional 
regulation, suggest that SRCAP's coactivator function may depend on its ability 
to promote incorporation of H2A.Z into chromatin.
