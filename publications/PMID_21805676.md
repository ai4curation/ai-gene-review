PURPOSE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of severe 
respiratory tract infection in infants. The aim was to identify host defence 
components in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) from infants with RSV infection and 
to study the expression of the novel 25 kDa innate immunity protein SPLUNC1.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: NPAs from infants were analyzed with 2-DE and MS in a pilot 
study. The levels of SPLUNC1 were analyzed with immunoblotting in 47 NPAs, 
admitted for RSV diagnosis.
RESULTS: Totally, 35 proteins were identified in NPA, including several innate 
immunity proteins such as group X phospholipase A(2) , different S100 proteins 
and SPLUNC1. In addition, a new truncated 15 kDa form of SPLUNC1 was identified 
that was detected in about 50% of the aspirates admitted for RSV diagnosis. 
RSV-positive boys had significantly less 25 kDa SPLUNC1 than RSV-negative boys 
while there were no significant differences among girls.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Several important innate immunity proteins 
were identified in NPA. Notably, a new truncated form of the newly suggested 
anti-bacterial protein SPLUNC1 was found. It is possible that a decrease in 
SPLUNC1 in the upper airways may increase the risk for severe pneumonia in boys.
