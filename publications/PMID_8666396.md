A new member of the insulin gene superfamily was identified by screening a 
subtracted cDNA library of first-trimester human placenta and, hence, was 
tentatively named early placenta insulin-like peptide (EPIL). In this paper, we 
report the cloning and sequencing of the EPIL cDNA and the EPIL gene (INSL4). 
Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the early placenta insulin-like 
peptide revealed significant overall and structural homologies with members of 
the insulin-like hormone superfamily. Moreover, the organization of the early 
placenta insulin-like gene, which is composed of two exons and one intron, is 
similar to that of insulin and relaxin. By in situ hybridization, the INSL4 gene 
was assigned to band p24 of the short arm of chromosome 9. RT-PCR analysis of 
EPIL tissue distribution revealed that its transcripts are expressed in the 
placenta and uterus.
