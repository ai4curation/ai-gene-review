The cytoplasmic deacetylase HDAC6 is an important regulator of cellular pathways 
that include response to stress, protein folding, microtubule stability, and 
cell migration, thus representing an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy. 
However, little is known about its upstream regulation. Our previous work has 
implicated HDAC6 as a new protein target for the farnesyltransferase inhibitors 
(FTIs), although HDAC6 lacks a farnesylation motif. Here we show that the 
protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) and HDAC6 are present in a protein complex 
together with microtubules in vivo and in vitro. FTase binds microtubules 
directly via its alpha subunit, and this association requires the C terminus of 
tubulin. Treatment with an FTI removed FTase, but not HDAC6, from the protein 
complex, suggesting that the active form of FTase is bound to microtubules. 
Importantly, the removal of FTase from microtubules abrogated HDAC6 activity, as 
did a stable knockdown of the alpha subunit of FTase (FTalphaKD). Interestingly, 
the FTalphaKD cells showed increased sensitivity to the antiproliferative 
effects of Taxol and the FTI lonafarnib when used either as single agents or in 
combination as compared with parental cells. Altogether, these data suggest that 
FTase, via its tubulin-association, is a critical upstream regulator of HDAC6 
activity and that FTase expression could help stratify cancer patients that 
would most benefit from this treatment.
