The ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of cyclin E plays a central role in 
cell-cycle progression, and cyclin E accumulation is a common event in cancer. 
Cyclin E degradation is triggered by multisite phosphorylation, which induces 
binding to the SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex. Structures of the Skp1-Fbw7 
complex bound to cyclin E peptides identify a doubly phosphorylated 
pThr380/pSer384 cyclin E motif as an optimal, high-affinity degron and a singly 
phosphorylated pThr62 motif as a low-affinity one. Biochemical data indicate 
that the closely related yeast SCF(Cdc4) complex recognizes the multisite 
phosphorylated Sic1 substrate similarly and identify three doubly phosphorylated 
Sic1 degrons, each capable of high-affinity interactions with two Cdc4 phosphate 
binding sites. A model that explains the role of multiple cyclin E/Sic1 degrons 
is provided by the findings that Fbw7 and Cdc4 dimerize, that Fbw7 dimerization 
enhances the turnover of a weakly associated cyclin E in vivo, and that Cdc4 
dimerization increases the rate and processivity of Sic1 ubiquitination in 
vitro.
