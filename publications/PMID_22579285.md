The molecular chaperone Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) promotes the maturation of 
several important proteins and plays a key role in development, cancer 
progression, and evolutionary diversification. By mapping chromatin-binding 
sites of Hsp90 at high resolution across the Drosophila genome, we uncover an 
unexpected mechanism by which Hsp90 orchestrates cellular physiology. It 
localizes near promoters of many coding and noncoding genes including microRNAs. 
Using computational and biochemical analyses, we find that Hsp90 maintains and 
optimizes RNA polymerase II pausing via stabilization of the negative elongation 
factor complex (NELF). Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to upregulation of target 
genes, and Hsp90 is required for maximal activation of paused genes in 
Drosophila and mammalian cells in response to environmental stimuli. Our 
findings add a molecular dimension to the chaperone's functionality with wide 
ramifications into its roles in health, disease, and evolution.
