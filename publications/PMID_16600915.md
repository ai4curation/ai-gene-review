Floral development at the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem occurs in response 
to environmental cues that are perceived in different tissues. Photoperiod is 
detected in the vascular tissue of the leaf (phloem) and promotes production of 
a systemic signal that induces flowering at the meristem. Vernalization, the 
response to winter temperatures, overcomes a block on photoperiodic floral 
induction. In Arabidopsis, this block is caused by inhibitors of flowering that 
comprise several related MADS-box transcription factors, the most prominent of 
which is FLC. We show that FLC delays flowering by repressing production in the 
leaf of at least two systemic signals, one of which is controlled by the RAF 
kinase inhibitor-like protein FT. Reducing expression of these signals 
indirectly represses expression of genes involved in floral induction at the 
meristem. In addition, FLC expression in the meristem impairs response to the FT 
signal by directly repressing expression of the SOC1 MADS-box transcription 
factor and preventing up-regulation of the bZIP transcription factor FD. 
Repression of genes acting at multiple levels in this hierarchy is required for 
the extreme delay in flowering caused by FLC. An FLC:HA fusion protein binds 
directly in vivo to the promoter regions of FD and SOC1 and to the first intron 
of FT. Thus vernalization relieves transcriptional repression of key regulatory 
genes in both the leaf and meristem, allowing production of systemic signals in 
the leaves and conferring competence on the meristem to respond to these 
signals.

Abstract

Floral development at the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem occurs in response to environmental cues that are perceived in different tissues. Photoperiod is detected in the vascular tissue of the leaf (phloem) and promotes production of a systemic signal that induces flowering at the meristem. Vernalization, the response to winter temperatures, overcomes a block on photoperiodic floral induction. In Arabidopsis , this block is caused by inhibitors of flowering that comprise several related MADS-box transcription factors, the most prominent of which is FLC. We show that FLC delays flowering by repressing production in the leaf of at least two systemic signals, one of which is controlled by the RAF kinase inhibitor-like protein FT. Reducing expression of these signals indirectly represses expression of genes involved in floral induction at the meristem. In addition, FLC expression in the meristem impairs response to the FT signal by directly repressing expression of the SOC1 MADS-box transcription factor and preventing up-regulation of the bZIP transcription factor FD. Repression of genes acting at multiple levels in this hierarchy is required for the extreme delay in flowering caused by FLC. An FLC:HA fusion protein binds directly in vivo to the promoter regions of FD and SOC1 and to the first intron of FT . Thus vernalization relieves transcriptional repression of key regulatory genes in both the leaf and meristem, allowing production of systemic signals in the leaves and conferring competence on the meristem to respond to these signals.

Discussion

We have shown that the vernalization response in Arabidopsis requires derepression of key regulatory genes in the leaf and meristem (Fig. 8 ). Prior to vernalization, repression of FT in the leaf by the FLC transcription factor prevents formation of a systemic signal and thereby indirectly delays expression of the flowering-time gene SOC1 at the meristem. FLC activity in the leaf also delays expression of FD at the meristem, and, based on the analysis of ft mutants, this occurs independently of the repression of FT expression by FLC. Activity of FLC specifically in the meristem did not affect FT expression in the leaf but reduced SOC1 mRNA levels and prevented the up-regulation of FD associated with flowering. Therefore activity of FLC in the meristem suppresses the response to the FT signal formed in the leaves by directly repressing SOC1 and FD , which encodes an FT-interacting protein. These data suggest that flowering is delayed prior to vernalization because FLC represses production of at least two systemic signals in the leaves, one that requires FT and a second that appears to be independent of FT, and impairs the competence of the meristem to flower in response to these signals through the repression of FD and SOC1 . The delays in flowering caused by FLC in the leaf and meristem are additive, so that expression of FLC in both tissues causes a much more severe delay in flowering. In winter-annual FRI FLC plants, vernalization reduces FLC expression in the young leaves and the meristem. We conclude that vernalization acts in Arabidopsis both to allow production of floral stimuli in the leaves and response to these stimuli in the meristem.
