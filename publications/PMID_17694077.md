Transcription in eukaryotes is a tightly regulated, multistep process. 
Gene-specific transcriptional activators, several different co-activators and 
general transcription factors are necessary to access specific loci to allow 
precise initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription. As the dense chromatin 
folding of the genome does not allow the access of these sites by the huge 
multiprotein transcription machinery, remodelling is required to loosen up the 
chromatin structure for successful transcription initiation. In the present 
review, we summarize the recent evolution of our understanding of the function 
of two histone acetyl transferases (ATs) from metazoan organisms: GCN5 and PCAF. 
Their overall structure and the multiprotein complexes in which they are 
carrying out their activities are discussed. Metazoan GCN5 and PCAF are subunits 
of at least two types of multiprotein complexes, one having a molecular weight 
of 2 MDa (SPT3-TAF9-GCN5 acetyl transferase/TATA binding protein (TBP)-free-TAF 
complex/PCAF complexes) and a second type with about a size of 700 kDa (ATAC 
complex). These complexes possess global histone acetylation activity and 
locus-specific co-activator functions together with AT activity on non-histone 
substrates. Thus, their biological functions cover a wide range of tasks and 
render them indispensable for the normal function of cells. That deregulation of 
the global and/or specific AT activities of these complexes leads to the 
cancerous transformation of the cells highlights their importance in cellular 
processes. The possible effects of GCN5 and PCAF in tumorigenesis are also 
discussed.
