Chaperonins are ring-shaped protein complexes that are essential in the cell, 
mediating ATP-dependent polypeptide folding in a variety of compartments. Recent 
studies suggest that they function through multiple rounds of binding and 
release of non-native proteins: with each round of ATP-driven release into the 
bulk solution, a substrate protein kinetically partitions between folding to the 
native state or rebinding to another chaperonin molecule. To gain further 
insight into the mechanism of polypeptide binding and release by the chaperonin 
GroEL from Escherichia coli, we have undertaken a mutational analysis that 
relates the functional properties of GroEL to its crystal structure. Our 
functional tests identify a putative polypeptide-binding site on the inside 
surface of the apical domain, facing the central channel, consisting of 
hydrophobic residues. These same residues are essential for binding of the 
co-chaperonin GroES, which is required for productive polypeptide release. A 
highly conserved residue, Asp 87, positioned within a putative 
nucleotide-binding pocket in the top of the equatorial domain, is essential for 
ATP hydrolysis and polypeptide release.
