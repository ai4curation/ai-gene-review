Cell division entails a sequence of processes whose specific demands for 
biosynthetic precursors and energy place dynamic requirements on metabolism. 
However, little is known about how metabolic fluxes are coordinated with the 
cell division cycle. Here, we examine budding yeast to show that more than half 
of all measured metabolites change significantly through the cell division 
cycle. Cell cycle-dependent changes in central carbon metabolism are controlled 
by the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1), a major cell cycle regulator, and the 
metabolic regulator protein kinase A. At the G1/S transition, Cdk1 
phosphorylates and activates the enzyme Nth1, which funnels the storage 
carbohydrate trehalose into central carbon metabolism. Trehalose utilization 
fuels anabolic processes required to reliably complete cell division. Thus, the 
cell cycle entrains carbon metabolism to fuel biosynthesis. Because the 
oscillation of Cdk activity is a conserved feature of the eukaryotic cell cycle, 
we anticipate its frequent use in dynamically regulating metabolism for 
efficient proliferation.

Cell division entails a sequence of processes whose specific demands for biosynthetic precursors and energy place dynamic requirements on metabolism. However, little is known about how metabolic fluxes are coordinated with the cell division cycle. Here, we examine budding yeast to show that over half of all measured metabolites change significantly through the cell division cycle. Cell cycle-dependent changes in central carbon metabolism are controlled by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1, a major cell cycle regulator, and the metabolic regulator protein kinase A. At the G1/S transition, Cdk1 phosphorylates and activates the enzyme Nth1, which funnels the storage carbohydrate trehalose into central carbon metabolism. Trehalose utilization fuels anabolic processes required to reliably complete cell division. Thus, the cell cycle entrains carbon metabolism to fuel biosynthesis. Since the oscillation of Cdk-activity is a conserved feature of the eukaryotic cell cycle, we anticipate its frequent use in dynamically regulating metabolism for efficient proliferation.
