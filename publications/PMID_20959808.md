The current mechanistic model of chaperonin-assisted protein folding assumes 
that the substrate protein in the cage, formed by GroEL central cavity capped 
with GroES, is isolated from outside and exists as a free polypeptide. However, 
using ATPase-deficient GroEL mutants that keep GroES bound, we found that, in 
the rate-limiting intermediate of a chaperonin reaction, the unfolded 
polypeptide in the cage partly protrudes through a narrow space near the 
GroEL/GroES interface. Then, the entire polypeptide is released either into the 
cage or to the outside medium. The former adopts a native structure very rapidly 
and the latter undergoes spontaneous folding. Partition of the in-cage folding 
and the escape varies among substrate proteins and is affected by hydrophobic 
interaction between the polypeptide and GroEL cavity wall. The ATPase-active 
GroEL with decreased in-cage folding produced less of a native model substrate 
protein in Escherichia coli cells. Thus, the polypeptide in the critical 
GroEL-GroES complex is neither free nor completely confined in the cage, but it 
is interacting with GroEL's apical region, partly protruding to outside.
