X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of 
the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that has been shown to be highly 
expressed in ectodermal derivatives during embryonic development and binds to 
ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable 
expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-kappaB and JNK 
pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the 
recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a 
central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. 
Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKalpha, IKK2/IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are 
involved in XEDAR-induced NF-kappaB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation 
seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion 
and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic 
domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, 
and play a major role in the activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Taken 
together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling 
and in the process of ectodermal differentiation.
