The Atg4 cysteine proteases are required for processing Atg8 for the latter to 
be conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagosomal membranes, a key 
step in autophagosome biogenesis. Notably, whereas there are only one atg4 and 
one atg8 gene in the yeast, the mammals have four Atg4 homologues and six Atg8 
homologues. The Atg8 homologues seem to play different roles in autophagosome 
biogenesis, and previous studies had indicated that they could be differentially 
processed by Atg4 homologues. The present study provided the first detailed 
kinetics analysis of all four Atg4 homologues against four representative Atg8 
homologues. The data indicated that Atg4B possessed the broadest spectrum 
against all substrates, followed by Atg4A, whereas Atg4C and Atg4D had minimal 
activities as did the catalytic mutant of Atg4B (C74S). On the other hand, 
GATE-16 seemed to be the overall best substrate for Atg4 proteases. The kinetics 
parameters of Atg4B were also affected by its structure and that of the 
substrates, indicating a process of induced fit. The determination of the 
kinetics parameters of the various Atg4-Atg8 pairs provides a base for the 
understanding of the potential selective impact of the reaction on autophagosome 
biogenesis.
