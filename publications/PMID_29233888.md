Abstract

Inherited disorders of oxidative phosphorylation cause the clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases known as mitochondrial energy generation disorders, or mitochondrial diseases. Over the last three decades, mutations causing these disorders have been identified in almost 290 genes, but many patients still remain without a molecular diagnosis. Moreover, while our knowledge of the genetic causes is continually expanding, our understanding into how these defects lead to cellular dysfunction and organ pathology is still incomplete. Here, we review recent developments in disease gene discovery, functional characterization, and shared pathogenic parameters influencing disease pathology that offer promising avenues toward the development of effective therapies.

Introduction

Mitochondrial energy generation disorders (hereafter termed mitochondrial diseases) are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders involving defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). 2 The OXPHOS system comprises five enzyme complexes, situated in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The first four complexes and two electron carriers form the respiratory chain, which generates a proton gradient used by complex V (F 1 F 0 -ATP synthase) to generate the majority of cellular ATP. For the purpose of this review, we have focused on genes and mechanisms that have a demonstrated defect in primary energy generation ( e.g. components of the OXPHOS system) or a clear expected role in mitochondrial homeostasis and the ability to generate energy ( e.g. components of the TCA cycle and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) that feed into OXPHOS, or those affecting mitochondrial membranes and structure).

Mitochondrial diseases are clinically diverse and can present at any age ( 1 ). They can manifest in a tissue-specific or a multisystemic manner, but most often they affect organs with the highest energy demands such as brain, skeletal muscle, eyes, and heart ( 2 ). Mitochondrial diseases can show any mode of inheritance: maternal; X-linked; autosomal recessive; autosomal dominant; and de novo . This is due to the dual involvement of both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in maintaining the mitochondrial proteome. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present in thousands of copies in most cells, which means the heteroplasmic load of a mutation can vary from 0 to 100% and may also differ between tissues in an individual. The threshold level above which the proportion of mutant mtDNA causes cellular dysfunction varies between mutations and tissues, further complicating the pathogenesis of mtDNA disease, as described in detail elsewhere ( 1 , 2 ).

Disorders of energy generation have a minimum birth prevalence of 1 in 5000 live births ( 3 , 4 ). Mutations in mtDNA appear to account for ∼75% of adult-onset disease ( 4 ) but only ∼25% of childhood-onset disease ( 5 , 6 ).

Conclusions and future directions

Investigations over the last 30 years have led to the identification of almost 290 genetic causes for disorders of mitochondrial energy generation, making these among the most genetically diverse group of inherited diseases. Since the widespread uptake of MPS technologies from 2012, there has been an average of 22 new disease genes identified each year. Challenges remain in detecting and interpreting pathogenic DNA variants, particularly in non-coding regions. Analytical approaches continue to evolve and are complemented by improvements in data sharing and comprehensive databases cataloguing population-based genetic variation ( 91 ), together with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses ( 37 , 92 , 93 ). It therefore seems likely that the current rate of gene discovery will continue for some years.

Whether they affect OXPHOS directly due to their primary function, or in a secondary manner that may also affect other cellular functions, categorizing these genes according to their functional roles emphasizes the wide array of cellular pathways that converge at OXPHOS biogenesis. In many cases, the roles can be ambiguous, as the proteins may have dual functions, alternative cellular localizations, or less clear roles in mitochondrial pathways. However, for some, their identification as a disease gene has aided in their functional characterization, resulting in new insights into mitochondrial and cellular pathways and disease pathology ( e.g. ATAD3A and SLC25A46 ). In others, it has led to a treatment, as in the case of biotin and thiamine supplementation in SLC19A3 mutations ( 94 ).

Although our understanding of the heterogeneity and pleiotropy of mitochondrial disorders is still incomplete, a number of parameters influencing disease pathology have been identified that span many of the gene classification categories and affect different facets of cell signaling. The last Cochrane review of mitochondrial therapy in 2012 concluded: “there is currently no clear evidence supporting the use of any intervention in mitochondrial disorders” ( 95 ). However, a series of preclinical studies have provided encouraging evidence supporting the use of small molecule therapies targeting cellular signaling pathways related to NAD bioavailability and mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and stress responses ( 96 , 97 ). Although for the vast majority of mitochondrial diseases there are currently no effective treatments or cures, the continued identification of disease genes, their mitochondrial and cellular functions, and their shared pathogenic parameters are leading to a greater understanding and an increasing number of clinical trials ( 2 ).
