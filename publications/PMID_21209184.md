Formation and stabilization of postsynaptic glycine receptor (GlyR) clusters 
result from their association with the polymerized scaffold protein gephyrin. At 
the cell surface, lateral diffusion and local trapping of GlyR by synaptic 
gephyrin clusters is one of the main factors controlling their number. However, 
the mechanisms regulating gephyrin/GlyR cluster sizes are not fully understood. 
To identify molecular binding partners able to control gephyrin cluster 
stability, we performed pull-down assays with full-length or truncated gephyrin 
forms incubated in a rat spinal cord extract, combined with mass spectrometric 
analysis. We found that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70), a constitutive 
member of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family, selectively binds to the 
gephyrin G-domain. Immunoelectron microscopy of mouse spinal cord sections 
showed that Hsc70 could be colocalized with gephyrin at inhibitory synapses. 
Furthermore, ternary Hsc70-gephyrin-GlyR coclusters were formed following 
transfection of COS-7 cells. Upon overexpression of Hsc70 in mouse spinal cord 
neurons, synaptic accumulation of gephyrin was significantly decreased, but GlyR 
amounts were unaffected. In the same way, Hsc70 inhibition increased gephyrin 
accumulation at inhibitory synapses without modifying GlyR clustering. Single 
particle tracking experiments revealed that the increase of gephyrin molecules 
reduced GlyR diffusion rates without altering GlyR residency at synapses. Our 
findings demonstrate that Hsc70 regulates gephyrin polymerization independently 
of its interaction with GlyR. Therefore, gephyrin polymerization and synaptic 
clustering of GlyR are uncoupled events.
