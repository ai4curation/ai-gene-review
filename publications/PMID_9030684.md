We have investigated the role of the mammalian Son of sevenless 1 (Sos1) protein 
in growth factor signaling in vivo by generating mice and cell lines that lacked 
the Sos1 protein. Homozygous null embryos were smaller than normal, died 
mid-gestation with cardiovascular and yolk sac defects, and their fibroblasts 
showed reduced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in response to 
epidermal growth factor (EGF). An intercross of mice mutant for Sos1 and the EGF 
receptor (EGFR) demonstrated that a heterozygous mutation in Sos1 dominantly 
enhanced the phenotype of a weak allele of the EGFR allele (wa-2). These animals 
had distinctive eye defects that closely resembled those seen in mice that were 
null for the EGFR or its ligand, TGF alpha. Our findings provide the first 
demonstration of a functional requirement for Sos1 in growth factor signaling in 
vivo. They also show that the genetic test of enhancement of weak receptor 
allele by heterozygous mutation in one component represents a powerful tool for 
analyzing the ras pathway in mammals.
