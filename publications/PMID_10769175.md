Two human expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNA sequences with identity with 
Delta(5)- and Delta(6)-desaturases from a filamentous fungus, Mortierella 
alpina, were identified from the LifeSeq(R) database of Incyte Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. (Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.). An oligonucleotide complementary to the 3' EST 
cDNA sequences was used to screen human liver cDNA using rapid amplification of 
cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR. The amplified DNA fragment had 98% identity with a 
putative open reading frame (ORF) predicted from a human genomic sequence, and 
encoded 444 amino acids. Expression of this ORF in mouse fibroblast cells 
demonstrated that the encoded protein was a Delta(5)-desaturase, as determined 
by the conversion of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (C(20:3,n-6)) into arachidonic 
acid (C(20:4,n-6)). The human Delta(5)-desaturase contained a predicted 
N-terminal cytochrome b(5)-like domain, as well as three histidine-rich domains. 
A tissue expression profile revealed that this gene is highly expressed in fetal 
liver, fetal brain, adult brain and adrenal gland. A search of the existing 
databases led to localization of this ORF within a 14 kb interval flanked by the 
flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1) and vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best's disease; 
VMD2) loci of chromosome 11q12.
