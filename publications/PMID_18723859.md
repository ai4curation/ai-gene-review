Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease, caused 
by mutations of at least nine different genes. Several extrarenal manifestations 
characterize this disorder, including cerebellar defects, situs inversus and 
retinitis pigmentosa. While the clinical manifestations vary significantly in 
NPHP, mutations of NPHP5 and NPHP6 are always associated with progressive 
blindness. This clinical finding suggests that the gene products, nephrocystin-5 
and nephrocystin-6, participate in overlapping signaling pathways to maintain 
photoreceptor homeostasis. To analyze the genetic interaction between these two 
proteins in more detail, we studied zebrafish embryos after depletion of NPHP5 
and NPHP6. Knockdown of zebrafish zNPHP5 and zNPHP6 produced similar phenotypes, 
and synergistic effects were observed after the combined knockdown of zNPHP5 and 
zNPHP6. The N-terminal domain of nephrocystin-6-bound nephrocystin-5, and 
mapping studies delineated the interacting site from amino acid 696 to 896 of 
NPHP6. In Xenopus laevis, knockdown of NPHP5 caused substantial neural tube 
closure defects. This phenotype was copied by expression of the 
nephrocystin-5-binding fragment of nephrocystin-6, and rescued by co-expression 
of nephrocystin-5, supporting a physical interaction between both gene products 
in vivo. Since the N- and C-terminal fragments of nephrocystin-6 engage in the 
formation of homo- and heteromeric protein complexes, conformational changes 
seem to regulate the interaction of nephrocystin-6 with its binding partners.
