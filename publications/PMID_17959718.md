Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are essential for biological processes regulated 
by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Heparan sulfate (HS) regulates the activity 
of FGFs by acting as a coreceptor at the cell surface, enhancing FGF-FGFR 
affinity, and being a storage reservoir for FGFs in the extracellular matrix 
(ECM). Here we demonstrate a critical role for heparanase during mouse 
submandibular gland (SMG) branching morphogenesis. Heparanase, an 
endoglycosidase, colocalized with perlecan in the basement membrane and in 
epithelial clefts of SMGs. Inhibition of heparanase activity in organ culture 
decreased branching morphogenesis, and this inhibition was rescued specifically 
by FGF10 and not by other FGFs. By contrast, exogenous heparanase increased SMG 
branching and MAPK signaling and, surprisingly, when isolated epithelia were 
cultured in a three-dimensional ECM with FGF10, it increased the number of 
lateral branches and end buds. In a solid-phase binding assay, an FGF10-FGFR2b 
complex was released from the ECM by heparanase. In addition, surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) analysis showed that FGF10 and the FGF10-FGFR2b complex bound to 
purified perlecan HS and could be released by heparanase. We used the 
FGF10-FGFR2b complex as a probe for HS in SMGs, and it colocalized with perlecan 
in the basement membrane and partly colocalized with syndecan 1 in the 
epithelium, and binding was reduced by treatment with heparanase. In summary, 
our results show heparanase releases FGF10 from perlecan HS in the basement 
membrane, increasing MAPK signaling, epithelial clefting, and lateral branch 
formation, which results in increased branching morphogenesis.
