G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane 
receptors and are of major therapeutic importance. The identification of 
GPCR-associated proteins is an important step toward a better understanding of 
these receptors. However, current methods are not satisfying as only isolated 
receptor domains (intracellular loops or carboxyl-terminal tails) can be used as 
"bait." We report here a method based on tandem affinity purification coupled to 
mass spectrometry that overcomes these limitations as the entire receptor is 
used to identify protein complexes formed in living mammalian cells. The human 
MT(1) and MT(2) melatonin receptors were chosen as model GPCRs. Both receptors 
were tagged with the tandem affinity purification tag at their carboxyl-terminal 
tails and expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Receptor solubilization 
and purification conditions were optimized. The method was validated by the 
co-purification of G(i) proteins, which are well known GPCR interaction partners 
but which are difficult to identify with current protein-protein interaction 
assays. Several new and functionally relevant MT(1)- and MT(2)-associated 
proteins were identified; some of them were common to both receptors, and others 
were specific for each subtype. Taken together, our protocol allowed for the 
first time the purification of GPCR-associated proteins under native conditions 
in quantities suitable for mass spectrometry analysis.
