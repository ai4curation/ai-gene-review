The carboxyl-terminal domain (BRCT) of the Breast Cancer Gene 1 (BRCA1) protein 
is an evolutionarily conserved module that exists in a large number of proteins 
from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Although most BRCT domain-containing proteins 
participate in DNA-damage checkpoint or DNA-repair pathways, or both, the 
function of the BRCT domain is not fully understood. We show that the BRCA1 BRCT 
domain directly interacts with phosphorylated BRCA1-Associated Carboxyl-terminal 
Helicase (BACH1). This specific interaction between BRCA1 and phosphorylated 
BACH1 is cell cycle regulated and is required for DNA damage-induced checkpoint 
control during the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. Further, we 
show that two other BRCT domains interact with their respective physiological 
partners in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thirteen additional BRCT domains 
also preferentially bind phospho-peptides rather than nonphosphorylated control 
peptides. These data imply that the BRCT domain is a phospho-protein binding 
domain involved in cell cycle control.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in patients with deleterious BRCA1/2 alterations. While this marks a significant milestone, intrinsic or acquired therapy resistance remains a major challenge that limits clinical efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that dysregulated ubiquitination and turnover by the CUL3ZBTB2 E3 ligase complex induce the upregulation of the short isoform of NSD3 (NSD3S), which confers PARPi resistance in prostate cancer cells and patient-derived mCRPC samples. Mechanistically, ATR drives the localization of NSD3S at stalled replication forks, where it antagonizes the PTIP-dependent recruitment of the MRE11 nuclease, thereby protecting nascent DNA from extensive degradation and ensuring fork stabilization. Importantly, pharmacological degradation of NSD3S using an NSD3-targeting proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) efficiently enhances PARPi sensitivity in both cell line-derived xenograft and PDX mouse models. These findings establish NSD3S as a key determinant of PARPi toxicity in mCRPC.

In this study, Zhu et al. demonstrate that upregulated NSD3S confers acquired PARPi resistance in prostate cancer cells. ATR drives the localization of NSD3S to stalled replication forks, where it protects nascent DNA from extensive degradation and ensures fork stabilization by antagonizing PTIP-dependent recruitment of the MRE11 nuclease.
