The carboxyl-terminal domain (BRCT) of the Breast Cancer Gene 1 (BRCA1) protein 
is an evolutionarily conserved module that exists in a large number of proteins 
from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Although most BRCT domain-containing proteins 
participate in DNA-damage checkpoint or DNA-repair pathways, or both, the 
function of the BRCT domain is not fully understood. We show that the BRCA1 BRCT 
domain directly interacts with phosphorylated BRCA1-Associated Carboxyl-terminal 
Helicase (BACH1). This specific interaction between BRCA1 and phosphorylated 
BACH1 is cell cycle regulated and is required for DNA damage-induced checkpoint 
control during the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. Further, we 
show that two other BRCT domains interact with their respective physiological 
partners in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thirteen additional BRCT domains 
also preferentially bind phospho-peptides rather than nonphosphorylated control 
peptides. These data imply that the BRCT domain is a phospho-protein binding 
domain involved in cell cycle control.
