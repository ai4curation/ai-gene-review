The microtubule-binding interface of the kinetochore is of central importance in 
chromosome segregation. Although kinetochore components that stabilize, 
translocate on, and affect the polymerization state of microtubules have been 
identified, none have proven essential for kinetochore-microtubule interactions. 
Here, we examined the conserved KNL-1/Mis12 complex/Ndc80 complex (KMN) network, 
which is essential for kinetochore-microtubule interactions in vivo. We 
identified two distinct microtubule-binding activities within the KMN network: 
one associated with the Ndc80/Nuf2 subunits of the Ndc80 complex, and a second 
in KNL-1. Formation of the complete KMN network, which additionally requires the 
Mis12 complex and the Spc24/Spc25 subunits of the Ndc80 complex, synergistically 
enhances microtubule-binding activity. Phosphorylation by Aurora B, which 
corrects improper kinetochore-microtubule connections in vivo, reduces the 
affinity of the Ndc80 complex for microtubules in vitro. Based on these 
findings, we propose that the conserved KMN network constitutes the core 
microtubule-binding site of the kinetochore.
