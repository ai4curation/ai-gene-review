The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) is a key regulator of chromosome 
segregation and cytokinesis. CPC functions are connected to its localization. 
The complex first localizes to centromeres and later associates with the central 
spindle and midbody. Survivin, Borealin, and INCENP are the three components of 
the CPC that regulate the activity and localization of its enzymatic component, 
the kinase Aurora B. We determined the 1.4 A resolution crystal structure of the 
regulatory core of the CPC, revealing that Borealin and INCENP associate with 
the helical domain of Survivin to form a tight three-helical bundle. We used 
siRNA rescue experiments with structure-based mutants to explore the 
requirements for CPC localization. We show that the intertwined structural 
interactions of the core components lead to functional interdependence. 
Association of the core "passenger" proteins creates a single structural unit, 
whose composite molecular surface presents conserved residues essential for 
central spindle and midbody localization.
