Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), a causative factor for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
and the related Brother of ATXN1 (BOAT1) are human proteins involved in 
transcriptional repression. So far, little is known about which transcriptional 
pathways mediate the effects of ATXN1 and BOAT1. From our analyses of the 
properties of BOAT1 in Drosophila and of both proteins in mammalian cells, we 
report here that BOAT1 and ATXN1 are components of the Notch signalling pathway. 
In Drosophila, BOAT1 compromises the activities of Notch. In mammalian cells, 
both ATXN1 and BOAT1 bind to the promoter region of Hey1 and inhibit the 
transcriptional output of Notch through direct interactions with CBF1, a 
transcription factor that is crucial for the Notch pathway. Our results suggest 
that, in addition to their involvement in SCA1, ATXN1 and BOAT1 might 
participate in several Notch-controlled developmental and pathological 
processes.
