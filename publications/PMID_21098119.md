In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mother cells switch mating types 
between a and α forms, whereas daughter cells do not. This developmental 
asymmetry arises because the expression of the HO endonuclease, which initiates 
the interconversion of a and α mating type cassettes, is extinguished by the 
daughter-specific Ash1 transcriptional repressor. When daughters become mothers 
in the subsequent cell cycle, Ash1 must be eliminated to enable a new 
developmental state. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase SCF(Cdc4) 
mediates the phosphorylation-dependent elimination of Ash1. The inactivation of 
SCF(Cdc4) stabilizes Ash1 in vivo, and consistently, Ash1 binds to and is 
ubiquitinated by SCF(Cdc4) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in vitro. The 
mutation of a critical in vivo cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation 
site (Thr290) on Ash1 reduces its ubiquitination and rate of degradation in vivo 
and decreases the frequency of mating type switching. Ash1 associates with 
active Cdc28 kinase in vivo and is targeted to SCF(Cdc4) in a Cdc28-dependent 
fashion in vivo and in vitro. Ash1 recognition by Cdc4 appears to be mediated by 
at least three phosphorylation sites that form two redundant diphosphorylated 
degrons. The phosphorylation-dependent elimination of Ash1 by the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system thus underpins developmental asymmetry in budding 
yeast.

Abstract

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , mother cells switch mating types between a and α forms, whereas daughter cells do not. This developmental asymmetry arises because the expression of the HO endonuclease, which initiates the interconversion of a and α mating type cassettes, is extinguished by the daughter-specific Ash1 transcriptional repressor. When daughters become mothers in the subsequent cell cycle, Ash1 must be eliminated to enable a new developmental state. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase SCF Cdc4 mediates the phosphorylation-dependent elimination of Ash1. The inactivation of SCF Cdc4 stabilizes Ash1 in vivo , and consistently, Ash1 binds to and is ubiquitinated by SCF Cdc4 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in vitro . The mutation of a critical in vivo cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation site (Thr290) on Ash1 reduces its ubiquitination and rate of degradation in vivo and decreases the frequency of mating type switching. Ash1 associates with active Cdc28 kinase in vivo and is targeted to SCF Cdc4 in a Cdc28-dependent fashion in vivo and in vitro . Ash1 recognition by Cdc4 appears to be mediated by at least three phosphorylation sites that form two redundant diphosphorylated degrons. The phosphorylation-dependent elimination of Ash1 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system thus underpins developmental asymmetry in budding yeast.

DISCUSSION

Our results demonstrate that the asymmetric cell division factor Ash1 is targeted to SCF Cdc4 by Cdc28, which is the primary CDK kinase that controls cell division. The Cdc4- and phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Ash1 serves to restrict Ash1 accumulation to a G 1 -phase window in daughter cells and is necessary for efficient mating type switching to occur in mother cells. When combined with other mechanisms that enforce the daughter-specific localization of Ash1, this G 1 -phase restriction ensures that Ash1 cannot perdure as daughters become mothers ( 7 , 61 ). These findings illustrate the crucial role of protein degradation during developmental state transitions.
