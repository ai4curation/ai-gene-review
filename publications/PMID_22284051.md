Rabankyrin-5 (Rank-5) has been implicated as an effector of the small GTPase 
Rab5 and plays an important role in macropinocytosis. We have now identified 
Rank-5 as an interaction partner for the recycling regulatory protein, Eps15 
homology domain 1 (EHD1). We have demonstrated this interaction by glutathione 
S-transferase-pulldown, yeast two-hybrid assay, isothermal calorimetry and 
co-immunoprecipitation, and found that the binding occurs between the EH domain 
of EHD1 and the NPFED motif of Rank-5. Similar to EHD1, we found that Rank-5 
colocalizes and interacts with components of the retromer complex such as 
vacuolar protein sorting 26 (Vps26), suggesting a role for Rank-5 in 
retromer-based transport. Indeed, depletion of Rank-5 causes mislocalization of 
Vps26 and affects both the retrieval of mannose 6-phosphate receptor transport 
to the Golgi from endosomes and biosynthetic transport. Moreover, Rank-5 is 
required for normal retromer distribution, as overexpression of a wild-type 
Rank-5-small interfering RNA-resistant construct rescues retromer 
mislocalization. Finally, we show that depletion of either Rank-5 or EHD1 
impairs secretion of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. Overall, our data 
identify a new interaction between Rank-5 and EHD1, and novel endocytic 
regulatory roles that include retromer-based transport and secretion.
