The cell commits to dividing during the G2-M transition, and timing of mitotic 
entry must be tightly regulated to ensure correct chromosome segregation. 
Identification of all proteins and molecular events that orchestrate the G2-M 
transition will be required for a complete understanding of the cell division 
cycle, and how its deregulation contributes to cell transformation. We have 
previously reported D53, a member of the tumor protein D52 family, to be a novel 
14-3-3 partner protein in breast cancer cells. We now report that D53 expression 
is highly upregulated at the G2-M transition in breast cancer cell lines in 
which D53 is endogenously or exogenously expressed. The timing and subcellular 
localization of D53 expression paralleled that of cyclin B1, and D53 expression 
was similarly regulated at both post-transcriptional and post-translational 
levels. Interactions between D53 and 14-3-3, a negative regulator of the G2-M 
transition, were increased in synchronized populations enriched for cells in 
G2/M phases, compared with G1/S arrested cells. Enforced expression of two 
EGFP-tagged D53 isoforms and the related protein D52 produced high proportions 
of multinucleated MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. These results identify D53 
as a cell cycle-regulated protein whose deregulated expression can adversely 
affect the completion of mitosis.
