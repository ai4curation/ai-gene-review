Nob1p is a nuclear protein that forms a complex with the 19S regulatory particle 
of the 26S proteasome and with uncharacterized nuclear protein Pno1p. 
Overexpression of NOB1 overrode the defects in maturation of the 20S proteasome 
of ump1Delta cells, and temperature-sensitive nob1 and pno1 mutants exhibited 
defects in the processing of the beta subunits and in the assembly of the 20S 
and the 26S proteasomes. A defect in either NOB1 or PNO1 caused accumulation of 
newly formed Pre6p in the cytoplasm, whereas Pre6p of the ump1Delta strain 
accumulated in the nucleus irrespective of the temperature. Here we present a 
model proposing that (1) Nob1p serves as a chaperone to join the 20S proteasome 
with the 19S regulatory particle in the nucleus and facilitates the maturation 
of the 20S proteasome and degradation of Ump1p, and (2) Nob1p is then 
internalized into the 26S proteasome and degraded to complete 26S proteasome 
biogenesis.
