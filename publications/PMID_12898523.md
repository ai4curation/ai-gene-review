We recently characterized the interaction between poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
(PARP-1) and the product of the tumor suppressor gene p53. We investigated which
domains of human PARP-1 and of human wild-type (wt) p53 were involved in this
protein-protein interaction. We generated baculoviral constructs encoding full
length or distinct functional domains of both proteins. Full length PARP-1 was
simultaneously coexpressed in insect cells with full length wt p53 protein or
its distinct truncated fragments and vice versa. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation
of Sf9 cell lysates revealed that the central and carboxy-terminal fragments of
p53 were sufficient to confer binding to PARP-1, whereas the amino-terminal part
harboring the transactivation functional domain was dispensable. On the other
hand, the amino-terminal and central fragments of PARP-1 were necessary for
complex formation with p53 protein. As the most important features of p53
protein are regulated by phosphorylation, we addressed the question of whether
its phosphorylation is essential for binding between the two proteins.
Baculovirally expressed wt p53 was post-translationally modified. At least six
distinct p53 isomeres were resolved by immunoblotting following two-dimensional
separation of baculovirally expressed wt p53 protein. Using specific
phospho-serine antibodies, we identified phosphorylation of baculovirally
expressed p53 protein at five distinct sites. To define the role of p53
phosphorylation, pull-down assays using untreated and dephosphorylated p53
protein were performed. Dephosphorylated p53 failed to bind PARP-1 indicating
that complex formation between both proteins is regulated by phosphorylation of
p53. The marked phosphorylation of p53 at Ser392 observed in unstressed cells
suggests that the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal part of p53 undergoes complex
formation with PARP-1 resulting in masking of the NES and thereby preventing its
export. The functional significance of the interaction between both proteins was
investigated at two different conditions: inactivation of PARP-1 and
overexpression of PARP-1. Our results unequivocally show that the presence of
PARP-1 regulates the basal expression of wt p53 in unstressed cells.
