Steroid hormones control important developmental processes and are linked to 
many diseases. To systematically identify genes and pathways required for 
steroid production, we performed a Drosophila genome-wide in vivo RNAi screen 
and identified 1,906 genes with potential roles in steroidogenesis and 
developmental timing. Here, we use our screen as a resource to identify 
mechanisms regulating intracellular levels of cholesterol, a substrate for 
steroidogenesis. We identify a conserved fatty acid elongase that underlies a 
mechanism that adjusts cholesterol trafficking and steroidogenesis with 
nutrition and developmental programs. In addition, we demonstrate the existence 
of an autophagosomal cholesterol mobilization mechanism and show that activation 
of this system rescues Niemann-Pick type C1 deficiency that causes a disorder 
characterized by cholesterol accumulation. These cholesterol-trafficking 
mechanisms are regulated by TOR and feedback signaling that couples 
steroidogenesis with growth and ensures proper maturation timing. These results 
reveal genes regulating steroidogenesis during development that likely modulate 
disease mechanisms.
