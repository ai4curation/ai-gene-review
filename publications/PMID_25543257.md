Determining the structures of amyloid fibrils is an important first step toward 
understanding the molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases. For β-amyloid 
(Aβ) fibrils, conventional solid-state NMR structure determination using uniform 
labeling is limited by extensive peak overlap. We describe the characterization 
of a distinct structural polymorph of Aβ using solid-state NMR, transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM), and Rosetta model building. First, the overall fibril 
arrangement is established using mass-per-length measurements from TEM. Then, 
the fibril backbone arrangement, stacking registry, and "steric zipper" core 
interactions are determined using a number of solid-state NMR techniques on 
sparsely (13)C-labeled samples. Finally, we perform Rosetta structure 
calculations with an explicitly symmetric representation of the system. We 
demonstrate the power of the hybrid Rosetta/NMR approach by modeling the 
in-register, parallel "Iowa" mutant (D23N) at high resolution (1.2Å backbone 
rmsd). The final models are validated using an independent set of NMR 
experiments that confirm key features.
