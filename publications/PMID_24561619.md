Energy sensing by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is of fundamental 
importance in cell biology. In the pancreatic β-cell, AMPK is a central 
regulator of insulin secretion. The capacity of the β-cell to increase insulin 
output is a critical compensatory mechanism in prediabetes, yet its molecular 
underpinnings are unclear. Here we delineate a complex consisting of the 
AMPK-related kinase SIK2, the CDK5 activator CDK5R1 (also known as p35) and the 
E3 ligase PJA2 essential for β-cell functional compensation. Following glucose 
stimulation, SIK2 phosphorylates p35 at Ser 91, to trigger its ubiquitylation by 
PJA2 and promote insulin secretion. Furthermore, SIK2 accumulates in β-cells in 
models of metabolic syndrome to permit compensatory secretion; in contrast, 
β-cell knockout of SIK2 leads to accumulation of p35 and impaired secretion. 
This work demonstrates that the SIK2-p35-PJA2 complex is essential for glucose 
homeostasis and provides a link between p35-CDK5 and the AMPK family in 
excitable cells.
