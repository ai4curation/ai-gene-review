Transcriptional silencing in yeast is mediated by the interactions of silent 
information regulator (Sir) proteins with chromatin and with one another. The 
stable association of Sir3 with Sir4 is mediated by a C-terminal region of Sir3 
that has additional functions including the dimerization of Sir3. We have 
developed a simple, robust expression screening methodology that allows for the 
unbiased identification of functional protein domains expressed from 
nested-deletion libraries of full-length genes. Using these methodologies, Sir3 
dimerization was shown to be mediated by two separate domains. One of these 
domains also binds cooperatively to the C-terminal coiled-coil motif of Sir4 and 
dimerization further increases the affinity of Sir3 for Sir4. The resulting 
Sir3-Sir4 complexes form progressively higher order assemblies with increasing 
protein concentration, with implications for the mechanism of gene silencing.
