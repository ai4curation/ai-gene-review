Cryptochromes are blue-light photoreceptors that regulate the circadian clock in 
animals and growth and development in plants. Cryptochromes have high sequence 
homology to DNA photolyase but appear to lack photorepair activity. All previous 
work on cryptochromes was performed with protein expressed in heterologous 
systems; hence, biochemical and photochemical studies performed with these 
proteins were subject to certain limitations. In this study, we purified 
cryptochrome 2 (hCRY2) from human cells and characterized it. We find that hCRY2 
exhibits fluorescence properties consistent with the presence of folate and 
flavin cofactors. Cryptochrome 2 binds to double-stranded DNA weakly and to 
single-stranded DNA with higher affinity, and this binding is further stimulated 
by the presence of a (6-4) photoproduct. However, light has no effect on the 
cryptochrome 2-(6-4) photoproduct complex. These findings reveal new properties 
of this protein already known to function as a circadian photoreceptor and a 
light-independent negative transcriptional regulator of the clock genes.
