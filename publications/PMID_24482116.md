Plasma membrane damage can be triggered by numerous phenomena, and efficient 
repair is essential for cell survival. Endocytosis, membrane patching, or 
extracellular budding can be used for plasma membrane repair. We found that 
endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), involved previously in 
membrane budding and fission, plays a critical role in plasma membrane repair. 
ESCRT proteins were recruited within seconds to plasma membrane wounds. 
Quantitative analysis of wound closure kinetics coupled to mathematical modeling 
suggested that ESCRTs are involved in the repair of small wounds. Real-time 
imaging and correlative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) identified 
extracellular buds and shedding at the site of ESCRT recruitment. Thus, the 
repair of certain wounds is ensured by ESCRT-mediated extracellular shedding of 
wounded portions.
