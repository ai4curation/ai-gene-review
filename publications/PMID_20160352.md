Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, caused by nonautoimmune loss of beta cells, 
and neurological dysfunctions. We have previously shown that mutations in the 
Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1) gene cause Wolfram syndrome and that WFS1 has a 
protective function against ER stress. However, it remained to be determined how 
WFS1 mitigates ER stress. Here we have shown in rodent and human cell lines that 
WFS1 negatively regulates a key transcription factor involved in ER stress 
signaling, activating transcription factor 6alpha (ATF6alpha), through the 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. WFS1 suppressed expression of ATF6alpha target 
genes and repressed ATF6alpha-mediated activation of the ER stress response 
element (ERSE) promoter. Moreover, WFS1 stabilized the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1, 
brought ATF6alpha to the proteasome, and enhanced its ubiquitination and 
proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to suppression of ER stress signaling. 
Consistent with these data, beta cells from WFS1-deficient mice and lymphocytes 
from patients with Wolfram syndrome exhibited dysregulated ER stress signaling 
through upregulation of ATF6alpha and downregulation of HRD1. These results 
reveal a role for WFS1 in the negative regulation of ER stress signaling and in 
the pathogenesis of diseases involving chronic, unresolvable ER stress, such as 
pancreatic beta cell death in diabetes.
