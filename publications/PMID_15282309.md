We report here that the normal cellular protein CC3/TIP30, when in excess, 
inhibits nuclear import in vitro and in vivo. CC3 binds directly to the 
karyopherins of the importin beta family in a RanGTP-insensitive manner and 
associates with nucleoporins in vivo. CC3 inhibits the nuclear import of 
proteins possessing either the classical nuclear localization signal or the M9 
signal recognized by transportin. CC3 also inhibits nuclear translocation of 
transportin itself. Cells modified to express higher levels of CC3 have a slower 
rate of nuclear import and, as described earlier, show an increased sensitivity 
to death signals. A mutant CC3 protein lacking proapoptotic activity has a lower 
affinity for transportin, is displaced from it by RanGTP, and fails to inhibit 
nuclear import in vitro and in vivo. Together, our results support a correlation 
between the ability of CC3 to form a RanGTP-resistant complex with importins, 
inhibit nuclear import, and induce apoptosis. Significantly, a dominant-negative 
form of importin beta1 shown previously to inhibit multiple transport pathways 
induces rapid cell death, strongly indicating that inhibition of nuclear 
transport serves as a potent apoptotic signal.
