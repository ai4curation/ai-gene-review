The sequence specificity of DNA-binding proteins is the primary mechanism by 
which the cell recognizes genomic features. Here, we describe systematic 
determination of yeast transcription factor DNA-binding specificities. We 
obtained binding specificities for 112 DNA-binding proteins representing 19 
distinct structural classes. One-third of the binding specificities have not 
been previously reported. Several binding sequences have striking genomic 
distributions relative to transcription start sites, supporting their biological 
relevance and suggesting a role in promoter architecture. Among these are Rsc3 
binding sequences, containing the core CGCG, which are found preferentially 
approximately 100 bp upstream of transcription start sites. Mutation of RSC3 
results in a dramatic increase in nucleosome occupancy in hundreds of proximal 
promoters containing a Rsc3 binding element, but has little impact on promoters 
lacking Rsc3 binding sequences, indicating that Rsc3 plays a broad role in 
targeting nucleosome exclusion at yeast promoters.
