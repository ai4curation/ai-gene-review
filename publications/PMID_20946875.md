Intersectin 1 (ITSN1) is an evolutionarily conserved adaptor protein involved in 
clathrin-mediated endocytosis, cellular signaling and cytoskeleton 
rearrangement. ITSN1 gene is located on human chromosome 21 in Down syndrome 
critical region. Several studies confirmed role of ITSN1 in Down syndrome 
phenotype. Here we report the identification of novel interconnections in the 
interaction network of this endocytic adaptor. We show that the 
membrane-deforming protein SGIP1 (Src homology 3-domain growth factor 
receptor-bound 2-like (endophilin) interacting protein 1) and the signaling 
adaptor Reps1 (RalBP associated Eps15-homology domain protein) interact with 
ITSN1 in vivo. Both interactions are mediated by the SH3 domains of ITSN1 and 
proline-rich motifs of protein partners. Moreover complexes comprising SGIP1, 
Reps1 and ITSN1 have been identified. We also identified new interactions 
between SGIP1, Reps1 and the BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain-containing protein 
amphiphysin 1. Immunofluorescent data have demonstrated colocalization of ITSN1 
with the newly identified protein partners in clathrin-coated pits. These 
findings expand the role of ITSN1 as a scaffolding molecule bringing together 
components of endocytic complexes.
