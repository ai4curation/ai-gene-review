Proliferating cells express genes active in cell cycle control. The modulation 
of control genes and factors are required to maintain critical cell cycle 
activities. We used a set of monoclonal antibodies prepared against DNA-binding 
proteins from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in immunofluorescent microscopy to 
screen for proteins showing cell cycle-specific staining patterns. Here, we 
report cloning and characterizing of a novel mitogen-inducible gene from murine 
macrophages that predicts a cell cycle-specifically modulated nuclear protein of 
38 kDa, designated p38-2G4. p38-2G4 displayed a speckled pattern of varying 
fluorescence intensity confined to the nucleus, but sparing the nucleoli. 
Strongly stained granules were observed between G1 and mid S phase, followed by 
a less abundant punctated arrangement toward the end of S phase, and negative 
fluorescence at the S/G2 transition. Thereafter, the nuclear staining 
reappeared. Additionally, p38-2G4 expression vanished in G0-arrested cells and 
was restored after release from growth arrest. p38-2G4 conserved in vertebrates 
by means of immunofluorescence data contains a number of putative 
phosphorylation sites, a cryptic nuclear localization signal, and an amphipathic 
helical domain. Our cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequence is related to a 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene encoding a 42-kDa protein that associates with 
curved DNA, suggesting that we have cloned the murine homologue of the S. pombe 
gene which defines a novel cell cycle-specifically modified and 
proliferation-associated nuclear protein in mammals.
