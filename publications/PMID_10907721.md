Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase I (GCH) is the first and 
rate-limiting enzyme for biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, the cofactor of 
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Our previous study reported the presence of GCH in 
several neuronal groups in animal brains using a newly raised anti-GCH antibody. 
The present study aims at elucidating whether GCH and TH coexist in the same 
neurons of the human brain with the aid of immunohistochemical dual labeling. 
GCH-immunoreactivity was observed in the cell bodies and fibers of monoaminergic 
neurons of the human brain. Neurons which contain both enzymes are seen in the 
human substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, 
and zona incerta. In these regions, almost all the cells also show 
immunoreactivity for aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the second step 
enzyme for catecholamine synthesis, indicating that these neurons are 
catecholaminergic. However, some neurons in the dorsal and dorsomedial 
hypothalamic nuclei are stained only for GCH or TH. They appear to constitute an 
independent cell group in the human brain. The present observation suggests that 
L-dopa is not produced in the cells immunoreactive for TH but not for GCH, and 
that TH in these cells which lack GCH may have an unidentified role other than 
dopa synthesis.
