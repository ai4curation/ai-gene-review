Mdj1p, a novel member of the DnaJ family, is a heat shock protein that is 
associated with the inner membrane of mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
Disruption of the MDJ1 gene resulted in a petite phenotype, loss of 
mitochondrial DNA, and inviability at 37 degrees C. Import of precursor proteins 
was not affected by a lack of Mdj1p, but folding of newly imported proteins was 
markedly impaired. The efficiency of refolding of a tester protein, 
dihydrofolate reductase, was significantly reduced in mitochondria lacking Mdj1p 
after incubation at elevated temperature. We conclude that Mdj1p is an important 
mitochondrial chaperone that participates in the folding of newly imported 
proteins and in the protection of proteins against heat denaturation and 
aggregation.
