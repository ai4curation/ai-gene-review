Hsp90 has a diverse array of cellular roles including protein folding, stress 
response and signal transduction. Herein we report a novel function for Hsp90 in 
the ATP-dependent assembly of the 26S proteasome. Functional loss of Hsp90 using 
a temperature-sensitive mutant in yeast caused dissociation of the 26S 
proteasome. Conversely, these dissociated constituents reassembled in 
Hsp90-dependent fashion both in vivo and in vitro; the process required 
ATP-hydrolysis and was suppressed by the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. We also 
found genetic interactions between Hsp90 and several proteasomal Rpn (Regulatory 
particle non-ATPase subunit) genes, emphasizing the importance of Hsp90 to the 
integrity of the 26S proteasome. Our results indicate that Hsp90 interacts with 
the 26S proteasome and plays a principal role in the assembly and maintenance of 
the 26S proteasome.
