In the present study, we describe the function of a novel protein, ECop 
(EGFR-Coamplified and overexpressed protein), in the regulation of NF-kappaB 
activity. Ectopic expression of ECop increases NF-kappaB transcriptional 
activity by promoting nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-kappaB, and 
ECop-induced NF-kappaB activation confers cellular resistance to apoptotic 
challenge. In ECop knockdown cells, NF-kappaB transcriptional activity is 
suppressed due to delayed IkappaBalpha degradation, which results in a delayed 
nuclear translocation as well as decreased DNA binding of NF-kappaB. Suppression 
of NF-kappaB activation by ECop knockdown increases cellular susceptibility to 
apoptosis. These results suggest that ECop is a key regulator of NF-kappaB 
signaling, and that high-level, amplification-mediated ECop expression, such as 
that occurring in tumors with amplified EGFR, could contribute to resistance to 
apoptosis.
