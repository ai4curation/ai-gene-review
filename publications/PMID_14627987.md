## Abstract

PARP-1 binds E2F-1 independently of its DNA binding and catalytic domains, and 
acts as a novel coactivator of E2F-1-mediated transcription during re-entry of 
quiescent cells into S phase.

The transcription factor E2F-1 is implicated in the activation of S-phase genes 
as well as induction of apoptosis, and is regulated by interactions with Rb and 
by cell cycle-dependent alterations in E2F-1 abundance. We earlier demonstrated 
a pivotal role for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) in the regulation of 
E2F-1 expression and promoter activity during S-phase re-entry when quiescent 
cells re-enter the cell cycle. We now investigate the putative mechanism(s) by 
which PARP-1 may upregulate E2F-1 promoter activity during S-phase re-entry. 
DNase-1 footprint assays with purified PARP-1 showed that PARP-1 did not 
directly bind the E2F-1 promoter in a sequence-specific manner. In contrast to 
p53, a positive acceptor in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions, E2F-1 was not 
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by wild-type PARP-1 in vitro, indicating that PARP-1 does 
not exert a dual effect on E2F-1 transcriptional activation. Protein-binding 
reactions and coimmunoprecipitation experiments with purified PARP-1 and E2F-1, 
however, revealed that PARP-1 binds to E2F-1 in vitro. More significantly, 
physical association of PARP-1 and E2F-1 in vivo also occurred in wild-type 
fibroblasts 5 h after re-entry into S phase, coincident with the increase in 
E2F-1 promoter activity and expression of E2F-1-responsive S-phase genes cyclin 
A and c-Myc. Mapping of the interaction domains revealed that full-length PARP-1 
as well as PARP-1 mutants lacking either the catalytic active site or the 
DNA-binding domain equally bind E2F-1, whereas a PARP-1 mutant lacking the 
automodification domain does not, suggesting that the protein interaction site 
is located in this central domain. Finally, gel shift analysis with end-blocked 
E2F-1 promoter sequence probes verified that the binding of PARP-1 to E2F-1 
enhances binding to the E2F-1 promoter, indicating that PARP-1 acts as a 
positive cofactor of E2F-1-mediated transcription.
