Biological energy currency ATP is produced by F1Fo-ATP synthase. However, the 
molecular mechanism for human ATP synthase action remains unknown. Here, we 
present snapshot images for three main rotational states and one substate of 
human ATP synthase using cryoelectron microscopy. These structures reveal that 
the release of ADP occurs when the β subunit of F1Fo-ATP synthase is in the open 
conformation, showing how ADP binding is coordinated during synthesis. The 
accommodation of the symmetry mismatch between F1 and Fo motors is resolved by 
the torsional flexing of the entire complex, especially the γ subunit, and the 
rotational substep of the c subunit. Water molecules are identified in the inlet 
and outlet half-channels, suggesting that the proton transfer in these two 
half-channels proceed via a Grotthus mechanism. Clinically relevant mutations 
are mapped to the structure, showing that they are mainly located at the 
subunit-subunit interfaces, thus causing instability of the complex.
