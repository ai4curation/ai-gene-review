Interleukin (IL)-21 is a novel cytokine that has been shown to enhance 
proliferation and activation of CD8+ T cells, enhance natural killer (NK) cell 
activity and costimulate anti-CD40-driven B-cell proliferation in mice. Several 
studies have furthermore demonstrated antitumour effects of IL-21 administration 
in mouse models. In this study we have investigated how IL-21 affects the 
survival and cytotoxicity of human NK cells and modulates their expression of 
surface receptors and of the effector molecules granzyme B and perforin. In 
contrast to murine NK cells, where IL-21 alone cannot sustain survival, IL-21 
and IL-2 were equally efficient in sustaining survival of human NK cells. In the 
absence of other cytokines, IL-21 had little effect on expression of a panel of 
surface receptors on human NK cells. However, IL-21 synergized with IL-2 to 
up-regulate several surface receptors, including NKG2A, CD25, CD86 and CD69. The 
CD25+ CD86+ NK cells were CD56(bright) and were large and granular. Expression 
of the effector molecules perforin and granzyme A and B was up-regulated by 
IL-21 at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, IL-21 increased the 
cytotoxicity of NK cells against K562 target cells. These findings suggest that 
IL-21 modulates NK cell activity through induction of intracellular effector 
molecules as well as modulation of surface receptor expression.
