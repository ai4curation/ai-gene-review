Alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas are pediatric solid tumors with a hallmark 
cytogenetic abnormality: translocation of chromosomes 2 and 13 [t(2;13) 
(q35;q14)]. The genes on each chromosome involved in this translocation have 
been identified as the transcription factor-encoding genes PAX3 and FKHR. The 
NH2-terminal paired box and homeodomain DNA-binding domains of PAX3 are fused in 
frame to COOH-terminal regions of the chromosome 13-derived FKHR gene, a novel 
member of the forkhead DNA-binding domain family. To determine the role of the 
fusion protein in transcriptional regulation and oncogenesis, we identified the 
PAX3-FKHR fusion protein and characterized its function(s) as a transcription 
factor relative to wild-type PAX3. Antisera specific to PAX3 and FKHR were 
developed and used to examine PAX3 and PAX3-FKHR expression in tumor cell lines. 
Sequential immunoprecipitations with anti-PAX3 and anti-FKHR sera demonstrated 
expression of a 97-kDa PAX3-FKHR fusion protein in the t(2;13)-positive 
rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cell line and verified that a single polypeptide contains 
epitopes derived from each protein. The PAX3-FKHR protein was localized to the 
nucleus in Rh30 cells, as was wild-type PAX3, in t(2;13)-negative A673 cells. In 
gel shift assays using a canonical PAX binding site (e5 sequence), we found that 
DNA binding of PAX3-FKHR was significantly impaired relative to that of PAX3 
despite the two proteins having identical PAX DNA-binding domains. However, the 
PAX3-FKHR fusion protein was a much more potent transcriptional activator than 
PAX3 as determined by transient cotransfection assays using e5-CAT reporter 
plasmids. The PAX3-FKHR protein may function as an oncogenic transcription 
factor by enhanced activation of normal PAX3 target genes.
