The 26 S proteasome, which catalyzes degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins, 
is composed of the 20 S proteasome and the 19 S regulatory particle (RP). The RP 
is composed of the lid and base subcomplexes and regulates the catalytic 
activity of the 20 S proteasome. In this study, we carried out affinity 
purification of the lid and base subcomplexes from the tagged strains of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we found that the lid contains a small molecular 
mass protein, Sem1. The Sem1 protein binds with the 26 S proteasome isolated 
from a mutant with deletion of SEM1 but not with the 26 S proteasome from the 
wild type. The lid lacking Sem1 is unstable at a high salt concentration. The 19 
S RP was immunoprecipitated together with Sem1 by immunoprecipitation using 
hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Sem1 as bait. Degradation of polyubiquitinated 
proteins in vivo or in vitro is impaired in the Sem1-deficient 26 S proteasome. 
In addition, genetic interaction between SEM1 and RPN10 was detected. The human 
Sem1 homologue hDSS1 was found to be a functional homologue of Sem1 and capable 
of interacting with the human 26 S proteasome. The results suggest that Sem1, 
possibly hDSS1, is a novel subunit of the 26 S proteasome and plays a role in 
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.
