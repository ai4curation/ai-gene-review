Peroxiredoxins are a family of abundant peroxidases found in all organisms. 
Although these antioxidant enzymes are thought to be critically involved in 
cellular defense and redox signaling, their exact physiological roles are 
largely unknown. In this study, we took a genetic approach to address the 
functions of peroxiredoxins in budding yeast. We generated and characterized a 
yeast mutant lacking all five peroxiredoxins. The quintuple peroxiredoxin-null 
mutant was still viable, though the growth rate was lower under normal aerobic 
conditions. Although peroxiredoxins are not essential for cell viability, 
peroxiredoxin-null yeast cells were more susceptible to oxidative and 
nitrosative stress. In the complete absence of peroxiredoxins, the expression of 
other antioxidant proteins including glutathione peroxidase and glutathione 
reductase was induced. In addition, the quintuple mutant was hypersensitive to 
glutathione depletion. Thus, the glutathione system might cooperate with other 
antioxidant enzymes to compensate for peroxiredoxin deficiency. Interestingly, 
the peroxiredoxinnull yeast cells displayed an increased rate of spontaneous 
mutations that conferred resistance to canavanine. This mutator phenotype was 
rescued by yeast peroxiredoxin Tsa1p, but not by its active-site mutant 
defective for peroxidase activity. Our findings suggest that the antioxidant 
function of peroxiredoxins is important for maintaining genome stability in 
eukaryotic cells.
