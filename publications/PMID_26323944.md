AIM: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential biomarkers for breast cancer 
risk stratification. LncRNA expression has been investigated primarily by RNA 
sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription PCR or microarray techniques. In 
this study, six breast cancer-implicated lncRNAs were investigated by 
chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH).
METHODS: Invasive breast carcinoma (IBC), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 
normal adjacent (NA) breast tissues from 52 patients were screened by CISH. 
Staining was graded by modified Allred scoring.
RESULTS: HOTAIR, H19 and KCNQ1OT1 had significantly higher expression levels in 
IBC and DCIS than NA (p<0.05), and HOTAIR and H19 were expressed more strongly 
in IBC than in DCIS tissues (p<0.05). HOTAIR and KCNQ101T were expressed in 
tumour cells; H19 and MEG3 were expressed in stromal microenvironment cells; 
MALAT1 was expressed in all cells strongly and ZFAS1 was negative or weakly 
expressed in all specimens.
CONCLUSION: These data corroborate the involvement of three lncRNAs (HOTAIR, H19 
and KCNQ1OT1) in breast tumourigenesis and support lncRNA CISH as a potential 
clinical assay. Importantly, CISH allows identification of the tissue 
compartment expressing lncRNA.
