Gene regulation involves long-range communication between silencers, enhancers, 
and promoters. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, silencers flank transcriptionally 
repressed genes to mediate regional silencing. Silencers recruit the Sir 
proteins, which then spread along chromatin to encompass the entire silenced 
domain. In this report we have employed a boundary trap assay, an enhancer 
activity assay, chromatin immunoprecipitations, and chromosome conformation 
capture analyses to demonstrate that the two HMR silencer elements are in close 
proximity and functionally communicate with one another in vivo. We further show 
that silencing is necessary for these long-range interactions, and we present 
models for Sir-mediated silencing based upon these results.
