The serine/threonine protein phosphatases are targeted to specific subcellular 
locations and substrates in part via interactions with a wide variety of 
regulatory proteins. Understanding these interactions is thus critical to 
understanding phosphatase function. Using an iterative affinity 
purification/mass spectrometry approach, we generated a high density interaction 
map surrounding the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit. This approach 
recapitulated the assembly of the PP2A catalytic subunit into many different 
trimeric complexes but also revealed several new protein-protein interactions. 
Here we define a novel large multiprotein assembly, referred to as the 
striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex. STRIPAK contains 
the PP2A catalytic (PP2Ac) and scaffolding (PP2A A) subunits, the striatins 
(PP2A regulatory B''' subunits), the striatin-associated protein Mob3, the novel 
proteins STRIP1 and STRIP2 (formerly FAM40A and FAM40B), the cerebral cavernous 
malformation 3 (CCM3) protein, and members of the germinal center kinase III 
family of Ste20 kinases. Although the function of the CCM3 protein is unknown, 
the CCM3 gene is mutated in familial cerebral cavernous malformations, a 
condition associated with seizures and strokes. Our proteomics survey indicates 
that a large portion of the CCM3 protein resides within the STRIPAK complex, 
opening the way for further studies of CCM3 biology. The STRIPAK assembly 
establishes mutually exclusive interactions with either the CTTNBP2 proteins 
(which interact with the cytoskeletal protein cortactin) or a second subcomplex 
consisting of the sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein (SLMAP) and the 
related coiled-coil proteins suppressor of IKKepsilon (SIKE) and FGFR1OP2. We 
have thus identified several novel PP2A-containing protein complexes, including 
a large assembly linking kinases and phosphatases to a gene mutated in human 
disease.
