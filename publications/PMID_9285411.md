The human cytomegalovirus UL18 gene product is a homolog of cellular major 
histocompatibility (MHC) class I antigens. UL18 has been proposed to protect 
virus-infected cells against natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity by engaging 
NK cell killer inhibitory receptors (KIR) for MHC class I. UL18 binds to a novel 
immunoglobulin superfamily glycoprotein, designated Leukocyte 
Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (LIR-1). This protein is distinct from, but related 
to, known KIRs and binds cellular MHC class I antigens. The cytoplasmic domain 
of LIR-1 contains four putative immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. 
Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, LIR-1 associates with the tyrosine phosphatase 
SHP-1. In contrast to KIRs, LIR-1 is expressed predominantly on monocytic and B 
lymphoid cell types, suggesting a distinct biological function.
