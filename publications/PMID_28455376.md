Jaw morphogenesis is a complex event mediated by inductive signals that 
establish and maintain the distinct developmental domains required for formation 
of hinged jaws, the defining feature of gnathostomes. The mandibular portion of 
pharyngeal arch 1 is patterned dorsally by Jagged-Notch signaling and ventrally 
by endothelin receptor A (EDNRA) signaling. Loss of EDNRA signaling disrupts 
normal ventral gene expression, the result of which is homeotic transformation 
of the mandible into a maxilla-like structure. However, loss of Jagged-Notch 
signaling does not result in significant changes in maxillary development. Here 
we show in mouse that the transcription factor SIX1 regulates dorsal arch 
development not only by inducing dorsal Jag1 expression but also by inhibiting 
endothelin 1 (Edn1) expression in the pharyngeal endoderm of the dorsal arch, 
thus preventing dorsal EDNRA signaling. In the absence of SIX1, but not JAG1, 
aberrant EDNRA signaling in the dorsal domain results in partial duplication of 
the mandible. Together, our results illustrate that SIX1 is the central mediator 
of dorsal mandibular arch identity, thus ensuring separation of bone development 
between the upper and lower jaws.
