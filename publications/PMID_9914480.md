The Skp protein of Escherichia coli has been proposed to be a periplasmic 
molecular chaperone involved in the biogenesis of outer membrane proteins. In 
this study, evidence is obtained that Skp exists in two different states 
characterized by their different sensitivity to proteases. The conversion 
between these states can be modulated in vitro by phospholipids, 
lipopolysaccharides and bivalent cations. Skp is able to associate with and 
insert into phospholipid membranes in vitro, indicating that it may associate 
with phospholipids in the inner and/or outer membrane in vivo. In addition, it 
interacts specifically with outer membrane proteins that are in their non-native 
state. We propose that Skp is required in vivo for the efficient targeting of 
unfolded outer membrane proteins to the membrane.
