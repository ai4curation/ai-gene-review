Cytoplasmic Hsp70s of SSA family, especially Ssa1p, are involved in the 
degradation of a variety of misfolded proteins in yeast. However the importance 
of other Ssa proteins in this process is unclear. To clarify the role(s) of 
individual Ssa proteins in proteolysis, we measured the breakdown of various 
cell proteins in mutants lacking different Ssa proteins. In mutants lacking 
Ssa1p and Ssa2p, the proteasomal degradation of short-lived proteins was 
reduced, which was not restored fully by the over-expression of Ssa1p. By 
contrast, the degradation of stable cellular proteins did not require Ssa 
proteins. The degradation of the cytosolic model substrates (Ub-P-β-gal and 
R-β-gal) and their ubiquitylation were inhibited by the inactivation of Ssa 
proteins. In addition, Ssa1p and the co-chaperone Ydj1p are indispensable for 
the intracellular degradation of a mutant secretory protein, Siiyama variant of 
human antitrypsin. Our findings indicate that both Ssa1p and Ssa2p are essential 
for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of short-lived proteins and the 
requirements of Ssa proteins and the co-chaperones widely vary depending on the 
conformations and folding status of the substrates.
