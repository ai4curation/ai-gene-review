PCNA is a key component of DNA replication and repair machineries. DNA 
damage-induced PCNA ubiquitylation serves as a molecular mark to orchestrate 
postreplication repair. Here, we have identified and characterized Spartan, a 
protein that specifically recognizes ubiquitylated PCNA and plays an important 
role in cellular resistance to UV radiation. In vitro, Spartan engages 
ubiquitylated PCNA via both a PIP box and a UBZ domain. In cells, Spartan is 
recruited to sites of UV damage in a manner dependent upon the PIP box, the UBZ 
domain, and PCNA ubiquitylation. Furthermore, Spartan colocalizes and interacts 
with Rad18, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that modifies PCNA. Surprisingly, while 
Spartan is recruited by ubiquitylated PCNA, knockdown of Spartan compromised 
chromatin association of Rad18, monoubiquitylation of PCNA, and localization of 
Pol η to UV damage. Thus, as a "reader" of ubiquitylated PCNA, Spartan promotes 
an unexpected feed-forward loop to enhance PCNA ubiquitylation and translesion 
DNA synthesis.
