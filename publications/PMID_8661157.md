The membrane protein CD63, a molecular marker for early stages of melanoma 
progression, has been associated with platelet storage pool deficiency disorders 
(SPD). CD63 localizes to the membranes of platelets, lysosomes, and melanosomes, 
all of which are affected in a specific subgroup of SPD. The cDNA encoding CD63 
detects two closely related sequences that map to different regions of the mouse 
genome. One locus maps to mouse Chromosome (Chr) 10 in a region that shares 
linkage homology with the human chromosome encoding human CD63. The second locus 
maps to mouse Chr 18 in a region that bears no known human CD63-related genes. 
No SPD has been localized to these regions of either the mouse or the human 
chromosomes.
