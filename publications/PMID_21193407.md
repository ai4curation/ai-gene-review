The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored neutrophil-specific receptor NB1 
(CD177) presents the autoantigen proteinase 3 (PR3) on the membrane of a 
neutrophil subset. PR3-ANCA-activated neutrophils participate in small-vessel 
vasculitis. Since NB1 lacks an intracellular domain, we characterized components 
of the NB1 signaling complex that are pivotal for neutrophil activation. 
PR3-ANCA resulted in degranulation and superoxide production in the 
mNB1(pos)/PR3(high) neutrophils, but not in the mNB1(neg)/PR3(low) subset, 
whereas MPO-ANCA and fMLP caused similar responses. The NB1 signaling complex 
that was precipitated from plasma membranes contained the transmembrane receptor 
Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) as shown by MS/MS analysis and immunoblotting. NB1 
co-precipitation was less for CD11a and not detectable for CD11c. NB1 showed 
direct protein-protein interactions with both CD11b and CD11a by surface plasmon 
resonance analysis (SPR). However, when these integrins were presented as 
heterodimeric transmembrane proteins on transfected cells, only CD11b/CD18 
(Mac-1)-transfected cells adhered to immobilized NB1 protein. This adhesion was 
inhibited by mAb against NB1, CD11b, and CD18. NB1, PR3, and Mac-1 were located 
within lipid rafts. In addition, confocal microscopy showed the strongest NB1 
co-localization with CD11b and CD18 on the neutrophil. Stimulation with 
NB1-activating mAb triggered degranulation and superoxide production in 
mNB1(pos)/mPR3(high) neutrophils, and this effect was reduced using blocking 
antibodies to CD11b. CD11b blockade also inhibited PR3-ANCA-induced neutrophil 
activation, even when β2-integrin ligand-dependent signals were omitted. We 
establish the pivotal role of the NB1-Mac-1 receptor interaction for 
PR3-ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation.
