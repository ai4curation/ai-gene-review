Translesion DNA synthesis is an important branch of the DNA damage tolerance

DNA polymerase (Pol) switches during lesion bypass are not known. Here, we show 
that the C-terminal domain of the Pol ζ catalytic subunit interacts with 
accessory subunits of replicative DNA Pol δ. We also show that, unlike other 
members of the human B-family of DNA polymerases, the highly conserved and 
similar C-terminal domains of Pol δ and Pol ζ contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster 
coordinated by four cysteines. Amino acid changes in Pol ζ that prevent the 
assembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster abrogate Pol ζ function in UV mutagenesis. On 
the basis of these data, we propose that Pol switches at replication-blocking 
lesions occur by the exchange of the Pol δ and Pol ζ catalytic subunits on a

Abstract

Translesion DNA synthesis is an important branch of the DNA damage tolerance pathway that assures genomic integrity of living organisms. The mechanisms of DNA polymerase (Pol) switches during lesion bypass are not known. Here, we show that the C-terminal domain of the Pol ζ catalytic subunit interacts with accessory subunits of replicative DNA Pol δ. We also show that, unlike other members of the human B-family of DNA polymerases, the highly conserved and similar C-terminal domains of Pol δ and Pol ζ contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated by four cysteines. Amino acid changes in Pol ζ that prevent the assembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster abrogate Pol ζ function in UV mutagenesis. On the basis of these data, we propose that Pol switches at replication-blocking lesions occur by the exchange of the Pol δ and Pol ζ catalytic subunits on a preassembled complex of accessory proteins retained on DNA during translesion DNA synthesis.

Introduction

Eukaryotes possess four B-family DNA polymerases: α, δ, ϵ, and ζ ( 1 ). Polymerase (Pol) 2 α functions in initiation and early elongation steps of replication by extending RNA primers laid by a tightly associated primase. Pol δ plays an indispensable role in DNA replication and DNA repair in eukaryotic cells ( 2 ). Pol ϵ is involved in the initiation of replication at origins and in leading-strand synthesis in the vicinity of the origins ( 3 ). Its role in bulk replication is less clear because, in yeast, the N-terminal part of the protein responsible for catalytic functions is not essential for replication ( 4 , 5 ). Pol ζ can bypass some lesions and, importantly, is ultimately involved in the extension of non-canonical primer-template combinations that result in mutation fixation ( 6 , 7 ). Disruption of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit ( REV3 ) results in a severe decrease in spontaneous and damage-induced mutagenesis, embryonic lethality in mice, and chromosomal instability ( 8 ). These properties put Pol ζ in a central position in the cellular machinery regulating the outcomes of DNA damage, a process that triggers many diseases, including cancer.

The four eukaryotic B-family DNA polymerases are multisubunit complexes composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits ( Fig. 1 ) ( 9 – 11 ). DNA polymerases α, δ, and ϵ invariably have orthologous essential B-subunits bound to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the catalytic subunit. A corresponding subunit was not found for Pol ζ; however, its CTD harbors two metal-binding sites (MBS1 and MBS2), each composed of four conserved cysteines, as in the other members of B-family DNA polymerases ( 11 – 13 ). The crystal structure of the yeast Pol α CTD and B-subunit complex revealed that MBS2 is directly involved in intersubunit interaction ( 13 ). Combined with electron microscopy studies of Pol α and Pol ϵ and small angle x-ray scattering studies of Pol δ, these data indicate that the CTD is organized as a separate domain connected to the catalytic core by a flexible linker ( 13 – 15 ). This indicates that CTD is a universal tether between the catalytic core and accessory subunits in replicative DNA polymerases. Unlike Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ϵ, the structural role for the Pol ζ CTD was not established.

Intriguingly, mutations affecting the CTD or accessory subunits of Pol δ abolish induced mutagenesis to the same extent as the absence of Pol ζ ( 16 – 18 ), indicating that Pol δ participates in the regulation of error-prone translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). However, the reasons for the dependence of Pol ζ function on Pol δ and the mechanism of the key event in TLS, the Pol δ ↔ Pol ζ switch, remained a mystery. Here, we present an explanation for this by demonstrating that Pol ζ and the catalytic subunit of Pol δ share the accessory B- and C-subunits of Pol δ.

DISCUSSION

The absence of a B-subunit analog in Pol ζ and the high structural similarity between Pol δ and Pol ζ CTDs prompted us to hypothesize that the Pol δ B-subunit could be a Pol ζ binding partner. Moreover, the crystal structure of the human Pol δ p50-p66 N subcomplex ( 18 ) revealed several disordered loops in p50, providing a wide flexible surface ( supplemental Fig. S6 ). Mutations disrupting the interaction of the B-subunit with the catalytic subunit were mapped mainly to this disordered surface, indicating that it is a docking site for the Pol δ CTD ( 34 ). The flexibility of this surface indicates that p50 could interact with either the Pol δ or Pol ζ CTD. Our biochemical experiments confirmed this idea.

We summarize our main findings and their consequences for TLS as follows: ( i ) the B-subunit of Pol δ binds equally well to the catalytic subunit of either Pol δ or Pol ζ; ( ii ) the CTDs of Pol δ and Pol ζ contain a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is critical for binding to the B-subunit and for UV light-induced mutagenesis; and ( iii ) both the Pol α and Pol ϵ catalytic subunits lack the [4Fe-4S] cluster, and their B-subunits do not bind the C terminus of Pol ζ. We propose a plausible mechanism for the p125 ↔ Pol ζ switch during TLS ( Fig. 6 ). When Pol δ stalls at a DNA lesion, it induces a signal leading to the dissociation of the Pol δ catalytic subunit. The exact sequence of events leading to this is unknown but involves proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ubiquitylation and recruitment of Rev1 ( 8 , 35 ). The B- and C-subunits that are bound to PCNA remain on the DNA and recruit Pol ζ. The latter, with the assistance of Y-family TLS polymerases, bypasses the DNA lesion and is then replaced again by the catalytic subunit of Pol δ to continue processive replication. According to the crystal structure of the Pol α CTD-B complex ( 13 ) and the Pol α-Pol δ CTD alignment results ( Fig. 2 ), the [4Fe-4S] cluster in Pol δ and Pol ζ is likely not buried in the CTD structure and is directly involved in the interaction with p50. Furthermore, the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster specifically in the Pol δ and Pol ζ CTDs suggests that it not only plays a structural role but also mediates regulation of the p125 ↔ Pol ζ switch via a change in its oxidation state.

This mechanism explains the genetic data on the role of all three subunits of Pol δ in TLS in yeast, especially the involvement of the Pol δ C-subunit ( 16 , 17 , 36 – 39 ). The importance of the C-subunit in TLS is probably due to its strong interaction with PCNA and also its role in stabilizing the B-subunit. Although Pol δ can bind PCNA via its three subunits simultaneously, the C-subunit plays a critical role in anchoring Pol δ to the replisome (mutasome), especially when the catalytic subunit dissociates during lesion bypass ( 40 , 41 ). Consistent with our proposed mechanism, the p12 subunit, which binds simultaneously to the p125 and p50 subunits in human Pol δ, was found to dissociate from the replicative complex upon treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents ( 42 , 43 ).

Recently, it was shown that yeast Rev1 interacts with the Pol δ C-subunit (Pol32) and may work as a bridge between Pol δ and Pol ζ ( 44 ). In these studies, Pol32 was used without its strong binding partner (Pol31, the B-subunit), which may result in altered protein conformation and properties. The importance of this interaction for TLS was not shown. Moreover, the deletions of Pol32 regions 103–142 (allele −3) and 143–182 (allele −4), which encompass the proposed Rev1-binding domain (residues 100–180), do not affect UV light-induced mutagenesis ( 40 ).

It is worth mentioning that all cumulative evidence obtained so far points to Pol δ as a central regulator of TLS. The mutations affecting the components of Pol δ responsible for polymerase switches abolish all induced mutagenesis in both leading and lagging DNA strands. This suggests either that Pol δ is a main replicase for both DNA strands or that TLS events on the leading strand, when replicated by Pol ϵ, should include the switch for Pol δ as an initiating event ( 4 , 41 , 44 ).
