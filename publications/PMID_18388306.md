Human embryonic stem (hES) cells, derived from blastocysts, are capable of 
unlimited self-renewal and differentiation into all cell lineages of the body. 
Because of their pluripotent nature, hES cells are valuable tools for 
understanding human development and advancing the field of regenerative 
medicine. However, one key to harnessing the therapeutic power of hES cells for 
biomedical applications begins with determining how these cells maintain their 
pluripotent and undifferentiated state. Studies in mice have implicated three 
factors in regulating pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, Oct4, Nanog, and 
Sox2. However, significant differences in growth regulation between mouse 
embryonic stem and hES cells have been identified, suggesting a need to 
determine when and how factors work in hES cells. To date, the transcription 
factors Oct4 and Nanog have been identified as critical regulators of stem cell 
fate by functional studies in hES cells. To determine the role of Sox2 in 
maintaining hES cell pluripotency and self-renewal, we used RNA interference to 
specifically knock down Sox2 gene expression. Reduction of Sox2 expression in 
hES cells results in loss of the undifferentiated stem cell state, as indicated 
by a change in cell morphology, altered stem cell marker expression, and 
increased expression of trophectoderm markers. In addition, knockdown of Sox2 
results in reduced expression of several key stem cell factors, including Oct4 
and Nanog, linking these three factors together in a pluripotent regulatory 
network. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of 
this article.
