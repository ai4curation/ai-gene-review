Bid is a Bcl-2 family protein that promotes apoptosis by activating Bax and 
eliciting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Full-length Bid 
is cleaved in response to apoptotic stimuli into two fragments, p7 and tBid 
(p15), that are held together by strong hydrophobic interactions until the 
complex binds to membranes. The detailed mechanism(s) of fragment separation 
including tBid binding to membranes and release of the p7 fragment to the 
cytoplasm remain unclear. Using liposomes or isolated mitochondria with 
fluorescently labeled proteins at physiological concentrations as in vitro 
models, we report that the two components of the complex quickly separate upon 
interaction with a membrane. Once tBid binds to the membrane, it undergoes slow 
structural rearrangements that result in an equilibrium between two major tBid 
conformations on the membrane. The conformational change of tBid is a 
prerequisite for interaction with Bax and is, therefore, a novel step that can 
be modulated to promote or inhibit MOMP. Using automated high-throughput image 
analysis in cells, we show that down-regulation of Mtch2 causes a significant 
delay between tBid and Bax relocalization in cells. We propose that by promoting 
insertion of tBid via a conformational change at the mitochondrial outer 
membrane, Mtch2 accelerates tBid-mediated Bax activation and MOMP. Thus the 
interaction of Mtch2 and tBid is a potential target for therapeutic control of 
Bid initiated cell death.
