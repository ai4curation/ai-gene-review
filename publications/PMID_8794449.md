Senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) is a calcium binding protein also called 
regucalcin. The amounts of SMP30 decrease androgen-independently with aging in 
the livers of rats. We have studied the expression of SMP30 in livers and 
kidneys of rats from the embryonic to the senescent stages of life. No 
transcript was detected in livers or kidneys in day 18 embryos. However, 
Northern blot analysis showed a marked increase of SMP30 mRNA in livers of 
neonatal and young rats. The first peak of SMP30 transcript was found in a 
5-day-old neonate, in which the amount of mRNA was threefold higher in 
comparison with 3- to 6.5-month-old adults. The expression of SMP30 protein 
started to increase from day 7 and rapidly reached a plateau at day 10. The 
substantial amounts of protein and transcript were maintained in adults up to 
3-6.5 months of age. In the kidney, SMP30 mRNA and protein started to increase 
at day 21 and reached near-maximal levels at day 35. The levels of transcript 
and protein remained high in adults up to 3 months of age. As the aging process 
progressed to senescent stages, the levels of transcript and protein decreased 
significantly in the liver and kidney of aged rats. Therefore, the 
age-associated decrease of SMP30 in the liver and kidney may be, in a large 
part, controlled at transcriptional levels. Furthermore, immunohistochemical 
analysis showed a similar pattern of changes in SMP30 protein expression during 
neonate, adult and senescent stages in hepatocytes and renal proximal tubular 
epithelia. The high expression of SMP30 in the tissue-maturing process and 
adulthood suggests that SMP30 may be required for the maintenance of highly 
differentiated hepatic and renal functions.
