The interaction of dopamine and glutamate in limbic brain regions mediates 
behaviors associated with psychostimulants, which act in part to increase 
dopamine signaling at both D1 receptors (D1Rs) and D2 receptors. Many addictive 
behaviors are a result of learned associations, and NMDA receptor activation has 
been shown to be important for these behaviors. We hypothesized that if NMDA 
receptor activation in dopamine receptor-containing cells is required for the 
addictive properties of psychostimulants, then mice with reduced NMDA receptor 
activity in D1R-containing cells would have attenuated long-term behavioral 
changes to these drugs. We generated a mouse line in which D1R-containing cells 
express an NR1 NMDA receptor subunit containing a mutation in the pore that 
reduces calcium flux. Mice expressing the mutant NMDA receptors in 
D1R-containing cells have normal basal activity and display similar increases in 
locomotor activity when treated with acute amphetamine or cocaine. However, the 
mutant mice fail to display locomotor sensitization to repeated cocaine 
administration. In addition, these mice also have a decreased ability to form a 
conditioned place preference to cocaine. These data suggest that intact NMDA 
receptor signaling in D1R-containing cells is required for the manifestation of 
behaviors associated with repeated drug exposure.
