The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor FOXO1 functions as a tumor 
suppressor by regulating expression of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle 
arrest and oxidative detoxification. Here, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent 
kinase 1 (CDK1) specifically phosphorylates FOXO1 at serine 249 (S249) in vitro 
and in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that both endogenous CDK1 
and ectopically expressed CDK1 form a protein complex with FOXO1 in prostate 
cancer (PCa) cells. In vitro protein binding assays reveal that CDK1 interacts 
directly with FOXO1. Accordingly, overexpression of CDK1 inhibits the 
transcriptional activity of FOXO1 in PCa cells through S249 phosphorylation on 
FOXO1. Consistent with the roles of FOXO3a and FOXO4 (two other members of the 
FOXO family) in cell cycle regulation, forced expression of FOXO1 causes a delay 
in the transition from G2 to M phase. This effect is blocked completely by 
overexpression of CDK1 and cyclin B1. Ectopic expression of constitutively 
active CDK1 also inhibits FOXO1-induced apoptosis in PCa cells. Moreover, we 
demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of FOXO1 on Ras oncogene-induced colony 
formation in fibroblasts is diminished by overexpression of CDK1. Given that 
CDK1 and cyclin B1 are often overexpressed in human cancers including PCa, our 
findings suggest that aberrant activation of CDK1 may contribute to 
tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation and survival via phosphorylation 
and inhibition of FOXO1.
