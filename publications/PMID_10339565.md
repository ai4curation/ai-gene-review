To investigate the molecular basis of PTEN-mediated tumor suppression, we 
introduced a null mutation into the mouse Pten gene by homologous recombination 
in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Pten-/- ES cells exhibited an increased growth 
rate and proliferated even in the absence of serum. ES cells lacking PTEN 
function also displayed advanced entry into S phase. This accelerated G1/S 
transition was accompanied by down-regulation of p27(KIP1), a major inhibitor 
for G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. Inactivation of PTEN in ES cells and in 
embryonic fibroblasts resulted in elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol 
3,4,5,-trisphosphate, a product of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase. Consequently, 
PTEN deficiency led to dosage-dependent increases in phosphorylation and 
activation of Akt/protein kinase B, a well-characterized target of the 
phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signaling pathway. Akt activation increased Bad 
phosphorylation and promoted Pten-/- cell survival. Our studies suggest that 
PTEN regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3,4, 5,-trisphosphate and Akt signaling 
pathway and consequently modulates two critical cellular processes: cell cycle 
progression and cell survival.
