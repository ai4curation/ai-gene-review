Enlargement of the stress-bearing murein sacculus of bacteria depends on the 
coordinated interaction of murein synthases and hydrolases. To understand the 
mechanism of interaction of these two classes of proteins affinity 
chromatography and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies were performed. The 
membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase MltA when covalently linked to 
CNBr-activated Sepharose specifically retained the penicillin-binding proteins 
(PBPs) 1B, 1C, 2, and 3 from a crude Triton X-100 membrane extract of 
Escherichia coli. In the presence of periplasmic proteins also PBP1A was 
specifically bound. At least five different non-PBPs showed specificity for 
MltA-Sepharose. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of one of these proteins 
could be obtained, and the corresponding gene was mapped at 40 min on the E. 
coli genome. This MltA-interacting protein, named MipA, in addition binds to 
PBP1B, a bifunctional murein transglycosylase/transpeptidase. SPR studies with 
PBP1B immobilized to ampicillin-coated sensor chips showed an oligomerization of 
PBP1B that may indicate a dimerization. Simultaneous application of MipA and 
MltA onto a PBP1B sensor chip surface resulted in the formation of a trimeric 
complex. The dissociation constant was determined to be about 10(-6) M. The 
formation of a complex between a murein polymerase (PBP1B) and a murein 
hydrolase (MltA) in the presence of MipA represents a first step in a 
reconstitution of the hypothetical murein-synthesizing holoenzyme, postulated to 
be responsible for controlled growth of the stress-bearing sacculus of E. coli.
