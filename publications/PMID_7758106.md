In several pedigrees of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), point 
mutations in the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene are genetically 
linked to the disease. This finding implicates APP in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease in these individuals. To understand the in vivo function of 
APP and its processing, we have generated an APP-null mutation in mice. 
Homozygous APP-deficient mice were viable and fertile. However, the mutant 
animals weighed 15%-20% less than age-matched wild-type controls. Neurological 
evaluation showed that the APP-deficient mice exhibited a decreased locomotor 
activity and forelimb grip strength, indicating a compromised neuronal or 
muscular function. In addition, four out of six homozygous mice showed reactive 
gliosis at 14 weeks of age, suggesting an impaired neuronal function as a result 
of the APP-null mutation.
