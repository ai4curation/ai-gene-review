The BamA protein of Escherichia coli plays a central role in the assembly of 
β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs). The C-terminal domain of BamA folds 
into an integral outer membrane β-barrel, and the N terminus forms a periplasmic 
polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domain for OMP reception and assembly. 
We show here that BamA misfolding, caused by the deletion of the R44 residue 
from the α2 helix of the POTRA 1 domain (ΔR44), can be overcome by the insertion 
of alanine 2 residues upstream or downstream from the ΔR44 site. This highlights 
the importance of the side chain orientation of the α2 helix residues for normal 
POTRA 1 activity. The ΔR44-mediated POTRA folding defect and its correction by 
the insertion of alanine were further demonstrated by using a construct 
expressing just the soluble POTRA domain. Besides misfolding, the expression of 
BamA(ΔR44) from a low-copy-number plasmid confers a severe drug hypersensitivity 
phenotype. A spontaneous drug-resistant revertant of BamA(ΔR44) was found to 
carry an A18S substitution in the α1 helix of POTRA 1. In the BamA(ΔR44, A18S) 
background, OMP biogenesis improved dramatically, and this correlated with 
improved BamA folding, BamA-SurA interactions, and LptD (lipopolysaccharide 
transporter) biogenesis. The presence of the A18S substitution in the wild-type 
BamA protein did not affect the activity of BamA. The discovery of the A18S 
substitution in the α1 helix of the POTRA 1 domain as a suppressor of the 
folding defect caused by ΔR44 underscores the importance of the helix 1 and 2 
regions in BamA folding.
