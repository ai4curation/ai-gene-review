Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by neuronal cell death, and oxidative stress 
and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be responsible for onset of PD. 
DJ-1, a causative gene product of a familial form of Parkinson's disease, PARK7, 
plays roles in transcriptional regulation and anti-oxidative stress. The 
possible mitochondrial function of DJ-1 has been proposed, but its exact 
function remains unclear. In this study, we found that DJ-1 directly bound to 
NDUFA4 and ND1, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-encoding subunits of mitochondrial 
complex I, respectively, and was colocalized with complex I and that complex I 
activity was reduced in DJ-1-knockdown NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells. These findings 
suggest that DJ-1 is an integral mitochondrial protein and that DJ-1 plays a 
role in maintenance of mitochondrial complex I activity.
