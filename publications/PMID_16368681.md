Native disulfide bond formation in eukaryotes is dependent on protein-disulfide 
isomerase (PDI) and its homologs, which contain varying combinations of 
catalytically active and inactive thioredoxin domains. However, the specific 
contribution of PDI to the formation of new disulfides versus 
reduction/rearrangement of non-native disulfides is poorly understood. We 
analyzed the role of individual PDI domains in disulfide bond formation in a 
reaction driven by their natural oxidant, Ero1p. We found that Ero1p oxidizes 
the isolated PDI catalytic thioredoxin domains, A and A' at the same rate. In 
contrast, we found that in the context of full-length PDI, there is an asymmetry 
in the rate of oxidation of the two active sites. This asymmetry is the result 
of a dual effect: an enhanced rate of oxidation of the second catalytic (A') 
domain and the substrate-mediated inhibition of oxidation of the first catalytic 
(A) domain. The specific order of thioredoxin domains in PDI is important in 
establishing the asymmetry in the rate of oxidation of the two active sites thus 
allowing A and A', two thioredoxin domains that are similar in sequence and 
structure, to serve opposing functional roles as a disulfide isomerase and 
disulfide oxidase, respectively. These findings reveal how native disulfide 
folding is accomplished in the endoplasmic reticulum and provide a context for 
understanding the proliferation of PDI homologs with combinatorial arrangements 
of thioredoxin domains.
