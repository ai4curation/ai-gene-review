Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) is a transcriptional co-regulator and an 
E3 ligase. Here, we show that MKRN1 simultaneously functions as a differentially 
negative regulator of p53 and p21. In normal conditions, MKRN1 could destabilize 
both p53 and p21 through ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. As 
a result, depletion of MKRN1 induced growth arrest through activation of p53 and 
p21. Interestingly, MKRN1 used earlier unknown sites, K291 and K292, for p53 
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Under severe stress conditions, 
however, MKRN1 primarily induced the efficient degradation of p21. This 
regulatory process contributed to the acceleration of DNA damage-induced 
apoptosis by eliminating p21. MKRN1 depletion diminished adriamycin or 
ultraviolet-induced cell death, whereas ectopic expression of MKRN1 facilitated 
apoptosis. Furthermore, MKRN1 stable cell lines that constantly produced low 
levels of p53 and p21 exhibited stabilization of p53, but not p21, with 
increased cell death on DNA damage. Our results indicate that MKRN1 exhibits 
dual functions of keeping cells alive by suppressing p53 under normal conditions 
and stimulating cell death by repressing p21 under stress conditions.

Introduction

p53 has important functions for tumour suppression, which is accomplished by the induction of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis in response to various cellular stresses, including DNA damage, oncogenic stress, telomere dysfunction, and hypoxia ( Vogelstein et al , 2000 ; Bode and Dong, 2004 ; Lavin and Gueven, 2006 ; Vousden and Lane, 2007 ). On account of these cytotoxic effects, strict controls of its steady-state levels and activities exist in normal cells. One of the representative examples of cell protection from p53-mediated cytotoxicity is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which removes p53 from the cell. Hdm2, the first identified E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53, is a major protein that facilitates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 ( Haupt et al , 1997 ; Honda et al , 1997 ; Kubbutat et al , 1997 ). Nevertheless, p53 is degraded in Mdm2-null tissues, although it not as efficient as in wild-type tissues ( Ringshausen et al , 2006 ). Furthermore, other E3 ligases, such as pirh2, COP1, and ARF-BP1, stimulate p53 ubiquitination and degradation ( Leng et al , 2003 ; Dornan et al , 2004 ; Chen et al , 2005 ). In addition, a variety of p53 cofactors, including ARF, MdmX, PML, ATM, and ribosomal proteins, are involved in the regulatory pathways affecting stabilization of p53 ( Lavin and Gueven, 2006 ).

Although transcriptional activation of p53 is restricted by several E3 ligases and cofactors under normal conditions, p53 can escape from the numerous negative regulatory pathways under stress conditions ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ; Dornan et al , 2006 ). Post-translational modification of p53 accompanying phosphorylation and acetylation enables p53 to resist the attack of E3 ligases, resulting in the induction of cellular responses ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ; Dornan et al , 2006 ; Tang et al , 2008 ). The responses against p53-dependent stress signals result in the production of hundreds of p53 target genes, which introduce differentiated and graded responses against different stress levels. Indeed, many cofactors and specific modifiers of p53, such as HIPK2, p63, p73, JMY, and ASPP, differentially regulate the responses mediated by p53 activation ( Oren, 2003 ; Rodier et al , 2007 ).

Among p53 target genes, p21 (also called WAF1 or CIP1) is considered to be one of the key factors differentiating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. p21 was first recognized as a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) ( Gartel and Radhakrishnan, 2005 ). p21 overexpression induces G1, G2, or S phase arrest, whereas p21-deficient cells display a defect in DNA damage-induced G1 and G2 arrest ( Gartel and Radhakrishnan, 2005 ). Furthermore, sustained activation of p21 can lead to permanent cellular senescence ( Chang et al , 2000 ; Roninson, 2002 ). However, inactivation or depletion of p21 sensitizes cells to apoptosis under conditions of low DNA damage, which induces cell cycle arrest in p21-positive cells ( Waldman et al , 1996 ; Zhang et al , 1999 ; Mahyar-Roemer and Roemer, 2001 ; Han et al , 2002 ; Javelaud and Besancon, 2002 ; Martinez et al , 2002 ). Similarly, p21 deficiency decreases tumourigenesis and increases sensitivity to apoptosis in MMTV-Ras mice and ATM-deficient mice ( Wang et al , 1997 ; Bearss et al , 2002 ). In contrast, ectopically expressed p21 delays apoptosis induced by several kinds of DNA damage in various cell lines and in a xenograft mouse model ( Gorospe et al , 1996 , 1997 ). Clinical data also support the observation that tumours overexpressing p21 are more resistant to chemotherapeutic treatment ( Aaltomaa et al , 1999 ; Baretton et al , 1999 ). Consistent with these findings, p21 accumulation is evident in several tumours ( Erber et al , 1997 ; Fizazi et al , 2002 ). As p21 functions as a mediator of cell cycle arrest and an inhibitor of apoptosis, the levels and activities of p21 are thought be regulated by different levels of DNA damage. The steady-state levels of p21 decrease with lethal doses of adriamycin, whereas they increase in the presence of sub-lethal doses ( Martinez et al , 2002 ). Recently, p21 transcription was shown to be repressed under lethal DNA damage by several transcriptional cofactors, such as Myc, Miz, Zbtb4, and Pdcd4 ( Seoane et al , 2002 ; Bitomsky et al , 2008 ; Weber et al , 2008 ). Furthermore, p21 is inactivated through caspase-3-mediated cleavage or proteasome-dependent degradation to undergo efficient apoptosis ( Zhang et al , 1999 ; Bloom et al , 2003 ; Jin et al , 2003 ; Nishitani et al , 2008 ).

Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) was first identified as an intron-containing source gene for the MKRN gene family, the majority of which has been identified as being intronless and imprinted ( Gray et al , 2000 ). The MKRN family contains several C3H, C3HC4, and unique Cys-His motifs, all of which are highly conserved from invertebrate to vertebrate species ( Gray et al , 2000 ). Furthermore, MKRN1 is constitutively expressed in various human and mouse tissues from fetus to adult ( Gray et al , 2000 ). Recently, MKRN1 was shown to act as an E3 ligase for hTERT, and the transcriptional co-regulator of androgen receptor and retinoic acid receptor ( Kim et al , 2005 ; Omwancha et al , 2006 ). However, the cellular and physiological function(s) of MKRN1 is yet to be defined.

Here, we report new roles of MKRN1 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for both p53 and p21. Ablation of MKRN1 resulted in cellular growth defect with the stabilization of p53 and p21. Interestingly, MKRN1 was able to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of both p53 and p21. Although the negative regulatory effects on p53 by MKRN1 were disrupted under DNA-damaging stresses, MKRN1 was still able to mediate destabilization of p21. Accordingly, knockdown of MKRN1 attenuated adriamycin-induced apoptosis, which is due in part to up-regulated levels of p21. Taken together, our data indicate that MKRN1 is a novel modulator of p53 and p21, preferentially leading cells to p53-dependent apoptosis by suppressing p21.

Discussion

To repress p53 activities as a tumour suppressor, polyubiquitination-mediated degradation of p53 is usually used as a critical event. Hdm2 (human Mdm2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing a ring finger domain, is a major negative mediator for p53 ubiquitination and degradation ( Bode and Dong, 2004 ; Brooks and Gu, 2006 ; Lee et al , 2006 ). Hdm2 was initially reported to target six lysine residues located at the C-terminus of p53 for ubiquitination ( Rodriguez et al , 2000 ). However, numerous studies have suggested that the six C-terminal lysines might not be the only sites for p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Indeed, the p53 6KR mutant, which has its six lysine residues substituted with arginine, can still be ubiquitinated and degraded in cells, although less effectively ( Camus et al , 2003 ; Tang et al , 2008 ). Furthermore, emerging evidence shows that there might exist various p53's E3 ligases, such as pirh2, COP1, and ARF-BP1 ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ). Indeed, E4F1 and MSL2 ubiquitinate p53 at the sites different from six conventional lysine residues, although these ubiquitination does not lead to the degradation process ( Le Cam et al , 2006 ; Kruse and Gu, 2009 ). Together, p53 can be ubiquitinated at the multiple sites by the numerous E3 ligases to be controlled elaborately.

Here, we have identified MKRN1 as another E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53. Interestingly, MKRN1 could induce degradation and ubiquitination of the p53 6KR mutant ( Figure 4D and E ). Observations that MKRN1 could degrade p53 without its six lysines at the C-terminus led us to identify two novel ubiquitination sites, K291 and K292, on p53 ( Figure 4B ). These two lysines are highly conserved in most species that express p53 ( Figure 4C ), and are also mutated in human cancers, implicating possibly yet unknown critical roles for K291 and K292 in p53 function ( http://p53.free.fr ). As lysine residues also can be post-translationally modified by acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, and neddylation, it is plausible that these modifications compete with MKRN1-dependent ubiquitination for the control of p53 activities.

MKRN1 also seems to have an ubiquitination-independent role for suppressing p53 activities similarly to Hdm2 ( Minsky and Oren, 2004 ; Ohkubo et al , 2006 ; Tang et al , 2008 ). Transcriptional activity of the p53 2KR mutant that is considerably resistant to MKRN1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation was suppressed by MKRN1 ( Supplementary Figure S8A and B ). In addition, the E3 ligase-deficient mutant MKRN1 was also able to suppress activation of a p53-dependent reporter promoter ( Supplementary Figure S8C ). These data imply that MKRN1, similar to Hdm2, could negatively regulate transcriptional activities of p53 through direct interaction ( Minsky and Oren, 2004 ; Ohkubo et al , 2006 ; Tang et al , 2008 ). As a result, the ubiquitination-dependent and -independent roles of MKRN1 on the negative regulation of p53 prevent improper activation of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in unstressed cells. On the other hand, ablation of MKRN1 resulted in p53 and p21 up-regulation, and led to growth arrest in p53-positive cells.

Most E3 ubiquitin ligases for p53, such as Hdm2, Pirh2, and COP1, have also been reported to be transcriptionally regulated by p53, and thus, forming a negative regulatory feedback loop ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ). However, there is no difference in expression of MKRN1 in p53-positive and -negative HCT116 pair cell lines ( Supplementary Figure S2C ). Similarly, H1299 cells, which lack p53 express a considerable amount of MKRN1 ( Figure 1D ). Furthermore, the MKRN1 promoter also has no putative p53-binding site suggesting that MKRN1 might not to be a target of p53.

In this report, we have also identified p21 as a target of MKRN1. MKRN1 binds to and degrades p21 by inducing its polyubiquitination. Even though p21 is truly ubiquitinated in cells, it is still controversial whether ubiquitination is required for p21 degradation ( Sheaff et al , 2000 ; Bloom et al , 2003 ; Jin et al , 2003 , 2008 ; Nishitani et al , 2008 ). As a p21 mutant with all lysine residues mutated to arginine is still degraded, ubiquitination of p21 seems to be dispensable for certain degradation pathways ( Jin et al , 2003 ). Supporting this idea, it has been observed that no E3 ligase activities of Mdm2 and Mdmx are required for the degradation of p21 ( Jin et al , 2003 ). On the other hand, several reports have suggested the necessity of p21 ubiquitination for its degradation through other E3 ligases ( Maki and Howley, 1997 ; Fukuchi et al , 1999 ; Nakanishi et al , 2000 ; Nishitani et al , 2008 ). Our results indicate that MKRN1 mediates ubiquitination-dependent degradation of p21 as MKRN1 defective in E3 ligase activity is unable to induce p21 degradation as well as its ubiquitination.

Down-regulation of p21 under DNA-damaging stress is considered as an important step for facilitating efficient apoptosis, as the existence of p21 can stimulate a cells' responses towards cell cycle arrest through the suppression of apoptosis ( Zhang et al , 1999 ; Gartel and Tyner, 2002 ; Han et al , 2002 ; Javelaud and Besancon, 2002 ; Martinez et al , 2002 ; Hill et al , 2008 ). Although inhibition of p21 activity through the transcriptional inhibition by Myc, Miz1, Ztbt4, Pdcd4, or the cleavage of p21 by caspase-3 are known to take place under apoptotic stimuli ( Zhang et al , 1999 ; Seoane et al , 2002 ; Bitomsky et al , 2008 ; Weber et al , 2008 ), our data indicate that MKRN1-mediated p21 ubiquitination and degradation are also important processes for inducing apoptosis. The importance of MKRN1-dependent p21 degradation is highlighted by the observations that MKRN1 knockdown resulted in p21 stabilization and prevention of DNA damage-induced apoptosis ( Figure 5 ).

Activity of MKRN1 also seems to be regulated in multiple ways. DNA-damaging stress impaired the function of MKRN1 related to p53 degradation ( Figure 5A–C ). However, MKRN1 was able to degrade p21 under stress conditions ( Figures 5E and 7B ; Supplementary Figure S7A ), indicating that there might be separate regulatory pathways that control the function of MKRN1 towards p53 and p21 under stress conditions. Furthermore, we constantly observed a rapid decrease in the levels of MKRN1 at the later stage of stress, suggesting possible destabilizing mechanisms of MKRN1 ( Figure 7D ).

MKRN1 is highly conserved in vertebrates. Human MKRN1 is 92% identical (94% similar) and 73% identical (80% similar) at the amino-acid level to mouse MKRN1 and chicken MKRN1, respectively ( Gray et al , 2000 ). Drosophila and C. elegans also express MKRN1 orthologues. Although MKRN1 in these species is only 27 and 25% identical (40 and 38% similar) at the amino-acid level, respectively, to human MKRN1, these MKRN1 orthologues have six zinc-finger motifs that are >70% similar to those of human MKRN1. As explained above, two lysine residues of p53, which are regulated by MKRN1 in human beings, were also conserved from C. elegans to human beings ( Figure 4C ). Thus, it should be investigated whether MKRN1 in lower species is also involved in the control of p53 activity through the regulation of these two conserved lysines. It is also interesting to note that among various p53 E3 ligases, only MKRN1 and ARF-BP1 are conserved from C. elegans to human beings. As Hdm2 and COP1 have no orthologue in Drosophila and C. elegans , and Pirh2 can be found in Drosophila , MKRN1 and ARF-BP1 might be ancient regulators of p53 ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ). Similar to ARF-BP1, MKRN1 is not regulated by p53, whereas Mdm2, COP1, and pirh2 display a p53-dependent feedback loop ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that MKRN1 might be indirectly regulated by p53 target proteins under stress conditions. These observations indicate how various p53 E3 ligases are functionally evolved from different species.

Overall, the comprehensive function of MKRN1 can be described as follows. Under normal conditions, MKRN1 is able to suppress p53 and p21 by ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Specifically, MKRN1 targets lysines on residues 291 and 292 of p53 for polyubiquitination ( Figure 8 , left panel). Furthermore, its binding to p53 prevents the transcriptional activities of p53 ( Supplementary Figure S8 ). This inhibition ensures the regular growth of normal cells under unstressed conditions. Under stress conditions, MKRN1 ceases to have a negative effect on p53, allowing p53 to proceed with its cytotoxic effects on cells. However, the regulatory effect of MKRN1 on p21 is still active, preventing an excessive accumulation of p21 and, thus, stimulating the apoptotic process if necessary ( Figure 8 , right panel). The continuous destabilization of p21 by MKRN1 seems to be required to help cells become more susceptible to apoptotic stimuli.

MKRN1 is expressed in most human tissues, such as heart, brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas ( Gray et al , 2000 ). It has yet to be identified whether these endogenous MKRN1 have different roles in determining the fate of cells other than the ones suggested here. As MKRN1 seems to be tightly related to the maintenance of homeostasis for p53 and p21 as well as hTERT ( Kim et al , 2005 ), future studies need to be extended further to investigate its role in cellular ageing and death process in the primary cells as well as in stem cells in various organs.

Our results identify the evolutionary conserved MKRN1 as a novel regulator of p53 and p21, which mediates p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It seems that MKRN1 differently regulates p53 and p21 under different stresses, thus having an important function in facilitating p53-dependent apoptotic pathways. Eventually, these observations are expected to provide novel therapeutic targets for tumourigenesis.
