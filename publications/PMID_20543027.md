Abstract

Ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and the formation of specific ubiquitin chain topologies have been implicated in various cellular processes. Little is known, however, about the role of ubiquitin in the development of cellular organelles. Here, we identify and characterize the deubiquitinating enzyme AMSH3 from Arabidopsis thaliana . AMSH3 hydrolyzes K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro and accumulates both ubiquitin chain types in vivo. amsh3 mutants fail to form a central lytic vacuole, accumulate autophagosomes, and mis-sort vacuolar protein cargo to the intercellular space. Furthermore, AMSH3 is required for efficient endocytosis of the styryl dye FM4-64 and the auxin efflux facilitator PIN2. We thus present evidence for a role of deubiquitination in intracellular trafficking and vacuole biogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

Ubiquitin conjugation and the formation of ubiquitin chains with different linkage topologies have been associated with different biological processes ( Kerscher et al., 2006 ). Best understood is the role of K48-linked ubiquitin chains in targeting proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome ( Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998 ). However, in recent years a range of additional ubiquitin (chain) functions have been uncovered in the regulation of other cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, protein kinase activation, DNA repair, and chromatin dynamics ( Acconcia et al., 2009 ; Chen and Sun, 2009 ). In yeast and animal cells, monoubiquitination or the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains initiates the endocytosis of proteins and thereby promotes the degradation of these proteins in the vacuole or lysosome ( Mukhopadhyay and Riezman, 2007 ). Endocytosis is promoted by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) 0, I, II, and III. Several proteins of the ESCRT machinery have ubiquitin binding domains that provide the critical affinity for (poly-)ubiquitinated cargo.

Ubiquitination is a reversible process, and monoubiquitin and ubiquitin chains are hydrolyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). DUBs serve to counterbalance ubiquitination within a cell and contribute to the regulation of cellular processes and to the maintenance of free ubiquitin pools ( Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009 ). Eukaryotic DUBs can be classified into five distinct families based on their active site and domain organization ( Komander et al., 2009 ). We are particularly interested in metalloprotease DUBs with an MPN+/JAMM domain (MPR1, PAD1 N-terminal+/JAB1/MPN/MOV34; hitherto MPN+ domain) ( Maytal-Kivity et al., 2002 ; Ambroggio et al., 2004 ; Clague and Urbe, 2006 ; Komander et al., 2009 ). To date, the best-studied MPN+ domain proteins are the evolutionarily conserved RPN11/Poh and CSN5/Jab1: RPN11/Poh1 hydrolyzes ubiquitin chains prior to protein degradation by the 26S proteasome, and CSN5/Jab1 removes the ubiquitin-related protein NEDD8 from the cullin subunit of E3 ligases ( Cope et al., 2002 ; Verma et al., 2002 ). Four additional MPN+ domain proteins, namely, AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) and the related AMSH-LP (AMSH-LIKE PROTEIN) as well as Brcc36/c6.1 and 2A-DUB/KIAA1915, have so far been characterized only in mammalian cells ( Tanaka et al., 1999 ; Cope et al., 2002 ; Maytal-Kivity et al., 2002 ; Dong et al., 2003 ; Kikuchi et al., 2003 ; McCullough et al., 2004 ; Cooper et al., 2009 ).

Human ( Homo sapiens ) AMSH and AMSH-LP hydrolyze K63-linked ubiquitin chains, suggesting that these proteins function in processes, such as endocytosis, that require K63-linked ubiquitin chains ( Tanaka et al., 1999 ; Ishii et al., 2001 ; McCullough et al., 2004 , 2006 ; Sato et al., 2008 ). The proposed role of Hs-AMSH in endocytosis is supported by the finding that Hs-AMSH interacts with clathrin, with ESCRT-0, and with ESCRT-III subunits ( Agromayor and Martin-Serrano, 2006 ; Kyuuma et al., 2007 ; Ma et al., 2007 ; Row et al., 2007 ). The nature of these interactions together with a number of functional studies has given rise to a model whereby Hs-AMSH has two mutually nonexclusive functions at distinct steps of endocytosis ( Clague and Urbe, 2006 ): First, the Hs-AMSH–dependent deubiquitination of endocytosed cargo at ESCRT-0 may promote cargo recycling to the plasma membrane; second, Hs-AMSH may recycle ubiquitin by deubiquitinating endocytosed cargo prior to its sorting to the multivesicular bodies at ESCRT-III. The homolog of Hs-AMSH in mouse ( Mus musculus ) is essential for postnatal growth; however, its role in development remains to be elucidated ( Ishii et al., 2001 ).

In Arabidopsis thaliana , three proteins, AMSH1, AMSH2, and AMSH3, have significant sequence similarity to Hs-AMSH and Hs-AMSH-LP. Through the analysis of plants expressing inactive variants of these proteins, we identified AMSH3 as a major Arabidopsis DUB that hydrolyzes K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that AMSH3 is essential for proper vacuole biogenesis, trafficking from the Golgi to the vacuole and the vacuolar trafficking of endocytosed cargo.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we analyzed the Arabidopsis DUB AMSH3, which hydrolyzes K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Using ubiquitin chain-type specific antibodies, we further show that amsh3 mutants accumulate protein conjugates with both ubiquitin chain topologies in vivo. Hs-AMSH and Hs-AMSH-LP had previously been reported to hydrolyze specifically K63-linked ubiquitin chains, and in the case of Hs-AMSH-LP, this finding is supported by a structural analysis, which had identified several amino acids in Hs-AMSH-LP that participate in the binding of K63-linked diubiquitin ( Sato et al., 2008 ). Interestingly, we found that most relevant residues are also conserved in Arabidopsis AMSH3, thus suggesting that AMSH3 and Hs-AMSH employ a similar mechanism for the hydrolysis of K63-linked ubiquitin chains (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). However, the identity of the AMSH3 residues that may participate in the binding of K48-linked chains cannot be predicted based on the present data; thus, the apparent difference between the substrate specificities of human AMSH and AMSH3 remains to be elucidated.

AMSH3 lacks three functional domains that have been reported for Hs-AMSH, namely, an NLS, an SBM, and a clathrin binding site. In agreement with the absence of an NLS in AMSH3, and in contrast with Hs-AMSH, we found AMSH3 to localize exclusively to the cytoplasm. In the context of the absence of the SBM, it is also noteworthy that there are no apparent homologs of the ESCRT-0 subunits STAM and HRS in plants. Whereas plant proteins have been identified as predicted functional homologs of all ESCRT-I, -II, and -III subunits, plant ESCRT-0 subunits share only very limited homology to their yeast and human counterparts ( Winter and Hauser, 2006 ). In contrast with the human AMSH, which had been reported to interact with ESCRT subunits, we did not find any ESCRT subunit interactions following AMSH3 immunoprecipitation, suggesting that AMSH3 is not stably associated with ESCRT complexes in planta.

Vacuoles are organelles that occupy most of the cellular volume in plant and yeast cells, and they are indispensable for growth in plants but not in yeast ( Rojo et al., 2001 ). In contrast with yeast, in which vacuolar biogenesis is comparatively well understood, little is known about vacuolar biogenesis in plants. Many of the >40 vacuolar protein sorting proteins required for vacuolar protein sorting in yeast participate in the transport to the vacuole, either through the Golgi or by endocytosis ( Bankaitis et al., 1986 ; Rothman and Stevens, 1986 ; Raymond et al., 1992 ). However, as yet, no DUB has been shown to be required for vacuolar biogenesis in this organism. In turn, apparent VPS protein homologs, such as VPS16 (VCL1), VPS29, VPS35, and VPS45, have been implicated in vacuolar biogenesis in plants, particularly in Arabidopsis , suggesting that there are significant parallels between yeast and plant vacuolar biogenesis ( Rojo et al., 2001 ; Shimada et al., 2006 ; Sanmartin et al., 2007 ; Ebine et al., 2008 ; Yamazaki et al., 2008 ; Zouhar et al., 2009 ). Interestingly, AMSH3 itself does not have a recognizable homolog in S. cerevisiae . The yeast mutant of the DUB Doa4p, which has a role in the deubiquitination of endocytosed cargo and is homologous to human UBPY, has normal vacuolar morphology ( Reggiori and Pelham, 2001 ). Based on our data, we propose that vacuole biogenesis and possibly membrane fusion events required for vacuole biogenesis require deubiquitination by AMSH3 in planta. Future experiments are needed to reveal the identity of the ubiquitin conjugates whose deubiquitination is essential for proper cellular trafficking and vacuole biogenesis.
