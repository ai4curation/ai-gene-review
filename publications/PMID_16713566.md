OCA-B was originally identified as a nuclear transcriptional coactivator that is 
essential for antigen-driven immune responses. The later identification of a 
membrane bound, myristoylated form of OCA-B suggested additional, unique 
functions in B cell signaling pathways. This study has shown that OCA-B also 
functions in the pre-B1-to-pre-B2 cell transition and, most surprisingly, that 
it directly interacts with SYK, a tyrosine kinase critical for pre-BCR and BCR 
signaling. This unprecedented type of interaction-a transcriptional coactivator 
with a signaling kinase-occurs in the cytoplasm and directly regulates SYK 
stability. This study indicates that OCA-B is required for pre-BCR and BCR 
signaling at multiple stages of B cell development through its 
nontranscriptional regulation of SYK. Combined with the deregulation of OCA-B 
target genes, this may help explain the multitude of defects observed in B cell 
development and immune responses of Oca-b-/- mice.
