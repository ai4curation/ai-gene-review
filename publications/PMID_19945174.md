Sperm proteins that interact with zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) have not been clearly 
identified in humans. In the present study, the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system 
was used to identify human sperm proteins that interact with human ZP3. Human 
ZP3 cDNA was cloned into pAS2-1 yeast vector and used as bait to find reactive 
proteins in the human testis cDNA library. Six specific clones were obtained 
that were further confirmed for interaction using the mammalian two-hybrid 
system. These six clones showed homologies with several proteins in the GenBank 
database. Of these, the strongest ZP3-interacting protein, that shows 97% 
homology with ubiquitin associated protein-2 like (UBAP2L), was tested in the 
hemizona assay. UBAP2L antibodies significantly (p<0.001) inhibited human 
sperm-zona binding in this assay. We conclude that the Y2H system is a useful 
strategy for identifying novel genes encoding proteins that interact with ZP 
proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study using the Y2H system to 
identify sperm proteins that interact with human oocyte ZP3. Novel proteins 
identified using this system may find applications in elucidating the 
fertilization cascade, development of a new generation of non-steroidal 
contraceptives, and specific diagnosis and treatment of human infertility.
