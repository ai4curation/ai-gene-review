The role of dopamine D1A receptors in mediating amphetamine-induced 
sensitization was investigated using the D1A-deficient mouse. During the drug 
pre-exposure phase, D1A-deficient and control mice were injected for five 
consecutive days with saline or amphetamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Locomotor activity 
was measured on the first and fifth pre-exposure day. After three abstinence 
days, mice were given either amphetamine or saline and locomotor activity was 
again assessed. Mice were then sacrificed and protein kinase A (PKA) activity 
was measured. In contrast to control mice, D1A-deficient mice did not show a 
progressive increase in locomotor activity across days. Importantly, both 
control and mutant mice did exhibit behavioral sensitization, because mice 
pre-exposed and tested with amphetamine were more active than mice acutely 
tested with the drug. Even so, the amphetamine-induced locomotor activity of the 
mutant mice was significantly reduced when compared with similarly treated 
control mice, indicating that the sensitized response was less pronounced in the 
D1A-deficient mouse. PKA activity also varied depending on genotype, since 
amphetamine decreased PKA activity in control but not D1A-deficient mice.
