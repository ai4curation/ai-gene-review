To identify proteins that participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), 13 endocytic proteins were depleted in 
HeLa cells using highly efficient small interfering RNAs that were designed 
using a novel selection algorithm. The effects of small interfering RNAs on the 
ligand-induced endocytosis of EGFR were compared with those effects on the 
constitutive internalization of the transferrin receptor. The knock-downs of 
clathrin heavy chain and dynamin produced maximal inhibitory effects on the 
internalization of both receptors. Depletion of alpha, beta2, or micro2 subunits 
of AP-2 reduced EGF and transferrin internalization rates by 40-60%. 
Down-regulation of several accessory proteins individually had no effect on 
endocytosis but caused significant inhibition of EGF and transferrin endocytosis 
when the homologous proteins were depleted simultaneously. Surprisingly, 
knockdown of clathrin-assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein, CALM, did not 
influence transferrin endocytosis but considerably affected EGFR 
internalization. Thus, CALM is the second protein besides Grb2 that appears to 
play a specific role in EGFR endocytosis. This study demonstrates that the 
efficient gene silencing by rationally designed small interfering RNA can be 
used as an approach to functionally analyze the entire cellular machineries, 
such as the clathrin-coated pits and vesicles.
