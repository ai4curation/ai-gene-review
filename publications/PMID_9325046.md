Histones are thought to play a key role in regulating gene expression at the 
level of DNA packaging. Recent evidence suggests that transcriptional activation 
requires competition of transcription factors with histones for binding to 
regulatory regions and that there may be several mechanisms by which this is 
achieved. We have characterized a human nucleosome assembly protein, NAP-2, 
previously identified by positional cloning at 11p15.5, a region implicated in 
several disease processes including Wilms tumor (WT) etiology. The deduced amino 
acid sequence of NAP-2 indicates that it encodes a protein with a potential 
nuclear localization motif and two clusters of highly acidic residues. 
Functional analysis of recombinant NAP-2 protein purified from Escherichia coli 
demonstrates that this protein can interact with both core and linker histones. 
We demonstrate that recombinant NAP-2 can transfer histones onto naked DNA 
templates. Deletion mutagenesis of NAP-2 demonstrates that both NH3- and 
COOH-terminal domains are required for histone transfer activity. Subcellular 
localization studies of NAP-2 indicate that it can shuttle between the cytoplasm 
and the nucleus, suggesting a role as a histone chaperone. Given the potential 
role of the human NAP-2 gene (HGMW-approved symbol NAP1L4) in WT etiology, we 
have elucidated the exon/intron structure of this gene and have analyzed the 
mutational status of NAP-2 in sporadic WTs. Our results, coupled with tumor 
suppression assays in G401 WT cells, do not support a role for NAP-2 in the 
etiology of WT. A putative role for NAP-2 in regulating cellular differentiation 
is discussed.
