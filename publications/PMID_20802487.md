The small heat shock protein alphaB-crystallin (alphaB) contributes to cellular 
protection against stress. For decades, high-resolution structural studies on 
oligomeric alphaB have been confounded by its polydisperse nature. Here, we 
present a structural basis of oligomer assembly and activation of the chaperone 
using solid-state NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The basic 
building block is a curved dimer, with an angle of approximately 121 degrees 
between the planes of the beta-sandwich formed by alpha-crystallin domains. The 
highly conserved IXI motif covers a substrate binding site at pH 7.5. We observe 
a pH-dependent modulation of the interaction of the IXI motif with beta4 and 
beta8, consistent with a pH-dependent regulation of the chaperone function. 
N-terminal region residues Ser59-Trp60-Phe61 are involved in intermolecular 
interaction with beta3. Intermolecular restraints from NMR and volumetric 
restraints from SAXS were combined to calculate a model of a 24-subunit alphaB 
oligomer with tetrahedral symmetry.
