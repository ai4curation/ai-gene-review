gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) catalyzes the ATP-dependent 
ligation of L-glutamate and L-cysteine to form L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteine; this 
is the first and rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis. Inhibitors of 
gamma-GCS such as buthionine sulfoximine are widely used as tools for 
elucidating glutathione metabolism in vivo and as pharmacological agents for 
reversing glutathione-based resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy in 
certain cancers. Although gamma-GCS is readily isolated from rat kidneys, future 
drug design efforts are better based on structure-activity relationships 
established with the human enzyme. We report here the coexpression in 
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) of the human gamma-GCS catalytic (heavy) subunit and 
regulatory (light) subunit using pET-3d and pET-9d vectors, respectively. 
Intracellular assembly of the holoenzyme occurred without difficulty, and levels 
of expression were acceptable (approximately 32 mg holoenzyme/100 g cells). 
Recombinant human gamma-GCS was purified to homogeneity in an overall yield of 
45% by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by sequential chromatography on 
Q-Sepharose ion-exchange, Superdex 200 gel filtration and ATP-affinity resins. 
Trace amounts of E. coli gamma-GCS were removed by immunoaffinity 
chromatography. The specific activity of the isolated enzyme was >1500 units/mg, 
comparable to the best preparations from rat kidney. The Km values for 
L-glutamate, L-cysteine, L-gamma-aminobutyrate (an L-cysteine surrogate), and 
ATP are 1.8, 0.1, 1.3, and 0.4 mM, respectively. Recombinant human gamma-GCS, 
like native rat gamma-GCS, is feedback inhibited by glutathione and is potently 
inhibited by buthionine sulfoximine and cystamine.
