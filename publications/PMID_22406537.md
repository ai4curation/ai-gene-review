In Alzheimer disease (AD), amyloid β peptide (Aβ) accumulates in plaques in the 
brain. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) mediates Aβ-induced 
perturbations in cerebral vessels, neurons, and microglia in AD. Here, we 
identified a high-affinity RAGE-specific inhibitor (FPS-ZM1) that blocked Aβ 
binding to the V domain of RAGE and inhibited Aβ40- and Aβ42-induced cellular 
stress in RAGE-expressing cells in vitro and in the mouse brain in vivo. FPS-ZM1 
was nontoxic to mice and readily crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In aged 
APPsw/0 mice overexpressing human Aβ-precursor protein, a transgenic mouse model 
of AD with established Aβ pathology, FPS-ZM1 inhibited RAGE-mediated influx of 
circulating Aβ40 and Aβ42 into the brain. In brain, FPS-ZM1 bound exclusively to 
RAGE, which inhibited β-secretase activity and Aβ production and suppressed 
microglia activation and the neuroinflammatory response. Blockade of RAGE 
actions at the BBB and in the brain reduced Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in brain 
markedly and normalized cognitive performance and cerebral blood flow responses 
in aged APPsw/0 mice. Our data suggest that FPS-ZM1 is a potent multimodal RAGE 
blocker that effectively controls progression of Aβ-mediated brain disorder and 
that it may have the potential to be a disease-modifying agent for AD.
