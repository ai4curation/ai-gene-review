The translocated and normal bcl-2 alleles in the DHL-4 cell line with the 
t(14;18) translocation were separated by pulsed field electrophoresis. An in 
vivo footprint over a cAMP response element (CRE) in the bcl-2 5'-flanking 
sequence was identified on the translocated allele. Electrophoretic mobility 
shift assays with the bcl-2 CRE demonstrated complexes with mobilities identical 
to those with a consensus CRE. UV cross-linking experiments revealed that 
proteins with molecular masses of 34, 43, and 67 kDa bound to the bcl-2 CRE 
site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with an antibody specific to the 
phosphorylated cAMP response-binding protein (CREB) demonstrated that 
phosphorylated CREB was present in DHL-4 cells. Treatment with phorbol 
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) led to an increase in both the amount of 
phosphorylated CREB and the bcl-2 promoter activity. The response to PMA was 
dependent on an intact CRE site. The activity of the bcl-2 promoter was 
increased 20-fold in a construct with the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancers, 
and mutation of the CRE site abolished most of the induction. The addition of 
PMA increased the activity of the bcl-2-immunoglobulin enhancer construct by 
3.5-fold. Access to the CRE site is blocked in the silent normal bcl-2 allele, 
while CREB proteins bind to the site on the translocated allele. We conclude 
that the CRE site functions as a positive regulatory site for the translocated 
bcl-2 allele in t(14;18) lymphomas.
