Familial autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia is associated with high risk 
for cardiovascular accidents and is related to mutations in the low density 
lipoprotein receptor or its ligand apolipoprotein B (apoB). Mutations in a third 
gene, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9), were recently associated 
to this disease. PCSK9 acts as a natural inhibitor of the low density 
lipoprotein receptor pathway, and both genes are regulated by depletion of 
cholesterol cell content and statins, via sterol regulatory element-binding 
protein (SREBP). Here we investigated the regulation of PCSK9 gene expression 
during nutritional changes. We showed that PCSK9 mRNA quantity is decreased by 
73% in mice after 24 h of fasting, leading to a 2-fold decrease in protein 
level. In contrast PCSK9 expression was restored upon high carbohydrate 
refeeding. PCSK9 mRNA increased by 4-5-fold in presence of insulin in rodent 
primary hepatocytes, whereas glucose had no effect. Moreover, insulin 
up-regulated hepatic PCSK9 expression in vivo during a 
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in mice. Adenoviral mediated overexpression of 
a dominant or negative form of SREBP-1c confirmed the implication of this 
transcription factor in insulin-mediated stimulation of PCSK9 expression. Liver 
X receptor agonist T0901317 also regulated PCSK9 expression via this same 
pathway (a 2-fold increase in PCSK9 mRNA of primary hepatocytes cultured for 24 
h in presence of 1 microm T0901317). As our last investigation, we isolated 
PCSK9 proximal promoter and verified the functionality of a SREBP-1c responsive 
element located from 335 bp to 355 bp upstream of the ATG. Together, these 
results show that PCSK9 expression is regulated by nutritional status and 
insulinemia.
