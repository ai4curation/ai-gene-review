Using the yeast two hybrid system, a mouse embryo cDNA library was screened for 
proteins that interact with the C-terminus of the human beta-amyloid precursor 
protein (beta PP). A fusion protein was identified that interacts specifically 
with the cytoplasmic domain of beta PP and does not interact with the 
beta-amyloid region. The protein encoded by this partial mouse cDNA is identical 
to the C-terminus of the rat Fe65 protein. This mouse protein also interacts 
with the homologous C-terminal domains of the mouse amyloid precursor-like 
proteins, APLP1 and APLP2. These conserved cytoplasmic regions contain a common 
amino acid motif, Asn-Pro-Thr-Tyr, which has previously been shown to influence 
both the secretion and internalization of beta PP. Fe65 has been implicated in 
regulatory and cell signaling mechanisms because it contains two different 
motifs involved in protein binding, a WW domain (a variant of Src homology 3 
domains) and a phosphotyrosine interaction domain (PID). Interestingly, the PID 
domain binds to the same motif present in the conserved cytoplasmic domains of 
the beta PP and beta PP-like proteins. RNA analyses reveal that Fe65 is 
predominantly expressed in brain and in the regions most affected by Alzheimer's 
disease (AD)-associated neuropathology. The human Fe65 mRNA was cloned from a 
fetal brain cDNA library. The message encodes a protein of 735 amino acids that 
is 95% identical to the rat Fe65 protein. The human Fe65 gene was mapped on 
human metaphase chromosomes to band 11p15 using fluorescence in situ 
hybridization.
