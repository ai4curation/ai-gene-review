The transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells [VSMC] into foam cells 
leading to increased plaque size and decreased stability is a key, yet 
understudied step in atherogenesis. We reported that Interleukin-19 (IL-19), a 
novel, anti-inflammatory cytokine, attenuates atherosclerosis by 
anti-inflammatory effects on VSMC. In this work we report that IL-19 induces 
expression of miR133a, a muscle-specific miRNA, in VSMC. Although previously 
unreported, we report that miR133a can target and reduce mRNA abundance, mRNA 
stability, and protein expression of Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor Adaptor 
Protein 1, (LDLRAP1), an adaptor protein which functions to internalize the LDL 
receptor. Mutations in this gene lead to LDL receptor malfunction and cause the 
Autosomal Recessive Hypercholesterolemia (ARH) disorder in humans. Herein we 
show that IL-19 reduces lipid accumulation in VSMC, and LDLRAP1 expression and 
oxLDL uptake in a miR133a-dependent mechanism. We show that LDLRAP1 is expressed 
in plaque and neointimal VSMC of mouse and human injured arteries. Transfection 
of miR133a and LDLRAP1 siRNA into VSMC reduces their proliferation and uptake of 
oxLDL. miR133a is significantly increased in plasma from hyperlipidemic compared 
with normolipidemic patients. Expression of miR133a in IL-19 stimulated VSMC 
represents a previously unrecognized link between vascular lipid metabolism and 
inflammation, and may represent a therapeutic opportunity to combat vascular 
inflammatory diseases.
