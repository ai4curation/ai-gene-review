TIA-1 and TIAR are two closely related RNA recognition motif (RRM) proteins 
which possess three RRM-type RNA binding domains (RRMs 1, 2, and 3). Although 
both proteins have been implicated as effectors of apoptotic cell death, the 
specific functions of TIA-1 and TIAR are not known. We have performed in vitro 
selection/amplification from pools of random RNA sequences to identify RNAs to 
which TIA-1 and TIAR bind with high affinity. Both proteins selected RNAs 
containing one or several short stretches of uridylate residues suggesting that 
the two proteins have similar RNA binding specificities. Replacement of the 
uridylate stretch with an equal number of cytidine residues eliminates the 
protein-RNA interaction. Mutational analysis indicates that, for both TIA-1 and 
TIAR, it is the second RNA binding domain (RRM 2) which mediates the specific 
binding to uridylate-rich RNAs. Although RRM 2 is both necessary and sufficient 
for this interaction, the affinity for the selected RNA (as determined by filter 
binding assays) does increase when the second domain of TIAR is expressed 
together with the first and third domains (Kd = 2 x 10(-8) M) rather than alone 
(Kd = 5 x 10(-8) M). Although RRM 3 (of either TIA-1 or TIAR) does not interact 
with the uridylate-rich sequences selected by the full-length proteins, it is a 
bona fide RNA binding domain capable of affinity-precipitating a population of 
cellular RNAs ranging in size from 0.5 to 5 kilobases. In contrast, RRM 1 does 
not affinity-precipitate cellular RNA. The inability of RRM 1 to interact with 
RNA may be due to the presence of negatively charged amino acids within the RNP 
1 octamer.
