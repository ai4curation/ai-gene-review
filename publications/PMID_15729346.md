Most stem cells are not totipotent. Instead, they are partially committed but 
remain undifferentiated. Upon appropriate stimulation they are capable of 
regenerating mature cell types. Little is known about the genetic programmes 
that maintain the undifferentiated phenotype of lineage-restricted stem cells. 
Here we describe the molecular details of a nodal point in adult melanocyte stem 
cell differentiation in which Pax3 simultaneously functions to initiate a 
melanogenic cascade while acting downstream to prevent terminal differentiation. 
Pax3 activates expression of Mitf, a transcription factor critical for 
melanogenesis, while at the same time it competes with Mitf for occupancy of an 
enhancer required for expression of dopachrome tautomerase, an enzyme that 
functions in melanin synthesis. Pax3-expressing melanoblasts are thus committed 
but undifferentiated until Pax3-mediated repression is relieved by activated 
beta-catenin. Thus, a stem cell transcription factor can both determine cell 
fate and simultaneously maintain an undifferentiated state, leaving a cell 
poised to differentiate in response to external stimuli.
