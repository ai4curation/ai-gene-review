S-acylation (palmitoylation) is the only fully reversible lipid modification of 
proteins; however, little is known about how protein S-acyltransferases (PATs) 
that mediate it are regulated. DHHC5 is a PAT that is mainly localised at the 
plasma membrane with roles in synaptic plasticity, massive endocytosis and 
cancer cell growth/invasion. Here, we demonstrate that DHHC5 binds to and 
palmitoylates a novel accessory protein Golga7b. Palmitoylation of Golga7b 
prevents clathrin-mediated endocytosis of DHHC5 and stabilises it at the plasma 
membrane. Proteomic analysis of the composition of DHHC5/Golga7b-associated 
protein complexes reveals a striking enrichment in adhesion proteins, 
particularly components of desmosomes. We show that desmoglein-2 and 
plakophilin-3 are substrates of DHHC5 and that DHHC5 and Golga7b are required 
for localisation of desmoglein-2 to the plasma membrane and for desmosomal 
patterning. Loss of DHHC5/Golga7b causes functional impairments in cell 
adhesion, suggesting these proteins have a wider role in cell adhesion beyond 
desmosome assembly. This work uncovers a novel mechanism of DHHC5 regulation by 
Golga7b and demonstrates a role for the DHHC5/Golga7b complex in the regulation 
of cell adhesion.
