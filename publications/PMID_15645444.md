During late embryogenesis, the mouse colon develops from a pseudostratified, 
undifferentiated endoderm to a single-layered columnar epithelium with 
accompanying mesenchymal maturation. To identify regulatory genetic programs 
underlying these morphological changes, we profiled gene expression of the 
developing mouse colon by microarray from embryonic day (E)13.5 to E18.5. 
Unbiased cluster analysis of 13,484 cDNA elements revealed two distinct groups 
of genes whose expression changes reflect the dynamic morphological events of 
the epithelium and mesenchyme during this period. Additional analyses revealed 
two subsets of genes whose expression is either upregulated or downregulated 
over the same developmental period. Of those genes whose expression increases 
from E13.5 to E18.5 (n = 158), known functions include acquisition and/or 
maintenance of colonic differentiation. Genes whose transcription is 
downregulated over this period (n = 49) have demonstrated roles in nuclear 
organization, transcriptional regulation, and cell proliferation. These results 
provide the basis for a molecular portrait of colonic development during late 
embryogenesis and should be a valuable resource for investigators interested in 
colonic development and neoplasia, as well as comparative organogenesis.
