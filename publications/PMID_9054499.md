Oncogenic ras can transform most immortal rodent cells to a tumorigenic state. 
However, transformation of primary cells by ras requires either a cooperating 
oncogene or the inactivation of tumor suppressors such as p53 or p16. Here we 
show that expression of oncogenic ras in primary human or rodent cells results 
in a permanent G1 arrest. The arrest induced by ras is accompanied by 
accumulation of p53 and p16, and is phenotypically indistinguishable from 
cellular senescence. Inactivation of either p53 or p16 prevents ras-induced 
arrest in rodent cells, and E1A achieves a similar effect in human cells. These 
observations suggest that the onset of cellular senescence does not simply 
reflect the accumulation of cell divisions, but can be prematurely activated in 
response to an oncogenic stimulus. Negation of ras-induced senescence may be 
relevant during multistep tumorigenesis.
