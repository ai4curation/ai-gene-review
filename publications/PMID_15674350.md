Previously, we showed that the BRCA1 protein interacts directly and functionally 
with estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), resulting in the inhibition of 
estradiol (E2)-stimulated ER-alpha transcriptional activity. The interaction 
sites were mapped to the N-terminus of BRCA1 (within amino acids (aa) 1-302) and 
the ligand-binding domain/activation function-2 (LBD/AF-2) region (within aa 
282-420) of ER-alpha. In this study, we have further characterized the 
structure/function relationship for the BRCA1 : ER-alpha interaction. We found 
that the N-terminal RING domain (aa 20-64) is not required for the BRCA1 : 
ER-alpha interaction. We identified two separate contact points for ER-alpha, 
one within aa 1-100 and the other within aa 100-200 of BRCA1; and we showed that 
each of these BRCA1 peptides interacts with BRCA1 in vitro and in vivo. By using 
different fragments of the BRCA1 N-terminus, we found that aa 67-100 and 101-133 
are required for the interaction with ER-alpha, but that aa 1-67 and 134-302 are 
dispensible. Previously, we showed that BRCA1 aa 1-302 does not inhibit 
E2-stimulated ER-alpha transcriptional activity but does bind to ER-alpha and 
acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of the full-length BRCA1 protein. Somewhat 
surprisingly, we found that BRCA1 aa 1-100 and BRCA1 aa 101-200 (but not aa 
201-300) each inhibited ER-alpha activity, although not as efficiently as 
full-length BRCA1. Mutations within an HIV Rev-like nuclear export signal that 
resembles a nuclear receptor corepressor motif (aa 86-95) impaired the ability 
of both truncated (aa 1-100) and full-length (aa 1-1863) BRCA1 proteins to 
interact with and/or repress ER-alpha activity. Based on these findings, a 
partial BRCA1 : ER-alpha three-dimensional structure is proposed. The 
implications of these findings for understanding the BRCA1 : ER-alpha 
interaction are discussed.
