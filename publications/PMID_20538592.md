Nicastrin and its relative Nicalin (Nicastrin-like protein) are both members of 
larger protein complexes, namely gamma-secretase and the Nicalin-NOMO (Nodal 
modulator) complex. The gamma-secretase complex, which contains Presenilin, 
APH-1, and PEN-2 in addition to Nicastrin, catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage of 
the transmembrane domain of various proteins including the beta-amyloid 
precursor protein and Notch. Nicalin and its binding partner NOMO form a complex 
that was shown to modulate Nodal signaling in developing zebrafish embryos. 
Because its experimentally determined native size (200-220 kDa) could not be 
satisfyingly explained by the molecular masses of Nicalin (60 kDa) and NOMO (130 
kDa), we searched in affinity-purified complex preparations for additional 
components in the low molecular mass range. A approximately 22-kDa protein was 
isolated and identified by mass spectrometry as transmembrane protein 147 
(TMEM147), a novel, highly conserved membrane protein with a putative topology 
similar to APH-1. Like Nicalin and NOMO, it localizes to the endoplasmic 
reticulum and is expressed during early zebrafish development. Overexpression 
and knockdown experiments in cultured cells demonstrate a close relationship 
between the three proteins and suggest that they are components of the same 
complex. We present evidence that, similar to gamma-secretase, its assembly is 
hierarchical starting with the formation of a Nicalin-NOMO intermediate. Nicalin 
appears to represent the limiting factor regulating the assembly rate by 
stabilizing the other two components. We conclude that TMEM147 is a novel core 
component of the Nicalin-NOMO complex, further emphasizing its similarity with 
gamma-secretase.
