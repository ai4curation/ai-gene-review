We cloned recently an alternatively spliced variant of KAI1 mRNA that lacked 
exon 7 at the COOH-terminal region and showed differences in metastasis 
suppression when compared with the wild-type KAI1. These findings indicated that 
the COOH-terminal region of KAI1 is critical for its metastasis suppressor 
function. In this study, we isolated a cDNA clone of VANGL1, a member of the 
tetraspanin protein family, which interacted specifically with the COOH-terminal 
cytoplasmic domain of KAI1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. We renamed it KAI1 
COOH-terminal interacting tetraspanin (KITENIN). We found that 
KITENIN-overexpressing CT-26 mouse colon cancer cells showed increased 
tumorigenicity and early hepatic metastasis in vivo, as well as increased 
invasiveness and adhesion to fibronectin in vitro compared with parental cells. 
Moreover, increased levels of KITENIN were observed in a human gastric tumor and 
its metastatic tissues, compared with the normal adjacent mucosa. Our results 
indicate that KITENIN promotes adhesion and invasion of cancer cells in vitro 
and in vivo, and suggest that KITENIN participates in the regulation of the 
tumor formation and metastasis by interacting with KAI1, a metastasis suppressor 
and antisense KITENIN strategy that can be used to inhibit metastasis in various 
cancers.
