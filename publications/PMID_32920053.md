Unicellular organisms live under diverse stressful conditions and must respond 
and adapt quickly to these stresses. When these stresses persist, cells favor a 
transition to quiescence. There are changes to many processes when cells begin 
their entry into quiescence. It has been reported that Hsp82 plays an important 
role in several such processes, and its distribution and activity change 
according to nutrient conditions. In this study, we found that the subcellular 
distribution of Hsp82 is regulated by its co-chaperone Ppt1. Under starvation 
conditions, Ppt1 expression was significantly reduced by a TOR-independent 
pathway. Furthermore, we found that Ppt1 regulates Hsp82 distribution in the 
cytoplasm and nucleus by dephosphorylating the S485 residue on Hsp82. The 
Hsp82S485A strain has impaired membrane-related protein transport, and its cell 
size did not become larger in quiescence compared to log phase, resulting in 
failure to survive during starvation.
