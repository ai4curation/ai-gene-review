Iron sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, preassembled on the ISCU scaffold, are transferred 
to target proteins or to intermediate scaffolds by a dedicated 
chaperone-cochaperone system. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie 
substrate discrimination and guide delivery of nascent clusters to specific 
subsets of Fe-S recipients are poorly understood. Here, we identified 
interacting partners of the cochaperone HSC20 and discovered that LYR motifs are 
molecular signatures of specific recipient Fe-S proteins or accessory factors 
that assist Fe-S cluster delivery. In succinate dehydrogenase B, two LYR motifs 
engage the ISCU-HSC20-HSPA9 complex to aid incorporation of three Fe-S clusters 
within the final structure of complex II. Moreover, we show that members of the 
LYR motif family which assist assembly of complexes II or III, SDHAF1 and LYRM7, 
respectively, are HSC20 binding partners. Our studies unveil a network of 
interactions between HSC20 and LYR motif-containing proteins that are key to the 
assembly and function of complexes I, II, and III.

INTRODUCTION

Iron sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are essential cofactors, required for the function of proteins involved in a broad range of cellular processes, including electron transport in respiratory chain complexes, photosynthesis, regulatory sensing and DNA repair. In contrast to the chemical simplicity of Fe-S clusters, their synthesis involves a complex sequence of catalyzed protein-protein interactions and coupled conformational changes between the components of several dedicated multimeric complexes ( Rouault, 2012 ). The proteins involved in Fe-S cluster (ISC) biogenesis are evolutionarily conserved, and many insights into the assembly process have been provided by studies of model organisms, including bacteria, fungi and plants ( Couturier et al., 2013 ; Dos Santos and Dean, 2010 ; Roche et al., 2013 ). In mammalian cells, Fe-S clusters are assembled by a complex composed of a cysteine desulfurase, NFS1, its binding partner, ISD11, the ISCU scaffold, and an iron donor or allosteric effector, frataxin ( Rouault, 2012 ). Studies in bacteria and yeast have demonstrated that upon assembly of a nascent [2Fe-2S] cluster, the scaffold protein (IscU in bacteria and Isu in yeast) binds to the J-protein (HscB or Jac1, respectively), through hydrophobic contacts ( Ciesielski et al., 2012 ; Fuzery et al., 2011 ), and to an HSP70 chaperone (HscA or Ssq1) through a conserved LPPVK motif ( Dutkiewicz et al., 2004 ; Vickery and Cupp-Vickery, 2007 ). An ATP-driven conformational change of the HSP70 enhances transfer of the ISCU-bound cluster to recipient apoproteins or to secondary scaffolds that then deliver the cluster to specific subsets of final acceptors ( Vickery and Cupp-Vickery, 2007 ).

HSC20 is the sole human DnaJ type III cochaperone dedicated to Fe-S cluster biogenesis ( Uhrigshardt et al., 2010 ). Mutations in HSC20 and in its orthologs cause defects in Fe-S protein activities, mitochondrial iron accumulation, and reduced mitochondrial respiration in human cell lines ( Uhrigshardt et al., 2010 ), and in multiple experimental systems, including yeast ( Kim et al., 2001 ; Voisine et al., 2001 ) and fly ( Uhrigshardt et al., 2013 ). The importance of Fe-S biogenesis for human health is well established, as mutations that affect proteins involved in the pathway cause several distinctive human diseases ( Rouault, 2012 ). Interestingly, studies of four newly described syndromes caused by mutations in NUBPL, NFU1 or BOLA3, and IBA57 ( Ajit Bolar et al., 2013 ; Rouault, 2012 ) suggest that transfer of Fe-S clusters from the ISCU-chaperone-cochaperone complex depends on selective downstream pathways, which underscores our lack of knowledge about how discrete subsets of Fe-S recipients are targeted.

We conducted a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen to search the human proteome for interacting partners of HSC20, aiming to identify Fe-S proteins and specific molecular recognition motifs that guide targeting of Fe-S clusters to appropriate recipients. J-proteins often determine the specificity of their cognate chaperones ( Ciesielski et al., 2012 ; Kampinga and Craig, 2010 ; Pukszta et al., 2010 ), and their C-terminal domains can bind substrates ( Perales-Calvo et al., 2010 ; Szabo et al., 1996 ), facilitate refolding of denatured proteins, and enhance cell viability ( Lee et al., 2002 ; Li and Sha, 2005 ). Here we found that direct binding of specific targets to the cochaperone HSC20 is mediated by affinity of its C-terminus for proteins that bear the LYR motif, a tripeptide that constitutes a major molecular signature of distinctive Fe-S recipients.

DISCUSSION

Here we have identified a molecular signature, the tripeptide LYR, which defines Fe-S target proteins through their ability to bind the cochaperone HSC20 and acquire their Fe-S clusters from the scaffold protein, ISCU. Upon analyzing SDHB, which binds to HSC20 directly in Y2H assays, and in vivo in coimmunoprecipitations, we identified three distinct HSC20 binding sites that span from the N- to the C-terminus, including two iterations of the motif L(I)YR. Despite its relatively simple subunit composition, the assembly process of SDH has remained relatively enigmatic ( Kim and Winge, 2013 ; Rutter et al., 2010 ), and two accessory proteins have been identified, SDHAF1 and SDHAF2 ( Ghezzi et al., 2009 ; Hao et al., 2009 ). In this work, we uncovered molecular details of how SDHB acquires its three Fe-S centers, and how assembly of Complex II is contingent upon successful biogenesis of SDHB. Our co-immunoprecipitation and proteomic approaches demonstrated that HSC20 physically interacts with SDHB, and works together with its cognate chaperone, HSPA9, to enhance transfer of Fe-S clusters from the main scaffold ISCU directly to SDHB. Further evidences for this scenario was provided by mitochondrial subfractionation studies in combination with BN-PAGE and 2D-native/SDS-PAGE analyzes, which enabled us to characterize a novel assembly intermediate of SDH, CIIb. By following the import into isolated mitochondria of in vitro synthesized SDHB, we found that interaction of SDHB with the chaperone-cochaperone complex precedes association with SDHA ( Figures 6E , S3F – H , S3L ). This result elucidates a key point in the assembly of Complex II. Flavinylation of Sdh1 (the yeast ortholog of the SDHA subunit) was previously recognized as a prerequisite for complex II maturation ( Kim and Winge, 2013 ), and our results have demonstrated that SDHB must acquire its three Fe-S clusters to enter the previously unrecognized CIIa intermediate complex composed of functional SDHA-SDHB subunits. Defective assembly of Complex II °Ccurs early in cells silenced for HSC20 or HSPA9, as shown by reduced levels of SDHB incorporated into CII, reduced SDH and SQR activities upon knockdown for three days, and by decreased incorporation of Fe 55 into Complex II.

By pursuing interactions of HSC20 with SDHB, we identified two L(I)YR motifs in the SDHB primary sequence, which were responsible for engaging the chaperone-cochaperone transfer apparatus and facilitating acquisition of Fe-S clusters during primary folding of SDHB. Consistent with our mutagenesis analysis, the motif consists of an aliphatic residue at position 1 (I, L or V), followed by a tyrosine or possibly phenylalanine at position 2, and a basic residue (R or K) at position 3. The two LYR motifs in SDHB are highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic and prokaryotic kingdoms ( Table S5 ), suggesting that these consensus sequences have significant functional importance. Biogenesis of SDHB may require binding of the orthologous cochaperones to the L(I)YR motifs in organisms ranging from eukaryotes, including plants, to prokaryotes. The ability of HSC20 to bind LYR motifs is underscored by interactions of HSC20 with annotated members of the LYR family, namely SDHAF1 (LYRM8), which is involved in SDH assembly, and LYRM7, which is required for the biogenesis of the Rieske Fe-S protein of Complex III ( Sanchez et al., 2013 ).

Our results show that SDHAF1 also associates with SDHB through a non-LYR binding site. Based on the physical association between SDHAF1 and SDHB, we propose that SDHAF1 may promote Fe-S cluster insertion into SDHB through its ability to bind HSC20. In our working model ( Figure 7E ), SDHAF1 associates with SDHB through a non-LYR binding site, and utilizes its own LYR motif to position an ISCU-HSC20-HSPA9 complex near to chaperone complexes directly associated with the LYR binding site of SDHB. The previously observed propensity of HSC20 to dimerize may allow two holo-ISCU molecules at neighboring binding sites to reorganize their adjacent [2Fe-2S] centers, enabling them to coalesce into the [4Fe-4S] and [3Fe-4S] clusters of mature SDHB ( Chandramouli et al., 2007 ).

Our in vivo and in vitro approaches to inspect the HSC20-mediated insertion of Fe-S clusters into SDHB have shed light on general mechanisms underlying client discrimination, an event of critical importance in the steps that facilitate Fe-S cluster transfer from the main scaffold ISCU to specific Fe-S recipient proteins or potential intermediate scaffolds. We propose that LYR motifs impart specificity by enabling unfolded target proteins to bind the HSC20-dependent Fe-S transfer apparatus and directly acquire their clusters.

Notably, Complex I, which contains eight Fe-S clusters that are deeply buried within the 45 subunit multimeric complex, contains two annotated members of the LYR family, LYRM6 (NDUFA6) and LYRM3 (NDUFB9) and a Fe-S subunit, NDUFS8, that contains a previously unrecognized conserved C-terminal LYR motif and is predicted to ligate two [4Fe-4S] clusters ( Table S5 ). As only 14 of the 45 Complex I subunits have a catalytic function ( Fassone and Rahman, 2012 ), some of the accessory or supernumerary subunits may contribute to the assembly and stability of the complex. Several of the LYR-containing subunits may aid insertion of the Fe-S clusters into the complex.

In our analysis, we also identified a third binding region for HSC20 in residues 255–280 of SDHB. Our mutagenesis analyses demonstrated that the sequence K 267 K 268 X 7 K 276 K 277 was responsible for mediating the interaction with HSC20. SUCLG2, a protein identified in our screen, which may provide succinyl-CoA consumed in the first step of heme biosynthesis, contains a similar consensus at its C-terminus. Moreover, GLRX5, which interacted with HSC20 in vivo , has a similar pattern of lysines in the C-terminal region (K 139 K 140 X 10 K 151 K 151 ). Notably, Grx5 homologues, including human GLRX5, serve as alternative scaffolds for Fe-S cluster delivery to a subset of target proteins ( Shakamuri et al., 2012 ; Uzarska et al., 2013 ; Ye et al., 2010 ).

Our studies unveil a previously unrecognized network of protein-protein interactions that are key to assembly and function of complexes I-III in eukaryotes, and likely also in bacteria, where the same machinery is conserved. Numerous other Fe-S proteins, many of which are not yet recognized, may be revealed by further studies of proteins that contain the LYR motif, or further analyses of other proteins identified in our Y2H screen.
