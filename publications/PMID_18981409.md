A central issue in the control of apoptosis is whether its essential mediators 
Bax and Bak must be restrained by Bcl-2-like prosurvival relatives to prevent 
their damaging mitochondria and unleashing apoptosis. The issue is particularly 
vexed for Bax, which is largely a cytosolic monomer in unstressed cells. To 
determine whether Bax regulation requires its binding by prosurvival relatives, 
we replaced a conserved aspartate in its BH3 interaction domain with arginine. 
Bax D68R functioned and behaved like wild-type Bax in localization and 
activation but had greatly impaired binding to the prosurvival family members. 
Nevertheless, Bcl-x(L) remained able to block apoptosis induced by Bax D68R. 
Whereas cells with sufficient Bcl-x(L) tolerated expression of Bax D68R, it 
provoked apoptosis when Bcl-x(L) was absent, downregulated, or inactivated. 
Moreover, Bax D68R rendered membrane bound by a C-terminal anchor mutation 
overwhelmed endogenous Bcl-x(L) and killed cells. These unexpected results 
suggest that engagement of Bax by its prosurvival relatives is a major barrier 
to its full activation. We propose that the Bcl-2-like proteins must capture the 
small proportion of Bax molecules with an exposed BH3 domain, probably on the 
mitochondrial membrane, to prevent Bax-imposed cell death, but that Bcl-x(L) 
also controls Bax by other mechanisms.
