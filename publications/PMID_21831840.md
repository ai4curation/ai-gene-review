Recent observations suggest that p53 mutations are responsible not only for 
growth of primary tumors but also for their dissemination. However, mechanisms 
involved in p53-mediated control of cell motility and invasion remain poorly 
understood. By using the primary ovarian surface epithelium cell culture, we 
show that conditional inactivation of p53 or expression of its mutant forms 
results in overexpression of MET receptor tyrosine kinase, a crucial regulator 
of invasive growth. At the same time, cells acquire increased MET-dependent 
motility and invasion. Wild-type p53 negatively regulates MET expression by two 
mechanisms: (i) transactivation of MET-targeting miR-34, and (ii) inhibition of 
SP1 binding to MET promoter. Both mechanisms are not functional in p53 absence, 
but mutant p53 proteins retain partial MET promoter suppression. Accordingly, 
MET overexpression, cell motility, and invasion are particularly high in 
p53-null cells. These results identify MET as a critical effector of p53 and 
suggest that inhibition of MET may be an effective antimetastatic approach to 
treat cancers with p53 mutations. These results also show that the extent of 
advanced cancer traits, such as invasion, may be determined by alterations in 
individual components of p53/MET regulatory network.

Abstract

Recent observations suggest that p53 mutations are responsible not only for growth of primary tumors but also for their dissemination. However, mechanisms involved in p53-mediated control of cell motility and invasion remain poorly understood. By using the primary ovarian surface epithelium cell culture, we show that conditional inactivation of p53 or expression of its mutant forms results in overexpression of MET receptor tyrosine kinase, a crucial regulator of invasive growth. At the same time, cells acquire increased MET-dependent motility and invasion. Wild-type p53 negatively regulates MET expression by two mechanisms: ( i ) transactivation of MET-targeting miR-34 , and ( ii ) inhibition of SP1 binding to MET promoter. Both mechanisms are not functional in p53 absence, but mutant p53 proteins retain partial MET promoter suppression. Accordingly, MET overexpression, cell motility, and invasion are particularly high in p53-null cells. These results identify MET as a critical effector of p53 and suggest that inhibition of MET may be an effective antimetastatic approach to treat cancers with p53 mutations. These results also show that the extent of advanced cancer traits, such as invasion, may be determined by alterations in individual components of p53/MET regulatory network.

Discussion

Our work shows that p53 controls the expression of the proto-oncogene MET by two mechanisms, consisting of suppression of MET on the transcriptional level via promoter repression and on the posttranscriptional level via transactivation of miR-34. Contrary to a previous report ( 17 ), we were unable to find any canonical or novel p53 binding sites selectively responsible for either activation or repression of MET promoter. At the same time, the results of our promoter analysis, together with coimmunoprecipitation and ChIP assays, provide support for a mechanism of MET transcriptional repression based on inhibition of SP1 binding to DNA through physical interactions between p53 and SP1 rather than on direct promoter-binding by p53. Consistent with this possibility, it has been previously reported that SP1 activates MET promoter activity ( 34 , 35 ) and interacts with wild-type ( 36 , 37 ) and mutant p53 ( 2 ). Furthermore, p53 inhibits SP1 DNA binding to the HIV-LTR and MGMT promoter in vitro ( 38 , 39 ).

Either lack of p53 or expression of its mutant forms abrogates miR-34 transactivation of miR-34 ( 16 ). Therefore, both types of mutations result in elevation of miR-34–dependent MET expression. However, our study shows that unlike null mutations, mutant p53 protein retains MET promoter-suppressive function, albeit to a lesser degree than wild-type p53. Consistent with the lesser extent of MET expression, cells expressing mutant p53 display a lower MET-dependent motility and invasion compared with null mutants. These findings suggest that specific alterations in individual components of the p53/MET signaling network may modulate the course of pathological process. Consistent with this possibility, the poorest prognosis of p53 null mutations has been reported in some types of neoplasms, including ovarian, lung, and breast cancers ( 40 – 42 ).

Recent studies indicate that lack of p53 versus expression of mutant p53 proteins may have a different impact on motility and invasion in the context of particular cell types, as well as additional genomic alterations. Our observations of increased motility and invasion by p53-null OSE cells are consistent with previous studies that have shown comparable effects in p53-null immortalized fibroblasts and MEFs ( 3 , 4 ). Similarly, non-small-cell lung carcinoma line NCI-H1299 cells harboring a p53 -null mutation have been reported to migrate faster than those expressing R175H mutant p53 ( 43 ).

At the same time, some investigators have reported that mutant p53 protein but not null p53 mutations may drive cell motility and invasion by promoting integrin recycling ( 5 ), by forming a complex with Smad to oppose p63-mediated control of putative metastasis suppressors Sharp-1 and cyclin G2 ( 6 ) or by stabilizing the invasion promoter Slug ( 7 ). Consistent with cell-type specificity of p53 effects, mice expressing mutant p53 develop a more diverse spectrum of neoplasms compared with null mutants ( 33 ). Interestingly, in line with observations by Grugan et al. ( 44 ), knockdown of mutant p53 in ovarian carcinoma cells did not change levels of MET expression. This observation is at variance with our results on primary OSE cells carrying a conditional mutant p53 allele, which may indicate that established cancer lines and neoplastic cells at advanced cancer stages develop additional mechanisms ensuring MET signaling in cells carrying mutant forms of p53 protein. Assessment of primary ovarian cancer cells should address this problem in future studies. It should be also of interest to evaluate p53/MET signaling in the fallopian tube epithelium, another potential cell of origin of serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary ( 45 , 46 ).

There are indications that some additional genetic or epigenetic alterations are required for stabilization and accumulation of mutant p53, thereby leading to a gain-of-function phenotype ( 47 ). In agreement with this possibility, our results in primary OSE from p53 +/R172H or p53 +/R270H mice, as well as studies by others in MEFs with the same genotypes ( 33 ), show that cell immortalization is acquired only after the loss of the remaining wild-type copy of p53 . Consistently, Adorno et al. ( 6 ) were able to observe increased migration of cells expressing mutant p53 only in combination with HRAS and TGF-β signaling. Notably, RAS mutations are extremely rare in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma ( 23 ).

Development of therapies aimed at correction of the p53 pathway remains among the most coveted goals in cancer research ( 48 ). Importantly, our experiments have demonstrated that MET is a critical component of motility and invasion in cells either lacking p53 or expressing its mutant forms. Therefore, treatment of cancers with p53 mutations is likely to benefit from therapeutics aimed at MET, such as small targeting molecules ( 10 ). This finding is of particular significance because, despite successful outcomes in cell culture and animal in vivo experiments, direct reintroduction of the p53 gene failed in clinical trials, including EOC ( 49 ). Our study also indicates that approaches aimed at indirect elimination of mutant p53 protein (e.g., by p53 siRNA) should be avoided in cancers with an active p53/MET signaling network. The in-depth understanding of mechanisms by which p53 regulates MET in the context of different cell types, as well as specific p53 mutations, may be essential for future development of individualized therapeutics.
