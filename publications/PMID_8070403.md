p47v-crk (v-Crk), a transforming gene product containing Src homology (SH)-2 and 
-3 domains, induces an elevated level of tyrosine phosphorylation of several 
cellular proteins. Among these proteins, a 125-135 kDa protein (p130) shows 
marked phosphorylation at tyrosines and tight association with v-Crk, suggesting 
a direct signal mediator of v-Crk. Here we report the molecular cloning of rat 
p130 by immunoaffinity purification. The p130 is a novel SH3-containing 
signaling molecule with a cluster of multiple putative SH2-binding motifs of 
v-Crk. Immunochemical analyses revealed that p130 is highly phosphorylated at 
tyrosines during transformation by p60v-src (v-Src), as well as by v-Crk, 
forming stable complexes with these oncoproteins. The p130 behaves as an 
extremely potent substrate of kinase activity included in the complexes and it 
is a major v-Src-associated substrate of the Src kinase by partial peptidase 
mapping. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that the cytoplasmic p130 could 
move to the membrane upon tyrosine phosphorylation. The p130 (designated Cas for 
Crk-associated substrate) is a common cellular target of phosphorylation signal 
via v-Crk and v-Src oncoproteins, and its unique structure indicates the 
possible role of p130Cas in assembling signals from multiple SH2-containing 
molecules.
