The highly similar cytoplasmic β- and γ-actins differ by only four functionally 
similar amino acids, yet previous in vitro and in vivo data suggest that they 
support unique functions due to striking phenotypic differences between Actb and 
Actg1 null mouse and cell models. To determine whether the four amino acid 
variances were responsible for the functional differences between cytoplasmic 
actins, we gene edited the endogenous mouse Actb locus to translate γ-actin 
protein. The resulting mice and primary embryonic fibroblasts completely lacked 
β-actin protein, but were viable and did not present with the most overt and 
severe cell and organismal phenotypes observed with gene knockout. Nonetheless, 
the edited mice exhibited progressive high-frequency hearing loss and 
degeneration of actin-based stereocilia as previously reported for hair 
cell-specific Actb knockout mice. Thus, β-actin protein is not required for 
general cellular functions, but is necessary to maintain auditory stereocilia.
