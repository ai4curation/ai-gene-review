A genomic library of Clostridium thermocellum DNA constructed in lambda ZAPII 
was screened for xylanase-expressing clones. Cross-hybridization experiments 
revealed a new xylanase gene isolated from the gene library, which was 
designated xyn Y. The encoded enzyme, xylanase Y (XYLY), displayed features 
characteristic of an endo-beta1,4-xylanase: the enzyme rapidly hydrolysed oat 
spelt, wheat and rye arabinoxylans and was active against 
methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside, but did not hydrolyse any cellulosic 
substrates. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were 6.8 and 75 degrees 
C respectively, and the recombinant XYLY, expressed by Escherichia coli had a 
maximum Mr of 116000. The nucleotide sequence of xyn Y contained an open reading 
frame of 3228 bp encoding a protein of predicted Mr 120 105. The encoded enzyme 
contained a typical N-terminal 26-residue signal peptide, followed by a 164 
amino acid sequence, designated domain A, that was not essential for catalytic 
activity. Downstream of domain A was a 351-residue xylanase Family F catalytic 
domain, followed by a 180-residue sequence that exhibited 28% sequence identity 
with a thermostable domain of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum xylanase A. 
The C-terminal portion of XYLY comprised the 23-residue duplicated docking 
sequence found in all other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases that are 
constituents of the bacterium's multienzyme complex, termed the cellulosome, 
followed by a 286-residue domain which exhibited 32% sequence identity with the 
N-terminal region of C. thermocellum xylanase Z. The enzyme did not contain 
linker sequences found in other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases. 
Analysis of truncated forms of XYLY and hybrid proteins, comprising segments of 
XYLY fused to the E. coli maltose binding domain, confirmed that XYLY contained 
a central catalytic domain and an adjacent thermostable domain. The C-terminal 
domain did not bind to cellulose or xylan. Western blot analysis using antiserum 
raised against XYLY showed that the xylanase was located in the cellulosome and 
did not appear to be extensively glycosylated. The non-catalytic domains of XYLY 
are discussed in relation to the general stability of thermophilic xylanases.
