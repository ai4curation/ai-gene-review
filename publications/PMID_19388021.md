Members of the Wnt family of lipoglycoproteins initiate signaling by binding to 
Frizzled (Fz) receptors, and the signal is then relayed by Disheveled (Dvl). The 
Dvl PDZ domain is known to interact directly with a peptide derived from the 
KTXXXW motif of Fz7, which is conserved in all known Fz subtypes. We found that 
an extended region spanning the KTXXXW motif on both its N-terminal and 
C-terminal sides dramatically influences the affinity of peptides derived from 
Fz7 for Dvl PDZ. An alanine scanning study identified the specific residues 
external to the KTXXXW motif that are important for high-affinity binding. In a 
circular dichroism analysis, mutation of some of these critical residues 
resulted in peptide conformational changes, suggesting that the secondary 
structure of the peptides contributes to Fz-Dvl PDZ binding. Of the 10 known Fz 
subtypes, peptides derived from only Fz1, Fz2, Fz3, Fz4, and Fz7 directly bound 
to Dvl PDZ domain in our study. Other Fz subtypes, including some known to be 
involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (Fz5, Fz9), did not bind to Dvl, 
suggesting that direct interaction with Dvl PDZ does not determine the 
subtype-specific functionality of Fz. Molecular modeling and circular dichroism 
studies indicated that the Fz peptides that bind to Dvl PDZ domain form specific 
conformations that are different from those of nonbinding peptides.
