Haploinsufficiency for SOX9 has recently been identified as the cause for both 
campomelic dysplasia (CD), a human skeletal malformation syndrome, and the 
associated autosomal XY sex reversal. SOX9 contains a putative DNA-binding motif 
known as the high-mobility group (HMG) domain characterizing a whole class of 
transcription factors. We show in cell transfection experiments that SOX9 can 
transactivate transcription from a reporter plasmid through the motif AACAAAG, a 
sequence recognized by other HMG domain transcription factors. By fusing all or 
part of SOX9 to the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4, the transactivating 
function was mapped to a transcription activation (TA) domain at the C terminus 
of SOX9. This non-acidic TA domain is evolutionarily conserved and rich in 
proline, glutamine and serine. With one exception, all SOX9 nonsense and frame 
shift mutations described so far in CD/sex reversal patients lead to truncation 
of the TA domain, suggesting that impairment of gonadal and skeletal development 
in these cases results, at least in part, from loss of transactivation of genes 
downstream of SOX9.
