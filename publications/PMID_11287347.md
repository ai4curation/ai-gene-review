In C. elegans the protein UNC-1 is a major determinant of anesthetic sensitivity 
and is a close homologue of the mammalian protein stomatin. In humans stomatin 
is missing from erythrocyte membranes in the hemolytic disease overhydrated 
hereditary stomatocytosis, despite an apparently normal stomatin gene. 
Overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis is characterized by alteration of the 
normal transmembrane gradients of sodium and potassium. Stomatin has been shown 
to interact genetically with sodium channels. It is also postulated that 
stomatin is important in the organization of lipid rafts. We demonstrate here 
that antibodies against UNC-1 stain the major nerve tracts of Caenorhabditis 
elegans, with very intense staining of the nerve ring. We also found that a gene 
encoding a stomatin-like protein, UNC-24, affects anesthetic sensitivity and is 
genetically epistatic to unc-1. In the absence of UNC-24, the staining of the 
nerve ring by anti-UNC-1 is abolished, despite normal transcriptional levels of 
the unc-1 mRNA. Western blots indicate that UNC-24 probably affects the 
stability of the UNC-1 protein. UNC-24 may therefore be necessary for the 
correct placement of UNC-1 in the cell membrane and organization of lipid rafts.
