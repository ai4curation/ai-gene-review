IL-1 drives Th responses, particularly Th17, in host defense. Sharing the same 
co-receptor, the IL-1 family member IL-36 exhibits properties similar to those 
of IL-1. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-36 in Aspergillus 
fumigatus-induced human Th responses. We observed that different morphological 
forms of A. fumigatus variably increase steady-state mRNA of IL-36 subfamily 
members. IL-36α is not significantly induced by any morphological form of 
Aspergillus. Most strikingly, IL-36γ is significantly induced by live A. 
fumigatus conidia and heat-killed hyphae, whereas IL-36Ra (IL-36 receptor 
antagonist) is significantly induced by heat-killed conidia, hyphae, and live 
conidia. We also observed that IL-36γ expression is dependent on the 
dectin-1/Syk and TLR4 signaling pathway. In contrast, TLR2 and CR3 inhibit 
IL-36γ expression. The biological relevance of IL-36 induction by Aspergillus is 
demonstrated by experiments showing that inhibition of the IL-36 receptor by 
IL-36Ra reduces Aspergillus-induced IL-17 and IFN-γ. These data describe that 
IL-36-dependent signals are a novel cytokine pathway that regulates Th responses 
induced by A. fumigatus, and demonstrate a role for TLR4 and dectin-1 in the 
induction of IL-36γ.
