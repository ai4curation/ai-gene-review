The closely related C. elegans MEG-1 and MEG-2 proteins localize to P granules 
during a brief period of embryogenesis when the germ lineage is being separated 
from the soma. Embryonic primordial germ cells still develop in the absence of 
MEG activity, but major defects emerge during larval stages when germ cells fail 
to proliferate or differentiate normally, resulting in sterility. To investigate 
meg-1 function, we conducted a targeted RNAi screen for enhancers and 
suppressors of meg-1 sterility. Here, we show that meg-1 interacts with multiple 
pathways that promote germ cell proliferation and survival. Surprisingly, we 
found that two nanos family members had opposing effects on the meg-1 phenotype. 
Loss of nos-3 suppressed the meg-1 phenotype, restoring fertility, while loss of 
nos-2 enhanced the meg-1 phenotype, abolishing proliferation and causing early 
and pronounced germ cell degeneration. Together, our analyses suggest that, 
under circumstances that favor proliferation, MEG function is not essential for 
germ cells to proliferate, although it is important for optimal proliferation. 
Additionally, MEG activity is likely more directly involved in germ cell 
survival than previously thought. genesis 49:380-391, 2011.
