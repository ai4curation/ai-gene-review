Inactivation of beta-catenin in mesenchymal progenitors prevents osteoblast 
differentiation; inactivation of Lrp5, a gene encoding a likely Wnt coreceptor, 
results in low bone mass (osteopenia) by decreasing bone formation. These 
observations indicate that Wnt signaling controls osteoblast differentiation and 
suggest that it may regulate bone formation in differentiated osteoblasts. Here, 
we study later events and find that stabilization of beta-catenin in 
differentiated osteoblasts results in high bone mass, while its deletion from 
differentiated osteoblasts leads to osteopenia. Surprisingly, histological 
analysis showed that these mutations primarily affect bone resorption rather 
than bone formation. Cellular and molecular studies showed that beta-catenin 
together with TCF proteins regulates osteoblast expression of Osteoprotegerin, a 
major inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation. These findings demonstrate that 
beta-catenin, and presumably Wnt signaling, promote the ability of 
differentiated osteoblasts to inhibit osteoclast differentiation; thus, they 
broaden our knowledge of the functions Wnt proteins have at various stages of 
skeletogenesis.
