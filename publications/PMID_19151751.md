DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), which encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein 
(Rho-GAP), is a potent tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in 
several human cancers. DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown 
previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that 
p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes 
with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located 
in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the 
C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that 
the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that 
Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this 
possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a

Abstract

DLC1, which encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP), is a potent tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in several human cancers. DLC-1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N-terminus of Ras-GAP and to the RhoGAP catalytic domain, located in the C-terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 RhoGAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 RhoGAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo . Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross-talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.

Introduction

In the past several years, the DLC1 ( Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 ) gene, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed Rho GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP ) , has attracted considerable interest because it is frequently down-regulated in a variety of tumor types and possesses potent oncosuppressive activity in cell lines derived from several major cancers ( Yuan et al ., 1998 ; Durkin et al ., 2007a ). Consistent with these observations, DLC1 has recently been confirmed as a bona fide tumor suppressor gene that regulates RhoA in an in vitro/in vivo reconstitution mouse model of hepatocellular carcinogenesis ( Xue et al ., 2008 ). Recent genome-wide sequencing analyses of prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers have also identified missense mutation of DLC1 ( Liao et al ., 2008 ; Jones et al ., 2008 ). DLC1 is the prototype of a multigene family that includes two other closely related genes, DLC2 and DLC3 , which have been studied less extensively than DLC1 . DLC2 and DLC3 are widely expressed in normal cells and, as is true of DLC1 , are also inactivated in several different cancers. Limited comparative analysis between the three DLC genes has suggested that at least one of the DLC genes is expressed in many tumors ( Durkin et al ., 2007b ; Ullmannova and Popescu, 2006 ).

The full inhibitory effects on cell growth and tumorigenicity induced by wild type DLC genes require their RhoGAP activity, which can negatively regulate RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, and, to a lesser degree, CDC42 ( Leung et al ., 2005 ; Wong et al ., 2005 ; Healy et al ., 2007 ; Kawai et al 2007 ; Kim et al ., 2007 ; Guan et al 2008 ). Inactivation of DLC1 , via genetic and epigenetic changes, may represent the most frequent mechanism for aberrant activation of Rho GTPases in human oncogenesis. However, the function of DLC1 appears to be complex, as analysis of DLC1 mutants in which the RhoGAP function has been inactivated indicates that RhoGAP-independent mechanisms may also contribute to the anti-oncogenic activity of DLC1 ( Kim et al ., 2007 ; Healy et al ., 2007 ; Qian et al ., 2007 ; Wong et al ., 2005 ). Consistent with this hypothesis, DLC1 has a multidomain structure that includes near its N-terminus a sterile alpha motif (SAM), which in other proteins has been implicated in protein-protein interactions, and at its C-terminus a steroidogenic acute regulatory–related lipid transfer (START) domain, in addition to the RhoGAP domain, which is located upstream from the START domain ( Yuan et al ., 1998 ). The presence of these various motifs, together with the RhoGAP-independent activities, has suggested that DLC1 might interact with other proteins in addition to Rho GTPases. Identification of such interacting partners could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the function of DLC1. Thus far, the only additional binding partners that have been clearly identified are members of tensin family, which interact with DLC1 sequences located between the SAM and Rho-GAP domains ( Liao et al ., 2007 ; Yam et al ., 2006 ; Qian et al ., 2007 ). Structure-function analysis of DLC1 demonstrated that suppression of cell migration and anchorage-independent growth by DLC1 in a lung cancer cell line required cooperation between the RhoGAP activity and tensin binding activity, although the two functions did not depend on each other ( Qian et al ., 2007 ).

To identify other binding partners, a yeast two-hybrid screen with DLC1 was carried out. Here, we report that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP), which is a ubiquitously expressed negative regulator of Ras that is encoded by the Ras-GAP gene (also know as RASA1 ), was identified by this screen as a novel binding partner for DLC1. We have confirmed that this interaction occurs in mammalian cells, mapped the regions of DLC1 and Ras-GAP that mediate binding, and provided data suggesting that Ras-GAP can serve as a negative regulator of the RhoGAP and tumor suppressor activity of DLC1.

Discussion

In this study, we have generated evidence that leads us to conclude that Ras-GAP attenuates the tumor suppressor activity of DLC1 by interfering with the Rho-GAP activity of DLC1. We found that endogenous levels of the DLC1 tumor suppressor protein form a stable complex with endogenous Ras-GAP, and that there is extensive co-localization of the two proteins by immunomicroscopy. The interaction was mapped to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain of DLC1 and the SH3 domain of Ras-GAP. We showed that this interaction can inhibit the RhoGAP activity of DLC1 in vitro . Furthermore, overexpression of Ras-GAP, in a cell line that harbored mutant Ras and thus was resistant to the negative regulation of Ras by Ras-GAP, increased the level of endogenous active Rho and antagonized the growth suppressive effects of DLC1. Although the current analysis has been confined to the interaction between the Ras-GAP and the RhoGAP domain of DLC1, we speculate that a similar interaction may occur between the other two DLC family members, DLC2 and DLC3, whose Rho-GAP domains share 80% and 71%, respectively, with this region of DLC1.

The regulation of DLC1 by Ras-GAP has several distinct features. A prior study from one of our laboratories suggested that DLC1 has an intramolecular mechanism responsible for limiting its catalytic activity, as the SAM domain of DLC1 appears to function as an inhibitor of its RhoGAP activity ( Kim et al ., 2008 ). The current observations with DLC1 and Ras-GAP show that an intermolecular mechanism can also regulate this activity. In addition, the functional consequences that result from the binding of DLC1 with Ras-GAP differ from those of DLC1 binding to members of the tensin family ( Fig.5 ). That interaction, although it contributes to the physiologic activity of DLC1, is not associated with regulation of the Rho-GAP activity of DLC1 ( Qian et al ., 2007 ). Thus, at least two different types of protein interactions with DLC1 exist. It seems possible that DLC1 tumor suppressor function may ultimately be found to depend on its interaction with other proteins in a complex network.

The DLC1 amino acids that mediate the interaction with the Ras-GAP SH3 domain may be unusual. SH3 domains contain well-conserved aromatic amino acids that most commonly recognize proline-rich sequences, typically PxxP, in its interacting proteins ( Li, 2005 ). However, none of the 5 PxxP motifs identified by the SH3-Hunter software ( Ferraro et al ., 2007 ) in DLC1 were located in the binding region (aa 590−880; supplementary Fig. 3 ). This observation indicates that the binding of the DLC1 RhoGAP catalytic domain to the Ras-GAP SH3 domain is not mediated through such a proline-rich motif, thus suggesting atypical peptide recognition. This feature which may be attributable to structural differences between the Ras-GAP SH3 domain and other SH3 domains ( Ross et al ., 2007 ), as three important residues (Leu 288, Val 332, and Leu335) that participate in the docking of proline-rich motifs (PxxP) are not conserved in Ras-GAP ( Ross et al ., 2007 ). Indeed, Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3-domain-binding protein (G3BP) does not use its several proline-rich motifs to bind Ras-GAP ( Kennedy et al ., 2001 ).

Ras-GAP has been implicated previously in cross-talk between Ras and Rho. p190Rho-GAP, which is another major regulator of cellular Rho protein, binds simultaneously to the two SH2 domains of Ras-GAP via its two closely linked tyrosine-containing peptides ( Bryant et al ., 1995 ). Although this binding does not appear to alter the enzymatic RhoGAP activity of p190Rho-GAP, complex formation between p190Rho-GAP and Ras-GAP is believed to increase the negative regulation of Rho by mediating the Ras-GAP-dependent translocation of complexed p190Rho-GAP to the plasma membrane ( Bradley et al ., 2006 ). Thus, the Ras-GAP-induced effects on Rho that are mediated through its association with p190Rho-GAP are the opposite of the Ras-GAP effects on Rho that are mediated by its interaction with DLC1. As DLC1 is localized primarily to focal adhesions, while p190Rho-GAP may be diffusely cytoplasmic or associated with the plasma membrane, the opposite activities of Ras-GAP towards these two Rho regulators might be related to their distinct sub-cellular localization and imply that p190Rho-GAP and DLC1 mediate different physiologic functions. The latter possibility is supported by the observations that genetic disruption of p190Rho-GAP or DLC1 in the mouse results in distinct phenotypes associated with post-natal and embryonic lethality, respectively ( Brouns et al ., 2000 ; Durkin et al ., 2005 ).

Other studies have also implicated the SH3 domain of Ras-GAP in cross-talk with Rho, where it could be relevant that p190Rho-GAP-binding induces Ras-GAP to undergo a conformational change that results in a 100-fold increase in the accessibility of the SH3 domain ( Hu and Settleman, 1997 ). A brain-specific Rho-GAP with various names, including p200Rho-GAP, Grit, Rics, and p250 GAP, has been shown to interact with Ras-GAP by binding the SH3 domain of Ras-GAP ( Shang et al ., 2007 ). In addition, a monoclonal antibody that binds the Ras-GAP SH3 domain can block neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid and prevent the formation of actin stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated with growth factors ( Leblanc et al ., 1998 ). Importantly, the inhibitory effects of the antibody could be overcome by activated Rho, but not by activated Ras, implying that the antibody had induced a reduction in Rho activity. Although it is unknown whether these effects depend on DLC, they are compatible with the scenario that the monoclonal antibody had increased the RhoGAP activity of DLC by blocking the interaction with Ras-GAP. As suggested from the above studies, the function of Ras-GAP is complicated. The role of its C-terminus, which contains the Ras-GAP catalytic domain, as a negative regulator of wild type Ras is well established, but the N-terminus of Ras-GAP, which contains the SH2 and SH3 domains, has been implicated in effectors functions, which could be Ras-independent ( Abdellatif et al . 1998 ; Clark et al ., 1997 ; Tocque et al ., 1997 ).

Our studies suggesting that Ras-GAP can promote the growth of cells containing mutant Ras add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that Ras-GAP might represent a valid therapeutic target. Approximately 30% of all tumors carry a mutant Ras ( Forbes et al ., 2006 ), and there is a particular need for improved therapeutic approaches to tumors with mutant Ras, which are often associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis ( Baselga and Rosen, 2008 ). Several activities that may depend on the SH3 domain of Ras-GAP could promote growth and/or be anti-apoptotic, including the activation of survivin and Akt and the inactivation of DLC ( Gigoux et al ., 2002 ; Yue et al ., 2004 ; Zhou et al ., 2004 ). The monoclonal antibody that binds the SH3 domain of Ras-GAP can be pro-apoptotic ( Lelanc et al ., 1999 ). Similar results have also been seen, in tumor lines with mutant Ras, and even one with wild type Ras, with an aptamer that specifically binds the Ras-GAP SH3 domain ( Pamonsinlapatham, et al ., 2008 ). We speculate that the observed pro-apoptotic activity may be result from interfering with the multiple pathways that appear to be inhibited by blocking the binding activity of the SH3 domain, which therefore make it an attractive molecular target for therapeutic intervention.
