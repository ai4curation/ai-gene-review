BRCA1 is a susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer with 
growth-inhibitory activity for which the mechanism of action remains unclear. 
When introduced into cells, BRCA1 inhibits growth of some but not all cell 
lines. In an attempt to uncover the mechanism of growth suppression by BRCA1, we 
examined a panel of cell lines for their ability to reduce colony outgrowth in 
response to BRCA1 overexpression. Of all variables tested, only those cells with 
wild-type pRb were sensitive to BRCA1-induced growth suppression. In cells with 
an intact rb gene, inactivation of pRb by HPV E7 abrogates the growth arrest 
imposed by BRCA1. In accordance with these observations, we found that BRCA1 
could not suppress BrdUrd uptake in primary fibroblasts from rb-/- mice and 
exhibited an intermediate ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in rb+/- as compared 
with rb+/+ cells. We further found that the BRCA1 protein complexes with the 
hypophosphorylated form of pRb. This binding is localized to amino acids 304-394 
of BRCA1 protein and requires the ABC domain of pRb. In-frame deletion of BRCA1 
fragment involved in interaction with pRb completely abolished the 
growth-suppressive property of BRCA1. Although it has been reported that BRCA1 
interacts with p53, we find the p53 status did not affect the ability of BRCA1 
to suppress colony formation. Our data suggest that the growth suppressor 
function of BRCA1 depends, at least in part, on Rb.

Abstract

BRCA1 is a susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian
cancer with growth-inhibitory activity for which the mechanism of
action remains unclear. When introduced into cells, BRCA1 inhibits growth of some but not all cell lines. In an attempt to
uncover the mechanism of growth suppression by BRCA1 , we
examined a panel of cell lines for their ability to reduce colony
outgrowth in response to BRCA1 overexpression. Of all
variables tested, only those cells with wild-type pRb were sensitive to BRCA1 -induced growth suppression. In cells with an intact rb gene, inactivation of pRb by HPV E7 abrogates the
growth arrest imposed by BRCA1 . In accordance with these
observations, we found that BRCA1 could not suppress BrdUrd
uptake in primary fibroblasts from rb −/− mice and
exhibited an intermediate ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in rb +/− as compared with rb +/+ cells. We
further found that the BRCA1 protein complexes with the
hypophosphorylated form of pRb. This binding is localized to amino
acids 304–394 of BRCA1 protein and requires the ABC domain of pRb.
In-frame deletion of BRCA1 fragment involved in interaction with pRb
completely abolished the growth-suppressive property of BRCA1 . Although it has been reported that BRCA1 interacts with p53, we find the p53 status did not affect the ability
of BRCA1 to suppress colony formation. Our data suggest
that the growth suppressor function of BRCA1 depends, at
least in part, on Rb.

Discussion

We have found that the ability of BRCA1 to suppress growth depends
on the presence of a functional Rb protein. Although pRb may be
required for BRCA1-mediated growth arrest, we recognize that this, in
itself, is not evidence that the direct biochemical interaction of the
two proteins is responsible for BRCA1 growth inhibition. pRb serves as
a downstream effector in several pathways associated with growth
suppression, and BRCA1 could presumably act upstream of pRb in any of
these pathways, requiring pRb only as the final acceptor of the
negative growth signal.

One intriguing candidate for downstream effector of BRCA1 growth inhibition appeared to be p21 Waf1/Cip1 .
Evidence exists showing that BRCA1 can activate the
transcription of p21 even in the absence of p53, suggesting a
p53-independent pathway ( 19 ). Our data show that this cannot be the
only mechanism for BRCA1 -induced growth inhibition. First,
no p21 protein induction was observed at low levels (2- to 5-fold) of BRCA1 overexpression achieved in transfection of U2OS cells
(data not shown). Second, p21 induction blocked cell proliferation of
Rb negative SAOS-2 cells ( 20 ). Thus, we believe that at levels of BRCA1 overexpression usually achieved in transfection
experiments, BRCA1 uses pathways other than a p21-mediated
mechanism to block cell proliferation.

While the manuscript was in preparation, the association of BRCA1 with components of the histone deacetylase complex was
reported ( 21 ). This finding provides yet another possible explanation
of how BRCA1 growth arrest may depend on Rb. The complex of
Rb with histone deacetylase is thought to suppress transcription of
E2F-responsive genes. BRCA1 may target this complex to
specific genes regulated by progression through the cell cycle or after
DNA damage or differentiation. The inhibition of estrogen receptor
signaling by overexpressed BRCA1 as recently reported ( 22 )
also supports this hypothesis.

The BRCA1/Rb interaction may have interesting clinical
ramifications. If pRb is a biochemical modulator of BRCA1 action, then it is conceivable that reductions in the level of pRb
expression in breast epithelia may induce a BRCA1 “null” phenocopy only in BRCA1 carriers with
potentially reduced BRCA1 expression. In this case,
environmental or pharmacological factors that augment pRb expression
may serve to delay the onset of cancers in these susceptible women.
