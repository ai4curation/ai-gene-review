BRCA1 is a susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer with 
growth-inhibitory activity for which the mechanism of action remains unclear. 
When introduced into cells, BRCA1 inhibits growth of some but not all cell 
lines. In an attempt to uncover the mechanism of growth suppression by BRCA1, we 
examined a panel of cell lines for their ability to reduce colony outgrowth in 
response to BRCA1 overexpression. Of all variables tested, only those cells with 
wild-type pRb were sensitive to BRCA1-induced growth suppression. In cells with 
an intact rb gene, inactivation of pRb by HPV E7 abrogates the growth arrest 
imposed by BRCA1. In accordance with these observations, we found that BRCA1 
could not suppress BrdUrd uptake in primary fibroblasts from rb-/- mice and 
exhibited an intermediate ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in rb+/- as compared 
with rb+/+ cells. We further found that the BRCA1 protein complexes with the 
hypophosphorylated form of pRb. This binding is localized to amino acids 304-394 
of BRCA1 protein and requires the ABC domain of pRb. In-frame deletion of BRCA1 
fragment involved in interaction with pRb completely abolished the 
growth-suppressive property of BRCA1. Although it has been reported that BRCA1 
interacts with p53, we find the p53 status did not affect the ability of BRCA1 
to suppress colony formation. Our data suggest that the growth suppressor 
function of BRCA1 depends, at least in part, on Rb.

BRCA1 is a susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian
cancer with growth-inhibitory activity for which the mechanism of
action remains unclear. When introduced into cells, BRCA1
inhibits growth of some but not all cell lines. In an attempt to
uncover the mechanism of growth suppression by BRCA1, we
examined a panel of cell lines for their ability to reduce colony
outgrowth in response to BRCA1 overexpression. Of all
variables tested, only those cells with wild-type pRb were sensitive to
BRCA1-induced growth suppression. In cells with an intact
rb gene, inactivation of pRb by HPV E7 abrogates the
growth arrest imposed by BRCA1. In accordance with these
observations, we found that BRCA1 could not suppress BrdUrd
uptake in primary fibroblasts from rb−/− mice and
exhibited an intermediate ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in
rb+/− as compared with rb+/+ cells. We
further found that the BRCA1 protein complexes with the
hypophosphorylated form of pRb. This binding is localized to amino
acids 304–394 of BRCA1 protein and requires the ABC domain of pRb.
In-frame deletion of BRCA1 fragment involved in interaction with pRb
completely abolished the growth-suppressive property of
BRCA1. Although it has been reported that BRCA1
interacts with p53, we find the p53 status did not affect the ability
of BRCA1 to suppress colony formation. Our data suggest
that the growth suppressor function of BRCA1 depends, at
least in part, on Rb.
