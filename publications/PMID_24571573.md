GAS2L3 is a recently identified tubulin- and actin-binding protein that 
regulates cytokinesis and abscission. In this study we show that GAS2L3 
interacts with the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which plays key roles in 
mitosis and cytokinesis. Biochemical assays show that GAS2L3 directly interacts 
with the C-terminus of borealin and the N-terminus of survivin. We find that the 
interaction between these two CPC subunits and GAS2L3 is mediated by the 
conserved GAR domain of GAS2L3. We further show that the GAR domain of GAS2L3 is 
required for localization of GAS2L3 to the constriction zone. Taken together 
these data suggest that GAS2L3 is a downstream effector of the CPC during 
cytokinetic abscission.
