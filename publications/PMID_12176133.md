OBJECTIVES: Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for endothelial 
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. BH4 levels are regulated by de novo 
biosynthesis; the rate-limiting enzyme is GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH). BH4 
activates and promotes homodimerisation of purified eNOS protein, but the 
intracellular mechanisms underlying BH4-mediated eNOS regulation in endothelial 
cells remain less clear. We aimed to investigate the role of BH4 levels in 
intracellular eNOS regulation, by targeting the BH4 synthetic pathway as a novel 
strategy to modulate intracellular BH4 levels.
METHODS: We constructed a recombinant adenovirus, AdGCH, encoding human GTPCH. 
We infected human endothelial cells with AdGCH, investigated the changes in 
intracellular biopterin levels, and determined the effects on eNOS enzymatic 
activity, protein levels and dimerisation.
RESULTS: GTPCH gene transfer in EAhy926 endothelial cells increased BH4 >10-fold 
compared with controls (cells alone or control adenovirus infection), and 
greatly enhanced NO production in a dose-dependent, eNOS-specific manner. We 
found that eNOS was principally monomeric in control cells, whereas GTPCH gene 
transfer resulted in a striking increase in eNOS homodimerisation. Furthermore, 
the total amounts of both native eNOS protein and a recombinant eNOS-GFP fusion 
protein were significantly increased following GTPCH gene transfer.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that GTPCH gene transfer is a valid approach 
to increase BH4 levels in human endothelial cells, and provide new evidence for 
the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying BH4-mediated eNOS 
regulation in intact human endothelial cells. Additionally, these observations 
suggest that GTPCH may be a rational target to augment endothelial BH4 and 
normalise eNOS activity in endothelial dysfunction states.
