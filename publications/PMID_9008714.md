Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) appears to play a major role in 
skeletal development. Targeted disruption of the PTHrP gene in mice causes 
skeletal dysplasia with accelerated chondrocyte maturation (Amizuka, N., H. 
Warshawsky, J.E. Henderson, D. Goltzman, and A.C. Karaplis. 1994. J. Cell Biol. 
126:1611-1623; Karaplis, A.C., A. Luz, J. Glowacki, R.T. Bronson, V.L.J. 
Tybulewicz, H.M. Kronenberg, and R.C. Mulligan. 1994. Genes Dev. 8: 277-289). A 
constitutively active mutant PTH/PTHrP receptor has been found in Jansen-type 
human metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, a disease characterized by delayed skeletal 
maturation (Schipani, E., K. Kruse, and H. Jüppner. 1995. Science (Wash. DC). 
268:98-100). The molecular mechanisms by which PTHrP affects this developmental 
program remain, however, poorly understood. We report here that PTHrP increases 
the expression of Bcl-2, a protein that controls programmed cell death in 
several cell types, in growth plate chondrocytes both in vitro and in vivo, 
leading to delays in their maturation towards hypertrophy and apoptotic cell 
death. Consequently, overexpression of PTHrP under the control of the collagen 
II promoter in transgenic mice resulted in marked delays in skeletal 
development. As anticipated from these results, deletion of the gene encoding 
Bcl-2 leads to accelerated maturation of chondrocytes and shortening of long 
bones. Thus, Bcl-2 lies downstream of PTHrP in a pathway that controls 
chondrocyte maturation and skeletal development.
