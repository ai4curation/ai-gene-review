The anti-influenza CD8+ T cell response in HLA-A2-positive adults is almost 
exclusively directed at residues 58-66 of the virus matrix protein (MP(58-66)). 
V(beta)17V(alpha)10.2 T cell receptors (TCRs) containing a conserved 
arginine-serine-serine sequence in complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) 
of the V(beta) segment dominate this response. To investigate the molecular 
basis of immunodominant selection in an outbred population, we have determined 
the crystal structure of V(beta)17V(alpha)10.2 in complex with MP(58-66)-HLA-A2 
at a resolution of 1.4 A. We show that, whereas the TCR typically fits over an 
exposed side chain of the peptide, in this structure MP(58-66) exposes only main 
chain atoms. This distinctive orientation of V(beta)17V(alpha)10.2, which is 
almost orthogonal to the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A2, facilitates insertion 
of the conserved arginine in V(beta) CDR3 into a notch in the surface of 
MP(58-66)-HLA-A2. This previously unknown binding mode underlies the 
immunodominant T cell response.
