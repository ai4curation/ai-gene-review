The class III histone deacetylase (HDAC) SIRT1 plays a role in the metabolism, 
aging, and carcinogenesis of organisms and regulates senescence and apoptosis in 
cells. Recent reports revealed that SIRT1 also deacetylates several DNA 
double-strand break (DSB) repair proteins. However, its exact functions in DNA 
repair remained elusive. Using nuclear foci analysis and fluorescence-based, 
chromosomal DSB repair reporter, we find that SIRT1 activity promotes homologous 
recombination (HR) in human cells. Importantly, this effect is unrelated to 
functions of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), another NAD(+)-catabolic 
protein, and does not correlate with cell cycle changes or apoptosis. 
Interestingly, we demonstrate that inactivation of Rad51 does not eliminate the 
effect of SIRT1 on HR. By epistasis-like analysis through knockdown and use of 
mutant cells of distinct SIRT1 target proteins, we show that the non-homologous 
end joining (NHEJ) factor Ku70 as well as the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome protein 
(nibrin) are not needed for this SIRT1-mediated effect, even though a partial 
contribution of nibrin cannot be excluded. Strikingly however, the Werner 
helicase (WRN), which in its mutated form causes premature aging and cancer and 
which was linked to the Rad51-independent single-strand annealing (SSA) DSB 
repair pathway, is required for SIRT1-mediated HR. These results provide first 
evidence that links SIRT1's functions to HR with possible implications for 
genomic stability during aging and tumorigenesis.
