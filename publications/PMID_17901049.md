NAD+ -dependent Sir2 family deacetylases and insulin signaling pathway are both 
conserved across species to regulate aging process. The interplay between these 
two genetic programs is investigated in this study. Protein deacetylase activity 
of SirT1, the mammalian homologue of Sir2, was suppressed through either 
nicotinamide treatment or RNA interference in several cell lines, and these 
cells displayed impaired insulin responses. Suppression of SirT1 activity also 
selectively inhibited insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin 
receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), whereas it had minimal effect on that of IRS-1. 
Further analyses showed that both IRS-1 and IRS-2 interacted with SirT1, and the 
acetylation level of IRS-2 was down-regulated by insulin treatment. Inhibition 
of SirT1 activity prevented deacetylation and insulin-induced tyrosine 
phosphorylation of IRS-2. Mutations of four lysine residues to alanine in IRS-2 
protein, on the other hand, led to its reduced basal level acetylation and 
insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest a possible 
regulatory effect of SirT1 on insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2, 
a vital step in insulin signaling pathway, through deacetylation of IRS-2 
protein. More importantly, this study may imply a pathway through which Sir2 
family protein deacetylases and insulin signaling pathway jointly regulate 
various metabolic processes, including aging and diabetes.
