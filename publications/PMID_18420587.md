B23 (NPM/nucleophosmin) is a multifunctional nucleolar protein and a member of 
the nucleoplasmin superfamily of acidic histone chaperones. B23 is essential for 
normal embryonic development and plays an important role in genomic stability, 
ribosome biogenesis, and anti-apoptotic signaling. Altered protein expression or 
genomic mutation of B23 is encountered in many different forms of cancer. 
Although described as multifunctional, a genuine molecular function of B23 is 
not fully understood. Here we show that B23 is associated with a protein complex 
consisting of ribosomal proteins and ribosome-associated RNA helicases. A novel, 
RNA-independent interaction between ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9) and B23 was 
further investigated. We found that S9 binding requires an intact B23 
oligomerization domain. Depletion of S9 by small interfering RNA resulted in 
decreased protein synthesis and G(1) cell cycle arrest, in association with 
induction of p53 target genes. We determined that S9 is a short-lived protein in 
the absence of ribosome biogenesis, and proteasomal inhibition significantly 
increased S9 protein level. Overexpression of B23 facilitated nucleolar storage 
of S9, whereas knockdown of B23 led to diminished levels of nucleolar S9. Our 
results suggest that B23 selectively stores, and protects ribosomal protein S9 
in nucleoli and therefore could facilitate ribosome biogenesis.
