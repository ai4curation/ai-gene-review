Draculin, a glycoprotein isolated from vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) saliva, 
is a natural anticoagulant which inhibits activated coagulation factors IX (IXa) 
and X (Xa). The observation that under captivity conditions, the anticoagulant 
activity present in vampire bat saliva is dependent upon the salivation 
protocol, led us to investigate the possible relationship between the expression 
of biological activity of native draculin and the post-translational 
glycosylation of the protein backbone. Daily salivation of vampire bats yields a 
saliva that progressively decreases in anticoagulant activity, without any 
significant change in overall protein content, or in the amount of protein 
specifically recognized by a polyclonal anti-draculin antibody. Anticoagulant 
activity of the saliva is restored after a 4-day period of rest. Besides the 
marked difference in anticoagulant activity, purified native draculin, obtained 
from high- and low-activity saliva, shows significant differences in: (a) 
composition of the carbohydrate moiety, and (b) Glycosylation pattern. 
Furthermore, controlled chemical deglycosylation of native draculin, under 
conditions that do not affect the polypeptide backbone, progressively leads to 
complete loss of the biological activity. Our present results implicate that 
correct glycosylation of draculin is a seminal event for the expression of the 
biological activity of this glycoprotein.
