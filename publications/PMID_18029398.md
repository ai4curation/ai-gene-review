Sm-like (Lsm) proteins are ubiquitous, multifunctional proteins that are 
involved in the processing and/or turnover of many RNAs. In eukaryotes, a 
hetero-heptameric complex of seven Lsm proteins (Lsm2-8) affects the processing 
of small stable RNAs and pre-mRNAs in the nucleus, whereas a different 
hetero-heptameric complex of Lsm proteins (Lsm1-7) promotes mRNA decapping and 
decay in the cytoplasm. These two complexes have six constituent proteins in 
common, yet localize to separate cellular compartments and perform apparently 
disparate functions. Little is known about the biogenesis of the Lsm complexes, 
or how they are recruited to different cellular compartments. We show that, in 
yeast, the nuclear accumulation of Lsm proteins depends on complex formation and 
that the Lsm8p subunit plays a crucial role. The nuclear localization of Lsm8p 
is itself most strongly influenced by Lsm2p and Lsm4p, its presumed neighbours 
in the Lsm2-8p complex. Furthermore, overexpression and depletion experiments 
imply that Lsm1p and Lsm8p act competitively with respect to the localization of 
the two complexes, suggesting a potential mechanism for co-regulation of nuclear 
and cytoplasmic RNA processing. A shift of Lsm proteins from the nucleus to the 
cytoplasm under stress conditions indicates that this competition is 
biologically significant.
