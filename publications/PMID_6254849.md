Nucleotide sequence of the filamentous bacteriophage M13 DNA genome: comparison 
with phage fd.

van Wezenbeek PM, Hulsebos TJ, Schoenmakers JG.

The 6407 nucleotide-long sequence of bacteriophage M13 DNA has been determined 
using both the chemical degradation and chain-termination methods of DNA 
sequencing. This sequence has been compared with that of the closely related 
bacteriophage fd (Beck et al., 1978). M13 DNA appears to be only a single 
nucleotide shorter than fd DNA. There is an average of 3.0% of 
nucleotide-sequence differences between the two genomes, but the distribution of 
these changes is not random; the sequence of some genes is more conserved than 
of others. In contrast, the nucleotide sequences and positions of the regulatory 
elements involved in transcription, translation and replication appear to be 
identical in both filamentous phage DNA genomes.
