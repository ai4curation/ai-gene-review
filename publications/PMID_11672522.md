The NAD-dependent histone deacetylation of Sir2 connects cellular metabolism 
with gene silencing as well as aging in yeast. Here, we show that mammalian 
Sir2alpha physically interacts with p53 and attenuates p53-mediated functions. 
Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) inhibits an NAD-dependent p53 deacetylation induced by 
Sir2alpha, and also enhances the p53 acetylation levels in vivo. Furthermore, 
Sir2alpha represses p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage and 
oxidative stress, whereas expression of a Sir2alpha point mutant increases the 
sensitivity of cells in the stress response. Thus, our findings implicate a p53 
regulatory pathway mediated by mammalian Sir2alpha. These results have 
significant implications regarding an important role for Sir2alpha in modulating 
the sensitivity of cells in p53-dependent apoptotic response and the possible 
effect in cancer therapy.
