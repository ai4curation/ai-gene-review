Alpha-crystallins are molecular chaperones that protect vertebrate eye lens 
proteins from detrimental protein aggregation. alphaB-Crystallin, 1 of the 2 
alpha-crystallin isoforms, is also associated with myopathies and 
neuropathological diseases. Despite the importance of alpha-crystallins in 
protein homeostasis, only little is known about their quaternary structures 
because of their seemingly polydisperse nature. Here, we analyzed the structures 
of recombinant alpha-crystallins using biophysical methods. In contrast to 
previous reports, we show that alphaB-crystallin assembles into defined 
oligomers consisting of 24 subunits. The 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of 
alphaB-crystallin by electron microscopy reveals a sphere-like structure with 
large openings to the interior of the protein. alphaA-Crystallin forms, in 
addition to complexes of 24 subunits, also smaller oligomers and large clusters 
consisting of individual oligomers. This propensity might explain the previously 
reported polydisperse nature of alpha-crystallin.
