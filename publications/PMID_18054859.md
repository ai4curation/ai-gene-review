Synaptogenesis is a highly regulated process that underlies formation of neural 
circuitry. Considerable work has demonstrated the capability of some adhesion 
molecules, such as SynCAM and Neurexins/Neuroligins, to induce synapse formation 
in vitro. Furthermore, Cdk5 gain of function results in an increased number of 
synapses in vivo. To gain a better understanding of how Cdk5 might promote 
synaptogenesis, we investigated potential crosstalk between Cdk5 and the cascade 
of events mediated by synapse-inducing proteins. One protein recruited to 
developing terminals by SynCAM and Neurexins/Neuroligins is the MAGUK family 
member CASK. We found that Cdk5 phosphorylates and regulates CASK distribution 
to membranes. In the absence of Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation, CASK is not 
recruited to developing synapses and thus fails to interact with essential 
presynaptic components. Functional consequences include alterations in calcium 
influx. Mechanistically, Cdk5 regulates the interaction between CASK and 
liprin-alpha. These results provide a molecular explanation of how Cdk5 can 
promote synaptogenesis.
