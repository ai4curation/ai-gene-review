Polyadenylation of messenger RNA precursors requires a complex protein machinery 
that is closely integrated with the even more complex transcriptional apparatus. 
Here a polyadenylation factor, CstF-50 (cleavage stimulation factor), is shown 
to interact in vitro and in intact cells with a nuclear protein of previously 
unknown function, BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1). The 
BARD1-CstF-50 interaction inhibits polyadenylation in vitro. BARD1, like 
CstF-50, also interacts with RNA polymerase II. These results indicate that 
BARD1-mediated inhibition of polyadenylation may prevent inappropriate RNA 
processing during transcription, perhaps at sites of DNA repair, and they reveal 
an unanticipated integration of diverse nuclear events.
