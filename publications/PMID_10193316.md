Histological examination of long bones from 1-day-old bcl-2 knockout and 
age-matched control mice revealed no obvious differences in length of bone, 
growth plate architecture or stage of endochondral ossification. In 35-day-old 
bcl-2 knockout mice that are growth retarded or 'dwarfed'. the proliferative 
zone of the growth plate appeared slightly thinner and the secondary centres of 
ossification less well developed than their age-matched wild-type controls. The 
most marked histological effects of bcl-2 ablation were on osteoblasts and bone. 
35-day-old knockout mouse bones exhibited far greater numbers of osteoblasts 
than controls and the osteoblasts had a cuboidal phenotype in comparison with 
the normal flattened cell appearance. In addition, the collagen deposited by the 
osteoblasts in the bcl-2 knockout mouse bone was disorganized in comparison with 
control tissue and had a pseudo-woven appearance. The results suggest an 
important role for Bcl-2 in controlling osteoblast phenotype and bone deposition 
in vivo.
