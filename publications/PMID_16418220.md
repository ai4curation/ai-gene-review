Desmocollin 3 (Dsc3) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the 
cadherin family of cell adhesion receptors. Together with desmoglein(s), it 
forms the transmembrane core of desmosomes, a multiprotein complex involved in 
cell adhesion, organization of the cytoskeleton, cell sorting and cell 
signaling. Previous reports have suggested that Dsc3 synthesis is largely 
restricted to stratified epithelia, and that it plays a role in the proper 
differentiation of these tissues during mammalian embryonic development. To test 
these hypotheses, we generated Dsc3-null mice. Unexpectedly, homozygous mutants 
show a pre-implantation lethal phenotype. In fact, most mutants die even before 
mature desmosomes are formed in the embryo, suggesting a new and unexpected role 
of Dsc3 during early development.
