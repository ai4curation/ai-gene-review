Efs was originally found by expression cloning of a mouse embryo cDNA library 
through its Fyn-SH3 binding capacity (Ishino et al., Oncogene 11, 2331-2338, 
1995). Efs has characteristic regions important in intracellular signal 
transduction; these are an SH3 domain, a cluster of putative ligands for SH2 
domains and proline-rich sequences with SH3-binding consensus. In this paper, we 
report cDNA cloning of human Efs and a variant of it from a hippocampal cDNA 
library. The human Efs gene was mapped to chromosome 14q11.2-q12 by fluorescence 
in situ hybridization. We identified two forms of human Efs, designated hEfs1 
and hEfs2. hEfs1 represents the human counterpart of original mouse embryo Efs 
(mEfs1). hEfs2, the newly identified form, is identical to hEfs1, except for its 
lack of the SH3 domain. hEfs1 and mEfs1 are 80% identical in their amino acid 
sequences and 100% identical within the SH3 domain. Reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction analysis of adult mouse tissue RNA indicated 
expression of Efs2 and of Efs1 in various tissues. Evidence suggesting the 
presence of the Efs2 protein in human tissue was obtained by immunoprecipitation 
followed by immunoblotting with two different anti-Efs antibodies. Possible 
functions of Efs2 are discussed.
