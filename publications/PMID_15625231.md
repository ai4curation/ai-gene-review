Functional analysis of chromosomal segments containing linked genes requires the 
insertion of contiguous genomic sequences from bacterial artificial chromosomes 
(BACs) into the genome. Therefore, we introduced a 90-kb large BAC clone 
carrying a 10-copy tandem array of kafirin storage protein genes from sorghum 
linkage group J, mixed with a selectable marker gene, directly into maize cells 
using the particle bombardment method. Transgenic plants were regenerated and 
seeds from eight different transgenic lines were produced. One such transgenic 
plant was selected that had the entire kafirin gene cluster on a single 
continuous DNA fragment spanning more than 45 kb integrated into its genome. 
When alcohol-soluble proteins from individual T2 and T3 seeds of this event were 
analyzed, significant levels of kafirin were found in addition to the endogenous 
zein storage proteins, demonstrating that the large exogenous DNA segment is 
stably integrated into the maize genome and expressed at high levels in 
subsequent generations. Therefore, we could provide a new utility of plant 
transformation by the particle bombardment method for functional genomics of 
multigene families and the modification of the nutritive quality of cereal 
grains. Despite a tandem array of highly homologous sequences at the transgenic 
locus, no gene silencing was observed, probably owing to the effects of 
co-transformed flanking sequences. The expression studies of the transgenic 
locus also revealed new features of storage protein gene promoters that differed 
from previous transient gene expression studies, thereby illustrating the 
significance of the concentration and configuration of DNA-protein interactions 
in the regulation of gene expression.
