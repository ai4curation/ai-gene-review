In animal cells, centriole number is strictly controlled in order to guarantee 
faithful cell division and genetic stability, but the mechanism by which the 
accuracy of centrosome duplication is maintained is not fully understood. Here, 
we show that CCDC84 constrains centriole number by modulating APC/CCdh1-mediated 
HsSAS-6 degradation. More importantly, CCDC84 acetylation oscillates throughout 
the cell cycle, and the acetylation state of CCDC84 at lysine 31 is regulated by 
the deacetylase SIRT1 and the acetyltransferase NAT10. Deacetylated CCDC84 is 
responsible for its centrosome targeting, and acetylated CCDC84 promotes HsSAS-6 
ubiquitination by enhancing the binding affinity of HsSAS-6 for Cdh1. Our 
findings shed new light on the function of (de)acetylation in centriole number 
regulation as well as refine the established centrosome duplication model.
