We demonstrate that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the tandem array of ribosomal 
RNA genes (RDN1) is a target for integration of the Ty1 retrotransposon that 
results in silencing of Ty1 transcription and transposition. Ty1 elements 
transpose into random rDNA repeat units and are mitotically stable. In addition, 
we have found that mutation of several putative modifiers of RDN1 chromatin 
structure abolishes silencing of Ty1 elements in the rDNA array. Disruption of 
SIR2, which elevates recombination in RDN1, or TOP1, which increases psoralen 
accessibility in rDNA, or HTA1-HTB1, which reduces histone H2A-H2B levels and 
causes localized chromatin perturbations, abolishes transcriptional silencing of 
Ty1 elements in RDN1. Furthermore, deletion of the gene for the ubiquitin 
conjugating enzyme Ubc2p, which ubiquitinates histones in vitro, derepresses not 
only Ty1 transcription but also mitotic recombination in RDN1. On the basis of 
these results, we propose that a specialized chromatin structure exists in RDN1 
that silences transcription of the Ty1 retrotransposon.
