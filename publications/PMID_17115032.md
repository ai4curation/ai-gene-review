The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential protein for DNA 
replication and damage repair. How its function is controlled remains an 
important question. Here, we show that the chromatin-bound PCNA protein is 
phosphorylated on Tyr 211, which is required for maintaining its function on 
chromatin and is dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of EGF receptor 
(EGFR) in the nucleus. Phosphorylation on Tyr 211 by EGFR stabilizes 
chromatin-bound PCNA protein and associated functions. Consistently, increased 
PCNA Tyr 211 phosphorylation coincides with pronounced cell proliferation, and 
is better correlated with poor survival of breast cancer patients, as well as 
nuclear EGFR in tumours, than is the total PCNA level. These results identify a 
novel nuclear mechanism linking tyrosine kinase receptor function with the 
regulation of the PCNA sliding clamp.
