OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate angiogenesis by posttranscriptional 
silencing of target genes. The significance of angiostatic miR-200b in switching 
on skin wound angiogenesis was tested.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Wounding caused imminent and transient downregulation of 
miR-200b in dermal wound-edge endothelial cells. Derailing this injury response 
by lentiviral delivery of miR-200b in vivo impaired wound angiogenesis. 
Computational prediction, target reporter luciferase assay, and Western blot 
analysis provided first evidence that miR-200b targets globin transcription 
factor binding protein 2 (GATA2) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
2 (VEGFR2). Overexpression of GATA2 or VEGFR2 in endothelial cells rescued the 
angiostatic effect of miR-200b in vitro. Downregulation of miR-200b derepressed 
GATA2 and VEGFR2 expression to switch on wound angiogenesis, which was disrupted 
in diabetic wounds. Treatment of endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor-α, 
a proinflammatory cytokine abundant in diabetic wounds, induced miR-200b 
expression, silenced GATA2 and VEGFR2, and suppressed angiogenesis. These 
outcomes were attenuated using anti-miR-200b strategy. Neutralization of tumor 
necrosis factor-α in the diabetic wounds improved wound angiogenesis and 
closure, which was accompanied by downregulation of miR-200b expression and 
desilencing of GATA2 and VEGFR2.
CONCLUSIONS: Injury-induced repression of miR-200b turned on wound angiogenesis. 
In mice with diabetes mellitus,excessive tumor necrosis factor-α induced 
miR-200b blunting proangiogenic functions of GATA2 and VEGFR2.

Methods and Results

Wounding caused imminent and transient downregulation of miR-200b in dermal wound-edge endothelial cells. Derailing this injury response by lentiviral delivery of miR-200b in vivo impaired wound angiogenesis. Computational prediction, target reporter luciferase assay, and Western blot analysis provided first evidence that miR-200b targets globin transcription factor binding protein 2 (GATA2) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Overexpression of GATA2 or VEGFR2 in endothelial cells rescued the angiostatic effect of miR-200b in vitro. Downregulation of miR-200b derepressed GATA2 and VEGFR2 expression to switch on wound angiogenesis, which was disrupted in diabetic wounds. Treatment of endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor-α, a proinflammatory cytokine abundant in diabetic wounds, induced miR-200b expression, silenced GATA2 and VEGFR2, and suppressed angiogenesis. These outcomes were attenuated using anti-miR-200b strategy. Neutralization of tumor necrosis factor-α in the diabetic wounds improved wound angiogenesis and closure, which was accompanied by downregulation of miR-200b expression and desilencing of GATA2 and VEGFR2.

Conclusion

Injury-induced repression of miR-200b turned on wound angiogenesis. In mice with diabetes mellitus, excessive tumor necrosis factor-α induced miR-200b blunting proangiogenic functions of GATA2 and VEGFR2.

Discussion

miR-200b belongs to the miR-200 family member which controls epithelial-mesenchymal transition. 7 Loss of miR-200b induces a mesenchymal phenotype, enhanced motility, and invasiveness of wide variety of transformed cells. 7 Our group and others have reported that miR-200b not only modulates cell motility but also controls several proangiogenic proteins regulating endothelial cell function. The current work establishes that acute transient down-regulation of endothelial miR-200b is critical for successful angiogenic outcome during the cutaneous wound healing process. It also provides first evidence demonstrating that GATA2 serves as a novel direct target of miR-200b- regulating angiogenic response. GATA2, a zinc finger transcription factor involved in hematopoietic and endothelial development, is the most abundantly expressed GATA factor in endothelial cells. 17 Besides its role in regulating the promoter of many endothelial specific genes including endothelin-1, von Willebrand factor, and VE-cadherin, 17 GATA2 modulates angiogenesis in response to mechano-sensitive stimuli in a p190RhoGAP-dependent fashion. 14 It also controls several genes including matrix metallo-proteinase-2 18 and endomucin 19 to support endothelial cell migration. This is consistent with the findings from the current investigation indicating that endogenous GATA2 critically supports angiogenesis. Although the transcriptional control of GATA2 has been well studied, 17 little is known about its posttranscriptional regulation. So far, only 2 studies addressing miR-dependent posttranscriptional modification of GATA2 have been reported. 20 , 21 The current investigation provides first evidence establishing that miR-200b directly binds to GATA2 3′UTR and induces translational repression. During the preparation of this article, Choi et al 8 reported that miR-200b directly targets VEGFR2, which is in agreement with our observation in the reporter assay and Western blot analysis. Observations from rescue experiments reported herein validate that the miR-200b-dependent antiangiogenic response is mediated by posttranscriptional silencing of GATA2 and VEGFR2. Given that GATA2 directly transactivates the promoter of VEGFR2, 13 which is consistent with our observation that GATA2 supports VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells, this work elucidates a novel regulatory mechanism wherein VEGFR2 expression is regulated by miR-200b at 2 levels: GATA2-dependent transcriptional and posttranscriptional silencing (direct interaction with the 3′UTR). In fact, the miR-200 family not only targets key players in the VEGF-signaling cascade but also modulates many mediators that potentially block angiogenesis. miR-200a, for example, can target β-catenin, 22 a membrane-bound protein enabling adherens junction formation and thus stabilizing blood vessel. 23 miR-200 family, via silencing notch ligand Jagged-1, 24 can potentially suppress endothelial proliferation and sprouting. 25 Taken together, observations of the present study and the current literature consolidate the concept that miR-200b and its associated family members silence clusters of molecules in different angiogenic circuits to dictate endothelial cell phenotype and functional outcomes.

Several studies have reported the involvement of miR dysregulation in the diabetes mellitus–associated pathogenic angiogenesis. In type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats, upregulation of miR-320 inhibited angiogenic response of myocardial microvascular endothelial cells by targeting insulin-like growth factor 1. 26 Elevation of miR-503 silenced cyclin E1 and cdc25A, subsequently inhibiting angiogenesis in diabetic ischemic muscle. 27 High glucose-induced loss of miR-93, an miR targeting renal endothelial VEGF, resulted in aberrant angiogenesis. 28 In the current work, we demonstrate that diabetic wound-edge endothelial cells suffer from silencing of GATA2 and VEGFR2, which is consistent with previous findings, 29 , 30 via an miR-200b-dependent mechanism.

Excessive TNF-α is known to complicate closure of diabetic wounds. 31 Strategies to antagonize TNF-α improve perfusion 32 and closure of nonhealing wounds. 12 , 31 In diabetic wounds, prolonged overproduction of TNF-α induces fibroblast apoptosis 12 and inhibits fibroblast filopodia formation, 33 resulting in compromised granulation tissue formation. TNF-α overload also desensitizes insulin signal and downregulates insulin receptor in diabetic keratinocytes leading to impairments in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. 34 Intriguingly, TNF-α plays a dual role in regulating the angiogenic behavior of endothelial cells. Physiological low dose of TNF-α induces angiogenesis whereas supraphysiological high dose of TNF-α suppresses angiogenic response. 16 , 35 Persistent stimulation of TNF-α inhibits angiogenic response whereas pulse of TNF-α primes endothelial cells for sprouting. 36 Because of prolonged and unresolved inflammatory response in diabetic wounds, it is expected that dermal microvascular endothelial cells will shift to an antiangiogenic phenotype because of high TNF-α. This work establishes that persistent elevated TNF-α exerts substantial antiangiogenic effects via an miR-200b-GATA2-VEGFR2 mechanism. It also unveils the prospect of using local neutralization of TNF-α as a productive therapeutic strategy.

TNF-α may induce miR-200b via activation of p53. Promoter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that p53 can bind and transactivate the promoter of miR-200b-200a-429 cluster. 37 Knockdown of p53 resulted in suppression of primary miR-200b expression, suggesting that p53 can induce the de novo synthesis of miR-200b. 37 Interestingly, TNF-α may induce p53. 33 This is further supported by the finding from the Kane et al 38 study showing that p53 transcript was aberrantly upregulated in the diabetic wounds after day 3 postwounding. TNF-α-induced expression of miR-200b-200a-429 cluster was attenuated by p53 knockdown ( Figure XVI in the online-only Data Supplement ), suggesting a p53-dependent transcriptional control of endothelial miR-200b in response to TNF-α stimulation. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in diabetic wounds exaggerated TNF-α upregulates miR-200b via activation of p53. In addition, it is possible that miR-200b upregulation could be sustained in a GATA2-dependent self–feed-forward mechanism. Putative GATA binding site has been identified in the miR-200b promoter. 39 Binding of this site by GATA3, a GATA2 homolog, inhibited the expression of miR-200b cluster, 39 suggesting that GATA2 might serve as a negative regulator of miR-200b expression. In this regard, TNF-α-associated upregulation of miR-200b silences GATA2, which might relieve the transrepression of miR-200b promoter, leading to sustained miR-200b expression under conditions of prolonged inflammation. It is noteworthy that this positive feed-forward loop could be further intensified by the self-regulatory mechanism of GATA2 owing to the positive regulation of GATA2 on its own promoter. 17

In summary, this work reports that downregulation of endothelial miR-200b is crucial in turning on cutaneous wound angiogenesis by derepression of GATA2 and VEGFR2 expression. These findings support the concept that injury-responsive acute transient repression of miR serves as a potent signal, which unleashes reparative tissue development in an adult setting. GATA2 is recognized as a validated target of miR-200b. Diabetic wounds exhibit silencing of GATA2 and VEGFR2, which is a consequence of miR-200b being refractory to injury. Elevated TNF-α, as expected in dysregulated diabetic wounds, induces miR-200b which in turn silences angiogenic GATA2 and VEGFR2 ( Figure XVII in the online-only Data Supplement ). Taken together, this work sheds new light on the regulation of wound angiogenesis by miRs and develops the significance of such regulation in the context of diabetic complications.
