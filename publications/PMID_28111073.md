Advances in the synthesis and screening of small-molecule libraries have 
accelerated the discovery of chemical probes for studying biological processes. 
Still, only a small fraction of the human proteome has chemical ligands. Here, 
we describe a platform that marries fragment-based ligand discovery with 
quantitative chemical proteomics to map thousands of reversible small 
molecule-protein interactions directly in human cells, many of which can be 
site-specifically determined. We show that fragment hits can be advanced to 
furnish selective ligands that affect the activity of proteins heretofore 
lacking chemical probes. We further combine fragment-based chemical proteomics 
with phenotypic screening to identify small molecules that promote adipocyte 
differentiation by engaging the poorly characterized membrane protein PGRMC2. 
Fragment-based screening in human cells thus provides an extensive proteome-wide 
map of protein ligandability and facilitates the coordinated discovery of 
bioactive small molecules and their molecular targets.

INTRODUCTION

Chemical probes offer a powerful way to perturb proteins to produce graded (dose-dependent) gain- (agonism) or loss- (antagonism) of-function effects that are acute and reversible in cells and organisms ( Weiss et al., 2007 ). Small molecules that selectively modulate proteins can also serve as leads for the development of novel therapeutics. Most proteins in the human proteome, however, lack chemical probes, and many protein classes are even perceived to be potentially “undruggable” ( Hopkins and Groom, 2002 ).

Chemical probes can be discovered in multiple ways that often involve high-throughput screening (HTS) of individual proteins (target-based) or more complex cell and organismal systems (phenotype based) ( Schenone et al., 2013 ; Swinney and Anthony, 2011 ). HTS, whether it is target or phenotype based, typically uses large chemical libraries (~10 6 ) composed of relatively high-molecular-weight (MW) (300–500 Da) and structurally diverse compounds. Hit compounds from these libraries can prove difficult to optimize due to their size, structural complexity, and suboptimal ligand efficiency ( Hajduk and Greer, 2007 ). Target-based screens are furthermore generally performed with purified proteins and therefore do not provide direct information about the activity of ligands in more complex biological systems (e.g., cells) ( Swinney and Anthony, 2011 ), where factors that regulate protein structure and function, such as subcellular localization, post-translational modification, and protein-protein interactions can affect ligand-protein interactions. Phenotype-based screening, on the other hand, faces the challenge of identifying the molecular target(s) of active compounds, especially in cases where the screening hits display moderate-low potency ( Lee and Bogyo, 2013 ).

Fragment-based ligand and drug discovery (FBLD) has emerged as a versatile approach that addresses some of the challenges noted above. By utilizing smaller numbers (~10 3 ) of low-molecular-weight compounds (<300 Da), typically screened at high concentrations (>100 ∝M), FBLD emphasizes the identification of structurally simple hit compounds that can be efficiently optimized into more potent ligands ( Hajduk and Greer, 2007 ; Scott et al., 2012 ). A core tenet of FBLD is that, by limiting molecular size, a relatively small number of fragments can represent a large fraction of accessible chemical space ( Bembenek et al., 2009 ). For various technical reasons, however, including the general low affinity of fragment hits (>100 ∝M) and the biophysical methods used for their discovery (e.g., NMR, surface plasmon resonance, isothermal calorimetry), FBLD has mainly been limited to in vitro assays with purified proteins ( Scott et al., 2012 ).

We recently described a chemical proteomic analysis of electrophilic fragments that target cysteine residues in hundreds of human proteins in native biological systems ( Backus et al., 2016 ). The covalent interactions of these fragments facilitated target identification, and it has remained an open question whether reversible fragment-protein interactions can be profiled on a similar scale in human cells. This is an important problem because only a subset of the human proteome can be addressed with covalent ligands (e.g., those proteins with nucleophiles in functional sites), and, accordingly, achieving a complete understanding of protein ligandability requires technologies that can globally assess reversible small molecule-protein interactions.

We and others have shown that embedding photoreactive and bioorthogonal reporter groups into bioactive small molecules can facilitate the chemical proteomic analysis of protein targets in cells ( Cisar and Cravatt, 2012 ; Kambe et al., 2014 ; Niphakis et al., 2015 ; Sumranjit and Chung, 2013 ). Here, we hypothesized that this approach could enable proteome-wide FBLD in human cells. Using a set of photoaffinity probes containing fragments common to many drug structures combined with quantitative chemical proteomics, we identify thousands of small molecule-protein interactions in human cells. In follow-up studies, we map the sites of protein binding for many fragments and show that they can be optimized into higher-affinity ligands that affect the function of proteins with good proteome-wide selectivity in cells. Finally, motivated by these findings, we describe the synthesis and phenotypic screening of a larger (~450 member) fragment-based library, leading to the discovery of ligands that promote adipocyte differentiation through targeting the poorly characterized protein PGRMC2.

DISCUSSION

We have described herein a chemical proteomic method to globally map small-molecule fragment-protein interactions directly in human cells. More than 2,000 fragment-binding proteins were discovered, only a small fraction of which was found in DrugBank, highlighting the broad and still largely untapped ligandability of the human proteome. We demonstrated that the discovered fragment-protein interactions can be further advanced to generate selective ligands that modulate the functions of proteins in cells. That the case studies investigated herein include enzymes (PTGR2), transporters (SLC25A20), and poorly characterized transmembrane proteins (PGRMC2) for which selective ligands were previously lacking, underscores the versatility and scope of chemical proteomics for accelerating the discovery of small-molecule probes for diverse categories of proteins.

Our results also provide a useful perspective on the principles of FBLD applied proteome-wide. As anticipated, the fragment-protein interactions discovered in cells appear to be of generally low affinity, as evidenced by the large increase in protein enrichments with higher concentrations of FFF probes (200 versus 20 μM). Still, clear evidence of SARs was found for most fragment-protein interactions, indicating that they reflect authentic recognition events at discrete sites on proteins. This conclusion is also supported by our chemical proteomic data on mapping sites of fragment-binding, which revealed a high overlap (~80%) with computationally predicted pockets on protein structures. These results, taken together, support and extend the generality of concepts about ligandability that have emerged from FBLD studies of individual proteins ( Edfeldt et al., 2011 ; Kozakov et al., 2015 ; Wells and McClendon, 2007 ), including the presence of discrete hotspots on protein surfaces, both active site and other (e.g., allosteric), poised for small-molecule binding and the capacity for simple fragments to interrogate these pockets even in the complex environment of the living cell.

Our studies also provide compelling evidence that FFF probes can streamline the discovery of targets of bioactive small molecules in phenotypic screens. We attribute this success to the incorporation of photoreactive and clickable elements into the screening library itself, which circumvents the need to further derivatize hits prior to initiating target identification. We also emphasize the importance of utilizing inactive control probes and competitors to hone in on targets of pharmacological relevance to the observed phenotype. The discovery of apparent gain-of-function ligands for PGRMC2 that promote adipogenesis, combined with the independent proadipogenic activity displayed by PGRMC2 when overexpressed in preadipocytes, designates this poorly characterized membrane protein as a potentially important regulator of adipocyte differentiation and function. It is tempting to speculate that the chemical probes discovered herein may mimic the action of metabolites that serve as endogenous ligands for PGRMC2, and our initial studies point to heme-related molecules as potential candidates to serve this function. FFF probes like 25 should facilitate the discovery and further characterization of such endogenous ligands by forming the basis for competitive displacement assays, as we have demonstrated for PGRMC2 interactions with heme-related molecules ( Figure S7H ) and could be extended to more broadly survey small-molecule extracts of cells/tissues ( Kim et al., 2011 ).

Projecting forward, we believe that chemical proteomic methods for fragment-based ligand discovery have the potential to fill major gaps in small-molecule probe development by enabling the discovery of reversible ligands, and the sites of ligand binding, for many proteins in parallel directly in human cells. In this manner, the FFF platform described herein complements and augments recently described approaches to discover covalent, cysteine-reactive ligands ( Backus et al., 2016 ) and ligands targeting lipid-binding proteins in proteomes ( Niphakis et al., 2015 ), as well as biophysical methods, such as thermal shift assays, to measure drug-protein engagement in cells ( Martinez Molina et al., 2013 ; Savitski et al., 2014 ). There are also some technical limitations of the FFF platform. As expected for structurally simple fragments, the FFF probes are promiscuous in their proteomic interactions, which may limit the detection of lower abundance proteins in cells. The use of targeted or semi-targeted proteomic methods should increase dynamic range and sensitivity ( Picotti and Aebersold, 2012 ). Also, while we have shown that competitive profiling of structurally elaborated fragment-based libraries can facilitate the advancement of hit fragments into more potent and selective cell-active probes, it is likely that such chemical proteomic approaches will need to be combined with more structure-guided methods to create a general strategy for ligand optimization ( Kolb et al., 2009 ; Sliwoski et al., 2013 ). This integrated approach may be especially important for advancing the many fragment hits discovered herein for proteins that belong to classes historically viewed as “undruggable,” such as transcription factors and adaptor proteins.

Finally, we also believe that chemical proteomic methods for ligand discovery and optimization should benefit from recent advances in synthetic methodology, which have described many reactions for the late-stage chemical derivatization of small molecules ( Brückl et al., 2012 ; Dai et al., 2011 ). One could even envision creating an FFF library where sites for end-stage derivatization are built into the probes such that fragments with provocative target profiles are efficiently converted into diversified sub-libraries that are then rescreened in human cells to optimize many ligand-target pairs in parallel. In this way, the full ligandability of the human proteome can be empirically defined and efficiently exploited to furnish chemical probes for investigations of human biology.
