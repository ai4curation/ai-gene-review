Chromatin remodeling and histone modifications facilitate access of 
transcription factors to DNA by promoting the unwinding and destabilization of 
histone-DNA interactions. We present DPF3, a new epigenetic key factor for heart 
and muscle development characterized by a double PHD finger. DPF3 is associated 
with the BAF chromatin remodeling complex and binds methylated and acetylated 
lysine residues of histone 3 and 4. Thus, DPF3 may represent the first plant 
homeodomains that bind acetylated lysines, a feature previously only shown for 
the bromodomain. During development Dpf3 is expressed in the heart and somites 
of mouse, chicken, and zebrafish. Morpholino knockdown of dpf3 in zebrafish 
leads to incomplete cardiac looping and severely reduced ventricular 
contractility, with disassembled muscular fibers caused by transcriptional 
deregulation of structural and regulatory proteins. Promoter analysis identified 
Dpf3 as a novel downstream target of Mef2a. Taken together, DPF3 adds a further 
layer of complexity to the BAF complex by representing a tissue-specific anchor 
between histone acetylations as well as methylations and chromatin remodeling. 
Furthermore, this shows that plant homeodomain proteins play a yet unexplored 
role in recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes to acetylated histones.
