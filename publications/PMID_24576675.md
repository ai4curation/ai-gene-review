BACKGROUND: Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's 
disease (PD). Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided 
valuable insights into the mechanisms of cellular dysfunction associated with 
the expression of faulty PD genes.
METHODS: We developed a yeast model for full-length LRRK2 studies. We expressed 
wild-type (wt) LRRK2 and mutations and evaluated their role during oxidative 
stress conditions. The involvement of mitochondria was assessed by using 
rho-zero mutants and by evaluating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and 
mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry. The involvement of 
endocytosis was also studied by testing several endocytic mutants and by 
following the vacuolar delivery of the probe FM4-64.
RESULTS: Expression of LRRK2 in yeast was associated to increased hydrogen 
peroxide resistance. This phenotype, which was dependent on mitochondrial 
function, was not observed for PD-mutants G2019S and R1441C or in the absence of 
the kinase activity and the WD40 repeat domain. Expression of the pathogenic 
mutants stimulated ROS production and increased mitochondrial membrane 
potential. For the PD-mutants, but not for wild-type LRRK2, endocytic defects 
were also observed. Additionally, several endocytic proteins were required for 
LRRK2-mediated protection against hydrogen peroxide.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LRRK2 confers cellular protection during 
oxidative stress depending on mitochondrial function and endocytosis.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Both the loss of capacity of LRRK2 pathogenic mutants to 
protect against oxidative stress and their enhancement of dysfunction may be 
important for the development of PD during the aging process.
