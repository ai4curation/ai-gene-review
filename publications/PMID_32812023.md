Accumulation of phosphorylated tau is a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's 
disease. Phosphorylated tau accumulation causes synaptic impairment, neuronal 
dysfunction and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The pathological actions 
of phosphorylated tau are mediated by surrounding neuronal proteins; however, a 
comprehensive understanding of the proteins that phosphorylated tau interacts 
with in Alzheimer's disease is surprisingly limited. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to determine the phosphorylated tau interactome. To this end, we used 
two complementary proteomics approaches: (i) quantitative proteomics was 
performed on neurofibrillary tangles microdissected from patients with advanced 
Alzheimer's disease; and (ii) affinity purification-mass spectrometry was used 
to identify which of these proteins specifically bound to phosphorylated tau. We 
identified 542 proteins in neurofibrillary tangles. This included the abundant 
detection of many proteins known to be present in neurofibrillary tangles such 
as tau, ubiquitin, neurofilament proteins and apolipoprotein E. Affinity 
purification-mass spectrometry confirmed that 75 proteins present in 
neurofibrillary tangles interacted with PHF1-immunoreactive phosphorylated tau. 
Twenty-nine of these proteins have been previously associated with 
phosphorylated tau, therefore validating our proteomic approach. More 
importantly, 34 proteins had previously been associated with total tau, but not 
yet linked directly to phosphorylated tau (e.g. synaptic protein VAMP2, 
vacuolar-ATPase subunit ATP6V0D1); therefore, we provide new evidence that they 
directly interact with phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, 
we also identified 12 novel proteins, not previously known to be physiologically 
or pathologically associated with tau (e.g. RNA binding protein HNRNPA1). 
Network analysis showed that the phosphorylated tau interactome was enriched in 
proteins involved in the protein ubiquitination pathway and phagosome 
maturation. Importantly, we were able to pinpoint specific proteins that 
phosphorylated tau interacts with in these pathways for the first time, 
therefore providing novel potential pathogenic mechanisms that can be explored 
in future studies. Combined, our results reveal new potential drug targets for 
the treatment of tauopathies and provide insight into how phosphorylated tau 
mediates its toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
