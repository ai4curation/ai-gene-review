A single nucleotide polymorphism in the DAB2IP gene is associated with risk of 
aggressive prostate cancer (PCa), and loss of DAB2IP expression is frequently 
detected in metastatic PCa. However, the functional role of DAB2IP in PCa 
remains unknown. Here, we show that the loss of DAB2IP expression initiates 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is visualized by repression of 
E-cadherin and up-regulation of vimentin in both human normal prostate 
epithelial and prostate carcinoma cells as well as in clinical prostate-cancer 
specimens. Conversely, restoring DAB2IP in metastatic PCa cells reversed EMT. In 
DAB2IP knockout mice, prostate epithelial cells exhibited elevated mesenchymal 
markers, which is characteristic of EMT. Using a human prostate xenograft-mouse 
model, we observed that knocking down endogenous DAB2IP in human carcinoma cells 
led to the development of multiple lymph node and distant organ metastases. 
Moreover, we showed that DAB2IP functions as a scaffold protein in regulating 
EMT by modulating nuclear beta-catenin/T-cell factor activity. These results 
show the mechanism of DAB2IP in EMT and suggest that assessment of DAB2IP may

metastasis.

Abstract

A single nucleotide polymorphism in the DAB2IP gene is associated with risk of aggressive prostate cancer (PCa), and loss of DAB2IP expression is frequently detected in metastatic PCa. However, the functional role of DAB2IP in PCa remains unknown. Here, we show that the loss of DAB2IP expression initiates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is visualized by repression of E-cadherin and up-regulation of vimentin in both human normal prostate epithelial and prostate carcinoma cells as well as in clinical prostate-cancer specimens. Conversely, restoring DAB2IP in metastatic PCa cells reversed EMT. In DAB2IP knockout mice, prostate epithelial cells exhibited elevated mesenchymal markers, which is characteristic of EMT. Using a human prostate xenograft-mouse model, we observed that knocking down endogenous DAB2IP in human carcinoma cells led to the development of multiple lymph node and distant organ metastases. Moreover, we showed that DAB2IP functions as a scaffold protein in regulating EMT by modulating nuclear β-catenin/T-cell factor activity. These results show the mechanism of DAB2IP in EMT and suggest that assessment of DAB2IP may provide a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for PCa metastasis.

Discussion

In this study, we clearly show that DAB2IP functions as a scaffold protein in modulating GSK-3β-β-catenin signaling and EMT. In the presence of DAB2IP, interaction of its C2 domain with both PP2A and GSK-3β facilitates GSK-3β activation through S9 dephosphorylation. Then, it decreases nuclear β-catenin accumulation and its transcriptional activity, indicating the potent inhibitory function of DAB2IP in Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Within the DAB2IP-PP2A-GSK-3β complex, GSK-3β seems to be a direct substrate for PP2A, a known negative regulator in Wnt-β-catenin signaling ( 28 , 34 ), which is the underlying mechanism for the DAB2IP function. The role of S9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β in Wnt/β-catenin signaling is still controversial. For example, the S9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β is not correlated with Wnt-mediated GSK-3β activity in certain cell types ( 35 , 36 ). However, other studies have shown that many growth factors, such as insulin growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, and epidermal growth factor etc., can increase β-catenin accumulation through S9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β ( 37 – 40 ). Inactivation of GSK-3β through S9 phosphorylation is involved in hepatitis B virus-x protein (HBX)-mediated β-catenin stabilization in hepatocellular carcinoma cells ( 41 ). From several prostate-cell lines (e.g., C4-2 and PZ-HPV-7) tested, we showed that S9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β was clearly involved in DAB2IP-mediated β-catenin stability and transcriptional activity, suggesting that the effect of S9 phosphorylation on β-catenin signaling is cell-type dependent.

In general, β-catenin has a dual role in EMT: it not only enhances cell–cell adhesion by associating with cadherin complexes in adheren junctions of cell membrane, but it also functions as a transcriptional coactivator after interacting with TCF transcription factor complexes in the nucleus ( 21 , 42 ). The induction of EMT by nuclear β-catenin has been explored during development in cell lines and tumors ( 2 ). Several studies suggest that β-catenin–mediated transcription can induce Slug ( 43 ) or Twist1 ( 44 ) gene expression that further represses E-cadherin, thereby contributing to the EMT. Our data show that loss of DAB2IP in cells can lead to the accumulation of nuclear β-catenin ( Fig. 2 A and Fig. S5 C ), because DAB2IP facilitates cytoplasmic β-catenin degradation ( Fig. S3 A ). Thus, we believe that DAB2IP can modulate the dynamic switching between membrane- and nuclear-associated β-catenin through PP2A and GSK-3β ( Fig. 2 and Fig. S5 ), which determines EMT ( 4 ). In addition, we observed that ZEB1 and ZEB2/SIP1, transcriptional factors associated with EMT ( 3 , 4 ), were highly elevated in DAB2IP-depleted cells ( Fig. S2 D ). Taken together, these data indicate that DAB2IP is a key regulator in preventing EMT.

The majority of human visceral tumors derived from carcinomas exhibit an epithelial phenotype. To break away from neighboring cells and invade adjacent tissue layers or peripheral lymph nodes, carcinoma cells often lose cell–cell adhesion and acquire motility. In general, 25–30% of patients newly diagnosed with PCa will have local invasive cancer, and almost all of these patients will eventually develop metastatic disease, accounting for most cancer deaths ( 1 ). Needless to say, the detection of metastatic lesions at an early stage or during treatment should lead to an increase in disease-free survival rates. From the clinical outcome of PCa progression, the presence of lymph-node invasion has the lowest rate of 10-year progression-free survival rate ( 45 ). Our orthotopic PCa animal model ( Fig. 4 ) shows that mice bearing DAB2IP-knockdown cells have a dramatic increase in the incidence of lymph-node metastases as well as the number of metastatic sites where tissues clearly exhibit mesenchymal characteristics. Wnt signaling has been identified as a determinant of lung-cancer metastasis to brain and bone ( 46 ). Similarly, our data indicated that down-regulation of DAB2IP can increase the propensity of PCa cells to metastasize to lymph nodes ( Fig. 4 and Fig. S8 ), which was associated with the hyperactivation of Wnt/β-catenin/TCF pathway ( Fig. 2 E and Fig. S5 D ). Consistently, DAB2IP −/− mice exhibit similar changes of EMT markers in the prostate gland ( Fig. 5 ). In addition, prostate hyperplasia was observed in DAB2IP −/− mice after 6 months of age. A previous study has also shown the prostate hyperplasia in adenomatous polyposis coli knock-out (APC −/− ) mice after 4.5 weeks of age ( 47 ). In both models, the accumulation of nuclear β-catenin was observed; however, unlike PCa, which was detected in APC −/− mice after 7 months of age, no tumor has been detected in our model at this age. Because APC is known to regulate many pathways other than the Wnt/β-catenin pathway ( 48 ), it is possible that other downstream effects in addition to nuclear β-catenin activation may be involved in PCa formation in APC −/− mice. In DAB2IP −/− prostate, APC levels remained the same as in DAB2IP +/+ mice ( Fig. 5 B ) and thus, might also exert an inhibitory effect on tumor initiation.

In summary, this study delineates the functional role of DAB2IP in EMT, which also explains how loss of DAB2IP in PCa underlies the onset of aggressive metastatic PCa. We believe that the assessment of DAB2IP expression in PCa specimens can be a valuable prognostic biomarker for risk of PCa metastasis and the delineation of DAB2IP function could provide a potential intervention strategy for PCa metastasis.
