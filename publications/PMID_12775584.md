Rho-kinase, an effector of Rho GTPase, increases the contractility of vascular 
smooth muscle by phosphorylating myosin light chain (MLC) and by inactivating 
MLC phosphatase. A wide variety of extracellular stimuli activate RhoA via G 
protein-coupled receptors. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel 
cell-cell interaction-mediated Rho activation signaling pathway in vascular 
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Among many receptor tyrosine kinases, the Eph 
family receptors are unique in that they require cell-cell interaction to engage 
their ligands, ephrin. We found that a novel VSMC-specific guanine nucleotide 
exchange factor (GEF) for Rho (Vsm-RhoGEF/KIAA0915) was expressed specifically 
in VSMCs of several organs including the heart, aorta, liver, kidney, and 
spleen, as examined by the immunohistochemical analysis using a specific 
antibody against Vsm-RhoGEF. Based on the association of Vsm-RhoGEF with EphA4 
in quiescent cells, we tested whether EphA4 and Vsm-RhoGEF were expressed in the 
same tissue and further studied the molecular mechanism of Vsm-RhoGEF regulation 
by EphA4. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that EphA4 and Vsm-RhoGEF 
expression overlapped in VSMCs. Additionally, tyrosine phosphorylation of 
Vsm-RhoGEF induced by EphA4 upon ephrin-A1 stimulation enhanced the Vsm-RhoGEF 
activity for RhoA. The requirement of Vsm-RhoGEF for ephrin-A1-induced assembly 
of actin stress fibers in VSMCs was shown by the overexpression of a 
dominant-negative form of VSM-RhoGEF and by the depletion of Vsm-RhoGEF using 
RNA interference. These results suggested that ephrin-A1-triggered 
EphA4-Vsm-RhoGEF-RhoA pathway is involved in the cell-cell interaction-mediated 
RhoA activation that regulates vascular smooth muscle contractility.
