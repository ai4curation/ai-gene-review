Classic tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) deficiencies are characterized by 
hyperphenylalaninemia and deficiency of monoamine neurotransmitters. In this 
article, we report two patients with progressive psychomotor retardation, 
dystonia, severe dopamine and serotonin deficiencies (low levels of 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic and homovanillic acids), and abnormal pterin pattern (high 
levels of biopterin and dihydrobiopterin) in cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, 
they presented with normal urinary pterins and without hyperphenylalaninemia. 
Investigation of skin fibroblasts revealed inactive sepiapterin reductase (SR), 
the enzyme catalyzing the final two-step reaction in the biosynthesis of BH(4). 
Mutations in the SPR gene were detected in both patients and their family 
members. One patient was homozygous for a TC-->CT dinucleotide exchange, 
predicting a truncated SR (Q119X). The other patient was a compound heterozygote 
for a genomic 5-bp deletion (1397-1401delAGAAC) resulting in abolished SPR-gene 
expression and an A-->G transition leading to an R150G amino acid substitution 
and to inactive SR as confirmed by recombinant expression. The absence of 
hyperphenylalaninemia and the presence of normal urinary pterin metabolites and 
of normal SR-like activity in red blood cells may be explained by alternative 
pathways for the final two-step reaction of BH(4) biosynthesis in peripheral and 
neuronal tissues. We propose that, for the biosynthesis of BH(4) in peripheral 
tissues, SR activity may be substituted by aldose reductase (AR), carbonyl 
reductase (CR), and dihydrofolate reductase, whereas, in the brain, only AR and 
CR are fully present. Thus, autosomal recessive SR deficiency leads to BH(4) and 
to neurotransmitter deficiencies without hyperphenylalaninemia and may not be 
detected by neonatal screening for phenylketonuria.
