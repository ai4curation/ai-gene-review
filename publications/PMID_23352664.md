Intermittent fasting is one of the most effective dietary restriction regimens 
that extend life span in C. elegans and mammals. Fasting-stimulus responses are 
key to the longevity response; however, the mechanisms that sense and transduce 
the fasting stimulus remain largely unknown. Through a comprehensive 
transcriptome analysis in C. elegans, we find that along with the FOXO 
transcription factor DAF-16, AP-1 (JUN-1/FOS-1) plays a central role in 
fasting-induced transcriptional changes. KGB-1, one of the C. elegans JNKs, acts 
as an activator of AP-1 and is activated in response to fasting. KGB-1 and AP-1 
are involved in intermittent fasting-induced longevity. Fasting-induced 
upregulation of the components of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex via AP-1 
and DAF-16 enhances protein ubiquitination and reduces protein carbonylation. 
Our results thus identify a fasting-responsive KGB-1/AP-1 signaling pathway, 
which, together with DAF-16, causes transcriptional changes that mediate 
longevity, partly through regulating proteostasis.
