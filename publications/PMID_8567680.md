The purification of a 68-kDa hyaluronic acid-binding protein (HA-binding 
protein), a homodimer of 34 kDa that binds specifically to hyaluronic acid, has 
been reported earlier by us (Gupta, S., Batchu, R.B., and Datta, K. (1991) Eur. 
J. Cell Biol. 56, 58-67). Here, we report the isolation of a partial cDNA clone 
from a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library of human skin fibroblast by 
immuno-screening with HA-binding protein antiserum. The internal polypeptide 
sequence (83 residues) of the purified hyaluronic acid-binding protein is 
identical to the predicted protein sequence derived from hyaluronic acid-binding 
protein cDNA, suggesting the authenticity of the clone. Interestingly, this 
hyaluronic acid-binding protein cDNA sequence has complete homology with the 
cDNA sequence of a protein P-32, co-purified with the human pre-mRNA splicing 
factor SF2 (Krainer, A.R., Mayeda, A., Kozak, D., and Binns, G. (1991) Cell 66, 
383-394). Furthermore, the data on the N-terminal sequence of hyaluronic 
acid-binding protein and the predicted polypeptide of P-32 revealed the 
identical coding sequence of 209 amino acids for both the proteins. As the 
identity and functional characterization of P-32 have not yet been reported, 
P-32 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant P-32 protein 
was purified by hyaluronic acid-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The 
recombinant P-32 protein showed immunocross-reactivity with the polyclonal 
antibodies raised against HA-binding protein. The predicted amino acid sequence 
of the protein fulfilled the minimal criteria for binding to hyaluronic acid, 
i.e. two basic amino acids flanking a seven-amino acid stretch, as reported for 
other hyaluronic acid affinity of the recombinant P-32 protein was confirmed by 
biotinylated hyaluronic acid binding assay. The binding of recombinant P-32 
protein to biotinylated hyaluronic acid binding assay. The binding of 
recombinant P-32 protein to biotinylated hyaluronic acid can be competed only 
with excess unlabeled hyaluronic acid, confirming its specificity toward 
hyaluronic acid. All these results suggest that both P-32, co-purified with the 
human pre-mRNA splicing factor SF2, and 34-kDa hyaluronic acid-binding protein 
reported by us are the same protein and that it is a new member of the 
hyaluronic acid-binding protein family, the "hyaladherins."
