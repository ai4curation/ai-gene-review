The neural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Ascl1 (previously Mash1) 
is present in ventricular zone cells in restricted domains throughout the 
developing nervous system. This study uses genetic fate mapping to define the 
stage and neural lineages in the developing spinal cord that are derived from 
Ascl1-expressing cells. We find that Ascl1 is present in progenitors to both 
neurons and oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes. Temporal control of the 
fate-mapping paradigm reveals rapid cell-cycle exit and differentiation of 
Ascl1-expressing cells. At embryonic day 11, Ascl1 identifies 
neuronal-restricted precursor cells that become dorsal horn neurons in the 
superficial laminae. By contrast, at embryonic day 16, Ascl1 identifies 
oligodendrocyte-restricted precursor cells that distribute throughout the spinal 
cord. These data demonstrate that sequentially generated Ascl1-expressing 
progenitors give rise first to dorsal horn interneurons and subsequently to 
late-born oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, Ascl1-null cells in the spinal cord 
have a diminished capacity to undergo neuronal differentiation, with a subset of 
these cells retaining characteristics of immature glial cells.
