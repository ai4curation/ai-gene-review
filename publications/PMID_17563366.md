Elimination of misfolded membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
affects cell survival and growth and can be triggered by either local 
physiologic events or disease-associated mutations. Regulation of signaling 
receptor degradation involves both cytosolic and ER luminal molecular 
chaperones, but the mechanisms and timing of this process remain uncertain. Here 
we report that calreticulin (CRT) and Hsp90 exert distinct effects on the 
stability and cell surface levels of native and misfolded forms of the human 
insulin receptor (hIR) and a human variant found in type A insulin resistance. 
CRT was unique in stabilizing the disease variant and in augmenting hIR 
expression when glycolysis was abrogated. Effects of Hsp90 were independent of 
receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and did not change levels of downstream 
signaling kinases. Live cell imaging revealed that movement of the hIR through 
the ER was accelerated by misfolding or by overexpression of either CRT or 
Hsp90. Together, our results indicate that both CRT and Hsp90 control expression 
of hIR at its earliest maturation stages and modulate its movement within the ER 
before either degradation or cell surface expression.

Abstract

Elimination of misfolded membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) affects cell survival and growth and can be triggered by either local physiologic events or disease-associated mutations. Regulation of signaling receptor degradation involves both cytosolic and ER luminal molecular chaperones, but the mechanisms and timing of this process remain uncertain. Here we report that calreticulin (CRT) and Hsp90 exert distinct effects on the stability and cell surface levels of native and misfolded forms of the human insulin receptor (hIR) and a human variant found in type A insulin resistance. CRT was unique in stabilizing the disease variant and in augmenting hIR expression when glycolysis was abrogated. Effects of Hsp90 were independent of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and did not change levels of downstream signaling kinases. Live cell imaging revealed that movement of the hIR through the ER was accelerated by misfolding or by overexpression of either CRT or Hsp90. Together, our results indicate that both CRT and Hsp90 control expression of hIR at its earliest maturation stages and modulate its movement within the ER before either degradation or cell surface expression.

Discussion

Although cytosolic and luminal molecular chaperones have been implicated in ER QC, the present study provides several previously unrecognized findings that support a function for CRT and Hsp90 in the dynamics of QC during biogenesis of a transmembrane signaling receptor kinase in living cells. First, we demonstrate that CRT, a major ER luminal chaperone, augments cell surface expression of native wild-type proteins under basal metabolic conditions and attenuates degradation of a human mutant variant.

Second, our experiments clarify the mechanisms whereby Hsp90 influences cell surface expression of one subtype of RTKs. Although previous studies with EGFR and GA indicated a role for receptor autophosphorylation in Hsp90-mediated degradation ( 16 ), our analysis revealed that kinase-dead hIR remained susceptible to degradation ( Fig. 3 E ). A related observation concerns the stage in hIR biogenesis during which cytosolic Hsp90 affects expression. Specifically, our results showed that Hsp90 promoted the conversion of immature hIR to mature proteolytically processed native protein ( Fig. 3 A and F ), indicating that Hsp90 affects not only the cell surface population of hIR but it may also facilitate movement of the immature receptor to post-ER compartments and promote the progression of the receptor through earlier stages of maturation. Indeed, previous studies with CFTR have shown that Hsp90 participates in the ER degradation of the Δ F508 CFTR mutant variant ( 21 , 22 ), indicating an important and broad role for cytosolic Hsp90 in basal membrane protein biogenesis and QC.

A third aspect of our studies addressed temporal dynamics of hIR movement within the ER. Calculations from our fluorescence recovery studies showed a diffusion coefficient of ≈2.3–3.4 × 10 −10 cm 2 /s for the hIR-GFP chimeras. Although previous studies have established similar diffusion coefficients for various forms of aquaporin2 (AQP2), a multispanning transmembrane protein ( 23 ), our results provide previously unrecognized evidence to show comparable diffusion rates for proteins with single-pass topology. Interestingly, we found that hIR mut had increased movement compared with wild-type hIR-GFP. In contrast, previous experiments with AQP2 and CFTR showed that missense mutant variants had mobilities equivalent to native proteins within the ER ( 23 , 24 ). More recently, mutant Gas3/PMP22, a misfolded tetraspan component of myelin protein, was found to be less mobile than its wild-type counterpart ( 25 ), an effect attributed to differences in the Stokes' radius of the mutant protein oligomers. Additional studies support a relationship between diffusional mobility and the physical size of the transmembrane domain ( 18 , 26 ). Given these observations, it is noteworthy that our previous biochemical studies have shown that hIR mut does not dimerize in the ER ( 15 ). We speculate that a reduced membrane-spanning radius and/or failure to engage in the proper maturation steps enhances the movement of the mutant monomer through the ER.

Fourth, our data further indicate a role for both CRT and Hsp90 in the temporal dynamics of hIR movement. CRT significantly increased the diffusion coefficient of the wild-type hIR-GFP, resulting in a rate of mobility similar to that of the misfolded hIR mut -GFP ( Table 1 ). Recent analyses have shown that CRT itself is highly mobile within the ER ( 27 ) and may contribute to movement of its client proteins. Moreover, overexpression of BiP has been shown to increase the solubility of pα F and decrease its degradation ( 28 ). Thus, ER chaperones appear to generally promote protein mobility even after misfolding. However, it should be noted that effects of each chaperone may depend on the specific substrate because BiP overexpression was also shown to immobilize misfolded vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein ( 29 ).

Cytosolic chaperones have been shown to play a role in ER substrate mobility and our FRAP experiments showed that Hsp90 was also able to significantly increase mobility of the wild-type receptor ( Table 1 ). Our genetic transfection experiments extend previous observations that inhibiting Hsp90 decreased CFTR mobility ( 24 ) and that Hsp90 maintains solubility of an aggregation-prone domain of CFTR ( 30 ). Overall, we propose that Hsp90 also plays a facilitative role in transmembrane protein movement within the ER.

Together, our studies reveal that CRT and Hsp90, chaperones found on opposite sides of the ER membrane, exert distinct roles on the stability and mobility of the hIR and ultimately its cell surface expression. Our observations raise the intriguing possibility that regulation of movement of transmembrane proteins within the ER may be substrate-specific and result from distinct interactions with ER luminal and cytosolic chaperones. Future studies elucidating the spatiotemporal steps in RTK biogenesis may improve our understanding of disease conditions, including diabetes and obesity, both of which are associated with dysregulation of IR homeostasis.
