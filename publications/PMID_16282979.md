We have recently demonstrated that ablation of one or both alleles of the 
proapoptotic gene Bim prevents the polycystic kidney disease (PKD) that develops 
in mice deficient for the prosurvival protein Bcl-2. The aim of the present 
study was to investigate whether loss of Bim or Bcl-2 could influence the 
disease in the PKD1del34/del34 mutant mice, a model of autosomal dominant PKD. 
PKD1del34/del34 mice were intercrossed with Bim-deficient mice and Bcl-2+/- mice 
to generate double mutants. Loss of Bim does not prevent the development of PKD 
in PKD1del34/del34 mice. On the C57BL/6 genetic background, most older 
PKD1del34/+ mice do not develop PKD, but present with liver cysts. Surprisingly, 
loss of Bim completely prevented liver cysts formation in PKD1del34/+ mice. Loss 
of one Bcl-2 allele did not influence the PKD1del34 phenotype significantly. We 
conclude that loss of PKD1 and loss of Bcl-2 elicit PKD through distinct 
mechanisms.
