The autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) protein plays a critical role 
in regulating plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. Inherited defects in 
ARH lead to a hypercholesterolemia that closely phenocopies that caused by a 
defective LDL receptor. The elevated serum LDL-cholesterol levels typical of ARH 
patients and the pronounced accumulation of the LDL receptor at the cell surface 
of hepatocytes in ARH-null mice argue that ARH operates by promoting the 
internalization of the LDL receptor within clathrin-coated vesicles. ARH 
contains an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain that associates 
physically with the LDL receptor internalization sequence and with 
phosphoinositides. The carboxyl-terminal half of ARH contains a clathrin-binding 
sequence and a separate AP-2 adaptor binding region providing a plausible 
mechanism for how ARH can act as an endocytic adaptor or CLASP 
(clathrin-associated sorting protein) to couple LDL receptors with the clathrin 
machinery. Because the interaction with AP-2 is highly selective for the 
independently folded appendage domain of the beta2 subunit, we have 
characterized the ARH beta2 appendage-binding sequence in detail. Unlike the 
known alpha appendage-binding motifs, ARH requires an extensive sequence tract 
to bind the beta appendage with comparably high affinity. A minimal 16-residue 
sequence functions autonomously and depends upon ARH residues Asp253, Phe259, 
Leu262, and Arg266. We suggested that biased beta subunit engagement by ARH and 
the only other beta2 appendage selective adaptor, beta-arrestin, promotes 
efficient incorporation of this mechanistically distinct subset of CLASPs into 
clathrin-coated buds.
