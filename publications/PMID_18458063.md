Acetylation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae histone H3 on K56 by the histone 
acetyltransferase (HAT) Rtt109 is important for repairing replication-associated 
lesions. Rtt109 purifies from yeast in complex with the histone chaperone Vps75, 
which stabilizes the HAT in vivo. A whole-genome screen to identify genes whose 
deletions have synthetic genetic interactions with rtt109Delta suggests Rtt109 
has functions in addition to DNA repair. We show that in addition to its known 
H3-K56 acetylation activity, Rtt109 is also an H3-K9 HAT, and we show that 
Rtt109 and Gcn5 are the only H3-K9 HATs in vivo. Rtt109's H3-K9 acetylation 
activity in vitro is enhanced strongly by Vps75. Another histone chaperone, 
Asf1, and Vps75 are both required for acetylation of lysine 9 on H3 (H3-K9ac) in 
vivo by Rtt109, whereas H3-K56ac in vivo requires only Asf1. Asf1 also 
physically interacts with the nuclear Hat1/Hat2/Hif1 complex that acetylates 
H4-K5 and H4-K12. We suggest Asf1 is capable of assembling into chromatin H3-H4 
dimers diacetylated on both H4-K5/12 and H3-K9/56.
