Acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (MGAT2) catalyzes the synthesis of 
diacylglycerol and differs from the MGAT1 and MGAT3 in tissue distribution at 
the mRNA level. In addition to the small intestine, MGAT2 mRNA is also expressed 
at high levels in human liver, the lower gastrointestinal tract, and the mouse 
kidney, but the physiological significance of such expression has not yet been 
studied. Using an affinity-purified antibody, the present study investigated the 
expression of murine MGAT2 protein along the intestinal tract, determined its 
subcellular localization, and studied its regulation by diet and in db/db mouse. 
Results demonstrate a high level of MGAT2 expression in the small intestine in a 
proximal-to-distal gradient that correlated well with both MGAT enzyme activity 
and fat absorption pattern. In contrast, MGAT2 protein was not detectable in 
other sections of the digestive tract, including stomach, cecum, colon, and 
rectum, or other mouse tissues such as kidney, liver, and adipocytes. 
Immunohistological studies provided direct evidence that the enzyme is expressed 
not only in the villi, but also in the crypt regions of the small intestine, 
which suggests that MGAT2 expression occurs prior to the maturation of 
enterocytes. MGAT2 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in both 
MGAT2-transfected COS-7 and Caco-2 cells, indicating that the ER is the primary 
site for dietary fat re-synthesis. MGAT2 expression appeared not to be affected 
by diabetes in the db/db mouse, however, the total intestinal MGAT activity was 
significantly enhanced. Finally, an up-regulation of both MGAT2 protein 
expression and MGAT activity was observed in mice fed a high fat diet, 
implicating a role of MGAT2 in diet-induced obesity. Taken together, our data 
suggest a predominant role of MGAT2 in dietary fat absorption.
