Thrombocytes express thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), as well as the CREC proteins, 
calumenin and reticulocalbin. TSP1 and calumenin are released upon stimulation 
with thrombin. Calumenin has recently been shown to influence the synthesis of 
certain coagulation factors. Calumenin is present in atherosclerotic lesions but 
not in normal vasculature [Coppinger et al. (Blood 103:2096-2104, 2004)] and is 
able to modulate the protein expression pattern as well as the cell cycle of 
fibroblasts [Østergaard et al. (Proteomics 6:3509-3519, 2006)]. We here show 
that calumenin in the presence of Ca(2+) binds to TSP1 with a dissociation 
constant K (d) around 0.4 muM. This interaction is specific with respect to the 
secreted calumenin as the closest relative among the CREC family members, the 
non-secreted reticulocalbin, does not form a similar complex. This further 
indicates that calumenin may be broadly involved in haemostasis and in the 
pathophysiology of thrombosis.
