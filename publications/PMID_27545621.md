RNA-binding protein TDP-43 mediates essential RNA processing but forms 
cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions via its C-terminal domain (CTD) in amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS). It remains unclear if aggregated TDP-43 is neurotoxic 
and if ∼50 ALS-associated missense mutations in TDP-43 CTD promote aggregation, 
or if loss of normal function plays a role in disease. Recent work points to the 
ability of related proteins to assemble into functional phase-separated 
ribonucleoprotein granules via their structurally disordered prion-like domains. 
Here, we provide atomic details on the structure and assembly of the 
low-complexity CTD of TDP-43 into liquid-liquid phase-separated in vitro 
granules and demonstrate that ALS-associated variants disrupt interactions 
within granules. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, simulation, and 
microscopy, we find that a subregion cooperatively but transiently folds into a 
helix that mediates TDP-43 phase separation. ALS-associated mutations disrupt 
phase separation by inhibiting interaction and helical stabilization. Therefore, 
ALS-associated mutations can disrupt TDP-43 interactions, affecting function 
beyond encouraging aggregation.
