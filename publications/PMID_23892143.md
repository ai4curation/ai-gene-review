Characterization of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV) protein 
interactions with host cell components is crucial to devise antiviral 
strategies. Viral nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein and matrix protein genes were 
optimized for human codon usage and cloned into expression vectors. HEK-293T 
cells were transfected with these vectors, viral proteins were 
immunoprecipitated, and co-immunoprecipitated cellular proteins were identified 
through mass spectrometry. Cell proteins identified with higher confidence 
scores were probed in the immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. The 
results indicate that nucleoprotein interacts with arginine methyl-transferase, 
methylosome protein and Hsp70. Phosphoprotein interacts with Hsp70 and 
tropomysin, and matrix with tropomysin and nucleophosmin. Additionally, we 
performed immunoprecipitation of these cellular proteins in cells infected with 
HRSV, followed by detection of co-immunoprecipitated viral proteins. The results 
indicate that these interactions also occur in the context of viral infection, 
and their potential contribution for a HRSV replication model is discussed.
