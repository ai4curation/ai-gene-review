Exposure to vectors of infectious diseases has been associated with antibody 
responses against salivary antigens of arthropods among people living in endemic 
areas. This immune response has been proposed as a surrogate marker of exposure 
to vectors appropriate for evaluating the protective efficacy of antivectorial 
devices. The existence and potential use of such antibody responses in 
travellers transiently exposed to Plasmodium or arbovirus vectors in tropical 
areas has never been investigated. The IgM and IgG antibody responses of 88 
French soldiers against the saliva of Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti were 
evaluated before and after a 5-month journey in tropical Africa. Antibody 
responses against Anopheles and Aedes saliva increased significantly in 41% and 
15% of the individuals, respectively, and appeared to be specific to the 
mosquito genus. A proteomic and immunoproteomic analysis of anopheles and Aedes 
saliva allowed for the identification of some antigens that were recognized by 
most of the exposed individuals. These results suggest that antibody responses 
to the saliva of mosquitoes could be considered as specific surrogate markers of 
exposure of travellers to mosquito vectors that transmit arthropod borne 
infections.
