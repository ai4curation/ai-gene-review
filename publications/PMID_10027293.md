Cerebellar granule cells are the most abundant type of neuron in the brain, but 
the molecular mechanisms that control their generation are incompletely 
understood. We show that Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is made by Purkinje cells, 
regulates the division of granule cell precursors (GCPs). Treatment of GCPs with 
Shh prevents differentiation and induces a potent, long-lasting proliferative 
response. This response can be inhibited by basic fibroblast growth factor or by 
activation of protein kinase A. Blocking Shh function in vivo dramatically 
reduces GCP proliferation. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms of 
normal growth and tumorigenesis in the cerebellum.
