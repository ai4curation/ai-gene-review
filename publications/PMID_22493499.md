Phagocytosis is a pivotal process by which macrophages eliminate microorganisms 
upon recognition by pathogen sensors. Surprisingly, the self-ligand cell surface 
receptor Slamf1 functions not only as a co-stimulatory molecule but also as a 
microbial sensor of several Gram-negative bacteria. Upon entering the phagosome 
of macrophages Slamf1 induces production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, 
which positively regulates the activity of the NOX2 enzyme and phagolysosomal 
maturation. Here, we report that in Escherichia coli-containing phagosomes of 
mouse macrophages, Slamf1 interacts with the class III PI3K Vps34 in a complex 
with Beclin-1 and UVRAG. Upon phagocytosis of bacteria the NOX2 activity was 
reduced in macrophages isolated from Beclin-1(+/-) mice compared with wild-type 
mice. This Slamf1/Beclin-1/Vps34/UVRAG protein complex is formed in 
intracellular membrane compartments as it is found without inducing phagocytosis 
in macrophages, human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, and transfectant 
HEK293 cells. Elimination of its cytoplasmic tail abolished the interaction of 
Slamf1 with the complex, but deletion or mutation of the two ITAM motifs did 
not. Both the BD and CCD domains of Beclin-1 were required for efficient binding 
to Slamf1. Because Slamf1 did not interact with Atg14L or Rubicon, which can 
also form a complex with Vps34 and Beclin-1, we conclude that Slamf1 recruits a 
subset of Vps34-associated proteins, which is involved in membrane fusion and 
NOX2 regulation.
