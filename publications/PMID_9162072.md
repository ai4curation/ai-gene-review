C173 and W125 are pet mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, partially deficient 
in cytochrome oxidase but with elevated concentrations of cytochrome c. Assays 
of electron transport chain enzymes indicate that the mutations exert different 
effects on the terminal respiratory pathway, including an inefficient transfer 
of electrons between the bc1 and the cytochrome oxidase complexes. A cloned gene 
capable of restoring respiration in C173/U1 and W125 is identical to reading 
frame YGR112w of yeast chromosome VII (GenBank Z72897Z72897). The encoded 
protein is homologous to the product of the mammalian SURF-1 gene. In view of 
the homology, the yeast gene has been designated SHY1 (Surf Homolog of Yeast). 
An antibody against the carboxyl-terminal half of Shy1p has been used to 
localize the protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Deletion of part of 
SHY1 produces a phenotype similar to that of G91 mutants. Disruption of SHY1 at 
a BamHI site, located approximately 2/3 of the way into the gene, has no obvious 
phenotypic consequence. This evidence, together with the ability of a 
carboxyl-terminal coding sequence starting from the BamHI site to complement a 
shy1 mutant, suggests that the Shy1p contains two domains that can be separately 
expressed to form a functional protein.
