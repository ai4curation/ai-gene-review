Tumor protein D52-like proteins (TPD52) are small coiled-coil motif bearing 
proteins that were first identified in breast cancer. TPD52 and related proteins 
have been implicated in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and vesicle trafficking. 
To date, three human TPD52 members had been identified, named hD52 (TPD52), hD53 
(TPD52L1), and hD54 (TPD52L2). The most important characteristic of the protein 
family is a highly conserved coiled-coil motif that is required for homo- and 
heteromeric interaction with other TPD52-like proteins. Herein, we identified a 
novel TPD52-like sequence (TPD52L3, or hD55) in human testis using cDNA 
microarray. Sequence analysis of the deduced protein suggests that hD55 contains 
a coiled-coil motif and is highly conserved compared with other TPD52-like 
sequences. Yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays revealed that hD55 
interacts with hD52, hD53, hD54, and itself. cDNA microarray detection found 
that hD55 was expressed at 5.6-fold higher levels in adult testis than in fetal 
testis. Additionally, the expression profile shows that hD55 is testis-specific, 
indicating a potential role for hD55 in testis development and spermatogenesis.
