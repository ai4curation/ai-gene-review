DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by two distinct pathways, 
homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ 
includes two pathways, that is, precise and imprecise end joining. We found that 
Lif1, a component of the DNA ligase IV complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was 
phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) at Ser261 during the S to G2 
phase but not during G1 phase. This phosphorylation was required for efficient 
NHEJ in G2/M cells, rather than in G1 cells. It also promotes the stable binding 
of Lif1 protein to DSBs, specifically in G2/M-arrested cells, which shows the 
resection of DSB ends. Thus, Lif1 phosphorylation plays a critical role in a 
certain type of imprecise NHEJ accompanied by DSB end resection and 
micro-homology. Lif1 phosphorylation at Ser261 is probably involved in 
micro-homology-dependent end joining associated with producing single-stranded 
DSB ends that are formed by Sae2 as early intermediates in the HR pathway. 
CDK-dependent modification of the NHEJ pathway might make DSB ends compatible 
for NHEJ and thus prevent competition between HR and NHEJ in hierarchy on the 
choice of DSB repair pathways.
