DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by two distinct pathways, 
homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ 
includes two pathways, that is, precise and imprecise end joining. We found that 
Lif1, a component of the DNA ligase IV complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was 
phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) at Ser261 during the S to G2 
phase but not during G1 phase. This phosphorylation was required for efficient 
NHEJ in G2/M cells, rather than in G1 cells. It also promotes the stable binding 
of Lif1 protein to DSBs, specifically in G2/M-arrested cells, which shows the 
resection of DSB ends. Thus, Lif1 phosphorylation plays a critical role in a 
certain type of imprecise NHEJ accompanied by DSB end resection and 
micro-homology. Lif1 phosphorylation at Ser261 is probably involved in 
micro-homology-dependent end joining associated with producing single-stranded 
DSB ends that are formed by Sae2 as early intermediates in the HR pathway. 
CDK-dependent modification of the NHEJ pathway might make DSB ends compatible 
for NHEJ and thus prevent competition between HR and NHEJ in hierarchy on the 
choice of DSB repair pathways.

Heavy ion beam (HIB) irradiation is widely utilized in studies of cosmic rays-induced cellular effects and microbial breeding. Establishing an accurate dose-survival relationship is crucial for selecting the optimal irradiation dose. Typically, after irradiating logarithmic-phase cell suspensions with HIB, the survival fraction (SF) is determined by the ratio of clonal-forming units in irradiated versus control groups. However, our findings indicated that SF measurements were time sensitive. For the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model, the observed SF initially declined and subsequently increased in a eutrophic state; conversely, in an oligotrophic state, it remained relatively stable within 120 minutes. This time effect of SF observations in the eutrophic state can be ascribed to HIB-exposed cells experiencing cell cycle arrest, whereas the control proliferated rapidly, resulting in an over-time disproportionate change in viable cell count. Therefore, an alternative involves irradiating oligotrophic cells, determining SF thereafter, and transferring cells to the eutrophic state to facilitate DNA repair-mutation. Transcriptomic comparisons under these two trophic states yield valuable insights into the DNA damage response. Although DNA repair was postponed in an oligotrophic state, cells proactively mobilized specific repair pathways to advance this process. Effective nutritional supplementation should occur within 120 minutes, beyond this window, a decline in SF indicates an irreversible loss of repair capability. Upon transition to the eutrophic state, S. cerevisiae swiftly adapted and completed the repair. This study helps to minimize time-dependent variability in SF observations and to ensure effective damage repair and mutation in microbial breeding using HIB or other mutagens. It also promotes the understanding of microbial responses to complex environments.

IMPORTANCEMutation breeding is a vital means of developing excellent microbial resources. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms through which microorganisms respond to complex environments characterized by mutagens and specific physiological-biochemical states holds significant theoretical and practical values. This study utilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a microbial model and highly efficient heavy ion beam (HIB) radiation as a mutagen, it revealed the time dependence of observations of survival fractions (SF) in response to HIB radiation and proposed an alternative to avoid the indeterminacy that this variable brings. Meanwhile, by incorporating an oligotrophic state into the alternative, this study constructed a dynamic map of gene expression during the fast-repair and slow-repair stages. It also highlighted the influence of trophic states on DNA repair. The findings apply to the survival-damage repair-mutation effects of single-celled microorganisms in response to various mutagens and contribute to elucidating the biological mechanisms underlying microbial survival in complex environments.
