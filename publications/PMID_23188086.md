Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) play a central role in protein homeostasis 
under conditions of stress by binding partly unfolded, aggregate-prone proteins 
and keeping them soluble. Like many sHSPs, the widely expressed human sHSP, 
αB-crystallin ('αB'), forms large polydisperse multimeric assemblies. Molecular 
interactions involved in both sHSP function and oligomer formation remain to be 
delineated. A growing database of structural information reveals that a central 
conserved α-crystallin domain (ACD) forms dimeric building blocks, while 
flanking N- and C-termini direct the formation of larger sHSP oligomers. The 
most commonly observed inter-subunit interaction involves a highly conserved 
C-terminal 'IxI/V' motif and a groove in the ACD that is also implicated in 
client binding. To investigate the inherent properties of this interaction, 
peptides mimicking the IxI/V motif of αB and other human sHSPs were tested for 
binding to dimeric αB-ACD. IxI-mimicking peptides bind the isolated ACD at 22°C 
in a manner similar to interactions observed in the oligomer at low temperature, 
confirming these interactions are likely to exist in functional αB oligomers.
