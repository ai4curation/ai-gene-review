Excessive zinc influx may contribute to neuronal death after certain insults, 
including transient global ischemia. In light of evidence that levels of 
intracellular free Zn(2+) associated with neurotoxicity may be sufficient to 
inhibit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), experiments were 
performed looking for reduced glycolysis and energy failure in cultured mouse 
cortical neurons subjected to lethal Zn(2+) exposure. As predicted, cultures 
exposed for 3-22 hr to 40 mixroM Zn(2+) developed an early increase in levels of 
dihydroxy-acetone phosphate (DHAP) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and a 
progressive loss of ATP levels, followed by neuronal cell death; furthermore, 
addition of the downstream glycolytic substrate pyruvate to the bathing medium 
attenuated the fall in ATP and neuronal death. However, an alternative to direct 
Zn(2+) inhibition of GAPDH was raised by the observation that Zn(2+) exposure 
also induced an early decrease in nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) 
levels, an event itself capable of inhibiting GAPDH. Favoring this indirect 
mechanism of GAPDH inhibition, the neuroprotective effects of pyruvate addition 
were associated with normalization of cellular levels of NAD(+), DHAP, and FBP. 
Zn(2+)-induced neuronal death was also attenuated by addition of the energy 
substrate oxaloacetate, the activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase, 
dichloroacetate, or the inhibitors of NAD(+) catabolism, niacinamide or 
benzamide. Acetyl carnitine, alpha-keto butyrate, lactate, and 
beta-hydroxy-butyrate did not attenuate Zn(2+)-induced neurotoxicity, perhaps 
because they could not regenerate NAD(+) or be used for energy production in the 
presence of glucose.
