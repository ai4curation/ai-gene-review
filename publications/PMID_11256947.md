Characterization of the interaction between the transcription factors human 
polyamine modulated factor (PMF-1) and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) in the 
transcriptional regulation of the spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 
(SSAT) gene.

Polyamines and polyamine analogues have been demonstrated to modulate the 
transcription of various genes. Spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase 
(SSAT) is transcriptionally regulated through the interaction of at least two 
trans-acting transcription factors, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and PMF-1 
(polyamine modulated factor-1). Nrf-2 has previously been shown to regulate 
transcription of other genes through interactions between its C-terminal leucine 
zipper and the leucine-zipper region of other members of the small Maf protein 
family (the term "Maf" is derived from MusculoAponeurotic-Fibrosarcoma virus). 
Here it is demonstrated that the interaction between Nrf-2 and PMF-1 is mediated 
through the binding of the leucine-zipper region of Nrf-2 and a C-terminal 
coiled-coil region of PMF-1 that does not contain a leucine zipper. Mutations 
that interrupt either the leucine zipper of Nrf-2 or the coiled-coil region of 
PMF-1 are demonstrated to alter the ability of these factors to interact, thus 
their ability to regulate the transcription of the SSAT gene is lost.
