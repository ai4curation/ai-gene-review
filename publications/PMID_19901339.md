Intracellular amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been implicated in neuronal death 
associated with Alzheimer's disease. Although Abeta is predominantly secreted 
into the extracellular space, mechanisms of Abeta transport at the level of the 
neuronal cell membrane remain to be fully elucidated. We demonstrate that 
receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) contributes to transport of 
Abeta from the cell surface to the intracellular space. Mouse cortical neurons 
exposed to extracellular human Abeta subsequently showed detectable peptide 
intracellularly in the cytosol and mitochondria by confocal microscope and 
immunogold electron microscopy. Pretreatment of cultured neurons from wild-type 
mice with neutralizing antibody to RAGE, and neurons from RAGE knockout mice 
displayed decreased uptake of Abeta and protection from Abeta-mediated 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Abeta activated p38 MAPK, but not SAPK/JNK, and then 
stimulated intracellular uptake of Abeta-RAGE complex. Similar intraneuronal 
co-localization of Abeta and RAGE was observed in the hippocampus of transgenic 
mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein. These findings indicate 
that RAGE contributes to mechanisms involved in the translocation of Abeta from 
the extracellular to the intracellular space, thereby enhancing Abeta 
cytotoxicity.
