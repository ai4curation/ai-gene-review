Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to 
the steroid hormone receptor family and is very important for the development 
and progression of prostate cancer. The soy isoflavone genistein has been shown 
previously to down-regulate AR in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines 
such as LNCaP. However, the mechanism(s) by which AR is down-regulated by 
genistein is still not known fully. We show a new mechanism by which genistein 
inhibits AR protein levels. We show that genistein-treated LNCaP cells exhibit 
increased ubiquitination of AR, suggesting that AR protein is down-regulated via 
a proteasome-mediated pathway. AR is normally stabilized by the chaperone 
activity of the heat shock protein Hsp90. The increased ubiquitination of AR 
after genistein treatment is attributed to decreased Hsp90 chaperone activity as 
assessed by its increased functionally inactive acetylated form. Consistent with 
this result, we find that HDAC6, which is a Hsp90 deacetylase, is inhibited by 
the antiestrogenic activity of genistein. Hence, in this study, we elucidate a 
novel mechanism of AR down-regulation by genistein through inhibition of 
HDAC6-Hsp90 cochaperone function required to stabilize AR protein. Our results 
suggest that genistein could be used as a potential chemopreventive agent for 
prostate cancers along with known inhibitors of HDAC6 and Hsp90.
