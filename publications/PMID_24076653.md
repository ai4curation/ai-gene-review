Filopodia explore the environment, sensing soluble and mechanical cues during 
directional motility and tissue morphogenesis. How filopodia are initiated and 
spatially restricted to specific sites on the plasma membrane is still unclear. 
Here, we show that the membrane deforming and curvature sensing IRSp53 (Insulin 
Receptor Substrate of 53 kDa) protein slows down actin filament barbed end 
growth. This inhibition is relieved by CDC42 and counteracted by VASP, which 
also binds to IRSp53. The VASP:IRSp53 interaction is regulated by activated 
CDC42 and promotes high-density clustering of VASP, which is required for 
processive actin filament elongation. The interaction also mediates VASP 
recruitment to liposomes. In cells, IRSp53 and VASP accumulate at discrete foci 
at the leading edge, where filopodia are initiated. Genetic removal of IRSp53 
impairs the formation of VASP foci, filopodia and chemotactic motility, while 
IRSp53 null mice display defective wound healing. Thus, IRSp53 dampens barbed 
end growth. CDC42 activation inhibits this activity and promotes 
IRSp53-dependent recruitment and clustering of VASP to drive actin assembly. 
These events result in spatial restriction of VASP filament elongation for 
initiation of filopodia during cell migration, invasion, and tissue repair.
