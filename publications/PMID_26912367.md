The U4/U6.U5 triple small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri-snRNP) is a major 
spliceosome building block. We obtained a three-dimensional structure of the 
1.8-megadalton human tri-snRNP at a resolution of 7 angstroms using 
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We fit all known 
high-resolution structures of tri-snRNP components into the EM density map and 
validated them by protein cross-linking. Our model reveals how the spatial 
organization of Brr2 RNA helicase prevents premature U4/U6 RNA unwinding in 
isolated human tri-snRNPs and how the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-like 
protein Sad1 likely tethers the helicase Brr2 to its preactivation position. 
Comparison of our model with cryo-EM three-dimensional structures of the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae tri-snRNP and Schizosaccharomyces pombe spliceosome 
indicates that Brr2 undergoes a marked conformational change during spliceosome 
activation, and that the scaffolding protein Prp8 is also rearranged to 
accommodate the spliceosome's catalytic RNA network.
