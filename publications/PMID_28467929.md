BMP2 and TGFβ1 are functional antagonists of pathological remodeling in the 
arteries, heart, and lung; however, the mechanisms in VSMCs, and 
their disturbance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), are unclear. We 
found a pro-proliferative TGFβ1-Stat3-FoxO1 axis in VSMCs, and PPARγ 
as inhibitory regulator of TGFβ1-Stat3-FoxO1 and TGFβ1-Smad3/4, by physically 
interacting with Stat3 and Smad3. TGFβ1 induces fibrosis-related genes and 
miR-130a/301b, suppressing PPARγ. Conversely, PPARγ inhibits TGFβ1-induced 
mitochondrial activation and VSMC proliferation, and regulates two glucose 
metabolism-related enzymes, platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFKP, a 
PPARγ target, via miR-331-5p) and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3G 
(PPP1R3G, a Smad3 target). PPARγ knockdown/deletion in VSMCs activates TGFβ1 
signaling. The PPARγ agonist pioglitazone reverses PAH and inhibits the 
TGFβ1-Stat3-FoxO1 axis in TGFβ1-overexpressing mice. We identified PPARγ as a 
missing link between BMP2 and TGFβ1 pathways in VSMCs. PPARγ activation can be 
beneficial in TGFβ1-associated diseases, such as PAH, parenchymal lung diseases, 
and Marfan's syndrome.
