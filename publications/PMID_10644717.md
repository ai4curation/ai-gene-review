We report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding the novel 
mammalian serine protease Omi. Omi protein consists of 458 amino acids and has 
homology to bacterial HtrA endoprotease, which acts as a chaperone at low 
temperatures and as a proteolytic enzyme that removes denatured or damaged 
substrates at elevated temperatures. The carboxyl terminus of Omi has extensive 
homology to a mammalian protein called L56 (human HtrA), but unlike L56, which 
is secreted, Omi is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Omi has several 
novel putative protein-protein interaction motifs, as well as a PDZ domain and a 
Src homology 3-binding domain. Omi mRNA is expressed ubiquitously, and the gene 
is localized on human chromosome 2p12. Omi interacts with Mxi2, an alternatively 
spliced form of the p38 stress-activated kinase. Omi protein, when made in a 
heterologous system, shows proteolytic activity against a nonspecific substrate 
beta-casein. The proteolytic activity of Omi is markedly up-regulated in the 
mouse kidney following ischemia/reperfusion.
