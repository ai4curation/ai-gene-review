Epiregulin is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, and has 
certain characteristics that are different from that of EGF, including mitogenic 
responses and binding to EGF receptor (EGFR). Epiregulin may also have another 
cell surface receptor and/or induces different receptor heterodimerizations for 
intracellular signaling. We investigated the binding ability of epiregulin to 
four ErbB family receptors using four human breast carcinoma cell lines that 
expressed different subsets of receptors. Chemical cross-linking experiments 
showed that [125I]epiregulin directly bound to each of EGFR and ErbB-4 but not 
to ErbB-2 and ErbB-3. Furthermore, although epiregulin stimulated tyrosine 
phosphorylation of all four ErbB receptors, the main intracellular signal was 
mediated by ErbB-4 and/or EGFR. The pattern of activation of ErbB family 
receptors was different from that of other EGF-related ligands. Our findings 
indicate that ErbB-4 and EGFR are receptors for epiregulin, and suggest that 
EGF-related ligands transduce signals for different biological responses by the 
hierarchical mechanism.
