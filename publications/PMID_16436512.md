Among acetyltransferases, the MYST family enzyme Esa1p is distinguished for its 
essential function and contribution to transcriptional activation and DNA 
double-stranded break repair. Here we report that Esa1p also plays a key role in 
silencing RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-transcribed genes at telomeres and within 
the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of the nucleolus. These effects are mediated through 
Esa1p's HAT activity and correlate with changes within the nucleolus. Esa1p is 
enriched within the rDNA, as is the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase Sir2p, and 
the acetylation levels of key Esa1p histone targets are reduced in the rDNA in 
esa1 mutants. Although mutants of both ESA1 and SIR2 have enhanced rates of rDNA 
recombination, esa1 effects are more modest yet result in distinct structural 
changes of rDNA chromatin. Surprisingly, increased expression of ESA1 can bypass 
the requirement for Sir2p in rDNA silencing, suggesting that these two enzymes 
with seemingly opposing activities both contribute to achieve optimal nucleolar 
chromatin structure and function.
