Tooth eruption is a precisely timed and sequenced event that brings the tooth 
from within bone into a functional position in the mouth. Every part of the 
developing tooth has been theoretically implicated as a primary factor in this 
process, but it now appears that eruption is multifactorial, with the dental 
follicle and type I collagen playing an important part. Immunological probes 
were used here to investigate in vivo and in vitro the temporal and spatial 
expression of type I collagen and its molecular chaperone Hsp47 in the dental 
follicle during eruption. Mandibles were dissected from 2-, 5-, 9- and 
11-day-old neonatal mice and fixed in 95% ethanol overnight. Sections of 7 
microns were obtained and reacted with antibodies directed against type I 
collagen. Dental follicles were isolated from 2-, 5-, 9- and 11-day-old neonates 
and cells were grown in culture for 8 days. Slides were then reacted with 
antibodies directed against type I collagen and Hsp47. The production of type I 
collagen and Hsp47 in the follicle varied with the stage of dental development 
and eruption. There was a progressive decrease of type I collagen in the coronal 
part of the follicle, leading to an arrest of its production in these areas. 
These findings support the notion that cells of the coronal portion of the 
dental follicle stop producing type I collagen as a prerequisite to the 
initiation of tooth eruption and that this phenotype persists in vitro.
