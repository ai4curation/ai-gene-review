Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) shows an antimicrobial activity towards 
two types of clinically relevant bacteria. The potency of hIAPP varies with its 
aggregation states. Circular dichroism was employed to determine the interaction 
between hIAPP and bacteria lipid membrane mimic. The antimicrobial activity of 
each aggregate species is associated with their ability to induce membrane 
disruption. Our findings provide new evidence revealing the antimicrobial 
activity of amyloid peptide, which suggest a possible connection between amyloid 
peptides and antimicrobial peptides.
