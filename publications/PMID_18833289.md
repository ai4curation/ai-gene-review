SGT1 (Suppressor of G2 allele of skp1), a co-chaperone of HSP90 (Heat-shock 
protein 90), is required for innate immunity in plants and animals. Unveiling 
the cross talks between SGT1 and other co-chaperones such as p23, AHA1 
(Activator of HSP90 ATPase 1) or RAR1 (Required for Mla12 resistance) is an 
important step towards understanding the HSP90 machinery. Nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy and mutational analyses of HSP90 revealed the nature of 
its binding with the CS domain of SGT1. Although CS is structurally similar to 
p23, these domains were found to non-competitively bind to various regions of 
HSP90; yet, unexpectedly, full-length SGT1 could displace p23 from HSP90. RAR1 
partly shares the same binding site with HSP90 as the CS domain, whereas AHA1 
does not. This analysis allowed us to build a structural model of the HSP90-SGT1 
complex and to obtain a compensatory mutant pair between both partners that is 
able to restore virus resistance in vivo through Rx (Resistance to potato virus 
X) immune sensor stabilization.
