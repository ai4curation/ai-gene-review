Proliferating cells, including cancer cells, require altered metabolism to 
efficiently incorporate nutrients such as glucose into biomass. The M2 isoform 
of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) promotes the metabolism of glucose by aerobic 
glycolysis and contributes to anabolic metabolism. Paradoxically, decreased 
pyruvate kinase enzyme activity accompanies the expression of PKM2 in rapidly 
dividing cancer cells and tissues. We demonstrate that phosphoenolpyruvate 
(PEP), the substrate for pyruvate kinase in cells, can act as a phosphate donor 
in mammalian cells because PEP participates in the phosphorylation of the 
glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM1) in PKM2-expressing cells. We 
used mass spectrometry to show that the phosphate from PEP is transferred to the 
catalytic histidine (His11) on human PGAM1. This reaction occurred at 
physiological concentrations of PEP and produced pyruvate in the absence of PKM2 
activity. The presence of histidine-phosphorylated PGAM1 correlated with the 
expression of PKM2 in cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. Thus, decreased 
pyruvate kinase activity in PKM2-expressing cells allows PEP-dependent histidine 
phosphorylation of PGAM1 and may provide an alternate glycolytic pathway that 
decouples adenosine triphosphate production from PEP-mediated phosphotransfer, 
allowing for the high rate of glycolysis to support the anabolic metabolism 
observed in many proliferating cells.
