The tetraspanins are a superfamily of four-transmembrane proteins, which 
regulate the trafficking, lateral diffusion and clustering of the transmembrane 
proteins with which they interact. We have previously shown that tetraspanin 
Tspan9 is expressed on platelets. Here we have characterised gene-trap mice 
lacking Tspan9. The mice were viable with normal platelet numbers and size. 
Tspan9-deficient platelets were specifically defective in aggregation and 
secretion induced by the platelet collagen receptor GPVI, despite normal surface 
GPVI expression levels. A GPVI activation defect was suggested by partially 
impaired GPVI-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. In mechanistic 
experiments, Tspan9 and GPVI co-immunoprecipitated and co-localised, but 
super-resolution imaging revealed no defects in collagen-induced GPVI clustering 
on Tspan9-deficient platelets. However, single particle tracking using total 
internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that GPVI lateral diffusion 
was reduced by approximately 50% in the absence of Tspan9. Therefore, Tspan9 
plays a fine-tuning role in platelet activation by regulating GPVI membrane 
dynamics.
