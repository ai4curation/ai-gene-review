Exon amplification from cosmids mapping to the glioma tumor suppressor gene 
candidate region on chromosome 19q13.3 yielded an exon with high homology to a 
portion of the NOVA1 gene, which encodes a neuron-specific RNA-binding protein 
recognized by the paraneoplastic syndrome antibody anti-Ri. Screening of a human 
brain cDNA library with this exon identified a 1.9 kb cDNA with extensive 
homology to NOVA1, including three nearly identical KH domains characteristic of 
a subtype of RNA-binding proteins. Northern blots demonstrated expression of a 
2.5 kb mRNA in brain, but in no other tissues. In situ hybridization on human 
cerebral cortex showed mRNA expression restricted to astrocytes. We have 
therefore named the gene ANOVA, for astrocytic NOVA1-like gene. Southern 
blotting and single strand conformation polymorphism analyses did not show 
tumor-specific alterations of this gene in gliomas and RT-PCR studies showed 
expression in glioma cell lines, suggesting that ANOVA is not the chromosome 19q 
glioma tumor suppressor gene. Given that two cloned paraneoplastic antigens are 
neuronal RNA-binding proteins and that glial proteins may act as paraneoplastic 
antigens, the ANOVA product may be a target antigen in one of the undefined 
human paraneoplastic syndromes.
