Progression through mitosis requires the coordinated regulation of Cdk1 kinase 
activity. Activation of Cdk1 is a multistep process comprising binding of Cdk1 
to cyclin B, relocation of cyclin-kinase complexes to the nucleus, activating 
phosphorylation of Cdk1 on Thr(161) by the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK; Cdk7 in 
metazoans), and removal of inhibitory Thr(14) and Tyr(15) phosphorylations. This 
dephosphorylation is catalyzed by the dual specific Cdc25 phosphatases, which 
occur in three isoforms in mammalian cells, Cdc25A, -B, and -C. We find that 
expression of Cdc25A leads to an accelerated G(2)/M phase transition. In 
Cdc25A-overexpressing cells, Cdk1 exhibits high kinase activity despite being 
phosphorylated on Tyr(15). In addition, Tyr(15)-phosphorylated Cdk1 binds more 
cyclin B in Cdc25A-overexpressing cells compared with control cells. Consistent 
with this observation, we demonstrate that in human transformed cells, Cdc25A 
and Cdc25B, but not Cdc25C phosphatases have an effect on timing and efficiency 
of cyclin-kinase complex formation. Overexpression of Cdc25A or Cdc25B promotes 
earlier assembly and activation of Cdk1-cyclin B complexes, whereas repression 
of these phosphatases by short hairpin RNA has a reverse effect, leading to a 
substantial decrease in amounts of cyclin B-bound Cdk1 in G(2) and mitosis. 
Importantly, we find that Cdc25A overexpression leads to an activation of Cdk7 
and increase in Thr(161) phosphorylation of Cdk1. In conclusion, our data 
suggest that complex assembly and dephosphorylation of Cdk1 at G(2)/M is tightly 
coupled and regulated by Cdc25 phosphatases.
