Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is known to inhibit collagen-induced 
platelet aggregation. Collagen-induced binding of 125I-PDGF to human washed 
platelets was therefore investigated. It was found 1) to be time-dependent, 
reaching a plateau at 20 degrees C after 30 min, 2) collagen 
concentration-dependent, 3) specifically inhibited by unlabeled PDGF, and 4) 
saturable. Scatchard plot analysis showed a single class of sites with 3000 +/- 
450 molecules bound/cell and an apparent KD of 1.2 +/- 0.2 10(-8) M. The effects 
of PDGF on collagen-induced phosphoinositide breakdown and protein 
phosphorylation were also investigated. At 50 ng/ml PDGF, a concentration which 
completely inhibited collagen-induced aggregation, the breakdown of 
[32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) and [32P]phosphatidylinositol 
4-phosphate (PIP) was observed, but the subsequent replenishment of [32P]PIP2 
was inhibited. The same PDGF concentration totally inhibited collagen-induced 
phosphatidic acid formation. PDGF also completely prevented phosphorylation of 
P43 and P20, as a result of protein kinase C activation consecutive to 
phosphoinositide metabolism. These results suggest that (i) a specific PDGF 
receptor can be induced by collagen, and (ii) PDGF can effect the early events 
of collagen-induced platelet activation by inhibiting PIP2 resynthesis and P43 
and P20 phosphorylation. It is concluded that PDGF might be involved in a 
negative feed-back control of platelet activation.
