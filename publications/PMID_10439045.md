Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a highly pleiotropic cytokine whose activity is 
at least partially regulated by the redox status of the cell. The cellular redox 
status is controlled primarily by glutathione, a major cellular antioxidant, 
whose synthesis is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme gamma-glutamylcysteine 
synthetase (gamma-GCS). In the present report we investigated the effect of 
gamma-GCS overexpression on the TNF-induced activation of nuclear transcription 
factors NF-kappa B and AP-1, stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun 
amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and apoptosis. Transfection of cells with gamma-GCS 
cDNA blocked TNF-induced NF-kappa B activation, cytoplasmic I kappa B alpha 
degradation, nuclear translocation of p65, and NF-kappa B-dependent gene 
transcription. gamma-GCS overexpression also completely suppressed NF-kappa B 
activation induced by phorbol ester and okadaic acid, whereas that induced by 
H2O2, ceramide, and lipopolysaccharide was minimally affected. gamma-GCS also 
abolished the activation of AP-1 induced by TNF and inhibited TNF-induced 
activation of JNK and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. TNF-mediated 
cytotoxicity and activation of caspase-3 were both abrogated in 
gamma-GCS-overexpressing cells. Overall, our results indicate that most of the 
pleiotropic actions of TNF are regulated by the glutathione-controlled redox 
status of the cell.
