Neural crest-derived melanocyte precursors (MPs) in avian and murine embryos 
emerge from the dorsal neural tube into a migration staging area (MSA). MPs 
subsequently migrate from the MSA on a dorsolateral pathway between the 
dermamyotome and the overlying epithelium. In mouse embryos, MPs express the 
receptor tyrosine kinase, KIT, and require its cognate ligand, Mast cell growth 
factor (MGF), for survival and differentiation. Prior to the onset of MP 
migration, MGF is expressed on the dorsolateral pathway at some distance from 
cells in the MSA and appears to be required for normal MP development. To learn 
if MGF is required solely for MP survival on this pathway, or if it also 
provides directional cues for migration, we uncoupled survival from 
chemoattractive or motogenic functions of this ligand using mice that carry a 
targeted mutation at the Neurofibromin (Nf1) locus and consequently lack RAS-GAP 
function. We show that Nf1-mutant MPs survive in the absence of MGF in vitro and 
in vivo and that Nf1-mutant MPs disperse normally on the lateral migration 
pathway in the presence of MGF. In contrast, Nf1-mutant MPs persist in the 
location of the MSA but are not observed on the lateral migration pathway in 
double-mutant mice that also lack MGF. We conclude that MGF/KIT function 
provides a signal required for directed migration of the MPs on the lateral 
pathway in vivo, independent of its function in survival. We further suggest 
that the MGF mediates MP migration through a signaling pathway that does not 
involve RAS.
