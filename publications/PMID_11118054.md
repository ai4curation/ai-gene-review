Thioredoxin (TRX) is a cytoplasmic, redox-sensitive signaling factor believed to 
participate in the regulation of nuclear transcription factors mediating 
cellular responses to environmental stress. Activation of the activator protein 
(AP)-1 transcription factor is thought to be mediated in part by redox-sensitive 
interactions between the nuclear signaling protein redox factor-1 (Ref-1) and 
TRX. In this study, the role of TRX and Ref-1 in the activation of the AP-1 
complex was examined in HeLa and Jurkat cell lines exposed to ionizing radiation 
(IR). After exposure to IR, nuclear levels of immunoreactive TRX increased, 
accompanied by an increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity. It was shown that a 
physical interaction between Ref-1 and TRX occurs within the nucleus and is 
enhanced after exposure to IR. Furthermore, TRX immunoprecipitated from 
irradiated cells was capable of activating AP-1 DNA binding activity in 
nonirradiated nuclear extracts. In addition, immunodepletion of Ref-1 from 
nuclear extracts demonstrated that the increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity 
after IR was also dependent upon the presence of Ref-1 from irradiated cells. 
Finally, the ability of both TRX and Ref-1 from irradiated cells to stimulate 
AP-1 DNA binding in nonirradiated nuclear extracts was abolished by chemical 
oxidation and restored by chemical reduction. These results indicate that, in 
response to IR, TRX and Ref-1 undergo changes in redox state that contribute to 
the activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity. These experiments suggest that a 
redox-sensitive signaling pathway leading from TRX to Ref-1 to the AP-1 complex 
participates in the up-regulation of DNA binding activity in response to 
ionizing radiation.
