phospholipase D superfamily.

We have identified a human gene encoding a protein with 48% amino acid identity 
to the vaccinia virus (VV) K4L gene product. Both contain motifs characteristic 
of the phospholipase D (PLD) protein superfamily. These proteins are also 
related to vaccinia virus p37, encoded by the F13L gene, which is required for 
envelopment and spread of the virus. The similarity to phospholipase D provides 
insight into the mechanisms and evolution of these processes.
