T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of T cells requires the 
interaction of dozens of proteins. Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry 
and activated primary CD4(+) T cells from mice in which a tag for affinity 
purification was knocked into several genes to determine the composition and 
dynamics of multiprotein complexes that formed around the kinase Zap70 and the 
adaptors Lat and SLP-76. Most of the 112 high-confidence time-resolved protein 
interactions we observed were previously unknown. The surface receptor CD6 was 
able to initiate its own signaling pathway by recruiting SLP-76 and the guanine 
nucleotide-exchange factor Vav1 regardless of the presence of Lat. Our findings 
provide a more complete model of TCR signaling in which CD6 constitutes a 
signaling hub that contributes to the diversification of TCR signaling.
