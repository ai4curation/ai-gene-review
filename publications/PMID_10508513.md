Gadd45a-null mice generated by gene targeting exhibited several of the 
phenotypes characteristic of p53-deficient mice, including genomic instability, 
increased radiation carcinogenesis and a low frequency of exencephaly. Genomic 
instability was exemplified by aneuploidy, chromosome aberrations, gene 
amplification and centrosome amplification, and was accompanied by abnormalities 
in mitosis, cytokinesis and growth control. Unequal segregation of chromosomes 
due to multiple spindle poles during mitosis occurred in several Gadd45a -/- 
cell lineages and may contribute to the aneuploidy. Our results indicate that 
Gadd45a is one component of the p53 pathway that contributes to the maintenance 
of genomic stability.
