Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens use a syringe-like apparatus called a 
type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host cells. Some of 
these effectors are enzymes that modify host proteins to subvert their normal 
functions. NleB is a glycosyltransferase that modifies host proteins with 
N-acetyl-d-glucosamine to inhibit antibacterial and inflammatory host responses. 
NleB is conserved among the attaching/effacing pathogens enterohemorrhagic 
Escherichia coli (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and Citrobacter 
rodentium Moreover, Salmonella enterica strains encode up to three NleB 
orthologs named SseK1, SseK2, and SseK3. However, there are conflicting reports 
regarding the activities and host protein targets among the NleB/SseK orthologs. 
Therefore, here we performed in vitro glycosylation assays and cell culture 
experiments to compare the activities and substrate specificities of these 
effectors. SseK1, SseK3, EHEC NleB1, EPEC NleB1, and Crodentium NleB blocked 
TNF-mediated NF-κB pathway activation, whereas SseK2 and NleB2 did not. C. 
rodentium NleB, EHEC NleB1, and SseK1 glycosylated host GAPDH. C. rodentium 
NleB, EHEC NleB1, EPEC NleB1, and SseK2 glycosylated the FADD (Fas-associated 
death domain protein). SseK3 and NleB2 were not active against either substrate. 
We also found that EHEC NleB1 glycosylated two GAPDH arginine residues, Arg197 
and Arg200, and that these two residues were essential for GAPDH-mediated 
activation of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 ubiquitination. These results 
provide evidence that members of this highly conserved family of bacterial 
virulence effectors target different host protein substrates and exhibit 
distinct cellular modes of action to suppress host responses.
