Agrin is an extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) well known 
for its role in modulation of the neuromuscular junction during development. 
Although agrin is one of the major HSPGs of the brain, its function there 
remains elusive. Here we provide evidence suggesting a possible function for 
agrin in Alzheimer's disease brain. Agrin protein binds the amyloidogenic 
peptide Abeta (1-40) in its fibrillar state via a mechanism that involves the 
heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains of agrin. Furthermore, agrin is able to 
accelerate Abeta fibril formation and protect Abeta (1-40) from proteolysis, in 
vitro. Supporting a biological significance for these in vitro data, 
immunocytochemical studies demonstrate agrin's presence within senile plaques 
and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, and agrin immunostained capillaries 
exhibit pathological alterations in AD brain. These data therefore suggest that 
agrin may be an important factor in the progression of Abeta peptide aggregation 
and/or its persistence in Alzheimer's disease brain.
