Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been identified as the causal molecule 
for autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Experimental evidence indicates 
that LRRK2 may play an important role in the pathology induced by abnormal 
phosphorylation of tau. In the present study, we demonstrated that LRRK2 
directly associates with GSK-3β, and that this interaction enhances the kinase 
activity of GSK-3β. Furthermore, we found that LRRK2-mediated activation of 
GSK-3β induces high phosphorylation of tau at Ser396 in SH-SY5Y cells. From our 
present findings, we conclude that LRRK2 may function as a novel enhancer for 
GSK-3β and as a physiological regulator of neurite outgrowth and axonal 
transport through regulation of the GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of tau at 
the cellular level. Since LRRK2 is detected in tau-positive inclusions in brain 
tissue affected by various neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, 
LRRK2-stimulated phosphorylation of tau by GSK-3β may be involved in development 
of pathological features in the initial stage of PD.
