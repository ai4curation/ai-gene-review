The molecular co-chaperone BAG1 and other members of the BAG family bind to 
Hsp70/Hsc70 heat shock proteins through a conserved BAG domain that interacts 
with the ATPase domain of the chaperone. BAG1 and other accessory proteins 
stimulate ATP hydrolysis and regulate the ATP-driven activity of the chaperone 
complexes. Contacts are made through residues in helices alpha2 and alpha3 of 
the BAG domain and predominantly residues in the C-terminal lobe of the bi-lobed 
Hsc70 ATPase domain. Within the C-terminal lobe, a subdomain exists that 
contains all the contacts shown by mutagenesis to be required for BAG1 
recognition. In this study, the subdomain, representing Hsc70 residues 229-309, 
was cloned and expressed as a separately folded unit. The results of in vitro 
binding assays demonstrate that this subdomain is sufficient for binding to 
BAG1. Binding analyses with surface plasmon resonance indicated that the 
subdomain binds to BAG1 with a 10-fold decrease in equilibrium dissociation 
constant (K(D) = 22 nM) relative to the intact ATPase domain. This result 
suggests that the stabilizing contacts for docking of BAG1 to Hsc70 are located 
in the C-terminal lobe of the ATPase domain. These findings provide new insights 
into the role of co-chaperones as nucleotide exchange factors.
