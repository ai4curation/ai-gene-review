X-chromosome inactivation is the mechanism ensuring dosage compensation in 
mammals. It is regulated by the X-inactivation center (Xic), which harbors the 
main regulator of XCI, the long non-coding RNA Xist. In the past two years 
significant advances have been made in our understanding of how Xist is 
regulated by its neighbors in the Xic and in a developmental context. New 
technologies, such as chromosome conformation capture and live cell imaging, 
have helped us understand the topological organization of the Xic and the 
dynamics of this locus during differentiation. Here, we will describe some of 
the most recent findings made in X-inactivation research with a special focus on 
the regulation of Xist and the spatial organization of the Xic.
