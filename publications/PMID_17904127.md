We previously reported that inhibition of SVH-B, a specific splicing variant of 
SVH, results in apoptotic cell death. In this study, we reveal that this 
apoptosis may be dependent on the presence of p53. Co-immunoprecipitation and 
GST pull-down assays have demonstrated that SVH-B directly interacts with p53. 
In both BEL-7404 cells and p53-null Saos-2 cells transfected with a 
temperature-sensitive mutant of p53, V143A, ectopically expressed SVH-B 
suppresses the transcriptional activity of p53, and suppression of SVH by RNA 
interference increases the transcriptional activity of p53. Our results 
suggested the function of SVH-B in accelerating growth and inhibition of 
apoptosis is related to its inhibitory binding to p53.
