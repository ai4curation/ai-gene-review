Regions of hypoxia are a hallmark of solid tumors. Tumor cells modulate the 
regulation of specific genes allowing adaptation and survival in the harsh 
hypoxic environment. We have identified SKIP3, a novel human kinase-like gene, 
which is overexpressed in multiple human tumors and is regulated by hypoxia. 
SKIP3 is an ortholog of the Drosophila tribbles, rat NIPK, dog C5FW, and human 
C8FW genes. Drosophila tribbles is involved in slowing cell-cycle progression 
during Drosophila development, but little is known regarding the function or 
tissue distribution of the vertebrate orthologs. We show that the normal tissue 
expression of SKIP3 is confined to human liver, while multiple primary human 
lung, colon, and breast tumors express high levels of SKIP3 transcript. 
Endogenous SKIP3 protein accumulates within 48 h under hypoxic growth conditions 
in HT-29 and PC-3 cells, with upregulation of the SKIP3 mRNA transcript by 72 h. 
We identified activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) as a SKIP3-binding 
partner using the yeast-two-hybrid assay. Coexpression of SKIP3 and ATF4 showed 
that SKIP3 is associated with the proteolysis of ATF4, which can be blocked 
using a proteosome inhibitor. These results indicate that SKIP3 may be an 
important participant in tumor cell growth.
