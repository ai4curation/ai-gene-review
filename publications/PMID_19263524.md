BACKGROUND: Inflammation and inflammatory markers play an important role in 
acute ischemic stroke (AIS). In an earlier study, we discovered a 120-kDa 
protein that was highly expressed in healthy participants, but either was not 
expressed or was barely expressed in AIS patients. The purpose of the present 
work was to isolate, characterize, and evaluate this 120-kDa protein in blood 
samples of AIS patients. In addition, we investigated how the identified protein 
compared with protein S-100betabeta, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and cytokine 
interleukins IL-2 and IL-10.
METHODS: The 120-kDa protein band was analyzed via LC-MS/MS analysis. Then, the 
120-kDa protein was evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay in 
serum samples from AIS patients, which were collected 0, 24, 48, 72 and 144 h 
after admission.
RESULTS: The amino acid sequence of an internal fragment identified the 120-kDa 
protein as inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 (ITIH4). The ITIH4 
protein was completely absent in AIS patients as compared to those in the 
control group, and serum levels returned to normal in AIS patients as their 
condition improved. Expression of S-100 betabeta, NSE, IL-2, and IL-10 were 
highly correlated with ITIH4 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: ITIH4 is an anti-inflammatory protein, and suggests that further 
investigation into its potential use in the diagnosis and prognosis of AIS is 
warranted.
