A fundamental characteristic of metazoans is the formation of a simple, 
polarized epithelium. In higher animals, the structural integrity and functional 
polarization of simple epithelia require a cell-cell adhesion complex that 
contains a classical cadherin, the Wnt-signaling protein β-catenin and the 
actin-binding protein α-catenin. We show that the non-metazoan Dictyostelium 
discoideum forms a polarized epithelium that is essential for multicellular 
development. Although D. discoideum lacks a cadherin homolog, we identify an 
α-catenin ortholog that binds a β-catenin-related protein. Both proteins are 
essential for formation of the epithelium, polarized protein secretion, and 
proper multicellular morphogenesis. Thus, the organizational principles of 
metazoan multicellularity may be more ancient than previously recognized, and 
the role of the catenins in cell polarity predates the evolution of Wnt 
signaling and classical cadherins.

A polarized epithelium in the non-metazoan Dictyostelium discoideum requires α-catenin and β-catenin but not classical cadherins, polarity proteins or Wnt signaling.

A fundamental characteristic of metazoans is the formation of a simple, polarized epithelium. In higher animals, the structural integrity and functional polarization of simple epithelia require a cell-cell adhesion complex containing a classical cadherin, the Wnt-signaling protein β-catenin and the actin-binding protein α-catenin. We show that the non-metazoan Dictyostelium discoideum forms a polarized epithelium that is essential for multicellular development. Although D. discoideum lacks a cadherin homolog, we identify an α-catenin ortholog that binds a β-catenin-related protein. Both proteins are essential for formation of the epithelium, polarized protein secretion and proper multicellular morphogenesis. Thus the organizational principles of metazoan multicellularity may be more ancient than previously recognized, and the role of the catenins in cell polarity predates the evolution of Wnt signaling and classical cadherins.

A simple epithelium is the most basic tissue type in metazoans (multicellular animals). It is the first overt sign of cellular differentiation during embryogenesis, and is important for the morphogenesis of many tissues and homeostasis in the adult ( 1 ). A simple epithelium comprises a cell monolayer surrounding a luminal space. The cells have a polarized organization of plasma membrane proteins, organelles and cytoskeletal networks that together regulate the directional absorption and secretion of proteins and other solutes ( 1 ).

The structural integrity and functional polarity of epithelial tissues in higher animals require cell-cell adhesion mediated by classical cadherins ( 2 ). Adhesion provides a spatial cue that initiates cell polarization via recruitment of cadherin-associated cytosolic proteins ( 3 ), including the Wnt signaling protein β-catenin ( 4 ) and the actin-binding protein α-catenin ( 5 ). Classical cadherins, which have extracellular cadherin repeats ( 6 ) and a conserved cytoplasmic domain that can bind β-catenin ( 7 ), are found in all multicellular animals including sponges, but not in choanoflagellates ( 8 - 10 ), suggesting that classical cadherins are restricted to metazoans. However, the evolutionary history of the catenins is unknown, and thus it is unclear how the cadherin-catenin complex evolved to mediate epithelial polarity in metazoans.

A) D. discoideum developmental process. Abbreviations: M, mound; Sl, slug; C, culminant; FB, fruiting body.

B) Confocal section of the tip of a wild-type culminant. Brackets indicate the tip epithelium; arrowheads indicate the stalk tube; S indicates the stalk.

C) Maximum intensity projections showing Golgi (left), centrosomes (right) and nuclei (DAPI stain) in the entire tip (upper panels) or tip epithelium (lower panels).

D) Confocal section of the tip (upper panels) and tip epithelium (lower panels) in a wild-type culminant expressing cellulose synthase (mRFP-dcsA). In tip epithelia cells, mRFP-dcsA localizes to the tip epithelial cell membrane adjacent to the stalk (arrowheads). mRFP-dcsA is also expressed in the stalk cells.

Scale bars: 10 μm in lower-magnification views (B-D) and 2 μm in higher-magnification views (C&D). In views of the tip epithelium, the top of the images faces the stalk.

Arrowheads indicate residual localization of mRFP-dcsA in mild Dd α-catenin knockdowns and Aardvark knockouts. Scale bars: 25 μm (A), 10 μm in lower-magnification views (B-D) or 2 μm in higher-magnification views (C&D).

The fact that the catenin complex is essential for epithelial polarity in both D. discoideum and metazoans indicates that this complex likely functioned in cell polarity prior to the divergence of social amoebae and metazoans. It is possible that the catenins evolved initially to mediate cell polarity in a unicellular organism, and then were used to organize cell polarity in a multicellular context in both social amoebae and metazoans. Alternatively, the last common ancestor of social amoebae and metazoans may have formed a polarized epithelial tissue organized by the catenin complex, but epithelial polarity was lost in some intervening lineages ( 9 ). In either case, our results identify unexpected similarities in tissue organization between two groups of distantly related organisms that were thought to have evolved multicellularity independently ( 23 ), and thereby reveal molecular factors and organizational principles that may have contributed to the early evolution and diversification of animals.
