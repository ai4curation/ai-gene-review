XIAP prevents apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting caspases, and this 
inhibition can be relieved by IAP antagonists, such as Smac/DIABLO. IAP 
antagonist compounds (IACs) have therefore been designed to inhibit XIAP to kill 
tumor cells. Because XIAP inhibits postmitochondrial caspases, caspase 8 
inhibitors should not block killing by IACs. Instead, we show that apoptosis 
caused by an IAC is blocked by the caspase 8 inhibitor crmA and that IAP 
antagonists activate NF-kappaB signaling via inhibtion of cIAP1. In sensitive 
tumor lines, IAP antagonist induced NF-kappaB-stimulated production of TNFalpha 
that killed cells in an autocrine fashion. Inhibition of NF-kappaB reduced 
TNFalpha production, and blocking NF-kappaB activation or TNFalpha allowed tumor 
cells to survive IAC-induced apoptosis. Cells treated with an IAC, or those in 
which cIAP1 was deleted, became sensitive to apoptosis induced by exogenous 
TNFalpha, suggesting novel uses of these compounds in treating cancer.
