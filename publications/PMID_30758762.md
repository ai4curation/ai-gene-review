The biosynthesis of the dinuclear metal cluster at the active sites of the 
[NiFe]-hydrogenase enzymes is a multi-step process executed by a suite of 
accessory proteins. Nickel insertion during maturation of Escherichia coli 
[NiFe]-hydrogenase 3 is achieved by the metallochaperones HypA, SlyD and the 
GTPase HypB, but how these proteins cooperate to ensure nickel delivery is not 
known. In this study, the complexes formed between the individual purified 
proteins were examined by using several methods. Size exclusion chromatography 
(SEC) indicated that SlyD and HypB interact primarily in a 1:1 complex. The 
affinity of HypB-SlyD was measured by using surface plasmon resonance, which 
revealed a KD of 24 ± 10 nM in the absence of nucleotide and an interaction 
several fold tighter in the presence of GDP. A ternary complex between all three 
proteins was not detected, and instead SlyD blocked the interaction of HypA with 
HypB in competitive binding experiments. Furthermore, cross-linking experiments 
suggest a weak interaction between HypA and SlyD, which is not detectable by 
SEC. Electrochemical analysis confirmed each of the pairwise interactions and 
that the relative affinities of these complexes are on the order of 
HypB-SlyD > HypB-HypA > HypA-SlyD. These results indicate a hierarchy of 
interactions, as opposed to a single multiprotein complex, and provide insight 
into the nickel delivery process during hydrogenase enzyme maturation.
