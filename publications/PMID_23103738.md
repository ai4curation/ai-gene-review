Aggregated forms of the amyloid-β peptide are hypothesized to act as the prime 
toxic agents in Alzheimer disease (AD). The in vivo amyloid-β peptide pool 
consists of both C- and N-terminally truncated or mutated peptides, and the 
composition thereof significantly determines AD risk. Other variations, such as 
biotinylation, are introduced as molecular tools to aid the understanding of 
disease mechanisms. Since these modifications have the potential to alter key 
aggregation properties of the amyloid-β peptide, we present a comparative study 
of the aggregation of a substantial set of the most common in vivo identified 
and in vitro produced amyloid-β peptides.
