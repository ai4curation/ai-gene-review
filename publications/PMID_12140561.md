Tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is the only 
TRAF family member that participates in signal transduction of both the TNF 
receptor (TNFR) superfamily and the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)/Toll-like 
receptor (TLR) superfamily; it is important for adaptive immunity, innate 
immunity and bone homeostasis. Here we report crystal structures of TRAF6, alone 
and in complex with TRAF6-binding peptides from CD40 and TRANCE-R (also known as 
RANK), members of the TNFR superfamily, to gain insight into the mechanism by 
which TRAF6 mediates several signalling cascades. A 40 degrees difference in the 
directions of the bound peptides in TRAF6 and TRAF2 shows that there are marked 
structural differences between receptor recognition by TRAF6 and other TRAFs. 
The structural determinant of the petide TRAF6 interaction reveals a 
Pro-X-Glu-X-X-(aromatic/acidic residue) TRAF6-binding motif, which is present 
not only in CD40 and TRANCE-R but also in the three IRAK adapter kinases for 
IL-1R/TLR signalling. Cell-permeable peptides with the TRAF6-binding motif 
inhibit TRAF6 signalling, which indicates their potential as therapeutic 
modulators. Our studies identify a universal mechanism by which TRAF6 regulates 
several signalling cascades in adaptive immunity, innate immunity and bone 
homeostasis.
