Stats (signal transducer and activator of transcription) are latent 
transcription factors that translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. 
Constitutive activation of Stat3 alpha by upstream oncoproteins and receptor 
tyrosine kinases has been found in many human tumors and tumor-derived cell 
lines. Constitutively activated Stat3 alpha is often correlated with the 
activation of ErbB-2, a member of the EGFR family. To explore the involvement of 
ErbB-2 in the activation of Stat3 and the mechanism underlying this event, an 
ErbB-2 point mutant was used as a model of constitutively activated receptor. 
Phenylalanine mutations (Y-->F) were made in the autophosphorylation sites of 
the receptor, and their ability to activate Stat3 alpha was evaluated. Our 
results suggest that Stat3 alpha and JAK2 associates with ErbB-2 prior to 
phosphorylation of the receptor and that full activation of Stat3 alpha by 
ErbB-2 requires the participation of other non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Both 
Src and Jak2 kinases contribute to the activation of Stat3 alpha but Src binds 
to ErbB-2 only when the receptor is phosphorylated. Our results also suggest 
that tyrosine 1139 may be important for Src homology 2 domain association 
because a mutant lacking this tyrosine reduces the ability of the Src homology 2 
domain to bind to ErbB-2 and significantly decreases its ability to activate 
Stat3 alpha.
