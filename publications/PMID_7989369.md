The fibronectin (Fn) monomer contains two major sites of fibrin binding affinity 
present within the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains; they consist of five 
(1F1-5F1) and three (10F1-12F1) consecutive type 1 modules, respectively. 
Recently, we have reported that the fourth and fifth type 1 module pair 
(4F1.5F1) of the NH2-terminal domain of fibronectin demonstrated fibrin binding 
ability (Williams, M. J., Phan, I., Harvery, T. S., Rostagno, A., Gold, L. I., 
and Campbell, I. D. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 235, 1303-1311). In an attempt to 
further localize fibrin binding activity and to characterize the nature of the 
interaction between different type 1 modules of Fn and fibrin, we have tested a 
range of recombinant proteins and subtilisin generated proteolytic fragments of 
Fn in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by fibrin affinity 
chromatography. Of the recombinant proteins, we found that only the 4F1.5F1 
exhibited significant fibrin binding activity, while 1F1, 1F1.2F1, 7F1, and 10F1 
had little to no affinity for fibrin. On a molar basis, 4-5 times more 4F1.5F1 
than a proteolytic fragment, corresponding to 1F1-5F1 (25.9 kDa) was required to 
cause 50% inhibition (IC50) of intact biotinylated Fn binding to fibrin in a 
competitive ELISA. This suggests that all five type 1 modules in tandem engender 
higher fibrin binding activity than the 4F1.5F1 alone. Furthermore, since fibrin 
binding activity of the intact Fn molecule was inhibited, by 70-80%, by the 
4F1.5F1, the 25.9-kDa fragment, and a MoAb mapped to an epitope on the 4F1.5F1, 
the fibrin-binding site within the 4F1.5F1 contributes greatly to the 
non-covalent interaction of intact Fn with fibrin. These results provide 
significant insight into the Fn/fibrin interaction, a major component of the 
processes of wound repair and fibrin matrix assembly.
