We report biochemical characterization of two recently identified mutants of 
yeast RAS2, RAS2-E99K and RAS2-E130K. These mutants exhibit dominant activating 
phenotypes in yeast. Characterization of their intrinsic GTPase and GDP 
dissociation as well as their ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase showed that 
these activities of RAS2-E99K mutant protein were similar to those of the wild 
type protein. RAS2-E130K protein, on the other hand, differed from the wild type 
protein with a fast GDP dissociation rate and 2-fold higher activation of 
adenylate cyclase. When the sensitivity to GTPase-activating protein (GAP) was 
examined, we found that the RAS2-E99K protein was approximately 1200-fold less 
sensitive to NF1-GAP activity. In addition, the affinity for NF1 as revealed by 
competition binding experiments was reduced more than 150-fold with RAS2-E99K 
protein. Thus, the RAS2-E99K mutation affects interaction with GAP proteins. 
This mutation is particularly interesting because it is the first mutation 
identified in the alpha 3 region of ras protein that affects GAP interaction. 
The alpha 3 region appears to be directly involved in interaction with NF1, 
since peptides containing the sequence encompassing residue 99 of RAS2 inhibit 
NF1-GAP activity. These results suggest that the interaction between ras and GAP 
involves a larger region within ras than previously recognized.
