The TIM10 complex is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and 
mediates insertion of hydrophobic proteins at the inner membrane. We have 
characterized TIM10 assembly and analyzed the structural properties of its 
subunits, Tim9 and Tim10. Both proteins are alpha-helical with a 
protease-resistant central domain, and each self-associates to form mainly 
dimers and trimers in solution. Tim9 and Tim10 bound to one another with 
submicromolar affinity in equimolar amounts and assembled in a stable, 
significantly extended complex that was indistinguishable from the native 
mitochondrial TIM10 complex. Importantly, the reconstituted TIM10 complex is 
functional because it bound to the physiological substrate ADP/ATP carrier and 
displayed chaperone activity in refolding the model substrate firefly 
luciferase. These data demonstrate that the individual subunits can exist as 
independent, dynamically self-associating proteins. Assembly into the 
thermodynamically stable hexameric complex is necessary for the TIM10 chaperone 
function.
