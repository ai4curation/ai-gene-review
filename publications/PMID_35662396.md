Lysosomes are the main organelles in macrophages for killing invading bacteria. 
However, the precise mechanism underlying lysosomal biogenesis upon bacterial 
infection remains enigmatic. We demonstrate here that LPS stimulation increases 
IRG1-dependent itaconate production, which promotes lysosomal biogenesis by 
activating the transcription factor, TFEB. Mechanistically, itaconate directly 
alkylates human TFEB at cysteine 212 (Cys270 in mice) to induce its nuclear 
localization by antagonizing mTOR-mediated phosphorylation and cytosolic 
retention. Functionally, abrogation of itaconate synthesis by IRG1/Irg1 knockout 
or expression of an alkylation-deficient TFEB mutant impairs the antibacterial 
ability of macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, knockin mice harboring an 
alkylation-deficient TFEB mutant display elevated susceptibility to Salmonella 
typhimurium infection, whereas in vivo treatment of OI, a cell-permeable 
itaconate derivative, limits inflammation. Our study identifies itaconate as an 
endogenous metabolite that functions as a lysosomal inducer in macrophages in 
response to bacterial infection, implying the potential therapeutic utility of 
itaconate in treating human bacterial infection.
