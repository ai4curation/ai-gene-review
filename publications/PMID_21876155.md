Yeast rad3-102, a mutant of the TFIIH complex involved in nucleotide excision 
repair (NER) and transcription, can perform NER initial steps but not late steps 
of postincision gap filing. Because removal of early-acting NER proteins 
prevents rad3-102 deleterious action, we used this feature to explore if 
chaperones act in early NER. We found that the cochaperone Ydj1 is required for 
NER and that Ydj1 guarantees TFIIH stoichiometry. Importantly, in the absence of 
Ydj1, the roles of TFIIH in transcription and transactivation, the ability to 
activate transcription by nuclear receptors in response to hormones, are 
strongly impaired. We propose that TFIIH constitutes a multitarget complex for 
Ydj1, as six of the seven TFIIH core components contain biologically relevant 
Ydj1- binding motives. Our results provide evidence for a role of chaperones in 
NER and transcription, with implications in cancer and TFIIH-associated 
syndromes.
