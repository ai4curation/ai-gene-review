TERT, the protein component of telomerase, serves to maintain telomere function 
through the de novo addition of telomere repeats to chromosome ends, and is 
reactivated in 90% of human cancers. In normal tissues, TERT is expressed in 
stem cells and in progenitor cells, but its role in these compartments is not 
fully understood. Here we show that conditional transgenic induction of TERT in 
mouse skin epithelium causes a rapid transition from telogen (the resting phase 
of the hair follicle cycle) to anagen (the active phase), thereby facilitating 
robust hair growth. TERT overexpression promotes this developmental transition 
by causing proliferation of quiescent, multipotent stem cells in the hair 
follicle bulge region. This new function for TERT does not require the 
telomerase RNA component, which encodes the template for telomere addition, and 
therefore operates through a mechanism independent of its activity in 
synthesizing telomere repeats. These data indicate that, in addition to its 
established role in extending telomeres, TERT can promote proliferation of 
resting stem cells through a non-canonical pathway.
