Transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) coordinately regulates 
cytoprotective gene expression, but under unstressed conditions, Nrf2 is 
degraded rapidly through Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1)-mediated 
ubiquitination. Nrf2 harbors two Keap1-binding motifs, DLG and ETGE. 
Interactions between these two motifs and Keap1 constitute a key regulatory 
nexus for cellular Nrf2 activity through the formation of a two-site binding 
hinge-and-latch mechanism. In this study, we determined the minimum 
Keap1-binding sequence of the DLG motif, the low-affinity latch site, and 
defined a new DLGex motif that covers a sequence much longer than that 
previously defined. We have successfully clarified the crystal structure of the 
Keap1-DC-DLGex complex at 1.6 Å. DLGex possesses a complicated helix structure, 
which interprets well the human-cancer-derived loss-of-function mutations in 
DLGex. In thermodynamic analyses, Keap1-DLGex binding is characterized as 
enthalpy and entropy driven, while Keap1-ETGE binding is characterized as purely 
enthalpy driven. In kinetic analyses, Keap1-DLGex binding follows a 
fast-association and fast-dissociation model, while Keap1-ETGE binding contains 
a slow-reaction step that leads to a stable conformation. These results 
demonstrate that the mode of DLGex binding to Keap1 is distinct from that of 
ETGE structurally, thermodynamically, and kinetically and support our contention 
that the DLGex motif serves as a converter transmitting environmental stress to 
Nrf2 induction as the latch site.
