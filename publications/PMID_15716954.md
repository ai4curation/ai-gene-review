Genetic analyses in Caenorhabditis elegans have been instrumental in the 
elucidation of the central cell-death machinery, which is conserved from C. 
elegans to mammals. One possible difference that has emerged is the role of 
mitochondria. By releasing cytochrome c, mitochondria are involved in the 
activation of caspases in mammals. However, there has previously been no 
evidence that mitochondria are involved in caspase activation in C. elegans. 
Here we show that mitochondria fragment in cells that normally undergo 
programmed cell death during C. elegans development. Mitochondrial fragmentation 
is induced by the BH3-only protein EGL-1 and can be blocked by mutations in the 
bcl-2-like gene ced-9, indicating that members of the Bcl-2 family might 
function in the regulation of mitochondrial fragmentation in apoptotic cells. 
Mitochondrial fragmentation is independent of CED-4/Apaf-1 and CED-3/caspase, 
indicating that it occurs before or simultaneously with their activation. 
Furthermore, DRP-1/dynamin-related protein, a key component of the mitochondrial 
fission machinery, is required and sufficient to induce mitochondrial 
fragmentation and programmed cell death during C. elegans development. These 
results assign an important role to mitochondria in the cell-death pathway in C. 
elegans.
