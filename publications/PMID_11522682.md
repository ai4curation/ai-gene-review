Nonenzymatic glycation appears to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of 
diabetic complications. Key early intermediates in this process are 
fructosamines, such as protein-bound fructoselysines. In this report, we 
describe the purification and characterization of a mammalian 
fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K), which phosphorylates fructoselysine (FL) residues 
on glycated proteins, to FL-3-phosphate (FL3P). This phosphorylation 
destabilizes the FL adduct and leads to its spontaneous decomposition, thereby 
reversing the nonenzymatic glycation process at an early stage. FN3K was 
purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes and sequenced by means of 
electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The protein thus identified is a 35-kDa 
monomer that appears to be expressed in all mammalian tissues. It has no 
significant homology to other known proteins and appears to be encoded by 
genomic sequences located on human chromosomes 1 and 17. The lability of FL3P, 
the high affinity of FN3K for FL, and the wide distribution of FN3K suggest that 
the function of this enzyme is deglycation of nonenzymatically glycated 
proteins. Because the condensation of glucose and lysine residues is an 
ubiquitous and unavoidable process in homeothermic organisms, a deglycation 
system mediated by FN3K may be an important factor in protecting cells from the 
deleterious effects of nonenzymatic glycation. Our sequence data of FN3K are in 
excellent agreement with a recent report on this enzyme by Delpierre et al. 
(Diabetes 49:1627-1634, 2000).
