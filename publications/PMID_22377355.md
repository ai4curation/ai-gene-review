Calreticulin is a calcium binding, endoplasmic reticulum resident protein best 
known for its roles in intracellular calcium homeostasis and the quality control 
processes of the endoplasmic reticulum. There is evidence for a range of 
activities for calreticulin outside the endoplasmic reticulum, including in the 
cytosol, on the surface of different cells types and in the extracellular 
matrix. Recent evidence indicates that human pregnancy is a condition of 
elevated circulating calreticulin. Calreticulin was increased in the plasma of 
women throughout pregnancy compared to the non-pregnant state. Calreticulin was 
also further increased during the hypertensive disorder of human pregnancy, 
pre-eclampsia. To clarify the roles of circulating calreticulin in pregnancy and 
pre-eclampsia, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of exogenous 
calreticulin on two cell types that are relevant to normal human pregnancy and 
to pre-eclampsia. Human primary myometrial microvascular endothelial cells 
(UtMVEC-Myo) and the human trophoblast cell line, HTR8/SVneo, were cultured with 
exogenous calreticulin at concentrations (2 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml) comparable to 
that measured in maternal blood. The higher concentration of calreticulin 
significantly increased the migration of the UtMVEC-Myo cells, but significantly 
reduced the migration of the HTR8/SVneo cells. In the presence of only FGF, FBS 
and antibiotics calreticulin at 5 μg/ml significantly reduced the number of 
UtMVEC-Myo cells during in vitro culture for 120 h. These results demonstrate 
that exogenous calreticulin can alter both HTR8/SVneo and UtMVEC-Myo cell 
functions in vitro at a (patho-) physiologically relevant concentration. 
Increased calreticulin may also contribute to altered functions of both cell 
types during pre-eclampsia.
