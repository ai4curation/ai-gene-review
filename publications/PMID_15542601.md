Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) preferentially infects lung epithelial cells. 
Infection by RSV leads to an extended inflammatory response, characterized by 
the release of interleukin-8 (IL-8). Activation of ERK MAP kinase is required 
for both RSV-induced inflammation and the extended survival of infected cells. 
In this study, we analyzed the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) in RSV activation of ERK. We demonstrate for the first time that RSV 
activates EGFR in lung epithelial cells. Activation of EGFR results in increased 
ERK activity, contributing to both the inflammatory response (IL-8 release) and 
prolonging the survival of RSV-infected cells. Inhibition of EGFR with siRNA 
decreased both ERK activation and IL-8 production after RSV. In analyzing the 
effect of EGFR activation on survival of RSV-infected cells, we found that EGFR 
activation by RSV resulted in ERK-dependent alterations in the balance of pro- 
versus anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins. RSV altered the balance between pro- and 
anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins (increased BclxL and decreased BimEL) increasing 
the relative amount of pro-survival proteins. This occurred in an EGFR-dependent 
manner. This study supports an important role for EGFR activity in the lifespan 
and inflammatory potential of RSV-infected epithelial cells.
