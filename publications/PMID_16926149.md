In this work, we determine that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ccr4-Not complex 
controls ubiquitination of the conserved ribosome-associated heterodimeric EGD 
(enhancer of Gal4p DNA binding) complex, which consists of the Egd1p and Egd2p 
subunits in yeast and is named NAC (nascent polypeptide-associated complex) in 
mammals. We show that the EGD complex subunits are ubiquitinated proteins, whose 
ubiquitination status is regulated during cell growth. Egd2p has a UBA domain 
that is not essential for interaction with Egd1p but is required for stability 
of Egd2p and Egd1p. Ubiquitination of Egd1p requires Not4p. Ubiquitination of 
Egd2p also requires Not4p, an intact Not4p RING finger domain, and all other 
subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex tested. In the absence of Not4p, Egd2p 
mislocalizes to punctuate structures. Finally, the EGD complex can be 
ubiquitinated in vitro by Not4p and Ubc4p, one of the E2 enzymes with which 
Not4p can interact. Taken together our results reveal that the EGD 
ribosome-associated complex is ubiquitinated in a regulated manner, and they 
show a new role for the Ccr4-Not complex in this ubiquitination.
