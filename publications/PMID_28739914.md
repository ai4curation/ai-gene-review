Capture of retroviral envelope genes is likely to have played a role in the 
emergence of placental mammals, with evidence for multiple, reiterated, and 
independent capture events occurring in mammals, and be responsible for the 
diversity of present day placental structures. Here, we uncover a full-length 
endogenous retrovirus envelope protein, dubbed HEMO [human endogenous MER34 
(medium-reiteration-frequency-family-34) ORF], with unprecedented 
characteristics, because it is actively shed in the blood circulation in humans 
via specific cleavage of the precursor envelope protein upstream of the 
transmembrane domain. At variance with previously identified retroviral envelope 
genes, its encoding gene is found to be transcribed from a unique CpG-rich 
promoter not related to a retroviral LTR, with sites of expression including the 
placenta as well as other tissues and rather unexpectedly, stem cells as well as 
reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), where the protein can also 
be detected. We provide evidence that the associated retroviral capture event 
most probably occurred >100 Mya before the split of Laurasiatheria and 
Euarchontoglires, with the identified retroviral envelope gene encoding a 
full-length protein in all simians under purifying selection and with similar 
shedding capacity. Finally, a comprehensive screen of the expression of the gene 
discloses high transcript levels in several tumor tissues, such as germ cell, 
breast, and ovarian tumors, with in the latter case, evidence for a histotype 
dependence and specific protein expression in clear-cell carcinoma. Altogether, 
the identified protein could constitute a "stemness marker" of the normal cell 
and a possible target for immunotherapeutic approaches in tumors.
