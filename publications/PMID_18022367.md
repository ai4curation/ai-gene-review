The 25 kDa Mad2 protein is a key player in the spindle assembly checkpoint, a 
safeguard against chromosome segregation errors in mitosis. Mad2 combines three 
unusual properties. First, Mad2 adopts two conformations with distinct 
topologies, open (O) and closed (C) Mad2. Second, C-Mad2 forms topological links 
with its two best-characterized protein ligands, Mad1 and Cdc20. Third, O-Mad2 
and C-Mad2 engage in a "conformational" dimer that is essential for spindle 
checkpoint function in different organisms. The crystal structure of the 
O-Mad2-C-Mad2 conformational dimer, reported here, reveals an asymmetric 
interface that explains the selective dimerization of the O-Mad2 and C-Mad2 
conformers. The structure also identifies several buried hydrophobic residues 
whose rearrangement correlates with the Mad2 topological change. The structure 
of the O-Mad2-C-Mad2 conformational dimer is consistent with a catalytic model 
in which a C-Mad2 template facilitates the binding of O-Mad2 to Cdc20, the 
target of Mad2 in the spindle checkpoint.
