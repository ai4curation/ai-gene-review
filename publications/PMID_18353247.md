Mutations in either HFE or transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) cause decreased 
expression of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin and hemochromatosis. HFE and 
TfR2 were recently discovered to form a stable complex at the cell membrane when 
co-expressed in heterologous cell lines. We analyzed the functional consequences 
of the co-expression of these proteins using transfected TRVb cells, a Chinese 
hamster ovary derived cell line without endogenous HFE or transferrin receptor. 
The co-expression of TfR2 in TRVb cells expressing HFE led to accelerated HFE 
biosynthesis and late-Golgi maturation, suggesting interaction prior to cell 
surface localization. The co-expression of HFE in cells expressing TfR2 led to 
increased affinity for diferric transferrin, increased transferrin-dependent 
iron uptake, and relative resistance to iron chelation. These observations 
indicate that HFE influences the functional properties of TfR2, and suggests a 
model in which the interaction of these proteins might influence signal 
transduction to hepcidin.
