G9a is a SET-domain mammalian histone methyltransferase responsible for mono- 
and dimethylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 (H3K9) at euchromatic regions. 
Recently we reported that G9a forms a stoichiometric heteromeric complex with 
another SET-domain-containing molecule, GLP/Eu-HMTase1. Although G9a and GLP can 
independently methylate H3K9 in vitro, G9a/GLP heteromeric formation seems to be 
essential for their function as a euchromatic H3K9 methyltransferase in vivo. To 
further elucidate how G9a/GLP-mediated histone methylation and transcriptional 
regulation are controlled, we purified and characterized G9a complexes from 
mouse embryonic stem cells. We identified a novel G9a/GLP-associating zinc 
finger molecule named Wiz that can interact with G9a and GLP independently but 
is more stable in the G9a/GLP heteromeric complexes. Interestingly, Wiz small 
inhibitory RNA knocks down not only Wiz but also G9a. GLP deficiency also 
decreases G9a levels, suggesting that the Wiz/G9a/GLP tri-complex may protect 
G9a from degradation and that Wiz plays a major role in G9a/GLP heterodimer 
formation. Furthermore, amino acid sequence analysis of Wiz predicted two 
potential CtBP binding sites, and indeed CtBP binding to Wiz and association of 
CtBP with the Wiz/G9a/GLP complex was observed. These data indicate that Wiz not 
only contributes to the stability of G9a but also links the G9a/GLP heteromeric 
complex to the CtBP co-repressor machinery.
