The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is a member of the ErbB family of 
receptors that also includes ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. These receptors form homo- 
and heterodimers in response to ligand with ErbB2 being the preferred 
dimerization partner. Here we use (125)I-EGF binding to quantitate the 
interaction of the EGF receptor with ErbB2. We show that the EGFR/ErbB2 
heterodimer binds EGF with a 7-fold higher affinity than the EGFR homodimer. 
Because it cannot bind a second ligand, the EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimer is not 
subject to ligand-induced dissociation caused by the negatively cooperative 
binding of EGF to the second site on the EGFR homodimer. This increases the 
stability of the heterodimer relative to the homodimer and is associated with 
enhanced and prolonged EGF receptor autophosphorylation. These effects are 
independent of the kinase activity of ErbB2 but require back-to-back 
dimerization of the EGF receptor with ErbB2. Back-to-back dimerization is also 
required for phosphorylation of ErbB2. These findings provide a molecular 
explanation for the apparent preference of the EGF receptor for dimerizing with 
ErbB2 and suggest that the phosphorylation of ErbB2 occurs largely in the 
context of the EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimer, rather than through lateral 
phosphorylation of isolated ErbB2 subunits.
