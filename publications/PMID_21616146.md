FGFRL1 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family. It plays an 
essential role during branching morphogenesis of the metanephric kidneys, as 
mice with a targeted deletion of the Fgfrl1 gene show severe kidney dysplasia. 
Here we used the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate that FGFRL1 binds with 
its C-terminal, histidine-rich domain to Spred1 and to other proteins of the 
Sprouty/Spred family. Members of this family are known to act as negative 
regulators of the Ras/Raf/Erk signaling pathway. Truncation experiments further 
showed that FGFRL1 interacts with the SPR domain of Spred1, a domain that is 
shared by all members of the Sprouty/Spred family. The interaction could be 
verified by coprecipitation of the interaction partners from solution and by 
codistribution at the cell membrane of COS1 and HEK293 cells. Interestingly, 
Spred1 increased the retention time of FGFRL1 at the plasma membrane where the 
receptor might interact with ligands. FGFRL1 and members of the Sprouty/Spred 
family belong to the FGF synexpression group, which also includes FGF3, FGF8, 
Sef and Isthmin. It is conceivable that FGFRL1, Sef and some Sprouty/Spred 
proteins work in concert to control growth factor signaling during branching 
morphogenesis of the kidneys and other organs.
