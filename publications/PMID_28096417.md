With-no-lysine kinase 4 (WNK4) regulates electrolyte homeostasis and blood 
pressure. WNK4 phosphorylates the kinases SPAK (Ste20-related proline 
alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress responsive kinase), which then 
phosphorylate and activate the renal Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC). WNK4 levels are 
regulated by binding to Kelch-like 3, targeting WNK4 for ubiquitylation and 
degradation. Phosphorylation of Kelch-like 3 by PKC or PKA downstream of AngII 
or vasopressin signaling, respectively, abrogates binding. We tested whether 
these pathways also affect WNK4 phosphorylation and activity. By tandem mass 
spectrometry and use of phosphosite-specific antibodies, we identified five WNK4 
sites (S47, S64, S1169, S1180, S1196) that are phosphorylated downstream of 
AngII signaling in cultured cells and in vitro by PKC and PKA. Phosphorylation 
at S64 and S1196 promoted phosphorylation of the WNK4 kinase T-loop at S332, 
which is required for kinase activation, and increased phosphorylation of SPAK. 
Volume depletion induced phosphorylation of these sites in vivo, predominantly 
in the distal convoluted tubule. Thus, AngII, in addition to increasing WNK4 
levels, also modulates WNK4 kinase activity via phosphorylation of sites outside 
the kinase domain.
