A common feature of tumors arising from diverse tissue types is a reliance on 
aerobic glycolysis for glucose metabolism. This metabolic difference between 
cancer cells and normal cells could be exploited for therapeutic benefit in 
patients. Cancer cells universally express the M2 isoform of the glycolytic 
enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2), and previous work has demonstrated that PKM2 
expression is necessary for aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in vivo. 
Because most normal tissues express an isoform of pyruvate kinase other than 
PKM2, selective targeting of PKM2 provides an opportunity to target cell 
metabolism for cancer therapy. PKM2 has an identical catalytic site as the 
related M1 splice variant (PKM1). However, isoform selective inhibition is 
possible as PKM2 contains a unique region for allosteric regulation. We have 
screened a library of greater than 1,00,000 small molecules to identify such 
inhibitors. The inhibitors identified for PKM2 fell primarily into three 
distinct structural classes. The most potent PKM2 inhibitor resulted in 
decreased glycolysis and increased cell death following loss of growth factor 
signaling. At least part of this effect was due to on-target PKM2 inhibition as 
less cell death was observed in cells engineered to express PKM1. These data 
suggest that isoform selective inhibition of PKM2 with small molecules is 
feasible and support the hypothesis that inhibition of glucose metabolism in 
cancer cells is a viable strategy to treat human malignancy.
