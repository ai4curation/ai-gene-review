The molecular mechanisms underlying protein turnover and enzyme regulation in 
the peroxisomal matrix remain largely unknown. Trypsin domain-containing 1 
(Tysnd1) and peroxisomal Lon protease (PsLon) are newly identified peroxisomal 
matrix proteins that harbor both a serine protease-like domain and a 
peroxisome-targeting signal 1 (PTS1) sequence. Tysnd1 processes several 
PTS1-containing proteins and cleaves N-terminal presequences from 
PTS2-containing protein precursors. Here we report that knockdown of Tysnd1, but 
not PsLon, resulted in accumulation of endogenous β-oxidation enzymes in their 
premature form. The protease activity of Tysnd1 was inactivated by 
intermolecular self-conversion of the 60-kDa form to 15- and 45-kDa chains, 
which were preferentially degraded by PsLon. Peroxisomal β-oxidation of a very 
long fatty acid was significantly decreased by knockdown of Tysnd1 and partially 
lowered by PsLon knockdown. Taken together, these data suggest that Tysnd1 is a 
key regulator of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway via proteolytic processing 
of β-oxidation enzymes. The proteolytic activity of oligomeric Tysnd1 is in turn 
controlled by self-cleavage of Tysnd1 and degradation of Tysnd1 cleavage 
products by PsLon.

Abstract

The molecular mechanisms underlying protein turnover and enzyme regulation in the peroxisomal matrix remain largely unknown. Trypsin domain-containing 1 (Tysnd1) and peroxisomal Lon protease (PsLon) are newly identified peroxisomal matrix proteins that harbor both a serine protease-like domain and a peroxisome-targeting signal 1 (PTS1) sequence. Tysnd1 processes several PTS1-containing proteins and cleaves N-terminal presequences from PTS2-containing protein precursors. Here we report that knockdown of Tysnd1, but not PsLon, resulted in accumulation of endogenous β-oxidation enzymes in their premature form. The protease activity of Tysnd1 was inactivated by intermolecular self-conversion of the 60-kDa form to 15- and 45-kDa chains, which were preferentially degraded by PsLon. Peroxisomal β-oxidation of a very long fatty acid was significantly decreased by knockdown of Tysnd1 and partially lowered by PsLon knockdown. Taken together, these data suggest that Tysnd1 is a key regulator of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway via proteolytic processing of β-oxidation enzymes. The proteolytic activity of oligomeric Tysnd1 is in turn controlled by self-cleavage of Tysnd1 and degradation of Tysnd1 cleavage products by PsLon.

Introduction

The peroxisome is an organelle that plays pivotal roles in various essential metabolic pathways such as β-oxidation of very long fatty acids and synthesis of plasmalogens ( 1 , 2 ). Peroxisomal matrix and membrane proteins are synthesized on cytoplasmic free polyribosomes and imported post-translationally into peroxisomes ( 3 ). For peroxisome matrix proteins, two types of topogenic peroxisome-targeting signals (PTSs) 2 have been defined. PTS1 is a C-terminal tripeptide of the sequence SKL. This sequence and its derivatives are found in most matrix proteins ( 4 , 5 ). PTS2 is an N-terminal cleavable presequence consisting of the nonapeptide sequence (R/K)(L/V/I) X 5 (H/Q)(L/A) and has been identified in several proteins ( 6 , 7 ). Extensive studies over the past two decades have revealed that more than 14 PEX genes and their products, peroxins, are required for peroxisome biogenesis in mammals (for reviews, see Refs. 8 and 9 ). Of these, Pex5p and Pex7p function as cytosolic receptors for PTS1 and PTS2, respectively ( 10 – 13 ). In mammals, two isoforms of Pex5p, Pex5pS and Pex5pL, which contains a 37-aa insertion, have been identified ( 14 , 15 ). Both Pex5p isoforms are essential for PTS1 protein import and function by binding to PTS1 sequences. Pex5pL is also required for PTS2 protein import, forming higher order complexes with Pex7p-PTS2 complexes ( 16 , 17 ).

Fatty acid β-oxidation is one of the essential functions of peroxisomes in organisms from yeast to higher eukaryotes, including humans ( 8 , 18 ). In mammals, although both peroxisomes and mitochondria are responsible for fatty acid β-oxidation, peroxisomal β-oxidation is essential for chain shortening of very long fatty acids (>C 22 ) as evidenced by the loss of this function in individuals with peroxisome biogenesis disorders ( 8 , 18 ). Peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes are peroxisome matrix proteins that harbor PTS1 or PTS2 sequences. Three β-oxidation PTS1 enzymes, acyl-CoA oxidase (AOx) and D-bifunctional protein (DBP)/multifunctional enzyme 2/Hsd17b4 (hereafter termed DBP), which catalyze the oxidation of fatty acyl-CoA and the subsequent sequential hydration and dehydrogenation reactions, respectively ( 19 , 20 ), and sterol carrier protein x (SCPx), which catalyzes the last acetyl-CoA-cleaving step, were recently suggested to undergo proteolytic processing by the peroxisomal PTS1-type protease trypsin domain-containing 1 (Tysnd1) ( 21 ). Tysnd1 also cleaves the PTS2 presequence from peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (TH), which catalyzes the last step of peroxisomal β-oxidation ( 21 ). Another PTS1-type protease in the peroxisomal matrix, peroxisomal Lon protease (PsLon) of the ATP-dependent Lon protease family ( 22 ), has also been identified in rat liver peroxisomes ( 23 ). However, the substrates of PsLon have yet to be defined.

Little is known about the mechanisms underlying homeostasis of peroxisome physiology such as protein turnover and enzyme regulation. In the present work, as a step to gaining insight into such issues, we attempted to address whether Tysnd1 and PsLon are physiologically and mutually relevant in peroxisome physiology, including peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation. Self-cleavage of Tysnd1 negatively regulated the proteolytic activity of Tysnd1 against matrix PTS1 and PTS2 proteins. Knockdown of Tysnd1 resulted in a significant decrease in the processing of several β-oxidation enzymes and the β-oxidation of very long fatty acids. Moreover, PsLon was able to bind to Tysnd1 and preferentially degraded the self-processed forms of Tysnd1. These results support a potential mechanism by which Tysnd1 and PsLon together regulate peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation.

DISCUSSION

Molecular mechanisms underlying peroxisome homeostasis, including protein turnover and enzyme regulation, remain largely unknown. The aim of the present work was to gain insight into such issues. Here, several lines of evidence are presented suggesting that two peroxisomal serine proteases, Tysnd1 and PsLon, coordinately maintain peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation through their protease activity.
