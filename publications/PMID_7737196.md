A 37-kDa protein was immunopurified from human erythrocytes as a complex with a 
monoclonal antibody directed against the Kell blood group protein of 93 kDa. A 
rabbit antibody raised against the purified complex reacted on a Western blot 
with the 93-kDa and 37-kDa proteins and was able to immunoprecipitate the 37-kDa 
component from K0 erythrocytes which express large amount of the Kx antigen, but 
not from erythrocytes of patients suffering from McLeod syndrome, a X-linked 
disorder in which the Kx antigen is lacking. Additional studies have shown that 
the 37-kDa protein is not glycosylated, and permitted the sequence of the 22 
first N-terminal amino acids to be established. This sequence was identical to 
the predicted protein product of the XK gene cloned recently, which is deleted 
or mutated in McLeod patients [Ho, M., Chelly, J., Carter, N., Danek, A., 
Crocker, P. & Monaco, A. P. (1994) Cell 77, 869-880]. Our findings provide 
strong evidence that the 37-kDa red cell membrane protein is identical to the Kx 
protein produced by the XK structural gene and demonstrate that Kx and Kell 
proteins are two subunits expressed as a complex hold by disulfide bond(s) at 
the red cell surface.
