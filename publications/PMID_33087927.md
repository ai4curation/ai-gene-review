Single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful method for 
solving the three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules. The 
technological development of transmission electron microscopes, detectors and 
automated procedures in combination with user-friendly image processing software 
and ever-increasing computational power have made cryo-EM a successful and 
expanding technology over the past decade1. At resolutions better than 4 Å, 
atomic model building starts to become possible, but the direct visualization of 
true atomic positions in protein structure determination requires much higher 
(better than 1.5 Å) resolution, which so far has not been attained by cryo-EM. 
The direct visualization of atom positions is essential for understanding the 
mechanisms of protein-catalysed chemical reactions, and for studying how drugs 
bind to and interfere with the function of proteins2. Here we report a 
1.25 Å-resolution structure of apoferritin obtained by cryo-EM with a newly 
developed electron microscope that provides, to our knowledge, unprecedented 
structural detail. Our apoferritin structure has almost twice the 3D information 
content of the current world record reconstruction (at 1.54 Å resolution3). We 
can visualize individual atoms in a protein, see density for hydrogen atoms and 
image single-atom chemical modifications. Beyond the nominal improvement in 
resolution, we also achieve a substantial improvement in the quality of the 
cryo-EM density map, which is highly relevant for using cryo-EM in 
structure-based drug design.
