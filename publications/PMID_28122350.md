miR-27a regulates cell differentiation in a variety of diseases. However, 
whether and how miR-27a participates in laryngeal cancer cell differentiation 
remains unknown. Therefore, we explored role and molecular mechanism of miR-27a 
in laryngeal cancer differentiation in the study. We found that miR-27a 
expression was inversely correlated with laryngeal cancer differentiation degree 
based on the clinical pathological diagnosis of each patient. miR-27 
asignificantly rescued differentiation and inhibited β-catenin, LEF1, OCT4 and 
SOX2 in Wnt/β-catenin pathway in all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced 
laryngeal cancer cells. Bindings of RARα to miR-27a and miR-27a to GSK-3β were 
confirmed by ChIP and Luciferase reporter assays, respectively. In conclusion, 
miR-27a is a negative regulator in laryngeal cancer differentiation. 
RARα-mediated miR-27a transcriptional inactivation releases the inhibition of 
miR-27a on GSK-3β leading to laryngeal cancer differentiation through 
GSK-3β-involved Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting that miR-27a is a usefully 
therapeutic target at least in ATRA-induced laryngeal cancer differentiation.

INTRODUCTION

Abnormal differentiation is commonly found in cancer [1, 2]. Studies have shown that cancer is initiated and maintained by a subset of cancer cells, ‘the cancer stem cells’, which are able to self-renew and differentiate like normal stem cells presenting cell surface markers [3–5]. Inducement of cancer cell differentiation has become a promising strategy in modern antineoplastic therapy [6]. Thus, study on molecular mechanism of cancer differentiation is still a hotspot at present.

It is well-known that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is a powerful agent commonly used in cancer differentiation study [7–10]. Retinoid-involved signal is often disrupted during carcinogenesis and restoration of the signaling may be a viable option for cancer prevention [11]. Retinoid induces cell differentiation through a lot of signal pathways such as PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. In retinoid-inducing differentiation, GSK-3β coordinates the crosstalk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. ATRA and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) complex inactivate Akt through PI3K/Akt pathway and prevent GSK-3β from phosphorylation by Akt leading to maintenance of GSK-3β activity [12]. GSK-3β then phosphorylates β-catenin and promotes its degradation mediated by ubiquitin in Wnt/β-catenin pathway [13]. As a result, β-catenin cannot enter nuclear to transactivate the differentiation inhibitors such as OCT4 and SOX2 via TCF/LEF [14–16].

In addition, RAR also acts as a transcriptional factor. Studies have shown that RAR regulates transcription of target genes usually together with retinoid X receptor (RXR). For example, GM-CSF/RA-induced RALDH2 transcription in dendritic cells requires binding of cooperative RAR/RXR complex to Sp1 sites of the RALDH2 promoter through p38MAPK-associated pathway [17].

MicroRNA, a 20–23 nt functional RNA molecule, is involved in some biological processes including embryonic development and mammalian cell differentiation [18]. It has been reported that miR-27a is an important differentiation-associated regulator in a variety of diseases [19–21]. However, whether and how miR-27a participates in laryngeal cancer cell differentiation remains unknown.

By prediction, we found that there exists a potential retinoic acid response element (RARE) in the miR-27a promoter whereas GSK-3β is a putative target gene of miR-27a. We wonder miR-27a could regulate differentiation through GSK-3β and RARα-related signaling pathways.

RESULTSmiR-27a expression is negatively associated with differentiation degree in laryngeal cancer tissuesRT-qPCR result demonstrated that miR-27a was up-regulated in 86% (43 of 50) cases of laryngeal cancer (Figure 1A) and miR27a average expression was significantly higher in LSCC tissue (4.131 ± 0.537) than that in adjacent normal tissue (1.4201 ± 0.206) (Figure 1B, P < 0.001), suggesting that miR-27a is involved in laryngeal oncogenesis.Figure 1miR-27a expression in laryngeal cancer by RT-qPCR(A) miR-27a expression in 50 pairs of LSCC tissues by RT-qPCR. The y-axis indicates relative miR-27a expression in cancer tissues and paired normal adjacent tissues.

RT-qPCR and Western blotting results showed that miR-27a mimic significantly increased OCT4 and SOX2 expression both at mRNA and protein levels in Hep2 cells compared to the mock, miR-27a inhibitor and mimic NC, respectively. Conversely, miR-27a mimic significantly reduced Involucrin and Keratin10 expression. However, not all markers showed significant difference between miR-27a inhibitor and inhibitor NC (Figure 2A). These results imply that miR-27a potentially represses laryngeal cancer cell differentiation.Figure 2Role of miR-27a in ATRA-induced laryngeal cancer cell differentiation(A) Expression of stemness/differentiated markers in Hep2 cells transfected by miR-27a. mRNA and protein levels of each gene were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively.

(C) Effect of miR-27a on expression of stemness/differentiated markers in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells. mRNA and protein levels of each gene were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. GAPDH was used for the internal control. Data were indicated as the mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments. *, ** and *** indicate p < 0.05, p < 0.01and p < 0.001, respectively.We then explored effect of miR-27a on differentiation in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, RA concentration at IC50 was approximately 15 μM. Because 5μM RA had relatively low effect on Hep2 cell viability (Supplementary Figure 1) and induced obvious laryngeal cancer cell differentiation (Supplementary Figure 2), 5μM RA was used in the following experiments.Under light microscope, we then found that non-treated Hep2 cells cultured in vitro were shown to have a polygon body with mass nucleocytoplasmic ratio and rapid growth (Figure 2B, left) whereas long shuttle cell bodies, cell marginal shrivel, small nucleocytoplasmic ratio and slow growth were observed in the ATRA-induced Hep2 cells (Figure 2B, middle), which could be blocked by miR-27a introduction (Figure 2B, right). Moreover, significantly lower expression of OCT4 and SOX2 and higher expression of Involucrin and Keratin10 at both mRNA and protein levels were found in Hep2 cells treated with 5 μM RA for 48 h compared to the controls, respectively. Nevertheless, the expression alterations of the four markers could be restored by miR-27a (Figure 2C). These results suggest a suppressive role of miR-27a in ATRA-induced laryngeal cancer cell differentiation.Mir-27a directly targets GSK-3β and increases expression of β-catenin and LEF1 in ATRA-induced Hep2 cellsBased on the bioinformatics analysis using different programs, we found a highly-conserved miR-27a targeting sequence in the GSK-3β 3′-untranslated region (Figure 3A), which suggests that GSK-3β mRNA is a candidate target of miR-27a. Dual luciferase reporter assay result displayed that luciferase activity was significantly reduced in HEK293T and Hep2 cells when GSK-3β 3’UTR wild-type construct was cotransfected with miR-27a mimic compared to the controls (Figure 3B). Western blot and real-time RT-qPCR results showed that miR-27a significantly decreased GSK-3β expression at protein level but not at mRNA level (Figure 3C, left and middle), respectively, implying that miR-27a represses GSK-3β expression from post-transcriptional level. Moreover, ATRA significantly increased the GSK3β gene expression, which was restored by miR-27a (Figure 3C, right). These results indicate that miR-27a directly inhibits GSK-3β in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells.Figure 3Effects of miR-27a on ATRA-induced Hep2 cells by direct targeting to GSK-3β(A) Prediction of miR-27a binding site in the 3′ UTR of GSK-3β among vertebrates. (B) Binding detection of miR-27a to the GSK-3β 3’UTR in HEK293T and Hep2 cells. Luciferase activity of HEK293T and Hep2 cells cotransfected with different constructs was detected. Each value of luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio of firefly to Renilla. (C) Effect of miR-27a on GSK-3β expression in Hep2 cells.

(E) Effects of GSK-3β knockdown on expression of stemness/differentiated markers in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells. (F) Effects of GSK3β knockdown on expression of β-catenin and LEF1 in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells. mRNA and protein levels of each gene above were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. GAPDH was used for the internal control. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments. *, **, *** and ns represent p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and no significance, respectively.Whether GSK-3β is a mediator in miR-27a-regulated differentiation of laryngeal cancer cells induced by ATRA is also a problem. As indicated in Figure 3D, the GSK-3β gene was significantly knocked down at both mRNA and protein levels in laryngeal cancer cells transfected with si-GSK-3β compared to the control, which means the GSK-3β gene is successfully silenced by its small interference RNA. Similar to miR-27a, GSK-3β kockdown significantly altered differentiation-associated markers in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells (Figure 3E). These suggest that miR-27a regulates ATRA-induced Hep2 cell differentiation via down-regulating GSK-3β expression.We also assessed influence of miR-27a in expression of β-catenin and LEF1 in Wnt/β-catenin signal in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells. We found that ATRA significantly decreased β-catenin and LEF1 expression compared to the controls, respectively, and such effects of ATRA were significantly rescued by miR-27a (Figure 3F), indicating that miR-27a increases β-catenin and LEF1 in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells.RARα contributes to transcriptional silence of miR-27a in ATRA-induced laryngeal cancer cell differentiationInterestingly, we found that miR-27a level was significantly lower in ATRA-treated Hep2 cells in a dose-dependent manner compared to the controls (Figure 4A). Therefore, how ATRA downregulates miR-27a expression is the other issue we have to solve in the study.Figure 4Transcriptional inhibition of miR-27a by RARα in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells(A) miR-27a expression in different dosage of ATRA in Hep2 cells. Mature miR-27a was detected using RT-qPCR. U6 snRNA was used for the internal control. (B) Predicted RARα binding site within the miR-27a gene promoter region. (C) ChIP-qPCR analysis of RARα binding to the miR-27a gene promoter region. (D) ChIP-traditional PCR analysis of RARα binding to the miR-27a gene promoter region in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells. DNA immunoprecipitated by anti-RARα antibody from Hep2 cells after treatment with ATRA for 48 h was amplified by PCR to examine abundance of the target sequence. Input DNA and isotope-matched anti-IgG (anti-immunoglobulinG) antibody was used as controls, respectively. (E) Effect of RARα on miR-27a transcription activity by Luciferase Reporter assay. GV148-miR-27a wild/mutant promoters, Renilla luciferase plasmids and si-RARα/NC small RNAs were cotransfected into Hep2 cells, respectively. Data were expressed as the mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments. *, **, *** and ns represent p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and no significance, respectively.It is well-known that RARα is an important receptor of ATRA. According to bioinformatics prediction, we found a potential RARE site in the miR-27a gene promoter region (Figure 4B). By ChIP assay, we obtained a PCR product including RARE site of miR-27a promoter from chromatin fragment precipitated by anti-RARα antibody, which confirms the direct binding of RARα to miR-27a promoter region. Furthermore, RARα exhibited significantly strong binding to RARE located within the miR-27a promoter in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells compared to the controls (Figure 4C and 4D). Luciferase reporter assay result showed that ATRA significantly decreased transcriptional activity of the miR-27a promoter containing RARE compared to the controls and si-RARα significantly rescued the effect (Figure 4E), indicating that ATRA/RARα negatively regulate miR-27a transcriptional activity.Collectively, these results above implied that ATRA promotes RARα binding to miR-27a promoter, leading to miR-27a transcription inhibition.

Mir-27a directly targets GSK-3β and increases expression of β-catenin and LEF1 in ATRA-induced Hep2 cellsBased on the bioinformatics analysis using different programs, we found a highly-conserved miR-27a targeting sequence in the GSK-3β 3′-untranslated region (Figure 3A), which suggests that GSK-3β mRNA is a candidate target of miR-27a. Dual luciferase reporter assay result displayed that luciferase activity was significantly reduced in HEK293T and Hep2 cells when GSK-3β 3’UTR wild-type construct was cotransfected with miR-27a mimic compared to the controls (Figure 3B). Western blot and real-time RT-qPCR results showed that miR-27a significantly decreased GSK-3β expression at protein level but not at mRNA level (Figure 3C, left and middle), respectively, implying that miR-27a represses GSK-3β expression from post-transcriptional level. Moreover, ATRA significantly increased the GSK3β gene expression, which was restored by miR-27a (Figure 3C, right). These results indicate that miR-27a directly inhibits GSK-3β in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells.Figure 3Effects of miR-27a on ATRA-induced Hep2 cells by direct targeting to GSK-3β(A) Prediction of miR-27a binding site in the 3′ UTR of GSK-3β among vertebrates.

Data were expressed as the mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments. *, **, *** and ns represent p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and no significance, respectively.Whether GSK-3β is a mediator in miR-27a-regulated differentiation of laryngeal cancer cells induced by ATRA is also a problem. As indicated in Figure 3D, the GSK-3β gene was significantly knocked down at both mRNA and protein levels in laryngeal cancer cells transfected with si-GSK-3β compared to the control, which means the GSK-3β gene is successfully silenced by its small interference RNA. Similar to miR-27a, GSK-3β kockdown significantly altered differentiation-associated markers in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells (Figure 3E). These suggest that miR-27a regulates ATRA-induced Hep2 cell differentiation via down-regulating GSK-3β expression.We also assessed influence of miR-27a in expression of β-catenin and LEF1 in Wnt/β-catenin signal in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells. We found that ATRA significantly decreased β-catenin and LEF1 expression compared to the controls, respectively, and such effects of ATRA were significantly rescued by miR-27a (Figure 3F), indicating that miR-27a increases β-catenin and LEF1 in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells.

Whether GSK-3β is a mediator in miR-27a-regulated differentiation of laryngeal cancer cells induced by ATRA is also a problem. As indicated in Figure 3D, the GSK-3β gene was significantly knocked down at both mRNA and protein levels in laryngeal cancer cells transfected with si-GSK-3β compared to the control, which means the GSK-3β gene is successfully silenced by its small interference RNA.

These suggest that miR-27a regulates ATRA-induced Hep2 cell differentiation via down-regulating GSK-3β expression.

We also assessed influence of miR-27a in expression of β-catenin and LEF1 in Wnt/β-catenin signal in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells. We found that ATRA significantly decreased β-catenin and LEF1 expression compared to the controls, respectively, and such effects of ATRA were significantly rescued by miR-27a (Figure 3F), indicating that miR-27a increases β-catenin and LEF1 in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells.

RARα contributes to transcriptional silence of miR-27a in ATRA-induced laryngeal cancer cell differentiationInterestingly, we found that miR-27a level was significantly lower in ATRA-treated Hep2 cells in a dose-dependent manner compared to the controls (Figure 4A). Therefore, how ATRA downregulates miR-27a expression is the other issue we have to solve in the study.Figure 4Transcriptional inhibition of miR-27a by RARα in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells(A) miR-27a expression in different dosage of ATRA in Hep2 cells.

According to bioinformatics prediction, we found a potential RARE site in the miR-27a gene promoter region (Figure 4B). By ChIP assay, we obtained a PCR product including RARE site of miR-27a promoter from chromatin fragment precipitated by anti-RARα antibody, which confirms the direct binding of RARα to miR-27a promoter region. Furthermore, RARα exhibited significantly strong binding to RARE located within the miR-27a promoter in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells compared to the controls (Figure 4C and 4D). Luciferase reporter assay result showed that ATRA significantly decreased transcriptional activity of the miR-27a promoter containing RARE compared to the controls and si-RARα significantly rescued the effect (Figure 4E), indicating that ATRA/RARα negatively regulate miR-27a transcriptional activity.Collectively, these results above implied that ATRA promotes RARα binding to miR-27a promoter, leading to miR-27a transcription inhibition.

DISCUSSIONIn recent years, miR-27a has been a new star in differentiation research area. Studies have shown that miR-27a is a critical differentiation regulator in various kinds of cells such as myofibroblast [22], embryonic stem cell (ESC) [23], adipocyte [24], osteoblast [25], myoblast [26], erythroid [27] and breast cancer cells [28]. Except for breast cancer, role of miR-27a in other cancer differentiation is seldom reported. In addition, whether miR-27a affects ATAR-induced differentiation is not reported either.In the study, we found that miR-27a overexpression is negatively associated with differentiation degree in laryngeal cancer tissues and suppresses differentiation of Hep2 cells mediated by ATRA. miR-27a also maintains OCT4 and SOX2 expression and suppresses Involucrin and Keratin10 expression in ATRA-treated and -untreated Hep2 cells. These findings suggest that miR-27a inhibits laryngeal cancer differentiation.Same to our findings, miR-27a represses differentiation in lung fibroblast [22], ESC [23] and adipocyte [24]. However, miR-27a is also found to promote osteoblast [25], myoblast [26], erythroid [27] and breast cancer stem like cell differentiation [28].These indicates that miR-27a has dual effects on differentiation in different kinds of cells via targeting various of genes through different signal pathways. For examples, miR-27a targets α-smooth muscle actin, Smad2 and Smad4 to inhibit lung fibroblast differentiation [22]. miR-27a prevents adipocyte differentiation through direct bind to Pparγ [24]. miR-27a enhances osteoblast differentiation through targeting sFRP1 in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling [25].Studies have shown that ATRA promotes translocation of phosphorylated p38MAPK into nuclear leading to activation of Msk1 whereas phosphorylated Msk1 recruits transcription factors such as RARα to the promoter region of their targets [29, 30]. In the study, we found that RARα directly binds to the miR-27a gene promoter region and decrease its transcription activity in Hep2 cells. We speculate that RARα directly inhibits miR-27a transcription probably via p38MAPK-involved pathway.As indicated in the Introduction, ATRA/RARα maintains GSK-3β activity though PI3K/Akt pathway and promotes differentiation via GSK-3β-involved Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In Wnt/β-catenin pathway, GSK-3β blocks translocation of β-catenin to nuclear to activate differentiation inhibitors such as OCT4 and SOX2 through LEF1 leading to differentiation.In the study, we found that miR-27a itself directly binds to GSK-3β 3′-UTR in both HEK293T and Hep2 cells and inhibits the gene expression in Hep2 cells. Interestingly, ATRA also decreased the expression of miR-27a.Whereas in ATRA-treated Hep2 cells, the RARα, GSK-3β, Involucrin and Keratin10 genes are upregulated and β-catenin, LEF1, OCT4 and SOX2 genes are downregulated. Moreover, the expression alterations of these genes can be reversed by miR-27a in ATRA-induced Hep2 cells, indicating that miR-27a blocks ATRA-induced Hep2 cell differentiation through GSK-3β-mediated Wnt/β-catenin pathway by direct target to GSK-3β.In conclusion, miR-27a plays a suppressive role in laryngeal cancer differentiation. ATRA enhances the suppressive role of RARα on miR-27a promoter and release the inhibition of miR-27a on GSK-3β leading to laryngeal cancer differentiation through GSK-3β-involved Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Figure 5). We believe that miR-27a is a usefully therapeutic target at least in ATRA-induced laryngeal cancer differentiation.Figure 5Schematic illustration of miR-27a in ATRA/RARα and GSK-3β-involved Wnt/β-catenin pathways
