Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is associated with two lymphoproliferative 
disorders, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and Castleman disease. In PEL, Kaposi 
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is present in a latent form expressing only few 
viral genes. Among them is a viral homologue of cellular interferon regulatory 
factors, vIRF-3. To study the role of vIRF-3 in PEL lymphomagenesis, we analyzed 
the interaction of vIRF-3 with cellular proteins. Using yeast two-hybrid screen, 
we detected the association between vIRF-3 and c-Myc suppressor, MM-1alpha. The 
vIRF-3 and MM-1alpha interaction was also demonstrated by glutathione 
S-transferase pulldown assay and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous vIRF-3 and 
MM-1alpha in PEL-derived cell lines. Overexpression of vIRF-3 enhanced the 
c-Myc-dependent transcription of the gene cdk4. Addressing the molecular 
mechanism of the vIRF-3-mediated stimulation, we demonstrated that the 
association between MM-1alpha and c-Myc was inhibited by vIRF-3. Furthermore, 
the recruitment of vIRF-3 to the cdk4 promoter and the elevated levels of the 
histone H3 acetylation suggest the direct involvement of vIRF-3 in the 
activation of c-Myc-mediated transcription. These findings indicate that vIRF-3 
can effectively stimulate c-Myc function in PEL cells and consequently 
contribute to de-regulation of B-cell growth and differentiation.
