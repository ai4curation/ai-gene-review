The transcription of neuron-specific genes must be repressed in nonneuronal 
cells. REST/NRSF is a transcription factor that restricts the expression of many 
neuronal genes through interaction with the neuron-restrictive silencer element 
at the promoter level. PAHX-AP1 is a neuronal gene that is developmentally 
up-regulated in the adult mouse brain but that has no functional NRSE motif in 
its 5' upstream sequence. Here, we report that the transcription factor AP4 and 
the corepressor geminin form a functional complex in which SMRT and histone 
deacetylase 3 are recruited. The functional complex represses PAHX-AP1 
expression in nonneuronal cells and participates in regulating the developmental 
expression of PAHX-AP1 in the brain. This complex also serves as a 
transcriptional repressor of DYRK1A, a candidate gene for Down's syndrome. 
Furthermore, compared with that in normal fetal brain, the expression of AP4 and 
geminin is reduced in Down's syndrome fetal brain at 20 weeks of gestation age, 
at which time premature overexpression of dual-specificity 
tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is observed. Our 
findings indicate that AP4 and geminin act as a previously undescribed repressor 
complex distinct from REST/NRSF to negatively regulate the expression of target 
genes in nonneuronal cells and suggest that the AP4-geminin complex may 
contribute to suppressing the precocious expression of target genes in fetal 
brain.
