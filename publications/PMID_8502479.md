We describe the identification of the ERG-2 gene products using an antibody 
raised against recombinant human ERG-2 protein. ERG-2 is a nuclear 
phosphoprotein and binds to purine-rich sequences (C/G)(C/a)GG-AA(G/a)T. ERG-2 
protein, with a half-life of 21 h, is considerably more stable than the 
short-lived ETS-1 or ETS-2 proteins. Its phosphorylation is stimulated by 
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), but not by Ca2+ ionophore treatment. ETS-1 
protein is phosphorylated by Ca(2+)-dependent events, whereas ERG-2 protein is 
phosphorylated by activation of protein kinase C, suggesting their involvement 
in distinct signal transduction mechanisms. The expression of ERG-2 protein is 
restricted to few cell types and is high in early myeloid cells, indicating that 
it may function at an early stage of hematopoietic lineage determination. The 
DNA-binding sequence for ERG-2 protein is identified by using a random 
oligonucleotide selection procedure. The selected sequence is very similar to 
the binding sequence determined for human ETS-1 using the same method. Like 
other ets proteins, ERG-2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein and is 
expressed at higher levels in early myeloid cells than in mature lymphoid cells. 
These results suggest that it may act as a regulator of genes required for 
maintenance and/or differentiation of early hematopoietic cells.
