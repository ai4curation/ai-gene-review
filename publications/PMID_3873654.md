Analysis of cDNA clones specific for human T cells and the alpha and beta chains 
of the T-cell receptor heterodimer from a human T-cell line.

We report the isolation and characterization of 19 classes of nonrearranging T 
cell-specific cDNA clones and two cDNA clones encoding the alpha and beta chains 
of the T-cell antigen receptor from a human T-cell line, Jurkat. Results 
indicate that the human alpha-chain gene, like its beta-chain counterpart, 
undergoes somatic rearrangement in T cells. In addition, it shows sequence 
homology to its beta-chain counterpart and immunoglobulin, indicating that the 
human alpha chain is also a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family. 
Sequence comparison suggests that the alpha chain also may be composed of 
variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J), and constant (C) region gene segments. 
The protein deduced from the cDNA sequence has a molecular weight of 29,995 and 
possesses six potential N-glycosylation sites. The availability of alpha- and 
beta-chain genes of the T-cell receptor from the same T-cell line provides tools 
to study their possible roles in recognition of antigens and major 
histocompatibility complex products by the human T-cell receptor.
