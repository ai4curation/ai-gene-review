BAD is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that is regulated by 
phosphorylation in response to survival factors. Although much attention has 
been devoted to the identification of phosphorylation sites in murine BAD, 
little data are available with respect to phosphorylation of human BAD protein. 
Using mass spectrometry, we identified here besides the established 
phosphorylation sites at serines 75, 99, and 118 several novel in vivo 
phosphorylation sites within human BAD (serines 25, 32/34, 97, and 124). 
Furthermore, we investigated the quantitative contribution of BAD targeting 
kinases in phosphorylating serine residues 75, 99, and 118. Our results indicate 
that RAF kinases represent, besides protein kinase A, PAK, and Akt/protein 
kinase B, in vivo BAD-phosphorylating kinases. RAF-induced phosphorylation of 
BAD was reduced to control levels using the RAF inhibitor BAY 43-9006. This 
phosphorylation was not prevented by MEK inhibitors. Consistently, expression of 
constitutively active RAF suppressed apoptosis induced by BAD and the inhibition 
of colony formation caused by BAD could be prevented by RAF. In addition, using 
the surface plasmon resonance technique, we analyzed the direct consequences of 
BAD phosphorylation by RAF with respect to association with 14-3-3 and 
Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L) proteins. Phosphorylation of BAD by active RAF promotes 14-3-3 
protein association, in which the phosphoserine 99 represented the major binding 
site. Finally, we show here that BAD forms channels in planar bilayer membranes 
in vitro. This pore-forming capacity was dependent on phosphorylation status and 
interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Collectively, our findings provide new 
insights into the regulation of BAD function by phosphorylation.
