Intracellular factors are involved in and essential for hematopoiesis. HIV-1 
Tat-interacting protein of 110 kDa (TIP110; p110(nrb)/SART3/p110) is an 
RNA-binding nuclear protein implicated in the regulation of HIV-1 gene and host 
gene transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, and cancer immunology. In the present 
study, we demonstrate a role for TIP110 in the regulation of hematopoiesis. 
TIP110 was expressed in human CD34(+) cells and decreased with differentiation 
of CD34(+) cells. TIP110 mRNA was also expressed in phenotyped mouse marrow 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Using 
TIP110 transgenic (TIP110(TG)) and haploinsufficient (TIP110(+/-)) mice, we 
found that increased TIP110 expression enhanced HPC numbers, survival, and cell 
cycling, whereas decreased TIP110 expression had the opposite effects. Moreover, 
TIP110(+/-) bone marrow HPCs responded more effectively, and TIP110(TG) HPCs 
less effectively, than those of wild-type control mice to recovery from the 
cell-cycle-active drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Unexplained sex differences were 
noted in HSC competitive repopulating ability, but not HPC numbers, in 
TIP110(TG) mice. Intracellularly, TIP110 regulated CMYC and GATA2 expression at 
the transcriptional level, and TIP110 and CMYC reciprocally regulated the

Abstract

Intracellular factors are involved in and essential for hematopoiesis. HIV-1 Tat -interacting protein of 110 kDa ( TIP110 ; p110 nrb / SART3/p110 ) is an RNA-binding nuclear protein implicated in the regulation of HIV-1 gene and host gene transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, and cancer immunology. In the present study, we demonstrate a role for TIP110 in the regulation of hematopoiesis. TIP110 was expressed in human CD34 + cells and decreased with differentiation of CD34 + cells. TIP110 mRNA was also expressed in phenotyped mouse marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Using TIP110 transgenic ( TIP110 TG ) and haploinsufficient ( TIP110 +/− ) mice, we found that increased TIP110 expression enhanced HPC numbers, survival, and cell cycling, whereas decreased TIP110 expression had the opposite effects. Moreover, TIP110 +/− bone marrow HPCs responded more effectively, and TIP110 TG HPCs less effectively, than those of wild-type control mice to recovery from the cell-cycle–active drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Unexplained sex differences were noted in HSC competitive repopulating ability, but not HPC numbers, in TIP110 TG mice. Intracellularly, TIP110 regulated CMYC and GATA2 expression at the transcriptional level, and TIP110 and CMYC reciprocally regulated the expression of each other. These results demonstrate a role for TIP110 in the regulation of hematopoiesis, effects that are likely linked to TIP110 regulation of CMYC .

Introduction

Hematopoiesis is regulated at the level of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) via intracellular and extracellular molecules. 1 – 3 Homeostasis is crucial for normal hematopoiesis. 2 Cell cycling of HSCs/HPCs is regulated by growth factors/cytokines, as well as by transcription factors such as C-MYB, CMYC, GATA2, HOX family proteins, and BMI-1. C-MYB promotes HSC growth through induced CMYC. 4 – 6 CMYC induces the expression of positive regulators involved in G1/S cell-cycle transition, and also represses negative regulators of the cell cycle, events required for the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. 7 CMYC is involved in cell proliferation and growth, angiogenesis, apoptosis, differentiation, and regulation of chromatin structure, 8 – 11 and plays a role in controlling self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs. 12

Tat-interacting protein of 110 kDa (TIP110), which was initially cloned from a human KG-1 myeloid cell line cDNA library, 13 is implicated in RNA metabolism and tumor-antigen presentation. 14 – 17 We demonstrated previously that TIP110 regulates the transcription of HIV-1 and cellular genes. 18 , 19 It is considered a mammalian homolog of the yeast Prp24 protein, and functions as a general pre-mRNA splicing factor. 20 Using molecular, cellular, and genetic strategies, including TIP110 transgenic ( TIP110 TG ) and conditional knockout ( TIP110 +/− ) mice, ectopic expression, and shRNA knockdown, we found that TIP110 regulates HPC/HSC function, effects likely involving cell-cycle regulation, reciprocal control of the expression of TIP110 and CMYC , and GATA2 control of TIP110 expression.

Discussion

We defined a role for TIP110 , which is expressed at very low levels in terminal cells or tissues and at higher levels in tumor cells, 18 in regulating the proliferation of HPCs. These effects were cell-cycle related and involved CMYC and GATA-2. The opposite outcomes of TIP110 TG and TIP110 +/− regarding absolute numbers and cell-cycle status of HPCs demonstrated that TIP110 is an essential gene regulating hematopoiesis. Cell-cycle–regulatory effects of TIP110 expression were confirmed by recovery patterns of HSCs and HPCs of TIP110 +/− compared with WT bone marrow cells. More effective recovery of TIP110 +/− bone marrow HPCs in response to 5-FU administration likely reflects, at least in part, the slower cycling status of TIP110 +/− HPCs. The reasons for the striking gender-specific effects of TIP110 overexpression on longer-term HSC engraftment remain to be determined. We did not detect differences with regard to gender in the numbers or proliferation of HPCs.

Quiescence is critical in preventing erosion of HSC numbers, and may limit propagation of accumulated DNA damage. 5 , 35 , 36 Mechanisms involved in immature hematopoietic cell exit into the cell cycle are not completely clear. Our data indicate that TIP110 , CMYC , and GATA2 are expressed at very low levels when CD34 + cord blood cells are first isolated. Expression levels are up-regulated rapidly when CD34 + cells are cultured in vitro with a combination of cytokines, including stem cell factor, FLT3 ligand, and thrombopoietin. Our results suggest that TIP110 expression is strictly correlated with HPC proliferation. When CD34 + cells exogenously express TIP110 , the expression of CMYC and GATA2 is up-regulated. This CMYC and GATA2 up-regulated expression by TIP110 happens regardless of the presence or absence of SFT, suggesting that TIP110 positively regulates CMYC and GATA2 expression. Enforced TIP110 expression in quiescent CD34 + cord blood cells decreased apoptosis in the absence of growth factors and enhanced the numbers of cells entering into cycle, suggesting that TIP110 levels may be important factors regulating hematopoiesis through triggering CD34 + from a quiescent to a cycling state.

To explore how TIP110 activates the CMYC gene, we built a CMYC and TIP110 promoter and used a promoter reporter gene assay system. TIP110 activates CMYC through its promoter; CMYC also could activate TIP110 through the TIP110 promoter. Identity of CMYC as a TIP110 target gene strongly supports a means by which TIP110 functions in hematopoiesis. CMYC is a critical transcription factor that regulates hematopoiesis, and its deficiency severely impairs definitive hematopoiesis. 37 CMYC −/− HSCs/progenitors are unable to expand in number and differentiate to generate a significant number of differentiated progeny. 38 We now demonstrate that TIP110 and CMYC reciprocally regulate each other at the promoter level, thus forming a self-regulating feedback system. Overexpression or reduced expression of TIP110 causes changes in CMYC expression that modulate hematopoiesis. TIP110 also regulates GATA2 expression. GATA2 is a member of the GATA transcription factor family, crucial regulators of hematopoiesis. 39 , 40 GATA2 is expressed in HSCs and certain HPCs, and uniquely promotes the proliferation, survival, and function of these cells. 32 – 34 To determine whether and how TIP110 and GATA2 regulate each other, we built a GATA2 promoter and used a TIP110 promoter reporter gene assay. GATA2 activates TIP110 through its promoter, whereas TIP110 activation of GATA2 is not through its promoter, suggesting that the effects of TIP110 on hematopoiesis may also involve TIP110 regulation of GATA2 . Overexpression or reduced expression of TIP110 causes changes in CMYC and GATA2 expression that may co-modulate hematopoiesis.

In conclusion, TIP110 is a newly identified essential gene expressed in the earliest cells of adult bone marrow hematopoietic development. TIP110 regulates hematopoiesis, HSCs, and HPCs, as well as CMYC and GATA2 expression. Whereas the relationship of TIP110 to CMYC and cell-cycle regulation of HPCs seems clear, more work is necessary to determine the role(s) of TIP110 and GATA2 in the regulation and homeostasis of HPCs and hematopoiesis.
