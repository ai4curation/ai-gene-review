Mutations of NPHS1 or NPHS2, the genes encoding for the glomerular podocyte 
proteins nephrin and podocin, cause steroid-resistant proteinuria. In addition, 
mice lacking NEPH1 develop a nephrotic syndrome that resembles NPHS mutations, 
suggesting that all three proteins are essential for the integrity of glomerular 
podocytes. Podocin interacts with the C-terminal domain of nephrin and 
facilitates nephrin-dependent signaling. NEPH1, a member of the immunoglobulin 
superfamily, is structurally related to nephrin. We report now that NEPH1 
belongs to a family of three closely related proteins that interact with the 
C-terminal domain of podocin. All three NEPH proteins share a conserved 
podocin-binding motif; mutation of a centrally located tyrosine residue 
dramatically lowers the affinity of NEPH1 for podocin. NEPH1 triggers AP-1 
activation similarly to nephrin but requires the presence of Tec family kinases 
for efficient transactivation. We conclude that NEPH1 defines a new family of 
podocin-binding molecules that are potential candidates for hereditary nephrotic 
syndromes not linked to either NPHS1 or NPHS2.
