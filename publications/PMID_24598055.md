Mutations in the Trex1 are associated with a spectrum of type I IFN-dependent 
autoimmune diseases. Trex1 plays an essential role in preventing accumulation of 
excessive cytoplasmic DNA, avoiding cell-intrinsic innate DNA sensor activation 
and suppressing activation of type I IFN-stimulated and -independent antiviral 
genes. Trex1 also helps HIV to escape cytoplasmic detection by DNA sensors. 
However, regulation of Trex1 in innate immune cells remains elusive. We report 
that murine cDCs have high constitutive expression of Trex1 in vitro and in vivo 
in the spleen. In resting bone marrow-derived cDCs, type I IFNs up-regulate 
Trex1 expression via the IFNAR-mediated signaling pathway (STAT1- and 
STAT2-dependent). DC activation induced by TLR3, -4, -7, and -9 ligands also 
augments Trex1 expression through autocrine IFN-β production and triggering of 
the IFN signaling pathway, whereas TLR4 ligand LPS also stimulates an early 
expression of Trex1 through IFN-independent NF-κB-dependent signaling pathway. 
Furthermore, retroviral infection also induces Trex1 up-regulation in cDCs, as 
we found that a gene therapy HIV-1-based lentiviral vector induces significant 
Trex1 expression, suggesting that Trex1 may affect local and systemic 
administration of gene-therapy vehicles. Our data indicate that Trex1 is induced 
in cDCs during activation upon IFN and TLR stimulation through the canonical IFN 
signaling pathway and suggest that Trex1 may play a role in DC activation during 
infection and autoimmunity. Finally, these results suggest that HIV-like viruses 
may up-regulate Trex1 to increase their ability to escape immunosurveillance.
