High mobility group box (HMGB) 1 and 2 are two abundant nonhistone nuclear 
proteins that have been found in association with chromatin. Previous studies 
based on immunofluorescence analysis indicated that HMGB1 dissociates from 
chromosomes during mitosis. In the present work, HMGB1 and 2 subcellular 
localization was reinvestigated in living cells by using enhanced green 
fluorescent protein- and Discosome sp. red fluorescent protein-tagged proteins. 
Contrary to previous reports, HMGB1 and 2 were shown to be present under two 
forms in mitotic cells, i.e., free and associated with the condensed chromatin, 
which rapidly exchange. A detailed analysis of HMGB2 interaction with mitotic 
chromosomes indicated that two sites encompassing HMG-box A and B are 
responsible for binding. Importantly, this interaction was rapidly inactivated 
when cells were permeabilized or exposed to chemical fixatives that are widely 
used in immunodetection techniques. A comparable behavior was also observed for 
two proteins of the HMG-nucleosome binding (HMGN) group, namely, HMGN1 and 
HMGN2.
