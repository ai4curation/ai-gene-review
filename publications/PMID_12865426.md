Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, which justifies the 
increasing interest in mapping the different components of these organelles. 
Here we have focused our study on the identification of proteins of the 
mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM). This membrane is of particular interest 
because, besides the well known components of the respiratory chain complexes, 
it contains several ion channels and many carrier proteins that certainly play a 
key role in mitochondrial function and, therefore, deserve to be identified at 
the molecular level. To achieve this goal we have used a novel approach 
combining the use of highly purified mouse liver mitochondrial inner membranes, 
extraction of membrane proteins with organic acid, and two-dimensional liquid 
chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This procedure allowed us to 
identify 182 proteins that are involved in several biochemical processes, such 
as the electron transport machinery, the protein import machinery, protein 
synthesis, lipid metabolism, and ion or substrate transport. The full range of 
isoelectric point (3.9-12.5), molecular mass (6-527 kDa), and hydrophobicity 
values (up to 16 transmembrane predicted domains) were represented. In addition, 
of the 182 proteins found, 20 were unknown or had never previously been 
associated with the MIM. Overexpression of some of these proteins in mammalian 
cells confirmed their mitochondrial localization and resulted in severe 
remodeling of the mitochondrial network. This study provides the first proteome 
of the MIM and provides a basis for a more detailed study of the newly 
characterized proteins of this membrane.
