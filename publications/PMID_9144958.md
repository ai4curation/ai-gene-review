We have isolated the gene for a protein designated CCA1. This protein can bind 
to a region of the promoter of an Arabidopsis light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b 
protein gene, Lhcb1*3, which is necessary for its regulation by phytochrome. The 
CCA1 protein interacted with two imperfect repeats in the Lhcb1*3 promoter, 
AAA/cAATCT, a sequence that is conserved in Lhcb genes. A region near the N 
terminus of CCA1, which has some homology to the repeated sequence found in the 
DNA binding domain of Myb proteins, is required for binding to the Lhcb1*3 
promoter. Lines of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing antisense RNA for 
CCA1 showed reduced phytochrome induction of the endogenous Lhcb1*3 gene, 
whereas expression of another phytochrome-regulated gene, rbcS-1A, which encodes 
the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, was not 
affected. Thus, the CCA1 protein acts as a specific activator of Lhcb1*3 
transcription in response to brief red illumination. The expression of CCA1 RNA 
was itself transiently increased when etiolated seedlings were transferred to 
light. We conclude that the CCA1 protein is a key element in the functioning of 
the phytochrome signal transduction pathway leading to increased transcription 
of this Lhcb gene in Arabidopsis.

We have isolated the gene for a protein designated CCA1. This protein can bind to a region of the promoter of an Arabidopsis light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein gene, Lhcb1*3, which is necessary for its regulation by phytochrome. The CCA1 protein interacted with two imperfect repeats in the Lhcb1*3 promoter, AAA/cAATCT, a sequence that is conserved in Lhcb genes. A region near the N terminus of CCA1, which has some homology to the repeated sequence found in the DNA binding domain of Myb proteins, is required for binding to the Lhcb1*3 promoter. Lines of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing antisense RNA for CCA1 showed reduced phytochrome induction of the endogenous Lhcb1*3 gene, whereas expression of another phytochrome-regulated gene, rbcS-1A, which encodes the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, was not affected. Thus, the CCA1 protein acts as a specific activator of Lhcb1*3 transcription in response to brief red illumination. The expression of CCA1 RNA was itself transiently increased when etiolated seedlings were transferred to light. We conclude that the CCA1 protein is a key element in the functioning of the phytochrome signal transduction pathway leading to increased transcription of this Lhcb gene in Arabidopsis.
