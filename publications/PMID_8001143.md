The brain mesoaccumbens dopamine system is intricately involved in the 
psychomotor stimulant activities of cocaine. However, the extent to which 
different dopamine receptors mediate these effects has not yet been firmly 
established. The present study used dopamine D1 receptor mutant mice produced by 
gene targeting to investigate the role of this receptor in the effects induced 
by cocaine. In contrast with wild-type mice, which showed a dose-dependent 
increase in locomotion, D1 mutant mice exhibited a dose-dependent decrease. 
Electrophysiological studies of dopamine-sensitive nucleus accumbens neurons 
demonstrated a marked reduction in the inhibitory effects of cocaine on the 
generation of action potentials. In addition, the inhibitory effects of dopamine 
as well as D1 and D2 agonists were almost completely abolished, whereas those of 
serotonin were unaffected. D2-like dopamine receptor binding was also normal. 
These results demonstrate the essential role of the D1 receptor in the locomotor 
stimulant effects of cocaine and in dopamine-mediated neurophysiological effects 
within the nucleus accumbens.
