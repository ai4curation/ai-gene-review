Angiostatin binds to endothelial cell (EC) surface F(1)-F(0) ATP synthase, 
leading to inhibition of EC migration and proliferation during tumor 
angiogenesis. This has led to a search for angiostatin mimetics specific for 
this enzyme. A naturally occurring protein that binds to the F1 subunit of ATP 
synthase and blocks ATP hydrolysis in mitochondria is inhibitor of F1 (IF1). The 
present study explores the effect of IF1 on cell surface ATP synthase. IF1 
protein bound to purified F(1) ATP synthase and inhibited F(1)-dependent ATP 
hydrolysis consistent with its reported activity in studies of mitochondria. 
Although exogenous IF1 did not inhibit ATP production on the surface of EC, it 
did conserve ATP on the cell surface, particularly at low extracellular pH. IF1 
inhibited ATP hydrolysis but not ATP synthesis, in contrast to angiostatin, 
which inhibited both. In cell-based assays used to model angiogenesis in vitro, 
IF1 did not inhibit EC differentiation to form tubes and only slightly inhibited 
cell proliferation compared with angiostatin. From these data, we conclude that 
inhibition of ATP synthesis is necessary for an anti-angiogenic outcome in 
cell-based assays. We propose that IF1 is not an angiostatin mimetic, but it can 
serve a protective role for EC in the tumor microenvironment. This protection 
may be overridden in a concentration-dependent manner by angiostatin. In support 
of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that angiostatin blocks IF1 binding to ATP 
synthase and abolishes its ability to conserve ATP. These data suggest that 
there is a relationship between the binding sites of IF1 and angiostatin on ATP 
synthase and that IF1 could be employed to modulate angiogenesis.
