The dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB)/C-repeat binding 
factor (CBF) family are the classical transcriptional regulators involved in 
plant responses to drought, salt and cold stress. Recently it was demonstrated 
that DREB2A is induced by heat stress (hs) and is a regulator of the hs response 
of Arabidopsis. Here we provide molecular insights into the regulation and 
function of hs transcription factor HsfA3. Among the 21 members of the 
Arabidopsis Hsf family, HsfA3 is the only Hsf that is transcriptionally induced 
during hs by DREB2A, and HsfA3 in turn regulates the expression of Hsp-encoding 
genes. This transcription factor cascade was reconstructed in transient GUS 
reporter assays in mesophyll protoplasts by showing that DREB2A could activate 
the HsfA3 promoter, whereas HsfA3 in turn was shown to be a potent activator on 
the promoters of Hsp genes. Direct binding to the corresponding promoters was 
demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and the involvement of 
HsfA3 in the hs response in vivo was shown directly by observation of reduced 
thermotolerance in HsfA3 mutant lines. Altogether these data demonstrate that 
HsfA3 is transcriptionally controlled by DREB2A and important for the 
establishment of thermotolerance.
