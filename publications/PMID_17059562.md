It has been proposed that in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP), 
a ubiquitin ligase (E3) Parkin, which is involved in endoplasmic 
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), lacks E3 activity. The resulting 
accumulation of Parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like receptor (Pael-R), a 
substrate of Parkin, leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, causing neuronal 
death. We previously reported that human E3 HRD1 in the endoplasmic reticulum 
protects against endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. This study 
shows that HRD1 was expressed in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) 
dopaminergic neurons and interacted with Pael-R through the HRD1 proline-rich 
region, promoting the ubiquitylation and degradation of Pael-R. Furthermore, the 
disruption of endogenous HRD1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) induced Pael-R 
accumulation and caspase-3 activation. We also found that ATF6 overexpression, 
which induced HRD1, accelerated and caused Pael-R degradation; the suppression 
of HRD1 expression by siRNA partially prevents this degradation. These results 
suggest that in addition to Parkin, HRD1 is also involved in the degradation of 
Pael-R.
