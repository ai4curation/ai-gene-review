The homo-oligomeric Hip protein cooperates with the 70-kDa heat shock cognate 
Hsc70 in the folding of newly synthesized polypeptide chains and in the 
conformational regulation of signaling molecules known to interact with Hsc70 
and Hsp90. In order to further assess the role of Hip during protein biogenesis, 
a structure-function analysis of the Hip protein was initiated. By employing the 
yeast two-hybrid system, the Hsc70-binding site of Hip was mapped to a domain 
comprising multiple tetratricopeptide repeats and flanking charged 
alpha-helices. Affinity chromatography confirmed direct interaction of isolated 
Hip fragments and protein fusions bearing this region with the ATPase domain of 
Hsc70 in an ATP- and salt-dependent manner. Contact of Hip with the ATPase 
domain appears to be mediated primarily by the positively charged alpha-helix 
following the tetratricopeptide repeats. Furthermore, a domain required for 
homo-oligomerization was identified at the extreme amino terminus of Hip.
