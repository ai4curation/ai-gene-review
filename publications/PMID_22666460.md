Partial inactivation of the Ankyrin repeat domain 26 (Ankrd26) gene causes 
obesity and diabetes in mice and increases spontaneous and induced adipogenesis 
in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, it is not yet known how the Ankrd26 
protein carries out its biological functions. We identified by yeast two-hybrid 
and immunoprecipitation assays the triple functional domain protein (TRIO), the 
G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2), the delta-interacting protein A (DIPA) 
and the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) as ANKRD26 interacting 
partners. Adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells was increased by selective 
down-regulation of Ankrd26, Trio, Gps2, Hmmr and Dipa. Furthermore, GPS2 and 
DIPA, which are normally located in the nucleus, were translocated to the 
cytoplasm, when the C-terminus of ANKRD26 was introduced into these cells. These 
findings provide biochemical evidence that ANKRD26, TRIO, GPS2 and HMMR are 
novel and important regulators of adipogenesis and identify new targets for the 
modulation of adipogenesis.
