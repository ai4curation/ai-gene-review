Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) are associated with 
an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 participates in the 
cellular DNA damage response. We report the identification of 
receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) as a BRCA1-interacting protein in humans. 
RAP80 contains a tandem ubiquitin-interacting motif domain, which is required 
for its binding with ubiquitin in vitro and its damage-induced foci formation in 
vivo. Moreover, RAP80 specifically recruits BRCA1 to DNA damage sites and 
functions with BRCA1 in G2/M checkpoint control. Together, these results suggest 
the existence of a ubiquitination-dependent signaling pathway involved in the 
DNA damage response.
