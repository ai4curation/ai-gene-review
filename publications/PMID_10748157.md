PTEN/MMAC is a phosphatase that is mutated in multiple human tumors. PTEN/MMAC 
dephosphorylates 3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol phosphates that activate 
AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) kinase activity. AKT/PKB is implicated in the 
inhibition of apoptosis, and cell lines and tumors with mutated PTEN/MMAC show 
increased AKT/PKB kinase activity and resistance to apoptosis. PTEN/MMAC 
contains a PDZ domain-binding site, and we show here that the phosphatase binds 
to a PDZ domain of membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted 
orientation (MAGI) 3, a novel inverted membrane-associated guanylate kinase that 
localizes to epithelial cell tight junctions. Importantly, MAGI3 and PTEN/MMAC 
cooperate to modulate the kinase activity of AKT/PKB. These data suggest that 
MAGI3 allows for the juxtaposition of PTEN/MMAC to phospholipid signaling 
pathways involved with cell survival.
