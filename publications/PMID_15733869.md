To maintain homeostasis, cells often respond to stressful extra-cellular stimuli 
by new gene expression. Serum/glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK) is an 
immediate early gene whose expression is induced by a variety of extra-cellular 
stimuli. Here, we examine the possibility that SGK can directly phosphorylate 
the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB). In 
a cell-free context, SGK physically associates with CREB and SGK phosphorylates 
it on serine 133. Phospho-serine 133 is essential for stimulating the 
transcriptional activity of CREB. Further, we show that in a variety of cellular 
contexts, SGK phosphorylates CREB. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinase 
pathways or the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) lead to SGK-dependent 
CREB phosphorylation. Hormonal stimulation of epithelial cells leads to the 
induction of endogenous SGK and CREB phosphorylation. A dominant-negative form 
of SGK blocks dexamethasone-induced CREB phosphorylation. Our studies indicate 
that stimulation of SGK can lead to CREB phosphorylation, suggesting that 
CREB-dependent gene transcription is an important link between stressful 
extra-cellular signals and cellular responses.
