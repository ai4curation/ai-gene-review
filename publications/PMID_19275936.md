The extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) is an 85 kDa secreted glycoprotein, 
comprising four variants and playing a pivotal role in endochondral bone 
formation, angiogenesis, and tumour biology. A computational model for the 
three-dimensional structure of ECM1a was determined to identify the potential 
and/or concealed region(s) for binding with candidate partners in human skin. 
Multiple alignments for the secondary structure of ECM1a and b revealed 
similarity with serum albumin. The N-terminal domain of ECM1a consists mainly of 
alpha-helices (alphaD1), while the remaining three domains, namely serum albumin 
subdomain-like (SASDL) domains 2-4, were topologically comparable with the 
subdomain of the third serum albumin domain. Yeast-two-hybrid screening of a 
human foreskin cDNA library using both full-length ECM1a and the hot spot region 
for ECM1 gene mutations in lipoid proteinosis, an autosomal recessive 
genodermatosis (complete SASDL2 and the linker to SASDL3: aa177-aa361), as bait, 
isolated seven extracellular proteins. The site-specific interaction of ECM1a 
with two of these candidate binders, laminin 332 beta-3 chain and fibulin-3, was 
confirmed by in vitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 
Immunohistologically both binders co-localized with ECM1 in human skin. 
Together, ECM1 is a multifunctional binding core and/or a scaffolding protein 
interacting with a variety of extracellular and structural proteins, 
contributing to the maintenance of skin integrity and homeostasis. Hence, 
disruption of the ECM1 function may cause the failure of multi-communication 
among the surrounding skin interstitial molecules, as seen in lipoid proteinosis 
pathology.
