Morphogenesis of sensory hair cells, in particular their mechanotransduction 
organelle, the stereociliary bundle, requires highly organized remodeling of the 
actin cytoskeleton. The roles of Rho family small GTPases during this process 
remain unknown. Here we show that deletion of Rac1 in the otic epithelium 
resulted in severe defects in cochlear epithelial morphogenesis. The mutant 
cochlea was severely shortened with a reduced number of auditory hair cells and 
cellular organization of the auditory sensory epithelium was abnormal. Rac1 
mutant hair cells also displayed defects in planar cell polarity and 
morphogenesis of the stereociliary bundle, including bundle fragmentation or 
deformation, and mispositioning or absence of the kinocilium. We further 
demonstrate that a Rac-PAK (p21-activated kinase) signaling pathway mediates 
kinocilium-stereocilia interactions and is required for cohesion of the 
stereociliary bundle. Together, these results reveal a critical function of Rac1 
in morphogenesis of the auditory sensory epithelium and stereociliary bundle.

Introduction

In the mammalian inner ear, mechanosensory hair cells located within a specialized sensory epithelium in the cochlea, the organ of Corti (OC), are responsible for sound detection. These hair cells are interdigitated with nonsensory support cells, and each contain on their apical surface a V-shaped stereociliary bundle (or hair bundle) with intrinsic structural polarity: the actin-based stereocilia are organized into rows of graded heights, forming a staircase-like pattern. Furthermore, auditory hair bundles are uniformly oriented across the OC, with the V pointing toward the outer (lateral) border of the cochlear duct. These features are essential for the correct perception of sound and are established by an intricate gene network during development ( Frolenkov et al., 2004 ; Petit and Richardson, 2009 ).

In the mouse, hair bundle development and maturation proceed in two perpendicular gradients, from the base to the apex and from the medial to lateral side of the cochlea over a period from late embryogenesis to the first two postnatal weeks ( Frolenkov et al., 2004 ; Petit and Richardson, 2009 ). During the initial phase, a single tubulin-based kinocilium, derived from the primary cilium, migrates from the center to the lateral edge of the hair cell apex. Concomitant with this migration, microvilli around the kinocilium elongate to form stereocilia of graded heights. By the end of embryogenesis, nascent hair bundles exhibit a crescent shape with the kinocilium centered next to the tallest stereocilia. Next, during the first postnatal week, stereocilia undergo further row-specific, differential outgrowth, eventually forming a hair bundle with a staircase organization. Finally, the kinocilium retracts around postnatal day 10.

Tremendous progress has been made toward understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hair bundle morphogenesis. In particular, genetic analysis and cloning of deafness mutations in humans and mice have identified a number of structural and regulatory proteins of the actin cytoskeleton ( El-Amraoui and Petit, 2005 ; Leibovici et al., 2008 ; Petit and Richardson, 2009 ). In addition, a Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, with both evolutionarily conserved (such as the Frizzled and Dishevelled proteins) and novel (such as Scrb1 and PTK7) components, plays an important role in regulating cochlear elongation and hair bundle orientation ( Rida and Chen, 2009 ).

Despite the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in hair cell morphogenesis, the roles of Rho GTPases, central regulators of actin dynamics, in this process remain poorly understood. Rho family members, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, have been shown to influence cell migration, cell–cell adhesion, microtubule dynamics, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene transcription ( Jaffe and Hall, 2005 ). Thus, Rho GTPases could potentially regulate many aspects of cochlear epithelial morphogenesis.

In this study, we show that the small GTPase Rac1 plays a critical role in the morphogenesis of the OC and the auditory hair bundles. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Rac1 regulates interactions between the kinocilium and stereocilia via p21-activated kinase (PAK), which is required for the cohesion of the developing hair bundle. These results establish Rac1 as a key regulator of auditory hair cell morphogenesis.

Discussion

Many of the deafness genes implicated in hair bundle morphogenesis were originally identified through genetic analysis of hearing-impaired individuals or mouse mutants ( Friedman et al., 2007 ; Leibovici et al., 2008 ). These genetic studies have provided great insights into the mechanisms underlying normal hair cell development and function, as well as the pathophysiology of deafness and balance disorders. However, the function of essential genes in hair cell development, such as ubiquitous or global regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, is still poorly understood due to the early lethality associated with loss-of-function mutations in these genes. Our results in this study demonstrate a requirement of Rac1, a central regulator of actin dynamics, in cochlear morphogenesis and hair bundle formation, and shed new light on the exquisite genetic control of hair bundle morphogenesis.

The pleiotropic effects of Rac1 deletion indicate that Rac1 participates in multiple developmental pathways to coordinate cochlear epithelial morphogenesis. Rac1 mutants have a severely shortened cochlea with a reduced number of hair cells and support cells, consistent with an early function of Rac1 in specification of the OC precursor cells, which awaits further studies. Rac1 deletion also had a deleterious effect on cell–cell interactions in the OC, with abnormalities in cell shape, spacing, and arrangement. Although we did not detect gross changes in the distribution of adherens junction components, subtle defects in cell–cell adhesion and/or cell contractility may account for these phenotypes.

Rac1 is also necessary for normal PCP signaling. Rac1 mutants exhibited misoriented hair bundles similar to mouse PCP mutants. We found that the activity of PAK proteins, downstream effectors of Rac, is asymmetrically localized according to the PCP axis and is likely spatially regulated by PCP signaling during bundle orientation. However, we were unable to reliably examine the role of PAK in bundle orientation in vitro , as wild-type cochlear explants grown on artificial substrates often have slight orientation defects (data not shown). We also found that asymmetric localization of Fz3 was disrupted in Rac1 mutants, which is likely a secondary effect of epithelial/cytoskeletal disorganization. There are precedents for a role of the cytoskeleton in PCP regulation ( Blair et al., 2006 ; Shimada et al., 2006 ; Yan et al., 2009 ). Together, these results support both a direct role of Rac1 as a downstream effector of the PCP pathway and perhaps an indirect role in regulating Fz3 localization via the cytoskeleton. The multiple functions of Rac1 in regulating PCP in the inner ear parallels those of Rho1 in Drosophila , where Rho1 acts both downstream and upstream of the core PCP genes ( Yan et al., 2009 ). Our results provide further evidence that Rac GTPases are required for PCP signaling in vertebrates ( Habas et al., 2003 ). This stands in contrast to Drosophila , where Rac genes appear to have very minor, if any, function in PCP regulation ( Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2002 ; Muñoz-Descalzo et al., 2007 ). We speculate that, like other vertebrate-specific PCP regulators, the Rac genes are co-opted by the core PCP pathway to effect complex cytoskeletal remodeling during vertebrate tissue morphogenesis.

Rac1 function is essential for hair bundle morphogenesis. The split bundle phenotype, where stereocilia form separate clumps on the hair cell apex, resembles the phenotypes of mice mutant for Usher syndrome type I (USH1) genes, which encode myosin VIIa, harmonin, sans, cadherin 23, and protocadherin 15 ( Lefèvre et al., 2008 ). USH1 is characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and blindness caused by retinitis pigmentosa. Interestingly, Dock4, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1 ( Lu et al., 2005 ), has recently been shown to localize to hair cell stereocilia, where it binds to harmonin ( Yan et al., 2006 ). We observed no changes in myosin VIIa and harmonin localization in Rac1 mutants (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material; and data not shown), suggesting that Rac1 is not required for the localization of USH1 proteins. Although the function of Dock4 in hair bundle formation is not known, it is tempting to speculate that USH1 proteins act upstream to regulate Rac1 activity via Dock4 during bundle morphogenesis.

Flat bundles were also frequently observed in Rac1 mutants at E18.5, where the kinocilium had an abnormal off-center position. This phenotype suggests that Rac1 regulates interactions between the kinocilium and stereocilia in the developing hair bundle. There is increasing evidence for the role of the kinocilium and its associated basal bodies as the “hair bundle organizing center” to instruct the intrinsic structural polarity of the hair bundle. Indeed, it has been reported that mouse mutants for genes implicated in human ciliopathy, such as the Bardet–Biedl syndrome, have “flattened” bundles with mispositioned kinocilium ( Ross et al., 2005 ). Furthermore, genetic ablation of the kinocilium in the mouse leads to formation of hair bundles with a flattened morphology ( Jones et al., 2008 ; C. Sipe and X. Lu, unpublished results). Because Rac1 mutant explants had a predominant split bundle phenotype at the equivalent of P3, we infer that flat bundles proceed to become fragmented. Thus, our results highlight the requirement of kinocilium–stereocilium interaction for maintenance of hair bundle integrity.

Despite bundle fragmentation, in Rac1 mutant explants we still observed formation of the bundle staircase and relatively normal FM1-43 uptake. These results argue that developmental pathways that regulate distinct aspects of hair bundle morphogenesis, such as hair bundle cohesion, differential elongation of the stereocilia, and acquisition of the mechanotransduction apparatus, operate independently of one another. Consistent with this idea, FM1-43 uptake occurs normally in the Snell's waltzer myosin VI mutant mouse, which displays severe bundle structural defects ( Self et al., 1999 ). Likewise, mechanotransduction is normal in myosin XVa mutants with abnormally short stereocilia ( Stepanyan et al., 2006 ). Nevertheless, disruption of any of the aforementioned aspects of bundle morphogenesis will disable hearing.

We identified PAK kinases as important downstream effectors of Rac1 during auditory hair bundle morphogenesis. Rac1 deletion appeared to reduce, rather than abolish pPAK staining. Together with the fact that some but not all Rac1 mutant hair cells displayed hair bundle defects, it suggests that other small GTPases may function redundantly with Rac1 to activate PAK signaling during bundle morphogenesis. Indeed, we found by RT-PCR analysis that, in addition to Rac1, Rac3 and the closely related Cdc42 were also expressed in the developing cochlea (supplemental Fig. 1 A , available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material; and data not shown). Furthermore, to determine whether Rac1 has a similar function in vestibular hair cells, we examined Rac1 mutant utricles and observed essentially normal bundle morphology, FM1-43 uptake, and mechanotransduction currents (data not shown). We suspect that functional redundancy is also in play in utricular hair cells.

How may PAK activity control bundle morphogenesis? We showed that pPAK staining was enriched on the lateral membranes, and in a region adjacent to the base of the bundle and the kinocilium insertion site, where it partially overlapped with microtubules. In explant assays, when PAK activity was inhibited by low-dose IPA-3, we observed flat bundles with off-center kinocilium, whereas higher doses of IPA-3 resulted in fragmentation of the bundle. Based on the staining pattern and the inhibitor experiments, we favor a model where PAK regulates the kinocilium–stereocilia interaction via microtubule-based mechanisms thereby maintaining hair bundle cohesion. Future identification of molecular targets of PAK will reveal the underlying mechanisms by which Rac–PAK signaling regulates hair bundle morphogenesis.
