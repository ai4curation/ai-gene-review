The native opioid growth factor (OGF), [Met(5)]-enkephalin, is a tonic 
inhibitory peptide that modulates cell proliferation and tissue organization 
during development, cancer, cellular renewal, wound healing, and angiogenesis. 
OGF action is mediated by a receptor mechanism. We have cloned and sequenced 
cDNAs encoding multiple spliced forms of a human OGF receptor. The open reading 
frame in the longest cDNA was found to encode a protein of 697 amino acids, and 
8 imperfect repeats of 20 amino acids each were a prominent feature. Altogether, 
five alternatively spliced forms were observed. The cDNA hybridized to mRNA from 
a variety of normal and neoplastic cells and tissues. Functional studies using 
antisense oligonucleotides to OGFr demonstrated an enhancement in cell growth. 
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments showed the chromosomal 
location to be 20q13.3. This OGF receptor has no homology to classical opioid 
receptors. These results provide molecular validity for the interaction of OGF 
and OGF receptor in the regulation of growth processes in humans.
