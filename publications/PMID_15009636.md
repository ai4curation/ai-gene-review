Glutamate uptake by high affinity glutamate transporters is essential for 
preventing excitotoxicity and maintaining normal synaptic function. We have 
discovered a novel role for presenilin-1 (PS1) as a regulator of glutamate 
transport. PS1-deficient neurons showed a decrease in glutamate uptake of 
approximately 50% compared to wild-type neurons. Gamma-secretase inhibitor 
treatment mimicked the effects of PS1 deficiency on glutamate uptake. PS1 
loss-of-function, accomplished by PS1 deficiency or gamma-secretase inhibitor 
treatment, caused a corresponding decrease in cell surface expression of the 
neuronal glutamate transporter, EAAC1. PS1 deficiency is known to reduce 
intracellular calcium stores. To explore the possibility that PS1 influences 
glutamate uptake via regulation of intracellular calcium stores, we examined the 
effects of treating neurons with caffeine, thapsigargin, and SKF-96365. These 
compounds depleted intracellular calcium stores by distinct means. Nonetheless, 
each treatment mimicked PS1 loss-of-function by impairing glutamate uptake and 
reducing EAAC1 expression at the cell surface. Blockade of voltage-gated calcium 
channels, activation and inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), and protein 
kinase A (PKA) all had no effect on glutamate uptake in neurons. Taken together, 
these findings indicate that PS1 and intracellular calcium stores may play a 
significant role in regulating glutamate uptake and therefore may be important 
in limiting glutamate toxicity in the brain.
