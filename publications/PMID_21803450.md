Here we employed human SHEP neuroblastoma cells either stably or inducibly 
expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) to 
investigate its ability to modulate stress-induced cell death. Analysis of 
effector caspase activation revealed that AICD overexpression was specifically 
associated with an increased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by the 2 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors thapsigargin and tunicamycin, but not by 
staurosporine (STS). Basal and ER stress-induced expression of Bip/Grp78 and 
C/EBP-homologous protein/GADD153 were not altered by AICD implying that AICD 
potentiated cell death downstream or independent of the conserved unfolded 
protein response (UPR). Interestingly, quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
analysis and reporter gene assays revealed that AICD significantly downregulated 
messenger RNA levels of the Alzheimer's disease susceptibility gene 
ApoJ/clusterin, indicating transcriptional repression. Knockdown of 
ApoJ/clusterin mimicked the effect of AICD on ER stress-induced apoptosis, but 
had no discernible effect on staurosporine-induced cell death. Our data suggest 
that altered levels of AICD may abolish the prosurvival function of 
ApoJ/clusterin and increase the susceptibility of neurons to ER stress-mediated 
cell death, a pathway that may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease.
