Interleukin-23 (IL-23), an IL-12 family cytokine, plays pivotal roles in 
pro-inflammatory T helper 17 cell responses linked to autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases. Despite intense therapeutic targeting, structural and 
mechanistic insights into receptor complexes mediated by IL-23, and by IL-12 
family members in general, have remained elusive. We determined a crystal 
structure of human IL-23 in complex with its cognate receptor, IL-23R, and 
revealed that IL-23R bound to IL-23 exclusively via its N-terminal 
immunoglobulin domain. The structural and functional hotspot of this interaction 
partially restructured the helical IL-23p19 subunit of IL-23 and restrained its 
IL-12p40 subunit to cooperatively bind the shared receptor IL-12Rβ1 with high 
affinity. Together with structural insights from the interaction of IL-23 with 
the inhibitory antibody briakinumab and by leveraging additional IL-23:antibody 
complexes, we propose a mechanistic paradigm for IL-23 and IL-12 whereby cognate 
receptor binding to the helical cytokine subunits primes recruitment of the 
shared receptors via the IL-12p40 subunit.
