SAMHD1 is a cellular enzyme that depletes intracellular deoxynucleoside 
triphosphates (dNTPs) and inhibits the ability of retroviruses, notably HIV-1, 
to infect myeloid cells. Although SAMHD1 is expressed in both cycling and 
noncycling cells, the antiviral activity of SAMHD1 is limited to noncycling 
cells. We determined that SAMHD1 is phosphorylated on residue T592 in cycling 
cells but that this phosphorylation is lost when cells are in a noncycling 
state. Reverse genetic experiments revealed that SAMHD1 phosphorylated on 
residue T592 is unable to block retroviral infection, but this modification does 
not affect the ability of SAMHD1 to decrease cellular dNTP levels. SAMHD1 
contains a target motif for cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1) ((592)TPQK(595)), 
and cdk1 activity is required for SAMHD1 phosphorylation. Collectively, these 
findings indicate that phosphorylation modulates the ability of SAMHD1 to block 
retroviral infection without affecting its ability to decrease cellular dNTP 
levels.
