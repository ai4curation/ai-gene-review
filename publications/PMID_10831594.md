We identified the multifunctional chaperon protein p32 as a protein kinase C 
(PKC)-binding protein interacting with PKCalpha, PKCzeta, PKCdelta, and PKC mu. 
We have analyzed the interaction of PKC mu with p32 in detail, and we show here 
in vivo association of PKC mu, as revealed from yeast two-hybrid analysis, 
precipitation assays using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and 
reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation. In SKW 6.4 cells, PKC mu is constitutively 
associated with p32 at mitochondrial membranes, evident from colocalization with 
cytochrome c. p32 interacts with PKC mu in a compartment-specific manner, as it 
can be coimmunoprecipitated mainly from the particulate and not from the soluble 
fraction, despite the presence of p32 in both fractions. Although p32 binds to 
the kinase domain of PKC mu, it does not serve as a substrate. Interestingly, 
PKC mu-p32 immunocomplexes precipitated from the particulate fraction of two 
distinct cell lines, SKW 6.4 and 293T, show no detectable substrate 
phosphorylation. In support of a kinase regulatory function of p32, addition of 
p32 to in vitro kinase assays blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, aldolase but 
not autophosphorylation of PKC mu, suggesting a steric hindrance of substrate 
within the kinase domain. Together, these findings identify p32 as a novel, 
compartment-specific regulator of PKC mu kinase activity.
