NUT carcinomas are genetically defined epithelial neoplasms. Most tumors harbor 
fusions of NUTM1 with BRD4 or BRD3. Their histopathologic features have been 
predominantly reported as undifferentiated or poorly differentiated squamous 
cell carcinoma, and clinically they tend to be aggressive cancers. However, 
recent studies have revealed a broader spectrum of NUTM1-rearranged neoplasms 
with several new fusion partners and associated variable histopathologic 
phenotypes and clinical behaviors, including benign and malignant cutaneous 
poroid tumors. We report herein a primary invasive carcinoma of skin adnexal 
origin with a previously undescribed fusion between BRD3 and NUTM2B. The tumor 
occurred on the shoulder of a 7-year-old girl and was excised with negative 
margins. A sentinel lymph node was positive. After follow-up of 23 months, and 
without systemic treatment, the child remains free of tumor. This case expands 
the spectrum of NUT carcinomas by including a skin adnexal variant with 
follicular infundibular differentiation, a novel genomic aberration, and 
preliminary evidence of a less aggressive clinical course.

Abstract

NUT carcinomas are genetically defined epithelial neoplasms. Most tumors harbor fusions of NUTM1 with BRD4 or BRD3. Their histologic features have been predominantly reported as undifferentiated or poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and clinically they tend to be aggressive cancers. However, recent studies have revealed a broader spectrum of NUTM1 -rearranged neoplasms with several new fusion partners and associated variable histopathologic phenotypes and clinical behaviors, including benign and malignant cutaneous poroid tumors. We report herein a primary invasive carcinoma of skin adnexal origin with a previously undescribed fusion between BRD3 and NUTM2B . The tumor occurred on the shoulder of a seven-year-old girl and was excised with negative margins. A sentinel lymph node was positive. After follow-up of 23 months, and without systemic treatment, the child remains free of tumor. This case expands the spectrum of NUT carcinomas by including a skin adnexal variant with follicular infundibular differentiation, a novel genomic aberration and preliminary evidence of a less aggressive clinical course.

Introduction

Nuclear protein of the testis (NUT) carcinomas are genetically defined tumors characterized by NUT gene rearrangement 1 – 6 . Their pathology has been described in the literature predominantly as poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma 5 , 7 – 12 . Clinically, NUT carcinomas (NC) preferentially affect young adults with a median age of 16–22 years, but they can occur at any age 5 , 13 , 14 . The majority of NC is associated with an aggressive clinical course, with a median overall survival ranging from 6.7 to 9.7 months 13 – 17 .

The diagnosis of NC is based on cytogenetic and/or molecular test results documenting rearrangement of the NUTM1 gene located on chromosome 15 1 – 6 . The fusion partner of most classic cases of NC is BRD4 on chromosome 19. In a third of cases of NC the fusion partner is BRD3 on chromosome 9. Rare additional fusion partners have been detected 18 – 24 . Immunohistochemistry for NUTM1 can be used as a surrogate for NUTM1 rearrangement 25 .

Recent studies have shown that NUTM1 can have a wider range of fusion partners and associated histopathologic phenotypes than previously thought 26 – 33 . These observations include the association of YAP1-NUTM1 fusions in cutaneous poroid neoplasms 26 – 32 .

We present herein a novel carcinoma with a related albeit different gene fusion – a primary skin adnexal neoplasm with follicular differentiation harboring a BRD3-NUTM2B fusion. We propose to term this novel entity BRD2-NUTM2B adnexal carcinoma (“BNAC”).

Materials and Methods

The case report was completed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and institutional IRB requirements. The findings reported herein are based on the medical record. Informed written consent was obtained from the child’s parents.

Discussion

We report herein a novel type of primary dermal adnexal carcinoma that carries a previously unreported fusion between BRD3 and NUTBM2 . It differs clinically and histopathologically from “classic” NC. The latter is associated with NUTM1 fusions and typically reported as undifferentiated or poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma 5 , 7 – 12 .

In recent years, new NUTM1 fusion partners were found in a diverse group of neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukemias, sarcomas, poroma and porocarcinomas 26 – 33 . Recent RNA sequencing studies of NUT-positive poroid hidradenomas and poroid hidradenocarcinomas revealed that most of the tumors harbor YAP1-NUTM1 fusions; in one case a novel EMC7-NUTM1 fusion was detected 30 .

The case reported herein differs from both NC as well as porocarcinoma. In contrast to NC, the tumor is better differentiated. Most tumor cells had at least scant amounts of pink cytoplasm. Focal clear cell changes were seen. Multiple keratocystic structures with follicular infundibular differentiation were present. Throughout the entire lesion the tumor cells had relatively low-grade cytologic features. Mitotic figures were rare. No necrosis was seen. No perineural or lymphovascular invasion was identified. While the microscopic findings support the diagnosis of a skin adnexal carcinoma, the features of the tumor do not fit neatly into an existing entity of cutaneous adnexal carcinomas. The lack of any connection to the epidermis, presence of keratocystic follicular infundibular differentiation, the exclusive presence of follicular infundibular features in the lymph node metastasis and the relatively low grade cytology argue against a variant of porocarcinoma.

Nonetheless, given the presence of some poroid features and the fact that sweat gland neoplasms can display some follicular differentiation, the tumor reported herein may be a variant of a sweat gland carcinoma with mixed follicular and sweat gland differentiation. For the time being the precise lineage of the BRD2-NUTM2B adnexal carcinoma (“BNAC”) described herein remains to be determined. It will be easier to assess the line of differentiation once additional cases have been identified and studied immunohistochemically. Given the presence of follicular infundibular differentiation we considered a variant of a follicular infundibular carcinoma. However, there are notable differences. Previously reported cases occurred in middle-aged to elderly men 37 . Aggregates of invasive tumor cells were described as connected to the epidermis or a follicle; no keratocysts were reported 37 . While the BRD3-NUTM2B fusion carcinoma may fall into the spectrum of infundibular carcinomas, since we have only one case, and nothing has been reported so far about the genetics of infundibular carcinomas, further research on additional cases of BRD3-NUTM2B fusion and infundibular carcinomas is needed to determine a possible relationship.

Given the presence of keratocystic structures, one may also consider an unusual variant of microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) in the differential diagnosis. While MACs share low grade cytologic features, they differ from the current tumor microscopically and genetically. They typically display syringomatous and/or ductal differentiation and tend to be associated with a range of genetic aberrations not seen in our case 38 , 39 .

Regarding classic NCs, most carry a reciprocal translocation between the NUTM1 gene on chromosome 15q14 and the BET protein family encoding gene BRD4 on 19p13.1 5 , 6 . In the remaining NCs, NUTM1 is fused to a gene other than BRD4 , most often BRD3 and NSD3 . Rare additional fusion partners have been identified, including ZNF532, ZNF592, MXD4, BCORL1, MXD1 , and MGA 18 – 23 .

The tumor reported herein has a novel, previously unreported fusion, one between BRD3 and NUTM2B . The absence of other genomic aberrations and lack of any mutation suggests that the BRD3-NUTM2B fusion is the major pathogenetic driver of the tumor. The NUTM2B gene is located on chromosome 10q22.3. Fusions involving NUTM2B have previously been reported with the fusion partner YWHAE in clear cell sarcoma of the kidney and endometrial stromal sarcoma 40 , 41 . BRD3 is a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) protein family and plays a role in transcriptional regulation 42 . Its gene maps to 9q34. BRD3-NUTM1 driven cancers are histopathologically indistinguishable from BRD4-NUTM1 carcinomas. The mechanism by which the BRD3-NUTM2B fusion leads to a different tumor phenotype and biology compared to BRD3-NUTM1 remains to be determined. Additional cases with this fusion and functional studies are needed to assess the role of the BRD3-NUTM2B fusion in tumor development.

Carcinomas with NUTM1 fusions are generally aggressive. In a recent study median overall survival was only 4.7 months, but a single patient who received treatment was in remission for more than 12 years 43 . Treatment options include chemo- and radiation therapy, but they are rarely effective 5 . Novel targeted therapeutic strategies are being explored 44 .

Since in our case the tumor was well differentiated, relatively small, confined to the dermis, with a novel gene fusion that did not involve NUTM1 , and excised with a wide margin, we reasoned that in spite of a positive SLN the clinical course would likely be less aggressive than for a classic NC. The subsequent clinical course with no recurrence in 23 months has supported this expectation.

In conclusion, we report herein a novel primary dermal adnexal carcinoma with a BRD3-NUTM2B fusion. It is characterized histopathologically by keratocystic follicular infundibular differentiation, and clinically by a less aggressive clinical course. The BRD3-NUTM2B fusion adnexal carcinoma is likely a rare entity, but it may be underrecognized. We hope that our report will facilitate the recognition of additional cases leading to a better understanding of this entity, and help avoid overtreatment. When an adnexal carcinoma displaying features similar as those reported herein is found, consideration should be given to further molecular analysis to search for a possible gene fusion.
