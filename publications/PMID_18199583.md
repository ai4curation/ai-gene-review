The endothelin (Edn) system comprises three ligands (Edn1, Edn2 and Edn3) and 
their G-protein-coupled type A (Ednra) and type B (Ednrb) receptors. During 
embryogenesis, the Edn1/Ednra signaling is thought to regulate the dorsoventral 
axis patterning of pharyngeal arches via Dlx5/Dlx6 upregulation. To further 
clarify the underlying mechanism, we have established mice in which gene 
cassettes can be efficiently knocked-in into the Ednra locus using 
recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) based on the Cre-lox system. The 
first homologous recombination introducing mutant lox-flanked Neo resulted in 
homeotic transformation of the lower jaw to an upper jaw, as expected. 
Subsequent RMCE-mediated knock-in of lacZ targeted its expression to the 
cranial/cardiac neural crest derivatives as well as in mesoderm-derived head 
mesenchyme. Knock-in of Ednra cDNA resulted in a complete rescue of craniofacial 
defects of Ednra-null mutants. By contrast, Ednrb cDNA could not rescue them 
except for the most distal pharyngeal structures. At early stages, the 
expression of Dlx5, Dlx6 and their downstream genes was downregulated and 
apoptotic cells distributed distally in the mandible of Ednrb-knock-in embryos. 
These results, together with similarity in craniofacial defects between 
Ednrb-knock-in mice and neural-crest-specific Galpha(q)/Galpha(11)-deficient 
mice, indicate that the dorsoventral axis patterning of pharyngeal arches is 
regulated by the Ednra-selective, G(q)/G(11)-dependent signaling, while the 
formation of the distal pharyngeal region is under the control of a 
G(q)/G(11)-independent signaling, which can be substituted by Ednrb. This 
RMCE-mediated knock-in system can serve as a useful tool for studies on gene 
functions in craniofacial development.
