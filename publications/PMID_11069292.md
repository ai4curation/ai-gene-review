The signaling pathways by which the phytochrome (phy) family of photoreceptors 
transmits sensory information to light-regulated genes remain to be fully 
defined. Evidence for a relatively direct pathway has been provided by the 
binding of one member of the family, phyB, to a promoter-element-bound, basic 
helix-loop-helix protein, PIF3, specifically upon light-induced conversion of 
the photoreceptor molecule to its biologically active conformer (Pfr). Here, we 
show that phyA also binds selectively and reversibly to PIF3 upon 
photoconversion to Pfr, but that the apparent affinity of PIF3 for phyA is 
10-fold lower than for phyB. This result is consistent with previous in vivo 
data from PIF3-deficient Arabidopsis, indicating that PIF3 has a major role in 
phyB signaling, but a more minor role in phyA signaling. We also show that phyB 
binds stoichiometrically to PIF3 at an equimolar ratio, suggesting that the 
resultant complex is the unit active in transcriptional regulation at target 
promoters. Deletion mapping suggests that a 37-aa segment present at the N 
terminus of phyB, but absent from phyA, contributes strongly to the high binding 
affinity of phyB for PIF3. Conversely, deletion mapping and point mutation 
analysis of PIF3 for determinants involved in recognition of phyB indicates that 
the PAS domain of PIF3 is a major contributor to this interaction, but that a 
second determinant in the C-terminal domain is also necessary.
