Phosphorylated interferon-alpha receptor 1 subunit (IFNaR1) acts as a docking 
site for the latent form of the 113 kDa STAT2 protein.

Interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of its 
receptors, two JAK kinases and three STAT transcription factors. One kinase, 
p135tyk2, is complexed with the IFNaR1 receptor, and may catalyze some of these 
phosphorylation events. We demonstrate that, in vitro, p135tyk2 phosphorylates 
two tyrosines on IFNaR1. A phosphopeptide corresponding to the major 
phosphorylation site (Tyr466) binds STAT2, but not STAT1, in an SH-2-dependent 
manner. Furthermore, only latent, non-phosphorylated STAT2 interacts with this 
phosphopeptide. When this phosphopeptide is introduced into permeabilized cells, 
the IFN alpha-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of both STATs is blocked. 
Finally, mutant versions of IFNaR1, in which Tyr466 is changed to phenylalanine, 
can act in a dominant negative manner to inhibit phosphorylation of STAT2. These 
observations are consistent with a model in which IFNaR1 mediates the 
interaction between JAK kinases and the STAT transcription factors.
