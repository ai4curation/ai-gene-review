Using RNAi screening, proteomics, cell biological and mouse genetics approaches, 
we have identified a complex of nine proteins, seven of which are disrupted in 
human ciliopathies. A transmembrane component, TMEM231, localizes to the basal 
body before and independently of intraflagellar transport in a Septin 2 
(Sept2)-regulated fashion. The localizations of TMEM231, B9D1 (B9 
domain-containing protein 1) and CC2D2A (coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing 
protein 2A) at the transition zone are dependent on one another and on Sept2. 
Disruption of the complex in vitro causes a reduction in cilia formation and a 
loss of signalling receptors from the remaining cilia. Mouse knockouts of B9D1 
and TMEM231 have identical defects in Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling and 
ciliogenesis. Strikingly, disruption of the complex increases the rate of 
diffusion into the ciliary membrane and the amount of plasma-membrane protein in 
the cilia. The complex that we have described is essential for normal cilia 
function and acts as a diffusion barrier to maintain the cilia membrane as a 
compartmentalized signalling organelle.
