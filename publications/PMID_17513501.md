Analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana defense response to the damping-off oomycete 
pathogen Pythium irregulare show that resistance to P. irregulare requires a 
multicomponent defense strategy. Penetration represents a first layer, as 
indicated by the susceptibility of pen2 mutants, followed by recognition, likely 
mediated by ERECTA receptor-like kinases. Subsequent signaling of inducible 
defenses is predominantly mediated by jasmonic acid (JA), with insensitive coi1 
mutants showing extreme susceptibility. In contrast with the generally accepted 
roles of ethylene and salicylic acid cooperating with or antagonizing, 
respectively, JA in the activation of defenses against necrotrophs, both are 
required to prevent disease progression, although much less so than JA. 
Meta-analysis of transcriptome profiles confirmed the predominant role of JA in 
activation of P. irregulare-induced defenses and uncovered abscisic acid (ABA) 
as an important regulator of defense gene expression. Analysis of cis-regulatory 
sequences also revealed an unexpected overrepresentation of ABA response 
elements in promoters of P. irregulare-responsive genes. Subsequent infections 
of ABA-related and callose-deficient mutants confirmed the importance of ABA in 
defense, acting partly through an undescribed mechanism. The results support a 
model for ABA affecting JA biosynthesis in the activation of defenses against 
this oomycete.

Abstract

Analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana defense response to the damping-off oomycete pathogen Pythium irregulare show that resistance to P. irregulare requires a multicomponent defense strategy. Penetration represents a first layer, as indicated by the susceptibility of pen2 mutants, followed by recognition, likely mediated by ERECTA receptor-like kinases. Subsequent signaling of inducible defenses is predominantly mediated by jasmonic acid (JA), with insensitive coi1 mutants showing extreme susceptibility. In contrast with the generally accepted roles of ethylene and salicylic acid cooperating with or antagonizing, respectively, JA in the activation of defenses against necrotrophs, both are required to prevent disease progression, although much less so than JA. Meta-analysis of transcriptome profiles confirmed the predominant role of JA in activation of P. irregulare –induced defenses and uncovered abscisic acid (ABA) as an important regulator of defense gene expression. Analysis of cis- regulatory sequences also revealed an unexpected overrepresentation of ABA response elements in promoters of P. irregulare –responsive genes. Subsequent infections of ABA-related and callose-deficient mutants confirmed the importance of ABA in defense, acting partly through an undescribed mechanism. The results support a model for ABA affecting JA biosynthesis in the activation of defenses against this oomycete.

INTRODUCTION

The success of plants in colonizing so many different environments where they have to cope with a plethora of biotic and abiotic challenges indicates that evolution has provided them with efficient defense mechanisms. Plants possess both preformed and inducible layers of defense to resist pathogen invasion. Constitutive physical and chemical barriers prevent the establishment of most plant–pathogen interactions. However, should the pathogen overcome these constitutive defenses, its recognition leads to the induction of a multitude of defenses through the genetic reprogramming of the cell.

Our understanding of the complex mechanisms by which plants first detect, and then defend against, different microbial pathogens has advanced considerably over the last few decades. Central to this progress has been the identification and characterization of plant disease resistance genes that facilitate pathogen strain–specific recognition and the identification of signal transduction pathways that link pathogen recognition with a targeted response ( Nimchuk et al., 2003 ; Glazebrook, 2005 ). Three phytohormones, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET), have been shown to play a major role in the regulation of these signal transduction pathways. This regulation is not achieved through the isolated activation of each single hormonal pathway but rather through a complex regulatory network that connects the different pathways enabling each to assist or antagonize the others as required to fine-tune the defense response to the individual pathogen. Thus, it is generally accepted (although may be oversimplified) that SA plays a major role in activation of defenses against biotrophic pathogens, whereas JA and ET are more usually associated with defense against necrotrophic pathogen attack. Additionally, SA and JA/ET defense pathways are mutually antagonistic ( Thomma et al., 2001 ; Kunkel and Brooks, 2002 ; Turner et al., 2002 ; Rojo et al., 2003 ; Glazebrook, 2005 ; Lorenzo and Solano, 2005 ; van Loon et al., 2006 ).

Although mechanistic explanations of this antagonistic and cooperative crosstalk are scarce, several examples suggest its regulation through the differential modulation of transcription factor (and cofactors) activity by the different hormones. Thus, antagonism between JA and SA pathways requires the activation of proteins such as NPR1 and WRKY70 that activate expression of SA-responsive genes while repressing JA-responsive genes ( Spoel et al., 2003 ; Li et al., 2004 ). Conversely, cooperation of JA and ET in the activation of defenses against necrotrophs can be explained by their concerted activation of Ethylene Response Factor1 ( ERF1 ), which induces defense gene expression and plant resistance ( Berrocal-Lobo et al., 2002 ; Lorenzo et al., 2003 ). However, in contrast with the case of pathogen infection, ET and JA antagonize one another in the activation of responses to wounding. The fine-tune regulation of this antagonism depends on the balance of activation by both hormones of ERF1 and MYC2, another transcription factor differentially regulating two branches of the JA signaling pathway ( Lorenzo et al., 2004 ).

The current understanding of plant defense responses described above has been achieved through the study of a limited number of models, which may be constraining our view of the plant–pathogen interaction and the true capacity of plants to defend against pathogens. In fact, random sequencing approaches of microbial populations from seawater samples have recently demonstrated that we still only know a relatively small percentage of gene functions existing in nature ( Venter et al., 2004 ). Applied to the plant–pathogen field, discovery of new plant defense mechanisms should be favored by broadening the range of pathogens and plant species under study. With this aim, we have characterized the interaction between Pythium irregulare and Arabidopsis thaliana .

Pythium is commonly regarded as a soil-borne vascular pathogen. It is particularly virulent in seedlings, although it can infect mature aboveground tissue in several plant species, including Arabidopsis ( van der Plaats-Niterink, 1981 ; Martin, 1995 ). Species within this genus range from virulent to opportunistic pathogens, producing seedling damping-off and root and stem rots that may cause economically important losses in crops and ornamental plants ( Miller and Sauve, 1975 ; Farr et al., 1989 ). P. irregulare has been reported to produce both lytic enzymes ( Deacon, 1979 ) and phytotoxins ( Brandenburg, 1950 ) that would degrade plant tissue, thus behaving as a necrotrophic pathogen. Being an oomycete, and thus phylogenetically distant from the most extensively studied species of fungi ( Kamoun et al., 1999 ), the supposed necrotrophic lifestyle, and the fact that JA and ET are required for effective defenses against different species from this genus also differentiate Pythium from other oomycetes ( Knoester et al., 1998 ; Staswick et al., 1998 ; Vijayan et al., 1998 ).

To gain a deeper insight of the Arabidopsis – P. irregulare host–pathogen interaction, it is imperative to understand both the physical infection process and the molecular consequences. To that end, we have (1) characterized the infection process and (2) studied the plant molecular defense pathways involved in resistance through genetic and genomic analysis. In addition to the comprehensive characterization of the interaction, this combined analysis has identified ABA as a signal required for plant resistance to P. irregulare and other necrotrophic pathogens.

DISCUSSION

The study of Arabidopsis–P. irregulare host–pathogen interaction reported here highlights the importance of broadening our understanding of the interaction of diverse pathogens with this important model species.

Microscopy analysis has shown that P. irregulare infection of Arabidopsis has neither purely typical necrotrophic nor biotrophic characteristics. The infection process starts with the production of appressoria and haustoria-like structures. Compatible host–pathogen interactions show further hyphal ingression to be primarily intracellular, moving more rapidly through the vasculature and invading all tissues. Although no lytic enzymes or toxins have been detected, this progressive invasion ultimately provokes plant cell death.

Analysis of defense-related mutants has shown that Arabidopsis resistance to the establishment and progression of disease by P. irregulare depends initially on avoidance of penetration, mediated by PEN2 and, very likely, other primary defense layers, since pen2 mutants are not fully susceptible to the pathogen. These results are in line with previous reports demonstrating that PEN2 (encoding a glucosyl hydrolase) controls the ingress of a broader range of pathogens, including both biotrophs and necrotrophs, than other penetration proteins ( Lipka et al., 2005 ; Nurnberger and Lipka, 2005 ).

Recognition and signaling of defense activation may start from ERECTA (and other partially redundant proteins, since erecta mutants are not fully susceptible). Due to its structural similarity to receptor-like kinases, ERECTA has been suggested to recognize a pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( Godiard et al., 2003 ; Llorente et al., 2005 ). The susceptibility of erecta mutants suggests the likely importance of this receptor-like kinase in the recognition of P. irregulare .
