Although the role of the classic retinoic acid (RA)-induced genomic pathway in 
cancer cell differentiation is well recognized, the underlying mechanisms remain 
to be dissected. Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) is a transcription 
factor activated by RA, and its serine 77 (RARalphaS77) is the main residue 
phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) 
complex. We report here that in both human myeloid leukemia and mouse embryonic 
teratocarcinoma stem cells, either RA-suppressed CAK phosphorylation of RARalpha 
or mutation of RARalphaS77 to alanine (RARalphaS77A) coordinates CAK-dependent 
G(1) arrest with cancer cell differentiation by transactivating RA-target genes. 
Both hypophosphorylated RARalpha and RARalphaS77A reduce binding to retinoic 
acid-responsive elements (RARE) in the promoters of RA-target genes while 
stimulating gene transcription. The enhanced transactivation and reduced 
RARalpha-chromatin interaction are accompanied by RARalpha dissociation from the 
transcriptional repressor N-CoR and are association with the coactivator NCoA-3. 
Such effects of decreased CAK phosphorylation of RARalphaS77 on mediating 
RA-dependent transcriptional control of cancer cell differentiation are examined 
correspondingly in both RA-resistant myeloid leukemia and embryonic 
teratocarcinoma stem RARalpha(-/-) cells. These studies demonstrate, for the 
first time, that RA couples G(1) arrest to transcriptional control of cancer 
cell differentiation by suppressing CAK phosphorylation of RARalpha to release 
transcriptional repression.-Wang, A., Alimova, I. N., Luo, P. Jong, A., Triche,
