SlyD is a putative folding helper protein from the Escherichia coli cytosol, 
which consists of an N-terminal prolyl isomerase domain of the FKBP type and a 
presumably unstructured C-terminal tail. We produced truncated versions without 
this tail (SlyD) for SlyD from E. coli, as well as for the SlyD orthologues from 
Yersinia pestis, Treponema pallidum, Pasteurella multocida, and Vibrio cholerae. 
They are monomeric in solution and unfold reversibly. All SlyD variants catalyze 
the proline-limited refolding of ribonuclease T1 with very high efficiencies, 
and the specificity constants (kcat/KM) are equal to approximately 10(6) M(-1) 
s(-1). These large values originate from the high affinities of the SlyD 
orthologues for unfolded RCM-T1, which are reflected in low KM values of 
approximately 1 microM. SlyD also exhibits pronounced chaperone properties. 
Permanently unfolded proteins bind with high affinity to SlyD and thus inhibit 
its prolyl isomerase activity. The unfolded protein chains do not need to 
contain proline residues to be recognized and bound by SlyD. The conservation of 
prolyl isomerase activity and chaperone properties within the SlyD family 
suggests that these proteins might act as true folding helpers in the bacterial 
cytosol. The SlyD proteins are also well suited for biotechnological 
applications. As fusion partners they facilitate the refolding and increase the 
solubility of aggregation-prone proteins such as the gp41 ectodomain fragment of 
HIV-1.
