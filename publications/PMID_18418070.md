Post-translational modifications of histones are determining factors in the 
global and local regulation of genome activity. Phosphorylation of histone H3 is 
globally associated with mitotic chromatin compaction but occurs in a much more 
restricted manner during interphase transcriptional regulation of a limited 
subset of genes. In the course of gene regulation, serine 10 phosphorylation at 
histone H3 is targeted to a very small fraction of nucleosomes that is highly 
susceptible to additional acetylation events. Recently, we and others have 
identified 14-3-3 as a binding protein that recognizes both phosphorylated 
serine 10 and phosphorylated serine 28 on histone H3. In vitro, the affinity of 
14-3-3 for phosphoserine 10 is weak but becomes significantly increased by 
additional acetylation of either lysine 9 or lysine 14 on the same histone tail. 
In contrast, the histone H3S28 site matches elements of 14-3-3 high affinity 
consensus motifs. This region mediates an initial stronger interaction that is 
less susceptible to modulation by "auxiliary" modifications. Here we discuss the 
binding of 14-3-3 proteins to histone H3 in detail and putative biological 
implications of these interactions.
