A common glycan alteration in transformed cells and human tumors is the highly 
elevated levels of N-linked beta(1,6)glycans caused by increased transcription 
of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V). Here, we define the involvement of 
GnT-V in modulation of homotypic cell-cell adhesion in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 
and mouse NIH3T3 cells. Increased GnT-V expression resulted in a significant 
decrease in the rates of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Reduced cell-cell 
adhesion was blocked by function-blocking antibody against N-cadherin and 
abrogated by pre-treatment of cells with swainsonine, demonstrating the 
involvement of N-cadherin in the cell-cell adhesion and that changes in N-linked 
beta(1,6)glycan expression are responsible for the reduction in rates of 
adhesion, although this reduction could be mediated by the altered N-linked 
glycosylation of glycoproteins other than N-cadherin. Overexpression of GnT-V 
had no effect on the levels of cell surface expression of N-cadherin; however, 
it did cause a marked enhancement of both beta(1,6) branching and 
poly-N-acetyllactosamine expression on N-cadherin. GnT-V overexpression resulted 
in decreased N-cadherin clustering on the cell surface induced by 
anti-N-cadherin antibody and affected the outside-in signal transduction pathway 
of ERK mediated by N-cadherin. Overexpression of GnT-V sensitized stimulation of 
tyrosine phosphorylation of catenins by growth factors and expression of v-src, 
which is consistent with its reduction of cell-cell adhesion. In vitro, 
GnT-V-overexpressing cells showed increased motility concomitant with increased 
phosphorylation of catenins. Moreover, GnT-V-deficient embryo fibroblasts from 
GnT-V homozygous null mice (GnT-V(-/-)) express N-cadherin and showed 
significantly increased levels of N-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion compared 
with those from GnT-V(+/-) mice. These levels of adhesion were inhibited 
significantly by transient expression of GnT-V, confirming the hypothesis that 
levels of GnT-V can regulate cadherin-associated homotypic cell-cell adhesion. 
Aberrant N-linked beta(1,6) branching that occurs during oncogenesis can, 
therefore, lessen cell-cell adhesion, contributing to increased cellular 
motility and invasiveness.
