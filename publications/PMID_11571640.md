It has recently been shown that the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6
proteins can target the PDZ-domain containing proteins, Dlg, MUPP-1, MAGI-1 and
hScrib for proteasome-mediated degradation. However, the E6 proteins from HPV-16
and HPV-18 (the two most common high-risk virus types) differ in their ability
to target these proteins in a manner that correlates with their malignant
potential. To investigate the underlying mechanisms for this, we have mutated
HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6s to give each protein the other's PDZ-binding motif.
Analysis of these mutants shows that the greater ability of HPV-18 E6 to bind to
these proteins and to target them for degradation is indeed due to a single
amino acid difference. Using a number of assays, we show that the E6 proteins
interact specifically with only one of the five PDZ domains of MAGI-1, and this
is the first interaction described for this particular PDZ domain. We also show
that the guanylate kinase homology domain and the regions of MAGI-1 downstream
of amino acid 733 are not required for the degradation of MAGI-1. Finally, in a
series of comparative analyses, we show that the degradation of MAGI-1 occurs
through a different mechanism from that used by the E6 protein to induce the
degradation of Dlg and p53.

It has recently been shown that the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins can target the PDZ-domain containing proteins, Dlg, MUPP-1, MAGI-1 and hScrib for proteasome-mediated degradation. However, the E6 proteins from HPV-16 and HPV-18 (the two most common high-risk virus types) differ in their ability to target these proteins in a manner that correlates with their malignant potential. To investigate the underlying mechanisms for this, we have mutated HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6s to give each protein the other’s PDZ-binding motif. Analysis of these mutants shows that the greater ability of HPV-18 E6 to bind to these proteins and to target them for degradation is indeed due to a single amino acid difference. Using a number of assays, we show that the E6 proteins interact specifically with only one of the five PDZ domains of MAGI-1, and this is the first interaction described for this particular PDZ domain. We also show that the guanylate kinase homology domain and the regions of MAGI-1 down-stream of amino acid 733 are not required for the degradation of MAGI-1. Finally, in a series of comparative analyses, we show that the degradation of MAGI-1 occurs through a different mechanism from that used by the E6 protein to induce the degradation of Dlg and p53.

Introduction

The HPV-18 and HPV-16 E6 proteins have been shown to target a number of cellular proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, including p53 ( Scheffner et al ., 1990 ; Huibregtse et al ., 1991 , 1993 ), c-Myc ( Gross-Mesilaty et al ., 1998 ) and Bak ( Thomas and Banks, 1998 , 1999 ). More recently, they have also been shown to target a number of the m embrane- a ssociated g uanylate k inase (MAGUK) proteins, including Dlg ( Kiyono et al ., 1997 ; Lee et al ., 1997 ; Gardiol et al ., 1999 ; Pim et al ., 2000 ), hScrib ( Nakagawa and Huibregtse, 2000 ), and MAGI-1 ( Glaunsinger et al ., 2000 ), as well as a non-MAGUK, PDZ domain-containing protein, MUPP-1 ( Lee et al ., 2000 ). The MAGUK proteins are characterized by having a large number of specific protein recognition domains, including WW or SH3 domains, a guanylate kinase (GuK) homology domain and several PDZ domains ( Ponting and Phillips, 1995 ; Saras and Heldin, 1996 ; Kim, 1997 ; Kim et al ., 1998 ). Interestingly, the high-risk E6 proteins all appear to interact with their target MAGUKs via the PDZ domains ( Kiyono et al ., 1997 ; Lee et al ., 1997 , 2000 ; Gardiol et al ., 1999 ; Glaunsinger et al ., 2000 ; Nakagawa and Huibregtse, 2000 ). These domains are characterized by stretches of 80–90 amino acids ( Ponting and Phillips, 1995 ; Fanning and Anderson, 1999 ), which bind with high affinity to specific sequences (T/SXV) ( Songyang et al ., 1997 ), usually found in the extreme carboxy termini of their target proteins. Such specific carboxy terminal sequences have been identified in the Adenovirus 9 E4-ORF1 protein, the E6 proteins of high-risk HPV types and the HTLV-1 Tax protein ( Lee et al ., 1997 ) and, depending on the assay system used, contribute to viral transforming activity ( Kiyono et al ., 1997 ; Lee et al ., 1997 ). MAGUKs are localized at regions of cell-cell contact, such as tight junctions in epithelial cells and synaptic junctions in neurons, where they are believed to function as molecular scaffolds in the formation of multi-molecular complexes via their protein-protein interacting domains ( Gomperts, 1996 ; Mitic and Anderson, 1998 ; Craven and Bredt, 1998 ). Although little is known about the function of many of these proteins, two of the E6 targets, Dlg and Scrib have been shown to be essential for the regulation of cell growth and polarity in Drosophila , leading to their being characterized as potential tumour suppressor proteins ( Bilder et al ., 2000 ). MAGI-1 ( m embrane a ssociated g uanylate kinase with i nverted domain structure) has also been shown to be localized at tight junctions of epithelial cells ( Dobrosotskaya et al ., 1997 ; Ide et al ., 1999 ). It is also found in complex with β -catenin ( Dobrosotskaya and James, 2000 ), deregulation of which is a hallmark of tumour progression in many different cancers (reviewed in Polakis, 1999 ). The closely related MAGI-2 and MAGI-3 proteins, have also recently been shown also to be associated with the regulation of the PTEN tumour suppressor, a component of the PKB/Akt kinase regulation pathway ( Wu et al ., 2000a , b ; Li et al ., 1998 ; Downward, 1998 ; Stambolic et al ., 1998 ). In this case, both MAGI-2 and 3 were shown to be required for PTEN’s activity in efficiently down-regulating the PKB pathway, upregulation of which is associated with cell survival and proliferation ( Marte and Downward, 1997 ; Downward 1988, for reviews). Therefore, the high risk HPV E6 proteins would appear to be intimately involved in de-regulating a number of aspects of cell homeostasis related to the regulation of cell growth and polarity in response to cell contact.

In this study we have analysed in detail the interactions between the HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 proteins and their MAGUK target proteins, MAGI-1 and Dlg. A mutational analysis of the PDZ-binding motif of HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 showed that a single amino acid residue difference (L/V) is sufficient to have significant effects upon the ability of E6 to bind to the MAGUKs. This change largely accounts for the differences between HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6s in their abilities to target MAGUKs for degradation. However, comparison of the E6-mediated degradation of p53, Dlg and MAGI-1, together with a mutational analysis of HPV-18 E6, provides strong evidence that E6 proteins use substantially different mechanisms to induce the degradation of each of these three protein targets.

In addition, we also demonstrate that, of the five PDZ domains of MAGI-1, the HPV-18 E6 protein binds specifically only to PDZ domain 1, and that this binding is required for the induction of MAGI-1 degradation. This is the first description of a specific interaction for this PDZ domain of MAGI-1 and indicates that the targeting of PDZ domains by HPV E6 proteins is also highly specific. The potential for design of specific antiviral compounds is clear.

Discussion

A number of DNA tumour virus proteins have the ability to target certain cellular proteins and inactivate them. The best known interactions are those involving the tumour suppressor proteins p53 and pRb, which are targeted by, amongst others, Adenovirus, Simian virus 40 (SV40) and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) proteins. The fact that a diverse range of viruses all inactivate the same targets, albeit by different means, implies that these viruses have a common requirement to overcome certain obstacles to their replication and, further, that their doing so may predispose their host cells to oncogenic transformation. Recently, some members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family have also been shown to be targets for the Adenovirus 9 E4-ORF1 and the E6 proteins of the oncogenic HPV types ( Kiyono et al ., 1997 ; Lee et al ., 1997 , 2000 ; Gardiol et al ., 1999 ; Pim et al ., 2000 ; Glaunsinger et al ., 2000 ).

In this study we have performed an extensive analysis of the interactions between the MAGI-1 scaffolding protein and the E6 proteins of the oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. We had previously shown that HPV-18 E6 was more effective than HPV-16 E6 in binding to Dlg and in inducing its degradation ( Gardiol et al ., 1999 ; Pim et al ., 2000 ). Here we show that the single amino acid difference in the PDZ binding motif, ETQV/L, is solely responsible for the increased effectiveness of HPV-18 E6, and we also show that this appears to hold true in the case of another PDZ domain protein, MAGI-1.

The PDZ binding motif has been strictly defined and our results show that it is HPV-18E6’s possession of a perfect motif that renders it more effective in the induction of Dlg and MAGI-1 degradation. However it is interesting that if this motif is transferred to HPV-16 E6, that protein becomes much more effective than wild type HPV-18 E6 in binding and inducing the degradation of these MAGUKs. In contrast, when the HPV-16 E6 binding motif is transferred to HPV-18 E6, then its ability to bind and degrade its MAGUK targets is almost completely abolished. These results highlight two important features of the E6-MAGUK interaction. First, HPV-18 E6 is the more efficient degrader of these proteins, largely due to its intrinsically stronger ability to bind, due to having a Valine rather than Leucine as the carboxy terminal residue. Secondly, that other residues, in addition to the core S/TXV/L binding motif, also play a role in the E6-MAGUK interaction. It is interesting to speculate that specificity may also be conferred, in part, by the run of basic Arginine residues immediately prior to the consensus PDZ binding motif. Studies are currently in progress to investigate this further.

There is mounting evidence that the degradation of MAGUK proteins by E6 is different from their degradation of p53. HPV-18 E6 can induce the degradation of Dlg in wheatgerm extract ( Pim et al ., 2000 ), from which E6AP is absent ( Huibregtse et al ., 1991 , 1993 ); and low-risk HPV E6 proteins, which do not interact with E6-AP, can also degrade Dlg when provided with a PDZ-binding consensus sequence ( Pim et al ., 2000 ). In addition, we have shown here that mutants of HPV-18 E6 that cannot induce the degradation of p53 (ΔNT and m2) are still able to induce the degradation of MAGI-1. This indicates that if E6AP is, in fact, involved in the degradation of MAGI-1, its mode of action must be different from that involved in p53 degradation. Similarly, we had previously reported that the ΔNT and m2 mutants also retain the ability to induce the degradation of Dlg. This might suggest that Dlg and MAGI-1 are degraded by E6 through similar mechanisms. However, a compelling argument against this is found in the contrast between the similarity of the MAGI-1 and Dlg binding affinities on GST-18E6 and the very marked difference in the kinetics of their E6-induced degradation. Thus, MAGI-1 is highly susceptible to E6-induced degradation, with complete clearance of the protein in 30 min. In contrast, complete clearance of Dlg requires at least 2 h.

Perhaps the most interesting finding in this study is that the binding of E6 to MAGI-1 occurs only through PDZ domain 1. Since this occurs despite the high levels of homology, both of PDZ domains (particularly PDZ1 and PDZ5 of MAGI-1), and of PDZ domain-binding motifs, it is particularly striking. This is the first report of any specific binding to this MAGI-1 PDZ domain and is of great interest for several reasons: it might even be possible to determine what class of proteins normally interacts with this PDZ domain, by comparison with the E6 binding domain. This also raises the question of why this particular PDZ domain is targeted by HPV E6. It is possible that MAGI-1 might be involved in some interactions particularly detrimental to viral replication when that particular PDZ domain is vacant. In addition to raising these intellectually interesting questions, this finding also raises the possibility of engineering chemotherapeutic agents specifically capable of preventing the interaction of high risk HPV E6 proteins with one of their cellular targets.

Members of the MAGI protein family have been shown to interact with the PTEN tumour suppressor ( Wu et al ., 2000a , b ). This phosphatase specifically dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (PtIns(3,4,5)P3) which, in turn, prevents activation of Protein B Kinase ( Klippel et al ., 1996 ; Marte et al ., 1997 ; Franke et al ., 1997 ). Protein kinase B (PKB) is a major regulator of cellular growth and has been implicated, once activated, in a number of pathways leading to cell survival and proliferation ( Marte and Downward, 1997 ; Downward, 1998 , for reviews). The interaction of MAGI family proteins with PTEN appears to be crucial for their activity in this system and thus for PTEN’s tumour suppressor activities ( Wu et al ., 2000a , b ). Thus, the intervention of HPV E6 proteins in directing the degradation of MAGI-1 would, in theory, tend to increase cell survival and proliferation, providing a suitable environment for viral DNA replication, but also increasing the like-lihood of oncogenic transformation. Interestingly, one preliminary study detected PTEN mutations in the majority of endometrial carcinomas tested, but in none of the cervical carcinomas tested ( Tashiro et al ., 1997 ); this is suggestively similar to the case with p53, which is rarely mutated in cervical cancers and which is also a target for E6-induced degradation ( Crook et al ., 1991b ; Scheffner et al ., 1991 ). In this context, our finding that the HPV E6 proteins interact specifically with only one of MAGI-1’s five PDZ domains leads to the encouraging possibility of devising inhibitors of the E6/MAGI-1 interaction that do not affect other PDZ domain interactions. These in turn might lead to the development of more specific and non-toxic chemotherapeutic agents.
