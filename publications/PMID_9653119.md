Cognate cDNAs are described for 2 of the 10 thyroid hormone receptor-associated 
proteins (TRAPs) that are immunopurified with thyroid hormone receptor alpha 
(TRalpha) from ligand-treated HeLa (alpha-2) cells. Both TRAP220 and TRAP100 
contain LXXLL domains found in other nuclear receptor-interacting proteins and 
both appear to reside in a single complex with other TRAPs (in the absence of 
TR). However, only TRAP220 shows a direct ligand-dependent interaction with 
TRalpha, and these interactions are mediated through the C terminus of TRalpha 
and (at least in part) the LXXLL domains of TRAP220. TRAP220 also interacts with 
other nuclear receptors [vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptor alpha, 
retinoid X receptor alpha, peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor (PPAR) 
alpha, PPARgamma and, to a lesser extent, estrogen receptor] in a 
ligand-dependent manner, whereas TRAP100 shows only marginal interactions with 
estrogen receptor, retinoid X receptor alpha, PPARalpha, and PPARgamma. 
Consistent with these results, TRAP220 moderately stimulates human 
TRalpha-mediated transcription in transfected cells, whereas a fragment 
containing the LXXLL motifs acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of nuclear 
receptor-mediated transcription both in transfected cells (TRalpha) and in cell 
free transcription systems (TRalpha and vitamin D receptor). These studies 
indicate that TRAP220 plays a major role in anchoring other TRAPs to TRalpha 
during the function of the TRalpha-TRAP complex and, further, that TRAP220 
(possibly along with other TRAPs) may be a global coactivator for the nuclear 
receptor superfamily.
