## Abstract

1. Mol Biol Cell. 1994 Jan;5(1):105-18. doi: 10.1091/mbc.5.1.105.

TOR1 and TOR2 are structurally and functionally similar but not identical 
phosphatidylinositol kinase homologues in yeast.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes TOR1 and TOR2 were originally identified by 
mutations that confer resistance to the immunosuppressant rapamycin. TOR2 was 
previously shown to encode an essential 282-kDa phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI 
kinase) homologue. The TOR1 gene product is also a large (281 kDa) PI kinase 
homologue, with 67% identity to TOR2. TOR1 is not essential, but a TOR1 TOR2 
double disruption uniquely confers a cell cycle (G1) arrest as does exposure to 
rapamycin; disruption of TOR2 alone is lethal but does not cause a cell cycle 
arrest. TOR1-TOR2 and TOR2-TOR1 hybrids indicate that carboxy-terminal domains 
of TOR1 and TOR2 containing a lipid kinase sequence motif are interchangeable 
and therefore functionally equivalent; the other portions of TOR1 and TOR2 are 
not interchangeable. The TOR1-1 and TOR2-1 mutations, which confer rapamycin 
resistance, alter the same potential protein kinase C site in the respective 
protein's lipid kinase domain. Thus, TOR1 and TOR2 are likely similar but not 
identical, rapamycin-sensitive PI kinases possibly regulated by phosphorylation. 
TOR1 and TOR2 may be components of a novel signal transduction pathway 
controlling progression through G1.
