Mesothelin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface molecule 
expressed in the mesothelial lining of the body cavities and in many tumor 
cells. Based on the finding that a soluble form of mesothelin specifically binds 
to ovarian carcinoma cell line OVCAR-3, we isolated cDNAs encoding a 
mesothelin-binding protein by expression cloning. The polypeptides encoded by 
the two cloned cDNA fragments matched to portions of CA125, an ovarian cancer 
antigen and a giant mucin-like glycoprotein present at the surface of tumor 
cells. By flow cytometric analysis and immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that 
CA125 binds to mesothelin in a specific manner. Binding of CA125 to 
membrane-bound mesothelin mediates heterotypic cell adhesion as anti-mesothelin 
antibody blocks binding of OVCAR-3 cells expressing CA125 to an endothelial-like 
cell line expressing mesothelin. Finally, we show that CA125 and mesothelin are 
co-expressed in advanced grade ovarian adenocarcinoma. Taken together, our data 
indicate that mesothelin is a novel CA125-binding protein and that CA125 might 
contribute to the metastasis of ovarian cancer to the peritoneum by initiating 
cell attachment to the mesothelial epithelium via binding to mesothelin.
