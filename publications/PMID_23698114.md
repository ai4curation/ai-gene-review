The collecting duct (CD) is a major renal site for the hormonal regulation of Na 
homeostasis and is critical for systemic arterial blood pressure control. Our 
previous studies demonstrated that the endothelin-1 gene (edn1) is an early 
response gene to the action of aldosterone. Because aldosterone and endothelin-1 
(ET-1) have opposing actions on Na reabsorption (JNa) in the kidney, we 
postulated that stimulation of ET-1 by aldosterone acts as a negative feedback 
mechanism, acting locally within the CD. Aldosterone is known to increase JNa in 
the CD, in part, by stimulating the epithelial Na channel (ENaC). In contrast, 
ET-1 increases Na and water excretion through its binding to receptors in the 
CD. To date, direct measurement of the quantitative effect of ET-1 on 
transepithelial JNa in the isolated in vitro microperfused mouse CD has not been 
determined. We observed that the CD exhibits substantial JNa in male and female 
mice that is regulated, in part, by a benzamil-sensitive pathway, presumably 
ENaC. ENaC-mediated JNa is greater in the cortical CD (CCD) than in the outer 
medullary CD (OMCD); however, benzamil-insensitive JNa is present in the CCD and 
not in the OMCD. In the presence of ET-1, ENaC-mediated JNa is significantly 
inhibited. Blockade of either ETA or ETB receptor restored JNa to control rates; 
however, only ETA receptor blockade restored a benzamil-sensitive component of 
JNa. We conclude 1) Na reabsorption is mediated by ENaC in the CCD and OMCD and 
also by an ENaC-independent mechanism in the CCD; and 2) ET-1 inhibits JNa in 
the CCD through both ETA and ETB receptor-mediated pathways.
