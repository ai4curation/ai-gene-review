Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases play central roles in 
coordinating the stereotypical events that occur during apoptosis. Because the 
major executioner caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, exhibit almost 
indistinguishable activity toward certain synthetic peptide substrates, this has 
led to the widespread view that these proteases occupy functionally redundant 
roles within the cell death machinery. However, the distinct phenotypes of mice 
deficient in either of these caspases, as well as mice deficient in both, is at 
odds with this view. These distinct phenotypes could be related to differences 
in the relative expression levels of caspase-3 and caspase-7 in vivo, or due to 
more fundamental differences between these proteases in terms of their ability 
to cleave natural substrates. Here we show that caspase-3 and caspase-7 exhibit 
differential activity toward multiple substrate proteins, including Bid, XIAP, 
gelsolin, caspase-6, and cochaperone p23. Caspase-3 was found to be generally 
more promiscuous than caspase-7 and appears to be the major executioner caspase 
during the demolition phase of apoptosis. Our observations provide a molecular 
basis for the different phenotypes seen in mice lacking either caspase and 
indicate that these proteases occupy nonredundant roles within the cell death 
machinery.
