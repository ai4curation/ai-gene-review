LncRNAs and microRNAs can play significant roles in various cancers, including 
gastric cancer (GC). In our study, we investigated the role of lncRNA XIST in 
GC. We observed that XIST was increased in MGC803 and BGC823 cells compared to 
human normal gastric epithelial GES-1 cells. It was also shown that miR-185 was 
decreased in GC cell lines. Silencing XIST can inhibit the growth of GC cells 
and bioinformatics analysis was performed to confirm the correlation between 
XIST and miR-185. Interestingly, a negative correlation was indicated between 
XIST and miR-185 in GC cells. In addition, TGF-β1 was predicted as a target gene 
of miR-185. miR-185 can modulate TGF-β1 expression negatively in vitro. 
Moreover, we found that sh-XIST inhibited GC development via decreasing TGF-β1 
by upregulating miR-185 in vitro. Therefore, we speculated that XIST can act as 
a competing endogenous lncRNA (ceRNA) to regulate TGF-β1 by sponging miR-185 in 
GC. Taken these together, it was indicated that XIST/miR-185/TGF-β1 axis 
participated in the development of GC. XIST could act as a potential prognostic 
biomarker in GC development.
