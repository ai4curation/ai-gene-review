The spo0J gene of Bacillus subtilis is required for the initiation of 
sporulation. We show that the sporulation defect caused by null mutations in 
spo0J is suppressed by a null mutation in the gene located directly upstream 
from spo0J, soj (suppressor of spo0J). These results indicate that Soj inhibits 
the initiation of sporulation and that Spo0J antagonizes that inhibition. 
Further genetic experiments indicated that Soj ultimately affects sporulation by 
inhibiting the activation (phosphorylation) of the developmental transcription 
factor encoded by spo0A. In addition, the temperature-sensitive sporulation 
phenotype caused by the ftsA279 (spoIIN279) mutation was partly suppressed by 
the soj null mutation, indicating that FtsA might also affect the activity of 
Soj. Soj and Spo0J are known to be similar in sequence to a family of proteins 
involved in plasmid partitioning, including ParA and ParB of prophage P1, SopA 
and SopB of F, and IncC and KorB of RK2, spo0J was found to be required for 
normal chromosome partitioning as well as for sporulation. spo0J null mutants 
produced a significant proportion of anucleate cells during vegetative growth. 
The dual functions of Spo0J could provide a mechanism for regulating the 
initiation of sporulation in response to activity of the chromosome partition 
machinery.
