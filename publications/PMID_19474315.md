Adaptor proteins are likely to modulate spatially and temporally the trafficking 
of a number of membrane proteins, including neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors (nAChRs). A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a novel UBX-containing 
protein, UBXD4, as one of the cytosolic proteins that interact directly with the 
alpha3 and alpha4 nAChR subunits. The function of UBX-containing proteins is 
largely unknown. Immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy confirmed the 
interaction of UBXD4 with alpha3-containing nAChRs (alpha3* nAChRs) expressed in 
HEK293 cells, PC12 cells, and rat cortical neurons. Overexpression of UBXD4 in 
differentiated PC12 cells (dPC12) increased nAChR cell surface expression, 
especially that of the alpha3beta2 subtype. These findings were corroborated by 
electrophysiology, immunofluorescent staining, and biotinylation of surface 
receptors. Silencing of UBXD4 led to a significant reduction of alpha3* nAChRs 
in rat cortical neurons and dPC12 cells. Biochemical and immunofluorescence 
studies of endogenous UBXD4 showed that the protein is located in both the ER 
and cis-Golgi compartments. Our investigations also showed that the alpha3 
subunit is ubiquitinated and that UBXD4 can interfere with its ubiquitination 
and consequent degradation by the proteasome. Our data suggest that UBXD4 
modulates the distribution of alpha3* nAChRs between specialized intracellular 
compartments and the plasma membrane. This effect is achieved by controlling the 
stability of the alpha3 subunit and, consequently, the number of receptors at 
the cell surface.
