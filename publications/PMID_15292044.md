Bcl-2 protects cells from apoptosis initiated by a variety of stimuli including 
loss of cell adhesion. Bcl-2 -/- mice develop renal hypoplastic/cystic dysplasia 
with renal cyst formation coinciding with renal maturation in normal mice. To 
gain a better understanding of the role cell-adhesive mechanisms play during 
renal maturation, we generated proximal tubule and collecting duct cell lines 
from postnatal day 10 (P10) and P20 bcl-2 +/+ and bcl-2 -/- mice. Very little is 
known about the role cell-adhesive and migratory mechanisms play during renal 
maturation. We observed that modulation of cell-adhesive properties, which 
normally occur in a nephron segment-specific manner during renal maturation, and 
cell migration were altered in cells from bcl-2 -/- mice. Enhanced migration of 
bcl-2 -/- proximal tubule cells in a scratch wound assay was completely 
inhibited by incubation with PP1 (Src inhibitor) and moderately affected by 
incubation with SB-203580 (p38 inhibitor). These cells expressed increased 
levels of fibronectin and had numerous central focal adhesions. P20 bcl-2 -/- 
proximal tubule cells adhered to fibronectin but adhered poorly to collagen, 
vitronectin, or laminin. Collecting duct cells, similar to proximal tubule cells 
from bcl-2 -/- mice, demonstrated enhanced migration in a scratch wound assay 
that was inhibited by incubation with PP1. Migration of these cells was 
moderately affected by incubation with PD-98059 (MEK inhibitor) or LY-294002 
(PI3 kinase inhibitor), whereas incubation with SB-203580 had no effect. P10 
bcl-2 -/- collecting duct cells also expressed increased levels of fibronectin 
but decreased levels of thrombospondin-1 and demonstrated precocious binding to 
fibronectin and vitronectin compared with bcl-2 +/+ cells. The ability of P20 
bcl-2 +/+ collecting duct cells to adhere to fibronectin and vitronectin 
corresponded with a decline in thrombospondin-1 expression. Therefore, 
alterations in cell-adhesive and migratory characteristics may be an early 
indicator of aberrant renal epithelial cell differentiation.
