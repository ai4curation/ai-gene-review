c-myc oncogene activation is critical in the pathogenesis of a spectrum of human 
malignancies. The c-Myc NH2-terminal domain (MycNTD) is essential for cellular 
transformation, and mediates critical protein interactions that modulate c-Myc 
oncogenic properties. In medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric 
brain tumor, deregulated c-myc expression is linked with poorer disease 
phenotypes and outcomes. The biological basis for these associations is, 
however, not well understood. To better understand mechanisms underlying 
Myc-mediated transformation of medulloblastoma, we sought to identify novel 
MycNTD protein interactors from a medulloblastoma cell line library using a 
unique two-hybrid system. We identified a novel MycNTD binding protein, JPO2, 
which shows nuclear colocalization with c-Myc, and interacts with c-Myc both in 
vitro and in mammalian cells. In Rat1a transformation assays, JPO2 potentiates 
c-Myc transforming activity, and can complement a transformation-defective Myc 
mutant. Immunohistochemical studies indicate tumor-specific JPO2 expression in 
human medulloblastoma, and an association of JPO2 expression with metastatic 
tumors. Significantly, JPO2 expression induces colony formation in UW228, a 
medulloblastoma cell line, whereas RNAi-mediated JPO2 knockdown impairs colony 
formation in UW228, and in Myc-transformed UW228 cells. These data provide 
evidence for biochemical and functional interaction between c-Myc and JPO2 in 
medulloblastoma transformation. JPO2 is closely related to JPO1, a Myc 
transcriptional target with transforming activity. As tumor-specific JPO1 
expression in human and murine medulloblastoma has also been reported; these 
collective observations suggest important functional links between the novel JPO 
protein family and c-Myc in medulloblastoma transformation.
