Hyaluronan (HA) is present at the apical surface of airway epithelium as a 
high-molecular-weight polymer. Since HA depolymerization initiates a cascade of 
events that results in kinin generation and growth factor processing, in the 
present work we used primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells 
grown at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to assess hyaluronidase (Hyal) activity 
by HA zymography, gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, and 
localization by confocal microscopy. Because TNF-alpha and IL-1beta induce Hyals 
in other cells, we tested their effects on Hyals expression and activity. We 
found that Hyal-like activity is present in the apical and basolateral 
secretions from HBE cells where Hyals 1, 2, and 3 are expressed, and that 
IL-1beta acts synergistically with TNF-alpha to increase gene expression and 
activity. Confocal microscopy showed that Hyals 1, 2, and 3 were localized 
intracellularly, while Hyal2 was also expressed at the apical pole associated 
with the plasma membrane, and in a soluble form on the apical secretions. Tissue 
sections from normal individuals and from individuals with asthma showed a Hyal 
distribution pattern similar to that observed on nontreated HBE cells or exposed 
to cytokines, respectively. In addition, increased expression and activity were 
observed in tracheal sections and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) obtained from 
subjects with asthma when compared with normal lung donors and healthy 
volunteers. Our observations indicate that Hyal 1, 2, and 3 are expressed in 
airway epithelium and may operate in a coordinated fashion to depolymerize HA 
during inflammation associated with up-regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, 
such as allergen-induced asthmatic responses.
