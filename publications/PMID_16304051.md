Mutations in LMAN1 (ERGIC-53) or MCFD2 cause combined deficiency of factor V and 
factor VIII (F5F8D). LMAN1 and MCFD2 form a protein complex that functions as a 
cargo receptor ferrying FV and FVIII from the endoplasmic reticulum to the 
Golgi. In this study, we analyzed 10 previously reported and 10 new F5F8D 
families. Mutations in the LMAN1 or MCFD2 genes accounted for 15 of these 
families, including 3 alleles resulting in no LMAN1 mRNA accumulation. Combined 
with our previous reports, we have identified LMAN1 or MCFD2 mutations as the 
causes of F5F8D in 71 of 76 families. Among the 5 families in which no mutations 
were identified, 3 were due to misdiagnosis, with the remaining 2 likely 
carrying LMAN1 or MCFD2 mutations that were missed by direct sequencing. Our 
results suggest that mutations in LMAN1 and MCFD2 may account for all cases of 
F5F8D. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis detected a low level of 
LMAN1-MCFD2 complex in lymphoblasts derived from patients with missense 
mutations in LMAN1 (C475R) or MCFD2 (I136T), suggesting that complete loss of 
the complex may not be required for clinically significant reduction in FV and 
FVIII.

Introduction

Combined deficiency of factor V and factor VIII (F5F8D) was first described in a family by Oeri et al 1 in 1954. Most patients have plasma levels of factor V (FV) and factor VIII (FVIII) (both antigen and activity) in the range of 5 to 30 U/dL and exhibit mild to moderate bleeding manifestations. 2 The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. Positional cloning efforts initially demonstrated that F5F8D results from null mutations in the gene encoding the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) marker protein ERGIC-53 (now called LMAN1). 3 However, a significant subset (30%) of affected individuals exhibited evidence for mutations in at least one additional gene, and cells from these affected individuals had normal levels of LMAN1. 4 , 5 We recently identified a second gene (MCFD2) that accounted for most of the remaining families without mutations in LMAN1. 6 LMAN1 and MCFD2 form a stable, calcium-dependent complex that likely serves as a cargo receptor for efficient ER-to-Golgi transport of FV and FVIII. Cargo receptors selectively package secreted proteins into COPII-coated vesicles budding from the ER for trafficking to the Golgi compartment. 7 - 9 Consistent with this idea, FVIII was shown to bind to both LMAN1 and MCFD2 through calcium-dependent protein-protein interactions in cultured cells. 10 , 11 The B domain of FVIII appears to be the primary determinant of binding to the LMAN1-MCFD2 complex. 6 , 12 In vitro data suggest that the other cargo proteins including the lysosomal proteins cathepsin Z 13 and cathepsin C 14 may also depend on LMAN1/MCFD2 function, though evidence for deficiency of these or other proteins in F5F8D patients has not been reported.

A total of 19 different mutations in the LMAN1 gene have been reported to date in 49 families, 2 , 15 , 16 all of which appear to be null mutations that abolish protein expression. Seven MCFD2 mutations have been identified in 10 families. 6 , 16 Five of the latter mutations disrupt the open reading frame, with the remaining 2 mutations resulting in single-amino acid substitutions in the second putative EF-hand domain (D129E and I136T). Both missense mutations were shown to abolish the interaction of MCFD2 with LMAN1. 6 Mutant MCFD2 expressed in COS1 cells failed to coimmunoprecipitate with LMAN1 but appears to still retain the ability to bind FVIII. 11

We now report the analysis of 20 F5F8D families, including 10 families previously reported to lack LMAN1 mutations. 4 , 5 Novel mutations in LMAN1 and MCFD2 were identified, including evidence for regulatory mutations that abolish LMAN1 mRNA expression. In addition, we studied the interaction of LMAN1 and MCFD2 in lymphoblasts derived from a patient with the I136T mutation in MCFD2 and a patient with a novel missense mutation in LMAN1 (C475R).

Discussion

We report the analysis of LMAN1 and MCFD2 mutations in 10 previously reported and 10 new F5F8D families. Homozygous MCFD2 and LMAN1 mutations were identified in 12 families. Heterozygous mutations were identified in only one LMAN1 allele in 3 families, all of which exhibit markedly reduced LMAN1 protein expression, indicating the existence of unidentified mutations in the second LMAN1 allele. Of the remaining 5 families, 3 can be explained by misdiagnosis of a similar bleeding disorder. Unidentified mutations in LMAN1 or MCFD2 are likely to explain F5F8D in the remaining 2 families that exhibit linkage to 1 of the 2 loci. Presumably regulatory or splicing mutations in unsequenced portions of the corresponding gene are responsible, though patient-derived cells were not available for further study. Thus, the locus heterogeneity identified in F5F8D appears to be limited to the LMAN1 and MCFD2 genes. These data are consistent with the failure of previous biochemical studies to identify additional components of the LMAN1-MCFD2 receptor complex or this receptor-mediated secretory pathway. 11 Alternatively, mutations in other components of this pathway may exhibit a different phenotype distinct from F5F8D.

Combined with previous reports, at least 25 LMAN1 and 9 MCFD2 mutations have now been identified. Among these, 8 LMAN1 mutations and 3 MCFD2 mutations were identified in multiple families. In addition, 3 families carry unidentified regulatory mutations. No clear genotype/phenotype relationship can be identified to account for variations in FV and FVIII levels among F5F8D patients ( Table 1 ). For example, even for patients homozygous for the same 149 + 5G>A mutation, levels of FV/FVIII varied from 2.3/1.2 to 11/23 ( Table 1 ). 16 Although variability in FV and FVIII assays could contribute, the range of observed values more likely reflects the combined effects of modifier genes for FV/FVIII and environmental factors. Although most reported F5F8D patients are from the Mediterranean region, 3 - 6 , 20 - 22 an increasing number of cases have been identified in other geographic regions. 4 , 5 , 15 , 16 , 23 , 24 A high percentage of F5F8D patients are associated with known consanguinity and/or are homozygous for a single mutation, suggesting that the geographic distribution of this disease is due at least in part to the varying prevalence of consanguineous marriages rather than specific positive selection for heterozygous carriers.

All previously reported LMAN1 mutations were predicted to be null, leading to the speculation that even a trace amount of functional LMAN1 expression may be sufficient to support normal FV and FVIII trafficking. However, we detected a low level of LMAN1-MCFD2 complex in patient lymphoblasts carrying either the LMAN1 C475R mutation (data not shown) or the MCFD2 I136T mutation ( Figure 1 ). The LMAN1-MCFD2 I136T complex may retain residual FVIII-binding activity, since MCFD2 carrying the similar D129E mutation was shown to bind FVIII. 11 The latter observation suggests that a threshold level of LMAN1-MCFD2 activity above that observed for the LMAN1-MCFD2 I136T complex may be required for the intracellular trafficking of FV and FVIII, though we cannot rule out the possibility that the LMAN1-MCFD2 I136T interaction may be further weakened in more relevant cells such as hepatocytes in vivo. These results also suggest that targeting the LMAN1-MCFD2 complex as a therapeutic approach to anticoagulation is likely to require marked reduction of one or both components of this protein complex.
