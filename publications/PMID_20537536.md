Autophagy, a catabolic process responsible for the degradation of cytosolic 
components, is upregulated when nutrient supplies are limited. A critical step 
in autophagy induction comprises the inactivation of a key negative regulator of 
the process, the Ser/Thr kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Thus far, 
only a few substrates of mTOR that control autophagy have been identified, 
including ULK1 and Atg13, both of which function as positive mediators. Here we 
identify death-associated protein 1 (DAP1) as a novel substrate of mTOR that 
negatively regulates autophagy. The link of DAP1 to autophagy was first apparent 
in that its knockdown enhanced autophagic flux and in that it displayed a rapid 
decline in its phosphorylation in response to amino acid starvation. Mapping of 
the phosphorylation sites and analysis of phosphorylation mutants indicated that 
DAP1 is functionally silenced in growing cells through mTOR-dependent 
phosphorylations on Ser3 and Ser51. Inactivation of mTOR during starvation 
caused a rapid reduction in these phosphorylation sites and converted the 
protein into an active suppressor of autophagy. These results are consistent 
with a "Gas and Brake" model in which mTOR inhibition also controls a buffering 
mechanism that counterbalances the autophagic flux and prevents its 
overactivation under nutrient deprivation.
