In plants, a cis-acting element, DRE/CRT, is involved in ABA-independent gene 
expression in response to dehydration and low-temperature stress. To understand 
signal transduction pathways from perception of the dehydration stress signal to 
gene expression, we characterized a gene family for DRE/CRT-binding proteins 
DREB2A and DREB2B in Arabidopsis thaliana. Northern analysis showed that both 
genes are induced by dehydration and high-salt stress. Organ-specific northern 
analysis with gene-specific probes showed that these genes are strongly induced 
in roots by high-salt stress and in stems and roots by dehydration stress. The 
DREB2A gene is located on chromosome 5, and DREB2B on chromosome 3. We screened 
an Arabidopsis genomic DNA library with cDNA fragments of DREB2A and DREB2B as 
probes, and isolated DNA fragments that contained 5'-flanking regions of these 
genes. Sequence analysis showed that both genes are interrupted by a single 
intron at identical positions in their leader sequence. Several conserved 
sequences were found in the promoter regions of both genes. The 
beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene driven by the DREB2 promoters was induced 
by dehydration and high-salt stress in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.
