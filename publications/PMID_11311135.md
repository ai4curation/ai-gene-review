Heterodimeric amino acid transporters are comprised of a type-II membrane 
protein named the heavy chain (4F2hc or rBAT) that may associate with a number 
of different polytopic membrane proteins, called light chains. It is thought 
that the heavy chain is mainly involved in the trafficking of the complex to the 
plasma membrane, whereas the transport process itself is catalysed by the light 
chain. The 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) associates with at least six different light 
chains to induce distinct amino acid-transport activites. To test if the light 
chains are specifically recognized and to identify domains involved in the 
recognition of light chains, C-terminally truncated mutants of 4F2hc were 
constructed and co-expressed with the light chains LAT1, LAT2 and y(+)LAT2. The 
truncated isoform T1, comprised of only 133 amino acids that form the cytosolic 
N-terminus and the transmembrane helix, displayed only a slight reduction in its 
ability to promote LAT1 expression at the membrane surface compared with the 529 
amino acid wild-type 4F2hc protein. Co-expression of increasingly larger 4F2hc 
mutants caused a delayed translocation of LAT1. In contrast to the weak effects 
of 4F2hc truncations on LAT1 expression, surface expression of LAT2 and y(+)LAT2 
was almost completely lost with all truncated heavy chains. Co-expression of 
LAT1 together with the other light chains did not result in displacement of LAT2 
and y(+)LAT2. The results suggest that extracellular domains of the heavy chain 
are responsible mainly for recognition of light chains other than LAT1 and that 
the extracellular domain ensures proper translocation to the plasma membrane.
