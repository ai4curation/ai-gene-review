In mammals, the hormone melatonin is mainly produced by the pineal gland with 
nocturnal peak levels. Its peripheral and central actions rely either on its 
intrinsic antioxidant properties or on binding to melatonin MT1 and MT2 
receptors, belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) super-family. 
Melatonin has been reported to be involved in many functions of the central 
nervous system such as circadian rhythm regulation, neurotransmission, synaptic 
plasticity, memory, sleep, and also in Alzheimer's disease and depression. 
However, little is known about the subcellular localization of melatonin 
receptors and the molecular aspects involved in neuronal functions of melatonin. 
Identification of protein complexes associated with GPCRs has been shown to be a 
valid approach to improve our understanding of their function. By combining 
proteomic and genomic approaches we built an interactome of MT1 and MT2 
receptors, which comprises 378 individual proteins. Among the proteins 
interacting with MT1 , but not with MT2 , we identified several presynaptic 
proteins, suggesting a potential role of MT1 in neurotransmission. Presynaptic 
localization of MT1 receptors in the hypothalamus, striatum, and cortex was 
confirmed by subcellular fractionation experiments and immunofluorescence 
microscopy. MT1 physically interacts with the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav 
2.2 and inhibits Cav 2.2-promoted Ca(2+) entry in an agonist-independent manner. 
In conclusion, we show that MT1 is part of the presynaptic protein network and 
negatively regulates Cav 2.2 activity, providing a first hint for potential 
synaptic functions of MT1.
