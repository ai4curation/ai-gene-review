Transposon jumps are a major cause of genome instability. In the C. elegans 
strain Bristol N2, transposons are active in somatic cells, but they are 
silenced in the germline, presumably to protect the germline from mutations. 
Interestingly, the transposon-silencing mechanism shares factors with the RNAi 
machinery. To better understand the mechanism of transposon silencing, we 
performed a genome-wide RNAi screen for genes that, when silenced, cause 
transposition of Tc1 in the C. elegans germline. We identified 27 such genes, 
among which are mut-16, a mutator that was previously found but not identified 
at the molecular level, ppw-2, a member of the argonaute family, and several 
factors that indicate a role for chromatin structure in the regulation of 
transposition. Some of the newly identified genes are also required for 
cosuppression and therefore represent the shared components of the two pathways. 
Since most of the newly identified genes have clear homologs in other species, 
and since transposons are found from protozoa to human, it seems likely that 
they also protect other genomes against transposon activity in the germline.
