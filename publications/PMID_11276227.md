Here we describe an important involvement of Cdk5/p35 in regulating the gene 
expression of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromuscular synapse. Cdk5 
and p35 were prominently expressed in embryonic muscle, and concentrated at the 
neuromuscular junction in adulthood. Neuregulin increased the p35-associated 
Cdk5 kinase activity in the membrane fraction of cultured C2C12 myotubes. 
Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed the association between Cdk5, p35 and 
ErbB receptors in muscle and cultured myotubes. Inhibition of Cdk5 activity not 
only blocked the NRG-induced AChR transcription, but also attenuated ErbB 
activation in cultured myotubes. In light of our finding that overexpression of 
p35 alone led to an increase in AChR promoter activity in muscle, Cdk5 
activation is sufficient to mediate the up-regulation of AChR gene expression. 
Taken together, these results reveal the unexpected involvement of Cdk5/p35 in 
neuregulin signaling at the neuromuscular synapse.
