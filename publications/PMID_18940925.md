Hec1 (Highly Expressed in Cancer 1) is one of four proteins of the outer 
kinetochore Ndc80 complex involved in the dynamic interface between centromeres 
and spindle microtubules. Its overexpression is seen in a variety of human 
tumors and correlates with tumor grade and prognosis. We show here that the 
overexpression of Hec1 in an inducible mouse model results in mitotic checkpoint 
hyperactivation. As previously observed with overexpression of the Mad2 gene, 
hyperactivation of the mitotic checkpoint leads to aneuploidy in vitro and is 
sufficient to generate tumors in vivo that harbor significant levels of 
aneuploidy. These results underscore the role of chromosomal instability as a 
result of mitotic checkpoint hyperactivation in the initiation of tumorigenesis.
