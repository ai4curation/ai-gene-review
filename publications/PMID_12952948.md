The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nhp6 protein contains a DNA-binding motif that is 
similar to those found in the high mobility group B family of chromatin 
proteins. Nhp6 bound to nucleosomes and made at least two changes in them: the 
nucleosomal DNA became more sensitive to DNase I at specific sites, and the 
nucleosomes became competent to bind Spt16-Pob3 to form yFACT.nucleosome 
complexes. Both changes occurred at similar concentrations of Nhp6, suggesting 
that they reflect the same structural reorganization of the nucleosome. 
Nucleosomes have multiple binding sites for Nhp6, and structural reorganization 
was associated with a concentration of Nhp6 about 10-fold higher than that 
needed for simple binding. We propose that the coordinated action of multiple 
Nhp6 molecules is required to convert nucleosomes to an alternative form as the 
first step in a two-step reorganization of nucleosomes with the second step 
being dependent on Spt16-Pob3. The presence of linker DNA had only subtle 
effects on these processes, indicating that both Nhp6 and yFACT act on core 
nucleosome structure rather than on the interaction between nucleosomes and 
adjacent DNA. These results suggest that Nhp6 and the related high mobility 
group B proteins may have a general role in promoting rearrangements of 
chromatin by initiating the destabilization of core nucleosomal structure.
