Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) inhibits the activity of the anaphase promoting 
complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase that targets 
mitotic regulators for degradation in exit from mitosis. Levels of Emi1 
oscillate in the cell cycle: it accumulates in the S phase and is rapidly 
degraded in prometaphase. The degradation of Emi1 in early mitosis is necessary 
for the activation of APC/C in late mitosis. Previous studies have shown that 
Emi1 is targeted for degradation in mitosis by a Skp1-Cullin1 F-box protein 
(SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex that contains the F-box protein beta-TrCP. As 
with other substrates of SCF(beta-TrCP), the phosphorylation of Emi1 on a DSGxxS 
sequence is required for this process. However, the protein kinase(s) involved 
has not been identified. We find that Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a protein 
kinase that accumulates in mitosis, markedly stimulates the ligation of Emi1 to 
ubiquitin by purified SCF(beta-TrCP). Cdk1-cyclin B, another major mitotic 
protein kinase, has no influence on this process by itself but stimulates the 
action of Plk1 at low, physiological concentrations. Plk1 phosphorylates serine 
residues in the DSGxxS sequence of Emi1, as suggested by the reduced 
phosphorylation of a derivative in which the two serines were mutated to 
nonphosphorylatable amino acids. Transfection with an small interfering RNA 
duplex directed against Plk1 caused the accumulation of Emi1 in mitotically 
arrested HeLa cells. It is suggested that phosphorylation of Emi1 by Plk1 is 
involved in its degradation in mitosis.
