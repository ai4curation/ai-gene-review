Jem1p of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a J-domain containing co-chaperone (J 
protein) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Jem1p is required for nuclear 
fusion during mating (karyogamy) and functions together with another J protein, 
Scj1p, in protein folding and quality control in the ER as a partner for the ER 
Hsp70 (BiP/Kar2p). Candida albicans has a gene encoding a homolog of S. 
cerevisiae Jem1p, CaJem1p. CaJem1p localized in the ER when expressed in S. 
cerevisiae, and expression of CaJem1p from a single-copy plasmid suppressed the 
temperature sensitive growth and the ER quality control defect of the 
jem1Deltascj1Delta mutant, indicating that CaJem1p is functional in S. 
cerevisiae. However, CaJem1p suppressed the karyogamy defect of the 
jem1Deltamutant only when it was over-expressed from a multicopy plasmid. 
Domain-swapping experiments showed that this was due to the difference between 
the N-terminal domains of ScJem1p and CaJem1p. The N-terminal domain of ScJem1p 
is essential for its function and interacts with Nep98p, a component of the 
spindle pole body involved in karyogamy. Since the interaction of CaJem1p with 
Nep98p is weaker than that of ScJem1p, the Nep98p-ScJem1p interaction is likely 
important for promoting karyogamy in S. cerevisiae.
