Amyloid precursor protein (APP), associated with Alzheimer's disease plaques, is 
known to be present in synapses of the brain and in the adult neuromuscular 
junction (NMJ). In the present study we examined protein and gene expression of 
APP during the development of mouse skeletal muscle. Using immunocytochemical 
approaches, we found that APP is first detected in myotube cytoplasm at 
embryonic day 16 and becomes progressively concentrated at the NMJ beginning at 
birth until adulthood. The colocalization between APP and acetylcholine 
receptors at the NMJ is only partial at birth, but becomes complete upon 
reaching adulthood. We observed that all APP isoforms, including the 
Kunitz-containing (protease inhibitor or KPI) forms, are up-regulated from birth 
to postnatal day 5 and then decreased to reach the low levels observed in the 
adult. This suggests the involvement of APP during the events which lead to a 
mature mono-innervated synapse. A 92-kDa band, characteristic of a cleaved 
APP695 isoform and not due to a new muscle-specific alternative spliced form, 
was observed from postnatal day 15 following completion of polyneuronal synapse 
elimination. Taken together, these data suggest that skeletal muscle APP may 
well play a role in the differentiation of skeletal muscle and in the formation 
and maturation of NMJs.
