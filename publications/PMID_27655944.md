In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a small, intergenic region known as the 
recombination enhancer regulates donor selection during mating-type switching 
and also helps shape the conformation of chromosome III. Using an assay that 
detects transient losses of heterochromatic repression, we found that the 
recombination enhancer also acts at a distance in cis to modify the stability of 
gene silencing. In a mating-type-specific manner, the recombination enhancer 
destabilized the heterochromatic repression of a gene located ∼17 kbp away. This 
effect depended on a subregion of the recombination enhancer that is largely 
sufficient to determine donor preference. Therefore, this subregion affects both 
recombination and transcription from a distance. These observations identify a 
rare example of long-range transcriptional regulation in yeast and raise the 
question of whether other cis elements also mediate dual effects on 
recombination and gene expression.
