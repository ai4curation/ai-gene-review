Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
disorder. It is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the 
huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes a mutant HTT protein with a polyglutamine 
(polyQ) expansion at the amino terminus. Here, we demonstrate that WT HTT 
regulates ciliogenesis by interacting through huntingtin-associated protein 1 
(HAP1) with pericentriolar material 1 protein (PCM1). Loss of Htt in mouse cells 
impaired the retrograde trafficking of PCM1 and thereby reduced primary cilia 
formation. In mice, deletion of Htt in ependymal cells led to PCM1 
mislocalization, alteration of the cilia layer, and hydrocephalus. Pathogenic 
polyQ expansion led to centrosomal accumulation of PCM1 and abnormally long 
primary cilia in mouse striatal cells. PCM1 accumulation in ependymal cells was 
associated with longer cilia and disorganized cilia layers in a mouse model of 
HD and in HD patients. Longer cilia resulted in alteration of the cerebrospinal 
fluid flow. Thus, our data indicate that WT HTT is essential for protein 
trafficking to the centrosome and normal ciliogenesis. In HD, hypermorphic 
ciliogenesis may affect signaling and neuroblast migration so as to dysregulate 
brain homeostasis and exacerbate disease progression.

Abstract

Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the huntingtin ( HTT ) gene that encodes a mutant HTT protein with a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion at the amino terminus. Here, we demonstrate that WT HTT regulates ciliogenesis by interacting through huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) with pericentriolar material 1 protein (PCM1). Loss of Htt in mouse cells impaired the retrograde trafficking of PCM1 and thereby reduced primary cilia formation. In mice, deletion of Htt in ependymal cells led to PCM1 mislocalization, alteration of the cilia layer, and hydrocephalus. Pathogenic polyQ expansion led to centrosomal accumulation of PCM1 and abnormally long primary cilia in mouse striatal cells. PCM1 accumulation in ependymal cells was associated with longer cilia and disorganized cilia layers in a mouse model of HD and in HD patients. Longer cilia resulted in alteration of the cerebrospinal fluid flow. Thus, our data indicate that WT HTT is essential for protein trafficking to the centrosome and normal ciliogenesis. In HD, hypermorphic ciliogenesis may affect signaling and neuroblast migration so as to dysregulate brain homeostasis and exacerbate disease progression.

Introduction

Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the pathogenic expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) N-terminal stretch in the huntingtin protein (HTT; encoded by HTT ). HD is characterized by the dysfunction and death of neurons in the brain, leading to devastating cognitive, psychiatric, and motor symptoms in patients. Studies in multiple cell and animal model systems support the notion that polyQ expansion in mutant Htt leads to the gain of new toxic functions and loss of the neuroprotective functions of the WT Htt ( 1 ).

Although some of its functions are linked to transcriptional activities in health and disease, Htt is primarily a cytoplasmic protein that associates with microtubules (MTs) and vesicles. Htt regulates intracellular trafficking of various organelles, including vesicles, by interacting with the dynein/dynactin pathway ( 2 – 4 ). Htt facilitates MT-dependent transport by interacting directly with dynein ( 2 ) and indirectly via huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1), which binds to the dynactin p150 Glued subunit ( 3 , 5 – 7 ). In pathological situations, the Htt-HAP1-dynactin complex is altered, resulting in a reduction of vesicular transport in neurons ( 3 ). These findings show that Htt integrates vesicular transport by regulating the activity of specific protein complexes containing the dynein/dynactin and kinesin 1 complexes and adaptor proteins such as HAP1.

With 2 patterns of axonemal MTs (9 + 0 in primary cilia and 9 + 2 in motile cilia), cilia are involved in sensory role, motility, and flow generation. Within the last 5 years, the importance of this organelle was highlighted by linking mutations within proteins of the cilia and ciliary basal bodies to a class of complex syndromes now termed ciliopathies (reviewed in 8 ). Whereas primary cilium originates from the mother centriole of the centrosome, which becomes the basal body, motile cilia of multiciliated or ependymal cells rely on the massive de novo formation of basal bodies from fibrous aggregates termed deuterosomes. Although they have different functions, primary and motile cilia share common properties. Cilia biogenesis depends on the trafficking of protein complexes to the pericentriolar material (PCM), a nonmembranous protein lattice that surrounds the centrioles and serves as a structural matrix to nucleate and anchor MTs. Pericentriolar material 1 protein (PCM1) is the major component of the centriolar satellites that shuttle between the cytoplasm and the PCM along MT in a dynein-dependent manner ( 9 ).

Proper trafficking and localization of PCM proteins such as PCM1 regulates ciliogenesis. Depleting PCM1 reduces ciliogenesis, and knockdown or mutation of BBS4 leads to PCM1 mislocalization and reduced ciliation both in vitro and in vivo ( 10 – 12 ). Mutation of CEP290, which underlies Joubert syndrome and results in a ciliopathy, depletes PCM1 from the centrosome and reduces ciliogenesis ( 10 ). These studies highlight the role of PCM1 trafficking for proper cilia biogenesis. Interestingly, PCM1 has been reported to interact with HAP1 ( 5 ), suggestive of a possible link between Htt and PCM1.

In the brain ventricles, motile cilia play a crucial role in circulating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inside the brain cavities. CSF is produced largely by the choroid plexus (CP) and circulates from the lateral to the third and fourth ventricles and then into the spinal and subarachnoid spaces ( 13 ). CSF contains ions, nutrients, neuroendocrine factors, and neurotransmitters, and a key function of its flow is the clearance of brain catabolites. The total CSF volume is about 160 ml in humans, and this is replaced about 4 times per day, illustrating the important role of CSF circulation in brain homeostasis. However, in the aging CNS and in Alzheimer disease, CSF flow and turnover are reduced, resulting in a reduced clearance of potentially toxic catabolites ( 13 ). Altered CSF production from the CP ( 14 ) or defects in ependymal flow as a result of dysmotile cilia ( 15 ) result in aqueduct stenosis and hydrocephalus. In mice, specific deletion of Htt in the Wnt-1 lineage results in congenital hydrocephalus, which suggests that Htt could play a role in the regulation of CSF homeostasis ( 16 ).

We demonstrate here that Htt localizes at the centrosome through an MT-dependent transport and forms a complex with PCM1 and HAP1 proteins. Depletion of Htt or HAP1 led to dispersion of PCM1 from centrosomes and reduced ciliogenesis in cells. Ablation of Htt in the Wnt-1 lineage reduced ciliogenesis in vivo and led to hydrocephalus in mice. In contrast, pathological polyQ expansion concentrated PCM1 at the centrosome, resulting in increased ciliogenesis. Finally, abnormal ciliation of the ependymal layer in the wall of the lateral ventricles in HD knockin mice and in HD patients was associated with asynchronous beating of the cilia and abnormal CSF flow in HD mice.
