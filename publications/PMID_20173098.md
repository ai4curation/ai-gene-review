In unstressed cells, the tumor suppressor p53 is maintained at low levels by 
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis mainly through Mdm2. In response to DNA damage, 
p53 is stabilized and becomes activated to turn on transcriptional programs that 
are essential for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Activation of p53 leads to 
accumulation of Mdm2 protein, a direct transcriptional target of p53. It is not 
understood how p53 is protected from degradation when Mdm2 is up-regulated. Here 
we report that p53 stabilization in the late phase after ionizing radiation 
correlates with active ubiquitination. We found that an E3 ubiquitin ligase 
RFWD3 (RNF201/FLJ10520) forms a complex with Mdm2 and p53 to synergistically 
ubiquitinate p53 and is required to stabilize p53 in the late response to DNA 
damage. This process is regulated by the DNA damage checkpoint, because RFWD3 is 
phosphorylated by ATM/ATR kinases and the phosphorylation mutant fails to 
stimulate p53 ubiquitination. In vitro experiments suggest that RFWD3 is a p53 
E3 ubiquitin ligase and that RFWD3-Mdm2 complex restricts the polyubiquitination 
of p53 by Mdm2. Our study identifies RFWD3 as a positive regulator of p53 
stability when the G(1) cell cycle checkpoint is activated and provides an 
explanation for how p53 is protected from degradation in the presence of high 
levels of Mdm2.

Abstract

In unstressed cells, the tumor suppressor p53 is maintained at low levels by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis mainly through Mdm2. In response to DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and becomes activated to turn on transcriptional programs that are essential for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Activation of p53 leads to accumulation of Mdm2 protein, a direct transcriptional target of p53. It is not understood how p53 is protected from degradation when Mdm2 is up-regulated. Here we report that p53 stabilization in the late phase after ionizing radiation correlates with active ubiquitination. We found that an E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD3 (RNF201/FLJ10520) forms a complex with Mdm2 and p53 to synergistically ubiquitinate p53 and is required to stabilize p53 in the late response to DNA damage. This process is regulated by the DNA damage checkpoint, because RFWD3 is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR kinases and the phosphorylation mutant fails to stimulate p53 ubiquitination. In vitro experiments suggest that RFWD3 is a p53 E3 ubiquitin ligase and that RFWD3â€“Mdm2 complex restricts the polyubiquitination of p53 by Mdm2. Our study identifies RFWD3 as a positive regulator of p53 stability when the G 1 cell cycle checkpoint is activated and provides an explanation for how p53 is protected from degradation in the presence of high levels of Mdm2.
