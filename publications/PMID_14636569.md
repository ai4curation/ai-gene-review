We have isolated a holoenzyme complex termed BRCC containing BRCA1, BRCA2, and 
RAD51. BRCC not only displays increased association with p53 following DNA 
damage but also ubiquitinates p53 in vitro. BRCC36 and BRCC45 are novel 
components of the complex with sequence homology to a subunit of the signalosome 
and proteasome complexes. Reconstitution of a recombinant four-subunit complex 
containing BRCA1/BARD1/BRCC45/BRCC36 revealed an enhanced E3 ligase activity 
compared to that of BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer. In vivo, depletion of BRCC36 and 
BRCC45 by the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) resulted in increased sensitivity 
to ionizing radiation and defects in G2/M checkpoint. BRCC36 shows aberrant 
expression in sporadic breast tumors. These findings identify BRCC as a 
ubiquitin E3 ligase complex that enhances cellular survival following DNA 
damage.
