A cDNA clone encoding a human cytosolic thyroid hormone-binding protein (p58) 
has been isolated. The human sequence was found to be homologous to that of rat 
pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) subtype M2. p58 is a monomer that has 
approximately 5% the enzymatic activity of the tetrameric pyruvate kinase M2. 
The tetrameric M2 does not bind 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). Binding of p58 
to T3 and its analogs resulted in the inhibition of its pyruvate kinase 
activity. The apparent Ki values of T3, L-thyroxine, and D-T3 are 30 nM, 100 nM, 
and 2 mM, respectively. L-Thyronine and 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine had no 
effect. This order of activity correlates with the thermogenic effects reported 
for T3 and its analogs. Conversion of p58 to the tetramer is reversible and is 
under the control of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The conversion is inhibited by 
T3 in a dose-dependent manner. Since pyruvate kinase is a key enzyme in 
regulating cellular ADP, ATP, and pyruvate, our findings suggest that p58 may be 
involved in mediating some of the cellular metabolic effects induced by thyroid 
hormones.
