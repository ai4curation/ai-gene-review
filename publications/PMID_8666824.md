Calreticulin (CR) is a multifunctional, calcium-binding protein that has 
recently been shown to bind to and promote the replication of the rubella virus 
genome in mammalian cells. While CR is now widely recognized as a new human 
autoantigen, the relationship between CR and the Ro/SS-A ribonucleo-protein 
(RNP) autoantigen has been somewhat controversial. In this work, we demonstrate 
that unphosphorylated human rCR binds specifically and distinctly to in vitro 
transcribed forms of hYRNA, the RNA backbone of the Ro/SS-A RNP particle. This 
interaction appears to be mediated by binding through the N- and C-terminal 
domains of CR, but not by the central proline-rich domain. Furthermore, our 
studies indicate that CR can facilitate the binding of the 60-kDa polypeptide 
component of the Ro/SS-A RNP (Ro60) to hYRNA. In addition, CR and the 52-kDa 
Ro/SS-A polypeptide (Ro52) appear to be capable of interacting through direct 
protein-protein binding. These studies confirm that CR is an hYRNA-binding 
protein, and provide for the first time a molecular mechanism by which Ro52 can 
be linked physically to hYRNA. Through these molecular interactions and its 
known functional role as a chaperone, it is suggested that CR plays a supportive 
role in the formation of the Ro/SS-A RNP complex. The capacity of CR to interact 
with RNA viruses such as rubella provides an additional argument for an 
infectious trigger for autoantibody production against self RNP particles such 
as Ro/SS-A.
