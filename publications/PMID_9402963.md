We have identified mutations in the phosphorylase kinase (Phk) beta subunit gene 
in a male patient with liver glycogenosis caused by Phk deficiency. The 
patient's DNA has been analyzed for mutations in the genes encoding the alpha L, 
beta, and gamma TL subunits of Phk, all of which can be responsible for liver 
glycogenosis, by a strategy primarily based on reverse transcription/polymerase 
chain reaction of blood RNA and complemented by analysis of genomic DNA. His 
alpha L and gamma TL coding sequences are normal, whereas he is 
compound-heterozygous for two mutations in the beta subunit gene, PHKB. The 
first is a splice-site mutation (IVS4 [-2A-->G]) causing the 
reading-frame-disrupting deletion of exon 5 in the mRNA from this allele. The 
second is an Ala117Pro missense mutation, also in exon 5. This is the first 
missense mutation identified in PHKB, as opposed to nine translation-terminating 
mutations described to date. It offers an explanation for the unique biochemical 
phenotype of this patient. In his leukocytes, low Phk activity is measured when 
tested with the endogenous liver isoform of phosphorylase as the protein 
substrate, but normal activity is observed when tested with muscle phosphorylase 
added in vitro. In contrast, Phk activity in his erythrocytes is low with both 
substrates. The missense mutation may selectively impair the interaction of Phk 
with one isoform of its substrate protein and may destabilize the enzyme in a 
cell-type-specific way. This phenotype shares some aspects with X-linked liver 
glycogenosis subtype 2 (XLG2), a variant of liver Phk deficiency arising from 
missense mutations in the alpha L subunit gene (PHKA2), but differs from XLG2 in 
other respects. The present case demonstrates that mutations in Phk genes other 
than PHKA2 can also be associated with untypically high activity in certain 
blood cell types. Moreover, it emphasizes that missense mutations in Phk may 
cause unusual patterns of tissue involvement that would not be predicted a 
priori from the tissue specificity of expression of the mutated gene sequences.
