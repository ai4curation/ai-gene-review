interacts with the extracellular matrix protein 1 in the dermal epidermal 
junction zone of human skin.

We examined the interaction of ECM1 (extracellular matrix protein 1) using yeast 
two-hybrid screening and identified the type II transmembrane protein, PLSCR1 
(phospholipid scramblase 1), as a binding partner. This interaction was then 
confirmed by in vitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and 
additional pull-down experiments with GST-tagged ECM1a fragments localized this 
interaction to occur within the tandem repeat region of ECM1a. Furthermore, 
immunohistochemical staining revealed a partial overlap of ECM1 and PLSCR1 in 
human skin at the basal epidermal cell layer. Moreover, in human skin 
equivalents, both proteins are expressed at the basal membrane in a dermal 
fibroblast-dependent manner. Next, immunogold electron microscopy of ultrathin 
human skin sections showed that ECM1 and PLSCR1 co-localize in the extracellular 
matrix, and using antibodies against ECM1 or PLSCR1 cross-linked to magnetic 
immunobeads, we were able to demonstrate PLSCR1-ECM1 interaction in human skin 
extracts. Furthermore, whereas ECM1 is secreted by the 
endoplasmic/Golgi-dependent pathway, PLSCR1 release from HaCaT keratinocytes 
occurs via a lipid raft-dependent mechanism, and is deposited in the 
extracellular matrix. In summary, we here demonstrate that PLSCR1 interacts with 
the tandem repeat region of ECM1a in the dermal epidermal junction zone of human 
skin and provide for the first time experimental evidence that PLSCR1 is 
secreted by an unconventional secretion pathway. These data suggest that PLSCR1 
is a multifunctional protein that can function both inside and outside of the 
cell and together with ECM1 may play a regulatory role in human skin.
