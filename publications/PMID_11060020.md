Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are cofactors found in many proteins that have 
important redox, catalytic or regulatory functions. In mammalian cells, almost 
all known Fe-S proteins are found in the mitochondria, but at least one is found 
in the cytosol. Here we report cloning of the human homologs to IscU and NifU, 
iron-binding proteins that play a critical role in Fe-S cluster assembly in 
bacteria. In human cells, alternative splicing of a common pre-mRNA results in 
synthesis of two proteins that differ at the N-terminus and localize either to 
the cytosol (IscU1) or to the mitochondria (IscU2). Biochemical analyses 
demonstrate that IscU proteins specifically associate with IscS, a cysteine 
desulfurase that is proposed to sequester inorganic sulfur for Fe-S cluster 
assembly. Protein complexes containing IscU and IscS can be found in the 
mitochondria as well as in the cytosol, implying that Fe-S cluster assembly 
takes place in multiple subcellular compartments in mammalian cells. The 
possible roles of the IscU proteins in mammalian cells and the potential 
implications of compartmentalization of Fe-S cluster assembly are discussed.
