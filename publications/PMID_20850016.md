Trimethyl-lysine (me3) modifications on histones are the most stable epigenetic 
marks and they control chromatin-mediated regulation of gene expression. Here, 
we determine proteins that bind these marks by high-accuracy, quantitative mass 
spectrometry. These chromatin "readers" are assigned to complexes by interaction 
proteomics of full-length BAC-GFP-tagged proteins. ChIP-Seq profiling identifies 
their genomic binding sites, revealing functional properties. Among the main 
findings, the human SAGA complex binds to H3K4me3 via a double Tudor-domain in 
the C terminus of Sgf29, and the PWWP domain is identified as a putative 
H3K36me3 binding motif. The ORC complex, including LRWD1, binds to the three 
most prominent transcriptional repressive lysine methylation sites. Our data 
reveal a highly adapted interplay between chromatin marks and their associated 
protein complexes. Reading specific trimethyl-lysine sites by specialized 
complexes appears to be a widespread mechanism to mediate gene expression.
