Glutamine-rich sequences exist in a wide range of proteins across multiple 
species. A subset of glutamine-rich sequences has been shown to form amyloid 
fibers implicated in human diseases. The physiological functions of these 
sequence motifs are not well understood, partly because of the lack of 
structural information. Here we have determined a high-resolution structure of a 
glutamine-rich domain from human histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) by x-ray 
crystallography. The glutamine-rich domain of HDAC4 (19 glutamines of 68 
residues) folds into a straight alpha-helix that assembles as a tetramer. In 
contrast to most coiled coil proteins, the HDAC4 tetramer lacks regularly 
arranged apolar residues and an extended hydrophobic core. Instead, the protein 
interfaces consist of multiple hydrophobic patches interspersed with polar 
interaction networks, wherein clusters of glutamines engage in extensive intra- 
and interhelical interactions. In solution, the HDAC4 tetramer undergoes rapid 
equilibrium with monomer and intermediate species. Structure-guided mutations 
that expand or disrupt hydrophobic patches drive the equilibrium toward the 
tetramer or monomer, respectively. We propose that a general role of 
glutamine-rich motifs be to mediate protein-protein interactions characteristic 
of a large component of polar interaction networks that may facilitate 
reversible assembly and disassembly of protein complexes.
