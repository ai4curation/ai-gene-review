Iron homeostasis is maintained through meticulous regulation of circulating 
hepcidin levels. Hepcidin levels that are inappropriately low or high result in 
iron overload or iron deficiency, respectively. Although hypoxia, erythroid 
demand, iron, and inflammation are all known to influence hepcidin expression, 
the mechanisms responsible are not well defined. In this report we show that the 
inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) directly regulates hepcidin through 
induction and subsequent promoter binding of signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3 is necessary and sufficient for the IL-6 
responsiveness of the hepcidin promoter. Our findings provide a mechanism by 
which hepcidin can be regulated by inflammation or, in the absence of 
inflammatory stimuli, by alternative mechanisms leading to STAT3 activation.
