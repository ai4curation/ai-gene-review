In most mammals, the sexually dimorphic development of embryos is typically 
achieved by the differentiation of the external genitalia. Hence, the sexual 
distinction of mammalian newborns is based on the external genital structure. 
Although it was shown in the 1940s and 1950s that androgen from the testes 
establishes the male sexual characteristics, the involvement of nongonadal and 
locally produced masculine effectors remains totally unknown. It is noteworthy 
that the disorders of fetal masculinization, including hypospadias, one of the 
most frequent birth defects, occur at a high frequency. Furthermore, their 
causative factors remain unclear. In this study, the involvement of the 
coordinated actions of androgen and the growth factor systems was genetically 
analyzed for the first time on mammalian reproductive organ formation. The 
results demonstrated that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is indispensable 
masculine factor for the external genital development. The bilateral mesenchymal 
region adjacent to the urethral plate epithelium displayed a sexually dimorphic 
activity of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Loss- and gain-of-function beta-catenin 
mutants displayed altered sexual development of the external genitalia. These 
results indicate the novel functions of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway as a 
locally expressed masculine effector. This could be the first genetic study 
analyzing the roles of the genetic interactions between androgen and locally 
expressed growth factor signaling during the development of reproductive organs. 
These results also shed new insight on the reproductive genetics and the 
causative factors of genital disorders.

Abstract

In most mammals, the sexually dimorphic development of embryos is typically achieved by the differentiation of the external genitalia. Hence, the sexual distinction of mammalian newborns is based on the external genital structure. Although it was shown in the 1940s and 1950s that androgen from the testes establishes the male sexual characteristics, the involvement of nongonadal and locally produced masculine effectors remains totally unknown. It is noteworthy that the disorders of fetal masculinization, including hypospadias, one of the most frequent birth defects, occur at a high frequency. Furthermore, their causative factors remain unclear. In this study, the involvement of the coordinated actions of androgen and the growth factor systems was genetically analyzed for the first time on mammalian reproductive organ formation. The results demonstrated that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is indispensable masculine factor for the external genital development. The bilateral mesenchymal region adjacent to the urethral plate epithelium displayed a sexually dimorphic activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Loss- and gain-of-function β-catenin mutants displayed altered sexual development of the external genitalia. These results indicate the novel functions of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a locally expressed masculine effector. This could be the first genetic study analyzing the roles of the genetic interactions between androgen and locally expressed growth factor signaling during the development of reproductive organs. These results also shed new insight on the reproductive genetics and the causative factors of genital disorders.
