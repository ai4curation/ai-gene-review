Fructosamine 3-kinase, which phosphorylates low-molecular-mass and protein-bound 
fructosamines on the third carbon of their deoxyfructose moiety, is quite active 
in erythrocytes, and was proposed to initiate a process removing fructosamine 
residues from proteins. In the present study, we show that incubation of human 
erythrocytes with 200 mM glucose not only caused the progressive formation of 
glycated haemoglobin, but also increased the level of an anionic form of 
haemoglobin containing alkali-labile phosphate, to approx. 5% of total 
haemoglobin. 1-Deoxy-1-morpholinofructose (DMF), a substrate and competitive 
inhibitor of fructosamine 3-kinase, doubled the rate of accumulation of glycated 
haemoglobin, but markedly decreased the amount of haemoglobin containing 
alkali-labile phosphate. The latter corresponds therefore to haemoglobin bound 
to a fructosamine 3-phosphate group (FN3P-Hb). Returning erythrocytes incubated 
with 200 mM glucose and DMF to a low-glucose medium devoid of DMF caused a 
decrease in the amount of glycated haemoglobin, a transient increase in FN3P-Hb 
and a net decrease in the sum (glycated haemoglobin+FN3P-Hb). These effects were 
prevented by DMF, indicating that fructosamine 3-kinase is involved in the 
removal of fructosamine residues. The second step of this 'deglycation' process 
is most likely a spontaneous decomposition of the fructosamine 3-phosphate 
residues to a free amine, 3-deoxyglucosone and P(i). This is consistent with the 
findings that 2-oxo-3-deoxygluconate, the product of 3-deoxyglucosone oxidation, 
is formed in erythrocytes incubated for 2 days with 200 mM glucose in a 
sufficient amount to account for the removal of fructosamine residues from 
proteins, and that DMF appears to inhibit the formation of 
2-oxo-3-deoxygluconate from elevated glucose concentrations.
