The chromatin high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) is a very abundant and 
conserved protein that is structured into two HMG box domains plus a highly 
acidic C-terminal domain. From the ability to bind DNA nonspecifically and to 
interact with various proteins, several functions in DNA-related processes have 
been assigned to HMGB1. Nevertheless, its functional role remains the subject of 
controversy. Using a phage display approach we have shown that HMGB1 can 
recognize several peptide motifs. A computer search of the protein data bases 
found peptide homologies with proteins already known to interact with HMGB1, 
like p53, and have allowed us to identify new potential candidates. Among them, 
transcriptional activators like the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K 
(hnRNP K), repressors like methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), and 
co-repressors like the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (pRb) and 
Groucho-related gene proteins 1 (Grg1) and 5 (Grg5) can be found. A detailed 
analysis of the interaction of Grg1 with HMGB1 confirmed that the binding region 
contained the sequence homologous to one of the peptides identified. Our results 
have led us to propose that HMGB1 may play a central role in the stabilization 
and/or assembly of several multifunctional complexes through protein-protein 
interactions.
