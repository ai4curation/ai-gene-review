Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are produced in high amounts during Alzheimer's 
disease, causing synaptic and memory dysfunction. However, they are also 
released in lower amounts in normal brains throughout life during synaptic 
activity. Here we show that low picomolar concentrations of a preparation 
containing both Abeta(42) monomers and oligomers cause a marked increase of 
hippocampal long-term potentiation, whereas high nanomolar concentrations lead 
to the well established reduction of potentiation. Picomolar levels of Abeta(42) 
also produce a pronounced enhancement of both reference and contextual fear 
memory. The mechanism of action of picomolar Abeta(42) on both synaptic 
plasticity and memory involves alpha7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors. These findings strongly support a model for Abeta effects in which 
low concentrations play a novel positive, modulatory role on neurotransmission 
and memory, whereas high concentrations play the well known detrimental effect 
culminating in dementia.
