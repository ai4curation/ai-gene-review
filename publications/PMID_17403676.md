Rin1, the prototype of a new family of multidomain Rab5 exchange factors, has 
been shown to play an important role in the endocytosis of the epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR). Herein, we examined the role of Rin1 in the 
down-regulation of EGFR following EGF stimulation. We observed that 
overexpression of Rin1 accelerates EGFR degradation in EGF-stimulated cells. In 
concordance, depletion of endogenous Rin1 by RNA interference resulted in a 
substantial reduction of EGFR degradation. We showed that Rin1 interacts with 
signal-transducing adaptor molecule 2 (STAM2), a protein that associates with 
hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate and plays a key role in the 
endosomal sorting machinery. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rin1 co-localizes 
with hemagglutinin (HA)-STAM2 and with endogenous hepatocyte growth 
factor-regulated substrate. Furthermore, wild type STAM2, but not a deletion 
mutant lacking the SH3 domain, co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous Rin1. This 
interaction is dependent on the proline-rich domain (PRD) of Rin1 as 
Rin1DeltaPRD, a mutant lacking the PRD, does not interact with STAM2. Moreover, 
EGFR degradation was not accelerated by expression of the Rin1DeltaPRD mutant. 
Together these results suggest that Rin1 regulates EGFR degradation in 
cooperation with STAM, defining a novel role for Rin1 in regulating endosomal 
trafficking.
