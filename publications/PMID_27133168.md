Across eukaryotic species, mild mitochondrial stress can have beneficial effects 
on the lifespan of organisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction activates an unfolded 
protein response (UPR(mt)), a stress signaling mechanism designed to ensure 
mitochondrial homeostasis. Perturbation of mitochondria during larval 
development in C. elegans not only delays aging but also maintains UPR(mt) 
signaling, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism that modulates both longevity and 
mitochondrial proteostasis throughout life. We identify the conserved histone 
lysine demethylases jmjd-1.2/PHF8 and jmjd-3.1/JMJD3 as positive regulators of 
lifespan in response to mitochondrial dysfunction across species. Reduction of 
function of the demethylases potently suppresses longevity and UPR(mt) 
induction, while gain of function is sufficient to extend lifespan in a 
UPR(mt)-dependent manner. A systems genetics approach in the BXD mouse reference 
population further indicates conserved roles of the mammalian orthologs in 
longevity and UPR(mt) signaling. These findings illustrate an evolutionary 
conserved epigenetic mechanism that determines the rate of aging downstream of 
mitochondrial perturbations.
