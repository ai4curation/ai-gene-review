Protein N-glycosylation is an essential modification that occurs in all 
eukaryotes and is catalysed by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) in the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Comparative studies have clearly shown that eukaryotic 
STT3 proteins alone can fulfil the enzymatic requirements for N-glycosylation, 
yet in many cases STT3 homologues form stable complexes with a variety of 
non-catalytic OST subunits. Whereas some of these additional components might 
play a structural role, others appear to increase or modulate N-glycosylation 
efficiency for certain precursors. Here, we have analysed the roles of three 
non-catalytic mammalian OST components by studying the consequences of 
subunit-specific knockdowns on the stability and enzymatic activity of the OST 
complex. Our results demonstrate that OST48 and DAD1 are required for the 
assembly of both STT3A- and STT3B-containing OST complexes. The structural 
perturbations of these complexes we observe in OST48- and DAD1-depleted cells 
underlie their pronounced hypoglycosylation phenotypes. Thus, OST48 and DAD1 are 
global modulators of OST stability and hence N-glycosylation. We show that KCP2 
also influences protein N-glycosylation, yet in this case, the effect of its 
depletion is substrate specific, and is characterised by the accumulation of a 
novel STT3A-containing OST subcomplex. Our results suggest that KCP2 acts to 
selectively enhance the OST-dependent processing of specific protein precursors, 
most likely co-translational substrates of STT3A-containing complexes, 
highlighting the potential for increased complexity of OST subunit composition 
in higher eukaryotes.
