Targeting of newly synthesized membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum is 
an essential cellular process. Most membrane proteins are recognized and 
targeted co-translationally by the signal recognition particle. However, nearly 
5% of membrane proteins are 'tail-anchored' by a single carboxy-terminal 
transmembrane domain that cannot access the co-translational pathway. Instead, 
tail-anchored proteins are targeted post-translationally by a conserved ATPase 
termed Get3. The mechanistic basis for tail-anchored protein recognition or 
targeting by Get3 is not known. Here we present crystal structures of yeast Get3 
in 'open' (nucleotide-free) and 'closed' (ADP.AlF(4)(-)-bound) dimer states. In 
the closed state, the dimer interface of Get3 contains an enormous hydrophobic 
groove implicated by mutational analyses in tail-anchored protein binding. In 
the open state, Get3 undergoes a striking rearrangement that disrupts the groove 
and shields its hydrophobic surfaces. These data provide a molecular mechanism 
for nucleotide-regulated binding and release of tail-anchored proteins during 
their membrane targeting by Get3.
