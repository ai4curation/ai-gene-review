Defects of the NADH dehydrogenase complex are predominantly manifested in 
mitochondrial diseases and are significantly associated with the development of 
many late onset neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Here we 
describe an immunocapture procedure for isolating this multisubunit 
membrane-bound complex from human tissue. Using small amounts of immunoisolated 
protein, one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, 
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) peptide 
mass finger printing (PMF), and nanoflow liquid chromatography mass 
spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we can resolve and identify the human 
homologues of 42 polypeptides detected so far in the more extensively studied 
beef heart complex I. These polypeptides include the GRIM-19 protein, which is 
claimed to be involved in apoptosis, a polypeptide first identified by gene 
screening as a neuronal protein, as well as a protein thought to be in 
differentiation linked processes. The concordance of data from human and bovine 
complex I isolated by different procedures adds to the certainty that these 
novel proteins of seemingly diverse function are a part of complex I.
