Single-layered embryonic skin either stratifies to form epidermis or responds to 
Wnt signaling (stabilized beta-catenin) to form hair follicles. Postnatally, 
stem cells continue to differentially use Wnt signaling in long-term tissue 
homeostasis. We have discovered that embryonic progenitor cells and postnatal 
hair follicle stem cells coexpress Tcf3 and Tcf4, which can act as 
transcriptional activators or repressors. Using loss-of-function studies and 
transcriptional analyses, we uncovered consequences to the absence of Tcf3 and 
Tcf4 in skin that only partially overlap with those caused by beta-catenin 
deficiency. We established roles for Tcf3 and Tcf4 in long-term maintenance and 
wound repair of both epidermis and hair follicles, suggesting that Tcf proteins 
have both Wnt-dependent and Wnt-independent roles in lineage determination.

Abstract

Single-layered embryonic skin either stratifies to form epidermis or responds to Wnt signaling (stabilized β-catenin) to form hair follicles. Postnatally, stem cells continue to differentially use Wnt signaling in long-term tissue homeostasis. We have discovered that embryonic progenitor cells and postnatal hair follicle stem cells coexpress Tcf3 and Tcf4, which can act as transcriptional activators or repressors. Using loss-of-function studies and transcriptional analyses, we uncovered consequences to the absence of Tcf3 and Tcf4 in skin that only partially overlap with those caused by β-catenin deficiency. We established roles for Tcf3 and Tcf4 in long-term maintenance and wound repair of both epidermis and hair follicles, suggesting that Tcf proteins have both Wnt-dependent and Wnt-independent roles in lineage determination.

Discussion

Canonical Wnt signaling has been implicated in a diverse array of cellular functions, including stem cell proliferation and self-renewal 21 – 23 ; stem cell activation, fate determination and differentiation 9 , 11 – 13 ; and aging and senescence 24 – 28 . Stabilized β-catenin acts as a transcriptional cofactor for Tcf3, Tcf4, Tcf1 and Lef1, as well as other DNA binding proteins 1 , 21 . In this regard, the early signs of hair follicle morphogenesis seen in Tcf3/4 -null skin, but not in the β-catenin conditional-null counterpart, were notable and consistent with the known presence of Lef1 in the embryonic skin. The established role of Lef1 in the Wnt signaling cross-talk that contributes to the initiation steps in hair follicle morphogenesis 29 provides an explanation for the more severe consequences of β-catenin loss compared to Tcf3 and Tcf4 loss during these early stages of skin development 2 , 11 , 30

Toward the end of embryogenesis, however, the expression of Lef1 diverges from that of Tcf3 and Tcf4, exposing essential functions for Tcf3 and Tcf4. These roles were relatively slow to emerge, and in some cases only became obvious after grafting, when hair follicles disappeared altogether. That said, the mildest and more frequently observed Tcf3- and Tcf4-deficient hair follicle phenotype was remarkably similar to the most severe Sox9-deficient phenotype, in which hair follicle morphogenesis progresses until about P4 and then arrests, resulting in a complete absence of hair follicles in the ensuing post-natal hair cycle 6 . Notably, all three transcription factors mark the long-term, self-renewing stem cells of the hair follicle. These stem cells are essential to postnatal completion of hair follicle morphogenesis as well as the subsequent cyclic bouts of hair regeneration throughout the life of the animal. The coexpression of these genes and the similarities in Tcf3/4 -null and Sox9-deficient hair follicle phenotypes points to a crucial role for Tcf3 and Tcf4 in hair follicle stem cell maintenance. Additionally, these new data suggest that Tcf3 and Tcf4 are the key transcription factors that collaborate with β-catenin in its established role in hair follicle stem cell activation 9 , 12 , 13 .

A surprising feature of Tcf3/4 -null skin was its inability to maintain long-term epidermal homeostasis. Although we did detect low levels of Tcf3 and Tcf4 transcripts and Tcf4 protein in some resident postnatal epidermal cells, Tcf3 and Tcf4 were much more prominent in embryonic than postnatal epidermis. This raises the question of whether long-term epidermal progenitors are specified before birth, as we recently showed for hair follicle stem cells 6 . Another intriguing aspect of these epidermal defects is that they are not seen in mice 15 or in skin grafts (described above) conditionally targeted for β-catenin. These observations, coupled with our transgenic and transcriptional comparisons, suggest that these differences might be partly rooted in the ability of these Tcf proteins to act not only in Wnt signaling, but also as repressors when β-catenin is low or absent. Overall, our data support the notion that Tcf3 and Tcf4 may be essential for establishing and maintaining all skin epithelial stem cells through Wnt-dependent and Wnt-independent roles.
