We identified nucleophosmin/B23 as a component of template-activating factor-III 
that stimulates the DNA replication from the adenovirus DNA complexed with viral 
basic core proteins. Here, we have studied the functional interaction of B23 
with viral core proteins. We found that B23 interacts with viral basic core 
proteins, core protein V and precursor of core protein VII (pre-VII), in 
infected cells. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that B23 suppresses formation 
of aggregates between DNA and core proteins and transfers pre-VII to DNA. These 
results indicate that B23 functions as a chaperone in the viral chromatin 
assembly process in infected cells.
