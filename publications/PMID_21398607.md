Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional APCs that reside in peripheral tissues 
and survey the body for pathogens. Upon activation by inflammatory signals, DCs 
undergo a maturation process and migrate to lymphoid organs, where they present 
pathogen-derived Ags to T cells. DC migration depends on tight regulation of the 
actin cytoskeleton to permit rapid adaptation to environmental cues. We 
investigated the role of hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1), 
the hematopoietic homolog of cortactin, in regulating the actin cytoskeleton of 
murine DCs. HS1 localized to lamellipodial protrusions and podosomes, actin-rich 
structures associated with adhesion and migration. DCs from HS1(-/-) mice showed 
aberrant lamellipodial dynamics. Moreover, although these cells formed 
recognizable podosomes, their podosome arrays were loosely packed and improperly 
localized within the cell. HS1 interacts with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein 
(WASp), another key actin-regulatory protein, through mutual binding to 
WASp-interacting protein. Comparative analysis of DCs deficient for HS1, WASp or 
both proteins revealed unique roles for these proteins in regulating podosomes 
with WASp being essential for podosome formation and with HS1 ensuring efficient 
array organization. WASp recruitment to podosome cores was independent of HS1, 
whereas HS1 recruitment required Src homology 3 domain-dependent interactions 
with the WASp/WASp-interacting protein heterodimer. In migration assays, the 
phenotypes of HS1- and WASp-deficient DCs were related, but distinct. WASp(-/y) 
DCs migrating in a chemokine gradient showed a large decrease in velocity and 
diminished directional persistence. In contrast, HS1(-/-) DCs migrated faster 
than wild-type cells, but directional persistence was significantly reduced. 
These studies show that HS1 functions in concert with WASp to fine-tune DC 
cytoarchitecture and direct cell migration.
