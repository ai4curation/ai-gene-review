Axin and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein are 
components of the Wnt/Wingless growth factor signaling pathway. In the absence 
of Wnt signal, Axin and APC regulate cytoplasmic levels of the proto-oncogene 
beta-catenin through the formation of a large complex containing these three 
proteins, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and several other proteins. 
Both Axin and APC are known to be critical for beta-catenin regulation, and 
truncations in APC that eliminate the Axin-binding site result in human cancers. 
A protease-resistant domain of Axin that contains the APC-binding site is a 
member of the regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) superfamily. The crystal 
structures of this domain alone and in complex with an Axin-binding sequence 
from APC reveal that the Axin-APC interaction occurs at a conserved groove on a 
face of the protein that is distinct from the G-protein interface of classical 
RGS proteins. The molecular interactions observed in the Axin-APC complex 
provide a rationale for the evolutionary conservation seen in both proteins.
