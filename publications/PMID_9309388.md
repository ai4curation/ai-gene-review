the homologous Rer1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Sec12p is a type II membrane glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is essential for transport vesicle budding. It is 
the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTP-binding protein Sar1p 
which is a constituent of COP II ER to Golgi vesicles. We report the sequence 
and localization of the human homologue to yeast Rer1p, which has recently been 
identified genetically as an essential component for retention of Sec12p in the 
ER. Reverse polymerase chain reaction was used to obtain cDNAs from HeLa cells. 
They code for a protein of 196 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of 
23 kDa. The translated sequence is 44% identical and 65% similar to yeast Rer1 
protein. The four putative transmembrane domains are predicted to form a 
W-topology with both N- and C-terminus facing the cytosol. The functional 
activity of myc-tagged human Rer1 was demonstrated by the complementation of the 
RER1 deletion in S. cerevisiae. Mislocalization of the Sec12-reporter protein 
was reduced similar to the results obtained with yeast Rer1p. Human Rer1 protein 
was expressed in HeLa cells and the subcellular distribution analyzed by double 
immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy of thawed cryosections. The 
tagged protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus and peripheral elements of 
the ER-Golgi interface. High overexpression leads to relocation of human Rer1 to 
ER-like structures together with KDEL-receptor and affects the structural 
organization of the Golgi apparatus. Under conditions of brefeldin A treatment, 
human Rer1 distributes together with recycling Golgi proteins.
