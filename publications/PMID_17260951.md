We have determined the 1.65 A crystal structure of human thioredoxin-1 after 
treatment with S-nitrosoglutathione, providing a high-resolution view of this 
important protein modification and mechanistic insight into protein 
transnitrosation. Thioredoxin-1 appears to play an intermediary role in cellular 
S-nitrosylation and is important in numerous biological and pathobiological 
activities. S-Nitroso modifications of cysteines 62 and 69 are clearly visible 
in the structure and display planar cis geometries, whereas cysteines 32, 35, 
and 73 form intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. Surprisingly, the Cys 62 
nitroso group is completely buried and pointing to the protein interior yet is 
the most readily formed at neutral pH. The Cys 69 nitroso group is also 
protected but requires a higher pH for stable formation. The helix intervening 
between residues 62 and 69 shifts by approximately 0.5 A to accommodate the SNO 
groups. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains three independent 
molecules of thioredoxin, providing three views of the nitrosated protein. The 
three molecules are in general agreement but display subtle differences, 
including both cis and trans conformers for Cys 69 SNO in molecule C, and 
greater disorder in the Cys 62-Cys 69 helix in molecule B. Possible mechanisms 
for protein transnitrosation with specific geometric requirements and charge 
stabilization of the nitroxyl disulfide reaction intermediate are discussed.
