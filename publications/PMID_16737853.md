Previous studies have shown that human ribosomal protein S3 (hS3) has a high 
apparent binding affinity for 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) residues in DNA 
and interacts with the human base excision repair (BER) proteins OGG1 and 
APE/Ref-1. We used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to 
understand the role of hS3 in BER and its potential to hinder repair of 8-oxoG 
lesions by OGG1 and APE/Ref-1. Sequence analysis was employed to identify hS3 
residues likely to be involved in binding to 8-oxoG. One putative site, lysine 
132 (K132), located in a helix-hairpin-helix DNA binding motif, was mutated to 
alanine (K132A). The hS3-K132A mutant retained the ability to cleave abasic DNA, 
but its capacity to bind 8-oxoG was abrogated completely. The ability of OGG1 to 
cleave an 8-oxoG-oligonucleotide substrate pre-incubated with hS3 or hS3-K132A 
was also tested. Pre-incubations with wild-type hS3 and 8-oxoG-containing 
oligonucleotides completely prevented the subsequent removal of 8-oxoG by OGG1. 
On the other hand, OGG1 incubations combined with hS3-K132A stimulated cleavage 
of 8-oxoG in excess of two-fold, confirming previous observations that hS3 
positively interacts with OGG1, but only under conditions in which the binding 
of hS3 to 8-oxoG is limited. Overall, the ability of OGG1 to repair 8-oxoG is 
compromised when hS3 is bound to 8-oxoG sites. Conversely, in the absence of DNA 
binding, hS3 interacts positively with OGG1 to produce a more robust removal of 
8-oxoG residues in DNA.
