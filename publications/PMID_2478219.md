The members of the integrin family of membrane glycoprotein heterodimer 
complexes function as cell surface receptors for adhesive proteins. We report 
here on the identification of two integrins on the surface of human platelets 
that bind to thrombospondin. When platelet membrane proteins are radiolabeled 
with 125I-lactoperoxidase, solubilized in n-octylglucoside, (Boehringer Mannheim 
Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), and applied to a column of 
thrombospondin-Sepharose, both complexes are bound to the column and 
specifically eluted with the peptide GRGDSP. One of these integrins, 
glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, appears to bind relatively weakly. The second 
integrin shares the same beta subunit (beta 3 or GPIIIa), but has a distinct 
alpha subunit that comigrates with the alpha subunit (alpha v) of the 
vitronectin receptor (VnR) on endothelial cells and reacts with a monoclonal 
antibody, LM142, which was raised against an integrin from M21 melanoma cells. 
The alpha v beta 3 integrin is present on a variety of cell types and appears to 
act as a receptor for thrombospondin on endothelial and smooth muscle cells. On 
endothelial and M21 melanoma cells this receptor is also involved in adhesion to 
fibrinogen, vitronectin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF). The alpha v beta 3 
integrin is present at approximately equal levels on normal and thrombasthenic 
platelets, whereas levels of GPIIb-IIIa are greatly reduced on thrombasthenic 
platelets. The alpha v beta 3 integrin on thrombasthenic platelets also binds to 
thrombospondin-Sepharose and can be eluted with the peptide GRGDSP. These data 
indicate that the alpha v beta 3 integrin on platelets, endothelial cells, and 
smooth muscle cells functions as an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-dependent receptor for 
thrombospondin.
