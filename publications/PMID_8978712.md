In primary cultures of mouse striatal astrocytes prelabeled with [3H]myristic 
acid, endothelin (ET)-1 induced a time-dependent formation of [3H]phosphatidic 
acid and [3H]diacylglycerol. In the presence of ethanol, a production of 
[3H]phosphatidylethanol was observed, indicating the activation of a 
phospholipase D (PLD). ET-1 and ET-3 were equipotent in stimulating PLD activity 
(EC50 = 2-5 nM). Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin partially 
abolished the effect of ET-1, indicating the involvement of a Gi/G(o) protein. 
Inhibition of protein kinase C by Ro 31-8220 or down-regulation of the kinase by 
a long-time treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) totally 
abolished the ET-1-induced stimulation of PLD. In contrast, a cyclic 
AMP-dependent process is not involved in the activation of PLD, because the 
ET-1-evoked formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol was not affected when cells 
were coincubated with either isoproterenol, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, or forskolin. 
Acute treatment with PMA also stimulated PLD through a protein kinase 
C-dependent process. However, the ET-1 and PMA responses were additive. 
Furthermore, the ET-1-evoked response, contrary to that of PMA, totally 
dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. These results suggest that 
at least two distinct mechanisms are involved in the control of PLD activity in 
striatal astrocytes. Finally, ET-1, ET-3, and PMA also stimulated PLD in 
astrocytes from the mesencephalon, the cerebral cortex, and the hippocampus.
