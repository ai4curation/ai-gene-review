The formation of G-quadruplex structures within the nuclease hypersensitive 
element (NHE) III(1) region of the c-myc promoter and the ability of these 
structures to repress c-myc transcription have been well established. However, 
just how these extremely stable DNA secondary structures are transformed to 
activate c-myc transcription is still unknown. NM23-H2/nucleoside diphosphate 
kinase B has been recognized as an activator of c-myc transcription via 
interactions with the NHE III(1) region of the c-myc gene promoter. Through the 
use of RNA interference, we confirmed the transcriptional regulatory role of 
NM23-H2. In addition, we find that further purification of NM23-H2 results in 
loss of the previously identified DNA strand cleavage activity, but retention of 
its DNA binding activity. NM23-H2 binds to both single-stranded guanine- and 
cytosine-rich strands of the c-myc NHE III(1) and, to a lesser extent, to a 
random single-stranded DNA template. However, it does not bind to or cleave the 
NHE III(1) in duplex form. Significantly, potassium ions and compounds that 
stabilize the G-quadruplex and i-motif structures have an inhibitory effect on 
NM23-H2 DNA-binding activity. Mutation of Arg(88) to Ala(88) (R88A) reduced both 
DNA and nucleotide binding but had minimal effect on the NM23-H2 crystal 
structure. On the basis of these data and molecular modeling studies, we have 
proposed a stepwise trapping-out of the NHE III(1) region in a single-stranded 
form, thus allowing single-stranded transcription factors to bind and activate 
c-myc transcription. Furthermore, this model provides a rationale for how the 
stabilization of the G-quadruplex or i-motif structures formed within the c-myc 
gene promoter region can inhibit NM23-H2 from activating c-myc gene expression.
