The mutation and overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
are associated with the development of a variety of cancers, making this 
prototypical dimerization-activated receptor tyrosine kinase a prominent target 
of cancer drugs. Using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, we find 
that the N lobe dimerization interface of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain is 
intrinsically disordered and that it becomes ordered only upon dimerization. Our 
simulations suggest, moreover, that some cancer-linked mutations distal to the 
dimerization interface, particularly the widespread L834R mutation (also 
referred to as L858R), facilitate EGFR dimerization by suppressing this local 
disorder. Corroborating these findings, our biophysical experiments and kinase 
enzymatic assays indicate that the L834R mutation causes abnormally high 
activity primarily by promoting EGFR dimerization rather than by allowing 
activation without dimerization. We also find that phosphorylation of EGFR 
kinase domain at Tyr845 may suppress the intrinsic disorder, suggesting a 
molecular mechanism for autonomous EGFR signaling.
