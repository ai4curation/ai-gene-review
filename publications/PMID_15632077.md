The BRCT domain is a highly conserved module found in many proteins that 
participate in DNA damage checkpoint regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle 
control. Here we describe the cloning, characterization, and targeted 
mutagenesis of Brctx, a novel gene with a BRCT motif. Brctx was found to be 
expressed ubiquitously in adult tissues and during development, with the highest 
levels found in testis. Brctx-deficient mice develop normally, show no 
pathological abnormalities, and are fertile. BRCTx binds to the C terminus of 
hRAD18 in yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays and colocalizes with 
this protein in the nucleus. Despite this, Brctx-deficient murine embryonic 
fibroblasts (MEFs) do not show overt sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. MEFs 
from Brctx-deficient embryos grow at a similar rate to wild-type MEF CD4/CD8 
expressions, and the cell cycle parameters of thymocytes from wild-type and 
Brctx knockout animals are indistinguishable. Intriguingly, the BRCT domain of 
BRCTx is responsible for mediating its localization to the nucleus and 
centrosome in interphase cells. We conclude that, although highly conserved, 
Brctx is not essential for the above-mentioned processes and may be redundant.
