Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are critical for normal cell growth, 
differentiation, and development, but they contribute to various pathological 
conditions when disrupted. Activation of RTKs stimulates a plethora of pathways, 
including the ubiquitylation and endocytosis of the receptor itself. Although 
endocytosis terminates RTK signaling, it has emerged as a requisite step in RTK 
activation of signaling pathways. We have discovered that the endocytic 
scaffolding protein intersectin (ITSN) cooperated with epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) in the regulation of cell growth and signaling. However, a 
biochemical link between ITSN and EGFR was not defined. In this study, we 
demonstrate that ITSN is a scaffold for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl. ITSN forms 
a complex with Cbl in vivo mediated by the Src homology (SH) 3 domains binding 
to the Pro-rich COOH terminus of Cbl. This interaction stimulates the 
ubiquitylation and degradation of the activated EGFR. Furthermore, silencing 
ITSN by RNA interference attenuated EGFR internalization as well as activation 
of the extracellular signal-regulated kinasemitogen-activated protein kinase 
pathway, thereby demonstrating the importance of ITSN in EGFR function. Given 
the cooperativity between ITSN and additional RTKs, these results point to an 
important evolutionarily conserved, regulatory role for ITSN in RTK function 
that is necessary for both signaling from receptors as well as the ultimate 
termination of receptor signaling.
