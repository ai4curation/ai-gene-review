In yeast, the multisubunit SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) complex acts as 
a coactivator to recruit the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA box, a 
critical step in eukaryotic gene regulation. However, it is unclear which SAGA 
subunits are responsible for SAGA's direct interactions with TBP and precisely 
how SAGA recruits TBP to the promoter. We have used chemical crosslinking to 
identify Spt8 and Ada1 as potential SAGA subunits that interact with TBP, and we 
find that both Spt8 and SAGA bind directly to TBP monomer in competition with 
TBP dimer. We further find that Spt8 and SAGA compete with DNA to bind TBP 
rather than forming a triple complex. Our results suggest a handoff model for 
SAGA recruitment of TBP: instead of binding together with TBP at the TATA box, 
activator-recruited SAGA transfers TBP to the TATA box. This simple model can 
explain SAGA's observed ability to both activate and repress transcription.
