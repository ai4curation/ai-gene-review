cdc28-1N is a conditional allele that has normal G1 (Start) function but confers 
a mitotic defect. We have isolated seven genes that in high dosage suppress the 
growth defect of cdc28-1N cells but not of Start-defective cdc28-4 cells. Three 
of these (CLB1, CLB2, and CLB4) encode proteins strongly homologous to 
G2-specific B-type cyclins. Another gene, CLB3, was cloned using PCR, CLB1 and 
CLB2 encode a pair of closely related proteins; CLB3 and CLB4 encode a second 
pair. Neither CLB1 nor CLB2 is essential; however, disruption of both is lethal 
and causes a mitotic defect. Furthermore, the double mutant cdc28-1N clb2::LEU2 
is nonviable, whereas cdc28-4 clb2::LEU2 is viable, suggesting that the cdc28-1N 
protein may be defective in its interaction with B-type cyclins. Our results are 
consistent with CDC28 function being required in both G1 and mitosis. Its 
mitotic role, we believe, involves interaction with a family of at least four 
G2-specific cyclins.
