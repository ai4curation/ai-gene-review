Overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 
in 293 cells resulted in hyperphosphorylation of a glycoprotein specifically 
associated with the enzyme. The protein has been purified to near homogeneity. 
Based on the amino acid sequences of peptides obtained from the protein, a 
full-length cDNA was isolated. The cDNA encodes a protein with a single 
transmembrane segment and a signal sequence. The extracellular portion of the 
protein contains a single immunoglobulin-like domain displaying 46% sequence 
identity to that of myelin P0, a major structural protein of peripheral myelin. 
The intracellular segment of the protein shows no significant sequence identity 
to any known protein except for two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory 
motifs. We name the protein PZR for protein zero related. Transfection of the 
PZR cDNA in Jurkat cells gave rise to a protein of expected molecular size. 
Stimulation of cells with pervanadate resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of 
PZR and a near-stoichiometric association of PZR with SHP-2. Northern blotting 
analyses revealed that PZR is widely expressed in human tissues and is 
particularly abundant in heart, placenta, kidney, and pancreas. As a binding 
protein and a putative substrate of SHP-2, PZR protein may have an important 
role in cell signaling.
