The transcription factor glial cells missing 1 (GCM1) regulates trophoblast 
differentiation and function during placentation. Decreased GCM1 expression is 
associated with pre-eclampsia, suggesting that abnormal expression of GCM1 
target genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of pregnancy complications. Here 
we identified a novel GCM1 target gene, synapse defective 1 (SYDE1), which 
encodes a RhoGAP that is highly expressed in human placenta, and demonstrated 
that SYDE1 promotes cytoskeletal remodelling and cell migration and invasion. 
Importantly, genetic ablation of murine Syde1 results in small fetuses and 
placentas with aberrant phenotypes in the placental-yolk sac barrier, 
maternal-trophoblast interface, and placental vascularization. Microarray 
analysis revealed altered expression of renin-1, angiotensin I converting enzyme 
2, angiotensin II type 1a receptor, and membrane metalloendopeptidase of the 
renin-angiotensin system in Syde1-knockout placenta, which may compensate for 
the vascular defects to maintain normal blood pressure. As pregnancy proceeds, 
growth restriction of the Syde1-/- fetuses and placentas continues, with 
elevated expression of the Syde1 homologue Syde2 in placenta. Syde2 may 
compensate for the loss of Syde1 function because SYDE2, but not the GAP-dead 
SYDE2 mutant, reverses migration and invasion activities of SYDE1-knockdown JAR 
trophoblast cells. Clinically, we further detected decreased SYDE1 expression in 
preterm and term IUGR placentas compared with gestational age-matched controls. 
Our study suggests a novel mechanism for GCM1 and SYDE1 in regulation of 
trophoblast cell migration and invasion during placental development and that 
decreased SYDE1 expression is associated with IUGR. Copyright © 2016
