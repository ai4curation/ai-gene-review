PTEN, a tumor suppressor among the most commonly mutated proteins in human 
cancer, is recognized to be both a protein phosphatase and a 
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)) 3-phosphatase. 
Previous work [Maehama and Dixon, J. Biol. Chem. 273 (1998) 13375-13378] has led 
to a consensus that inositol phosphates are not physiologically relevant 
substrates for PTEN. In contrast, we demonstrate that PTEN is an active inositol 
1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P(5)) 3-phosphatase when expressed 
and purified from bacteria or HEK cells. Kinetic data indicate 
Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P(5) (K(m)=7.1 microM) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) (K(m)=26 microM) 
compete for PTEN in vivo. Transient transfection of HEK cells with PTEN 
decreased Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P(5) levels. We discuss the physiological significance 
of these studies in relation to recent work showing that dephosphorylation of 
Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P(5) to inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate is a cell signaling 
event.
