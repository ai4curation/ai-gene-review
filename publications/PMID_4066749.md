Clathrin structure characterized with monoclonal antibodies. II. Identification 
of in vivo forms of clathrin.

Brodsky FM.

Clathrin was isolated from detergent-solubilized, biosynthetically radiolabeled 
cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-clathrin monoclonal antibodies. 
Immunoprecipitates obtained after pulse-chase labeling demonstrated that after 
biosynthesis the LCa light chain of clathrin could be found either complexed to 
heavy chain or in a free pool (not associated with heavy chain) which decreased 
steadily over time. More than half of the free LCa disappeared within the first 
hour after biosynthesis, but some was still detectable after several hours. 
Incorporation of clathrin LCa light chain and heavy chain into coated vesicles 
was coordinate and increased up to 4 h after biosynthesis. Comparison of these 
kinetics suggested that once incorporated into coated vesicles, LCa and heavy 
chain did not dissociate, even during depolymerization of the vesicle. There was 
also little apparent degradation of clathrin found in coated vesicles for up to 
22 h after biosynthesis. Immunoprecipitation with anti-clathrin monoclonal 
antibodies was carried out after fractionation of continuously radiolabeled cell 
lysates using two different sizing columns. These experiments indicated that the 
triskelion form of clathrin that has been isolated from coated vesicles in vitro 
also exists in vivo. They also confirmed the existence of a transient but 
detectable pool of newly synthesized free LCa light chain.
