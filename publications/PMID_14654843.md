The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing centre of animal cells and 
through its influence on the cytoskeleton is involved in cell shape, polarity 
and motility. It also has a crucial function in cell division because it 
determines the poles of the mitotic spindle that segregates duplicated 
chromosomes between dividing cells. Despite the importance of this organelle to 
cell biology and more than 100 years of study, many aspects of its function 
remain enigmatic and its structure and composition are still largely unknown. We 
performed a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of human centrosomes in 
the interphase of the cell cycle by quantitatively profiling hundreds of 
proteins across several centrifugation fractions. True centrosomal proteins were 
revealed by both correlation with already known centrosomal proteins and in vivo 
localization. We identified and validated 23 novel components and identified 41 
likely candidates as well as the vast majority of the known centrosomal proteins 
in a large background of nonspecific proteins. Protein correlation profiling 
permits the analysis of any multiprotein complex that can be enriched by 
fractionation but not purified to homogeneity.
