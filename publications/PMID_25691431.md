The ORM1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-like proteins (ORMDLs) and their yeast 
orthologs, the Orms, are negative homeostatic regulators of the initiating 
enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). 
Genome-wide association studies have established a strong correlation between 
elevated expression of the endoplasmic reticulum protein ORMDL3 and risk for 
childhood asthma. Here we test the notion that elevated levels of ORMDL3 
decrease sphingolipid biosynthesis. This was tested in cultured human bronchial 
epithelial cells (HBECs) (an immortalized, but untransformed, airway epithelial 
cell line) and in HeLa cells (a cervical adenocarcinoma cell line). 
Surprisingly, elevated ORMDL3 expression did not suppress de novo biosynthesis 
of sphingolipids. We determined that ORMDL is expressed in functional excess 
relative to SPT at normal levels of expression. ORMDLs and SPT form stable 
complexes that are not increased by elevated ORMDL3 expression. Although 
sphingolipid biosynthesis was not decreased by elevated ORMDL3 expression, the 
steady state mass levels of all major sphingolipids were marginally decreased by 
low level ORMDL3 over-expression in HBECs. These data indicate that the 
contribution of ORMDL3 to asthma risk may involve changes in sphingolipid 
metabolism, but that the connection is complex.
