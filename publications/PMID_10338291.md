Aged beta-amyloid precursor protein-null mice were used to investigate the 
relationship between beta-amyloid precursor protein, hippocampal neuron and 
synaptic bouton number, and cognitive function. Learning and memory performance 
of aged beta-amyloid precursor protein-null mice and age-matched controls were 
assessed in the Morris water maze. Beta-amyloid precursor protein-null mice 
demonstrated impaired task acquisition as measured by significantly longer swim 
path lengths, a higher percentage of failed trials, and more frequent 
thigmotaxis behavior than controls. In a subsequent probe trial, beta-amyloid 
precursor protein-null mice spent significantly less time in the old goal 
quadrant, and made fewer crossings over the old platform location than did 
controls. No differences in motor or visual skills were observed which could 
account for the performance differences. In light of these findings and previous 
evidence for a role of beta-amyloid precursor protein in neuronal maintenance 
and synaptogenesis, we pursued the hypothesis that the learning impairment of 
beta-amyloid precursor protein-null mice may be a reflection of differences in 
neuron or synaptophysin-positive presynaptic bouton number. Thus, unbiased 
stereological analysis was used to estimate neuron and synaptic bouton number in 
dentate gyrus and hippocampal CA1 of the behaviorally characterized mice. No 
difference in neuron or synaptophysin-positive presynaptic bouton number was 
found between the beta-amyloid precursor protein-null mice and age-matched 
controls. Our results suggest that the learning impairment of beta-amyloid 
precursor protein-null mice is not mediated by a loss of hippocampal neurons or 
synaptic boutons.
