BACKGROUND: Chronic alcohol consumption may act as a cellular stressor for brain 
cells, as has been found for aging. In this study we examined one component of 
the cellular stress response (heat shock proteins) as a function of age and 
alcohol exposure. We have found that the level of constitutively expressed heat 
shock protein 70 (heat shock cognate 70, or Hsc70) increases in the aged rat 
brain. Among many heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones, Hsc70 might be 
important not only for the normal protein folding pathway but also for refolding 
of denatured proteins produced by mild and chronic stress.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats that were 5.5 to 28.5 months old were fed a liquid 
diet that contained 5% (w/v) alcohol or a control diet for 6 weeks. The effects 
of alcohol consumption and aging on the expression of Hsc70 in the brain were 
investigated. The cytosol proteins in the 12,000 x g supernatant fraction were 
heat-treated at 42 degrees C for 1 hr. After the heat treatment, proteins that 
transferred from the soluble to insoluble aggregated fraction were estimated as 
heat-unstable proteins.
RESULTS: In the 24- and 30-month-old rat brain, chronic consumption of alcohol 
increased levels of Hsc70 and heat-unstable proteins. On the other hand, those 
changes were not detected in the younger rat brain.
CONCLUSION: Chronic alcohol intake causes a stress response in the aged rat 
brain. It is thought that the increased level of Hsc70 is brought about by an 
increase of denatured proteins.
