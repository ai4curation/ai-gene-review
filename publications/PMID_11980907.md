Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a mitochondrial flavoprotein that triggers 
caspase-independent apoptosis. We describe here the cloning and characterization 
of a novel AIF-homologous molecule designated AMID (AIF-homologous 
mitochondrion-associated inducer of death). AMID lacks a mitochondrial 
localization sequence but shares significant homology with AIF and NADH 
oxidoreductases from bacteria to mammalian species. Immunofluorescent staining 
and biochemical experiments indicated that AMID was co-localized with 
mitochondria. Overexpression of AMID induced cell death with characteristic 
apoptotic morphology. Furthermore, AMID-induced apoptosis was independent of 
caspase activation and p53 and was not inhibited by Bcl-2. These findings 
suggest that AMID induces a novel caspase-independent apoptotic pathway.
