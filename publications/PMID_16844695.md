Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) are known to play a 
critical role in a variety of fundamental processes, including wound healing, 
angiogenesis, and development of multiple organ systems. Mutations in the FGFR 
gene family have been linked to a series of syndromes (the craniosynostosis 
syndromes) whose primary phenotype involves aberrant development of the 
craniofacial skeleton. Craniosynostosis syndrome-linked FGFR mutations have been 
shown to be gain of function in terms of receptor activation and have been 
presumed to result in increased levels of FGF/FGFR signaling. Unfortunately, 
studies attempting to link expression of mutant FGFRs with changes in cellular 
phenotype have yielded conflicting results. In an effort to better understand 
the biochemical consequences of these mutations on receptor function, here we 
have investigated the effect of the FGFR2C278F mutation of Crouzon 
craniosynostosis syndrome on receptor trafficking, ubiquitination, degradation, 
and signaling. We find that FGFR2C278F exhibits diminished glycosylation, 
increased degradation, and limited cellular sublocalization in the osteoblastic 
cell line, MC3T3E1(C4). Additionally, we show that trafficking and 
autoactivation of wild type FGFR2 is glycosylation-dependent. Both FGFR2C278F 
and unglycosylated wild type FGFR2 signal through phospholipase Cgamma in a 
ligand-independent manner as well as exhibit dramatically increased binding to 
the adaptor protein, Frs2. These findings suggest that autoactive FGFR2 can 
signal from intracellular compartments. Based upon our results, we propose that 
the functional signaling of craniosynostosis mutant, autoactive receptors is 
limited in some cell types by protective cellular responses, such as increased 
trafficking to lysosomes and proteasomes for degradation.
