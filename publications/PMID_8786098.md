By comparing lists of 3'-directed partial cDNA sequences (gene signatures) 
randomly collected from various tissues, genes unique to each tissue can be 
identified. A full-size cDNA clone, corresponding to one such tissue-specific 
gene signature that recurred only in a retina library, was isolated and 
analyzed. This clone encoded 83 amino acids highly homologous to the bovine blue 
cone cGMP phosphodiesterase gamma subunit. The retina-specific expression of 
this gene was confirmed by multiple tissue Northern blotting, and its cone 
specificity was confirmed by in situ hybridization to a human retina specimen. 
From these results, we concluded that this clone (HGMW-approved symbol PDE6H) 
encodes for the gamma subunit of human cone-specific cGMP phosphodiesterase, and 
it was assigned to chromosome 12p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
