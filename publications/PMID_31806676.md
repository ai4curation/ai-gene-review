Abstract

The cambium and procambium generate the majority of biomass in vascular plants. These meristems constitute a bifacial stem cell population from which xylem and phloem are specified on opposing sides by positional signals. The PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM (PXY) receptor kinase promotes vascular cell division and organization. However, how these functions are specified and integrated is unknown. Here, we mapped a putative PXY-mediated transcriptional regulatory network comprising 690 transcription factor-promoter interactions in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). Among these interactions was a feedforward loop containing transcription factors WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX RELATED14 (WOX14) and TARGET OF MONOPTEROS6 (TMO6), each of which regulates the expression of the gene encoding a third transcription factor, LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN4 (LBD4). PXY signaling in turn regulates the WOX14, TMO6, and LBD4 feedforward loop to control vascular proliferation. Genetic interaction between LBD4 and PXY suggests that LBD4 marks the phloem-procambium boundary, thus defining the shape of the vascular bundle. These data collectively support a mechanism that influences the recruitment of cells into the phloem lineage, and they define the role of PXY signaling in this context in determining the arrangement of vascular tissue.

INTRODUCTION

In vascular plants, water is taken up from the soil but sugars are assimilated in leaves, so the movement of these resources throughout the plant body is essential for plant survival. Xylem and phloem are the specialized vascular tissues that perform this function. Both arise in a highly ordered manner from meristematic divisions in the cambium and procambium. Multiple mechanisms have been identified that influence vascular development ( Fischer et al., 2019 ); however, how these mechanisms interact to coordinate vascular morphogenesis is poorly understood.

Auxin is central to vascular tissue specification, and its responses are mediated by, among others, MONOPTEROS ( MP ), which encodes an Auxin Response Factor ( Hardtke and Berleth, 1998 ). Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) mp mutants are characterized by patterning defects in the embryo vascular cylinder ( Berleth and Jurgens, 1993 ). MP is thought to act as an activator of vascular proliferation in seedlings ( Vera-Sirera et al., 2015 ) or as a repressor of vascular proliferation in mature plant tissues ( Mattsson et al., 2003 ; Brackmann et al., 2018 ). With additional signals, MP controls two pathways that stimulate vascular proliferation. The first pathway is characterized by TARGET OF MONOPTEROS5 ( TMO5 ), encoding a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor ( Schlereth et al., 2010 ) that with its homologs promotes cell divisions in the vascular cylinder. These transcription factor genes are upregulated by MP in the embryo. TMO5-like proteins perform this function in heterodimers with a second class of bHLH transcription factors including LONESOME HIGHWAY and its relatives ( Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2007 ; De Rybel et al., 2013 , 2014 ; Ohashi-Ito et al., 2014 ; Vera-Sirera et al., 2015 ). The second pathway targeted by MP involves auxin-responsive TMO6 ( Schlereth et al., 2010 ), which encodes a member of the DOF family of transcription factors. Multiple members of the DOF family have been shown to promote vascular cell divisions ( Guo et al., 2009 ; Waki et al., 2013 ; Konishi et al., 2015 ; Miyashima et al., 2019 ; Smet et al., 2019 ). The expression of a subset of DOF genes, including TMO6 , is also controlled by cytokinin ( Miyashima et al., 2019 ). Thus, TMO6 responds to both cytokinin and auxin.

TRACHEARY ELEMENT DIFFERENTIATION INHIBITORY FACTOR (TDIF) and PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM/TDIF RECEPTOR (PXY/TDR; referred to hereafter as PXY) are a ligand-receptor pair ( Hirakawa et al., 2008 ; Morita et al., 2016 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ) that also promote cell division in vascular meristems. The TDIF peptide is derived from CLE41 , CLE42 , and CLE44 . These genes are expressed in the phloem while PXY is expressed in the procambium ( Ito et al., 2006 ; Fisher and Turner, 2007 ; Hirakawa et al., 2008 ; Etchells and Turner, 2010 ). Upon TDIF binding to the PXY receptor, the transcription factor genes WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX RELATED4 ( WOX4 ), WOX14 , and ATHB8 are upregulated ( Hirakawa et al., 2010 ; Etchells et al., 2013 ). Another transcription factor, BES1, is also regulated by TDIF-PXY. When TDIF binds to PXY, an interaction between PXY and GSK3 kinases results in the phosphorylation and degradation of BES1. BES1 is thought to promote xylem differentiation, so its degradation preserves cambium pluripotency ( Kondo et al., 2014 ).

Interactions between TDIF-PXY and auxin signaling contribute to vascular tissue development ( Suer et al., 2011 ; Smetana et al., 2019 ). Both auxin and PXY responses are mediated by interactions with GSK3 signaling proteins. The GSK3, BIN2-LIKE 1 regulates the auxin response via phosphorylation of MP, and during vascular development, this requires the absence of active TDIF-PXY complexes ( Cho et al., 2014 ; Kondo et al., 2014 ; Han et al., 2018 ). Auxin also induces the expression of the TDIF-PXY targets ATHB8 and WOX4 ( Baima et al., 1995 ; Mattsson et al., 2003 ; Suer et al., 2011 ). The induction of TMO5-like1 ( T5L1 ) and LHW also increases ATHB8 expression ( Vera-Sirera et al., 2015 ). ATHB8 encodes an HD-Zip III transcription factor ( Baima et al., 2001 ) whose paralogues modulate the expression of auxin biosynthesis and auxin perception genes ( Müller et al., 2016 ). HD-Zip III genes have wide-ranging roles in vascular patterning and proliferation ( Zhong and Ye, 1999 ; Emery et al., 2003 ; Prigge et al., 2005 ; Carlsbecker et al., 2010 ; Baima et al., 2014 ; Ramachandran et al., 2016 ).

In addition to PXY, a second family of receptor kinases, members of the ERECTA (ER) family, control vascular expansion in Arabidopsis ( Ragni et al., 2011 ; Uchida et al., 2012 ; Uchida and Tasaka, 2013 ; Ikematsu et al., 2017 ). PXY and its paralogues genetically interact with ER family members to control cell proliferation, cell size, and cell type organization in vascular tissues ( Etchells et al., 2013 ; Uchida and Tasaka, 2013 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). ER also interacts with auxin signaling components and members of the HD-Zip III family in developmental contexts that include meristem maintenance, stem architecture, and leaf development ( Woodward et al., 2005 ; Chen et al., 2013 ). Thus, interactions between PXY , auxin, cytokinin, HD-Zip IIIs , ER , and GSK3 s constitute a significant proportion of the regulatory mechanisms that define how vascular tissue develops.

How do these and other factors combine to coordinate vascular development at the level of transcription? Here, to provide a framework for answering this question, we generated a transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) incorporating a significant proportion of known regulators of vascular development in Arabidopsis. We used high-throughput enhanced yeast one-hybrid (eY1H) assays ( Gaudinier et al., 2011 , 2017 ; Reece-Hoyes et al., 2011 ) to identify transcription factors that bind to the promoters of vascular regulators. Our vascular development TRN comprises 690 transcription factor-promoter interactions. To demonstrate the power of our network to identify novel regulators and interactions, we characterized a feed-forward loop incorporating three transcription factors that link auxin and PXY-mediated signaling: WOX14, TMO6, and LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN4 (LBD4). Feed-forward loops are often involved in dynamic gene regulation ( Mangan and Alon, 2003 ), and our results demonstrate that, in response to auxin and TDIF-PXY signaling, the genes within this circuit define a zone of procambial activity to maintain the arrangement of vascular tissue of the stem.
