T-2 toxin is one of the mycotoxins, a group of type A trichothecenes produced by 
several fungal genera including Fusarium species. In the present study, we have 
investigated the apoptotic effects of T-2 toxin on chondrocytes and the 
relationship between T-2 toxin induced chondrocyte apoptosis and its influence 
on Bcl-2/Bax protein and mRNA expression. We have also examined the inhibitory 
effects of selenium on chondrocyte apoptosis induced by T-2 toxin. We have 
combined morphological and biological techniques to establish the relevance of 
apoptosis in human chondrocyte death induced by T-2 toxin. Treatment with T-2 
toxin caused accelerated apoptosis in a concentration dependent manner. The 
apoptosis induced by T-2 toxin involved an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Bcl-2 mRNA 
expression remained unchanged in chondrocyte apoptosis induced by T-2 toxin 
treatment, while Bax mRNA expression increased following treatment with T-2 
toxin. Selenium could partly block the apoptosis of chondrocytes induced by T-2 
toxin through decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. These results suggest that, under 
our experimental conditions, apoptosis of chondrocytes can be induced by T-2 
toxin (1-20ng/mL) via the Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio may 
play a critical role in governing the susceptibility to apoptosis induced by T-2 
toxin in human chondrocytes.
