The interaction of the chaperonin GroEL14 with its cochaperonin GroES7 is 
dynamic, involving stable, asymmetric 1:1 complexes (GroES7.GroEL7-GroEL7) and 
transient, metastable symmetric 2:1 complexes [GroES7.GroEL7-GroEL7.GroES7]. The 
transient formation of a 2:1 complex permits exchange of free GroES7 for GroES7 
bound in the stable 1:1 complex. Electrophoresis in the presence of ADP was used 
to resolve free GroEL14 from the GroES7-GroEL14 complex. Titration of GroEL14 
with radiolabeled GroES7 to molar ratios of 32:1 demonstrated a 1:1 limiting 
stoichiometry in a stable complex. No stable 2:1 complex was detected. 
Preincubation of the asymmetric GroES7.GroEL7-GroEL7 complex with excess 
unlabeled GroES7 in the presence of ADP demonstrated GroES7 exchange. The rates 
of GroES7 exchange were proportional to the concentration of unlabeled free 
GroES7. This concentration dependence points to an associative mechanism in 
which exchange of GroES7 occurs by way of a transient 2:1 complex and excludes a 
dissociative mechanism in which exchange occurs by way of free GroEL14. Exchange 
of radiolabeled ADP from 1:1 complexes was much slower than the exchange of 
GroES7. In agreement with recent structural studies, this indicates that 
conformational changes in GroEL14 following the dissociation of GroES7 must 
precede ADP release. These results explain how the GroEL14 cavity can become 
reversibly accessible to proteins under in vivo conditions that favor 2:1 
complexes.
