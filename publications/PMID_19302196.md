Autosomal dominant mutations in the human Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) 
gene represent the most common monogenetic cause of Parkinson disease (PD) and 
increased kinase activity observed in pathogenic mutants of LRRK2 is most likely 
causative for PD-associated neurotoxicity. The sequence of the LRRK2 kinase 
domain shows similarity to MAP kinase kinase kinases. Furthermore, LRRK2 shares 
highest sequence homology with mixed linage kinases which act upstream of 
canonical MAPKK and are involved in cellular stress responses. Therefore, we 
addressed the question if LRRK2 exhibits MAPKKK activity by systematically 
testing MAPKKs as candidate substrates, in vitro. We demonstrate that LRRK2 
variants phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKK), 
including MKK3 -4, -6 and -7. MKKs act upstream of the MAPK p38 and JNK 
mediating oxidative cell stress, neurotoxicity and apoptosis. The 
disease-associated LRRK2 G2019S and I2020T mutations show an increased 
phosphotransferase activity towards MKKs correlating with the activity shown for 
its autophosphorylation. Our findings present evidence of a new class of 
molecular targets for mutant LRRK2 that link to neurotoxicity, cellular stress, 
cytoskeletal dynamics and vesicular transport.
