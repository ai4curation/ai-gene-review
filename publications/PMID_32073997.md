The heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4) is a component of a 
protein coat associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Mutations in AP-4 
subunits cause a complicated form of autosomal-recessive hereditary spastic 
paraplegia termed AP-4-deficiency syndrome. Recent studies showed that AP-4 
mediates export of the transmembrane autophagy protein ATG9A from the TGN to 
preautophagosomal structures. To identify additional proteins that cooperate 
with AP-4 in ATG9A trafficking, we performed affinity purification-mass 
spectrometry followed by validation of the hits by biochemical and functional 
analyses. This approach resulted in the identification of the fused toes 
homolog-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex as a novel AP-4 accessory factor. We found that 
the AP-4-FHF interaction is mediated by direct binding of the AP-4 μ4 subunit to 
coiled-coil domains in the Hook1 and Hook2 subunits of FHF. Knockdown of FHF 
subunits resulted in dispersal of AP-4 and ATG9A from the perinuclear region of 
the cell, consistent with the previously demonstrated role of the FHF complex in 
coupling organelles to the microtubule (MT) retrograde motor dynein-dynactin. 
These findings thus uncover an additional mechanism for the distribution of 
ATG9A within cells and provide further evidence for a role of protein coats in 
coupling transport vesicles to MT motors.
