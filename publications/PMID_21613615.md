The posttranscriptional mechanisms whereby RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate 
T cell differentiation remain unclear. RBPs can coordinately regulate the 
expression of functionally related genes via binding to shared regulatory 
sequences, such as the adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AREs) present in the 
3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA. The RBP HuR posttranscriptionally 
regulates IL-4, IL-13, and other Th2 cell-restricted transcripts. We 
hypothesized that the ARE-bearing GATA-3 gene, a critical regulator of Th2 
polarization, is under HuR control as part of its coordinate posttranscriptional 
regulation of the Th2 program. We report that in parallel with stimulus-induced 
increase in GATA-3 mRNA and protein levels, GATA-3 mRNA half-life is increased 
after restimulation in the human T cell line Jurkat, in human memory and Th2 
cells, and in murine Th2-skewed cells. We demonstrate by immunoprecipitation of 
ribonucleoprotein complexes that HuR associates with the GATA-3 endogenous 
transcript in human T cells and found, using biotin pulldown assay, that HuR 
specifically interacts with its 3'UTR. Using both loss-of-function and 
gain-of-function approaches in vitro and in animal models, we show that HuR is a 
critical mediator of stimulus-induced increase in GATA-3 mRNA and protein 
expression and that it positively influences GATA-3 mRNA turnover, in parallel 
with selective promotion of Th2 cytokine overexpression. These results suggest 
that HuR-driven posttranscriptional control plays a significant role in T cell 
development and effector function in both murine and human systems. A better 
understanding of HuR-mediated control of Th2 polarization may have utility in 
altering allergic airway inflammation in human asthmatic patients.
