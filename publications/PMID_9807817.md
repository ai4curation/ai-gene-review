AtFKBP12 is an Arabidopsis cDNA that encodes a protein similar to the mammalian 
immunophilin, FKBP12. AtFKBP12 was used as 'bait' in a yeast 2-hybrid system to 
screen for cDNAs in Arabidopsis encoding proteins that bind to FKBP12. Two 
partial cDNAs were recovered encoding the C-terminus of a protein we have called 
Arabidopsis thaliana FKBP12 interacting protein 37 (AtFIP37). AtFIP37 is similar 
to a mammalian protein, FAP48, that also binds to FKBP12. The interaction 
between AtFKBP12 and AtFIP37 in the 2-hybrid system, as assessed by histidine 
auxotrophy and beta-galactosidase activity, was disrupted by FK506, but not by 
cyclosporin A, a drug that binds to cyclophilin A. AtFIP37 was also shown to 
bind in vitro to AtFKBP12 in GST-fusion protein binding assays. The binding was 
abolished by prior incubation of AtFKBP12 with FK506. These findings indicate 
that an Arabidopsis FKBP12 ortholog encodes a protein that binds FK506 and that 
the interaction between AtFKBP12 and AtFIP37 may involve the FK506 binding site 
of AtFKBP12. The interaction provides interesting new opportunities for 
controlling protein:protein interactions in vivo in plants.
