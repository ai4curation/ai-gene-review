Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of genetic disorders often 
overlapping with other neurological conditions. We previously described 
abnormalities in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic pathway as a 
cause of ASD. Here, we show that the solute carrier transporter 7a5 (SLC7A5), a 
large neutral amino acid transporter localized at the blood brain barrier (BBB), 
has an essential role in maintaining normal levels of brain BCAAs. In mice, 
deletion of Slc7a5 from the endothelial cells of the BBB leads to atypical brain 
amino acid profile, abnormal mRNA translation, and severe neurological 
abnormalities. Furthermore, we identified several patients with autistic traits 
and motor delay carrying deleterious homozygous mutations in the SLC7A5 gene. 
Finally, we demonstrate that BCAA intracerebroventricular administration 
ameliorates abnormal behaviors in adult mutant mice. Our data elucidate a 
neurological syndrome defined by SLC7A5 mutations and support an essential role 
for the BCAA in human brain function.
