PVR, the Drosophila homolog of the PDGF/VEGF receptor, has been implicated in 
border cell migration during oogenesis and hemocyte migration during 
embryogenesis. It was earlier shown that Mbc, a CDM family protein, and its 
effector, Rac, transduced the guidance signal from PVR during border cell 
migration. Here we demonstrate that PVR is also required for the morphogenetic 
process, thorax closure, during metamorphosis. The results of genetic and 
biochemical experiments indicate that PVR activates the JNK pathway. We present 
evidence showing Crk (an adaptor molecule), Mbc, ELMO (a homolog of 
Caenorhabditis elegans CED-12 and mammalian ELMO), and Rac to be mediators of 
JNK activation by PVR. In addition, we suppose that not only Rac but also Cdc42 
is activated and involved in JNK activation downstream of PVR.
