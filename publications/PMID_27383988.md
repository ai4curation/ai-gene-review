Flaviviruses infect hundreds of millions of people annually, and no antiviral 
therapy is available. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen to 
identify host genes that, when edited, resulted in reduced flavivirus infection. 
Here, we validated nine human genes required for flavivirus infectivity, and 
these were associated with endoplasmic reticulum functions including 
translocation, protein degradation, and N-linked glycosylation. In particular, a 
subset of endoplasmic reticulum-associated signal peptidase complex (SPCS) 
proteins was necessary for proper cleavage of the flavivirus structural proteins 
(prM and E) and secretion of viral particles. Loss of SPCS1 expression resulted 
in markedly reduced yield of all Flaviviridae family members tested (West Nile, 
Dengue, Zika, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and hepatitis C viruses), but 
had little impact on alphavirus, bunyavirus, or rhabdovirus infection or the 
surface expression or secretion of diverse host proteins. We found that SPCS1 
dependence could be bypassed by replacing the native prM protein leader 
sequences with a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen leader 
sequence. Thus, SPCS1, either directly or indirectly via its interactions with 
unknown host proteins, preferentially promotes the processing of specific 
protein cargo, and Flaviviridae have a unique dependence on this signal peptide 
processing pathway. SPCS1 and other signal processing pathway members could 
represent pharmacological targets for inhibiting infection by the expanding 
number of flaviviruses of medical concern.
