The extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates numerous cellular events in addition to 
providing structural integrity. Among several protein and enzyme families 
implicated in functions of the ECM, the lysyl oxidases and ADAMTS proteins are 
known to participate in microfibril and elastic fiber formation as well as 
ECM-associated signaling. A yeast two-hybrid screen to identify lysyl oxidase 
(LOX) binding proteins identified ADAMTSL4 as a potential interactor. We 
demonstrate here that several members of the LOX and ADAMTS families interact 
with one another. Upon investigating the interaction between LOX and ADAMTSL2 we 
found that the absence or inhibition of Lox affected ADAMTSL2 molecular forms 
and reduced its tissue levels. Thus, ADAMTSL2 stability and inter-molecular 
complexes may depend on the activity of lysyl oxidases.
