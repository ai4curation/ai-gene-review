Brassinosteroids (BRs) bind to the extracellular domain of the receptor kinase 
BRI1 to activate a signal transduction cascade that regulates nuclear gene 
expression and plant development. Many components of the BR signaling pathway 
have been identified and studied in detail. However, the substrate of BRI1 
kinase that transduces the signal to downstream components remains unknown. 
Proteomic studies of plasma membrane proteins lead to the identification of 
three homologous BR-signaling kinases (BSK1, BSK2, and BSK3). The BSKs are 
phosphorylated by BRI1 in vitro and interact with BRI1 in vivo. Genetic and 
transgenic studies demonstrate that the BSKs represent a small family of kinases 
that activate BR signaling downstream of BRI1. These results demonstrate that 
BSKs are the substrates of BRI1 kinase that activate downstream BR signal 
transduction.

Abstract

Brassinosteroids bind to the extracellular domain of the receptor kinase BRI1 to activate a signal transduction cascade that regulates nuclear gene expression and plant development. Many components of the brassinosteroid signaling pathway have been identified and studied in detail. However, the substrate of BRI1 kinase that transduces the signal to downstream components remains unknown. Proteomic studies of plasma membrane proteins lead to the identification of three homologous BR-signaling kinases (BSK1, BSK2 and BSK3). The BSKs are phosphorylated by BRI1 in vitro and interact with BRI1 in vivo . Genetic and transgenic studies demonstrate that the BSKs represent a small family of kinases that activate BR signaling downstream of BRI1. These results demonstrate that BSKs are the substrates of BRI1 kinase that activate downstream BR signal transduction.
