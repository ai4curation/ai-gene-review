The major human abasic endonuclease, Ape1, is an essential DNA repair enzyme 
that initiates the removal of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites from DNA, excises 3' 
replication-blocking moieties, and modulates the DNA binding activity of several 
transcriptional regulators. We have determined the X-ray structure of the 
full-length human Ape1 enzyme in two new crystal forms, one at neutral and one 
at acidic pH. The new structures are generally similar to the previously 
determined structure of a truncated Ape1 protein, but differ in the conformation 
of several loop regions and in spans of residues with weak electron density. 
While only one active-site metal ion is present in the structure determined at 
low pH, the structure determined from a crystal grown at the pH optimum of Ape1 
nuclease activity, pH 7.5, has two metal ions bound 5 A apart in the active 
site. Enzyme kinetic data indicate that at least two metal-binding sites are 
functionally important, since Ca(2+) exhibits complex stimulatory and inhibitory 
effects on the Mg(2+)-dependent catalysis of Ape1, even though Ca(2+) itself 
does not serve as a cofactor. In conjunction, the structural and kinetic data 
suggest that Ape1 catalyzes hydrolysis of the DNA backbone through a two metal 
ion-mediated mechanism.
