The ESCRT pathway helps mediate the final abscission step of cytokinesis in 
mammals and archaea. In mammals, two early acting proteins of the ESCRT pathway, 
ALIX and TSG101, are recruited to the midbody through direct interactions with 
the phosphoprotein CEP55. CEP55 resides at the centrosome through most of the 
cell cycle but then migrates to the midbody at the start of cytokinesis, 
suggesting that the ESCRT pathway may also have centrosomal links. Here, we have 
systematically analyzed the requirements for late-acting mammalian ESCRT-III and 
VPS4 proteins at different stages of mitosis and cell division. We found that 
depletion of VPS4A, VPS4B, or any of the 11 different human ESCRT-III (CHMP) 
proteins inhibited abscission. Remarkably, depletion of individual ESCRT-III and 
VPS4 proteins also altered centrosome and spindle pole numbers, producing 
multipolar spindles (most ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins) or monopolar spindles (CHMP2A 
or CHMP5) and causing defects in chromosome segregation and nuclear morphology. 
VPS4 proteins concentrated at spindle poles during mitosis and then at midbodies 
during cytokinesis, implying that these proteins function directly at both 
sites. We conclude that ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins function at centrosomes to help 
regulate their maintenance or proliferation and then at midbodies during 
abscission, thereby helping ensure the ordered progression through the different 
stages of cell division.

Abstract

The ESCRT pathway helps mediate the final abscission step of cytokinesis in mammals and archaea. In mammals, two early acting proteins of the ESCRT pathway, ALIX and TSG101, are recruited to the midbody through direct interactions with the phosphoprotein CEP55. CEP55 resides at the centrosome through most of the cell cycle but then migrates to the midbody at the start of cytokinesis, suggesting that the ESCRT pathway may also have centrosomal links. Here, we have systematically analyzed the requirements for late-acting mammalian ESCRT-III and VPS4 proteins at different stages of mitosis and cell division. We found that depletion of VPS4A, VPS4B, or any of the 11 different human ESCRT-III (CHMP) proteins inhibited abscission. Remarkably, depletion of individual ESCRT-III and VPS4 proteins also altered centrosome and spindle pole numbers, producing multipolar spindles (most ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins) or monopolar spindles (CHMP2A or CHMP5) and causing defects in chromosome segregation and nuclear morphology. VPS4 proteins concentrated at spindle poles during mitosis and then at midbodies during cytokinesis, implying that these proteins function directly at both sites. We conclude that ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins function at centrosomes to help regulate their maintenance or proliferation and then at midbodies during abscission, thereby helping ensure the ordered progression through the different stages of cell division.

Discussion

Recent studies have shown that the ESCRT pathway functions in abscission and that this is an ancestral function that predates the divergence of archaea and eukaryotes ( 6 , 7 , 25 ). We now report that, in addition to their anticipated roles in abscission, most ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins are also required for centrosome and spindle maintenance. The centrosomal defects in cells depleted of ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins were often striking and highly penetrant. For example, approximately 80% of HeLa cells lacking VPS4B exhibited multiple centrosomes during the first mitosis after protein depletion ( Fig. 3 D ) and most had five or more centrosomes.

Our study demonstrates a functional role for late-acting ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins at mammalian centrosomes/spindles. However, a series of previous observations have suggested possible links between other ESCRT proteins and centrosomes and/or mitotic functions. ( i ) We and others have previously reported that a series of different ESCRT proteins can localize to centrosomes, microtubule organizing centers, and/or mitotic spindles, including ESCRT-I ( 4 , 26 , 27 ), ALIX ( 4 ), ESCRT-II ( 28 ), and IST1 ( 22 ). ( ii ) The TSG101 subunit of ESCRT-I was originally identified as a tumor susceptibility gene whose reduction induced mitotic abnormalities and aneuploidy ( 26 ). ( iii ) Cell division defects observed in Arabidopsis elc/tsg101 mutants were attributed to possible microtubule misregulation ( 29 ). ( iv ) The Drosophila homolog of CHMP5 was identified in a genome-wide siRNA screen for suppressors of multipolar mitoses ( 30 ). ( v ) S. pombe dot2/eap30/vps22 (ESCRT-II) mutants were reported to overamplify their spindle pole bodies (equivalent to mammalian centrosomes) during meiosis, although not during mitosis ( 31 ). ( vi ) Finally, a study focused on possible CHMP1A nuclear functions demonstrated that overexpression of this ESCRT-III protein caused cells to arrest with 4C DNA content ( 32 ). Together with the results from this study, these observations collectively suggest that the entire ESCRT pathway probably exerts centrosomal and possibly other functions that are conserved across fission yeast, plants, and mammals. The late-acting ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins appear to play the most critical roles in centrosome maintenance, however, because their depletion induced stronger mitotic defects than did depletion of early-acting ESCRT factors such as TSG101 and ALIX (e.g., Figs. 1 – 3 ).

At least a subset of ESCRT pathway components appear to follow a recurring protein trafficking pathway in which proteins localize to centrosomes for most of the cell cycle, and then relocalize to the midbody to function during cytokinesis. This behavior is well documented for CEP55, which migrates from the centrosome to the midbody upon phosphorylation by Cdk1 and Erk2 ( 18 , 33 , 34 ). Cell cycle–dependent centrosomal and midbody localization patterns have now also been reported for IST1 ( 22 ) and VPS4 (this study) and for the CHMP4-binding protein, TTC19, which was recently show to translocate together with its binding partner, FYVE-CENT, from centrosomes to midbodies ( 35 ). Furthermore, our current study shows that ESCRT-III and VPS4 proteins are required for proper functioning of both centrosomes and midbodies, supporting the idea that the ESCRT pathway and its accessory factors help control multiple steps in the transition from mitosis to cytokinesis, perhaps with parallels to the well-characterized mitotic exit and septation initiation networks in yeast and plants ( 36 ). Localization of VPS4 to both centrosomes and midbodies seems to imply that the protein functions directly at both sites. At present, however, we cannot rule out indirect effects because VPS4 activity is required for normal endosomal trafficking ( 1 , 5 , 8 ), and endosomes participate in cleavage furrow ingression and cytokinesis ( 37 ).

Defining the mechanism(s) by which ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins help maintain proper centrosome numbers is complicated because centrosome amplification and fragmentation can occur via several different mechanisms (reviewed in ref. 38 ) and because the centrosomal phenotypes we observed were quite complex (e.g., CHMP2A and VPS4B depletion altered the size and abundance of the pericentriolar matrix in different ways). One attractive possibility is that ESCRT-III/VPS4 proteins may help control centrosome numbers via interactions with machinery that regulates centriole disengagement and licenses centrosomes for duplication. In particular, the protein CC2D1A(Aki1) was recently shown to help control centrosome disengagement and duplication ( 39 ) and has also been identified as a potential CHMP4 binding protein in yeast two hybrid screens ( 40 ). Alternatively, it is possible that changes in centrosome numbers could reflect centrosome fragmentation and/or alterations in centrosome clustering. Indeed, the “single” centrosomes in CHMP2A-depleted cells sometimes appeared to be clustered (e.g., see the leftmost image in row 3 of Fig. S3 ), and the Drosophila homolog of CHMP5 (termed CG6259) was identified in a global siRNA screen for proteins involved in centrosomal clustering ( 30 ). In that case, the supernumerary centrosomes of Drosophila S2 cells reportedly formed multipolar spindles in the absence of CHMP5, suggesting that CHMP5 can help cluster multiple centrosomes into bipolar spindles.

It remains to be determined whether known ESCRT-III/VPS4 activities like ring formation, force generation, and/or membrane constriction and fission could function in centrosome duplication. One possibility is that polymeric centrosomal ESCRT-III/VPS4 assemblies could serve as scaffolds that recruit or modulate important activities of the centrosome. For example, the ESCRT-III protein CHMP1B binds specifically to the AAA ATPase spastin and thereby recruits this microtubule severing protein to the midbody ( 24 ). It is conceivable that analogous microtubule remodeling activities might be used at mitotic spindles, consistent with the suggestion that spindle microtubule misregulation is responsible for cell division defects in Arabidopsis cells lacking TSG101 ( 29 ).

Finally, it is intriguing that two ESCRT-III proteins, CHMP3 and CHMP4, were recently reported to localize to kinetochores in a global screen for proteins with possible mitotic functions ( 41 ). Thus, it appears possible that the ESCRT pathway is highly integrated into the biology of centrosomes, spindles, and possibly other mitotic machinery. This integration could allow ESCRT proteins to help coordinate three fundamental processes that must occur during cell division: chromosome segregation, centrosome duplication, and cytokinesis. We speculate that the evolution of centrosomal functions for the primordial ESCRT abscission machinery may have helped to ensure the ordered coupling of these essential steps of cell division.
