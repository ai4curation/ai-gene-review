Biochemical investigations in rodents have shown that numerous mineralized 
matrix proteins share expression in bone, dentin, and cementum. Little 
information is available regarding the expression pattern of these proteins in 
human tissues, particularly during tooth formation. The aim of this study was to 
identify the expression pattern of the two major noncollagenous proteins of bone 
and dentin, osteocalcin (OC) and osteonectin (ON), in comparison to the 
dentin-specific protein, dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP). Mandibles from 
fetuses (5-26 weeks), neonate autopsies, forming teeth from 10-12-year-old 
patients, third molars extracted for orthodontic reasons, and bone tumors were 
collected with approval from the National Ethics Committee. Human OC, ON, and 
DSPP mRNAs were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) in fetal mandibles (5-11 weeks) and in primary cell cultures of dental 
pulp. In addition, OC, ON, and DSPP proteins were localized in forming human 
mineralized tissues using immunohistochemistry. In vivo, DSPP expression was 
associated with tooth terminal epithelial-mesenchymal interaction events, 
amelogenesis and dentinogenesis. Transient DSPP expression was seen in the 
presecretory ameloblasts with continuous expression in the odontoblasts. In 
contrast, both osteoblasts and odontoblasts showed a temporal gap between OC and 
ON expression in early development. ON was expressed in the initial stages of 
cytodifferentiation, whereas OC was expressed only during the later stages, 
especially in the teeth. At the maturation stage of enamel formation, both 
proteins were detected in odontoblasts and their processes within the 
extracellular matrix. In contrast to bone, OC was not localized extracellularly 
within the collagen-rich dentin matrix (predentin or intertubular dentin), but 
was found in the mature enamel. ON was present mostly in the nonmineralized 
predentin. These results demonstrate for the first time that both OC and ON are 
produced by human odontoblasts and determine the expression pattern of DSPP in 
human teeth, and suggest that OC and ON move inside the canalicule via 
odontoblast cell processes becoming localized to specific extracellular 
compartments during dentin and enamel formation. These distinct extracellular 
patterns may be related to the nature of DSPP, OC, and ON interactions with 
other matrix-specific macromolecules (i.e., amelogenin, dentin matrix protein-1) 
and/or to the polarized organization of odontoblast secretion as compared with 
osteoblasts.
