The PMP22/EMP/MP20 gene family includes four closely related proteins, 
peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22), epithelial membrane protein-1 (EMP-1), 
epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP-2), and epithelial membrane protein-3 
(EMP-3), which share amino acid identities ranging from 33 to 43%. In addition, 
the lens-specific membrane protein MP20 represents a more distant relative. 
Functionally, this family of proteins is likely to play important roles in the 
control of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell death. In 
particular, mutations affecting the PMP22 gene are responsible for various 
hereditary peripheral neuropathies in humans and mice. We report the isolation 
and characterization of a mouse EMP-1 cDNA and the corresponding emp-1 gene. 
Mouse EMP-1 displays 93% amino acid identity to rat EMP-1 and 39% identity to 
mouse PMP22. The cDNA-predicted EMP-1 protein contains four putative 
membrane-associated domains and can be N-linked glycosylated in vitro. EMP-1 is 
encoded by a single-copy gene with the positions of introns exactly conserved 
between emp-1 and PMP22, corroborating the hypothesis that both genes belong to 
the same family. Computer-predicted structural domains of EMP-1 are partially 
mirrored by the exon/intron structure of emp-1. Most interestingly, exon 4, 
which covers the potential second transmembrane domain, a small intracellular 
loop, and half of the third transmembrane domain, encodes the most highly 
conserved regions between the EMP-1 and PMP22 proteins and is also remarkably 
conserved in the MP20 gene, indicating some shared functional significance for 
this module in the PMP22/EMP/MP20 family.
