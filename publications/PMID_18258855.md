PICOT (protein kinase C-interacting cousin of thioredoxin) was previously shown 
to inhibit pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant with an 
increase in ventricular function and cardiomyocyte contractility. The combined 
analyses of glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments and mass 
spectrometry enabled us to determine that PICOT directly interacts with muscle 
LIM protein (MLP) via its carboxyl-terminal half (PICOT-C). It was also shown 
that PICOT colocalizes with MLP in the Z-disc. MLP is known to play a role in 
anchoring calcineurin to the Z-disc in the sarcomere, which is critical for 
calcineurin-NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) signaling. We, therefore, 
suggested that PICOT may affect calcineurin-NFAT signaling through its 
interaction with MLP. Consistent with this hypothesis, PICOT, or more 
specifically PICOT-C, abrogated phenylephrine-induced increases in calcineurin 
phosphatase activity, NFAT dephosphorylation/nuclear translocation, and 
NFAT-dependent transcriptional activation in neonatal cardiomyocytes. In 
addition, pressure overload-induced upregulation of NFAT target genes was 
significantly diminished in the hearts of PICOT-overexpressing transgenic mice. 
PICOT interfered with MLP-calcineurin interactions in a dose-dependent manner. 
Moreover, calcineurin was displaced from the Z-disc, concomitant with an 
abrogated interaction between calcineurin and MLP, in the hearts of PICOT 
transgenic mice. Replenishment of MLP restored the hypertrophic responses and 
the increase in calcineurin phosphatase activity that was inhibited by PICOT in 
phenylephrine-treated cardiomyocytes. Finally, PICOT-C inhibited cardiac 
hypertrophy to an extent that was comparable to that of full-length PICOT. Taken 
together, these data suggest that PICOT inhibits cardiac hypertrophy largely by 
negatively regulating calcineurin-NFAT signaling via disruption of the 
MLP-calcineurin interaction.
