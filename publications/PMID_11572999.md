Spore formation by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis has long been studied as a 
model for cellular differentiation, but predominantly as a single cell. When 
analyzed within the context of highly structured, surface-associated communities 
(biofilms), spore formation was discovered to have heretofore unsuspected 
spatial organization. Initially, motile cells differentiated into aligned chains 
of attached cells that eventually produced aerial structures, or fruiting 
bodies, that served as preferential sites for sporulation. Fruiting body 
formation depended on regulatory genes required early in sporulation and on 
genes evidently needed for exopolysaccharide and surfactin production. The 
formation of aerial structures was robust in natural isolates but not in 
laboratory strains, an indication that multicellularity has been lost during 
domestication of B. subtilis. Other microbial differentiation processes long 
thought to involve only single cells could display the spatial organization 
characteristic of multicellular organisms when studied with recent natural 
isolates.
