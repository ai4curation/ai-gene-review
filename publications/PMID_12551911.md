The armadillo protein SmgGDS promotes guanine nucleotide exchange by small 
GTPases containing a C-terminal polybasic region (PBR), such as Rac1 and RhoA. 
Because the PBR resembles a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, we 
investigated the nuclear transport of SmgGDS with Rac1 or RhoA. We show that the 
Rac1 PBR has significant NLS activity when it is fused to green fluorescent 
protein (GFP) or in the context of full-length Rac1. In contrast, the RhoA PBR 
has very poor NLS activity when it is fused to GFP or in the context of 
full-length RhoA. The nuclear accumulation of both Rac1 and SmgGDS is enhanced 
by Rac1 activation and diminished by mutation of the Rac1 PBR. Conversely, 
SmgGDS nuclear accumulation is diminished by interactions with RhoA. An SmgGDS 
nuclear export signal sequence that we identified promotes SmgGDS nuclear 
export. These results suggest that SmgGDS. Rac1 complexes accumulate in the 
nucleus because the Rac1 PBR has NLS activity and because Rac1 supplies the 
appropriate GTP-dependent signal. In contrast, SmgGDS.RhoA complexes accumulate 
in the cytoplasm because the RhoA PBR does not have NLS activity. This model may 
be applicable to other armadillo proteins in addition to SmgGDS, because we 
demonstrate that activated Rac1 and RhoA also provide stimulatory and inhibitory 
signals, respectively, for the nuclear accumulation of p120 catenin. These 
results indicate that small GTPases with a PBR can regulate the nuclear 
transport of armadillo proteins.
