Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset Motor Neuron 
Disease (MND), characterized by motor neurons death in the cortex, brainstem and 
spinal cord. Ten loci linked to Familial ALS have been mapped. ALS8 is caused by 
a substitution of a proline by a serine in the Vesicle-Associated Membrane 
Protein-Associated protein-B/C (VAP-B/C). VAP-B belongs to a highly conserved 
family of proteins implicated in Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi and intra-Golgi 
transport and microtubules stabilization. Previous studies demonstrated that the 
P56S mutation disrupts the subcellular localization of VAP-B and that this 
position would be essential for Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) induced by 
VAP-B. In the present work we expressed and purified recombinant wild-type and 
P56S mutant VAP-B-MSP domain for the analysis of its interactions with other 
cellular proteins. Our findings suggest that the P56S mutation may lead to a 
less stable interaction of this endoplasmic reticulum protein with at least two 
other proteins: tubulin and GAPDH. These two proteins have been previously 
related to other forms of neurodegenerative diseases and are potential key 
points to understand ALS8 pathogenesis and other forms of MND. Understanding the 
role of these protein interactions may help the treatment of this devastating 
disease in the future.
