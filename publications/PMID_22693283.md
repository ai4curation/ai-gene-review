BACKGROUND: The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) comprise a group of 
clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders characterised by myoclonus, 
epilepsy, and neurological deterioration. This study aimed to identify the 
underlying gene(s) in childhood onset PME patients with unknown molecular 
genetic background.
METHODS: Homozygosity mapping was applied on genome-wide single nucleotide 
polymorphism data of 18 Turkish patients. The potassium channel tetramerisation 
domain-containing 7 (KCTD7) gene, previously associated with PME in a single 
inbred family, was screened for mutations. The spatiotemporal expression of 
KCTD7 was assessed in cellular cultures and mouse brain tissue.
RESULTS: Overlapping homozygosity in 8/18 patients defined a 1.5 Mb segment on 
7q11.21 as the major candidate locus. Screening of the positional candidate gene 
KCTD7 revealed homozygous missense mutations in two of the eight cases. 
Screening of KCTD7 in a further 132 PME patients revealed four additional 
mutations (two missense, one in-frame deletion, and one frameshift-causing) in 
five families. Eight patients presented with myoclonus and epilepsy and one with 
ataxia, the mean age of onset being 19 months. Within 2 years after onset, 
progressive loss of mental and motor skills ensued leading to severe dementia 
and motor handicap. KCTD7 showed cytosolic localisation and predominant neuronal 
expression, with widespread expression throughout the brain. None of three 
polypeptides carrying patient missense mutations affected the subcellular 
distribution of KCTD7.
DISCUSSION: These data confirm the causality of KCTD7 defects in PME, and imply 
that KCTD7 mutation screening should be considered in PME patients with onset 
around 2 years of age followed by rapid mental and motor deterioration.
