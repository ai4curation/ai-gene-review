Second-phase insulin release requires the sustained mobilization of insulin 
granules from internal storage pools to the cell surface for fusion with the 
plasma membrane. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process remain 
largely unknown. GTP-loading of the small GTPase Cdc42 is the first 
glucose-specific activation step in the process, although how glucose triggers 
Cdc42 activation is entirely unknown. In a directed candidate screen for guanine 
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which directly activate small GTPases, 
Cool-1/βPix was identified in pancreatic islet beta cells. In support of its 
role as the beta cell Cdc42 GEF, βPix coimmunoprecipitated with Cdc42 in human 
islets and MIN6 beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner, peaking just prior to 
Cdc42 activation. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated βPix reduction by 50% corresponded 
to full ablation of glucose-induced Cdc42 activation and significant attenuation 
of basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Of the two Cdc42 guanine 
nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) proteins identified in beta cells, βPix 
competed selectively with caveolin-1 (Cav-1) but not RhoGDI in 
coimmunoprecipitation and GST-Cdc42-GDP interaction assays. However, a 
phospho-deficient Cav-1-Y14F mutant failed to compete with βPix; Cav-1(Tyr14) is 
an established phosphorylation site for Src kinase. Taken together, these data 
support a new model, wherein glucose stimulates Cav-1 and induces its 
dissociation from Cdc42, possibly via Src kinase activation to phosphorylate 
Cav-1(Tyr14), to promote Cdc42-βPix binding and Cdc42 activation, and to trigger 
downstream signaling and ultimately sustain insulin release.
