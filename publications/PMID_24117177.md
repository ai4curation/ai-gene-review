PCPE-1 (procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-1) is an extracellular matrix 
glycoprotein that can stimulate procollagen processing by procollagen 
C-proteinases such as BMP-1 (bone morphogenetic protein 1). PCPE-1 interacts 
with several proteins in addition to procollagens and BMP-1, suggesting that it 
could be involved in biological processes other than collagen maturation. We 
thus searched for additional partners of PCPE-1 in the extracellular matrix, 
which could provide new insights into its biological roles. We identified 17 new 
partners of PCPE-1 by SPR (surface plasmon resonance) imaging. PCPE-1 forms a 
transient complex with the β-amyloid peptide, whereas it forms high or very high 
affinity complexes with laminin-111 (KD=58.8 pM), collagen VI (KD=9.5 nM), TSP-1 
(thrombospondin-1) (KD1=19.9 pM, KD2=14.5 nM), collagen IV (KD=49.4 nM) and 
endostatin, a fragment of collagen XVIII (KD1=0.30 nM, KD2=1.1 nM). Endostatin 
binds to the NTR (netrin-like) domain of PCPE-1 and decreases the degree of 
superstimulation of PCPE-1 enhancing activity by heparin. The analysis of the 
PCPE-1 interaction network based on Gene Ontology terms suggests that, besides 
its role in collagen deposition, PCPE-1 might be involved in tumour growth, 
neurodegenerative diseases and angiogenesis. In vitro assays have indeed shown 
that the CUB1CUB2 (where CUB is complement protein subcomponents C1r/C1s, urchin 
embryonic growth factor and BMP-1) fragment of PCPE-1 inhibits angiogenesis.
