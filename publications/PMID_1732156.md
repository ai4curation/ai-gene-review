Dauer larva formation in Caenorhabditis elegans is controlled by chemosensory 
cells that respond to environmental cues. Genetic interactions among mutations 
in 23 genes that affect dauer larva formation were investigated. Mutations in 
seven genes that cause constitutive dauer formation, and mutations in 16 genes 
that either block dauer formation or result in the formation of abnormal dauers, 
were analyzed. Double mutants between dauer-constitutive and dauer-defective 
mutations were constructed and characterized for their capacity to form dauer 
larvae. Many of the genes could be interpreted to lie in a simple linear 
epistasis pathway. Three genes, daf-16, daf-18 and daf-20, may affect downstream 
steps in a branched part of the pathway. Three other genes, daf-2, daf-3 and 
daf-5, displayed partial or complex epistasis interactions that were difficult 
to interpret as part of a simple linear pathway. Dauer-defective mutations in 
nine genes cause structurally defective chemosensory cilia, thereby blocking 
chemosensation. Mutations in all nine of these genes appear to fall at a single 
step in the epistasis pathway. Dauer-constitutive mutations in one gene, daf-11, 
were strongly suppressed for dauer formation by mutations in the nine 
cilium-structure genes. Mutations in the other six dauer-constitutive genes 
caused dauer formation despite the absence of functional chemosensory endings. 
These results suggest that daf-11 is directly involved in chemosensory 
transduction essential for dauer formation, while the other Daf-c genes play 
roles downstream of the chemosensory step.
