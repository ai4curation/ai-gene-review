(6R)-L-erythro 5,6,7,8 tetrahydrobiopterin (6BH4) is crucial in the 
hydroxylation of L-phenylalanine-, L-tyrosine-, and L-tryptophan-regulating 
catecholamine and serotonin synthesis as well as tyrosinase in melanogenesis. 
The rate-limiting step of 6BH4 de novo synthesis is controlled by guanosine 
triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase I (GTPCHI) and its feedback regulatory protein 
(GFRP), where binding of L-phenylalanine to GFRP increases enzyme activities, 
while 6BH4 exerts the opposite effect. Earlier it was demonstrated that the 
human epidermis holds the full capacity for autocrine 6BH4 de novo synthesis and 
recycling. However, besides the expression of epidermal mRNA for GFRP, the 
presence of a functioning GFRP feedback has never been shown. Therefore, it was 
tempting to investigate whether this important mechanism is present in epidermal 
cells. Our results identified indeed a functioning GFRP/GTPCHI axis in epidermal 
keratinocytes and melanocytes in the cytosol, adding the missing link for 6BH4 
de novo synthesis which in turn controls cofactor supply for catecholamine and 
serotonin biosynthesis as well as melanogenesis in the human epidermis. 
Moreover, GFRP expression and GTPCHI activities have been found in the nucleus 
of both cell types. The significance of this result warrants further 
investigation.
