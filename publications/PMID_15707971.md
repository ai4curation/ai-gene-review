Mammalian rpS3, a ribosomal protein S3 with a DNA repair endonuclease activity, 
nicks heavily UV-irradiated DNA and DNA containing AP sites. RpS3 calls for a 
novel endonucleolytic activity on AP sites generated from pyrimidine dimers by 
T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase activity. This study revealed that rpS3 cleaves 
the lesions including AP sites, thymine glycols, and other UV damaged lesions 
such as pyrimidine dimers. This enzyme does not have a glycosylase activity as 
predicted from its amino acid sequence. However, it has an endonuclease activity 
on DNA containing thymine glycol, which is exactly overlapped with UV-irradiated 
or AP DNAs, indicating that rpS3 cleaves phosphodiester bonds of DNAs containing 
altered bases with broad specificity acting as a base-damage-endonuclease. RpS3 
cleaves supercoiled UV damaged DNA more efficiently than the relaxed 
counterpart, and the endonuclease activity of rpS3 was inhibited by MgCl2 on AP 
DNA but not on UV-irradiated DNA.
