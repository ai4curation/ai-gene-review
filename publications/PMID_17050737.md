The ubiquitin-binding RPN-10 protein serves as a ubiquitin receptor that 
delivers client proteins to the 26S proteasome. Although ubiquitin recognition 
is an essential step for proteasomal destruction, deletion of the rpn-10 gene in 
yeast does not influence viability, indicating redundancy of the substrate 
delivery pathway. However, their specificity and biological relevance in higher 
eukaryotes is still enigmatic. We report herein that knockdown of the rpn-10 
gene, but not any other proteasome subunit genes, sexually transforms 
hermaphrodites to females by eliminating hermaphrodite spermatogenesis in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. The feminization phenotype induced by deletion of the 
rpn-10 gene was rescued by knockdown of tra-2, one of sexual fate decision genes 
promoting female development, and its downstream target tra-1, indicating that 
the TRA-2-mediated sex determination pathway is crucial for the Delta 
rpn-10-induced sterile phenotype. Intriguingly, we found that co-knockdown of 
rpn-10 and functionally related ubiquitin ligase ufd-2 overcomes the 
germline-musculinizing effect of fem-3(gf). Furthermore, TRA-2 proteins 
accumulated in rpn-10-defective worms. Our results show that the RPN-10-mediated 
ubiquitin pathway is indispensable for control of the TRA-2-mediated 
sex-determining pathway.
