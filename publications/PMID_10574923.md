Cellular responses to viral infection are signaled by double-stranded (ds) RNA, 
which is not found in substantial amounts in uninfected cells. Although cellular 
dsRNA-binding proteins have been described, their characterization is 
incomplete. We show that dsRNA-binding proteins are prominent autoantigens. Sera 
from B6 and B10.S mice with pristane-induced lupus and human autoimmune sera 
immunoprecipitated a novel set of 130-, 110-, 90-, 80-, and 45-kDa proteins. The 
proteins were all major cellular poly(IC)-binding factors. N-terminal amino acid 
sequences of p110 and p90 were identical and matched nuclear factor (NF) 90 and 
M phase phosphoprotein 4. p45 and p90 were identified as the NF45.NF90 complex, 
which binds the interleukin-2 promoter as well as certain highly structured 
viral RNAs. NF90.NF45 and M phase phosphoprotein 4 belong to a large group of 
proteins with conserved dsRNA-binding motifs. Besides binding dsRNA, NF90.NF45, 
p110, and p130 had single-stranded and dsDNA binding activity. Some sera 
contained autoantibodies whose binding was inhibited by poly(IC) but not 
single-stranded DNA or vice versa, suggesting that the DNA- and RNA-binding 
sites are different. These autoantibodies will be useful probes of the function 
of dsRNA-binding proteins. Their interaction with dsRNA, an immunological 
adjuvant, also could promote autoimmunity.
