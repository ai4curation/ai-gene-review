The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizes rapidly responding mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades to adapt efficiently to a changing 
environment. Here we report that phosphorylation of Cdc37p, an Hsp90 
cochaperone, by casein kinase 2 controls the functionality of two MAPK cascades 
in yeast. These pathways, the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway and the 
cell integrity (protein kinase C) MAPK pathway, mediate adaptive responses to 
high osmotic and cell wall stresses, respectively. Mutation of the 
phosphorylation site Ser14 in Cdc37p renders cells sensitive to osmotic stress 
and cell wall perturbation by calcofluor white. We found that levels of the 
MAPKs Hog1p and Slt2p (Mpk1p) in cells are reduced in a cdc37-S14A mutant, and 
consequently downstream responses mediated by Hog1p and Slt2p are compromised. 
Furthermore, we present evidence that Hog1p and Slt2p both interact in a complex 
with Cdc37p in vivo, something that has not been reported previously. The 
interaction of Hsp90, Slt2p, and Hog1p with Cdc37p depends on the 
phosphorylation status of Cdc37p. In fact, our biochemical data show that the 
osmosensitive phenotype of the cdc37-S14A mutant is due to the loss of the 
interaction between Cdc37p, Hog1p, and Hsp90. Likewise, during cell wall stress, 
the interaction of Slt2p with Cdc37p and Hsp90 is crucial for Slt2p-dependent 
downstream responses, such as the activation of the transcription factor Rlm1p. 
Interestingly, phosphorylated Slt2p, but not phosphorylated Hog1p, has an 
increased affinity for Cdc37p. Together these observations suggest that Cdc37p 
acts as a regulator of MAPK signaling.
