How chaperone interactions affect protein folding pathways is a central problem 
in biology. With the use of optical tweezers and all-atom molecular dynamics 
simulations, we studied the effect of chaperone SecB on the folding and 
unfolding pathways of maltose binding protein (MBP) at the single-molecule 
level. In the absence of SecB, we find that the MBP polypeptide first collapses 
into a molten globulelike compacted state and then folds into a stable core 
structure onto which several alpha helices are finally wrapped. Interactions 
with SecB completely prevent stable tertiary contacts in the core structure but 
have no detectable effect on the folding of the external alpha helices. It 
appears that SecB only binds to the extended or molten globulelike structure and 
retains MBP in this latter state. Thus during MBP translocation, no energy is 
required to disrupt stable tertiary interactions.
