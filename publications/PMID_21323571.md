Proinflammatory interleukin-18 (IL-18), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
(hS-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and anti-inflammatory IL-10 
are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was 
to determine the imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in 
premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) and their association with the degree 
of angiographic atherosclerotic blockade. A case-control study was carried out 
at the National Institute of Heart Diseases, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Three hundred 
eighty-five stable coronary artery disease patients aged <45 years were 
screened. A total of 172 subjects participated in this study, comprising 98 PCAD 
patients and 74 angionegative controls. Serum IL-10, IL-18, and TNF-alpha were 
measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and hS-CRP was analyzed using 
Immulite 1000. The mean age of the patients was 40 ± 4.23 years (69 men and 9 
women). Serum IL-18, TNF-alpha, hS-CRP, and IL-18/IL-10 ratio were significantly 
raised in PCAD patients (P<0.01), whereas IL-10 was moderately increased 
(P<0.05) when compared with controls. Serum IL-18 and hS-CRP were significantly 
raised in patients with 86%-100% stenosis (n=57) when compared with patients 
with 71%-85% stenosis (n=41) (P<0.05). Serum IL-18, TNF-alpha, IL-18/IL-10 
ratio, and hS-CRP significantly correlated (P<0.01) with the degree of 
angiographic blockade. Pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines play a vital role in the 
pathogenesis of PCAD and have potential to identify the degree of 
atherosclerosis.
