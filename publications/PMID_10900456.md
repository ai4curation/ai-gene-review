A set of seven structurally related Sm proteins forms the core of the snRNP 
particles containing the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs. A search of the 
genomic sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has identified a number of open 
reading frames that potentially encode structurally similar proteins termed Lsm 
(Like Sm) proteins. With the aim of analysing all possible interactions between 
the Lsm proteins and any protein encoded in the yeast genome, we performed 
exhaustive and iterative genomic two-hybrid screens, starting with the Lsm 
proteins as baits. Indeed, extensive interactions amongst eight Lsm proteins 
were found that suggest the existence of a Lsm complex or complexes. These Lsm 
interactions apparently involve the conserved Sm domain that also mediates 
interactions between the Sm proteins. The screens also reveal functionally 
significant interactions with splicing factors, in particular with Prp4 and 
Prp24, compatible with genetic studies and with the reported association of Lsm 
proteins with spliceosomal U6 and U4/U6 particles. In addition, interactions 
with proteins involved in mRNA turnover, such as Mrt1, Dcp1, Dcp2 and Xrn1, 
point to roles for Lsm complexes in distinct RNA metabolic processes, that are 
confirmed in independent functional studies. These results provide compelling 
evidence that two-hybrid screens yield functionally meaningful information about 
protein-protein interactions and can suggest functions for uncharacterized 
proteins, especially when they are performed on a genome-wide scale.
