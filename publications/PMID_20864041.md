The melanoma antigen (MAGE) family consists of more than 60 genes, many of which 
are cancer-testis antigens that are highly expressed in cancer and play a 
critical role in tumorigenesis. However, the biochemical and cellular functions 
of this enigmatic family of proteins have remained elusive. Here, we identify 
really interesting new gene (RING) domain proteins as binding partners for MAGE 
family proteins. Multiple MAGE family proteins bind E3 RING ubiquitin ligases 
with specificity. The crystal structure of one of these MAGE-RING complexes, 
MAGE-G1-NSE1, reveals structural insights into MAGE family proteins and their 
interaction with E3 RING ubiquitin ligases. Biochemical and cellular assays 
demonstrate that MAGE proteins enhance the ubiquitin ligase activity of RING 
domain proteins. For example, MAGE-C2-TRIM28 is shown to target p53 for 
degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner, consistent with its tumorigenic 
functions. These findings define a biochemical and cellular function for the 
MAGE protein family.

INTRODUCTION

Cancer-testis antigens are genes whose expression is typically restricted to cells of the germline and trophoblast lineage but are aberrantly expressed in a wide variety of human tumors ( Simpson et al., 2005 ). The list of cancer-testis antigens has grown during the past two decades to include more than 100 different genes, with additional genes continuing to be discovered ( Scanlan et al., 2004 ). The majority of these genes are on the X chromosome as multigene families that share a common genomic locus ( Scanlan et al., 2002 ). These include the melanoma antigen (MAGE), G antigen (GAGE), and X chromosome antigen (XAGE) multigene families. Evolutionarily, these gene families have recently undergone expansion and share high sequence homology between family members ( Scanlan et al., 2002 ). In addition, they are often under similar transcriptional regulation, resulting in their coexpression, typically in the highly proliferative spermatogonia germ cells ( Jungbluth et al., 2000 ). The function of cancer-testis antigens within germ cells is unknown.

The first cancer-testis antigen, MZ2-E (now known as MAGE-A1), was discovered in 1991 as a cell surface antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules mediating cytotoxic T cell recognition of melanoma cells ( van der Bruggen et al., 1991 ). Additional MAGE family genes were later identified by sequence homology. The MAGE family comprises more than 60 genes in humans, some of which are predicted pseudogenes ( Chomez et al., 2001 ). The MAGE family of proteins is divided into two classes based on their expression pattern, the type I cancer-testis antigen and the type II ubiquitous MAGEs ( Barker and Salehi, 2002 ). Type I MAGEs comprise more than 45 genes encoded in three clusters on the X chromosome, including 12 MAGE-A, 18 MAGE-B, and seven MAGE-C genes ( Chomez et al., 2001 ). Type II MAGEs consist of 15 genes whose genomic loci are not restricted to the X chromosome, including four MAGE-D, three MAGE-E, MAGE-F1, MAGE-G1, MAGE-H1, two MAGE-I, MAGE-K1, MAGE-L2, and NECDIN genes ( Chomez et al., 2001 ). Unlike the type I MAGE cancer-testis antigens, type II MAGE genes are not restricted to germline expression and are expressed in a variety of tissues ( Ohman Forslund and Nordqvist, 2001 ). Type II MAGEs have also been implicated in human pathologies. For example, the maternally imprinted type II MAGEs, MAGE-L2 and Necdin, are implicated in the development of the neurobehavioral disorder known as Prader-Willi syndrome ( Gérard et al., 1999 ; Jay et al., 1997 ; Kozlov et al., 2007 ).

Both type I and type II MAGE proteins share a conserved domain known as the MAGE homology domain (MHD). The MHD is ~170 amino acids long and can be evolutionarily traced back to protozoa ( Barker and Salehi, 2002 ; López-Sánchez et al., 2007 ). In general, MHDs are quite similar to one another, even between type I and type II MAGEs. On average, all human MHDs are 46% conserved at the amino acid level ( Figure S1A available online). The MHDs in specific subfamilies are even more conserved, such as 75% conservation between the four human MAGE-D MHDs and 70% between the twelve human MAGE-A MHDs ( Figure S1A ). Even though these domains are common and conserved, the biochemical function of the MHD has remained unknown.

The specific expression of type I MAGE genes in tumor, but not normal, somatic cells has been extensively investigated. DNA methylation of type I MAGE gene promoters prevents their expression in normal somatic cells ( De Smet et al., 1995 ; De Smet et al., 1999 ). However, type I MAGE genes are hypomethylated and highly expressed in a variety of cancer types, including brain, breast, liver, lung, ovarian, prostate, skin, testicular, and thyroid. The expression of several type I MAGEs is highest in more advanced diseases of several cancer types and correlates with poor prognosis in patients ( Bolli et al., 2002 ; Brasseur et al., 1995 ; Brichard and Lejeune, 2007 ; Dhodapkar et al., 2003 ; Patard et al., 1995 ). In addition, recent studies in mice have suggested an active role of MAGE proteins in tumor formation. In an orthotopic xenograft model of thyroid cancer, overexpression of MAGE-A3 promotes increased cell proliferation and primary tumor size, as well as increased number and size of lung metastatic foci ( Liu et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, knockdown of type I MAGE-B genes suppressed the growth of melanomas in xenograft mouse models ( Yang et al., 2007 ). In addition, MAGE and other cancer-testis antigens have been shown to facilitate the malignant phenotype by conferring resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and tumor necrosis factor ( Cilensek et al., 2002 ; Duan et al., 2003 ; Park et al., 2002 ). These results suggest that type I MAGE cancer-testis antigens display oncogenic properties that actively facilitate cancer cell survival, proliferation, tumor formation, and metastasis.

Type I MAGE proteins are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapies due to their specific expression and antigen presentation on a wide range of tumor, but not normal, cells. Extensive efforts have gone into developing anti-tumor antibodies and cancer vaccines toward type I MAGE cancer-testis antigens ( Brichard and Lejeune, 2007 ; Goldman and DeFrancesco, 2009 ). However, the biochemical function of cancer antigens, including MAGE proteins, within tumor and germ cells has been relatively understudied and remains a mystery. To discover the biochemical function of MAGE proteins within cells, we took an unbiased approach to identify binding partners of nine different MAGE family proteins, utilizing tandem affinity purification (TAP) coupled to mass spectrometry (TAP-MS). Using this approach, we identify E3 RING ubiquitin ligases as binding partners of MAGE proteins. Through structural and biochemical methods, we show that MAGE and RING domain proteins form active E3 ubiquitin ligases. These results define the biochemical function of MAGE proteins within cells.

DISCUSSION

Recent evidence suggests that type I MAGE cancer-testis antigens play an active role in tumorigenesis and cancer cell viability ( Cilensek et al., 2002 ; Duan et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2008 ; Yang et al., 2007 ). Furthermore, type II ubiquitous MAGE proteins are increasingly implicated in a number of important biological and pathological processes ( Barker and Salehi, 2002 ; Gérard et al., 1999 ; Jay et al., 1997 ; Kozlov et al., 2007 ; Ohman Forslund and Nordqvist, 2001 ; Pebernard et al., 2004 ). In spite of this, the biochemical and cellular mechanisms by which MAGE family proteins function in tumor, normal, and germ cells have remained elusive.

Through in vitro biochemical and cellular assays, we show that a general property conserved throughout the MAGE protein family is their binding to E3 RING proteins ( Figures 1 – 3 ). Of interest, several MAGEs bound members of the TRIM family E3 RING ubiquitin ligases, including TRIM27 and TRIM28 ( Figures 1 – 3 ). The TRIM family of proteins is a large and relatively poorly understood family of proteins implicated in a number of biological processes, including cell proliferation, development, apoptosis, and innate immunity ( Ozato et al., 2008 ). Whether additional TRIM family proteins also form MAGE-RING complexes will need to be investigated. Through in vitro binding assays, we show that MAGE-B18, MAGE-C2, and MAGE-G1 all bind E3 RING proteins through their MAGE homology domain (MHD) consisting of two winged-helix motifs ( Figure 3C ). However, the region on the E3 protein in which MAGEs bound was variable in amino acid composition, secondary structure, and distance from the RING domain ( Figure 3C ). Therefore, there may not be a common type of contact between the MHD of MAGE proteins and their cognate E3 proteins.

We further show that a general feature of both type I and type II MAGE proteins is not only binding to E3 RING ligases, but also enhancing their ubiquitin ligase activity ( Figures 5 and 6 ). The mechanisms behind this enhancement are currently not fully understood. One possible mechanism is that MAGE binding induces a conformational change of the RING protein, resulting in increased activity. However, this does not seem to be the case for MAGE-G1-NSE1, as MAGE-G1 binding does not alter NSE1 structure (M.Y. and P.R.P., unpublished data). A second possible mechanism would involve MAGEs facilitating substrate binding to the E2–E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. However, in the case of MAGE-TRIM28, MAGE-A2, -A3, -A6, and -C2 do not show appreciable direct binding to the p53 substrate or enhance TRIM28 binding to p53 ( Figures S6F–S6H ). A third possibility is that MAGEs stimulate E2 charging. However, MAGE-C2 did not affect the charging of the UbcH2 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme by the ubiquitin E1 ( Figure S6K ). Finally, we examined a fourth possible mechanism whereby MAGEs bind to and thereby help recruit E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to the E3-substrate complex. We observed that MAGE-A2 and MAGE-C2 did specifically bind the UbcH2, but not UbcH5b, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in cells and in vitro ( Figures S6I and S6J ). These results suggest that MAGEs may enhance ubiquitin ligase activity through recruitment and/or stabilization of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes at the E3-substrate complex. Several important questions arise from these findings. First, can MAGE-A2/C2 bind both UbcH2 and TRIM28 at the same time, or are they mutually exclusive? Second, does MAGE-A2/C2 binding to UbcH2 contribute to increased TRIM28 ubiquitin ligase activity? Finally, is the binding of MAGEs to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes conserved throughout the MAGE family, or do different MAGEs enhance E3 ubiquitin ligase activity by distinct mechanisms?

MAGE-G1 and NSE1 are part of the larger SMC5/6 complex that promotes homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair ( Potts, 2009 ; Potts et al., 2006 ). The biochemical function of MAGE-G1 (NSE3 in yeast) and NSE1 in DNA repair has been relatively enigmatic. We show that MAGE-G1 promotes the activity of NSE1 in the presence of the UbcH13/MMS2 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in vitro ( Figure 5A and data not shown). Of interest, UbcH13/MMS2 specifically catalyzes the formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains and has also been implicated in homologous recombination repair ( Zhao et al., 2007 ). It will be interesting in the future to examine the cofunctionality of MAGE-G1-NSE1 with UbcH13/MMS2 in cells and to determine their relevant ubiquitylation substrates contributing to homologous recombination-mediated double-strand break repair.

MAGE-A2, -A3, -A6, and -C2 are cancer-testis antigens specifically expressed in the germline and aberrantly expressed in a broad spectrum of tumors due to DNA hypomethylation ( Zhuang et al., 2006 ). We and others found MAGE-A2, -A3, -A6, and -C2 to interact with the TRIM28 E3 RING ubiquitin ligase ( Table S1 ) ( Yang et al., 2007 ). Of interest, TRIM28 has recently been reported to be overexpressed in gastric cancer and, similar to MAGE-A3, correlates with poorer patient survival ( Yokoe et al., 2010 ). We show here that one possible mechanism by which MAGE-A2, -A3, -A6, -C2, and TRIM28 contribute to tumorigenesis is through the ubiquitylation and degradation of p53 ( Figure 6 ). Consistent with our findings, Bonus, the Drosophila ortholog of the TIF1 family (including TRIM24, TRIM28, and TRIM33) also regulates Dm p53 ( Allton et al., 2009 ). Whether the Drosophila MAGE also regulates Bonus activity and therefore Dm p53 stability will need to be investigated. The importance of MAGE-RING ligase-mediated p53 inactivation in tumorigenesis is likely highlighted in tumors that do not frequently mutate p53, such as the case in melanomas ( Flørenes et al., 1994 ). In these cases, MAGE-RING ligases are ideal, cancer-specific drug targets.

In summary, our work has shed light on the mysterious structure and function of MAGE proteins. We show that both type I cancer-testis antigen and type II ubiquitous MAGEs bind to and activate RING E3 ubiquitin ligases. The identification of MAGE-RING ubiquitin ligases opens the door to understanding the biological and pathological function of both type I and type II MAGE proteins.
