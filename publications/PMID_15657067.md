Overexpression and enhanced activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
receptor are frequent events in human cancers that correlate with poor 
prognosis. Anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-EGFr affinity chromatography, 
isotope-coded muLC-MS/MS, and immunoblot methods were combined to describe and 
measure signaling networks associated with EGF receptor activation and 
pharmacological inhibition. The squamous carcinoma cell line HN5, which 
overexpresses EGF receptor and displays sustained receptor kinase activation, 
was used as a model system, where pharmacological inhibition of EGF receptor 
kinase by erlotinib markedly reduced auto and substrate phosphorylation, Src 
family phosphorylation at EGFR Y845, while increasing total EGF receptor 
protein. Diverse sets of known and poorly described functional protein classes 
were unequivocally identified by affinity selection, comprising either proteins 
tyrosine phosphorylated or complexed therewith, predominantly through EGF 
receptor and Src family kinases, principally 1) immediate EGF receptor signaling 
complexes (18%); 2) complexes involved in adhesion and cell-cell contacts (34%); 
and 3) receptor internalization and degradation signals. Novel and known 
phosphorylation sites could be located despite the complexity of the peptide 
mixtures. In addition to interactions with multiple signaling adaptors Grb2, 
SHC, SCK, and NSP2, EGF receptors in HN5 cells were shown to form direct or 
indirect physical interactions with additional kinases including ACK1, focal 
adhesion kinase (FAK), Pyk2, Yes, EphA2, and EphB4. Pharmacological inhibition 
of EGF receptor kinase activity by erlotinib resulted in reduced phosphorylation 
of downstream signaling, for example through Cbl/Cbl-B, phospholipase Cgamma 
(PLCgamma), Erk1/2, PI-3 kinase, and STAT3/5. Focal adhesion proteins, FAK, 
Pyk2, paxillin, ARF/GIT1, and plakophillin were down-regulated by transient EGF 
stimulation suggesting a complex balance between growth factor induced kinase 
and phosphatase activities in the control of cell adhesion complexes. The 
functional interactions between IGF-1 receptor, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 
signaling, and EGF receptor were observed, both direct and/or indirectly on 
phospho-Akt, phospho-Erk1/2, and phospho-ribosomal S6.
