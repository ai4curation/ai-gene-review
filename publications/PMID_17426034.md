The Escherichia coli protein SlyD is a member of the FK-506-binding protein 
family of peptidylprolyl isomerases. In addition to its peptidylprolyl isomerase 
domain, SlyD is composed of a molecular chaperone domain and a C-terminal tail 
rich in potential metal-binding residues. SlyD interacts with the 
[NiFe]-hydrogenase accessory protein HypB and contributes to nickel insertion 
during biosynthesis of the hydrogenase metallocenter. This study examines the 
HypB-SlyD complex and its significance in hydrogenase activation. Protein 
variants were prepared to delineate the interface between HypB and SlyD. Complex 
formation requires the HypB linker region located between the high affinity 
N-terminal Ni(II) site and the GTPase domain of the protein. In the case of 
SlyD, the deletion of a short loop in the chaperone domain abrogates the 
interaction with HypB. Mutations in either protein that disrupt complex 
formation in vitro also result in deficient hydrogenase production in vivo, 
indicating that the contact between HypB and SlyD is important for hydrogenase 
maturation. Surprisingly, SlyD stimulates release of nickel from the high 
affinity Ni(II)-binding site of HypB, an activity that is also disrupted by 
mutations that affect complex formation. Furthermore, a SlyD truncation lacking 
the C-terminal metal-binding tail still interacts with HypB but is deficient in 
stimulating metal release and is not functional in vivo. These results suggest 
that SlyD could activate metal release from HypB during metallation of the 
[NiFe] hydrogenase.
