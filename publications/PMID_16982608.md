Interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) is a critical component of the 
IL-10.IL-10R1.IL-10R2 complex which regulates IL-10-mediated immunomodulatory 
responses. The ternary IL-10 signaling complex is assembled in a sequential 
order with the IL-10.IL-10R1 interaction occurring first followed by engagement 
of the IL-10R2 chain. In this study we map the IL-10R2 binding site on IL-10 
using surface plasmon resonance and cell-based assays. Critical IL-10R2 binding 
residues are located in helix A adjacent to the previously identified IL-10R1 
recognition surface. Interestingly, IL-10R2 binding residues located in the 
N-terminal end of helix A exhibit large structural differences between unbound 
cIL-10 and cIL-10.IL-10R1 crystal structures. This suggests IL-10R1-induced 
conformational changes regulate IL-10R2 binding and assembly of the ternary 
IL-10.IL-10R1.IL-10R2 complex. The basic mechanistic features of the assembly 
process are likely shared by six additional class-2 cytokines (viral IL-10s, 
IL-22, IL-26, IL-28A, IL28B, and IL-29) to promote IL-10R2 binding to six 
additional receptor complexes. These studies highlight the importance of 
structure in regulating low affinity protein-protein interactions and IL-10 
signal transduction.
