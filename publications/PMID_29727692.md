Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically and phenotypically 
heterogeneous disorder characterized by destructive respiratory disease and 
laterality abnormalities due to randomized left-right body asymmetry. PCD is 
mostly caused by mutations affecting the core axoneme structure of motile cilia 
that is essential for movement. Genes that cause PCD when mutated include a 
group that encode proteins essential for the assembly of the ciliary dynein 
motors and the active transport process that delivers them from their 
cytoplasmic assembly site into the axoneme. We screened a cohort of affected 
individuals for disease-causing mutations using a targeted next generation 
sequencing panel and identified two unrelated families (three affected children) 
with mutations in the uncharacterized C11orf70 gene (official gene name 
CFAP300). The affected children share a consistent PCD phenotype from early life 
with laterality defects and immotile respiratory cilia displaying combined loss 
of inner and outer dynein arms (IDA+ODA). Phylogenetic analysis shows C11orf70 
is highly conserved, distributed across species similarly to proteins involved 
in the intraflagellar transport (IFT)-dependant assembly of axonemal dyneins. 
Paramecium C11orf70 RNAi knockdown led to combined loss of ciliary IDA+ODA with 
reduced cilia beating and swim velocity. Tagged C11orf70 in Paramecium and 
Chlamydomonas localizes mainly in the cytoplasm with a small amount in the 
ciliary component. IFT139/TTC21B (IFT-A protein) and FLA10 (IFT kinesin) 
depletion experiments show that its transport within cilia is IFT dependent. 
During ciliogenesis, C11orf70 accumulates at the ciliary tips in a similar 
distribution to the IFT-B protein IFT46. In summary, C11orf70 is essential for 
assembly of dynein arms and C11orf70 mutations cause defective cilia motility 
and PCD.
