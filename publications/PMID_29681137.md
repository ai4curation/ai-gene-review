A hierarchy of transcriptional regulators controlling lateral root formation in 
Arabidopsis thaliana has been identified, including the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 
(ARF7)/ARF19-LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN 16 (LBD16)/LBD18 transcriptional 
network; however, their feedback regulation mechanisms are not known. Here we 
show that LBD18 controls ARF activity using the dual mode of a positive feedback 
loop. We showed that ARF7 and ARF19 directly bind AuxRE in the LBD18 promoter. A 
variety of molecular and biochemical experiments demonstrated that LBD18 binds a 
specific DNA motif in the ARF19 promoter to regulate its expression in vivo as 
well as in vitro. LBD18 interacts with ARFs including ARF7 and ARF19 via the 
Phox and Bem1 domain of ARF to enhance the transcriptional activity of ARF7 on 
AuxRE, and competes with auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) repressors for ARF 
binding, overriding the negative feedback loop exerted by Aux/IAA repressors. 
Taken together, these results show that LBD18 and ARFs form a double positive 
feedback loop, and that LBD18 uses the dual mode of a positive feedback loop by 
binding directly to the ARF19 promoter and through the protein-protein 
interactions with ARF7 and ARF19. This novel mechanism of feedback loops may 
constitute a robust feedback mechanism that ensures continued lateral root 
growth in response to auxin in Arabidopsis.
