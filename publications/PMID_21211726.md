Protein quality control (PQC) degradation systems protect the cell from the 
toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins. Because any protein can become 
misfolded, these systems must be able to distinguish abnormal proteins from 
normal ones, yet be capable of recognizing the wide variety of distinctly shaped 
misfolded proteins they are likely to encounter. How individual PQC degradation 
systems accomplish this remains an open question. Here we show that the yeast 
nuclear PQC ubiquitin ligase San1 directly recognizes its misfolded substrates 
via intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal domains. These disordered domains 
are punctuated with small segments of order and high sequence conservation that 
serve as substrate-recognition sites San1 uses to target its different 
substrates. We propose that these substrate-recognition sites, interspersed 
among flexible, disordered regions, provide San1 an inherent plasticity which 
allows it to bind its many, differently shaped misfolded substrates.
