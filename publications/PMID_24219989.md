It is widely accepted that different forms of stress activate a common target, 
p53, yet different outcomes are triggered in a stress-specific manner. For 
example, activation of p53 by genotoxic agents, such as camptothecin (CPT), 
triggers apoptosis, while non-genotoxic activation of p53 by Nutlin-3 (Nut3) 
leads to cell-cycle arrest without significant apoptosis. Such stimulus-specific 
responses are attributed to differential transcriptional activation of various 
promoters by p53. In this study, we demonstrate that CPT, but not Nut3, induces 
miR-203, which downregulates anti-apoptotic bcl-w and promotes cell death in a 
p53-dependent manner. We find that acetylation of K120 in the DNA-binding domain 
of p53 augments its association with the Drosha microprocessor and promotes 
nuclear primary miRNA processing. Knockdown of human orthologue of Males absent 
On the First (hMOF), the acetyltransferase that targets K120 in p53, abolishes 
induction of miR-203 and cell death mediated by CPT. Thus, this study reveals 
that p53 acetylation at K120 plays a critical role in the regulation of the 
Drosha microprocessor and that post-transcriptional regulation of gene 
expression by p53 via miRNAs plays a role in determining stress-specific 
cellular outcomes.

Abstract

It is widely accepted that different forms of stress activate a common target, p53, yet different outcomes are triggered in a stress-specific manner. For example, activation of p53 by genotoxic agents, such as camptothecin (CPT), triggers apoptosis, while non-genotoxic activation of p53 by Nutlin-3 (Nut3) leads to cell-cycle arrest without significant apoptosis. Such stimulus-specific responses are attributed to differential transcriptional activation of various promoters by p53. In this study, we demonstrate that CPT, but not Nut3, induces miR-203, which downregulates anti-apoptotic bcl-w and promotes cell death in a p53-dependent manner. We find that acetylation of K120 in the DNA-binding domain of p53 augments its association with the Drosha microprocessor and promotes nuclear primary miRNA processing. Knockdown of human orthologue of Males absent On the First (hMOF), the acetyltransferase that targets K120 in p53, abolishes induction of miR-203 and cell death mediated by CPT. Thus, this study reveals that p53 acetylation at K120 plays a critical role in the regulation of the Drosha microprocessor and that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by p53 via miRNAs plays a role in determining stress-specific cellular outcomes.

Introduction

Cellular stress responses occur due to sudden environmental changes. Such changes can damage macromolecules, including DNA, mRNA, proteins, and lipids, which need to be replenished ( Kultz, 2005 ). Depending on the stress encountered, cells either re-establish cellular homeostasis or adopt an altered state in the new environment. Stress responses are mediated by multiple mechanisms, including induction of cell death, growth arrest, and activation of specific gene expression programmes through various molecular mechanisms ( Kultz, 2005 ). The tumour suppressor p53 (also known as TP53 in humans and Trp53 in mice) is a confirmed sensor of different types of cellular stress, such as DNA damage, oncogenic activities, erosion of telomeres, and hypoxia. It can modulate gene expression to coordinate various cellular responses to control cell survival, DNA repair, senescence, cell-cycle regulation, or elimination of damaged cells by promoting apoptotic cell death or autophagy. In the unstressed steady state, cellular expression of p53 is kept low by negative regulators, such as human double minute 2 (HDM2 in humans and MDM2 in mice) and HDMX2 (MDMX in mice) ( Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). A small molecule that inhibits the interaction between HDM2 and p53, Nutlin-3 (Nut3), is able to de-repress and activate p53 similarly to genotoxic stimuli, such as topoisomerase inhibitors (doxorubicin (DXR), camptothecin (CPT), and etoposide (ETP)) and the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD). Upon DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and activated. Mutations of p53 directly or indirectly modulate its expression and/or activity and are found in nearly all human cancers, illustrating the central role of p53 as a gatekeeper of the human genome. Mechanistically, p53 acts as a transcription factor, binding DNA in a sequence-specific manner. It is composed of several domains critical for its transcription activity, such as an amino (N)-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), a DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a carboxyl (C)-terminal regulatory domain (CRD). Cellular responses by p53 are mediated by transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes as well as small non-coding microRNA (miRNA) genes.

miRNAs are ∼22-nt regulatory RNAs that negatively modulate the stability and/or translational potential of target mRNAs ( Siomi and Siomi, 2010 ). As miRNA-dependent gene regulation requires neither transcription nor protein synthesis, miRNAs are well positioned to play a significant gene regulatory role in the rapid restoration of homeostasis upon stress responses that have compromised the transcription or translation machineries ( Mendell and Olson, 2012 ). Following DNA damage, p53 induces the primary transcripts of specific miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), such as miR-34a and miR-107. In turn, these miRNAs collectively repress a number of genes, and in this way contribute to promote growth arrest and apoptosis ( Hermeking, 2007 ). In addition, p53 can control the processing of a limited population of pri-miRNAs by associating with RNA helicase p68 (also known as DDX5), a component of the Drosha microprocessor complex. Drosha and its cofactors are essential for the processing of pri-miRNAs to generate precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in the nucleus during miRNA biogenesis ( Suzuki et al, 2009 ). Consequently, we can speculate that deregulation of p53 expression or function due to a mutation of p53 or p53 regulatory proteins can lead to altered expression of miRNAs in addition to changes in transcriptional targets of p53. However, the contribution of p53-modulated miRNAs during DNA damage response is unclear.

Given the essential role of p53 in a wide variety of cellular processes, it is understandable that p53 is constrained by a complex regulatory network that includes positive and negative effector proteins. Many conserved amino-acid residues in p53 undergo different types of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, and neddylation ( Dai and Gu, 2010 ). The impact of these post-translational modifications on the miRNA processing function of p53 has not been addressed previously. Accumulating evidence suggests that the acetylation of lysine (K) residues significantly affects p53 activity during stress responses by modulating the stability and the transcriptional activity of p53 ( Dai and Gu, 2010 ). Currently, 10 acetylated lysine residues (K120, K164, K305, K320, K370, K372, K373, K381, K382, and K386) have been identified in p53 ( Dai and Gu, 2010 ). The acetylation of six of these lysines (K370, K372, K373, K381, K382, and K386), all clustered in the CRD, is mediated by the acetyltransferase p300/CREB-binding protein (p300/CBP) ( Dai and Gu, 2010 ). These six acetylation sites are not only critical to the specificity of the DNA binding and transcriptional activation ability of p53, but also contribute to the stabilization and subsequent elevation of total p53 levels, as acetylation of these lysine residues inhibits ubiquitination by HDM2/HDMX and subsequent degradation of p53 ( Dai and Gu, 2010 ). However, mutations in lysines in the CRD have not been found in human cancers (according to the UMD_TP53 Mutation database at http://p53.free.fr/ ). Recently, two additional acetylation sites (K120 and K164) were identified in the DBD ( Sykes et al, 2006 ; Tang et al, 2006 ). Although rare, K120R and K164R mutations can be found in tumours and cancer cell lines (from the UMD_TP53 Mutation database). Acetylation of K120 is mediated by the human orthologue of Males absent On the First (hMOF) and Tat-Interactive Protein of 60 kDa (Tip60), and K164 is acetylated by CBP/p300 similarly to the C-terminal acetylation sites ( Dai and Gu, 2010 ). An acetylation-defective mutation at K120 (K120R) abrogates p53-mediated apoptosis, but not growth arrest or senescence, suggesting that K120 acetylation can determine the type of cellular outcome mediated by p53 ( Sykes et al, 2006 ; Tang et al, 2006 ; Li et al, 2012 ). However, the molecular mechanism by which acetyl-K120 p53 triggers a specific outcome is not fully understood.

In this study, we demonstrate that DNA damaging agents activate both the transcriptional activity and the miRNA processing activity of p53, ultimately resulting in cell death. On the other hand, Nut3 inactivates HDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which results in p53 degradation and induces p53-dependent transcription, but shows little effect on the miRNA processing activity of p53. Likewise, Nut3 does not cause cell death, suggesting that miRNA processing by p53 is required for the induction of apoptosis. Acetylation of K120, induced by DNA damaging agents, plays a critical role in the stimulation of miRNA processing by p53 through an enhanced association with p68 and Drosha and cropping of pri-miRNA. Our study suggests that CPT-mediated cell death is due to the induction of miR-203, which downregulates pro-survival Bcl-w (BCL2L2) and mediates the apoptotic response. Thus, the acetylation of the K120 in p53 is critical for the post-transcriptional regulation of miRNAs and for determining the specificity of the p53-dependent cellular response.

Discussion

The mechanism of stimulus-specific regulation of p53, in particular the different consequences mediated by genotoxic stimuli and the HDM2 inhibitor, has been investigated previously ( Donner et al, 2007 ). One proposed mechanism for the varying responses is the differential accessibility of the genomic binding sites of p53, which in turn controls different subsets of downstream targets in distinct cellular environments. However, genome-wide analysis of p53 occupancy suggests that the regulation of specific subsets of p53 targets cannot be attributed to the association of p53 to specific target genes, as the pattern of p53 occupancy does not change dramatically between different stimuli, despite different biological outcomes ( Wei et al, 2006 ). Our study shows that the p53-dependent modulation of miRNA biogenesis is a defining mechanism for the specificity of DNA damaging agent-dependent cell death as a consequence of K120 acetylation.

It has been shown that p53 modulates miRNA biogenesis through associating with p68 to enable processing of pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA by Drosha, similarly to the function of TGFβ signal transducers, the Smad proteins. In response to a DNA damage stimulus, the level of a small subset of miRNAs is post-transcriptionally upregulated ( Suzuki et al, 2009 ). In addition to this miRNA processing regulation, p53 also transcriptionally regulates the level of some miRNAs, such as miR-34a, miR-107, miR-125b, miR-149*, miR-146, miR-192, miR-215, and miR-1246. Conversely, p53 itself is regulated by a miRNA, miR-125b ( Le et al, 2009 ), which decreases upon DNA damage ( Junttila and Evan, 2009 ). Therefore, during DNA damage, a decrease in the miRNA-dependent repression of p53 is coupled with p53 activation, which results in the upregulation of protein-coding genes and miRNAs, as well as the downregulation of miRNA targets to promote cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. This post-transcriptional mechanism of miRNA regulation might be critical and relevant to a rapid modulation of the expression of a large number of genes under various stress stimuli that can compromise transcription activities.

Interestingly, p53 mutants frequently identified in cancers, such as C135Y, R175H, and R273H, fail to interact with the Drosha complex and to facilitate miRNA processing ( Suzuki et al, 2009 ), suggesting that the tumorigenesis caused by these p53 mutants might be, in part, due to deregulation of miRNA biogenesis. We propose that the K120R mutant found in tumours may also contribute to tumorigenesis and resistance to chemotherapy through deregulation of miRNA biosynthesis.

Although multiple lysine residues in p53 are acetylated, the observation that only K120 and K164 mutations can be found in tumours and tumour-derived cell lines supports the physiological significance of the modification of these two amino acids. It has been reported that acetyl-K120 is essential for the induction of apoptosis but dispensable for cell-cycle arrest or senescence ( Sykes et al, 2006 ; Tang et al, 2006 ; Li et al, 2012 ). On the basis of the observation that the K120R mutant can activate p21 but not the pro-apoptotic gene Puma , it has been suggested that K120 acetylation conveys the transactivation of specific gene promoters, thus prompting specific cellular outcomes ( Sykes et al, 2006 ; Tang et al, 2006 ; Li et al, 2012 ). Consistently, the crystal structure of the K120-acetylated form of the p53 DBD indicates that acetyl-K120 does not alter the overall structure of the DBD but instead increases DBD binding to a specific DNA sequence ( Arbely et al, 2011 ). In addition to affecting DNA binding, our study reveals that K120 acetylation of p53 mediates the stable association of p53 with the Drosha complex, and thus stimulates miRNA processing. Other transcription factors, such as the Smad proteins and oestrogen receptor (ER) α, also interact with the Drosha complex via p68 and modulate the processing activity of Drosha ( Davis-Dusenbery and Hata, 2010 ). The N-terminus Mad-homology 1 (MH1) domain of Smads, already known as a sequence-specific DBD, directly interacts with a double-stranded region of several pri-miRNAs in a sequence-dependent manner ( Davis et al, 2010 ). Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that K120 acetylation may contribute to p53 binding affinity and specificity not only to DNA, but also to a double-stranded region of pri-miRNAs.

Downregulation of miR-203 has been reported in wide a range of malignancies, including cancers of the bladder, breast and prostate, gastric and colorectal cancers, hepatocarcinomas, melanomas and lymphomas, suggesting that miR-203 functions as a tumour suppressor ( Bueno et al, 2008 ; Lena et al, 2008 ; Furuta et al, 2010 ; Craig et al, 2011 ; Li et al, 2011 ; Luzna et al, 2011 ; Saini et al, 2011 ; Chen et al, 2012 ; Xu et al, 2012 ). miR-203 levels are also modulated by Epstein-Bar virus and human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16) infection ( Yu et al, 2012 ). Interestingly, the HPV16 oncoproteins E6 and E7 modulate miR-203 expression in human foreskin keratinocyte (HFK) in a p53-dependent manner; in fact, E6/E7 cannot induce miR-203 in HFK in which p53 has been reduced by short-hairpin RNAs ( McKenna et al, 2010 ). This finding is consistent with our observation that p53-mediated processing is critical for the induction of miR-203.

Downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-w by miR-203 is necessary for cell death upon CPT treatment, as an expression construct of Bcl-w lacking the MRE blocked CPT-mediated apoptosis. Gene targeting of Bcl-w in mouse indicates that Bcl-w has an essential function in spermatogenesis and survival of damaged epithelial cells in the gut, but it has a dispensable role in the physiological cell death process of other tissues ( Pritchard et al, 2000 ; Yan et al, 2000 ). In addition to regulating Bcl-w expression, p53 is known to transcriptionally activate the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Puma ( Dai and Gu, 2010 ). Previous studies demonstrate that the p53-dependent induction of Bax and Puma upon stress is greatly decreased in cells expressing the K120R mutant, while activation of HDM2 and p21 is unaltered compared to WT p53-expressing cells, suggesting that K120 acetylation of p53 promotes preferential binding and transcriptional activation of the promoters of these pro-apoptotic genes ( Sykes et al, 2006 ; Tang et al, 2006 ). Thus, we speculate that induction of K120 acetylation by CPT promotes cell death through the combined effects of (i) downregulation of pro-survival Bcl-w by miR-203 and (ii) induction of pro-apoptotic Bax/Puma proteins.
