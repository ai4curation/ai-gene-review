The cullin 4-DNA-damage-binding protein 1 (CUL4-DDB1) ubiquitin ligase machinery 
regulates diverse cellular functions and can be subverted by pathogenic viruses. 
Here we report the crystal structure of DDB1 in complex with a central fragment 
of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), whose DDB1-binding activity is important 
for viral infection. The structure reveals that HBx binds DDB1 through an 
alpha-helical motif, which is also found in the unrelated paramyxovirus SV5-V 
protein despite their sequence divergence. Our structure-based functional 
analysis suggests that, like SV5-V, HBx captures DDB1 to redirect the ubiquitin 
ligase activity of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ligase. We also identify the alpha-helical 
motif shared by these viral proteins in the cellular substrate-recruiting 
subunits of the E3 complex, the DDB1-CUL4-associated factors (DCAFs) that are 
functionally mimicked by the viral hijackers. Together, our studies reveal a 
common yet promiscuous structural element that is important for the assembly of 
cellular and virally hijacked CUL4-DDB1 E3 complexes.
