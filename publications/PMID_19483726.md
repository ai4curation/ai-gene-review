The loss of expression of the transcription factor GATA3 in breast tumors has 
been linked to aggressive tumor development and poor patient survival. In the 
present work, we address potential roles for GATA3 in breast tumor lung 
metastasis and progression. Using an aggressive breast cancer cell line, which 
metastasizes specifically to the lung, we show that GATA3 expression results in 
reduced tumor outgrowth in the mammary fat pad and lower lung metastatic burden 
in nude mice. Specifically, GATA3 expression inhibits breast cancer cell 
expansion inside the lung parenchyma. This phenotype correlates with the ability 
of GATA3 to negatively regulate the expression of several genes that promote 
breast cancer lung metastasis (ID1/-3, KRTHB1, LY6E and RARRES3). Conversely, 
the expression of genes encoding known inhibitors of lung metastasis (DLC1 
(deleted in liver cancer 1) and PAEP (progestagen-associated endometrial 
protein)) is upregulated by GATA3. These data correlate with microarray data 
from human breast cancer patients, showing a strong correlation between high 
GATA3 expression and absence of metastases specifically to the lungs. We 
conclude that GATA3 inhibits primary breast tumor outgrowth and reduces lung 
metastatic burden by regulating key genes involved in metastatic breast tumor 
progression.
