Activation of the innate immune system results in a rapid microbicidal response 
against microorganisms, which needs to be fine-tuned because uncontrolled immune 
responses can lead to infection and cancer, as well as conditions such as Crohn 
disease, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer disease. Here we report that excessive 
activity of the conserved FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 enhances 
susceptibility to bacterial infections in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that 
increased temperature activates not only DAF-16 nuclear import but also a 
control mechanism involved in DAF-16 nuclear export. The nuclear export of 
DAF-16 requires heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 and Hsp70/HSP-1. 
Furthermore, we show that increased expression of the water channel Aquoporin-1 
is responsible for the deleterious consequences of excessive DAF-16-mediated 
immune response. These studies reveal a stress-inducible mechanism involved in 
the regulation of DAF-16 and indicate that uncontrolled DAF-16 activity and 
water homeostasis are a cause of the deleterious effects of excessive immune 
responses.
