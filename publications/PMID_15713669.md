After integration into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, ER-resident 
membrane proteins must be segregated from proteins that are exported to post-ER 
compartments. Here we analyze how human Gaa1 and PIG-T, two of the five subunits 
of the ER-localized glycosylphosphatidylinositol transamidase complex, are 
retained in the ER. Neither protein contains a known ER localization signal. 
Gaa1 is a polytopic membrane glycoprotein with a cytoplasmic N terminus and a 
large luminal loop between its first two transmembrane spans; PIG-T is a type I 
membrane glycoprotein. To simplify our analyses, we studied Gaa1 and PIG-T 
constructs that could not interact with other subunits of the transamidase. We 
now show that Gaa1(282), a truncated protein consisting of the first TM domain 
and luminal loop of Gaa1, is correctly oriented, N-glycosylated, and 
ER-localized. Removal of a potential ER localization signal in the form of a 
triple arginine cluster near the N terminus of Gaa1 or Gaa1(282) had no effect 
on ER localization. Fusion proteins consisting of different elements of 
Gaa1(282) appended to alpha2,6-sialyltransferase or transferrin receptor could 
exit the ER, indicating that Gaa1(282), and by implication Gaa1, does not 
contain any dominant ER-sorting determinants. The data suggest that Gaa1 is 
passively retained in the ER by a signalless mechanism. In contrast, similar 
analyses of PIG-T revealed that it is ER-localized because of information in its 
transmembrane span; fusion of the PIG-T transmembrane span to Tac antigen, a 
plasma membrane-localized protein, caused the fusion protein to remain in the 
ER. These data are discussed in the context of models that have been proposed to 
account for retention of ER membrane proteins.
