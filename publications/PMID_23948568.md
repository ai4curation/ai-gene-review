Some properties of G84R and L99M mutants of HspB1 associated with peripheral 
distal neuropathies were investigated. Homooligomers formed by these mutants are 
larger than those of the wild type HspB1. Large oligomers of G84R and L99M 
mutants have compromised stability and tend to dissociate at low protein 
concentration. G84R and L99M mutations promote phosphorylation-dependent 
dissociation of HspB1 oligomers without affecting kinetics of HspB1 
phosphorylation by MAPKAP2 kinase. Both mutants weakly interact with HspB6 
forming small heterooligomers and being unable to form large heterooligomers 
characteristic for the wild type HspB1. G84R and L99M mutants possess lower 
chaperone-like activity than the wild type HspB1 with several model substrates. 
We suggest that G84R mutation affects mobility and accessibility of the 
N-terminal domain thus modifying interdimer contacts in HspB1 oligomers. The 
L99M mutation is located within the hydrophobic core of the α-crystallin domain 
close to the key R140 residue, and could affect the dimer stability.
