InsP(3) binding to type-1, but not type-3, InsP(3) receptors is inhibited by 
calmodulin in a Ca(2+)-independent fashion [Cardy and Taylor (1998) Biochem. J. 
334, 447-455], and Ca(2+) mobilization by type-1 InsP(3) receptors of cerebellum 
is inhibited by calmodulin [Patel, Morris, Adkins, O'Beirne and Taylor (1997) 
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 11627-11632]. Using cell types expressing 
predominantly type-1, -2 or -3 InsP(3) receptors, we show that InsP(3)-evoked 
Ca(2+) mobilization from each is similarly inhibited by calmodulin. In SH-SY5Y 
cells, which express largely type-1 receptors, calmodulin (IC(50) approximately 
15 microM) inhibited InsP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) release only in the presence of 
Ca(2+). The inhibition was unaffected by calcineurin inhibitors. The effect of 
calmodulin did not result from enhanced metabolism of InsP(3) because calmodulin 
also decreased the sensitivity of the Ca(2+) stores to adenophostin A, a 
non-metabolizable InsP(3)-receptor agonist. Protein kinase A-catalysed 
phosphorylation of type-1 InsP(3) receptors was unaffected by Ca(2+)-calmodulin. 
Using a scintillation proximity assay to measure (125)I-calmodulin binding to 
glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins, we identified two regions of the 
type-1 InsP(3) receptor (cyt1, residues -6 to 159; and cyt11, residues 
1499-1649) that bound (125)I-calmodulin. The higher-affinity site (cyt11) was 
also photoaffinity labelled with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate 
(HSAB)-calmodulin. We speculate that Ca(2+)-independent binding of calmodulin to 
a site within the first 159 residues of the type-1 InsP(3) receptor inhibits 
InsP(3) binding and may thereby regulate the kinetics of Ca(2+) release. 
Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of Ca(2+) release by calmodulin is mediated by a 
different site: it may reside on an accessory protein that associates with all 
three receptor subtypes, or Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding to a site lying between 
residues 1499 and 1649 of the type-1 receptor may inhibit Ca(2+) release from 
any tetrameric receptor that includes a type-1 subunit.
