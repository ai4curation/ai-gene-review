Abstract

In the stem-cell niche, the extracellular matrix (ECM) serves as a structural support that additionally provides stem cells with signals that contribute to the regulation of stem-cell function, via reciprocal interactions between cells and components of the ECM. Recently, cell-derived ECMs have emerged as in vitro cell culture substrates to better recapitulate the native stem-cell microenvironment outside the body. Significant changes in cell number, morphology and function have been observed when mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were cultured on ECM substrates as compared to standard tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS). As select ECM components are known to regulate specific stem-cell functions, a robust characterization of cell-derived ECM proteomic composition is critical to better comprehend the role of the ECM in directing cellular processes. Here, we characterized and compared the protein composition of ECM produced in vitro by bone marrow-derived MSC, adipose-derived MSC and neonatal fibroblasts from different donors, employing quantitative proteomic methods. Each cell-derived ECM displayed a specific and unique matrisome signature, yet they all shared a common set of proteins. We evaluated the biological response of cells cultured on the different matrices and compared them to cells on standard TCPS. The matrices lead to differential survival and gene-expression profiles among the cell types and as compared to TCPS, indicating that the cell-derived ECMs influence each cell type in a different manner. This general approach to understanding the protein composition of different tissue-specific and cell-derived ECM will inform the rational design of defined systems and biomaterials that recapitulate critical ECM signals for stem-cell culture and tissue engineering.

1. Introduction

In the body, cells are surrounded by a complex three-dimensional microenvironment, termed the extracellular matrix (ECM), which provides cells with many chemical and biophysical signals required for cell function. Both specific components and biophysical properties of the ECM coordinate intracellular signaling and downstream biological responses through bidirectional interactions with the cells, regulating numerous physiological processes such as cell survival, migration, proliferation and differentiation [ 1 - 3 ]. In the stem-cell niche, cell-matrix interactions influence and modulate stem-cell self-renewal and differentiation. That is, the ECM operates in vivo not only as a cellular support but also directs cell fate through coordinated physical and biochemical cues [ 4 - 6 ].

During mammalian stem-cell culture, stem cells are removed from their native microenvironment ( e.g. , the bone-marrow niche for bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), adipose tissue for adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells) and need to adapt to a relatively foreign environment, that is, tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS), which is fully synthetic and does not present standard ECM signals. Evidence in the literature has shown that TCPS biases MSC function resulting in lower proliferation rates and a loss of stemness over sequential passages [ 7 - 9 ]. Therefore, ECM-based cell-culture substrates have been developed in an attempt to better recapitulate in vitro the native cellular microenvironment [ 10 - 14 ]. MSC are able to deposit an ECM on TCPS over the course of two weeks and this ECM can be used, after decellularization, as a culture substrate for a new batch of MSC. It has been reported that the culture of MSC on in vitro cell-derived ECM induces significant biological changes in MSC function compared to standard culture conditions [ 10 , 11 , 15 , 16 ]. As ECM components are key players in the regulation of cellular processes, it is critical to gain a better knowledge of ECM composition to decipher how ECM components regulate cell function. In addition, a comprehensive understanding of cell-matrix interactions will provide further insight into the rational design of ECM-mimicking substrates for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [ 17 , 18 ].

Despite several reports on the development of cell-derived ECMs for MSC culture, detailed data about their molecular composition is limited. Traditional biochemical analysis of ECM is challenging on account of the insolubility and complexity of ECM components [ 19 ]. To address these issues, we have applied a proteomic approach initially described for the analysis of tumoral ECM [ 20 ]. The method consists of a sequential digestion of the ECM proteins followed by tandem mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses, yielding a detailed inventory of the ECM and ECM-associated proteins (termed the “matrisome”). By coupling this method to label-based quantitative proteomics, we were able to characterize and compare the molecular composition of cell-derived ECM produced by different cell types in vitro , specifically bone-marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (Bm MSC), adipose-derived MSC (Ad MSC) and human neonatal dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), as well as to evaluate the ECM produced by cells from different donors. Proliferation and mRNA transcriptomic profiling of the cells cultured on the different ECM were performed and compared to standard culture conditions.

We observe that, in addition to a set of common proteins, each cell-derived ECM contains cell-type-specific proteins. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals a specific matrisome signature for each type of ECM. The matrices lead to differential cell growth and gene expression among the cells as compared to TCPS culture, indicating that the ECM signatures influence each cell type in a differential fashion.

4. Discussion

In the body, stem cells are in constant and intimate contact with the ECM. This matrix serves not only as a structural support, but as a reservoir of many biochemical and mechanical signals that are transduced via cell surface receptor-protein interactions and influence cell signaling pathways and dictate cell functions [ 1 ]. ECM components are at the center of this complex interplay and have a vital role in regulating physiological processes. During standard cell culture, stem cells are isolated from their native microenvironment ( i.e. , the stem-cell niche), and need to adapt to a polymeric surface where ECM signals are limited to the serum proteins in the medium or adsorbed proteins on the plastic surface. This environment has been shown to affect cell biology; MSC cultured on ECM substrates compared to those on TCPS displayed different biologic features that impact cell morphology, motility and proliferation as well as, in other reports, differentiation [ 10 , 11 ]. In the context of stem cell biology, it is critical to decipher how individual ECM components regulate specific stem cell functions to better comprehend the natural role of the ECM. Understanding cellular processes requires a robust characterization of the ECM’s molecular composition. In addition, this understanding will provide further insight for the rational design of ECM mimicking biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [ 18 , 41 , 42 ].

By employing a proteomic approach, we were able to provide a comprehensive characterization of the molecular composition of ECM produced in vitro by bone marrow-derived MSC (Bm ECM), adipose-derived MSC (Ad ECM) and human neonatal dermal fibroblasts (Der ECM). The analysis of Bm ECM of MSC from 6 different donors revealed a complex yet consistent protein composition. Specifically, the composition of these cell-derived ECMs (approximately 80 unique ECM and ECM-associated proteins) is rather complex as compared to protein-based substrates, which often comprise a surface coating of one or two proteins, and are occasionally employed for stem cell culture as an alternative to TCPS. The variance of protein expression across the Bm ECM formed by cells from the 6 different donors was relatively low (log 2 fold change range of −0.6 to 0.65) indicative of a consistent matrix formed by Bm MSC from different donors. However, when the proteomic composition of Bm ECM was compared to Ad ECM and Der ECM, a distinct signature was observed for each of the three cell-derived matrices. Despite the sensitivity and precision of TMT labeling techniques, underestimation of protein abundance differences by a factor of 20 to 30% can occur due to ratio compression phenomena [ 43 , 44 ] and real effect sizes might be larger than what was measured. High-resolution techniques as well as correction algorithms have been developed to minimize the ratio compression and help detect subtle variations between samples.

The major proportion of Bm ECM proteins belongs to the core matrisome that includes collagens, glycoproteins and proteoglycans. A large variety of collagens were detected in Bm ECM, of which the fibrillar family was the most abundant ( i.e. , collagens I, II, III, V and XI) that are known to contribute to the molecular architecture and mechanical properties of many tissues [ 45 - 47 ]. In addition, Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices (FACIT) collagens that associate to the surface of fibrillar collagens were identified (collagens XII and XIV that associate with fibrillar collagen I to facilitate fibril thickening), along with network-forming collagens (collagen IV) and beaded-filament forming collagens (collagen VI) [ 45 ]. The presence of collagens in the ECM was associated with proteinases that specifically degrade collagens (MMP-2 that lyses collagens I, IV, V) as well as collagen cross-linkers such as the LOX-like family members [ 48 ]. While Bm ECM and Ad ECM present a similar collagen composition, the expression level of collagens in Der ECM was overall lower. Dermal tissues are elastic, while collagens confer stiffness and strength to tissues, as the collagen fibers have a high capacity for energy storage but minimal elasticity as a consequence of their semi-crystalline packing [ 45 , 49 , 50 ]. In addition, overall glycoprotein levels were found to be increased in Der ECM compared to Ad ECM and Bm ECM, although differences in the levels of specific glycoproteins ( e.g. , fibulin-2) were observed between both MSC-derived ECMs. These glycoproteins are implicated in the ECM structural organization and have somewhat restricted tissue distribution [ 51 ]. For example, a major function of fibulin-2 is the formation of large proteoglycan networks and its overexpression in Ad ECM and Der ECM might be responsible for different ECM macromolecular architectures, compared to Bm ECM. Similarly, fibrillins form microfibrils that provide tissue with long-range extensibility and associate with elastic fibers [ 52 , 53 ]. The different ratios of core matrisome proteins lead to different supramolecular assemblies that might ultimately provide the matrices with different mechanical properties [ 49 , 50 , 54 ].

In addition to the core matrisome ECM proteins, numerous other proteins that contribute to ECM function and dynamics were detected. Regulators maintain a balance between ECM stability and dynamic remodeling by degrading proteins ( e.g. , cathepsin B, Adamalysin ADAMTS that degrade fibronectin and collagen IV, or sulfatase SULF1 that cleaves proteoglycans and removes GAG chains) or by modifying ECM topography through protein crosslinking ( e.g. , TGM2 and LOX). ECM remodeling promotes cell movement and migration, and the released proteolytic fragments may also play a role in cell signaling [ 32 ]. These proteases are tightly regulated at the transcriptome level, and some of them are secreted as pro-enzymes that require extracellular activation. This is the case for the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 that needs to be activated by other proteinases to be functional, such as the transmembrane type MMP-14, also identified in Bm ECM [ 33 ]. Proteinases can be inactivated by protease inhibitors such as TIMP3 and A2M found in Bm ECM. While several proteases were identified in Bm ECM, Ad ECM and Der ECM, it is not clear from these data what their relative activity is and on-going work is characterizing their role in ECM remodeling during stem cell culture.

Interestingly, ECM impacts different cells in different ways. Human neonatal dermal fibroblasts survive as well on TCPS as on cell-derived ECM, and minimal changes at the RNA levels were observed, suggesting that this cell type is negligibly impacted by the substrate over 72 h. In contrast, MSC number was significantly increased on ECM compared to TCPS as well as to a fibronectin-coated substrate (unpublished data), indicating that a synergy of multiple proteins is advantageous. Interestingly, the differences among the compositions of ECMs from different tissue types do not seem to affect MSC survival, as the cell number was similarly increased on each ECM. This suggests that MSC survival depends more on the common core of proteins than on the unique proteins expressed in each of the cell-derived ECM. However, the different ECMs might affect other cell functions that were not investigated in this study. Future work will focus on the secretome, another major regulator of MSC fate and paracrine effects.

Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the culture of MSC on TCPS induces an up-regulation of genes that code for ECM and ECM-associated proteins as well as proteins implicated in cell adhesion as compared to MSC on cell-derived ECM. On the other hand, NHDF seem less affected by the type of substrate they are seeded on. One hypothesis is that MSC on TCPS are more sensitive to certain ECM signals than other cell types, such as NHDF. In addition, MSC population was increased on ECM and the cells over-express several genes implicated in cell cycle regulation and migration. Interactions with ECM and its components impact MSC function compared to TCPS where MSC receive restricted molecular cues. Perhaps, the lack of pertinent ECM signals at early time points during TCPS culture or the relative metabolic cost of construction of a new ECM is responsible for the lower number of MSC on TCPS as compared to cell-derived ECM.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, we characterized the molecular composition of ECM deposited in vitro by bone marrow-derived MSC as well as adipose-derived MSC and neonatal dermal fibroblasts. While the three matrices share a set of common proteins, each ECM displayed distinct features specific to the tissue of origin that might be related to specialized tissue functions. MSC derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue both showed increased cell number on the cell-derived ECMs versus standard TCPS; however, the unique ECM signatures had a minimal impact on MSC growth as cell number was similarly increased across the different cell-derived ECMs. In addition, significant changes in MSC transcriptome profiles were observed between both culture conditions; MSC on TCPS over-expressed genes coding for matrisome proteins and MSC on cell-derived ECM over-expressed genes implicated in cell cycle regulation and migration. On the other hand, the type of substrate had a limited effect on NHDF behavior. These data corroborate the importance of ECM signals for the in vitro culture of MSC. Utilizing these methods to further characterize ECM protein composition as well as understanding ECM-stem cell interactions can provide insight into stem cell biology and inform the design of next-generation ECM-mimicking substrates for in vitro stem cell culture.
