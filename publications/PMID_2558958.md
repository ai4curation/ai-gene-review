The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two ras homologues, RAS1 and RAS2, 
whose products have been shown to modulate the activity of adenylate cyclase 
encoded by the CYR1 gene. To isolate temperature-sensitive mutations in the RAS2 
gene, we constructed a plasmid carrying a RAS2 gene whose expression is under 
the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. A ras1 strain transformed 
with this plasmid was subjected to ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and 
nystatin enrichment. Screening of approximately 13,000 mutagenized colonies for 
galactose-dependent growth at a high temperature (37 degrees) yielded six 
temperature-sensitive ras2 (ras2ts) mutations and one temperature-sensitive cyr1 
(cyr1ts) mutation that can be suppressed by overexpression or increased dosage 
of RAS2. Some ras2ts mutations were shown to be suppressed by an extra copy of 
CYR1. Therefore increased dosage of either RAS2 or CYR1 can suppress the 
temperature sensitivity caused by a mutation in the other. ras1 ras2ts and ras1 
cyr1ts mutants arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle at the restrictive 
temperature, and showed pleiotropic phenotypes to varying degrees even at a 
temperature permissive for growth (25 degrees), including slow growth, 
sporulation on rich media, increased accumulation of glycogen, impaired growth 
on nonfermentable carbon sources, heat-shock resistance, impaired growth on low 
concentrations of glucose, and lithium sensitivity. Of these, impaired growth on 
low concentrations of glucose and sensitivity to lithium are new phenotypes, 
which have not been reported for mutants defective in the cAMP pathway.
