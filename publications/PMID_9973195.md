Apoptosis is regulated by interaction of viral and cellular BCL-2 family 
antiapoptotic proteins with various pro-apoptotic proteins, several of which are 
also members of the BCL-2 family. Cellular protein BNIP3 is a BCL-2 family 
proapoptotic protein that interacts with viral antiapoptosis proteins such as 
adenoviruses E1B-19K and EBV-BHRF1 and cellular antiapoptosis proteins such as 
BCL-2 and BCL-xL. Database searches indicate that the human genome encodes an 
open reading frame for a protein, BNIP3alpha, that shares substantial homology 
with BNIP3. The BNIP3alpha open reading frame encodes a protein of 219 amino 
acids that contains a conserved BH3 domain and a COOH-terminal trans-membrane 
domain, characteristic of several BCL-2 family proapoptotic proteins. BNIP3alpha 
interacts with viral antiapoptosis protein E1B-19K and cellular antiapoptosis 
proteins BCL-2 and BCL-xL. Overexpression of BNIP3alpha in transfected cells 
results in apoptosis and suppresses the antiapoptosis activity of E1B-19K and 
BCL-xL. Like BNIP3, BNIP3alpha seems to be predominantly localized in 
mitochondria. These results suggest that BNIP3alpha is a structural and 
functional homologue of BNIP3. BNIP3 and BNIP3alpha seem to be the first 
examples of homologues among the various human proapoptotic proteins. Northern 
blot analysis reveals that BNIP3alpha is expressed ubiquitously in most human 
tissues. In contrast, BNIP3 is expressed well in several human tissues and less 
abundantly in certain tissues such as placenta and lung. These results suggest 
that although BNIP3 and BNIP3alpha may promote apoptosis simultaneously in most 
human tissues, BNIP3alpha may play a more universal role.
