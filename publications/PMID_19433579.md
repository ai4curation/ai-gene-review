Hemoglobin (Hb) uniquely associates with proinflammatory HDL in atherogenic mice 
and coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. In this paper, we report that Hb and 
its scavenger proteins, haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx) are significantly 
increased in apoA-1-containing particles of HDL both in mouse models of 
hyperlipidemia and in CHD patients, when compared with wild type mice and 
healthy donors, respectively. We further demonstrate that the association of Hb, 
Hp, and Hx proteins with HDL positively correlates with inflammatory properties 
of HDL and systemic inflammation in CHD patients. Interestingly, HDL from 
Hp(-/-) mice under atherogenic conditions does not accumulate Hb and is 
anti-inflammatory, suggesting that (i) Hp is required for the association of Hb 
with HDL and (ii) Hb x Hp complexes regulate the inflammatory properties of HDL. 
Moreover, treatment of apoE(-/-) mice with an apoA-1 mimetic peptide resulted in 
significant dissociation of Hb x Hp complexes from HDL and improvement of HDL 
inflammatory properties. Our data strongly suggest that HDL can become 
proinflammatory via the Hb x Hp pathway in mice and humans, and dissociation of 
Hb x Hp x Hx complexes from apoA-1-containing particles of HDL may be a novel 
target for the treatment of CHD.

Abstract

Hemoglobin (Hb) uniquely associates with proinflammatory HDL in atherogenic mice and coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. In this paper, we report that Hb and its scavenger proteins, haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx) are significantly increased in apoA-1-containing particles of HDL both in mouse models of hyperlipidemia and in CHD patients, when compared with wild type mice and healthy donors, respectively. We further demonstrate that the association of Hb, Hp, and Hx proteins with HDL positively correlates with inflammatory properties of HDL and systemic inflammation in CHD patients. Interestingly, HDL from Hp −/− mice under atherogenic conditions does not accumulate Hb and is anti-inflammatory, suggesting that (i) Hp is required for the association of Hb with HDL and (ii) Hb·Hp complexes regulate the inflammatory properties of HDL. Moreover, treatment of apoE −/− mice with an apoA-1 mimetic peptide resulted in significant dissociation of Hb·Hp complexes from HDL and improvement of HDL inflammatory properties. Our data strongly suggest that HDL can become proinflammatory via the Hb·Hp pathway in mice and humans, and dissociation of Hb·Hp·Hx complexes from apoA-1-containing particles of HDL may be a novel target for the treatment of CHD.

DISCUSSION

Oxidation of LDL is a major factor in human atherosclerosis ( 22 , 23 ). Entrapment and oxidation of LDL in the subendothelial space and the subsequent interactions between endothelial cells and monocytes is a key process in the initiation of atherosclerotic lesion development ( 24 , 25 ). The inverse relationship between HDL and the risk of atherosclerosis is well established. Although there does not appear to be a single explanation for the antiatherogenic role of HDL, it has become clear that the functional status of HDL, which is largely dependent on its protein components, is probably an important determinant of CHD ( 9 ). PON1, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase, proteinase (elastase-like), phospholipase D, albumin, apoJ, and apoA-1 are proteins in HDL with antiatherogenic properties capable of preventing LDL oxidation. HDL was shown to inhibit the mild oxidation of LDL and consequently inhibit the production of the potent monocyte chemoattractant MCP-1 by human artery wall cells ( 26 ).

Van Lenten et al. ( 6 ) were the first to demonstrate that HDL could exist as an anti-inflammatory molecule or a proinflammatory molecule, depending on the context and environment. Van Lenten et al. ( 6 ) showed that the acute phase reaction in rabbits and humans converts HDL from anti-inflammatory to proinflammatory ( i.e. HDL loses its ability to inhibit LDL-induced MCP-1 in cultures of human artery wall cells). Indeed, in its proinflammatory state, HDL actually promotes this LDL-induced inflammatory response. The authors concluded that under basal conditions, HDL serves an anti-inflammatory role, but during the acute phase reaction there is loss of anti-oxidant enzyme activities and displacement and/or exchange of proteins associated with HDL resulting in a proinflammatory HDL. Subsequently, it was shown that an atherogenic diet in mice that are genetically susceptible to atherosclerosis (but not in mice genetically resistant to atherosclerosis) converts HDL from anti-inflammatory to proinflammatory ( 27 ). Several studies have shown the presence and nature of proinflammatory HDL in animal models ( 11 , 28 ) of atherosclerosis, suggesting that the anti- or proinflammatory nature of HDL function is a more sensitive indicator of the presence or absence of atherosclerosis than HDL cholesterol levels. Knowledge of protein profiles that distinguish proinflammatory HDL from normal/anti-inflammatory HDL will probably allow the development of novel biomarkers for the early detection of atherosclerosis and provide new strategies for therapeutic interventions ( 5 , 29 ). We have recently utilized protein-profiling methods and identified Hb as a major protein associated with proinflammatory HDL ( 12 ). We have demonstrated that accumulation of Hb in HDL plays a role in the proinflammatory properties of HDL in atherogenic mice and in CHD patients. In this paper, we set out to determine the mechanisms behind the association of Hb with proinflammatory HDL.

Humans metabolize more than 6 g of Hb everyday ( 30 ). Although under conditions of hemolysis, more than one-tenth of Hb can be released into the plasma compartment ( 30 ), the presence of scavenger proteins (Hp and Hx) helps to protect humans from the highly toxic effects of free Hb ( 31 , 32 ). In humans and in mice, there is always a small amount of Hb outside of RBC. The non-RBC Hb was found associated with HDL in mouse models of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis but not in normal mice, where it was almost exclusively found in the non-lipoprotein fractions ( 12 ). In the current studies, we found that the total Hb content of serum was significantly higher in CHD patients compared with healthy subjects ( Table 2 ). The samples were devoid of any noticeable hemolysis that could potentially account for higher Hb levels. Moreover, we also found that total Hp and Hx contents were also significantly elevated in these CHD patients compared with healthy donors ( Table 2 ). In both humans with CHD and mice on an atherogenic diet, Hb·Hp·Hx complexes were significantly elevated and associated with HDL ( 12 ) ( Table 2 and Figs. 3 and 4 ).

Metabolism of plasma Hb is considered a major function of tissue macrophages, which can take up free Hb or Hb·Hp complexes produced in vitro through the macrophage scavenger receptor CD163 ( 33 , 34 ) and internalize them for degradation ( 35 ). The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/CD91 has been identified ( 36 ) as the receptor responsible for scavenging Hx·heme complexes through receptor-mediated endocytosis ( 37 ). In this paper, we have shown that Hb, Hp, and Hx are associated with HDL in both CHD patients and mouse models of hyperlipidemia/atherosclerosis. Hp has been reported to associate with apoA-1, the major protein component of HDL ( 37 – 40 ), and alter HDL function by impairing lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activation ( 41 ).

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of Hb·Hp·Hx complexes with HDL. Recent studies demonstrated the non-inflammatory clearance of Hb·Hp complexes formed in vitro ( 35 , 42 – 45 ). Schaer et al. ( 42 ) examined by gene array analysis the transcriptional response of human monocyte-macrophages to Hb·Hp complexes formed in vitro . The macrophage response was non-inflammatory and was characterized by antioxidative and anti-inflammatory gene expression with prominent induction of HO-1. We show that Hb·Hp·Hx complexes associate with HDL in CHD patients and in mouse models of hyperlipidemia/atherosclerosis but not in healthy blood donors or in wild type mice on a chow diet ( Table 2 and Figs. 3 and 4 ). HDL from the patients and the mice on the atherogenic diet has been shown to be proinflammatory ( Figs. 1 and 7 ), and it remains to be determined whether Hb·Hp·Hx complexes in such proinflammatory HDL are cleared via pathways involving CD163 (Hp), CD91 (Hx), or classic scavenger receptors SR-B1 and CD36. Moreover, it will be interesting to determine the type of inflammatory responses mediated by macrophages or hepatocytes that are exposed to proinflammatory HDL.

Our results show that Hp is required for the association of Hb with proinflammatory HDL ( Figs. 6 and 7 ). Interestingly, neither Hp knock-out mice ( 46 ) nor humans with anhaptoglobinemia ( 47 ) display compromised Hb clearance either in the absence or presence of severe hemolysis. Schaer et al. ( 34 ) demonstrated that Hb without Hp readily interacts with CD163 on human monocyte-derived macrophages, resulting in the non-inflammatory removal of Hb. Moreover, free Hb is actually taken up by hepatic cells faster than Hb·Hp complexes ( 48 , 49 ). However, in the presence of severe hemolysis, the absence of Hp was associated with greater oxidative tissue damage, and Lim et al. ( 46 ) concluded that Hp evolved to protect against hemolytically induced tissue damage. Thus, it is possible that the small amounts of non-RBC Hb found in the non-lipoprotein fractions of serum in the absence of increased hemolysis or hyperlipidemia/atherosclerosis are cleared by the anti-inflammatory CD163 pathway. HDL-mediated clearance of Hb may be via another pathway and therefore may not be anti-inflammatory. The induction of an acute phase response in hyperlipidemia/atherosclerosis may lead to elevated levels of Hp that associate with HDL and result in the binding of Hb to HDL. If the resulting HDL-associated complexes do not interact with macrophages via the anti-oxidant CD163 pathway, the clearance of the HDL-associated Hb might result in further oxidative stress and cytokine production. Thus, one of the mechanisms by which HDL may become proinflammatory may well be related to its Hb content, as suggested by the data presented here.

Our results are also consistent with the work of Levy et al. ( 50 ). Humans have two classes of alleles for Hp, designated 1 and 2. The Hp 2 allele is found only in humans. All other mammals, including mice, have only the Hp 1 allele and therefore the Hp 1-1 genotype. The Hp 2-2 genotype has been associated with increased risk of CHD. The Hp 1-1 genotype produces a monomer that is monovalent and thus can only associate with one other haptoglobin molecule to create dimers. In contrast, the Hp 2-2 genotype is bivalent and can associate with two different haptoglobin monomers and thus can form cyclic polymers. The Hb/Hp 1-1 complex was found to stimulate macrophages to secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines much more than the Hp 2-2 complex ( 44 , 51 ). Levy et al. ( 50 ) generated mice that express the Hp 2 allele by homologous recombination. Lesions from Hp 2-2 mice on a C57BL/6 apoE −/− background had increased iron, LOOH, and macrophage accumulation, as compared with plaques from C57BL/6 apoE −/− Hp 1-1 mice ( 50 ). The work of Levy and colleagues taken in the context of our report suggests that individuals with the Hp 2-2 genotype may have proinflammatory HDL with increased Hb content compared with individuals with the Hp 1-1 genotype. More recently, Levy and co-workers ( 52 ) found that in Hp 2-2 diabetic humans and Hp 2-2 diabetic mice, Hb and lipid peroxides associated with HDL were increased, and the HDL was dysfunctional in its ability to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages compared with Hp 1-1 subjects. Our results are in agreement with the findings of Levy and co-workers ( 52 ). Unfortunately, in the present study design, we did not have access to the genotypes of the human samples. We plan to pursue the correlation between Hp genetic predisposition and HDL inflammatory properties in a separate study.

The data presented here suggest that the ability of apoA-1 mimetic peptides to render proinflammatory HDL anti-inflammatory is probably related in part to their ability to decrease the content of Hb in HDL ( Fig. 8 ). The decrease in Hp and Hx levels induced by treatment with the apoA-1 mimetic peptide ( Fig. 9 ) may have been due to a peptide-mediated reduction of tissue inflammation, which in turn reduced Hp and Hx levels, thus preventing Hb from associating with HDL. After treatment of apoE −/− mice with the apoA-1 mimetic peptide, there appeared to be a return of some of the non-RBC Hb to the non-lipoprotein fractions of serum ( Fig. 8 B ). The clearance of this non-lipoprotein-bound Hb could occur via the CD163 pathway and thus be anti-inflammatory. The anti-inflammatory properties of apoA-1 mimetic peptides could in part be due to a favorable action on macrophage iron metabolism. Fig. 10 shows a proposed model for the clearance of Hb·Hp·Hx complexes based on whether or not the complexes associate with HDL. These interesting possibilities are amenable to experimental testing in future studies.

In conclusion, we have shown that Hb·Hp·Hx complexes associate with HDL in CHD patients and mouse models of atherosclerosis. The association of Hb·Hp·Hx complexes correlates positively with the proinflammatory properties of HDL in mice and humans. We have further shown that, under hyperlipidemia/atherogenic conditions in mice, Hp is required for both the association of Hb with HDL and the accumulation of ROS in HDL. The studies reported here strongly suggest that the proinflammatory nature of HDL is at least in part due to its Hb content and that apoA-1 mimetic peptides may render HDL anti-inflammatory by reducing HDL-associated Hb levels.
