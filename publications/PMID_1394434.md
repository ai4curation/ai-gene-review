The function of the yeast SSB 70 kd heatshock proteins (hsp70s) was investigated 
by a variety of approaches. The SSB hsp70s (Ssb1/2p) are associated with 
translating ribosomes. This association is disrupted by puromycin, suggesting 
that Ssb1/2p may bind directly to the nascent polypeptide. Mutant ssb1 ssb2 
strains grow slowly, contain a low number of translating ribosomes, and are 
hypersensitive to several inhibitors of protein synthesis. The slow growth 
phenotype of ssb1 ssb2 mutants is suppressed by increased copy number of a gene 
encoding a novel translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha)-like 
protein. We suggest that cytosolic hsp70 aids in the passage of the nascent 
polypeptide chain through the ribosome in a manner analogous to the role played 
by organelle-localized hsp70 in the transport of proteins across membranes.
