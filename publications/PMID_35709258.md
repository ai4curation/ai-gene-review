The centrosome provides an intracellular anchor for the cytoskeleton, regulating 
cell division, cell migration, and cilia formation. We used spatial proteomics 
to elucidate protein interaction networks at the centrosome of human induced 
pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons. 
Centrosome-associated proteins were largely cell type-specific, with protein 
hubs involved in RNA dynamics. Analysis of neurodevelopmental disease cohorts 
identified a significant overrepresentation of NSC centrosome proteins with 
variants in patients with periventricular heterotopia (PH). Expressing the 
PH-associated mutant pre-mRNA-processing factor 6 (PRPF6) reproduced the 
periventricular misplacement in the developing mouse brain, highlighting 
missplicing of transcripts of a microtubule-associated kinase with centrosomal 
location as essential for the phenotype. Collectively, cell type-specific 
centrosome interactomes explain how genetic variants in ubiquitous proteins may 
convey brain-specific phenotypes.
