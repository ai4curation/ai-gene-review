Differences in biomolecular sequence and function underlie dramatic ranges of 
appearance and behavior among species. We studied the basic region-leucine 
zipper (bZIP) transcription factors and quantified bZIP dimerization networks 
for five metazoan and two single-cell species, measuring interactions in vitro 
for 2891 protein pairs. Metazoans have a higher proportion of heteromeric bZIP 
interactions and more network complexity than the single-cell species. The 
metazoan bZIP interactomes have broadly similar structures, but there has been 
extensive rewiring of connections compared to the last common ancestor, and each 
species network is highly distinct. Many metazoan bZIP orthologs and paralogs 
have strikingly different interaction specificities, and some differences arise 
from minor sequence changes. Our data show that a shifting landscape of 
biochemical functions related to signaling and gene expression contributes to 
species diversity.
