Grb2-associated binder-1 (Gab1) is an adapter protein related to the insulin 
receptor substrate family. It is a substrate for the insulin receptor as well as 
the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and other receptor-tyrosine kinases. 
To investigate the role of Gab1 in signaling pathways downstream of growth 
factor receptors, we stimulated rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 
with EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Gab1 was 
tyrosine-phosphorylated by EGF and PDGF within 1 min. AG1478 (an EGF receptor 
kinase-specific inhibitor) failed to block PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine 
phosphorylation, suggesting that transactivated EGF receptor is not responsible 
for this signaling event. Because Gab1 associates with phospholipase Cgamma 
(PLCgamma), we studied the role of the PLCgamma pathway in Gab1 tyrosine 
phosphorylation. Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by PDGF was impaired in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells expressing mutant PDGFbeta receptor (Y977F/Y989F: lacking 
the binding site for PLCgamma). Pretreatment of VSMC with (a specific PLCgamma 
inhibitor) inhibited Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation as well, indicating the 
importance of the PLCgamma pathway. Gab1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by phorbol 
ester to the same extent as PDGF stimulation. Studies using antisense protein 
kinase C (PKC) oligonucleotides and specific inhibitors showed that PKCalpha and 
PKCepsilon are required for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Binding of Gab1 to 
the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was 
significantly decreased by PLCgamma and/or PKC inhibition, suggesting the 
importance of the PLCgamma/PKC-dependent Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation for the 
interaction with other signaling molecules. Because PDGF-mediated ERK activation 
is enhanced in Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress Gab1, Gab1 serves as 
an important link between PKC and ERK activation by PDGFbeta receptors in VSMC.
