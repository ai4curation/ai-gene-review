Cytokines control cell differentiation, proliferation, and function by 
regulating gene expression program. Physiological roles and induction mechanisms 
of cytokine-inducible genes are not fully understood. Here, we identified a 
novel immediate-early cytokine-responsive gene, cyclon (cytokine-induced protein 
with coiled-coil domain), which is induced in a hematopoietic cell line by 
interleukin 3 (IL-3). cyclon gene encodes a phosphorylated nuclear protein 
consisting of repetitive sequences in the amino-terminus and a coiled-coil 
domain in the carboxyl-terminus. A novel transient reporter assay revealed that 
mouse cyclon promoter contains redundant elements for IL-3-induced gene 
expression.
