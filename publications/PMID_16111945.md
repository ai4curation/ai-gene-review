Programmed cell death (PCD) is an essential and highly orchestrated process that 
plays a major role in morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis during development. 
In humans, defects in regulation or execution of cell death lead to diabetes, 
neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Two major types of PCD have been 
distinguished: the caspase-mediated process of apoptosis and the 
caspase-independent process involving autophagy. Although apoptosis and 
autophagy are often activated together in response to stress, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying their interplay remain unclear. Here we show that BEC-1, 
the C. elegans ortholog of the yeast and mammalian autophagy proteins Atg6/Vps30 
and Beclin 1, is essential for development. We demonstrate that BEC-1 is 
necessary for the function of the class III PI3 kinase LET-512/Vps34, an 
essential protein required for autophagy, membrane trafficking, and endocytosis. 
Furthermore, BEC-1 forms a complex with the antiapoptotic protein CED-9/Bcl-2, 
and its depletion triggers CED-3/Caspase-dependent PCD. Based on our results, we 
propose that bec-1 represents a link between autophagy and apoptosis, thus 
supporting the view that the two processes act in concerted manner in the cell 
death machinery.
