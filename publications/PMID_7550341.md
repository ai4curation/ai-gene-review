We now report a mutation in the nuclear-encoded flavoprotein (Fp) subunit gene 
of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in two siblings with complex II deficiency 
presenting as Leigh syndrome. Both patients were homozygous for an Arg554Trp 
substitution in the Fp subunit. Their parents (first cousins) were heterozygous 
for the mutation that occurred in a conserved domain of the protein and was 
absent from 120 controls. The deleterious effect of the Arg to Trp substitution 
on the catalytic activity of SDH was observed in a SDH- yeast strain transformed 
with mutant Fp cDNA. The Fp subunit gene is duplicated in the human genome 
(3q29; 5p15), with only the gene on chromosome 5 expressed in human-hamster 
somatic cell hybrids. This is the first report of a nuclear gene mutation 
causing a mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in humans.
