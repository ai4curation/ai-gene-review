Gene expression by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is tightly controlled by 
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) at discrete checkpoints during the transcription 
cycle. The pausing checkpoint following transcription initiation is primarily 
controlled by CDK9. We discovered that CDK9-mediated, RNAPII-driven 
transcription is functionally opposed by a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex 
that is recruited to transcription sites by the Integrator complex subunit 
INTS6. PP2A dynamically antagonizes phosphorylation of key CDK9 substrates 
including DSIF and RNAPII-CTD. Loss of INTS6 results in resistance to tumor cell 
death mediated by CDK9 inhibition, decreased turnover of CDK9 
phospho-substrates, and amplification of acute oncogenic transcriptional 
responses. Pharmacological PP2A activation synergizes with CDK9 inhibition to 
kill both leukemic and solid tumor cells, providing therapeutic benefit in vivo. 
These data demonstrate that fine control of gene expression relies on the 
balance between kinase and phosphatase activity throughout the transcription 
cycle, a process dysregulated in cancer that can be exploited therapeutically.
