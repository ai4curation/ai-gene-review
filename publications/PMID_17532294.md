The microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein and its activator dynactin drive 
vesicular transport and mitotic spindle organization. p150(Glued) is the 
dynactin subunit responsible for binding to dynein and microtubules. The F-box 
proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex 
called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which governs phosphorylation-dependent 
ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis. Our recent study showed that the 
proteolysis of mitotic kinesin CENP-E is mediated by SCF via a direct Skp1 link 
[D. Liu, N. Zhang, J. Du, X. Cai, M. Zhu, C. Jin, Z. Dou, C. Feng, Y. Yang, L. 
Liu, K. Takeyasu, W. Xie, X. Yao, Interaction of Skp1 with CENP-E at the midbody 
is essential for cytokinesis, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 345 (2006) 
394-402]. Here we show that F-box protein FBXL5 interacts with p150(Glued) and 
orchestrates its turnover via ubiquitination. FBXL5 binds to p150(Glued)in vitro 
and in vivo. FBXL5 and p150(Glued) co-localize primarily in the cytoplasm with 
peri-nuclear enrichment in HeLa cells. Overexpression of FBXL5 promotes 
poly-ubiquitination of p150(Glued) and protein turnover of p150(Glued). Our 
findings provide a potential mechanism by which p150(Glued) protein function is 
regulated by SCFs.
