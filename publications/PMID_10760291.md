PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in human cancers. Although many 
mutations target the phosphatase domain, others create a truncated protein 
lacking the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif or a protein that extends beyond the 
PDZ-binding motif. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a 
membrane-associated guanylate kinase family protein with multiple PDZ domains 
[AIP-1 (atrophin interacting protein 1), renamed MAGI-2 (membrane associated 
guanylate kinase inverted-2)]. MAGI-2 contains eight potential protein-protein 
interaction domains and is localized to tight junctions in the membrane of 
epithelial cells. PTEN binds to MAGI-2 through an interaction between the 
PDZ-binding motif of PTEN and the second PDZ domain of MAGI-2. MAGI-2 enhances 
the ability of PTEN to suppress Akt activation. Furthermore, certain PTEN 
mutants have reduced stability, which is restored by adding the minimal 
PDZ-binding motif back to the truncated protein. We propose that MAGI-2 improves 
the efficiency of PTEN signaling through assembly of a multiprotein complex at 
the cell membrane.

Abstract

PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in human cancers. Although many mutations target the phosphatase domain, others create a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif or a protein that extends beyond the PDZ-binding motif. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a membrane-associated guanylate kinase family protein with multiple PDZ domains [AIP-1 (atrophin interacting protein 1), renamed MAGI-2 (membrane associated guanylate kinase inverted-2)]. MAGI-2 contains eight potential protein–protein interaction domains and is localized to tight junctions in the membrane of epithelial cells. PTEN binds to MAGI-2 through an interaction between the PDZ-binding motif of PTEN and the second PDZ domain of MAGI-2. MAGI-2 enhances the ability of PTEN to suppress Akt activation. Furthermore, certain PTEN mutants have reduced stability, which is restored by adding the minimal PDZ-binding motif back to the truncated protein. We propose that MAGI-2 improves the efficiency of PTEN signaling through assembly of a multiprotein complex at the cell membrane.

Discussion

Our data support a model for regulation of PTEN function through binding to the MAGUK family protein MAGI-2 (see Fig. 6, which is published as supplementary material on the PNAS web site, www.pnas.org ). Because MAGI-2 expression is restricted to certain tissues whereas PTEN is expressed ubiquitously, there may be other PDZ domain-containing proteins that bind PTEN ( 34 ). This model is conceptually similar to the regulation of photoreceptor signaling protein levels in the fly eye by the multi-PDZ domain scaffold protein InaD ( 24 ). InaD assembles a series of proteins involved in transmission of photoreceptor signals, each binding a distinct PDZ domain, into a multisubunit signaling complex. InaD gene deletion causes a slowed rate of photoreceptor signal transduction. Flies with InaD alleles containing mutations in individual PDZ domains express reduced levels of the respective binding protein, consistent with the notion that binding to the PDZ domain protects the signaling protein from degradation. Because MAGI-2 contains six potential PDZ domains and two WW domains, it is likely to bind other proteins in addition to PTEN. Because WW domains are known to bind proline-rich motifs as well as phospho-serine/threonine residues ( 35 , 36 ), potential MAGI-2-binding proteins are not restricted to those containing PDZ domain-binding motifs. Thus, MAGI-2 may function as a scaffold protein that could assemble a multisubunit signaling complex.

Many mutations in tumors affect the C terminus of PTEN, including three independent missense mutations that target the stop codon and result in 8 aa added to the PDZ-binding motif ( 37 – 39 ). These mutations are predicted to disrupt binding to PDZ domains. We provide experimental evidence implicating MAGI-2 in PTEN function by showing that expression of MAGI-2 enhances the ability of PTEN to suppress Akt activation. We also demonstrate that PTEN mutants that fail to bind MAGI-2 are defective in their ability to completely suppress Akt activation. It is important to note that these mutants have partial rather than complete loss of function, a phenotype consistent with the concept that scaffold proteins optimize activity through a signaling pathway but are not essential. Studies using C-terminal PTEN truncation mutants report conflicting results regarding the role of the PDZ-binding motif ( 9 , 40 , 41 ). However, all of these experiments rely on overexpression of the mutant PTEN protein, which may mask any loss of function phenotype that results from failure to bind a scaffold protein. The most definitive strategy to address this issue is through targeted mutation in the mouse germ line. Our data showing partial loss of function would predict that a PDZ-binding mutant “knockin” may have a less severe phenotype than the embryonic lethality observed with complete PTEN knockouts. The recently determined crystal structure of PTEN shows the presence of a lipid binding C2 domain postulated to play a role in membrane localization ( 42 ). Data presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that both the C2 domain and the PDZ-binding motif contribute to the recruitment and maintenance of membrane association of PTEN.

Our studies also have uncovered a role for the C terminus in maintaining protein stability and are in agreement with a recent report ( 41 ). We postulate that these truncations cause loss of function because of a shortened protein half-life as well as an inability to dock to a PDZ-domain scaffold protein like MAGI-2. Studies of PTEN -deficient embryonic stem cells indicate that a 50% reduction in PTEN protein level may be sufficient to produce a tumor prone phenotype ( 18 ). Our data with the PTEN 1–394 mutant establish that the PDZ-binding motif is not required for stability, yet adding the PDZ-binding motif back to an unstable PTEN truncation mutant is sufficient to restore stability. Alternative considerations include the potential role of phosphorylation in regulating protein stability. More work is needed to define the variables that control PTEN stability.

Inactivation of PTEN through protein destabilization is reminiscent of other tumor suppressors such as p53 and p27Kip1, which have reduced stability in some cancer cells ( 43 , 44 ). Although similar in concept, the PTEN example discussed here differs in that the genetic abnormality occurs in PTEN itself rather than in the protein degradation machinery. Certain human tumors have reduced PTEN protein levels without gene mutation or loss of mRNA expression ( 45 ). Growing evidence indicates that PTEN inactivation can occur through a range of mechanisms, including gene deletion or mutation, loss of mRNA expression, and reduced protein stability.

Loss of function mutations in the Drosophila MAGUK protein discs large (DLG) cause outgrowths of the imaginal disk, leading to the concept that DLG functions as a tumor suppressor ( 46 ). Our observation that MAGI-2 enhances PTEN function raises the possibility that MAGI-2 itself may act as a tumor suppressor. MAGI-2 has been localized to chromosome 7q21 ( 26 ), a region that is deleted in uterine leiomyomas, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma ( 47 – 50 ). Definitive tests of this hypothesis will require analysis of MAGI-2 in clinical material and/or the creation of MAGI-2 loss-of-function mutations.
