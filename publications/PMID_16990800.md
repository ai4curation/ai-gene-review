The 26S proteasome is a multisubunit protease responsible for regulated 
proteolysis in eukaryotic cells. It is composed of one catalytic 20S proteasome 
and two 19S regulatory particles attached on both ends of 20S proteasomes. Here, 
we describe the identification of Adrm1 as a novel proteasome interacting 
protein in mammalian cells. Although the overall sequence of Adrm1 has weak 
homology with the yeast Rpn13, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions exhibit 
significant homology. Therefore, we designated it as hRpn13. hRpn13 interacts 
with a base subunit Rpn2 via its amino-terminus. The majority of 26S proteasomes 
contain hRpn13, but a portion of them does not, indicating that hRpn13 is not an 
integral subunit. Intriguingly, we found that hRpn13 recruits UCH37, a 
deubiquitinating enzyme known to associate with 26 proteasomes. The 
carboxyl-terminal regions containing KEKE motifs of both hRpn13 and UCH37 are 
involved in their physical interaction. Knockdown of hRpn13 caused no obvious 
proteolytic defect but loss of UCH37 proteins and decrease in deubiquitinating 
activity of 26S proteasomes. Our results indicate that hRpn13 is essential for 
the activity of UCH37.
