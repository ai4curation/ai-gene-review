We report here the structure-functional characterization of a novel intronless 
gene, BRCC2, located on human chromosome 11q24.1. BRCC2 open reading frame (327 
bp) codes for an approximately 12-kDa protein (108 amino acids (aa)) localized 
predominantly in the cytosol and to a lesser extent in the mitochondria. Ectopic 
expression of BRCC2 cDNA also was found in both the cytosol and mitochondria. 
Exogenous expression of BRCC2 caused apoptotic cell death in three different 
cell lines as evidenced by enhanced chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, 
or an enhanced number of cells in the sub-G(1) phase. In human prostate cancer 
cells (PC-3), BRCC2-induced DNA fragmentation was blocked efficiently by 
coexpression of the anti-apoptotic molecule, Bcl-X(L). Transient transfection of 
BRCC2 cDNA into PC-3 cells in the presence of a broad-range caspase inhibitor, 
Z-VAD-fmk (100 microM, 24 h), abrogated DNA fragmentation. Consistently, BRCC2 
expression correlated with the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. An 
N-terminal deletion mutant of BRCC2 (10.2 kDa, Delta1-16 aa) lacking a BH3-like 
domain (5-12 aa, LPIEGQEI) or BRCC2 containing a mutant BH3-like domain (leucine 
5-->glutamate) failed to induce apoptosis, whereas a C-terminal deletion mutant 
(6.8 kDa, Delta62-108 aa) retained the apoptotic activity comparable to the 
full-length BRCC2. Finally, the treatment of HeLa cells with doxorubicin or 
hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) led to an increase in the mitochondrial (heavy 
membrane) level of endogenous BRCC2 (doxorubicin (100 ng/ml), 5 h, approximately 
2-fold; H(2)O(2) (200 microM), 2 h, approximately 2-fold). These findings 
demonstrate that BRCC2 functions as a proapoptotic molecule and suggest that 
BRCC2 induces a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway of cell death.
