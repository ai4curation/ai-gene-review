activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) normally 
functions as a phosphorylation-regulated chloride channel on the apical surface 
of epithelial cells, and lack of this function is the primary cause for the 
fatal disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous studies showed that purified, 
reconstituted CFTR can function as a chloride channel and, further, that its 
intrinsic ATPase activity is required to regulate opening and closing of the 
channel gate. However, these previous studies did not identify the quaternary 
structure required to mediate conduction and catalysis. Our present studies show 
that CFTR molecules may self-associate in CHO and Sf9 membranes, as complexes 
close to the predicted size of CFTR dimers can be captured by chemical 
cross-linking reagents and detected using nondissociative PAGE. However, CFTR 
function does not require a multimeric complex for function as we determined 
that purified, reconstituted CFTR monomers are sufficient to mediate regulated 
chloride conduction and ATPase activity.
