The calcium-calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin functions as a 
key mediator of diverse biologic processes, including differentiation, 
apoptosis, growth, and adaptive responses, in part through dephosphorylation and 
activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) transcription factors. 
Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is an upstream component of the 
mitogen-activated protein kinases that serves as a pivotal regulator of 
cytokine-, oxidative-, and stress-induced cell death. Here, we performed a yeast 
two-hybrid screen with calcineurin B as bait, which identified ASK1 as a direct 
physical interacting partner. The C-terminal 218 amino acids of ASK1 were 
sufficient to mediate interaction with calcineurin B in yeast, as well as in 
mammalian cell lysates. Importantly, endogenous calcium binding B subunit (CnB) 
protein interacted with endogenous ASK1 protein in cardiomyocytes at baseline, 
suggesting that the interaction observed in yeast was of potential biologic 
relevance. Indeed, calcineurin directly dephosphorylated ASK1 at serine 967 
using purified proteins or mammalian cell lysates. Dephosphorylation of ASK1 
serine 967 by calcineurin promoted its disassociation from 14-3-3 proteins, 
resulting in ASK1 activation. Calcineurin and ASK1 cooperatively enhanced 
cardiomyocyte apoptosis, while expression of a dominant negative ASK1 blocked 
calcineurin-induced apoptosis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in ask1 
were also partially resistant to calcineurin- or ionomycin-induced apoptosis. 
Finally, ASK1 negatively regulated calcineurin-NFAT signaling indirectly through 
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)- and p38-mediated phosphorylation of NFAT, which 
blocked calcineurin- and agonist-dependent hypertrophic growth of 
cardiomyocytes. Thus, ASK1 and calcineurin-NFAT constitute a feedback regulatory 
circuit in which calcineurin positively regulates ASK1 through direct 
dephosphorylation, while ASK1 negatively regulates calcineurin-NFAT signaling 
through p38- and JNK-mediated NFAT phosphorylation.
