The role of TSP-1 in tumour growth and angiogenesis remains controversial, with 
both stimulatory and inhibitory roles proposed. The effects of TSP-1 on the 
migration of endothelial cells, fibroblast and oral tumour cell lines were 
examined using the transmembrane assay. TSP-1 induced a bi-phasic effect on 
human and bovine endothelial cells: stimulation at low concentrations (0.1-10 
microg/ml) and inhibition at high concentrations (25-100 microg/ml). 
FGF-2-stimulated endothelial cell migration was either further stimulated or 
inhibited by TSP-1, following the same bi-phasic dose response as in the absence 
of FGF-2. In contrast, TSP-1 stimulated the migration of human fibroblast and 
oral tumour cells in a dose dependent manner; a plateau was reached with 5-25 
microg/ml and no inhibitory effect was observed. These effects were partly 
neutralised by antibodies to alphavbeta3 integrin. TGF-beta1 (0.1-200 ng/ml 
tested) mimicked the effects of TSP-1 on cell migration. Function-neutralising 
antibodies to TGF-beta1 completely abolished both the stimulatory and inhibitory 
effects of TSP-1 on endothelial migration, but had no effect on TSP-1-stimulated 
migration of fibroblast and oral tumour cells. The effects of TGF-beta1 were not 
affected by antibodies to TSP-1. These results indicate that the effects of 
TSP-1 on endothelial cell migration are mediated by TGF-beta1, whereas the 
effects on fibroblast and tumour cell migration are TGF-beta1-independent.
