Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that elongates telomeres, is repressed 
in normal human somatic cells but is reactivated during tumor progression. We 
report the cloning of a human gene, hEST2, that shares significant sequence 
similarity with the telomerase catalytic subunit genes of lower eukaryotes. 
hEST2 is expressed at high levels in primary tumors, cancer cell lines, and 
telomerase-positive tissues but is undetectable in telomerase-negative cell 
lines and differentiated telomerase-negative tissues. Moreover, the message is 
up-regulated concomitant with the activation of telomerase during the 
immortalization of cultured cells and down-regulated during in vitro cellular 
differentiation. Taken together, these observations suggest that the induction 
of hEST2 mRNA expression is required for the telomerase activation that occurs 
during cellular immortalization and tumor progression.
