Mutations in type 3 repeats of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) cause 
two skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal 
dysplasia (MED). We expressed recombinant wild-type COMP that showed structural 
and functional properties identical to COMP isolated from cartilage. A fragment 
encompassing the eight type 3 repeats binds 14 calcium ions with moderate 
affinity and high cooperativity and presumably forms one large disulfide-bonded 
folding unit. A recombinant PSACH mutant COMP in which Asp-469 was deleted (D469 
Delta) and a MED mutant COMP in which Asp-361 was substituted by Tyr (D361Y) 
were both secreted into the cell culture medium of human cells. Circular 
dichroism spectroscopy revealed only small changes in the secondary structures 
of D469 Delta and D361Y, demonstrating that the mutations do not dramatically 
affect the folding and stability of COMP. However, the local conformations of 
the type 3 repeats were disturbed, and the number of bound calcium ions was 
reduced to 10 and 8, respectively. In addition to collagen I and II, collagen IX 
also binds to COMP with high affinity. The PSACH and MED mutations reduce the 
binding to collagens I, II, and IX and result in an altered zinc dependence. 
These interactions may contribute to the development of the patient phenotypes 
and may explain why MED can also be caused by mutations in collagen IX genes.
