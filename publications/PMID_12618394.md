SIR2 proteins have NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase activity, but no 
metabolic role has been assigned to any of these proteins. In Salmonella 
enterica, SIR2 function was required for activity of the acetyl-CoA synthetase 
(Acs) enzyme. A greater than two orders of magnitude increase in the specific 
activity of Acs enzyme synthesized by a sirtuin-deficient strain was measured 
after treatment with homogeneous S. enterica SIR2 protein. Human SIR2A and yeast 
SIR2 proteins restored growth of SIR2-deficient S. enterica on acetate and 
propionate, suggesting that eukaryotic cells may also use SIR2 proteins to 
control the synthesis of acetyl-CoA by the level of acetylation of acetyl-CoA 
synthetases. Consistent with this idea, growth of a quintuple sir2 hst1 hst2 
hst3 hst4 mutant strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on acetate or 
propionate was severely impaired. The data suggest that the Hst3 and Hst4 
proteins are the most important for allowing growth on these short-chain fatty 
acids.
