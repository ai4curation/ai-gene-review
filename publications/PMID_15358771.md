The activity and structural integrity of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is of 
crucial importance for the prevention of cancer. p53 is a conformational 
flexible and labile protein, in which structured and unstructured regions 
function in a synergistic manner. The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is known to bind 
to mutant and wild type p53 in vivo. Using highly purified proteins we analyzed 
the interaction and the binding sites between both proteins in detail. Our 
results demonstrate that Hsp90 binds to a folded, native-like conformation of 
p53 in vitro with micromolar affinity. Specifically, the DNA-binding domain of 
p53 and the middle and carboxy-terminal domains of Hsp90 are responsible for 
this interaction, which is essential to stabilize p53 at physiological 
temperatures and to prevent it from irreversible thermal inactivation. Our 
results are in agreement with a model in which Hsp90 is required to maintain the 
folded, active state of p53 by a reversible interaction, thus introducing an 
additional level of regulation.
