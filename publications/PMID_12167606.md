Mutations in the rBAT and b(0,+)AT genes cause type I and non-type I cystinuria, 
respectively. The disulfide-linked rBAT-b(0,+)AT heterodimer mediates 
high-affinity transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids (b(0,+)-like 
activity) in heterologous cell systems. However, the significance of this 
heterodimer for cystine reabsorption is unknown, as direct evidence for such a 
complex in vivo is lacking and the expression patterns of rBAT and b(0,+)AT 
along the proximal tubule are opposite. We addressed this issue by biochemical 
means. Western blot analysis of mouse and human kidney brush-border membranes 
showed that rBAT and b(0,+)AT were solely expressed as heterodimers of identical 
size and that both proteins coprecipitated. Moreover, quantitative 
immunopurification of b(0,+)AT followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry 
analysis established that b(0,+)AT heterodimerizes exclusively with rBAT. 
Together with cystine reabsorption data, our results demonstrate that a 
decreasing expression gradient of heterodimeric rBAT-b(0,+)AT along the proximal 
tubule is responsible for virtually all apical cystine reabsorption. As a 
corollary of the above, there should be an excess of rBAT expression over that 
of b(0,+)AT protein in the kidney. Indeed, complete immunodepletion of b(0,+)AT 
did not coprecipitate >20-30% of rBAT. Therefore, another rBAT-associated 
subunit may be present in latter parts of the proximal tubule.
