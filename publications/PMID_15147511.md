The torsins comprise a four-member family of AAA+ chaperone proteins, including 
torsinA, torsinB, torp2A and torp3A in humans. Mutations in torsinA underlie 
early onset torsion dystonia, an autosomal dominant, neurologically based 
movement disorder. TorsinB is highly homologous to torsinA with its gene 
adjacent to that for torsinA on human chromosome 9q34. Antibodies have been 
generated which can distinguish torsinA and torsinB from each other, and from 
the torps in human and rodent cells. TorsinB (approximately MW 38 kDa), like 
torsinA ( approximately MW 37 kDa), is an N-glycosylated protein and both reside 
primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope in cultured 
cells. Immunoprecipitation studies in cultured cells and human brain tissue 
indicate that torsinA and torsinB are associated with each other in cells. 
Overexpression of both wild-type torsinB and mutant torsinA lead to enrichment 
of the protein in the nuclear envelope and formation of large cytoplasmic 
inclusions. We conclude that torsinB and torsinA are localized in overlapping 
cell compartments within the same protein complex, and thus may carry out 
related functions in vivo.
