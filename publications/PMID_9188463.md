Human renal cortex and heart cDNA libraries were screened for a human homolog of 
rabbit PCLP1 using the rabbit PCLP1 cDNA as a probe. Clones spanning 5869 base 
pairs with an open reading frame coding for a 528-amino acid peptide were 
obtained. The putative peptide contains a potential signal peptide and a single 
membrane-spanning region. The extracellular domain contains multiple potential 
sites for N- and O-linked glycosylation and 4 cysteines for potential disulfide 
bonding similar to rabbit PCLP1. On Northern blot a major transcript is seen at 
5.9 kilobases. Antibodies to this protein show a doublet at 160/165 kDa on 
Western blots of human glomerular extract and a pattern of intense glomerular 
staining and vascular endothelial staining on immunofluorescence of human kidney 
sections. Comparison of the rabbit and human peptide sequences shows a high 
degree of identity in the transmembrane and intracellular domains (96%) with a 
lower degree of identity in the extracellular domain (36%). An antibody to the 
intracellular domain reacted across species (human, rabbit, and rat) and 
recognized both rabbit PCLP1 and rat podocalyxin. An interspecies Southern blot 
probed with a cDNA coding for the intracellular domain showed strong 
hybridization to all vertebrates tested in a pattern suggesting a single copy 
gene. We conclude that this cDNA and putative peptide represent the human 
homolog of rabbit PCLP1 and rat podocalyxin.
