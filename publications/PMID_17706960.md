upregulate ErbB4 or develop a mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor, 
changes that normally accompany the acquisition of an intermediate fate. 
Likewise, transgenic brains do not develop a distinct subventricular zone or 
superficial cortical layers, and overexpression of stabilized beta-catenin by in 
utero electroporation caused a relative reduction of upper layer vs. lower layer 
cortical neurons, indicating that persistent beta-catenin activity interferes 
with the generation of progenitors responsible for the production of upper layer 
cortical neurons. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that beta-catenin 
functions to maintain the radial glial population, and suggest that 
downregulation of beta-catenin signaling may be critical to facilitate the 
transition to an intermediate progenitor phenotype.

Abstract

Transgenic mice expressing stabilized β-catenin in neural progenitors develop enlarged brains resulting from increased progenitor expansion. To more precisely define β-catenin regulation of progenitor fate, we employed a conditional transgenic approach to delete the β-catenin regulatory domain from neural progenitors, resulting in expression of stabilized protein from its endogenous promoter in these cells and their progeny. An increased fraction of transgenic cortical cells express the progenitor markers Nestin and LewisX, confirming a relative expansion of this population. Sustained β-catenin activity expands RC2 and Pax6 expression in the developing cortex while postponing the onset of Tbr2 expression, suggesting a delay in maturation of radial glia into intermediate progenitors. Furthermore, transgenic cortical cells fail to either upregulate ErbB4 or develop a mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor, changes that normally accompany acquisition of an intermediate fate. Likewise, transgenic brains do not develop a distinct subventricular zone or superficial cortical layers, and overexpression of stabilized β-catenin by in utero electroporation caused a relative reduction of upper layer vs. lower layer cortical neurons, indicating that persistent β-catenin activity interferes with the generation of progenitors responsible for the production of upper layer cortical neurons. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that β-catenin functions to maintain the radial glial population, and suggest that downregulation of β-catenin signaling may be critical to facilitate the transition to an intermediate progenitor phenotype.

INTRODUCTION

Assembly of the intricate architecture of the mammalian brain requires the ordered specification of a broad variety of cell types ( Edlund and Jessell, 1999 ). The complexity and elegance of brain development is exemplified by the “inside-out” construction of the neocortex, in which neurons fated to reside in the infragranular cortical layers (V-VI) are generated first, while later-born neurons migrate beyond these cells to compose the superficial layers (II-IV) ( Takahashi et al., 1999 ). Deep layer neurons are proposed to originate from the asymmetric division of radial glial ventricular zone (VZ) progenitors at the apical surface ( Malatesta et al., 2000 ; Miyata et al., 2001 ; Noctor et al., 2004 ). In contrast, evidence suggests that the upper layers derive primarily from the symmetric division of subventricular zone (SVZ) cells, also referred to as intermediate or basal progenitors ( Tarabykin et al., 2001 ; Haubensak et al., 2004 ; Noctor et al., 2004 ; Zimmer et al., 2004 ). Since alterations in the balance between radial glial and intermediate progenitor proliferation could have a significant impact on ultimate brain architecture, the signals that control the timing and rate of each type of division are critical to normal central nervous system (CNS) function.

Canonical Wnt signaling mediated by β-catenin has been proposed to function in both neural progenitor cell expansion and neuronal lineage choice ( Chenn and Walsh, 2002 ; Zechner et al., 2003 ; Hirabayashi et al., 2004 ; Israsena et al., 2004 ). In the absence of Wnts, cytosolic β-catenin is recruited into a complex with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and axin. This association facilitates its N-terminal phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and its consequent ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Wnt activation of Frizzled/LRP co-receptors increases the stable pool of β-catenin by disrupting this complex. Free β-catenin can then enter the nucleus where it associates with TCF/LEF family members to direct transcription of Wnt target genes ( Clevers and van de Wetering, 1997 ).

Transgenic mice expressing a form of β-catenin resistant to GSK3β-mediated degradation in neural progenitors exhibited a gross horizontal expansion of the cortex resulting from decreased progenitor cell cycle exit ( Chenn and Walsh, 2002 ). Conversely, conditional deletion of β-catenin from cortical progenitors resulted in multiple structural defects, decreased cell proliferation, altered cell migration, and changes in dorsoventral cell identity ( Machon et al., 2003 ; Backman et al., 2005 ). Moreover, focal inhibition of β-catenin signaling caused cortical precursors to prematurely exit the cell cycle and differentiate into neurons ( Woodhead et al, 2006 ). Collectively, these studies suggest that regulation of β-catenin signaling plays a critical role in controlling the production of cortical neurons by regulating progenitor decisions to proliferate or differentiate.

While these data suggest that altered β-catenin function can influence cell fate and tissue patterning in the developing cortex, whether β-catenin functions to regulate specific cortical progenitor populations during development remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that β-catenin-mediated signaling is robust in VZ progenitors but appears to be reduced in the SVZ/intermediate zone (IZ), raising the possibility that β-catenin signaling functions primarily in radial glial progenitors and that modulation of signaling may play a role in progenitor maturation ( Woodhead et al, 2006 ). Here, using a stable mouse line that can be used to achieve conditional and persistent expression of stabilized β-catenin from its endogenous promoter, along with in utero electroporation approaches, we examine the role of β-catenin on distinct classes of progenitors during cortical development.

DISCUSSION

Conditional expression of stabilized β-catenin in neural progenitor cells causes an enlargement of cortical surface area resulting from expansion of the progenitor population ( Chenn and Walsh, 2002 ). Here we find that the effect of enhanced β-catenin signaling on progenitor expansion is not homogeneous, but rather is characterized by an initial increase in the fraction of Pax6-positive radial glial progenitors and a corresponding delay in the generation of the Tbr2-expressing intermediate progenitors that comprise the SVZ. Furthermore, focal overexpression of stabilized β-catenin in cortical progenitors by in utero electroporation results in a relative decrease in upper layer vs. lower layer cortical neurons. Progenitors expressing stabilized β-catenin neither upregulate ErbB4 expression nor exhibit a mitogenic response to EGF. Collectively, these data suggest that β-catenin acts to maintain the population of radial glial progenitors at the expense of the generation of intermediate progenitors in the embryonic telencephalon, and represents a critical regulator of the capacity of developing progenitors to respond to specific mitogenic signals.

While we propose that persistently enhanced β-catenin activity delays the development of intermediate progenitors, it is clear that β-catenin has further consequences to progenitor maturation, as the Tbr2-expressing cells eventually generated in ΔEx3 transgenic cortices are markedly abnormal. In addition to being distributed in poorly-organized ectopic locations throughout the cortex, possibly indicative of defects in cell migration, these Tbr2-expressing cells do not express other markers characteristic of intermediate progenitors such as Svet1, Cux2 , or ErbB4. Because ΔEx3 transgenic mice also die perinatally, we have not been able to examine whether the absence of these markers represents a transient or permanent delay in differentiation.

The mechanisms regulating progression of radial glial progenitors to intermediate progenitors remain poorly understood. As a population, neural progenitors transition from being exclusively responsive to FGF early in cortical development to being responsive to both EGF and FGF at approximately E13.5 ( Ciccolini, 2001 ). Overexpression of EGFR in VZ progenitors leads them to adopt migratory and proliferative characteristics of their SVZ counterparts ( Burrows et al., 1997 ). Furthermore, infusion of ErbB4 ligands selectively induces proliferation in the SVZ, and conditional deletion of ErbB4, which is primarily expressed in the transit-amplifying population, leads to a disruption of SVZ organization and migration patterns ( Ghashghaei et al., 2006 ). Here we observed that absence of an EGF proliferative response is coupled with loss of the SVZ markers Svet1 and Cux2 . Collectively, these observations lend support to the possibility that the level of EGFR/ErbB4 expression in cortical progenitors plays a critical role in regulating the transition to an intermediate phenotype, and that downregulation of β-catenin signaling may required for this transition to proceed normally.

While this transition correlates with the appearance of Tbr2-expressing progenitors in the SVZ, it remains to be determined whether the switch from Pax6 to Tbr2 expression is directly related to the acquisition of EGF responsiveness. While downregulation of Pax6 is necessary for corneal epithelial cells to proliferate in response to EGF ( Li and Lu, 2005 ), EGF signaling can also function as an upstream antagonist of Pax6 in the Drosophila eye ( Kumar and Moses, 2001 ). While our results suggest that a decrease in Pax6 expression and corresponding upregulation of Tbr2 alone are not sufficient to support the upregulation of ErbB4 and the development of a proliferative response to EGF through ErbB4 activation, they do not exclude the possibility that ErbB4 activity might further stimulate the production of Tbr2-expressing intermediate progenitors.

ErbB4 signaling is instrumental in the development of the SVZ, as its deletion in either the GFAP-positive or nestin-positive neural progenitor populations leads to a disruption of SVZ structural organization ( Anton et al., 2004 ). Moreover, ventricular infusion of the ErbB4 ligand neuregulin-2 exclusively promotes the proliferation of SVZ progenitors, suggesting it may be critical for the normal expansion of this population ( Ghashghaei et al., 2006 ). Intriguingly, ErbB4 may be uniquely poised to impact the expression of factors critical for the differentiation of VZ to SVZ progenitors and subsequently into upper layer neurons, as it is the only member of the EGF receptor family known to undergo intramembrane cleavage, releasing a C-terminal fragment that translocates to the nucleus ( Ni et al., 2001 ). The ErbB4 cytoplasmic fragment was recently shown to antagonize the Eto2 transcriptional corepressor, a function that may be of importance to normal epithelial differentiation ( Linggi and Carpenter, 2006 ).

While symmetric proliferative divisions in the VZ serve to expand the radial glia progenitor pool, recent studies demonstrate that symmetric terminal divisions in the SVZ contribute to neuronal production during mid-to-late cortical development ( Kornack and Rakic, 1995 ; Mione et al., 1997 ; Haubensak et al., 2004 ; Noctor et al., 2004 ). It has been proposed that a two-step pattern of neurogenesis, consisting of asymmetric radial glial divisions in the VZ followed by symmetric terminal divisions in the SVZ, underlies a sustained period of neuron production and the evolutionary expansion of cortical surface area ( Kriegstein et al., 2006 ). Our data suggest that persistent β-catenin signaling may underlie a selective expansion of the radial glial population while delaying the onset of the second stage of abventricular neurogenesis, and that downregulation of β-catenin activity may be a critical prerequisite for this progression.

Although our methods do not enable us to examine directly whether β-catenin expression regulates the specific mitotic outcome of radial glial division, our results support a model where the level of β-catenin signaling can prolong the first phase of progenitor expansion by increasing the relative frequency of symmetric, proliferative divisions versus the secondary mode of self-renewing asymmetric divisions that give rise to one radial glial cell and one intermediate progenitor ( Fig. 9 ). Subsequent modulation of progenitor responsiveness to environmental stimuli, including secreted growth factors such as EGF, may be required for symmetric, proliferative divisions of intermediate progenitors. Changes in the time of onset of the second stage of neurogenesis could have further consequences for the induction of factors involved in the determination of specific layer fates, as illustrated by the absence of Cux2 and Svet1 in the ΔEx3 transgenic cortex.

While Pax6 has not been reported as a direct transcriptional target of β-catenin, its 5’ untranslated region contains multiple putative TCF/LEF binding sites as identified by the Patch 1.0 web-based algorithm (unpublished observations). A previous report demonstrated a ventral expansion of Pax6 expression upon NesCre-mediated conditional expression of stabilized β-catenin ( Backman et al., 2005 ). The converse was true when β-catenin was deleted, suggesting its activity is necessary to achieve appropriate regional patterning of Pax6 expression; in contrast, the pattern of Emx2 expression was unaffected ( Backman et al., 2005 ). These two factors have been shown to play antagonistic roles in the specification of rostral and caudal areas in the developing neocortex, a relationship that was revealed only upon ablation of one or the other factor ( Bishop et al., 2000 ). Therefore the ability of β-catenin to sustain Pax6 expression may not be sufficient to impact cortical regionalization along this axis. Furthermore, since explant studies have revealed that the specification of cortical and hippocampal fields is initiated prior to E10.5 ( Grove and Tole, 1999 ), the timing of the Cre-mediated activation of β-catenin in our current model may not be suited to such an analysis. Our findings nonetheless suggest that an improved understanding of the interrelationship between β-catenin and Pax6 activities will lend valuable insight into the mechanisms that regulate regional patterning of the neocortex as well as the timing and generation of secondary progenitor populations during cortical development.
