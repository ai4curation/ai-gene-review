Cyclophilins (cyclosporin A-binding proteins) are conserved, ubiquitous, and 
abundant proteins that accelerate the isomerization of XaaPro peptide bonds and 
the refolding of proteins in vitro. s-Cyclophilin is a member of the cyclophilin 
family with unique NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions, and with a signal 
sequence. We now report that s-cyclophilin is retained in the cell, and that the 
conserved s-cyclophilin-specific COOH-terminal extension VEKPFAIAKE is 
sufficient to direct a secretory protein to s-cyclophilin containing structures. 
Antibodies to s-cyclophilin-specific peptides were produced and the location of 
the protein was determined by an immunocytochemical study at the light 
microscopic level. s-Cyclophilin colocalized with the Ca(2+)-binding protein 
calreticulin and, to a lesser extent, with the microsomal Ca(2+)-ATPase in the 
myogenic cell line L6, and with the Ca(2+)-binding protein calsequestrin in 
skeletal muscle. In activated platelets, s-cyclophilin immunoreactivity was 
detected in a ring-like structure that might correspond to the Ca(2+)-storing 
and -releasing dense tubular network. In spreading cells, s-cyclophilin 
containing vesicular structures accumulated at actin-rich protrusion sites. 
While s-cyclophilin consistently codistributed with Ca2+ storage site markers, 
the distribution of s-cyclophilin immunoreactivity was not identical to that of 
ER markers. To determine whether the COOH-terminal extension of s-cyclophilin 
was involved in its intracellular transport we added this sequence to the 
COOH-terminus of the secretory protein glia-derived nexin. Appropriate 
constructs were expressed transiently in cultured cells and proteins were 
detected with specific antibodies. We found that glia-derived nexin with the 
COOH-terminal sequence VEKPFAIAKE (but not with the control sequence GLVVMNIT) 
colocalized with endogenous s-cyclophilin, indicating that the sequence 
contained retention information. These results indicate that s-cyclophilin is a 
retained component of an intracellular organelle and that it may accumulate in 
specialized portions of the ER, and possibly in calciosomes. Because of its 
conserved structure, widespread distribution, and abundance s-cyclophilin may be 
a useful marker to study the biogenesis and distribution of ER subcompartments.
