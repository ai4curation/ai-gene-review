Sir2 is a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that extends lifespan in yeast and 
worms. This study examines seven human proteins homologous to Sir2 (SIRT1 
through SIRT7) for cellular localization, expression profiles, protein 
deacetylation activity, and effects on human cell lifespan. We found that: 1) 
three nuclear SIRT proteins (SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7) show different subnuclear 
localizations: SIRT6 and SIRT7 are associated with heterochromatic regions and 
nucleoli, respectively, where yeast Sir2 functions; 2) SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 
are localized in mitochondria, an organelle that links aging and energy 
metabolism; 3) cellular p53 is a major in vivo substrate of SIRT1 deacetylase, 
but not the other six SIRT proteins; 4) SIRT1, but not the other two nuclear 
SIRT proteins, shows an in vitro deacetylase activity on histone H4 and p53 
peptides; and 5) overexpression of any one of the seven SIRT proteins does not 
extend cellular replicative lifespan in normal human fibroblasts or prostate 
epithelial cells. This study supports the notion that multiple human SIRT 
proteins have evolutionarily conserved and nonconserved functions at different 
cellular locations and reveals that the lifespan of normal human cells, in 
contrast to that of lower eukaryotes, cannot be manipulated by increased 
expression of a single SIRT protein.
