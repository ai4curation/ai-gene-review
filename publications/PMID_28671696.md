The postsynaptic density (PSD) contains a collection of scaffold proteins used 
for assembling synaptic signaling complexes. However, it is not known how the 
core-scaffold machinery associates in protein-interaction networks or how 
proteins encoded by genes involved in complex brain disorders are distributed 
through spatiotemporal protein complexes. Here using immunopurification, 
proteomics and bioinformatics, we isolated 2,876 proteins across 41 in vivo 
interactomes and determined their protein domain composition, correlation to 
gene expression levels and developmental integration to the PSD. We defined 
clusters for enrichment of schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, 
developmental delay and intellectual disability risk factors at embryonic day 14 
and adult PSD in mice. Mutations in highly connected nodes alter protein-protein 
interactions modulating macromolecular complexes enriched in disease risk 
candidates. These results were integrated into a software platform, Synaptic 
Protein/Pathways Resource (SyPPRes), enabling the prioritization of disease risk 
factors and their placement within synaptic protein interaction networks.
