requires different interactions within the context of each complex. Abraxas and 
BRCC45 were essential for BRCC36 DUB activity within the RAP80 complex, whereas 
KIAA0157/Abro was the only interaction required for DUB activity within the 
BRISC. Poh1 also required protein interactions for activity, suggesting a common 
regulatory mechanism for JAMM domain DUBs. Finally, BRISC deficiency enhanced 
formation of the BRCA1-RAP80 complex in vivo, increasing BRCA1 levels at DNA 
double strand breaks. These findings reveal that JAMM domain DUB activity and 
K63-Ub levels are regulated by multiple mechanisms within the cell.

Abstract

BRCC36 is a JAMM (JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme) domain, lysine 63-ubiquitin (K63-Ub)-specific deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and a member of two protein complexes: the DNA damage-responsive BRCA1-RAP80 complex, and the cytoplasmic BRCC36 isopeptidase complex (BRISC). The presence of several identical constituents in both complexes suggests common regulatory mechanisms and potential competition between K63-Ub-related signaling in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Surprisingly, we discover that BRCC36 DUB activity requires different interactions within the context of each complex. Abraxas and BRCC45 were essential for BRCC36 DUB activity within the RAP80 complex, whereas KIAA0157/Abro was the only interaction required for DUB activity within the BRISC. Poh1 also required protein interactions for activity, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism for JAMM domain DUBs. Finally, BRISC deficiency enhanced formation of the BRCA1-RAP80 complex in vivo , increasing BRCA1 levels at DNA double strand breaks. These findings reveal that JAMM domain DUB activity and K63-Ub levels are regulated by multiple mechanisms within the cell.

Introduction

The mammalian genome is remarkably stable despite an estimated 10 5 mutagenic events/cell cycle ( 1 ). This exquisite fidelity can be attributed to the multiple and varied activities of the DNA damage response (DDR). 4 To maintain genome integrity, eukaryotic cells activate the DDR, a complex signaling network that integrates and coordinates DNA damage recognition, cell cycle checkpoints, and DNA repair ( 2 , 3 ). Recent evidence implicates ubiquitin chain formation, recognition, and breakdown at the site of the genomic lesion as an essential component of the DDR.

Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid protein that can be attached to a target protein via an isopeptide linkage between the ϵ-amino lysine residue of a target protein and the C-terminal glycine residue within ubiquitin. Protein ubiquitination can have quite complex outcomes resulting from the considerable structural information embedded within ubiquitin polymers. Specifically, a single ubiquitin monomer can be extended through the ubiquitination of any one of seven lysines or through the N terminus, creating polyubiquitin chains ( 4 ). These different ubiquitin topologies result in the formation of diverse structures resulting in vastly different biological outcomes. The canonical Lys 48 -linked polyubiquitination of proteins signals for proteasomal degradation ( 5 ); conversely, Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitin has been implicated in non-degradative signals in response to both cytoplasmic and nuclear cues. Specifically, Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitin is involved in both the recruitment and retention of DNA repair factors at sites of DNA damage ( 6 – 8 ).

BRCA1 is central to the DDR and forms a number of mutually exclusive macromolecular complexes, each with discrete activities ( 9 , 10 ). Recently, it has been shown that the core RAP80 complex plays an important role in facilitating BRCA1 localization to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The RAP80 complex is a five-member stoichiometric complex consisting of RAP80, BRCC36, BRCC45, Abraxas, and MERIT40 ( 11 – 13 ). RAP80, in turn, is recruited to DSBs through its tandem ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) ( 6 , 14 – 16 ), which specifically recognize K63-Ub chains ( 6 ) that are synthesized by the combined actions of several different E3 ligases ( 7 , 8 , 17 – 22 ).

BRCC36 is a member of a unique class of zinc-dependent metalloproteases, termed JAMM (JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme) DUBs ( 23 – 25 ). BRCC36 possesses DUB activity specifically for K63-Ub polyubiquitin chains ( 26 – 28 ). This activity parallels the ubiquitin binding preference of the RAP80 UIM domains ( 6 , 26 , 27 ) and supports the model that parallel and opposing Lys 63 -ubiquitin synthesis and hydrolysis at DSBs regulate the recruitment and retention of DNA repair factors ( 27 , 29 ).

Recently, BRCC36 was also identified as a member of the four-subunit BRCC36 isopeptidase complex (BRISC) ( 26 ). This complex contains three protein components in common with the core RAP80 complex, BRCC36, BRCC45, and MERIT40, whereas the fourth component of the BRISC is the Abraxas paralog, KIAA0157/Abro1. The presence of multiple, common components of each DUB complex raises several possibilities. First, protein interactions within each core protein complex could regulate either the efficiency or the ubiquitin chain specificity of BRCC36 DUB activity. Second, a competition for assembly of the BRCA1-RAP80 and BRISC complexes may exist in vivo , with the relative levels of each complex potentially influencing K63-Ub chain abundance in either the nucleus or cytoplasm. In principle, altering the balance between these two BRCC36-containing complexes could affect the proposed ubiquitin landscape at DSBs to influence the DDR ( 30 ).

In an attempt to answer these questions, we reconstituted and characterized the DUB activity of the RAP80 and BRISC complexes in vitro and examined the in vivo consequences of altering the balance between these BRCC36-containing complexes on DSB recruitment events. Here, we show that BRCC36 DUB activity requires different interactions within the context of each protein complex. Abraxas and BRCC45 are essential for BRCC36 DUB activity in the RAP80 complex, whereas KIAA0157 is the only essential interaction necessary for BRCC36 DUB activity in the BRISC. Protein-protein interaction with MPN − (Mpr-1/Pad-1 N-terminal) domain-containing proteins was also required for the JAMM domain DUB Poh1, a component of the 19 S proteasome lid complex, suggesting a common mode of regulation for this class of DUBs. A second level of regulation was exposed by in vivo experiments. BRISC deficiency strongly increased BRCA1-RAP80 complex formation at sites of damage in vivo , whereas RAP80 deficiency produced the opposite effect, thereby increasing K63-Ub levels at DSBs.

DISCUSSION

A network of enzymes that synthesize and degrade ubiquitin chains stringently regulates ubiquitination and deubiquitination reactions. This is evident by the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of ubiquitin chains at DSBs. A rapid response of at least four different E3 ligases synthesizes a ubiquitin platform for recruitment of DNA repair complexes at DSBs within minutes of DDR induction. Although considerable speculation exists, it is still unknown if the ubiquitin chain topologies are remodeled or edited during the course of the damage response. What is clear, however, is that the kinetics of disappearance of ubiquitin closely follows the resolution of ATM-dependent H2AX phosphorylation on chromatin adjacent to DSBs ( 19 ), revealing a tight link between DDR phosphorylation and ubiquitination.

It has been well established that ubiquitin chain synthesis is regulated by numerous protein-protein interactions. E3 ligases must pair with an E2 enzyme-ubiquitin thioester intermediate in order to transfer ubiquitin to a target substrate. Moreover, many E3 ligases require additional regulatory mechanisms to target them to the site of action. For example, RNF8 utilizes a FHA domain to bind phosphorylated MDC at DSBs, whereas RNF168 employs ubiquitin-binding MIU (motif interacting with ubiquitin) domains to target its E3 ligase activity to sites of damage. The RING domain containing E3 ligase, BRCA1 employs a similar strategy via interaction with RAP80.

Emerging evidence suggests that DDR-related DUB activity is also tightly controlled. In this report, we document that BRCC36 requires one or more protein interactions for enzymatic activity. We provide evidence that such regulation is not unique to BRCC36 but also applies to a second JAMM domain DUB, Poh1. Notably, each required interaction with an MPN − domain protein for activity on K63-Ub. It is interesting to note that, although interaction with MPN − domain proteins may be necessary for some JAMM domain DUBs, it is not an absolute requirement for all DUBs of this class. For example, AMSH-LP is also a Lys 63 -specific, JAMM domain DUB, and it displays DUB activity in the absence of other protein interactions. High resolution structural information exists for AMSH-LP ( 40 ). It will be interesting to compare structures of BRCC36 and Poh1 with AMSH-LP when they become available. Such information may be necessary to fully understand the switch to active enzyme upon association with other members of the RAP80 and BRISC complexes. Differences should be anticipated, given the ability of AMSH-LP to be active as a single polypeptide and to display activity toward artificial substrates not recognized by either the RAP80 or BRISC complexes. In line with this reasoning, sequence alignments reveal a structure of the BRCC36 JAMM domain more similar to that of Poh1 than to that of AMSH-LP (39% similarity between BRCC36 and Poh1 compared with 22% similarity between BRCC36 and AMSH-LP) ( supplemental Fig. S7 ).

Although a member of a different class of DUB enzyme than BRCC36, USP1 also requires protein interactions for DUB activity. USP1 utilizes an active site cysteine nucleophile to hydrolyze monoubiquitinated proliferating cell nuclear antigen and FANCD2 ( 44 , 45 ). USP1-dependent DUB activity relies on an interaction with a stoichiometric binding partner, UAF1 ( 46 ). Another example of protein interactions modifying DUB activity is the USP14 interaction with UBP6. The activity of USP14/UBP6 is stimulated more than 300-fold upon binding to the 19 S regulatory particle. In the case of USP14, two loops (BL1 and BL2) that occlude the active site in the apostructure become ordered when bound to ubiquitin ( 47 ). Exactly how the 19 S regulatory particle relieves the self-inhibition of USP14 is still under investigation. We note, however, that in the alignment of BRCC36 with Poh1 and AMSH-LP, BRCC36 contains two insertions in loop regions before and after the Ins-1 region of AMSH-LP, which in the crystal structure make critical contacts to the C-terminal tail of the distal ubiquitin ( supplemental Fig. S7 ). It remains to be seen whether these insertions may be involved in the regulation of the activity of BRCC36.

A second interesting feature of BRCC36 DUB regulation unique to the RAP80 complex is the requirement of BRCC45. The RAP80 complex lacked detectable DUB activity in the absence of BRCC45. The dominant contribution appeared to be through BRCC45 UEV domain-mediated protein interactions. However, UEV1 and UEV2 mutations, which did not produce a discernable change in protein associations, also reduced DUB activity, suggesting an additional contribution to DUB activity. It is interesting to note that KIAA0157 was sufficient to activate BRCC36 DUB activity, revealing previously unappreciated differences between Abraxas and KIAA0157. Thus, BRCC45 UEV domains are not an absolute requirement for stimulating BRCC36 DUB activity within the BRISC. We had previously demonstrated that cooperative interactions within the RAP80 complex were necessary to maintain protein stability in vivo . Our current findings related to DUB activity provide an additional explanation for the necessity of maintaining multiple different partners within the same protein complex. Each of these proteins appears to contribute to DUB activity in addition to their well documented in vivo roles.

This study also suggests that a third mode of Lys 63 -specific DUB regulation exists in the cell: the partitioning of common components of each complex to either nuclear or cytoplasmic compartments based on the availability of unique members of each complex ( e.g. Abraxas and KIAA0157). BRISC deficiency, created by KIAA0157 knockdown, resulted in an increased abundance of the BRCA1-RAP80 complex commensurate with increased BRCA1-RAP80 complex at damage sites. Together, these findings reveal a means by which KIAA0157 protein levels can indirectly influence ubiquitin landscapes within cellular compartments in which it is not present.

Interestingly, along with γH2AX ( 27 ), RAP80 is the second potential target of BRCC36 Lys 63 -specific DUB activity, as revealed by the presence of higher migrating forms associated with BRCC36 QSQ in comparison with BRCC36 WT. These higher forms of RAP80 were Ubc13-dependent and were also definitively identified as modified with K63-Ub by mass spectrometry. We postulate that RAP80 will be one of several Lys 63 -ubiquitinated proteins at DSBs. In line with this reasoning, RAP80 deficiency decreases BRCC36 DUB activity at DSBs and actually increases K63-Ub present at laser stripes, indicating that RAP80 itself is not responsible for the majority of the K63-Ub signal at DSBs. We propose a varied ubiquitin landscape at DSBs containing more than one major target of K63-Ub, enabling parallel signaling events to occur simultaneously during the DDR ( 30 , 48 ).

Regulation of DUB activity is therefore contained within multiple distinct elements, including protein-protein interactions and a competition between limiting components that shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Fig. 7 ). These elements also point to DUB inhibition strategies that disrupt non-catalytic domains of proteins associated with BRCC36 or Poh1 within the 19 S proteasome. Conceivably, such approaches may offer an opportunity to achieve more specific DUB inhibition among JAMM domain DUB enzymes. Furthermore, it may be possible to selectively inhibit DUB activity within the BRISC or BRCA1-RAP80 complexes, given their differential reliance on protein associations for DUB activity. Together, they suggest a multileveled regulation of DUBs that includes essential biochemical interactions and higher order assembly of protein complexes in different cellular compartments.
