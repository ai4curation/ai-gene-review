We have found a novel activity in Tetrahymena cell free extracts that adds 
tandem TTGGGG repeats onto synthetic telomere primers. The single-stranded DNA 
oligonucleotides (TTGGGG)4 and TGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGG, consisting of the 
Tetrahymena and yeast telomeric sequences respectively, each functioned as 
primers for elongation, while (CCCCAA)4 and two nontelomeric sequence DNA 
oligomers did not. Efficient synthesis of the TTGGGG repeats depended only on 
addition of micromolar concentrations of oligomer primer, dGTP, and dTTP to the 
extract. The activity was sensitive to heat and proteinase K treatment. The 
repeat addition was independent of both endogenous Tetrahymena DNA and the 
endogenous alpha-type DNA polymerase; and a greater elongation activity was 
present during macronuclear development, when a large number of telomeres are 
formed and replicated, than during vegetative cell growth. We propose that the 
novel telomere terminal transferase is involved in the addition of telomeric 
repeats necessary for the replication of chromosome ends in eukaryotes.
