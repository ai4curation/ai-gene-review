Cul-4A, which encodes a member of the cullin family subunit of ubiquitin-protein 
ligases, is expressed at abnormally high levels in many tumor cells. CUL-4A can 
physically associate with the damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB), which is 
composed of two subunits, p125 and p48. DDB binds specifically to UV-damaged DNA 
and is believed to play a role in DNA repair. We report here that CUL-4A 
stimulates degradation of p48 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, 
resulting in an overall decrease in UV-damaged DNA binding activity. The R273H 
mutant of p48 identified from a xeroderma pigmentosium (group E) patient is not 
subjected to CUL-4A-mediated proteolysis, consistent with its inability to bind 
CUL-4A. p125 is also an unstable protein, and its ubiquitination is stimulated 
by CUL-4A. However, the abundance of p125 is not dramatically altered by Cul-4A 
overexpression. UV irradiation inhibits p125 degradation, which is temporally 
coupled to the UV-induced translocation of p125 from the cytoplasm into the 
nucleus. CUL-4A is localized primarily in the cytoplasm. These findings identify 
DDB subunits as the first substrates of the CUL-4A ubiquitination machinery and 
suggest that abnormal expression of Cul-4A results in reduced p48 levels, thus 
impairing the ability of DDB in lesion recognition and DNA repair in tumor 
cells.
