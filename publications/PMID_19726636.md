A critical role of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) pathogenesis has been well established. However, the physiological function 
of APP remains elusive and much debated. We reported previously that the APP 
family of proteins is essential in mediating the developing neuromuscular 
synapse. In the current study, we created a conditional allele of APP and 
deleted APP in presynaptic motor neuron or postsynaptic muscle. Crossing these 
alleles onto the APP-like protein 2-null background reveals that, unexpectedly, 
inactivating APP in either compartment results in neuromuscular synapse defects 
similar to the germline deletion and that postsynaptic APP is obligatory for 
presynaptic targeting of the high-affinity choline transporter and synaptic 
transmission. Using a HEK293 and primary hippocampus mixed-culture assay, we 
report that expression of APP in HEK293 cells potently promotes synaptogenesis 
in contacting axons. This activity is dependent on neuronal APP and requires 
both the extracellular and intracellular domains; the latter forms a complex 
with Mint1 and Cask and is replaceable by the corresponding SynCAM (synaptic 
cell adhesion molecule) sequences. These in vitro and in vivo studies identify 
APP as a novel synaptic adhesion molecule. We postulate that transsynaptic APP 
interaction modulates its synaptic function and that perturbed APP synaptic 
adhesion activity may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and AD pathogenesis.
