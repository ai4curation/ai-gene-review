Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and N-WASP have emerged as key proteins 
connecting signalling cascades to actin polymerization. Here we show that the 
amino-terminal WH1 domain, and not the polyproline-rich region, of N-WASP is 
responsible for its recruitment to sites of actin polymerization during 
Cdc42-independent, actin-based motility of vaccinia virus. Recruitment of N-WASP 
to vaccinia is mediated by WASP-interacting protein (WIP), whereas in Shigella 
WIP is recruited by N-WASP. Our observations show that vaccinia and Shigella 
activate the Arp2/3 complex to achieve actin-based motility, by mimicking either 
the SH2/SH3-containing adaptor or Cdc42 signalling pathways to recruit the 
N-WASP-WIP complex. We propose that the N-WASP-WIP complex has a pivotal 
function in integrating signalling cascades that lead to actin polymerization.
