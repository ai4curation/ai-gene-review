Wild-type Escherichia coli lacZ was subjected to error-prone PCR to generate two 
plasmid-encoded gene libraries containing approximately 2.6 (SD 1.9) nucleotide 
exchanges resulting in 1.8 (SD 1.4) amino-acid substitutions. The libraries were 
used, along with a plasmid containing wild-type lacZ, to transform E. coli 
lacking genomic lacZ. Cells expressing functional β-galactosidase were 
identified by blue/white screening. Cell lysates containing the populations of 
heterogeneously mutagenized β-galactosidase were subjected to single molecule 
assays using a capillary electrophoresis laser-induced fluorescence-based 
protocol. There was no significant difference in the average catalytic rate 
between the random mutagenized and wild-type enzyme populations. Furthermore, 
there was no clear pattern between error rates and the variances in the 
population catalytic rates. This suggests that random sequence errors are not a 
substantial source of the catalytic heterogeneity of this enzyme.
