Two human nm23 genes have been identified, designated nm23-H1 and nm23-H2, which 
encode the 88% identical nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK) A and NDPK B 
polypeptides, respectively. The nm23-H1 gene product has been shown to play a 
functional role in the suppression of tumor metastasis. The Nm23 proteins/NDPK 
are highly conserved throughout evolution and are implicated in controlling 
cellular differentiation and development in various species, while the 
underlying mechanisms remain undefined. Neither the NDPK activity nor the 
DNA-binding activity, identified recently for NDPK B, can satisfactory explain 
the regulatory functions of Nm23. The present study provides evidence that 
purified Nm23 proteins are capable of transferring a phosphate group to other 
proteins when non-denaturing amounts of urea are present. This novel Nm23/NDPK 
activity was found to be specific for serine and threonine residues, and the 
transphosphorylation of substrate proteins occurred stoichiometrically. Because 
of the absence of a substrate turn-over, the novel function was termed protein 
phosphotransferase activity instead of protein kinase activity. It is 
demonstrated that urea stimulates the interaction of NDPK with other proteins. 
Identical phosphoprotein patterns were obtained using purified NDPK preparations 
from human, Drosophila, yeast and Dictyostelium in the presence of urea. 
Partially purified NDPK from human erythrocytes produced a similar 
phosphorylation pattern independent of urea addition and also acted 
stoichiometrically. In this preparation, a protein phosphotransferase activity 
of Nm23 species may possibly be generated and/or stabilized by the interaction 
with copurified proteins. Using different mutants of Dictyostelium NDPK it was 
shown that the protein phosphotransferase activity depends on the same active 
site as the NDPK activity. A phosphotransfer mechanism analogous to that of 
protein-histidine kinases is proposed, involving a high-energy phosphohistidine 
intermediate. Furthermore, the novel Nm23 function is compared with an 
apparently similar protein phosphotransferase activity which was observed 
previously with partially purified NDPK from different plant species.
