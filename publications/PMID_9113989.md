Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of lipid kinases that have been 
implicated in signal transduction through tyrosine kinase- and heterotrimeric 
G-protein-linked receptors. We report herein the cloning and characterization of 
p110delta, a novel class I PI3K. Like p110alpha and p110beta, other class I 
PI3Ks, p110delta displays a broad phosphoinositide lipid substrate specificity 
and interacts with SH2/SH3 domain-containing p85 adaptor proteins and with 
GTP-bound Ras. In contrast to the widely distributed p110alpha and beta, 
p110delta is exclusively found in leukocytes. In these cells, p110alpha and 
delta both associate with the p85alpha and beta adaptor subunits and are 
similarly recruited to activated signaling complexes after treatment with the 
cytokines interleukin 3 and 4 and stem cell factor. Thus, these class I PI3Ks 
appear not to be distinguishable at the level of p85 adaptor selection or 
recruitment to activated receptor complexes. However, distinct biochemical and 
structural features of p110delta suggest divergent functional/regulatory 
capacities for this PI3K. Unlike p110alpha, p110delta does not phosphorylate p85 
but instead harbors an intrinsic autophosphorylation capacity. In addition, the 
p110delta catalytic domain contains unique potential protein-protein interaction 
modules such as a Pro-rich region and a basic-region leucine-zipper (bZIP)-like 
domain. Possible selective functions of p110delta in white blood cells are 
discussed.
