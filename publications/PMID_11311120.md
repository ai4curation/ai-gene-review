Forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma (FKHR) is a transcription factor that has been 
implicated in the control of gene expression by insulin, as well as the 
regulation of apoptosis by survival factors. These signals trigger the protein 
kinase B (PKB)-catalysed phosphorylation of FKHR at three residues (Thr(24), 
Ser(256) and Ser(319)) by a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent pathway that 
results in the nuclear exit and inactivation of this transcription factor. Here, 
we have identified a conserved residue (Ser(329)) as a novel in vivo 
phosphorylation site on FKHR. Ser(329) phosphorylation also decreases the 
ability of FKHR to stimulate gene transactivation and reduces the proportion of 
FKHR present in the nucleus. However, unlike the residues targetted by PKB, 
Ser(329) is phosphorylated in unstimulated HEK-293 cells, and phosphorylation is 
not increased by stimulation with insulin-like growth factor-1 or by 
transfection with 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1. We have also 
purified a protein kinase to near homogeneity from rabbit skeletal muscle that 
phosphorylates FKHR at Ser(329) specifically and identified it as DYRK1A 
(dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A). We find that 
FKHR and DYRK1A co-localize in discrete regions of the nucleus and can be 
co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. These experiments suggest that DYRK1A 
may phosphorylate FKHR at Ser(329) in vivo.
