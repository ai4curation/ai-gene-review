Protein prenylation is believed to be catalyzed by three heterodimeric enzymes: 
FTase, GGTase1 and GGTase2. Here we report the identification of a previously 
unknown human prenyltransferase complex consisting of an orphan 
prenyltransferase α-subunit, PTAR1, and the catalytic β-subunit of GGTase2, 
RabGGTB. This enzyme, which we named GGTase3, geranylgeranylates FBXL2 to allow 
its localization at cell membranes, where this ubiquitin ligase mediates the 
polyubiquitylation of membrane-anchored proteins. In cells, FBXL2 is 
specifically recognized by GGTase3 despite having a typical carboxy-terminal 
CaaX prenylation motif that is predicted to be recognized by GGTase1. Our 
crystal structure analysis of the full-length GGTase3-FBXL2-SKP1 complex reveals 
an extensive multivalent interface specifically formed between the leucine-rich 
repeat domain of FBXL2 and PTAR1, which unmasks the structural basis of the 
substrate-enzyme specificity. By uncovering a missing prenyltransferase and its 
unique mode of substrate recognition, our findings call for a revision of the 
'prenylation code'.
