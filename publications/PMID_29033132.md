Posttranslational modification with ubiquitin chains controls cell fate in all 
eukaryotes. Depending on the connectivity between subunits, different ubiquitin 
chain types trigger distinct outputs, as seen with K48- and K63-linked 
conjugates that drive protein degradation or complex assembly, respectively. 
Recent biochemical analyses also suggested roles for mixed or branched ubiquitin 
chains, yet without a method to monitor endogenous conjugates, the physiological 
significance of heterotypic polymers remained poorly understood. Here, we 
engineered a bispecific antibody to detect K11/K48-linked chains and identified 
mitotic regulators, misfolded nascent polypeptides, and pathological Huntingtin 
variants as their endogenous substrates. We show that K11/K48-linked chains are 
synthesized and processed by essential ubiquitin ligases and effectors that are 
mutated across neurodegenerative diseases; accordingly, these conjugates promote 
rapid proteasomal clearance of aggregation-prone proteins. By revealing key 
roles of K11/K48-linked chains in cell-cycle and quality control, we establish 
heterotypic ubiquitin conjugates as important carriers of biological 
information.
