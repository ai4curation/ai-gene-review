The mammalian circadian timing system is composed of a central pacemaker in the 
suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain that synchronizes countless subsidiary 
oscillators in peripheral tissues. The rhythm-generating mechanism is thought to 
rely on a feedback loop involving positively and negatively acting transcription 
factors. BMAL1 and CLOCK activate the expression of Period (Per) and 
Cryptochrome (Cry) genes, and once PER and CRY proteins accumulate to a critical 
level they form complexes with BMAL1-CLOCK heterodimers and thereby repress the 
transcription of their own genes. Here, we show that SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent 
protein deacetylase, is required for high-magnitude circadian transcription of 
several core clock genes, including Bmal1, Rorgamma, Per2, and Cry1. SIRT1 binds 
CLOCK-BMAL1 in a circadian manner and promotes the deacetylation and degradation 
of PER2. Given the NAD(+) dependence of SIRT1 deacetylase activity, it is likely 
that SIRT1 connects cellular metabolism to the circadian core clockwork 
circuitry.
