Forkhead box class O (FOXO) proteins are transcription factors that function 
downstream of the PTEN tumor suppressor and directly control the expression of 
genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and stress responses. In 
the present study, we show that FOXO1 interacts with four and a half LIM 2 
(FHL2) in prostate cancer cells. This interaction occurred in the nucleus and 
was enhanced by lysophosphatic acid. FHL2 decreased the transcriptional activity 
of FOXO1 and the expression of known FOXO target genes and inhibited 
FOXO1-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, SIRT1, a mammalian homolog of yeast 
Sir2, bound to and deacetylated FOXO1 and inhibited its transcriptional 
activity. FHL2 enhanced the interaction of FOXO1 and SIRT1 and the deacetylation 
of FOXO1 by Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1). Overall, our data show that FHL2 inhibits FOXO1 
activity in prostate cancer cells by promoting the deacetylation of FOXO1 by 
SIRT1.
