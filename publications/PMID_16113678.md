Clusterin is an enigmatic glycoprotein that is overexpressed in several human 
cancers such as prostate and breast cancers, and squamous cell carcinoma. 
Because the suppression of clusterin expression renders human cancer cells 
sensitive to chemotherapeutic drug-mediated apoptosis, it is currently an 
antisense target in clinical trials for prostate cancer. However, the molecular 
mechanisms by which clusterin inhibits apoptosis in human cancer cells are 
unknown. Here we report that intracellular clusterin inhibits apoptosis by 
interfering with Bax activation in mitochondria. Intriguingly, in contrast to 
other inhibitors of Bax, clusterin specifically interacts with 
conformation-altered Bax in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. This interaction 
impedes Bax oligomerization, which leads to the release of cytochrome c from 
mitochondria and caspase activation. Moreover, we also find that clusterin 
inhibits oncogenic c-Myc-mediated apoptosis by interacting with 
conformation-altered Bax. Clusterin promotes c-Myc-mediated transformation in 
vitro and tumour progression in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that 
the elevated level of clusterin in human cancers may promote oncogenic 
transformation and tumour progression by interfering with Bax pro-apoptotic 
activities.
