We recently reported the molecular cloning of a cytotoxic granule-associated 
RNA-binding protein designated TIA-1. The ability of recombinant TIA-1 to induce 
DNA fragmentation in permeabilized cells suggested that this protein is the 
granule component responsible for inducing apoptosis in cytolytic lymphocyte 
(CTL) targets. Here we report the characterization of a cDNA encoding a 
TIA-1-related protein designated TIAR. The deduced amino acid sequence of TIAR 
reveals it to be a 42-kDa protein possessing three RNA-binding domains and a 
carboxyl-terminal auxiliary domain. Although the RNA-binding domains of TIA-1 
and TIAR share greater than 85% amino acid homology, their carboxyl-terminal 
auxiliary domains are only 51% homologous. The carboxyl terminus of TIAR 
contains a lysosome-targeting motif, indicating that TIAR is probably a 
cytotoxic granule-associated protein. Like TIA-1, purified recombinant TIAR 
induced DNA fragmentation in permeabilized target cells. Although immunoblotting 
analysis of post-nuclear supernatants revealed TIA-1 protein to be restricted to 
CTLs, PCR analysis revealed the expression of TIA-1 and TIAR mRNA transcripts in 
a wide variety of cell types. Our data suggest that the granules of CTLs contain 
at least two candidate nucleolysins involved in CTL killing.
