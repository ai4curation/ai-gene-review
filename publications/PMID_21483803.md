Although ARS-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2, also named as MSC 
p38) was first found as a component for a macromolecular tRNA synthetase 
complex, it was recently discovered to dissociate from the complex and work as a 
potent tumor suppressor. Upon DNA damage, AIMP2 promotes apoptosis through the 
protective interaction with p53. However, it was not demonstrated whether AIMP2 
was indeed pathologically linked to human cancer. In this work, we found that a 
splicing variant of AIMP2 lacking exon 2 (AIMP2-DX2) is highly expressed by 
alternative splicing in human lung cancer cells and patient's tissues. AIMP2-DX2 
compromised pro-apoptotic activity of normal AIMP2 through the competitive 
binding to p53. The cells with higher level of AIMP2-DX2 showed higher 
propensity to form anchorage-independent colonies and increased resistance to 
cell death. Mice constitutively expressing this variant showed increased 
susceptibility to carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis. The expression ratio of 
AIMP2-DX2 to normal AIMP2 was increased according to lung cancer stage and 
showed a positive correlation with the survival of patients. Thus, this work 
identified an oncogenic splicing variant of a tumor suppressor, AIMP2/p38, and 
suggests its potential for anti-cancer target.
