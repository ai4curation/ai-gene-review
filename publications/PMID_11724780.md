Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a new transcription 
factor that binds to the carbohydrate-responsive element of the l-type pyruvate 
kinase gene (l-PK). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by 
which feeding high fat diets results in decreased activity of ChREBP in the 
liver (Yamashita, H., Takenoshita, M., Sakurai, M., Bruick, R. K., Henzel, W. 
J., Shillinglaw, W., Arnot, D., and Uyeda, K. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 
U.S.A. 98, 9116-9121). We cloned the rat liver ChREBP gene for use throughout 
this study. Acetate, octanoate, and palmitate inhibited the glucose-induced 
activation of l-PK transcription in ChREBP-overexpressed hepatocytes. In these 
hepatocytes, the cytosolic AMP concentration increased 30-fold and AMP-activated 
protein kinase activity was activated 2-fold. Similarly to the fatty acids, 
5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribotide, a specific activator of AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) also inhibited the l-PK transcription activity in 
ChREBP-overexpressed hepatocytes. Using as a substrate a truncated ChREBP 
consisting of the C-terminal region, we demonstrated that phosphorylation by 
AMPK resulted in inactivation of the DNA binding activity. AMPK specifically 
phosphorylated Ser(568) of ChREBP. A S568A mutant of the ChREBP gene showed 
tight DNA binding and lost its fatty acid sensitivity, whereas a S568D mutant 
showed weak DNA binding and inhibited l-PK transcription activity even in the 
absence of fatty acid. These results strongly suggested that the fatty acid 
inhibition of glucose-induced l-PK transcription resulted from AMPK 
phosphorylation of ChREBP at Ser(568), which inactivated the DNA binding 
activity. AMPK was activated by the increased AMP that was generated by the 
fatty acid activation.
