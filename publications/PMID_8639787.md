Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 exert similar, nonadditive effects on endothelial 
cells, inducing vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression and 
subsequent transmigration of eosinophils. The receptor for IL-4 and IL-13 was 
described as a shared heteromultimeric complex in which the common gamma-chain 
(gamma c) subunit was essential for activity. Endothelial cell bound both 
cytokines with high affinity; by flow cytofluorometry and reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), they expressed IL-4 receptor 
alpha (IL-4R alpha) but did not express the gamma c of the IL-2R. Radioligand 
cross-linking experiments followed by immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal 
antibody (MoAb) S697 to the IL-4R alpha showed IL-4-specific binding at 130 kD, 
the IL-4R alpha, and to a minor extent to a double band coimmunoprecipitated at 
65 to 75 kD. [125 I]IL-13 bound predominantly to the 65- to 75- kD band and with 
a trace amount of binding at 130 kD. However, no ligand-cross-linked receptor 
was precipitated by the MoAb S697, indicating a cognate novel IL-13-binding 
subunit. Excess unlabeled IL-4 completely displaced IL-13 binding. Similarly, 
nonsignaling IL-4 (Y124D)-mutant abolished IL-4- and IL-13-mediated signal 
transduction. Unlabeled IL-13 competed successfully for IL-4 binding at 65 to 75 
kD but was unable to completely displace Il-4 from its binding to the IL-4R 
alpha. The MoAb TUGh4, specific for the gamma c, failed to precipitate 
ligand-cross-linked IL-4R and IL-13R. Therefore, the subunit structure of the 
functional receptors for IL-4 and IL-13 on human endothelial cells does not use 
or require the common gamma c of the IL-2R.
