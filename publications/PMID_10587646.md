Organismal size is determined by a tightly regulated mechanism that coordinates 
cell growth, cell proliferation and cell death. The Drosophila insulin 
receptor/Chico/Dp110 pathway regulates cell and organismal size. Here we show 
that genetic manipulation of the phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase-dependent 
serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B) during development of the 
Drosophila imaginal disc affects cell and organ size in an autonomous manner. 
Ectopic expression of Akt does not affect cell-fate determination, apoptosis or 
proliferation rates in imaginal discs. Thus, Akt appears to stimulate 
intracellular pathways that specifically regulate cell and compartment size 
independently of cell proliferation in vivo.
