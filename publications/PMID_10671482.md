We have identified Cox20p, a 23.8-kDa protein of the mitochondrial inner 
membrane that is involved in the biogenesis of the yeast cytochrome oxidase 
complex. Cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (Cox2p) accumulates as a precursor in 
cox20 mutants, suggesting a defect in biogenesis of this mitochondrially encoded 
protein. The inability of cox20 mutants to process the subunit 2 precursor 
(pCox2p) is not due to impaired export of the protein across the inner membrane 
or to an inactive Imp1p/Imp2p peptidase. Rather, Cox20p specifically binds the 
newly synthesized pCox2p, a step required to present the exported pCox2p as a 
substrate to the Imp1p peptidase. All of the endogenous pCox2p accumulated in an 
Deltaimp1 mutant, and a small fraction of Cox2p in wild type yeast, is detected 
in a complex with Cox20p. Following maturation Cox2p remained associated with 
Cox20p, prior to assembling into the cytochrome oxidase complex. We propose that 
Cox20p acts as a membrane-bound chaperone necessary for cleavage of pCox2p and 
for interaction of the mature protein with other subunits of cytochrome oxidase 
in a later step of the assembly process.
