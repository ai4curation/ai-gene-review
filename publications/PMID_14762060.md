Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoidesSC (MmymySC)is the etiological agent of 
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), a highly contagious respiratory 
disease in cattle. The genome of Mmymy SC type strain PG1(T) has been sequenced 
to map all the genes and to facilitate further studies regarding the cell 
function of the organism and CBPP. The genome is characterized by a single 
circular chromosome of 1211703 bp with the lowest G+C content (24 mole%)and the 
highest density of insertion sequences (13% of the genome size)of all sequenced 
bacterial genomes. The genome contains 985 putative genes, of which 72 are part 
of insertion sequences and encode transposases. Anomalies in the GC-skew pattern 
and the presence of large repetitive sequences indicate a high genomic 
plasticity. A variety of potential virulence factors was identified, including 
genes encoding putative variable surface proteins and enzymes and transport 
proteins responsible for the production of hydrogen peroxide and the capsule, 
which is believed to have toxic effects on the animal.
