Chaperonins GroEL and GroES form, in the presence of ATP, two types of 
heterooligomers in solution: an asymmetric GroEL14GroES7 "bullet"-shaped 
particle and a symmetric GroEL14(GroES7)2 "football"-shaped particle. Under 
limiting concentrations of ATP or GroES, excess ADP, or in the presence of 
5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate, a correlation is seen between protein folding and 
the amount of symmetric GroEL14(GroES7)2 particles in a chaperonin solution, as 
detected by electron microscopy or by chemical crosslinking. Kinetic analysis 
suggests that protein folding is more efficient when carried out by a chaperonin 
solution populated with a majority of symmetric GroEL14(GroES7)2 particles than 
by a majority of asymmetric GroEL14GroES7 particles. The symmetric 
heterooligomer behaves as a highly efficient intermediate of the chaperonin 
protein folding cycle in vitro.
