Accumulating evidence suggests that protein-protein interactions play an 
important role in transepithelial ion transport. In the present study, we report 
on the biochemical and functional association between cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and a PDZ domain-containing protein 
Shank2. Exploratory reverse transcription-PCR screening revealed mRNAs for 
several members of PDZ domain-containing proteins in epithelial cells. Shank2, 
one of these scaffolding proteins, showed a strong interaction with CFTR by 
yeast two-hybrid assays. Shank2-CFTR interaction was verified by 
co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells. Notably, this interaction 
was abolished by mutations in the PDZ domain of Shank2. Protein phosphorylation, 
HCO(3)(-) transport and Cl(-) current by CFTR were measured in NIH 3T3 cells 
with heterologous expression of Shank2. Of interest, expression of Shank2 
suppressed cAMP-induced phosphorylation and activation of CFTR. Importantly, 
loss of Shank2 by stable transfection of antisense-hShank2 plasmid strongly 
increased CFTR currents in colonic T84 cells, in which CFTR and Shank2 were 
natively expressed. Our results indicate that Shank2 negatively regulates CFTR 
and that this may play a significant role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis 
under normal and diseased conditions such as those presented by secretory 
diarrhea.
