The BCR consists of surface-bound Ig and a heterodimeric signaling unit 
comprised of CD79A and CD79B. Upon cognate Ag recognition, the receptor 
initiates important signals for B cell development and function. The receptor 
also conveys Ag-independent survival signals termed tonic signaling. Although 
the requirement of a CD79A/CD79B heterodimer for BCR complex assembly and 
surface expression is well established based on mice models, few studies have 
investigated this in human mature B cells. In this study, we found that human 
tonsillar B cells with high surface expression of IgM or IgG had potentiated BCR 
signaling compared with BCRlow cells, and high IgM expression in germinal center 
B cells was associated with reduced apoptosis. We explored the mechanism for IgM 
surface expression by CRISPR/Cas9-induced deletion of CD79A or CD79B in four B 
lymphoma cell lines. Deletion of either CD79 protein caused loss of surface IgM 
in all cell lines and reduced fitness in three. From two cell lines, we 
generated stable CD79A or CD79B knockout clones and demonstrated that loss of 
CD79A or CD79B caused a block in N-glycan maturation and accumulation of 
immature proteins, compatible with retention of BCR components in the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Rescue experiments with CD79B wild-type restored surface 
expression of CD79A and IgM with mature glycosylation, whereas a naturally 
occurring CD79B G137S mutant disrupting CD79A/CD79B heterodimerization did not. 
Our study highlights that CD79A and CD79B are required for surface IgM 
expression in human B cells and illuminates the importance of the IgM expression 
level for signaling and fitness.
