Dysfunction of keratinocytes affects diabetic wound healing, but underlying 
mechanisms have not been understood. This study examines crotonylation's role in 
ferroptosis and autophagy in keratinocytes, particularly regarding ACSL4, using 
STZ-induced diabetic rats and high glucose-exposed keratinocytes to assess these 
processes. The ACSL4 knockdown was achieved using adenovirus in wounds to 
examine the impact of ferroptosis modulation on healing diabetic wounds. MB-3 
was utilized to block the H3K27 crotonylation (H3K27cr) in order to clarify the 
regulatory function of crotonylation in both autophagy and ferroptosis. In 
STZ-induced diabetic skin and high glucose-exposed keratinocytes, ferroptosis 
mediated by ACSL4 and suppression of autophagic flux were demonstrated. 
Moreover, the downregulation of ACSL4 triggered ferroptosis in adjacent wounds 
of diabetic rats and improved wound healing. The degradation of ACSL4 may be 
observed via the autophagy-lysosome pathway in keratinocytes. Downregulation of 
SQSTM1 in diabetic keratinocytes leads to autophagy inhibition and modulates the 
protein level of ACSL4. Mechanistically, total crotonylation levels and H3K27cr 
were remarkably elevated in the skin and keratinocytes of diabetic rats; 
blocking high glucose-induced H3K27cr with MB-3 can enhance SQSTM1 transcription 
and expression while promoting autophagy and reducing ACSL4-induced ferroptosis 
in keratinocytes. Therefore, H3K27cr influences autophagy by adjusting SQSTM1 to 
facilitate ACSL4-triggered ferroptosis in diabetic keratinocytes. This study 
clarifies the relationships between acylation modifications, autophagy, and 
ferroptosis, while also offering mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic 
targets for issues associated with diabetic wound healing.
