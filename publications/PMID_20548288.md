The importance of dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression in nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) has been increasingly recognized; however, the 
association between altered expression of miRNAs and pathophysiological features 
of NASH and whether there is a connection between susceptibility to NASH and 
altered expression of miRNAs are largely unknown. In this study, male inbred 
C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice were fed a lipogenic methyl-deficient diet that causes 
liver injury similar to human NASH, and the expression of miRNAs and the level 
of proteins targeted by these miRNAs in the livers were determined. 
Administration of the methyl-deficient diet triggered NASH-specific changes in 
the livers of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, with the magnitude being more severe in 
DBA/2J mice. This was evidenced by a greater extent of expression of 
fibrosis-related genes in the livers of methyl-deficient DBA/2J mice. The 
development of NASH was accompanied by prominent changes in the expression of 
miRNAs, including miR-29c, miR-34a, miR-155, and miR-200b. Interestingly, 
changes in the expression of these miRNAs and protein levels of their targets, 
including Cebp-β, Socs 1, Zeb-1, and E-cadherin, in the livers of DBA/2J mice 
fed a methyl-deficient diet were more pronounced as compared with those in 
C57BL/6J mice. These results show that alterations in the expression of miRNAs 
are a prominent event during development of NASH induced by methyl deficiency 
and strongly suggest that severity of NASH and susceptibility to NASH may be 
determined by variations in miRNA expression response. More important, our data 
provide a mechanistic link between alterations in miRNA expression and 
pathophysiological and pathomorphological features of NASH.
