Meiotic crossover formation involves the repair of programmed DNA double-strand 
breaks (DSBs) and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. Completion of these 
processes must precede the meiotic divisions in order to avoid chromosome 
abnormalities in gametes. Enduring key questions in meiosis have been how 
meiotic progression and crossover formation are coordinated, whether 
inappropriate asynapsis is monitored, and whether asynapsis elicits prophase 
arrest via mechanisms that are distinct from the surveillance of unrepaired DNA 
DSBs. We disrupted the meiosis-specific mouse HORMAD2 (Hop1, Rev7, and Mad2 
domain 2) protein, which preferentially associates with unsynapsed chromosome 
axes. We show that HORMAD2 is required for the accumulation of the checkpoint 
kinase ATR along unsynapsed axes, but not at DNA DSBs or on DNA DSB-associated 
chromatin loops. Consistent with the hypothesis that ATR activity on chromatin 
plays important roles in the quality control of meiotic prophase, HORMAD2 is 
required for the elimination of the asynaptic Spo11(-/-), but not the asynaptic 
and DSB repair-defective Dmc1(-/-) oocytes. Our observations strongly suggest 
that HORMAD2-dependent recruitment of ATR to unsynapsed chromosome axes 
constitutes a mechanism for the surveillance of asynapsis. Thus, we provide 
convincing evidence for the existence of a distinct asynapsis surveillance 
mechanism that safeguards the ploidy of the mammalian germline.
