Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown at physiological temperature 24 degrees C 
require preconditioning at 37 degrees C to acquire tolerance towards brief 
exposure to 48-50 degrees C. During preconditioning, the cytosolic trehalose 
content increases remarkably and in the absence of trehalose synthesis yeast 
cannot acquire thermotolerance. It has been speculated that trehalose protects 
proteins and membranes under environmental stress conditions, but recently it 
was shown to assist the Hsp104 chaperone in refolding of heat-damaged proteins 
in the yeast cytosol. We have demonstrated that heat-denatured proteins residing 
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) also can be refolded once the cells are 
returned to physiological temperature. Unexpectedly, not only ER chaperones but 
also the cytosolic Hsp104 chaperone is required for conformational repair events 
in the ER lumen. Here we show that trehalose facilitates refolding of 
glycoproteins in the ER after severe heat stress. In the absence of Tps1p, a 
subunit of trehalose synthase, refolding of heat-damaged glycoproteins to 
bioactive and secretion-competent forms failed or was retarded. In contrast, 
membrane traffic operated many hours after severe heat stress even in the 
absence of the TPS1 gene, demonstrating that trehalose had no role in 
thermoprotection of membranes engaged in vesicular traffic. However, cytosolic 
proteins were aggregated and protein synthesis abolished, resulting finally in 
cell death.
