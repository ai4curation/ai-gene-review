We recently reported that a transcriptional repressor, neuron-restrictive 
silencer factor (NRSF), represses expression of fetal cardiac genes, including 
atrial and brain natriuretic peptide (ANP and BNP), by recruiting class I 
histone deacetylase (HDAC) and that attenuation of NRSF-mediated repression 
contributes to the reactivation of fetal gene expression during cardiac 
hypertrophy. The molecular mechanism by which the activity of the NRSF-HDAC 
complex is inhibited in cardiac hypertrophy remains unresolved, however. In the 
present study, we show that class II HDACs (HDAC4 and 5), which are 
Ca/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK)-responsive repressors of hypertrophic 
signaling, associate with NRSF and participate in NRSF-mediated repression. 
Blockade of the CaMK-class II HDAC signaling pathway using a CaMK-resistant 
HDAC5 mutant, a CaMK inhibitor (KN62) or a dominant-negative CaMK mutant 
inhibited ET-1-inducible ANP and BNP promoter activity, but that inhibitory 
effect was abolished by mutation of the neuron-restrictive silencer element 
(NRSE) within the ANP and BNP promoter. In addition, adenovirus-mediated 
expression of a dominant-negative NRSF mutant abolished the inhibitory effect of 
KN62 on ET-1-inducible endogenous ANP gene expression in ventricular myocytes. 
Finally, the interaction between NRSF and class II HDACs was decreased in both 
in vitro and in vivo models of cardiac hypertrophy. These findings show that 
ET-1-induced CaMK signaling disrupts class II HDAC-NRSF repressor complexes, 
thereby enabling activation of ANP and BNP gene transcription in ventricular 
myocytes, and shed light on a novel mechanism by which the fetal cardiac gene 
program is reactivated.
