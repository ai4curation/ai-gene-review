Signaling through the kinase Akt regulates many biological functions. Akt is 
activated during growth factor stimulation through a process that requires 
binding of Akt to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)), which 
promotes membrane localization and phosphorylation of Akt by the upstream kinase 
PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1). We show that Akt and PDK1 
are acetylated at lysine residues in their pleckstrin homology domains, which 
mediate PIP(3) binding. Acetylation blocked binding of Akt and PDK1 to PIP(3), 
thereby preventing membrane localization and phosphorylation of Akt. 
Deacetylation by SIRT1 enhanced binding of Akt and PDK1 to PIP(3) and promoted 
their activation. Mice injected with cells expressing a mutant that mimicked a 
constitutively acetylated form of Akt developed smaller tumors than those 
injected with cells expressing wild-type Akt. Furthermore, impaired Akt 
activation in the hearts of SIRT1-deficient mice was associated with reduced 
cardiac hypertrophy in response to physical exercise and angiotensin II. These 
findings uncover a key posttranslational modification of Akt that is important 
for its oncogenic and hypertrophic activities.
