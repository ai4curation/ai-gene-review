We have previously shown that the yeast SWI/SNF complex stimulates in vitro 
transcription from chromatin templates in an ATP-dependent manner. SWI/SNF 
function in this regard requires the presence of an activator with which it can 
interact directly, linking activator recruitment of SWI/SNF to transcriptional 
stimulation. In this study, we determine the SWI/SNF subunits that mediate its 
interaction with activators. Using a photo-cross-linking label transfer 
strategy, we show that the Snf5, Swi1, and Swi2/Snf2 subunits are contacted by 
the yeast acidic activators, Gcn4 and Hap4, in the context of the intact native 
SWI/SNF complex. In addition, we show that the same three subunits can interact 
individually with acidic activation domains, indicating that each subunit 
contributes to binding activators. Furthermore, mutations that reduce the 
activation potential of these activators also diminish its interaction with each 
of these SWI/SNF subunits. Thus, three distinct subunits of the SWI/SNF complex 
contribute to its interactions with activation domains.
