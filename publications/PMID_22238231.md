A proline-rich region (PRR) within the rubella virus (RUBV) P150 replicase 
protein that contains three SH3 domain-binding motifs (PxxPxR) was investigated 
for its ability to bind cell proteins. Pull-down experiments using a glutathione 
S-transferase-PRR fusion revealed PxxPxR motif-specific binding with human p32 
protein (gC1qR), which could be mediated by either of the first two motifs. This 
finding was of interest because p32 protein also binds to the RUBV capsid 
protein. Binding of p32 to P150 was confirmed and was abolished by mutation of 
the first two motifs. When mutations in the first two motifs were introduced 
into a RUBV cDNA infectious clone, virus replication was significantly impaired. 
However, virus RNA synthesis was found to be unaffected, and subsequent 
immunofluorescence analysis of RUBV-infected cells revealed co-localization of 
p32 and P150 but little overlap of p32 with RNA replication complexes, 
indicating that p32 does not participate directly in virus RNA synthesis. Thus, 
the role of p32 in RUBV replication remains unresolved.
