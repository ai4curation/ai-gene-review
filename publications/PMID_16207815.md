Though posttranscriptional regulation is important for early embryogenesis, 
little is understood regarding control of mRNA decay during development. 
Previous work defined two major pathways by which normal transcripts are 
degraded in eukaryotes. However it is not known which pathways are key in mRNA 
decay during early patterning or whether developmental transcripts are turned 
over via specific pathways. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans Dcp2 is 
localized to distinct foci during embryogenesis, reminiscent of P-bodies, the 
sites of mRNA degradation in yeast and mammals. However the decapping enzyme of 
the 3' to 5' transcript decay system (DcpS) localizes throughout the cytoplasm, 
suggesting this degradation pathway is not highly organized. In addition we find 
that Dcp2 is localized to P-granules, showing that Dcp2 is stored and/or active 
in these structures. However RNAi of these decapping enzymes has no obvious 
effect on embryogenesis. In contrast we find that nuclear cap binding proteins 
(CBP-20 and 80), eIF4G, and PAB-1 are absolutely required for development. 
Together our data provides further evidence that pathways of general mRNA 
metabolism can be remarkably organized during development, with two different 
decapping enzymes localized in distinct cytoplasmic domains.
