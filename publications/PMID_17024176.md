Heat shock response is an adoptive response to proteotoxic stress, and a major 
heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) has been believed to protect cells from 
cell death by inducing heat shock proteins (Hsps) that assist protein folding 
and prevent protein denaturation. However, it is revealed recently that HSF1 
also promotes cell death of male germ cells. Here, we found a proapoptotic 
Tdag51 (T-cell death associated gene 51) gene as a direct target gene of HSF1. 
Heat shock and other stresses induced different levels of Hsps and Tdag51, which 
depend on cell types. Hsps bound directly to the N-terminal pleckstrin-homology 
like (PHL) domain of Tdag51, and suppressed death activity of the C-terminal 
proline/glutamine/histidine-rich domain. Tdag51, but not major Hsps, were 
induced in male germ cells exposed to high temperatures. Analysis of Tdag51-null 
testes showed that Tdag51 played substantial roles in promoting heat 
shock-induced cell death in vivo. These data suggest that cell fate on 
proteotoxic condition is determined at least by balance between Hsp and Tdag51 
levels, which are differently regulated by HSF1.
