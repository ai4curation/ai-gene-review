Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a complex kinase and mutations in LRRK2 
are perhaps the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, 
the identification of the normal physiological function of LRRK2 remains 
elusive. Here, we show that LRRK2 protects neurons against apoptosis induced by 
the Drosophila genes grim, hid and reaper. Genetic dissection reveals that Akt 
is the critical downstream kinase of LRRK2 that phosphorylates and inhibits 
FOXO1, and thereby promotes survival. Like human LRRK2, Drosophila lrrk also 
promotes neuron survival; lrrk loss-of-function mutant displays reduced cell 
numbers, which can be rescued by LRRK2 expression. Importantly, LRRK2 G2019S and 
LRRK2 R1441C mutants impair the ability of LRRK2 to activate Akt, and fail to 
prevent apoptotic death. Ectopic expression of a constitutive active form of Akt 
hence is sufficient to rescue this functional deficit. These data establish that 
LRRK2 can protect neurons from apoptotic insult through a survival pathway in 
which LRRK2 signals to activate Akt, and then inhibits FOXO1. These results 
might indicate that a LRRK-Akt therapeutic pathway to promote neuron survival 
and to prevent neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.
