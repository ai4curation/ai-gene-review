The actin-binding protein Shroom is essential for neural tube morphogenesis in 
multiple vertebrate organisms, indicating its function is evolutionarily 
conserved. Shroom facilitates neurulation by regulating the morphology of 
neurepithelial cells. Shroom localizes to the apical tip of adherens junctions 
of neural ectoderm cells in vivo and to the apical junctional complex (AJC) in 
MDCK cells. Induced expression of Shroom in polarized epithelia elicits apical 
constriction and dramatic reorganization of the apical arrangement and packing 
of cells without altering apical-basal polarity. These events likely mimic the 
cell shape changes and cellular movements required for neurulation in vivo. The 
observed phenotypes depend on the ability of Shroom to alter F-actin 
distribution and regulate the formation of a previously uncharacterized 
contractile actomyosin network associated with the AJC. Targeting the C-terminal 
domain of Shroom to the apical plasma membrane elicits constriction and 
reorganization of the actomyosin network, indicting that this domain mediates 
Shroom's activity. In vivo, Shroom-mutant neural epithelia show a marked 
reduction in apically positioned myosin. Thus, Shroom likely facilitates neural 
tube closure by regulating cell shape changes via the apical positioning of an 
actomyosin network in the neurepithelium.
