A number of chemotherapeutic agents which inhibit the DNA topoisomerases 
markedly potentiate cell death mediated by tumor necrosis factor, suggesting a 
role for these enzymes in the TNF cytotoxic mechanism. To investigate this 
possibility, topoisomerase I and II activities were assayed following TNF 
addition to murine L929 cells. Topoisomerase I and II activities increased 
within 15 min of TNF addition and returned to baseline levels within 1 and 2 hr, 
respectively. The increases in both topoisomerase activities were blocked by H-7 
(but not H-8) and similar increases were seen following PMA addition. However, 
concentrations of H-7 which blocked the increased topoisomerase activities had 
no effect on TNF cytotoxicity nor on the enhancement of TNF cytotoxicity by 
topoisomerase inhibitors. Thus, in these cells topoisomerase activities are 
directly modified by TNF during the initial phases of a cytotoxic response. 
However, neither TNF cytotoxicity nor the enhancement of TNF cytotoxicity by 
topoisomerase inhibitors appears to require the TNF-mediated increases in 
topoisomerase activities.
