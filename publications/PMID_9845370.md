A new rhythm mutation was isolated based on its elimination of per-controlled 
luciferase cycling. Levels of period or timeless clock gene products in the 
mutant are flat in daily light-dark cycles or constant darkness (although PER 
and TIM oscillate normally in temperature cycles). Consistent with the fact that 
light normally suppresses TIM, cryb is an apparent null mutation in a gene 
encoding Drosophila's version of the blue light receptor cryptochrome. 
Behaviorally, cryb exhibits poor synchronization to light-dark cycles in genetic 
backgrounds that cause external blindness or demand several hours of daily 
rhythm resets, and it shows no response to brief light pulses. cryb flies are 
rhythmic in constant darkness, correlating with robust PER and TIM cycling in 
certain pacemaker neurons.
