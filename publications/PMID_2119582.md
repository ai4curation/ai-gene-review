Transforming growth factors beta (TGF beta) are multifunctional polypeptides 
that participate in regulation of growth, differentiation and function of many 
cell types. The mature TGF beta molecule is a 25 kDa protein composed of two 
12.5 kDa monomers linked by disulfide bonds. Human glioblastoma cells secrete 
biologically active TGF beta 2. Here we report that in addition to the free form 
of TGF beta 2, a stable complex between a approximately 110 kDa binding protein 
and TGF beta 2 was isolated from glioblastoma cell supernatant. This binding 
protein was purified and was found to show sequence identity to part of the beta 
amyloid precursor protein (beta APP), to be specifically labeled by several 
different antisera to beta APP, and to be affinity labeled with TGF beta by 
crosslinking. The complex formation between TGF beta and beta APP may have 
important implications in regulation of biological activity of the two proteins 
and in delivery or clearance of TGF beta and beta APP in the brain and other 
compartments.
