Autophosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases provides binding sites for 
signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. We determined the 
binding sites of Shc, SH2-containing adaptor protein, within epidermal growth 
factor (EGF) receptors, using Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing EGF 
receptor mutants in which autophosphorylation sites, either alone or in 
combination, were replaced by phenylalanine. Binding of Shc to EGF receptor 
mutants lacking single tyrosine residues at 1148 or 1173 decreased by 
approximately 60 or approximately 15%, respectively, whereas other single point 
mutants bound the wild-type level of Shc. Binding of Shc markedly decreased in 
mutants lacking both tyrosine residues at 1148 and 1173. In peptide inhibition 
assay, phosphorylated nonameric peptide representing tyrosine 1148, DNPDpYQQDF, 
but not pentameric peptide, pYQQDF, inhibited the binding of glutathione 
S-transferase-Shc SH2 domain fusion protein to in vitro autophosphorylated EGF 
receptors, suggesting that N-terminal sequences adjacent to phosphotyrosine are 
necessary for the association of Shc. Based on results of peptide inhibition 
assays in which phosphorylated peptides representing tyrosines 992, 1148, and 
1173 inhibited Shc binding to the receptor, we constructed another EGF receptor 
mutant in which one of these tyrosine residues was retained. The amount of Shc 
bound to mutant receptors retaining tyrosines 1148, 1173, or 992 was 
approximately 80, approximately 40, or approximately 10% of wild-type level, 
respectively. These results indicate that tyrosine 1148 of activated human EGF 
receptors is a major binding site of Shc and tyrosine 1173 is a secondary 
binding site in intact cells.
