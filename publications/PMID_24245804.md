Viperin is an interferon-induced protein with a broad antiviral activity. This 
evolutionary conserved protein contains a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) 
domain which has been shown in vitro to hold a [4Fe-4S] cluster. We identified 
tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) as a novel target for which human viperin 
inhibits productionof the viral genome RNA. Wt viperin was found to require ER 
localization for full antiviral activity and to interact with the cytosolic Fe/S 
protein assembly factor CIAO1. Radiolabelling in vivo revealed incorporation of 
(55) Fe, indicative for the presence of an Fe-S cluster. Mutation of the 
cysteine residues ligating the Fe-S cluster in the central radical SAM domain 
entirely abolished both antiviral activity and incorporation of (55) Fe. Mutants 
lacking the extreme C-terminal W361 did not interact with CIAO1, were not 
matured, and were antivirally inactive. Moreover, intracellular removal of SAM 
by ectopic expression of the bacteriophage T3 SAMase abolished antiviral 
activity. Collectively, our data suggest that viperin requires CIAO1 for 
[4Fe-4S] cluster assembly, and acts through an enzymatic, Fe-S cluster- and 
SAM-dependent mechanism to inhibit viral RNA synthesis.
