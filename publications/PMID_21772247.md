The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) restrains anaphase until all chromosomes 
become bi-oriented on the mitotic spindle. The SAC protein Mad2 can fold into 
two distinct conformers, open (O) and closed (C), and can asymmetrically 
dimerize. Here, we describe a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes 
the dimerization interface of C-Mad2. This antibody revealed several 
conformation-specific features of Mad2 in human cells. Notably, we show that 
Mad2 requires association with Mad1 to adopt the closed conformation and that 
the activity of the Mad1:C-Mad2 complex undergoes regulation by 
p31comet-dependent 'capping'. Furthermore, C-Mad2 antibody microinjection caused 
an abrupt termination of the SAC and accelerated mitotic progression. 
Remarkably, microinjection of a Mad1-neutralizing antibody triggered a 
comparable mitotic acceleration. Our study provides direct in vivo evidence for 
the model that a kinetochore complex of Mad1:C-Mad2 acts as a template to 
sustain the SAC and it challenges the distinction between SAC and mitotic timer.
