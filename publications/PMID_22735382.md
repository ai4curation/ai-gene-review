Achievement of long-term survival of patients with lung cancer treated with 
conventional chemotherapy is still difficult for treatment of metastatic and 
advanced tumors. Despite recent progress in investigational therapies, survival 
rates are still disappointingly low and novel adjuvant and systemic therapies 
are urgently needed. A recently elucidated secretory pathway is attracting 
considerable interest as a promising anticancer target. The cis-Golgi matrix 
protein, GOLGA2/GM130, plays an important role in glycosylation and transport of 
protein in the secretory pathway. In this study, the effects of short hairpin 
RNA (shRNA) constructs targeting GOLGA2/GM130 (shGOLGA2) on autophagy and lung 
cancer growth were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Downregulation of 
GOLGA2/GM130 led to induction of autophagy and inhibition of glycosylation in 
A549 cells and in the lungs of K-ras(LA1) mice. Furthermore, downregulation of 
GOLGA2/GM130 decreased angiogenesis and cancer cell invasion in vitro and 
suppressed tumorigenesis in lung cancer mice model. The tumor specificity of 
sequence targeting GOLGA2/GM130 was also demonstrated. Taken together, these 
results suggest that induction of autophagy by shGOLGA2 may induce cell death 
rather than cell survival. Therefore, downregulation of GOLGA2/GM130 may be a 
potential therapeutic option for lung cancer.
