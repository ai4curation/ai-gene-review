Proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells contributes to atherogenesis and 
neointima formation. Sublytic activation of complement, particularly C5b-9, 
induces cell cycle progression in aortic smooth muscle cells. RGC-32 is a novel 
protein that may promote cell cycle progression in response to complement 
activation. We cloned human RGC-32 cDNA from a human fetal brain cDNA library. 
The human RGC-32 cDNA encodes a 117-amino acid protein with 92% similarity to 
the rat and mouse protein. Human RGC-32 maps to chromosome 13 and is expressed 
in most tissues. Sublytic complement activation enhanced RGC-32 mRNA expression 
in human aortic smooth muscle cells and induced nuclear translocation of the 
protein. RGC-32 was physically associated with cyclin-dependent kinase p34CDC2 
and increased the kinase activity in vivo and in vitro. In addition, RGC-32 was 
phosphorylated by p34CDC2-cyclin B1 in vitro. Mutation of RGC-32 protein at 
Thr-91 prevented the p34CDC2-mediated phosphorylation and resulted in loss of 
p34CDC2 kinase enhancing activity. Overexpression of RGC-32 induced quiescent 
aortic smooth muscle cells to enter S-phase. These data indicate that cell cycle 
activation by C5b-9 may involve p34CDC2 activity through RGC-32. RGC-32 appears 
to be a cell cycle regulatory factor that mediates cell proliferation, both as 
an activator and substrate of p34CDC2.
