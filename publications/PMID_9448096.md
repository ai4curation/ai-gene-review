To investigate the role of constitutive hsp70 in protein folding and to probe 
the supplementation by other hsps in this folding, yeast cells expressing 
reduced constitutive hsp70 proteins, ssa1ssa2, were transformed with a plasmid 
expressing a bacterial luciferase protein. With several independent clone cells 
of transformants, the levels of luciferase activity and some hsps, such as 
hsp104, hsp90, hsp70 and hsp26, were examined. The luciferase activity was 
significantly lower in ssa1ssa2 transformants than in the wild type (wt) cell 
transformed with the same plasmid. Among several clone cells of ssa1ssa2, the 
cells with higher luciferase activities exhibited higher amounts of Ssa4 which 
is known to be expressed instead of lacking Ssa1 and Ssa2. The luciferase 
activity closely correlated with the amount of Ssa proteins, more than with the 
amount of other hsps. It is suggested that constitutional Ssa "chaperones" are 
needed for the folding of proteins and, in cells lacking Ssa1 and Ssa2, the 
increased Ssa4 is thought to partly compensate for their role in the folding of 
luciferase in vivo.
