The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway promotes growth in 
invertebrates and vertebrates by increasing the levels of phosphatidylinositol 
3,4,5-triphosphate through the activation of p110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. 
Two key effectors of this pathway are the phosphoinositide-dependent protein 
kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt/PKB. Although genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans 
has implicated Akt as the only relevant PDK1 substrate, cell culture studies 
have suggested that PDK1 has additional targets. Here we show that, in 
Drosophila, dPDK1 controls cellular and organism growth by activating dAkt and 
S6 kinase, dS6K. Furthermore, dPDK1 genetically interacts with dRSK but not with 
dPKN, encoding two substrates of PDK1 in vitro. Thus, the results suggest that 
dPDK1 is required for dRSK but not dPKN activation and that it regulates 
insulin-mediated growth through two main effector branches, dAkt and dS6K.
