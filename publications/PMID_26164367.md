Calmodulin (CaM) is a cytoplasmic calcium sensor that interacts with the cardiac 
ryanodine receptor (RyR2), a large Ca(2+) channel complex that mediates Ca(2+) 
efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to activate cardiac muscle 
contraction. Direct CaM association with RyR2 is an important physiological 
regulator of cardiac muscle excitation-contraction coupling and defective 
CaM-RyR2 protein interaction has been reported in cases of heart failure. Recent 
genetic studies have identified CaM missense mutations in patients with a 
history of severe cardiac arrhythmogenic disorders that present divergent 
clinical features, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular 
tachycardia (CPVT), long QT syndrome (LQTS) and idiopathic ventricular 
fibrillation (IVF). Herein, we describe how two CPVT- (N54I & N98S) and three 
LQTS-associated (D96V, D130G & F142L) CaM mutations result in alteration of 
their biochemical and biophysical properties. Ca(2+)-binding studies indicate 
that the CPVT-associated CaM mutations, N54I & N98S, exhibit the same or a 
3-fold reduced Ca(2+)-binding affinity, respectively, versus wild-type CaM, 
whereas the LQTS-associated CaM mutants, D96V, D130G & F142L, display more 
profoundly reduced Ca(2+)-binding affinity. In contrast, all five CaM mutations 
confer a disparate RyR2 interaction and modulation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding to 
RyR2, regardless of CPVT or LQTS association. Our findings suggest that the 
clinical presentation of CPVT or LQTS associated with these five CaM mutations 
may involve both altered intrinsic Ca(2+)-binding as well as defective 
interaction with RyR2.
