Complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21) is an important receptor that amplifies B 
lymphocyte activation by bridging the innate and adaptive immune systems. CR2 
ligands include complement C3d and Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein 350/220. We 
describe the x-ray structure of this CR2 domain in complex with C3d at 2.0 
angstroms. The structure reveals extensive main chain interactions between C3d 
and only one short consensus repeat (SCR) of CR2 and substantial SCR side-side 
packing. These results provide a detailed understanding of receptor-ligand 
interactions in this protein family and reveal potential target sites for 
molecular drug design.
