Cell morphogenesis requires dynamic communication between actin filaments and 
microtubules which is mediated, at least in part, by direct structural links 
between the two cytoskeletal systems. Here, we examined interaction between the 
CLIP-associated proteins (CLASP) CLASP1 and CLASP2, and actin filaments. We 
demonstrate that, in addition to a well-established association with the distal 
ends of microtubules, CLASP2alpha co-localizes with stress fibers, and that both 
CLASP1alpha and CLASP2alpha co-immunoprecipitate with actin. GFP-CLASP2alpha 
exhibits retrograde flow in the lamellipodia of Xenopus primary fibroblasts and 
in the filopodia of Xenopus spinal cord neurons. A deletion mapping analysis 
reveals that both the microtubule-binding domain of CLASP2 (which is homologous 
between all CLASPs) and the N-terminal dis1/TOG domain of CLASP2alpha (which is 
homologous between alpha isoforms) possess actin-binding activity. Fluorescence 
resonance energy transfer experiments demonstrate significant energy transfer 
between YFP-CLASP2alpha and CFP-actin. Our results indicate that CLASPs function 
as actin/microtubule crosslinkers in interphase cells. We propose that CLASPs 
facilitate recognition of actin filaments by the plus ends of growing 
microtubules at the initial stages of actin-microtubule interaction. Cell Motil.
