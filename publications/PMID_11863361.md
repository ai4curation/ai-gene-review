The expression of the previously uncharacterized gene Adir (for ATP dependent 
interferon responsive gene) was increased by 5- to 15-fold in tissue of the oral 
cavity or in spleen and liver of mice treated orally or intraperitoneally with 
IFN-alpha, and in mouse cells treated in vitro with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma. The 
level of Adir mRNA was also increased 20- to 40-fold in the brains of animals 
infected with encephalomyocarditis virus. Adir is expressed ubiquitously in 
mouse tissues as 1.9-, 2.4-, and 3.5-kb mRNA transcripts encoding a 
385-amino-acid protein with a conserved ATP binding domain containing typical 
nucleotide and Mg(2+) binding sites. We also characterized the human ortholog, 
ADIR, which is located on chromosome 1q25-q31 and contains six exons encoding a 
397-amino-acid protein with 80% homology to the mouse protein. A single 2.3-kb 
mRNA was detected in all human tissues examined, except for placenta, which also 
contained a 1.25-kb tissue-specific transcript generated by alternative splicing 
and encoding a putative 336-amino-acid protein. Although ADIR exhibits low 
homology to DYT1 and TOR1B, the deduced ADIR protein sequences are highly 
homologous to torsin A and torsin B and more distantly related to members of the 
Clp/HSP100 family of proteins, suggesting that ADIR, like torsins, is related to 
the AAA chaperone-like family of ATPases. An ADIR-EGFP fusion protein expressed 
in HeLa cells was shown to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.
