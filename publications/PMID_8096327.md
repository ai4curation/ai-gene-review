The discovery of new cytokines normally relies on a prior knowledge of at least 
one of their biological effects, which is used as a criterion either for the 
purification of the protein or for the isolation of the complementary DNA by 
expression cloning. However, the redundancy of cytokine activities complicates 
the discovery of novel cytokines in this way, and the pleiotropic nature of many 
cytokines means that the principal activities of a new cytokine may bear little 
relation to that used for its isolation. We have adopted an alternative approach 
which relies on differential screening of an organized subtracted cDNA library 
from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using the inducibility of 
lymphokine messenger RNAs by anti-CD28 as a primary screening criterion. The 
ligation of the CD28 antigen on the T lymphocyte by a surface antigen, B7/BB-1, 
expressed on activated B lymphocytes and monocytes is a key step in the 
activation of T lymphocytes and the accumulation of lymphokine mRNAs. Here we 
report the discovery by molecular cloning of a new interleukin (interleukin-13 
or IL-13) expressed in activated human T lymphocytes. Recombinant IL-13 protein 
inhibits inflammatory cytokine production induced by lipopolysaccharide in human 
peripheral blood monocytes. Moreover, it synergizes with IL-2 in regulating 
interferon-gamma synthesis in large granular lymphocytes. Recent mapping of the 
IL-13 gene shows that it is closely linked to the IL-4 gene on chromosome 5q 
23-31 (ref. 4). Interleukin-13 may be critical in regulating inflammatory and 
immune responses.
