A hallmark of polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington disease (HD), is the 
formation of beta-sheet-rich aggregates, called amyloid, of causative proteins 
with expanded polyglutamines. However, it has remained unclear whether the 
polyglutamine amyloid is a direct cause or simply a secondary manifestation of 
the pathology. Here we show that huntingtin-exon1 (thtt) with expanded 
polyglutamines remarkably misfolds into distinct amyloid conformations under 
different temperatures, such as 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C. The 4 degrees C 
amyloid has loop/turn structures together with mostly beta-sheets, including 
exposed polyglutamines, whereas the 37 degrees C amyloid has more extended and 
buried beta-sheets. By developing a method to efficiently introduce amyloid into 
mammalian cells, we found that the formation of the 4 degrees C amyloid led to 
substantial toxicity, whereas the toxic effects of the 37 degrees C amyloid were 
very small. Importantly, thtt amyloids in different brain regions of HD mice 
also had distinct conformations. The thermolabile thtt amyloid with loop/turn 
structures in the striatum showed higher toxicity, whereas the rigid thtt 
amyloid with more extended beta-sheets in the hippocampus and cerebellum had 
only mild toxic effects. These studies show that the thtt protein with expanded 
polyglutamines can misfold into distinct amyloid conformations and, depending on 
the conformations, the amyloids can be either toxic or nontoxic. Thus, the 
amyloid conformation of thtt may be a critical determinant of cytotoxicity in 
HD.

Abstract

A hallmark of polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington disease (HD), is the formation of β-sheet-rich aggregates, called amyloid, of causative proteins with expanded polyglutamines. However, it has remained unclear whether the polyglutamine amyloid is a direct cause or simply a secondary manifestation of the pathology. Here we show that huntingtin-exon1 (thtt) with expanded polyglutamines remarkably misfolds into distinct amyloid conformations under different temperatures, such as 4 °C and 37 °C. The 4 °C amyloid has loop/turn structures together with mostly β-sheets, including exposed polyglutamines, whereas the 37 °C amyloid has more extended and buried β-sheets. By developing a method to efficiently introduce amyloid into mammalian cells, we found that the formation of the 4 °C amyloid led to substantial toxicity, whereas the toxic effects of the 37 °C amyloid were very small. Importantly, thtt amyloids in different brain regions of HD mice also had distinct conformations. The thermolabile thtt amyloid with loop/turn structures in the striatum showed higher toxicity, whereas the rigid thtt amyloid with more extended β-sheets in the hippocampus and cerebellum had only mild toxic effects. These studies show that the thtt protein with expanded polyglutamines can misfold into distinct amyloid conformations and, depending on the conformations, the amyloids can be either toxic or nontoxic. Thus, the amyloid conformation of thtt may be a critical determinant of cytotoxicity in HD.

Efficient Introduction of in Vitro thtt Amyloids into Mammalian Cells.

To directly examine the cytotoxicity of the different amyloid conformations, we sought to develop a highly efficient and versatile protocol by which in vitro amyloids are introduced into mammalian cells without laborious microinjection (see SI Text ). For mammalian cells, we used stable neuro2a cells that overexpress thtt-GFP fusion protein containing Q16, Q60, or Q150 under a ponasterone-regulatable promoter ( 30 ). After extensive attempts, we succeeded in delivering thtt amyloids into the neuro2a cells efficiently by using a lipid-based procedure. First, in vitro thttQ42 amyloids were introduced into thttQ150-GFP cells, followed by induction of thttQ150-GFP expression and cell differentiation ( 30 ). We then estimated the aggregation status of the endogenous thtt-GFP after 15 h of thtt expression and cell differentiation. If in vitro thtt amyloids are successfully introduced into cells, they are expected to seed endogenous thtt-GFP protein and thereby enhance aggregation of thtt-GFP. Remarkably, we found that the introduction of thttQ42 amyloids significantly accelerated thtt150Q-GFP aggregation ( Figs. 2 A and S7 A ). GFP foci, because of the aggregation of thttQ150-GFP, were observed in more than 80% of GFP-positive cells, whereas only 15–20% of cells had GFP foci after the treatment of cells with buffer alone, which represents spontaneous aggregation of thttQ150-GFP on induction of the protein expression ( Fig. 2 B ). Introduction of neither monomeric thtt nor BSA aggregates facilitated thttQ150-GFP aggregation, indicating that the seeding effects are specific to the thtt amyloid ( Fig. 2 B ). A significant acceleration of thtt-GFP aggregation by introduction of in vitro thttQ42 amyloid was also observed in other neuronal PC12 cells in which both in vitro amyloids and plasmids encoding thtt-GFP were introduced at the same time ( Fig. S8 ). Thus, our procedure for amyloid transduction is not limited to specific cells but is rather versatile. These results, together with colocalization of fluorescently labeled, in vitro thtt amyloids with thttQ150-GFP foci ( Fig. S7 B ), establish that in vitro thtt amyloids are successfully introduced into mammalian cells and act as “seeds” inside cells.

Next we investigated whether the amyloid conformations of endogenous thtt-GFP maintain those of in vitro thtt amyloids that were introduced into cells. By extensive washing with SDS, we partially purified thttQ60-GFP amyloids, which were formed in the presence of in vitro thttQ42-4 °C or thttQ42-37 °C amyloid “seeds”, in stable thttQ60-GFP neuro2a cells and analyzed their thermal resistance. We found that conformations of thttQ60-GFP amyloids in the neuro2a cells were similar to those of the in vitro thttQ42 amyloids that were introduced into cells ( Fig. 2 C and D ): thttQ60-GFP amyloids seeded by thttQ42-4 °C amyloids were more thermolabile, and those seeded by thttQ42-37 °C amyloids were thermally more stable, as observed for in vitro thttQ42-4 °C and thttQ42-37 °C amyloids, respectively. These results indicate that conformations of thtt amyloids faithfully propagate in mammalian cells, although slight differences in the thermal stability are observed between thttQ60-GFP amyloids and in vitro thttQ42 amyloids, which could be caused by the presence of aggregate-interacting proteins in the thttQ60-GFP amyloids or a GFP tag in thttQ60-GFP.

Discussion

The deposition of insoluble aggregates such as amyloids of causative proteins is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders. Although it has recently been suggested that oligomeric species of aggregate-prone proteins are responsible for these diseases, it remains controversial as to whether amyloid itself is also toxic, simply a secondary manifestation of the pathology or rather a result of cellular protection ( 6 , 7 , 10 – 16 ). This apparent inconsistency of previous results regarding amyloid toxicity may result from the structural diversity of amyloid, as amyloid-forming protein often misfolds into multiple conformations and each conformation could exert distinct physiological effects ( 19 , 23 ).

Previous reports indicate that the thermodynamic parameter of temperature can modulate protein folding and dynamics of amyloid-forming proteins, leading to different amyloid conformations ( 19 , 32 – 34 ). Here we took advantages of this fact by making distinct thtt amyloids simply by polymerizing thtt protein at 4 °C or 37 °C. Furthermore, we developed a highly efficient procedure to introduce amyloid into mammalian cells. Although delivery of in vitro polyglutamines into mammalian cells has been reported ( 11 , 14 , 35 ), our efficient procedure of amyloid introduction in combination with creating distinct conformations of thtt amyloids allows us to directly evaluate toxicity of distinct amyloid conformations of thtt protein.

Both thtt-4 °C and thtt-37 °C aggregates showed the morphology of mature amyloids, which are different from protofibrils ( Fig. 1 A ). The 2 amyloid conformations showed homogeneous and similar morphology by EM analysis and are abundant in β-sheets ( 4 , 5 , 36 , 37 ) ( Figs. 1 B and C and S2 ), which are intramolecular and/or intermolecular. However, we found some structural differences in the 2 amyloid conformations despite relatively low resolutional analyses. Notably, the 4 °C amyloid has some flexible loops/turns together with mostly β-sheets, including exposed polyglutamines, although it remains unclear whether the loop/turn structures are derived from expanded polyglutamiens or the rest of thtt. The 4 °C amyloid showed more toxic effects, whereas the 37 °C amyloid with extended β-sheets including buried polyglutamines showed less toxicity ( Fig. 4 C ). It is possible that flexible and exposed polyglutamines easily interact with and sequester other functional proteins into thtt aggregates and thereby lead to cell death, whereas the limited dynamics of the polyglutamines buried into an amyloid core exerts only modest toxic or nontoxic effects. Thus, this study demonstrates that thtt amyloid can be either toxic or nontoxic, depending on their conformations. This finding is consistent with the previous observation that deposition of polyglutamine aggregates is not correlated with toxicity ( 16 ), as mature polyglutamine aggregates seen as deposition would be abundant in extended β-sheets and thus contain buried polyglutamines. Our results are also reconciled with the involvement of oligomeric and monomeric htt in cytotoxicity, as we and others have suggested important roles of exposed polyglutamines in oligomeric and monomeric htt in cytotoxicity ( 14 , 28 ). Thus, the flexible and exposed property of expanded polyglutamines may be a critical determinant of cytotoxicity, regardless of whether the polyglutamine-bearing protein is in a monomeric, oligomeric, or amyloid form.

Another important issue in the field of neurodegenerative disorders is the regional specificity of cellular vulnerability ( 3 ). In HD, the striatum is the most vulnerable whereas loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells is limited only in juvenile-onset cases ( 2 , 3 ). Nonetheless, it remains unclear what determines the regional specificity of HD. We hypothesized that structural differences of htt amyloids in distinct brain regions may be involved in the regional specificity of cellular vulnerability in HD. Here we showed that conformations of thtt amyloids in vivo were indeed diverse and led to different cytotoxicity. The higher toxicity of thtt amyloids in the striatum was also observed for the thtt-4 °C amyloid conformation in vitro. Importantly, both amyloid forms show similar structural features: They have β-sheets (but less extended β-sheets) with some loop/turn structures, resulting in relatively fragile and thermolabile conformations. In contrast, the rigid thtt amyloids, because of extended β-sheets, formed at 37 °C in vitro and in the hippocampus and cerebellum showed only mild toxicity. Consistent with these present results, striatal neurons are the most susceptible to neuronal death in HD ( 2 ). Therefore, the fragile and exposed property of thtt amyloid in striatum may be one of the key factors for striatal vulnerability in HD. These results suggest that the conformational differences of thtt amyloids (or soluble aggregated species) may dictate the regional specificity of HD. It is likely that different expression levels and types of chaperones and htt-interacting proteins in distinct brain regions modulate the extent of folding and dynamics of htt ( 38 ). These differences, in turn, could lead to a range of htt conformations that have distinct cytotoxicity when htt protein misfolds. In fact, microarray experiments show that mRNA levels of chaperones and transcription factors that bind to htt with expanded polyglutamines are different between distinct brain regions ( 39 ).

In summary, we demonstrated that thtt with expanded polyglutamines can misfold into multiple conformations and the structural diversity is involved in apparently different toxic effects of the amyloids. Although a range of efforts have been made to intervene with amyloid diseases ( 40 ), our finding provides a therapeutic strategy for polyglutamine disease: The conformation of 4 °C amyloids should be targeted to prevent HD in the future. Furthermore, we propose that among different possible misfolding pathways of mutant htt, an attempt to direct the mutant htt to misfolding into a rigid amyloid conformation containing extended β-sheets could reduce the potential toxicity of the mutant htt.

Introduction of in Vitro thtt Amyloid into Neuro2a Cells.

thttQ42/62 (5 μM) was polymerized at 4 °C or 37 °C, and resulting amyloid was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. After removal of supernatant, a 50 μM amyloid solution in 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl was sonicated for 30 s (Branson sonifier, 20%). Atomic force microscopy (Digital Instruments) showed that the sonicated fibers are homogeneous in length. An aliquot of the amyloid solution was mixed with Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagents (Invitrogen) to the final concentration of 2.5 μM in 50 μL DMEM, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature and poured onto stable neuro2a cells of an HD model ( 30 ) in 250 μL DMEM culture media. After 3 h of the amyloid transduction, expression of thtt-GFP was induced with 1 μM ponasterone A (Invitrogen), and cells were differentiated with 5 mM dibutyrylcyclic AMP (Nacalai Tesque).
