The mammalian rasGAPs constitute a group of widely expressed proteins involved 
in the negative regulation of ras-mediated signaling. In this study we have 
isolated a novel human gene, RASAL (Ras GTPase-activating-like) and its murine 
ortholog, MRASAL which are most similar to the GAP1 family of rasGAP proteins, 
based upon the presence and organization of specific conserved domains. 
Full-length human and murine mRNA sequences are predicted to encode 804 and 799 
amino acid polypeptides, respectively. Sequence analysis of these two proteins 
revealed the presence of two N-terminal calcium-dependent phospholipid binding 
C2 domains, a conserved GAP related domain (GRD) and a C-terminal pleckstrin 
homology (PH) domain. Northern blot and mRNA in situ hybridization analyses 
indicate that RASAL, in contrast to other mammalian rasGAP proteins, has a 
limited expression pattern; RASAL is highly expressed in the follicular cells of 
the thyroid and the adrenal medulla and expressed at lower levels in brain, 
spinal cord and trachea. Human RASAL has been localized by radiation hybrid 
mapping to chromosome 12q23-24.
