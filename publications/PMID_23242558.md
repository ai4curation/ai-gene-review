Phosphohydroxylysinuria has been described in two patients with neurological 
symptoms, but the deficient enzyme or mutated gene has never been identified. In 
the present work, we tested the hypothesis that this condition is due to 
mutations in the AGXT2L2 gene, recently shown to encode phosphohydroxylysine 
phospholyase. DNA analysis from a third patient, without neurological symptoms, 
but with an extreme hyperlaxicity of the joints, shows the existence of two 
mutations, p. Gly240Arg and p.Glu437Val, both in the heterozygous state. 
Sequencing of cDNA clones derived from fibroblasts mRNA indicated that the two 
mutations were allelic. Both mutations replace conserved residues. The mutated 
proteins were produced as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and HEK293T 
cells and shown to be very largely insoluble, whereas the wild-type one was 
produced as a soluble and active protein. We conclude that 
phosphohydroxylysinuria is due to mutations in the AGXT2L2 gene and the 
resulting lack of activity of phosphohydroxylysine phospholyase in vivo. The 
finding that the nul alleles of p.Gly240Arg and p.Glu437Val are present at low 
frequencies in the European and/or North American population suggests that this 
condition is more common than previously thought. The diversity of the clinical 
symptoms described in three patients with phosphohydroxylysinuria indicates that 
this is most likely not a neurometabolic disease.
