Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident mannosidases generate asparagine-linked 
oligosaccharide signals that trigger ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) of 
unfolded glycoproteins. In this study, we provide in vitro evidence that a 
complex of the yeast protein disulfide isomerase Pdi1p and the mannosidase Htm1p 
processes Man(8)GlcNAc(2) carbohydrates bound to unfolded proteins, yielding 
Man(7)GlcNAc(2). This glycan serves as a signal for HRD ligase-mediated 
glycoprotein disposal. We identified a point mutation in PDI1 that prevents 
complex formation of the oxidoreductase with Htm1p, diminishes mannosidase 
activity, and delays degradation of unfolded glycoproteins in vivo. Our results 
show that Pdi1p is engaged in both recognition and glycan signal processing of 
ERAD substrates and suggest that protein folding and breakdown are not separated 
but interconnected processes. We propose a stochastic model for how a given 
glycoprotein is partitioned into folding or degradation pathways and how the 
flux through these pathways is adjusted to stress conditions.
