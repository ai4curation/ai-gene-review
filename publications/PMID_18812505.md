The small natural product rapamycin, when bound to FKBP12, is a potent inhibitor 
of an evolutionarily conserved Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1), which 
plays a central role in mediating cellular response to nutrient availability. 
Given the prominent role of TORC1 in cell growth and proliferation, clinical 
trials have explored the possibility of using rapamycin as an anticancer agent. 
Unfortunately, the percentage of patients responding favorably has been low, 
intensifying the need to find biomarkers able to predict rapamycin sensitivity 
or resistance. In this study, we elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying 
partial rapamycin resistance in yeast. Using the yeast deletion collection, we 
identified 15 deletion strains leading to partial rapamycin resistance. Among 
these were Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase Sod1, copper transporter Ctr1, and copper 
chaperone Lys7, suggesting a role for oxidative stress in rapamycin resistance. 
Further analysis revealed that all 15 strains exhibit elevated levels of 
superoxide anions, and we show that elevated levels of reactive oxygen species 
specifically modify TORC1 such that it is no longer able to fully bind 
FKBP12:rapamycin. Therefore, elevated oxidative stress modifies TORC1 and 
prevents its binding to the FKBP12:rapamycin complex, ultimately leading to 
rapamycin resistance. These results warrant an examination into whether similar 
reasons explain rapamycin resistance observed in various clinical samples.
