Here we report an NMR study on the substrate interaction modes of GroEL using 
amyloid β (Aβ) as a model ligand. We found that GroEL could suppress Aβ(1-40) 
amyloid formation by interacting with its two hydrophobic segments Leu17-Ala21 
and Ala30-Val36, which involve key residues in fibril formation. The binding 
site of Aβ(1-40) was mapped on a pair of α-helices located in the GroEL apical 
domain. These results provide insights into chaperonin recognition of 
amyloidogenic proteins of pathological interest.
