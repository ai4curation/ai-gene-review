Pep3p and Pep5p are known to be necessary for trafficking of hydrolase 
precursors to the vacuole and for vacuolar biogenesis. These proteins are 
present in a hetero-oligomeric complex that mediates transport at the vacuolar 
membrane. PEP5 interacts genetically with VPS8, implicating Pep5p in the earlier 
Golgi to endosome step and/or in recycling from the endosome to the Golgi. To 
understand further the cellular roles of Pep3p and Pep5p, we isolated and 
characterized a set of pep3 conditional mutants. Characterization of mutants 
revealed that pep3(ts) mutants are defective in the endosomal and nonendosomal 
Golgi to vacuole transport pathways, in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting 
pathway, in recycling from the endosome back to the late Golgi, and in 
endocytosis. PEP3 interacts genetically with two members of the endosomal SNARE 
complex, PEP12 (t-SNARE) and PEP7 (homologue of mammalian EEA1); Pep3p and Pep5p 
associate physically with Pep7p as revealed by two-hybrid analysis. Our results 
suggest that a core Pep3p/Pep5p complex promotes vesicular docking/fusion 
reactions in conjunction with SNARE proteins at multiple steps in transport 
routes to the vacuole. We propose that this complex may be responsible for 
tethering transport vesicles on target membranes.
