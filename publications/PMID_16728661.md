The voltage-sensitive Na(+) channel Na(v)1.5 plays a crucial role in generating 
and propagating the cardiac action potential and its dysfunction promotes 
cardiac arrhythmias. The channel takes part into a large molecular complex 
containing regulatory proteins. Thus, factors that modulate its biosynthesis, 
localization, activity, and/or degradation are of great interest from both a 
physiological and pathological standpoint. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, we 
unveiled a novel partner, 14-3-3eta, interacting with the Na(v)1.5 cytoplasmic I 
interdomain. The interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of 14-3-3 
and full-length Na(v)1.5 both in COS-7 cells expressing recombinant Na(v)1.5 and 
in mouse cardiac myocytes. Using immunocytochemistry, we also found that 14-3-3 
and Na(v)1.5 colocalized at the intercalated discs. We tested the functional 
link between Na(v)1.5 and 14-3-3eta using the whole-cell patch-clamp 
configuration. Coexpressing Na(v)1.5, the beta1 subunit and 14-3-3eta induced a 
negative shift in the inactivation curve of the Na(+) current, a delayed 
recovery from inactivation, but no changes in the activation curve or in the 
current density. The negative shift was reversed, and the recovery from 
inactivation was normalized by overexpressing the Na(v)1.5 cytoplasmic I 
interdomain interacting with 14-3-3eta. Reversal was also obtained with the 
dominant negative R56,60A 14-3-3eta mutant, suggesting that dimerization of 
14-3-3 is needed for current regulation. Computer simulations suggest that the 
absence of 14-3-3 could exert proarrhythmic effects on cardiac electrical 
restitution properties. Based on these findings, we propose that the 14-3-3 
protein is a novel component of the cardiac Na(+) channel acting as a cofactor 
for the regulation of the cardiac Na(+) current.
