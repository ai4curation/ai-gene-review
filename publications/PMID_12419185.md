DNA double-strand breaks represent the most potentially serious damage to a 
genome; hence, many repair proteins are recruited to nuclear damage sites by as 
yet poorly characterized sensor mechanisms. Here, we show that NBS1, the gene 
product defective in Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), physically interacts with 
histone, rather than damaged DNA, by direct binding to gamma-H2AX. We also 
demonstrate that NBS1 binding can occur in the absence of interaction with 
hMRE11 or BRCA1. Furthermore, this NBS1 physical interaction was reduced when 
anti-gamma-H2AX antibody was introduced into normal cells and was also delayed 
in AT cells, which lack the kinase activity for phosphorylation of H2AX. NBS1 
has no DNA binding region but carries a combination of the fork-head associated 
(FHA) and the BRCA1 C-terminal domains (BRCT). We show that the FHA/BRCT domain 
of NBS1 is essential for this physical interaction, since NBS1 lacking this 
domain failed to bind to gamma-H2AX in cells, and a recombinant FHA/BRCT domain 
alone can bind to recombinant gamma-H2AX. Consequently, the FHA/BRCT domain is 
likely to have a crucial role for both binding to histone and for relocalization 
of hMRE11/hRAD50 nuclease complex to the vicinity of DNA damage.

The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1/Xrs2 (MRN/X) complex is a conserved first responder to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). All three members of the complex have DNA binding properties that support the range of functions MRN/X performs in its role in DNA DSB repair. Previous structural and functional studies have localized DNA binding sites within MRE11 and RAD50, but no structural model exists for DNA association with NBS1/Xrs2. Here, we identify a DNA binding site within the N-terminal folded FHA-BRCT-BRCT domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Xrs2. Using NMR chemical shift perturbations and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements, we define a DNA binding interface on the FHA domain and generate integrative models of the DNA-bound complex via the program HADDOCK. DNA binding overlaps with the site involved in phosphorylated Sae2 peptide binding – an interaction analogous to that between Schizosaccharomyces pombe Nbs1 and phosphorylated Ctp1. Comparative binding assays and site-directed mutagenesis confirm a shared binding surface for DNA and pSae2 on the FHA domain of Xrs2 and highlight the need for functional assays and mutagenesis for validating HADDOCK models. Finally, NMR relaxation experiments reveal altered ps–ns timescale dynamics but unaltered μs-ms conformational exchange upon ligand binding. These findings define a direct DNA binding role for Xrs2 and provide a structural framework for understanding its dual recognition of DNA and phosphoprotein partners during DSB repair.
