Recently we identified a novel human (h) multiprotein complex, called 
TATA-binding protein (TBP)-free TAFII-containing complex (TFTC), which is able 
to nucleate RNA polymerase II transcription and can mediate transcriptional 
activation. Here we demonstrate that TFTC, similar to other TBP-free TAFII 
complexes (yeast SAGA, hSTAGA, and hPCAF) contains the acetyltransferase hGCN5 
and is able to acetylate histones in both a free and a nucleosomal context. The 
recently described TRRAP cofactor for oncogenic transcription factor pathways 
was also characterized as a TFTC subunit. Furthermore, we identified four other 
previously uncharacterized subunits of TFTC: hADA3, hTAFII150, hSPT3, and 
hPAF65beta. Thus, the polypeptide composition of TFTC suggests that TFTC is 
recruited to chromatin templates by activators to acetylate histones and thus 
may potentiate initiation and activation of transcription.
