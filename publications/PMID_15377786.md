The electronic spin state of iron in lower mantle perovskite is one of the 
fundamental parameters that governs the physics and chemistry of the most 
voluminous and massive shell in the Earth. We present experimental evidence for 
spin-pairing transition in aluminum-bearing silicate perovskite 
(Mg,Fe)(Si,Al)O(3) under the lower mantle pressures. Our results demonstrate 
that as pressure increases, iron in perovskite transforms gradually from the 
initial high-spin state toward the final low-spin state. At 100 GPa, both 
aluminum-free and aluminum-bearing samples exhibit a mixed spin state. The 
residual magnetic moment in the aluminum-bearing perovskite is significantly 
higher than that in its aluminum-free counterpart. The observed spin evolution 
with pressure can be explained by the presence of multiple iron species and the 
occurrence of partial spin-paring transitions in the perovskite. 
Pressure-induced spin-pairing transitions in the perovskite would have important 
bearing on the magnetic, thermoelastic, and transport properties of the lower 
mantle, and on the distribution of iron in the Earth's interior.
