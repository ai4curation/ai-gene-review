The mechanisms by which cyclins promote mammalian cell cycle progression have 
been a topic of intense investigation over the last decade. We previously 
described an interaction between D-type cyclins and A-kinase anchoring protein, 
AKAP95. Here, we demonstrate that AKAP95 can also bind cyclin E1. Association 
between AKAP95 and cyclins is displaced by CDKs. We show that these G(1)/S 
cyclins can interact with RII subunit of PKAalpha through AKAP95. The presence 
of alternate complexes cyclin-CDK and cyclin D/E-AKAP95-PKA.RIIalpha suggest 
different roles of G(1)/S cyclins and a wider biological importance of these 
interactions in cells.
