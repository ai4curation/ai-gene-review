The BRCA1 gene product and its stoichiometric binding partner, BARD1, play a 
vital role in the cellular response to DNA damage. However, how they acquire 
specific biochemical functions after DNA damage is poorly understood. Following 
exposure to genotoxic stress, DNA damage-specific interactions were observed 
between BRCA1/BARD1 and the DNA damage-response proteins, TopBP1 and 
Mre11/Rad50/NBS1. Two distinct DNA damage-dependent super complexes emerged; 
their activation was dependent, in part, on the actions of specific checkpoint 
kinases, and each super complex contributed to a distinctive aspect of the DNA 
damage response. The results support a new, multifactorial model that describes 
how genotoxic stress enables BRCA1 to execute a diverse set of DNA 
damage-response functions.

Abstract

The BRCA1 gene product and its stoichiometric binding partner, BARD1, play a vital role in the cellular response to DNA damage. However, how they acquire specific biochemical functions after DNA damage is poorly understood. Following exposure to genotoxic stress, DNA damage-specific interactions were observed between BRCA1/BARD1 and the DNA damage-response proteins, TopBP1 and Mre11/Rad50/NBS1. Two distinct DNA damage-dependent super complexes emerged; their activation was dependent, in part, on the actions of specific checkpoint kinases, and each super complex contributed to a distinctive aspect of the DNA damage response. The results support a new, multifactorial model that describes how genotoxic stress enables BRCA1 to execute a diverse set of DNA damage-response functions.

Discussion

With the onset of acute DNA damage, it appears that BRCA1 plays a set of dynamic roles that individually and collectively contribute to a proper damage response. It is attracted to sites of acutely damaged DNA and is responsible for the colocalization there of a subset of its constitutive binding partners ( Fig. 1 ). Damage-dependent BRCA1-interacting partners (e.g., TopBP1 and the M/R/N) reach these sites independently. Three distinctive BRCA1/BARD-containing super complexes subsequently form at damage sites, each with a particular DNA damage response-associated function. At the current level of insight, the operations of these super complexes extend to control of the G2/M checkpoint (BRCA1–CtIP), replication origin firing (BRCA1–BACH1), and DSB localization of the Rad51 recombinase (BRCA1–BRCA2). The data strongly suggest that BRCA1 serves as a focal point in the formation of multiple, functionally distinct complexes at sites of DNA damage ( Fig. 7 ). Such a model is consistent with earlier genetic evidence implying that the protein operates as a scaffold during cellular DNA damage responses ( Scully et al. 1999 ).

Very recently, mutation of the BACH1 gene has been identified as the underlying genetic defect responsible for the Fanconi Anemia J complementation group (for review, see Thompson 2005 ). The types of BACH1-dependent DNA damage control implied by these results are not likely related to Rad51 DSB localization, since BACH1 deficiency, unlike BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiency, did not affect Rad51 focus formation or laser-stripe homing ( Litman et al. 2005 ; data not shown). Considering the established roles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (FANCD1) ( Howlett et al. 2002 ; Venkitaraman 2002 ) in resolving DNA interstrand cross-links, it is possible that distinct BRCA1 complexes involving BACH1 and BRCA2 play a cooperative role in repairing forms of DNA damage involving such cross-links.
