X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A) is caused by defects of the 
transporter ABCB7 and is characterized by mitochondrial iron deposition and 
excess of protoporphyrin in erythroid cells. We describe ABCB7 silencing in HeLa 
cells by performing sequential transfections with siRNAs. The phenotype of the 
ABCB7-deficient cells was characterized by a strong reduction in proliferation 
rate that was not rescued by iron supplementation, by evident signs of iron 
deficiency, and by a large approximately 6-fold increase of iron accumulation in 
the mitochondria that was poorly available to mitochondrial ferritin. The cells 
showed an increase of protoporphyrin IX, a higher sensitivity to H(2)O(2) 
toxicity, and a reduced activity of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), 
while the activity of mitochondrial enzymes, such as citrate synthase or 
succinate dehydrogenase, and ATP content were not decreased. In contrast, 
aconitase activity, particularly that of the cytosolic, IRP1 form, was reduced. 
The results support the hypothesis that ABCB7 is involved in the transfer of 
iron from mitochondria to cytosol, and in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S 
enzymes. In addition, the results indicate that anemia in XLSA/A is caused by 
the accumulation of iron in a form that is not readily usable for heme 
synthesis.
