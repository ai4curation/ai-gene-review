Dysbindin is a schizophrenia susceptibility gene required for the development of 
dendritic spines. The expression of dysbindin proteins is decreased in the 
brains of schizophrenia patients, and neurons in mice carrying a deletion in the 
dysbindin gene have fewer dendritic spines. Hence, dysbindin might contribute to 
the spine pathology of schizophrenia, which manifests as a decrease in the 
number of dendritic spines. The development of dendritic spines is a dynamic 
process involving formation, retraction, and transformation of dendritic 
protrusions. It has yet to be determined whether dysbindin regulates the 
dynamics of dendritic protrusions. Here we address this question using 
time-lapse imaging in hippocampal neurons. Our results show that dysbindin is 
required to stabilize dendritic protrusions. In dysbindin-null neurons, 
dendritic protrusions are hyperactive in formation, retraction, and conversion 
between different types of protrusions. We further show that CaMKIIα is required 
for the stabilization of mushroom/thin spines, and that the hyperactivity of 
dendritic protrusions in dysbindin-null neurons is attributed in part to 
decreased CaMKIIα activity resulting from increased inhibition of CaMKIIα by 
Abi1. These findings elucidate the function of dysbindin in the dynamic 
morphogenesis of dendritic protrusions, and reveal the essential roles of 
dysbindin and CaMKIIα in the stabilization of dendritic protrusions during 
neuronal development.
