In mammalian cells, signal peptide-dependent protein transport into the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is mediated by a dynamic protein-conducting channel, 
the Sec61 complex. Previous work has characterized the Sec61 channel as a 
potential ER Ca(2+) leak channel and identified calmodulin as limiting Ca(2+) 
leakage in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner by binding to an IQ motif in the cytosolic 
aminoterminus of Sec61α. Here, we manipulated the concentration of the ER 
lumenal chaperone BiP in cells in different ways and used live cell Ca(2+) 
imaging to monitor the effects of reduced levels of BiP on ER Ca(2+) leakage. 
Regardless of how the BiP concentration was lowered, the absence of available 
BiP led to increased Ca(2+) leakage via the Sec61 complex. When we replaced 
wild-type Sec61α with mutant Sec61αY344H in the same model cell, however, Ca(2+) 
leakage from the ER increased and was no longer affected by manipulation of the 
BiP concentration. Thus, BiP limits ER Ca(2+) leakage through the Sec61 complex 
by binding to the ER lumenal loop 7 of Sec61α in the vicinity of tyrosine 344.

Abstract

In mammalian cells, signal peptide-dependent protein transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is mediated by a dynamic protein-conducting channel, the Sec61 complex. Previous work has characterized the Sec61 channel as a potential ER Ca 2+ leak channel and identified calmodulin as limiting Ca 2+ leakage in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner by binding to an IQ motif in the cytosolic aminoterminus of Sec61α. Here, we manipulated the concentration of the ER lumenal chaperone BiP in cells in different ways and used live cell Ca 2+ imaging to monitor the effects of reduced levels of BiP on ER Ca 2+ leakage. Regardless of how the BiP concentration was lowered, the absence of available BiP led to increased Ca 2+ leakage via the Sec61 complex. When we replaced wild-type Sec61α with mutant Sec61αY344H in the same model cell, however, Ca 2+ leakage from the ER increased and was no longer affected by manipulation of the BiP concentration. Thus, BiP limits ER Ca 2+ leakage through the Sec61 complex by binding to the ER lumenal loop 7 of Sec61α in the vicinity of tyrosine 344.

Introduction

In mammalian cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents a major storage compartment for calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) as well as the major site of synthesis of soluble and membrane proteins of various cell organelles ( Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975 ). The latter function involves an aqueous polypeptide-conducting pore in the ER membrane that is large enough to accommodate a polypeptide chain in transit. In contrast, the function as reservoir for receptor-controlled Ca 2+ release requires the ER membrane to be more or less impermeable to Ca 2+ . Otherwise, the Ca 2+ gradient between ER lumen and cytosol could not be maintained and Ca 2+ could not excert its central role as a second messenger in cellular signalling ( Crowley et al, 1994 ; Berridge, 2002 ; Rizzuto and Pozzan, 2006 ). However, the Ca 2+ impermeability of the ER membrane is not absolute ( Camello et al, 2002 ). It is one of the functions of the sarcoplasmic ER calcium ATPase (SERCA) to counteract the so-called passive Ca 2+ efflux (also termed, Ca 2+ leakage) from the ER in order to maintain the Ca 2+ gradient ( Wuytack et al, 2002 ).

Many proteins of the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi, endosomes, lysosomes, plasma membrane, nucleus, peroxisomes, and the extracellular space are integrated into the ER membrane or transported to the ER lumen by a protein translocase with the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex acting as a dynamic polypeptide-conducting channel ( Görlich and Rapoport, 1993 ; Hartmann et al, 1994 ). Pore diameters of the Sec61 channel have been found to range from 9–15 Å for the closed to 40–60 Å for the open mammalian Sec61 complex ( Hamman et al, 1997 ; Wirth et al, 2003 ). After completion of protein translocation, that is, when the Sec61 complex is still ribosome bound but free of a translocating polypeptide chain, or in the ribosome-free state, the Sec61 complex can transiently allow Ca 2+ flux ( Flourakis et al, 2006 ; Erdmann et al, 2011 ; Lang et al, 2011a ). Therefore, gating of the Sec61 channel is tightly regulated. Signal sequences of precursor polypeptides destined for the ER contribute to Sec61 channel gating, that is, to opening of the Sec61 complex for partial or full passage of a precursor polypeptide ( Kim et al, 2002 ). Furthermore, ER lumenal BiP and cytosolic Ca 2 + –calmodulin (CaM) facilitate Sec61 channel gating from the open to the closed state. According to in-vitro experiments, BiP can play a role in opening the Sec61 complex for polypeptide passage together with its nucleotide exchange factor Grp170 ( Dierks et al, 1996 ) and is involved in Sec61 channel closure before and early in translocation together with a hitherto unidentified Hsp40-type co-chaperone ( Hamman et al, 1998 ; Alder et al, 2005 ). Ca 2+ –CaM binds to an IQ motif present in the cytosolic aminoterminus of the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex and limits Ca 2+ leakage from the ER by closing the Sec61 channel in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner. Because the ER is not a major Ca 2+ storage organelle in lower eukaryotes, such as yeast, the latter two gating mechanisms may not be relevant to all eukaryotes ( Harsman et al, 2011 ).

We asked if the proposed role of BiP in channel closure can be demonstrated at the cellular level and whether the mechanism can be further elucidated. To do so, we manipulated the concentration of available BiP in human cells by different means, such as BIP gene silencing or induction of protein misfolding in the ER, and used live cell Ca 2+ imaging to monitor the effects of reduced levels of BiP on ER Ca 2+ leakage. Regardless of how the BiP concentration was lowered, the absence of available BiP led to increased Ca 2+ leakage from the ER via the Sec61 complex. Recent work on a mouse model for diabetes has indicated that a point mutation in the ER lumenal loop 7 of murine Sec61α leads to a partially deficient Sec61 complex and to β-cell death as well as diabetes ( Lloyd et al, 2010 ). When we replaced wild-type Sec61α with the respective mutant Sec61αY344H in human cells, Ca 2+ leakage from the ER was increased and this ER Ca 2+ leakage was no longer affected by manipulation of the BiP concentration. The results suggest that BiP limits ER Ca 2+ leakage by gating the Sec61 complex via binding to loop 7 of Sec61α. This interpretation is further substantiated by the observations that the Y344H mutation also affects opening of the Sec61 channel for BiP-dependent translocation of certain precursor polypeptides and loop 7 interaction of BiP.
