The most prevalent disease-causing mutation of CFTR is the deletion of Phe508 
(ΔF508), which leads to defects in conventional Golgi-mediated exocytosis and 
cell surface expression. We report that ΔF508-CFTR surface expression can be 
rescued in vitro and in vivo by directing it to an unconventional 
GRASP-dependent secretion pathway. An integrated molecular and physiological 
analysis indicates that mechanisms associated with ER stress induce cell surface 
trafficking of the ER core-glycosylated wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR via the 
GRASP-dependent pathway. Phosphorylation of a specific site of GRASP and the 
PDZ-based interaction between GRASP and CFTR are critical for this 
unconventional surface trafficking. Remarkably, transgenic expression of GRASP 
in ΔF508-CFTR mice restores CFTR function and rescues mouse survival without 
apparent toxicity. These findings provide insight into how unconventional 
protein secretion is activated, and offer a potential therapeutic strategy for 
the treatment of cystic fibrosis and perhaps diseases stemming from other 
misfolded proteins.
