Development of the vertebrate gut is controlled by paracrine crosstalk between 
the endodermal epithelium and the associated splanchnic mesoderm. In the adult, 
the same types of signals control epithelial proliferation and survival, which 
account for the importance of the stroma in colon carcinoma progression. Here, 
we show that targeting murine Foxf1 and Foxf2, encoding forkhead transcription 
factors, has pleiotropic effects on intestinal paracrine signaling. Inactivation 
of both Foxf2 alleles, or one allele each of Foxf1 and Foxf2, cause a range of 
defects, including megacolon, colorectal muscle hypoplasia and agangliosis. Foxf 
expression in the splanchnic mesoderm is activated by Indian and sonic hedgehog 
secreted by the epithelium. In Foxf mutants, mesenchymal expression of Bmp4 is 
reduced, whereas Wnt5a expression is increased. Activation of the canonical Wnt 
pathway -- with nuclear localization of beta-catenin in epithelial cells -- is 
associated with over-proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Extracellular 
matrix, particularly collagens, is severely reduced in Foxf mutant intestine, 
which causes epithelial depolarization and tissue disintegration. Thus, Foxf 
proteins are mesenchymal factors that control epithelial proliferation and 
survival, and link hedgehog to Bmp and Wnt signaling.
