Human Fe65L2 is a member of the Fe65 protein family, which interacts with 
amyloid precursor protein (APP). Fe65L2 contains an N-terminal WW (Trp-Trp) 
domain followed by two phosphotyrosine-interaction domains, and consists of 486 
amino acids. In the present study, we cloned and characterized two novel 
isoforms of Fe65L2, designated I-214 and I-245, which are produced by 
alternative splicing of the RNA. The splicing events disrupt the ability to bind 
with APP and low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related protein. Fe65L2 was highly 
expressed in the brain, whereas I-214 and I-245 were expressed in various 
tissues. In HEK-293 cells, Fe65L2 was expressed in the nucleus and cytosol, 
whereas I-245 and I-214 were localized exclusively to the nucleus. The ratio of 
I-214 to Fe65L2 mRNA was increased by apoptotic stimuli. Although the 
overexpression of either Fe65L2 or I-214 did not significantly affect the 
half-life and maturation of APP, or the secretion of secreted APP, the secretion 
of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta)40 and Abeta42 was increased by overexpression of 
Fe65L2, but not by that of I-214. These results suggest that Fe65L2 affects 
Abeta production and a possible regulation of Fe65L2 function by alternative 
splicing.
