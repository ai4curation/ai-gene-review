Mechanisms governing the activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the 
major source of nitric oxide (NO) in the nervous system, are not completely 
understood. We report here a protein-protein interaction between nNOS and NOSIP 
(nitric oxide synthase-interacting protein) in rat brain in vivo. NOSIP and nNOS 
are concentrated in neuronal synapses and demonstrate significant colocalization 
in various regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems. NOSIP produces 
a significant reduction in nNOS activity in a neuroepithelioma cell line stably 
expressing nNOS. Furthermore, overexpression of NOSIP in cultured primary 
neurons reduces the availability of nNOS in terminal dendrites. These results 
thus suggest that the interaction between NOSIP and nNOS is functionally 
involved in endogenous mechanisms regulating NO synthesis. Furthermore, we found 
that the subcellular distribution and expression levels of NOSIP are dynamically 
regulated by neuronal activity in vitro as well as in vivo, suggesting that 
NOSIP may contribute to a mechanism via which neuronal activity regulates the 
synaptic availability and activity of nNOS.
