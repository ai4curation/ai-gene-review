FAT10 is an interferon-gamma-inducible ubiquitin-like protein that consists of 
two ubiquitin-like domains. FAT10 bears a diglycine motif at its C terminus that 
can form isopeptide bonds to so far unidentified target proteins. Recently we 
found that FAT10 and its conjugates are rapidly degraded by the proteasome and 
that the N-terminal fusion of FAT10 to a long lived protein markedly reduces its 
half-life. FAT10 may hence direct target proteins to the proteasome for 
degradation. In this study we report a new interaction partner of FAT10 that may 
link FAT10 to the proteasome. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified NEDD8 
ultimate buster-1L (NUB1L) as a non-covalent binding partner of FAT10, and this 
interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase 
pull-down experiments. NUB1L is also an interferon-inducible protein that has 
been reported to interact with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8, thus leading to 
accelerated NEDD8 degradation. Here we show that NUB1L binds to FAT10 much 
stronger than to NEDD8 and that NEDD8 cannot compete with FAT10 for NUB1L 
binding. The interaction of FAT10 and NUB1L is specific as green fluorescent 
fusion proteins containing ubiquitin or SUMO-1 do not bind to NUB1L. The 
coexpression of NUB1L enhanced the degradation rate of FAT10 8-fold, whereas 
NEDD8 degradation was only accelerated 2-fold. Because NUB1 was shown to bind to 
the proteasome subunit RPN10 in vitro and to be contained in 26 S proteasome 
preparations, it may function as a linker that targets FAT10 for degradation by 
the proteasome.
