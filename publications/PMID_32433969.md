In human cells, the expression of ∼1,000 genes is modulated throughout the cell 
cycle. Although some of these genes are controlled by specific transcriptional 
programs, very little is known about their post-transcriptional regulation. 
Here, we analyze the expression signature associated with all 687 RNA-binding 
proteins (RBPs) and identify 39 that significantly correlate with cell cycle 
mRNAs. We find that NF45 and NF90 play essential roles in mitosis, and 
transcriptome analysis reveals that they are necessary for the expression of a 
subset of mitotic mRNAs. Using proteomics, we identify protein clusters 
associated with the NF45-NF90 complex, including components of Staufen-mediated 
mRNA decay (SMD). We show that depletion of SMD components increases the binding 
of mitotic mRNAs to the NF45-NF90 complex and rescues cells from mitotic 
defects. Together, our results indicate that the NF45-NF90 complex plays 
essential roles in mitosis by competing with the SMD machinery for a common set 
of mRNAs.
