Arabidopsis HY5 is a bZIP transcription factor that promotes photomorphogenesis. 
Previous studies suggested that COP1, a negative regulator of 
photomorphogenesis, directly interacts with nuclear HY5 and targets it for 
proteasome-mediated degradation. Light negatively regulates the nuclear level of 
COP1 and thus permits HY5 accumulation. Here we report that HY5 abundance peaks 
in early seedling development, consistent with its role in promoting 
photomorphogenesis. HY5 acts exclusively within a complex and exists in two 
isoforms, resulting from phosphorylation within its COP1 binding domain by a 
light- regulated kinase activity. Unphosphorylated HY5 shows stronger 
interaction with COP1, is the preferred substrate for degradation, has higher 
affinity to target promoters and is physiologically more active than the 
phosphorylated version. Therefore, HY5 phosphorylation provides an added level 
of light-mediated regulation of HY5 stability and activity besides nuclear COP1 
levels. Regulated HY5 phosphorylation not only provides abundant and 
physiologically more active unphosphorylated HY5 in the light, but also helps to 
maintain a small pool of less active phosphorylated HY5 in the dark, which could 
be essential for a rapid initial response during dark-to-light transition.

Abstract

Arabidopsis HY5 is a bZIP transcription factor that promotes photomorphogenesis. Previous studies suggested that COP1, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, directly interacts with nuclear HY5 and targets it for proteasome-mediated degradation. Light negatively regulates the nuclear level of COP1 and thus permits HY5 accumulation. Here we report that HY5 abundance peaks in early seedling development, consistent with its role in promoting photomorphogenesis. HY5 acts exclusively within a complex and exists in two isoforms, resulting from phosphorylation within its COP1 binding domain by a light- regulated kinase activity. Unphosphorylated HY5 shows stronger interaction with COP1, is the preferred substrate for degradation, has higher affinity to target promoters and is physiologically more active than the phosphorylated version. Therefore, HY5 phosphorylation provides an added level of light-mediated regulation of HY5 stability and activity besides nuclear COP1 levels. Regulated HY5 phosphorylation not only provides abundant and physiologically more active unphosphorylated HY5 in the light, but also helps to maintain a small pool of less active phosphorylated HY5 in the dark, which could be essential for a rapid initial response during dark-to-light transition.

Introduction

Recent years have seen considerable progress in dissecting the molecular pathways sensing the intensity, composition, photoperiod and direction of light in Arabidopsis ( Deng and Quail, 1999 ; Nagy and Schaefer, 2000 ; Neff et al., 2000 ). An interesting aspect of light signaling is the initial switch from dark-adapted development (skotomorphogenesis) to light-adapted development (photomorphogenesis). Skotomorphogenesis is a heterotrophic growth mode in which the seedling concentrates its resources to escape from darkness (such as underneath the soil). This is achieved by elongation of the hypocotyl towards the light, while cotyledon development is paused. Upon illumination, the seedling switches to photomorphogenesis, resulting in inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, opening and expansion of the cotyledons, and commencement of photosynthesis. A number of genes essential for this process have been identified and their activity is regulated by light signals perceived by multiple photoreceptors ( Deng and Quail, 1999 ; Nagy and Schafer, 2000 ; Neff et al., 2000 ). Two important components in this developmental switch are encoded by the HY5 and COP1 genes of Arabidopsis ( Osterlund et al., 1999 ).

HY5 encodes a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor and has a role in the promotion of photomorphogenesis as well as in the regulation of lateral root development ( Oyama et al., 1997 ). The activity of HY5 is largely controlled by COP1, a repressor of photomorphogenesis whose activity is abrogated by light. HY5 and COP1 interact both genetically and physically ( Ang and Deng, 1994 ; Ang et al., 1998 ), and this interaction negatively regulates HY5 activity. Recently we demonstrated that the abundance of HY5 protein inversely correlates with light intensity and is a critical regulatory point for HY5 activity ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ). The cellular HY5 level is regulated via a darkness-dependent degradation, probably mediated by the 26S proteasome. Degradation of HY5 in darkness requires its COP1 interaction domain, supporting the hypothesis that COP1 targets HY5 for degradation. Since COP1 displays a light-mediated nucleo-cytoplasmic repartitioning ( von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ), enriched in the nucleus in the dark and depleted from the nucleus in the light, light ultimately regulates the abundance of HY5 by regulating nuclear COP1 levels. However, it is not known whether there are additional built-in biochemical mechanisms to regulate the COP1 and HY5 interaction within the nucleus specifically.

The activities of several plant transcription factors implicated in light-regulated gene expression are modulated by phosphorylation ( Sarokin and Chua, 1992 ; Harter et al., 1994 ; Marechal et al., 1999 ). In particular, some Arabidopsis factors appear to be regulated by casein kinaseÂ II (CKII) ( Klimczak et al., 1995 ; Sugano et al., 1998 , 1999 ), a ubiquitous tetrameric serine/threonine kinase composed of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits ( Klimczak et al., 1992 ). Recently, the influence of CKII on light-regulated gene expression has been demonstrated more directly. Overexpression of a regulatory subunit known to interact with circadian clock regulators disturbed the light period-driven oscillation of their target genes ( Sugano et al., 1999 ). Antisense inhibition of the catalytic subunit of CKII likewise disturbed light-regulated transcription of well characterized light-responsive genes ( Lee et al., 1999 ). Since a well conserved putative CKII phosphorylation site is located in the N-terminus of HY5 ( Oyama et al., 1997 ), it is of interest to evaluate a possible role of phosphorylation in regulating HY5 abundance and activity. In this manuscript, we provide evidence that HY5 is indeed a likely target of CKII. We show that HY5 is part of a protein complex in vivo , and exists in two differentially phosphorylated isoforms. Our data suggest that HY5 phosphorylation indeed plays a key role in this light-regulated developmental switch.
