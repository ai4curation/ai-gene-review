We have determined the organization and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding 
the human T cell surface glycoprotein CD8 alpha. This gene spans approximately 8 
kb and is organized into six exons which encode separate functional domains of 
the protein. Exon 1 encodes the 5' untranslated region and leader peptide, exon 
II the Ig V-like region, exon III the hinge-like region, exon IV the 
transmembrane domain, and exons V and VI the cytoplasmic tail. Alternative 
splicing that excludes nucleotide sequences from exon IV results in a transcript 
which encodes a secreted form of the protein. This transcript accounts for 
approximately 15% of the total CD8 alpha mRNA in human T cell leukemia lines and 
in normal human tissues. Secreted CD8 alpha protein can be detected in culture 
supernatants of T cell leukemia lines and PHA-stimulated PBMC by 
immunoprecipitation with the anti-CD8 alpha mAb OKT8 or with a polyclonal rabbit 
antiserum specific for the 28 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of CD8 alpha. The 
secreted CD8 alpha protein forms homodimers; when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the 
protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 27 or 54 kDa under reducing 
or non-reducing conditions, respectively. Human secreted CD8 alpha may serve an 
immunoregulatory role for the interactions of T cells with their targets in 
vivo.
