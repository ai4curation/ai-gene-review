In the disease cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common mutation delF508 results in 
endoplasmic reticulum retention of misfolded CF gene proteins (CFTR). We show 
that the alpha-1,2-glucosidase inhibitor miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, 
NB-DNJ) prevents delF508-CFTR/calnexin interaction and restores cAMP-activated 
chloride current in epithelial CF cells. Moreover, miglustat rescues a mature 
and functional delF508-CFTR in the intestinal crypts of ileal mucosa from 
delF508 mice. Since miglustat is an orally active orphan drug (Zavesca) 
prescribed for the treatment of Gaucher disease, our findings provide the basis 
for future clinical evaluation of miglustat in CF patients.

Abstract

Over
the past few years, l -iminosugars have
revealed attractive
pharmacological properties for managing rare diseases including Cystic
Fibrosis (CF). The iminosugar N -butyl- l -deoxynojirimycin
( l -NBDNJ, ent - 1 ), prepared
by a carbohydrate-based route, was herein evaluated for its anti-inflammatory
and anti-infective potential in models of CF lung disease infection.
A significant decrease in the bacterial load in the airways was observed
in the murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic infection in the presence of l -NBDNJ, also accompanied
by a modest reduction of inflammatory cells. Mechanistic insights
into the observed activity revealed that l -NBDNJ interferes
with the expression of proteins regulating cytoskeleton assembly and
organization of the host cell, downregulates the main virulence factors
of P. aeruginosa involved in the host
response, and affects pathogen adhesion to human cells. These findings
along with the observation of the absence of an in vitro bacteriostatic/bactericidal action of l -NBDNJ suggest the
potential use of this glycomimetic as an antivirulence agent in the
management of CF lung disease.

Discussion

Over
the past years, the therapeutic potential
of iminosugars in
CF has been investigated either for their use as correctors of defective
CFTR mutants or as anti-inflammatory agents for the symptomatic treatment
of CF lung disease with the drug d -NBDNJ as the first candidate
to be evaluated. 18 In this context, we
recently highlighted the anti-inflammatory properties of an unnatural
mirror image of d -NBDNJ, i.e. , l -NBDNJ and its congeners revealing their ability in vitro to reduce the inflammatory response to P. aeruginosa . This effect was validated in vivo for l -NBDNJ in a murine model of P. aeruginosa acute infection pointing out its ability to significantly reduce
the recruitment of neutrophils in BALF of infected mice without increasing
the bacterial load at a lower dosage than in its enantiomer d -NBDNJ. 35 Moreover, an interesting antibacterial
activity was also observed for some derivatives of this class of glycomimetics. 50 On this basis, in this work, we further evaluated
the therapeutic potential of l -NBDNJ as an anti-inflammatory/antibacterial
agent for application in CF lung disease treatment. Herein, the effect
of l -NBDNJ was evaluated in a murine model of P. aeruginosa chronic infection that mimics the advanced
stage of CF lung disease, 38 revealing a
dose-dependent tendency to reduce the neutrophils recruited in the
airways of mice. This action was accompanied by an unexpected significant
decrease in the level of bacteria recovered in the lung along with
an increase in the bacterial clearance. These findings suggested a
potential anti-infective effect of l -NBDNJ associated with
a modulation of pulmonary inflammation. The action of l -NBDNJ
on the production of inflammatory mediators and hydrolase activity
in the lung of infected mice was also studied, showing no significant
changes in cytokine/chemokine levels, as determined by both immunoassays
and proteomic studies. Regarding hydrolase activity, our previous in vitro data on the cell lysate revealed that l -NBDNJ exhibited a selective inhibitory activity toward NLGase, an
important player in the regulation of SL homeostasis. 35 From in vivo studies carried out herein,
two different outcomes were highlighted. The activity of the major
glycohydrolases involved in sphingolipid metabolism was significantly
reduced, even if to a slight extent, in the acute phase of infection
by treatment with l- NBDNJ, whereas the level of GCase activity
was increased. These effects were lost when lung samples from chronically
infected mice were analyzed. Different results obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies are not surprising,
since the metabolic fate and compartmentalization of the molecule
administered to living tissues are unknown. Future analyses will therefore
be aimed at studying the role of l -NBDNJ in the control of
the inflammatory response in CF through modulation of the hydrolases
involved in sphingolipid (SL) metabolism.

The observed in vivo antibacterial activity prompted
us to carry out further experiments that could be useful to elucidate
the mechanism of action with which this molecule acts. Indeed, there
are only few examples of l -iminosugars endowed of antimicrobial
properties, 50 , 51 even for the most well-known d -iminosugars, for which there are no clear indications about
the molecular targets involved.

In this context, an untargeted
proteomic approach has been chosen
as this type of analysis gave a broader view of the changes, induced
by the drug treatment, in the relative abundances of the totality
of proteins in the sample. Data obtained from proteomic analysis of
mouse lung homogenate following the infection with P. aeruginosa revealed a marked dysregulation of
many metabolic pathways compared to those from naïve mice.
Some of the analyzed pathways as those affecting the cytoskeleton
assembly and organization were restored almost to the control level
following the treatment with l -NBDNJ. Particularly, myosins,
actins, and troponins were strongly downregulated in the vehicle,
whereas their expression was reestablished by l -NBDNJ administration,
thus suggesting that our compound could act by contrasting the bacterial-induced
tissue damage. Furthermore, we also performed in vitro studies to assess the effect of l -NBDNJ on P. aeruginosa MDR-RP73 and other clinical isolates.
As highlighted by MIC values, l -NBDNJ was not able to inhibit
the growth of P. aeruginosa , thus excluding
any bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity. Similarly, no inhibition
of biofilm formation was observed. On these bases, to explain the
observed in vivo anti-infective activity, we reasoned
whether an antivirulence activity of l -NBDNJ could be invoked
thanks to which only virulence-associated traits are targeted without
interfering with bacterial survival or fitness. RT-qPCR analysis revealed
that l -NBDNJ was able to downmodulate P. aeruginosa virulence factors involved in the host response, suggesting it could
facilitate the key host defense mechanism playing a protective role
against bacterial attack. Indeed, after treatment with l -NBDNJ,
we observed a significant reduction of gene expression of aprA , encoding for alkaline protease, a zinc-dependent metalloprotease,
that inactivates C1q, C2, and C3 complement system components and
cytokines as interferon-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α, useful to
bacteria to escape from phagocytes. 52 , 53 The secretion
of alkaline protease also reduced airway surface liquid volume and
mucociliary clearance of pulmonary bacteria. 54 Furthermore, in pwCF, the decrease in sputum alkaline protease titer
has been correlated with an improvement in clinical prognosis. Another
relevant virulence factor in pwCF correlated with a worsening prognosis
is the cyanide production, a potent poison that can inhibit the respiratory
electron transport chain and several metalloenzymes ( e.g. , catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase) of eukaryotic cells. 55 We have found that MDR-RP73 cells treated with l -NBDNJ expressed 5-fold lower levels of the hcnA gene, encoding hydrogen cyanide synthase, compared to nontreated
cells. Therefore, the reduction of cyanide production could improve
lung function by limiting tissue destruction. Moreover, P. aeruginosa uses a large repertoire of exoenzymes
to cause the disease. 56 Indeed, high concentrations
of the greenish-blue pigment pyocyanin, encoded by the phzA gene and involved in neutrophil apoptosis, 57 assist P. aeruginosa to evade the
immune response, causing long periods of pulmonary exacerbation in
pwCF. 58 After treatment with l -NBDNJ, the expression of this gene decreased 2.5-fold. Also, l -NBDNJ treatment resulted in the downregulation of pyoverdine
gene ( pvdA ), the major fluorescent yellow-green siderophore
produced and secreted by P. aeruginosa , that provides the bacterium with iron during infection. 59 The RT-qPCR results also revealed that three
toxic effectors injected via T3SS genes were significantly
downregulated upon l -NBDNJ exposure, namely, exoS , exoT , and exoY . These cytotoxins
can cause cell death and also affect host defense by blocking phagocytosis
and bacterial clearance. 60 ExoS is the
main effector protein involved in the escape of P.
aeruginosa from the phagosome to the cytoplasm and
is required for macrophage lysis. 61 Both
ExoS and ExoT also promote bacterial survival in neutrophils favoring P. aeruginosa persistence in host tissues. 62 ExoY inhibits the expression of proinflammatory
genes including cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators
during P. aeruginosa infection. 63 In addition, these exoenzymes play a key role
in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infection by interfering with cytoskeletal regulation. Particularly,
they are known to target cytoskeleton components of host cells causing
morphological changes and leading to loss of barrier integrity. 64 The downregulation of exoS , exoT , and exoY genes achieved after l -NBDNJ treatment could therefore reduce bacterial-induced tissue
damage. These results are in agreement with those obtained by proteomic
analysis, showing a beneficial effect by l -NBDNJ on the regulation
of metabolic paths involved in cytoskeleton assembly and organization.
In addition, a decreased adherence efficiency of P.
aeruginosa to host cells was also induced by l -NBDNJ that, together with the antivirulence effect, could contribute
to explain the anti-infective activity observed in vivo in the absence of a bacteriostatic/bactericidal effect in
vitro . As many glycomimetics have shown to be able to reduce
pathogen adhesion to the host cell, 65 , 66 acting directly
against the pathogen itself or the host cell, even for l -NBDNJ
a possible role as antiadhesive agent could be recognized as responsible
of the observed reduction in virulence factors. Further adherence
experiments could be helpful to clarify the exact mechanism of action.

Eventually, based on previous reports on d -NBDNJ, 20 , 21 we also considered the possibility that l -NBDNJ is endowed
with a CFTR corrector activity, i.e. , the ability
to promote F508del-CFTR escape from degradation and to promote its
trafficking to the plasma membrane. We found no effect with l -NBDNJ alone. A modest effect on CFTR rescue was only observed when l -NBDNJ was tested in combination with VX-809, a known F508del-CFTR
corrector. 67

Conclusions

Our
previous investigations highlighted
the potential anti-inflammatory
properties of l -NBDNJ in murine models of P. aeruginosa acute infection; instead, following
the current study, the same iminosugar exhibited a promising antibacterial
effect in models of chronic infection. Particularly, the synthesis
of l -NBDNJ has been herein realized by a carbohydrate-based
route, and in vitro and in vivo assays
have been carried out to assess the anti-inflammatory/antibacterial
activity and to provide mechanistic insights into the observed activity.
In our opinion, as bacterial growth or survival was not affected in vitro by treatment with l -NBDNJ, a bacteriostatic
or bactericidal action could be excluded. On the other hand, l -NBDNJ was able to interfere with the metabolic paths involved in
cytoskeleton assembly and organization of the host cell, downregulate
the main virulence factors of P. aeruginosa involved in the host response, and affect pathogen adhesion to human
cells, thus outlining a possible role of l -NBDNJ as a novel
antivirulence agent. Further studies will be carried out by RT-qPCR
and proteomic experiments to deeply evaluate the gene and protein
expression changes induced by l -NBDNJ in vivo models of P. aeruginosa infection.
These data and those obtained so far could concur to validate a possible
employment of l -NBDNJ as an alternative candidate to treat
drug-resistant bacteria and infection states for which no therapeutic
solutions are still available.
