Phytochrome A (phyA) is the primary photoreceptor mediating deetiolation under 
far-red (FR) light, whereas phyB predominantly regulates light responses in red 
light. SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA1) forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with 
CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), which is responsible for the degradation 
of various photomorphogenesis-promoting factors, resulting in desensitization to 
light signaling. However, the role of phyB in FR light signaling and the 
regulatory pathway from light-activated phytochromes to the COP1-SPA1 complex 
are largely unknown. Here, we confirm that PHYB overexpression causes an 
etiolation response with reduced ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) accumulation under 
FR light. Notably, phyB exerts its nuclear activities and promotes seedling 
etiolation in both the presence and absence of phyA in response to FR light. 
PhyB acts upstream of SPA1 and is functionally dependent on it in FR light 
signaling. PhyB interacts and forms a protein complex with SPA1, enhancing its 
nuclear accumulation under FR light. During the dark-to-FR transition, phyB is 
rapidly imported into the nucleus and facilitates nuclear SPA1 accumulation. 
These findings support the notion that phyB plays a role in repressing FR light 
signaling. Activity modulation of the COP1-SPA E3 complex by light-activated 
phytochromes is an effective and pivotal regulatory step in light signaling.
