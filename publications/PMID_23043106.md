BACKGROUND: Laminar flow protects from atherosclerosis in endothelium.
RESULTS: Laminar flow induces Nrf2 activation dependent on ERK5 activation, 
leading to up-regulation of downstream genes of Nrf2.
CONCLUSION: ERK5 requires Nrf2 activation to exert cytoprotective effect on 
HUVEC. ERK5 inhibitor BIX02189 regulates Nrf2 activation in vivo.
SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying ERK5 as a molecular target for regulating 
flow-mediating Nrf2-dependent gene expression may have significant therapeutic 
potential for treating atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is often observed in 
areas where disturbed flow is formed, whereas atheroprotective region is found 
in areas where steady laminar flow is developed. It has been reported that some 
genes activated by blood flow play important roles in vascular function and 
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) 
has been reported to regulate endothelial integrity and protect from vascular 
dysfunction and disease under laminar flow. Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and 
NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) are major transcriptional factors that contribute 
to anti-atherogenic responses under laminar flow. Implication of ERK5 in laminar 
flow-mediated regulation of KLF2-dependent gene has been established, whereas 
the role of ERK5 in laminar flow-mediated activation of Nrf2 pathway has not 
been addressed yet. In this study, we found that the blockage of ERK5 either by 
genetic depletion with siRNA or by biochemical inactivation with a specific 
chemical compound inhibited laminar flow-induced up-regulation of Nrf2-dependent 
gene expressions, whereas activation of ERK5 increased transcriptional activity 
and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which suggests that ERK5 mediates laminar 
flow-induced up-regulation of Nrf2-dependent gene expression. Further functional 
studies showed that ERK5 provides protection against oxidative stress-induced 
cytotoxicity dependent on Nrf2. Molecular interaction between ERK5 and Nrf2 was 
further induced by laminar flow. Finally, flow-dependent nuclear localization of 
Nrf2 was inhibited by BIX02189, a specific inhibitor of MEK5, in aorta of mice 
in vivo. Collectively, these data demonstrate that laminar flow-induced 
activation of ERK5-Nrf2 signal pathway plays a critical role for 
anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanism in endothelial cells.
