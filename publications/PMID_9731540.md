Desmin-related myopathies (DRM) are inherited neuromuscular disorders 
characterized by adult onset and delayed accumulation of aggregates of desmin, a 
protein belonging to the type III intermediate filament family, in the 
sarcoplasma of skeletal and cardiac muscles. In this paper, we have mapped the 
locus for DRM in a large French pedigree to a 26-cM interval in chromosome 
11q21-23. This region contains the alphaB-crystallin gene (CRYAB), a candidate 
gene encoding a 20-kD protein that is abundant in lens and is also present in a 
number of non-ocular tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle. 
AlphaB-crystallin is a member of the small heat shock protein (shsp) family and 
possesses molecular chaperone activity. We identified an R120G missense mutation 
in CRYAB that co-segregates with the disease phenotype in this family. Muscle 
cell lines transfected with the mutant CRYAB cDNA showed intracellular 
aggregates that contain both desmin and alphaB-crystallin as observed in muscle 
fibers from DRM patients. These results are the first to identify a defect in a 
molecular chaperone as a cause for an inherited human muscle disorder.
