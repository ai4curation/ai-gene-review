Defining the links between cell division and DNA replication is essential for 
understanding normal cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. In this report we 
explore the effect of phosphorylation of cell division cycle 6 (Cdc6), a DNA 
replication initiation factor, by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) on the regulation of 
chromosomal segregation. In mitosis, the phosphorylation of Cdc6 was highly 
increased, in correlation with the level of Plk1, and conversely, Cdc6 is 
hypophosphorylated in Plk1-depleted cells, although cyclin A- and cyclin 
B1-dependent kinases are active. Binding between Cdc6 and Plk1 occurs through 
the polo-box domain of Plk1, and Cdc6 is phosphorylated by Plk1 on T37. 
Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that Cdc6 and Plk1 colocalize to the central 
spindle in anaphase. Expression of T37V mutant of Cdc6 (Cdc6-TV) induces 
binucleated cells and incompletely separated nuclei. Wild-type Cdc6 but not 
Cdc6-TV binds cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Expression of wild-type Plk1 but 
not kinase-defective mutant promotes the binding of Cdc6 to Cdk1. Cells 
expressing wild-type Cdc6 display lower Cdk1 activity and higher separase 
activity than cells expressing Cdc6-TV. These results suggest that Plk1-mediated 
phosphorylation of Cdc6 promotes the interaction of Cdc6 and Cdk1, leading to 
the attenuation of Cdk1 activity, release of separase, and subsequent anaphase 
progression.
