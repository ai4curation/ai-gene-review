Protein interaction maps have provided insight into the relationships among the 
predicted proteins of model organisms for which a genome sequence is available. 
These maps have been useful in generating potential interaction networks, which 
have confirmed the existence of known complexes and pathways and have suggested 
the existence of new complexes and or crosstalk between previously unlinked 
pathways. However, the generation of such maps is costly and labor intensive. 
Here, we investigate the extent to which a protein interaction map generated in 
one species can be used to predict interactions in another species.
