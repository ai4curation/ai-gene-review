In all eukaryotic organisms, inappropriate firing of replication origins during 
the G2 phase of the cell cycle is suppressed by cyclin-dependent kinases. 
Multicellular eukaryotes contain a second putative inhibitor of re-replication 
called geminin. Geminin is believed to block binding of the mini-chromosome 
maintenance (MCM) complex to origins of replication, but the mechanism of this 
inhibition is unclear. Here we show that geminin interacts tightly with Cdt1, a 
recently identified replication initiation factor necessary for MCM loading. The 
inhibition of DNA replication by geminin that is observed in cell-free DNA 
replication extracts is reversed by the addition of excess Cdt1. In the normal 
cell cycle, Cdt1 is present only in G1 and S, whereas geminin is present in S 
and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Together, these results suggest that geminin 
inhibits inappropriate origin firing by targeting Cdt1.
