The p53 tumor suppressor induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis in response to 
DNA damage. Because these functions are achieved largely by the transcriptional 
properties of p53, nuclear localization of the protein is essential. Indeed, the 
tumors with aberrant cytoplasmic localization of wild-type p53 often exhibit an 
impaired response to DNA damage. In this study, we report that Thr-55 
phosphorylation induces the association of p53 with the nuclear export factor 
CRM1, leading to p53 nuclear export. We further show that MDM2 also promotes the 
CRM1-p53 association and Thr-55 phosphorylation is required for this process. 
Interestingly, inhibition of Thr-55 phosphorylation by a dietary flavonoid, 
apigenin, specifically blocks the CRM1-p53 association, restores p53 nuclear 
localization, and sensitizes tumor cells with cytoplasm localized wild-type p53 
to DNA damage. These data provide insights into the regulation of p53 nuclear 
localization by post-translational modification and suggest an avenue for 
targeted therapy for cancers caused by aberrant cytoplasm localization of 
wild-type p53.

Abstract

The p53 tumor suppressor induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Because these functions are achieved largely by the transcriptional properties of p53, nuclear localization of the protein is essential. Indeed, the tumors with aberrant cytoplasmic localization of wild-type p53 often exhibit an impaired response to DNA damage. In this study, we report that Thr-55 phosphorylation induces the association of p53 with the nuclear export factor CRM1, leading to p53 nuclear export. We further show that MDM2 also promotes the CRM1-p53 association and Thr-55 phosphorylation is required for this process. Interestingly, inhibition of Thr-55 phosphorylation by a dietary flavonoid, apigenin, specifically blocks the CRM1-p53 association, restores p53 nuclear localization, and sensitizes tumor cells with cytoplasm localized wild-type p53 to DNA damage. These data provide insights into the regulation of p53 nuclear localization by post-translational modification and suggest an avenue for targeted therapy for cancers caused by aberrant cytoplasm localization of wild-type p53.

Discussion

p53 is diffusely distributed in normal cells and, upon DNA damage, p53 translocates to the nucleus and functions to activate target genes. In view of the importance of nuclear localization of p53 in tumor suppression, it is striking that inhibition of Thr-55 phosphorylation restores p53 nuclear localization. Furthermore, Thr-55 phosphorylation induces the association of p53 with the nuclear exporter CRM1, thus providing new insight into the regulation of p53 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.

One of the most important regulators of p53 is MDM2, a ring domain E3 ligase that ubiquitinates p53, leading to p53 degradation and cytoplasmic localization. MDM2 has been shown to mediate monoubiquitination of p53 in the nucleus, which promotes p53 nuclear export by unmasking the NES of p53 ( 20 , 23 , 28 , 29 ). Our studies establish that Thr-55 phosphorylation is required for MDM2-induced p53-CRM1 interaction and nuclear export. This is perhaps not surprising because Thr-55 phosphorylation has been shown to promote the p53-MDM2 interaction ( 8 ), which could lead to monoubiquitination of p53 and exposure of its NES. Interestingly, however, our data also suggest that Thr-55 phosphorylation enhances the p53-CRM1 interaction independent of MDM2. Thus, Thr-55 phosphorylation may play a dual role in access of p53 to the nuclear export machinery ( Fig. 5 ). In the absence of MDM2, Thr-55 phosphorylation enhances the p53-CRM1 interaction, which leads to nuclear export of p53 in Mdm2-null cells. Because monoubiquitination of p53 has been shown to play a role in unmasking the p53 NES, other E3s may monoubiquitinate p53 in this process. In the presence of MDM2, however, Thr-55 phosphorylation probably largely affects the p53-MDM2 interaction, resulting in monoubiquitination of p53. In this setting, monoubiquitinated p53 unmasks its NES, binds to CRM1 and dissociates from MDM2 ( 29 ). Because MDM2 significantly enhances the p53-CRM1 interaction, this second mechanism probably represents a major pathway for nuclear export of p53 when MDM2 is present in the cell.

Finally emerging evidence has begun to indicate that natural compounds play an important in cancer prevention and treatment. In the present study, we demonstrate that apigenin completely restores p53 nuclear localization in neuroblastoma cells through inhibition of Thr-55 phosphorylation. Apigenin is a natural flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables and has been shown to have antitumor effects in several human tumor cell lines ( 30 ). In fact, a recent study suggests that apigenin induces apoptosis of the human neuroblastoma cells and inhibits neuroblastoma cell xenograft tumor growth in a nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model ( 31 ). Despite the progress that has been made in identifying the significance of apigenin in tumor suppression, little is known about its molecular targets. Our study establishes that apigenin specifically restores p53 nuclear localization and thus provides a molecular basis of using apigenin for targeting cancers caused by abnormal cytoplasm localization of wild-type p53. It is generally thought that the key to effective therapies is the identification of drugs that affect cancer cell but dispensable to normal cells. In this respect, apigenin has been shown to neither inhibit survival of primary sympathetic neurons ( 31 ) nor induce apoptosis of normal human cell line IMR90 ( Fig. 4 ), suggesting that perhaps this dietary flavonoid is not toxic to nontransformed cells and thus could be used to specifically sensitize cancers caused by abnormal cytoplasm localization of wild-type p53.
