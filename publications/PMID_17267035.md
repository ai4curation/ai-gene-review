The lifespan of dendritic cells (DCs) can potentially influence immune responses 
by affecting the duration of DCs in stimulating lymphocytes. Significant 
differences in the lifespan have been reported for various DC subsets, however, 
the molecular mechanisms for regulating such differences between DC subsets 
remain unclear. In this study, we compared the apoptosis signaling molecules in 
two major DC subjects, the myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). We 
observed a lower ratio between anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and pro-apoptotic 
Bax/Bak in shorter-lived myeloid DCs (mDCs) than in longer-lived plasmacytoid 
DCs (pDCs) or T cells. Transfection with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL prolonged the survival 
of mouse primary mDCs in vitro, while deletion of Bcl-2 accelerated DC turnover 
in vivo. In addition, the ratios between anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and 
pro-apoptotic Bax/Bak could be regulated in DCs. Signaling from toll-like 
receptors (TLRs) up-regulated Bcl-xL and improved DC survival. Our data suggest 
that differential expression of apoptosis signaling molecules regulates the 
lifespan of different DC subsets.
