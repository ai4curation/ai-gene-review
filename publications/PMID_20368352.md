The ataxia telangiectasia group D-complementing (ATDC) gene product, also known 
as TRIM29, is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. ATDC has 
been proposed to form homo- or heterodimers and to bind nucleic acids. In cell 
cultures, ATDC expression leads to rapid growth and resistance to ionizing 
radiation (IR), whereas silencing of ATDC expression decreases growth rates and 
increases sensitivity to IR. Although ATDC is overexpressed in many human 
cancers, the biological significance of ATDC overexpression remains obscure. We 
report here that ATDC increases cell proliferation via inhibition of p53 nuclear 
activities. ATDC represses the expression of p53-regulated genes, including p21 
and NOXA. Mechanistically, ATDC binds p53, and this interaction is potentially 
fine-tuned by posttranslational acetylation of lysine 116 on ATDC. The 
association of p53 and ATDC results in p53 sequestration outside of the nucleus. 
Together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into the function of 
ATDC and offer an explanation for how ATDC promotes cancer cell proliferation.

Abstract

The ataxia telangiectasia group D-complementing ( ATDC ) gene product, also known as TRIM29, is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. ATDC has been proposed to form homo- or heterodimers and to bind nucleic acids. In cell cultures, ATDC expression leads to rapid growth and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR), whereas silencing of ATDC expression decreases growth rates and increases sensitivity to IR. Although ATDC is overexpressed in many human cancers, the biological significance of ATDC overexpression remains obscure. We report here that ATDC increases cell proliferation via inhibition of p53 nuclear activities. ATDC represses the expression of p53-regulated genes, including p21 and NOXA . Mechanistically, ATDC binds p53, and this interaction is potentially fine-tuned by posttranslational acetylation of lysine 116 on ATDC. The association of p53 and ATDC results in p53 sequestration outside of the nucleus. Together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into the function of ATDC and offer an explanation for how ATDC promotes cancer cell proliferation.

DISCUSSION

The tripartite motif protein family (also known as the RBCC family) consists of proteins characterized by three zinc-binding domains, a RING finger, a B-box type 1, and a B-Box type 2, followed by a coiled-coil region ( 5 , 42 , 43 , 47 ). Although the functions of the TRIM domain and the biological functions of many TRIM proteins are still not well understood, we now know that some TRIM proteins are implicated in viral replication, signal transduction, development, and various human diseases, particularly cancer.

ATDC (TRIM29) possesses a B-box type 1, a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil domain, but not a RING finger. It was initially cloned based on its ability to complement the IR sensitivity of an AT cell line from complementation group D. However, later studies showed that the product of ATDC only complements survival and not radioresistant DNA synthesis of AT cells. The discovery of the AT mutated (ATM) gene dispelled the existence of more than one complementation group in AT disease and further proved that ATDC is not involved in the AT disorder. Therefore, the function of the ATDC protein remained an enigma. It was proposed that ATDC might act as a transcriptional regulatory factor ( 29 ) but, thus far, there is no evidence that ATDC can directly activate or repress transcription. Also, ATDC has been shown to interact with the intermediate-filament protein vimentin, and with a protein kinase C substrate and inhibitor, but the significance of these interactions is not clear ( 6 ). In this present study, our data confirm that ATDC is a prosurvival protein and clearly show that overexpression of ATDC can confer a growth advantage to cells. Our data also confirm and further extend previous observations that ATDC possesses oncogenic activity ( 59 ). Mechanistically, we found that ATDC inhibits expression of p53-regulated genes. By opposing the functions of p53-mediated p21 and NOXA activation, ATDC may direct the release of G 1 -phase cell cycle arrest and also prevent apoptosis.

Our finding that ATDC associates with p53 and that the presence of ATDC (either naturally or by ectopic expression) results in the localization of p53 to the cytoskeleton is reminiscent of the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 by the Parc protein ( 36 ). Although Parc is a cytoplasmic ubiquitin ligase, it does not induce significant ubiquitination of p53 or p53 degradation. Likewise, overexpression of ATDC has no effect on the expression or stability of p53. Rather, its chief function appears to be similar to that of Parc, i.e., to regulate p53 subcellular localization and, consequently, to antagonize the nuclear functions of p53.

Posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation of p53, have profound effects on p53 function ( 58 ). Acetylation of p53 destabilizes the p53-Mdm2 interaction and, therefore, is indispensable for p53 activation ( 53 ). Currently, it is unknown whether acetylation of p53 controls the p53-ATDC association. However, our data indicate that acetylation/deacetylation of ATDC K116 is a key determinant for the p53-ATDC interaction and may be an alternative pathway of fine-tuning p53 activity. Thus, posttranslational acetylation appears to be a common theme by which the interaction of p53 with other proteins is regulated.

The discovery here that ATDC prevents p53 nuclear localization provides an answer to the long-awaited question of how ATDC complements the IR sensitivity of AT cells without altering radioresistant DNA synthesis. Nuclear localization of p53 plays an essential role, not only in its proapoptotic function, but it also might be crucial in the tumor suppressor function of p53. Dysregulation of p53 cellular localization may be a key mechanism of p53 inactivation. Like ATDC, p53 has been reported to associate with cytoplasmic proteins, including the intermediate filament protein vimentin and microtubules ( 16 , 24 ). Already, there is reason to believe that p53 can inactivate the transformational activity of ATDC. Work is now under way to determine whether ATDC accelerates tumorigenesis through inactivation of the p53 protein.

Finally, although our results fit well with earlier observations that ATDC is overexpressed in many cancers and may explain how ATDC might promote cancer cell proliferation, there are certain cancers where expression of ATDC appears to be reduced ( 28 , 32 , 35 , 51 , 64 , 67 ). Also, at least in one study, suppressed ATDC expression has been shown to associate with malignant phenotypes in some cancer cells ( 20 ). Further work will be required to clarify how ATDC might function in opposing pathways and to completely understand how ATDC contributes to changes in tumor cell growth and metastasis.
