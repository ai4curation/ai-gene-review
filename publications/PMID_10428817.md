We previously reported that TIP49a is a novel mammalian DNA helicase showing 
structural similarity with the bacterial recombination factor RuvB. In this 
study, we isolated a new TIP49a-related gene, termed TIP49b, from human and 
yeast cells. TIP49b also resembled RuvB, thus suggesting that TIP49a and TIP49b 
are included in a gene family. Like TIP49a, TIP49b was abundantly expressed in 
the testis and thymus. Enzyme assays revealed that TIP49b was an single-stranded 
DNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Most of the enzymatic 
properties of TIP49b were the same as those of TIP49a, whereas the polarity of 
TIP49b DNA helicase activity (5' to 3') was the opposite to that of TIP49a. 
TIP49b and TIP49a bound to each other and were included in the same complex of 
approximately 700 kDa in a cell. We found that TIP49b was an essential gene for 
the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as is the TIP49a gene, suggesting that 
TIP49b does not complement the TIP49a function and vice versa. From these 
observations, we suggest that TIP49b plays an essential role in the cellular 
processes involved in DNA metabolism.
