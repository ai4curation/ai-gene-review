MEN1 is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a 610 amino acid nuclear protein 
(menin) of previously unknown function. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with 
menin as the bait, we have identified the transcription factor JunD as a direct 
menin-interacting partner. Menin did not interact directly with other Jun and 
Fos family members. The menin-JunD interaction was confirmed in vitro and in 
vivo. Menin repressed transcriptional activation mediated by JunD fused to the 
Gal4 DNA-binding domain from a Gal4 responsive reporter, or by JunD from an 
AP1-responsive reporter. Several naturally occurring and clustered MEN1 missense 
mutations disrupted menin interaction with JunD. These observations suggest that 
menin's tumor suppressor function involves direct binding to JunD and inhibition 
of JunD activated transcription.
