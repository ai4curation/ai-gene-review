Islet1 (Isl1) belongs to the LIM homeodomain transcription factor family. Its 
roles in differentiation of motor neurons and organogenesis of pancreas and 
heart have been revealed. However, less is known about its regulatory mechanism 
and the target genes. In this study, we identified interactions between Isl1 and 
Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK), as well as signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (Stat)3, but not Stat1 and Stat5, in mammalian cells. We found 
that Isl1 not only forms a complex with Jak1 and Stat3 but also triggers the 
tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and its kinase activity, thereby elevating the 
tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding activity, and target gene expression of 
Stat3. In vivo, the tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 was colocalized with Isl1 in 
the nucleus of the mouse motor neurons in spinal cord after nerve injury. 
Correspondingly, electroporation of Isl1 and Stat3 into the neural tube of chick 
embryos resulted in the activation of a reporter gene expression controlled by a 
Stat3 regulatory sequence, and cotransfection of Isl1 and Stat3 promoted the 
proliferation of the mouse motor neuron cells. Our data suggest a novel role of 
Isl1 as an adaptor for Jak1 and Stat3 and reveal a possible functional link 
between LIM homeodomain transcription factors and the Jak-Stat pathway.
