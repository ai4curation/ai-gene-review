The retromer is a trimeric cargo-recognition protein complex composed of Vps26, 
Vps29 and Vps35 associated with protein trafficking within endosomes. Recently, 
a pathogenic point mutation within the Vps35 subunit (D620N) was linked to the 
manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated details 
underlying the molecular mechanism by which the D620N mutation in Vps35 
modulates retromer function, including examination of retromer's subcellular 
localization and its capacity to sort cargo. We show that expression of the 
PD-linked Vps35 D620N mutant redistributes retromer-positive endosomes to a 
perinuclear subcellular localization and that these endosomes are enlarged in 
both model cell lines and fibroblasts isolated from a PD patient. Vps35 D620N is 
correctly folded and binds Vps29 and Vps26A with the same affinity as wild-type 
Vps35. While PD-linked point mutant Vps35 D620N interacts with the 
cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), a known retromer 
cargo, we find that its expression disrupts the trafficking of cathepsin D, a 
CI-M6PR ligand and protease responsible for degradation of α-synuclein, a 
causative agent of PD. In summary, we find that the expression of Vps35 D620N 
leads to endosomal alterations and trafficking defects that may partly explain 
its action in PD.
