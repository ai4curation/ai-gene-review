Signals received at distal synapses of neurons must be conveyed to the nucleus 
to initiate the changes in transcription that underlie long-lasting synaptic 
plasticity. The presence of importin nuclear transporters and of select 
transcription factors at synapses raises the possibility that importins directly 
transport transcription factors from synapse to nucleus to modulate gene 
expression. Here, we show that cyclic AMP response element binding protein 2 
(CREB2)/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a transcriptional repressor 
that modulates long-term synaptic plasticity and memory, localizes to distal 
dendrites of rodent hippocampal neurons and neurites of Aplysia sensory neurons 
(SNs) and binds to specific importin alpha isoforms. Binding of CREB2 to 
importin alpha is required for its transport from distal dendrites to the soma 
and for its translocation into the nucleus. CREB2 accumulates in the nucleus 
during long-term depression (LTD) but not long-term potentiation of rodent 
hippocampal synapses, and during LTD but not long-term facilitation (LTF) of 
Aplysia sensory-motor synapses. Time-lapse microscopy of CREB2 tagged with a 
photoconvertible fluorescent protein further reveals retrograde transport of 
CREB2 from distal neurites to the nucleus of Aplysia SN during 
phenylalanine-methionine-arginine-phenylalanine-amide (FMRFamide)-induced LTD. 
Together, our findings indicate that CREB2 is a novel cargo of importin alpha 
that translocates from distal synaptic sites to the nucleus after stimuli that 
induce LTD of neuronal synapses.
