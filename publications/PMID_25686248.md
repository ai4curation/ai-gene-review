Selective macroautophagy is an important protective mechanism against diverse 
cellular stresses. In contrast to the well-characterized starvation-induced 
autophagy, the regulation of selective autophagy is largely unknown. Here, we 
demonstrate that Huntingtin, the Huntington disease gene product, functions as a 
scaffold protein for selective macroautophagy but it is dispensable for 
non-selective macroautophagy. In Drosophila, Huntingtin genetically interacts 
with autophagy pathway components. In mammalian cells, Huntingtin physically 
interacts with the autophagy cargo receptor p62 to facilitate its association 
with the integral autophagosome component LC3 and with Lys-63-linked 
ubiquitin-modified substrates. Maximal activation of selective autophagy during 
stress is attained by the ability of Huntingtin to bind ULK1, a kinase that 
initiates autophagy, which releases ULK1 from negative regulation by mTOR. Our 
data uncover an important physiological function of Huntingtin and provide a 
missing link in the activation of selective macroautophagy in metazoans.

Introduction

In macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), the material to be degraded (cargo) is first sequestered into a double membrane vesicle (autophagosome) that subsequently fuses with the lysosome1. Contrary to the “in bulk” engulfment of cytosolic material observed upon induction of autophagy by starvation1, most nutrient-independent stresses (i.e. proteotoxicity, lipotoxicy, organelle damage) activate selective autophagy in which only the altered cytosolic components are recognized by cargo adaptors such as p62/SQSTM12, and then targeted for lysosomal degradation3, 4. Despite a growing appreciation of the role of selective autophagy in intracellular quality control and cellular stress response, its regulation and how the autophagy machinery is recruited to the cargo for autophagosome formation are not well-defined. In yeast, scaffold proteins such as Atg11 facilitate the effective recruitment of cargos into autophagosome through their interaction with cargo receptors5. However, few such scaffolds have been identified in mammals6. A second difference between starvation-induced “in bulk” autophagy and selective autophagy is their regulation. Activation of autophagy upon starvation is attained through repression of the master nutrient sensor mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which promotes release and activation of an autophagy initiation kinase ULK1. In contrast, selective autophagy can be activated independently of mTORC1 through relatively poorly understood mechanisms.

Huntingtin (Htt), the gene mutated in Huntington’s disease (HD), encodes a large protein with many proposed functions7–11. We previously reported defective autophagy in HD affected neurons manifested by the presence of “empty autophagosomes” and suggestive of failure of cargo sequestration12. Here, we show that Htt positively modulates selective autophagy but not starvation-induced autophagy in fly and mammalian cells. Htt contributes to cargo recognition by facilitating binding of p62 to ubiquitin (Ub)-K63 modified cargos and to LC3, an integral autophagosome component. In addition, non-overlapping interaction of Htt with ULK1 promotes its activation by dissociation from the mTOR-ULK1 complex and subsequent initiation of selective autophagy. These data support a dual function of Htt as a scaffold in selective autophagy by promoting cargo recognition and autophagy initiation.

ResultsDrosophila huntingtin genetically interacts with autophagy pathway componentsHomozygous flies lacking its single htt homolog (dhttko) are fully viable with only mild phenotypes13. In a genetic screen for Htt’s physiological function, ectopic expression of a truncated form of microtubule-binding protein Tau (Tau-ΔC; truncated after V382) induced a prominent collapse of the thorax in dhttko flies due to severe underneath muscle loss (Fig. 1a7) not observed by Tau expression alone, and accelerated decline in mobility and life-span. These phenotypes were fully rescued by the dhtt genomic rescue transgene (“dhttRescue”)13 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figure 1a–c), suggesting that dhtt protects against Tau-induced pathogenic effects.Although heterozygous dhttko/+ flies expressing Tau (ATau; dhttko/+) appear normal, removing in these flies of a single copy of the fly LC3 gene, atg8a (atg8ad4 mutant)14 also induced collapsed thorax and muscle loss, which could be phenocopied by expressing Tau in homozygous atg8ad4−/− flies alone (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figure 1d). Four additional components of the early steps of the autophagy pathway, atg1 (ULK1), atg7 and atg13, and an adaptor for the selective recognition of autophagic cargo, Ref(2)P (p62)15, also exhibit strong genetic interactions with dhtt (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figure 1e). Consistent with its pivotal role in autophagy initiation1, loss of atg1 induced the strongest defect and Tau expression could induce a mild muscle loss phenotype even in heterozygous null atg1Δ3d (Fig. 1c). Collectively, these genetic interaction studies suggest a role of dhtt in autophagy.Drosophila huntingtin positively regulates autophagy in vivoUsing the mCherry-GFP-Atg8a fusion reporter to directly measure autophagic flux in adult dhttko−/− brains16, we found similar number of red fluorescent punctae (acidic autolysosomes originating from autophagosome/lysosome fusion) in young mutant and control flies, but the number of punctae was reduced in old dhttko−/− brains when compared to age-matched controls (Fig. 1d,e). Since we did not observe autophagosome accumulation (colocalized green and red puncta), we concluded that absence of dhtt in older animals is associated with reduced autophagosome formation. The fact that levels of Ref(2)P were significantly higher in old dhttko−/− brains compared to brains from age-matched wildtype control (Fig. 1f,g) suggested a possible preferential compromise in selective autophagy in these animals.Consistent with the role of basal selective autophagy in quality control in non-dividing cells17, we found that brains from 5 weeks old dhttko−/− contained almost double amount of ubiquitinated proteins, marker of quality control failure, than wildtype flies (Supplementary Fig 2a). Since genetic interaction analysis and specific ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) reporters all failed to reveal a functional link between dhtt and the UPS pathway (Supplementary Figure 2b–f), we propose that the defects in autophagic activity are the main cause of diminished quality control and increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in dhttko−/− mutants.Drosophila huntingtin is required for intracellular quality controlSelective autophagy is induced in response to proteotoxic stress. The truncated Tau-ΔC used in our genetic studies, is preferentially degraded through autophagy in cortical neurons18, serving as a model of proteotoxicity when ectopically expressed. We confirmed lower stability of Tau-ΔC compared to full-length Tau in wildtype flies (Supplementary Figure 3a) and in UPS mutants, but found significantly higher levels of Tau-ΔC when expressed in atg8a and in dhttko−/− mutant flies (Fig. 1h–j), suggesting that autophagy is essential for the clearance of Tau-ΔC also in flies and that dhtt plays a role in this clearance.In contrast, loss of dhtt did not affect flies’ adaptation to nutrient deprivation, which typically induces robust “in bulk” autophagy19. Fat bodies of early third instar larvae expressing mCherry-Atg8, where starvation-induced autophagy can be readily detected20, failed to reveal any significant difference between wildtype and dhttko−/− flies and they die at the same rate as wildtype flies when tested for starvation resistance (Supplementary Figure 2g–i). Thus, although dhtt is necessary for selective autophagy of toxic proteins such as Tau-ΔC, it is dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy in flies.Huntingtin’s function is conserved from flies to humansExpression of human Htt (hHtt) in dhttko−/− null rescued both the mobility and longevity defects of dhttko−/− mutants and partially rescued the Tau-induced morphological and behavioral defects of dhttko−/− flies (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figure 3b–f). hHtt also suppressed almost all the autophagic defects observed in dhttko−/−, including decreased levels of autolysosomes, increased levels of Ref(2)P and of total ubiquitinated proteins, and accumulation of ectopically expressed Tau-ΔC (Fig. 2b–e and Supplementary Figure 3g–i), suggesting that the involvement of dhtt in autophagy is functionally conserved. In fact, confluent mouse fibroblasts knocked down for Htt (Htt(−)) displayed significantly lower basal rates of long-lived proteins’ degradation than control cells, which were no longer evident upon chemical inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis or of macroautophagy, thus confirming an autophagic origin of the proteolytic defect (Fig. 2g,h). Htt(−) fibroblasts also displayed higher p62 levels and accumulate ubiquitin aggregates even in absence of a proteotoxic challenge (Fig. 2i,j). Similar to dhttko−/− flies, Htt knockdown in mammalian cells did not affect degradation of CL1-GFP (a UPS reporter), β-catenin (a UPS canonical substrate) or proteasome peptidase activities (Supplementary Figure 4a–c). Reduced autophagic degradation in Htt(−) cells was not due to a primary lysosomal defect, as depletion of Htt did not reduce lysosomal acidification, endo-lysosomal number (if anything, we observed an expansion of this compartment) or other lysosomal functions such as endocytosis (transferrin internalization) (Supplementary Figure 4d–h). In fact, analysis of the lysosomal degradation of LC3-II revealed that autophagic flux and autophagosome formation were preserved and even enhanced in Htt(−) fibroblasts at basal conditions (Fig. 2k,l).We have previously shown a similar apparent dichotomy - reduced autophagic degradation of cargo (long-lived proteins and p62) with normal or increased formation and clearance of LC3 positive autophagic vesicles - in cells from HD patients12. Since in this pathological setting, we observed an “empty autophagosome” phenotype resulting from defective cargo sequestration, we performed electron microscopy (EM). We found that the overall size and number of the autophagic/lysosomal compartments was expanded in Htt(−) fibroblasts under basal conditions but that, contrary to the organelles and electron-dense cargo noticeable in the vacuoles in the control cells, a larger fraction of the vesicular structures in Htt(−) fibroblasts lacked visible content or had a mixed cargo composition reflective of “in bulk” autophagy (Fig. 2m,n). Immunogold staining for LC3 confirmed the autophagic nature of the Htt(−) cells’ empty vesicles (Fig. 2o). Thus, similar to flies, Htt is also required for effective autophagy in mammals and its depletion affects the autophagic process early at the step of selective cargo recognition.Mammalian Huntingtin is required for selective autophagyIn light of the above observed role of Htt in autophagy under basal conditions, we then analyzed the requirement for Htt in autophagy activated in response to different cellular stressors, when only specific cytosolic cargo is degraded. The reduced rates of autophagic degradation of long-lived proteins observed in Htt(−) fibroblasts, become even more pronounced upon exposure to proteotoxic stress (inhibition of proteasome degradation), lipotoxic stress (oleic challenge) or the mitochondrial depolarizing agent FCCP (Fig. 3a). However, upon starvation (serum removal or incubation in nutrient-free media), control and Htt(−) fibroblasts displayed a similar increase in long lived proteins’ degradation and in fragmentation of GST-BHMT, a cargo-based end-point assay for autophagy21 (Fig. 3a,b). In contrast, accumulation of fragmented GST-BHMT was almost abolished in Htt(−) fibroblasts subjected to proteotoxic stress by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3c).To further analyze the involvement of Htt in selective autophagy, we directly tracked the cargo targeted in each of these stress conditions. In stably-transfected HeLa cells with inducible expression of Tau-ΔC, degradation of Tau-ΔC was mostly dependent on autophagy (sensitive to 3-methyladenine or Atg7 knockdown but insensitive to proteasome inhibition) (Supplementary Figure 4i–k). Htt knockdown dramatically blocked Tau-ΔC turnover (Fig. 3d,e), indicating that, similar to flies, Htt is required for the autophagy-mediated degradation of Tau-ΔC.We next induced selective degradation of lipid droplets (lipophagy) by cell loading with oleic acid22, 23. Htt(−) fibroblasts displayed higher sensitivity to lipid challenges and a more pronounced accumulation of lipid droplets (Fig. 3f–h). Lipid accumulation in Htt(−) fibroblasts was mostly due to their reduced ability to mobilize and break down intracellular lipid stores, as they failed to increase mitochondrial respiration in response to the lipogenic challenge and displayed lower rates of lipid beta-oxidation (Fig. 3i, j). Immunostaining revealed significantly lower colocalization of LC3 with Bodipy-labeled lipid droplets in Htt(−) cells (Fig. 3k,l), further supporting that Htt is required for selective lipophagy. Similarly, Htt(−) fibroblasts showed a comparatively higher content of depolarized mitochondria (labeled with MitoTracker® but negative for MitoTracker® Red CMXRos staining) and reduced colocalization between LC3 and MitoTracker®-highlighted mitochondria than control cells, in support of reduced mitophagy (Fig. 3m–p).Ultrastructural analysis of control and Htt(−)cells upon exposure to these three different stressors confirmed the fluorescence data (Fig. 4a–c). Thus, the most abundant fraction of autophagosomes in control cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor were those containing aggregate proteinaceous material, whereas in Htt(−) cells most of the observed autophagic vacuoles had a clear lumen and aggregates were instead detectable free in the cytosol (Fig. 4a). Similarly, treatment with oleic acid or FCCP, increased the fraction of autophagic vacuoles containing lipids or mitochondria, respectively, in control cells whereas this switch toward a specific autophagic cargo was not observed in Htt(−) cells (Fig. 4b–c). Interestingly, in contrast to the higher autophagic vacuole content observed in Htt(−) fibroblasts under basal conditions (Fig. 2m,n), number and cell fraction occupied by autophagic vacuoles upon exposure to any of these stressors were significantly lower in Htt(−) than in control cells (Fig. 4a–c), in support of a failure to maximally induced selective autophagy in Htt-deficient cells.Complete ablation of Htt (mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice knock-out for Htt24) or Htt knockdown in other cell types (neuroblastoma N2a cells and mouse striatal cells), also lead to higher levels of p62 and reduced colocalization of LC3 with markers of lipid droplets or mitochondria upon exposure to oleic acid or FCCP, respectively (Fig. 5). Overall, our results support that Htt is dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy but essential for at least three different types of selective autophagy, aggrephagy of either a specific protein (Tau) or a pool of aggregate proteins (proteasome inhibition), lipophagy and mitophagy.Further analysis of changes in autophagic flux in absence of Htt in different cell types under different experimental conditions revealed that, in contrast to the increase in basal autophagosome formation and autophagic flux observed in Htt(−) fibroblasts (Fig. 2k,l), Htt depletion in HeLa cells had indiscernible effects on basal LC3-II flux and on GST-BHMT fragmentation under basal conditions (Supplementary Figure 5a,b). These data likely reflect the lower dependence on Htt-mediated selective autophagy in these rapidly dividing cells, where quality control is less important. However, when we forced activation of quality control selective autophagy in these cells by inflicting proteotoxic stress with the proteasome inhibitor, Htt knockdown markedly blocked the induction of autophagy visible in the control cells as an increase in steady-state levels and clearance of LC3-II (Fig. 6a). Immunostaining for LC3 confirmed a reduced increase in the number of LC3-positive puncta in the Htt(−) HeLa cells upon proteotoxic stress (Fig. 6b,c). Transfection with GFP-Htt restored the defective autophagic flux during proteotoxic stress both in Htt(−) HeLa cells and in Htt-KO MEFs, but did not affect autophagy activation in response to serum removal (Supplementary Figure 5c,d). Blockage of lysosomal proteolysis with bafilomycin-A1 in Htt(−) cells exposed to proteasome inhibition still increased the number of LC3-positive puncta (Fig. 6b,d), suggesting that, in agreement with the EM data (Fig. 4), autophagosome clearance is normal in Htt-depleted cells and that their reduced LC3 flux during proteotoxic stress is mainly due to reduced autophagosome formation. Consistently, double labeling with the lysosome marker LAMP1 revealed lysosomal accumulation of LC3 in bafilomycin-A1 treated cells in both control and Htt(−) cells, indicating that fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes still occurs in the absence of Htt (Supplementary Figure 5e). In contrast, Htt knockdown did not significantly affect the levels or processing of LC3-II upon induction of nonselective autophagy by nutrient depletion (Supplementary Figure 5f). We found similar defects in induction of selective autophagy upon exposure to proteasome inhibitors, oleic acid or FCCP upon Htt depletion in mouse fibroblasts, MEFs, striatal and neuroblastoma cells expressing the mCherry-GFP-LC3 fusion reporter, whereas their ability to upregulate autophagic flux in response to nutritional deprivation remained unaffected (Supplementary Figure 5g–k). These results support that Htt is important in selective autophagy for both initiation of autophagosome formation and cargo recognition.Huntingtin physically interacts with p62 and ULK1 proteinsTo explore how Htt is involved in autophagy regulation, we next examined potential physical interactions between Htt and the autophagy components identified in our fly-based genetic screens (Fig. 1). Using whole-animal extracts from a genome-tagging fly line expressing 3xHA-tagged dHtt, we found that dhtt strongly co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Ref(2)P (Fig. 6e). Experiments in mammalian cells confirmed co-immunoprecipitation of both, endogenous and tagged Htt and p62, between them and with ULK1, the mammalian Atg1 homolog25 (Fig. 6f, Supplementary Figure 6a–d). Notably, we previously reported that p62 co-localized and interacted with mutant-Htt in autophagosomes12. Hence, results from the fly and mammalian systems together support that p62 and ULK1 are conserved binding partners of Htt.Intriguingly, the amount of endogenous p62 that co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Htt was significantly increased upon induction of proteotoxic stress (proteasome inhibitor treatment), whereas the level of co-immunoprecipitated ULK1 remained similar (Fig. 6g). Immunofluorescence for endogenous Htt and p62 in HeLa cells also revealed enrichment of Htt in the large p62-positive bodies (sequestosomes)26 that form around the nucleus upon proteasome inhibition (Fig. 6h), suggesting a translocation of Htt to the p62 bodies in response to autophagy induction. Tagged-ULK1 has been shown to co-localize with p6227, raising the possibility that Htt might form a tertiary complex with p62 and ULK1.To map the regions responsible for Htt’s association with p62 and ULK1, we generated Htt deletions and through co-IP identified two non-overlapping conserved regions113,28 in Htt, the C-terminal D6 and the middle D3 regions that bind to p62 and ULK1, respectively (Fig. 6i–k and Supplementary Figure 6e–g).Huntingtin facilitates p62-mediated cargo recognition efficiencyGiven the defective sequestration of selective cargo inside autophagosomes in Htt(−) cells and the direct interaction between Htt and p62, we investigated if Htt functions with p62 in cargo recognition. p62 is involved in selective autophagy by simultaneous binding with LC3 and ubiquitinated cargos for their subsequent engulfment by the forming autophagic membrane2. Cargo recognition by p62 initiates with the formation of sequestosomes (detergent resistant p62 bodies)2, 26. Accordingly, treatment with proteasome inhibitors gradually decreases soluble p62 and increased insoluble p62 in control cells. However, p62 redistribution and formation of large p62 bodies were no longer observed upon depletion of Htt (Fig. 7a–c and Supplementary Figure 7a–c; depletion of Beclin 1, essential for autophagosome formation1,25 is shown as positive control). In contrast, the fraction of cellular p62 degraded by autophagy during starvation did not change upon Htt knockdown (Supplementary Figure 7d).Three functional domains in p62 coordinate its roles in selective autophagy: the self-polymerization (PB1) and ubiquitin-binding (UBA) domains are critical for p62 body formation2, and the middle motif (LIR) for its interaction with LC3 for cargo-based autophagic degradation29. We found that knockdown of Htt had no obvious effect on p62 polymerization (HA-p62 and Myc-p62 interaction) or its interaction with ubiquitinated proteins containing the K48 linkage-specific modification (Ub-K48), but strikingly reduced the amount of p62 that co-immunoprecipitated with ubiquitinated substrates containing the K63 linkage-specific modification30 (Ub-K63) (Supplementary Figure 7e–g). These findings were also reproduced using transfected HA-tagged Ub-K63 and Ub-K48 and pull downs with anti-HA (to discard non-specific antibody effects) (Supplementary Figure 7h–i) and in Htt-KO MEFs (to discard non-specific siRNA-mediated effects) (Fig. 7d–e). The above results raise the possibility that Tau-ΔC is also a target of Ub-K63 modification. Indeed, we found that Tau-ΔC protein was preferentially modified by Ub-K63 but not Ub-K48 in the inducible HeLa cells (Fig. 7f). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that p62 physically interacts with Tau-ΔC and their affinity was compromised after Htt knockdown (Fig. 7g). Overall these findings indicate that Htt facilitates p62 binding to Ub-K63-modified proteins that are preferentially degraded by selective autophagy31.Lastly, we investigated the effect of Htt knockdown in the interaction of p62 with LC3. The ability of LC3 to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous p62 was markedly reduced in Htt(−) cells and, accordingly, colocalization of p62 and LC3 was also significantly reduced upon Htt loss (Fig. 7h–j). Although it is not possible to discriminate if the reduced p62 and LC3 interaction is primarily due to the loss of Htt or secondary to the inability of p62 to bind K63 ubiquitinated cargo, these findings uncover an essential role for Htt in p62-dependent cargo recognition required for proper sequestration of specific cargo into autophagosomes during selective autophagy.Huntingtin/ULK1 and mTOR/ULK1 complexes are mutually exclusiveTo investigate the basis for the observed defective autophagosome biogenesis in Htt(−) cells in response to different stressors, we followed up on the physical (Fig. 6f) and genetic (Fig. 1c) interaction of Htt with ULK1, the kinase essential for initiation of both selective and nonselective autophagy25. In control cells, both starvation and proteotoxicity (proteasome inhibition) significantly boosted ULK1 kinase activity, measured as increased phosphorylation of MBP, a pseudo-substrate for ULK125, but Htt knockdown only attenuated proteasome inhibition-mediated ULK1 activation (Fig. 8a). These results suggest that Htt could contribute to regulate initiation of selective autophagy by modulating ULK1 activation while not affecting starvation induced nonselective autophagy. Consistent with this hypothesis, Htt has no significant impact on AMPK which positively regulates ULK1 kinase activity in response to energy depletion, presumably by interacting and phosphorylating ULK132–34. Htt knockdown did not disrupt the interaction between AMPK and ULK1, nor interfered with AMPK-mediated ULK1 phosphorylation at Ser555 (Supplementary Figure 8a,b), two mechanisms of regulation that are critical for AMPK-induced ULK1 activation35.To determine how Htt specifically activates selective autophagy but not nonselective autophagy when they both share common regulators including ULK1, we systematically examined several established mechanisms governing ULK1 kinase activity. Maximal activation of ULK1 is attained by forming a stable quaternary complex with FIP200, Atg13 and Atg10125. Pull-down assays revealed that Htt did not affect the stability of this complex (Supplementary Figure 8c). ULK1 is also regulated by the central nutrient sensor mTORC1, which binds to ULK1 and represses its kinase activity to prevent autophagy initiation. Inactivation of mTORC1 during starvation triggers release of active ULK1 from this complex and initiation of nonselective autophagy36, whereas the mechanisms that counterbalance the inhibitory effect of mTORC1 on ULK1 for activation of selective autophagy remain poorly understood. We first tested whether Htt affected the kinase activity of mTOR and consequently its inhibitory effect on ULK1. Neither Htt knockdown nor Htt overexpression showed any obvious effect on mTOR kinase activity when assessed by the phosphorylation of the downstream mTOR effector S6K at Thr38936 under basal conditions or upon activation of mTOR by the upstream regulator Rheb (Supplementary Figure 8d,e). This result was further confirmed by an in vitro kinase assay using GST-4E-BP1, a substrate readily phosphorylated by mTOR at Ser65 after mTOR activation. Ser65-GST-4E-BP1 phosphorylation was unaffected by Htt knockdown (Supplementary Figure 8f). Thus, Htt might not activate ULK1 by directly inhibiting mTOR activity.Excitingly, although ULK1 co-immunoprecipitated with Htt, mTOR, and Raptor, an adaptor protein critical for mTORC1 activity (Fig. 8b), Htt/ULK1 and mTOR/Raptor/ULK1 exist as two separate mutually exclusive complexes. Specifically, co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Htt could pull-down ULK1 but not mTOR or Raptor (Fig. 8c), and both mTOR and Raptor co-immunoprecipitated ULK1 but not Htt (Fig. 8d). Similar physical interactions were observed for endogenous Htt, ULK1 and mTOR proteins in MEFs (Fig. 8e,f; Htt-KO and ULK1-KO37 as controls) and neuroblastoma N2a cells (Supplementary Figure 8g–i), thus confirming the existence of two mutually exclusive ULK1/Htt and ULK1/mTOR complexes. This mutual exclusion indicates that Htt may promote ULK1 activation during selective autophagy by directly competing for the inhibitory binding of mTORC1 to ULK1. Indeed, under all three different stress conditions, we observed an increased interaction between ULK1 and Htt at the expense of mTOR, while Htt depletion largely abolished this competitive effect (Fig. 8g and Supplementary Figures 8j,k). Consistently, overexpression of Htt significantly blocked mTOR-mediated repression of ULK1. Basal ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of MBP can be detected in the kinase assay under rich nutritional conditions but not with the kinase-dead ULK1 mutant (FLAG-ULK1-KD) (Fig. 8a). This basal ULK1 activity is sensitive to regulation by mTOR, as overexpression of Myc-mTOR substantially repressed MBP phosphorylation and overexpression of a kinase-dead Myc-mTOR mutant showed the opposite effect, probably through a dominant-negative mechanism (Fig. 8h). Interestingly, overexpression of Htt significantly relieved this mTOR-mediated repression of basal ULK1 kinase activity (Fig. 8h), suggesting that Htt antagonizes the negative regulation of mTOR on ULK1 and promotes activation of selective autophagy even in the presence of active mTOR (rich media) by directly competing away ULK1 from the mTORC1/ULK1 complex. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Htt overexpression dramatically reduced the amount of endogenous mTOR and Raptor proteins associated with ULK1 (Fig. 8i), providing further support for this competition model. Changes in Htt protein levels may also contribute to modulate Htt function on autophagy under physiological conditions, since after exposure to stressors that induce selective autophagy but not in response to starvation, we found modest elevations of endogenous Htt levels in fibroblasts and neuroblastoma N2a cells (Supplementary Figure 8l,m).

Drosophila huntingtin genetically interacts with autophagy pathway componentsHomozygous flies lacking its single htt homolog (dhttko) are fully viable with only mild phenotypes13. In a genetic screen for Htt’s physiological function, ectopic expression of a truncated form of microtubule-binding protein Tau (Tau-ΔC; truncated after V382) induced a prominent collapse of the thorax in dhttko flies due to severe underneath muscle loss (Fig. 1a7) not observed by Tau expression alone, and accelerated decline in mobility and life-span. These phenotypes were fully rescued by the dhtt genomic rescue transgene (“dhttRescue”)13 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figure 1a–c), suggesting that dhtt protects against Tau-induced pathogenic effects.Although heterozygous dhttko/+ flies expressing Tau (ATau; dhttko/+) appear normal, removing in these flies of a single copy of the fly LC3 gene, atg8a (atg8ad4 mutant)14 also induced collapsed thorax and muscle loss, which could be phenocopied by expressing Tau in homozygous atg8ad4−/− flies alone (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figure 1d). Four additional components of the early steps of the autophagy pathway, atg1 (ULK1), atg7 and atg13, and an adaptor for the selective recognition of autophagic cargo, Ref(2)P (p62)15, also exhibit strong genetic interactions with dhtt (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figure 1e). Consistent with its pivotal role in autophagy initiation1, loss of atg1 induced the strongest defect and Tau expression could induce a mild muscle loss phenotype even in heterozygous null atg1Δ3d (Fig. 1c). Collectively, these genetic interaction studies suggest a role of dhtt in autophagy.

Homozygous flies lacking its single htt homolog (dhttko) are fully viable with only mild phenotypes13. In a genetic screen for Htt’s physiological function, ectopic expression of a truncated form of microtubule-binding protein Tau (Tau-ΔC; truncated after V382) induced a prominent collapse of the thorax in dhttko flies due to severe underneath muscle loss (Fig. 1a7) not observed by Tau expression alone, and accelerated decline in mobility and life-span.

Four additional components of the early steps of the autophagy pathway, atg1 (ULK1), atg7 and atg13, and an adaptor for the selective recognition of autophagic cargo, Ref(2)P (p62)15, also exhibit strong genetic interactions with dhtt (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figure 1e).

Collectively, these genetic interaction studies suggest a role of dhtt in autophagy.

Drosophila huntingtin positively regulates autophagy in vivoUsing the mCherry-GFP-Atg8a fusion reporter to directly measure autophagic flux in adult dhttko−/− brains16, we found similar number of red fluorescent punctae (acidic autolysosomes originating from autophagosome/lysosome fusion) in young mutant and control flies, but the number of punctae was reduced in old dhttko−/− brains when compared to age-matched controls (Fig. 1d,e). Since we did not observe autophagosome accumulation (colocalized green and red puncta), we concluded that absence of dhtt in older animals is associated with reduced autophagosome formation. The fact that levels of Ref(2)P were significantly higher in old dhttko−/− brains compared to brains from age-matched wildtype control (Fig. 1f,g) suggested a possible preferential compromise in selective autophagy in these animals.Consistent with the role of basal selective autophagy in quality control in non-dividing cells17, we found that brains from 5 weeks old dhttko−/− contained almost double amount of ubiquitinated proteins, marker of quality control failure, than wildtype flies (Supplementary Fig 2a). Since genetic interaction analysis and specific ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) reporters all failed to reveal a functional link between dhtt and the UPS pathway (Supplementary Figure 2b–f), we propose that the defects in autophagic activity are the main cause of diminished quality control and increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in dhttko−/− mutants.

Using the mCherry-GFP-Atg8a fusion reporter to directly measure autophagic flux in adult dhttko−/− brains16, we found similar number of red fluorescent punctae (acidic autolysosomes originating from autophagosome/lysosome fusion) in young mutant and control flies, but the number of punctae was reduced in old dhttko−/− brains when compared to age-matched controls (Fig. 1d,e). Since we did not observe autophagosome accumulation (colocalized green and red puncta), we concluded that absence of dhtt in older animals is associated with reduced autophagosome formation. The fact that levels of Ref(2)P were significantly higher in old dhttko−/− brains compared to brains from age-matched wildtype control (Fig. 1f,g) suggested a possible preferential compromise in selective autophagy in these animals.

Consistent with the role of basal selective autophagy in quality control in non-dividing cells17, we found that brains from 5 weeks old dhttko−/− contained almost double amount of ubiquitinated proteins, marker of quality control failure, than wildtype flies (Supplementary Fig 2a). Since genetic interaction analysis and specific ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) reporters all failed to reveal a functional link between dhtt and the UPS pathway (Supplementary Figure 2b–f), we propose that the defects in autophagic activity are the main cause of diminished quality control and increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in dhttko−/− mutants.

Drosophila huntingtin is required for intracellular quality controlSelective autophagy is induced in response to proteotoxic stress. The truncated Tau-ΔC used in our genetic studies, is preferentially degraded through autophagy in cortical neurons18, serving as a model of proteotoxicity when ectopically expressed. We confirmed lower stability of Tau-ΔC compared to full-length Tau in wildtype flies (Supplementary Figure 3a) and in UPS mutants, but found significantly higher levels of Tau-ΔC when expressed in atg8a and in dhttko−/− mutant flies (Fig. 1h–j), suggesting that autophagy is essential for the clearance of Tau-ΔC also in flies and that dhtt plays a role in this clearance.In contrast, loss of dhtt did not affect flies’ adaptation to nutrient deprivation, which typically induces robust “in bulk” autophagy19. Fat bodies of early third instar larvae expressing mCherry-Atg8, where starvation-induced autophagy can be readily detected20, failed to reveal any significant difference between wildtype and dhttko−/− flies and they die at the same rate as wildtype flies when tested for starvation resistance (Supplementary Figure 2g–i). Thus, although dhtt is necessary for selective autophagy of toxic proteins such as Tau-ΔC, it is dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy in flies.

Thus, although dhtt is necessary for selective autophagy of toxic proteins such as Tau-ΔC, it is dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy in flies.

Huntingtin’s function is conserved from flies to humansExpression of human Htt (hHtt) in dhttko−/− null rescued both the mobility and longevity defects of dhttko−/− mutants and partially rescued the Tau-induced morphological and behavioral defects of dhttko−/− flies (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figure 3b–f). hHtt also suppressed almost all the autophagic defects observed in dhttko−/−, including decreased levels of autolysosomes, increased levels of Ref(2)P and of total ubiquitinated proteins, and accumulation of ectopically expressed Tau-ΔC (Fig. 2b–e and Supplementary Figure 3g–i), suggesting that the involvement of dhtt in autophagy is functionally conserved. In fact, confluent mouse fibroblasts knocked down for Htt (Htt(−)) displayed significantly lower basal rates of long-lived proteins’ degradation than control cells, which were no longer evident upon chemical inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis or of macroautophagy, thus confirming an autophagic origin of the proteolytic defect (Fig. 2g,h). Htt(−) fibroblasts also displayed higher p62 levels and accumulate ubiquitin aggregates even in absence of a proteotoxic challenge (Fig. 2i,j). Similar to dhttko−/− flies, Htt knockdown in mammalian cells did not affect degradation of CL1-GFP (a UPS reporter), β-catenin (a UPS canonical substrate) or proteasome peptidase activities (Supplementary Figure 4a–c). Reduced autophagic degradation in Htt(−) cells was not due to a primary lysosomal defect, as depletion of Htt did not reduce lysosomal acidification, endo-lysosomal number (if anything, we observed an expansion of this compartment) or other lysosomal functions such as endocytosis (transferrin internalization) (Supplementary Figure 4d–h). In fact, analysis of the lysosomal degradation of LC3-II revealed that autophagic flux and autophagosome formation were preserved and even enhanced in Htt(−) fibroblasts at basal conditions (Fig. 2k,l).We have previously shown a similar apparent dichotomy - reduced autophagic degradation of cargo (long-lived proteins and p62) with normal or increased formation and clearance of LC3 positive autophagic vesicles - in cells from HD patients12. Since in this pathological setting, we observed an “empty autophagosome” phenotype resulting from defective cargo sequestration, we performed electron microscopy (EM). We found that the overall size and number of the autophagic/lysosomal compartments was expanded in Htt(−) fibroblasts under basal conditions but that, contrary to the organelles and electron-dense cargo noticeable in the vacuoles in the control cells, a larger fraction of the vesicular structures in Htt(−) fibroblasts lacked visible content or had a mixed cargo composition reflective of “in bulk” autophagy (Fig. 2m,n). Immunogold staining for LC3 confirmed the autophagic nature of the Htt(−) cells’ empty vesicles (Fig. 2o). Thus, similar to flies, Htt is also required for effective autophagy in mammals and its depletion affects the autophagic process early at the step of selective cargo recognition.

Expression of human Htt (hHtt) in dhttko−/− null rescued both the mobility and longevity defects of dhttko−/− mutants and partially rescued the Tau-induced morphological and behavioral defects of dhttko−/− flies (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figure 3b–f). hHtt also suppressed almost all the autophagic defects observed in dhttko−/−, including decreased levels of autolysosomes, increased levels of Ref(2)P and of total ubiquitinated proteins, and accumulation of ectopically expressed Tau-ΔC (Fig. 2b–e and Supplementary Figure 3g–i), suggesting that the involvement of dhtt in autophagy is functionally conserved. In fact, confluent mouse fibroblasts knocked down for Htt (Htt(−)) displayed significantly lower basal rates of long-lived proteins’ degradation than control cells, which were no longer evident upon chemical inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis or of macroautophagy, thus confirming an autophagic origin of the proteolytic defect (Fig. 2g,h). Htt(−) fibroblasts also displayed higher p62 levels and accumulate ubiquitin aggregates even in absence of a proteotoxic challenge (Fig. 2i,j).

In fact, analysis of the lysosomal degradation of LC3-II revealed that autophagic flux and autophagosome formation were preserved and even enhanced in Htt(−) fibroblasts at basal conditions (Fig. 2k,l).

We have previously shown a similar apparent dichotomy - reduced autophagic degradation of cargo (long-lived proteins and p62) with normal or increased formation and clearance of LC3 positive autophagic vesicles - in cells from HD patients12. Since in this pathological setting, we observed an “empty autophagosome” phenotype resulting from defective cargo sequestration, we performed electron microscopy (EM). We found that the overall size and number of the autophagic/lysosomal compartments was expanded in Htt(−) fibroblasts under basal conditions but that, contrary to the organelles and electron-dense cargo noticeable in the vacuoles in the control cells, a larger fraction of the vesicular structures in Htt(−) fibroblasts lacked visible content or had a mixed cargo composition reflective of “in bulk” autophagy (Fig. 2m,n). Immunogold staining for LC3 confirmed the autophagic nature of the Htt(−) cells’ empty vesicles (Fig. 2o). Thus, similar to flies, Htt is also required for effective autophagy in mammals and its depletion affects the autophagic process early at the step of selective cargo recognition.

Mammalian Huntingtin is required for selective autophagyIn light of the above observed role of Htt in autophagy under basal conditions, we then analyzed the requirement for Htt in autophagy activated in response to different cellular stressors, when only specific cytosolic cargo is degraded. The reduced rates of autophagic degradation of long-lived proteins observed in Htt(−) fibroblasts, become even more pronounced upon exposure to proteotoxic stress (inhibition of proteasome degradation), lipotoxic stress (oleic challenge) or the mitochondrial depolarizing agent FCCP (Fig. 3a). However, upon starvation (serum removal or incubation in nutrient-free media), control and Htt(−) fibroblasts displayed a similar increase in long lived proteins’ degradation and in fragmentation of GST-BHMT, a cargo-based end-point assay for autophagy21 (Fig. 3a,b). In contrast, accumulation of fragmented GST-BHMT was almost abolished in Htt(−) fibroblasts subjected to proteotoxic stress by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3c).To further analyze the involvement of Htt in selective autophagy, we directly tracked the cargo targeted in each of these stress conditions. In stably-transfected HeLa cells with inducible expression of Tau-ΔC, degradation of Tau-ΔC was mostly dependent on autophagy (sensitive to 3-methyladenine or Atg7 knockdown but insensitive to proteasome inhibition) (Supplementary Figure 4i–k). Htt knockdown dramatically blocked Tau-ΔC turnover (Fig. 3d,e), indicating that, similar to flies, Htt is required for the autophagy-mediated degradation of Tau-ΔC.We next induced selective degradation of lipid droplets (lipophagy) by cell loading with oleic acid22, 23. Htt(−) fibroblasts displayed higher sensitivity to lipid challenges and a more pronounced accumulation of lipid droplets (Fig. 3f–h). Lipid accumulation in Htt(−) fibroblasts was mostly due to their reduced ability to mobilize and break down intracellular lipid stores, as they failed to increase mitochondrial respiration in response to the lipogenic challenge and displayed lower rates of lipid beta-oxidation (Fig. 3i, j). Immunostaining revealed significantly lower colocalization of LC3 with Bodipy-labeled lipid droplets in Htt(−) cells (Fig. 3k,l), further supporting that Htt is required for selective lipophagy. Similarly, Htt(−) fibroblasts showed a comparatively higher content of depolarized mitochondria (labeled with MitoTracker® but negative for MitoTracker® Red CMXRos staining) and reduced colocalization between LC3 and MitoTracker®-highlighted mitochondria than control cells, in support of reduced mitophagy (Fig. 3m–p).Ultrastructural analysis of control and Htt(−)cells upon exposure to these three different stressors confirmed the fluorescence data (Fig. 4a–c). Thus, the most abundant fraction of autophagosomes in control cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor were those containing aggregate proteinaceous material, whereas in Htt(−) cells most of the observed autophagic vacuoles had a clear lumen and aggregates were instead detectable free in the cytosol (Fig. 4a). Similarly, treatment with oleic acid or FCCP, increased the fraction of autophagic vacuoles containing lipids or mitochondria, respectively, in control cells whereas this switch toward a specific autophagic cargo was not observed in Htt(−) cells (Fig. 4b–c). Interestingly, in contrast to the higher autophagic vacuole content observed in Htt(−) fibroblasts under basal conditions (Fig. 2m,n), number and cell fraction occupied by autophagic vacuoles upon exposure to any of these stressors were significantly lower in Htt(−) than in control cells (Fig. 4a–c), in support of a failure to maximally induced selective autophagy in Htt-deficient cells.Complete ablation of Htt (mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice knock-out for Htt24) or Htt knockdown in other cell types (neuroblastoma N2a cells and mouse striatal cells), also lead to higher levels of p62 and reduced colocalization of LC3 with markers of lipid droplets or mitochondria upon exposure to oleic acid or FCCP, respectively (Fig. 5). Overall, our results support that Htt is dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy but essential for at least three different types of selective autophagy, aggrephagy of either a specific protein (Tau) or a pool of aggregate proteins (proteasome inhibition), lipophagy and mitophagy.Further analysis of changes in autophagic flux in absence of Htt in different cell types under different experimental conditions revealed that, in contrast to the increase in basal autophagosome formation and autophagic flux observed in Htt(−) fibroblasts (Fig. 2k,l), Htt depletion in HeLa cells had indiscernible effects on basal LC3-II flux and on GST-BHMT fragmentation under basal conditions (Supplementary Figure 5a,b). These data likely reflect the lower dependence on Htt-mediated selective autophagy in these rapidly dividing cells, where quality control is less important. However, when we forced activation of quality control selective autophagy in these cells by inflicting proteotoxic stress with the proteasome inhibitor, Htt knockdown markedly blocked the induction of autophagy visible in the control cells as an increase in steady-state levels and clearance of LC3-II (Fig. 6a). Immunostaining for LC3 confirmed a reduced increase in the number of LC3-positive puncta in the Htt(−) HeLa cells upon proteotoxic stress (Fig. 6b,c). Transfection with GFP-Htt restored the defective autophagic flux during proteotoxic stress both in Htt(−) HeLa cells and in Htt-KO MEFs, but did not affect autophagy activation in response to serum removal (Supplementary Figure 5c,d). Blockage of lysosomal proteolysis with bafilomycin-A1 in Htt(−) cells exposed to proteasome inhibition still increased the number of LC3-positive puncta (Fig. 6b,d), suggesting that, in agreement with the EM data (Fig. 4), autophagosome clearance is normal in Htt-depleted cells and that their reduced LC3 flux during proteotoxic stress is mainly due to reduced autophagosome formation. Consistently, double labeling with the lysosome marker LAMP1 revealed lysosomal accumulation of LC3 in bafilomycin-A1 treated cells in both control and Htt(−) cells, indicating that fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes still occurs in the absence of Htt (Supplementary Figure 5e). In contrast, Htt knockdown did not significantly affect the levels or processing of LC3-II upon induction of nonselective autophagy by nutrient depletion (Supplementary Figure 5f). We found similar defects in induction of selective autophagy upon exposure to proteasome inhibitors, oleic acid or FCCP upon Htt depletion in mouse fibroblasts, MEFs, striatal and neuroblastoma cells expressing the mCherry-GFP-LC3 fusion reporter, whereas their ability to upregulate autophagic flux in response to nutritional deprivation remained unaffected (Supplementary Figure 5g–k). These results support that Htt is important in selective autophagy for both initiation of autophagosome formation and cargo recognition.

Mammalian Huntingtin is required for selective autophagy

In light of the above observed role of Htt in autophagy under basal conditions, we then analyzed the requirement for Htt in autophagy activated in response to different cellular stressors, when only specific cytosolic cargo is degraded. The reduced rates of autophagic degradation of long-lived proteins observed in Htt(−) fibroblasts, become even more pronounced upon exposure to proteotoxic stress (inhibition of proteasome degradation), lipotoxic stress (oleic challenge) or the mitochondrial depolarizing agent FCCP (Fig. 3a). However, upon starvation (serum removal or incubation in nutrient-free media), control and Htt(−) fibroblasts displayed a similar increase in long lived proteins’ degradation and in fragmentation of GST-BHMT, a cargo-based end-point assay for autophagy21 (Fig. 3a,b). In contrast, accumulation of fragmented GST-BHMT was almost abolished in Htt(−) fibroblasts subjected to proteotoxic stress by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3c).

To further analyze the involvement of Htt in selective autophagy, we directly tracked the cargo targeted in each of these stress conditions. In stably-transfected HeLa cells with inducible expression of Tau-ΔC, degradation of Tau-ΔC was mostly dependent on autophagy (sensitive to 3-methyladenine or Atg7 knockdown but insensitive to proteasome inhibition) (Supplementary Figure 4i–k). Htt knockdown dramatically blocked Tau-ΔC turnover (Fig. 3d,e), indicating that, similar to flies, Htt is required for the autophagy-mediated degradation of Tau-ΔC.

We next induced selective degradation of lipid droplets (lipophagy) by cell loading with oleic acid22, 23. Htt(−) fibroblasts displayed higher sensitivity to lipid challenges and a more pronounced accumulation of lipid droplets (Fig. 3f–h). Lipid accumulation in Htt(−) fibroblasts was mostly due to their reduced ability to mobilize and break down intracellular lipid stores, as they failed to increase mitochondrial respiration in response to the lipogenic challenge and displayed lower rates of lipid beta-oxidation (Fig. 3i, j). Immunostaining revealed significantly lower colocalization of LC3 with Bodipy-labeled lipid droplets in Htt(−) cells (Fig. 3k,l), further supporting that Htt is required for selective lipophagy. Similarly, Htt(−) fibroblasts showed a comparatively higher content of depolarized mitochondria (labeled with MitoTracker® but negative for MitoTracker® Red CMXRos staining) and reduced colocalization between LC3 and MitoTracker®-highlighted mitochondria than control cells, in support of reduced mitophagy (Fig. 3m–p).

Ultrastructural analysis of control and Htt(−)cells upon exposure to these three different stressors confirmed the fluorescence data (Fig. 4a–c). Thus, the most abundant fraction of autophagosomes in control cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor were those containing aggregate proteinaceous material, whereas in Htt(−) cells most of the observed autophagic vacuoles had a clear lumen and aggregates were instead detectable free in the cytosol (Fig. 4a). Similarly, treatment with oleic acid or FCCP, increased the fraction of autophagic vacuoles containing lipids or mitochondria, respectively, in control cells whereas this switch toward a specific autophagic cargo was not observed in Htt(−) cells (Fig. 4b–c). Interestingly, in contrast to the higher autophagic vacuole content observed in Htt(−) fibroblasts under basal conditions (Fig. 2m,n), number and cell fraction occupied by autophagic vacuoles upon exposure to any of these stressors were significantly lower in Htt(−) than in control cells (Fig. 4a–c), in support of a failure to maximally induced selective autophagy in Htt-deficient cells.

Complete ablation of Htt (mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice knock-out for Htt24) or Htt knockdown in other cell types (neuroblastoma N2a cells and mouse striatal cells), also lead to higher levels of p62 and reduced colocalization of LC3 with markers of lipid droplets or mitochondria upon exposure to oleic acid or FCCP, respectively (Fig. 5). Overall, our results support that Htt is dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy but essential for at least three different types of selective autophagy, aggrephagy of either a specific protein (Tau) or a pool of aggregate proteins (proteasome inhibition), lipophagy and mitophagy.

Further analysis of changes in autophagic flux in absence of Htt in different cell types under different experimental conditions revealed that, in contrast to the increase in basal autophagosome formation and autophagic flux observed in Htt(−) fibroblasts (Fig. 2k,l), Htt depletion in HeLa cells had indiscernible effects on basal LC3-II flux and on GST-BHMT fragmentation under basal conditions (Supplementary Figure 5a,b). These data likely reflect the lower dependence on Htt-mediated selective autophagy in these rapidly dividing cells, where quality control is less important. However, when we forced activation of quality control selective autophagy in these cells by inflicting proteotoxic stress with the proteasome inhibitor, Htt knockdown markedly blocked the induction of autophagy visible in the control cells as an increase in steady-state levels and clearance of LC3-II (Fig. 6a). Immunostaining for LC3 confirmed a reduced increase in the number of LC3-positive puncta in the Htt(−) HeLa cells upon proteotoxic stress (Fig. 6b,c). Transfection with GFP-Htt restored the defective autophagic flux during proteotoxic stress both in Htt(−) HeLa cells and in Htt-KO MEFs, but did not affect autophagy activation in response to serum removal (Supplementary Figure 5c,d). Blockage of lysosomal proteolysis with bafilomycin-A1 in Htt(−) cells exposed to proteasome inhibition still increased the number of LC3-positive puncta (Fig. 6b,d), suggesting that, in agreement with the EM data (Fig. 4), autophagosome clearance is normal in Htt-depleted cells and that their reduced LC3 flux during proteotoxic stress is mainly due to reduced autophagosome formation. Consistently, double labeling with the lysosome marker LAMP1 revealed lysosomal accumulation of LC3 in bafilomycin-A1 treated cells in both control and Htt(−) cells, indicating that fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes still occurs in the absence of Htt (Supplementary Figure 5e). In contrast, Htt knockdown did not significantly affect the levels or processing of LC3-II upon induction of nonselective autophagy by nutrient depletion (Supplementary Figure 5f). We found similar defects in induction of selective autophagy upon exposure to proteasome inhibitors, oleic acid or FCCP upon Htt depletion in mouse fibroblasts, MEFs, striatal and neuroblastoma cells expressing the mCherry-GFP-LC3 fusion reporter, whereas their ability to upregulate autophagic flux in response to nutritional deprivation remained unaffected (Supplementary Figure 5g–k). These results support that Htt is important in selective autophagy for both initiation of autophagosome formation and cargo recognition.

Huntingtin physically interacts with p62 and ULK1 proteinsTo explore how Htt is involved in autophagy regulation, we next examined potential physical interactions between Htt and the autophagy components identified in our fly-based genetic screens (Fig. 1). Using whole-animal extracts from a genome-tagging fly line expressing 3xHA-tagged dHtt, we found that dhtt strongly co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Ref(2)P (Fig. 6e). Experiments in mammalian cells confirmed co-immunoprecipitation of both, endogenous and tagged Htt and p62, between them and with ULK1, the mammalian Atg1 homolog25 (Fig. 6f, Supplementary Figure 6a–d). Notably, we previously reported that p62 co-localized and interacted with mutant-Htt in autophagosomes12. Hence, results from the fly and mammalian systems together support that p62 and ULK1 are conserved binding partners of Htt.Intriguingly, the amount of endogenous p62 that co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Htt was significantly increased upon induction of proteotoxic stress (proteasome inhibitor treatment), whereas the level of co-immunoprecipitated ULK1 remained similar (Fig. 6g). Immunofluorescence for endogenous Htt and p62 in HeLa cells also revealed enrichment of Htt in the large p62-positive bodies (sequestosomes)26 that form around the nucleus upon proteasome inhibition (Fig. 6h), suggesting a translocation of Htt to the p62 bodies in response to autophagy induction. Tagged-ULK1 has been shown to co-localize with p6227, raising the possibility that Htt might form a tertiary complex with p62 and ULK1.To map the regions responsible for Htt’s association with p62 and ULK1, we generated Htt deletions and through co-IP identified two non-overlapping conserved regions113,28 in Htt, the C-terminal D6 and the middle D3 regions that bind to p62 and ULK1, respectively (Fig. 6i–k and Supplementary Figure 6e–g).

Using whole-animal extracts from a genome-tagging fly line expressing 3xHA-tagged dHtt, we found that dhtt strongly co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Ref(2)P (Fig. 6e). Experiments in mammalian cells confirmed co-immunoprecipitation of both, endogenous and tagged Htt and p62, between them and with ULK1, the mammalian Atg1 homolog25 (Fig. 6f, Supplementary Figure 6a–d). Notably, we previously reported that p62 co-localized and interacted with mutant-Htt in autophagosomes12. Hence, results from the fly and mammalian systems together support that p62 and ULK1 are conserved binding partners of Htt.

Intriguingly, the amount of endogenous p62 that co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Htt was significantly increased upon induction of proteotoxic stress (proteasome inhibitor treatment), whereas the level of co-immunoprecipitated ULK1 remained similar (Fig. 6g). Immunofluorescence for endogenous Htt and p62 in HeLa cells also revealed enrichment of Htt in the large p62-positive bodies (sequestosomes)26 that form around the nucleus upon proteasome inhibition (Fig. 6h), suggesting a translocation of Htt to the p62 bodies in response to autophagy induction. Tagged-ULK1 has been shown to co-localize with p6227, raising the possibility that Htt might form a tertiary complex with p62 and ULK1.

To map the regions responsible for Htt’s association with p62 and ULK1, we generated Htt deletions and through co-IP identified two non-overlapping conserved regions113,28 in Htt, the C-terminal D6 and the middle D3 regions that bind to p62 and ULK1, respectively (Fig. 6i–k and Supplementary Figure 6e–g).

Huntingtin facilitates p62-mediated cargo recognition efficiencyGiven the defective sequestration of selective cargo inside autophagosomes in Htt(−) cells and the direct interaction between Htt and p62, we investigated if Htt functions with p62 in cargo recognition. p62 is involved in selective autophagy by simultaneous binding with LC3 and ubiquitinated cargos for their subsequent engulfment by the forming autophagic membrane2. Cargo recognition by p62 initiates with the formation of sequestosomes (detergent resistant p62 bodies)2, 26. Accordingly, treatment with proteasome inhibitors gradually decreases soluble p62 and increased insoluble p62 in control cells. However, p62 redistribution and formation of large p62 bodies were no longer observed upon depletion of Htt (Fig. 7a–c and Supplementary Figure 7a–c; depletion of Beclin 1, essential for autophagosome formation1,25 is shown as positive control). In contrast, the fraction of cellular p62 degraded by autophagy during starvation did not change upon Htt knockdown (Supplementary Figure 7d).Three functional domains in p62 coordinate its roles in selective autophagy: the self-polymerization (PB1) and ubiquitin-binding (UBA) domains are critical for p62 body formation2, and the middle motif (LIR) for its interaction with LC3 for cargo-based autophagic degradation29. We found that knockdown of Htt had no obvious effect on p62 polymerization (HA-p62 and Myc-p62 interaction) or its interaction with ubiquitinated proteins containing the K48 linkage-specific modification (Ub-K48), but strikingly reduced the amount of p62 that co-immunoprecipitated with ubiquitinated substrates containing the K63 linkage-specific modification30 (Ub-K63) (Supplementary Figure 7e–g). These findings were also reproduced using transfected HA-tagged Ub-K63 and Ub-K48 and pull downs with anti-HA (to discard non-specific antibody effects) (Supplementary Figure 7h–i) and in Htt-KO MEFs (to discard non-specific siRNA-mediated effects) (Fig. 7d–e). The above results raise the possibility that Tau-ΔC is also a target of Ub-K63 modification. Indeed, we found that Tau-ΔC protein was preferentially modified by Ub-K63 but not Ub-K48 in the inducible HeLa cells (Fig. 7f). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that p62 physically interacts with Tau-ΔC and their affinity was compromised after Htt knockdown (Fig. 7g). Overall these findings indicate that Htt facilitates p62 binding to Ub-K63-modified proteins that are preferentially degraded by selective autophagy31.Lastly, we investigated the effect of Htt knockdown in the interaction of p62 with LC3. The ability of LC3 to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous p62 was markedly reduced in Htt(−) cells and, accordingly, colocalization of p62 and LC3 was also significantly reduced upon Htt loss (Fig. 7h–j). Although it is not possible to discriminate if the reduced p62 and LC3 interaction is primarily due to the loss of Htt or secondary to the inability of p62 to bind K63 ubiquitinated cargo, these findings uncover an essential role for Htt in p62-dependent cargo recognition required for proper sequestration of specific cargo into autophagosomes during selective autophagy.

Huntingtin facilitates p62-mediated cargo recognition efficiency

Given the defective sequestration of selective cargo inside autophagosomes in Htt(−) cells and the direct interaction between Htt and p62, we investigated if Htt functions with p62 in cargo recognition. p62 is involved in selective autophagy by simultaneous binding with LC3 and ubiquitinated cargos for their subsequent engulfment by the forming autophagic membrane2. Cargo recognition by p62 initiates with the formation of sequestosomes (detergent resistant p62 bodies)2, 26. Accordingly, treatment with proteasome inhibitors gradually decreases soluble p62 and increased insoluble p62 in control cells. However, p62 redistribution and formation of large p62 bodies were no longer observed upon depletion of Htt (Fig. 7a–c and Supplementary Figure 7a–c; depletion of Beclin 1, essential for autophagosome formation1,25 is shown as positive control). In contrast, the fraction of cellular p62 degraded by autophagy during starvation did not change upon Htt knockdown (Supplementary Figure 7d).

Three functional domains in p62 coordinate its roles in selective autophagy: the self-polymerization (PB1) and ubiquitin-binding (UBA) domains are critical for p62 body formation2, and the middle motif (LIR) for its interaction with LC3 for cargo-based autophagic degradation29. We found that knockdown of Htt had no obvious effect on p62 polymerization (HA-p62 and Myc-p62 interaction) or its interaction with ubiquitinated proteins containing the K48 linkage-specific modification (Ub-K48), but strikingly reduced the amount of p62 that co-immunoprecipitated with ubiquitinated substrates containing the K63 linkage-specific modification30 (Ub-K63) (Supplementary Figure 7e–g). These findings were also reproduced using transfected HA-tagged Ub-K63 and Ub-K48 and pull downs with anti-HA (to discard non-specific antibody effects) (Supplementary Figure 7h–i) and in Htt-KO MEFs (to discard non-specific siRNA-mediated effects) (Fig. 7d–e). The above results raise the possibility that Tau-ΔC is also a target of Ub-K63 modification. Indeed, we found that Tau-ΔC protein was preferentially modified by Ub-K63 but not Ub-K48 in the inducible HeLa cells (Fig. 7f). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that p62 physically interacts with Tau-ΔC and their affinity was compromised after Htt knockdown (Fig. 7g). Overall these findings indicate that Htt facilitates p62 binding to Ub-K63-modified proteins that are preferentially degraded by selective autophagy31.

Lastly, we investigated the effect of Htt knockdown in the interaction of p62 with LC3. The ability of LC3 to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous p62 was markedly reduced in Htt(−) cells and, accordingly, colocalization of p62 and LC3 was also significantly reduced upon Htt loss (Fig. 7h–j). Although it is not possible to discriminate if the reduced p62 and LC3 interaction is primarily due to the loss of Htt or secondary to the inability of p62 to bind K63 ubiquitinated cargo, these findings uncover an essential role for Htt in p62-dependent cargo recognition required for proper sequestration of specific cargo into autophagosomes during selective autophagy.

Huntingtin/ULK1 and mTOR/ULK1 complexes are mutually exclusiveTo investigate the basis for the observed defective autophagosome biogenesis in Htt(−) cells in response to different stressors, we followed up on the physical (Fig. 6f) and genetic (Fig. 1c) interaction of Htt with ULK1, the kinase essential for initiation of both selective and nonselective autophagy25. In control cells, both starvation and proteotoxicity (proteasome inhibition) significantly boosted ULK1 kinase activity, measured as increased phosphorylation of MBP, a pseudo-substrate for ULK125, but Htt knockdown only attenuated proteasome inhibition-mediated ULK1 activation (Fig. 8a). These results suggest that Htt could contribute to regulate initiation of selective autophagy by modulating ULK1 activation while not affecting starvation induced nonselective autophagy. Consistent with this hypothesis, Htt has no significant impact on AMPK which positively regulates ULK1 kinase activity in response to energy depletion, presumably by interacting and phosphorylating ULK132–34. Htt knockdown did not disrupt the interaction between AMPK and ULK1, nor interfered with AMPK-mediated ULK1 phosphorylation at Ser555 (Supplementary Figure 8a,b), two mechanisms of regulation that are critical for AMPK-induced ULK1 activation35.To determine how Htt specifically activates selective autophagy but not nonselective autophagy when they both share common regulators including ULK1, we systematically examined several established mechanisms governing ULK1 kinase activity. Maximal activation of ULK1 is attained by forming a stable quaternary complex with FIP200, Atg13 and Atg10125. Pull-down assays revealed that Htt did not affect the stability of this complex (Supplementary Figure 8c). ULK1 is also regulated by the central nutrient sensor mTORC1, which binds to ULK1 and represses its kinase activity to prevent autophagy initiation. Inactivation of mTORC1 during starvation triggers release of active ULK1 from this complex and initiation of nonselective autophagy36, whereas the mechanisms that counterbalance the inhibitory effect of mTORC1 on ULK1 for activation of selective autophagy remain poorly understood. We first tested whether Htt affected the kinase activity of mTOR and consequently its inhibitory effect on ULK1. Neither Htt knockdown nor Htt overexpression showed any obvious effect on mTOR kinase activity when assessed by the phosphorylation of the downstream mTOR effector S6K at Thr38936 under basal conditions or upon activation of mTOR by the upstream regulator Rheb (Supplementary Figure 8d,e). This result was further confirmed by an in vitro kinase assay using GST-4E-BP1, a substrate readily phosphorylated by mTOR at Ser65 after mTOR activation. Ser65-GST-4E-BP1 phosphorylation was unaffected by Htt knockdown (Supplementary Figure 8f). Thus, Htt might not activate ULK1 by directly inhibiting mTOR activity.Excitingly, although ULK1 co-immunoprecipitated with Htt, mTOR, and Raptor, an adaptor protein critical for mTORC1 activity (Fig. 8b), Htt/ULK1 and mTOR/Raptor/ULK1 exist as two separate mutually exclusive complexes. Specifically, co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Htt could pull-down ULK1 but not mTOR or Raptor (Fig. 8c), and both mTOR and Raptor co-immunoprecipitated ULK1 but not Htt (Fig. 8d). Similar physical interactions were observed for endogenous Htt, ULK1 and mTOR proteins in MEFs (Fig. 8e,f; Htt-KO and ULK1-KO37 as controls) and neuroblastoma N2a cells (Supplementary Figure 8g–i), thus confirming the existence of two mutually exclusive ULK1/Htt and ULK1/mTOR complexes. This mutual exclusion indicates that Htt may promote ULK1 activation during selective autophagy by directly competing for the inhibitory binding of mTORC1 to ULK1. Indeed, under all three different stress conditions, we observed an increased interaction between ULK1 and Htt at the expense of mTOR, while Htt depletion largely abolished this competitive effect (Fig. 8g and Supplementary Figures 8j,k). Consistently, overexpression of Htt significantly blocked mTOR-mediated repression of ULK1. Basal ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of MBP can be detected in the kinase assay under rich nutritional conditions but not with the kinase-dead ULK1 mutant (FLAG-ULK1-KD) (Fig. 8a). This basal ULK1 activity is sensitive to regulation by mTOR, as overexpression of Myc-mTOR substantially repressed MBP phosphorylation and overexpression of a kinase-dead Myc-mTOR mutant showed the opposite effect, probably through a dominant-negative mechanism (Fig. 8h). Interestingly, overexpression of Htt significantly relieved this mTOR-mediated repression of basal ULK1 kinase activity (Fig. 8h), suggesting that Htt antagonizes the negative regulation of mTOR on ULK1 and promotes activation of selective autophagy even in the presence of active mTOR (rich media) by directly competing away ULK1 from the mTORC1/ULK1 complex. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Htt overexpression dramatically reduced the amount of endogenous mTOR and Raptor proteins associated with ULK1 (Fig. 8i), providing further support for this competition model. Changes in Htt protein levels may also contribute to modulate Htt function on autophagy under physiological conditions, since after exposure to stressors that induce selective autophagy but not in response to starvation, we found modest elevations of endogenous Htt levels in fibroblasts and neuroblastoma N2a cells (Supplementary Figure 8l,m).

DiscussionSelective autophagy is important for intracellular quality control and the cellular stress response but its regulation and how the autophagy machinery is recruited to the cargo for autophagosome formation are still poorly-defined processes. In this work, we show that Htt is a scaffold protein that promotes selective autophagy through its ability to simultaneously interact with components involved in two major autophagy steps, p62 and ULK1, and thus modulate both cargo recognition efficiency and autophagosome initiation. First, Htt releases the inhibitory effect of mTOR over ULK1, by directly competing away this kinase from the mTORC1 complex. Second, binding of Htt to p62 enhances the association between this cargo receptor and its Ub-K63-modified substrates. We propose a scaffolding role for Htt in selective autophagy whereby the ability of Htt to simultaneously bind ULK1 and p62 assures the spatial proximity between cargo recognition and autophagy initiation components (Fig. 8j).We found that Htt is required for at least three types of selective autophagy (aggregophagy, lipophagy and mitophagy) but is dispensable for starvation-induced autophagy. Selective recognition of cargo requires receptors including p62, and Htt facilitates p62-mediated cargo recognition, at least in part, by enhancing the affinity between p62 and Ub-K63-modified cargos38 and LC3. Selective formation of an autophagosome around the p62-recognized cargo has been attributed to the ability of p62 to simultaneously bind cargo and LC3. However, autophagy initiation requires events that precede lipid conjugation of LC3, such as recruitment to the sites of autophagosome formation of ULK1, one of the earliest autophagy effectors. We propose that Htt directs ULK1 to these sites by forming an Htt/ULK1 complex distinct from the mTOR/ULK1 complex. Of note, both Htt and mTOR contain HEAT repeats39, which could be the basis of their mutually exclusive interaction with ULK1 and of the Htt’s ability to compete UKL1/mTOR binding for maximal activation of selective autophagy. Under basal conditions, binding of Htt to the pool of constitutively active ULK1 identified in this study might be sufficient for preserving basal autophagy-dependent intracellular quality control, potentially by competing and shielding ULK1 from the inhibitory mTORC1 complex. Although how this competing activity of Htt is repressed under basal conditions requires future investigation, it is possible that changes in Htt levels, subcellular location or its myriad of posttranslational modifications40–47 could contribute to regulate Htt’s function to fine-tune the proper cellular autophagic response against a variety of cellular stresses.Noticeably, animals deficient for Htt, ULK1 and p62 show distinctive phenotypes. Htt KO mice die at embryonic day E7.548–50, whereas p62 and ULK1-KO are viable37, 51–54. These differences are likely partially due to the additional roles each protein plays besides autophagy. For example, the earlier lethality of the Htt-KO has been primarily attributed to Htt’s essential role in extraembryonic tissues55, 56. Furthermore, only one Htt gene exists in both the fly and most vertebrate genomes, whereas ULK1 and ULK2 seem capable to compensate from each other37, 53, 54, 57 and the function of p62 in autophagic cargo recognition shows some redundancy with other receptors such as NBR1. Interestingly, p62-KO mice display adult onset neurodegeneration with elevated level of K63-ubiquitinated Tau in the brain58, 59, reminiscent of the brain degeneration observed upon reduced Htt expression or Htt postnatal deletion60, 61.Connections of Htt with autophagy have previously been described11, 42, 62–64 and we also reported autophagy abnormalities (“empty autophagosomes” phenotype) in the context of HD12. Since deleting polyQ tract in Htt enhances neuronal autophagic activity and longevity in mice65, it is attractive to propose that polyQ expansion compromises Htt’s role in selective autophagy.
