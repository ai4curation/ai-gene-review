The Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) family of transcription factors regulates 
the expression of a wide range of genes critical for immune and inflammatory 
responses, cell survival, immune development, and cell proliferation. 
Dysregulated NF-kappaB activity occurs in a number of chronic inflammatory 
diseases and certain types of cancers making NF-kappaB signaling an attractive 
target for the development of anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drugs. A pivotal 
regulator of all inducible NF-kappaB signaling pathways is the IkappaB kinase 
(IKK) complex that consists of two kinases (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a 
regulatory subunit named NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). Genetic analysis 
of the IKK complex has identified two separate pathways named the classical and 
non-canonical mechanisms that are dependent on either NEMO and IKKbeta 
(classical) or IKKalpha alone (non-canonical). To better understand the 
mechanisms that regulate IKK complex activity and to address the differential 
functions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta we have molecularly dissected the IKKs. We 
describe here how these studies have identified a unique inhibitor of 
pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB signaling, an unforeseen role for IKKalpha in the 
classical NF-kappaB pathway, and a novel functional domain in IKKbeta that is 
not present in IKKalpha.
