Small GTPases are molecular switches that have critical biological roles and are 
controlled by GTPase-activating proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors 
(GEFs). The smg GDP dissociation stimulator (SmgGDS) protein functions as a GEF 
for the RhoA and RhoC small GTPases. SmgGDS has various regulatory roles, 
including small GTPase trafficking and localization and as a molecular 
chaperone, and interacts with many small GTPases possessing polybasic regions. 
Two SmgGDS splice variants, SmgGDS-558 and SmgGDS-607, differ in GEF activity 
and binding affinity for RhoA depending on the lipidation state, but the reasons 
for these differences are unclear. Here we determined the crystal structure of 
SmgGDS-558, revealing a fold containing tandem copies of armadillo repeats not 
present in other GEFs. We also observed that SmgGDS harbors distinct positively 
and negatively charged regions, both of which play critical roles in binding to 
RhoA and GEF activity. This is the first report demonstrating a relationship 
between the molecular function and atomic structure of SmgGDS. Our findings 
indicate that the two SmgGDS isoforms differ in GTPase binding and GEF activity, 
depending on the lipidation state, thus providing useful information about the 
cellular functions of SmgGDS in cells.
