Clip domain serine protease homologs are widely distributed in insect genomes 
and play important roles in regulating insect immune responses, yet their exact 
functions remain poorly understood. Here, we show that CLIPA2, a clip domain 
serine protease homolog of Anopheles gambiae, regulates the consumption of the 
mosquito complement-like protein TEP1 during systemic bacterial infections. We 
provide evidence that CLIPA2 localizes to microbial surfaces in a TEP1-dependent 
manner whereby it negatively regulates the activity of a putative TEP1 
convertase, which converts the full-length TEP1-F form into active TEP1cut. 
CLIPA2 silencing triggers an exacerbated TEP1-mediated response that 
significantly enhances mosquito resistance to infections with a broad class of 
microorganisms including Plasmodium berghei, Escherichia coli and the 
entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. We also provide further evidence for 
the existence of a functional link between TEP1 and activation of hemolymph 
prophenoloxidase during systemic infections. Interestingly, the enhanced 
TEP1-mediated immune response in CLIPA2 knockdown mosquitoes correlated with a 
significant reduction in fecundity, corroborating the existence of a trade-off 
between immunity and reproduction. In sum, CLIPA2 is an integral regulatory 
component of the mosquito complement-like pathway which functions to prevent an 
overwhelming response by the host in response to systemic infections.
