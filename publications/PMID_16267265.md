The division of one cell into two requires the coordination of multiple 
components. We describe a gene, car-1, whose product may provide a link between 
disparate cellular processes. Inhibition of car-1 expression in Caenorhabditis 
elegans embryos causes late cytokinesis failures: cleavage furrows ingress but 
subsequently regress and the spindle midzone fails to form, even though midzone 
components are present. The localized accumulation of membrane that normally 
develops at the apex of the cleavage furrow during the final phase of 
cytokinesis does not occur and organization of the endoplasmic reticulum is 
aberrant, indicative of a disruption in membrane trafficking. The car-1 gene has 
homologues in a number of species, including proteins that associate with RNA 
binding proteins. CAR-1 localizes to P-granules (germ-line specific 
ribonucleoprotein particles) and discrete, developmentally regulated cytoplasmic 
foci. These foci also contain DCAP-1, a protein involved in decapping mRNAs. 
Thus, CAR-1, a protein likely to be associated with RNA metabolism, plays an 
essential role in the late stage of cytokinesis, suggesting a novel link between 
RNA, membrane trafficking and cytokinesis in the C. elegans embryo.
