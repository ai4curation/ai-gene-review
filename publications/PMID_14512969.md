Hereditary cataract is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous lens disease 
that accounts for a significant proportion of visual impairment and blindness in 
childhood. The alphaA-crystallin (CRYAA) gene (CRYAA) encodes a member of the 
small-heat-shock protein (sHSP) family of molecular chaperones and is primarily 
and abundantly expressed in the ocular lens. Here, we have used linkage analysis 
to identify a novel missense mutation in CRYAA that underlies an autosomal 
dominant form of 'nuclear' cataract segregating in a four-generation Caucasian 
family. A maximum two-point LOD score (Z(max)) of 2.19 (maximum recombination 
fraction, theta(max)=0) and multipoint Z(max) of 3.3 (theta(max)=0) was obtained 
at marker D21S1885. Haplotype analysis indicated that the disease gene lay in 
the approximately 2.7 Mb physical interval between D21S1912 and D21S1260 
flanking CRYAA on 21q22.3. Sequence analysis identified a C --> T transition in 
exon 1 of CRYAA from affected individuals that was predicted to result in the 
nonconservative substitution of cysteine for arginine at codon 49 (R49C). 
Transfection studies of lens epithelial cells revealed that, unlike wild-type 
CRYAA, the R49C mutant protein was abnormally localized to the nucleus and 
failed to protect from staurosporine-induced apoptotic cell death. This study 
has identified the first dominant cataract mutation in CRYAA located outside the 
phylogenetically conserved 'alpha-crystallin core domain' of the sHSP family.
