Import of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins into mitochondria and their 
subsequent sorting into mitochondrial subcompartments is mediated by translocase 
enzymes in the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes. Precursor proteins 
carrying amino-terminal targeting signals are translocated into the matrix by 
the integral inner membrane proteins Tim23 and Tim17 in cooperation with Tim44 
and mitochondrial Hsp70. We describe here the discovery of a new pathway for the 
transport of members of the mitochondrial carrier family and other inner 
membrane proteins that contain internal targeting signals. Two related proteins 
in the intermembrane space, Tim10/Mrs11 and Tim12/Mrs5, interact sequentially 
with these precursors and facilitate their translocation across the outer 
membrane, irrespective of the membrane potential. Tim10 and Tim12 are found in a 
complex with Tim22, which takes over the precursor and mediates its 
membrane-potential-dependent insertion into the inner membrane. This interaction 
of Tim10 and Tim12 with the precursors depends on the presence of divalent metal 
ions. Both proteins contain a zinc-finger-like motif with four cysteines and 
bind equimolar amounts of zinc ions.
