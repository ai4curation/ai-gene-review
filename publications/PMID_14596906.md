In acute myelogenous and lymphoid leukemias, rearrangements involving the MLL 
(mixed lineage leukemia) gene at chromosome 11q23 are frequent. The truncated 
MLL protein is fused in-frame to a series of partner proteins. We previously 
identified the formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17) as such an MLL fusion partner. 
In this study, we explored in vivo physiological interaction partners of FBP17 
using a two-hybrid assay and found tankyrase (TNKS), an ADP-ribose polymerase 
protein involved in telomere maintenance and mitogen-activated protein kinase 
signaling. We demonstrate that FBP17 binds via a special TNKS-binding motif to 
tankyrase. The physiological relevance is indicated by co-immunoprecipitation of 
endogenous proteins in 293T cells.
