DIXDC1 is a Dishevelled-Axin (DIX) domain-containing protein involved in neural 
development and Wnt signaling pathway. Besides the DIX domain, DIXDC1 also 
contains a coiled-coil domain (MTH domain), which is a common feature of 
centrosomal proteins. We have demonstrated that exogenously expressed GFP-tag 
fused DIXDC1 co-localize with gamma-tubulin both at interphase and mitotic phase 
in HEK293 cells. By immunostaining with anti-DIXDC1 and anti-gamma-tubulin 
antibody, endogenous DIXDC1 was also co-localized with gamma-tubulin at the 
centrosomes in HEK293 cells. We confirmed this interaction of DIXDC1 with 
gamma-tubulin by co-immunoprecipitation. The findings suggest that DIXDC1 might 
play an important role in chromosome segregation and cell cycle regulation.
