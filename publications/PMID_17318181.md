To maintain genome integrity, eukaryotic cells initiate DNA replication once per 
cell cycle after assembling prereplicative complexes (preRCs) on chromatin at 
the end of mitosis and during G1. In S phase, preRCs are disassembled, 
precluding initiation of another round of replication. Cdt1 is a key member of 
the preRC and its correct regulation via proteolysis and by its inhibitor 
Geminin is essential to prevent premature re-replication. Using quantitative 
fluorescence microscopy, we study the interactions of Cdt1 with chromatin and 
Geminin in living cells. We find that Cdt1 exhibits dynamic interactions with 
chromatin throughout G1 phase and that the protein domains responsible for 
chromatin and Geminin interactions are separable. Contrary to existing in vitro 
data, we show that Cdt1 simultaneously binds Geminin and chromatin in vivo, 
thereby recruiting Geminin onto chromatin. We propose that dynamic 
Cdt1-chromatin associations and the recruitment of Geminin to chromatin provide 
spatio-temporal control of the licensing process.
