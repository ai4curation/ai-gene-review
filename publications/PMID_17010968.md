The tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) converting enzyme (ADAM17) is a 
metalloprotease-disintegrin responsible for the cleavage of several biologically 
active transmembrane proteins. However, the substrate specificity of ADAM17 and 
the regulation of its shedding activity are still poorly understood. Here, we 
report that during its transport through the Golgi apparatus, ADAM17 is included 
in cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) where its prodomain is 
cleaved by furin. Consequently, ADAM17 shedding activity is sequestered in lipid 
rafts, which is confirmed by the fact that metalloproteinase inhibition 
increases the proportion of ADAM17 substrates (TNF and its receptors TNFR1 and 
TNFR2) in lipid rafts. Membrane cholesterol depletion increases the 
ADAM17-dependent shedding of these substrates demonstrating the importance of 
lipid rafts in the control of this process. Furthermore, ADAM17 substrates are 
present in different proportions in lipid rafts, suggesting that the entry of 
each of these substrates in these particular membrane microdomains is 
specifically regulated. Our data support the idea that one of the mechanisms 
regulating ADAM17 substrate cleavage involves protein partitioning in lipid 
rafts.
