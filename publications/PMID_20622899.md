PBK/TOPK (PDZ-binding kinase, T-LAK-cell-originated protein kinase) is a 
serine-threonine kinase that is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells but 
its role in oncogenesis remains unclear. Here we show, by co-immunoprecipitation 
experiments and yeast two-hybrid analysis, that PBK/TOPK physically interacts 
with the tumor suppressor p53 through its DNA-binding (DBD) domain in HCT116 
colorectal carcinoma cells that express wild-type p53. PBK also binds to p53 
mutants carrying five common point mutations in the DBD domain. The PBK-p53 
interaction appears to downmodulate p53 transactivation function as indicated by 
PBK/TOPK knockdown experiments, which show upregulated expression of the key p53 
target gene and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in HCT116 cells, 
particularly after genotoxic damage from doxorubicin. Furthermore, stable 
PBK/TOPK knockdown cell lines (derived from HCT116 and MCF-7 cells) showed 
increased apoptosis, G(2)/M arrest and slower growth as compared to stable empty 
vector-transfected control cell lines. Gene microarray studies identified 
additional p53 target genes involved in apoptosis or cell cycling, which were 
differentially regulated by PBK knockdown. Together, these data suggest that 
increased levels of PBK/TOPK may contribute to tumor cell development and 
progression through suppression of p53 function and consequent reductions in the 
cell-cycle regulatory proteins such as p21. PBK/TOPK may therefore be a valid 
target for antineoplastic kinase inhibitors to sensitize tumor cells to 
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and growth suppression.
