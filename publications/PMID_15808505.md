Akt/protein kinase B critically regulates the balance between cell survival and 
apoptosis. Phosphorylation of Akt at two key sites, the activation loop and the 
hydrophobic motif, activates the kinase and promotes cell survival. The 
mechanism of dephosphorylation and signal termination is unknown. Here, we 
identify a protein phosphatase, PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein 
phosphatase (PHLPP), that specifically dephosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of 
Akt (Ser473 in Akt1), triggering apoptosis and suppressing tumor growth. The 
effects of PHLPP on apoptosis are prevented in cells expressing an S473D 
construct of Akt, revealing that the hydrophobic motif is the primary cellular 
target of PHLPP. PHLPP levels are markedly reduced in several colon cancer and 
glioblastoma cell lines that have elevated Akt phosphorylation. Reintroduction 
of PHLPP into a glioblastoma cell line causes a dramatic suppression of tumor 
growth. These data are consistent with PHLPP terminating Akt signaling by 
directly dephosphorylating and inactivating Akt.
