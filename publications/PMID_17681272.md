Transcriptional activation in yeast INO1 chromatin was studied using the 
indirect end-labeling technique. INO1 chromatin is organized into an ordered, 
overlapping nucleosomal array under repressing conditions. Nucleosome positions 
were only disrupted at the promoter region under inducing conditions in the 
presence of SWI/SNF and INO80. Mutants lacking either remodeler demonstrated 
identical positioning patterns as the wild type under repressing conditions. 
This indicates that these two remodelers are responsible and essential for local 
nucleosomal mobilization at the INO1 promoter. The area of local nucleosome 
movement is consistent with the previously identified region of histone 
deacetylation activity. In light of these findings, we suggest that nucleosomes 
subject to local mobilization are also targets for local histone modifications.
