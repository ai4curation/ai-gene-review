Ferroptosis is evolving as a highly promising approach to combat 
difficult-to-treat tumour entities including therapy-refractory and 
dedifferentiating cancers1-3. Recently, ferroptosis suppressor protein-1 (FSP1), 
along with extramitochondrial ubiquinone or exogenous vitamin K and NAD(P)H/H+ 
as an electron donor, has been identified as the second ferroptosis-suppressing 
system, which efficiently prevents lipid peroxidation independently of the 
cyst(e)ine-glutathione (GSH)-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) axis4-6. To develop 
FSP1 inhibitors as next-generation therapeutic ferroptosis inducers, here we 
performed a small molecule library screen and identified the compound class of 
3-phenylquinazolinones (represented by icFSP1) as potent FSP1 inhibitors. We 
show that icFSP1, unlike iFSP1, the first described on-target FSP1 inhibitor5, 
does not competitively inhibit FSP1 enzyme activity, but instead triggers 
subcellular relocalization of FSP1 from the membrane and FSP1 condensation 
before ferroptosis induction, in synergism with GPX4 inhibition. icFSP1-induced 
FSP1 condensates show droplet-like properties consistent with phase separation, 
an emerging and widespread mechanism to modulate biological activity7. 
N-terminal myristoylation, distinct amino acid residues and intrinsically 
disordered, low-complexity regions in FSP1 were identified to be essential for 
FSP1-dependent phase separation in cells and in vitro. We further demonstrate 
that icFSP1 impairs tumour growth and induces FSP1 condensates in tumours in 
vivo. Hence, our results suggest that icFSP1 exhibits a unique mechanism of 
action and synergizes with ferroptosis-inducing agents to potentiate the 
ferroptotic cell death response, thus providing a rationale for targeting 
FSP1-dependent phase separation as an efficient anti-cancer therapy.
