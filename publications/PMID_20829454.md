Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein, and the 
microtubule-associated protein tau are key pathogenic factors in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). How exactly they impair cognitive functions is unknown. We 
assessed the effects of Aβ and tau on axonal transport of mitochondria and the 
neurotrophin receptor TrkA, cargoes that are critical for neuronal function and 
survival and whose distributions are altered in AD. Aβ oligomers rapidly 
inhibited axonal transport of these cargoes in wild-type neurons. Lowering tau 
levels prevented these defects without affecting baseline axonal transport. 
Thus, Aβ requires tau to impair axonal transport, and tau reduction protects 
against Aβ-induced axonal transport defects.
