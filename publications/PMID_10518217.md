The ability of p53 to function as a transcription factor is instrumental in 
facilitating the response to cellular stress, and p300/CBP proteins, which act 
as coactivators for diverse transcription factors, participate in regulating p53 
activity. We report a novel cofactor for p300 that facilitates the p53 response 
by augmenting p53-dependent transcription and apoptosis. JMY and p300 associate 
in physiological conditions, and, during the cellular stress response, the 
p300/JMY complex is recruited to activated p53. The bax gene is efficiently 
activated by JMY, and protein isoforms that arise through alternative splicing 
alter the functional outcome of the p53 response. The results provide compelling 
evidence that the p300/JMY coactivator complex plays a central role in 
facilitating the p53 response.
