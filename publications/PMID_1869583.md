The YDJ1 (yeast dnaJ) gene was isolated from a yeast expression library using 
antisera made against a yeast nuclear sub-fraction termed the matrix lamina pore 
complex. The predicted open reading frame displays a 32% identity with the 
sequence of the Escherichia coli heat shock protein dnaJ. Localization of YDJ1 
protein (YDJ1p) by indirect immunofluorescence reveals it to be concentrated in 
a perinuclear ring as well as in the cytoplasm. YDJ1p cofractionates with nuclei 
and also microsomes, suggesting that its perinuclear localization reflects 
association with the ER. YDJ1p is required for normal growth and disruption of 
its gene results in very slow growing cells that have pleiotropic morphological 
defects. Haploid cells carrying the disrupted YDJ1 gene are inviable for growth 
in liquid media. We further show that a related yeast protein, SIS1, is a 
multicopy suppressor of YDJ1.
