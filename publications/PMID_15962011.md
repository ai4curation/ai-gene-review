The ubiquitin ligase Cbl mediates ubiquitination of activated receptor tyrosine 
kinases (RTKs) and interacts with endocytic scaffold complexes, including 
CIN85/endophilins, to facilitate RTK endocytosis and degradation. Several 
mechanisms regulate the functions of Cbl to ensure the fine-tuning of RTK 
signalling and cellular homeostasis. One regulatory mechanism involves the 
binding of Cbl to Sprouty2, which sequesters Cbl away from activated epidermal 
growth factor receptors (EGFRs). Here, we show that Sprouty2 associates with 
CIN85 and acts at the interface between Cbl and CIN85 to inhibit EGFR 
downregulation. The CIN85 SH3 domains A and C bind specifically to 
proline-arginine motifs present in Sprouty2. Intact association between 
Sprouty2, Cbl and CIN85 is required for inhibition of EGFR endocytosis as well 
as EGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. Moreover, Sprouty4, which lacks 
CIN85-binding sites, does not inhibit EGFR downregulation, providing a molecular 
explanation for functional differences between Sprouty isoforms. Sprouty2 
therefore acts as an inducible inhibitor of EGFR downregulation by targeting 
both the Cbl and CIN85 pathways.

Abstract

The ubiquitin ligase Cbl mediates ubiquitination of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and interacts with endocytic scaffold complexes, including CIN85/endophilins, to facilitate RTK endocytosis and degradation. Several mechanisms regulate the functions of Cbl to ensure the fine-tuning of RTK signalling and cellular homeostasis. One regulatory mechanism involves the binding of Cbl to Sprouty2, which sequesters Cbl away from activated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs). Here, we show that Sprouty2 associates with CIN85 and acts at the interface between Cbl and CIN85 to inhibit EGFR downregulation. The CIN85 SH3 domains A and C bind specifically to proline–arginine motifs present in Sprouty2. Intact association between Sprouty2, Cbl and CIN85 is required for inhibition of EGFR endocytosis as well as EGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. Moreover, Sprouty4, which lacks CIN85-binding sites, does not inhibit EGFR downregulation, providing a molecular explanation for functional differences between Sprouty isoforms. Sprouty2 therefore acts as an inducible inhibitor of EGFR downregulation by targeting both the Cbl and CIN85 pathways.

Introduction

Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by growth factors induces intracellular signalling pathways that determine whether the cell proliferates, differentiates or undergoes apoptosis. Activated receptors also initiate negative signalling events that modulate the positive signals to precisely regulate the biological outcome ( Dikic & Giordano, 2003 ). Many of the key molecules involved in negative receptor signalling control receptor endocytosis. The Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases has an important role in this process, mediating multiple monoubiquitination of activated RTKs, which targets them for lysosomal degradation ( Haglund et al , 2003a , 2003b ; Mosesson et al , 2003 ). Moreover, Cbl recruits endocytic complexes, including the Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa (CIN85)/endophilins, to activated RTKs to facilitate endocytosis ( Petrelli et al , 2002 ; Soubeyran et al , 2002 ). Several recent findings indicate that RTK signalling can be finely adjusted by regulating the functions of Cbl. At least three different mechanisms of Cbl regulation have been described: (i) sequestration of Cbl away from activated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) by means of phosphorylated Sprouty2 or activated Cdc42 in complex with βPix ( Christofori, 2003 ; Wu et al , 2003 ; Kim & Barsagi, 2004 ); (ii) proteasome-mediated degradation of Cbl ( Bao et al , 2003 ); and (iii) interference with ubiquitin-dependent sorting of activated receptors in the endosome by means of Sts-1 and Sts-2 ( Kowanetz et al , 2004 ).

One of the best-studied inhibitors of Cbl is Sprouty2, an inducible regulator that becomes phosphorylated on a conserved tyrosine residue (Y55) after EGFR activation. This phosphorylated tyrosine functions as a docking site for the SH2 domain of Cbl, and competes with pY1045 in the activated EGFR ( Egan et al , 2002 ; Fong et al , 2003 ; Hall et al , 2003 ; Rubin et al , 2003 ). Thus, Sprouty2 removes Cbl from activated EGFRs and blocks Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, which leads to sustained receptor signalling ( Wong et al , 2002 ; Fong et al , 2003 ; Hall et al , 2003 ; Rubin et al , 2003 ). However, other Sprouty isoforms, such as Sprouty3 and Sprouty4, do not interfere with EGFR downregulation, in spite of containing a Cbl-binding motif ( Wong et al , 2002 ). Differences between the individual Sprouty family members are not yet fully understood, but findings presented in this manuscript could help in explaining this apparent anomaly. We show how Sprouty2 associates with CIN85 and acts at the interface between Cbl and CIN85 to inhibit EGFR ubiquitination and downregulation.

Discussion

Here, we report that the inhibitory effect of Sprouty2 on EGFR endocytosis depends on its interference with the functions of both Cbl and CIN85. Ligand stimulation of EGFRs leads to the recruitment of Cbl and CIN85 to activated receptors, inducing their endocytosis and degradation ( Dikic & Giordano, 2003 ). EGF stimulation also leads to synthesis of Sprouty2, its targeting to the receptor complexes and sequestration of Cbl away from activated EGFRs. Our data indicate that Sprouty2 can constitutively interact with two SH3 domains of CIN85 ( Figs 1 , 2 and 3 ), whereas the third SH3 domain of CIN85 can still associate with Cbl on cell activation ( Fig 4 ; Kowanetz et al , 2003 ). This allows Sprouty2 to block CIN85-mediated clustering of Cbl molecules, a step that is important for stabilization of Cbl–EGFR interactions and efficient ubiquitination and downregulation of EGFR ( Kowanetz et al , 2003 ). Moreover, in this way, CIN85 may contribute to the translocation of Sprouty2 to Cbl/EGFR complexes, where phosphorylated Sprouty2 can compete with activated EGFRs for binding of the SH2 domain of Cbl. In such a scenario, Sprouty2 requires binding to both CIN85 and Cbl to inhibit EGFR endocytosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, the loss of either CIN85 or Cbl binding to Sprouty2 allows EGFR downregulation to occur normally in the presence of the mutant Sprouty2 molecules ( Fig 4 ).

Furthermore, our results provide more clues to the opposing actions of different Sprouty family members. Whereas all isoforms in mammals and Drosophila contain the conserved Cbl-binding tyrosine residue Y55, only mammalian Sprouty2 and Sprouty1 are able to inhibit EGFR endocytosis ( Wong et al , 2002 ; Fong et al , 2003 ; Hall et al , 2003 ; Rubin et al , 2003 ). The functional differences could be explained by the differential recruitment of distinct Sprouty isoforms to the EGFR/Cbl complex. In accordance, our findings show that the ability of Sprouty isoforms to bind to CIN85 correlates with their ability to inhibit EGFR endocytosis. For example, binding between Sprouty2 and CIN85 is required for Sprouty2-mediated inhibition of EGFR downregulation and induction of PC12 cell differentiation ( Fig 4 ). Conversely, Sprouty4, which does not bind to CIN85 ( Fig 3 ), fails to block EGFR downregulation ( supplementary Fig 4 online) and is thus unable to promote neurite outgrowth in response to EGF ( Wong et al , 2002 ).

The general significance of the mechanisms described here is underlined by our recent findings that another EGF-induced feedback regulator of Cbl, βPix, also targets the Cbl/CIN85 interface to inhibit Cbl-mediated EGFR downregulation (M.H.H.S. and I.D., unpublished results). In conclusion, these results, along with several recent reports ( Hall et al , 2003 ; Rubin et al , 2003 ; Wu et al , 2003 ), point to the crucial role of Sprouty2 and βPix in blocking the Cbl/CIN85 interface and fine-tuning receptor endocytosis, which is implicated in both physiological and pathological conditions.

Methods

Reagents, antibodies and plasmids. EGF was from Intergen (Oxford, UK) and 125 I-EGF was from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA, USA). Antibodies against CIN85, EGFR and Cbl have been described previously ( Soubeyran et al , 2002 ). Antibodies against Myc (9E10) were from Babco (Princeton, NJ, USA), FLAG (M2) from Sigma Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA), haemagglutinin (HA; 12CA5) from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany) and phosphotyrosine (pY99) from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Antibodies against Sprouty2 were a gift from Hong Joo Kim, Dafna Barsagi, Chanan Rubin and Yosef Yarden. Human Sprouty2 and Sprouty2-Y55A in pcDNA3–6 × Myc were provided by Atsuo Sasaki and Akihiko Yoshimura (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). HA–G306E-70Z-Cbl in pBABEpuro was provided by Wallace Y. Langdon (The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia). Mouse Sprouty1 and Sprouty4 and human Sprouty2-CT (residues 178–315) in pXJ40–FLAG have been described previously ( Wong et al , 2001 , 2002 ). pRK5–EGFR, pRK5–Cbl, pcDNA3–HA–ubiquitin, pcDNA3–FLAG–CIN85 and GST fusion proteins of SH3 domains A, B and C of CIN85 have been described previously ( Soubeyran et al , 2002 ; Haglund et al , 2003b ).

Site-directed mutagenesis. Sprouty2 arginine to alanine mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. pcDNA3–6 × Myc–Sprouty2-NT was constructed by inserting a stop codon at the position of amino acid 178. The pXJ40–Sprouty4/2 chimaera was engineered by PCR by introducing the CIN85-binding sites (LK P A PR -72 and P TVP PR -309) at corresponding sites in the Sprouty4 sequence. Oligonucleotide sequences are available on request.

Cell culture and biochemical studies. Cell culture, transfections, cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down assays, SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting were performed as described previously ( Wong et al , 2002 ; Haglund et al , 2003b , 2004 ). C2C12 cells were provided by Hong Joo Kim and Dafna Barsagi and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% calf serum and antibiotics. For EGFR downregulation assays, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with EGFR, Cbl and Sprouty2, various Sprouty2 mutants, Sprouty1, Sprouty4, the Sprouty4/2 chimaera or GFP as a control. The amount of EGFR molecules remaining at the cellular membrane was determined by measuring surface-bound 125 I-labelled EGF after stimulation with EGF for the indicated durations, as described ( Kowanetz et al , 2004 ). The percentage of surface receptor was calculated by comparing the values of EGFstimulated cells and nonstimulated cells. Each time point was measured in triplicate and the experiments were repeated twice.

Immunofluorescence. PC12 cells were seeded on poly- D -lysine-coated coverslips and transfected using the GenePORTER™ Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA, USA). At 24 h after transfection, cells were subjected to either low serum or 100 ng/ml EGF for 4 days. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and stained with a polyclonal antibody directed against the c-Myc epitope tag (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, USA) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). Images were visualized and captured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
