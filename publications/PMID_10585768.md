We have previously identified a chromosomal rearrangement between fibroblast 
growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and a novel gene, FRAG1, in a rodent model of 
osteosarcoma. To assess the potential role of FRAG1 in disease further, we have 
isolated cDNA and genomic clones of human FRAG1. Sequence analysis of the cDNA 
revealed the presence of an insertion not contained in the original FRAG1 
sequence. This insertion in human FRAG1 encoded a region highly homologous to 
and immediately following the first 55 amino acids of the protein, indicating 
the presence of a repetitive domain within FRAG1, designated the FRAG1 homology 
(FH) domain. Analysis of FRAG1 gene structure revealed that the FH domains were 
encoded by tandem duplicated exons. Database searches identified several 
transmembrane proteins displaying homology to the FH domain of FRAG1. In 
addition, hydropathy analysis predicted FRAG1 to encode an integral membrane 
protein with multiple membrane-spanning segments. FRAG1 mRNA was ubiquitously 
expressed in human adult tissues and several tumor cell lines at varying levels 
of abundance. Human FRAG1 was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization and 
radiation hybrid analysis to chromosome 11 at band p15.5, a region implicated in 
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and a region of frequent loss of heterozygosity in 
multiple tumor types. These results suggest that FRAG1 may be a useful candidate 
gene for genetic disorders associated with alterations at 11p15.5.
