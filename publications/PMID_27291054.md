The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton forms a dynamic filamentous network that is 
essential for many processes, including mitosis, cell polarity and shape, 
neurite outgrowth and migration, and ciliogenesis [1, 2]. MTs are built up of 
α/β-tubulin heterodimers, and their dynamic behavior is in part regulated 
by tubulin-associated proteins (TAPs). Here we describe a novel system to study 
mammalian tubulins and TAPs. We co-expressed equimolar amounts of triple-tagged 
α-tubulin and β-tubulin using a 2A "self-cleaving" peptide and isolated 
functional fluorescent tubulin dimers from transfected HEK293T cells with a 
rapid two-step approach. We also produced two mutant tubulins that cause brain 
malformations in tubulinopathy patients [3]. We then applied a paired 
mass-spectrometry-based method to identify tubulin-binding proteins in HEK293T 
cells and describe both novel and known TAPs. We find that CKAP5 and the CLASPs, 
which are MT plus-end-tracking proteins with TOG(L)-domains [4], bind tubulin 
efficiently, as does the Golgi-associated protein GCC185, which interacts with 
the CLASPs [5]. The N-terminal TOGL domain of CLASP1 contributes to tubulin 
binding and allows CLASP1 to function as an autonomous MT-growth-promoting 
factor. Interestingly, mutant tubulins bind less well to a number of TAPs, 
including CLASPs and GCC185, and incorporate less efficiently into cellular MTs. 
Moreover, expression of these mutants in cells impairs several MT-growth-related 
processes involving TAPs. Thus, stable tubulin-TAP interactions regulate MT 
nucleation and growth in cells. Combined, our results provide a resource for 
investigating tubulin interactions and functions and widen the spectrum of 
tubulin-related disease mechanisms.
