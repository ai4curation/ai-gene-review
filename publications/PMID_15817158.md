Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and nephronophthisis (NPH) 
share two common features: cystic kidneys and ciliary localized gene products. 
Mutation in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene accounts for 95% of all ADPKD cases. 
Mutation in one of four genes (NPHP1-4) results in nephronophthisis. The NPHP1, 
NPHP2, PKD1, and PKD2 protein products (nephrocystin-1, nephrocystin-2 or 
inversin, polycystin-1, and polycystin-2, respectively) localize to primary 
cilia of renal epithelia. However, the relationship between the nephrocystins 
and polycystins, if any, is unknown. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the 
LOV-1 and PKD-2 polycystins localize to male-specific sensory cilia and are 
required for male mating behaviors. To test the hypothesis that ADPKD and NPH 
cysts arise from a common defect in cilia, we characterized the C. elegans 
homologs of NPHP1 and NPHP4. C. elegans nphp-1 and nphp-4 are expressed in a 
subset of sensory neurons. GFP-tagged NPHP-1 and NPHP-4 proteins localize to 
ciliated sensory endings of dendrites and colocalize with PKD-2 in male-specific 
sensory cilia. The cilia of nphp-1(ok500) and nphp-4(tm925) mutants are intact. 
nphp-1; nphp-4 double, but not single, mutant males are response defective. We 
propose that NPHP-1 and NPHP-4 proteins play important and redundant roles in 
facilitating ciliary sensory signal transduction.
