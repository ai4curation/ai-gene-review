RGS proteins comprise a family of proteins named for their ability to negatively 
regulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling. Biochemical studies suggest that 
members of this protein family act as GTPase-activating proteins for certain 
Galpha subunits, thereby accelerating the turn-off mechanism of Galpha and 
terminating signaling by both Galpha and Gbetagamma subunits. In the present 
study, we used confocal microscopy to examine the intracellular distribution of 
several RGS proteins in COS-7 cells expressing RGS-green fluorescent protein 
(GFP) fusion proteins and in cells expressing RGS proteins endogenously. RGS2 
and RGS10 accumulated in the nucleus of COS-7 cells transfected with GFP 
constructs of these proteins. In contrast, RGS4 and RGS16 accumulated in the 
cytoplasm of COS-7 transfectants. As observed in COS-7 cells, RGS4 exhibited 
cytoplasmic localization in mouse neuroblastoma cells, and RGS10 exhibited 
nuclear localization in human glioma cells. Deletion or alanine substitution of 
an N-terminal leucine repeat motif present in both RGS4 and RGS16, a domain 
identified as a nuclear export sequence in HIV Rev and other proteins, promoted 
nuclear localization of these proteins in COS-7 cells. In agreement with this 
observation, treatment of mouse neuroblastoma cells with leptomycin B to inhibit 
nuclear protein export by exportin1 resulted in accumulation of RGS4 in the 
nucleus of these cells. GFP fusions of RGS domains of RGS proteins localized in 
the nucleus, suggesting that nuclear localization of RGS proteins results from 
nuclear targeting via RGS domain sequences. RGSZ, which shares with RGS-GAIP a 
cysteine-rich string in its N-terminal region, localized to the Golgi complex in 
COS-7 cells. Deletion of the N-terminal domain of RGSZ that includes the 
cysteine motif promoted nuclear localization of RGSZ. None of the RGS proteins 
examined were localized at the plasma membrane. These results demonstrate that 
RGS proteins localize in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or shuttle between the 
nucleus and cytoplasm as nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttle proteins. RGS proteins 
localize differentially within cells as a result of structural differences among 
these proteins that do not appear to be important determinants for their G 
protein-regulating activities. These findings suggest involvement of RGS 
proteins in more complex cellular functions than currently envisioned.
