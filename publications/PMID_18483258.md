UVA (315-400 nm), which constitutes approximately 95% of the UV irradiation in 
natural sunlight, represents a major environmental challenge to the skin and is 
clearly associated with human skin cancer. Here, we show that a low, nonlethal 
dose of UVA induces dose-dependent cell cycle progression in human HaCaT 
keratinocytes. We found that UVA induced cyclin D1 accumulation, whereas siRNA 
knockdown of cyclin D1 blocked the UVA-induced cell cycle progression, 
indicating that this process is mediated by cyclin D1. UVA irradiation also 
induced AKT activation; when cells were incubated with phosphatidylinositol-3-OH 
kinase/AKT inhibitor or infected with dominant-negative AKT, cyclin D1 
up-regulation, cell cycle progression, and proliferation were inhibited, 
suggesting that AKT activation is required for UVA-induced cell cycle 
progression. In contrast, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was not 
activated by UVA exposure; incubation with ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase 
inhibitor had no effect on UVA-induced cyclin D1 up-regulation and cell cycle 
progression. Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was observed 
after UVA exposure. EGFR kinase inhibitor AG attenuated the UVA-induced 
AKT/cyclin D1 pathway and cell cycle progression, indicating that EGFR is 
upstream of AKT/cyclin D1 pathway activation. Furthermore, metalloprotease 
inhibitor GM6001 blocked UVA-induced cell cycle progression, and siRNA knockdown 
of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)17 had a similar inhibitory effect, 
demonstrating that ADAM17 mediates the EGFR/AKT/cyclin D1 pathway and cell cycle 
progression to the S phase induced by UVA radiation. Identification of these 
signaling pathways in UVA-induced cell proliferation will facilitate the 
development of efficient and safe chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies for 
skin cancer.

Abstract

Ultraviolet A (UVA, 315–400 nm), which constitutes about 95% of the ultraviolet irradiation in natural sunlight, represents a major environmental challenge to the skin and is clearly associated with human skin cancer. Here we demonstrate that a low, non-lethal dose of UVA induces dose-dependent cell cycle progression in human HaCaT keratinocytes. We found that UVA induced cyclin D1 accumulation, while siRNA knockdown of cyclin D1 blocked the UVA-induced cell cycle progression, indicating that this process is mediated by cyclin D1. UVA irradiation also induced AKT activation; when cells were incubated with PI3K/AKT inhibitor or infected with dominant negative AKT, cyclin D1 up-regulation, cell cycle progression and proliferation were inhibited, suggesting that AKT activation is required for UVA-induced cell cycle progression. In contrast, ERK was not activated by UVA exposure; incubation with ERK/MAPK inhibitor had no effect on UVA-induced cyclin D1 up-regulation and cell cycle progression. Activation of EGFR was observed after UVA exposure. EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 attenuated the UVA-induced AKT/cyclin D1 pathway and cell cycle progression, indicating that EGFR is upstream of AKT/cyclin D1 pathway activation. Furthermore, metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 blocked UVA-induced cell cycle progression, and siRNA knockdown of ADAM17 had a similar inhibitory effect, demonstrating that ADAM17 mediates the EGFR/AKT/cyclin D1 pathway and cell cycle progression to the S phase induced by UVA radiation. Identification of these signaling pathways in UVA-induced cell proliferation will facilitate the development of efficient and safe chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies for skin cancer.

Introduction

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight is clearly an important environmental factor in human skin carcinogenesis. Each year approximately one million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the United States alone, making it the most common type of cancer in this country. In animal models, UV radiation is a complete carcinogen that can both initiate and promote skin carcinogenesis, resulting in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and melanoma ( 1 – 3 ).

UV radiation in sunlight is composed of UVB (280–315 nm) and UVA (315–400 nm). UVA has been considered far less carcinogenic based on limited direct damage to DNA ( 4 ). However, UVA is approximately 20-fold more abundant than UVB in sunlight and much more UVA penetrates the epidermis and reaches the basal germinative layers ( 5 ). Recently, UVA was shown to induce p53 mutations in the basal layer of the skin, and UVA signature mutations in p53 have been detected in SCC and solar keratosis ( 6 ). Although the mechanisms may differ from those involved in carcinogenesis by UVB ( 7 ), these findings confirmed that UVA can initiate tumorigenesis in vivo . Therefore, it is possible that UVA exposure may play a greater role in the development of human skin cancers than is generally assumed. The initiation stage is a rapid process, potentially taking place within a single exposure, whereas promotion may take years to occur and is a reversible process. Therefore chemoprevention targeting signaling pathways in the promotion stage may provide higher success and feasibility ( 8 , 9 ). Understanding the mechanisms in UVA-induced tumor promotion will ultimately provide molecular targets for the development of chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies.

Cell proliferation as a consequence of cell cycle progression is the key process that leads to clonal expansion of initiated cells during tumor promotion. Understanding the underlying mechanism will provide fundamental information about human carcinogenesis. Accelerated cell proliferation not only mediates tumor promotion but also contributes to genomic instability and mutation required for tumor progression.

Cyclin D1 is a cell cycle regulatory protein that acts as a growth factor sensor to integrate extracellular signals with the cell cycle machinery, particularly during the G1 phase of the cell cycle ( 10 ). Increased cyclin D1 has been associated with mouse skin transformation ( 11 – 14 ). However, the mechanisms of cell cycle progression in UVA-induced tumor promotion and the role of cyclin D1 remain open questions. Understanding the signal transduction pathways by which the UVA signals to cyclin D1 and identifying the critical elements in these pathways will provide targets for chemoprevention.

The EGF receptor (EGFR), one of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), plays a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. Binding of growth factors to RTKs promotes receptor dimerization and subsequent activation, which enhances autophosphorylation of RTKs, phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins, and recruitment of adaptor molecules, thus initiating signaling cascades, including the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways ( 15 , 16 ). Activation of the PI 3-kinase/AKT and/or ERK pathways can lead to cell proliferation and growth by regulating the cyclin D1 level ( 17 , 18 ).

In order to identify the mechanisms in UVA irradiation-induced cell proliferation, we have studied the mechanisms in cell cycle progression induced by low, non-lethal doses of UVA in HaCaT cells, a human keratinocyte line. In this study, cell cycle progression and cell proliferation were observed after UVA exposure. Cyclin D1 was found to mediate this process, and siRNA knockdown of cyclin D1 was shown to inhibit cell cycle progression. The ADAM/EGFR/AKT pathways transduced UVA signaling to cyclin D1 and induced a proliferative response in human keratinocytes. These data clearly demonstrate the mechanisms and the tumor promotional potential of UVA in human skin cells.

Discussion

In the present work, cell cycle progression in response to low dose UVA irradiation was investigated using the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. HaCaT cells are spontaneously immortalized through p53 mutation, a modification similar to that initiated in cells during skin carcinogenesis, thereby providing a valuable model system for the investigation of tumor promotion events associated with skin carcinogenesis ( 27 ). Using this model, we have shown that a non-lethal dose of UVA irradiation induces cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and that this process is mediated via cyclin D1. In this process the ADAM/EGFR/AKT pathway transduced the UVA signal to cause cyclin D1 up-regulation and cell proliferation, which might be equivalent to inducing tumor promotion in skin carcinogenesis.

AKT activation has been shown to be one of the key molecular determinants of keratinocyte transformation ( 28 ). AKT has been shown to increase the up-regulation of cyclin D1 in AKT-transformed keratinocytes via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes ( 17 ). In our study, we show that AKT activation is mediated by the EGFR pathway after UVA exposure. The accumulation of cyclin D1 by UVA exposure could be due to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation by AKT activation. Knockdown of cyclin D1 expression reduced the G1 to the S transitions induced by UVA exposure, demonstrating that cyclin D1 plays an important role in this process. Regardless of the precise regulation mechanisms, it appears that for cyclin-D1-mediated cell cycle progression induced by UVA exposure, AKT activation is required. In addition to cyclin D1, other factors might be involved in UVA-induced cell cycle progression, because knockdown of cyclin D1 did not block cell cycle progression completely. Multiple mechanisms including the blockade of Chk1 by phosphorylation at Ser280 by EGFR/AKT activation ( 29 ) may play important roles in UVA-induced cell proliferation. It is possible that AKT activation as a central signaling pathway mediates the proliferative effect of UVA through several downstream targets. We are currently in the process of identifying those targets to understand the complex mechanisms of UVA-induced cell proliferation and skin carcinogenesis.

The ERK/MAPK pathway is neither activated by low-dose UVA exposure nor involved in UVA-induced cell cycle progression although EGFR activation was observed in this study. We previously detected sustained and prolonged ERK/MAPK activation after apoptosis-inducing UVA but not low-dose UVA exposure ( 21 ). It appears that ERK signaling is clearly UVA dose dependent, which is expected because the low dose of UVA used in this study did not induce cell death. High-dose UVA-induced ERK activation protected cells from cell death and allowed more cells to survive ( 21 ).

The involvement of EGFR activation was first seen in the activation of EGFR after UVA irradiation and further confirmed by the inhibitory effect of the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG on cell cycle progression. We have previously shown that a lethally high dose (24 J/cm 2 ) did not induce EGFR phosphorylation ( 20 ). EGFR activation clearly seems to be UVA dose-dependent and occurs only at a low UVA dose. The level of EGFR activation in this study did not cause EGFR down-regulation, as seen by the failure of the EGFR level to decrease after UVA exposure (data not shown). This moderate EGFR activation is sufficient to activate the downstream AKT/cyclin D1 signaling, and transduce a proliferative signal to induce cell cycle progression.

ADAM proteins are membrane-anchored metalloproteases that process and shed the ectodomains of membrane-anchored growth factors, cytokines, and receptors ( 23 ). Tumor cells frequently produce autocrine growth factors, and are often highly proliferative, motile and invasive ( 30 ). ADAMs can activate EGFR by shedding the EGFR ligand ( 31 ). During EGFR transactivation, an upstream signal acts through a G-protein-coupled receptor to activate a metalloprotease to shed an EGF receptor ligand ( 24 ). ADAM17-mediated transactivation of EGFR by amphiregulin (AR) appears to be important for tumor cell growth and migration ( 25 )

Recently it has been reported that environmental stress signaling, including oxidative and osmotic stress, is mediated by ADAM proteases and HB-EGF (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor) ( 32 ). UVC exposure stimulated MAGF cleavage via the metalloprotease pathway ( 33 ). In this work, we observed that UVA induces cell cycle progression and that ADAM protease is involved because the metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 inhibits cell cycle progression after UVA exposure. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of ADAM17 attenuated EGFR activation and the cell cycle progression induced by UVA, indicating that ADAM17 was involved in the signal transduction for UVA irradiation to the EGFR/AKT/cyclin D1 pathway and cell cycle progression. The incomplete inhibition of EGFR activation and G1-S transition by siRNA against ADAM17 compared to the metalloprotease inhibitor GM suggests that other mechanisms may contribute to UVA-induced EGFR activation. A recent study has shown that the oxidative inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase kappa by UV results in the activation of EGFR ( 34 ). In addition, other ADAM members and/or metalloproteases including ADAM 10 may also be involved in UVA-induced EGFR activation and G1-S transition. The precise mechanisms of EGFR/AKT activation by ADAM17 and the potential role of other metalloproteases are under further investigation in our lab.

In summary, a non-lethal dose of UVA has been shown to induce cell cycle (the G1 to the S) progression of human HaCaT keratinocytes, mediated by increased cyclin D1. The ADAM/EGFR/AKT pathway is required for UVA-induced cyclin D1 up-regulation and cell cycle progression. Given the complexity and interactions of this signaling pathway, it is entirely possible that other pathways may also play a role in UVA-induced cell proliferation. This study provides compelling evidence that UVA alone, at low, non-lethal doses, has the potential to be a human skin tumor promoter. The acquisition of proliferation signaling in UVA-irradiated keratinocytes may be an important factor in the formation of premalignant skin lesions including actinic keratoses and malignant squamous cell carcinoma in the clinical setting. Identification of the fundamental mechanisms of the effect of UVA on tumor promotion will facilitate the development of safe and efficient chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies for skin cancer.
