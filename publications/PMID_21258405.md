MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is typically expressed at the apical 
membrane of normal epithelial cells. In cancer cells, the over-expression of 
MUC1 and its aberrant localization around the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm 
favours its interaction with different protein partners such as epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) and can promote tumour proliferation through the 
activation of oncogenic signalling pathways. Our aims were to study the 
mechanisms inducing MUC1 cytoplasmic localization in pancreatic cancer cells, 
and to decipher their impact on EGFR cellular localization and activation. Our 
results showed that galectin-3, an endogenous lectin, is co-expressed with MUC1 
in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and that it favours the endocytosis 
of MUC1 and EGFR. Depletion of galectin-3 by RNA interference increased the 
interaction between MUC1 and EGFR, EGFR and ERK-1,2 phosphorylation, and 
translocation of EGFR to the nucleus. On the contrary, silencing of galectin-3 
led to a decrease of cyclin-D1 levels and of cell proliferation. The 
galectin-3-dependent regulation of MUC1/EGFR functions may represent an 
interesting mechanism modulating the EGFR-stimulated cell growth of pancreatic 
cancer cells.
