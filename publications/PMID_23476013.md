Ras proteins and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A, PKA) are 
important components of a nutrient signaling pathway that mediates cellular 
responses to glucose in yeast. The molecular mechanisms that regulate 
Ras/PKA-mediated signaling remain to be fully understood. Here, we provide 
evidence that Ras/PKA signaling is negatively regulated by a deubiquitinating 
enzyme, Ubp3. Disrupting the activity of Ubp3 leads to hyperactivation of PKA, 
as evidenced by much enhanced phosphorylation of PKA substrates, decreased 
accumulation of glycogen, larger cell size, and increased sensitivity to heat 
shock. Levels of intracellular cAMP and the active forms of Ras proteins are 
also elevated in the ubp3Δ mutant. Consistent with a possibility that the 
increased cAMP is responsible for the abnormal signaling behavior of the ubp3Δ 
mutant, overexpressing PDE2, which encodes a phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes 
cAMP, significantly relieves the cell size increase and heat shock sensitivity 
of the mutant. Further analysis reveals that Ubp3 interacts with a Ras 
GTPase-accelerating protein, Ira2, and regulates its level of ubiquitination. 
Together, our data indicate that Ubp3 is a new regulator of the Ras/PKA 
signaling pathway and suggest that Ubp3 regulates this pathway by controlling 
the ubiquitination of Ras GTPase-accelerating protein Ira2.
