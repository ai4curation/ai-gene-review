Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling is deliberately regulated at 
multiple steps in its pathway from the extracellular microenvironment to the 
nucleus. However, how TGF-β signaling is activated or attenuated is not fully 
understood. We recently identified transmembrane prostate androgen-induced RNA 
(TMEPAI), which is involved in a negative feedback loop of TGF-β signaling. When 
we searched for a family molecule(s) for TMEPAI, we found C18ORF1, which, like 
TMEPAI, possesses two PY motifs and one Smad-interacting motif (SIM) domain. As 
expected, C18ORF1 could block TGF-β signaling but not bone morphogenetic protein 
signaling. C18ORF1 bound to Smad2/3 via its SIM and competed with the Smad 
anchor for receptor activation for Smad2/3 binding to attenuate recruitment of 
Smad2/3 to the TGF-β type I receptor (also termed activin receptor-like kinase 5 
(ALK5)), in a similar fashion to TMEPAI. Knockdown of C18ORF1 prolonged duration 
of TGF-β-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and concomitantly potentiated the 
expression of JunB, p21, and TMEPAI mRNAs induced by TGF-β. Consistently, 
TGF-β-induced cell migration was enhanced by the knockdown of C18ORF1. These 
results indicate that the inhibitory function of C18ORF1 on TGF-β signaling is 
similar to that of TMEPAI. However, in contrast to TMEPAI, C18ORF1 was not 
induced upon TGF-β signaling. Thus, we defined C18ORF1 as a surveillant of 
steady state TGF-β signaling, whereas TMEPAI might help C18ORF1 to inhibit TGF-β 
signaling in a coordinated manner when cells are stimulated with high levels of 
TGF-β.
