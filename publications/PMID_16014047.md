BACKGROUND: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B regulates mesangial cell and 
vessel development during embryogenesis, and contributes to the pathogenesis of 
adult renal and vascular diseases. Endothelial cell PDGF-B exerts paracrine 
effects on mesangial cells, but its regulation is not well defined. We examined 
the impact of hypoxia on PDGF-B-mediated interactions between glomerular 
endothelial and mesangial cells, a condition of potential relevance in 
developing, and diseased adult, kidneys.
METHODS: Glomerular endothelial or mesangial cells were subjected to hypoxia and 
responses compared to normoxic cells. Endothelial PDGF-B was studied by Northern 
and Western analysis. Mesangial proliferative responses to PDGF-B were assessed 
by (3)H-thymidine incorporation, and migration by a modified Boyden chamber 
assay. Hypoxia-induced changes in receptor specific binding capacity were 
studied by saturation binding assays.
RESULTS: Hypoxia stimulated increases in endothelial PDGF-B mRNA and protein. In 
normoxic mesangial cells, PDGF-B stimulated dose-dependent proliferation, but 
the proliferative response of hypoxic cells was two to three times greater. 
Exogenous PDGF-B also caused prompter migration in hypoxic mesangial cells. 
Mesangial cells were treated with endothelial cell-conditioned medium. More 
cells migrated when hypoxic cells were stimulated with hypoxic conditioned 
medium, than when normoxic cells were stimulated with normoxic conditioned 
medium. Preincubating conditioned medium with PDGF-B neutralizing antibody 
greatly decreased the chemoattractant activity. Binding studies demonstrated 
increased specific binding capacity in hypoxic cells.
CONCLUSION: Hypoxia enhances PDGF-B paracrine interactions between glomerular 
endothelial and mesangial cells. These hypoxia-regulated interactions may be 
important during glomerulogenesis in fetal life and during the pathogenesis of 
adult glomerular disease.
