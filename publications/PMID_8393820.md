Alteration of transcription factor function is becoming a common theme in 
molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis. A recent example of this trend is the 
isolation and characterization of the chromosome 11p13 Wilms tumor suppressor 
gene, WT1. The WT1 protein contains a DNA binding domain consisting of four zinc 
fingers of the Cys2-His2 class and a proline-glutamine rich region capable of 
regulating transcription. Deletions of the WT1 gene or point mutations which 
destroy the DNA binding activity of the protein are associated with the 
development of the pediatric nephroblastoma Wilms tumor and Denys-Drash 
syndrome. This article reviews the role of WT1 in normal kidney development 
processes, the known biochemical functions of the protein and the status of 
identifying target genes regulated by this potentially oncogenic transcription 
factor.
