Influenza A virus matrix protein (M1) is the most abundant conservative protein 
that regulates the replication, assembly and budding of the viral particles upon 
infection. Several host cell factors have been determined to interact with M1 
possibly in regulating influenza virus replication. By yeast two-hybrid 
screening, the isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) was identified to interact with 
the M1 protein. CypA specifically interacted with M1 both in vitro and in vivo. 
The mutagenesis results showed CypA bound to the functional middle (M) domain of 
M1. The depletion of endogenous CypA by RNA interference resulted in the 
increase of influenza virus infectivity while overexpression of CypA caused 
decreasing the infectivity in affected cells. The immunofluorescence assays 
indicated that overexpressed CypA deduced the infectivity and inhibited the 
translocation of M1 protein into the nucleus while did not affect nucleoprotein 
entering the nucleus. Further studies indicated that overexpression of CypA 
significantly increased M1 self-association. Western blot with purified virions 
confirmed that CypA was encapsidated within the virus particle. These results 
together indicated that CypA interacted with the M1 protein and affected the 
early stage of the viral replication.
