Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) is a central mediator of the cell 
signaling between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and various intracellular 
serine/threonine kinases including Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), p70 S6 kinases, 
and protein kinase C. Recent studies with cell transfection experiments have 
implied that PDK-1 may be involved in various cell functions including cell 
growth and apoptosis. However, despite its pivotal role in cellular signalings, 
the in vivo functions of PDK-1 in a multicellular system have rarely been 
investigated. Here, we have isolated Drosophila PDK-1 (dPDK-1) mutants and 
characterized the in vivo roles of the kinase. Drosophila deficient in the 
dPDK-1 gene exhibited lethality and an apoptotic phenotype in the embryonic 
stage. Conversely, overexpression of dPDK-1 increased cell and organ size in a 
Drosophila PI3K-dependent manner. dPDK-1 not only could activate Drosophila 
Akt/PKB (Dakt1), but also substitute the in vivo functions of its mammalian 
ortholog to activate Akt/PKB. This functional interaction between dPDK-1 and 
Dakt1 was further confirmed through genetic analyses in Drosophila. On the other 
hand, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which has been proposed as a possible 
target of dPDK-1, did not interact with dPDK-1. In conclusion, our findings 
provide direct evidence that dPDK-1 regulates cell growth and apoptosis during 
Drosophila development via the PI3K-dependent signaling pathway and demonstrate 
our Drosophila system to be a powerful tool for elucidating the in vivo 
functions and targets of PDK-1.
