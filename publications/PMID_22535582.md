Photomorphogenesis is controlled by multiple signaling pathways, including the 
light and brassinosteroid (BR) pathways. BR signaling activates the BZR1 
transcription factor, which is required for suppressing photomorphogenesis in 
the dark. We identified a suppressor of the BR hypersensitive mutant bzr1-1D and 
named it bzr1-1D suppressor1-Dominant (bzs1-D). The bzs1-D mutation was caused 
by overexpression of a B-box zinc finger protein BZS1, which is 
transcriptionally repressed by BZR1. Overexpression of BZS1 causes de-etiolation 
in the dark, short hypocotyls in the light, reduced sensitivity to BR treatment, 
and repression of many BR-activated genes. Knockdown of BZS1 by co-suppression 
partly suppressed the short hypocotyl phenotypes of BR-deficient or insensitive 
mutants. These results support that BZS1 is a negative regulator of BR response. 
BZS1 overexpressors are hypersensitive to different wavelengths of light and 
loss of function of BZS1 reduces plant sensitivity to light and partly 
suppresses the constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 (cop1) mutant in the dark, 
suggesting a positive role in light response. BZS1 protein accumulates at an 
increased level after light treatment of dark-grown BZS1-OX plants and in the 
cop1 mutants, and BZS1 interacts with COP1 in vitro, suggesting that light 
regulates BZS1 through COP1-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. 
These results demonstrate that BZS1 mediates the crosstalk between BR and light 
pathways.

Abstract

Photomorphogenesis is controlled by multiple signaling pathways, including the
light and brassinosteroid (BR) pathways. BR signaling activates the BZR1
transcription factor, which is required for suppressing photomorphogenesis in
the dark. We identified a suppressor of the BR hypersensitive mutant bzr1–1D and named it bz r1–1D s uppressor1- D ominant ( bzs1–D ). The bzs1–D mutation
was caused by overexpression of a B-box zinc finger protein BZS1, which is
transcriptionally repressed by BZR1. Overexpression of BZS1 causes de-etiolation in the dark, short hypocotyls in the light, reduced
sensitivity to BR treatment, and repression of many BR-activated genes.
Knockdown of BZS1 by co-suppression partly suppressed the short
hypocotyl phenotypes of BR-deficient or insensitive mutants. These results
support that BZS1 is a negative regulator of BR response. BZS1 overexpressors
are hypersensitive to different wavelengths of light and loss of function of
BZS1 reduces plant sensitivity to light and partly suppresses the constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 ( cop1 )
mutant in the dark, suggesting a positive role in light response. BZS1 protein
accumulates at an increased level after light treatment of dark-grown BZS1–OX plants and in the cop1 mutants, and BZS1 interacts with COP1 in vitro , suggesting that
light regulates BZS1 through COP1-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation. These results demonstrate that BZS1 mediates the crosstalk between
BR and light pathways.

INTRODUCTION

Wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the dark have long
hypocotyls and closed cotyledons with undifferentiated chloroplast, a phenomenon
termed etiolation or skotomorphogenesis. When exposed to light, seedlings undergo
de-etiolation (also called photomorphogenesis) and thus display short hypocotyls,
open cotyledons, and chloroplast differentiation ( Wei and Deng, 1996 ). This light-induced developmental switch is
controlled by the photoreceptor-mediated signaling transduction pathways, which act
in part by inactivating the COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and stabilizing positive
transcription factors. In addition to light signaling, brassinosteroid (BR) is
another key signal that controls the switch between skotomorphogenesis and
photomorphogenesis, as BR-deficient and insensitive mutants show de-etiolation
phenotypes in the dark ( Chory et al., 1991 ; Li et al., 1996 ; Szekeres et al., 1996 ; Song
et al., 2009 ). Light and BR act antagonistically in photomorphogenesis.
However, the molecular mechanisms of this antagonism are not fully understood.

BR signals are perceived by BRI1 receptor kinase and transduced through a
well-defined signal transduction pathway to activate members of the BZR family
transcription factors ( Kim et al., 2009 ; Kim and Wang, 2010 ; Clouse, 2011 ). BZR1 and BZR2/BES1
transcription factors play central roles in BR regulation of plant growth and gene
expression ( Wang et al., 2002 ; Yin et al., 2002 ; He et al., 2005 ; Yin et
al., 2005 ). The dominant bzr1–1D mutation causes
constitutive BZR1 activation due to enhanced dephosphorylation by PP2A ( Tang et al., 2011 ), and bzr1–1D fully suppresses the photomorphogenesis phenotype
of bri1-116 and reverses the expression changes of about 80% of the
genes affected in bri1-116 ( Sun
et al., 2010 ). A large number of light-induced genes are activated in the
BR-deficient or insensitive mutants in the dark ( Chory et al., 1991 ; Li et al.,
1996 ; Szekeres et al., 1996 ; Song et al., 2009 ), suggesting that
light and BR may regulate common transcription factors. Indeed, a recent study
showed that a member of the GATA family transcription factors (GATA2) is
transcriptionally repressed by BZR1 but posttranslationally activated by light
signaling ( Luo et al., 2010 ). GATA2
controls a subset of genes co-regulated by light and BR to promote
photomorphogenesis. Many other transcription factors mediate light-regulated gene
expression ( Lau and Deng, 2010 ), but
whether any of them are also regulated by BR remains unknown.

B-box proteins are a group of transcription factors containing one or more B-box
domains that are stabilized by binding to zinc ions ( Klug and Schwabe, 1995 ). There are 32 B-box containing
proteins with diverse functions in Arabidopsis (Khanna et al.,
2009). For example, CONSTANS (CO) is an important regulator of photoperiodic
flowering ( Putterill et al., 1995 ; Onouchi et al., 2000 ). The CO-like genes COL1 and COL2 are involved in regulating the
circadian clock ( Ledger et al., 2001 ). STH2 , STH3 , and COL3 are
positive regulators of light responses ( Datta et
al., 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ), whereas STO and STH1 are negative regulators of photomorphogenesis ( Khanna et al., 2006 ; Indorf et al., 2007 ).

In this study, we identified an activation-tagged bz r1–1D s uppressor ( bzs1–D ), which showed
dwarfism and suppressed bzr1–1D ’s phenotypes of stem
kink and insensitivity to BR biosynthesis inhibitor BRZ. The phenotypes of bzs1–D are caused by overexpression of a B-box protein we
named BZS1 (also named BBX20), which is repressed at the transcription level by BR.
Overexpression and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that BZS1 plays a
negative role in BR responses but positively regulates light responses. BZS1 protein
level is increased upon light treatment of dark-grown seedlings and in the cop1 mutant. BZS1 interacts with COP1 in
vitro , suggesting that light may regulate BZS1 accumulation through COP1.
These data demonstrate that BZS1 acts downstream of both BR and light pathways. This
study supports a mechanism of BR-light crosstalk through transcriptional repression
and posttranslational activation of photomorphogenesis-promoting transcription
factors.

DISCUSSION

Interactions between light and brassinosteroid signals are important for
photomorphogenic development in higher plants. The underlying molecular network is
not fully understood. In this study, we show that the B-box protein BZS1/BBX20 is
another component of the network integrating BR and light signaling on gene
expression and photomorphogenic development. BR represses the transcriptional level
of BZS1/BBX20 through BZR1, whereas light promotes BZS1/BBX20 protein accumulation
through inhibiting COP1’s activity. Our results provide further evidence for a
general mode of BR-light crosstalk whereby photomorphogenesis-promoting
transcription factors are activated by light-induced stabilization, through
inhibition of the COP1-mediated ubiquitination/degradation, but are inhibited by BR
signaling through BZR1-mediated transcriptional repression ( Luo et al., 2010 ).

Genetic interactions with BR mutants support a negative role of BZS1/BBX20 in BR
response. Overexpression of BZS1 suppressed the BR-activation
phenotypes of bzr1–1D , but enhanced the dwarf phenotypes of
BR-deficient det2-1 and BR-insensitive bin2-1 . In
contrast, knockdown of BZS1 expression partly suppressed the
phenotypes of det2-1 and bin2-1 . These results
strongly support that BZS1/BBX20 plays a role in repressing BR-regulated response.
BZS1/BBX20 has been shown in Chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments to be a BZR1
target gene, and its expression is repressed by BR, suggesting that BR represses BZS1 expression through BZR1 ( Sun et al., 2010 ). Consistently with BZS1/BBX20 function downstream of
BZR1, bzs1–D had no effect on BZR1 accumulation and
phosphorylation (Supplemental Figure 6 ). BZS1–OX suppressed multiple phenotypes of bzr1–1D , including BRZ-insensitivity and stem kink,
suggesting that BZS1/BBX20 is a major component that mediates multiple
BZR1-regulated developmental processes.

The phenotypes of BZS1–OX and BZS1–CS plants grown under different light conditions indicate a role of BZS1 in
photomorphogenesis. The BZS1–OX plants showed constitutive
photomorphogenesis phenotypes in the dark, and hypersensitivity to blue, red, and
white light. In contrast, BZS1–CS plants showed increased
hypocotyl elongation under all light conditions. Furthermore, BZS1–CS partly suppresses the photomorphogenic cop1 mutant. These results support that BZS1 is a positive
regulator of light response. The weak phenotype of the BZS1–CS plants is likely due to partial suppression of BZS1 and redundant function with homologous genes. The close
homologs of BZS1/BBX20, namely STH2/BBX21, STH3/BBX22, and STO/BBX24, have been
shown to positively regulate photomorphogenesis ( Datta et al., 2007 ; Indorf et al.,
2007 ). BZS1/BBX20 shares 71.82%, 54.13%, and 56.48% of amino-acid
identity in the B-box domain to STH2/BBX21, STH3/BBX22, and STO/BBX24, respectively
(Supplemental Figure 7 ). While sth2-1 and BZS1–CS plants each show weak
long-hypocotyl phenotypes, the BZS1–CS/sth2-1 plants showed
stronger phenotypes than each parental line, consistently with their redundant
functions in promoting photomorphogenesis.

To mediate light-regulated development, BZS1/BBX20 protein level is increased by
light signaling. Light regulation of BZS1/BBX20 protein is likely mediated by the
COP1 ubiquitin ligase, as BZS1/BBX20 accumulates in the cop1 mutants and interacts with COP1 in vitro . Similarly, other members
of the BBX family, including CO, COL3, STO, STH1, STH2, and STH3, have been shown to
interact with COP1 ( Holm et al., 2001 ; Datta et al., 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). The
triple mutant sth2-1 sth3 cop1 showed a stronger cop1-suppression
phenotype compared to the sth3cop1 double mutant, suggesting that
STH2 might also be the target of COP1 degradation ( Datta et al., 2008 ). As such, interaction with COP1 seems a conserved
feature of the B-box proteins consistently with their roles in light-regulated
development.

Our microarray data of BZS1–OX plants provide further evidence
for a positive role in regulating light-responsive gene expression. Although only a
small set of genes are affected by BZS1 overexpression, the
majority of these genes are light-responsive and the expression changes caused by BZS1–OX are similar to the effects of light. How BZS1
regulates gene expression remains unknown, but its homolog STH2/BBX21 has been shown
to interact with HY5 ( Datta et al., 2007 ; Holtan et al., 2011 ), a COP1-targeted
b-ZIP transcription factor that positively regulates photomorphogenesis. It is
likely that BZS1/BBX20 also interacts with HY5 or other light signaling
transcription factors to control a subset of light-responsive genes.

Together, our results demonstrate that BZS1/BBX20 mediates the antagonistic
interactions between light and BR signaling pathways. BZS1/BBX20 is oppositely
regulated by BR and light through transcriptional and posttranscriptional
mechanisms, respectively ( Supplemental Figure 8 ). This is analogous to the GATA2 factor, which
is also transcriptionally repressed by BZR1 and posttranslationally stabilized by
light through a COP1-dependent mechanism ( Luo et
al., 2010 ). Therefore, it seems a general strategy of crosstalk that BR
represses the expression and light increases accumulation of positive transcription
factors that promote photomorphogenic gene expression and development. In addition,
light inhibits BR response by increasing the expression of the Membrane Steroid
Binding Protein 1 (MSBP1) ( Shi et al.,
2011 ). Furthermore, the BR signaling transcription factor BZR1 and the
phytochrome-interacting factor (PIL5) co-regulate many common target genes ( Sun et al., 2010 ). A recent study also showed
that the HLH factor PAR1, which was previously identified as a negative regulator of
shade-avoidance response ( Bou-Torrent et al.,
2008 ), binds to PIF4 to inhibit PIF4 DNA binding ( Hao et al., 2012 ). The BR-activated HLH factor PRE1 interacts
with and inhibits PAR1, freeing PIF4 to promote the response to shade and darkness
( Hao et al., 2012 ). Therefore, the
interactions between BR and light pathways appear to be mediated by a complex
network of molecular interactions.
