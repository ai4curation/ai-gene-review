Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, two important human pathogens, 
target host fibronectin (Fn) in their adhesion to and invasion of host cells. 
Fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs), anchored in the bacterial cell wall, have 
multiple Fn-binding repeats in an unfolded region of the protein. The 
bacterium-binding site in the amino-terminal domain (1-5F1) of Fn contains five 
sequential Fn type 1 (F1) modules. Here we show the structure of a streptococcal 
(S. dysgalactiae) FnBP peptide (B3) in complex with the module pair 1F12F1. This 
identifies 1F1- and 2F1-binding motifs in B3 that form additional antiparallel 
beta-strands on sequential F1 modules-the first example of a tandem beta-zipper. 
Sequence analyses of larger regions of FnBPs from S. pyogenes and S. aureus 
reveal a repeating pattern of F1-binding motifs that match the pattern of F1 
modules in 1-5F1 of Fn. In the process of Fn-mediated invasion of host cells, 
therefore, the bacterial proteins seem to exploit the modular structure of Fn by 
forming extended tandem beta-zippers. This work is a vital step forward in 
explaining the full mechanism of the integrin-dependent FnBP-mediated invasion 
of host cells.
