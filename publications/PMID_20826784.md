The multiple functions of the oncofetal protein survivin are dependent on its 
selective expression patterns within immunochemically distinct subcellular 
pools. The mechanism by which survivin localizes to these compartments, however, 
is only partly understood. Here we show that nuclear accumulation of survivin is 
promoted by CREB-binding protein (CBP)-dependent acetylation on lysine 129 
(129K, Lys-129). We demonstrate a mechanism by which survivin acetylation at 
this position results in its homodimerization, while deacetylation promotes the 
formation of survivin monomers that heterodimerize with CRM1 and facilitate its 
nuclear export. Using proteomic analysis, we identified the oncogenic 
transcription factor STAT3 as a binding partner of nuclear survivin. We show 
that acetylated survivin binds to the N-terminal transcriptional activation 
domain of the STAT3 dimer and represses STAT3 transactivation of target gene 
promoters. Using multiplex PCR and DNA sequencing, we identified a 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (A → G) at Lys-129 that exists as a homozygous 
mutation in a neuroblastoma cell line and corresponds with a defect in survivin 
nuclear localization. Our results demonstrate that the dynamic equilibrium 
between survivin acetylation and deacetylation at amino acid 129 determines its 
interaction with CRM1, its subsequent subcellular localization, and its ability 
to inhibit STAT3 transactivation, providing a potential route for therapeutic 
intervention in STAT3-dependent tumors.
