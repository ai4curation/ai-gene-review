Epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) and short consensus repeat (SCR) domains are 
commonly found in cell surface and soluble proteins that mediate specific 
protein-protein recognition events. Unlike the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, 
very little is known about the general properties of intermolecular interactions 
encoded by these common modules, and in particular, how specificity of binding 
is achieved. We have dissected the binding of CD97 (a member of the EGF-TM7 
family) to the complement regulator CD55, two cell surface modular proteins that 
contain EGF and SCR domains, respectively. We demonstrate that the interaction 
is mediated solely by these domains and is characterized by a low affinity (86 
microm) and rapid off-rate (at least 0.6 s(-1)). The interaction is Ca(2+) 
-dependent but is unaffected by glycosylation of the EGF domains. Using 
biotinylated multimerized peptides in cell binding assays and surface plasmon 
resonance, we show that a CD97-related EGF-TM7 molecule (termed EMR2), differing 
by only three amino acids within the EGF domains, binds CD55 with a K(D) at 
least an order of magnitude weaker than that of CD97. These results suggest that 
low affinity cell-cell interactions may be a general feature of highly expressed 
cell surface proteins and that specificity of SCR-EGF binding can be finely 
tuned by a small number of amino acid changes on the EGF module surface.
