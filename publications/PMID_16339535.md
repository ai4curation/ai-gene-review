Mast cell-mediated responses are likely to be regulated by the cross talk 
between activatory and inhibitory signals. We have screened human cord blood 
mast cells for recently characterized inhibitory receptors expressed on NK 
cells. We found that IRp60, an Ig superfamily member, is expressed on human mast 
cells. On NK cells, IRp60 cross-linking leads to the inhibition of cytotoxic 
activity vs target cells in vitro. IRp60 is constitutively expressed on mast 
cells but is down-regulated in vitro by the eosinophil proteins major basic 
protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin. An immune complex-mediated 
cross-linking of IRp60 led to inhibition of IgE-induced degranulation and stem 
cell factor-mediated survival via a mechanism involving tyrosine 
phosphorylation, phosphatase recruitment, and termination of cellular calcium 
influx. To evaluate the role of IRp60 in regulation of allergic responses in 
vivo, a murine model of allergic peritonitis was used in which the murine 
homolog of IRp60, LMIR1, was neutralized in BALB/c mice by mAbs. This 
neutralization led to a significantly augmented release of inflammatory 
mediators and eosinophilic infiltration. These data demonstrate a novel pathway 
for the regulation of human mast cell function and allergic responses, 
indicating IRp60 as a candidate target for future treatment of allergic and mast 
cell-associated diseases.
