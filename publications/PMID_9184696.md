Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a cytokine from mouse Th2 cells and macrophage that 
inhibits IL-2 and IFN-gamma production by Th1 cells, has been reported to 
stimulate growth and differentiation of B cells activated by CD40 or antigen 
receptor crosslinking. Our early observation revealed that IL-10 had B cell 
growth factor (BCGF) activity in human B cells preactivated with SAC or anti-Ig. 
The responsiveness of the preactivated B cells to IL-10 greatly increased when B 
cells were activated in the presence of IL-2, whereas IL-10 has no BCGF activity 
when added at the initiation of activation by SAC. To investigate the dual 
effects (proliferation and apoptosis) of IL-10 on B cells, the expression of a 
panel of bcl-2 protoncogene family members, bcl-2, bcl-x, mcl-1, and bax, was 
analyzed when B cells were activated by SAC. Bcl-xL protein was not expressed in 
the small resting B cells but was induced by SAC stimulation, reaching its peak 
at 48 hr. The addition of IL-2 further augmented the Bcl-xL expression with the 
same kinetics, whereas Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were expressed by resting B cells and 
enhanced by SAC stimulation. However, the addition of IL-10 at the initiation of 
activation down-regulated Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 expression. At the same time, 
B cell proliferation was inhibited and apoptotic cell number increased, 
suggesting the growth arrest and/or apoptosis of B cells. The apoptosis of 
SAC-activated B cells by IL-10 was further confirmed by propidium 
iodide-staining and Annexin V-FITC-staining methods. In contrast, IL-10 failed 
to down-regulate the Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression but rather augmented the 
expression of Mcl-1 of B cells after preactivation for 48 hr with SAC and IL-2. 
Under this culture condition, B cells responded to IL-10 to proliferate and 
differentiate, while IL-2 and IL-10 had an additive or synergistic effect. Taken 
together, our data suggest that IL-10 acts on the induction stage of Bcl-xL 
expression and regulates the apoptosis and proliferation of SAC-activated B 
cells through their bcl-2 family gene expression.
