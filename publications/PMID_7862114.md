interacts with ADA2 and GCN5 in a trimeric complex.

Mutations in yeast ADA2, ADA3, and GCN5 weaken the activation potential of a 
subset of acidic activation domains. In this report, we show that their gene 
products form a heterotrimeric complex in vitro, with ADA2 as the linchpin 
holding ADA3 and GCN5 together. Further, activation by LexA-ADA3 fusions in vivo 
are regulated by the levels of ADA2. Combined with a prior observation that 
LexA-ADA2 fusions are regulated by the levels of ADA3 (N. Silverman, J. Agapite, 
and L. Guarente, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11665-11668, 1994), this finding 
suggests that these proteins also form a complex in cells. ADA3 can be separated 
into two nonoverlapping domains, an amino-terminal domain and a 
carboxyl-terminal domain, which do not separately complement the slow-growth 
phenotype or transcriptional defect of a delta ada3 strain but together supply 
full complementation. The carboxyl-terminal domain of ADA3 alone suffices for 
heterotrimeric complex formation in vitro and activation of LexA-ADA2 in vivo. 
We present a model depicting the ADA complex as a coactivator in which the ADA3 
amino-terminal domain mediates an interaction between activation domains and the 
ADA complex.
