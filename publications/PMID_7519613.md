Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NF-AT) is a crucial transcription factor 
required for T-cell expression of interleukin 2. Purified NF-AT contains 45-kDa 
and 90-kDa subunits (Corthésy, B., and Kao, P. N. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 
20682-20690). Partial internal amino acid sequences derived from each subunit 
indicate that these proteins are novel. The amino acid sequences were used to 
clone the cDNAs encoding each subunit. The cDNAs predict proteins of novel 
structures: NF45 has limited similarity to prokaryotic transcription factor 
sigma-54 and to human DNA topoisomerase II; NF90 has limited similarity to 
Drosophila Staufen in a domain predicted to bind double-stranded RNA. RNA 
encoding NF45 and NF90 exists in nonstimulated Jurkat T-cells and in all other 
cell types examined (HeLa, HepG2, K562). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used 
to demonstrate that both proteins are located in the nucleus of Jurkat T-cells. 
Clones NF45 and NF90 with a polyhistidine fusion tag were transiently expressed 
and processed in the native environment of Jurkat T-cells. Histidine-tagged NF45 
and NF90 proteins, affinity-purified on nickel chelate columns, encode a NF-AT 
DNA-binding activity that is enhanced following T-cell stimulation, and this 
enhancement is blocked when T-cells are stimulated in the presence of 
cyclosporin A or FK506.
