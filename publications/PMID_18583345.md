E1 and E2 enzymes coordinate the first steps in conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) 
and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls). ISG15 is an interferon-alpha/beta-induced 
Ubl, and the E1 and E2 enzymes for ISG15 conjugation are Ube1L and UbcH8, 
respectively. UbcH7 is the most closely related E2 to UbcH8, yet it does not 
function in ISG15 conjugation in vivo, while both UbcH7 and UbcH8 have been 
reported to function in Ub conjugation. Kinetic analyses of wild-type and 
chimeric E2s were performed to determine the basis for preferential activation 
of UbcH8 by Ube1L and to determine whether UbcH8 is activated equally well by 
Ube1L and E1(Ub) (Ube1). K(m) determinations confirmed the strong preference of 
Ube1L for UbcH8 over UbcH7 (a 29-fold K(m) difference), similar to the 
preference of E1(Ub) for UbcH7 over UbcH8 (a 36-fold K(m) difference). Thioester 
assays of chimeric E2s identified two structural elements within residues 1-39 
of UbcH8 that play a major role in defining Ube1L-UbcH8 specificity: the 
alpha1-helix and the beta1-beta2 region. The C-terminal ubiquitin fold domain 
(UFD) of Ube1L was required for transfer of ISG15 to UbcH8 and for binding of 
Ube1L to UbcH8. Replacement of the Ube1L UFD with that from E1(Ub) resulted in 
preferential transfer of ISG15 to UbcH7. Together, these results indicate that 
Ube1L discriminates between UbcH8 and closely related Ub E2s based on specific 
interactions between the Ube1L UFD and determinants within the N-terminal region 
of UbcH8.

Abstract

E1 and E2 enzymes coordinate the first steps in conjugation of ubiquitin
(Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls). ISG15 is an
interferon-α/β-induced Ubl, and the E1 and E2 enzymes for ISG15
conjugation are Ube1L and UbcH8, respectively. UbcH7 is the most closely
related E2 to UbcH8, yet it does not function in ISG15 conjugation in
vivo , while both UbcH7 and UbcH8 have been reported to function in Ub
conjugation. Kinetic analyses of wild-type and chimeric E2s were performed to
determine the basis for preferential activation of UbcH8 by Ube1L and to
determine whether UbcH8 is activated equally well by Ube1L and E1 Ub (Ube1). K m determinations confirmed the strong preference
of Ube1L for UbcH8 over UbcH7 (a 29-fold K m difference),
similar to the preference of E1 Ub for UbcH7 over UbcH8 (a 36-fold K m difference). Thioester assays of chimeric E2s
identified two structural elements within residues 1–39 of UbcH8 that
play a major role in defining Ube1L-UbcH8 specificity: the α1-helix and
the β1-β2 region. The C-terminal ubiquitin fold domain (UFD) of
Ube1L was required for transfer of ISG15 to UbcH8 and for binding of Ube1L to
UbcH8. Replacement of the Ube1L UFD with that from E1 Ub resulted in
preferential transfer of ISG15 to UbcH7. Together, these results indicate that
Ube1L discriminates between UbcH8 and closely related Ub E2s based on specific
interactions between the Ube1L UFD and determinants within the N-terminal
region of UbcH8.

RESULTS

E2 ∼ ISG15 Thioester Formation in Vitro —UbcH7 is
55% identical and 72% similar to UbcH8 and is the most closely related E2 to
UbcH8 among all human E2 enzymes. Fig.
1 A shows an alignment of the UbcH8 and UbcH7 protein
sequences, along with their common secondary structure elements as determined
from x-ray crystal structures (UbcH8: PDB 1WZW, UbcH7: PDB 1D5F
( 29 )). 4 Both proteins belong to the subgroup of E2s defined, in part, by a conserved
sequence motif within the N-terminal α-helix (α1): X Rφ XX (D/E) X (where X is any residue
and φ is a hydrophobic residue)
( 30 ). This motif constitutes
residues 4–10 of UbcH8 and represents the most common motif found in the
α1-helix among all ubiquitin E2s
( 30 ). With the exception of
UbcH8, none of the E2s in this subgroup have been reported to function with
Ubls other than Ub. UbcH7 and UbcH8 both contain a conserved phenylalanine
residue (Phe-63 in UbcH7, F62 in UbcH8) that is a key contact for interaction
of these proteins with HECT and RING E3s
( 29 , 31 ), and both proteins consist
solely of the ∼150 amino acid common core E2 structure with no N- or
C-terminal extensions. Comparing the sequences of the two proteins, the
longest contiguous stretch of non-conserved residues is the six-residue random
coil linker between the first α-helix and the first β-strand
(α1-β1 linker; residues 16–21 of UbcH8), where the UbcH8
sequence is KPPPYL and UbcH7 is CGMKNF. The α1-helix, the linker, and
the β1-β2 region are highlighted in the UbcH8 ribbon
structure shown in Fig.
1 B .

Both UbcH7 and UbcH8 have been reported previously to cooperate with human
E1 Ub (Ube1; for clarity referred to here as E1 Ub ) in
catalyzing protein ubiquitination in vitro ( 5 , 13 , 17 ) and in vivo ( 11 ), while only UbcH8
functions in ISG15 conjugation in vivo ( 5 ). To determine if these
results are consistent with biochemical characteristics of E1 Ub and
Ube1L, we performed a preliminary examination of E1-E2 interactions using in vitro thioester assays and incubation times of either 5 or 75 min.
As shown in Fig. 2 , at the
5-min time point, E1 Ub preferentially transferred Ub to UbcH7
compared with UbcH8. At the 75-min time point, the differences in UbcH7 and
UbcH8 Ub thioester formation were minimized. Similar results were seen with
ISG15 thioester assays, where UbcH8 activation was detected at the 5-min time
point, while UbcH7 activation was almost undetectable, but at the 75-min time
point the differences between UbcH8 and UbcH7 activation were minimized. These
results indicate that both UbcH7 and UbcH8 can be charged with both Ub and
ISG15 to varying degrees. They also demonstrate that in vitro experimental conditions may lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding E1 and E2
cooperativity, and suggested the need for more quantitative kinetic
analyses.

The K m values of E1 Ub and Ube1L for both
UbcH7 and UbcH8 ( Table 1 ) were
determined by quantifying E2∼Ub/ISG15 thioester formation under initial
rate conditions, using 32 P-labeled Ub and ISG15
( Table 1 ). The K m of Ube1L for UbcH8 was determined to be 66.4 ±
8.3 n m and for UbcH7 it was ∼29-fold higher (1890 ± 370
n m ). This difference was consistent with the fact that neither
endogenous UbcH7 nor any other Ub E2 can substitute for UbcH8 in ISG15
conjugation in interferon-treated cells
( 5 ). Similarly, the K m of E1 Ub for UbcH7 was determined to be 185
± 26 n m and for UbcH8 it was ∼36-fold higher (6650
± 140 n m ). The ratio of k cat / K m is an indicator of the
specificity of an enzyme for a substrate, and this value for E1 Ub was ∼1,300-fold greater with UbcH7 than with UbcH8 (65,500 versus 50.7 s -1 m -1 ; Table 1 ). For Ube1L, k cat / K m was ∼114-fold greater with
UbcH8 than with UbcH7 (42,600 versus 372 s -1 m -1 ). Together, these kinetic parameters are consistent
with previous demonstrations
( 5 ) that no other endogenous E2
proteins can substitute for UbcH8 in the ISG15 system in vivo .

Residues 1–39 Are Critical for UbcH8 Interaction with Ube1L in
Vitro —To identify the determinants of UbcH8 that confer specificity
for Ube1L, we expressed and purified a set of chimeric UbcH8-UbcH7 proteins
( Fig. 3 ). These proteins were
assayed for ISG15 thioester formation with purified Ube1L and 32 P-labeled ISG15, as well as for Ub thioester formation with
E1 Ub and 32 P-labeled Ub
( Fig. 4 ). To ensure incubation
times were within the initial velocity period, reaction progress curves were
examined for UbcH8 with Ube1L and UbcH7 with E1 Ub . Two time points
were used for Ub thioester assays, as UbcH8∼Ub thioester formation was
nearly undetectable after 1 min. Chimeras A and B, containing either the
N-terminal 39 or 70 residues of UbcH8, functioned similar to UbcH8 in ISG15
thioester formation (87 and 89%, respectively, relative to UbcH8), while
thioester formation with chimera C (containing residues 1–122 of UbcH7)
was undetectable. These results suggested that the N-terminal 39 residues of
UbcH8 contain the major determinants for productive interaction with Ube1L.
Interestingly, chimera C formed a Ub thioester with similar efficiency as
wild-type UbcH7 in reactions programmed with E1 Ub , suggesting that
the determinants of E1 Ub -UbcH7 specificity correspond, at least
broadly, to the determinants of Ube1L-UbcH8 interaction. Chimeras A and B also
formed Ub thioesters at a relatively low efficiency, similar to wild-type
UbcH8, further suggesting that the N-terminal regions of UbcH8 and UbcH7
direct specificity for Ube1L and E1 Ub , respectively.

Additional chimeras ( Fig. 3 )
were made to further localize the determinants of UbcH8 required for
functional interaction with Ube1L. Surprisingly, chimeras D and E, containing
only the first 14 or first 7 residues of UbcH8, were positive for ISG15
thioester formation (at 23 and 24%, respectively, of level of UbcH8; Fig. 4 B ). Chimera D
contains the complete α1-helix, while E contains the N-terminal half of
the α1-helix, which includes the conserved E2 sequence motif described
above ( X Rφ XX (D/E) X , where R is residue 5 of
UbcH8). One significant difference between UbcH8 and UbcH7 within this region
is that UbcH8 contains a methionine at residue 4, while UbcH7 contains an
arginine at the analogous position. The M 4 R mutant of UbcH8
(chimera F) was diminished in thioester formation by 31% relative to UbcH8. In
addition to residue 4, UbcH8 contains VV at residues 6–7, whereas UbcH7
contains LM at the analogous positions. ISG15 thioester formation was
decreased by 69% when the LM sequence replaced the VV sequence of UbcH8
(chimera G). Furthermore, chimeras F and G functioned much better with Ub than
wild-type UbcH8 when incubated for 10 min. These results indicate that the
α1-helix of UbcH8 is an important determinant, but not the sole
determinant, of specificity for Ube1L.

As noted above, linker residues between the α1-helix and the
β1-sheet (UbcH8 resides 16–21) are very divergent between UbcH8 and
UbcH7, and we therefore addressed whether these residues contributed to the
specificity of UbcH8 for Ube1L in vitro . A chimera was constructed
with the linker residues from UbcH7 replacing those of UbcH8 (chimera H). This
resulted in a 19% decrease in thioester formation relative to UbcH8. A more
dramatic decrease of 62% was observed when UbcH8 residues 17–19 (PPP)
were mutated to AAA (chimera I). Ub thioester formation with chimera H was
comparable to UbcH8 while no Ub thioester formation was observed with chimera
I. This suggests that the linker sequence might not be a direct determinant of
specificity for Ube1L, but rather that alterations of this sequence might have
deleterious structural effects on the orientation of the α1-helix or the
β1-β2 region (discussed further below). Consistent with this
possibility, the crystal structure of Ubc12 core with a fragment of
Uba3 revealed no interaction of the UFD with the corresponding
Ubc12 core α1-β1 linker
( 21 ).

The third region within the N-terminal 39 residues with the potential to
influence Ube1L interactions was the β1-β2 region (residues
21–39). ISG15 thioester formation of chimera K (containing residues
22–152 of UbcH8) was 22% of that of UbcH8, while thioester formation of
chimera J (containing residues 21–154 of UbcH7) was 27% of UbcH8. This
indicates that the UbcH8 β1-β2 region contributes to ISG15 thioester
formation, but that it is not sufficient for full activation. There are few
amino acid differences between UbcH7 and UbcH8 within the β1-β2
region; however, UbcH8 contains SS at resides 25–26 while UbcH7 contains
QV at the analogous positions. When these residues were exchanged in UbcH8
(chimera L), ISG15 thioester formation was reduced by 13%, and this chimera
functioned 4-fold better than UbcH8 with E1 Ub . These results are
consistent with the β1-β2 region of UbcH7 and UbcH8 being an
additional determinant of E1 recognition.

Kinetic analyses of select chimeras were used to further analyze the role
of structural elements within the first 39 residues of UbcH8. Replacement of
the α1-helix or β1-β2 region of UbcH8 with UbcH7 residues
(chimeras D, K, or J) resulted in a 27–29-fold increase in the K m of Ube1L compared with wild-type UbcH8
( Table 1 ). These chimeras also
showed a large decrease in k cat / K m compared with UbcH8. In contrast, residues in the linker region (chimera H)
had a K m and k cat similar to that of
wild-type UbcH8. This was reflected in a k cat / K m ratio that was 80% that of
UbcH8 compared with ratios ∼1–3% of UbcH8 for chimeras D, K, and J.
Finally, the K m of Ube1L for chimera A, containing the
first 39 residues of UbcH8, was very similar to that of wild-type UbcH8,
although k cat / K m for chimera A was
∼5-fold lower than UbcH8. This suggests that chimera A contains the
determinants necessary for efficient Ube1L interaction, but that it may be
partially defective for accepting ISG15 from Ube1L. Overall, these results are
consistent with the UbcH8 α1-helix and β1-β2 regions being the
primary elements recognized by Ube1L.

Interaction of UbcH8 with the UFD of Ube1L —The Sae2 and Uba3
proteins, components of the Sumo and Nedd8 E1 enzymes, respectively, contain a
C-terminal Ub fold domain (UFD). This is the primary site for interaction with
the core domains of their appropriate E2 enzymes
( 21 , 22 ). It was proposed that the
C terminus of Ube1L is also likely to contain a UFD based on structural
propensities of residues conserved with Uba3
( 21 ). To determine whether the
UFD of Ube1L has a similar role as in Sae2 and Uba3, a C-terminal deletion
mutant of Ube1L (Ube1LΔUFD) was constructed, lacking the last 102 amino
acids of the protein (residues 911–1012). If the UFD is the site of
interaction with UbcH8 then the Ube1LΔUFD would be predicted to be able
to form an ISG15 thioester, but be unable to transfer ISG15 to UbcH8. As shown
in Fig. 5 A , this was
the case. In addition, the Ube1LΔUFD mutant did not support ISG15
conjugation when co-transfected with ISG15, UbcH8, and Herc5 into
non-interferon-treated 293 cells ( Fig.
5 B ).

The purified UFD fragment of Ube1L (consisting of residues 902–1013)
was predicted to compete with full-length Ube1L for binding to UbcH8, and as
shown in Fig. 5 C , the
UFD inhibited UbcH8∼ISG15 thioester formation in a concentration-dependent
manner. Finally, a chimeric Ube1L protein was created in which the UFD of
Ube1L was replaced with the UFD from E1 Ub (Ube1L-UFD Ub ;
replaces residues 910–1013 of Ube1L with residues 951–1059 of
E1 Ub ). In vitro , Ube1L-UFD Ub would be expected
to transfer ISG15 preferentially to UbcH7, rather than UbcH8, and this was
indeed the case ( Fig.
5 D ). The chimeric Ube1L-UFD Ub protein was much
less stable and less active than wild-type Ube1L, and therefore the absolute
efficiencies of UbcH7∼ISG15 thioester formation in the presence of the
chimeric and wild-type Ube1L enzymes were not directly comparable.
Nevertheless, the fact that the chimeric Ube1L preferentially transferred
ISG15 to UbcH7 over UbcH8 is consistent with a model where the primary
determinants of E1-E2 interactions in the ISG15 system are specified by the
UFD of Ube1L with the α1-helix and β1-β2 region of UbcH8.

DISCUSSION

The inherent similarities between Ub and Ubls and the enzymes of their
conjugation systems leads to important questions about whether all Ub/Ubl
pathways are separate and distinct, and if so, how specificity is determined.
We have shown here that the basis for Ube1L-UbcH8 specificity is similar to
that described previously in the Sumo and Nedd8 systems: interactions between
the UFD of the Ube1L and the α1-helix and β1-β2 regions of
UbcH8 are the major specificity determinants. Subtle differences in these
regions between UbcH8 and UbcH7 are sufficient to allow effective
discrimination against this very closely related Ub E2. Furthermore, the
degree to which Ube1L discriminates against UbcH7 (based on K m values) is similar to the degree to which
E1 Ub discriminates against UbcH8, raising the question of whether
UbcH8 functions in the Ub system. Similar results and conclusions concerning
the role of UbcH8 in Ub conjugation have been discussed previously
( 32 ).

A UbcH8-UbcH7 chimeric E2-containing residues 1–39 of UbcH8 (chimera
A) could interact efficiently with Ube1L. Within this N-terminal region, both
the α1-helix and the β1-β2 region contributed to Ube1L
specificity. Kinetic assays with chimeras containing either the α1-helix
or the β1-β2 region of UbcH7 resulted in K m and k cat / K m values similar to those of
UbcH7. Within the α1-helix, there are only three non-conserved residues
and alteration of these residues in UbcH8 to those found in UbcH7 decreased in vitro E2∼ISG15 thioester formation significantly, while
E2∼Ub thioester formation was correspondingly increased. Two of the three
residues, M 4 and V 7 , correspond in position to residues
of Ubc12 that make key interactions with the Uba3 component of the Nedd8 E1
( 21 , 24 , 33 ).

The β1-β2 region also contributed to Ube1L-UbcH8 specificity
(comparing, for example, chimeras A and J in ISG15 thioester formation);
however it is likely that multiple subtle differences between UbcH8 and UbcH7
within this region contribute to this specificity. SS 25–26 is
the most divergent dipeptide in this region of UbcH8 (QV 26–27 in UbcH7), and the residue corresponding to UbcH8 S 26 in the Ubc9p
and Ubc12 structures was previously shown to be important for SUMO and Nedd8
thioester formation, respectively
( 24 , 33 ). Exchange of
SS 25–26 in UbcH8 for QV 26–27 led to a small
but significant decrease in ISG15 thioester formation. Interestingly, this
mutant formed a Ub thioester with an ∼4-fold increased efficiency relative
to wild-type UbcH8. It is therefore possible that SS 25–26 may
serve less as a specificity determinant for Ube1L-UbcH8 interaction than as a
barrier to E1 Ub -UbcH8 interaction. A role for such barriers in
establishing E1-E2 specificities has recently been proposed in an analysis of
the Nedd8 E2, Ubc12, where it was shown that certain surface residues of Ubc12
appear to function more in preventing mischarging by E1 Ub than in
specifying charging by the Nedd8 E1
( 34 ).

The third structural element within residues 1–39 of UbcH8 is the
linker between α1 and β1, and it is the most divergent region of
sequence over the entire length of UbcH7 and UbcH8. A direct swap of UbcH7
linker into UbcH8 however, had little effect on the K m of
chimera H compared with wild-type UbcH8. Furthermore, comparison of chimeras J
(UbcH8 α1-helix and linker) and D (UbcH8 α1-helix only) revealed
only a minor difference in thioester formation, suggesting that the linker
sequence per se is not a determinant of Ube1L-UbcH8 specificity. This
is consistent with the fact that the corresponding element in Ubc12 does not
make contact with the Uba3 UFD in the co-crystal structure
( 21 ).

As in the Sumo and Nedd8 E1s, the C-terminal UFD of Ube1L is essential for
transfer of ISG15 to UbcH8 and a chimeric Ube1L containing the UFD from
E1 Ub preferentially transferred ISG15 to UbcH7 over UbcH8. The fact
that the chimeric Ube1L-UFD Ub protein had very low activity
compared with wild-type Ube1L precluded analyses to determine whether the UFD
was the sole determinant of E2 specificity, and based on detailed structural
studies of Ubc12 with the Nedd8 E1 complex it is likely that there is an
additional surface(s) involved in the Ube1L-UbcH8 interaction
( 34 ). Nevertheless, the
results presented here strongly support a model in which the primary basis for
preferential transfer of ISG15 to UbcH8 is the ability to recruit the E2 via
the UFD.

Interestingly, before UbcH8 was shown to be E2 for the ISG15 system
( 5 , 8 , 9 ), it was reported to be an E2
for the Ub system
( 10 – 14 , 16 , 17 , 20 , 35 ). However, endogenous UbcH8
expression levels are very low in most non-interferon human cell lines,
including HeLa, A549, and 293 cells, where it is virtually undetectable by
immunoblotting (see supplemental data). While interferon-β treatment of
HeLa cells leads to the induction of UbcH8, transient transfection of a CMV
promoter-based UbcH8 expression vector led to an ∼60-fold higher level of
UbcH8 over the interferon-induced level of endogenous UbcH8 (supplemental
data). Combined with the relatively high K m of
E1 Ub for UbcH8, these observations suggest that: 1) UbcH8 is
unlikely to function in Ub conjugation in many commonly utilized cell lines
(at least in the absence of interferon stimulation), and 2) that experimental
overexpression may lead to such high levels of UbcH8 that the relatively high K m of E1 Ub for UbcH8 might be overcome,
allowing it to function in Ub conjugation and leading to potentially erroneous
conclusions regarding the participation of UbcH8 in Ub-dependent processes.
Alternatively, there may be cell or tissues types where UbcH8 expression is
sufficient to allow its utilization in the Ub system. For example, global
microarray gene expression profiling suggests that UbcH8 may be preferentially
expressed in certain cells of the immune system
( 36 ). Finally, a second E1
enzyme for Ub has been recently described, Uba6/E1-L2
( 37 – 39 ),
raising the possibility that UbcH8 might normally be activated with Ub through
Uba6 rather than E1 Ub (Ube1). However, in end-point thioester
assays, UbcH8 was not activated with Ub any more efficiently by Uba6 than
E1 Ub (Ube1)
( 39 ).

If UbcH8 does not function in Ub-dependent processes, why has the ISG15
system evolved to utilize an E2 that is so similar to UbcH7 (as well as other
related E2s, such as the UbcH5 family of E2s)? Why has UbcH8 not diverged more
extensively from E2s of the Ub system? One possibility may be related to the
fact that the major E3 for the ISG15 system is a HECT E3, Herc5
( 27 ). Herc5 is the only HECT
E3 known to function with a modifier other than Ub, and because of inherent
HECT E3 structure and/or the unique mechanism of HECT E3s, Herc5 might place
considerable constraints on the how far the primary sequence of UbcH8 can
diverge from other human E2s that function with HECT E3s ( e.g. UbcH5a, b, c, UbcH6, UbcH7).

Interestingly, there are other features of the ISG15 system that more
closely resemble features of the Ub system than other Ubl systems. For
example, human Ube1L is the most closely related E1 enzyme to human
Ube1/E1 Ub ( 38 ), and
ISG15 is the only Ubl where the last six residues of the protein (LRLRGG) are
identical to that of Ub. Are these similarities indicative of functional or
regulatory overlap between these pathways? As with UbcH8, it is clear that no
other E3 can substitute for the broad effect of Herc5 in ISG15 conjugation
( 27 ); however, it is not known
whether Herc5 might also function in Ub conjugation. There may be mechanistic
or structural features of Herc5 that distinguish it from Ub HECT E3s, or Herc5
might simply preferentially recruit UbcH8 over other E2s. These unique
problems make the ISG15 system of interest for addressing general mechanism
and design of Ubl conjugation systems. In addition, understanding the
biochemistry of ISG15 conjugation may ultimately aid in the elucidation of the
biochemical function of ISG15 conjugation and the basis of its antiviral
activity.
