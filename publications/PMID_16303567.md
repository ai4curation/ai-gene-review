Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division by which sexually reproducing 
diploid organisms generate haploid gametes. During a long prophase, telomeres 
cluster into the bouquet configuration to aid chromosome pairing, and DNA 
replication is followed by high levels of recombination between homologous 
chromosomes (homologs). This recombination is important for the reductional 
segregation of homologs at the first meiotic division; without further 
replication, a second meiotic division yields haploid nuclei. In the fission 
yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we have deleted 175 meiotically upregulated 
genes and found seven genes not previously reported to be critical for meiotic 
events. Three mutants (rec24, rec25, and rec27) had strongly reduced 
meiosis-specific DNA double-strand breakage and recombination. One mutant (tht2) 
was deficient in karyogamy, and two (bqt1 and bqt2) were deficient in telomere 
clustering, explaining their defects in recombination and segregation. The moa1 
mutant was delayed in premeiotic S phase progression and nuclear divisions. 
Further analysis of these mutants will help elucidate the complex machinery 
governing the special behavior of meiotic chromosomes.
