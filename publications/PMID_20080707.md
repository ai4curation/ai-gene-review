EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling in human cancers elicits changes in 
protein-expression patterns that are crucial for potentiating tumor growth. 
Identifying those proteins with expression regulated by the EGFR and determining 
how they contribute to malignancy is fundamental for the development of more 
effective strategies to treat cancer. Here, we show that tissue transglutaminase 
(tTG) is one such protein. EGF up-regulates tTG expression in human 
breast-cancer cells, and knock-downs of tTG or the treatment of breast cancer 
cells with a tTG inhibitor blocks their EGF-stimulated anchorage-independent 
growth. We further show that the combined actions of Ras and Cdc42, leading to 
the activation of PI 3-kinase and NFkappaB, provide a mechanism by which EGF can 
up-regulate tTG in breast-cancer cells. Moreover, overexpression of wild-type 
tTG, but not its transamidation-defective counterpart, fully mimics the growth 
advantages afforded by EGF to these cancer cells. Surprisingly, the tTG-promoted 
growth of breast-cancer cells is dependent on its ability to activate the Src 
tyrosine kinase as an outcome of a complex formed between tTG and the 
breast-cancer marker and intermediate filament protein keratin-19. These 
findings identify tTG as a key participant in an EGFR/Src-signaling pathway in 
breast-cancer cells and a potential target for inhibiting EGFR-promoted tumor 
progression.

Abstract

EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling in human cancers elicits changes in protein-expression patterns that are crucial for potentiating tumor growth. Identifying those proteins with expression regulated by the EGFR and determining how they contribute0 to malignancy is fundamental for the development of more effective strategies to treat cancer. Here, we show that tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is one such protein. EGF up-regulates tTG expression in human breast-cancer cells, and knock-downs of tTG or the treatment of breast cancer cells with a tTG inhibitor blocks their EGF-stimulated anchorage-independent growth. We further show that the combined actions of Ras and Cdc42, leading to the activation of PI 3-kinase and NFκB, provide a mechanism by which EGF can up-regulate tTG in breast-cancer cells. Moreover, overexpression of wild-type tTG, but not its transamidation-defective counterpart, fully mimics the growth advantages afforded by EGF to these cancer cells. Surprisingly, the tTG-promoted growth of breast-cancer cells is dependent on its ability to activate the Src tyrosine kinase as an outcome of a complex formed between tTG and the breast-cancer marker and intermediate filament protein keratin-19. These findings identify tTG as a key participant in an EGFR/Src-signaling pathway in breast-cancer cells and a potential target for inhibiting EGFR-promoted tumor progression.

Discussion

Excessive activation of the EGFR contributes to oncogenesis by stimulating the growth and survival of cancer cells, whereas small molecule inhibitors or antibody-based approaches that target the EGFR or its immediate downstream effectors have shown some promise as treatments for certain human cancers ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ). Therefore, continuing efforts to better understand the mechanisms by which the EGFR stimulates cancer progression will play a critical part in the development of alternative strategies to treat cancers. Although it is generally appreciated that the EGFR modifies global gene-expression patterns in cells, the identities of those gene products whose induction is most important for cell growth and/or survival are largely unknown. Here, we have identified tTG, a dual-function GTPase/acyl transferase, as one such protein. The initial indication for this came from the finding that stimulating SKBR3 or BT20 breast-cancer cells with EGF not only increased their proliferative capacity and ability to form colonies in soft agar, but it also resulted in the induction of tTG expression and activation. Suppressing tTG expression or activity potently inhibited the EGF-induced growth advantages in each of these cell lines. We further showed that overexpression of tTG WT in SKBR3 cells could fully recapitulate the growth-stimulatory actions of EGF, which implicates tTG as a key participate in EGFR-promoted cellular transformation.

Thus far, very little has been known about the signaling pathways that mediate EGF-induced tTG expression. However, we have begun to delineate some of the events that must occur to stimulate tTG expression and cellular transformation, which are summarized in Fig. 6 . Although the individual ectopic expression of activated forms of various signaling proteins in SKBR3 cells did not induce tTG expression, we found that the Ras- and Cdc42-signaling pathways cooperated to up-regulate tTG. We then showed that the induction of tTG expression by either EGF stimulation or coexpression of activated Ras and Cdc42 was sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 as well as the NFκB inhibitor BAY 11-7082.

Increasing the levels of tTG expression in SKBR3 breast-cancer cells enhances their oncogenic potential, and thus, it mirrors the actions of EGF treatment. Surprisingly, we discovered that this is caused by the ability of tTG to activate c-Src. Consistent with these results, as well as with several lines of evidence linking Src kinase activity to tumor progression, the anchorage-independent growth advantage afforded to SKBR3 cells by either EGF stimulation or tTG overexpression was severely compromised when these cells were cultured in the presence of the Src inhibitor PP2. Overall, these findings highlight an interesting connection between the overexpression of tTG observed in increasing numbers of breast cancer as well as other human cancers and the presence of elevated Src activity.

An intriguing question concerns how tTG expression leads to increased Src activity in cells. We obtained a clue when we found that Src coimmunoprecipitated with tTG from SKBR3 cell lysates but that the recombinant forms of these two proteins failed to show a similar association in vitro. This implied that the tTG–Src interaction in cells was indirect and most likely mediated by another protein. Indeed, we identified the intermediate filament K19 as a tTG-binding partner that is essential for tTG’s ability to associate with Src in cells as well as the enhanced Src activity observed in the SKBR3 cells stably overexpressing tTG. Moreover, we showed that K19 is capable of being transamidated by tTG in vitro. Thus, the tTG-catalyzed cross-linking of K19 might enable it to act as a signaling scaffold that binds and favors the activated state of c-Src, an idea that we are currently investigating. Interestingly, K19 belongs to a family of cytokeratins, many of which, including K19, are overexpressed in a large number of human cancer types ( 28 , 29 ) that are routinely used as diagnostic indicators of metastasis and tumor aggressiveness ( 24 – 26 ). Given the connections between K19 and human cancers, an important question has been whether or not the cytokeratins directly contribute to oncogenesis. Our findings that K19 serves to bridge the interaction between tTG and Src ( Fig. 6 ), resulting in enhanced Src kinase activity and aberrant cell growth, point to a rather unexpected role for K19 in EGFR-promoted cellular transformation.

In summary, the findings presented in this study show that the induction of tTG expression and activation by EGF are both necessary and sufficient for mediating the growth-promoting actions of EGF in human breast-cancer cells. Interestingly, a recent proteomic screen of the U87 brain-tumor cell line overexpressing a highly oncogenic form of the EGFR known as EGFR variant type III (EGFRvIII) showed that tTG was one of three proteins whose expression was enhanced by this mutant EGFR ( 30 ). Whether or not tTG is important for promoting the oncogenic potential of EGFRvIII remains to be determined. However, our findings now point to an important relationship between EGFR-mediated transformation and tTG expression, and they suggest that tTG may represent a potentially valuable therapeutic target.
