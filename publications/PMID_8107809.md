We have shown that a polypeptide of M(r) 60,000 (60K) that shares N-terminal 
homology with a calcium-binding protein, calreticulin, can bind to an amino-acid 
sequence motif, KXGFFKR, found in the cytoplasmic domains of all integrin 
alpha-subunits. The homologous amino-acid sequence, KXFFKR (where X is either G, 
A or V), is also present in the DNA-binding domain of all known members of the 
steroid hormone receptor family; amino acids in this sequence make direct 
contact with nucleotides in their DNA-responsive elements and are crucial for 
DNA binding. Here we show that both the 60K protein (p60), purified on a 
KLGFFKR-Sepharose affinity matrix, and recombinant calreticulin can inhibit the 
binding of androgen receptor to its hormone-responsive DNA element in a 
KXFFKR-sequence-specific manner. Calreticulin can also inhibit androgen receptor 
and retinoic acid receptor transcriptional activities in vivo, as well as 
retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Our results indicate that 
calreticulin can act as an important modulator of the regulation of gene 
transcription by nuclear hormone receptors.
