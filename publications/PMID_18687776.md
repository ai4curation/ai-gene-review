The Vps10p family member sortilin is involved in various cell processes, 
including protein trafficking. Here we found that sortilin is expressed in 
thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes) in a TSH-dependent manner, that the 
hormone precursor thyroglobulin (Tg) is a high-affinity sortilin ligand, and 
that binding to sortilin occurs after Tg endocytosis, resulting in Tg recycling. 
Sortilin was found to be expressed intracellularly in thyrocytes, as observed in 
mouse, human, and rat thyroid as well as in FRTL-5 cells. Sortilin expression 
was demonstrated to be TSH dependent, both in FRTL-5 cells and in mice treated 
with methimazole and perchlorate. Plasmon resonance binding assays showed that 
Tg binds to sortilin in a concentration-dependent manner and with high affinity, 
with Kd values that paralleled the hormone content of Tg. In addition, we found 
that Tg and sortilin interact in vivo and in cultured cells, as observed by 
immunoprecipitation, in mouse thyroid extracts and in COS-7 cells transiently 
cotransfected with sortilin and Tg. After incubation of FRTL-5 cells with 
exogenous, labeled Tg, sortilin and Tg interacted intracellularly, presumably 
within the endocytic pathway, as observed by immunofluorescence and 
immunoelectron microscopy, the latter technique showing some degree of Tg 
recycling. This was confirmed in FRTL-5 cells in which Tg recycling was reduced 
by silencing of the sortilin gene and in CHO cells transfected with sortilin in 
which recycling was increased. Our findings provide a novel pathway of Tg 
trafficking and a novel function of sortilin in the thyroid gland, the 
functional impact of which remains to be established.
