The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RIM15 gene was identified previously through a 
mutation that caused reduced ability to undergo meiosis. We report here an 
analysis of the cloned RIM15 gene, which specifies a 1,770-residue polypeptide 
with homology to serine/threonine protein kinases. Rim15p is most closely 
related to Schizosaccharomyces pombe cek1+. Analysis of epitope-tagged 
derivatives indicates that Rim15p has autophosphorylation activity. Deletion of 
RIM15 causes reduced expression of several early meiotic genes (IME2, SPO13, and 
HOP1) and of IME1, which specifies an activator of early meiotic genes. However, 
overexpression of IME1 does not permit full expression of early meiotic genes in 
a rim15delta mutant. Ime1p activates early meiotic genes through its interaction 
with Ume6p, and analysis of Rim15p-dependent regulatory sites at the IME2 
promoter indicates that activation through Ume6p is defective. Two-hybrid 
interaction assays suggest that Ime1p-Ume6p interaction is diminished in a rim15 
mutant. Glucose inhibits Ime1p-Ume6p interaction, and we find that Rim15p 
accumulation is repressed in glucose-grown cells. Thus, glucose repression of 
Rim15p may be responsible for glucose inhibition of Ime1p-Ume6p interaction.
