The yeast SIR2 gene and many of its homologs have been identified as 
NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylases. To get a broader view of the relationship 
between the histone deacetylase activity of Sir2p and its in vivo functions we 
have mutated eight highly conserved residues in the core domain of SIR2. These 
mutations have a range of effects on the ability of Sir2p to deacetylate 
histones in vitro and to silence genes at the telomeres and HM loci. 
Interestingly, there is not a direct correlation between the in vitro and in 
vivo effects in some of these mutations. We also show that the histone 
deacetylase activity of Sir2p is necessary for the proper localiztion of the SIR 
complex to the telomeres.
