Autophagy cargos include not only soluble cytosolic materials but also bulky 
organelles, such as ER and mitochondria. In budding yeast, two proteins that 
contain the PX domain and the BAR domain, Atg20 and Atg24 (also known as Snx42 
and Snx4, respectively) are required for organelle autophagy and contribute to 
general autophagy in a way that can be masked by compensatory mechanisms. It 
remains unclear why these proteins are important for organelle autophagy. Here, 
we show that in a distantly related fungal organism, the fission yeast 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, autophagy of ER and mitochondria is induced by 
nitrogen starvation and is promoted by three Atg20- and Atg24-family proteins - 
Atg20, Atg24 and SPBC1711.11 (named here as Atg24b). These proteins localize at 
the pre-autophagosomal structure, or phagophore assembly site (PAS), during 
starvation. S. pombe Atg24 forms a homo-oligomer and acts redundantly with Atg20 
and Atg24b, and the latter two proteins can form a hetero-oligomer. The 
organelle autophagy defect caused by the loss of these proteins is associated 
with a reduction of autophagosome size and a decrease in Atg8 accumulation at 
the PAS. These results provide new insights into the autophagic function of 
Atg20- and Atg24-family proteins.
