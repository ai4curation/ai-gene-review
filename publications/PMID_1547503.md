By the 4-cell stage of C. elegans embryogenesis, a ventral blastomere, called 
EMS, is already committed to producing pharyngeal and intestinal cell types. 
Recessive, maternal-effect mutations in the gene skn-1 prevent EMS from 
producing both pharyngeal and intestinal cells. In skn-1 mutant embryos, EMS 
instead produces hypodermal cells and body wall muscle cells, much like its 
sister blastomere. Genetic analysis suggests that the skn-1 gene product is also 
required post-embryonically for development of the intestine. We have cloned and 
sequenced the skn-1 gene and describe sequence similarities to the basic regions 
of bZIP transcription factors. We propose that the maternally expressed skn-1 
gene product acts to specify the fate of the EMS blastomere.
