Episialin (MUC1) is a transmembrane molecule with a large mucin-like 
extracellular domain protruding high above the cell surface. The molecule is 
located at the apical side of most glandular epithelial cells, whereas in 
carcinoma cells it is often present at the entire surface and it is frequently 
expressed in abnormally large quantities. We have previously shown that 
overexpression of episialin reduces cell-cell interactions. Here we show that 
the integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix of transfectants of a 
melanoma cell line (A375), a transformed epithelial cell line (MDCK-ras-e) and a 
human breast epithelial cell line (HBL-100) is reduced by high levels of 
episialin. This reduction can be reversed by inducing high avidity of the beta 1 
integrins by mAb TS2/16 (at least for beta 1-mediated adhesion). The adhesion 
can also be restored by redistribution of episialin on the cell surface by 
monoclonal antibodies into patches or caps. Similarly, capping of episialin on 
ZR-75-1 breast carcinoma cells, growing in suspension, caused adherence and 
spreading of these cells. We propose that there is a delicate balance between 
adhesion and anti-adhesion forces in episialin expressing cells, which can be 
shifted towards adhesion by strengthening the integrin-mediated adhesion, or 
towards anti-adhesion by increasing the level of expression of episialin.
