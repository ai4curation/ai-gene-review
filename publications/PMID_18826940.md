Mitochondrial complex I (CI) is a large assembly of 45 different subunits, and 
defects in its biogenesis are the most frequent cause of mitochondrial 
disorders. In vitro evidence suggests a stepwise assembly process involving 
pre-assembled modules. However, whether these modules also exist in vivo is as 
yet unresolved. To answer this question, we here applied submitochondrial 
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to HEK293 cells expressing 6 
GFP-tagged subunits selected on the basis of current CI assembly models. We 
established that each subunit was partially present in a virtually immobile 
fraction, possibly representing the holo-enzyme. Four subunits (NDUFV1, NDUFV2, 
NDUFA2, and NDUFA12) were also present as highly mobile matrix-soluble monomers, 
whereas, in sharp contrast, the other two subunits (NDUFB6 and NDUFS3) were 
additionally present in a slowly mobile fraction. In the case of the integral 
membrane protein NDUFB6, this fraction most likely represented one or more 
membrane-bound subassemblies, whereas biochemical evidence suggested that for 
the NDUFS3 protein this fraction most probably corresponded to a matrix-soluble 
subassembly. Our results provide first time evidence for the existence of CI 
subassemblies in mitochondria of living cells.
