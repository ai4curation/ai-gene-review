Fc receptor-like proteins (FcRLs) are a growing family of molecules homologous 
to FcgammaRI. Whereas all 7 previously reported Fc receptor homologs are 
expressed by B cells, here we report a new receptor, FcRL6, that is expressed by 
cytolytic cells including natural killer (NK) cells and effector and 
effector-memory CD8(+) T cells. FcRL6 contains a novel cytoplasmic cysteine-rich 
motif and recruits SHP-2 through a phosphorylated ITIM, indicating a potential 
signaling function in effector lymphocytes. In vitro, FcRL6 does not greatly 
influence NK-cell or CD8(+) T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and has minimal impact 
on cytokine secretion. However, FcRL6 expression among T lymphocytes is greatly 
expanded in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals, 
and includes not only effector and effector-memory CD8(+) T cells but also 
populations of CD4(+) T cells. Expansion of FcRL6-positive lymphocytes is not 
related to viral load, but is indicative of the dysregulated expansion of 
terminally differentiated effector lymphocyte populations in response to chronic 
HIV-1 infection and may serve as an important marker for chronic immune 
activation and for tracking the generation of effector cells following immune 
stimulation.
