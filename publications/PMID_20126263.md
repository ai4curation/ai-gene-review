DNA damage checkpoints arrest cell cycle progression to facilitate DNA repair. 
The ability to survive genotoxic insults depends not only on the initiation of 
cell cycle checkpoints but also on checkpoint maintenance. While activation of 
DNA damage checkpoints has been studied extensively, molecular mechanisms 
involved in sustaining and ultimately inactivating cell cycle checkpoints are 
largely unknown. Here, we explored feedback mechanisms that control the 
maintenance and termination of checkpoint function by computationally 
identifying an evolutionary conserved mitotic phosphorylation network within the 
DNA damage response. We demonstrate that the non-enzymatic checkpoint adaptor 
protein 53BP1 is an in vivo target of the cell cycle kinases Cyclin-dependent 
kinase-1 and Polo-like kinase-1 (Plk1). We show that Plk1 binds 53BP1 during 
mitosis and that this interaction is required for proper inactivation of the DNA 
damage checkpoint. 53BP1 mutants that are unable to bind Plk1 fail to restart 
the cell cycle after ionizing radiation-mediated cell cycle arrest. Importantly, 
we show that Plk1 also phosphorylates the 53BP1-binding checkpoint kinase Chk2 
to inactivate its FHA domain and inhibit its kinase activity in mammalian cells. 
Thus, a mitotic kinase-mediated negative feedback loop regulates the ATM-Chk2 
branch of the DNA damage signaling network by phosphorylating conserved sites in 
53BP1 and Chk2 to inactivate checkpoint signaling and control checkpoint 
duration.
