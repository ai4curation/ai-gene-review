CASK-interactive protein1 is a newly recognized post-synaptic density protein in 
mammalian neurons. Although its N-terminal region contains several well-known 
functional domains, its entire C-terminal proline-rich region of 800 amino acids 
lacks detectable sequence homology to any previously characterized protein. We 
used multiple techniques for the structural characterization of this region and 
its three fragments. By bioinformatics predictions, CD spectroscopy, wide-line 
and 1H-NMR spectroscopy, limited proteolysis and gel filtration chromatography, 
we provided evidence that the entire proline-rich region of CASK-interactive 
protein1 is intrinsically disordered. We also showed that the proline-rich 
region is biochemically functional, as it interacts with the adaptor protein 
Abl-interactor-2. To extend the finding of a high level of disorder in this 
scaffold protein, we collected 74 scaffold proteins (also including proteins 
denoted as anchor and docking), and predicted their disorder by three different 
algorithms. We found that a very high fraction (53.6; on average) of the 
residues fall into local disorder and their ordered domains are connected by 
linker regions which are mostly disordered (64.5 on average). Because of this 
high frequency of disorder, the usual design of scaffold proteins of short 
globular domains (86 amino acids on average) connected by longer linker regions 
(140 amino acids on average) and the noted binding functions of these regions in 
both CASK-interactive protein1 and the other proteins studied, we suggest that 
structurally disordered regions prevail and play key recognition roles in 
scaffold proteins.
