beta-Amyloid protein precursors (APPs, 695-770 amino acids) are the source of 
the 39-43 amino acid beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides that comprise diffuse and 
fibrillar deposits in the cerebral cortex and vasculature of Alzheimer's disease 
brains. A beta is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease, and, hence, considerable effort has been invested in defining the means 
by which A beta is generated from the APPs. Knowledge of the normal function of 
the APPs is sure to provide insights into the genesis and pathological 
persistence of A beta in Alzheimer's disease. APP is a cell surface protein with 
a large extracellular amino-terminal domain, a single transmembrane segment, and 
a short cytoplasmic tail. Its location and structural features characteristic of 
a receptor for signal transduction led us to search for potential effector 
proteins capable of binding and interacting with its cytoplasmic domain. Here, 
we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding one such protein. This ubiquitously 
expressed 59-kDa APP-binding protein, called APP-BP1, is 61% similar to a 
protein encoded by the Arabidopsis AXR1 gene, required for normal response to 
the hormone auxin, and is a relative of the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1.
