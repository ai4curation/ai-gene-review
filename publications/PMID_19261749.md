The ability to sense and respond to DNA damage is critical to maintenance of 
genomic stability and the prevention of cancer. In this study, we employed a 
genetic screen to identify a gene, NBA1 (new component of the BRCA1 A complex), 
that is required for resistance to ionizing radiation. The NBA1 protein 
localizes to sites of DNA damage and is required for G2/M checkpoint control. 
Proteomic analysis revealed that NBA1 is a component of the BRCA1 A complex, 
which also contains Brca1/Bard1, Abra1, RAP80, BRCC36, and BRE. NBA1 is required 
to maintain BRE and Abra1 abundance and for the recruitment of BRCA1 to sites of 
DNA damage. In depth bioinformatics analysis revealed that the BRCA1 A complex 
bears striking similarities to the 19S proteasome complex. Furthermore, we show 
that four members of the BRCA1-A complex possess a polyubiquitin chain-binding 
capability, thus forming a complex that might facilitate the deubiquitinating 
activity of the deubiquitination enzyme BRCC36 or the E3 ligase activity of the 
BRCA1/BARD1 ligase. These findings provide a new perspective from which to view 
the BRCA1 A complex.

Abstract

The ability to sense and respond to DNA damage is critical to maintenance of genomic stability and the prevention of cancer. In this study, we employed a genetic screen to identify a gene, NBA1 (new component of the BRCA1 A complex), that is required for resistance to ionizing radiation. The NBA1 protein localizes to sites of DNA damage and is required for G2/M checkpoint control. Proteomic analysis revealed that NBA1 is a component of the BRCA1 A complex, which also contains Brca1/Bard1, Abra1, RAP80, BRCC36, and BRE. NBA1 is required to maintain BRE and Abra1 abundance and for the recruitment of BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage. In depth bioinformatics analysis revealed that the BRCA1 A complex bears striking similarities to the 19S proteasome complex. Furthermore, we show that four members of the BRCA1-A complex possess a polyubiquitin chain-binding capability, thus forming a complex that might facilitate the deubiquitinating activity of the deubiquitination enzyme BRCC36 or the E3 ligase activity of the BRCA1/BARD1 ligase. These findings provide a new perspective from which to view the BRCA1 A complex.
