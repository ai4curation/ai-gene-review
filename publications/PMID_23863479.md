Brain development requires a precise balance between expansion of the neural 
progenitor pool and the production of postmitotic neurons and glia. Disruption 
of this equilibrium results in a myriad of structural abnormalities and 
disorders of the nervous system. The molecular mechanism that restricts neural 
progenitor expansion is poorly understood. Here we show that the tumor 
suppressor neurofibromatosis 2 (Nf2; merlin) limits the expansion of neural 
progenitor cells (NPCs) in the mammalian dorsal telencephalon. Nf2 is localized 
at the apical region of NPCs. In the absence of Nf2, NPCs of the cortical hem, 
hippocampal primordium and neocortical primordium overexpand, while production 
of Cajal-Retzius cells and hippocampal neurons decreases, resulting in severe 
malformation of the hippocampus in adult mice. We further show that Nf2 
functions by inhibiting the Yap/Taz transcriptional coactivators, probably 
through a mechanism that is distinct from the canonical Hippo pathway. 
Overexpressing human YAP in NPCs causes a hippocampal malformation phenotype 
that closely resembles that of Nf2 mutants and, importantly, deleting Yap in the 
Nf2 mutant background largely restores hippocampal development. Our studies 
uncover Nf2 as an important inhibitor of neural progenitor expansion and 
establish Yap/Taz as key downstream effectors of Nf2 during brain development.

INTRODUCTION

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of nervous system tumors ( Baser et al., 2003 ). It is caused by inactivating mutations of neurofibromin 2 ( NF2 ; also known as neurofibromatosis 2 or merlin), which is also mutated in a large proportion of sporadic schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. The Nf2 protein is structurally similar to the ERM proteins ezrin, radixin and moesin. Functionally, however, Nf2 is unique in having tumor-suppressor activities.

The molecular function of Nf2 appears to be complex. Numerous studies have shown that Nf2 can mediate the formation of adherens junctions, regulate the distribution of cell-surface receptors, and modulate a diverse array of signaling effectors ranging from the EGFR-Ras-ERK, Rac-PAK, PI3K-Akt, mTORC1 and Hippo-YAP pathways at the cell cortex to the CRL4 DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in the nucleus (reviewed by Li et al., 2012 ). Although Nf2 is widely expressed during mammalian embryogenesis ( Akhmametyeva et al., 2006 ), its role during development is poorly understood. Nf2 knockout mouse embryos fail to initiate gastrulation ( McClatchey et al., 1997 ). It has been suggested that defects in extra-embryonic tissues are to blame, but the nature and cause of the defects remain elusive. Two studies have shown that liver-specific Nf2 deletion results in liver overgrowth and tumorigenesis ( Benhamouche et al., 2010 ; Zhang et al., 2010 ), yet the primary cell type that is autonomously affected by Nf2 loss is unclear and the signaling pathways responsible for the phenotypes remain controversial ( Breuhahn and Schirmacher, 2010 ). Loss of Nf2 in the skin leads to defective tight junctions and loss of progenitor cell polarity, but has no effect on progenitor proliferation ( Gladden et al., 2010 ). Thus, Nf2 function and its mechanism of action are highly cell type dependent.

The mammalian brain is a highly structured ensemble comprising a vast number of diverse types of cells. The development of such a complex organ requires the exquisite coordination of progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs), including neuroepithelial cells and radial glial cells, form a pseudostratified epithelial layer that lines the ventricle of the neural tube (reviewed by Götz and Huttner, 2005 ; Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009 ). Many of the cellular processes in which Nf2 has been implicated, including cell junction formation, polarity establishment and proliferation, significantly affect NPC behavior. Although Nf2 is highly expressed in NPCs during brain development ( McLaughlin et al., 2007 ), its role in NPCs is poorly understood. A previous study using a conditional loss-of-function allele of Nf2 ( Nf2 flox2 , referred to here as Nf2 F ) ( Giovannini et al., 2000 ) and a Nestin-Cre line that drives mosaic recombination in NPCs as early as embryonic day (E) 8.5 found that Nf2 loss led to detachment of NPCs from the neuroepithelium and tissue fusion defects, including neural tube closure defects ( McLaughlin et al., 2007 ). The authors suggested that Nf2 is required specifically for the assembly, but not the maintenance, of the neuroepithelial junctional complex. However, the role of Nf2 in NPC self-renewal and differentiation was not assessed.

Here, we bypassed the early structural defects to specifically address the role of Nf2 in NPC maintenance, proliferation and differentiation during brain development. We found that Nf2 loss resulted in a severe reduction in hippocampus size. Counterintuitively, NPCs in the developing hippocampus and cortical hem, which is the hippocampal organizer, of Nf2 mutants maintained their progenitor properties longer than normal and overexpanded. Nf2 loss also caused an overexpansion of the neocortical progenitor pool, suggesting that Nf2 limits the expansion of neural progenitor populations during brain development. Through molecular and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that Nf2 functions by inhibiting the transcriptional coactivators Yap (Yap1 - Mouse Genome Informatics) and Taz (Wwtr1 - Mouse Genome Informatics). This work thus reveals a novel function of Nf2 as an inhibitor of neural progenitor expansion during brain development and establishes Yap/Taz as key mediators of Nf2 function.

DISCUSSION

Since its discovery as the causal mutation for neurofibromatosis type 2, NF2 has been recognized as having tumor-suppressor activities in many tumors, including ependymomas that arise from radial glial cells, a type of NPC ( Baser et al., 2003 ; Taylor et al., 2005 ). Nf2 function in NPCs is, however, poorly understood. Although extensive studies have implicated a number of signaling pathways as Nf2 downstream effectors, whether these effector pathways mediate Nf2 function in vivo has not been well established. In this study, we reveal that a primary function of Nf2 during brain development is to limit the expansion of the neural progenitor population. We show that, upon Nf2 loss, NPCs at the cortical hem, hippocampus and neocortex retain their early progenitor properties longer and overexpand, resulting in severe malformation of the hippocampus in the adult brain. We further provide multiple lines of evidence indicating that a major molecular function of Nf2 in brain NPCs is to inhibit Yap/Taz. First, brain tissues lacking Nf2 have increased Yap/Taz protein levels, enhanced nuclear localization of these proteins, and upregulation of their target genes. Second, transgenic mice with elevated YAP in their NPCs closely phenocopy Nf2 mutants. Last and foremost, although loss of Yap alone does not impair hippocampal development, it strongly suppresses the hippocampal defects of Nf2 mutants. Our study not only provides novel insights into Nf2 function during mammalian brain development, but might also shed light on the pathogenesis of ependymomas. Previous studies suggest that Nf2 loss promotes tumorigenesis by destabilizing cell-cell junctions ( Lallemand et al., 2003 ). Our study and those of others ( Mizuno et al., 2012 ; Striedinger et al., 2008 ) raise the possibility that upregulation of YAP/TAZ activity might be a significant contributor to tumor development.

Nf2 is required for cell-cell junction formation in several cell types ( Gladden et al., 2010 ; Lallemand et al., 2003 ). In fact, a previous study showed that Nf2 is required for the formation of NPC apical junctions during mouse brain development ( McLaughlin et al., 2007 ). Our Nf2 mutants ( Nf2 F/F ;Emx1-Cre and Nf2 F/F ;Nes-Cre ), however, do not have detectable NPC junctional defects, even though we used the same Nf2 floxed allele as the previous study. The difference could be due to the timing of Nf2 deletion: the Cre line used by McLaughlin et al. is active as early as E8.5, whereas the lines in our study are turned on after E9.5. McLaughlin et al. proposed that Nf2 is required specifically for the assembly, but not the maintenance, of the junctional complex ( McLaughlin et al., 2007 ); thus, Nf2 loss after the junctions have been established would have no effect. In agreement with this proposal, a study using epidermal keratinocytes showed that Nf2 is required for junctional maturation by directly interacting with the junctional component α-catenin and the polarity protein Par3 and thereby promoting the polarization of junctional components, which is probably why Nf2 is no longer required after the junctions have been established ( Gladden et al., 2010 ). Although this might be a parsimonious explanation, it should be noted that it is unclear when NPC apical junctions are fully established during neural tube development, how apical junctions are distributed when NPCs divide, and whether new junctions form in the expanding neuroepithelium after neural tube closure. Answers to these questions will help us to better understand the role of Nf2 in the formation of NPC junctions.

The absence of NPC junctional defects allowed us to specifically examine the role of Nf2 in progenitor self-renewal and differentiation. We showed that Nf2 promotes the developmental progression and limits the expansion of NPCs. It might seem counterintuitive that hippocampus size and neocortex thickness were reduced in adult Nf2 mutants even though NPC numbers increased during embryonic development. It is possible that certain homeostasis mechanisms eliminated the cells that failed to undergo differentiation at the correct time. We indeed observed increased cell death in Nf2 mutant brains at embryonic and early postnatal stages. In addition, the morphogenetic defects associated with the hippocampal development of Nf2 mutants are likely to play a major role in hippocampus size reduction. First, dentate gyrus growth is largely achieved by local proliferation of progenitor cells after they reach the dentate primordium ( Altman and Bayer, 1990 ). Failure of Nf2 mutants to establish the proper dentate primordium, owing to the reduction in hippocampal fissure size, disorganization of the dentate glial scaffold and consequently impaired migration of dentate precursors, is likely to have prevented further growth of the dentate gyrus. Moreover, the migration of dentate precursors and simultaneous tissue folding probably provide more space for the expansion of Ammon’s horn. Impairment of these processes in Nf2 mutants thus limited the elongation of Ammon’s horn, which was much shorter in mutants than in control mice. It is important to note that, although the reduction in CR cell number could explain why the hippocampal fissure was smaller in Nf2 mutants, it is unlikely to have caused the radial glial fibers to become overabundant and disorganized because loss of CR cells actually results in fewer radial glial fibers ( Meyer et al., 2004 ).

We provided molecular and genetic evidence that Yap, probably with Taz playing a partially redundant role, is the main downstream effector of Nf2 in brain NPCs. However, we do not fully understand how Nf2 inhibits Yap/Taz. These proteins are the key effectors of the Hippo pathway, which is a conserved pathway regulating organ growth and tumorigenesis ( Halder and Johnson, 2011 ; Yu and Guan, 2013 ). The Hippo pathway inhibits Yap/Taz by phosphorylating them on multiple serines, resulting in their sequestration in the cytoplasm and degradation. Interestingly, although Nf2 loss in NPCs led to increased Yap/Taz protein levels and nuclear localization in vivo and increased protein stability in vitro , Yap phosphorylation levels did not seem to be affected. It is possible that the change was too small to be reliably detected by our methods or that phosphorylation sites other than that recognized by the only available antibody were affected. Alternatively, Nf2 might regulate Yap/Taz through a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Recent work has shown that angiomotin proteins can inhibit Yap/Taz through a direct angiomotin-Yap/Taz interaction that is independent of Yap/Taz phosphorylation status ( Chan et al., 2011 ; Zhao et al., 2011 ), and that the tension of the actomyosin cytoskeleton can regulate Yap nuclear translocation without affecting its phosphorylation ( Dupont et al., 2011 ). Nf2 has been shown to associate with the actin network and to affect its organization (reviewed by Curto and McClatchey, 2008 ); thus, Nf2 might regulate Yap/Taz nuclear localization via the actin cytoskeleton. A previous study found that Nf2 loss in glial cells results in increased proliferation ( Houshmandi et al., 2009 ), a finding consistent with ours. Interestingly, upregulation of Src activity was found to be responsible, whereas we did not detect any change in the amount of total or active Src (phospho-Y416-Src) in E13.5 Nf2 cKO brain lysates (data not shown). These results suggest that Nf2 could function through distinct pathways in different cell types, even when the end effect is the same.

Although Yap/Taz can promote the expansion of several types of stem cells (reviewed by Barry and Camargo, 2013 ), the transcriptional program mediating this effect is unclear. In our profiling experiments aimed at detecting early changes associated with Nf2 loss or YAP overexpression, we did not find significant changes in the mRNA levels of cell cycle regulators or factors well known to be involved in NPC self-renewal and differentiation. However, we did observe upregulation of several genes involved in cell-cell junctions ( Cldn12, Pkp2 ) and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions ( Thbs1 ), and of genes encoding ECM components ( Sparc ) and transmembrane proteins that may be involved in ECM interactions ( Steap1, Podxl ) (see supplementary material Table S3). Because cell adhesions and ECM interactions play essential roles in stem cell self-renewal ( Fietz et al., 2012 ; Marthiens et al., 2010 ), it is plausible that a direct role of Yap/Taz in NPC maintenance is to regulate genes involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Understanding not only how Yap/Taz are regulated but also the transcriptional targets and cellular processes that they regulate will provide significant insight into the mechanisms that control organ development, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis.
