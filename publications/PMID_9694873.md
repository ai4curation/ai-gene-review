We previously reported the cDNA cloning and characterization of a mammalian 
mitochondrial GrpE protein ( approximately 21 kDa, mt-GrpE#1) and now provide 
evidence for the presence of distinct cytosolic ( approximately 40 kDa), 
microsomal ( approximately 50 kDa), and additional mitochondrial ( approximately 
22 kDa, mt-GrpE#2) GrpE-like members. While a cytosolic GrpE-like protein has 
recently been identified, the demonstration of both a microsomal and a second 
mitochondrial GrpE-like member represents the first in any biological system. 
Investigation of the microsomal and two mitochondrial GrpE-like proteins 
revealed that they bound specifically to Escherichia coli DnaK, and the 
complexes formed were not disrupted in the presence of 0.5 M salt but were 
readily dissociated in the presence of 5 mM ATP. The functional integrity of 
mt-GrpE#1 and #2 was verified by their ability to specifically interact with and 
stimulate the ATPase activity of mammalian mitochondrial Hsp70 (mt-Hsp70). 
Analysis of the cDNA sequences encoding the two mammalian mitochondrial 
GrpE-like proteins revealed approximately 47% positional identity at the amino 
acid level, the presence of a highly conserved mitochondrial leader sequence, 
and putative destabilization elements within the 3'-untranslated region of the 
mt-GrpE#2 transcript which are not present in the mt-GrpE#1 transcript. A 
constitutive expression of both mitochondrial GrpE-like transcripts in 22 
distinct mouse tissues was observed but possible different post-transcriptional 
regulation of the mt-GrpE#1 and #2 transcripts may confer a different expression 
pattern of the encoded proteins.
