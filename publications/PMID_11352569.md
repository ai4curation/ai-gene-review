RTP/Drg1/Cap43/rit42/TDD5/Ndr1/NDRG1 (referred to as NDRG1 hereafter) is a 
cytoplasmic protein involved in stress responses, hormone responses, cell 
growth, and differentiation. Recently, the mutation of this gene was reported to 
be causative for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom. Here, we cloned 
two human cDNAs encoding NDRG3 and NDRG4, which are homologous to NDRG1. These 
two genes, together with NDRG1 and a previously deposited cDNA (designated 
NDRG2), constitute the NDRG gene family. The four members share 57-65% amino 
acid identity. NDRG4 was further characterized because its mRNA expression was 
quite specific in brain and heart, in contrast to the relatively ubiquitous 
expression of the other three members. NDRG4 mRNA consists of three isoforms, 
NDRG4-B, NDRG4-B(var), and NDRG4-H. Northern and Western blot analyses showed 
that NDRG4-B was expressed only in the brain, whereas NDRG4-H was expressed in 
both brain and heart. NDRG4-B(var) was a minor product. NDRG4 expression was 
more abundant in adult than fetal brain and heart and was markedly decreased in 
the Alzheimer's diseased brain. In situ hybridization showed that NDRG4 was 
localized in neurons of the brain and spinal cord. The NDRG4 gene contains 17 
exons. mRNA expression of the three NDRG4 isoforms is regulated by alternative 
splicing and possibly by alternative promoter usage. The finely tuned expression 
of the NDRG gene family members suggests that they have different specific 
functions.
