Cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid-binding protein (CLPABP) is a pleckstrin 
homology domain-containing protein and is localized on the surface of 
mitochondria of cultured cells as a large protein-RNA complex. To analyze the 
physiological functions of CLPABP, we established and characterized a CLPABP 
knockout (KO) mouse. Although expression levels of CLPABP transcripts in the 
developmental organs were high, CLPABP KO mice were normal at birth and grew 
normally when young. However, old male mice presented a fatty phenotype, similar 
to that seen in metabolic syndrome, in parallel with elevated male- and 
age-dependent CLPABP gene expression. One of the reasons for this obesity in 
CLPABP KO mice is dependence on increases in leptin concentration in plasma. The 
leptin transcripts were also upregulated in the adipose tissue of KO mice 
compared with wild-type (WT) mice. To understand the difference in levels of the 
transcriptional product, we focused on the effect of CLPABP on the stability of 
mRNA involving an AU-rich element (ARE) in its 3'UTR dependence on the RNA 
stabilizer, human antigen R (HuR), which is one of the CLPABP-binding proteins. 
Increase in stability of ARE-containing mRNAs of leptin by HuR was antagonized 
by the expression of CLPABP in cultured cells. Depletion of CLPABP disturbed the 
normal subcellular localization of HuR to stress granules, and overexpression of 
CLPABP induced instability of leptin mRNA by inhibiting HuR function. 
Consequently, leptin levels in old male mice might be regulated by CLPABP 
expression, which might lead to body weight control.
