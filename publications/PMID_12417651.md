Circadian rhythms can be entrained by light to follow the daily solar cycle. In 
Drosophila melanogaster a pair of extraretinal eyelets expressing 
immunoreactivity to Rhodopsin 6 each contains four photoreceptors located 
beneath the posterior margin of the compound eye. Their axons project to the 
region of the pacemaker center in the brain with a trajectory resembling that of 
Bolwig's organ, the visual organ of the larva. A lacZ reporter line driven by an 
upstream fragment of the developmental gap gene Krüppel is a specific enhancer 
element for Bolwig's organ. Expression of immunoreactivity to the product of 
lacZ in Bolwig's organ persists through pupal metamorphosis and survives in the 
adult eyelet. We thus demonstrate that eyelet derives from the 12 photoreceptors 
of Bolwig's organ, which entrain circadian rhythmicity in the larva. Double 
labeling with anti-pigment-dispersing hormone shows that the terminals of 
Bolwig's nerve differentiate during metamorphosis in close temporal and spatial 
relationship to the ventral lateral neurons (LN(v)), which are essential to 
express circadian rhythmicity in the adult. Bolwig's organ also expresses 
immunoreactivity to Rhodopsin 6, which thus continues in eyelet. We compared 
action spectra of entrainment in different fly strains: in flies lacking 
compound eyes but retaining eyelet (so(1)), lacking both compound eyes and 
eyelet (so(1);gl(60j)), and retaining eyelet but lacking compound eyes as well 
as cryptochrome (so(1);cry(b)). Responses to phase shifts suggest that, in the 
absence of compound eyes, eyelet together with cryptochrome mainly mediates 
phase delays. Thus a functional role in circadian entrainment first found in 
Bolwig's organ in the larva is retained in eyelet, the adult remnant of Bolwig's 
organ, even in the face of metamorphic restructuring.
