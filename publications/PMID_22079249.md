Fibrinogen is a multifunctional plasma protein that plays a crucial role in 
several biological processes. Elevated fibrinogen induces erythrocyte 
hyperaggregation, suggesting an interaction between this protein and red blood 
cells (RBCs). Several studies support the concept that fibrinogen interacts with 
RBC membrane and this binding, due to specific and non-specific mechanisms, may 
be a trigger to RBC hyperaggregation in inflammation. The main goals of our work 
were to prove that human RBCs are able to specifically bind soluble fibrinogen, 
and identify membrane molecular targets that could be involved in this process. 
RBCs were first isolated from blood of healthy individuals and then separated in 
different age fractions by discontinuous Percoll gradients. After isolation RBC 
samples were incubated with human soluble fibrinogen and/or with a blocking 
antibody against CD47 followed by fluorescence confocal microscopy, flow 
cytometry acquisitions and zeta potential measurements. Our data show that 
soluble fibrinogen interacts with the human RBC membrane in an age-dependent 
manner, with younger RBCs interacting more with soluble fibrinogen than the 
older cells. Importantly, this interaction is abrogated in the presence of a 
specific antibody against CD47. Our results support a specific and age-dependent 
interaction of soluble fibrinogen with human RBC membrane; additionally we 
present CD47 as a putative mediator in this process. This interaction may 
contribute to RBC hyperaggregation in inflammation.
