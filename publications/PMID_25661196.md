Cystic Fibrosis (CF) disease is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (CF 
transmembrane conductance regulator). F508 deletion is the most represented 
mutation, and F508del-CFTR is absent of plasma membrane and accumulates into the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment. Using specific Ca2+ genetics cameleon 
probes, we showed in the human bronchial CF epithelial cell line CFBE that ER 
Ca2+ concentration was strongly increased compared to non-CF (16HBE) cells, and 
normalized by the F508del-CFTR corrector agent, VX-809. We also showed that ER 
F508del-CFTR retention increases SERCA (Sarcoplasmic/Reticulum Ca2+ ATPase) pump 
activity whereas PMCA (Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPase) activities were reduced in 
these CF cells compared to corrected CF cells (VX-809) and non-CF cells. We are 
showing for the first time CFTR/SERCA and CFTR/PMCA interactions that are 
modulated in CF cells and could explain part of Ca2+ homeostasis deregulation 
due to mislocalization of F508del-CFTR. Using ER or mitochondria genetics Ca2+ 
probes, we are showing that ER Ca2+ content, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, SERCA 
and PMCA pump, activities are strongly affected by the localization of 
F508del-CFTR protein.
