The purpose of the present work was to identify the catalytic activity of 
AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2, two closely related, putative pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent 
enzymes encoded by vertebrate genomes. The existence of bacterial homologues 
(40-50% identity with AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2) forming bi- or tri-functional 
proteins with a putative kinase belonging to the family of aminoglycoside 
phosphotransferases suggested that AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 acted on phosphorylated 
and aminated compounds. Vertebrate genomes were found to encode a homologue 
(AGPHD1) of these putative bacterial kinases, which was therefore likely to 
phosphorylate an amino compound bearing a hydroxyl group. These and other 
considerations led us to hypothesize that AGPHD1 corresponded to 
5-hydroxy-L-lysine kinase and that AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 catalyzed the 
pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent breakdown of phosphoethanolamine and 
5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine. The three recombinant human proteins were produced 
and purified to homogeneity. AGPHD1 was indeed found to catalyze the 
GTP-dependent phosphorylation of 5-hydroxy-L-lysine. The phosphorylation product 
made by this enzyme was metabolized by AGXT2L2, which converted it to ammonia, 
inorganic phosphate, and 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde. AGXT2L1 catalyzed a 
similar reaction on phosphoethanolamine, converting it to ammonia, inorganic 
phosphate, and acetaldehyde. AGPHD1 and AGXT2L2 are likely to be the mutated 
enzymes in 5-hydroxylysinuria and 5-phosphohydroxylysinuria, respectively. The 
high level of expression of AGXT2L1 in human brain, as well as data in the 
literature linking AGXT2L1 to schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, suggest that 
these diseases may involve a perturbation of brain phosphoethanolamine 
metabolism. AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2, the first ammoniophospholyases to be 
identified, belong to a family of aminotransferases acting on ω-amines.

Abstract

The purpose of the present work was to identify the catalytic activity of AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2, two closely related, putative pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzymes encoded by vertebrate genomes. The existence of bacterial homologues (40–50% identity with AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2) forming bi- or tri-functional proteins with a putative kinase belonging to the family of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases suggested that AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 acted on phosphorylated and aminated compounds. Vertebrate genomes were found to encode a homologue (AGPHD1) of these putative bacterial kinases, which was therefore likely to phosphorylate an amino compound bearing a hydroxyl group. These and other considerations led us to hypothesize that AGPHD1 corresponded to 5-hydroxy- l -lysine kinase and that AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 catalyzed the pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent breakdown of phosphoethanolamine and 5-phosphohydroxy- l -lysine. The three recombinant human proteins were produced and purified to homogeneity. AGPHD1 was indeed found to catalyze the GTP-dependent phosphorylation of 5-hydroxy- l -lysine. The phosphorylation product made by this enzyme was metabolized by AGXT2L2, which converted it to ammonia, inorganic phosphate, and 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde. AGXT2L1 catalyzed a similar reaction on phosphoethanolamine, converting it to ammonia, inorganic phosphate, and acetaldehyde. AGPHD1 and AGXT2L2 are likely to be the mutated enzymes in 5-hydroxylysinuria and 5-phosphohydroxylysinuria, respectively. The high level of expression of AGXT2L1 in human brain, as well as data in the literature linking AGXT2L1 to schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, suggest that these diseases may involve a perturbation of brain phosphoethanolamine metabolism. AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2, the first ammoniophospholyases to be identified, belong to a family of aminotransferases acting on ω-amines.

Introduction

Pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP) 3 -dependent enzymes catalyze a series of reactions, mostly on amino compounds, that include the transfer of amine, the decarboxylation and racemization of amino acids, and β- and γ-elimination reactions on amino acids ( 1 ). A recent review reports more than 50 human enzymes or putative enzymes using PLP as a cofactor ( 2 ). Many of these enzymes have a known function, yet the reaction catalyzed by a few of them is still unknown. This is particularly the case for mammalian AGXT2L1 (AGXT2-like 1) and AGXT2L2 (AGXT2-like 2), two enzymes that share ≈36% sequence identity with mammalian AGXT2 (alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 2). AGXT2 is a member of the aminotransferase III subfamily (as defined in the Pfam database ( 3 )), which mostly comprises enzymes that catalyze transamination on ω-amines. It catalyzes the pyruvate-dependent conversion of d -β-aminoisobutyrate, a breakdown product of thymine, to methylmalonate semialdehyde ( 4 ). Unlike AGXT2, AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 did not act as transaminases ( 5 ).

The purpose of the present work was to identify the function of AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2. We show how bacterial homologues of these proteins, because of their association with a kinase of unknown function (homologous to a protein named AGPHD1), led us to hypothesize that AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 are ammoniophospholyases acting on phosphoethanolamine ( P EtN) and (5 R )-5-phosphohydroxy- l -lysine (5 P Hyl).

P EtN, a component and a precursor of phospholipids, is produced through phosphorylation of free ethanolamine by ethanolamine kinase ( 6 , 7 ), through the breakdown of phosphatidylethanolamine by phospholipase C ( 8 , 9 ), or through aldolytic cleavage of sphinganine-1-phosphate by sphinganine-1-phosphate lyase ( 10 ). P EtN is metabolized by a PLP-dependent enzyme, of unknown molecular identity, that catalyzes the elimination of inorganic phosphate (P i ) and ammonia, leading to the formation of acetaldehyde ( 11 ). Initially described in mammalian tissues, this activity appears to be present also in bacteria, such as Erwinia carotovora (now called Pectobacterium carotovorum var. atrosepticum ) ( 12 ). A distinct PLP-dependent ammoniophospholyase is involved in the breakdown of 5 P Hyl in mammalian tissues, leading to the formation of ammonia, 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde (2-AASA) and P i ( 13 ). 5 P Hyl is produced through the phosphorylation of (5 R )-5-hydroxy- l -lysine (5Hyl), a breakdown product of collagen, by a GTP-dependent kinase ( 14 ). The molecular identity of the kinase and of the ammoniophospholyase that are involved in the metabolism of 5Hyl were unknown before we started this work. We describe here the database searches and the experiments that led us to provide the molecular identification of P EtN phospholyase and of the two enzymes involved in 5Hyl metabolism in mammalian tissues.
