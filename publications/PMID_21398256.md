A number of APETALA2 (AP2)/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) genes have been shown 
to function in abiotic and biotic stress responses, and these genes are often 
induced by multiple stresses. We report here the characterization of an AP2/ERF 
gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that is specifically induced during 
hypoxia. We show that under normoxic conditions, the expression of AtERF73/HRE1 
can be induced by exogenous addition of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 
and that a combination of hypoxia and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 
results in hyperinduction of AtERF73/HRE1 expression. In addition, hypoxic 
induction of AtERF73/HRE1 is reduced but not completely abolished in 
ethylene-insensitive mutants and in the presence of inhibitors of ethylene 
biosynthesis and responses. These results suggest that, in addition to ethylene, 
an ethylene-independent signal is also required to mediate hypoxic induction of 
AtERF73/HRE1. To assess the role of AtERF73/HRE1, we generated three independent 
RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown lines of AtERF73/HRE1. Under normoxic 
conditions, the AtERF73/HRE1-RNAi seedlings displayed increased ethylene 
sensitivity and exaggerated triple responses, indicating that AtERF73/HRE1 might 
play a negative regulatory role in modulating ethylene responses. Gas 
chromatography analyses showed that the production of ethylene was similar 
between wild-type and RNAi lines under hypoxia. Quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that hypoxia-inducible 
genes could be affected by AtERF73/HRE1-RNAi lines in two different ways: 
hypoxic induction of glycolytic and fermentative genes was reduced, whereas 
induction of a number of peroxidase and cytochrome P450 genes was increased. 
Taken together, our results show that AtERF73/HRE1 is involved in modulating 
ethylene responses under both normoxia and hypoxia.

Abstract

A number of APETALA2 ( AP2 )/ ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR ( ERF ) genes have been shown to function in abiotic and biotic stress responses, and these genes are often induced by multiple stresses. We report here the characterization of an AP2 / ERF gene in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) that is specifically induced during hypoxia. We show that under normoxic conditions, the expression of AtERF73 / HRE1 can be induced by exogenous addition of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and that a combination of hypoxia and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid results in hyperinduction of AtERF73 / HRE1 expression. In addition, hypoxic induction of AtERF73 / HRE1 is reduced but not completely abolished in ethylene-insensitive mutants and in the presence of inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and responses. These results suggest that, in addition to ethylene, an ethylene-independent signal is also required to mediate hypoxic induction of AtERF73 / HRE1 . To assess the role of AtERF73 / HRE1 , we generated three independent RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown lines of AtERF73 / HRE1. Under normoxic conditions, the AtERF73 / HRE1 - RNAi seedlings displayed increased ethylene sensitivity and exaggerated triple responses, indicating that AtERF73 / HRE1 might play a negative regulatory role in modulating ethylene responses. Gas chromatography analyses showed that the production of ethylene was similar between wild-type and RNAi lines under hypoxia. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that hypoxia-inducible genes could be affected by AtERF73 / HRE1 - RNAi lines in two different ways: hypoxic induction of glycolytic and fermentative genes was reduced, whereas induction of a number of peroxidase and cytochrome P450 genes was increased. Taken together, our results show that AtERF73 / HRE1 is involved in modulating ethylene responses under both normoxia and hypoxia.
