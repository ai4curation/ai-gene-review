Intestinal cancer is one of the most common human cancers. Aberrant activation 
of the canonical Wnt signaling cascade, for example, caused by adenomatous 
polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations, leads to increased stabilization and 
accumulation of beta-catenin, resulting in initiation of intestinal 
carcinogenesis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has dual roles in regulating 
intracellular protein levels both as a ligand-activated transcription factor and 
as a ligand-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we show that the AhR E3 
ubiquitin ligase has a role in suppression of intestinal carcinogenesis by a 
previously undescribed ligand-dependent beta-catenin degradation pathway that is 
independent of and parallel to the APC system. This function of AhR is activated 
by both xenobiotics and natural AhR ligands, such as indole derivatives that are 
converted from dietary tryptophan and glucosinolates by intestinal microbes, and 
suppresses intestinal tumor development in Apc(Min/+) mice. These findings 
suggest that chemoprevention with naturally-occurring and chemically-designed 
AhR ligands can be used to successfully prevent intestinal cancers.
