Within the brain, the reduced pteridine cofactor 
6R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is absolutely required for the 
synthesis of the monoamine (MA) neurotransmitters dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, 
epinephrine (E), and serotonin (5-HT), the novel gaseous neurotransmitter nitric 
oxide and the production of yet to be identified 1-O-alkylglycerol-derived 
lipids. GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) catalyzes the first and limiting step in 
the BH4 biosynthetic pathway, which is now thought to involve up to eight 
different proteins supporting six alternate de novo and two alternate salvage 
pathways. Gene expression analysis across different regions of the human brain 
shows the abundance of transcripts coding for all eight of these proteins to be 
highly correlated with each other and to be enriched within human MA neurons. 
The potential for multiple routes for BH4 synthesis therefore exists within the 
human brain. GTPCH expression is particularly heterogeneous across different 
populations of human and rodent MA-containing neurons, with low expression 
levels and therefore BH4 being a characteristic of nigrostriatal DA (NSDA) 
neurons. Basic knowledge of how GCH1 gene transcription is controlled within 
NSDA neurons may explain the distinctive susceptibility of these neurons to 
human genetic mutations that result in BH4 deficiency. A model for cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate-dependent GCH1 transcription is described that involves 
a unique combination of DNA regulatory sequences and transcription factors. This 
model proposes that low levels of GCH1 transcription within NSDA neurons are 
driven by their distinctive physiology, suggesting that pharmacological 
manipulation of GCH1 gene transcription can be used to modify BH4 levels and 
therefore DA synthesis in the basal ganglia.
