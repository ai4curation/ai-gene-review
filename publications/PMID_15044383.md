Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia (AOA1) is a neurological disorder with symptoms that 
overlap those of ataxia-telangiectasia, a syndrome characterized by abnormal 
responses to double-strand DNA breaks and genome instability. The gene mutated 
in AOA1, APTX, is predicted to code for a protein called aprataxin that contains 
domains of homology with proteins involved in DNA damage signalling and repair. 
We demonstrate that aprataxin is a nuclear protein, present in both the 
nucleoplasm and the nucleolus. Mutations in the APTX gene destabilize the 
aprataxin protein, and fusion constructs of enhanced green fluorescent protein 
and aprataxin, representing deletions of putative functional domains, generate 
highly unstable products. Cells from AOA1 patients are characterized by enhanced 
sensitivity to agents that cause single-strand breaks in DNA but there is no 
evidence for a gross defect in single-strand break repair. Sensitivity to 
hydrogen peroxide and the resulting genome instability are corrected by 
transfection with full-length aprataxin cDNA. We also demonstrate that aprataxin 
interacts with the repair proteins XRCC1, PARP-1 and p53 and that it 
co-localizes with XRCC1 along charged particle tracks on chromatin. These 
results demonstrate that aprataxin influences the cellular response to genotoxic 
stress very likely by its capacity to interact with a number of proteins 
involved in DNA repair.
