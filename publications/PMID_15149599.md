Cellular senescence can be triggered by telomere shortening as well as a variety 
of stresses and signaling imbalances. We used multiparameter single-cell 
detection methods to investigate upstream signaling pathways and ensuing cell 
cycle checkpoint responses in human fibroblasts. Telomeric foci containing 
multiple DNA damage response factors were assembled in a subset of senescent 
cells and signaled through ATM to p53, upregulating p21 and causing G1 phase 
arrest. Inhibition of ATM expression or activity resulted in cell cycle reentry, 
indicating that stable arrest requires continuous signaling. ATR kinase appears 
to play a minor role in normal cells but in the absence of ATM elicited a 
delayed G2 phase arrest. These pathways do not affect expression of p16, which 
was upregulated in a telomere- and DNA damage-independent manner in a subset of 
cells. Distinct senescence programs can thus progress in parallel, resulting in 
mosaic cultures as well as individual cells responding to multiple signals.
