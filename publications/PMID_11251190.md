The interaction of glutamatergic and dopamine neurotransmission is thought to 
have relevance to both the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. 
For example, subanesthetic doses of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) 
antagonist ketamine induce schizophrenia-like behavioral effects in humans and 
both behavioral and brain metabolic activation in rodents. Blockade of NMDA-R 
results in dopamine release, and antipsychotic drugs that block dopamine 
neurotransmission decrease NMDA-R antagonist-induced behavioral activation. The 
involvement of dopamine receptors in brain metabolic activation induced by 
ketamine is, however, unknown. The present study used D(1A) knockout mice to 
determine the role of dopamine D(1A) receptors in the effects of subanesthetic 
doses of ketamine on both behavioral responses and on alterations in regional 
[14C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake. There was less ketamine-induced behavioral 
activation in D(1A) knockout mice than in wild-type mice. In wild-type mice, 
ketamine (30 mg/kg) induced dramatic increases in 2-DG uptake in limbic cortical 
regions, hippocampal formation, nucleus accumbens, basolateral amygdala, and 
caudal parts of the substantia nigra pars reticulata. D(1A) knockout mice 
exhibited blunted metabolic activation in response to ketamine in a 
neuroanatomically specific manner. The selective D(1) antagonist, SCH23390 (0.3 
mg/kg), inhibited both ketamine-induced brain metabolic activation and 
behavioral responses in the wild-type mice, with a similar neuroanatomical 
specificity observed in the D(1A) knockout mice. Thus, the neuroanatomically 
selective role that D(1A) receptors play in ketamine-induced behavior and 
regional brain metabolic activation in mice provides a useful model for further 
studies of how the D(1A) receptor function may be altered in schizophrenia.
