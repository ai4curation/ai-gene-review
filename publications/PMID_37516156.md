Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, a thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon, frequently 
encounters temperature fluctuations, oxidative stress, and nutrient limitations 
in its environment. Here, we employed a high-throughput transcriptomic analysis 
to examine how the gene expression of S. acidocaldarius changes when exposed to 
high temperatures (92 °C). The data obtained was subsequently validated using 
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Our particular focus 
was on genes that are involved in the heat shock response, type-II 
Toxin-Antitoxin systems, and putative transcription factors. To investigate how 
S. acidocaldarius adapts to multiple stressors, we assessed the expression of 
these selected genes under oxidative and nutrient stresses using qRT-PCR 
analysis. The results demonstrated that the gene thβ encoding the β subunit of 
the thermosome, as well as hsp14 and hsp20, play crucial roles in the majority 
of stress conditions. Furthermore, we observed overexpression of at least eight 
different TA pairs belonging to the type II TA systems under all stress 
conditions. Additionally, four common transcription factors: FadR, TFEβ, CRISPR 
loci binding protein, and HTH family protein were consistently overexpressed 
across all stress conditions, indicating their significant role in managing 
stress. Overall, this work provides the first insight into molecular players 
involved in the cross-stress adaptation of S. acidocaldarius.
