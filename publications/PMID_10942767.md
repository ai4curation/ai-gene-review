Hsp90 is an abundant cytosolic molecular chaperone. It controls the folding of 
target proteins including steroid hormone receptors and kinases in complex with 
several partner proteins. Prominent members of this protein family are large 
peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases), which catalyze the cis/trans 
isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds in proteins and possess chaperone 
activity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two closely related large 
Hsp90-associated PPIases, Cpr6 and Cpr7, exist. We show here that these 
homologous proteins bind with comparable affinity to Hsp90 but exhibit 
significant structural and functional differences. Cpr6 is more stable than Cpr7 
against thermal denaturation and displays an up to 100-fold higher PPIase 
activity. In contrast, the chaperone activity of Cpr6 is much lower than that of 
Cpr7. Based on these results we suggest that the two immunophilins perform 
overlapping but not identical tasks in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle.
