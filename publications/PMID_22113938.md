Deciphering the kinase-substrate relationship is vital for the study of 
phosphorylation network. The use of immobilized proteins on protein chip as the 
library for screening of potential kinase substrates is a tried-and-tested 
method. However, information on phosphorylation sites is lacking and the 
creation of the library with proteins of whole proteome by recombinant 
expression is costly and difficult. In this study, a new solid-phase approach by 
immobilization of proteins from cell lysate onto beads as a protein library for 
kinase substrate screening was developed. It was found that consensus 
phosphorylation sites motif for kinase substrates could be accurately determined 
and hundreds of in vitro kinase substrates and their phosphorylation sites could 
be identified by using this method.
