The p53 tumor suppressor promotes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to 
diverse stress stimuli. p53-mediated cell death depends in large part on 
transcriptional up-regulation of target genes. One of these targets, P53-induced 
protein with a death domain (PIDD), was shown to function as a mediator of 
p53-dependent apoptosis. Here we show that PIDD is a cytoplasmic protein, and 
that PIDD-induced apoptosis and growth suppression in embryonic fibroblasts 
depend on the adaptor protein receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-associated 
ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domain (RAIDD). We provide evidence 
that PIDD-induced cell death is associated with the early activation of 
caspase-2 and later activation of caspase-3 and -7. Our results also show that 
caspase-2(-/-), in contrast to RAIDD(-/-), mouse embryonic fibroblasts, are only 
partially resistant to PIDD. Our findings suggest that caspase-2 contributes to 
PIDD-mediated cell death, but that it is not the sole effector of this pathway.

The p53 tumor suppressor promotes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to diverse stress stimuli. p53-mediated cell death depends in large part on transcriptional up-regulation of target genes. One of these targets, P53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD), was shown to function as a mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis. Here we show that PIDD is a cytoplasmic protein, and that PIDD-induced apoptosis and growth suppression in embryonic fibroblasts depend on the adaptor protein receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-associated ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domain (RAIDD). We provide evidence that PIDD-induced cell death is associated with the early activation of caspase-2 and later activation of caspase-3 and -7. Our results also show that caspase-2-/-, in contrast to RAIDD-/-, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, are only partially resistant to PIDD. Our findings suggest that caspase-2 contributes to PIDD-mediated cell death, but that it is not the sole effector of this pathway.
