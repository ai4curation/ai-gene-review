Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in tumor necrosis factor, 
interleukin-1, and Toll-like receptor pathways requires Lys63-linked 
nondegradative polyubiquitination. A20 is a specific feedback inhibitor of 
NF-kappaB activation in these pathways that possesses dual ubiquitin-editing 
functions. While the N-terminal domain of A20 is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) 
for Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated signaling mediators such as TRAF6 and RIP, 
its C-terminal domain is a ubiquitin ligase (E3) for Lys48-linked degradative 
polyubiquitination of the same substrates. To elucidate the molecular basis for 
the DUB activity of A20, we determined its crystal structure and performed a 
series of biochemical and cell biological studies. The structure reveals the 
potential catalytic mechanism of A20, which may be significantly different from 
papain-like cysteine proteases. Ubiquitin can be docked onto a conserved A20 
surface; this interaction exhibits charge complementarity and no steric clash. 
Surprisingly, A20 does not have specificity for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin 
chains. Instead, it effectively removes Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from 
TRAF6 without dissembling the chains themselves. Our studies suggest that A20 
does not act as a general DUB but has the specificity for particular 
polyubiquitinated substrates to assure its fidelity in regulating NF-kappaB 
activation in the tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and Toll-like receptor 
pathways.
