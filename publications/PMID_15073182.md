The ErbB3/4 ligand heregulin (HRG) profoundly affects cell growth and 
differentiation, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Ebp1, a 
protein isolated by its binding to ErbB3, inhibits cell growth and represses 
transcription of E2F-regulated cell cycle genes. Since Ebp1 shares 38% identity 
with a Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNA-binding protein, we postulated that Ebp1 
could bind E2F consensus elements in an HRG-inducible manner, leading to 
transcriptional repression. We show here that GST-Ebp1 bound to the DNA sequence 
bound by the S. pombe protein. Whereas GST-Ebp1 alone failed to bind E2F1 
promoter elements, Ebp1 contained in nuclear lysates associated with E2F1 
consensus sequences in the E2F1 promoter. Endogenous Ebp1 was recruited to the 
E2F1 promoter in vivo as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. 
Ebp1 bound E2F consensus oligonucleotides in association with E2F1, 
retinoblastoma protein, and HDAC2. HRG regulated the association of Ebp1 with 
E2F promoter sequences and enhanced the ability of Ebp1 to repress 
transcription. Our findings suggest that Ebp1, by linking HRG activation of 
membrane receptors to E2F gene activity, may be a downstream modulator of the 
effects of HRG on cell cycle progression.
