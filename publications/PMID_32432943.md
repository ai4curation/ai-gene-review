SCAP (SREBF chaperone) regulates SREBFs (sterol regulatory element binding 
transcription factors) processing and stability, and, thus, becomes an emerging 
drug target to treat dyslipidemia and fatty liver disease. However, the current 
known SCAP inhibitors, such as oxysterols, induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress and NR1H3/LXRα (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 
3)-SREBF1/SREBP-1 c-mediated hepatic steatosis, which severely limited the 
clinical application of this inhibitor. In this study, we identified a small 
molecule, lycorine, which binds to SCAP, which suppressed the SREBF pathway 
without inducing ER stress or activating NR1H3. Mechanistically, lycorine 
promotes SCAP lysosomal degradation in a macroautophagy/autophagy-independent 
pathway, a mechanism completely distinct from current SCAP inhibitors. 
Furthermore, we determined that SQSTM1 captured SCAP after its exit from the ER. 
The interaction of SCAP and SQSTM1 requires the WD40 domain of SCAP and the TB 
domain of SQSTM1. Interestingly, lycorine triggers the lysosome translocation of 
SCAP independent of autophagy. We termed this novel protein degradation pathway 
as the SQSTM1-mediated autophagy-independent lysosomal degradation (SMAILD) 
pathway. In vivo, lycorine ameliorates high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia, 
hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance in mice. Our study demonstrated that 
the inhibition of SCAP through the SMAILD pathway could be employed as a useful 
therapeutic strategy for treating metabolic diseases.Abbreviation: 25-OHD:

Introduction

The treatment of the metabolic syndrome induced by lipid disorders could potentially be aided by attenuating the synthesis of lipids. The central players in regulating lipid biosynthesis are a group of transcription factors termed SREBF/SREBPs, which includes three isoforms (SREBF1a, SREBF1c, and SREBF2) with distinct but overlapping functions. After synthesis, SREBFs are sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as precursor forms [ 1 , 2 ]. In the presence of cholesterol, SCAP, an ER-to-Golgi transport protein, undergoes a conformational change, and preserves SREBFs in the ER by forming a complex with INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1). When cholesterol level falls, INSIG1 dissociates from the SCAP-SREBFs complex, allowing the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus, where SREBFs are cleaved by MBTPS1 and MBTPS2 [ 3 , 4 ]. The cleaved SREBFs are then translocated to the nucleus and initiate expression of a number of lipogenic genes containing SRE (sterol regulatory element) in their promoters [ 5 ]. In addition to acting as an escort protein for SREBFs, physical association with SCAP seems to stabilize SREBFs. In Scap -deficient CHO cells, both the precursor and the nuclear form of SREBFs disappear. Without SCAP, SREBFs in the ER are unstable and cannot translocate to the Golgi apparatus. In hepatic Scap -deficient mice, all three SREBFs in the nucleus reduced dramatically, leading to an 80% decrease of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis rate in the liver. Consequently, lipid synthesis was reduced to prevent fatty livers in db / db mice and sucrose-fed hamsters [ 6 ]. As SCAP is an indispensable protein for the transport and activation of all three SREBF isoforms, targeting SCAP may be an attractive strategy for the treatment of metabolic diseases.

To date, a series of SCAP inhibitors have been reported, including cholesterol, fatostatin, and betulin [ 7–9 ]. These compounds bind to SCAP and stabilize the SREBFs-SCAP-INSIG1 complex. Oxysterols, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol, 24( S )-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, do not cause SCAP conformational change, but still, elicit SCAP-INSIG1 binding [ 10 ]. As these compounds abrogate the movement of the SCAP-SREBFs complex to the Golgi apparatus, SREBFs activities are inhibited, alleviating the symptoms of metabolic diseases, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance [ 11 ]. However, accumulation of free cholesterol (FC) in the ER activates unfolded/misfolded protein accumulation, thus, increases ER stress and apoptosis [ 12–14 ]. Although sterols bind to SCAP and inhibit SREBFs processing, sterols also activate ER stress signaling, such as the induction of DDIT3/CHOP (DNA damage inducible transcript 3) [ 12 , 15 , 16 ]. Prolonged ER stress induces cardiac myocytes apoptosis [ 17 ], fat accumulation, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [ 18 , 19 ]. Meanwhile, oxysterols also activate NR1H3/LXR (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3) [ 20 ]. On the one hand, the activation of NR1H3 induces reverse cholesterol transport [ 21–25 ], thus, inhibits the development of atherosclerosis in animal models. On the other hand, NR1H3 agonists also increase lipogenesis via SREBF1 c, resulting in hypertriglyceridemia and liver steatosis [ 7 , 22 ]. Hence, ideal SCAP inhibitors should inhibit the SREBF pathway without activating ER stress or NR1H3 to treat atherosclerosis and type-2 diabetes.

In the current study, using AlphaScreen-based cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), we identified lycorine as a small compound that binds to SCAP. Unlike most other SCAP inhibitors, lycorine downregulates the SCAP protein level without changing its transcription. Once SCAP undergoes degradation, SREBFs are released and undergo ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Interestingly, SCAP is transferred to the lysosome for degradation in an autophagy-independent pathway. IP-MS data indicate that this process is mediated by SQSTM1. Compared to sterols, lycorine neither induces ER stress nor activates NR1H3. Lycorine treatment decreased the lipid levels in serum and tissues and increased insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.

Discussion

SCAP plays a central role in regulating lipid homeostasis since it is a prerequisite for the transport and activation of all three SREBF isoforms. Targeting SCAP to suppress SREBFs seems to be an attractive strategy for the treatment of metabolic diseases. In this study, we developed a cell-based screening method (CETSA) to search for SCAP binding molecules. Lycorine was discovered to bind to SCAP and suppressed the SREBF pathway ( Figures 1 and 2 ). Previous known SCAP inhibitors, such as cholesterol and fatostatin, bind to SCAP and promote the interaction between SCAP and INSIG1. Oxysterols bind to INSIG1 to elicit SCAP-INSIG1 binding [ 10 ]. All these molecules lead to the ER retention of the SCAP-SREBF complex. Moderate accumulation of ER luminal proteins triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). When the amount of unfolded protein exceeds the folding capacity of the ER, ER stress is then induced [ 62 , 63 ]. In SCAP KO cells, sterol did not induce ER stress. When SCAP was put back to SCAP KO cells, sterol stimulated ER stress dramatically ( Figure 3H ). Similarly, fatostatin also caused ER stress [ 64 ]. Severe ER stress in hepatocytes and macrophages leads to hepatocyte damage and atherosclerosis. Therefore, targeting SCAP and favoring the ER retention of SCAP-SREBFs complex may not be an ideal strategy to treat metabolic diseases. Unlike previously known SCAP inhibitors, lycorine promoted SCAP degradation ( Figure 3 and S2C-E). However, it did not induce ER stress regardless of the SCAP expression level ( Figures 3G-H and 8D ). Meanwhile, lycorine did not activate NR1H3 ( Figures 2L-M and 8E ). Together, these data suggest that targeting SCAP for degradation might be superior to anchoring SCAP-SREBFs in the ER. The stability of SREBFs depends on SCAP that escorts SREBFs to the Golgi apparatus via COPII vesicles [ 65 ]. When SCAP was degraded in the presence of lycorine, SREBFs underwent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (Fig. S3). Thus, lycorine reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels in vitro and in vivo ( Figures 2H-J , 7 , and 9 ).

In this study, we identified a series of proteins that bind to SCAP (Table S1 and Figure 5C ), most of which have not been reported. The physiological role of these interactions remains largely unknown. Therefore, this information provides a very valuable clue for the further study of SCAP-related functions. SQSTM1 was discovered with the highest enrichment in SCAP pulldown samples after lycorine treatment ( Figure 5B , C ). SQSTM1 binds with LC3 to form late autophagosome [ 66 , 67 ]; however, autophagy is not required for lycorine-triggered SCAP degradation ( Figure 4C-K and S5C-I). Lycorine facilitated SCAP-INSIG1 dissociation and promoted SCAP-SQSTM1 binding ( Figure 5D , E ), then SQSTM1 escorts SCAP to the lysosome for degradation. Distinct from a membrane protein VANGL2 [ 68 ], SCAP binds to SQSTM1 independent of PB1, ZZ, or LIR domain ( Figure 5H-J ). The binding between SREBFs and SQSTM1 got weaker after lycorine treatment ( Figure 5D , E ), suggesting that SREBFs were released from SCAP and then underwent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (Fig. S3). Therefore, we discovered a new route that SQSTM1 transports an ER-Golgi protein to the lysosome for degradation termed SMAILD. Lysosome degrades incoming materials, including organelles, proteins, and lipids. Materials delivered to the lysosome through endocytosis, autophagy, or direct diffusion with the lysosome [ 69 ]. There are three forms of autophagy: eMI, macroautophagy, and CMA. SMAILD is different from these three forms of autophagy. SMAILD pathway has not been discovered before, we think there are two reasons: 1) SMAILD is very similar to and is, thus, very easily mistaken for the autophagic lysosomal degradation process; 2) The occurrence of this process is relatively weak and difficult to detect under normal physiological conditions ( Figure 4G ). Fortunately, lycorine greatly activates SMAILD ( Figure 4G ), making this degradation pathway discoverable. SQSTM1 was first discovered as a selected autophagy receptor [ 70 ]. It co-aggregates with ubiquitinated substrates with its ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and, then, delivers polyubiquitinated cargoes to autophagy via the LIR domain [ 71 ]. Since lycorine did not induce SCAP polyubiquitination, these two domains had no effect on SCAP transport ( Figure 6I , K ). TRAF6 binding domain (TB) was reported to be essential for the forming of the TRAF6-SQSTM1 complex that is necessary for maintaining effective ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 [ 72 ]. In this study, we identified a novel function of the TB domain. It is sufficient and required for SQSTM1 to capture SCAP, leading to the trafficking of SCAP to the lysosome ( Figures 5H-K and 6J,K ). SMAILD pathway happens after SCAP exits from the ER, and most probably in the COPII ER exit sites ( Figure 6A-C and S7). However, there are still many mysteries. For example, how are COPII vesicles escorted to the lysosome? Whether this transportation route is SCAP-specific, or can it be applied to other ER proteins? As SCAP is not ubiquitylated after lycorine treatment (Fig. S4B), are there other post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, that facilitate the trafficking to the lysosome mediated by SQSTM1? Understanding the detailed mechanism that triggers SQSTM1-mediated lysosomal trafficking certainly will broaden our horizon and deepen our knowledge of how different degradation pathways are orchestrated to maintain protein homeostasis that is relevant to human physiology and pathology.

Targeting protein degradation is a powerful tool for drug discovery, especially for those proteins that are “undruggable” using conventional methods. A proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology has been used to initiate selective intracellular proteolysis of unwanted proteins [ 73 , 74 ]. PROTAC protein degrader, ARV-110, has been approved by the FDA for phase I clinical trial. Similarly, lysosome-targeting chimeras (LyTACs) mediates the efficient degradation of APOE, EGFR, CD274/PD-L1, etc [ 75 ]. As SQSTM1 mediates an autophagy-independent lysosomal degradation pathway, this unique function could also be applied for the design of LyTACs.

Statins are the most widely prescribed drugs to treat hypercholesterolemia. As an inhibitor of HMGCR, statin blocks cholesterol biosynthesis. Meanwhile, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver stimulates SREBF, upregulates LDLR, and increases LDL uptake [ 76 ]. Through these two mechanisms, statin effectively reduces the serum cholesterol level. However, statin activates SREBF and raises liver cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes, which lead to adverse effects [ 77 , 78 ]. In comparison, lycorine directly binds to SCAP, inhibits SREBF, and downregulates both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. When mice were fed with equal amounts of lovastatin or lycorine, lycorine showed similar or even better beneficial effects; for instance, lycorine decreased lipid levels to a greater extent than lovastatin in the liver, WAT, and BAT ( Figure 7 ). Moreover, lycorine showed a better effect than lovastatin in improving insulin sensitivity (Fig. S9), since it also decreases fatty acid and TG synthesis besides inhibiting cholesterol synthesis ( Figure 8 ).
