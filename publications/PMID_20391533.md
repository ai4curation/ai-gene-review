MIP-T3 (microtubule-interacting protein associated with TRAF3) is a 
microtubule-interacting protein that evolutionarily conserved from worms to 
humans, but whose cellular functions remains unknown. To get insight into the 
functions of MIP-T3, we set out to identify MIP-T3 interacting proteins by 
immunoprecipitation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and MS analysis. As the 
results, a total of 34 proteins were identified and most of them were novel 
MIP-T3 putative partners. The MIP-T3-associated proteins could be grouped into 
nine clusters based on their molecule functions, including cytoskeleton, 
chaperone, nucleic acid binding, kinase and so on. Three MIP-T3-interacted 
proteins - actin, HSPA8 and tubulin - were further confirmed by reciprocal 
coimmunoprecipitations and colocalization analysis. The interaction of MIP-T3 
with both actin filaments and microtubule suggested that MIP-T3 may play an 
important role in regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics in cells. Our results 
therefore not only uncover a large number of MIP-T3-associated proteins that 
possess a variety of cellular functions, but also provide new research 
directions for the study of the functions of MIP-T3.
