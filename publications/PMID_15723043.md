Misfolded or unassembled polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are 
retro-translocated into the cytosol and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome 
system. We reported previously that the SCF(Fbs1,2) ubiquitin-ligase complexes 
that contribute to ubiquitination of glycoproteins are involved in the 
ER-associated degradation pathway. Here we investigated how the SCF(Fbs1,2) 
complexes interact with unfolded glycoproteins. The SCF(Fbs1) complex was 
associated with p97/VCP AAA ATPase and bound to integrin-beta1, one of the 
SCF(Fbs1) substrates, in the cytosol in a manner dependent on p97 ATPase 
activity. Both Fbs1 and Fbs2 proteins interacted with denatured glycoproteins, 
which were modified with not only high-mannose but also complex-type 
oligosaccharides, more efficiently than native proteins. Given that Fbs proteins 
interact with innermost chitobiose in N-glycans, we propose that Fbs proteins 
distinguish native from unfolded glycoproteins by sensing the exposed chitobiose 
structure.
