The molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms are well known, but how multiple 
clocks within one organism generate a structured rhythmic output remains a 
mystery. Many animals show bimodal activity rhythms with morning (M) and evening 
(E) activity bouts. One long-standing model assumes that two mutually coupled 
oscillators underlie these bouts and show different sensitivities to light. 
Three groups of lateral neurons (LN) and three groups of dorsal neurons govern 
behavioral rhythmicity of Drosophila. Recent data suggest that two groups of the 
LN (the ventral subset of the small LN cells and the dorsal subset of LN cells) 
are plausible candidates for the M and E oscillator, respectively. We provide 
evidence that these neuronal groups respond differently to light and can be 
completely desynchronized from one another by constant light, leading to two 
activity components that free-run with different periods. As expected, a 
long-period component started from the E activity bout. However, a short-period 
component originated not exclusively from the morning peak but more prominently 
from the evening peak. This reveals an interesting deviation from the original 
Pittendrigh and Daan (1976) model and suggests that a subgroup of the ventral 
subset of the small LN acts as "main" oscillator controlling M and E activity 
bouts in Drosophila.
