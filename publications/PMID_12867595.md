activator of transcription 3.

GRIM-19 (gene associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality 19), isolated as a 
cell death activator in a genetic screen used to define mechanisms involved in 
IFN-beta- and retinoic acid-induced cell death, codes for a approximately 16-kDa 
protein that induces apoptosis in a number of cell lines. Antisense ablation of 
GRIM-19 caused resistance to cell death induced by IFN plus retinoic acid and 
conferred a growth advantage to cells. To understand the molecular bases for its 
cell death regulatory activity, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified 
that the transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3) binds to GRIM-19. GRIM-19 inhibits transcription driven by 
activation of STAT3, but not STAT1. It neither inhibits the ligand-induced 
activation of STAT3 nor blocks its ability to bind to DNA. Mutational analysis 
indicates that the transactivation domain of STAT3, especially residue S727, is 
required for GRIM-19 binding. Because GRIM-19 does not bind significantly to 
other STATs, our studies identify a specific inhibitor of STAT3. Because 
constitutively active STAT3 up-regulates antiapoptotic genes to promote tumor 
survival, its inhibition by GRIM-19 also demonstrates an antioncogenic effect 
exerted by biological therapeutics.

GRIM-19 (gene associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality 19), isolated
 as a cell death activator in a genetic screen used to define mechanisms
 involved in IFN-β- and retinoic acid-induced cell death, codes for a
 ≈16-kDa protein that induces apoptosis in a number of cell lines. Antisense
 ablation of GRIM-19 caused resistance to cell death induced by IFN plus
 retinoic acid and conferred a growth advantage to cells. To understand the
 molecular bases for its cell death regulatory activity, we used a yeast
 two-hybrid screen and identified that the transcription factor STAT3 (signal
 transducer and activator of transcription 3) binds to GRIM-19. GRIM-19
 inhibits transcription driven by activation of STAT3, but not STAT1. It
 neither inhibits the ligand-induced activation of STAT3 nor blocks its ability
 to bind to DNA. Mutational analysis indicates that the transactivation domain
 of STAT3, especially residue S727, is required for GRIM-19 binding. Because
 GRIM-19 does not bind significantly to other STATs, our studies identify a
 specific inhibitor of STAT3. Because constitutively active STAT3 up-regulates
 antiapoptotic genes to promote tumor survival, its inhibition by GRIM-19 also
 demonstrates an antioncogenic effect exerted by biological therapeutics.
