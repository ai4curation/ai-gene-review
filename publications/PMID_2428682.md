Mutant sensory cilia in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

Perkins LA, Hedgecock EM, Thomson JN, Culotti JG.

Eight classes of chemosensory neurons in C. elegans fill with fluorescein when 
living animals are placed in a dye solution. Fluorescein enters the neurons 
through their exposed sensory cilia. Mutations in 14 genes prevent dye uptake 
and disrupt chemosensory behaviors. Each of these genes affects the 
ultrastructure of the chemosensory cilia or their accessory cells. In each case, 
the cilia are shorter or less exposed than normal, suggesting that dye contact 
is the principal factor under selection. Ten genes affect many or all of the 
sensory cilia in the head. The daf-19 (m86) mutation eliminates all cilia, 
leaving only occasional centrioles in the dendrites. The cilia in che-13 
(e1805), osm-1 (p808), osm-5 (p813), and osm-6 (p811) mutants have normal 
transition zones and severely shortened axonemes. Doublet-microtubules, attached 
to the membrane by Y links, assemble ectopically proximal to the cilia in these 
mutants. The amphid cilia in che-11 (e1810) are irregular in diameter and 
contain dark ground material in the middle of the axonemes. Certain mechanocilia 
are also affected. The amphid cilia in che-10 (e1809) apparently degenerate, 
leaving dendrites with bulb-shaped endings filled with dark ground material. The 
mechanocilia lack striated rootlets. Cilia defects have also been found in 
che-2, che-3, and daf-10 mutants. The osm-3 (p802) mutation specifically 
eliminates the distal segment of the amphid cilia. Mutations in three genes 
affect sensillar support cells. The che-12 (e1812) mutation eliminates matrix 
material normally secreted by the amphid sheath cell. The che-14 (e1960) 
mutation disrupts the joining of the amphid sheath and socket cells to form the 
receptor channel. A similar defect has been observed in daf-6 mutants. Four 
additional genes affect specific classes of ciliated sensory neurons. The mec-1 
and mec-8 (e398) mutations disrupt the fasciculation of the amphid cilia. The 
cat-6 (e1861) mutation disrupts the tubular bodies of the CEP mechanocilia. A 
cryophilic thermotaxis mutant, ttx-1 (p767), lacks fingers on the AFD dendrite, 
suggesting this neuron is thermosensory.
