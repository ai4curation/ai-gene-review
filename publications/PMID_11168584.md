BACKGROUND: MCM10 is essential for the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous work showed that Mcm10p interacts with the 
Mcm2-7 protein complex that may be functioning as the replication-licensing 
factor. In addition, Mcm10p is required during origin activation and disassembly 
of the prereplicative complex, which allows smooth passage of replication forks.
RESULTS: We show that an mcm10 mutation causes a slow progression of DNA 
synthesis and a loss of chromosome integrity during the S phase and prevents 
entry into mitosis, despite apparent completion of chromosomal DNA replication 
at nonpermissive temperatures. Furthermore, Mcm10p interacts genetically with 
the origin recognition complex (ORC) and various replication elongation factors, 
including a subunit of DNA polymerases epsilon and delta. Mcm10p is an abundant 
protein (approximately 4 x 10(4) copies per haploid cell) that is almost 
exclusively localized in the chromatin and/or nuclear matrix fractions during 
all phases of the cell cycle. When it is visualized by the chromosome-spreading 
method followed by immunostaining, Mcm10p forms punctate foci on chromatin 
throughout the cell cycle and these foci mostly overlap with those of Orc1p, a 
component of ORC.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Mcm10p, like the Mcm2-7 proteins, is a 
critical component of the prereplication chromatin and acts together with ORC 
during the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication; in addition, Mcm10p plays 
an important role during the elongation of DNA replication.
