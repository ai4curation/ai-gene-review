Insertions or deletions (indels) of amino acids residues have been recognized as 
an important source of genetic and structural divergence between paralogous 
Bcl-2 family members. However, these signature sequences have not so far been 
extensively investigated amongst orthologous Bcl-2 family proteins. Bcl2l10 is 
an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that has evolved rapidly throughout 
the vertebrate lineage and which shows conserved abundant expression in eggs and 
oocytes. In this paper, we have unraveled two major sites of divergence between 
human Bcl2l10 and its vertebrate homologs. The first one provides length 
variation at the N-terminus (before the BH4 domain) and the second one is 
located between the predicted α5-α6 pore-forming helices, providing an 
unprecedented case in the superfamily of helix-bundled pore-forming proteins. 
These two particular indels were studied phylogenetically and through 
biochemical and cell biological techniques, including truncation and 
site-directed mutagenesis. While deletion of the N-terminal extension had no 
significant functional impact in HeLa cells, our results suggest that the human 
Bcl2l10 protein evolved a calcium-binding motif in its α5-α6 interhelical region 
by acquiring critical negatively charged residues. Considering the reliance of 
female eggs on calcium-dependent proteins and calcium-regulated processes and 
the exceptional longevity of oocytes in the primate lineage, we propose that 
this microstructural variation may be an adaptive feature associated with high 
maternal expression of this Bcl-2 family member.
