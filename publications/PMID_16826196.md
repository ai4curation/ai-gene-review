Combination of retinoic acids (RAs) and interferons (IFNs) has synergistic 
apoptotic effects and is used in cancer treatment. However, the underlying 
mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial respiratory 
chain (MRC) plays an essential role in the IFN-beta/RA-induced cancer cell 
death. We found that IFN-beta/RA upregulates the expression of MRC complex 
subunits. Mitochondrial-nuclear translocation of these subunits was not 
observed, but overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes loss 
of mitochondrial function, was detected upon IFN-beta/RA treatment. Knockdown of 
GRIM-19 (gene associated with retinoid-interferon-induced mortality-19) and 
NDUFS3 (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 3), two subunits of MRC 
complex I, by siRNA in two cancer cell lines conferred resistance to 
IFN-beta/RA-induced apoptosis and reduced ROS production. In parallel, 
expression of late genes induced by IFN-beta/RA that are directly involved in 
growth inhibition and cell death was also repressed in the knockdown cells. Our 
data suggest that the MRC regulates IFN-beta/RA-induced cell death by modulating 
ROS production and late gene expression.
