A novel splice variant of hPirh2, named hPirh2b, was isolated from human fetal 
liver cDNA library. hPirh2b has a 38-nucleotide deletion and encodes a 188-amino 
acid protein with a truncated RING-H2 domain. It shows no ubiquitin protein 
ligase activity. A low level of expression of hPirh2 was found both at 
transcriptional and translational level in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
when compared to non-cancerous tissue. Statistical analysis showed that the low 
expression is associated with lack of differentiation of HCC. In direct binding 
studies hPirh2b bound p53 indicating that RING-H2 domain is not needed for this 
interaction.
