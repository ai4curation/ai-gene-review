## Abstract

1. Genes Dev. 2000 May 15;14(10):1196-208.

The something about silencing protein, Sas3, is the catalytic subunit of NuA3, a 
yTAF(II)30-containing HAT complex that interacts with the Spt16 subunit of the 
yeast CP (Cdc68/Pob3)-FACT complex.

We have purified and characterized a Gcn5-independent nucleosomal histone H3 HAT 
complex, NuA3 (Nucleosomal Acetyltransferase of histone H3). Peptide sequencing 
of proteins from the purified NuA3 complex identified Sas3 as the catalytic HAT 
subunit of the complex. Sas3 is the yeast homolog of the human MOZ oncogene. 
Sas3 is required for both the HAT activity and the integrity of the NuA3 
complex. In addition, NuA3 contains the TBP- associated factor, yTAF(II)30, 
which is also a component of the TFIID, TFIIF, and SWI/SNF complexes. Sas3 
mediates interaction of the NuA3 complex with Spt16 both in vivo and in vitro. 
Spt16 functions as a component of the yeast CP (Cdc68/Pob3) and mammalian FACT 
(facilitates chromatin transcription) complexes, which are involved in 
transcription elongation and DNA replication. This interaction suggests that the 
NuA3 complex might function in concert with FACT-CP to stimulate transcription 
or replication elongation through nucleosomes by providing a coupled 
acetyltransferase activity.
