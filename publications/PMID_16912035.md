PCSK9 is the ninth member of the proprotein convertase (PC) family. Some of its 
natural mutations have been genetically associated with the development of a 
dominant form of familial hyper- or hypocholesterolemia. The exact mechanism of 
action of PCSK9 is not clear, although it is known to enhance the intracellular 
degradation of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in acidic 
compartments, likely the endosomes/lysosomes. We analyzed the post-translational 
modifications of PCSK9 and show that it is sulfated within its prosegment at 
Tyr38. We also examined the susceptibility of PCSK9 to proteolytic cleavage by 
the other members of the PC family. The data show that the natural 
gain-of-function mutations R218S, F216L, and D374Y associated with 
hypercholesterolemia result in total or partial loss of furin/PC5/6A processing 
at the motif RFHR218 downward arrow. In contrast, the loss-of-function mutations 
A443T and C679X lead either to the lack of trans-Golgi network/recycling 
endosome localization and an enhanced susceptibility to furin cleavage (A443T) 
or to the inability of PCSK9 to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (C679X). 
Furthermore, we report the presence of both native and furin-like cleaved forms 
of PCSK9 in circulating human plasma. Thus, we propose that PCSK9 levels are 
finely regulated by the basic amino acid convertases furin and PC5/6A. The 
latter may reduce the lifetime of this proteinase and its ability to degrade the 
cell-surface LDL receptor, thereby regulating the levels of circulating LDL 
cholesterol.
