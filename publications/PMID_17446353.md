In plants, seasonal changes in day length are perceived in leaves, which 
initiate long-distance signaling that induces flowering at the shoot apex. The 
identity of the long-distance signal has yet to be determined. In Arabidopsis, 
activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) transcription in leaf vascular tissue 
(phloem) induces flowering. We found that FT messenger RNA is required only 
transiently in the leaf. In addition, FT fusion proteins expressed specifically 
in phloem cells move to the apex and move long distances between grafted plants. 
Finally, we provide evidence that FT does not activate an intermediate messenger 
in leaves. We conclude that FT protein acts as a long-distance signal that 
induces Arabidopsis flowering.
