High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein acts as a potent proinflammatory 
cytokine and is involved in the pathogenesis of several vascular diseases, such 
as, systemic vasculitis and sepsis. Emodin-6-O-β-D-glucoside (EG) is a new 
active compound from Reynoutria japonica, and its biologic activities have not 
been previously investigated. In this study, we first investigated the 
antiinflammatory activities of EG on HMGB1-mediated proinflammatory responses in 
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in a murine cecal ligation 
and puncture (CLP)-model of sepsis in mice. EG was found to suppress the release 
of HMGB1, the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and the activation of 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by HMGB1 in HUVECs, and to inhibit HMGB1-mediated 
hyperpermeability and leukocyte migration in mice. In the CLP model, HMGB1 was 
highly released, but this release was prevented by EG. Furthermore, EG also 
increased the survival times of CLP administered mice. Collectively, this study 
shows EG can protect barrier integrity and inhibit HMGB1-mediated inflammatory 
responses, which suggests a potential use as a therapy for sepsis or septic 
shock.
