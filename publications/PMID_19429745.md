Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeast cells can enter mammalian cells and may 
manipulate the host cell environment to favour their own growth and survival. 
Moreover, fibronectin and several other host extracellular matrix proteins are 
recognized by various components of the yeast cell extracts. The present study 
was designed to isolate and characterize a fibronectin-binding protein from P. 
brasiliensis. We also compared P. brasiliensis strain 18, tested before (Pb18a) 
and after (Pb18b) animal passage, in relation to its adhesion and invasion 
processes. Extracts from both samples, when cultured on blood agar solid medium, 
showed higher levels of protein expression than when the same samples were 
cultured on Fava-Netto solid medium, as demonstrated by two-dimensional 
electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE. Also, both Pb18a and Pb18b exhibited stronger 
adhesion to A549 epithelial cells when cultured on blood agar medium than when 
cultured on Fava-Netto medium. Ligand affinity binding assays revealed a protein 
of 54 kDa and pI 5.6 in P. brasiliensis cell-free extracts with the properties 
of a fibronectin-binding adhesin, which was characterized by tryptic digestion 
and mass spectroscopy as a homologue of enolase from P. brasiliensis. Antibody 
raised against this 54 kDa protein abolished 80 % of P. brasiliensis adhesion to 
A549 epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that P. brasiliensis produces a 
fibronectin-binding adhesin, irrespective of the culture medium, and that this 
activity can be inhibited by a specific antibody and is involved in the adhesion 
of the fungus to pulmonary epithelial cells.
