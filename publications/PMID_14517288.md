## Abstract

1. Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Oct;23(20):7177-88. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.20.7177-7188.2003.

Stabilization of urokinase and urokinase receptor mRNAs by HuR is linked to its 
cytoplasmic accumulation induced by activated mitogen-activated protein 
kinase-activated protein kinase 2.

The mRNAs of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor, uPAR, 
contain instability-determining AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3' untranslated 
regions. The cellular proteins binding to these RNA sequences (ARE(uPA/uPAR)) 
are not known. We show here that the mRNA-stabilizing factor HuR functionally 
interacts with these sequences. HuR stabilized an ARE(uPA)-containing RNA 
substrate in vitro and stabilized in HeLa Tet-off cells both endogenous uPA and 
uPAR mRNAs and a beta-globin reporter mRNA containing the ARE(uPA). 
RNAi-mediated depletion of HuR in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells significantly 
reduced the steady-state levels of endogenous uPA and uPAR mRNAs. Furthermore, 
we show that a constitutively active form of mitogen-activated protein 
kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), MK2-EE, has an ARE-mRNA-stabilizing 
effect that correlates with its ability to enhance the cytoplasmic accumulation 
of endogenous HuR, but not in cells cotransfected with a dominant negative 
version of MK2, MK2-K76R. These effects were mimicked by hydrogen peroxide 
treatment (oxidative stress), which resulted in the phosphorylation of 
endogenous MK2. In addition, hydrogen peroxide treatment enhanced the 
cytoplasmic binding of HuR to the ARE(uPA), which was abrogated in cells 
transfected with MK2-K76R. These results indicate a role for HuR and MK2 in 
regulating the expression of uPA and uPAR genes at the posttranscriptional 
level.
