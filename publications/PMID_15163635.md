The Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a contiguous gene syndrome caused by 
chromosomal rearrangements at chromosome band 7q11.23. Several endocrine 
phenotypes, in particular impaired glucose tolerance and silent diabetes, have 
been described for this clinically complex disorder. The WBSCR14 gene, one of 
the genes mapping to the WBS critical region, encodes a member of the 
basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors, which 
dimerizes with the Max-like protein, Mlx. This heterodimeric complex binds and 
activates, in a glucose-dependent manner, carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) 
motifs in the promoter of lipogenic enzymes. We identified five novel 
WBSCR14-interacting proteins, four 14-3-3 isotypes and NIF3L1, which form a 
single polypeptide complex in mammalian cells. Phosphatase treatment abrogates 
the association between WBSCR14 and 14-3-3, as shown previously for multiple 
14-3-3 interactors. WBSCR14 is exported actively from the nucleus through a 
CRM1-dependent mechanism. This translocation is contingent upon the ability to 
bind 14-3-3. Through this mechanism the 14-3-3 isotypes directly affect the 
WBSCR14:Mlx complexes, which activate the transcription of lipogenic genes.
