PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL 1 (PCH1) and PCH1-LIKE (PCHL) were shown to 
directly bind to phytochrome B (phyB) and suppress phyB thermal reversion, 
resulting in plants with dramatically enhanced light sensitivity. Here, we show 
that PCH1 and PCHL also positively regulate various light responses, including 
seed germination, hypocotyl gravitropism, and chlorophyll biosynthesis, by 
physically interacting with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (PIF1) and 
CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1). PCH1 and PCHL interact with PIF1 both in 
the dark and light, and regulate PIF1 abundance. Moreover, PCH1 and PCHL 
facilitate the physical interaction between phyB and PIF1 in vivo to promote the 
light-induced degradation of PIF1. PCH1 and PCHL also inhibit the DNA-binding 
ability of PIF1 to negatively regulate the expressions of PIF1 target genes. In 
addition, PCH1 and PCHL interact with COP1 and undergo degradation through the 
26S proteasome pathway in the dark. Consistently, pch1 suppresses cop1 phenotype 
in darkness. Collectively, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which PCH1 and 
PCHL regulate diverse light responses not only by stabilizing phyB Pfr form but 
also by directly interacting with PIF1 and COP1, providing a molecular 
understanding of the control of hypocotyl growth by these proteins.

INTRODUCTION

Phytochromes (phys) are evolutionarily conserved photoreceptors in bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants ( Rockwell and Lagarias, 2019 ). Phys regulate almost all aspects of plant development and growth, including germination, de-etiolation, shade avoidance, plant defense, floral induction, and senescence ( Casal, 2013 ; Legris et al., 2019 ; Paik and Huq, 2019 ). Phys are red and far-red light photoreceptors that can be photoconverted between two relatively stable forms: the red-light-absorbing inactive Pr form localized in cytoplasm and the far-red-light-absorbing biologically active Pfr form, which migrates into nucleus ( Huq and Quail, 2005 ; Legris et al., 2019 ). In addition to light-induced Pfr / Pr reversion, the active Pfr state can also revert to the inactive Pr state in a light-independent thermal relaxation process referred to as thermal reversion ( Medzihradszky et al., 2013 ; Klose et al., 2020 ). Phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) play a major role in seed plants at the seedling stage. PhyA is required for sensing far-red light and weak light of any wavelength, while phyB is the primary receptor for red light ( Legris et al., 2019 ). The physiological activity of phyB, the primary phytochrome in light-grown and adult plants, is strongly affected by thermal reversion. Increased rates of phyB thermal reversion in Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to high temperature reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool and the size of the associated nuclear bodies under daylight and dark conditions. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and temperature revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals ( Jung et al., 2016 ; Legris et al., 2016 ; Quint et al., 2016 ). Therefore, thermal reversion is an important factor that determines how plants respond to light and temperature.

Within the nucleus, the activated Pfr physically interacts with multiple proteins, including a small group of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors called PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs; PIF1 to PIF8) ( Leivar and Quail, 2011 ; Pham et al., 2018b ; Oh et al., 2019 ). Phytochromes regulate light responses partly by inhibiting these PIFs, which negatively regulate various light responses. PIFs constitutively accumulate in the nucleus in the dark and inhibit photomorphogenesis ( Leivar and Quail, 2011 ; Pham et al., 2018b ; Oh et al., 2019 ). Upon light exposure, the physical interaction between Pfr and PIFs triggers a cascade of events, including light-induced phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of PIFs ( Bauer et al., 2004 ; Shen et al., 2005 ; Paik et al., 2019 ). The removal of PIFs after light exposure results in large-scale changes in gene expression that promote photomorphogenic development ( Leivar et al., 2009 ; Shin et al., 2009 ; Leivar and Monte, 2014 ). Consistently, the reduction in PIF level in the pifq ( pif1 pif3 pif4 pif5 ) quadruple mutant or the overexpression of a truncated form of PIF1 results in photomorphogenic development in the dark ( Leivar et al., 2008 ; Shen et al., 2008 ; Shin et al., 2009 ; Pham et al., 2018c ).

Among the negative regulators in light signaling, COP1 is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that forms multiple complexes with SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 family members (SPA1 to SPA4) ( Deng et al., 1992 ; Lau and Deng, 2012 ; Xu et al., 2015 ). These complexes, either by themselves or by forming CUL4 COP1–SPA E3 ubiquitin ligases, degrade the positively acting transcription factors through the ubiquitin proteasome system to repress photomorphogenesis in the dark ( Chen et al., 2010 ). Therefore, cop1 and spa quadruple-mutant seedlings ( spaq ) exhibit constitutive photomorphogenesis when grown in darkness ( Deng et al., 1992 ; Laubinger et al., 2004 ; Hoecker, 2017 ). In wild-type seedlings grown in the dark, nuclear-localized COP1 ubiquitinates HY5, promoting its degradation ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ; Lau and Deng, 2012 ), whereas light exposure reduces nuclear COP1 to a level that permits the accumulation of HY5 ( Subramanian et al., 2004 ; Pacín et al., 2014 ). Light also represses COP1 activity by activating the photoreceptors phyA, phyB, CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1), and CRY2 to modulate the complex between COP1 and SPA proteins, ultimately leading to HY5 accumulation ( Lian et al., 2011 ; Zuo et al., 2011 ; Lu et al., 2015 ; Sheerin et al., 2015 ). Phytochromes directly interact with SPA proteins and inhibit the function of the COP1/ SPA ubiquitin E3 ligase complex by either disrupting the interaction between COP1 and SPAs, or by promoting the degradation of SPA2 ( Balcerowicz et al., 2011 ; Lu et al., 2015 ; Sheerin et al., 2015 ). In response to light, the inhibition of the COP1/SPA activity by phytochromes results in the accumulation of its target substrates such as ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED 1 (HFR1), and B-BOX ZINC FINGER PROTEINs (BBXs) ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ; Jang et al., 2005 ; Xu et al., 2015 , 2017 ; Pham et al., 2018c ). These, in turn, reprogram gene expression to promote photomorphogenesis.

PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL 1 (PCH1) has been identified as one of the proteins interacting with the light-activated phyB ( Huang et al., 2016 ; Enderle et al., 2017 ). Seedlings lacking functional PCH1 display elongated hypocotyls compared with the wild type under short days. Under these conditions, PCH1 transcript and protein levels peak at dusk, enhancing phyB-dependent inactivation of the growth-promoting transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4). In contrast, PCH1 levels are low toward the end of the night, leading to increased PIF4 activity and hypocotyl growth. Thus, PCH1 has been suggested to integrate clock and light signals through modulation of diurnal phyB activity ( Huang et al., 2016 ). We showed in our previous report that the pch1 pchl double mutant, which lacks functional PCH1 and a homolog, PCH1-LIKE (PCHL), displays strongly accelerated phyB thermal reversion. Moreover, PCH1 and PCHL stabilize phyB in the active state and inhibit phyB thermal reversion. We also showed that PCH1/PCHL accumulates in response to various lights and additional signaling pathways control the expression of PCH1 and PCHL , thereby affecting the activity of phyB ( Enderle et al., 2017 ). Thus, PCH1 and PCHL fine-tuned light signaling by integrating environmental signals to regulate phyB thermal reversion.

Recently, Huang et al. (2019) further provided biochemical and genetic evidence that PCH1 is sufficient to slow down the process of thermal reversion of phyB from Pfr to Pr. They also showed that PCH1 enhances the assembly of phyB into the subnuclear foci known as photobodies, which are positively connected with phyB activity ( Buskirk et al., 2014 ; Klose et al., 2015 ; Huang et al., 2019 ). Using the constitutively active phyB allele phyB Y276H tagged with YFP, they showed that the loss of photobodies in phyB Y276H-YFP pch1 seedlings represses the constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype of phyB Y276H, alleviating the thermo-insensitivity caused by the presence of phyB Y276H, and abolishes the phyB Y276H-mediated light input into the circadian clock of dark-grown seedlings ( Huang et al., 2019 ). Collectively, these data indicate that PCH1 acts as a positive regulator of phyB photobody formation and multiple phyB-controlled physiological processes.

Although it is known that PCH1 and PCHL positively regulate the function of phyB by promoting phyB photobody formation, their relationship and functions in regulating other light-signaling components as well as the mechanism underlying their protein stability have not yet been shown. Here, we show that PCH1 and PCHL positively regulate various light responses, such as seed germination, negative gravitropism, and chlorophyll biosynthesis by directly interacting with PIF1 and COP1. In this process, PCH1 and PCHL inhibit PIF1 function by either directly inhibiting PIF1 DNA binding and/or promoting PIF1 degradation by facilitating the formation of phyB–PIF1 and COP1–PIF1 complexes. Moreover, like other positive components in light signaling, PCH1 and PCHL are also the substrates of COP1 and are targeted for degradation in darkness.

DISCUSSION

In previous reports, PCH1 and PCHL were identified as phyB-interacting proteins that positively regulate phyB signaling by preventing its thermal reversion ( Huang et al., 2016 ; Enderle et al., 2017 ). Recently, it was also shown that PCH1 promotes phyB photobody formation and interacts with phyB’s PASII domain to regulate light, temperature, and circadian signaling pathways ( Huang et al., 2019 ). Here, we provide evidence that PCH1 and PCHL play a broader role in regulating light responses including seed germination, hypocotyl negative gravitropism, and chlorophyll biosynthesis not only by delaying phyB thermal reversion but also by interacting with other light-signaling components, PIFs and COP1. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis that PCH1 and PCHL regulate these pathways by modulating either the stability and/or activity of PIF1, and possibly other PIFs, in a phyB-dependent and -independent manner. By examining the PIF1 protein levels in PCH1 / LOE and pch1 and pchl mutant seeds, we provide molecular evidence that PCH1 and PCHL negatively regulate PIF1 level ( Figure 2A – 2H ). PCH1 and PCHL directly interact with PIF1 and possibly other PIFs and might facilitate the interaction between phyB and PIF1, thereby promoting PIF1 degradation in response to light ( Figure 3 ). Moreover, PCH1/PCHL impaired the DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of PIF1 ( Figure 4A – 4C ). Consistently, the PIF1 target gene expressions were downregulated in PCH1 / LOE and upregulated in pch1 and pchl mutants ( Figure 4D ). Thus, PCH1/PCHL and PIF1 are functioning antagonistically to regulate seed germination, hypocotyl negative gravitropism, and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Finally, we also demonstrate that, like other positive light-signaling regulators, PCH1 and PCHL are ubiquitinated by COP1 and are degraded through 26S proteasome pathway.

Chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis are coordinately regulated in Arabidopsis in response to light to avoid photo-oxidative damage to seedlings upon illumination, and PIFs play a critical role in directly regulating both of these pathways ( Moon et al., 2008 ; Stephenson et al., 2009 ; Toledo-Ortíz et al., 2010 ). It has been demonstrated that PIF1 and PIF3 directly and indirectly regulate the key genes to fine-tune the tetrapyrrole pathway ( Moon et al., 2008 ; Stephenson et al., 2009 ). In these pathways, phyB and PIF1/PIF3 work antagonistically to regulate the greening process of seedlings. However, in our cotyledon greening analyses, PCH1 and PCHL did not promote the greening but instead led to the pale-green cotyledon phenotype, which is probably caused by photobleaching. Here, we provide molecular data that PCH1/PCHL positively regulates the expressions of HEMA1 and GSA2 gene, which are enzymes catalyzing the early stages of chlorophyll biosynthesis ( Supplemental Figure 8 ), while PCH1/PCHL negatively regulates the expression of POR genes that catalyze the final steps of chlorophyll biosynthesis ( Supplemental Figure 9 ). These genes are oppositely regulated by PIF1 and PIF3 ( Moon et al., 2008 ; Stephenson et al., 2009 ), resulting in accumulation of free protochlorophyllide in excess due to an imbalance between the production of protochlorophyllide by HEMA1 and GSA2 , and catabolism of protochlorophyllide by the POR enzymes. Consistent with our hypothesis, PCH1/PCHL shows higher expression levels of antioxidant-related genes including CSD2 , FSD1 , SAPX , and CAT2 compared with the wild type ( Supplemental Figure 10 ). Because PCH1 and PCHL directly interact with PIF1 and other PIFs and regulate PIF1 abundance, it is possible that PCH1/PCHL might also prevent PIF function to fine-tune chlorophyll biosynthesis.

It is well accepted that phytochromes and PIFs have a “Yin–Yang” relationship. In response to light signal, phytochromes interact with PIFs to induce its phosphorylation, polyubiquitination, and subsequent degradation under both red and far-red light conditions ( Leivar and Quail, 2011 ; Pham et al., 2018b ). In our previous reports, we showed that CUL4 COP1–SPA complex functions as a kinase-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for the rapid light-induced degradation of PIF1 and PIF5 ( Zhu et al., 2015 ; Pham et al., 2018b ; Paik et al., 2019 ). Here, we show that PCH1 and PCHL promote PIF1 degradation ( Figure 2 ) and also directly interact with PIF1 to inhibit the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation activity of PIF1 ( Figures 3 and 4 ). Previously, other signaling components were shown to interact with PIFs through the bHLH domain and negatively regulate PIF function. For example, DELLAs and ELF3 interact with PIFs through the bHLH domain and prevent PIFs from binding to DNA ( de Lucas et al., 2008 ; Feng et al., 2008 ; Nieto et al., 2014 ). Thus, PCH1/PCHL might regulate PIFs in multiple ways: (1) under light, PCH1/PCHL facilitates the binding of phyB to PIF1 and increases the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of PIF1 ( Figure 3C ); (2) PCH1/PCHL increases the interaction of PIF1 with COP1–SPA1 complex to mediate PIF1’s polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation under both dark and light conditions ( Supplemental Figure 18 ); and/or (3) PCH1 and PCHL interact with PIF1 to inhibit the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation activities of PIF1 ( Figures 3 and 4 ). While the light-induced degradation of PIF1 is most likely a phyB-dependent process, the physical interaction between PCH and PIF1 along with inhibition of DNA-binding and transcriptional activation activities of PIF1 might be phyB independent.

Biochemical assays showed that PCH1 and PCHL proteins are unstable in the dark and are stabilized in response to light ( Figure 5A ). In 2016, Huang et al. reported that PCH1 is an evening-peaked protein and oscillates during a short-day time course. This is probably because PCH1 and PCHL are stabilized under light conditions and are degraded in the dark as observed in this study. When light is provided for up to 24 h, PCH1 and PCHL gradually accumulate regardless of the internal circadian clock ( Figure 5A ). Under light conditions, PCH1 and PCHL accumulate and act as stabilizers of phyB photobodies and positively regulate phyB-mediated light responses. However, in the dark PCH1 and PCHL are recognized by COP1 and are degraded through the 26S proteasome system ( Figures 5 and 6 ). Many light-signaling components are reported as the substrates of COP1, including the bZIP transcription factor HY5 ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ), the myb transcription factor LAF1 ( Seo et al., 2003 ), the bHLH transcription factor HFR1 ( Duek et al., 2004 ), and others ( Lau and Deng, 2012 ; Xu et al., 2015 ). In general, COP1 interacts with its substrates through the WD40 repeats to mediate their degradation in plants ( Holm and Deng, 1999 ; Holm et al., 2001 ). Our yeast two-hybrid results showed that PCH1 and PCHL do have modest interaction activity with the WD40 domain of COP1 ( Supplemental Figure 16A ). However, PCH1 also showed very high interaction activity with zinc-finger and coiled-coil domain only ( Supplemental Figure 16A ). It is possible that PCH1 has another role(s) in regulating the function of COP1.

Based on our data and those of others, we propose a model that summarizes our findings ( Figure 7 ). In the dark, PCH1 and PCHL are associated with COP1 complex and are being degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway. However, PCH1 and PCHL also interact with PIF1 and regulate PIF1 either by inhibiting the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation activity of PIF1 and/or by inducing its degradation through the COP1–SPA complex, as this complex has been shown to degrade PIFs even in darkness ( Xu et al., 2017 ; Pham et al., 2018a , 2018c ). Under light conditions, PCH1 and PCHL facilitate phyB–PIF1 interaction and accelerate PIF1 degradation through the 26S proteasome system. Taken together, these data provide a novel mechanism by which PCH1 and PCHL fine-tune light responses under continuous light and dark and/or diurnal conditions.
