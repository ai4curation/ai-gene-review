BACKGROUND: Autophagy is a conserved process mediating vacuolar degradation and 
recycling. Autophagy is highly upregulated upon various stresses and is 
essential for cell survival in deleterious conditions. Autophagy defects are 
associated with severe pathologies, whereas unchecked autophagy activity causes 
cell death. Therefore, to support proper cellular homeostasis, the induction and 
amplitude of autophagy activity have to be finely regulated. Transcriptional 
control is a critical, yet largely unexplored, aspect of autophagy regulation. 
In particular, little is known about the signaling pathways modulating the 
expression of autophagy-related genes, and only a few transcriptional regulators 
have been identified as contributing in the control of this process.
RESULTS: We identified Rph1 as a negative regulator of the transcription of 
several ATG genes and a repressor of autophagy induction. Rph1 is a histone 
demethylase protein, but it regulates autophagy independently of its demethylase 
activity. Rim15 mediates the phosphorylation of Rph1 upon nitrogen starvation, 
which causes an inhibition of its function. Preventing Rph1 phosphorylation or 
overexpressing the protein causes a severe block in autophagy induction. A 
similar function of Rph1/KDM4 is seen in mammalian cells, indicating that this 
process is highly conserved.
CONCLUSION: Rph1 maintains autophagy at a low level in nutrient-rich conditions; 
upon nutrient limitation, the inhibition of its activity is a prerequisite to 
the induction of ATG gene transcription and autophagy.
