Platelets are highly reactive cell fragments that adhere to exposed 
extracellular matrix (ECM) and prevent excessive blood loss by forming clots. 
Paradoxically, megakaryocytes, which produce platelets in the bone marrow, 
remain relatively refractory to the ECM-rich environment of the bone marrow 
despite having the same repertoire of receptors as platelets. These include the 
ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif)-containing collagen 
receptor complex, which consists of glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and the Fc receptor 
γ-chain, and the ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition 
motif)-containing receptor G6b-B. We showed that mice lacking G6b-B exhibited 
macrothrombocytopenia (reduced platelet numbers and the presence of enlarged 
platelets) and a susceptibility to bleeding as a result of aberrant platelet 
production and function. Platelet numbers were markedly reduced in 
G6b-B-deficient mice compared to those in wild-type mice because of increased 
platelet turnover. Furthermore, megakaryocytes in G6b-B-deficient mice showed 
enhanced metalloproteinase production, which led to increased shedding of 
cell-surface receptors, including GPVI and GPIbα. In addition, G6b-B-deficient 
megakaryocytes exhibited reduced integrin-mediated functions and defective 
formation of proplatelets, the long filamentous projections from which platelets 
bud off. Together, these findings establish G6b-B as a major inhibitory receptor 
regulating megakaryocyte activation, function, and platelet production.
