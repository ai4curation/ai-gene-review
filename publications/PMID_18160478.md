Phage display screening with fragmented genomic DNA from the animal pathogen 
Pasteurella multocida has identified a gene encoding a putative fibronectin 
binding protein (19). Homologues of this gene (PM1665) are found in all other 
sequenced members of the Pasteurellaceae. Gene PM1665 has been cloned, and the 
protein has been expressed. Recombinant PM1665 protein binds to both soluble and 
immobilized fibronectin and is unique in that it interacts with the 
integrin-binding fibronectin type III (FnIII) repeats FnIII(9-10) and not, as is 
the case for almost all other fibronectin adhesins, to the N-terminal type I 
repeats. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed a complex binding mechanism 
with a K(D) (equilibrium dissociation constant) of 150 nM +/- 70 nM. 
Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the PM1665 protein contains two 
helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motifs, and truncation mutation studies have 
identified the binding site in the protein as a combination of these two HhH 
motifs in conjunction with a conserved amino acid motif, VNINTA. We have shown 
that the PM1665 protein is on the cell surface and that binding of P. multocida 
to fibronectin is almost completely inhibited by anti-PM1665 antiserum. These 
results support the hypothesis that the PM1665 protein is a member of a new 
family of fibronectin binding adhesins that are important in the adhesion of P. 
multocida to fibronectin.

Abstract

Phage display screening with fragmented genomic DNA from the animal pathogen Pasteurella multocida has identified a gene encoding a putative fibronectin binding protein ( 19 ). Homologues of this gene (PM1665) are found in all other sequenced members of the Pasteurellaceae . Gene PM1665 has been cloned, and the protein has been expressed. Recombinant PM1665 protein binds to both soluble and immobilized fibronectin and is unique in that it interacts with the integrin-binding fibronectin type III (FnIII) repeats FnIII 9-10 and not, as is the case for almost all other fibronectin adhesins, to the N-terminal type I repeats. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed a complex binding mechanism with a K D (equilibrium dissociation constant) of 150 nM ± 70 nM. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the PM1665 protein contains two helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motifs, and truncation mutation studies have identified the binding site in the protein as a combination of these two HhH motifs in conjunction with a conserved amino acid motif, VNINTA. We have shown that the PM1665 protein is on the cell surface and that binding of P. multocida to fibronectin is almost completely inhibited by anti-PM1665 antiserum. These results support the hypothesis that the PM1665 protein is a member of a new family of fibronectin binding adhesins that are important in the adhesion of P. multocida to fibronectin.

DISCUSSION

It is clear that most, if not all, bacteria colonizing mammals possess proteins that bind to fibronectin and that many of these proteins act as adhesins ( 25 ). Analysis of the binding site in fibronectin for these proteins has revealed that most bacterial fibronectin binding proteins bind to the N terminus of this host protein. The fibronectin binding proteins of S. aureus and S. pyogenes have received the most attention. These proteins all contain the cell wall-anchoring motif LPX[T,S,A]G and a short positively charged C-terminal intracellular tail. The fibronectin binding site is located in the C-terminal part of the protein, where a varied number of 35 to 40 residue repeats are found. These fibronectin-binding repeats target the N terminus of the fibronectin molecule, binding to FnI modules 1 to 5 ( 26 ). Much less information is available for fibronectin binding proteins of gram-negative bacteria. The only gram-negative fibronectin binding protein to be studied in detail is BBK32 from Borrelia burgdorferi , the causative agent of Lyme disease. Surprisingly, this protein shares many structural and functional similarities with the fibronectin binding proteins of S. aureus and S. pyogenes ( 21 ), suggesting that this is the general mechanism of bacterial binding to fibronectin.

One family of bacteria for which only limited information on bacterial adhesion is available is the Pasteurellaceae , which includes a wide range of pathogens of humans and domesticated animals. To identify novel adhesins in members of the Pasteurellaceae , we have used a phage display screening strategy with fragmented genomic DNA. By panning libraries against human fibronectin we identified a novel gene (PM1665) encoding a putative fibronectin and type I collagen binding protein in P. multocida ( 19 ). Bioinformatics analysis has identified the presence of homologous proteins in all other sequenced members of the Pasteurellaceae . The recently discovered bovine commensal Mannheimia succiniciproducens ( 16 ) has two genes encoding protein homologues.

We cloned the PM1665 gene and expressed the gene as a GST fusion protein. Further analysis of recombinant PM1665 protein revealed that it bound only to fibronectin and not to collagen or a range of other connective tissue macromolecules. These differences in observed binding characteristics between the recombinant protein and the phage-displayed protein are likely due to differences in protein folding and conformation. Fibronectin can exist as a soluble protein in body fluids or as part of the extracellular matrix, in which case it is in an insoluble form. We found that the PM1665 protein bound to both soluble and insoluble fibronectin and to an insoluble form of fibronectin, termed superfibronectin, which mimics the form fibronectin takes within the extracellular matrix. To determine where in fibronectin the PM1665 protein was binding, we made use of commercially available proteolytic fragments of fibronectin. We were surprised to find that the PM1665 protein bound to the 120-kDa central cell binding segment of fibronectin and not to the N-terminal 30- or 45-kDa fragments, to which, as discussed above, most other fibronectin binding proteins bind. The 120-kDa region contains 10 FnIII modules (numbered 2 to 11) and is the site of three established biologically active segments. FnIII 1-2 is important in fibronectin fibril formation, FnIII 4-7 binds to DNA, and FnIII 9-10 binds to integrins ( 10 , 20 ). We have used 9 out of the 10 FnIII modules present in the 120-kDa fragment of fibronectin in binding assays and have concluded that the PM1665 protein binds to FnIII 9-10 , the cell-binding segment of the protein, but not to any other modules or to type III repeats in another connective tissue protein, tenascin. The FnIII 9-10 repeat contains the well-known RGD sequence, which facilitates fibronectin binding to cell surface integrins, such as α 5 β 1 ( 18 ). Addition of very high concentrations of RGD peptides failed to inhibit PM1665 protein binding to fibronectin, and the PM1665 protein failed to bind to these peptides, suggesting that this bacterial protein must interact at a site on FnIII 9-10 that is removed from the RGD sequence, which forms an extended hairpin-like loop emanating from FnIII 10 ( 15 ).

While a number of other bacteria have been reported to bind to fibronectin through the 120-kDa region ( 6 , 11 ), the adhesins involved have not been identified, nor has the binding site in fibronectin been defined. Thus, the PM1665 protein is the first bacterial fibronectin binding protein found to bind to this segment of fibronectin. The nature of the binding site for the PM1665 protein suggests that it must have a novel mechanism of action, either as an adhesin and/or as a cell-modulating protein.

Having established that the PM1665 protein bound to a unique site in fibronectin, the obvious question was whether the protein acted as a bacterial adhesin. Initial studies found that soluble recombinant PM1665 protein could significantly inhibit the binding of P. multocida to insoluble fibronectin. We raised an antiserum to recombinant PM1665 protein in the rabbit and used the IgG fraction to examine the location of this putative adhesin and to see if the antibody could block bacterial binding. Using immunogold labeling of ultrathin sections of P. multocida , it is clear that the PM1665 protein exists on the surface of the bacterium. Furthermore, the antibody was also able to block the binding of P. multocida to fibronectin FnIII 9-10 , indicating a role for the PM1665 protein in the adhesion of P. multocida to fibronectin. There have been a number of studies on the adhesion of P. multocida to porcine respiratory tract cells ( 12 ) and, more recently, to components of the extracellular matrix ( 4 ), but the adhesins utilized by the bacterium have not been characterized in any detail. Dabo and colleagues ( 4 ) identified five outer membrane proteins as putative fibronectin binding proteins by ligand blotting, but none of them correspond to the PM1665 protein on the basis of apparent molecular mass.

The PM1665 protein is an unlikely fibronectin binding protein, as it has homology to the ComEA DNA binding proteins involved in competence development ( 14 , 17 ) and has weakly predicted HhH domains, which have been found to be widespread in non-sequence-specific DNA binding proteins ( 27 ). DNA is a double helix with a pseudo-twofold structure, so there are problems fitting asymmetric proteins into the symmetric DNA helix. One way in which this can be solved is by domain duplication. In most proteins containing HhH motifs, these motifs are arranged in pairs with each pair generating a five-helical (HhH) 2 domain with the two HhH motifs connected by an alpha helix, and this arrangement is believed to display pseudo-twofold symmetry ( 27 ). We have used a combination of truncation mutagenesis and synthetic-peptide synthesis to determine which part of the C terminus of this protein binds to fibronectin. As would be expected of a DNA binding protein, neither of the HhH motifs alone bound to fibronectin. However, a combination of both recombinant HhH motifs also failed to bind to fibronectin. It was only when the C-terminal fragment of the PM1665 protein contained the highly conserved sequence VNINTAS that the recombinant truncation mutant bound with high affinity to fibronectin. The HhH-like motif has been suggested to exist in the sterile alpha motif domain ( 27 ), which is found in protein kinases and GTPases, and has been proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions and not DNA binding ( 24 ). There are also HhH motifs in some DNA glycosylases that have acquired enzymatic activity ( 2 ). Therefore, it is possible that the PM1665 protein represents a fourth function for HhH domains, that of binding to specific extracellular matrix macromolecules. Of course, it must be borne in mind that binding requires the presence of the VNINTAS sequence. This sequence contributes significantly to the binding event, but in the absence of a full structure, it is not possible to hypothesize what the mechanism of binding of the protein is.

In conclusion, we have identified a novel fibronectin binding adhesin in P. multocida that binds with relatively high affinity to the FnIII 9-10 repeats of fibronectin. Homologous genes exist in all other sequenced members of the Pasteurellaceae , suggesting that the protein is important for the survival of this family of bacteria. The finding that these proteins contain two HhH motifs potentially extends the role that this motif plays in biological systems.
