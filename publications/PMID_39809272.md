The minor spliceosome catalyzes excision of U12-dependent introns from 
precursors of eukaryotic messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs). This process is critical 
for many cellular functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain 
elusive. Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of 
the 13-subunit human U11 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) 
complex in apo and substrate-bound forms, revealing the architecture of the U11 
small nuclear RNA (snRNA), five minor spliceosome-specific factors, and the 
mechanism of the U12-type 5' splice site (5'SS) recognition. SNRNP25 and SNRNP35 
specifically recognize U11 snRNA, while PDCD7 bridges SNRNP25 and SNRNP48, 
located at the distal ends of the particle. SNRNP48 and ZMAT5 are positioned 
near the 5' end of U11 snRNA and stabilize binding of the incoming 5'SS. 
Recognition of the U12-type 5'SS is achieved through base-pairing to the 5' end 
of the U11 snRNA and unexpected, non-canonical base-triple interactions with the 
U11 snRNA stem-loop 3. Our structures provide mechanistic insights into 
U12-dependent intron recognition and the evolution of the splicing machinery.
