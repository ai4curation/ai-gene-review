Reactive astrocytes and microglia in Alzheimer's disease surround amyloid 
plaques and secrete proinflammatory cytokines that affect neuronal function. 
Relationship between cytokine signaling and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) 
accumulation is poorly understood. Thus, we generated a novel Swedish 
beta-amyloid precursor protein mutant (APP) transgenic mouse in which the 
interferon (IFN)-gamma receptor type I was knocked out (APP/GRKO). IFN-gamma 
signaling loss in the APP/GRKO mice reduced gliosis and amyloid plaques at 14 
months of age. Aggregated Abeta induced IFN-gamma production from co-culture of 
astrocytes and microglia, and IFN-gamma elicited tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-alpha secretion in wild type (WT) but not GRKO microglia co-cultured with 
astrocytes. Both IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha enhanced Abeta production from 
APP-expressing astrocytes and cortical neurons. TNF-alpha directly stimulated 
beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) expression and enhanced beta-processing of 
APP in astrocytes. The numbers of reactive astrocytes expressing BACE1 were 
increased in APP compared with APP/GRKO mice in both cortex and hippocampus. 
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha activation of WT microglia suppressed Abeta degradation, 
whereas GRKO microglia had no changes. These results support the idea that glial 
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha enhance Abeta deposition through BACE1 expression and 
suppression of Abeta clearance. Taken together, these observations suggest that 
proinflammatory cytokines are directly linked to Alzheimer's disease 
pathogenesis.
