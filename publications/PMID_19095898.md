The perception of pathogen or microbe-associated molecular pattern molecules by 
plants triggers a basal defense response analogous to animal innate immunity and 
is defined partly by the deposition of the glucan polymer callose at the cell 
wall at the site of pathogen contact. Transcriptional and metabolic profiling in 
Arabidopsis mutants, coupled with the monitoring of pathogen-triggered callose 
deposition, have identified major roles in pathogen response for the plant 
hormone ethylene and the secondary metabolite 
4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate. Two genes, PEN2 and PEN3, are also 
necessary for resistance to pathogens and are required for both callose 
deposition and glucosinolate activation, suggesting that the pathogen-triggered 
callose response is required for resistance to microbial pathogens. Our study 
shows that well-studied plant metabolites, previously identified as important in 
avoiding damage by herbivores, are also required as a component of the plant 
defense response against microbial pathogens.

Conclusions

Our study of the MAMP-triggered callose defense response, a classic innate immune response to both adapted and non-adapted pathogens, shows that the essential and ubiquitous compounds glutathione and ascorbate, the transported metal ion cadmium, and the secondary metabolite 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate are all required for callose deposition. We showed that the Flg22-triggered callose response in Arabidopsis seedlings requires the concomitant induction of three pathways: Et- and MYB51-dependent I3G biosynthesis, CYP81F2-dependent 4-methoxylation of I3G, and the PEN2, PCS1, and PEN3-mediated hydrolysis of 4-methoxy-I3G ( Fig. 5 ). The core IGS biosynthetic pathway is under feedback inhibition at the level of MYB51 expression by the accumulation of IGS and IGS hydrolytic products. The defense hormones ABA and MeJA suppress the callose response by antagonizing Et signaling and IGS breakdown, respectively, whereas an SA-dependent pathway can bypass the hydrolytic requirement of PEN2 and PCS1. The role of glucosinolate hydrolysis in insect resistance has been studied for over 100 years. Here we have identified a new role for this metabolic pathway, linking the endogenous hydrolytic products of glucosinolates to MAMP-mediated defense responses as potential signaling molecules. Further exploration of the species and genus-specific effects of these molecules, including their potential role as compounds with direct antimicrobial activity as suggested in the accompanying paper by Bednarek et al . ( 36 ), will be needed to determine their multiple functions in plant-microbe interactions.
