We previously demonstrated that Fe65 protein is one of the ligands of the 
cytoplasmic domain of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Another ligand of 
this molecule was recently identified; it is similar to Fe65, so it was named 
Fe65-like (Fe65L1). Herein we describe the cloning of another Fe65-like cDNA 
(Fe65L2), similar to Fe65 and to Fe65L1, which encodes a protein of approx. 50 
kDa. Its cognate mRNA is expressed in various rat tissues, particularly in brain 
and testis. The three members of the Fe65 protein family share several 
structural and functional characteristics. The primary structures of the three 
proteins can be aligned in three regions corresponding to the protein-protein 
interaction domains of Fe65 [the protein-protein interaction domain containing 
two conserved tryptophan residues and the two phosphotyrosine interaction 
domain/phosphotyrosine binding (PID/PTB) domains], whereas the remaining 
sequences are poorly related. Like Fe65, Fe65L1 and Fe65L2 genes encode two 
different protein isoforms, derived from the alternative splicing of a very 
small exon of only six nucleotides, which results, within the N-terminal PID/PTB 
domain, in the presence or absence of two acidic/basic amino acids. Fe65L2 is 
able to interact, both in vitro and in vivo, with the intracellular domain of 
APP. Also, in the case of APP, another two closely related proteins exist, named 
beta-amyloid precursor-like protein (APLP)1 and APLP2: by using the interaction 
trap procedure we observed that both Fe65 and Fe65L2 interact with APP, APLP1 or 
APLP2, although with different efficiencies.
