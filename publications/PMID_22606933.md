Growth of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan sacculus requires the 
co-ordinated activities of peptidoglycan synthases, hydrolases and cell 
morphogenesis proteins, but the details of these interactions are largely 
unknown. We now show that the Escherichia coli peptidoglycan 
glycosyltrasferase-transpeptidase PBP1A interacts with the cell 
elongation-specific transpeptidase PBP2 in vitro and in the cell. Cells lacking 
PBP1A are thinner and initiate cell division later in the cell cycle. PBP1A 
localizes mainly to the cylindrical wall of the cell, supporting its role in 
cell elongation. Our in vitro peptidoglycan synthesis assays provide novel 
insights into the cooperativity of peptidoglycan synthases with different 
activities. PBP2 stimulates the glycosyltransferase activity of PBP1A, and PBP1A 
and PBP2 cooperate to attach newly synthesized peptidoglycan to sacculi. PBP2 
has peptidoglycan transpeptidase activity in the presence of active PBP1A. Our 
data also provide a possible explanation for the depletion of lipid II 
precursors in penicillin-treated cells.
