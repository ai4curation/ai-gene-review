Bcl-2 family members bearing only the BH3 domain are essential inducers of 
apoptosis. We identified a BH3-only protein, Bmf, and show that its BH3 domain 
is required both for binding to prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and for triggering 
apoptosis. In healthy cells, Bmf is sequestered to myosin V motors by 
association with dynein light chain 2. Certain damage signals, such as loss of 
cell attachment (anoikis), unleash Bmf, allowing it to translocate and bind 
prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins. Thus, at least two mammalian BH3-only proteins, Bmf 
and Bim, function to sense intracellular damage by their localization to 
distinct cytoskeletal structures.
