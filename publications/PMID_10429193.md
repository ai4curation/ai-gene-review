A noncovalently associated complex comprising of CD9, the fibrinogen (Fg) 
receptor alphaIIbbeta3, integrin-associated protein (IAP), and glycoprotein (GP) 
Ib/V/IX complex was isolated from Chaps-solubilized human platelets. The CD9 
complex was immunoprecipitated by mAbs specific for CD9 (mAb7), IAP (BRIC126), 
GPIb (SZ1), GPIX (GR-P), beta3 (AP3) and alphaIIb (C3). Additionally, the 
association between CD9 and alphaIIbbeta3 was demonstrated by ELISA. In this 
system, CD9 did not bind to vitronectin receptor (alphavbeta3) suggesting that 
CD9/alphaIIbbeta3 association was alphaIIb-subunit or alphaIIbbeta3-complex 
dependent. D3, an alphaIIbbeta3-activating mAb that is also an anti-LIBS 
(ligand-induced binding site), immunoprecipitated primarily alphaIIbbeta3 with 
GPIb and IAP. CD9 was not detected in D3 immunoprecipitates. D3 binding induced 
platelet aggregation via direct alphaIIbbeta3 activation and was upregulated by 
the alphaIIbbeta3 antagonist eptifibatide. In contrast, AP3 and C3 exhibited 
neither effect. In addition, D3 also inhibited whole blood clot retraction, in 
contrast to AP3 and C3, suggesting that conformational constraints on 
alphaIIbbeta3 by D3 binding not only influenced the CD9 complex but also 
affected alphaIIbbeta3 post receptor occupancy events. The CD9 complex was 
immunoprecipitated in the presence of eptifibatide, demonstrating that 
alphaIIbbeta3 receptor occupancy was not sufficient to cause complex 
dissociation. CD9 complex isolation was also independent of platelet activation, 
although a twofold increase in the quantity of CD9 complex was seen after 
platelet activation by alpha-thrombin in the presence of CaCl2 compared with 
that present in EDTA. Stirred platelets showed fibrinogen-mediated aggregation 
by alpha-thrombin in the presence of CaCl2 but not with EDTA, suggesting that 
fibrinogen crosslinking of CD9 complexes via alphaIIbbeta3 could be partially 
responsible for this increase. These findings imply that the platelet CD9 
complex is independent of platelet activation although it is dependent upon the 
conformation state of alphaIIbbeta3.
