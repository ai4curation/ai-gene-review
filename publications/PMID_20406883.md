Dictyostelium and human MidA are homologous proteins that belong to a family of 
proteins of unknown function called DUF185. Using yeast two-hybrid screening and 
pull-down experiments, we showed that both proteins interact with the 
mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFS2. Consistent with this, Dictyostelium 
cells lacking MidA showed a specific defect in complex I activity, and knockdown 
of human MidA in HEK293T cells resulted in reduced levels of assembled complex 
I. These results indicate a role for MidA in complex I assembly or stability. A 
structural bioinformatics analysis suggested the presence of a methyltransferase 
domain; this was further supported by site-directed mutagenesis of specific 
residues from the putative catalytic site. Interestingly, this complex I 
deficiency in a Dictyostelium midA(-) mutant causes a complex phenotypic 
outcome, which includes phototaxis and thermotaxis defects. We found that these 
aspects of the phenotype are mediated by a chronic activation of AMPK, revealing 
a possible role of AMPK signaling in complex I cytopathology.
