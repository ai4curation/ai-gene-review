The Caenorhabditis elegans gene laf-1 is critical for both embryonic development 
and sex determination. Laf-1 is thought to promote male cell fates by negatively 
regulating expression of tra-2 in both hermaphrodites and males. We cloned laf-1 
and established that it encodes a putative DEAD-box RNA helicase related to 
Saccharomycescerevisiae Ded1p and Drosophila Vasa. Three sequenced laf-1 
mutations are missense alleles affecting a small region of the protein in or 
near helicase motif III. We demonstrate that the phenotypes resulting from laf-1 
mutations are due to loss or reduction of laf-1 function, and that both laf-1 
and a related helicase vbh-1 function in germline sex determination. Laf-1 mRNA 
is expressed in both males and hermaphrodites and in both the germline and soma 
of hermaphrodites. It is expressed at all developmental stages and is most 
abundant in embryos. LAF-1 is predominantly, if not exclusively, cytoplasmic and 
colocalizes with PGL-1 in P granules of germline precursor cells. Previous 
results suggest that laf-1 functions to negatively regulate expression of the 
sex determination protein TRA-2, and we find that the abundance of TRA-2 is 
modestly elevated in laf-1/+ females. We discuss potential functions of LAF-1 as 
a helicase and its roles in sex determination.

INTRODUCTION

C. elegans sex determination is a highly regulated process during which animals with two sets of autosomes and two X chromosomes (AA XX) develop as self-fertile hermaphrodites, while those with one X chromosome (AA XO) develop as males (reviewed in Zarkower 2006 ; Ellis, Schedl 2007 ). The core sex determination pathway in both somatic and germline cells involves a series of negative regulations among proteins that ultimately specify male or female cell fates ( Fig. 1A ). Stage-specific regulation of tra-2 and fem-3 in the hermaphrodite germ line facilitates production of sperm in the L4 larval stage and oocytes in the adult. Translation of tra-2 mRNA is repressed during the L2 and L3 larval stages, thereby allowing spermatogenesis. Translation of fem-3 mRNA is repressed in adults, thereby causing a switch to oogenesis (reviewed in Puoti, et al 2001 ; Ellis, Schedl 2007 ).

Mutations of laf-1 affect sex determination, and genetic analysis suggests that LAF-1 promotes male cell fates. Laf-1 mutations were isolated as dominant suppressors of fem-3 gain-of-function (gf) alleles ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ). The germ lines of fem-3 ( gf ) XX animals are masculinized, containing excess sperm and no oocytes ( Barton, et al 1987 ). Such animals are sterile, but heterozygosity of laf-1 mutations suppresses the sterility. Laf-1 /+ ; fem-3 ( gf ) animals produce both sperm and oocytes and are self-fertile ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ). In an otherwise wild-type background, 10–30% of laf-1 /+ XX heterozygotes are feminized, producing oocytes but no sperm ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ). A similar percentage of XO animals are partially feminized in both the germ line and soma. These data suggest that wild-type LAF-1 promotes male fates in all tissues.

Previous data suggest that the function of LAF-1 involves repression of tra-2 expression ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ). TRA-2 promotes female fates, and regulation of its expression is critical for normal sexual development in all tissues. Translation of tra-2 mRNA is repressed in the hermaphrodite germ line to allow spermatogenesis ( Doniach 1986 ; Goodwin, et al 1993 ). This repression requires two 28-nucleotide elements termed TGEs ( t ra-2 and G LI e lements) located in the tra-2 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) ( Goodwin, et al 1993 ; Jan, et al 1997 ). Disruption or deletion of these elements, such as in tra-2 ( gf ) mutants, causes excess tra-2 activity and feminizes the hermaphrodite germ line ( Doniach 1986 ; Schedl, Kimble 1988 ). The STAR protein GLD-1 binds to the TGEs and mediates tra-2 repression ( Jan, et al 1999 ) ( Fig. 1B ). Regulation of tra-2 also requires FOG-2, an F-box protein that physically interacts with GLD-1 ( Clifford, et al 2000 ). Expression of fog-2 and gld-1 is restricted to the germ line ( Jones, et al 1996 ; Clifford, et al 2000 ), but tra-2 translation is also regulated in the soma ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ). It unknown what factors mediate repression of tra-2 in the soma, but LAF-1 is a good candidate ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ).

Transport of tra-2 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is regulated. Most C. elegans mRNAs exit the nucleus via a NXF-1-mediated pathway, but tra-2 mRNA export occurs and is regulated by a leptomycin B-sensitive pathway that likely involves CRM-1 ( Segal, et al 2001 ; Kuersten, et al 2004 ) ( Fig. 1B ). Alteration of tra-2 mRNA export such that it exits via the NXF-1-mediated pathway leads to increased levels of TRA-2 protein ( Kuersten, et al 2004 ), suggesting that normal export is needed to establish the translational regulation of tra-2 mRNA described above.

Three lines of evidence suggest that laf-1 regulates tra-2 . First, the phenotypes of laf-1 /+ animals are similar to those of strong tra-2 ( gf ) mutants. Both of these genotypes cause XX animals to develop as females and partially feminize the XO soma and germ line ( Doniach 1986 ; Schedl, Kimble 1988 ; Goodwin, et al 1997 ). Additionally, both tra-2 ( gf ) mutations and laf-1 /+ heterozygosity suppress the germline masculinization of fem-3 ( gf ) mutants ( Barton, et al 1987 ; Goodwin, et al 1997 ). Second, tests of epistasis placed laf-1 upstream of tra-2. Tra-2 ( null ) ; laf-1 /+ double mutants are pseudomales indistinguishable from tra-2 ( null ) single mutants ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ). Third, reporter transgenes carrying the tra-2 3′UTR are misregulated in laf-1 /+ mutants ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ). Transgenes carrying the wild-type tra-2 3′UTR are repressed in wild type but are derepressed in laf-1 /+ mutants. Transgenes that lack the TGEs fail to be repressed in wild type and exhibit no additional derepression in laf-1 /+ heterozygotes, indicating that laf-1 acts through the TGEs ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ). These data suggest that laf-1 acts upstream of tra-2 and inhibits its expression. Feminization of laf-1 /+ heterozygotes may thus result from overexpression of TRA-2.

In addition to its role in sex determination, laf-1 is essential for embryogenesis. Laf-1 heterozygotes are feminized, but laf-1 homozygotes die as embryos or early larvae ( Goodwin, et al 1997 ). The embryonic lethality of laf-1 homozygotes is probably not due to misregulation of tra-2 , as such lethality is not associated with either increased or decreased tra-2 activity. Therefore, laf-1 likely regulates other mRNAs in the embryo or serves another function required for normal development.

This paper describes the molecular analysis of laf-1 and further characterization of its role in sex determination. We demonstrate that laf-1 encodes a putative DEAD-box RNA helicase related to S. cerevisiae Ded1p and Drosophila Vasa. We investigated laf-1 mRNA expression and the sub-cellular localization of LAF-1 protein. Finally, we tested whether TRA-2 expression is increased in laf-1 /+ mutants.
