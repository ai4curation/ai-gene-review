Targeted mice lacking functional EGF or amphiregulin (AR) were derived and bred 
to the TGFalpha-knockout to generate mice lacking various combinations of the 
three ligands. In contrast to EGF receptor (EGFR) knockout mice, triple null 
mice lacking half of the EGFR ligand family were healthy and fertile, indicative 
of overlapping or compensatory functions among EGF family members. Nevertheless, 
pups born to triple null dams frequently died or were runted, suggesting a 
mammary gland defect. Comparison of individual and combinatorial knockouts 
established that specific loss of AR severely stunted ductal outgrowth during 
puberty, consistent with dramatic expression of AR transcripts in normal 
developing ducts. Surprisingly, loss of all three ligands did not significantly 
affect cellular proliferation, apoptosis, or ERK activation within terminal end 
buds. Following pregnancy, most AR single null females, but few triple null 
females could nurse their young, revealing collaborative roles for EGF and 
TGFalpha in mammopoiesis and lactogenesis. In triple null glands, alveoli were 
poorly organized and differentiated, and milk protein gene expression was 
decreased. Additionally, Stat5a activation was frequently reduced in AR single 
and combinatorial nulls in association with impaired lactation. Collectively, 
our results provide genetic confirmation of a requirement for EGFR signaling 
throughout the development of the mouse mammary gland, and reveal 
stage-dependent activities for different EGFR ligands. Finally, the additional 
loss of growth factors from pups nursed by triple null dams further worsened 
their survival and growth, establishing functions for both maternal- and 
neonatal-derived growth factors.
