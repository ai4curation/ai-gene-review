Spindle assembly requires the coordinated action of multiple cellular structures 
to nucleate and organize microtubules in a precise spatiotemporal manner. Among 
them, the contributions of centrosomes, chromosomes, and microtubules have been 
well studied, yet the involvement of membrane-bound organelles remains largely 
elusive. Here, we provide mechanistic evidence for a membrane-based, 
Golgi-derived microtubule assembly pathway in mitosis. Upon mitotic entry, the 
Golgi matrix protein GM130 interacts with importin α via a classical nuclear 
localization signal that recruits importin α to the Golgi membranes. 
Sequestration of importin α by GM130 liberates the spindle assembly factor TPX2, 
which activates Aurora-A kinase and stimulates local microtubule nucleation. 
Upon filament assembly, nascent microtubules are further captured by GM130, thus 
linking Golgi membranes to the spindle. Our results reveal an active role for 
the Golgi in regulating spindle formation to ensure faithful organelle 
inheritance.
