Nucleophosmin (NPM) is an important nucleolar phosphoprotein with pleiotropic 
functions in various cellular processes. In this study, we have further examined 
the largely uncharacterized role of NPM in transcriptional regulation by 
uncovering novel NPM-binding transcriptional factors. Among potential 
interactors, we found that activating protein transcription factor 2 (AP2)alpha 
forms a complex with NPM during retinoic-acid-induced cell differentiation. We 
show that this complex is recruited to the promoters of certain 
retinoic-acid-responsive genes, including NPM itself. Such binding of AP2alpha, 
and consequent recruitment of NPM, is selective and dependent on a consensus 
AP2alpha-binding sequence. Remarkably, suppression of NPM by RNA interference 
alleviates the repression of gene expression mediated by retinoic acid and 
AP2alpha. Our findings further show that, on promoter binding, NPM probably 
exerts its repressive effect by inducing a change in local chromatin structure 
that also engages histone deacetylases. This study unveils a hitherto 
unrecognized transcriptional corepressor function of the NPM protein, and 
highlights a novel mechanism by which NPM regulates cell growth and 
differentiation.
