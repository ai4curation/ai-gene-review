Stanniocalcin is a glycoprotein hormone important in the maintenance of calcium 
and phosphate homeostasis in fish. Two related mammalian stanniocalcin genes, 
STC1 and STC2, were found to be expressed in various tissues as paracrine 
regulators. We have demonstrated the existence of a second stanniocalcin gene in 
fish, designated fish STC2, with only 30% identity to fish STC1. However, 
phylogenetic analysis and comparison of the genomic structure of STC genes in 
vertebrates indicated that STC1 and STC2 genes were probably derived from a 
common ancestor gene. Based on the prominent expression of mammalian STC1 in the 
ovary, we tested STC2 expression in rat ovary and the regulation of STC2 
expression by gonadotropins. Treatment of immature rats with pregnant mare serum 
gonadotropin increased STC2 transcripts, whereas subsequent treatment with human 
chorionic gonadotropin suppressed STC2 expression. Real-time PCR analyses also 
demonstrated that STC2 is expressed mainly in thecal layers. In situ 
hybridization studies also revealed that STC2 is expressed in thecal cell layers 
of antral and preovulatory follicles after gonadotropin stimulation. To 
elucidate the physiological functions of STC2, recombinant human and fish STC2 
proteins were generated and found to be N-glycosylated homodimers. In cultured 
granulosa cells, treatment with human or fish STC2 suppressed FSH-induced 
progesterone, but not estradiol or cAMP, production. The STC2 suppression of 
progesterone production was associated with the inhibition of FSH-induced CYP11A 
and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expression. Thus, STC2 is a functional 
homodimeric glycoprotein, and thecal cell-derived STC2 could play a paracrine 
role during follicular development.
