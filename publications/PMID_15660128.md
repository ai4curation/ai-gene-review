E1 enzymes facilitate conjugation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins 
through adenylation, thioester transfer within E1, and thioester transfer from 
E1 to E2 conjugating proteins. Structures of human heterodimeric 
Sae1/Sae2-Mg.ATP and Sae1/Sae2-SUMO-1-Mg.ATP complexes were determined at 2.2 
and 2.75 A resolution, respectively. Despite the presence of Mg.ATP, the 
Sae1/Sae2-SUMO-1-Mg.ATP structure reveals a substrate complex insomuch as the 
SUMO C-terminus remains unmodified within the adenylation site and 35 A from the 
catalytic cysteine, suggesting that additional changes within the adenylation 
site may be required to facilitate chemistry prior to adenylation and thioester 
transfer. A mechanism for E2 recruitment to E1 is suggested by biochemical and 
genetic data, each of which supports a direct role for the E1 C-terminal 
ubiquitin-like domain for E2 recruitment during conjugation.
