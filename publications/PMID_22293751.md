Mutations in BRCA2 confer an increased risk of cancer development, at least in 
part because the BRCA2 protein is required for the maintenance of genomic 
integrity. Here, we use proteomic profiling to identify APRIN (PDS5B), a 
cohesion-associated protein, as a BRCA2-associated protein. After exposure of 
cells to hydroxyurea or aphidicolin, APRIN and other cohesin components 
associate with BRCA2 in early S-phase. We demonstrate that APRIN expression is 
required for the normal response to DNA-damaging agents, the nuclear 
localisation of RAD51 and BRCA2 and efficient homologous recombination. The 
clinical significance of these findings is indicated by the observation that the 
BRCA2/APRIN interaction is compromised by BRCA2 missense variants of previously 
unknown significance and that APRIN expression levels are associated with 
histological grade in breast cancer and the outcome of breast cancer patients 
treated with DNA-damaging chemotherapy.

Mutations in BRCA2 confer an increased risk of cancer development, at least in part because the BRCA2 protein is required for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here, we use proteomic profiling to identify APRIN (PDS5B), a cohesion-associated protein, as a BRCA2-associated protein. After exposure of cells to hydroxyurea or aphidicolin, APRIN and other cohesin components associate with BRCA2 in early S-phase. We demonstrate that APRIN expression is required for the normal response to DNA-damaging agents, the nuclear localisation of RAD51 and BRCA2 and efficient homologous recombination. The clinical significance of these findings is indicated by the observation that the BRCA2/APRIN interaction is compromised by BRCA2 missense variants of previously unknown significance and that APRIN expression levels are associated with histological grade in breast cancer and the outcome of breast cancer patients treated with DNA-damaging chemotherapy.
