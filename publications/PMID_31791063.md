PURPOSE: Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) limits the xenobiotic entry from the 
systemic blood stream to the eye. RPE surface transporters can be important in 
ocular drug distribution, but it has been unclear whether they are expressed on 
the apical, basal, or both cellular surfaces. In this paper, we provide 
quantitative comparison of apical and basolateral RPE surface proteomes.
METHODS: We separated the apical and basolateral membranes of differentiated 
human fetal RPE (hfRPE) cells by combining apical membrane peeling and sucrose 
density gradient centrifugation. The membrane fractions were analyzed with 
quantitative targeted absolute proteomics (QTAP) and sequential window 
acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) 
to reveal the membrane protein localization on the RPE cell surfaces. We 
quantitated 15 transporters in unfractionated RPE cells and scaled their 
expression to tissue level.
RESULTS: Several proteins involved in visual cycle, cell adhesion, and ion and 
nutrient transport were expressed on the hfRPE plasma membranes. Most drug 
transporters showed similar abundance on both RPE surfaces, whereas large 
neutral amino acids transporter 1 (LAT1), p-glycoprotein (P-gp), and 
monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) showed modest apical enrichment. Many 
solute carriers (SLC) that are potential prodrug targets were present on both 
cellular surfaces, whereas putative sodium-coupled neutral amino acid 
transporter 7 (SNAT7) and riboflavin transporter (RFT3) were enriched on the 
basolateral and sodium- and chloride-dependent neutral and basic amino acid 
transporter (ATB0+) on the apical membrane.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive quantitative information of the RPE surface proteomes 
was reported for the first time. The scientific community can use the data to 
further increase understanding of the RPE functions. In addition, we provide 
insights for transporter protein localization in the human RPE and the 
significance for ocular pharmacokinetics.
