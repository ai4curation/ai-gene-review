Follicular melanocytes in bcl-2(-/-) mice have been reported to turn gray during 
the second hair cycle. Light microscopic analysis revealed that about half of 
bcl-2(-/-) mouse hair shafts had no detectable melanin granules after the second 
hair follicle cycle, but the remaining hair appeared to be pigmented normally. 
After depilation to induce new anagen hair, more than 97% of the hair shafts did 
not have visible melanin granules in bcl-2(-/-) mice, whereas 100% of the hair 
shafts in bcl-2(+/+) mice were pigmented. In bcl-2(+/+) mice, dopa-positive 
melanocytes appeared on day 4 after depilation, whereas bcl-2(-/-) mice 
developed few dopa-positive melanocytes after depilation, as assessed by light 
and electron microscopic observation. bcl-2(-/-) mouse hair in the second hair 
cycle contained about 60-70% less melanin than normal mouse hair, and newly 
generated bcl-2(-/-) mouse hair after depilation contained a level of melanin as 
low as that of albino mouse hair. These observations suggest that the expression 
of bcl-2 might be essential for melanocyte maintenance after the second hair 
cycle.
