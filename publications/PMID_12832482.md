LRP130 (also known as LRPPRC) is an RNA-binding protein that is a constituent of 
postsplicing nuclear RNP complexes associated with mature mRNA. It belongs to a 
growing family of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif-containing proteins, 
several of which have been implicated in organellar RNA metabolism. We show here 
that only a fraction of LRP130 proteins are in nuclei and are directly bound in 
vivo to at least some of the same RNA molecules as the nucleocytoplasmic shuttle 
protein hnRNP A1. The majority of LRP130 proteins are located within 
mitochondria, where they are directly bound to polyadenylated RNAs in vivo. In 
vitro, LRP130 binds preferentially to polypyrimidines. This RNA-binding activity 
maps to a domain in its C-terminal region that does not contain any previously 
described RNA-binding motifs and that contains only 2 of the 11 predicted PPR 
motifs. Therefore, LRP130 is a novel type of RNA-binding protein that associates 
with both nuclear and mitochondrial mRNAs and as such is a potential candidate 
for coordinating nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression. These findings 
provide the first identification of a mammalian protein directly bound to 
mitochondrial RNA in vivo and provide a possible molecular explanation for the 
recently described association of mutations in LRP130 with cytochrome c oxidase 
deficiency in humans.
