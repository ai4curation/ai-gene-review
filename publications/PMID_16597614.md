Control of the regenerative properties of urothelial tissue would greatly aid 
the clinician in the management of urinary tract disease and disorders. 
Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF-10) is a mitogen which is particularly 
promising as a protein therapy for urothelial injury. The spatial synthesis, 
transport, targeting, and mechanistic pathway of FGF-10 and its receptor were 
studied in a human urothelial cell culture model and in fixed sections of lower 
urinary tract tissue. Synthesis of FGF-10 was restricted to mesenchymal 
fibroblasts, and secreted FGF-10 exhibited paracrine transport to two proximal 
sites, transitional epithelium and smooth muscle cell bundles, both of which 
were also the exclusive sites of FGF-10 receptor synthesis. The addition of 
recombinant FGF-10 to quiescent urothelial cells in vitro was sufficient to 
stimulate DNA synthesis. This stimulation was through a pathway independent of 
the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway. Deconvolution, light and 
transmission electron microscopic studies captured FGF-10 and its receptor in 
association with the urothelial cell surface, in cytoplasm, and within nuclei, 
observations that describe the mechanism that transduces the mitogenic signal in 
these tissues. Localization of the FGF-10 receptor to the superficial urothelial 
layer is clinically significant because intravesical administration of FGF-10 
may provide the clinician a means to control the turnover of transitional 
epithelium in bladder disorders such as interstitial cystitis.
