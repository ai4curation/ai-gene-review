We have identified a new class of ribosomal protein (RP) genes that appear to 
have been retrotransposed from X-linked RP genes. Mammalian ribosomes are 
composed of four RNA species and 79 different proteins. Unlike RNA constituents, 
each protein is typically encoded by a single intron- containing gene. Here we 
describe functional autosomal copies of the X-linked human RP genes, which we 
designated RPL10L (ribosomal protein L10-like gene), RPL36AL and RPL39L after 
their progenitors. Because these genes lack introns in their coding regions, 
they were likely retrotransposed from X-linked genes. The identities between the 
retrotransposed genes and the original X-linked genes are 89-95% in their 
nucleotide sequences and 92-99% in their amino acid sequences, respectively. 
Northern blot and PCR analyses revealed that RPL10L and RPL39L are expressed 
only in testis, whereas RPL36AL is ubiquitously expressed. Although the role of 
the autosomal RP genes remains unclear, they may have evolved to compensate for 
the reduced dosage of X-linked RP genes.
