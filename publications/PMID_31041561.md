We previously reported a pathogenic de novo p.R342W mutation in the 
transcriptional corepressor CTBP1 in four independent patients with 
neurodevelopmental disabilities [1]. Here, we report the clinical phenotypes of 
seven additional individuals with the same recurrent de novo CTBP1 mutation. 
Within this cohort, we identified consistent CtBP1-related phenotypes of 
intellectual disability, ataxia, hypotonia, and tooth enamel defects present in 
most patients. The R342W mutation in CtBP1 is located within a region implicated 
in a high affinity-binding cleft for CtBP-interacting proteins. Unbiased 
proteomic analysis demonstrated reduced interaction of several 
chromatin-modifying factors with the CtBP1 W342 mutant. Genome-wide 
transcriptome analysis in human glioblastoma cell lines expressing -CtBP1 R342 
(wt) or W342 mutation revealed changes in the expression profiles of genes 
controlling multiple cellular processes. Patient-derived dermal fibroblasts were 
found to be more sensitive to apoptosis during acute glucose deprivation 
compared to controls. Glucose deprivation strongly activated the BH3-only 
pro-apoptotic gene NOXA, suggesting a link between enhanced cell death and NOXA 
expression in patient fibroblasts. Our results suggest that context-dependent 
relief of transcriptional repression of the CtBP1 mutant W342 allele may 
contribute to deregulation of apoptosis in target tissues of patients leading to 
neurodevelopmental phenotypes.
