Batten disease (juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a recessive 
neurodegenerative disorder of childhood. The gene, CLN3, was recently identified 
and found to encode a novel 438 amino acid protein of unknown function. In order 
to gain insight into the function of the Batten disease protein (CLN3p), we 
investigated its subcellular localization. Protein constructs incorporating 
CLN3p fused to the green fluorescence protein or an eight amino acid peptide tag 
were transiently expressed in fibroblasts, HeLa and COS-7 cells. A juxtanuclear, 
asymmetric localization pattern was observed that correlated with the Golgi 
apparatus in all three cell types. However, a proportion of transiently 
transfected cells exhibited a punctate vesicular distribution throughout the 
cytoplasm in addition to or without the Golgi localization. In order to account 
for localization patterns arising from intracellular protein transport 
disruption due to exaggerated overexpression in transiently transfected cells, 
we isolated a stably transfected cell line expressing only one copy of the CLN3 
-GFP DNA construct. Fluorescence and biochemical analyses using this cell line 
demonstrated that CLN3p is an integral membrane protein that localizes primarily 
in the Golgi apparatus. The functional implications of this finding are 
discussed.
