We provide evidence that copines, members of a ubiquitous family of 
calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins, may represent a universal 
transduction pathway for calcium signaling because we find copines are capable 
of interacting with a wide variety of "target" proteins including MEK1, protein 
phosphatase 5, and the CDC42-regulated kinase, that are themselves components of 
intracellular signaling pathways. The copine target proteins were identified by 
yeast two-hybrid screening and the interactions were verified in vitro using 
purified proteins. In the majority of cases the copine binds to a domain of the 
target protein that is predicted to form a characteristic coiled-coil. A 
consensus sequence for the coiled-coil copine-binding site was derived and found 
to have predictive value for identifying new copine targets. We also show that 
interaction with copines may result in recruitment of target proteins to 
membrane surfaces and regulation of the enzymatic activities of target proteins.
