Integrin Associated Protein (IAP) is a 50-kD membrane protein which copurifies 
with the integrin alpha v beta 3 from placenta and coimmunoprecipitates with 
beta 3 from platelets. IAP also is functionally associated with signal 
transduction from the Leukocyte Response Integrin. Using tryptic peptide 
sequence, human and murine IAP cDNAs have been isolated. The protein has an 
extracellular amino-terminal immunoglobulin domain that binds all monoclonal 
anti-IAP antibodies. The carboxy-terminal region is highly hydrophobic with 
three or five membrane-spanning segments and a short hydrophilic tail. 
Immunofluorescence microscopy suggests that this hydrophilic tail is located on 
the inside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Monoclonal anti-IAP antibody inhibits 
the binding of vitronectin-coated beads to alpha v beta 3 on human 
erythroleukemia cells, and polyclonal anti-IAP recognizes hamster IAP on CHO 
cells and inhibits vitronectin bead binding. When CHO cells are transfected with 
human IAP, monoclonal anti-human antibody completely inhibits vitronectin bead 
binding. These data suggest a model in which ligand binding by alpha v beta 3 is 
regulated by IAP.
