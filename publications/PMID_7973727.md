GADD45 is a ubiquitously expressed mammalian gene that is induced by DNA damage 
and certain other stresses. Like another p53-regulated gene, p21WAF1/CIP1, whose 
product binds to cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk's) and proliferating cell nuclear 
antigen (PCNA), GADD45 has been associated with growth suppression. Gadd45 was 
found to bind to PCNA, a normal component of Cdk complexes and a protein 
involved in DNA replication and repair. Gadd45 stimulated DNA excision repair in 
vitro and inhibited entry of cells into S phase. These results establish GADD45 
as a link between the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair.
