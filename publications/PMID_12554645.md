The budding yeast spindle aligns along the mother- bud axis through interactions 
between cytoplasmic microtubules (CMs) and the cell cortex. Kar9, in complex 
with the EB1-related protein Bim1, mediates contacts of CMs with the cortex of 
the daughter cell, the bud. Here we established a novel series of events that 
target Kar9 to the bud cortex. First, Kar9 binds to spindle pole bodies (SPBs) 
in G(1) of the cell cycle. Secondly, in G(1)/S the yeast Cdk1, Cdc28, associates 
with SPBs and phosphorylates Kar9. Thirdly, Kar9 and Cdc28 then move from the 
SPB to the plus end of CMs directed towards the bud. This movement is dependent 
upon the microtubule motor protein Kip2. Cdc28 activity is required to 
concentrate Kar9 at the plus end of CMs and hence to establish contacts with the 
bud cortex. The Cdc28-regulated localization of Kar9 is therefore an integral 
part of the program that aligns spindles.

Abstract

The budding yeast spindle aligns along the mother– bud axis through interactions between cytoplasmic microtubules (CMs) and the cell cortex. Kar9, in complex with the EB1-related protein Bim1, mediates contacts of CMs with the cortex of the daughter cell, the bud. Here we established a novel series of events that target Kar9 to the bud cortex. First, Kar9 binds to spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in G 1 of the cell cycle. Secondly, in G 1 /S the yeast Cdk1, Cdc28, associates with SPBs and phosphorylates Kar9. Thirdly, Kar9 and Cdc28 then move from the SPB to the plus end of CMs directed towards the bud. This movement is dependent upon the microtubule motor protein Kip2. Cdc28 activity is required to concentrate Kar9 at the plus end of CMs and hence to establish contacts with the bud cortex. The Cdc28-regulated localization of Kar9 is therefore an integral part of the program that aligns spindles.

Introduction

In mammalian cells, the targeting and capture of microtubule plus ends at special sites of the cell cortex are essential for directed cell migration, the alignment of mitotic spindles, axon outgrowth and polarization of T cells towards antigens ( Goode et al ., 2000 ). In budding yeast, cytoplasmic microtubules (CMs) interact with both the cortex of the mother cell and the bud to align the mitotic spindle with the mother–bud axis. Spindle alignment is essential to ensure that the elongation of the anaphase spindle will result in the correct distribution of the duplicated sister chromatids between the two cells. Two pathways establish spindle orientation in yeast. An early pathway involves the protein Kar9, the EB1 homologue Bim1, and a myosin V called Myo2. This pathway orients the spindle with respect to the mother–bud axis and positions the spindle close to the bud neck. Later in the cell cycle, a dynein-dependent pathway translocates the growing spindle through the mother–bud junction (bud neck) into the bud. Each pathway can partially compensate for a failure in the other; however, simultaneous loss of both pathways is lethal ( Miller and Rose, 1998 ; Miller et al ., 1998 ).

The capture of CMs by the bud cortex occurs during the G 1 /S interval of the cell cycle. Kar9 concentrates at the plus ends of CMs that contact the bud neck ( Kusch et al ., 2002 ). Kar9 is linked to microtubules by its association with Bim1 ( Korinek et al ., 2000 ; Lee et al ., 2000 ), a microtubule-binding protein ( Schwartz et al ., 1997 ). Eventually, Myo2 binds to Kar9 and translocates Kar9 with the associated CMs along polarized actin cables into the bud ( Beach et al ., 2000 ; Yin et al ., 2000 ). Later in the cell cycle, Kar9 associates with the bud tip in an actin-dependent manner. Significantly, this later association is not dependent upon microtubules ( Miller et al ., 1999 ).

The spindle pole body (SPB) is the functional equivalent of the mammalian centrosome ( Byers and Goetsch, 1975 ). As such, it is responsible for nucleating and organizing all of the microtubules. The SPB duplicates by a conservative mechanism such that the newly formed SPB assembles next to the pre-existing old SPB from new components in G 1 /S of the cell cycle. The new and old SPBs do not behave in the same way. The old SPB is orientated towards the growing bud. It then translocates into the bud while the newly formed SPB is left behind in the mother cell ( Pereira et al ., 2002 ). The selective orientation of the old SPB towards the bud is dependent upon the presence of CMs and Kar9 ( Pereira et al ., 2002 ) and is regulated by Cdc28–Clb5 [cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) with the S phase cyclin Clb5] ( Segal et al ., 2000 ).

Here we address the molecular basis for the regulation of spindle orientation in budding yeast. We show that Kar9 associates with only the bud-ward-directed SPB. The microtubule motor protein Kip2 is used to translocate this population of Kar9 molecules from the SPB to the plus end of CMs that contact the bud neck in G 1 /S. The Kar9 cargo then associates with the bud neck. This association of Kar9 is regulated by Cdc28–Clb5. Cdc28 co-localizes with Kar9 both at SPBs and at the bud cortex.

Discussion

During asymmetric division of cells of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans and during spindle assembly in budding and fission yeast, the spindle becomes orientated relative to spatial cellular markers ( Schaefer and Knoblich, 2001 ). Therefore, the two sets of CMs, each organized by one of the two SPBs or centrosomes, have to be captured by at least two distinct subdomains of the cell cortex. Cells must have developed mechanisms that ensure that the stable interaction of the two CM sets with the same cortical domain is rare since this would ultimately lead to a mispositioning of the spindle.

A yeast protein that is involved in the differential attachment of CMs to the cell cortex is Kar9. Using GFP–KAR9 , mostly expressed from the Gal1 promoter, Kar9 was localized to the SPB, along CMs, the bud neck and the bud tip ( Miller and Rose, 1998 ; Miller et al., 1999 , 2000 ; Beach et al., 2000 ; Korinek et al., 2000 ; Lee et al., 2000 ; Kusch et al., 2002 ). However, the functional significance of Kar9 at SPBs and CMs, the interdependency of these localizations and their regulation remained unclear. Here we report the identification of a novel mechanism of how Cdc28 and Kar9 are transported from SPB to the bud neck in G 1 /S of the cell cycle. Thereby both proteins ensure the timely correct alignment of the mitotic spindle. Our data are consistent with a model in which Kar9 binds to SPBs in G 1 of the cell cycle (Figure 8 , step 1). Kar9 was always associated with the bud-ward-directed SPB upon spindle formation, suggesting a preferential binding to or stabilization of Kar9 at this SPB. How Kar9 is targeted to only one of the two SPBs is not understood. As one possibility, the CMs that contact the bud cortex first, which are in most cases organized by the old SPB ( Segal et al., 2000 ), modify this SPB to allow the preferential binding of Kar9. Such a mechanism has been proposed for the checkpoint protein Bfa1 ( Pereira et al., 2001 ). Pulling or pushing forces applied via CMs onto the SPB, or molecules, which move from the bud cortex along CMs to the SPB, may modify the SPB to allow Kar9 binding.

In G 1 /S, Cdc28 associates with SPBs (step 2) and Kar9 becomes phosphorylated. Four observations suggest that Cdc28 directly phosphorylates Kar9. First, Cdc28 and Clb5 interacted with Kar9 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Secondly, the in vivo phosphorylation of Kar9 coincides with Cdc28 binding to SPBs. Thirdly, phosphorylation of Kar9 is dependent on Cdc28 activity in vivo . Fourthly, only Cdc28, and not the kinase-dead Cdc28 K40L , was able to phosphorylate recombinant Kar9 in vitro .

Kar9 and Cdc28 then move from the SPB to the plus end of CMs (step 3). The Bim1 and Kar9 dependency of the Cdc28 translocation, complex formation of Bim1 and Kar9 ( Korinek et al., 2000 ; Lee et al., 2000 ; Miller et al., 2000 ) and the similar cell cycle-dependent movement of Cdc28 and Kar9 from the SPB to the bud neck (Figure 5 D and E) are consistent with the notion that a complex of Cdc28 and Kar9 and possibly Bim1 translocates from the SPB to the bud cortex. The movement of Cdc28 and Kar9 was dependent upon the microtubule motor protein Kip2. A role for Kip2 in moving Kar9 to the bud cortex is further supported by the phenotype of Δ kip2 cells. Δ kip2 cells have a similar spindle orientation defect as Δ kar9 cells ( Miller et al., 1998 ). A likely interpretation of these results is that the microtubule-dependent motor Kip2 interacts with a component of the Kar9 complex and directly transports Cdc28 and Kar9 to the plus end of CMs. In this respect, it is interesting that Kar9 and Kip2 interact in the yeast two-hybrid system. Alternatively, Kar9, as is probably the case for the fission yeast cell end marker Tea1 ( Mata and Nurse, 1997 ; Behrens and Nurse, 2002 ), binds to CM plus ends and becomes transported by microtubule growth to the cell cortex. In this case, the defect of Kar9 translocation would be the result of the shorter and less dynamic CMs of Δ kip2 cells ( Huyett et al., 1998 ). We consider this latter possibility less likely since the deletion of KAR3 , which reverses the CM defect of Δ kip2 cells ( Huyett et al., 1998 ), did not restore the transport of Kar9 from the SPB to the bud cortex. In any case, additional studies are required to fully understand the molecular function of Kip2 in Kar9 translocation.

Based on the lethality of Δ kip2 Δ kar9 double mutants, it has been suggested that KIP2 functions together with the dynein-dependent pathway in spindle assembly ( Miller et al., 1998 ). Our data now suggest that Kip2 functions also in the early Kar9-dependent spindle orientation pathway. The role of Kip2 in the early pathway was probably not detected by the genetic assay (viability of Δ kip2 Δ dyn1 double mutant) because of the redundancy of motor protein function in localizing Kar9 to the bud neck. Moreover, not all interactions of Kar9 with the bud cortex are affected in Δ kip2 cells. Binding of Kar9 to the bud tip in mitosis occurs in Δ kip2 cells with equal efficiency to that in wild-type cells ( Miller et al., 1998 ).

Kar9 at CMs plus ends then facilitates the interaction of CM ends with the bud cortex probably through its binding to the actin motor Myo2 (step 4). Myo2 transports the CMs along actin cables towards the bud tip (step 5) ( Yin et al ., 2000 ) where Kar9 becomes anchored to the bud tip ( Miller et al ., 1999 ). Kar9 also binds to the bud tip in the absence of CMs, and this binding is not affected when Cdc28 activity is impaired (Figure 4 F). Thus, the movement of Kar9 from the SPB to the bud cortex is not an absolute necessity for the bud tip localization.

What is the role of Cdc28 at CMs? As discussed above, one target of Cdc28 is likely to be Kar9 itself. Cdc28 may also regulate other proteins involved in Kar9 translocation. For example, Kip2 is separated into multiple bands by SDS–PAGE, which may represent phospho-forms of Kip2 (T.Usui, unpublished data). Cdc28 could regulate the cell cycle-dependent translocation of Kar9 from SPBs to the plus end of CMs. This model is consistent with the observation that Kar9 translocation coincides with Cdc28 binding to SPBs. Moreover, when Cdc28 activity is impaired, Kar9 transport to CMs plus ends is inefficient and hence CMs fail to establish interactions with the bud neck. In addition, Cdc28 could modulate the interaction of Kar9 with Myo2 at the bud cortex ( Yin et al ., 2000 ).

The selective binding of Kar9 to one SPB and its Cdc28-regulated translocation to CM plus ends ensure that only one of the two CM sets is able to establish Kar9–Myo2 contacts with the bud cortex. The other CMs, which are organized by the SPB that stays in the mother cell, do not carry Kar9 and therefore fail to establish stable contacts even if they accidentally touch the bud cortex. Due to the failure to concentrate Kar9 at CM plus ends, the differential binding mechanism is impaired in cdc28-4 Δ clb5 cells. This deficiency of cdc28-4 Δ clb5 cells may contribute to the frequent mis-segregation of the entire nucleus into the bud ( Segal et al., 1998 , 2000 ). Thus, the Cdc28-regulated localization of Kar9 at CMs plus ends is an important part of the program that aligns spindles and prevents chromosome mis-segregation in budding yeast.

Adherens junctions of Drosophila epithelial cells provide a planar cue to orient the mitotic spindle during symmetrical division. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor, which shows limited homology to Kar9, and EB1, the homologue of Bim1, are involved in this orientation ( Bienz, 2001 ). It is therefore likely that, in other organisms also, the capture of Kar9–Bim1-related complexes by the cell cortex contributes to spindle orientation. Moreover, the regulation of APC–EB1 complexes could be similar to budding yeast. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammalian cells, Cdk1 and cyclin B1 also transiently associate with the SPB or centrosome ( Bailly et al., 1989 ; Alfa et al., 1990 ). It will be important to investigate whether in higher eukaryotes APC–EB1 complexes are transported from the centrosome to the cell cortex in a Cdk-regulated manner.
