Interleukin 3 (IL-3) regulates the proliferation and differentiation of 
hematopoietic cells. Although the IL-3 receptor chains lack kinase catalytic 
domains, IL-3 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. To 
investigate the potential role of the JAK family of protein-tyrosine kinases in 
IL-3 signal transduction, we have obtained full-length cDNA clones for murine 
Jak1 and Jak2 protein-tyrosine kinases and prepared antiserum against the 
predicted proteins. Using antisera against Jak2, we demonstrate that IL-3 
stimulation results in the rapid and specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 
and activates its in vitro kinase activity.
