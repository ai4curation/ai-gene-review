Small Rab GTPases are involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking. They 
cycle between cytosolic and membrane-bound forms. These membrane 
association/dissociation are tightly controlled by regulatory proteins. To 
search for proteins interacting with Rab13, a small GTPase associated with 
vesicles in fibroblasts and predominantly with tight junctions in epithelial 
cells, we screened a HeLa two-hybrid cDNA library and isolated a clone encoding 
a protein of 17.4 kDa. This protein, almost identical to the bovine rod cGMP 
phosphodiesterase delta subunit, was named human delta-PDE. The delta-PDE binds 
specifically to Rab13. It exhibits two putative C-terminal sequences necessary 
for the interaction with PDZ (PSD95, Dlg, ZO-1) domains contained in many 
proteins localized to specific plasma membrane microdomains. Immunofluorescence 
microscopic studies revealed that the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-tagged 
delta-PDE is localized in vesicular structures accumulated near the plasma 
membrane in epithelial cells. Deletion of the PDZ binding motifs impair 
VSV-delta-PDE subcellular distribution. Purified recombinant delta-PDE had the 
capacity to dissociate Rab13 from cellular membranes. Our data support the 
proposal that delta-PDE, but not GDP dissociation inhibitor, may serve to 
control the dynamic of the association of Rab13 with cellular membranes.
