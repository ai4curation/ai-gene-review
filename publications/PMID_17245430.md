Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been implicated to exert its tumor suppressive 
function via a small subset of regulatory subunits. In this study, we reported 
that the specific B regulatory subunits of PP2A B56gamma1 and B56gamma3 mediate 
dephosphorylation of p53 at Thr55. Ablation of the B56gamma protein by RNAi, 
which abolishes the Thr55 dephosphorylation in response to DNA damage, reduces 
p53 stabilization, Bax expression and cell apoptosis. To investigate the 
molecular mechanisms, we have shown that the endogenous B56gamma protein level 
and association with p53 increase after DNA damage. Finally, we demonstrate that 
Thr55 dephosphorylation is required for B56gamma3-mediated inhibition of cell 
proliferation and cell transformation. These results suggest a molecular 
mechanism for B56gamma-mediated tumor suppression and provide a potential route 
for regulation of B56gamma-specific PP2A complex function.

Abstract

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been implicated to exert its tumor suppressive function via a small subset of regulatory subunits. In this study, we reported that the specific B regulatory subunits of PP2A B56γ1 and B56γ3 mediate dephosphorylation of p53 at Thr55. Ablation of the B56γ protein by RNAi, which abolishes the Thr55 dephosphorylation in response to DNA damage, reduces p53 stabilization, Bax expression and cell apoptosis. To investigate the molecular mechanisms, we have shown that the endogenous B56γ protein level and association with p53 increase after DNA damage. Finally, we demonstrate that Thr55 dephosphorylation is required for B56γ3-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and cell transformation. These results suggest a molecular mechanism for B56γ-mediated tumor suppression and provide a potential route for regulation of B56γ-specific PP2A complex function.

Introduction

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major cellular serine/threonine phosphatase that plays an important role in balancing phosphorylation signals critical for cell proliferation and differentiation ( Virshup, 2000 ; Schonthal, 2001 ; Van Hoof and Goris, 2003 ; Janssens et al , 2005 ). PP2A consists of a catalytic subunit (C), a scaffolding subunit (A) and a regulatory subunit (B). It exists in mammalian cells as either a core heterodimer (AC) or a heterotrimer (ABC). In general, the catalytic subunit (C) always associates with the scaffolding subunit (A) within the cell. The AC heterodimer can also bind to a B regulatory subunit to form the heterotrimeric holoenzyme. Various B subunits can be categorized into four distinct families on the basis of homology, namely B (B55 or PR55), B′ (B56 or PR61), B″ (PR48/59/72/130) and B′″ (PR93/110). Each of these B families is composed of several isoforms ( Sontag, 2001 ). It is believed that PP2A exercises regulatory flexibility and substrate specificity through the specific association of the core dimer with one of the regulatory B subunits. This characteristic of PP2A contributes to its ability to regulate a multitude of cell functions. The diversity of possible combinations of PP2A subunits that exist as functional holoenzymes also allows this protein to be distinctly regulated.

PP2A functions as a positive and negative regulator of the cell cycle, in the latter capacity potentially acting as a tumor suppressor. The potential tumor suppressive function of PP2A might be achieved by a small subset of PP2A holoenzymes with particular subunit compositions. For example, B56γ3 was found to be involved in cell growth and proliferation control ( Chen et al , 2004 ; Van Hoof and Goris, 2004 ). The PP2A B56γ3 gene belongs to the PP2A B56 family (also called B' or PR61 subunit), which consists of B56α ( PPP2R5A ), B56β ( PPP2R5B ), B56γ ( PPP2R5C ), B56δ ( PPP2R5D ) and B56ɛ ( PPP2R5E ) ( Csortos et al , 1996 ; McCright et al , 1996 ). The PP2A B56γ gene locus resides at 14q32.2 and encodes four differentially spliced forms, PP2A B56γ1, γ2, γ3 and γ4 ( Muneer et al , 2002 ; Ortega-Lazaro and del Mazo, 2003 ). As a phosphatase, PP2A was hypothesized to exert its tumor suppressive function by responding to genotoxic stress and acting as a signal transducer to dephosphorylate proteins involved in cell growth and proliferation. In fact, dephosphorylation of p53 by PP2A was first suggested by the finding that treatment of cells with okadaic acid (OA), a PP1/PP2A phosphatase inhibitor, leads to the hyperphosphorylation of cellular p53 protein ( Yatsunami et al , 1993 ; Zhang et al , 1994 ). More recently, PP2A has been shown to directly dephosphorylate p53 at Ser37 in response to γ irradiation ( Dohoney et al , 2004 ). However, despite the progress in delineating the significance of PP2A in dephosphorylating p53 and in regulating cell growth, the composition, role and regulation of the individual regulatory subunits in these processes remain largely undefined.

p53 functions as a transcriptional factor and induces growth arrest or programmed cell death in response to genotoxic stress ( Vogelstein et al , 2000 ; Sharpless and DePinho, 2002 ). p53 protein stability and activity are modulated mainly through post-translational modifications. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that p53 is phosphorylated at Thr55 by TATA box binding protein-associated factor 1 (TAF1) under normal cellular growth conditions, and this phosphorylation promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of p53 ( Li et al , 2004 ). In response to DNA damage, Thr55 phosphorylation was found to decrease rapidly ( Li et al , 2004 ), which is associated with p53 protein accumulation. This observation inspired us to explore the role of phosphatase(s) in Thr55 dephosphorylation and activation.

In the present study, we report that the inhibition of PP2A activity by OA blocks Thr55 dephosphorylation in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, we identified the specific B regulatory subunit of PP2A B56γ that is associated with p53 in vivo and responsible for Thr55 dephosphorylation. Overexpression of B56γ3 inhibits cell proliferation and cell transformation in a p53-dependent manner. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of the B56γ protein by RNAi reduces DNA damage-induced p53 stabilization, Bax expression and cell apoptosis. To investigate the molecular mechanisms, we have shown that the endogenous B56γ protein level and association with p53 increase after DNA damage. Collectively, our data present the first evidence that the B56γ-containing complexes of PP2A function as tumor suppressors by, at least in part, dephosphorylating p53 at Thr55 and provide insights into the regulation of B56γ- and B56γ-specific PP2A complexes in response to DNA damage.

Discussion

In this study, we show that PP2A dephosphorylates the tumor suppressor p53 at Thr55 in response to DNA damage. Importantly, we identified a specific B regulatory subunit of PP2A, B56γ, which mediates Thr55 dephosphorylation by PP2A and showed that B56γ3 inhibits cell proliferation and transformation in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, we report an induction in B56γ protein level and in the association with p53 in response to DNA damage and provide insights into regulation of B56γ- and B56γ-specific PP2A complexes. The implications of our findings in relation to the tumor suppressive function of PP2A are discussed as follows.
