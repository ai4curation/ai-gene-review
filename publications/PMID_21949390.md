The formation of myelin by Schwann cells (SCs) occurs via a series of 
orchestrated molecular events. We previously used global expression profiling to 
examine peripheral nerve myelination and identified the NAD(+)-dependent 
deacetylase Sir-two-homolog 2 (Sirt2) as a protein likely to be involved in 
myelination. Here, we show that Sirt2 expression in SCs is correlated with that 
of structural myelin components during both developmental myelination and 
remyelination after nerve injury. Transgenic mice lacking or overexpressing 
Sirt2 specifically in SCs show delays in myelin formation. In SCs, we found that 
Sirt2 deacetylates Par-3, a master regulator of cell polarity. The deacetylation 
of Par-3 by Sirt2 decreases the activity of the polarity complex signaling 
component aPKC, thereby regulating myelin formation. These results demonstrate 
that Sirt2 controls an essential polarity pathway in SCs during myelin assembly 
and provide insights into the association between intracellular metabolism and 
SC plasticity.
