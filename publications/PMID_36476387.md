Axon degeneration contributes to the disruption of neuronal circuit function in 
diseased and injured nervous systems. Severed axons degenerate following the 
activation of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, which culminates in 
the activation of SARM1 in mammals to execute the pathological depletion of the 
metabolite NAD+. SARM1 NADase activity is activated by the NAD+ precursor 
nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). In mammals, keeping NMN levels low potently 
preserves axons after injury. However, it remains unclear whether NMN is also a 
key mediator of axon degeneration and dSarm activation in flies. Here, we 
demonstrate that lowering NMN levels in Drosophila through the expression of a 
newly generated prokaryotic NMN-Deamidase (NMN-D) preserves severed axons for 
months and keeps them circuit-integrated for weeks. NMN-D alters the NAD+ 
metabolic flux by lowering NMN, while NAD+ remains unchanged in vivo. Increased 
NMN synthesis by the expression of mouse nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase 
(mNAMPT) leads to faster axon degeneration after injury. We also show that 
NMN-induced activation of dSarm mediates axon degeneration in vivo. Finally, 
NMN-D delays neurodegeneration caused by loss of the sole NMN-consuming and 
NAD+-synthesizing enzyme dNmnat. Our results reveal a critical role for NMN in 
neurodegeneration in the fly, which extends beyond axonal injury. The potent 
neuroprotection by reducing NMN levels is similar to the interference with other 
essential mediators of axon degeneration in Drosophila.
