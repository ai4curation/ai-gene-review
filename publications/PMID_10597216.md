Bcl-2 is the best characterized inhibitor of apoptosis, although the molecular 
basis of this action is not fully understood. Using a protein interaction 
cloning procedure, we identified a human gene designated as bis (mapped to 
chromosome 10q25) that encoded a novel Bcl-2-interacting protein. Bis protein 
showed no significant homology with Bcl-2 family proteins and had no prominent 
functional motif. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Bis interacted 
with Bcl-2 in vivo. DNA transfection experiments indicated that Bis itself 
exerted only weak anti-apoptotic activity, but was synergistic with Bcl-2 in 
preventing Bax-induced and Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that 
Bis is a novel modulator of cellular anti-apoptotic activity that functions 
through its interaction with Bcl-2.
