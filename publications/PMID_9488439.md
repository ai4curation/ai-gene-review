Tcf transcription factors interact with beta-catenin and Armadillo to mediate 
Wnt/Wingless signaling. We now report the characterization of genes encoding two 
murine members of the Tcf family, mTcf-3 and mTcf-4. mTcf-3 mRNA is ubiquitously 
present in embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) mouse embryos but gradually disappears over 
the next 3 to 4 days. mTcf-4 expression occurs first at E10.5 and is restricted 
to di- and mesencephalon and the intestinal epithelium during embryogenesis. The 
mTcf-3 and mTcf-4 proteins bind a canonical Tcf DNA motif and can complex with 
the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin. Overexpression of Wnt-1 in a 
mammary epithelial cell line leads to the formation of a nuclear complex between 
beta-catenin and Tcf proteins and to Tcf reporter gene transcription. These data 
demonstrate a direct link between Wnt stimulation and beta-catenin/Tcf 
transcriptional activation and imply a role for mTcf-3 and -4 in early 
Wnt-driven developmental decisions in the mouse embryo.

Abstract

Tcf transcription factors interact with β-catenin and Armadillo to mediate Wnt/Wingless signaling. We now report the characterization of genes encoding two murine members of the Tcf family, mTcf-3 and mTcf-4. mTcf-3 mRNA is ubiquitously present in embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) mouse embryos but gradually disappears over the next 3 to 4 days. mTcf-4 expression occurs first at E10.5 and is restricted to di- and mesencephalon and the intestinal epithelium during embryogenesis. The mTcf-3 and mTcf-4 proteins bind a canonical Tcf DNA motif and can complex with the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin. Overexpression of Wnt-1 in a mammary epithelial cell line leads to the formation of a nuclear complex between β-catenin and Tcf proteins and to Tcf reporter gene transcription. These data demonstrate a direct link between Wnt stimulation and β-catenin/Tcf transcriptional activation and imply a role for mTcf-3 and -4 in early Wnt-driven developmental decisions in the mouse embryo.

DISCUSSION

This report describes the characterization of two murine members of the Tcf family. Based on their expression profiles and the physical and functional interactions with the Wnt effector β-catenin, mTcf-3 and mTcf-4 are potential candidates to mediate Wnt-driven developmental decisions in the mouse. Taking advantage of the expression of the Tcf genes in Wnt-1-responsive C57MG cells, we provide direct evidence that Wnt-1 stimulation induces the formation of nuclear complexes between Tcf family members and β-catenin, which in turn can activate transcription from Tcf reporter genes.
