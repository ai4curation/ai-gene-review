A critical unresolved issue about the genotoxic stress response is how the 
resulting activation of the p53 tumor suppressor can lead either to cell-cycle 
arrest and DNA repair or to apoptosis. We show here that hematopoietic zinc 
finger (Hzf), a zinc-finger-containing p53 target gene, modulates p53 
transactivation functions in an autoregulatory feedback loop. Hzf is induced by 
p53 and binds to its DNA-binding domain, resulting in preferential 
transactivation of proarrest p53 target genes over its proapoptotic target 
genes. Thus, p53 activation results in cell-cycle arrest in Hzf wild-type MEFs, 
while in Hzf(-/-) MEFs, apoptosis is induced. Exposure of Hzf null mice to 
ionizing radiation resulted in enhanced apoptosis in several organs, as compared 
to in wild-type mice. These findings provide novel insights into the regulation 
of p53 transactivation function and suggest that Hzf functions as a key player 
in regulating cell fate decisions in response to genotoxic stress.

Introduction

p53 is an important component of pathways mediating cellular response to genotoxic stress by inducing the transcription of a variety of genes that regulate diverse cellular processes including cell cycle progression, apoptosis and genomic stability ( Harris and Levine, 2005 ; Vogelstein et al., 2000 ; Vousden and Lu, 2002 ). However little is known about the mechanism(s) that determines which sets of target genes i.e. cell cycle arrest genes like p21 ( El-Deiry et al., 1993 ), 14-3-3σ ( Hermeking et al., 1997 ) or pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax ( Miyashita and Reed, 1995 ), Noxa ( Oda et al., 2000 ; Villunger et al., 2003 ), Pidd ( Lin et al., 2000 ), Puma ( Nakano and Vousden, 2001 ; Villunger et al., 2003 ), Perp ( Attardi et al., 2000 ) etc. are transactivated by p53 under a specific condition. p53 is a transcription factor that plays a central role in cellular responses to genotoxic stress like DNA damage, hypoxia, oncogene activation etc ( Harris and Levine, 2005 ; Laptenko and Prives, 2006 ). In order to perform its cellular functions p53 must rapidly accumulate in response to these stressful conditions, as its basal level is very low. Activation of p53 has two major outcomes: cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Cell cycle arrest allows DNA repair to take place before replication occurs thereby maintaining genomic integrity. On the other hand apoptosis results in elimination of irreparably damaged cells.

The regulation of p53 is usually achieved by post-translational modifications and through its interactions with various other proteins ( Lavin and Gueven, 2006 ). p53 undergoes phosphorylations on numerous serine residues both in N-and C-terminal regions ( Lavin and Gueven, 2006 ). The N-terminal phosphorylations inhibit its interactions with its negative regulator MDM2 ( Canman et al., 1998 ; Chehab et al., 2000 ; Khosravi et al., 1999 ) while the C-terminal phosphorylations are thought to enhance the sequence specific DNA binding ability of p53 by inducing a conformational change ( Hupp et al., 1992 ; Wang and Prives, 1995 ). Similarly, other modifications like ubiquitination, acetylation, and sumolation also affect its proteolytic turnover and sequence specific DNA binding ability ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ; Rodriguez et al., 1999 ). This can also be achieved by its interaction with cellular proteins such as Pin-1, ASPP family etc ( Braithwaite et al., 2006 ). When Pin-1 binds to p53, it undergoes conformational change which enhances its transactivation ability ( Zacchi et al., 2002 ; Zheng et al., 2002 ). Recently, a new family of proteins, known as ASPPs, were found to be potent activators of p53, providing an important insight into how p53 responds to apoptotic signals ( Trigiante and Lu, 2006 ). The ASPP family consists of three members –ASPP1, ASPP2, and iASPP. ASPP1 and ASPP2 interact with p53 and specifically enhance p53-induced apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest while iASPP binds and inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis ( Bergamaschi et al., 2006 ; Samuels-Lev et al., 2001 ).

While studying the genome-wide transcriptional response to p53 induction we found that one of the genes upregulated was the hematopoietic zinc finger gene ( Hzf ). Hzf was originally identified as a gene induced in hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from differentiating embryonic stem cells ( Hidaka et al., 2000 ). It encodes a zinc finger protein of 366 amino acids. It has three C 2 H 2 -type zinc finger domains. The zinc finger domains in Hzf are widely spaced with long linker regions connecting the fingers as a consequence of which it cannot form any stable nucleic acid-protein complex ( Sharma et al., 2004 ). Recently, it was reported that Hzf is a direct transcriptional target of p53, which plays a role in p53-mediated cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage in NIH 3T3 cells ( Sugimoto et al., 2006 ). We found that Hzf is unique among the different p53 transcriptional targets in that upon induction by p53 or DNA damage, it binds to the p53 DNA binding domain and modulates its transactivation function in an autoregulatory feedback loop. We further investigated the role of Hzf in the p53-mediated DNA damage response. Here, we show that when Hzf binds to p53, it is preferentially recruited to the promoters of its pro-cell cycle arrest target genes rather than its pro-apoptotic target genes. Thus, in presence of Hzf, p53-mediated cell cycle arrest is promoted while apoptosis is repressed in response to genotoxic stress.

Prolonged p53 expression/activation or extended exposure to stress results in Hzf protein downregulation/degradation leading to apoptosis

To examine whether levels of Hzf expression are correlated with levels of genotoxic stress, we investigated the kinetics of Hzf induction at extended time points during stress response in U2OS cells. The results shown in Figure 5A suggest that Hzf protein expression is rapidly induced in response to etoposide treatment or ectopic p53 up to 36 hours, but beyond 36 hours Hzf protein levels start declining and are markedly decreased at the 72 hours. p21 expression also followed a similar pattern to that observed with Hzf. In contrast, Bax protein levels rose very slowly up to 36 hours but beyond that time exhibited a sharp increase ( Figure 5A ). We also immunoprecipitated p53 over the time courses of etoposide treatment to examine the amounts of Hzf bound to p53. We found that there was a sharp decline in the amounts of p53-bound Hzf beyond the 36-hour time point to the undetectable levels at 72 hours ( Figure 5B ). However, Hzf mRNA levels remained steady throughout the time course while mRNA levels of p21 and Bax were similar to their protein levels ( Figure 5C ), suggesting that Hzf down-regulation is due to the degradation of the Hzf protein. To determine the implication for these differential responses in Hzf protein levels in response to genotoxic stress or p53, we next tested the cell cycle profile under these conditions by flow cytometry. Ad-p53 overexpression induced a pronounced arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle at 24–36 hours ( Figure 5D ), after which there was a marked increase in the apoptotic population. TUNEL staining confirmed these results ( Figure 5E ). These results indicate that extended exposure to stress and the induction of a p53-mediated apoptotic response correlated with a reduction of Hzf, suggesting that Hzf may play a role in controlling the switch in the p53-dependent stress response.

Since ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation pathway is a frequently engaged mechanism for protein downregulation, we investigated the potential role of the proteasome in stress-induced Hzf protein degradation in cells undergoing p53-dependent apoptotic response. We treated U2OS cells with etoposide for 0, 36 and 72 hours. At 10 hours prior to the end of the 72-hour time point, the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Loss of Hzf triggered by genotoxic stress at 72 hours time point was significantly attenuated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulting in elevated p21 levels ( Figure 5F ). However, Bax levels were diminished similar to those at 36 hours in MG132 treated U2OS cells ( Figure 5F ). Furthermore, northern blot analysis showed that the proteosome inhibitor treatment elevated the levels of p21 mRNA, but decreased Bax mRNA ( Figure 5G ), supporting the hypothesis that the preferential DNA binding activities of p53 to p21 promoter results from stabilization of Hzf protein. This was confirmed by chromatin IP as well as quantitative ChIP assays by real-time PCR ( Figure 5H ; Figure S6A ). We next determined whether prolonged stress in cells triggered the polyubiquitination of Hzf prior to Hzf degradation. Treatment of U2OS cells with etoposide in the presence of MG132 revealed that endogenous Hzf undergoes extensive ubiquitination after prolonged exposure (72 hours treatment) to genotoxic stress, while no such ubiquitinated forms were observed at 36 hours treatment ( Figure 5I ). Moreover, proteosome inhibitor MG132-mediated stabilization of Hzf could indeed prevent the p53-mediated apoptosis upon prolonged exposure to genotoxic stress ( Figures S6B and S6C ). Thus, the appearance of ubiquitinated forms of Hzf in cells treated with MG132 supports the idea that the Hzf protein is targeted for degradation during prolonged exposure to genotoxic stress due to activation of an ubiquitination-proteasome pathway resulting in initiation of the apoptotic process.

Discussion

It is widely accepted that the p53 tumor suppressor restricts the proliferation of cells exposed to genotoxic stress by induction of growth arrest or by triggering cell death ( Vousden and Lu, 2002 ). This process depends mainly on the expression of genes that regulate cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. A critical unresolved issue about the DNA damage response is how the resulting up-regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor can lead either to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, or to apoptosis. Here we present evidence that Hzf plays a critical role in p53-mediated transcription and functions as a key player in controlling a cellular regulatory switch that dictates the cellular decision toward cell cycle arrest in response to stress. An autoregulatory feedback loop involving p53 and its target proteins such as Mdm2, Pirh2, and Cop1 is well established ( Dornan et al., 2004 ; Leng et al., 2003 ; Wu et al., 1993 ). These genes are known to have ubiquitin ligase activity, and can target p53 for ubiquitination and degradation to maintain low basal levels of the p53 protein. Unlike these p53 target proteins, Hzf encodes a zinc-finger domain protein, and its binding to p53 does not seem to regulate p53 stability in response to stress. Instead, induction of Hzf and its binding to p53 selectively influences the specificity of the p53-mediated transcription, resulting in preferential transactivation of its cell cycle arrest mediating target genes such as p21 and 14-3-3σ.

It has been previously shown that Hzf is a direct p53 transcriptional target in NIH3T3 cells ( Sugimoto et al., 2006 ). Promoter analyses revealed that p53 could bind directly to the p53 responsive element in the first intron of the Hzf gene. Moreover, Hzf was found to have a role in cell cycle checkpoint control, specifically at the G2/M checkpoint. Strikingly, knockdown of Hzf expression promoted p21 ubiquitination and degradation, the mechanism of which was not elucidated. We independently identified Hzf as a p53 target gene in human cells, and our promoter analysis strongly suggest that unlike mouse Hzf, the p53-responsive element in human Hzf is at the −1044 bp of the promoter region ( Figure S1 ). Our results show further that Hzf binds to p53, which results in preferential transactivation for pro-arrest p53 target genes. Thus, upon genotoxic stress, abrogation of Hzf expression results in preferential transactivation of pro-apoptotic p53 target genes such as Bax, Perp, Puma and Noxa over its pro-arrest targets such as p21 and 14-3-3σ. Hence, our results argue that down regulation of p21 and other pro-arrest p53 target genes such as 14-3-3σ in the absence of Hzf is transcriptional in nature.

Our results also indicate that the level of Hzf protein is inversely correlated with the extent of genotoxic stress. Prolonged p53 activation/expression or extended exposure to stress induced Hzf protein degradation through activation of an ubiquitination-proteasome pathway whose consequences were induction of pro-apoptotic p53 targets such as Bax, Puma, Noxa and Perp and apoptosis. Thus, we propose a model ( Figure 7C ) wherein p53 activates Hzf, which then binds to p53 in an autoregulatory feedback loop. Hzf-bound p53 is specifically recruited to cell cycle arrest gene promoters resulting in growth arrest. Prolonged p53 expression is associated with Hzf degradation, which then allows p53 activation of pro-apoptotic targets, resulting in apoptosis. However, if the cells lack the mechanism for Hzf degradation, prolonged p53 expression leads to senescence and shRNA mediated inhibition of Hzf expression makes the cells highly apoptotic ( Figure S8 ). Therefore, our results provide a novel mechanism for modulation of p53-dependent DNA damage response. It will be of interest to determine the expression pattern of p53-regulated genes by the microarray analysis in the absence or presence of Hzf as well as the specific interacting partner(s) that mediates Hzf ubiquitination/degradation. Recently, it was shown that Tip60-dependent acetylation of p53 at lysine120 modulates the decision between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, leading to enhanced p53-dependent apoptotic response ( Sykes et al., 2006 ; Tang et al., 2006 ). Thus it will be interesting to know whether the acetylation of K120 within the DNA-binding domain of p53 affects Hzf-mediated preferential transactivation of pro-arrest p53 target genes. While the role of Mdm2 in p53 regulation is well-established, we found that there is no role of Mdm2 in Hzf degradation ( Figure S9 ).

Another question remains as to whether cells that have deficiency of p53 pro-arrest or pro-apoptotic target(s) can affect Hzf-mediated cell fate decision upon genotoxic stress. In HCT116 and HCT116 p21 −/− cells genotoxic stress results in cell cycle arrest in both cells lines with p21 −/− cells showing a higher extent of G2/M arrest. If under such conditions Hzf is also knocked down, the cells show much increased apoptosis levels with marginal differences between them ( Figure S10 ). Thus, Hzf is likely to play a key role in sustaining p53 mediated cell cycle arrest through other pro-arrest p53 target genes such as 14-3-3σ in addition to p21. It is well established that HCT116 Bax −/− cells are resistant to apoptosis upon DNA damage ( Zhang et al., 2000 ). When Hzf was depleted in parental HCT116 and HCT116 Bax −/− cells and then exposed to DNA damage, there was a significant induction of apoptosis in both the cell types, but the extent of apoptosis was higher in the wild type cells (data not shown). Thus, Hzf can act through modulation of p53-mediated transactivation of multiple pro-arrest and pro-apoptotic genes.

Targeted Hzf disruption in the mouse germ line has no reported effects on cell cycle dynamics, but general growth retardation and internal hemorrhage in brain of Hzf −/− mice were observed ( Kimura et al., 2002 ). While mice lacking Hzf seemed to be otherwise normal, the initial characterization of Hzf-null mice suggested a role for Hzf in megakaryopoiesis and hemostasis. Based on our in vitro characterization of the role of Hzf in p53-dependent stress response, we carried out an analysis of Hzf function in response to irradiation under in vivo conditions using Hzf knock out mice. We observed that exposure to ionizing radiation results in increased cell death in Hzf −/− mice as compared to their wild type littermates, especially in the epidermis and prostate epithelium. However, comparison of the extent of apoptosis between the different tissues of γ-irradiated Hzf −/− mice revealed significant differences indicative of some tissue specificity with respect to Hzf function due to varying degree of Hzf expression in different tissues upon γ-irradiation. While our preliminary investigations reveal some evidence for epithelial hyperplasia in organs like lung, mammary gland, etc. of Hzf −/− mice, further studies will be needed to elucidate the role of Hzf in tumor susceptibility of mice and its implications for human cancer. Nevertheless, our present findings establish that Hzf functions downstream of p53 in DNA damage response and acts as a critical switch that favors cell cycle arrest over apoptosis by promoting preferential transactivation of pro-arrest targets of p53 both in vitro and in vivo . Thus, Hzf is both a p53 target and an important modulator of p53 functions, adding a new layer of complexity to the mechanisms by which p53 determines cell fate decisions in response to cellular stresses.
