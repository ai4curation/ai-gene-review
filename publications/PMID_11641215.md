Control of gene expression at the translational level is crucial for many 
developmental processes. The mRNA cap-binding protein, eIF4E, is a key player in 
regulation of translation initiation; appropriate levels of eIF4E are essential 
for normal cell-cycle regulation and tissue differentiation. The observation 
that eIF4E levels are elevated during gametogenesis in several organisms 
suggests that eIF4E might have a specific role in gamete formation as well. We 
show that one of the five isoforms of C. elegans eIF4E, IFE-1, is enriched in 
the germline and is a component of germ granules (P granules). The association 
of IFE-1 with P granules requires the P-granule protein PGL-1. In vitro PGL-1 
interacts directly with IFE-1, but not with the other four isoforms of eIF4E. 
Analysis of animals depleted of IFE-1 by RNAi shows that IFE-1 is required for 
spermatogenesis, specifically for efficient progression through the meiotic 
divisions and for the production of functional sperm, in both hermaphrodites and 
males. The requirement for IFE-1 is highly sensitive to temperature. IFE-1 is 
not required for oogenesis, as ife-1(RNAi) hermaphrodites produce viable progeny 
when normal sperm are supplied. Consistent with a primary role in 
spermatogenesis, ife-1 mRNA levels are highest in regions of the gonad 
undergoing spermatogenesis. Our results suggest that C. elegans spermatogenesis 
requires either this specific isoform of eIF4E or an elevated level of eIF4E.

INTRODUCTION

One of the levels at which gene expression is controlled is translation of mRNA. Translational control is crucial for normal embryonic development, proper regulation of the cell cycle, tissue induction and differentiation, and germline development ( Morris, 1995 ; Pain, 1996 ; Hake and Richter, 1997 ; Clemens and Bommer, 1999 ; Saffman and Lasko, 1999 ). Translational regulation can be achieved via cis -acting elements in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, trans -acting factors that interact with these UTRs, and the binding of core translational components to mRNAs ( Jackson and Wickens, 1997 ).

Recruitment of mRNAs to ribosomes to initiate translation is mediated by initiation factors of the eIF4 group and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). The eIF4 group includes eIF4A, an RNA helicase; eIF4B, an RNA-binding protein that stimulates eIF4A; eIF4E, a cap-binding protein; and eIF4G, the central organizing protein that colocalizes eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF3, PABP, the eIF4E kinase Mnk and RNA in the 48S initiation complex.

Intracellular levels of eIF4E strongly affect the rate of translation, specifically of mRNAs that are more strongly dependent on the cap ( Altmann et al., 1989 ; De Benedetti et al., 1991 ), and thus eIF4E is an attractive target for regulation of translation. In fact, the level, availability, and activity of eIF4E are regulated by several processes. First, the level of eIF4E is transcriptionally regulated; e.g. transcription of the eIF4E gene is increased in fibroblasts in response to growth factor treatment ( Rosenwald et al., 1993 ; Jones et al., 1996 ). Second, the availability of eIF4E is regulated by its association with eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), which, when bound to eIF4E, prevent its binding to eIF4G, thereby inhibiting translation initiation ( Sonenberg, 1996 ). Third, the activity of eIF4E is regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnk in response to extracellular stimuli, such as hormones, growth factors and mitogens, is generally correlated with an increase in translation rate ( Rhoads, 1993 ; Gingras et al., 1999 ).

The importance of regulating the level of eIF4E is underscored by the findings that moderate overexpression of eIF4E can cause deregulated cell proliferation and malignant transformation ( Lazaris-Karatzas et al., 1990 ; De Benedetti and Rhoads, 1990 ; Lazaris-Karatazas and Sonenberg, 1992 ). Conversely, depletion of eIF4E by antisense RNA slows growth rate ( De Benedetti et al., 1991 ) and partially reverses oncogenic transformation in cancer cells ( Rinker-Schaeffer et al., 1993 ). Furthermore, a direct correlation between the amount of eIF4E and malignant transformation has been reported in many cell lines and tumors ( De Benedetti and Harris, 1999 ). The recurrence of head and neck carcinomas after surgery is strongly correlated with eIF4E levels in the tumor margins ( Nathan et al., 1997 ). Normal development also depends on proper levels or availability of eIF4E. In immature oocytes of Xenopus , the availability of eIF4E is regulated by its association with the CPEB-Maskin complex ( Stebbins-Boaz et al., 1999 ). Maskin contains an eIF4E-binding motif similar to that found in eIF4G and 4E-BPs. The binding of eIF4E by the CPEB-Maskin complex precludes its interaction with eIF4G. During progesterone-induced oocyte maturation the Maskin-eIF4E interaction is weakened, allowing eIF4E and PABP to form a complex with eIF4G; complex formation is required for the recruitment of polyadenylated maternal mRNAs to ribosomes ( Stebbins-Boaz et al., 1999 ; Keiper and Rhoads, 1999 ).

In Caenorhabditis elegans , there are five isoforms of eIF4E, called IFE-1, IFE-2, IFE-3, IFE-4 and IFE-5 ( Jankowska-Anyszka et al., 1998 ; Keiper et al., 2000 ). Based on their primary sequences, cap-binding specificity and requirement for viability, IFE proteins have been grouped into three classes ( Keiper et al., 2000 ). Class A contains IFE-3, which is most similar to human eIF4E-1 and is essential for viability. Class B includes IFE-1, IFE-2 and IFE-5. Depletion of any individual class B member by RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) did not affect viability. However, blocking the expression of all three proteins caused 99% embryonic lethality, suggesting that they function redundantly in embryonic development. Class C contains IFE-4, which is the most divergent isoform of eIF4E in C. elegans and is completely dispensable. Class A and C members bind m 7 GTP-containing caps exclusively, while class B members bind both m 7 GTP- and m 3 2,2,7 GTP-containing caps.

A potential role for IFE-1 in germline development was brought to our attention by its interaction with the germ-granule component, PGL-1, in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Germ granules (also called P granules in C. elegans and polar granules in Drosophila ) are non-membrane-bound organelles that contain RNAs and proteins and are candidate ‘determinants’ of the germline. Several proteins have been found to be associated with P granules either constitutively or transiently. These include PGL-1 ( Kawasaki et al., 1998 ), GLH-1, GLH-2 ( Gruidl et al., 1996 ), GLH-3, GLH-4 ( Kuznicki et al., 2000 ), GLD-1 ( Jones and Schedl, 1995 ; Jan et al., 1999 ), PIE-1 ( Mello et al., 1996 ; Tenenhaus et al., 1998 ), MEX-1 ( Guedes and Priess, 1997 ), MEX-3 ( Draper et al., 1996 ) and POS-1 ( Tabara et al., 1999b ). Interestingly, all of these proteins have one or more RNA-binding motif(s) and therefore might have RNA-related functions. The presence of these proteins as well as of RNAs ( Subramaniam and Seydoux, 1999 ; Schisa et al., 2001 ) in these granules suggests that P granules are involved in some aspect of RNA metabolism or translation.

In this study, we show that ife-1 is expressed primarily in the germline, that IFE-1 protein associates with P granules, and that this association is dependent on PGL-1 protein. IFE-1 appears to be distinct from the other IFEs in being required specifically for the normal execution of spermatogenesis. This requirement is especially pronounced at elevated temperature. Depletion of IFE-1 causes a delay in spermatogenesis and production of defective sperm.

DISCUSSION

This study shows that one of the five C. elegans isoforms of eIF4E (IFE-1) plays a unique and essential role in germline development. IFE-1 is specifically required during spermatogenesis, and this requirement is more pronounced at elevated temperatures. Interestingly, IFE-1 is a component of P granules. The association of a translation initiation factor with P granules supports the view that these granules are involved in translational regulation.
