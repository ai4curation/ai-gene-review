Neuronal development requires proper migration, polarization and establishment 
of axons and dendrites. Growing evidence identifies the ubiquitin proteasome 
system (UPS) with its numerous components as an important regulator of various 
aspects of neuronal development. F-box proteins are interchangeable subunits of 
the Cullin-1 based E3 ubiquitin ligase, but only a few family members have been 
studied. Here, we report that the centrosomal E3 ligase FBXO31-SCF 
(Skp1/Cullin-1/F-box protein) regulates neuronal morphogenesis and axonal 
identity. In addition, we identified the polarity protein Par6c as a novel 
interaction partner and substrate targeted for proteasomal degradation in the 
control of axon but not dendrite growth. Finally, we ascribe a role for FBXO31 
in dendrite growth and neuronal migration in the developing cerebellar cortex. 
Taken together, we uncovered the centrosomal E3 ligase FBXO31-SCF as a novel 
regulator of neuronal development.
