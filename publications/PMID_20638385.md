We reported a novel interaction between Beclin 1, a key regulator of autophagy, 
and survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family. We found 
that knock-down of Beclin 1 down-regulated survivin protein, and the turnover 
rate of survivin was increased when Beclin 1 expression was silenced. Knock-down 
of Beclin 1 sensitized glioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and introduction 
of survivin antagonized the sensitizing effect, suggesting that down-regulation 
of survivin mediates the enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These 
results demonstrate a novel interaction between Beclin 1 and survivin, and may 
provide a potential mechanism underlying the cross-talk between autophagy and 
apoptosis.
