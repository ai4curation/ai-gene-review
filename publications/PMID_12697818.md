Studies of yeast have shown that the SIR2 gene family is involved in chromatin 
structure, transcriptional silencing, DNA repair, and control of cellular life 
span. Our functional studies of human SIRT2, a homolog of the product of the 
yeast SIR2 gene, indicate that it plays a role in mitosis. The SIRT2 protein is 
a NAD-dependent deacetylase (NDAC), the abundance of which increases 
dramatically during mitosis and is multiply phosphorylated at the G(2)/M 
transition of the cell cycle. Cells stably overexpressing the wild-type SIRT2 
but not missense mutants lacking NDAC activity show a marked prolongation of the 
mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Overexpression of the protein phosphatase 
CDC14B, but not its close homolog CDC14A, results in dephosphorylation of SIRT2 
with a subsequent decrease in the abundance of SIRT2 protein. A CDC14B mutant 
defective in catalyzing dephosphorylation fails to change the phosphorylation 
status or abundance of SIRT2 protein. Addition of 26S proteasome inhibitors to 
human cells increases the abundance of SIRT2 protein, indicating that SIRT2 is 
targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Our data suggest that human 
SIRT2 is part of a phosphorylation cascade in which SIRT2 is phosphorylated late 
in G(2), during M, and into the period of cytokinesis. CDC14B may provoke exit 
from mitosis coincident with the loss of SIRT2 via ubiquitination and subsequent 
degradation by the 26S proteasome.
