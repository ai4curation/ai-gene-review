The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates gene expression through protein 
degradation. Here we show that the F-box protein betaTrCP, the receptor 
component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for IkappaBalpha and 
beta-catenin degradation, is colocalized in the nucleus with ATF4, a member of 
the ATF-CREB bZIP family of transcription factors, and controls its stability. 
Association between the two proteins depends on ATF4 phosphorylation and on ATF4 
serine residue 219 present in the context of DSGXXXS, which is similar but not 
identical to the motif found in other substrates of betaTrCP. ATF4 
ubiquitination in HeLa cells is enhanced in the presence of betaTrCP. The 
F-box-deleted betaTrCP protein behaves as a negative transdominant mutant that 
inhibits ATF4 ubiquitination and degradation and, subsequently, enhances its 
activity in cyclic AMP-mediated transcription. ATF4 represents a novel substrate 
for the SCF(betaTrCP) complex, which is the first mammalian E3 ubiquitin ligase 
identified so far for the control of the degradation of a bZIP transcription 
factor.
