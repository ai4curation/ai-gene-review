Faithful chromosome segregation is essential for maintaining the genomic 
integrity, which requires coordination among chromosomes, kinetochores, 
centrosomes and spindles during mitosis. Previously, we discovered a novel 
coiled-coil protein, highly expressed in cancer 1 (Hec1), which is indispensable 
for this process. However, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. 
Here, we show that Hec1 directly interacts with human ZW10 interacting protein 
(Zwint-1), a binding partner of Zeste White 10 (ZW10) that is required for 
chromosome motility and spindle checkpoint control. In mitotic cells, Hec1 
transiently forms complexes with Zwint-1 and ZW10 in a temporal and spatial 
manner. Although the three proteins have variable cell cycle-dependent 
expression profiles, they can only be co-immunoprecipitated during M phase. 
Immunofluorescent study showed that Hec1 and Zwint-1 co-localize at kinetochores 
beginning at prophase and that ZW10 joins them later at prometaphase. Depletion 
of Hec1 impairs the recruitment of both Zwint-1 and ZW10 to kinetochores, while 
depletion of Zwint-1 abrogates the kinetochore localization of ZW10 but not 
Hec1. The results suggest that the localization of Hec1 at kinetochores is 
required for the sequential recruitment of Zwint-1 and ZW10. Disrupting this 
recruitment by inhibiting the expression of Hec1 or Zwint-1 causes chromosome 
missegregation, spindle checkpoint failure, and eventually cell death upon 
cytokinesis. Taken together, these results, at least in part, provide a 
molecular basis to explain how Hec1 plays a crucial role for spindle checkpoint 
control and faithful chromosome segregation.
