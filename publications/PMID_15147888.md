To explore more hNinein interacting proteins, the yeast two-hybrid screening 
using ninein C-terminal domain as bait protein was performed. One novel gene, 
CGI-99, was demonstrated to associate with hNinein in the yeast two-hybrid 
method and in vitro GST pull-down assay. Molecular characterization also showed 
that CGI-99 possessed a transcriptional activity at the N-terminal. In addition, 
CGI-99 formed a dimer with the C-terminal, which overlapped with hNinein binding 
site. In kinase assay, CGI-99 binds to hNinein and completely blocks the 
phosphorylation of hNinein by GSK3beta. Moreover, CGI-99 was highly expressed in 
all brain tumors which is in agreement with the Northern blot analysis. Taken 
together, we have isolated a novel protein CGI-99, which may be involved in the 
functional regulation of human ninein in the centrosome structure and may also 
be important in brain development and tumorigenesis.
