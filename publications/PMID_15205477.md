A major cause of aging is thought to result from the cumulative effects of cell 
loss over time. In yeast, caloric restriction (CR) delays aging by activating 
the Sir2 deacetylase. Here we show that expression of mammalian Sir2 (SIRT1) is 
induced in CR rats as well as in human cells that are treated with serum from 
these animals. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) attenuated this 
response. SIRT1 deacetylates the DNA repair factor Ku70, causing it to sequester 
the proapoptotic factor Bax away from mitochondria, thereby inhibiting 
stress-induced apoptotic cell death. Thus, CR could extend life-span by inducing 
SIRT1 expression and promoting the long-term survival of irreplaceable cells.
