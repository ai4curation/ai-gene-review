The orderly progression through the cell cycle is mediated by the sequential 
activation of several cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complexes. These 
kinases phosphorylate a number of cellular substrates, among which is the 
product of the retinoblastoma gene, pRb. Phosphorylation of pRb in late G1 
causes the release of the transcription factor E2F from pRb, resulting in the 
transcriptional activation of E2F-responsive genes. We show here that 
phosphorylation of the pRb-related p107 is also cell cycle regulated. p107 is 
first phosphorylated at 8 hr following serum stimulation of quiescent 
fibroblasts, which coincides with an increase in cyclin D1 protein levels. 
Consistent with this, we show that a cyclin D1/cdk4 complex, but not a cyclin 
E/cdk2 complex, can phosphorylate p107 in vivo. Furthermore, phosphorylation of 
p107 can be abolished by the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of cdk4. 
Phosphorylation of p107 results in the loss of the ability to associate with 
E2F-4, a transcription factor with growth-promoting and oncogenic activity. A 
p107-induced cell cycle block can be released by cyclin D1/cdk4 but not by 
cyclin E/cdk2. These data indicate that the activity of p107 is regulated by 
phosphorylation through D-type cyclins.
