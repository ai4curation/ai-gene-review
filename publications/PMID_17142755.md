Ag processing and presentation via MHC class II is essential for activation of 
CD4(+) T lymphocytes. gamma-IFN-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) is 
present in the MHC class II loading compartment and has been shown to facilitate 
class II Ag processing and recall responses to Ags containing disulfide bonds 
such as hen egg lysozyme (HEL). Reduction of proteins within the MHC class II 
loading compartment is hypothesized to expose residues for class II binding and 
protease trimming. In vitro analysis has shown that the active site of GILT 
involves Cys(46) and Cys(49), present in a CXXC motif that shares similarity 
with the thioredoxin family. To define the functional requirements for GILT in 
MHC class II Ag processing, a GILT-deficient murine B cell lymphoma line was 
generated and stably transduced with wild-type and cysteine mutants of GILT. 
Intracellular flow cytometric, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analyses 
demonstrated that wild-type and mutant GILT were expressed and maintained 
lysosomal localization. Transduction with wild-type GILT reconstituted MHC class 
II processing of a GILT-dependent HEL epitope. Mutation of either Cys(46) or 
Cys(49) abrogated MHC class II processing of a GILT-dependent HEL epitope. In 
addition, biochemical analysis of these mutants suggested that the active site 
facilitates processing of precursor GILT to the mature form. Precursor forms of 
GILT-bearing mutations in Cys(200) or Cys(211), previously found to display 
thiol reductase activity in vitro, could not mediate Ag processing. These 
studies demonstrate that the thiol reductase activity of GILT is its essential 
function in MHC class II-restricted Ag processing.
