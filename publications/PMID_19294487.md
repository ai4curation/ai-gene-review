Among various effector proteins for the Rho small GTPase, the function(s) of 
Rhotekin is almost unknown. We have identified a multi-domain adaptor protein, 
vinexin, as a binding partner for Rhotekin, using yeast two-hybrid screening of 
a human heart library. Rhotekin was found to associate with vinexin in vitro, in 
COS7 cells, and in brain tissues. The C-terminal Pro-rich motif of Rhotekin 
exhibited binding to the third SH3 domain of vinexin. The binding was little 
affected by Rho but was inhibited by activated Cdc42 in COS7 cells. 
Immunofluorescence analyses revealed partial colocalization of vinexin-alpha 
with Rhotekin at focal adhesions in REF52 fibroblast cells. These results 
suggest that Rhotekin forms a complex with vinexin and may play a role at focal 
adhesions.
