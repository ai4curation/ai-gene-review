During membrane traffic, transport carriers are first tethered to the target 
membrane prior to undergoing fusion. Mechanisms exist to connect tethering with 
fusion, but in most cases, the details remain poorly understood. GM130 is a 
member of the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins tat is involved in membrane 
tethering at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi intermediate compartment 
and cis-Golgi. Here, we demonstrate that GM130 interacts with syntaxin 5, a 
t-SNARE also localized to the early secretory pathway. Binding to syntaxin 5 is 
specific, direct, and mediated by the membrane-proximal region of GM130. 
Interestingly, interaction with syntaxin 5 is inhibited by the binding of the 
vesicle docking protein p115 to a distal binding site in GM130. The interaction 
between GM130 and the small GTPase Rab1 is also inhibited by p115 binding. Our 
findings suggest a mechanism for coupling membrane tethering and fusion at the 
ER to Golgi intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi, with GM130 playing a central 
role in linking these processes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that 
depletion of GM130 by RNA interference slows the rate of ER to Golgi trafficking 
in vivo. The interactions of GM130 with syntaxin 5 and Rab1 are also regulated 
by mitotic phosphorylation, which is likely to contribute to the inhibition of 
ER to Golgi trafficking that occurs when mammalian cells enter mitosis.
