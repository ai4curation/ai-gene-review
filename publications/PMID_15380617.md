Chk2 is a key player of the DNA damage signalling pathway. To identify new 
regulators of this kinase, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and found that 
Chk2 associated with the B' regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase PP2A. In 
vitro GST-Chk2 pulldowns demonstrated that B'gamma isoforms bound to Chk2 with 
the strongest apparent affinity. This was confirmed in cellulo by 
co-immunoprecipitation after overexpression of the respective partners in HEK293 
cells. The A and C subunits of PP2A were present in the complexes, suggesting 
that Chk2 was associated with a functionnal PP2A. In vitro kinase assays showed 
that B'gamma3 was a potent Chk2 substrate. This phosphorylation increased the 
catalytic phosphatase activity of PP2A measured on MAP kinase-phosphorylated 
myelin basic protein as well as on autophosphorylated Chk2. Finally, we 
demonstrated that overexpressing B'gamma3 in HEK293 suppressed the 
phosphorylation of Chk2 induced by a genotoxic treatment, suggesting that PP2A 
may counteract the action of the checkpoint kinase in living cells.
