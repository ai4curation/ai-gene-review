Muscle fibers form as a result of myoblast fusion, yet the cell surface 
receptors regulating this process are unknown in vertebrates. In Drosophila, 
myoblast fusion involves the activation of the Rac pathway by the guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor Myoblast City and its scaffolding protein ELMO, 
downstream of cell-surface cell-adhesion receptors. We previously showed that 
the mammalian ortholog of Myoblast City, DOCK1, functions in an evolutionarily 
conserved manner to promote myoblast fusion in mice. In search for regulators of 
myoblast fusion, we identified the G-protein coupled receptor brain-specific 
angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI3) as a cell surface protein that interacts with 
ELMO. In cultured cells, BAI3 or ELMO1/2 loss of function severely impaired 
myoblast fusion without affecting differentiation and cannot be rescued by 
reexpression of BAI3 mutants deficient in ELMO binding. The related BAI protein 
family member, BAI1, is functionally distinct from BAI3, because it cannot 
rescue the myoblast fusion defects caused by the loss of BAI3 function. Finally, 
embryonic muscle precursor expression of a BAI3 mutant unable to bind ELMO was 
sufficient to block myoblast fusion in vivo. Collectively, our findings provide 
a role for BAI3 in the relay of extracellular fusion signals to their 
intracellular effectors, identifying it as an essential transmembrane protein 
for embryonic vertebrate myoblast fusion.
