The regulation of gene repression by corepressors is a controlled process. 
Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization MS proteomic analysis and a yeast 
two-hybrid screen showed independently that the corepressor Alien interacts with 
the CREB-binding protein (CBP) coactivator. This interaction was further 
confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down 
experiments, suggesting that Alien interacts in vivo and in vitro with the 
histone acetyltransferase (HAT) coactivators CBP and its paralog p300. 
Acetylation detection experiments indicated that Alien is acetylated in vivo. 
Furthermore, Alien interacts with the central region of CBP/p300 containing the 
HAT domain and becomes acetylated in vitro. When an inhibitor of CBP/p300 HAT 
activity was employed, the Alien-mediated silencing was enhanced. Thus, these 
findings suggest crosstalk between corepressors and coactivators, and indicate 
fine-tuning of corepressor function by post-translational modification through 
corepressor acetylation.
