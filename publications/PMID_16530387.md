Platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF) and PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFR) play 
critical roles in mesangial cell proliferation during embryonic development and 
in mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. We have shown previously that 
phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3 kinase/Akt and Erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) contribute to PDGF-dependent proliferation of mesangial cells, but 
the mechanism by which these two enzyme cascades are activated by PDGFR 
signaling is not precisely known. We examined the role of c-Src tyrosine kinase 
in this process. PDGF increased phosphorylation of c-Src in a time-dependent 
manner indicating its activation. A pharmacologic inhibitor of c-Src, PP1, 
blocked PDGF-induced DNA synthesis with concomitant inhibition of c-Src 
phosphorylation. Immune-complex kinase assays of c-Src and PDGFR demonstrated 
inhibition of c-Src tyrosine kinase activity by PP1, without an effect on PDGFR 
tyrosine phosphorylation. Both PP1 and expression of dominant negative c-Src 
inhibited PDGF-induced PI 3 kinase, resulting in attenuation of Akt kinase 
activity. Expression of constitutively active c-Src increased Akt activity to 
the same extent as with PDGF. Constitutively active c-Src augmented PDGF-induced 
Akt activity, thus contributing to Akt signaling. Inhibition of c-Src tyrosine 
kinase blocked PDGF-stimulated MAPK activity and resulted in attenuation of 
c-fos gene transcription with concomitant prevention of Elk-1 transactivation. 
Furthermore, inhibition of c-Src increased p27(Kip1) cyclin kinase inhibitor, 
and attenuated PDGF-induced pRb phosphorylation and CDK2 activity. These data 
provide the first evidence in mesangial cells that PDGF-activated c-Src tyrosine 
kinase relays signals to PI 3 kinase/Akt and MAPK. Furthermore our results 
demonstrate that c-Src integrates signals into the nucleus to activate CDK2, 
which is required for DNA synthesis.
