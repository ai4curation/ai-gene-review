Synapsins are a family of neuron-specific synaptic vesicle-associated 
phosphoproteins that have been implicated in synaptogenesis and in the 
modulation of neurotransmitter release. In mammals, distinct genes for synapsins 
I and II have been identified, each of which gives rise to two alternatively 
spliced isoforms. We have now cloned and characterized a third member of the 
synapsin gene family, synapsin III, from human DNA. Synapsin III gives rise to 
at least one protein isoform, designated synapsin IIIa, in several mammalian 
species. Synapsin IIIa is associated with synaptic vesicles, and its expression 
appears to be neuron-specific. The primary structure of synapsin IIIa conforms 
to the domain model previously described for the synapsin family, with domains 
A, C, and E exhibiting the highest degree of conservation. Synapsin IIIa 
contains a novel domain, termed domain J, located between domains C and E. The 
similarities among synapsins I, II, and III in domain organization, 
neuron-specific expression, and subcellular localization suggest a possible role 
for synapsin III in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and 
synaptogenesis. The human synapsin III gene is located on chromosome 22q12-13, 
which has been identified as a possible schizophrenia susceptibility locus. On 
the basis of this localization and the well established neurobiological roles of 
the synapsins, synapsin III represents a candidate gene for schizophrenia.
