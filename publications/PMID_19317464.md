Many proteins within eukaryotic cells are organized spatially and functionally 
into membrane bound organelles and complexes. A protein's location thus provides 
information about its function. Here, we apply LOPIT, a mass-spectrometry based 
technique that simultaneously maps proteins to specific subcellular 
compartments, to Drosophila embryos. We determine the subcellular distribution 
of hundreds of proteins, and protein complexes. Our results reveal the potential 
of LOPIT to provide average snapshots of cells.
