Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a novel cytokine whose effects on T-cell activation 
and proliferation are similar to those of interleukin-2 (IL-2), presumably 
because IL-15 utilizes the beta and gamma chains of the IL-2 receptor. Murine 
IL-15 cDNA and genomic clones were isolated and characterized. The murine Il15 
gene was found to consist of eight exons spanning at least 34 kb and was 
localized to the central region of mouse chromosome 8 by interspecific backcross 
analysis. Intron positions in a partial human IL15 genomic clone were identical 
with positions of corresponding introns in the murine gene. The human IL15 gene 
was mapped to human chromosome 4q31 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
