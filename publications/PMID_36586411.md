As a key component of the inflammasome, NLRP3 is a critical intracellular danger 
sensor emerging as an important clinical target in inflammatory diseases. 
However, little is known about the mechanisms that determine the kinetics of 
NLRP3 inflammasome stability and activity to ensure effective and controllable 
inflammatory responses. Here, we show that S-palmitoylation acts as a brake to 
turn NLRP3 inflammasome off. zDHHC12 is identified as the S-acyltransferase for 
NLRP3 palmitoylation, which promotes its degradation through the 
chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway. Zdhhc12 deficiency in mice enhances 
inflammatory symptoms and lethality following alum-induced peritonitis and 
LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Notably, several disease-associated mutations in 
NLRP3 are associated with defective palmitoylation, resulting in overt NLRP3 
inflammasome activation. Thus, our findings identify zDHHC12 as a repressor of 
NLRP3 inflammasome activation and uncover a previously unknown regulatory 
mechanism by which the inflammasome pathway is tightly controlled by the dynamic 
palmitoylation of NLRP3.
