Melanization is an innate immune response in arthropods that encapsulates and 
kills invading pathogens. One of its rate-limiting steps is the activation of 
prophenoloxidase (PPO), which is controlled by an extracellular proteinase 
cascade and serpin inhibitors. The molecular composition of this system is 
largely unknown in mosquitoes with the exception of serpin-2 (SRPN2), which was 
previously identified as a key negative regulator of melanization. Using reverse 
genetic and biochemical techniques, we identified the Anopheles gambiae 
clip-serine proteinase CLIPB9 as a PPO-activating proteinase, which is inhibited 
by SRPN2. Double knockdown of SRPN2 and CLIPB9 reversed the pleiotrophic 
phenotype induced by SRPN2 silencing. This study identifies the first inhibitory 
serpin-serine proteinase pair in mosquitoes and defines a regulatory unit of 
melanization. Additionally, the interaction of CLIPB9 and SRPN2 affects the life 
span of adult female mosquitoes and therefore constitutes a well-defined 
potential molecular target for novel late-life acting insecticides.
