APIP, Apaf-1 interacting protein, has been known to inhibit two main types of 
programmed cell death, apoptosis and pyroptosis, and was recently found to be 
associated with cancers and inflammatory diseases. Distinct from its inhibitory 
role in cell death, APIP was also shown to act as a 
5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase, or MtnB, in the methionine salvage 
pathway. Here we report the structural and enzymatic characterization of human 
APIP as an MtnB enzyme with a Km of 9.32 μM and a Vmax of 1.39 μmol min(-1) 
mg(-1). The crystal structure was determined at 2.0-Å resolution, revealing an 
overall fold similar to members of the zinc-dependent class II aldolase family. 
APIP/MtnB exists as a tetramer in solution and exhibits an assembly with C4 
symmetry in the crystal lattice. The pocket-shaped active site is located at the 
end of a long cleft between two adjacent subunits. We propose an enzymatic 
reaction mechanism involving Glu139* as a catalytic acid/base, as supported by 
enzymatic assay, substrate-docking study, and sequence conservation analysis. We 
explored the relationship between two distinct functions of APIP/MtnB, cell 
death inhibition, and methionine salvage, by measuring the ability of enzymatic 
mutants to inhibit cell death, and determined that APIP/MtnB functions as a cell 
death inhibitor independently of its MtnB enzyme activity for apoptosis induced 
by either hypoxia or etoposide, but dependently for caspase-1-induced 
pyroptosis. Our results establish the structural and biochemical groundwork for 
future mechanistic studies of the role of APIP/MtnB in modulating cell death and 
inflammation and in the development of related diseases.
