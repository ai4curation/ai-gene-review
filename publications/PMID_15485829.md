Physical forces play important roles in regulating cell proliferation, 
differentiation, and death by activating intracellular signal transduction 
pathways. How cells sense mechanical stimulation, however, is largely unknown. 
Most studies focus on cellular membrane proteins such as ion channels, 
integrins, and receptors for growth factors as mechanosensory units. Here we 
show that mechanical stretch-induced c-Src protein tyrosine kinase activation is 
mediated through the actin filament-associated protein (AFAP). Distributed along 
the actin filaments, AFAP can directly active c-Src through binding to its Src 
homology 3 and/or 2 domains. Mutations at these specific binding sites on AFAP 
blocked mechanical stretch-induced c-Src activation. Therefore, mechanical force 
can be transmitted along the cytoskeleton, and interaction between cytoskeletal 
associated proteins and enzymes related to signal transduction may convert 
physical forces into biochemical reactions. Cytoskeleton deformation-induced 
protein-protein interaction via specific binding sites may represent a novel 
intracellular mechanism for cells to sense mechanical stimulation.
