The seven members of the human 14-3-3 protein family regulate a diverse range of 
cell signaling pathways by formation of protein-protein complexes with signaling 
proteins that contain phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues within specific sequence 
motifs. Previously, crystal structures of three 14-3-3 isoforms (zeta, sigma, 
and tau) have been reported, with structural data for two isoforms deposited in 
the Protein Data Bank (zeta and sigma). In this study, we provide structural 
detail for five 14-3-3 isoforms bound to ligands, providing structural coverage 
for all isoforms of a human protein family. A comparative structural analysis of 
the seven 14-3-3 proteins revealed specificity determinants for binding of 
phosphopeptides in a specific orientation, target domain interaction surfaces 
and flexible adaptation of 14-3-3 proteins through domain movements. 
Specifically, the structures of the beta isoform in its apo and peptide bound 
forms showed that its binding site can exhibit structural flexibility to 
facilitate binding of its protein and peptide partners. In addition, the complex 
of 14-3-3 beta with the exoenzyme S peptide displayed a secondary structural 
element in the 14-3-3 peptide binding groove. These results show that the 14-3-3 
proteins are adaptable structures in which internal flexibility is likely to 
facilitate recognition and binding of their interaction partners.
