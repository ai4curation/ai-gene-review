CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) possesses E3 ligase activity and 
promotes degradation of key factors involved in the light regulation of plant 
development. The finding that CULLIN4 (CUL4)-Damaged DNA Binding Protein1 (DDB1) 
interacts with DDB1 binding WD40 (DWD) proteins to act as E3 ligases implied 
that CUL4-DDB1 may associate with COP1-SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA (SPA) protein 
complexes, since COP1 and SPAs are DWD proteins. Here, we demonstrate that 
CUL4-DDB1 physically associates with COP1-SPA complexes in vitro and in vivo, 
likely via direct interaction of DDB1 with COP1 and SPAs. The interactions 
between DDB1 and COP1, SPA1, and SPA3 were disrupted by mutations in the WDXR 
motifs of MBP-COP1, His-SPA1, and His-SPA3. CUL4 cosuppression mutants enhanced 
weak cop1 photomorphogenesis and flowered early under short days. Early 
flowering of short day-grown cul4 mutants correlated with increased FLOWERING 
LOCUS T transcript levels, whereas CONSTANS transcript levels were not altered. 
De-etiolated1 and COP1 can bind DDB1 and may work with CUL4-DDB1 in distinct 
complexes, but they mediate photomorphogenesis in concert. Thus, a series of 
CUL4-DDB1-COP1-SPA E3 ligase complexes may mediate the repression of 
photomorphogenesis and, possibly, of flowering time.

The interactions between DDB1 and COP1, SPA1, and SPA3 were disrupted by mutations in the WDXR motifs of MBP-COP1, His-SPA1, and His-SPA3. CUL4 cosuppression mutants enhanced weak cop1 photomorphogenesis and flowered early under short days. Early flowering of short day–grown cul4 mutants correlated with increased FLOWERING LOCUS T transcript levels, whereas CONSTANS transcript levels were not altered. De-etiolated1 and COP1 can bind DDB1 and may work with CUL4-DDB1 in distinct complexes, but they mediate photomorphogenesis in concert. Thus, a series of CUL4-DDB1-COP1-SPA E3 ligase complexes may mediate the repression of photomorphogenesis and, possibly, of flowering time.

INTRODUCTION

Light is an essential signal for plant development and is involved in diverse processes throughout the life of a plant, ranging from germination and seedling photomorphogenesis to flowering. Light-grown seedlings exhibit short hypocotyls and opened and expanded cotyledons, while dark-grown seedlings show long hypocotyls, closed cotyledons, and apical hooks. The two developmental strategies adopted in light and dark conditions were named photomorphogenesis and skotomorphogenesis, respectively ( von Arnim and Deng, 1996 ). At the adult stage, the transition from vegetative to reproductive development in plants is regulated by many cues, including photoperiod. In Arabidopsis thaliana , long days (LDs) accelerate flowering, whereas short days (SDs) delay flowering ( Liu et al., 2008 ).

Genetic screening for Arabidopsis mutants involved in light-regulated seedling development followed by biochemical analyses identified a group of pleiotropic Constitutive Photomorphogenic/De-etiolated/Fusca (COP/DET/FUS) proteins that are central negative regulators of photomorphogenesis ( Sullivan et al., 2003 ; Yi and Deng, 2005 ). These proteins are components of one of three biochemical entities: the COP1-SPA complexes, the COP9 signalosome (CSN), or the CDD complex (COP10, DDB1, and DET1), all of which are involved in proteasomal degradation of photomorphogenesis-promoting factors ( Serino and Deng, 2003 ; Yanagawa et al., 2004 ; Yi and Deng, 2005 ; Zhu et al., 2008 ).

COP1 is a conserved Ring finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in multiple processes in many different organisms, including plant development and mammalian cell survival, growth, and metabolism. COP1 was first cloned and characterized in the model plant Arabidopsis as a repressor of light-regulated plant development ( Deng et al., 1991 , 1992 ). COP1 was shown to act as an E3 ligase that targets several photomorphogenesis-promoting proteins for destruction, including ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5; Osterlund et al., 2000 ), HY5 Homolog ( Holm et al., 2002 ), LONG AFTER FAR-RED LIGHT1 ( Seo et al., 2003 ), LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 ( Duek et al., 2004 ; Jang et al., 2005 ; Yang et al., 2005 ), and Phytochrome A ( Seo et al., 2004 ). Recently, COP1 has also been identified as an E3 ligase involved in the regulation of flowering time by directly targeting transcriptional activator CONSTANS (CO) for degradation ( Jang et al., 2008 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). The expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) is highly and rapidly increased in response to CO expression ( Samach et al., 2000 ). Also, COP1 can act with the substrate adaptor EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) to modulate light input to the circadian clock by destabilizing GIGANTEA (GI) ( Yu et al., 2008 ).

SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA 1 (SPA1) was first identified as a repressor of PHYA ( Hoecker et al., 1998 ). In Arabidopsis , there are three additional SPA1-like proteins: SPA2, SPA3, and SPA4 ( Hoecker et al., 1998 , 1999 ; Zhu et al., 2008 ). The quadruple spa mutant displays a phenotype similar to that of strong cop1 alleles, and the SPA genes are partially redundant in mediating light responses at both seedling and adult stages ( Laubinger and Hoecker, 2003 ; Laubinger et al., 2004 , 2006 ). Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the SPA proteins can self-associate or interact with each other, forming a heterogeneous group of SPA-COP1 complexes in Arabidopsis ( Zhu et al., 2008 ).

CULLIN4 (CUL4), a recently identified regulator of photomorphogenesis, links the three COP complexes (the COP1-SPA complexes, CSN, and the CDD complex) in the ubiquitination/proteasome-mediated degradation of key photomorphogenesis-promoting factors ( Chen et al., 2006 ). CUL4 is an important member of the Cullin family and serves as a scaffold in CUL4-DDB1–based ubiquitin ligases to regulate many processes, including cell proliferation, DNA repair, and genomic integrity by ubiquitinating key regulators ( Lee and Zhou, 2007 ). Recent studies have identified a group of DDB1 and CUL4-Associated Factors (DCAFs) or DDB1 binding WD40 proteins (DWD) as substrate receptors that dictate the specificity of the ubiquitination process in different organisms ( Angers et al., 2006 ; He et al., 2006 ; Higa et al., 2006b ; Jin et al., 2006 ; Lee et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that several of these DCAFs or DWD proteins interact with RING-BOX1 (RBX1)/Regulator of Cullins 1 (ROC1)-CUL4-DDB1 to form functional E3 ligases. For example, CDT2 was shown to interact with the CUL4-DDB1 complex to regulate S phase destruction of the replication factor CDT1 in response to DNA damage ( Higa et al., 2006a ; Jin et al., 2006 ; Ralph et al., 2006 ; Sansam et al., 2006 ). It was further demonstrated that the CUL4-DDB1-CDT2 ubiquitin ligase also targets the CDK inhibitor p21 for ubiquitination and degradation ( Abbas et al., 2008 ; Kim et al., 2008 ; Nishitani et al., 2008 ). Similarly, DCAF1/VprBP, a WD40 protein, forms a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase with CUL4-DDB1 and regulates DNA replication and embryonic development in both mammalian and plant systems ( McCall et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ). Related studies identified the CUL4-DDB1-VprBP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex as the downstream effector of lentiviral Vpr in arresting the cell cycle in G2 phase ( Hrecka et al., 2007 ; Le Rouzic et al., 2007 ). Moreover, WD40 protein FBW5 (for F-box and WD repeat domain containing 5) was shown to promote ubiquitination of tumor suppressor TSC2 and regulate TSC2 protein stability by associating with DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 ligase ( Hu et al., 2008 ). Similarly, in plants, DWD protein PRL1 was identified as the substrate receptor of a CUL4-ROC1-DDB1-PRL1 E3 ligase involved in the degradation of AKIN10 ( Lee et al., 2008 ).

Our previous work showed that CUL4 may interact with the CDD complex to form an E3 ligase and regulate photomorphogenesis. In addition, CUL4 associated with COP1, which suggested that these two proteins may work together to regulate photomorphogenesis ( Chen et al., 2006 ). Recently, a detailed biochemical characterization of the COP1-SPA complexes suggested that the four endogenous homologous SPA proteins can form stable complexes with COP1 in vivo regardless of light conditions, although individual SPA proteins exhibited distinct expression profiles in different tissues and light conditions ( Zhu et al., 2008 ). However, the mechanism by which CUL4-DDB1 works with the COP1-SPA complexes to mediate the light regulation of plant development remains to be elucidated.

Here, we demonstrate that CUL4-DDB1 directly interacts with the COP1-SPA complexes in vivo and in vitro and that this interaction still exists in the absence of the CDD complex in Arabidopsis . CUL4-DDB1 and COP1-SPA complexes may work in concert to regulate photomorphogenesis and, possibly, flowering time under SD conditions. Furthermore, we hypothesize that CUL4-DDB1 may interact with COP1-SPA complexes to form a new group of E3 ligases, which are distinct from the previously described RBX1-CUL4-CDD complex but work in concert with this complex to mediate light regulation of plant development.

DISCUSSION

This study provides a biochemical and functional analysis of CUL4-DDB1 and COP1-SPA complexes. Our data show that CUL4-DDB1 may directly interact with COP1-SPA complexes in the absence of the CDD complex and form a heterogenous group of E3 ligases that regulate multiple aspects of the light regulation of plant development. Our previous data showed that the CSN regulates the rubylation and derubylation cycle of CUL4, while the CDD complex may bind CUL4 to form another E3 ligase ( Chen et al., 2006 ). How this CUL4-CDD E3 ligase works together with CUL4-DDB1-COP1-SPA E3 ligases remains to be elucidated.
