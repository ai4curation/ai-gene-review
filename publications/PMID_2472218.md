Binding of EGF to cells expressing human EGF receptor stimulated rapid tyrosine 
phosphorylation of phospholipase C-II (PLC-II), as revealed by immunoblotting 
analysis with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. Tyrosine phosphorylation of 
PLC-II was stimulated by low physiological concentrations of EGF (1 nM), was 
quantitative, and was already maximal after a 30 sec incubation with 50 nM EGF 
at 37 degrees C. Interestingly, antibodies specific for PLC-II were able to 
coimmunoprecipitate the EGF receptor and antibodies against EGF receptor also 
coimmunoprecipitated PLC-II. According to this analysis, approximately 1% of EGF 
receptor molecules were associated with PLC-II molecules. The protein tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor tyrphostin RG50864, which blocks EGF-dependent cell 
proliferation, blocked EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-II, its 
association with EGF receptor, and EGF-induced Ca2+ release. Hence, EGF-induced 
tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-II may be a regulatory event linking the 
tyrosine kinase activity of EGF receptor to the PIP2 hydrolysis signaling 
pathway.
