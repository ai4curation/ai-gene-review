Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) protein is a major substrate of the insulin 
receptor tyrosine kinase and is essential for transducing many of the biological 
effects of insulin including mitogenesis, gene expression, and glucose 
transport. The N terminus of IRS-1 contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain 
that is critical for recognition and subsequent phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the 
activated insulin receptor. Here we report the isolation of a novel protein, 
PHIP (PH-interacting protein), which selectively binds to the PH domain of IRS-1 
in vitro and stably associates with IRS-1 in vivo. Importantly, mutants of the 
IRS-1 PH domain that disrupt the PH fold fail to bind to PHIP. 
Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of PHIP revealed no discernible insulin 
receptor-regulated phosphorylation, suggesting that PHIP is not itself a 
substrate of the insulin receptor. In contrast to full-length PHIP, 
overexpression of the PH-binding region of PHIP has a pronounced inhibitory 
effect on insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Furthermore, 
expression of this dominant-negative PHIP mutant leads to a marked attenuation 
of insulin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. We conclude 
that PHIP represents a novel protein ligand of the IRS-1 PH domain that may 
serve to link IRS-1 to the insulin receptor.
