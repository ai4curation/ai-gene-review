The TRPM7 (transient receptor potential melastatin 7) ion channel has been 
implicated in the uptake of Mg2+ into vertebrate cells, as elimination of TRPM7 
expression through gene targeting in DT40 B-lymphocytes renders them unable to 
grow in the absence of supplemental Mg2+. However, a residual capacity of 
TRPM7-deficient cells to accumulate Mg2+ and proliferate when provided with 
supplemental Mg2+ suggests the existence of Mg2+ uptake mechanism(s) other than 
TRPM7. Evaluation of the expression of several members of the SLC41 (solute 
carrier family 41) family, which exhibit homology with the MgtE class of 
prokaryotic putative bivalent-cation transporters, demonstrated that one, 
SLC41A2 (solute carrier family 41 member 2), is expressed in both wild-type and 
TRPM7-deficient DT40 cells. Characterization of heterologously expressed SLC41A2 
protein indicated that it is a plasma-membrane protein with an 
N-terminus-outside/C-terminus-inside 11-TM (transmembrane)-span topology, 
consistent with its functioning as a trans-plasma-membrane transporter. In 
contrast with a previous report of ion-channel activity associated with SLC41A2 
expression in oocytes, investigation of whole cell currents in 
SLC41A2-expressing DT40 cells revealed no novel currents of any type associated 
with SLC41A2 expression. However, expression of SLC41A2 in TRPM7-deficient cells 
under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter was able to conditionally 
enhance their net uptake of 26Mg2+ and conditionally and dose-dependently 
provide them with the capacity to grow in the absence of supplemental Mg2+, 
observations strongly supporting a model whereby SLC41A2 directly mediates 
trans-plasma-membrane Mg2+ transport. Overall, our results suggest that SLC41A2 
functions as a plasma-membrane Mg2+ transporter in vertebrate cells.
