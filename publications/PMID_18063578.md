Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) occurs in cells in nucleoids containing several copies 
of the genome. Previous studies have identified proteins associated with these 
large DNA structures when they are biochemically purified by sedimentation and 
immunoaffinity chromatography. In this study, formaldehyde cross-linking was 
performed to determine which nucleoid proteins are in close contact with the 
mtDNA. A set of core nucleoid proteins is found in both native and cross-linked 
nucleoids, including 13 proteins with known roles in mtDNA transactions. Several 
other metabolic proteins and chaperones identified in native nucleoids, 
including ATAD3, were not observed to cross-link to mtDNA. Additional 
immunofluorescence and protease susceptibility studies showed that an N-terminal 
domain of ATAD3 previously proposed to bind to the mtDNA D-loop is directed away 
from the mitochondrial matrix, so it is unlikely to interact with mtDNA in vivo. 
These results are discussed in relation to a model for a layered structure of 
mtDNA nucleoids in which replication and transcription occur in the central 
core, whereas translation and complex assembly may occur in the peripheral 
region.
