HIV release requires TSG101, a cellular factor that sorts proteins into vesicles 
that bud into multivesicular bodies (MVB). To test whether other proteins 
involved in MVB biogenesis (the class E proteins) also participate in HIV 
release, we identified 22 candidate human class E proteins. These proteins were 
connected into a coherent network by 43 different protein-protein interactions, 
with AIP1 playing a key role in linking complexes that act early 
(TSG101/ESCRT-I) and late (CHMP4/ESCRT-III) in the pathway. AIP1 also binds the 
HIV-1 p6(Gag) and EIAV p9(Gag) proteins, indicating that it can function 
directly in virus budding. Human class E proteins were found in HIV-1 particles, 
and dominant-negative mutants of late-acting human class E proteins arrested 
HIV-1 budding through plasmal and endosomal membranes. These studies define a 
protein network required for human MVB biogenesis and indicate that the entire 
network participates in the release of HIV and probably many other viruses.
