Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play a central role in the integration of 
proliferative and survival responses of most mammalian cell types. IGF-binding 
protein-3 (IGFBP-3) influences IGF action directly as a carrier of IGFs but also 
modulates these actions indirectly via independent mechanisms involving 
interactions with plasma, extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules, 
conditional proteolysis, cellular uptake, and nuclear transport. Here we 
demonstrate that a short C-terminal metal-binding domain (MBD) of IGFBP-3 
mediates binding to metals. MBD epitopes, sequestered in the intact molecule, 
are unmasked by incubation in the presence of ferrous (but not ferric or zinc) 
ions. An isolated 14-mer MBD peptide triggered apoptotic effects in stressed 
HEK293 cells as effectively as IGFBP-3. The MBD, which encompasses a nuclear 
localization sequence and an adjacent putative caveolin-binding sequence, 
mobilizes rapid cellular uptake and nuclear localization of unrelated proteins 
such as green fluorescent protein and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase 
conjugate. Metal ions stimulate MBD-mediated cellular/nuclear uptake in vivo. 
Cross-linking studies showed a direct physical interaction of MBD with integrins 
alphav and beta1, caveolin-1, and transferrin receptor. MBD-mediated protein 
mobilization and pro-apoptotic effects are inhibited by nystatin but not 
chlorpromazine, suggesting an involvement of caveolar-mediated endocytosis. 
However, MBD effects are inhibited by antibodies to transferrin receptor or 
integrins. These results are discussed with particular reference to the cell 
target specificity of IGFBP-3 in disease processes such as cancer and 
atherosclerosis.
