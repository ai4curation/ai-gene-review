Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a gene disrupted by a (1;11) 
(q42.1;q14.3) translocation that segregates with major psychiatric disorders in 
a Scottish family. To investigate how DISC1 confers susceptibility to 
psychiatric disorders, we previously identified fasciculation and elongation 
protein zeta-1 and Kendrin as DISC1-interacting molecules in a yeast two-hybrid 
screen of a human brain complementary DNA library. Here, we have further 
identified a novel DISC1-interacting protein, termed DISC1-Binding Zinc-finger 
protein (DBZ), which has a predicted C(2)H(2)-type zinc-finger motif and 
coiled-coil domains. DBZ was co-immunoprecipitated with DISC1 in lysates of PC12 
cells and rat brain tissue. The domain of DISC1 interacting with DBZ was close 
to the translocation breakpoint in the DISC1 gene. DBZ messenger RNA (mRNA) was 
expressed in human brains, but not in peripheral tissues. In situ hybridization 
revealed high expression of DBZ mRNA in the hippocampus, olfactory tubercle, 
cerebral cortex and striatum in rats. Because this pattern of localization was 
similar to that of the pituitary adenylate cyclase (PAC(1)) receptor for 
pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), which has recently 
been implicated in neuropsychological functions, we examined whether DISC1/DBZ 
interaction was involved in the PACAP signaling pathway. PACAP upregulated DISC1 
expression and markedly reduced the association between DISC1 and DBZ in PC12 
cells. A DISC1-binding domain of DBZ reduced the neurite length in PC12 cells 
after PACAP stimulation and in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The present 
results provide some new molecular insights into the mechanisms of neuronal 
development and neuropsychiatric disorders.
