The nucleotide sequence of a 916-bp human cDNA clone isolated from a human colon 
lambda gt11 cDNA library was determined. Sequence analysis showed this cDNA to 
have 88% homology to the nucleotide sequence of the heavy chain of rat clathrin. 
The deduced amino acid sequence was 98.7% identical to the rat sequence, a 
change of only four amino acids. The mRNA identified in both human and rat cells 
with the human clathrin clone revealed transcripts of approximately 6.5 kb, 
which is consistent with the predicted 180 kDa molecular weight of the clathrin 
heavy chain. Southern analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids localized 
the human clathrin heavy chain gene (CLTC) to chromosome 17. Additional analyses 
using panels of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids with specific chromosomal 
translocations and deletions mapped the human clathrin heavy chain gene locus to 
17q11-qter.
