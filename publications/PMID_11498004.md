The assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in the inner mitochondrial membranes of 
eukaryotic cells requires the protein products of a large number of nuclear 
genes. In yeast, some of these act globally and affect the assembly of several 
respiratory-chain protein complexes, whereas others act in a cytochrome c 
oxidase-specific fashion. Many of these yeast proteins have human counterparts, 
which when mutated lead to energy-related diseases. One of these proteins, 
Pet100p, is a novel molecular chaperone that functions to incorporate a 
subcomplex containing cytochrome c oxidase subunits VII, VIIa and VIII into 
holo-(cytochrome c oxidase). Here we report the topological disposition of 
Pet100p in the inner mitochondrial membrane and show that its C-terminal domain 
is essential for its function as a cytochrome c oxidase-specific 'assembly 
facilitator'.
