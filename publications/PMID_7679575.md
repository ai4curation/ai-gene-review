These studies demonstrate relatively rapid association of plasmin with 
thrombospondin and the effects of this interaction on plasmin activity towards 
D-Val-L-Leu-L-Lys p-nitroanilide hydrochloride (S-2251) and the proteinase 
inhibitors alpha 2-antiplasmin (alpha 2AP) and alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M). 
Binding of plasmin to thrombospondin reached an apparent reversible equilibrium 
within 3 min at 22 degrees C. The amidase activity of bound plasmin was 
inhibited. An analysis of S-2251 hydrolysis indicated that thrombospondin is a 
linear mixed-type plasmin inhibitor. The dissociation constant (KD) for the 
binding of plasmin to thrombospondin was 0.5 microM, assuming one plasmin 
binding site per thrombospondin homotrimer. Plasmin and miniplasmin slowly 
cleaved thrombospondin, yielding products which were comparable with those 
generated by other proteinases. Tranexamic acid inhibited the digestion of 
thrombospondin by plasmin and miniplasmin, suggesting an important role for the 
kringle-5 domain in this process. When plasmin was incubated first with 
thrombospondin and then with alpha 2AP, plasmin that was apparently bound to 
thrombospondin reacted with alpha 2AP at a decreased rate; however, within 20 
min, all of the plasmin was recovered in complex with alpha 2AP. Similar results 
were obtained with alpha 2M. Transfer of plasmin from thrombospondin to alpha 
2AP or alpha 2M probably required plasmin-thrombospondin-complex dissociation. A 
low level of reaction of alpha 2AP with thrombospondin-associated plasmin could 
not be ruled out. These results demonstrate that the activity of plasmin, when 
bound to thrombospondin, is greatly diminished or eliminated. The 
plasmin-thrombospondin complex, which is formed within 3 min, is fully 
reversible and the associated plasmin is in a latent form protected from 
proteinase inhibitors. Therefore, thrombospondin may regulate plasmin activity 
in a manner which is distinct from conventional proteinase inhibitors and other 
extracellular-matrix proteins.
