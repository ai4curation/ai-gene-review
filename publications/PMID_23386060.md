Stringent regulation of the interferon (IFN) signalling pathway is essential for 
maintaining the immune response to pathogens and tumours. The transcription 
factor STAT1 is a crucial mediator of this response. Here, we show that 
hCAF1/CNOT7 regulates class I and II IFN pathways at different crucial steps. In 
resting cells, hCAF1 can control STAT1 trafficking by interacting with the 
latent form of STAT1 in the cytoplasm. IFN treatment induces STAT1 release, 
suggesting that hCAF1 may shield cytoplasmic STAT1 from undesirable stimulation. 
Consistently, hCAF1 silencing enhances STAT1 basal promoter occupancy associated 
with increased expression of a subset of STAT1-regulated genes. Consequently, 
hCAF1 knockdown cells exhibit an increased protection against viral infection 
and reduced viral replication. Furthermore, hCAF1 participates in the extinction 
of the IFN signal, through its deadenylase activity, by speeding up the 
degradation of some STAT1-regulated mRNAs. Since abnormal and unbalanced 
JAK/STAT activation is associated with immune disorders and cancer, hCAF1 could 
play a major role in innate immunity and oncogenesis, contributing to tumour 
escape.
