Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, is an active component of Ranunculaceae and 
Papaveraceae plant families. Berberine has been found to suppress growth of 
several tumor cell lines in vitro through the cell-type-dependent mechanism. 
Expression and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is 
increased in colonic precancerous lesions and tumours, thus EGFR is considered a 
tumour promoter. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and 
mechanisms of berberine on regulation of EGFR activity and proliferation in 
colonic tumor cell lines and in vivo. We reported that berberine significantly 
inhibited basal level and EGF-stimulated EGFR activation and proliferation in 
the immorto Min mouse colonic epithelial (IMCE) cells carrying the APC(min) 
mutation and human colonic carcinoma cell line, HT-29 cells. Berberine acted to 
inhibit proliferation through inducing G1/S and G2/M cell cycle arrest, which 
correlated with regulation of the checkpoint protein expression. In this study, 
we also showed that berberine stimulated ubiquitin ligase Cbl activation and 
Cbl's interaction with EGFR, and EGFR ubiquitinylation and down-regulation in 
these two cell lines in the presence or absence of EGF treatment. Knock-down Cbl 
expression blocked the effects of berberine on down-regulation of EGFR and 
inhibition of proliferation. Furthermore, berberine suppressed tumor growth in 
the HT-29 cell xenograft model. Cell proliferation and EGFR expression level was 
decreased by berberine treatment in this xenograft model and in colon epithelial 
cells of APC(min/+) mice. Taken together, these data indicate that berberine 
enhances Cbl activity, resulting in down-regulation of EGFR expression and 
inhibition of proliferation in colon tumor cells.
