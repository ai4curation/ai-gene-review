Myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) binds to the catalytic subunit of 
protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C). This binding is believed to target PP1C to 
specific substrates including myosin II, thus controlling cellular 
contractility. Surprisingly, we found that during mitosis, mammalian MYPT1 binds 
to polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). MYPT1 is phosphorylated during mitosis by 
proline-directed kinases including cdc2, which generates the binding motif for 
the polo box domain of PLK1. Depletion of PLK1 by small interfering RNAs is 
known to result in loss of gamma-tubulin recruitment to the centrosomes, 
blocking centrosome maturation and leading to mitotic arrest. We found that 
codepletion of MYPT1 and PLK1 reinstates gamma-tubulin at the centrosomes, 
rescuing the mitotic arrest. MYPT1 depletion increases phosphorylation of PLK1 
at its activating site (Thr210) in vivo, explaining, at least in part, the 
rescue phenotype by codepletion. Taken together, our results identify a 
previously unrecognized role for MYPT1 in regulating mitosis by antagonizing 
PLK1.
