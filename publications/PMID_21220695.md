Selenoprotein K (Sel K) is a selenium-containing protein for which no function 
has been identified. We found that Sel K is an endoplasmic reticulum 
transmembrane protein expressed at relatively high levels in immune cells and is 
regulated by dietary selenium. Sel K(-/-) mice were generated and found to be 
similar to wild-type controls regarding growth and fertility. Immune system 
development was not affected by Sel K deletion, but specific immune cell defects 
were found in Sel K(-/-) mice. Receptor-mediated Ca(2+) flux was decreased in T 
cells, neutrophils, and macrophages from Sel K(-/-) mice compared with controls. 
Ca(2+)-dependent functions including T cell proliferation, T cell and neutrophil 
migration, and Fcγ receptor-mediated oxidative burst in macrophages were 
decreased in cells from Sel K(-/-) mice compared with that in cells from 
controls. West Nile virus infections were performed, and Sel K(-/-) mice 
exhibited decreased viral clearance in the periphery and increased viral titers 
in brain. Furthermore, West Nile virus-infected Sel K(-/-) mice demonstrated 
significantly lower survival (2 of 23; 8.7%) compared with that of wild-type 
controls (10 of 26; 38.5%). These results establish Sel K as an endoplasmic 
reticulum-membrane protein important for promoting effective Ca(2+) flux during 
immune cell activation and provide insight into molecular mechanisms by which 
dietary selenium enhances immune responses.
