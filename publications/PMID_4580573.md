Three additional genes required for deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Hartwell LH.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis was examined in asynchronous and 
synchronous cultures of a number of cdc (cell division cycle) 
temperature-sensitive mutant strains. The kinetics of DNA synthesis after a 
shift to the restrictive temperature was compared with that obtained after 
inhibition of protein synthesis at the permissive temperature, a condition that 
specifically blocks the initiation of new rounds of DNA replication, but does 
not block those in progress. Mutations in three genes (cdc 4, 7, and 28) appear 
to block a precondition for DNA synthesis since cells carrying these lesions 
cannot start new rounds of DNA replication after a shift from permissive to 
restrictive temperature, but can finish rounds that were in progress. These 
three genes are classified as having roles in the "initiation" of DNA synthesis. 
Mutations in two genes (cdc 8 and 21) block DNA synthesis, itself, since cells 
harboring these lesions that had started DNA synthesis at the permissive 
temperature arrest synthesis abruptly upon a shift to the restrictive 
temperature. Mutations in 13 other cdc genes do not impair DNA synthesis in the 
first cell cycle at the restrictive temperature.

Abstract

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis was examined in asynchronous and synchronous cultures of a number of cdc (cell division cycle) temperature-sensitive mutant strains. The kinetics of DNA synthesis after a shift to the restrictive temperature was compared with that obtained after inhibition of protein synthesis at the permissive temperature, a condition that specifically blocks the initiation of new rounds of DNA replication, but does not block those in progress. Mutations in three genes ( cdc 4, 7, and 28) appear to block a precondition for DNA synthesis since cells carrying these lesions cannot start new rounds of DNA replication after a shift from permissive to restrictive temperature, but can finish rounds that were in progress. These three genes are classified as having roles in the “initiation” of DNA synthesis. Mutations in two genes ( cdc 8 and 21) block DNA synthesis, itself, since cells harboring these lesions that had started DNA synthesis at the permissive temperature arrest synthesis abruptly upon a shift to the restrictive temperature. Mutations in 13 other cdc genes do not impair DNA synthesis in the first cell cycle at the restrictive temperature.
