We have previously shown that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains an 
antioxidant enzyme that can provide protection against a thiol-containing 
oxidation system but not against an oxidation system without thiol. This 25-kDa 
enzyme was thus named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA). We have now isolated and 
sequenced a yeast genomic DNA fragment that encodes TSA. Comparison of the 
predicted amino acid sequence of TSA with those of conventional antioxidant 
enzymes, including catalases, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutases, revealed 
no sequence homology. The 195-amino acid TSA sequence contains 2 cysteine 
residues. Southern blot analysis of petite yeast DNA, studies with protein 
synthesis inhibitors, and protein immunoblot analyses of cytosolic and 
mitochondrial proteins suggest that TSA is a cytosolic protein encoded by 
nuclear DNA (chromosome XIII). The yeast TSA gene was selectively disrupted by 
homologous recombination. The haploid tsa mutant was viable under air, 
suggesting that TSA is not essential for cell viability. The growth rates of the 
tsa mutant and wild-type strains were identical under anaerobic conditions. 
However, under aerobic conditions, especially in the presence of methyl viologen 
or a peroxide (t-butyl hydroperoxide or H2O2), the growth rate of the mutant was 
significantly less than that of wild-type cells. This result suggests that TSA 
is a physiologically important antioxidant.
