The biological and enzymatic function of SIRT4 is largely uncharacterized. We 
show that the Caenorhabditis elegans SIR-2.2 and SIR-2.3 orthologs of SIRT4 are 
ubiquitously expressed, also localize to mitochondria and function during 
oxidative stress. Further, we identified conserved interaction with 
mitochondrial biotin-dependent carboxylases (PC, PCC, MCCC), key enzymes in 
anaplerosis and ketone body formation. The carboxylases were found acetylated on 
multiple lysine residues and detailed analysis of mPC suggested that one of 
these residues, K748ac, might regulate enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, no 
changes in mPC acetylation levels and enzymatic activity could be detected upon 
overexpression or loss of functional SIRT4.
