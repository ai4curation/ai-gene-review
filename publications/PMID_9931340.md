## Abstract

The beta3A subunit gene (Ap3b1) of the AP-3 adaptor complex is altered in the 
mouse hypopigmentation mutant pearl, a model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and 
night blindness.

Lysosomes, melanosomes and platelet-dense granules are abnormal in the mouse 
hypopigmentation mutant pearl. The beta3A subunit of the AP-3 adaptor complex, 
which likely regulates protein trafficking in the trans - Golgi 
network/endosomal compartments, was identified as a candidate for the pearl gene 
by a positional/candidate cloning approach. Mutations, including a large 
internal tandem duplication and a deletion, were identified in two respective 
pearl alleles and are predicted to abrogate function of the beta3A protein. 
Significantly lowered expression of altered beta3A transcripts occurred in 
kidney of both mutant alleles. The several distinct pearl phenotypes suggest 
novel functions for the AP-3 complex in mammals. These experiments also suggest 
mutations in AP-3 subunits as a basis for unique forms of human Hermansky-Pudlak 
syndrome and congenital night blindness, for which the pearl mouse is an 
appropriate animal model.
