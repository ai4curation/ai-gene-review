Hsp104 is a ring-forming AAA+ machine that recognizes both aggregated proteins 
and prion-fibrils as substrates and, together with the Hsp70 system, remodels 
substrates in an ATP-dependent manner. Whereas the ability to disaggregate 
proteins is dependent on the Hsp104 M-domain, the location of the M-domain is 
controversial and its exact function remains unknown. Here we present cryoEM 
structures of two Hsp104 variants in both crosslinked and noncrosslinked form, 
in addition to the structure of a functional Hsp104 chimera harboring T4 
lysozyme within the M-domain helix L2. Unexpectedly, we found that our Hsp104 
chimera has gained function and can solubilize heat-aggregated 
beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) in the absence of the Hsp70 system. Our fitted 
structures confirm that the subunit arrangement of Hsp104 is similar to other 
AAA+ machines, and place the M-domains on the Hsp104 exterior, where they can 
potentially interact with large, aggregated proteins.
