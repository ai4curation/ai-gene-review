Disorganized ion transport caused by hypo- or hyperfunctioning of the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) can be detrimental and may 
result in life-threatening diseases such as cystic fibrosis or secretory 
diarrhea. Thus, CFTR is controlled by elaborate positive and negative 
regulations for an efficient homeostasis. It has been shown that expression and 
activity of CFTR can be regulated either positively or negatively by PDZ 
(PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1) domain-based adaptors. Although a positive regulation 
by PDZ domain-based adaptors such as EBP50/NHERF1 is established, the mechanisms 
for negative regulation of the CFTR by Shank2, as well as the effects of 
multiple adaptor interactions, are not known. Here we demonstrate a physical and 
physiological competition between EBP50-CFTR and Shank2-CFTR associations and 
the dynamic regulation of CFTR activity by these positive and negative 
interactions using the surface plasmon resonance assays and consecutive patch 
clamp experiments. Furthermore whereas EBP50 recruits a cAMP-dependent protein 
kinase (PKA) complex to CFTR, Shank2 was found to be physically and functionally 
associated with the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase PDE4D that precludes 
cAMP/PKA signals in epithelial cells and mouse brains. These findings strongly 
suggest that balanced interactions between the membrane transporter and multiple 
PDZ-based adaptors play a critical role in the homeostatic regulation of 
epithelial transport and possibly the membrane transport in other tissues.
