Telomerase activity controls telomere length and plays a pivotal role in stem 
cells, aging, and cancer. Here, we report a molecular link between Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling and the expression of the telomerase subunit Tert. β-Catenin-deficient 
mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells have short telomeres; conversely, ES cell 
expressing an activated form of β-catenin (β-cat(ΔEx3/+)) have long telomeres. 
We show that β-catenin regulates Tert expression through the interaction with 
Klf4, a core component of the pluripotency transcriptional network. β-Catenin 
binds to the Tert promoter in a mouse intestinal tumor model and in human 
carcinoma cells. We uncover a previously unknown link between the stem cell and 
oncogenic potential whereby β-catenin regulates Tert expression, and thereby 
telomere length, which could be critical in human regenerative therapy and 
cancer.

Abstract

The vertebrate nervous system develops from embryonic neural plate and neural crest. Although genetic mechanisms governing vertebrate neural development have been investigated in depth, epigenetic regulation of this process remains less understood. Redundancy of epigenetic factors and early lethality of animals deficient in critical epigenetic components pose major challenges in characterization of epigenetic factors in vertebrate neural development. In this study, we use the amphibian model Xenopus laevis to investigate the roles of non-redundant, obligatory components of all histone H3K4 activating methylation complexes (COMPASS, also known as SET1/MLL complexes) in early neural development. The two genes that we focus on, Ash2l and Dpy30 , regulate mesendodermal differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells and cause early embryonic lethality when removed from mouse embryos. Using targeted knockdown of the genes in dorsal ectoderm of Xenopus that gives rise to future nervous system, we show here that ash2l and dpy30 are required for neural and neural crest marker expression in Xenopus late neurula embryos but are dispensable for early neural and neural plate border gene expression. Co-immunoprecipitation assays reveal that Dpy30 and Ash2L associate with the neural plate border transcription factors, such as Msx1 and Tfap2a. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay further demonstrates that Ash2L and the H3K4me3 active histone mark accumulate at the promoter regions of the neural crest gene sox10 in a Tfap2a-dependent manner. Collectively, our data suggest that Ash2l and Dpy30 interact with specific transcription factors to recruit COMPASS complexes to the regulatory regions of neural crest specification genes to control their expression and influence development of the nervous system during vertebrate embryogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

Neural crest is a transient cell population that forms at the border between the neural plate and the non-neural ectoderm ( Basch et al., 2006 ). It is induced by collective signals from the neural plate, the non-neural ectoderm, and the underlying paraxial mesoderm. Upon closure of the neural plate to form a neural tube, neural crest emigrates out of the region to give rise to a variety of cell lineages, including, for example, neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, craniofacial cartilages, and melanocytes ( le Douarin et al., 2004 ). Defects in neural crest induction, specification, patterning, migration, or differentiation can lead to congenital anomalies in humans, highlighting the importance of understanding molecular mechanisms controlling neural crest development ( Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015 ).

The gene regulatory network underlying neural crest development has been delineated by studies in different animal models, especially in frog and chick. These works reveal that a cascade of transcription factors act at different developmental stages and engage in feedforward and feedback control to regulate neural crest specification, migration and differentiation. Depending on temporospatial expression patterns and the epistatic requirement for their activities, these transcription factors can be broadly categorized as neural plate border (NPB) specifiers and neural crest (NC) specifiers. The NPB genes, such as msx1 , tfap2a, zic1, cmyc, dlx5 , and pax3/7 , are expressed early, occupy a region including prospective dorsal neural tube, neural crest, and placodes, and are required for expression of NC specifiers ( de Crozé et al., 2011 ) ( Monsoro-Burq et al., 2005 ) ( Sato et al., 2005 ). The transcription factors known as NC specifiers, such as snail1/2 , id , foxd3 , twist, ets1 , and cmyb , are expressed in definitive neural crest, including the migratory population, and may have a late onset or persist in differentiating derivatives. Together, these genes govern proper development of the neural crest lineage ( Betancur et al., 2010 ).

In recent years, it is increasingly appreciated that the effect of transcription factors on target gene expression can be influenced greatly by the status of chromatin conformation ( Li et al., 2007 ) ( Zheng and Xie, 2019 ). This is known as epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Epigenetic control of chromatin conformation involves diverse mechanisms. These include DNA methylation, post-translational modifications of histones, differential usage of histone variants, non-coding RNAs, and chromatin remodelers ( Allis and Jenuwein, 2016 ) ( Gibney and Nolan, 2010 ) ( Yao et al., 2016 ). Some of the best studied histone modifications are histone methylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and phosphorylation. These modifications are reversible, dynamic in different cell types and during development, and can have both activating and repressing effects on transcription depending on the position and the nature of the modified amino acids( Jambhekar et al., 2019 ) ( Gopinathan et al., 2013 ) ( Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016 )( Jaenisch and Bird, 2003 ). The epigenetic mechanisms are shown to play critical roles in cell fate determination during embryonic development ( Barreiro and Tajbakhsh, 2017 ) ( Qiao et al., 2016 ) ( Hu et al., 2014 ).

Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic factors are also important for neural crest development ( Hu et al., 2014 ) ( Liu and Xiao, 2011 ) ( Strobl-Mazzulla et al., 2012 ). A range of histone methyltransferases and demethylases are implicated in regulating neural crest specification, migration, and/or differentiation in different vertebrate models ( Strobl-Mazzulla et al., 2010 ) ( Jacques-Fricke and Gammill, 2014 ) ( Matsukawa et al., 2015 ) ( Schwarz et al., 2014 ) ( Tien et al., 2015 ) ( Schwenty-Lara et al., 2020 ). Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) are shown to regulate migration and differentiation of neural crest derivatives ( Rao and LaBonne, 2018 ) ( Murko et al., 2013 ) ( Sen et al., 2018 ) ( Pezoa et al., 2020 ). Both histone H2A.Z and H3.3 are involved in differentiation of neural crest along specific lineages ( Raja et al., 2020 ) ( Pünzeler et al., 2017 ) ( Cox et al., 2012 ). Multiple components of chromatin remodeling complexes also participate in regulation of neural crest development ( Chandler and Magnuson, 2016 ) ( Marathe et al., 2013 ). Mutations in many of these genes associate with human diseases, including congenital birth defects, such as CHARGE syndrome and Hirschsprung disease, and tumor formation, including neuroblastoma and melanoma, tumors of neural crest origin ( Tien et al., 2015 ) ( Kim et al., 2018 ) ( Schwarz et al., 2014 ). Despite these advances emphasizing the crucial roles of epigenetic mechanisms, our understanding of epigenetic factors in neural crest development is far from complete. One major gap remains regarding to the contribution of activating epigenetic complexes to neural crest development.

Actively transcribed genes often contain the epigenetic marks of methylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4). Deposition of H3K4 methylation marks is carried out by a family of six, partially redundant, SET1/MLL histone methyltransferases ( Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016 ). These enzymes often work in large protein complexes (COMPASS complexes) that consist of, in addition to the methyltransferases, four common core components that are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human ( Shilatifard, 2012 ). These core subunits, WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30, play essential roles for optimal methyltransferase activity of SET1/MLL ( Qu et al., 2018 ) ( Hsu et al., 2018 ). They also interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression in a spatiotemporally specific manner ( Hoffmeyer et al., 2012 ) ( Ullius et al., 2014 ) ( Tan et al., 2008 ) ( Li et al., 2019 ). Genetic removal of core COMPASS components, such as Dpy30 and Ash2L , in mouse leads to early embryonic lethality, preventing further studies of potential function of these genes in regulation of neural and neural crest development ( Bertero et al., 2015 ) ( Stoller et al., 2010 ).

In this study, we use the amphibian Xenopus laevis as our model to investigate the roles of ash2l and dpy30 in neural crest development. Targeted knockdown of these genes in dorsal ectoderm, which gives rise to neural and neural crest tissues, avoids early defects in mesendoderm and allows us to dissect the function of ash2l and dpy30 in the development of the embryonic nervous system. We show that while NPB genes are not affected in the knockdown embryos, expression of neural crest specifiers is reduced greatly. This implies that that NPB specifiers may work with Dpy30/Ash2L-containing Set1/MLL complexes to regulate expression of neural crest genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that Dpy30/Ash2L interact with the NPB transcription factors Msx1 and Tfap2a. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay reveals enrichment of Ash2L and H3K4me3 upstream of the neural crest gene sox10 , and this enrichment is reduced when the level of NPB gene tfap2a is knocked down. Taken together, our work demonstrates that NPB transcription factors recruit Dpy30 and Ash2L to the regulatory regions of neural crest specifiers to deposit active epigenetic marks and promote expression of these genes.

DISCUSSION

In cell culture systems, epigenetic factors have been shown to participate in multiple processes, such as stem and precursor cell maintenance and differentiation, DNA repair and tumor formation and progression, and responses to growth factor signaling and cell-cell communication. It is therefore not surprising that epigenetic factors play crucial roles during embryonic development. Genetic manipulations of a myriad of epigenetic factors have confirmed important functions of these factors in embryogenesis of both invertebrates and vertebrates. However, early lethality of mammalian embryos deficient in many epigenetic factors poses a major challenge to further dissect the roles of these factors in development of specific tissues or organs at later stages. This is the case with the core components of H3K4 methylation complexes. Removal of Ash2l or Dpy30 in early mouse embryos results in lethality at the preimplantation stages ( Stoller et al., 2010 ) ( Bertero et al., 2015 ). Although conditional knockout mice have been generated and analyzed to reveal the involvement of these core components in development of the hematopoietic system and neurogenesis in embryonic and postnatal brains ( Li et al., 2019 ) ( Shah et al., 2020 ), the function of these core components in other developmental contexts is less understood. In our current study, we focus on the role of ash2l and dpy30 in early development of the neural and neural crest cells in Xenopus . We take advantage of the well-established fate map of early Xenopus embryos to perform targeted knockdown of these genes in neural and neural crest precursors. Our results show that ash2l and dpy30 are required for differentiation of neural and neural crest cells during Xenopus embryogenesis.

As core components of all H3K4 methylation complexes, it is assumed that ash2l and dpy30 should be widely expressed in all tissues. This is indeed the case during early development when both ash2l and dpy30 show broad expression in the embryos. However, though Ash2l protein remains to be distributed in tissues from all germ layers during Xenopus neurulation, the transcripts of ash2l and dpy30 become highly enriched in neural and neural crest cells. The discordance between protein and RNA expression has been reported previously ( Peshkin et al., 2015 ), though functional significance of this phenomenon is not understood well. In the case of ash2l and dpy30 , we speculate that new transcripts, and hence new proteins, are probably required to establish de novo H3K4 methylation domains at the genomic loci that need to be activated at specific developmental stages. Existing proteins may not be sufficient or efficient to carry out the function of rapid new gene activation. The requirement for chromatin remodeling is especially eminent during embryonic development, whereby cells alter their gene expression patterns during fate transition and acquisition ( Zheng et al., 2016 ) ( de Macedo et al., 2021 ). For certain epigenetic regulations, such as DNA methylation, separate enzymes are utilized to maintain (DNMT1) and to establish de novo (DNMT3) modification patterns ( Chen and Zhang, 2020 ; Greenberg and Bourc’his, 2019 ). For most histone modifiers, subunit composition of enzymatic complexes and the association of these complexes with distinct partners may differ depending on cell types and developmental stages ( Meier and Brehm, 2014 ; Roidl and Hacker, 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2011 ). Hence a reliance on new protein synthesis may provide a way for cells to control rapid changes in gene expression in particular tissues during embryogenesis. Though this idea is consistent with our observation that knockdown ash2l or dpy30 prevents expression of late neural or neural crest specifier genes, further studies are needed to reveal how new protein synthesis contributes to dynamic remodeling of chromatin during neural and neural crest development.

Knocking down ash2l or dpy30 does not affect early neural specification or formation of neural plate borders. Given that targeting the MOs in the marginal zone leads to gastrulation defects that delay blastopore closure (not shown), the results suggest that the antisense MOs can reduce protein production at early stages to influence cell behaviors. It therefore seems that the lack of an effect of the MOs on neural plate border genes may reflect a lesser sensitivity of these genes to the levels of Ash2l and Dpy30. It is possible that the NPB genes have a bivalent chromatin status bearing both H3K4 and H3K27 methylated marks and are kept in a poised state for activation ( Bernstein et al., 2006 ). Depletion of the core components of H3K4 methylation complexes hence has minimal effect on the expression of these genes. This contrasts with the late neural and neural crest genes whose expression apparently relies on the synthesis of new Ash2l and Dpy30 proteins, to possibly establish new activated chromatin domains. Consistent with the idea, examination of H3K4me3 patterns of several NPB and neural crest genes in Xenopus tropicalis , where ChIP data are available for different developmental stages, reveals that H3K4me3 peaks remain large stable from stages 11 to 16 for cmyc , msx1 , and tfap2a , whereas new peaks are gained for sox10 and snail2 from stages 11 to 16 ( Fortriede et al., 2020 ) ( https://www.xenbase.org ).

Although the H3K4 methylation complexes can interact with DNA, their association with particular genomic loci normally depends on their interaction with other DNA binding proteins or specific chromatin marks. As both neural plate border genes and Ash2l/Dpy30 are required for activation of neural crest specifiers, we propose that they may interact directly to regulate neural crest gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, we observe binding of several neural plate border transcription factors with Ash2l/Dpy30 complex in the co-IP assay. Investigation into one Ash2l/Dpy30 interacting partner, Tfap2a, reveals that this TF is necessary for recruiting Ash2l to the regulatory region of a neural crest specific gene, sox10 . Tfap2a has been shown to be a pioneer transcription factor capable of binding to nucleosomes to influence chromatin accessibility of associated genes ( Fernandez Garcia et al., 2019 ). During neural development, Tfap2a regulates sequentially neural plate border and neural crest specification by collaborating with other proteins, including forming distinct heterodimers with other Tfap2 family members ( de Crozé et al., 2011 ) ( Rothstein and Simoes-Costa, 2020 ). In our studies, we find that in the absence of Tfap2a, Ash2l recruitment and H3K4me3 deposition at the sox10 promoter are reduced, and the expression of sox10 is compromised. Our collective data indicate that as neural plate border genes and key components of H3K4 methylation complexes are synthesized during early neurulation, they associate at the regulatory regions of neural crest genes and collaborate to modulate chromatin conformation and assembly of transcriptional machinery. Together, the NPB transcription factors and the activating epigenetic factors act to stimulate the neural crest developmental program and allow subsequent differentiation of neural crest lineages.

Besides the activating epigenetic pathway, the repressive chromatin modulators have also been shown to control neural crest development. The proteins in polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family members can both regulate neural crest gene expression with less effect on neural plate border specification ( Tien et al., 2015 ) ( Tien et al., 2021 ). Counterintuitively, knockdown of repressive epigenetic factors (e.g. ezh2 and cbx1/hp1β ) leads to reduction, instead of activation, of neural crest genes, an effect similar to that induced by knockdown of activating epigenetic factors. The results imply that activating and repressing epigenetic pathways modulate distinct downstream targets, with the repressive epigenetic factors suppressing an inhibitor or inhibitors of neural crest development whereas activating factors promoting expression of neural crest genes. Although it is currently unclear what the direct targets of repressive epigenetic factors are, our previous work has demonstrated that knockdown of cbx1/hp1β leads to expansion of a pluripotent gene marker, pou5f3.2/oct25 . Double knockdown of cbx1/hp1β and pou5f3.2/oct25 can partially rescue neural crest defects ( Tien et al., 2021 ). This suggests that repressive epigenetic pathways may indirectly modulate neural crest specification via its control of pluripotent cell state. This is a distinct mechanism from the commonly referred crosstalk between opposing epigenetic pathways whereby activating and repressing epigenetic factors often converge on same target genes either to mark the genes as bivalent that are poised to rapid gene regulation or to reenforce the actions of mutually exclusive complexes in establishing particular chromatin domains as cells make fate decisions during development ( Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016 ) ( Shilatifard, 2012 ). Regardless how epigenetic pathways interact with each other, a cooperation between genetic and epigenetic factors is also crucial to regulate neural crest development in temporally and spatially controlled fashion. Future investigations into coordinated network of transcription factors and activating and repressing epigenetic factors are needed to generate new insight about molecular control of neural crest development in vertebrates.
