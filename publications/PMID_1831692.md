Previously we described joining of DNA in the beta T cell receptor gene to DNA 
of an uncharacterized locus in a t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) chromosomal translocation 
from a case of human T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We now show that the 
locus on chromosome 9 contains a gene highly homologous to the Drosophila gene 
Notch. Transcripts of the human gene, for which we propose the name TAN-1, and 
its murine counterpart are present in many normal human fetal and adult mouse 
tissues, but are most abundant in lymphoid tissues. In t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) 
translocations from three cases of T-ALL, the breakpoints occur within 100 bp of 
an intron in TAN-1, resulting in truncation of TAN-1 transcripts. These 
observations suggest that TAN-1 may be important for normal lymphocyte function 
and that alteration of TAN-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of some T cell 
neoplasms.
