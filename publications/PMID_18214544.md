Of the nine known members of the CCR4-NOT complex, CCR4/CAF1 are most important 
in mRNA deadenylation whereas the NOT1-5 proteins are most critical for 
transcriptional repression. Whole genome microarray analysis using deletions in 
seven of the CCR4-NOT genes was used to determine the overall mRNA expression 
patterns that are affected by members of the yeast CCR4-NOT complex. Under 
glucose conditions, ccr4 and caf1 displayed a high degree of similarity in the 
manner that they affected gene expression. In contrast, the not deletions were 
similar in the way they affected genes, but showed no correlation with that of 
ccr4/caf1. A number of groups of functionally related proteins were specifically 
controlled by the CCR4/CAF1 or NOT modules. Importantly, the NOT proteins 
preferentially affected SAGA-controlled gene expression. Also, both the 
CCR4/CAF1 and NOT group of proteins shared much greater similarities in their 
effects on gene expression during the stress of glucose deprivation. BTT1, a 
member of the nascent polypeptide association complex that binds the ribosome, 
was shown to be a tenth member of the CCR4-NOT complex, interacting through 
CAF130. Microarray analysis indicated that BTT1 and CAF130 correlate very highly 
in their control of gene expression and preferentially repress genes involved in 
ribosome biogenesis. These results indicate that distinct portions of the 
CCR4-NOT complex control a number of different cellular processes.
