For characterizing in vivo functions of a mammalian protein, it is informative 
to obtain conditional mutations and apply them to the mouse genetic system. 
However, the isolation of conditional mutations has been quite difficult in 
cultured cells. We report here that functional expression of a heterologous 
mammalian gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a system for 
isolating mutated genes. We found that the cloned mouse TOP2 alpha cDNA, which 
encodes mouse DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) alpha, could rescue the lethal 
phenotype caused by yeast top2 null mutation. In order to generate and select 
temperature-sensitive mouse topo II alpha, an expression plasmid was mutagenized 
in vitro and was transformed, using the plasmid shuffling method, into the yeast 
strain, in which the endogenous TOP2 gene had been disrupted. We observed that 
one of such clone of yeast cells harboring a mutagenized mouse TOP2 alpha showed 
temperature-sensitive growth. Enzymatic assays and sequencing analysis revealed 
that this phenotype was caused by the thermosensitive nature of the mutant mouse 
protein, which has isoleucine at amino acid 961 instead of threonine. Therefore 
we have isolated the first conditional mutation in the mouse TOP2 alpha.
