Odorant detection is specifically mediated via receptor neurons in the olfactory 
mucosa but is a complex process involving a number of different cell types 
producing proteins of differing function. We have used the technique of 
subtractive hybridization cDNA cloning to identify novel genes expressed 
exclusively in the olfactory mucosa which may play a role in olfaction. Ten 
distinct groups of cDNA clones were identified which corresponded to mRNA 
transcripts highly expressed in rat olfactory mucosa but undetectable in thymus, 
kidney, lung, brain, spleen and liver. Some of these clones identify 
substructures in the mucosal tissue for which no other probes are currently 
available. Others identify novel mRNA species in the Bowman's glands. The 
predicted proteins for three of these clones are homologous to proteins which 
bind to either lipopolysaccharides (RYA3 and RY2G5) or to polychlorinated 
biphenyls (RYD5). In addition, while RYA3 and RY2G5 are highly homologous, they 
appear to be expressed in different parts of the mucosal tissue. The sequence 
homologies and subanatomical location of expression suggest that these proteins 
might interact with odorants before or after specific recognition by odorant 
receptors. Therefore, the olfactory mucosa may possess diverse, 
functionally-distinct odorant-binding proteins which recognize and bind separate 
classes of odorants.
