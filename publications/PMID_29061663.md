The bacterium Bacillus subtilis is capable of two kinds of flagellum-mediated 
motility: swimming, which occurs in liquid, and swarming, which occurs on a 
surface. Swarming is distinct from swimming in that it requires secretion of a 
surfactant, an increase in flagellar density, and perhaps additional factors. 
Here we report a new gene, swrD, located within the 32 gene fla-che operon 
dedicated to flagellar biosynthesis and chemotaxis, which when mutated abolished 
swarming motility. SwrD was not required for surfactant production, flagellar 
gene expression, or an increase in flagellar number. Instead, SwrD was required 
to increase flagellar power. Mutation of swrD reduced swimming speed and torque 
of tethered flagella, and all swrD-related phenotypes were restored when the 
stator subunits MotA and MotB were overexpressed either by spontaneous 
suppressor mutations or by artificial induction. We conclude that swarming 
motility requires flagellar power in excess of that which is needed to 
swim.IMPORTANCE Bacteria swim in liquid and swarm over surfaces by rotating 
flagella, but the difference between swimming and swarming is poorly understood. 
Here we report that SwrD of Bacillus subtilis is necessary for swarming because 
it increases flagellar torque and cells mutated for swrD swim with reduced 
speed. How flagellar motors generate power is primarily studied in Escherichia 
coli, and SwrD likely increases power in other organisms, like the Firmicutes, 
Clostridia, Spirochaetes, and the Deltaproteobacteria.
