Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare metabolic 
diseases, due to impaired protein and lipid glycosylation. We identified two 
patients with defective serum transferrin glycosylation and mutations in the 
MAGT1 gene. These patients present with a phenotype that is mainly characterized 
by intellectual and developmental disability. MAGT1 has been described to be a 
subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and more specifically of 
the STT3B complex. However, it was also claimed that MAGT1 is a magnesium (Mg2+) 
transporter. So far, patients with mutations in MAGT1 were linked to a primary 
immunodeficiency, characterized by chronic EBV infections attributed to a Mg2+ 
homeostasis defect (XMEN). We compared the clinical and cellular phenotype of 
our two patients to that of an XMEN patient that we recently identified. All 
three patients have an N-glycosylation defect, as was shown by the study of 
different substrates, such as GLUT1 and SHBG, demonstrating that the 
posttranslational glycosylation carried out by the STT3B complex is 
dysfunctional in all three patients. Moreover, MAGT1 deficiency is associated 
with an enhanced expression of TUSC3, the homolog protein of MAGT1, pointing 
toward a compensatory mechanism. Hence, we delineate MAGT1-CDG as a disorder 
associated with two different clinical phenotypes caused by defects in 
glycosylation.
