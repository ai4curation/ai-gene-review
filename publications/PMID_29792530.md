Manganese (Mn) toxicity arises from nutritional problems, community and 
occupational exposures, and genetic risks. Mn blood levels are controlled by 
hepatobiliary clearance. The goals of this study were to determine the cellular 
distribution of Mn transporters in polarized hepatocytes, to establish an in 
vitro assay for hepatocyte Mn efflux, and to examine possible roles the Mn 
transporters would play in metal import and export. For these experiments, 
hepatocytoma WIF-B cells were grown for 12-14 days to achieve maximal polarity. 
Immunoblots showed that Mn transporters ZIP8, ZnT10, ferroportin (Fpn), and 
ZIP14 were present. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy localized Fpn and 
ZIP14 to WIF-B cell basolateral domains whereas ZnT10 and ZIP8 associated with 
intracellular vesicular compartments. ZIP8-positive structures were distributed 
uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, but ZnT10-positive vesicles were adjacent to 
apical bile compartments. WIF-B cells were sensitive to Mn toxicity, showing 
decreased viability after 16 h exposure to >250 μM MnCl2. However, the 
hepatocytes were resistant to 4-h exposures of up to 500 μM MnCl2 despite 
50-fold increased Mn content. Washout experiments showed time-dependent efflux 
with 80% Mn released after a 4 h chase period. Hepcidin reduced levels of Fpn in 
WIF-B cells, clearing Fpn from the cell surface, but Mn efflux was unaffected. 
The secretory inhibitor, brefeldin A, did block release of Mn from WIF-B cells, 
suggesting vesicle fusion may be involved in export. These results point to a 
possible role of ZnT10 to import Mn into vesicles that subsequently fuse with 
the apical membrane and empty their contents into bile. NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
Polarized WIF-B hepatocytes express manganese (Mn) transporters ZIP8, ZnT10, 
ferroportin (Fpn), and ZIP14. Fpn and ZIP14 localize to basolateral domains. 
ZnT10-positive vesicles were adjacent to apical bile compartments, and 
ZIP8-positive vesicles were distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm. 
WIF-B hepatocyte Mn export was resistant to hepcidin but inhibited by brefeldin 
A, pointing to an efflux mechanism involving ZnT10-mediated uptake of Mn into 
vesicles that subsequently fuse with and empty their contents across the apical 
bile canalicular membrane.
