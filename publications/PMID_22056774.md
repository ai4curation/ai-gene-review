Abstract

Herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin specific protease (HAUSP) regulates the stability of p53 and MDM2, implicating HAUSP as a therapeutic target for tuning p53-mediated anti-tumor activity. Here, we report the structural analysis of HAUSP with Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus vIRF4 and the discovery of two vIRF4-derived peptides, vif1 and vif2, as potent and selective HAUSP antagonists. This analysis reveals a bilateral belt-type interaction resulting in inhibition of HAUSP. The vif1 peptide binds the HAUSP TRAF domain, competitively blocking substrate binding, while the vif2 peptide binds both the HAUSP TRAF and catalytic domains, robustly suppressing its deubiquitination activity. Consequently, peptide treatments comprehensively blocked HAUSP, leading to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in culture and tumor regression in xenograft mouse model. Thus, the virus has developed a unique molecular strategy to target the HAUSP-MDM2-p53 pathway, and these virus-derived short peptides represent biologically active HAUSP antagonists.

DISCUSSION

In order to bypass interferon (IFN)- and p53-mediated irreversible cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and complete its life cycle, KSHV has developed a unique mechanism for antagonizing cellular IFN- and p53-mediated host innate immune responses by incorporating viral homologues of cellular IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), called viral IFN regulatory factors (vIRFs). KSHV encodes four vIRFs in a cluster region that have two common biological functions that contribute to host immune evasion: the inhibition of host IFN-mediated innate immunity and the deregulation of p53-mediated tumor suppressive activity 34 , 35 . We previously reported that KSHV vIRF4 interacts with MDM2 through its C-terminal region, leading to the inhibition of MDM2 auto-ubiquitination and stabilization of its protein levels, thus enhancing MDM2-mediated p53 degradation 20 . Here, we show that vIRF4’s actions with HAUSP and MDM2 are functionally and genetically separable, and that the vIRF4-MDM2 interaction has a more significant role in downregulating p53 than the vIRF4-HAUSP interaction. Thus, KSHV vIRF4 has evolved to target two components, MDM2 and HAUSP, of the p53 pathway to comprehensively suppress p53 function. This suggests that vIRF4 affects p53 tumor suppressor-mediated surveillance in a similar but distinct way from other viral proteins such as the EBV EBNA1. Finally, it should be noted that vIRF4 circumvents host growth surveillance to enhance viral replication in infected cells in a manner reminiscent of HSV ICP0 and EBV EBNA1, which also direct HAUSP to promote viral replication and oncogenic processes, respectively 7 , 15 . Thus, HAUSP appears to be a common host target for human herpesviruses to support their lifecycle and pathogenesis, and is hence considered to be a potential target for anti-viral therapy.

Using crystal structure analysis facilitated by in situ proteolysis, together with ITC assessment, we demonstrate that while KSHV vIRF4 (residues ~210–216) binds to the same surface groove of the HAUSP TRAF domain as that recognized by MDM2 and p53, it employs a different HAUSP interaction strategy from MDM2 and p53. Besides residues 210–216, vIRF4 utilizes an additional, short upstream region (residues 202–208) to interact extensively with the other side of the TRAF domain β-sheet, especially the β6 strand ( Fig. 2a,b ). It is this extra interaction property of vIRF4 that results in a much higher binding affinity to the HAUSP TRAF domain than MDM2 and p53.

Interestingly, in a study using a comparably designed peptide EBNA1 435–449 containing the P/A××S motif and sequences equivalent to the vIRF4 upstream region, EBV EBNA1 435–449 showed a very similar HAUSP TRAF binding affinity ( K d of 0.48 µM) to that of the vIRF4 202–216 peptide ( K d of 0.39 µM) ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ). However, NMR chemical shift mapping analysis demonstrated that, unlike the vIRF4 peptide, the EBNA1 sequences corresponding to the upstream region of the vIRF4 peptide did not affect its interaction with the HAUSP TRAF domain 15 . This result suggests that KSHV vIRF4 and EBV EBNA1 target HAUSP in similar but distinct manners. It is worth noting that EBNA1 is the only HAUSP TRAF binding substrate that has a charged side chain residue Glu 444 at the position of “P/A” in the motif P/A××S motif ( Supplementary Fig. 1b and Fig. 2b ). This residue seems to be critical for how EBNA1 attains a remarkably higher HAUSP TRAF binding affinity than cellular substrates as the Glu 444 side chain interacts with the backbone amide and carbonyl group of Ser 155 and Arg 153 on the β6 strand, respectively, through bridging water molecules, as well as with the indole nitrogen of TRAF Trp 165 ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ). Moreover, EBNA1 employs four backbone-backbone interactions with the Trp 165 -Asn 169 residues on the TRAF β7 strand ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ) while cellular substrates utilize only two main chains to interact with the same TRAF strand (data not shown). As a consequence, the intelligently evolved EBNA1 peptide may compete with cellular substrates although they employ similar HAUSP TRAF binding patterns ( Fig. 2b ). These competences of EBNA1 may collectively result in a comparable effect as that seen with vIRF4 202–216 to manage HAUSP interactions with cellular substrates. Furthermore, independently of its inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis, the EBNA1-HAUSP interaction is also involved in PML disruption to promote the survival of cells with DNA damages 36 . Thus, two human gamma herpesviruses have evolved to target and deregulate HAUSP function and its related pathways, but the consequences of their action may be significantly different.

Along with the structure of the HAUSP TRAF-DUB domain 13 , our ITC, NMR, and deubiquitinase enzyme analyses suggest that a peptide, approximately 17-amino-acids (residues 216 to 232) in length, may be sufficiently long enough to stretch from the TRAF domain to the DUB domain of HAUSP, while additional sequences around residues 232–236 may directly contact the catalytic core site of HAUSP, resulting in the robust inhibition of its enzymatic activity. Due to these exceptional properties of vIRF4, the vif1 and vif2 peptides clearly posses two provocative and effective strategies that make them specific and robust HAUSP antagonists: the vif1 peptide binds to the HAUSP TRAF domain with the highest affinity among all reported substrates, blocking the TRAF binding by cellular substrates, whereas the vif2 peptide appears to loosely bind the TRAF domain and the active catalytic site of the DUB domain of HAUSP, suppressing its DUB enzymatic activity. Consequently, vif1 and vif2 peptides comprehensively suppress HAUSP activity, effectively restore p53-dependent apoptosis in wild-type p53-carrying cancer cells, and suppress tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Our study provides unquestionable evidence that the vif1 and vif2 peptides are not only ideal for abolishing HAUSP activity, but also demonstrates that they have the potential to be therapeutically beneficial reagents against p53 wild-type tumors. However, we should stress that the vIRF4 peptides studied here do not reflect the authentic biology of full-length vIRF4, which targets both HAUSP and MDM2 to comprehensively inactivate host p53-mediated surveillance. Thus, the therapeutic exploitation of the vIRF4 peptides as HAUSP inhibitors should be uncoupled from the biological function of vIRF4 as a survival factor against host’s immune surveillance programs.

Of importance, since HAUSP contains a well-conserved catalytic core domain, it should therefore be a more tractable drug target than blocking the p53-MDM2-MDMX interaction. This is underscored by recent findings showing that HAUSP can be used to therapeutically target p53-independent apoptosis responses in certain tumors. For instance, the loss of HAUSP in colorectal cancer cells potentiates apoptotic cell death by inducing proteasomal degradation of DNMT1, further compounding the potential of HAUSP inhibition as an effective anti-cancer therapy 37 – 40 . Accordingly, because we cannot exclude the possibility that HAUSP regulates the function of other known or yet unknown substrates involved in p53-independent apoptosis, our peptides may have additional off-target, p53-independent pro-apoptotic effects.

In summary, our study shows that vIRF4-derived short vif1 and vif2 peptides comprehensively suppress HAUSP activity, effectively restoring p53-dependent apoptosis in wild-type p53-carrying cancer cells and suppressing tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Of especial importance, we herein report that the vif1 and vif2 peptides represent potential novel chemotherapeutic molecules for anti-cancer therapies.
