Previous studies have suggested that human and porcine insulin exert identical 
effects on blood glucose and counter-regulatory hormones but elicit different 
neurophysiological reactions. A major goal of the present study was to 
investigate whether this could be caused by different relative affinities of the 
insulins from different species to insulin receptors from the brain compared to 
other tissues. Insulin receptors isolated from human brain, muscle or adipocytes 
as well as from cultured cells over-expressing either of the human insulin 
receptor isoforms (exon 11- or exon 11 +) were immobilized to microwells coated 
with monoclonal anti-insulin receptor antibody. Subsequently the binding of 
human, porcine and bovine insulin was measured. While the receptors derived from 
the different tissues had different affinities for insulin, there were no 
tissue-specific differences in the relative binding of the insulins of the three 
species. The insulins of the three species were also not different with regard 
to their binding to the receptor isoforms. Finally, in human brain homogenates 
no differences in the degradation rates for human, porcine and bovine insulin 
were detected. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis that different 
neurophysiological reactions during hypoglycaemia due to human or porcine 
insulin are caused by differences of the binding of the insulins to human brain 
insulin receptors or their degradation in the human brain.
