The functions of the SAGA and SWI/SNF complexes are interrelated and can form 
stable "epigenetic marks" on promoters in vivo. Here we show that stable 
promoter occupancy by SWI/SNF and SAGA in the absence of transcription 
activators requires the bromodomains of the Swi2/Snf2 and Gcn5 subunits, 
respectively, and nucleosome acetylation. This acetylation can be brought about 
by either the SAGA or NuA4 HAT complexes. The bromodomain in the Spt7 subunit of 
SAGA is dispensable for this activity but will anchor SAGA if it is swapped into 
Gcn5, indicating that specificity of bromodomain function is determined in part 
by the subunit it occupies. Thus, bromodomains within the catalytic subunits of 
SAGA and SWI/SNF anchor these complexes to acetylated promoter nucleosomes.
