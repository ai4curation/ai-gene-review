The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cyclic 
AMP-regulated Cl(-) channel expressed in the apical plasma membrane in 
fluid-transporting epithelia. Although CFTR is rapidly endocytosed from the 
apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells and efficiently recycled back to 
the plasma membrane, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating 
CFTR endocytosis and endocytic recycling. Myosin VI, an actin-dependent, 
minus-end directed mechanoenzyme, has been implicated in clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis in epithelial cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether 
myosin VI regulates CFTR endocytosis. Endogenous, apical membrane CFTR in 
polarized human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3) formed a complex with myosin 
VI, the myosin VI adaptor protein Disabled 2 (Dab2), and clathrin. The tail 
domain of myosin VI, a dominant-negative recombinant fragment, displaced 
endogenous myosin VI from interacting with Dab2 and CFTR and increased the 
expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane by reducing CFTR endocytosis. However, 
the myosin VI tail fragment had no effect on the recycling of endocytosed CFTR 
or on fluid-phase endocytosis. CFTR endocytosis was decreased by cytochalasin D, 
an actin-filament depolymerizing agent. Taken together, these data indicate that 
myosin VI and Dab2 facilitate CFTR endocytosis by a mechanism that requires 
actin filaments.
