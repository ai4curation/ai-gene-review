Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have 
identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a 
mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally 
inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to 
the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the 
lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death 
domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB 
cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, 
a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings 
suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction 
of Fas.
