The core promoter is a critical DNA element required for accurate transcription 
and regulation of transcription. Several core promoter elements have been 
previously identified in eukaryotes, but those cannot account for transcription 
from most RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes. Additional, as-yet-unidentified 
core promoter elements must be present in eukaryotic genomes. From extensive 
analyses of the hepatitis B virus X gene promoter, here we identify a new core 
promoter element, XCPE1 (the X gene core promoter element 1), that drives RNA 
polymerase II transcription. XCPE1 is located between nucleotides -8 and +2 
relative to the transcriptional start site (+1) and has a consensus sequence of 
G/A/T-G/C-G-T/C-G-G-G/A-A-G/C(+1)-A/C. XCPE1 shows fairly weak transcriptional 
activity alone but exerts significant, specific promoter activity when 
accompanied by activator-binding sites. XCPE1 is also found in the core promoter 
regions of about 1% of human genes, particularly in poorly characterized 
TATA-less genes. Our in vitro transcription studies suggest that the 
XCPE1-driven transcription can be highly active in the absence of TFIID because 
it can utilize either free TBP or the complete TFIID complex. Our findings 
suggest the possibility of the existence of a TAF1 (TFIID)-independent 
transcriptional initiation mechanism that may be used by a category of TATA-less 
promoters in higher eukaryotes.
