Using Cre/loxP, we conditionally inactivated the beta-catenin gene in cells of 
structures that exhibit important embryonic organizer functions: the visceral 
endoderm, the node, the notochord, and the definitive endoderm. Mesoderm 
formation was not affected in the mutant embryos, but the node was missing, 
patterning of the head and trunk was affected, and no notochord or somites were 
formed. Surprisingly, deletion of beta-catenin in the definitive endoderm led to 
the formation of multiple hearts all along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis of 
the embryo. Ectopic hearts developed in parallel with the normal heart in 
regions of ectopic Bmp2 expression. We provide evidence that ablation of 
beta-catenin in embryonic endoderm changes cell fate from endoderm to precardiac 
mesoderm, consistent with the existence of bipotential mesendodermal progenitors 
in mouse embryos.
