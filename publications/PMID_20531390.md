Non-cell-autonomous effect of mutant proteins expressed in glia has been 
implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders, whereas molecules mediating 
the toxicity are currently not known. We identified a novel molecule named 
multiple alpha-helix protein located at ER (Maxer) downregulated by mutant 
ataxin-1 (Atx1) in Bergmann glia. Maxer is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
membrane protein interacting with CDK5RAP3. Maxer anchors CDK5RAP3 to the ER and 
inhibits its function of Cyclin D1 transcription repression in the nucleus. The 
loss of Maxer eventually induces cell accumulation at G1 phase. It was also 
shown that mutant Atx1 represses Maxer and inhibits proliferation of Bergmann 
glia in vitro. Consistently, Bergmann glia are reduced in the cerebellum of 
mutant Atx1 knockin mice before onset. Glutamate-aspartate transporter reduction 
in Bergmann glia by mutant Atx1 and vulnerability of Purkinje cell to glutamate 
are both strengthened by Maxer knockdown in Bergmann glia, whereas Maxer 
overexpression rescues them. Collectively, these results suggest that the 
reduction of Maxer mediates functional deficiency of Bergmann glia, and might 
contribute to the non-cell-autonomous pathology of SCA1.

Non-cell-autonomous effect of mutant proteins expressed in glia has been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders, whereas molecules mediating the toxicity are currently not known. We identified a novel molecule named m ultiple α-heli x protein located at ER (Maxer) downregulated by mutant ataxin-1 (Atx1) in Bergmann glia. Maxer is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein interacting with CDK5RAP3. Maxer anchors CDK5RAP3 to the ER and inhibits its function of Cyclin D1 transcription repression in the nucleus. The loss of Maxer eventually induces cell accumulation at G1 phase. It was also shown that mutant Atx1 represses Maxer and inhibits proliferation of Bergmann glia in vitro.

Collectively, these results suggest that the reduction of Maxer mediates functional deficiency of Bergmann glia, and might contribute to the non-cell-autonomous pathology of SCA1.

Introduction

Effects of the non-neuronal expression of mutant proteins have been implicated in the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders including ALS ( Di Giorgio et al, 2007 ; Nagai et al, 2007 ; Yamanaka et al, 2008a , 2008b ), Huntington's disease ( Shin et al, 2005 ; Lievens et al, 2008 ; Tamura et al, 2009 ) and spinocerebellar ataxias ( Kretzschmar et al, 2005 ; Custer et al, 2006 ; Tamura et al, 2009 ). Astrocytes and microglia are suspected to have a central function in the ALS pathology ( Lobsiger and Cleveland, 2007 ). Glutamate toxicity mediated by Bergmann glia was proposed in the SCA7 pathology by a recent report ( Custer et al, 2006 ), whereas details of the non-cell-autonomous pathology in neurodegenerative disorders remain largely unknown. Glial endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequent hypofunction of glutamate uptake as well as secretion of toxic signals including superoxide are suggested (reviewed by Ilieva et al, 2009 ). However, molecules mediating the non-cell-autonomous pathology in glia and neurons are not completely determined, and additional mechanisms in glia and neurons are also possible.

In a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), expression of mutant ataxin-1 (Atx1) for the first 3 weeks after birth remarkably influences the symptoms observed later in adulthood ( Serra et al, 2006 ). It corresponds well to the critical period for cerebellar development when external granule cells and Bergmann glia are actively proliferating to form tissue architecture ( Basco et al, 1977 ; Shiga et al, 1983 ; Goldowitz and Hamre, 1998 ). In the SCA7 mouse model, ataxin-7 (Atx7) expression in Bergmann glia that is located adjacent to Purkinje cells also induces neurodegeneration of Purkinje cells through perturbation of reuptake of glutamate by Bergmann glia ( Custer et al, 2006 ).

The results in different SCA models suggest that proliferation and/or dysfunction of Bergmann glia might have an intriguing function in the fate of Purkinje cells in adulthood. Although functions of Bergmann glia in developing and mature brains have not been elucidated completely, they are considered to guide neuronal migration with their radial fibres ( Yamada and Watanabe, 2002 ) similar to radial glia in the cerebral cortex. Bergmann glia are also suspected to act as stem cells because they express a stem cell marker Sox2 ( Sottile et al, 2006 ) and have been shown to proliferate ( Gaiano and Fishell, 2002 ; Yamada and Watanabe, 2002 ). The earlier study used the gfa2 enhancer to drive Atx7 ( Custer et al, 2006 ), which is more active in proliferating glia, hence Bergmann glia proliferation, as well as their glutamate uptake, might be involved in the pathology.

Beyond the function of protein synthesis, ER was recently reported to have a critical function in the cell cycle regulation ( Fearon and Cohen-Fix, 2008 ). For instance, G1 cyclin Cln3 is retained and bound to ER at early G1 phase, whereas it relocates to the nucleus at late G1 phase and contributes to initiation of S phase ( Verges et al, 2007 ). SCAPER, a novel ER protein, is shown to regulate G1/S transition and M phase through interaction with cyclin A/Cdk2 at multiple phases of the cell cycle ( Tsang et al, 2007 ).

From expression profiling analyses with primary neurons expressing mutant polyglutamine proteins ( Tagawa et al, 2007 ), we unexpectedly found an ER protein, designated as m ultiple α-heli x protein located at ER (Maxer) that has a critical function in G1/S transition and regulates cell proliferation. Maxer interacts with CDK5RAP3 (also known as LZAP and C53), a putative tumour suppressor ( Wang et al, 2007 ), regulates subcellular localization of CDK5RAP3, and affects the expression level of Cyclin D1 through CDK5RAP3. Maxer is expressed at a high level in Bergmann glia of the cerebellum from perinatal period to adulthood. Maxer co-expression and RNAi-mediated knockdown rescuers and enhances, respectively, mutant Atx1-induced pathologies of primary Bergmann glia and Purkinje cells. In keeping with this, SCA1 model mice exhibited reduction of Bergmann glia that precedes decrease of Purkinje cells. Collectively, these results indicate that Maxer is a new type of cell cycle regulator at ER-like SCAPER, and suggest that Maxer might be involved in the SCA1 pathology through functional deficiency of Bergmann glia.

Discussion

In this study, we identified a novel ER membrane protein that affects G1/S transition through regulation of nuclear translocation of CDK5RAP3. Maxer belongs to a new category of ER proteins that regulate the cell cycle (reviewed by Fearon and Cohen-Fix, 2008 ). As far as we know, Maxer is the third molecule of this category after Cln3 and SCAPER ( Fearon and Cohen-Fix, 2008 ). Translocation of G1 cyclin Cln3 from ER to nucleus regulates initiation of S phase ( Verges et al, 2007 ), whereas the molecule anchoring Cln3 is not yet known. SCAPER retains cyclin A in the cytoplasm ( Tsang et al, 2007 ). Depletion of SCAPER decreases the cytoplasmic pool of cyclin A and delays G1/S transition, whereas ectopic expression of SCAPER inhibits M phase ( Tsang et al, 2007 ). The function of Maxer seems homologous to that of SCAPER controlling nuclear translocation of a cell cycle regulatory protein. Meanwhile, the specific effect of Maxer on G1/S transition is different from that of SCAPER affecting both G1/S transition and M phase ( Tsang et al, 2007 ).

Maxer was reduced in Bergmann glia of mutant Atx1-KI mice ( Figure 2D ). Bergmann glia morphologically mimic radial glia that act as stem cells in the cerebral cortex. Thus, Bergmann glia have been suspected to be actually stem cells in the cerebellum ( Gaiano and Fishell, 2002 ; Alcock et al, 2007 ), although no direct proof has been reported. They express stem cell marker proteins such as Sox 1 and Sox2 ( Sottile et al, 2006 ) and share the Notch-mediated differentiation mechanism with neural stem cells ( Eiraku et al, 2005 ). Most importantly, Bergmann glia proliferate until the second postnatal week ( Basco et al, 1977 ; Shiga et al, 1983 ; Gaiano and Fishell, 2002 ; Yamada and Watanabe, 2002 ), and this time point corresponds well to the critical period for the SCA1 pathology reported by the Orr group ( Serra et al, 2006 ). As Bergmann glia remain in the adult brain, in addition to the developmental proliferation, a low level of proliferation after birth might be necessary to keep a certain cell number sufficient for their function in the adult cerebellum, just similar to hippocampal neural progenitor cells that keep proliferation at a low level in adulthood.

It is widely accepted that cell-autonomous effect of mutant Atx1 in Purkinje cells has a central function in SCA1 pathology. Molecular functions of Atx1 have been intensively analysed and its interactions with Capicua ( Lam et al, 2006 ) and RBM17 ( Lim et al, 2008 ) have been shown to have critical functions in SCA1 pathology. These molecules are suggested to be involved in splicing such as PQBP1, another candidate molecule in SCA1 pathology that interacts with a splicing factor, U5-15kD ( Waragai et al, 2000 ; Zhang et al, 2000 ; Okazawa et al, 2002 ). It is well known that splicing is coupled closely to transcription. Thus, either transcriptional or post-transcriptional control of certain target genes is implicated in SCA1 pathology.

On the other hand, the significance of Bergmann glia in the cerebellar degeneration pathology was found in the SCA7 pathology by the La Spada group ( Custer et al, 2006 ). Their impressive data suggested that dysfunction of Bergmann glia might impair glutamate reuptake and induce excitatory toxicity. Our results support their hypothesis, as well as further expanding the Bergmann glia hypothesis to another type of SCA, SCA1. Moreover, we identified a novel molecule, Maxer, which could be involved in the non-cell-autonomous pathway.

Regarding the reduction of GLAST, we found the discrepancy between reduction of Bergmann glia number and GLAST signal intensity ( Figure 6D ). We also found in WB that reduction of GLAST is higher than reduction of Sox2 ( Figure 6C and E ). Figure 7C supported that GLAST signal/Bergmann glia was decreased. Thus, both Bergmann glia cell number and GLAST expression per Bergmann glia contributed to the decrease of GLAST by Maxer reduction. The Atx1-induced Maxer reduction and the rescue effect of Maxer against Atx1 neurotoxicity suggest that Maxer could be a downstream effector of mutant Atx1. However, definite proof requires the generation of Bergmann glia-specific conditional KO mice of Maxer and Bergmann glia-specific transgenic mice of Maxer and for their genetic effect on Atx1-KI mice.

Considering that CDK5RAP3 is a binding partner of p35, an essential activator of CDK5 ( Ching et al, 2000 ) and that CDK5 is involved in the terminal cell cycle exit, differentiation and migration of neural stem cells in developmental brain ( Cicero and Herrup, 2005 ; Kawauchi et al, 2006 ), the function of Maxer and CDK5RAP3 in neuronal differentiation would be worth testing. Especially in the Atx1-KI mice, Maxer's function in neural stem cells should be carefully estimated, as downregulation of Maxer is not significant in pre-differentiated neural stem cells in comparison with that in Bergmann glia (data not shown).

Finally, although it is not clear at this moment how mutant Atx1 reduces Maxer, molecular functions of Atx1-interacting molecules ( Waragai et al, 2000 ; Zhang et al, 2000 ; Okazawa et al, 2002 ; Lam et al, 2006 ; Lim et al, 2008 ) might suggest that Maxer is one of the target genes of Atx1 whose transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation is affected by mutant Atx1.

In conclusion, we discovered a novel type of ER membrane protein regulating cell cycle through G1/S transition, which might participate in the SCA1 pathology through its functions in Bergmann glia.
