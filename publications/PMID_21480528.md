Both fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and proximity ligation assay 
(PLA) are techniques used in the investigation of protein interactions but the 
latter has not been evaluated in a systematic way, prompting us to compare their 
performance quantitatively. Proteins were labeled with oligonucleotide- or 
fluorophore-conjugated antibodies and their proximity was analyzed by flow 
cytometry in order to obtain statistically robust data. Both intermolecular and 
intramolecular PLA signals reached saturation at high expression levels. At the 
same time, the FRET efficiency was independent of, while the FRET signal 
exhibited a strict linear correlation with the expression levels of proteins. 
When the density of oligonucleotide- and fluorophore-conjugated antibodies was 
systematically changed by competition with unlabeled antibodies the FRET signal 
was linearly proportional to the amount of bound fluorophore-tagged antibodies, 
whereas the PLA signal was again saturated. The saturation phenomenon in PLA 
could not be eliminated by decreasing the duration of the rolling circle 
amplification reaction. Our data imply that PLA is a semiquantitative measure of 
protein colocalizations due to non-linear effects in the reaction and that 
caution should be exercised when interpreting PLA data in a quantitative way.
