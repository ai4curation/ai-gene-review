Density-enhanced phosphatase-1 (DEP-1) is a trans-membrane receptor 
protein-tyrosine phosphatase that plays a recognized prominent role as a tumor 
suppressor. However, the mechanistic details underlying its function are poorly 
understood because its primary physiological substrate(s) have not been firmly 
established. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative 
role of this phosphatase, we set out to identify new DEP-1 substrates by a novel 
approach based on screening of high density peptide arrays. The results of the 
array experiment were combined with a bioinformatics filter to identify eight 
potential DEP-1 targets among the proteins annotated in the MAPK pathway. In 
this study we show that one of these potential targets, the ERK1/2, is indeed a 
direct DEP-1 substrate in vivo. Pulldown and in vitro dephosphorylation assays 
confirmed our prediction and demonstrated an overall specificity of DEP-1 in 
targeting the phosphorylated tyrosine 204 of ERK1/2. After epidermal growth 
factor stimulation, the phosphorylation of the activation loop of ERK1/2 can be 
modulated by changing the concentration of DEP-1, without affecting the activity 
of the upstream kinase MEK. In addition, we show that DEP-1 contains a KIM-like 
motif to recruit ERK1/2 proteins by a docking mechanism mediated by the common 
docking domain in ERK1/2. ERK proteins that are mutated in the conserved docking 
domain become insensitive to DEP-1 de-phosphorylation. Overall this study 
provides novel insights into the anti-proliferative role of this phosphatase and 
proposes a new mechanism that may also be relevant for the regulation of 
density-dependent growth inhibition.

Abstract

Density-enhanced phosphatase-1 (DEP-1) is a trans-membrane receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase that plays a recognized prominent role as a tumor suppressor. However, the mechanistic details underlying its function are poorly understood because its primary physiological substrate(s) have not been firmly established. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative role of this phosphatase, we set out to identify new DEP-1 substrates by a novel approach based on screening of high density peptide arrays. The results of the array experiment were combined with a bioinformatics filter to identify eight potential DEP-1 targets among the proteins annotated in the MAPK pathway. In this study we show that one of these potential targets, the ERK1/2, is indeed a direct DEP-1 substrate in vivo . Pulldown and in vitro dephosphorylation assays confirmed our prediction and demonstrated an overall specificity of DEP-1 in targeting the phosphorylated tyrosine 204 of ERK1/2. After epidermal growth factor stimulation, the phosphorylation of the activation loop of ERK1/2 can be modulated by changing the concentration of DEP-1, without affecting the activity of the upstream kinase MEK. In addition, we show that DEP-1 contains a KIM-like motif to recruit ERK1/2 proteins by a docking mechanism mediated by the common docking domain in ERK1/2. ERK proteins that are mutated in the conserved docking domain become insensitive to DEP-1 de-phosphorylation. Overall this study provides novel insights into the anti-proliferative role of this phosphatase and proposes a new mechanism that may also be relevant for the regulation of density-dependent growth inhibition.

DISCUSSION

Over the past decade evidence has been accumulating that DEP-1 is a tumor suppressor that potently inhibits cell proliferation ( 6 – 8 , 10 , 29 ). The anti-proliferative role of this phosphatase has been correlated with its ability to dephosphorylate receptor tyrosine kinases, including PDGFR, MET, and VEGFR2 ( 11 – 13 ). Nevertheless, it could not be excluded that the inactivation of different DEP-1 substrates, more downstream in the MAPK pathway, could play an equivalent or even more prominent role in regulating cell proliferation. Our phosphoproteome-wide screening of DEP-1 targets uncovered seven new potential substrates, functionally associated with the RAS-MAPK pathway. Among the putative new substrates, ERK1/2 attracted our attention because of its central role in propagating receptor kinase proliferation signals. Here we have provided compelling evidence that ERK1/2 proteins are modulated by the activity of the DEP-1 protein in vivo after stimulation with EGF.

Until now the role of DEP-1 in the EGF pathway has not received much attention, although DEP-1 is expressed in epithelial cells and may play a role, for instance, in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, where EGF stimulates cell migration, proliferation, and wound closure through the activation of MAPK signaling ( 30 ). In addition, DEP-1 overexpression or knockdown was found to affect cell proliferation and migration in colon epithelial cells, suggesting a possible role of this phosphatase in the modulation of the EGF pathway ( 6 ). Accordingly, we have found that upon EGF induction, DEP-1 markedly dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK1/2 proteins. This activity was not observed when a phosphatase-defective C/S mutant was overexpressed, whereas the D/A trapping mutant displayed a dominant negative effect resulting in ERK1/2 hyper-phosphorylation. Finally, knocking down the expression of endogenous DEP-1 by shRNA also resulted in increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2.

Although DEP-1-mediated negative regulation of the RAS pathway has been attributed to its ability to dephosphorylate receptor tyrosine kinases such as platelet-derived growth factor, MET, or vascular endothelial growth factor, several lines of evidence presented here suggest that the observed negative regulation of ERK1/2 activity, in our experimental system, can be accounted for by a direct dephosphorylation of Tyr-204 in the activation loop of ERK1/2.

First, we have shown that the DEP-1 D/A trapping mutant can bind a synthetic 13-mer peptide centered on phosphorylated Tyr-204 and specifically pulls down ERK1/2 from an EGF-activated cell extract. In the same experiment, other phosphatase domains, although similar in primary sequence, do not bind ERK1/2, thereby attesting to the specificity of the interaction ( Fig. 2 A ). Next, purified activated ERK1/2 proteins were dephosphorylated in vitro by the purified DEP-1 phosphatase domain ( Fig. 3 B ). These results are consistent with a specific interaction between the phosphatase domain of DEP-1 and the Tyr-204 of ERK1/2, which, as a result, is dephosphorylated in vitro and in vivo ( Fig. 4 ). In addition, we show that the upstream kinase MEK is not affected by DEP-1 overexpression and depletion, suggesting that the phosphatase activity acts downstream of MEK ( Fig. 6 ). Consistently, we observe that in an EGF-independent experimental system, DEP-1 is able to dephosphorylate ERK1/2 proteins when they are activated by a constitutively active SRC kinase ( Fig. 5 ).

Although the level of selectivity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases is still being debated, all the experimental systems that we have used to characterize the interaction between DEP-1 and ERK1/2 have demonstrated a certain level of specificity. Among the 15 phosphatases that we have analyzed, only the trapping mutant catalytic domains of DEP-1 and SAP-1 bind ERK1/2 proteins. Similarly in the in vitro dephosphorylation test the catalytic region of PTPβ, which shares the highest sequence homology with DEP-1 ( 31 ), was not able to dephosphorylate ERK1/2 proteins in vitro . In addition, overexpression of TC-PTP did not down-regulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in our system. These results, supporting a substantial level of selectivity, are in accord with the report by Zhang and co-workers ( 32 ) showing that among 11 phosphatases tested, only three enzymes (HE-PTP, PP2A, and MKP3) were able to dephosphorylate ERK1/2 proteins in vitro .

Taken together these results suggest that DEP-1 down-regulates the EGF-activated MAPK pathway through a direct and specific dephosphorylation of Tyr-204 in the activation loop of the ERK1/2 kinases. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that DEP-1 phosphatase also acts on the EGF receptor because the peptide centered on Tyr-998 gave a signal in our peptide array screening. EGF receptor has multiple phosphorylation sites, and we have not been able to detect a decrease of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation upon DEP-1 phosphorylation by probing with a generic anti-phosphotyrosine antibody ( supplemental Fig. 1 ). We also attempted to monitor the formation of complexes with SHC1 and SRC. Both are predicted to bind to phosphorylated Tyr-998 via the Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains. No difference in the formation of these complexes with or without DEP-1 expression was observed ( supplemental Fig. 1 ). However, it must be borne in mind that both proteins have the potential to bind different phosphotyrosine peptides in the cytoplasmic tail of the EGF receptor.

ERK1/2 are key members of MAPK signaling and are activated by the phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine regulatory residues in the kinase domain activation loop ( 33 ). Protein serine/threonine phosphatases, as well as dual specificity phosphatases, are known to be involved in the inactivation of MAPKs by dephosphorylating their phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine regulatory residues ( 34 , 35 ). However, because dephosphorylation of the regulatory tyrosine residue is sufficient to inactivate ERK1/2, a crucial role for protein-tyrosine phosphatases has been proposed ( 36 , 37 ). For instance ERK1/2 proteins have been shown to be inactivated by HE-PTP in hematopoietic cell lines ( 32 , 38 ), whereas in neuronal cells they are inhibited by PTP-SL and STEP ( 39 ). Our results add DEP-1 as a physiological negative modulator of ERK1/2 activity in epithelial cells ( Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 ), which is consistent with the established role of DEP-1 as a tumor suppressor.

A variety of reports have shown that phosphatases have an intrinsic enzymatic preference and that, when challenged with different peptide substrates, they display a distinct bias that is often associated with specific sequence contexts flanking the phosphotyrosine ( 40 – 43 ). Sequence preference, however, cannot fully explain the specificity of in vivo substrate selection because considerable flexibility exists for PTPs to recognize phosphopeptides whose sequence deviates from their “ideal” in vitro substrate. Thus, although enzymatic specificity plays a role in determining substrate choice, it is by now clear that the phosphatase-substrate vicinity, mediated by docking domains, contributes to a large extent to target selection.

The physiological relevance of our findings is strengthened by the observation that DEP-1 forms a complex with ERK1/2. ERK1/2 has evolved a strategy to recruit many of their substrates or effectors via the CD, the common docking domain, that acts as a receptor for a positively charged motif, which has been named KIM (kinase interaction motif) ( 44 ). We have demonstrated that such a docking mechanism is responsible for the formation of a complex between DEP-1 and ERK1/2 irrespective of the ERK phosphorylation state. ERK mutated in the conserved aspartate 319 in the CD domain cannot any longer act as a DEP-1 substrate. Interestingly, a glutamic acid-to-lysine substitution at codon 322 (E322K) in the CD domain of ERK2 has been reported to result in constitutively phosphorylated ERK2 in an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line ( 45 ). We have identified a positively charged peptide that loosely matches the KIM consensus motif in the juxta-membrane region of DEP-1. Its involvement in ERK1/2 recruitment was proven by mutating Lys-1016 into an Ala and by showing that its interaction with ERK is decreased by ∼80%. This decrease, however, is not sufficient to abolish the dephosphorylation of ERK following DEP-1 overexpression.

The newly identified KIM motif is specific for the ERK CD domain because the p38 MAPK does not form a complex with DEP-1 in the same conditions. This observation is consistent with the report that other PTPs (HE-PTP, PTP-SL, and STEP) show some level of specificity in their interaction with ERK and p38 MAPK ( 44 , 46 ).

It has been suggested that ERK1/2 proteins are activated in colon cancer cells via recruitment to the plasma membrane by binding to integrin β6, thus promoting cell proliferation ( 47 ). Because loss or heterozygosity for DEP-1 has been described previously in about 71% of the cases of colon carcinoma ( 48 ), we propose that in normal cells DEP-1 counterbalances the activating role of integrins.

Finally, DEP-1 expression is enhanced at high cell density ( 2 ). It has been suggested that DEP-1 plays an important role in cell-cell contact sensing by forming a complex with p120 (ctn) at the adherent junctions. Our data point to a possible role for DEP-1/ERK1/2 interaction in the regulation of density-dependent growth inhibition ( Fig. 10 ). Growth inhibition by cell-cell contact is a complex process that requires the coordinated action of several signals mediated by diverse molecules on the cell surface ( 49 ). Heterotropic interaction between up-regulated gangliosides and up-regulated receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-sigma on adjacent cells has been proposed as a key mechanism for growth arrest ( 50 ). Because cellular confluence increases DEP-1 expression, our observation that DEP-1 can down-regulate the RAS pathway by directly dephosphorylating ERK1/2 provides a second putative mechanism underlying high density growth arrest.
