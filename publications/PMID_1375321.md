In response to binding of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), the PDGF 
receptor (PDGFR) beta subunit is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and 
associates with numerous signal transduction enzymes, including the 
GTPase-activating protein of ras (GAP) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). 
Previous studies have shown that association of PI3K requires phosphorylation of 
tyrosine 751 (Y751) in the kinase insert and that this region of receptor forms 
at least a portion of the binding site for PI3K. In this study, the in vitro 
binding of GAP to the PDGFR was investigated. Like PI3K, GAP associates only 
with receptors that have been permitted to autophosphorylate, and GAP itself 
does not require tyrosine phosphate in order to stably associate with the 
phosphorylated PDGFR. To define which tyrosine residues are required for GAP 
binding, a panel of PDGFR phosphorylation site mutants was tested. Mutation of 
Y771 reduced the amount of GAP that associates to an undetectable level. In 
contrast, the F771 (phenylalanine at 771) mutant bound wild-type levels of PI3K, 
whereas the F740 and F751 mutants bound 3 and 23%, respectively, of the 
wild-type levels of PI3K but wild-type levels of GAP. The F740/F751 double 
mutant associated with wild-type levels of GAP, but no detectable PI3K activity, 
while the F740/F751/F771 triple mutant could not bind either GAP or PI3K. The in 
vitro and in vivo associations of GAP and PI3K activity to these PDGFR mutants 
were indistinguishable. The distinct tyrosine residue requirements suggest that 
GAP and PI3K bind different regions of the PDGFR. This possibility was also 
supported by the observation that the antibody to the PDGFR kinase insert Y751 
region that blocks association of PI3K had only a minor effect on the in vitro 
binding of GAP. In addition, highly purified PI3K and GAP associated in the 
absence of other cellular proteins and neither cooperated nor competed with each 
other's binding to the PDGFR. Taken together, these studies indicate that GAP 
and PI3K bind directly to the PDGFR and have discrete binding sites that include 
portions of the kinase insert domain.

In response to binding of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), the PDGF receptor (PDGFR) beta subunit is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and associates with numerous signal transduction enzymes, including the GTPase-activating protein of ras (GAP) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Previous studies have shown that association of PI3K requires phosphorylation of tyrosine 751 (Y751) in the kinase insert and that this region of receptor forms at least a portion of the binding site for PI3K. In this study, the in vitro binding of GAP to the PDGFR was investigated. Like PI3K, GAP associates only with receptors that have been permitted to autophosphorylate, and GAP itself does not require tyrosine phosphate in order to stably associate with the phosphorylated PDGFR. To define which tyrosine residues are required for GAP binding, a panel of PDGFR phosphorylation site mutants was tested. Mutation of Y771 reduced the amount of GAP that associates to an undetectable level. In contrast, the F771 (phenylalanine at 771) mutant bound wild-type levels of PI3K, whereas the F740 and F751 mutants bound 3 and 23%, respectively, of the wild-type levels of PI3K but wild-type levels of GAP. The F740/F751 double mutant associated with wild-type levels of GAP, but no detectable PI3K activity, while the F740/F751/F771 triple mutant could not bind either GAP or PI3K.
