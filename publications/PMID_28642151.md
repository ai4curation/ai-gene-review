Human HtrA3 protease is a proapoptotic protein, involved in embryo implantation 
and oncogenesis. In stress conditions the protease is activated by removal of 
its N-terminal domain. The activated form, ΔN-HtrA3L is a homotrimer composed of 
the protease (PD) and PDZ domains. The LB structural loop of the PD is longer by 
six amino acid residues than its counterparts of other human HtrA proteins and 
interacts with the PDZ in a way not observed in other known HtrA structures. By 
size exclusion chromatography of the ΔN-HtrA3L mutated variants we found that 
removal of the additional LB loop residues caused a complete loss of the proper 
trimeric structure while impairing their interactions with the PDZ domain 
decreased the amount of the trimers. This indicates that the LB loop 
participates in stabilization of the ΔN-HtrA3L oligomer structure and suggests 
involvement of the LB-PDZ interactions in the stabilization. Removal of the 
additional LB loop residues impaired the ΔN-HtrA3L activity against the peptide 
and protein substrates, including the antiapoptotic XIAP protein, while a 
decrease in the LB-PDZ interaction caused a diminished efficiency of the peptide 
cleavage. These results indicate that the additional LB residues are important 
for the ΔN-HtrA3L proteolytic activity. Furthermore, a monomeric form of the 
ΔN-HtrA3L is proteolytically inactive. In conclusion, our results suggest that 
the expanded LB loop promotes the ΔN-HtrA3L activity by stabilizing the protease 
native trimeric structure.
