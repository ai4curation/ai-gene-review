Notch is an ancient transmembrane receptor with crucial roles in cell-fate 
choices. Although the 'canonical' Notch pathway and its core members are well 
established - involving ligand-induced cleavage of Notch for transcriptional 
regulation - it has been unclear whether Notch can also function independently 
of ligand and transcription ('non-canonically') through a common mechanism. 
Recent studies suggest that Notch can non-canonically exert its biological 
functions by post-translationally targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling, an 
important cellular and developmental regulator. The non-canonical Notch pathway 
appears to be highly conserved from flies to mammals. Here, we discuss the 
emerging conserved mechanism and role of ligand/transcription-independent Notch 
signaling in cell and developmental biology.
