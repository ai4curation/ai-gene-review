Terminally misfolded or unassembled secretory proteins are retained in the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently cleared by the ER-associated 
degradation (ERAD) pathway. The degradation of ERAD substrates involves mannose 
trimming of N-linked glycans; however, the mechanisms of substrate recognition 
and sorting to the ERAD pathway are poorly defined. EDEM1 (ER 
degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like 1 protein) has been proposed to 
play a role in ERAD substrate signaling or recognition. We show that EDEM1 
specifically binds nonnative proteins in a glycan-independent manner. Inhibition 
of mannosidase activity with kifunensine or disruption of the EDEM1 
mannosidase-like domain by mutation had no effect on EDEM1 substrate binding but 
diminished its association with the ER membrane adaptor protein SEL1L. These 
results support a model whereby EDEM1 binds nonnative proteins and uses its 
mannosidase-like domain to target aberrant proteins to the ER membrane 
dislocation and ubiquitination complex containing SEL1L.
