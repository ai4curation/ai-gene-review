The cytoplasmic Myc protein (c-Myc) regulates various human genes and is 
dysregulated in many human cancers. Phosphorylation mediates the protein 
activation of c-Myc and is essential for the function of this transcription 
factor in normal cell behavior and tumor growth. To date, however, the targeting 
of Myc as a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment has been achieved 
primarily at the nonprotein level. We have developed a molecular imaging sensor 
for noninvasive imaging of c-Myc activity in living subjects using a split 
Firefly luciferase (FL) complementation strategy to detect and quantify the 
phosphorylation-mediated interaction between glycogen synthase kinase 3beta 
(GSK3beta) and c-Myc. This sensor system consists of two fusion proteins, GSK 
35-433-CFL and NFL-c-Myc, in which specific fragments of GSK3beta and c-Myc are 
fused with C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of the split FL, respectively. 
The sensor detects phosphorylation-specific GSK3beta-c-Myc interaction, the 
imaging signal of which correlates with the steady-state and temporal regulation 
of c-Myc phosphorylation in cell culture. The sensor also detects inhibition of 
c-Myc activity via differential pathways, allowing noninvasive monitoring of 
c-Myc-targeted drug efficacy in intact cells and living mice. Notably, this drug 
inhibition is detected before changes in tumor size are apparent in mouse 
xenograft and liver tumor models. This reporter system not only provides an 
innovative way to investigate the role of functional c-Myc in normal and 
cancer-related biological processes, but also facilitates c-Myc-targeted drug 
development by providing a rapid quantitative approach to assessing cancer 
response to therapy in living subjects.

Abstract

The cytoplasmic Myc protein (c-Myc) regulates various human genes and is dysregulated in many human cancers. Phosphorylation mediates the protein activation of c-Myc and is essential for the function of this transcription factor in normal cell behavior and tumor growth. To date, however, the targeting of Myc as a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment has been achieved primarily at the nonprotein level. We have developed a molecular imaging sensor for noninvasive imaging of c-Myc activity in living subjects using a split Firefly luciferase (FL) complementation strategy to detect and quantify the phosphorylation-mediated interaction between glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and c-Myc. This sensor system consists of two fusion proteins, GSK 35–433-CFL and NFL-c-Myc, in which specific fragments of GSK3β and c-Myc are fused with C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of the split FL, respectively. The sensor detects phosphorylation-specific GSK3β–c-Myc interaction, the imaging signal of which correlates with the steady-state and temporal regulation of c-Myc phosphorylation in cell culture. The sensor also detects inhibition of c-Myc activity via differential pathways, allowing noninvasive monitoring of c-Myc–targeted drug efficacy in intact cells and living mice. Notably, this drug inhibition is detected before changes in tumor size are apparent in mouse xenograft and liver tumor models. This reporter system not only provides an innovative way to investigate the role of functional c-Myc in normal and cancer-related biological processes, but also facilitates c-Myc–targeted drug development by providing a rapid quantitative approach to assessing cancer response to therapy in living subjects.

Discussion

Because oncogenic activation of the c-Myc gene involves insertional mutagenesis, chromosomal translocation, and gene amplification ( 6 ), noninvasive monitoring of c-Myc activity at the transcriptional level using reporter genes is challenging. The phosphorylation-mediated activation of c-Myc protein contributes to the actual function of c-Myc in many normal and cancerous molecular processes. Thus, the fact that S62 phosphorylation is required for the interaction between GSK3β and c-Myc makes imaging the phospho signal and activation of c-Myc by detection of GSK3β–c-Myc interaction an attractive proposition. Consequently, we developed an imaging sensor based on a protein-assisted split luciferase complementation strategy by fusing GSK3β fragments and a c-Myc activation motif with the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of split FL, respectively. The resulting complemented FL activity was dependent on the interaction between the GSK3β fragment and the c-Myc activation motif ( Fig. 1 C ). We also showed that the 35–433 aa fragment of GSK3β was sufficient to confer specificity to S62 phosphorylation of NFL-c-Myc, but not other truncations ( Fig. 2 ). The deleted 1–34 aa fragment of GSK3β actually contains the autoinhibition site Ser-9, which prevents substrate binding to the phospho priming site ( 25 ); thus, the GSK 35–433-CFL fusion protein is not susceptible to the intrinsic inhibition of GSK3β in cancer cells. On a similar note, the 19 aa activation motif contains the phospho sites for c-Myc activation, but is not sufficient for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation ( 24 ). We also compared split RL fusion and split FL fusion constructs and found that the latter resulted in a much higher photon output, which also may have an advantage over the hRL fusion in living subjects due to a more red-shifted wavelength, allowing greater light penetration through the body. Accordingly, GSK 35–433-CFL/NFL-c-Myc comprises a sensor that generates complemented FL activity, measurable through an imaging signal, on S62 phosphorylation of c-Myc.

We further characterized the phosphorylation dependence of the split FL complementation by introducing a T58I mutation, and found that this resulted in a greater reduction of complemented FL activity than the S62A mutation, suggesting that T58 phosphorylation is more efficient in inducing reporter complementation. This also may imply that T58 phosphorylation is required for high-affinity binding of GSK3β to c-Myc, which in turn brings two inactive split FL fragments closer for complementation of FL reporter ( Fig. 1 A ). However, the Western blot analysis indicated that T58 phosphorylation was dependent on S62 phosphorylation ( Fig. 3 C ), which is consistent with the endogenous phosphorylation process of c-Myc on activation. Therefore, by including both phosphorylation sites within its constructs, the developed sensor enables imaging of S62 phosphorylation that induces efficient split FL complementation.

We validated the sensor in intact cells and in living mice, demonstrating that the sensor signal (complemented FL activity) is closely correlated with the endogenous c-Myc phosphorylation level in culture cells and living mice, either at steady-state, on serum stimulation, or on drug treatment. Our results indicate that the sensor system provides a means to noninvasively image and quantify c-Myc phosphorylation and activation with high sensitivity in living subjects. Thus, this sensor might provide insight into previously undetermined roles of phosphorylation in many c-Myc functions, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis ( 5 ), by noninvasively reporting the phosphorylation status in cells under varying levels of spatial and temporal regulation. Recent stem cell studies have implicated Myc transcription factors in the control of pluripotency and self-renewal properties of tumor stem cells ( 28 ). Using the sensor presented herein might help unveil the relevant molecular mechanisms. Future generation of transgenic mice that incorporate the sensor in a tissue-specific manner might help reveal the role of c-Myc activation for in vivo orthotropic tumor development and progression ( Fig. 7 D ). There are various conditional mutant Myc transgenic mice in which overexpression of WT or mutant Myc is reversible under control of the Tet system ( 13 , 29 – 32 ). Crossing the sensor transgenic mice to these conditional mutant Myc transgenic mice can allow the noninvasive study of the relationship between Myc gene deregulation and Myc protein activation in the induction and maintenance of tumorigenesis in different tumor models. Because the c-Myc activation motif is also conserved in N-Myc and L-Myc, this sensor also may be used to investigate the role of phosphorylation in the function of these proteins in brain and lung cancer, respectively.

c-Myc is considered an attractive candidate for targeted cancer therapy because of its dysregulation in most human cancers. Recent studies in transgenic mouse models hold further promise for Myc as a valid anticancer target ( 31 ). Our sensor system has the potential to accelerate the discovery of c-Myc–targeted molecular therapeutics by providing a rapid, noninvasive readout of c-Myc activity in various in vitro assays as well as high-throughput screening of chemical libraries, with subsequent further validation of their effects in xenograft or transgenic mouse models. Clearly, the advantages of using our sensor system for earlier discovery and validation of candidate drugs ( Fig. 8 ) include significant reductions in the time, cost, and effort involved in c-Myc–targeted drug development. Furthermore, the quantitative readout of c-Myc activity in living subjects on drug treatment could potentially help establish future dosing parameters in preclinical models to guide initial clinical trials and eventual clinical applications.

Although our findings are promising, the present study has some limitations, and more work is needed to improve the c-Myc phosphorylation sensor. Neither the S62A mutation nor the T58I mutation of NFL-c-Myc completely abolished the sensor signal, suggesting that there may be some nonspecific binding between the GSK3β fragments and the c-Myc activation motif, as is also known to occur between endogenous GSK3β and c-Myc ( 33 ). By altering the residues surrounding S62 and T58 of NFL-c-Myc, or the residues around the binding sites of GSK3β, it may be possible to diminish the non–phosphorylation-mediated binding between the two fusion proteins. While using sensor stable cells to monitor drug effects, we used full-length FL as a control for direct drug effects on FL activity. Future studies examining drug effects on split FL versus full-length FL may be helpful as well. Moreover, in the mouse xenograft model, it might have been of benefit to control for intrinsic cell numbers by constitutively expressing hRL in the sensor stable cells in one xenograft, rather than using FL stable cells in a separate xenograft on the same mouse. This also could have helped reduce the tumor burden on the mice during prolonged monitoring of drug effects on survival rate. Because of the limited number of mice used, we killed the mice only on the final day of imaging and analyzed the phosphorylation levels in tumor tissue. In future experiments, larger cohorts of mice may be used to obtain tissue samples for examining the correlation between the sensor signal and the actual c-Myc phosphorylation level at several different time points.

In conclusion, we have developed a sensor system for the noninvasive imaging of c-Myc activation in cells and living mice. With a greater appreciation of the ever-expanding role of Myc in all aspects of cell behavior, this sensor will provide new avenues to investigate the mechanisms of Myc-associated normal and neoplastic cell growth and death, as well as to accelerate the development of Myc-targeted cancer therapeutics.
