Despite its biological and medical relevance, traffic from the Golgi to the 
plasma membrane (PM) is one of the least understood steps of secretion. Exomer 
is a protein complex that mediates the trafficking of certain cargoes from the 
trans-Golgi network/early endosomes to the PM in budding yeast. Here, we show 
that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe the Cfr1 and Bch1 proteins constitute the 
simplest form of an exomer. Cfr1 co-immunoprecipitates with Assembly Polypeptide 
adaptor 1 (AP-1), AP-2, and Golgi-localized, gamma-adaptin ear domain homology, 
ARF-binding (GGA) subunits, and cfr1+ interacts genetically with AP-1 and GGA 
genes. Exomer-defective cells exhibit multiple mild defects, including 
alterations in the morphology of Golgi stacks and the distribution of the 
synaptobrevin-like Syb1 protein, carboxypeptidase missorting, and stress 
sensitivity. S. pombe apm1Δ cells exhibit a defect in trafficking through the 
early endosomes that is severely aggravated in the absence of exomer. apm1Δ 
cfr1Δ cells exhibit a dramatic disorganization of intracellular compartments, 
including massive accumulation of electron-dense tubulovesicular structures. 
While the trans-Golgi network/early endosomes are severely disorganized in the 
apm1Δ cfr1Δ strain, gga21Δ gga22Δ cfr1Δ cells exhibit a significant disturbance 
of the prevacuolar/vacuolar compartments. Our findings show that exomer 
collaborates with clathrin adaptors in trafficking through diverse cellular 
compartments, and that this collaboration is important to maintain their 
integrity. These results indicate that the effect of eliminating exomer is more 
pervasive than that described to date, and suggest that exomer complexes might 
participate in diverse steps of vesicle transport in other organisms.
