Adenovirus E1A proteins immortalize primary animal cells and cooperate with 
several other oncogenes in oncogenic transformation. These activities are 
primarily determined by the N-terminal half (exon 1) of E1A. Although the 
C-terminal half (exon 2) is also essential for some of these activities, it is 
dispensable for cooperative transformation with the activated T24 ras oncogene. 
Exon 2 negatively modulates in vitro cooperative transformation with T24 ras as 
well as the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of transformed cells. A short 
C-terminal sequence of E1A governs the oncogenesis-restraining activity of exon 
2. This region of E1A binds with a cellular phosphoprotein, CtBP, through a 
5-amino acid motif, PLDLS, conserved among the E1A proteins of human 
adenoviruses. To understand the mechanism by which interaction between E1A and 
CtBP results in tumorigenesis-restraining activity, we searched for cellular 
proteins that complex with CtBP. Here, we report the cloning and 
characterization of a 125-kDa protein, CtIP, that binds with CtBP through the 
PLDLS motif. E1A exon 2 peptides that contain the PLDLS motif disrupt the 
CtBP-CtIP complex. Our results suggest that the tumorigenesis-restraining 
activity of E1A exon 2 may be related to the disruption of the CtBP-CtIP complex 
through the PLDLS motif.
