Many aspects of plant photomorphogenesis are controlled by the phytochrome (Phy) 
family of bilin-containing photoreceptors that detect red and far-red light by 
photointerconversion between a dark-adapted Pr state and a photoactivated Pfr 
state. Whereas 3D models of prokaryotic Phys are available, models of their 
plant counterparts have remained elusive. Here, we present the crystal structure 
of the photosensing module (PSM) from a seed plant Phy in the Pr state using the 
PhyB isoform from Arabidopsis thaliana. The PhyB PSM crystallized as a 
head-to-head dimer with strong structural homology to its bacterial relatives, 
including a 5(Z)syn, 10(Z)syn, 15(Z)anti configuration of the phytochromobilin 
chromophore buried within the cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenylyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) 
domain, and a well-ordered hairpin protruding from the Phy-specific domain 
toward the bilin pocket. However, its Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) domain, knot region, 
and helical spine show distinct structural differences potentially important to 
signaling. Included is an elongated helical spine, an extended β-sheet 
connecting the GAF domain and hairpin stem, and unique interactions between the 
region upstream of the PAS domain knot and the bilin A and B pyrrole rings. 
Comparisons of this structure with those from bacterial Phys combined with 
mutagenic studies support a toggle model for photoconversion that engages 
multiple features within the PSM to stabilize the Pr and Pfr end states after 
rotation of the D pyrrole ring. Taken together, this Arabidopsis PhyB structure 
should enable molecular insights into plant Phy signaling and provide an 
essential scaffold to redesign their activities for agricultural benefit and as 
optogenetic reagents.

Abstract

Many aspects of plant photomorphogenesis are controlled by the phytochrome (Phy) family of bilin-containing photoreceptors that detect red and far-red light by photointerconversion between a dark-adapted Pr state and a photoactivated Pfr state. Whereas 3D models of prokaryotic Phys are available, models of their plant counterparts have remained elusive. Here, we present the crystal structure of the photosensing module (PSM) from a seed plant Phy in the Pr state using the PhyB isoform from Arabidopsis thaliana . The PhyB PSM crystallized as a head-to-head dimer with strong structural homology to its bacterial relatives, including a 5( Z ) syn , 10( Z ) syn , 15( Z ) anti configuration of the phytochromobilin chromophore buried within the cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenylyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) domain, and a well-ordered hairpin protruding from the Phy-specific domain toward the bilin pocket. However, its Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) domain, knot region, and helical spine show distinct structural differences potentially important to signaling. Included is an elongated helical spine, an extended β-sheet connecting the GAF domain and hairpin stem, and unique interactions between the region upstream of the PAS domain knot and the bilin A and B pyrrole rings. Comparisons of this structure with those from bacterial Phys combined with mutagenic studies support a toggle model for photoconversion that engages multiple features within the PSM to stabilize the Pr and Pfr end states after rotation of the D pyrrole ring. Taken together, this Arabidopsis PhyB structure should enable molecular insights into plant Phy signaling and provide an essential scaffold to redesign their activities for agricultural benefit and as optogenetic reagents.

Conclusions

Our 3D structure for the PSM of Arabidopsis PhyB now offers a useful template to appreciate how plant Phys function mechanistically and the molecular effects underpinning the myriad of Phy signaling mutants ( 21 – 24 , 26 , 27 , 30 ). Compared with the 3D models from bacterial relatives, a common architecture for Phy-type photoreceptors emerges along with the identification of plant Phy-specific features that might be critical for their interactions with downstream effectors (e.g., PIFs) ( 24 , 27 , 31 ). Collectively, these comparisons combined with mutagenic studies extend the tryptophan switch model for photoconversion ( 7 ) to include a dynamic interplay of additional features within the PSM in driving photoconversion and stabilizing the Pr and Pfr end states. Presumably, the resulting toggle between these end states encourages differential signaling output that informs plants about their light environment. With this PhyB PSM scaffold, the rational redesign of plant Phys for improved agricultural performance ( 21 ) and as optogenetic tools ( 31 , 32 ) should accelerate.
