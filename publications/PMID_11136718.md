DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) is a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme that is involved 
in DNA replication, transcription, chromosome segregation, and apoptosis. Here 
we show by immunoprecipitation, pull down with glutathione S-transferase fusion 
proteins, and yeast two-hybrid analysis that both topo IIalpha and -beta 
physically interact with the histone deacetylase HDAC1. The in vitro DNA 
decatenation activity of recombinant topo IIalpha and -beta is inhibited by 
association with catalytically inactive, recombinant HDAC1. We provide evidence 
for the in vivo significance of the topo II-HDAC1 association, showing that 
inhibition of HDAC activity with trichostatin A suppresses apoptosis induced by 
the topo II poison etoposide, but not by the topoisomerase I inhibitor 
camptothecin. We suggest that chromatin remodeling by an HDAC-containing complex 
facilitates both topo II-catalyzed DNA rearrangement and etoposide-induced DNA 
damage in vivo.
