SH-PTP1 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) predominantly expressed in 
haematopoietic cells and containing two src homology-2 (SH2) domains. Here we 
report that SH-PTP1 is phosphorylated on both serine and tyrosine residues in 
response to thrombin or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which increased by 60 
and 40%, respectively, SH-PTP1 activity. Thrombin-induced phosphorylation of 
SH-PTP1 is an early signalling event (maximal within 10 s) involving neither 
integrin signalling, nor calcium, nor release of ADP or thromboxane A2. 
Moreover, in contrast with PMA, the effect of thrombin on the tyrosine 
phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 was hardly affected by GF109203X, a specific protein 
kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Finally, phosphorylation of SH-PTP1 could be provoked 
in permeabilized platelets by thrombin or GTP gamma S. This was abolished by 
pertussis toxin, the specificity of this effect being verified with the 
megakaryocytic cell line Dami cell. Our data thus identify SH-PTP1 as an in vivo 
substrate of a putative protein tyrosine kinase linked to the thrombin receptor 
by a Gi protein. This might offer some clue to unravel the mechanism of thrombin 
not only in platelets but also in nucleated cells, where its mitogenic effect is 
known to involve pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins, tyrosine phosphorylation 
and the ras pathway.
