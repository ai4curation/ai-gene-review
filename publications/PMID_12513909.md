Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a cellular homolog of IL-10 that stimulates the 
production of acute-phase reactants. IL-22 and IL-10 require different 
ligand-specific receptor chains (IL-22R and IL-10R1) but share a second receptor 
chain (IL-10R2) to initiate cellular responses. The quaternary structures and 
the ability of IL-22 and IL-10 to engage soluble (s) IL-10R1, IL-22R, IL-10R2 
receptor chains were analyzed using size exclusion chromatography and surface 
plasmon resonance techniques. In contrast to IL-10, which is a homodimer, IL-22 
is a monomer in solution that forms a 1:1 interaction with sIL-22R. Kinetic 
binding data reveal sIL-22R and sIL-10R1 exhibit specific nanomolar binding 
constants for IL-22 (k(on)/k(off) = 14.9 nM) and a monomeric isomer of IL-10 
(IL-10M1) (k(on)/k(off) = 0.7 nM), respectively. In contrast, IL-10R2 exhibits 
essentially no affinity for IL-22 (K(eq) approximately 1 mM) or IL-10M1 (K(eq) 
approximately 2 mM) alone but displays a substantial increase in affinity for 
the IL-10/sIL-10R1 (K(eq) approximately 350 microM) and IL-22/sIL-22R (K(eq) 
approximately 45 microM) complexes. Three-dimensional models of IL-22 and IL-10 
receptor complexes suggest two receptor residues (Gly-44 and Arg-96) are largely 
responsible for the marked differences in ligand affinity observed for sIL-10R1 
and sIL-22R vs. sIL-10R2.
