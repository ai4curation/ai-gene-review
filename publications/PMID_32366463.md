The lanthanide elements (Ln3+), those with atomic numbers 57-63 (excluding 
promethium, Pm3+), form a cofactor complex with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) 
in bacterial XoxF methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) and ExaF ethanol dehydrogenases 
(EDHs), expanding the range of biological elements and opening novel areas of 
metabolism and ecology. Other MDHs, known as MxaFIs, are related in sequence and 
structure to these proteins, yet they instead possess a Ca2+-PQQ cofactor. An 
important missing piece of the Ln3+ puzzle is defining what features distinguish 
enzymes that use Ln3+-PQQ cofactors from those that do not. Here, using XoxF1 
MDH from the model methylotrophic bacterium Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, we 
investigated the functional importance of a proposed lanthanide-coordinating 
aspartate residue. We report two crystal structures of XoxF1, one with and 
another without PQQ, both with La3+ bound in the active-site region and 
coordinated by Asp320 Using constructs to produce either recombinant XoxF1 or 
its D320A variant, we show that Asp320 is needed for in vivo catalytic function, 
in vitro activity, and La3+ coordination. XoxF1 and XoxF1 D320A, when produced 
in the absence of La3+, coordinated Ca2+ but exhibited little or no catalytic 
activity. We also generated the parallel substitution in ExaF to produce ExaF 
D319S and found that this variant loses the capacity for efficient ethanol 
oxidation with La3+ These results provide evidence that a Ln3+-coordinating 
aspartate is essential for the enzymatic functions of XoxF MDHs and ExaF EDHs, 
supporting the notion that sequences of these enzymes, and the genes that encode 
them, are markers for Ln3+ metabolism.

Abstract

The lanthanide elements (Ln 3+ ), those with atomic numbers 57–63 (excluding promethium, Pm 3+ ), form a cofactor complex with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) in bacterial XoxF methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) and ExaF ethanol dehydrogenases (EDHs), expanding the range of biological elements and opening novel areas of metabolism and ecology. Other MDHs, known as MxaFIs, are related in sequence and structure to these proteins, yet they instead possess a Ca 2+ -PQQ cofactor. An important missing piece of the Ln 3+ puzzle is defining what features distinguish enzymes that use Ln 3+ -PQQ cofactors from those that do not. Here, using XoxF1 MDH from the model methylotrophic bacterium Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, we investigated the functional importance of a proposed lanthanide-coordinating aspartate residue. We report two crystal structures of XoxF1, one with and another without PQQ, both with La 3+ bound in the active-site region and coordinated by Asp 320 . Using constructs to produce either recombinant XoxF1 or its D320A variant, we show that Asp 320 is needed for in vivo catalytic function, in vitro activity, and La 3+ coordination. XoxF1 and XoxF1 D320A, when produced in the absence of La 3+ , coordinated Ca 2+ but exhibited little or no catalytic activity. We also generated the parallel substitution in ExaF to produce ExaF D319S and found that this variant loses the capacity for efficient ethanol oxidation with La 3+ . These results provide evidence that a Ln 3+ -coordinating aspartate is essential for the enzymatic functions of XoxF MDHs and ExaF EDHs, supporting the notion that sequences of these enzymes, and the genes that encode them, are markers for Ln 3+ metabolism.

Introduction

Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is the prosthetic group of a large class of eight-bladed β propeller dehydrogenases that catalyze the oxidation of alcohols and aldose sugars ( 1 – 3 ). Quinoproteins are generally known as periplasmic enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria, many of which are capable of synthesizing PQQ themselves. PQQ is also known to be physiologically important for plants ( 4 ) and mammals (including humans) ( 5 ), and PQQ-dependent enzymes have been identified in eukaryotes ( 6 , 7 ) and archaea ( 8 ). Relatively little is known about the functions or activities of these enzymes, yet the emergence of PQQ enzymes in these domains suggests that quinoproteins have been greatly undersampled in nature.

In the “classic” (PQQ-containing) quinoprotein active site, calcium (Ca 2+ ) is associated with the prosthetic group to form the cofactor complex ( 1 ). Two well-understood representatives of quinoproteins are the prokaryotic Ca 2+ -dependent methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) MxaFI and ethanol dehydrogenase (EDH) ExaA. MxaFI MDH is a critical enzyme for methylotrophy—the ability of microorganisms to derive all carbon and energy needed for survival and growth from reduced compounds lacking carbon–carbon bonds, such as methane and methanol ( 9 – 13 ). A number of recent studies have shown how lanthanide elements (Ln 3+ ) greatly impact methylotrophy. Ln 3+ associate with PQQ and function as cofactors of XoxF-type MDHs and ExaF-type EDHs in methylotrophic bacteria ( 14 – 17 ). These enzymes are aptly referred to as Ln 3+ -dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (Ln-ADHs), and their discovery has added Ln 3+ to the biological table of the elements ( 15 , 16 , 18 – 20 ). A number of XoxF-type MDHs have been studied from methylotrophic bacteria, with analyses including X-ray crystallography and enzyme kinetics ( 15 , 17 , 21 – 24 ). ExaF EDH from the model methylotroph Methylorubrum (formerly Methylobacterium ( 25 )) extorquens AM1 is currently the only representative reported from a methylotroph, although genes encoding putative ExaF homologs have been identified in a diverse set of organisms ( 16 , 26 , 27 ). Phylogenetic analyses of XoxF-coding genes indicate that they are widespread in the environment and can be grouped into at least five distinct clades with representatives in Alpha- , Beta- , and Gammaproteobacteria ; Verrucomicrobia ; and the NC10 phylum bacterium Candidatus “Methylomirabilis oxyfera” ( 28 ). Importantly, phylogenetic consideration of potential Ln 3+ -related genes led to two discoveries: 1) bacteria previously reported to be nonmethylotrophic, such as Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA110, can indeed grow methylotrophically using XoxF-type MDHs ( 23 ), and 2) Ln-ADHs metabolize multicarbon compounds in methylotrophs and nonmethylotrophs, such as Pseudomonas putida KT2440 ( 16 , 29 ). These relatively recent discoveries underscore the relevance of Ln 3+ to microbial diversity and emphasize the importance of metal bioavailability in plant, soil, aquatic, and marine ecosystems—complex environments where Ln-utilizing bacteria are major constituents ( 30 – 33 ). Although the use of Ln 3+ is currently limited to prokaryotic ADHs, the direct association of these metals with PQQ to form a cofactor complex raises the possibility that Ln 3+ may be linked to all domains of life.

Lighter versions of Ln 3+ , ranging from lanthanum (La 3+ ) to europium (Eu 3+ ) (atomic numbers 57–63), excluding promethium (Pm 3+ ), have been shown to function with PQQ as essential cofactors in XoxF-type and ExaF-type ADHs. Ln-ADHs can be distinguished from MxaFI-type MDHs and ExaA-type EDHs that bind PQQ and coordinate Ca 2+ ( 34 , 35 ). In the heterotetrameric MxaFI MDHs, Ca 2+ serves as a Lewis acid that polarizes the C5 carbonyl of PQQ, facilitating hydride transfer from the alcohol substrate ( Fig. 1 A ) ( 36 ). Because the active site of ExaA-type EDHs is very similar to that of MxaFI, the reaction mechanism is likely analogous ( 37 ). Initial reports of Ln-ADHs showing higher catalytic efficiencies compared with Ca-ADHs generated excitement that Ln 3+ coordination augmented ADH efficiency as a general phenomenon ( 15 , 16 , 28 ). However, characterization of additional Ln-ADHs included some exhibiting catalytic efficiencies similar to Ca-ADHs ( 14 – 17 , 21 , 22 , 28 , 29 ). It is possible that unique physiologies of certain bacteria, such as thermoacidophiles like Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, require extremely efficient XoxF MDHs for survival ( 15 ), but this is likely the exception and not the rule for Ln-ADHs. Functional redundancy may also allow for the adaptation of secondary enzymes for alternative substrates with distinct roles in metabolism, such as formaldehyde oxidation by ExaF ( 16 , 21 ).

Although Ln-ADHs and Ca-ADHs share many similarities, their clear differences in metal preference raise the question of what structural features, if any, determine and are potentially diagnostic for metal usage. XoxF-type MDHs are α 2 homodimeric enzymes and distinct from the α 2 β 2 heterodimeric structure of MxaFI-type MDHs ( 2 , 38 ). One important exception to this generalization is XoxF-type MDH from Candidatus “Methylomirabilis oxyfera,” which was purified as a α 2 β 2 heterodimer that included MxaI, the small subunit of MxaFI-type MDHs ( 24 ). ExaF-type and ExaA-type EDHs are both α 2 homodimeric enzymes ( 16 , 39 ). Quaternary structure alone, therefore, cannot be used to differentiate Ln-ADHs and Ca-ADHs. Multiple sequence alignment of type I ADHs, which include both MDHs and EDHs, shows high conservation of catalytically and structurally important amino acids, including Asn, Glu, and Asp residues in the active site ( 28 ). Remarkably, one residue is differentially conserved in Ln-ADHs compared with Ca-ADHs ( Fig. 1 B ). Nearly all XoxF and ExaF sequences have an additional Asp residue positioned 2 amino acids downstream from a conserved Asp required for catalytic function ( 28 ). This position is occupied by Ala in MxaFI-type MDHs and Ser or Thr in ExaA-type EDHs. The crystal structure of XoxF MDH from M. fumariolicum SolV revealed this additional Asp to coordinate the Ce 3+ , and this residue was proposed to be diagnostic for Ln-ADHs ( 15 , 28 ). The few XoxF-type MDH crystal structures generally support the role of this residue as being important for Ln 3+ coordination and function of the enzyme ( 15 – 17 , 40 – 42 ).

M. extorquens AM1 has been a model of study for one-carbon metabolism for decades. This methylotrophic bacterium produces XoxF1 MDH and ExaF EDH that both contain Ln-PQQ cofactors ( 13 , 21 , 43 – 45 ) and possess the additional Asp residue proposed to be important for Ln 3+ coordination: Asp 320 (XoxF1) and Asp 319 (ExaF), respectively. XoxF1 and ExaF have been kinetically characterized with La 3+ , and XoxF1 with neodymium as well ( 16 , 21 ). M. extorquens AM1 can produce a second XoxF MDH that is ∼90% identical to XoxF1 ( 46 ). The protein has been named XoxF2, and its function in the WT strain is still not well-understood. XoxF2 is capable of supporting methanol growth with Ln 3+ when XoxF1 cannot be produced, although it seems to be a secondary enzyme ( 43 ). M. extorquens AM1 also produces the Ca 2+ -dependent MxaFI MDH. Expression of the mxa operon, encoding MxaFI and accessory/Ca 2+ -insertion proteins, is differentially regulated from the xox1 gene cluster by the “Ln switch” that is sensitive to the presence of nanomolar Ln 3+ ( 43 , 47 , 48 ). When Ln 3+ are absent from the growth medium (or at sub-nanomolar concentrations), xox1 expression is down-regulated and mxa expression is up-regulated. If Ln 3+ are present at nanomolar or greater concentrations, mxa expression is down-regulated and xox1 is highly expressed ( 21 ). The presence of the Ln switch in M. extorquens AM1 and the capacity to produce Ca-MDH and Ln-ADH make it an excellent model for the study of Ln biology.

Of the few reported Ln-ADHs, all have the hypothetical “Ln-coordinating Asp” including XoxF1 and ExaF from M. extorquens AM1. Although theoretical studies support the importance of this residue for the function of Ln-ADH, no empirical study, until now, has shown that this residue is required for Ln 3+ coordination and catalytic function of these enzymes. We report the structure of XoxF1 from M. extorquens AM1 as a representative Type V XoxF MDH structure. The protein crystallized as a homodimer with one La 3+ and one PQQ per subunit. We report an additional structure with only La 3+ coordinated; this is the first structure of an MDH without PQQ bound to our knowledge. In both structures, Asp 320 contributes to La 3+ coordination. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed an Ala 320 substitution variant of XoxF1 (D320A) from M. extorquens AM1 and show that the mutant cells were incapable of growth with methanol and La 3+ . MDH activity was only detectable for XoxF1, and not for XoxF1 320A, when purified from cultures grown with La 3+ . When purified from cultures lacking La 3+ , XoxF1 and XoxF1 D320A exhibited little to no activity with methanol. Further, we show that production of catalytically inactive XoxF1 from plasmid constructs was sufficient to allow for MxaFI-dependent growth on methanol in a Δ xoxF1 Δ xoxF2 mutant. Finally, we report that an ExaF D319S variant (the parallel substitution to XoxF1 D320A) was inactive with ethanol in vivo , providing evidence that the Ln-coordinating Asp is also necessary for catalytic function of ExaF-type EDHs. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence in support of the Ln-coordinating Asp being necessary for Ln-ADH catalytic function and supports its potential use as a marker to identify new Ln-ADHs.

Discussion

XoxF-type MDHs are members of type I eight-bladed β propeller quinoproteins (PQQ-containing). MxaFI-type MDHs and ExaF-type EDHs/ADHs fall within the same type I classification ( 3 , 28 , 64 ). Phylogenetic analyses have identified at least five major clades for XoxF-type MDHs and nine additional clades encompassing ExaF-type EDHs/ADHs ( 18 , 28 ). However, the Ln ADHs available for study are relatively few, and structural data are limited. Here we report two structures of XoxF1 from M. extorquens AM1 (a type V XoxF MDH), one showing coordination of the La 3+ -PQQ cofactor complex and the other with only the La 3+ atom bound. Both structures confirm coordination of La 3+ by Asp 320 , as has been observed for the corresponding residue in the three previously reported XoxF MDH structures ( 15 , 17 , 49 ), denoting the importance of this residue for Ln 3+ coordination and function. Comparative analysis of fully metallated subunits of XoxF1-La 3+ -PQQ and XoxF1-La 3+ with the chain B of XoxF1-La 3+ (61% occupied by La 3+ ) indicated that Asp 320 is immobile compared with the relatively flexible Trp 258 , Trp 280 , Asp 318 , and Arg 345 side chains. Asp 320 may therefore be a key residue for recruiting Ln 3+ to the active site of XoxF1. In addition, XoxF1-La 3+ is the first quinoprotein structure reported without PQQ and shows that the organic cofactor is not essential for metal binding even though it provides three coordinating atoms. Incomplete occupancy of La 3+ in chain B of this structure shows that whereas PQQ likely plays a stabilizing role in Ln 3+ coordination, it appears to be a minor one. These results imply the Ln 3+ may be loaded independently of PQQ when the Ln 3+ -PQQ complex is assembled. Additional genetic, biochemical, and structural studies are needed to gain a fuller understanding of the metal-PQQ cofactor assembly, including determination of whether the process is similar for Ca-ADH. Furthermore, dissociation of PQQ from the active enzyme to yield XoxF1-La 3+ did not disrupt the dimeric structure of the enzyme, as speculated by Featherston et al. ( 65 ), showing that PQQ is not essential for maintaining dimeric interface contacts. It remains to be seen whether PQQ is essential for maintaining dimeric and/or tetrameric contacts in MxaFI MDH, ExaA EDH, and other PQQ ADHs.

In this study, we show that substitution of the proposed “Ln-coordinating Asp” by Ala renders the XoxF1 D320A variant unable to coordinate La 3+ , resulting in the loss of its MDH function. The parallel substitution yielding ExaF D319S results in loss of its in vivo function as well. Together, these results provide empirical evidence showing the necessity of the additional Asp residue in both XoxF1-type MDHs and ExaF-type EDHs, and they substantiate the Ln-coordinating Asp hypothesis for determining the metal coordination and enzyme function. The identification of putative Ln ADHs by sequence alone has relied on the validity of the Ln-coordinating Asp hypothesis, which we have now corroborated with biochemical and phenotypic evidence. As a result, enzymes that have been marked as putative Ln ADHs can be investigated for Ln utilization with a high degree of confidence, and newly discovered sequences and novel enzymes can be interrogated for the hallmark residue.

Intriguingly, the metal contents of XoxF1 and its D320A variant show that Asp 320 is needed for La 3+ , but not Ca 2+ , binding in vivo . Insertion of Ca 2+ into XoxF1 had been an open question because low MDH activity was reported for enzyme purified from culture medium without added Ln 3+ ( 59 ). In this study, we corroborate those results and provide evidence that WT XoxF1 coordinates an equimolar ratio of Ca 2+ when Ln 3+ are not available. The mxa operon encoding MxaFI also contains genes that code for accessory proteins involved in enzyme maturation and metal insertion ( 47 ). Genes encoding a cognate cytochrome c L ( xoxG ) and an essential protein of unknown function ( xoxJ ) are located in a cluster with xoxF1 , but genes encoding a Ln 3+ insertion system have yet to be identified ( 46 ). A separate gene cluster for lanthanide utilization and transport ( lut ), however, has been identified and characterized ( 66 ). The lut cluster contains several genes encoding Ln 3+ -binding proteins that also may facilitate metal insertion into XoxF1. WT XoxF1 possesses only La 3+ when purified from culture medium containing both La 3+ and Ca 2+ , indicating a selective preference for Ln 3+ . However, we observed high levels of Ca 2+ in the D320A variant purified from the same culture conditions. These results suggest that Asp 320 may be necessary not only for Ln 3+ coordination at the active site, but also for Ln 3+ selectivity. One possibility to explain this observation is that the supposed “metal-free” XoxF1 binds free Ca 2+ , which is available from the growth medium for transport to the periplasm. In any case, we propose that metal selection involves the active site residues with the participation of Asp 320 . We also observed high Ca 2+ content in WT enzyme and the D320A variant when purified from culture medium without added La 3+ . Under this condition, the Ln switch cannot occur, and the mxa operon is expressed, including the genes encoding Ca 2+ insertion proteins ( 21 ). It is possible that the Ca 2+ insertion machinery encoded by the mxa cluster also recognizes XoxF1; however, additional components are not necessary for Ca 2+ coordination by XoxF1. More detailed knowledge of the insertion machineries is needed to fully understand how Ln 3+ are preferentially loaded into XoxF MDH and what distinguishes Ln 3+ insertion from Ca 2+ insertion. XoxF1 exhibits a clear preference for Ln 3+ , as corroborated by the inactivity of XoxF1 loaded with Ca 2+ compared with that coordinating Ln 3+ . The Ca 2+ -bound XoxF1 exhibits low MDH activity using the dye-linked assay, even though high levels of the metal are present. Thus, XoxF1 from M. extorquens AM1 serves as a useful representative enzyme for comparing the impacts of Ln 3+ versus Ca 2+ on enzyme function because it can coordinate both metals. Kinetic, mutational, crystallographic, and DFT studies with the newly available XoxF1 structure (PDB entry 6OC6 ) will provide additional insight into how these metals affect XoxF MDH activity.

In addition to its Ln 3+ -dependent catalytic function, XoxF1 plays a role in regulation of the mxa and xox1 operons. A copy of xoxF is required for mxa expression, leading to a proposed model where metal-free XoxF1 senses Ln 3+ ( 43 , 58 ). A xoxF suppressor mutant from the closely related M. extorquens PA1 is responsive to Ln 3+ , however, calling into question the essentiality of XoxF1 for Ln 3+ sensing ( 67 ). It is worth noting that the suppressor mutations are located in the mxbD sensor kinase gene, whose product sits downstream of XoxF1 in the regulatory model. The resulting change to the HAMP domain of MxbD could affect signal transduction and obviate the need for XoxF1. Whereas there is debate regarding specific details of the complex regulatory cascade, it is the structure of XoxF—not the in vivo MDH catalytic activity—that is crucial for regulation. In this study, we provide further evidence supporting this model using catalytically nonfunctional XoxF1 D320A, which allows for growth with methanol in the absence of Ln 3+ . When either XoxF1 or the D320A variant is produced without Ln 3+ , the cultures grow similarly to the WT strain, suggesting that mxa expression is similar to that in the WT cells. Using this condition, MxaFI catalyzes methanol oxidation, because XoxF1 does not bind Ln 3+ and is inactive, as confirmed by our MDH assay results with pure enzymes. Our metal content analyses indicate that under these conditions, XoxF1 coordinates Ca 2+ . In addition, we observed Ln 3+ -dependent growth phenotypes when producing XoxF1 D320A in the Δ xoxF1 Δ xoxF2 double mutant, indicating that Ln 3+ were “sensed”. This strain does not produce a functional XoxF1 capable of coordinating Ln 3+ , reaffirming the role of the XoxF protein in regulation rather than its catalytic activity. These results suggest that XoxF1 with Ca 2+ may be an important signal for inducing MxaFI production and further explain the binary metal loading preferences we observed by ICP-MS/OES analyses with purified enzymes.

In conclusion, our results have increased our understanding of Ln 3+ ADH structure and function and provide two new crystal structures of XoxF1 MDH to the scientific community. These structures will aid in future endeavors to investigate Ln 3+ and PQQ biochemistry.
