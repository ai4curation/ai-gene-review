Time to fall asleep (sleep latency) is a major determinant of sleep quality. 
Chronic, long sleep latency is a major characteristic of sleep-onset insomnia 
and/or delayed sleep phase syndrome. In this study we aimed to discover common 
polymorphisms that contribute to the genetics of sleep latency. We performed a 
meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including 2 572 737 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) established in seven European cohorts 
including 4242 individuals. We found a cluster of three highly correlated 
variants (rs9900428, rs9907432 and rs7211029) in the RNA-binding protein fox-1 
homolog 3 gene (RBFOX3) associated with sleep latency (P-values=5.77 × 10(-08), 
6.59 × 10(-)(08) and 9.17 × 10(-)(08)). These SNPs were replicated in up to 12 
independent populations including 30 377 individuals (P-values=1.5 × 10(-)(02), 
7.0 × 10(-)(03) and 2.5 × 10(-)(03); combined meta-analysis P-values=5.5 × 
10(-07), 5.4 × 10(-07) and 1.0 × 10(-07)). A functional prediction of RBFOX3 
based on co-expression with other genes shows that this gene is predominantly 
expressed in brain (P-value=1.4 × 10(-316)) and the central nervous system 
(P-value=7.5 × 10(-)(321)). The predicted function of RBFOX3 based on 
co-expression analysis with other genes shows that this gene is significantly 
involved in the release cycle of neurotransmitters including gamma-aminobutyric 
acid and various monoamines (P-values<2.9 × 10(-11)) that are crucial in 
triggering the onset of sleep. To conclude, in this first large-scale GWAS of 
sleep latency we report a novel association of variants in RBFOX3 gene. Further, 
a functional prediction of RBFOX3 supports the involvement of RBFOX3 with sleep 
latency.
