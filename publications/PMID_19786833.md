Epigenetic gene inactivation in mammalian cells involves many silencing 
mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is the transcriptional repression by 
targeted promoter hypermethylation. However, the molecular mechanisms involved 
in the site-specific DNA (hyper)methylation are not fully elucidate. By using 
the Dnmt3a/c-myc interaction as an example, we here showed that this interaction 
promotes the site-specific methylation of CG dinucleotides localized in c-myc 
boxes of promoter regions of CDKN2a, CCND1 and TIMP2 genes. Indeed, the 
invalidation of c-myc reveals that c-myc allows the Dnmt3a recruitment on c-myc 
box of c-myc-regulated genes. Acellular experiments corroborated and 
complemented these results by revealing that the specificity of consensus 
sequence for DNA methylation of Dnmt3a is increased in presence of c-myc. 
Indeed, our work indicates that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b have consensus sequences to 
methylate DNA (T/A/C)(A/T)(T/G/A)CG(T/G/C)G(G/C/A) and 
(A/C)(C/G/A)(A/G)CGT(C/G)(A/G). Thus, the low specificity of these sequences 
(consensual for 162 and 48 possibilities, respectively) does not support the 
idea of targeted DNA methylation. By monitoring transcription factor arrays 
spotted with 103 transcription factors, we next identified 42 transcription 
factors interacting with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (such as CREB and FOS), 27 
transcription factors interacting with Dnmt3a (such as AP2alpha and p53), 10 
transcription factors interacting with Dnmt3b (such as SP1 and SP4) and 24 
transcription factors devoid of direct interaction with Dnm3a and Dnmt3b (such 
as C/EBPalpha and NFkappaB-p65). Thus, The description of direct interaction 
between Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b and transcription factors provides rational 
molecular explanation to the mechanisms of targeted DNA (hyper)methylation, and 
to the mechanisms by which transcription factors repress genes expression.
