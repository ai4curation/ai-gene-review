Paclitaxel is a microtubule-binding compound that is widely used as a 
chemotherapeutic in the treatment of common cancers, including breast and 
ovarian cancer. Paclitaxel binding along the length of microtubules stabilizes 
them and suppresses their dynamics, leading to mitotic arrest and apoptosis in 
dividing cells. Though they are not dividing cells, neurons are also susceptible 
to paclitaxel, and paclitaxel exposure results in axonal degeneration. Thus a 
frequent side effect of paclitaxel treatment in patients is peripheral 
neuropathy, which can necessitate dose reductions and have lasting symptoms. An 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying paclitaxel's neurotoxicity is 
important for development of therapeutics to prevent and alleviate the 
neuropathy. Here we will review approaches taken to investigate mechanisms of 
paclitaxel-induced neuropathy and evidence for potential mechanisms of the 
axonal degeneration downstream of or distinct from microtubule stabilization by 
paclitaxel. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'The Synaptic 
Basis of Neurodegenerative Disorders'.
