Defects in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase or respiratory chain complex IV 
(CIV) assembly are a frequent cause of human mitochondrial disorders. 
Specifically, mutations in four conserved assembly factors impinging the 
biogenesis of the mitochondrion-encoded catalytic core subunit 2 (COX2) result 
in myopathies. These factors afford stability of newly synthesized COX2 (the 
dystonia-ataxia syndrome protein COX20), a protein with two transmembrane 
domains, and maturation of its copper center, CuA (cardiomyopathy proteins SCO1, 
SCO2, and COA6). COX18 is an additional COX2 assembly factor that belongs to the 
Oxa1 family of membrane protein insertases. Here, we used a gene-editing 
approach to generate a human COX18 knock-out HEK293T cell line that displays 
isolated complete CIV deficiency. We demonstrate that COX20 stabilizes COX2 
during insertion of its N-proximal transmembrane domain, and subsequently, COX18 
transiently interacts with COX2 to promote translocation across the inner 
membrane of the COX2 C-tail that contains the apo-CuA site. The release of COX18 
from this complex coincides with the binding of the SCO1-SCO2-COA6 copper 
metallation module to COX2-COX20 to finalize COX2 biogenesis. Therefore, COX18 
is a new candidate when screening for mitochondrial disorders associated with 
isolated CIV deficiency.
