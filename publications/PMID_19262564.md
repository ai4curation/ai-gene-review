Caveolae are a major membrane domain common to most cells. One of the defining 
features of this domain is the protein caveolin. The exact function of caveolin, 
however, is not clear. One possible function is to attract adapter molecules to 
caveolae in a manner similar to how clathrin attracts molecules to coated pits. 
Here, we characterize a candidate adapter molecule called SRBC. SRBC binds 
PKCdelta and is a member of the STICK (substrates that interact with C-kinase) 
superfamily of PKC-binding proteins. We also show it co-immunoprecipitates with 
caveolin-1. A leucine zipper in SRBC is essential for both co-precipitation with 
caveolin and localization to caveolae. SRBC remains associated with caveolin 
when caveolae bud to form vesicles (cavicles) that travel on microtubules to 
different regions of the cell. In the absence of SRBC, intracellular cavicle 
traffic is markedly impaired. We conclude that SRBC (sdr-related gene product 
that binds to c-kinase) and two other family members [PTRF (Pol I and 
transcription release factor) and SDPR] function as caveolin adapter molecules 
that regulate caveolae function.
