Rho1p is a yeast homolog of mammalian RhoA small GTP-binding protein. Rho1p is 
localized at the growth sites and required for bud formation. We have recently 
shown that Bni1p is a potential target of Rho1p and that Bni1p regulates 
reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with profilin, an 
actin monomer-binding protein. Using the yeast two-hybrid screening system, we 
cloned a gene encoding a protein that interacted with Bni1p. This protein, 
Spa2p, was known to be localized at the bud tip and to be implicated in the 
establishment of cell polarity. The C-terminal 254 amino acid region of Spa2p, 
Spa2p(1213-1466), directly bound to a 162-amino acid region of Bni1p, 
Bni1p(826-987). Genetic analyses revealed that both the bni1 and spa2 mutations 
showed synthetic lethal interactions with mutations in the genes encoding 
components of the Pkc1p-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, in which Pkc1p 
is another target of Rho1p. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis showed that 
Bni1p was localized at the bud tip in wild-type cells. However, in the spa2 
mutant, Bni1p was not localized at the bud tip and instead localized diffusely 
in the cytoplasm. A mutant Bni1p, which lacked the Rho1p-binding region, also 
failed to be localized at the bud tip. These results indicate that both Rho1p 
and Spa2p are involved in the localization of Bni1p at the growth sites where 
Rho1p regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through Bni1p.
