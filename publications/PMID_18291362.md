Sulindac has been reported to be effective in suppressing tumor growth through 
the induction of p21WAF1/cip1 in human, animal models of colon cancer and colon 
cancer cells. In this study, we treated human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and 
lung cancer cell line A549 as well as colon cancer cell line SW620 with sulindac 
to observe the effects of sulindac in other tissue sites. In all cell lines, 
proliferation was significantly inhibited by sulindac after 24 and 72 h of 
treatment. Apoptosis was induced by sulindac in both lung cancer cells and colon 
cancer cells but was not induced in breast cancer cells. Western blots showed 
that p21 protein level were induced by sulindac in lung cancer cells and colon 
cancer cells, but not in breast cancer cells. However, the suppression of 
beta-catenin, a key mediator of Wnt signaling pathway, was seen in all three 
cell lines with sulindac administration. Further studies revealed that 
transcriptional activities of beta-catenin were significantly inhibited by 
sulindac and that the inhibition was sulindac dosage-dependent. The 
transcriptional targets of beta-catenin, c-myc, cyclin D1 and cdk 4 were also 
dramatically downregulated. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that the 
efficacy of sulindac in the inhibition of cell proliferation (rather than the 
induction of apoptosis) might be through the suppression of beta-catenin pathway 
in human cancer cells.

Abstract

Sulindac has been reported to be effective in suppressing tumor growth through the induction of p21WAF1/cip1 in human, animal models of colon cancer and colon cancer cells. In this study, we treated human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and lung cancer cell line A549 as well as colon cancer cell line SW620 with sulindac to observe the effects of sulindac in other tissue sites. In all cell lines, proliferation was significantly inhibited by sulindac after 24 and 72 h of treatment. Apoptosis was induced by sulindac in both lung cancer cells and colon cancer cells but was not induced in breast cancer cells. Western blots showed that p21 protein level were induced by sulindac in lung cancer cells and colon cancer cells, but not in breast cancer cells. Most importantly, the suppression of β-catenin, a key mediator of Wnt signaling pathway, was seen in all three cell lines with sulindac administration. Further studies revealed that transcriptional activities of β-catenin were significantly inhibited by sulindac and that the inhibition was sulindac dosage-dependent. The transcriptional targets of β-catenin, c-myc, cyclin D1 and cdk 4 were also dramatically downregulated. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that the efficacy of sulindac in the inhibition of cell proliferation (rather than the induction of apoptosis) might be through the suppression of β-catenin pathway in human cancer cells.

1 Introduction

Sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is known to prevent recurrence and reduce colorectal polyps in number and size in patients with familial adenomatous polyposi ( Clevers, 2006 ; Kelloff et al., 2006 ; Szabo, 2006 ). The molecular mechanisms underlying these biological effects are not completely understood. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) underlies part of this effect. However, COX-independent mechanisms may also play a role, since NSAIDs inhibit the growth of colon cancer cell lines lacking COX-2 expression ( Smith et al., 2000 ; Zhang et al., 1999 ). Our previous study showed that cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 WAF/cip1 was an important determinant of intestinal cell response to sulindac in vitro and in vivo ( Yang et al., 2005a ; Yang et al., 2001 ). Our recent study demonstrated that c-jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) was synergistic with p21WAF1 to inhibit cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo by sulindac ( Song et al., 2007 ). Other studies have shown that β-catenin could be a target for NSAIDs in colorectal adenomas of patients and colorectal cancer cell lines ( Boon et al., 2004 ; Bordonaro et al., 1999 ; Dihlmann et al., 2001 ; Gardner et al., 2004 ).

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is tightly regulated and has important functions in development, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. Oncogenic activation of the Wnt-signalling pathway by mutations in Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or β-catenin, which results in the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin and in β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) 4 - regulated transcription of TCF target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-MYC, is mandatory for the initial neoplastic transformation of intestinal epithelium ( Wong and Pignatelli, 2002 ). Recent studies also found that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is important for both initiation and progression of cancers of different tissues/organs, including liver ( Lee et al., 2006 ), prostate ( Terry et al., 2006 ), breast ( Turashvili et al., 2006 ), esophagus ( Clement et al., 2007 ) and lung ( Mazieres et al., 2005 ). Thus, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is becoming a promising target for chemoprevention and chemotherapy ( Herbst and Kolligs, 2007 ; Luo et al., 2007 ).

In the present study, we determined the effects of sulindac on breast and lung cancer cells as well as colorectal cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that sulindac inhibited human cancer cell proliferation in breast, lung and colon cancer cells, which was associated with suppression of β-catenin expression and decrease of transcriptional activities and its transcriptional targets cyclin D1, c-myc and cdk4, and that sulindac-induced apoptosis in cancer cells was mainly associated with induction of p21WAF1/cip1.

4. Discussion

Our data provides a direct evidence that sulindac inhibits cell proliferation (rather than induces apoptosis) in breast and lung cancer cells, as well as colorectal cancer cells, which is associated with the suppression of β-catenin; and that sulindac induces apoptosis in colon and lung cancer cells, which is associated with the reduction of β-catenin and the induction of p21 WAF/cip1 . Thus, in addition to colorectal cancer, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling might be a target of sulindac in lung cancer and breast cancer.

The growing evidence has indicated that sulindac targets nuclear β-catenin accumulation and Wnt signaling in colorectal cancers in vivo and in vitro ( Boon et al., 2004 ; Chang et al., 2005 ; Gardner et al., 2004 ; He et al., 1999 ; Koornstra et al., 2005 ; Rice et al., 2003 ; Rice et al., 2006 ), but that sulindac targeting β-catenin in other sites is rare. Even recent report indicated that NSAIDs inhibition of β-catenin required the high level expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) and its co-receptor retinoid-X-receptor α (RXR-α) ( Lu et al., 2005 ), how they are interacting to the response to NSAIDs remains unclear and needs further investigation.

Hyperactivation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, caused by mutations of β-catenin, APC and axin, is one of the most frequent abnormalities in human cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, but such mutation in breast cancer is rare. However, several studies have indicated the importance of Wnt signaling pathways in human breast cancer, and there is strong confirmation for an elevated level of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic β-catenin detected by immunohistochemical staining in breast carcinomas ( Jonsson et al., 2000 ; Lin et al., 2000 ; Ryo et al., 2001 ; Turashvili et al., 2006 ) which correlates with the expression of β-catenin target gene cyclin D1 and poor patient prognosis ( Ryo et al., 2001 ). However, nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of β-catenin is not detectable in normal breast tissues. In the present study, we found that sulindac targeted β-catenin in breast cancer cells, decreasing β-catenin transcriptional activities, suppressing the expression of β-catenin and its target genes cyclin D1, cdk4 and c-myc, and in turn inhibited cell proliferation. We also noted that the induction of apoptosis, unlike in colorectal and lung cancer cells, was not observed in the breast cancer cells, which might be due to the non-induction of p21 by sulindac. Thus, suppressing β-catenin expression should be a potential approach to chemoprevention and chemotherapy of breast cancer.

Mutation of the β-catenin gene is also uncommon in lung cancer ( Ueda et al., 2001 ). However, overexpression of β-catenin has been reported in lung cancer. It has been reported that increased expression of β-catenin is associated with a high proliferative index and surprisingly with a better prognosis ( Hommura et al., 2002 ). In fact, the real significance of β-catenin expression in lung cancer is still controversial and this might be linked to the complexity of its effects since β-catenin also functions as a cadherin-mediated cell adhesion component ( Barker et al., 2000 ). Our present study demonstrated that both transcriptional activities and protein levels were significantly inhibited by sulindac in lung cancer, which were cooperated with the induction of p21 to inhibit proliferation and to induce apoptosis, with the effects of suppression of cyclin D1, c-myc and cdk4. Thus, similar as observed in colorectal cancer and breast cancer, β-catenin could be uses as a target for sulindac in the chemoprevention and chemotherapy of lung cancer.

In summary, our data demonstrates that sulindac suppresses β-catenin signaling pathway in lung cancer and breast cancer, in addition to colorectal cancer. The inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in lung cancer and colon cancer cells with sulindac administration provide important evidence for cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, targeted inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is a rational and promising new approach for the therapy of cancers of various origins.
