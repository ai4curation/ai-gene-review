PURPOSE: Localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH) has been associated 
with pathogenic variants in DSG4, encoding a desmosomal protein as well as in 
LIPH and LPAR6, encoding respectively lipase H, which catalyzes the formation of 
2-acyl-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6, a 
receptor for LPA. LPA promotes hair growth and differentiation. In this study we 
aimed at delineating the genetic basis of LAH in patients without pathogenic 
variants in these three genes.
METHODS: Variant analysis was conducted using exome and direct sequencing. We 
then performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR), immunofluorescence staining, immunoblotting, enzymatic, and 
coimmunoprecipitation assays to evaluate the consequences of potential etiologic 
variants.
RESULTS: We identified homozygous variants in C3ORF52 in four individuals with 
LAH. C3ORF52 was found to be coexpressed with lipase H in the inner root sheath 
of the hair follicle and the two proteins were found to directly interact. The 
LAH-causing variants were associated with decreased C3ORF52 expression and 
resulted in markedly reduced lipase H-mediated LPA biosynthesis.
CONCLUSION: LAH can be caused by abnormal function of at least three proteins 
which are necessary for proper LPA biosynthesis.
