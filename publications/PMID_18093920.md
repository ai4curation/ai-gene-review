The single-pass transmembrane domains (TMDs) of the syndecan family of cell 
surface adhesion molecules have been implicated in functional protein-protein 
interactions. Although each paralog contains a conserved GxxxG dimerization 
motif, we show here that the syndecan-1 TMD dimerizes weakly, the syndecan-3 and 
syndecan-4 TMDs each dimerize strongly, and the syndecan-2 TMD dimerizes very 
strongly. These markedly different levels of self-association suggest that 
paralog TMDs play different roles in directing functional interactions of each 
full-length syndecan family member. We further show that each syndecan TMD forms 
detergent-resistant heteromeric complexes with other paralogs, and that these 
interactions exhibit selectivity. Although heteromeric interactions among 
full-length syndecan paralogs have not been reported, we argue that the distinct 
hierarchy of protein-protein interactions mediated by the syndecan TMDs may give 
rise to considerable complexity in syndecan function. The demonstration that TMD 
homodimerization and heterodimerization can be mediated by GxxxG motifs and 
modulated by sequence context has implications for the signaling mechanisms of 
other cell surface receptors, including the integrins and the erbB family.
