The physiological activity of Notch is a function of its ability to increase 
survival in many cell types. Several pathways have been shown to contribute to 
the survival effect of Notch, but the exact mechanism of Notch action is not 
completely understood. Here we identified that the regulation of cell survival 
by Notch intracellular domain could partly be attributed to a selective increase 
of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). We further found that Notch 
intracellular domain inhibited the degradation of XIAP during apoptosis. The 
transactivation domain of Notch interacted directly with the RING region of XIAP 
to block the binding of E2 and prevent the in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination 
of XIAP. This antiapoptotic activity of Notch was abolished when XIAP was 
knocked down. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for Notch-selective 
suppression of apoptosis through an increase in the stability of a key 
antiapoptotic protein, XIAP.
