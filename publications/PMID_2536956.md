A genomic sequence and cloned complementary DNA has been identified for a novel 
receptor-like gene of the PDGF receptor/CSF1 receptor subfamily 
(platelet-derived growth factor receptor/colony-stimulating factor type 1 
receptor). The gene recognized a 6.4-kilobase transcript that was coexpressed in 
normal human tissues with the 5.3-kilobase PDGF receptor messenger RNA. 
Introduction of complementary DNA of the novel gene into COS-1 cells led to 
expression of proteins that were specifically detected with antiserum directed 
against a predicted peptide. When the new gene was transfected into COS-1 cells, 
a characteristic pattern of binding of the PDGF isoforms was observed, which was 
different from the pattern observed with the known PDGF receptor. Tyrosine 
phosphorylation of the receptor in response to the PDGF isoforms was also 
different from the known receptor. The new PDGF receptor gene was localized to 
chromosome 4q11-4q12. The existence of genes encoding two PDGF receptors that 
interact in a distinct manner with three different PDGF isoforms likely confers 
considerable regulatory flexibility in the functional responses to PDGF.
