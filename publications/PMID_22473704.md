OBJECTIVE: The high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) serves as the 
prototypic damage-associated molecular pattern molecule, interacting with a 
variety of defined pattern recognition receptors in the microenvironment of 
damaged or necrotic tissue. As regulatory T cells (T(reg)) play a crucial role 
in autoimmune diseases and tumor immune escape, the previously unexamined role 
of HMGB1 on the function of T(reg) is of great interest.
METHODS: Human CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-) T(reg) and CD4(+)CD25(-)CD127(+) 
conventional T cells (T(con)) were phenotypically analyzed for their 
constitutive as well as HMGB1-modulated expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 
and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Furthermore, the 
influence of recombinant and complexed HMGB1 from necrotic cell supernatant on 
the function of T(reg) and T(con) was investigated.
RESULTS: T(reg) express significantly higher levels of RAGE on the cell surface 
than T(con), while levels of TLR4 are similar. HMGB1 modulates T(reg) biology by 
inducing migration and prolonging survival. Furthermore, HMGB1 enhances IL-10 
release and T(reg) suppressive capacity in a RAGE-dependent manner. In addition, 
HMGB1 directly suppresses IFNγ release of T(con) and inhibits their 
proliferation via TLR4.
CONCLUSION: HMGB1 directly enhances immune inhibitory functions of T(reg) via 
RAGE-mediated mechanisms and limits the number and activity of T(con). HMGB1 
effects on T(reg) may alter immune reactivity in the setting of chronic 
inflammatory states such as cancer.
