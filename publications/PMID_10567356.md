Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a member of the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K) family and an upstream activator of 
the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascade. HPK1 interacts, through its 
proline-rich domains, with growth factor receptor-bound 2 (Grb2), CT10-regulated 
kinase (Crk), and Crk-like (CrkL) adaptor proteins. We identified a novel 
HPK1-interacting protein of 55 kDa (HIP-55), similar to the mouse SH3P7 protein, 
containing an N-terminal actin-binding domain and a C-terminal Src homology 3 
domain. We found that HPK1 bound to HIP-55 both in vitro and in vivo. When 
co-transfected, HIP-55 increased HPK1's kinase activity as well as JNK1's kinase 
activity. A dominant-negative HPK1 mutant blocked activation of JNK1 by HIP-55 
showing that HIP-55 activates the JNK1 signaling pathway via HPK1. Our results 
identify a novel protein, HIP-55, that binds to HPK1 and regulates the JNK1 
signaling cascade.
