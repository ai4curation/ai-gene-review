In this paper we describe the isolation of a cDNA that encodes a human 
TFIIAalpha/beta-like factor (ALF). The open reading frame of ALF predicts a 
protein of 478 amino acids that contains characteristic N- and C-terminal 
conserved domains separated by an internal nonconserved domain. In addition, a 
rare ALF-containing cDNA, which possesses an extended N terminus (Stoned 
B/TFIIAalpha/beta-like factor; SALF) has also been identified. The results of 
Northern and dot blot analyses show that ALF is expressed almost exclusively in 
testis; in contrast, TFIIAalpha/beta and TFIIAgamma are enriched in testis but 
are also widely expressed in other human tissues. Recombinant ALF (69 kDa) and 
TFIIAgamma (12 kDa) polypeptides produced in Escherichia coli form an ALF/gamma 
complex that can stabilize TBP-TATA interactions in an electrophoretic mobility 
shift assay. The ALF/gamma complex is also able to restore transcription from 
the adenovirus major late promoter using HeLa cell nuclear extracts that have 
been depleted of TFIIA. Overall, the data show that ALF is a functional homolog 
of human general transcription factor TFIIAalpha/beta that may be uniquely 
important to testis biology.
