Root growth is sustained by cell division and differentiation of the root apical 
meristem (RAM), in which brassinosteroid (BR) signaling mediated via the dynamic 
targeting of BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) plays complex roles. BRI1 is 
constitutively secreted to the plasma membrane (PM), internalized, and recycled 
or delivered into vacuoles, whose PM abundance is critical for BR signaling. 
Vesicle-target membrane fusion is regulated by heterotetrameric SNARE complexes. 
SNARE proteins have been implicated in BRI1 targeting, but how SNAREs affect RAM 
development is unclear. We report that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) YKT61, 
an atypical R-SNARE protein, is critical for BR-controlled RAM development 
through the dynamic targeting of BRI1. Functional loss of YKT61 is lethal for 
both male and female gametophytes. By using weak mutant alleles of YKT61, 
ykt61-partially complemented (ykt61-pc), we show that YKT61 knockdown results in 
a reduction of RAM length due to reduced cell division, similar to that in 
bri1-116. YKT61 physically interacts with BRI1 and is critical for the dynamic 
recycling of BRI1 to the PM. We further determine that YKT61 is critical for the 
dynamic biogenesis of vacuoles, for the maintenance of Golgi morphology, and for 
endocytosis, which may have a broad effect on development. Endomembrane 
compartments connected via vesicular machinery, such as SNAREs, influence 
nuclear-controlled cellular activities such as division and differentiation by 
affecting the dynamic targeting of membrane proteins, supporting a 
retro-signaling pathway from the endomembrane system to the nucleus.
