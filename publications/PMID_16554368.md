The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport, ESCRT-I, -II, and -III, 
are thought to mediate the biogenesis of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) and 
endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Here, we have compared the 
importance of the ESCRT-I subunit tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101) and the 
ESCRT-III subunit hVps24/CHMP3 for endosomal functions and receptor signaling. 
Like Tsg101, endogenous hVps24 localized mainly to late endosomes. Depletion of 
hVps24 by siRNA showed that this ESCRT subunit, like Tsg101, is important for 
degradation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and for 
transport of the receptor from early endosomes to lysosomes. Surprisingly, 
however, whereas depletion of Tsg101 caused sustained EGF activation of the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, depletion of hVps24 had no such 
effect. Moreover, depletion of Tsg101 but not of hVps24 caused a major fraction 
of internalized EGF to accumulate in nonacidified endosomes. Electron microscopy 
of hVps24-depleted cells showed an accumulation of EGFRs in MVEs that were 
significantly smaller than those in control cells, probably because of an 
impaired fusion with lyso-bisphosphatidic acid-positive late 
endosomes/lysosomes. Together, our results reveal functional differences between 
ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III in degradative protein trafficking and indicate that 
degradation of the EGFR is not required for termination of its signaling.

INTRODUCTION

Membrane-bound receptors are key transmitters of cell signaling. When activated by their respective ligands, different receptors activate various intracellular signaling pathways that control transcription, cytoskeletal functions, or membrane trafficking. Even though receptor signaling has classically been thought to occur from the plasma membrane, accumulating evidence suggests that at least some receptors can transmit signals from endomembranes such as endosomes as well. Moreover, signaling from endomembranes may be qualitatively different from signaling from the plasma membrane, thereby providing additional opportunities for spatial regulation of signal transduction ( Ceresa and Schmid, 2000 ; Sorkin and Von Zastrow, 2002 ).

Owing to their involvement in carcinogenesis, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (EGFRs) are among the most intensively studied receptors of mammalian cells ( Rubin and Yarden, 2001 ), and their downstream signaling, such as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphoinositide kinase pathways, have been characterized in detail ( Pawson, 2004 ). The finding that inhibition of endocytosis with dominant-negative dynamin constructs inhibits EGF-induced activation of the MAP kinase pathway has led to the view that this pathway is activated by ligand-bound EGFRs that reside in the limiting membrane of endosomes ( Vieira et al ., 1996 ). It has thus been proposed that EGF-activated MAP kinase activation is silenced when the activated receptors become internalized into intraluminal vesicles of endosomes and subsequently are degraded by lysosomal enzymes as the multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) fuse with lysosomes ( Futter et al ., 1996 ). Such degradation is thought to be essential for termination of EGFR signaling, and its impairment has been associated with carcinogenesis ( Dikic and Giordano, 2003 ; Bache et al ., 2004b ; Polo et al ., 2004 ). It is therefore important to characterize the mechanisms of EGFR down-regulation thoroughly.

A molecular machinery, first identified in yeast as part of the vacuolar protein sorting (vps) machinery, has proven important for the endosomal sorting of EGFRs into the degradative MVE pathway ( Katzmann et al ., 2002 ; Babst et al ., 2002b ; Raiborg et al ., 2003 ). On activation and internalization, the multiubiquitinated EGFR interacts with a complex that contains the ubiquitin-binding protein hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) on the endosome membrane ( Bache et al ., 2003b ; Sigismund et al ., 2005 ). Hrs recruits the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, ESCRT-I ( Bache et al ., 2003a ), which is thought to capture the ubiquitinated cargo through its ubiquitin-binding subunit tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101) ( Sundquist et al ., 2004 ). By analogy with the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated cargo in yeast, the ubiquitinated EGFR has been further assumed to be delivered to ESCRT-II before it gets internalized into MVEs through the activity of ESCRT-III ( Katzmann et al ., 2002 ). In support of this idea, depletion of ESCRT-I subunits has been shown to inhibit ligand-induced EGFR degradation ( Bishop et al ., 2002 ; Bache et al ., 2003b , 2004a ), as has overexpression of an N-terminal fragment of the human ESCRT-III subunit hVps24 ( Yan et al ., 2005 ). However, the relationship between endosomal trafficking of the EGFR and its signaling properties has been less explored. What is known is that hrs mutant Drosophila embryos show enhanced EGF signaling ( Lloyd et al ., 2002 ) and that EGF-induced activation of the MAP kinase pathway is enhanced in cell lines with impaired Tsg101 function ( Babst et al ., 2000 ). The roles of ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III in receptor silencing have not been examined.

In the present work, we have analyzed the function of hVps24 in the trafficking and signaling of EGFRs. Unexpectedly, we find that hVps24 depletion affects degradation but not signaling of EGFRs. This indicates that Tsg101 and hVps24 have distinct functions in the regulation of receptor trafficking and that endosomal receptor silencing occurs independently of proteolytic degradation.

DISCUSSION

The termination of receptor signaling in endosomes is thought to be of great importance for the duration of cell signaling events, and its impairment has been implicated in carcinogenesis ( Dikic and Giordano, 2003 ). Here, we have shown that two ESCRT subunits play differential roles in silencing of the EGFR. Although the ESCRT-I subunit Tsg101 is required for efficient silencing of EGF-induced activation of the MAP kinase pathway, this was not the case for the ESCRT-III subunit hVps24. Because both Tsg101 and hVps24 were found important for ligand-induced degradation of the EGFR, this reveals that silencing of MEK/ERK signaling from endosomes can occur independently of EGFR degradation.

Based on previous studies with yeast Vps24 ( Babst et al ., 2002a ) and with the N-terminal part of hVps24 ( Yan et al ., 2005 ), the requirement of hVps24 for EGFR degradation was expected. However, it was unexpected that MEK/ERK activity was silenced in the virtual absence of hVps24. It seems implausible that this can be explained by inefficient siRNA-mediated knockdown, because the extent of hVps24 depletion was high and had a strong effect on EGFR degradation. In principle, the receptor could be silenced in four different ways: 1) by proteolytic degradation, 2) by dissociation of ligand at low endosomal pH, 3) by engagement of the cytosolic tail of the receptor by ESCRT complexes that prevent access of signaling mediators, or 4) by sequestration of the receptor in intraluminal vesicles of the endosome. Our results indicate that the EGFR is silenced through one of the three latter mechanisms, or through a combination of these mechanisms.

How can it be explained that knockdown of Tsg101 and hVps24 similarly inhibits degradation of the EGFR but differentially affects its silencing? There may be several explanations for this paradox. First, although a recent study showed that Tsg101 depletion causes the formation of multicisternal endosomes without intraluminal vesicles ( Doyotte et al ., 2005 ), we found here that hVps24 depletion results in the accumulation of EGFRs in small endosomes that do contain intraluminal vesicles. This raises the possibility that EGFRs can signal from the limiting membranes of multicisternal endosomes in Tsg101-depleted cells, but not from intraluminal endosomal vesicles in hVps24-depleted cells. Second, depletion of Tsg101 caused EGF to accumulate in endosomes with a close to neutral pH, whereas EGF-containing endosomes in hVps24-depleted cells were acidic. Because EGF only dissociates from its receptor at low pH ( Skarpen et al ., 1998 ), this could mean that receptors in the limiting membranes of endosomes from Tsg101-depleted cells are ligand bound and therefore active, whereas endosomal EGFRs in hVps24-depleted cells are signaling incompetent because of low pH-induced dissociation of EGF. Third, it is known that depletion of Tsg101 causes depletion of the entire ESCRT-I ( Bache et al ., 2004a ), whereas Vps24 is not required for the intactness of ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and the Vps20/Vps32 subcomplex of ESCRT-III ( Babst et al ., 2002a ). This raises the possibility that EGFRs can signal from the limiting membrane of endosomes in Tsg101-depleted cells, whereas receptors in hVps24-depleted cells may be engaged in ESCRT complexes that render them inaccessible to the signaling machinery. Fourth, even though the detected MEK and ERK phosphorylation was dependent on EGF stimulation, we cannot rule out the possibility that the aberrant MEK/ERK activity observed in Tsg101-depleted cells may involve mechanisms that are independent of EGFR activity. Regardless of the mechanism, our results have uncovered a difference in the requirements of the ESCRT-I subunit Tsg101 and the ESCRT-III subunit hVps24 in the silencing of EGF-activated MAP kinase activation. The relationships between ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III may therefore be less linear than previously thought.

In the light of current models for MVE biogenesis, the differential effects of Tsg101 and hVps24 depletion on the pH on EGF-containing endosomes was unexpected and suggest that Tsg101 but not hVps24 is required for normal transport of EGF from early endosomes to a compartment with low pH. Alternatively, Tsg101 but not hVps24 might be needed for the acquisition of proton pumps in endosomal membranes. However, because of the bimodal distribution of FITC-EGF in acidic and less acidic endosomes and the highly acidic pH (<5, measured by FITC-dextran; our unpublished data) of lysosomes in Tsg101-depleted cells ( Figure 7 ), we favor the interpretation that Tsg101 is required for EGF trafficking, not endosomal acidification as such. But if the EGFR accumulates in properly acidified endosomes in hVps24-depleted cells, why is degradation of the EGFR inhibited? One possibility is that hVps24 might be required for activation of cathepsin B, which is known to mediate degradation of the EGFR ( Authier et al ., 1995 ). However, we did not detect any change in cathepsin B activity in hVps24-depleted cells (our unpublished data). Our immunofluorescence and electron microscopic analyses indicated that normal MVE biogenesis and progression into late endosomes/lysosomes were attenuated in hVps24-depleted cells. We therefore propose that hVps24 is important for the fusion of MVEs with lysosomes, which contain hydrolytic enzymes needed for receptor degradation. This implies a novel function for hVps24 distinct from its suggested role in MVE biogenesis and sorting ( Babst et al ., 2002a ).

Previous studies have revealed that fluid phase transport from early endosomes to lysosomes is regulated differentially than receptor trafficking ( Petiot et al ., 2003 ; Gruenberg and Stenmark, 2004 ). The finding that EGFR trafficking but not fluid phase transport from early endosomes to lysosomes requires hVps24 is consistent with this concept. In this context, it is also worth noting that EGFRs have recently been found to accumulate in a subset of MVEs that are distinct from LBPA-containing MVEs ( White et al ., 2006 ). This indicates the existence of multiple parallel pathways between early endosomes and lysosomes.

A previous study concluded that endogenous hVps24 is localized to the TGN ( Yan et al ., 2005 ), whereas here we found hVps24 to localize to late endosomes, especially those positive for CD63. The differential results are unlikely to have arisen from use of different cell lines, because both studies used HeLa cells as one of two cell lines examined. However, because late endosomes are often found in the juxtanuclear area, where the TGN is also located, TGN and late endosomal markers may sometimes yield partially overlapping staining patterns at the light-microscopic level. A localization of hVps24 to late endosomes is consistent with a previously found localization of Tsg101 to these organelles, and with a function for hVps24 in endosomal trafficking. Even though hVps24 is enriched on late endosomes, this does not mean that hVps24 is initially recruited to these organelles. On overexpression of Hrs, Tsg101 can be seen to accumulate on early endosomes, suggesting that ESCRT-I is initially recruited to early endosomes ( Bache et al ., 2003a ). Similarly, overexpressed hVps24 can be found on early endosomes ( Yan et al ., 2005 ), and we did observe a few EEA1-positive structures that labeled for endogenous hVps24 ( Figure 1 , A–D). We therefore hypothesize that hVps24 is recruited to early endosomes but remains endosome associated through endosomal maturation or trafficking. Because early endosomes are more short lived than late endosomes, the bulk of hVps24 is therefore detected on late endosomes at steady state.

In the present work, we have revealed some unexpected differences in the functions of the ESCRT-I subunit Tsg101 and the ESCRT-III subunit hVps24. Both subunits are required for ligand-induced degradation of EGFRs, but only Tsg101 is required for termination of EGF signaling from endosomes. This indicates that endosomal silencing of receptor signaling is more complex than previously thought and warrants further studies on the function of ESCRTs in receptor trafficking and signaling. It is interesting to note that although no ESCRT-III subunits have so far been implicated in cancer, this has been the case for two ESCRT-I subunits, Tsg101 and hVps37A/HCRP1 ( Li and Cohen, 1996 ; Xu et al ., 2003 ). It is thus possible that ESCRT-I plays a particularly important role in signal termination on endosomes. Further studies on the connections between the endosomal sorting machinery and carcinogenesis will elucidate this role.
