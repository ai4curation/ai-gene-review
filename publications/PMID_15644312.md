Tom40 is the channel-forming subunit of the translocase of the mitochondrial 
outer membrane (TOM complex), essential for protein import into mitochondria. 
Tom40 is synthesized in the cytosol and contains information for its 
mitochondrial targeting and assembly. A number of stable import intermediates 
have been identified for Tom40 precursors in fungi, the first being an 
association with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) of the outer membrane. 
By examining the import pathway of human Tom40, we have been able to elucidate 
additional features in its import. We identify that Hsp90 is involved in 
delivery of the Tom40 precursor to mitochondria in an ATP-dependent manner. The 
precursor then forms its first stable intermediate with the outer face of the 
TOM complex before its membrane integration and assembly. Deletion of an 
evolutionary conserved region within Tom40 disrupts the TOM complex intermediate 
and causes it to stall at a new complex in the intermembrane space that we 
identify to be the mammalian SAM. Unlike its fungal counterparts, the human 
Tom40 precursor is not found stably arrested at a SAM intermediate. 
Nevertheless, we show that Tom40 assembly is reduced in mitochondria depleted of 
human Sam50. These findings are discussed in context with current models from 
fungal studies.
