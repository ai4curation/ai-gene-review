This study reports cloning and characterization of SPAP2, a novel transmembrane 
protein. The extracellular portion of SPAP2 contains six immunoglobulin-like 
domains and its intracellular segment has two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based 
activation motifs (ITAMs) and two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition 
motifs (ITIMs). We also identified four alternatively spliced products. Sequence 
alignment with the genomic database revealed that the SPAP2 gene contains 16 
exons and is localized at chromosome 1q21. PCR analyses demonstrated that SPAP2 
mRNA is expressed in restricted human tissues including the kidney, salivary 
gland, adrenal gland, uterus, and bone marrow. Tyrosine-phosphorylated SPAP2 is 
specifically associated with SH2 domain-containing tyrosine kinases Syk and 
Zap70 and SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. 
Site-specific mutagenesis studies revealed that tyrosyl residues 650 and 662 
embedded in the ITIMs are responsible for the binding of Syk and Zap70 while 
tyrosyl residues 692 and 722 embedded in the ITIMs are involved in interactions 
with SHP-1 and SHP-2. Finally, recruitment of SHP-1 to the 
tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIMs led to a marked activation of the enzyme.
