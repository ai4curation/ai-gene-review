d-Glyceric aciduria (DGA) due to d-glycerate kinase deficiency (DGKD) is a rare 
autosomal-recessive inborn error of metabolism that is usually linked to the 
metabolism of fructose and serine. We describe a Moroccan patient with DGKD 
whose metabolic defect has been characterized by metabolite studies, sequencing 
of genomic DNA and by studies on the RNA level. Since birth the index patient 
presented with severe muscular hypotonia, joint hypermobility and tremor. 
Enantioselective analysis showed elevated d-glyceric acid in the urine of the 
patient, but not in that of his parents. DNA analysis revealed homozygosity in 
the GLYCTK gene for c.517G>T [p.(Val173Leu)], the first mutation reported for 
exon 3 of this gene, as well as for the c.530-4A>G polymorphism. RNA studies 
suggest that none of these sequence variants affects splicing. The mother was 
heterozygous for both sequence variants, the father heterozygous for the first 
one and homozygous for the polymorphism, which further supports that c.517G>T is 
the functionally relevant nucleotide change. The conservation of GLYCTK 
throughout evolution suggests an important biological role of this enzyme, 
although it is not known yet how mutations are linked to clinical features. 
Future studies should investigate the molecular defect in a more general way and 
search for additional roles of GLYCTK beyond its established role in catabolism 
of serine and fructose.
