Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a recently described natural endogenous 
immunosuppressive cytokine that has been identified in human, murine, and other 
organisms. Human IL-10 (hIL-10) has high homology with murine IL-10 (mIL-10) as 
well as with an Epstein-Barr virus genome product BCRFI. This viral IL-10 
(vIL-10) shares a number of activities with hIL-10. IL-10 significantly affects 
chemokine biology, because human IL-10 inhibits chemokine production and is a 
specific chemotactic factor for CD8+ T cells. It suppresses the ability of CD4+ 
T cells, but not CD8+ T cells, to migrate in response to IL-8. A nonapeptide 
(IT9302) with complete homology to a sequence of hIL-10 located in the 
C-terminal portion (residues 152-160) of the cytokine was found to possess 
activities that mimic some of those of hIL-10. These are: (i) inhibition of 
IL-1beta-induced IL-8 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cell, (ii) 
inhibition of spontaneous IL-8 production by cultured human monocytes, (iii) 
induction of IL-1 receptor antagonistic protein production by human monocytes, 
(iv) induction of chemotactic migration of CD8+ human T lymphocytes in vitro, 
(v) desensitization of human CD8+ T cells resulting in an unresponsiveness 
toward rhIL-10-induced chemotaxis, (vi) suppression of the chemotactic response 
of CD4+ T human lymphocytes toward IL-8, (vii) induction of IL-4 production by 
cultured normal human CD4+ T cells, (viii) down-regulation of tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha production by CD8+ T cells, and (ix) inhibition of class II major 
histocompatibility complex antigen expression on IFN-gamma-stimulated human 
monocytes. Another nonapeptide (IT9403) close to the NH2-terminal part of hIL-10 
did not reveal cytokine synthesis inhibitory properties, but proved to be a 
regulator of mast cell proliferation. In conclusion, we have identified two 
functional domains of IL-10 exerting different IL-10 like activities, an 
observation that suggests that relatively small segments of these signal 
proteins are responsible for particular biological functions.
