FANCJ also called BACH1/BRIP1 was first linked to hereditary breast cancer 
through its direct interaction with BRCA1. FANCJ was also recently identified as 
a Fanconi anemia (FA) gene product, establishing FANCJ as an essential tumor 
suppressor. Similar to other FA cells, FANCJ-null (FA-J) cells accumulate 4N DNA 
content in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). This accumulation is 
corrected by reintroduction of wild-type FANCJ. Here, we show that FANCJ 
interacts with the mismatch repair complex MutLalpha, composed of PMS2 and MLH1. 
Specifically, FANCJ directly interacts with MLH1 independent of BRCA1, through 
its helicase domain. Genetic studies reveal that FANCJ helicase activity and 
MLH1 binding, but not BRCA1 binding, are essential to correct the FA-J cells' 
ICL-induced 4N DNA accumulation and sensitivity to ICLs. These results suggest 
that the FANCJ/MutLalpha interaction, but not FANCJ/BRCA1 interaction, is 
essential for establishment of a normal ICL-induced response. The functional 
role of the FANCJ/MutLalpha complex demonstrates a novel link between FA and 
MMR, and predicts a broader role for FANCJ in DNA damage signaling independent 
of BRCA1.
