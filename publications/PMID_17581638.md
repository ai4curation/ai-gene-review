Abstract

FANCJ also called BACH1/BRIP1 was first linked to hereditary breast cancer through its direct interaction with BRCA1. FANCJ was also recently identified as a Fanconi anemia (FA) gene product, establishing FANCJ as an essential tumor suppressor. Similar to other FA cells, FANCJ-null (FA-J) cells accumulate 4N DNA content in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). This accumulation is corrected by reintroduction of wild-type FANCJ. Here, we show that FANCJ interacts with the mismatch repair complex MutLα, composed of PMS2 and MLH1. Specifically, FANCJ directly interacts with MLH1 independent of BRCA1, through its helicase domain. Genetic studies reveal that FANCJ helicase activity and MLH1 binding, but not BRCA1 binding, are essential to correct the FA-J cells' ICL-induced 4N DNA accumulation and sensitivity to ICLs. These results suggest that the FANCJ/MutLα interaction, but not FANCJ/BRCA1 interaction, is essential for establishment of a normal ICL-induced response. The functional role of the FANCJ/MutLα complex demonstrates a novel link between FA and MMR, and predicts a broader role for FANCJ in DNA damage signaling independent of BRCA1.

Introduction

In the absence of DNA repair proteins, cell cycle checkpoints and/or DNA damage repair pathways are not properly activated. This inability to actively respond to DNA damage can lead to massive chromosomal damage and even cell death. In some cases, mutations in DNA repair proteins can contribute to multiple cancer syndromes. Studies on the genetic causes of the cancer-prone syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA) revealed that genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast cancer were also associated with FA. For example, the hereditary breast cancer gene, BRCA2 was shown to be the gene defect in the FA-D1 patient complementation group, revealing that BRCA2 was FANCD1 ( Howlett et al , 2002 ). Likewise, FANCJ (also called BACH1/BRIP1) was identified as the gene defective in the FANCJ-null (FA-J) patient complementation group ( Levitus et al , 2005 ; Levran et al , 2005 ; Litman et al , 2005 ), and was initially linked to hereditary breast cancer. This link was based on its direct binding to BRCA1 and through the identification of two breast cancer patients with mutations in FANCJ, which also altered its helicase activity in vitro ( Cantor et al , 2004 , 2001 ). This connection was furthered by the finding that FANCJ (BRIP1) mutations confer a two-fold increase in the risk of developing breast cancer ( Seal et al , 2006 ).

While other FA genes have not been linked to breast cancer, the network of at least 13 genes (designated FANCA to FANCN ) is critical for maintaining chromosomal integrity ( Thompson, 2005 ). Although the molecular function of these proteins is not clear, several gene products, including FANCA, B, C, D, E, F, G, L and M, form a nuclear core complex (the FA core complex), that is required for monoubiquitination of FANCD2. The FA proteins BRCA2/FANCD1, PALB2/FANCN and FANCJ are not required for this event and are considered downstream of FANCD2 monoubiquitination. Nevertheless, all FA proteins contribute to processing interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) ( Thompson, 2005 ). Consequently, in the absence of FA proteins, ICL treatment leads to reduced cell viability and an accumulation of cells with a 4N DNA content representing cells in either late S or G2/M. This ICL-induced cell cycle progression defect and sensitivity to ICLs is restored upon reintroduction of the missing FA gene ( Dutrillaux et al , 1982 ; Kaiser et al , 1982 ; Kupfer and D'Andrea, 1996 ; Kupfer et al , 1997 ; Heinrich et al , 1998 ; Sala-Trepat et al , 2000 ; Chandra et al , 2005 ). However, the FA-related function or associated partners required for a proper ICL response is not known.

Consistent with other FA cells, FA-J cells have an ICL-induced cell cycle progression defect that can be corrected upon re-introduction of wild-type (WT) FANCJ cDNA ( Litman et al , 2005 ). This cell cycle progression defect has also been described as a prolonged G2/M arrest ( Miglierina et al , 1991 ) or 4N DNA content accumulation ( Akkari et al , 2001 ). The cause of this ICL response in FA cells is not presently understood, but is thought to involve delayed repair and/or failure to restart replication ( Thompson et al , 2005 ). Unlike the majority of FA proteins, FANCJ has defined domains. Specifically, FANCJ binds directly to BRCA1 ( Cantor et al , 2001 ) and is a DNA helicase ( Cantor et al , 2004 ). Determining the importance of these domains could further our understanding of how FA proteins function in an ICL-induced response. Attempts to define the functions of FANCJ domains in the ICL response have been limited to chicken DT40 cells, where the FANCJ/BRCA1 interaction is not conserved ( Bridge et al , 2005 ). If FANCJ operates independent of BRCA1 for a particular ICL response function, a remaining question will be whether FANCJ forms a complex with other proteins independent of BRCA1 to perform that function.

Here, we investigated whether FANCJ helicase activity or the FANCJ interaction with two distinct proteins was required for restoring FANCJ's ICL response. Specifically, we identified that FANCJ interacts with the MutLα mismatch repair complex, independent of BRCA1. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that the FANCJ/MLH1 interaction is as critical as FANCJ helicase activity for restoring a normal cell cycle progression and resistance of FA-J cells to ICLs. In contrast, the FANCJ/BRCA1 interaction is dispensable for normalizing the response of FA-J cells to ICLs, suggesting that FANCJ functions in distinct complexes to facilitate multifaceted DNA repair functions.

Discussion

In this study, we addressed whether FANCJ helicase activity or different FANCJ complexes are essential for FANCJ's function in the ICL response. Specifically, we have shown that FANCJ forms a complex with the MutLα heterodimer, which is composed of the mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and PMS2. FANCJ directly interacts with MLH1 independent of BRCA1, and this DNA-independent interaction is within the FANCJ helicase domain, C-terminal to nucleotide binding box 1, and includes lysines 141 and 142. This is the first report that demonstrates that a direct interaction between FANCJ and MLH1 is as essential for the ICL-induced response as the FANCJ helicase activity. Furthermore, our data suggest that formation of a FANCJ/BRCA1 complex is not required for normalization of the ICL-induced response in FA-J cells.

The question remains as to how FANCJ or mismatch repair proteins function in the ICL response. Following exposure to ICLs, ATR is activated and initiates a signal cascade through the phosphorylation of downstream substrates, ultimately leading to checkpoint activation, DNA damage repair and/or apoptosis. Intriguingly, MMR proteins were recently proposed to act as direct sensors of DNA methylation and initiate the intra S-phase checkpoint, by helping to recruit ATR-ATRIP to sites of DNA damage ( Yoshioka et al , 2006 ). Furthermore, mismatch repair proteins have been implicated in sensing and processing ICLs. In particular, the MutSβ complex was shown to bind to intrastrand crosslinks produced by cisplatin ( Duckett et al , 1996 ; Yamada et al , 1997 ), and the MutSβ complex was shown to be involved with the removal of ICLs produced by psoralen ( Zhang et al , 2002 ). Furthermore, in the absence of MMR signaling, ICL repair proceeded in an alternate pathway promoting a non-recombination-dependent mechanism ( Zheng et al , 2006 ). Our study now suggests that MLH1 binding to FANCJ is functionally important for the ICL-induced response, as disruption of the native FANCJ/MLH1 interaction reduced cell survival following ICL treatment. Moreover, FANCJ K141/142A mutant, defective in MLH1 binding, fails to correct FA-J cells. The finding that MLH1 deficiency did not generate gross changes in the cellular survival following ICLs may stem from the loss of both MMR DNA damage repair and signaling. In fact, the loss of DNA damage signaling and the subsequent repair is essential in establishing the resistance of MMR-deficient cells to DNA methylation ( O'Brien and Brown, 2006 ). The multiplicity of MMR functions in the DNA damage response has been recently uncovered through separation-of-function mutations ( O'Brien and Brown, 2006 ).

Here, we attempted a similar approach to dissect the role of MLH1 and FANCJ in the ICL response. Three approaches were attempted to selectively ablate the FANCJ/MLH1 interaction in vivo . In one of these approaches, we attempted to generate an MLH1 mutant that lacked FANCJ binding. While MLH1 and FANCJ bind directly in vitro , the interaction is facilitated by PMS2 in vivo . In the absence of PMS2, FANCJ binding to MLH1 requires two MLH1 C-terminal domains D1 (478–508) and D2 (736–744). However, in the presence of PMS2, only one of these domains was required. Moreover, both the regions on MLH1 (703–725) required for FANCJ binding in the presence of PMS2 are also essential for PMS2 stabilization. The complexity of the MLH1/PMS2/FANCJ interaction confounded attempts to selectively ablate the FANCJ/MLH1 interaction through MLH1 mutagenesis. Fortunately, the binding of MLH1 to FANCJ was less complex and therefore, the FANCJ/MLH1 interaction could be selectively disrupted by both mutagenesis and peptide disruption. We found that disruption of this complex caused defects in the ICL response, consistent with the MLH1/FANCJ interaction being required for ICL repair.

Conceivably, for ICL repair, mismatch repair complexes including MutLα, mobilize or regulate FANCJ helicase activity to unwind DNA in the vicinity of the DNA damage to facilitate repair processes. Thus, disruption of FANCJ helicase activity or MLH1 binding could interfere with ICL response. In support of this possibility, the MLH1 homologue in Escherichia coli , MutL binds the DNA helicase UvrD gene product Helicase II ( Hall et al , 1998 ; Spampinato and Modrich, 2000 ) and stimulates its helicase activity ( Dao and Modrich, 1998 ; Yamaguchi et al , 1998 ). However, we did not detect an effect of the MutLα complex, inhibitory or stimulatory, on FANCJ catalyzed unwinding of a forked duplex, 5′ flap, or Holliday Junction substrate (data not shown). It is possible that regulation of FANCJ helicase activity by MLH1 may require additional MMR proteins, and/or that the physical interaction between FANCJ and MLH1 serves a non-catalytic role in mediating the ICL response.

Alternatively, the catalytic activity of FANCJ may serve an entirely different purpose (see Figure 7 ). For example, the FANCJ helicase activity could serve to displace MutLα from DNA. This type of model has also been proposed for other helicases. For example, the Srs2 helicase is proposed to displace a checkpoint protein to facilitate checkpoint exit ( Vaze et al , 2002 ). If true, in the absence of FANCJ (FA-J cells), or in FA-J cells with a catalytically inactive FANCJ and/or a FANCJ mutant that lacks MLH1 binding, the MutLα complex would fail to be displaced from DNA. As such, the MutLα complex would be stuck or take longer to be displaced from DNA, leading to a prolonged G2/M arrest and/or delay in the completion of repair. In support of this model, ICL treatment of FA-J cells reconstituted with vector, K52R or K141/142A FANCJ constructs demonstrates both hyper-G2/M arrest and sensitivity to ICLs. Furthermore, peptide perturbation of the MLH1/FANCJ interaction in MCF7 cells lead to enhanced ICL sensitivity.

This proposed role for FANCJ in displacing MutLα is also not at odds with the finding that suppression of the MutLα complex in MCF7 cells did not lead to MMC sensitivity ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). It has been reported that in the absence of MMR signaling there is a reduced G2/M arrest following DNA damage ( O'Brien and Brown, 2006 ), and compensating non-recombination repair pathways are engaged ( Zheng et al , 2006 ). The expectation from these findings would be that MMR-deficient cells would have a normalized sensitivity to ICLs, due to the defective checkpoint and compensation by alternative mechanisms of repair (see model in Figure 7 ). Ultimately, it will be critical to establish whether a FANCJ/MLH1 complex facilitates ICL repair by promoting homologous recombination or other repair functions. While ablation of BRCA1 binding to FANCJ may not affect the ability of FANCJ to correct the defective response of FA-J cells, the timing or mechanism of repair may be altered. Thus, it is important to consider that the FA-J cells lacking the FANCJ/BRCA1 interaction resist the ICL-induced 4N arrest and sensitivity through an alternative mechanism, perhaps by checkpoint avoidance. Experiments are currently underway to investigate this possibility.

Although MMR proteins are essential to elicit a G2/M arrest, it is presently unclear as to how this arrest is overcome. In cells lacking the active FANCJ helicase and/or a FANCJ/MLH1 interaction, diffusion of the MutLα complex from DNA may lead to an eventual exit from this G2/M arrest. In contrast, this exit may not be achieved in FA-J cells expressing the K52R FANCJ, if the MutLα complex is locked on the DNA by the inactive helicase. It follows that a complete failure to re-enter the cell cycle, as apposed to a slower entry, would be more toxic to cells. Consistent with this, we found that the FA-J K52R expressing cells are shortlived in tissue culture and forced expression of K52R FANCJ in other cell lines is not stable (data not shown).

Given that the FANCJ/MutLα interaction is intact in other FA cells, including FA-A, FA-D2 and FA-D1 ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), loss of this complex is not a general feature of FA cells. However, it remains to be determined whether additional FA–MMR interactions are altered. Moreover, similar to FANCJ deficiency, MLH1 deficiency does not affect the ATR-mediated FANCD2 monoubiquitination ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) ( Andreassen et al , 2004 ; Levitus et al , 2004 ; Bridge et al , 2005 ; Litman et al , 2005 ), suggesting that the FANCJ/MLH1 interaction is not essential for FA-pathway activation. Interestingly, we find that deletions in the MLH1 C-terminus (703–725), which are important for maintaining the stability of PMS2 ( Mohd et al , 2006 ), also disrupted the FANCJ/MLH1 interaction. This finding has implications for MLH1 clinical mutations identified in colon cancer patients, potentially linking MLH1 function not only to PMS2 but also to FANCJ.

In conclusion, these studies have provided the first evidence for a role of the FANCJ/MutLα complex in the ICL-induced response. This work extends the already implicated role of MMR proteins in the ICL response. Further study of the role of FANCJ, BRCA1 and MMR proteins in this process should advance the understanding of how ICL-induced responses are regulated to preserve genomic integrity.
