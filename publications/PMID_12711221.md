Histone acetylation and deacetylation play essential roles in modifying 
chromatin structure and regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. Histone 
deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the deacetylation of lysine residues in the 
histone N-terminal tails and are found in large multiprotein complexes with 
transcriptional co-repressors. Human HDACs are grouped into three classes based 
on their similarity to known yeast factors: class I HDACs are similar to the 
yeast transcriptional repressor yRPD3, class II HDACs to yHDA1 and class III 
HDACs to ySIR2. In this review, we focus on the biology of class II HDACs. These 
newly discovered enzymes have been implicated as global regulators of gene 
expression during cell differentiation and development. We discuss their 
emerging biological functions and the molecular mechanisms by which they are 
regulated.
