Cystine knots consist of three intertwined disulfide bridges and are considered 
major determinants of protein stability in proteins in which they occur. We 
questioned this function and observed that removal of individual disulfide 
bridges in human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) does not reduce its 
thermodynamic stability but reduces its unexpected high thermal stability of 108 
degrees C by up to 40 degrees C. In wild-type VEGF (deltaG(u,25)(0) = 5.1 
kcal.mol(-1)), the knot is responsible for a large entropic stabilization of 
TdeltaS(u,25)(0) = -39.3 kcal mol(-1), which is compensated for by a 
deltaH(u,25)(0) of -34.2 kcal mol(-1). In the disulfide-deficient mutants, this 
entropic stabilization disappears, but instead of a decrease, we observe an 
increase in the thermodynamic stability by about 2 kcal.mol(-1). A detailed 
crystallographic analysis of the mutant structures suggests a role of the 
cystine knot motif in protein folding rather than in the stabilization of the 
folded state. When assuming that the sequential order of the disulfide bridge 
formation is conserved between VEGF and glycoprotein alpha-subunit, the crystal 
structure of the mutant C61A-C104A, which deviates by a root mean square 
deviation of more than 2.2 A from wild-type VEGF, identifies a true folding 
intermediate of VEGF.
