Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is an antioxidant enzyme essential for 
the survival of life. We have reported that NF-kappaB is essential but not 
sufficient for the synergistic induction of MnSOD by phorbol 12-myristate 
13-acetate and cytokines. To further identify transcription factors and 
co-activators that participate in the induction of MnSOD, we used NF-kappaB 
affinity chromatography to isolate potential NF-kappaB interacting proteins. 
Proteins eluted from the NF-kappaB affinity column were subjected to proteomic 
analysis and verified by Western analysis. Nucleophosmin (NPM), a nucleolar 
phosphoprotein, is the most abundant single protein identified. 
Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest a physical interaction between NPM and 
NF-kappaB proteins. To verify the role of NPM on MnSOD gene transcription, cells 
were transfected with constructs expressing NPM in sense or antisense 
orientation as well as interference RNA. The results indicate that an increase 
NPM expression leads to increased MnSOD gene transcription in a dose-dependent 
manner. Consistent with this, expression of small interfering RNA for NPM leads 
to inhibition of MnSOD gene transcription but does not have any effect on the 
expression of interleukin-8, suggesting that the effect of NPM is selective. 
These results identify NPM as a partner of the NF-kappaB transcription complex 
in the induction of MnSOD by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and cytokines.
