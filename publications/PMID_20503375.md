We report the expression of the mouse Mpped1 in the telencephalon through 
embryonic stages to adulthood. Using Northern blotting analysis and RNA in situ 
hybridization (ISH), our data show that Mpped1 is specifically expressed in the 
brain and is enriched in the cortical plate of the developing telencephalon. 
Postnatally, the expression of Mpped1 is reduced in the cerebral cortex relative 
to its levels in the embryonic dorsal telencephalon. Also, Mpped1 expression is 
sustained in the hippocampal CA1 region. Examination of the expression of Mpped1 
and other cortical layer markers by ISH in a malformed beta-catenin null dorsal 
telencephalon show that the Mpped1-, Cux2-, and Rorbeta-expressing superficial 
cortical layers are reduced and form patchy patterns, and the Tbr-1-expressing 
deep-layer neurons are incorrectly located on superficial layers, indicative of 
a migration defect of cortical neurons in the absence of beta-catenin.
