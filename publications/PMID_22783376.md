After DNA damage, p53 is accumulated in the nucleus and transactivates 
downstream genes and induces apoptosis. There are two pathways in p53-dependent 
apoptosis, the transactivation-dependent and -independent pathway. In this 
study, we constructed p53-inducible glioblastoma cell lines and analyzed them 
for the induction of apoptosis and transactivation of p53-downstream genes after 
the nuclear or cytoplasmic expression of p53. To sequester p53 in the cytoplasm, 
we used p53 mutant with arginine to glycine substitution at residue 306 (R306G). 
Wild-type p53 retained the ability to arrest the cell cycle, and a p53 mutant 
with serine to phenylalanine substitution at residue 121 (S121F), which has a 
strong ability to induce apoptosis, retained this ability even when both the 
wild-type and p53 and S121F mutant were exclusively sequestered from the nucleus 
into the cytoplasm. Notably, cytoplasmically sequestered wild-type p53 and S121F 
mutant transactivated the downstream genes with distinct expression profiles, 
and the strong apoptotic ability of S121F was not associated with its 
transactivation activity. These results underscore the existence of 
transactivation-independent apoptosis and cytoplasmic function of p53.

Abstract

After DNA damage, p53 is accumulated in the nucleus and transactivates downstream genes and induces apoptosis. There are two pathways in p53-dependent apoptosis, the transactivation-dependent and -independent pathway. In this study, we constructed p53-inducible glioblastoma cell lines and analyzed them for the induction of apoptosis and transactivation of p53-downstream genes after the nuclear or cytoplasmic expression of p53. To sequester p53 in the cytoplasm, we used p53 mutant with arginine to glycine substitution at residue 306 (R306G). Wild-type p53 retained the ability to arrest the cell cycle, and a p53 mutant with serine to phenylalanine substitution at residue 121 (S121F), which has a strong ability to induce apoptosis, retained this ability even when both the wild-type and p53 and S121F mutant were exclusively sequestered from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Notably, cytoplasmically sequestered wild-type p53 and S121F mutant transactivated the downstream genes with distinct expression profiles, and the strong apoptotic ability of S121F was not associated with its transactivation activity. These results underscore the existence of transactivation-independent apoptosis and cytoplasmic function of p53.

Introduction

TP53 tumor suppressor gene is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human neoplasia, and approximately 80% of these mutations are missense mutations ( 1 , 2 ). The gene product, p53 protein, is a nuclear transcriptional activator that is activated by post-translational modification, including phosphorylation and acetylation, in response to DNA-damaging stresses. Activated p53 is stabilized, accumulates in the nucleus and binds to p53-responsive elements (p53REs) in the promoter region of p53-downstream genes ( 3 ). Transactivation of these genes, including p21WAF1 , MDM2 , p53AIP1 , BAX , NOXA and PUMA , results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Most p53 mutants with a single amino acid substitution found in human neoplasm lose the ability to bind to p53REs, and this functional defect is thought to be one of the most important oncogenic events caused by TP53 mutation ( 4 ). Therefore, the translocation of p53 into the nucleus is crucial for normal p53 function. Cytoplasmic sequestration of wild-type p53 was observed in undifferentiated neuroblastoma, breast cancer, retinoblastoma, colorectal carcinoma and glioblastoma cells ( 5 – 7 ). In all these cells, wild-type p53 is inactivated since it is retained in the cytoplasm. Although the precise mechanism underlying the cytoplasmic sequestration remains unclear, several molecular mechanisms have been proposed: i) a mutation in the bipartite sequence of p53 (residues 305 and 306) ( 8 ) or a truncated mutation of the nuclear localization motif receptor protein importin-α ( 9 ); ii) hyperactive nuclear export by an MDM2-dependent pathway ( 10 ); and iii) overexpression of cytoplasmic tethering proteins, such as mortalin ( 11 ), cullin 7 ( 12 ) and PARC ( 13 ). The mutations in the bipartite sequence have been analyzed comprehensively, and these mutants were shown to lose transactivation activity in a yeast functional assay ( 14 ).

In contrast to tumor-derived loss-of-function p53 mutants, other types of p53 mutants (super p53s) have a stronger ability to induce apoptosis than wild-type p53. Among these, a p53 mutant with a serine to phenylalanine substitution at residue 121 (S121F) has a distinct affinity to bind p53REs from wild-type p53 ( 15 ). S121F induces a more potent apoptosis than wild-type p53 in mammalian cell lines. The transcriptional activity of S121F for downstream genes, however, is less efficient than that of wild-type p53 ( 16 ). In addition, different expression profiles among super p53s have been reported ( 17 ). These results suggest that transactivation-independent cytoplasmic activity occurs in p53-dependent apoptosis and that S121F may be a diverged mutant with enhanced cytoplasmic activity.

To test this hypothesis, we expressed wild-type and S121F p53 in the nucleus or cytoplasm of p53-null SF126 glioblastoma cells using a p53 mutant with an arginine to glycine substitution at residue 306 (R306G), and analyzed them for induction of apoptosis and transactivation of p53-downstream genes following the p53 induction.

Discussion

The cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 did not completely inactivate p53 function, suggesting the cytoplasmic function of p53. This finding may be the reason that mutations on the bipartite sequence in human tumors are extremely rare. In this context, Goldman et al showed that in a neuroblastoma cell line expressing cytoplasmically sequestered wild-type p53, p53 target genes ( p21WAF1 and MDM2 ) were up-regulated following cell irradiation ( 18 ). These results also suggest that wild-type p53 retains some functional activity when it is sequestered in the cytoplasm, although p53 homologues, such as p63 and p73, may have been involved in the result. By contrast, our experimental system was a p53-specific inducible system; therefore, involvement of p53 homologue activation is unlikely.

Our previous knowledge of p53-dependent apoptosis was that after genotoxic stress, activated p53 transactivated its downstream genes in a sequence-specific manner in the cell nucleus and induced apoptosis in cells through the direct or indirect induction of the downstream protein(s); however, a transactivation-independent mechanism for p53-dependent apoptosis has been reported by several laboratories ( 19 , 20 ). In addition, we previously indicated a lack of correlation between p53-dependent transactivation activity and the ability to induce apoptosis, and speculated that a transactivation-independent mechanism may exist ( 17 ). We excluded the nuclear function of p53, including the sequence-specific transactivation function, by introducing R306G, a mutation in the bipartite sequence at residues 305 and 306. A conditional expression system of cytoplasmically sequestered p53 was constructed and we found that cytoplasmically sequestered p53 retains its ability to arrest cell proliferation (wild-type p53) and induce apoptosis (S121F). These results strongly support a cytoplasmic apoptotic function of p53. Notably, however, cytoplasmically sequestered p53 transactivated downstream genes. Therefore, we did not clarify whether cytoplasmic p53-dependent apoptosis depends on either a direct or an indirect transactivation mechanism or is independent of transactivation.

Additional experiments are required to evaluate which mechanism is crucial for p53-dependent apoptosis and to clarify the mechanism underlying super p53 (S121F)-dependent apoptosis.
