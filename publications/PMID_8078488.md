We have cloned and characterized a second form of the human calcitonin receptor 
from T47D cells. It resembles the clone described by Gorn et al. [J. Clin. 
Invest. 90:1726-1735 (1992)] except that it lacks a 16-amino acid insert in the 
putative first intracellular loop. The insert-negative receptor appears to be 
the most abundant form, and it occurs at a relatively constant level in all 
expressing tissues. In contrast, the insert-positive receptor is found at low 
levels in most tissues but its expression levels appear to be much more 
variable. The insert-negative cDNA was stably expressed in baby hamster kidney 
cells. Like the endogenous T47D receptor, the recombinant receptor has an 
equally high affinity for salmon and porcine calcitonin but a 3-4-fold lower 
affinity for human calcitonin. High concentrations of calcitonin gene-related 
peptide, rat amylin, secretin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide do not 
significantly compete with calcitonin for binding to the recombinant receptor. 
Calcitonin stimulates a cAMP response in both T47D and transfected baby hamster 
kidney cells. Salmon calcitonin is more potent than human calcitonin for T47D 
cells, but the two are nearly equipotent for the transfectants. Furthermore, the 
ED50 for the cAMP response in the transfectants is 10-100-fold lower than in 
T47D cells. Calcitonin stimulates inositol phosphate turnover and elevates 
internal calcium levels in the transfectants. This response requires 
non-physiological levels of calcitonin and is directly correlated with the 
number of receptors. Lastly, by using a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel 
and in situ hybridization, we localized the human calcitonin receptor gene to 
chromosome 7.
