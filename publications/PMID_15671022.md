Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting an estimated 
4 million people worldwide. Intracellular proteinaceous inclusions called Lewy 
bodies are the histological hallmarks of PD and are primarily composed of 
aggregated alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn). Although the detailed mechanisms remain 
unclear, mounting evidence suggests that the misfolding of alphaSyn into 
prefibrillar and fibrillar species is the driving force responsible for cellular 
toxicity. We show here that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 
strongly inhibits alphaSyn fibril formation via preferential binding to 
prefibrillar species. Moreover, our studies reveal that Hsp70 alters the 
characteristics of toxic alphaSyn aggregates and indicate that cellular toxicity 
arises from the prefibrillar forms of alphaSyn. This work therefore elucidates a 
specific role of Hsp70 in the pathogenesis of PD and supports the general 
concept that chaperone action is a crucial aspect in protecting against the 
otherwise damaging consequences of protein misfolding.
