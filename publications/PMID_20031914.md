The circadian clock regulates the expression of an array of Arabidopsis genes 
such as those encoding the LIGHT-HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL A/B (Lhcb) proteins. We 
have previously studied the promoters of two of these Arabidopsis genes--Lhcb1*1 
and Lhcb1*3--and identified a sequence that binds the clock protein CIRCADIAN 
CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1). This sequence, designated CCA1-binding site (CBS), is 
necessary for phytochrome and circadian responsiveness of these genes. In close 
proximity to this sequence, there exists a G-box core element that has been 
shown to bind the bZIP transcription factor HY5 in other light-regulated plant 
promoters. In the present study, we examined the importance of the interaction 
of transcription factors binding the CBS and the G-box core element in the 
control of normal circadian rhythmic expression of Lhcb genes. Our results show 
that HY5 is able to specifically bind the G-box element in the Lhcb promoters 
and that CCA1 can alter the binding activity of HY5. We further show that CCA1 
and HY5 can physically interact and that they can act synergistically on 
transcription in a yeast reporter gene assay. An absence of HY5 leads to a 
shorter period of Lhcb1*1 circadian expression but does not affect the circadian 
expression of CATALASE3 (CAT3), whose promoter lacks a G-box element. Our 
results suggest that interaction of the HY5 and CCA1 proteins on Lhcb promoters 
is necessary for normal circadian expression of the Lhcb genes.
