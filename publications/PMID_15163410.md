Although a great deal is known biochemically about peroxiredoxins (Prxs), little 
is known about their real physiological function. We show here that two 
cytosolic yeast Prxs, cPrxI and II, which display diversity in structure and 
apparent molecular weights (MW), can act alternatively as peroxidases and 
molecular chaperones. The peroxidase function predominates in the lower MW 
forms, whereas the chaperone function predominates in the higher MW complexes. 
Oxidative stress and heat shock exposure of yeasts causes the protein structures 
of cPrxI and II to shift from low MW species to high MW complexes. This triggers 
a peroxidase-to-chaperone functional switch. These in vivo changes are primarily 
guided by the active peroxidase site residue, Cys(47), which serves as an 
efficient "H(2)O(2)-sensor" in the cells. The chaperone function of these 
proteins enhances yeast resistance to heat shock.
