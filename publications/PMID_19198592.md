After being infected by the fungus Drechmeria coniospora, Caenorhabditis elegans 
produces antimicrobial peptides in its epidermis, some regulated by a signaling 
cascade involving a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Here we show that 
infection-induced expression of peptides of the Caenacin family occurred 
independently of the p38 pathway. The caenacin (cnc) genes enhanced survival 
after fungal infection, and neuronal expression of the transforming growth 
factor-beta homolog DBL-1 promoted cnc-2 expression in the epidermis in a 
dose-dependent paracrine way. Our results lead to a model in which antifungal 
defenses are coordinately regulated by a cell-autonomous p38 cascade and a 
distinct cytokine-like transforming growth factor-beta signal from the nervous 
system, each of which controls distinct sets of antimicrobial peptide-encoding 
genes in the epidermis.
