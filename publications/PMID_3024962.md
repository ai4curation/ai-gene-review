## Abstract

1. EMBO J. 1986 Nov;5(11):2825-30. doi: 10.1002/j.1460-2075.1986.tb04575.x.

Mapping the collagen-binding site of human fibronectin by expression in 
Escherichia coli.

Owens RJ, Baralle FE.

The collagen-binding domain of human fibronectin has been expressed as a 
cro/beta-galactosidase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The hybrid 
polypeptide was recognized by an anti-(human plasma fibronectin) serum and bound 
specifically to gelatin-Sepharose. The collagen-binding region was subdivided by 
constructing a series of overlapping bacterial expression plasmids. The fusion 
proteins produced by these constructs were analysed for gelatin-binding 
activity. The results indicate that the binding site lies within an 
approximately 12.5 kd fragment of fibronectin, and show that the following 14 
amino acid sequence is critical for gelatin-binding activity: 
Ala-Ala-His-Glu-Glu-Ile-Cys-Thr-Thr-Asn-Glu-Gly-Val-Met. This sequence links the 
second type II homology unit with the adjacent type I repeat in the 
amino-terminal third of the fibronectin molecule.
