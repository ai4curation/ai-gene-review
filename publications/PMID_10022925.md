A mutation in NMD3 was found to be lethal in the absence of XRN1, which encodes 
the major cytoplasmic exoribonuclease responsible for mRNA turnover. Molecular 
genetic analysis of NMD3 revealed that it is an essential gene required for 
stable 60S ribosomal subunits. Cells bearing a temperature-sensitive allele of 
NMD3 had decreased levels of 60S subunits at the nonpermissive temperature which 
resulted in the formation of half-mer polysomes. Pulse-chase analysis of rRNA 
biogenesis indicated that 25S rRNA was made and processed with kinetics similar 
to wild-type kinetics. However, the mature RNA was rapidly degraded, with a 
half-life of 4 min. Nmd3p fractionated as a cytoplasmic protein and sedimented 
in the position of free 60S subunits in sucrose gradients. These results suggest 
that Nmd3p is a cytoplasmic factor required for a late cytoplasmic assembly step 
of the 60S subunit but is not a ribosomal protein. Putative orthologs of Nmd3p 
exist in Drosophila, in nematodes, and in archaebacteria but not in eubacteria. 
The Nmd3 protein sequence does not contain readily recognizable motifs of known 
function. However, these proteins all have an amino-terminal domain containing 
four repeats of Cx2C, reminiscent of zinc-binding proteins, implicated in 
nucleic acid binding or protein oligomerization.
