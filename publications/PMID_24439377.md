Axonal branching and synapse formation are tightly linked developmental events 
during the establishment of synaptic circuits. Newly formed synapses promote 
branch initiation and stability. However, little is known about molecular 
mechanisms that link these two processes. Here, we show that local assembly of 
an F-actin cytoskeleton at nascent presynaptic sites initiates both synapse 
formation and axon branching. We further find that assembly of the F-actin 
network requires a direct interaction between the synaptic cell adhesion 
molecule SYG-1 and a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton, the WVE-1/WAVE 
regulatory complex (WRC). SYG-1 cytoplasmic tail binds to the WRC using a 
consensus WRC interacting receptor sequence (WIRS). WRC mutants or mutating the 
SYG-1 WIRS motif leads to loss of local F-actin, synaptic material, and axonal 
branches. Together, these data suggest that synaptic adhesion molecules, which 
serve as a necessary component for both synaptogenesis and axonal branch 
formation, directly regulate subcellular actin cytoskeletal organization.
