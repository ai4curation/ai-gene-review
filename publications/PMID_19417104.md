Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that detects and 
degrades mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons (PTCs). SMG-1 
and Upf1 transiently form a surveillance complex termed "SURF" that includes 
eRF1 and eRF3 on post-spliced mRNAs during recognition of PTC. If an exon 
junction complex (EJC) exists downstream from the SURF complex, SMG-1 
phosphorylates Upf1, the step that is a rate-limiting for NMD. We provide 
evidence of an association between the SURF complex and the ribosome in 
association with mRNPs, and we suggest that the SURF complex functions as a 
translation termination complex during NMD. We identified SMG-8 and SMG-9 as 
novel subunits of the SMG-1 complex. SMG-8 and SMG-9 suppress SMG-1 kinase 
activity in the isolated SMG-1 complex and are involved in NMD in both mammals 
and nematodes. SMG-8 recruits SMG-1 to the mRNA surveillance complex, and 
inactivation of SMG-8 induces accumulation of a ribosome:Upf1:eRF1:eRF3:EJC 
complex on mRNP, which physically bridges the ribosome and EJC through eRF1, 
eRF3, and Upf1. These results not only reveal the regulatory mechanism of SMG-1 
kinase but also reveal the sequential remodeling of the ribosome:SURF complex to 
the predicted DECID (DECay InDucing) complex, a ribosome:SURF:EJC complex, as a 
mechanism of in vivo PTC discrimination.
