The feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR) is a heme export protein 
that is required for proerythroblast survival and facilitates macrophage heme 
iron recycling. However, its mechanism of heme export and substrate specificity 
are uncharacterized. Using [(55)Fe]heme and the fluorescent heme analog zinc 
mesoporphyrin, we investigated whether export by FLVCR depends on the 
availability and avidity of extracellular heme-binding proteins. Export was 
100-fold more efficient when the medium contained hemopexin (K(d) < 1 pm) 
compared with albumin (K(d) = 5 nm) at the same concentration and was not 
detectable when the medium lacked heme-binding proteins. Besides heme, FLVCR 
could export other cyclic planar porphyrins, such as protoporphyrin IX and 
coproporphyrin. However, FLVCR has a narrow substrate range because unconjugated 
bilirubin, the primary breakdown product of heme, was not transported. As 
neither protoporphyrin IX nor coproporphyrin export improved with extracellular 
hemopexin (versus albumin), our observations further suggest that hemopexin, an 
abundant protein with a serum concentration (6.7-25 mum) equivalent to that of 
the iron transport protein transferrin (22-31 mum), by accepting heme from FLVCR 
and targeting it to the liver, might regulate macrophage heme export and heme 
iron recycling in vivo. Final studies show that hemopexin directly interacts 
with FLVCR, which also helps explain why FLVCR, in contrast to some major 
facilitator superfamily members, does not function as a bidirectional 
gradient-dependent transporter. Together, these data argue that hemopexin has a 
role in assuring systemic iron balance during homeostasis in addition to its 
established role as a scavenger during internal bleeding or hemolysis.

Abstract

The feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR) is a heme export protein that is required for proerythroblast survival and facilitates macrophage heme iron recycling. However, its mechanism of heme export and substrate specificity are uncharacterized. Using [ 55 Fe]heme and the fluorescent heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin, we investigated whether export by FLVCR depends on the availability and avidity of extracellular heme-binding proteins. Export was 100-fold more efficient when the medium contained hemopexin ( K d < 1 p m ) compared with albumin ( K d = 5 n m ) at the same concentration and was not detectable when the medium lacked heme-binding proteins. Besides heme, FLVCR could export other cyclic planar porphyrins, such as protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin. However, FLVCR has a narrow substrate range because unconjugated bilirubin, the primary breakdown product of heme, was not transported. As neither protoporphyrin IX nor coproporphyrin export improved with extracellular hemopexin ( versus albumin), our observations further suggest that hemopexin, an abundant protein with a serum concentration (6.7–25 μ m ) equivalent to that of the iron transport protein transferrin (22–31 μ m ), by accepting heme from FLVCR and targeting it to the liver, might regulate macrophage heme export and heme iron recycling in vivo . Final studies show that hemopexin directly interacts with FLVCR, which also helps explain why FLVCR, in contrast to some major facilitator superfamily members, does not function as a bidirectional gradient-dependent transporter. Together, these data argue that hemopexin has a role in assuring systemic iron balance during homeostasis in addition to its established role as a scavenger during internal bleeding or hemolysis.

Introduction

The biological roles of heme are diverse and encompass most areas of cell metabolism and gene regulation. Heme serves as a prosthetic group in the hemeproteins, which are involved in crucial biological functions, including oxygen binding (hemoglobin and myoglobin), oxygen metabolism (oxidases, peroxidases, catalases, and hydroxylases), electron transfer (cytochromes) ( 4 ), and signal transduction (nitric-oxide synthases) ( 5 ). In addition, heme serves as a signaling molecule in erythropoiesis and other physiological systems. Because heme generally signals by binding and inactivating a transcriptional repressor ( e.g. Bach1) or translational inhibitor ( e.g. heme-regulated inhibitor and thus eIFα2 kinase), its impact is immediate ( 6 – 8 ). Perhaps for this reason, heme is utilized in time-sensitive processes, such as the regulation of circadian rhythm ( 9 ), N-end rule pathway/protein ubiquitination ( 10 ), and globin synthesis. Heme is also required for microRNA processing ( 11 ). However, excess free or non-protein-bound heme damages lipid, protein, and DNA through the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in cellular injury and death ( 12 ). Therefore, free cellular heme levels must be tightly regulated to provide an adequate supply yet avoid heme toxicities ( 4 , 13 – 15 ).

Most studies of heme homeostasis focus on its biosynthesis and degradation. The rate of heme biosynthesis varies significantly among various cells and tissues and is especially high in hepatocytes and erythroid cells, where large amounts of heme are required for cytochrome P450 and hemoglobin, respectively ( 4 ). The addition of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 3 bypasses the initial rate-limiting step in the heme synthesis pathway and allows the synthesis of intermediates up to and including protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). If sufficient iron is available, ferrochelatase inserts the iron into PPIX, completing heme synthesis. Heme is degraded by heme oxygenases to biliverdin, which is then converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase ( 16 ). Excess heme further induces heme oxygenase-1 levels by increasing the transcription of heme oxygenase-1.

Recently, we demonstrated ( 1 ) that intracellular heme can also be exported by a cell-surface membrane protein termed FLVCR, initially identified as the feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor ( 17 , 18 ). Inhibition of FLVCR function in the human erythroid cell line K562 decreases heme export, impairs erythroid maturation, and leads to apoptosis ( 1 ). FLVCR-null mice lack definitive erythropoiesis, and mice with FLVCR that is deleted neonatally develop severe macrocytic anemia with proerythroblast maturation arrest ( 2 ), arguing that erythroid precursors export excess heme to ensure survival. Interestingly, FLVCR-deleted mice develop iron overload in macrophages, liver, and duodenum. These data suggest that the iron homeostatic cycle includes heme export at these sites. This hypothesis is supported by direct observations that FLVCR-deficient macrophages accumulate more ferritin than wild-type macrophages when ingesting opsonized red cells ( 2 ).

The goal of this study was to determine how FLVCR-mediated heme export occurs and whether FLVCR has limited substrate specificity or can also transport structurally and metabolically related compounds. We demonstrate that the substrate specificity of FLVCR export involves heme and proximal planar porphyrins, but not bilirubin; that the export of heme is preferentially facilitated by hemopexin; and that hemopexin binds to FLVCR at a site thought to be important for heme export. A physiological role for hemopexin in heme iron recycling may explain the very high serum concentrations of hemopexin, 0.55–1.25 mg/ml (9.2–20.8 μ m ) in mice ( 19 ) and 0.4–1.5 mg/ml (6.7–25 μ m ) in humans ( 20 ).

DISCUSSION

Here, we have demonstrated that the export of heme via FLVCR is tightly regulated by the presence and avidity of the extracellular heme-binding proteins hemopexin and albumin. Export via FLVCR is most efficient in the presence of 1.515 μ m hemopexin. A comparable efficiency of export requires a 100-fold higher concentration of BSA, which reflects the much higher affinity of hemopexin for heme ( K d < 1 p m ) compared with albumin ( K d = 5 n m ) ( 40 , 41 ). Because hemopexin is present at a concentration in human serum (6.7–25 μ m ) similar to transferrin (22–31 μ m ), the protein responsible for elemental iron transport ( 42 ), we suspect that it functions physiologically to facilitate the recycling and trafficking of heme iron, in addition to its role as a scavenger protein.

We would anticipate that albumin, the most abundant serum protein (522–776 μ m , 21–122-fold more prevalent than hemopexin), could substitute for hemopexin under steady-state conditions, despite its much lower affinity for heme. This would explain the mild base-line phenotype of hemopexin-null mice. Although there is no obvious tissue lesion caused by oxidative damage or abnormal iron deposition in hemopexin-null mice, these animals have severe renal damage and defective recovery after acute hemolysis ( 43 ) and increased iron deposition and oxidative stress markers in brain ( 44 ).

There are two physiological reasons that cells might export heme via FLVCR: 1) to avoid cellular toxicity when heme synthesis exceeds use (as hemoproteins) and metabolism (via heme oxygenase-1) and 2) to facilitate systemic iron homeostasis. Although these roles have been best characterized in erythroid marrow ( 2 ) and macrophages (Ref. 2 and this report), respectively, it appears that FLVCR has importance for other tissues where it is highly expressed, such as liver, duodenum, kidney, placenta, and brain ( 2 ). Because FLVCR-deleted mice develop iron overload in liver and duodenum, as well as tissue macrophages, by 12 weeks ( 2 ) and accumulate iron in renal tubular cells by 9 months, 5 heme trafficking via FLVCR at these sites likely contributes to iron homeostasis ( 3 ). Heme export via FLVCR may also provide protection from heme or ferrous iron toxicities in liver and brain, as our observations support emerging hypotheses concerning hepatic ( 45 ) and neuronal ( 46 , 47 ) injury.

Hemopexin is a plasma glycoprotein produced primarily by liver parenchymal cells ( 48 ). However, it is also expressed in human neurons ( 49 ) and several types of mouse brain cells ( 26 , 44 , 48 ), implying that this protein is synthesized locally in brain. Interestingly, hemopexin protects the brain of adult mice against ischemic stroke-related damage in murine models ( 26 ). In addition to hemopexin, FLVCR is also present in developing mouse neural tissues and human brain tissues and cell lines ( 1 , 2 ), thus providing a mechanism to remove excess heme iron from this protected site and prevent damaging iron deposits.

Heme-mediated cellular toxicity can also be caused by oxidized products of heme and heme precursors such as porphyrins ( 50 ). The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 is widely expressed in a variety of drug-resistant cancer cells and in numerous normal tissues and stem cells ( 51 ) and is a promiscuous transporter of many substrates, including drugs. ABCG2 was also identified as the major exporter for porphyrins, as PPIX accumulates in tissues of ABCG2-deleted mice ( 35 ). It was shown that ABCG2 also specifically interacts with heme, as it was isolated by binding hemin-agarose in a dose-dependent manner ( 52 ). Although heme appears to be the prime substrate for FLVCR ( Fig. 3 ), our study reveals that FLVCR can export endogenously synthesized PPIX and coproporphyrin, induced by treatment with ALA alone or with iron. The fact that PPIX was present in the supernatant of NRK/Neo cells, although at a lower level than in NRK/FLVCR cells, indicates that another porphyrin exporter, probably ABCG2, is functioning in NRK cells to maintain homeostasis of intracellular porphyrins.

Our data show that UCB, the critical end product of heme catabolism, is not exported by FLVCR, despite its dicarboxylic tetrapyrrole structure. Unlike PPIX, coproporphyrin, and heme, which have been shown here to be substrates for FLVCR, the actual structure of UCB resembles a ridge tile or folded book, with extensive internal hydrogen bonding between each -COOH side chain and the lactam group of the opposite dipyrrinone half of the molecule ( 38 ). Apparently, the uniplanar configuration of heme and the porphyrins and/or the freedom of their carboxyl groups is an essential feature for transport of a tetrapyrrole by FLVCR, but this requires further study.

FLVCR has not yet been crystallized. However, the three-dimensional structures of three related major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters (oxalate transporter, lactose permease (LacY), and glycerol 3-phosphate transporter) have been established ( 53 – 55 ) and are remarkably similar ( 56 ), despite divergent transport function and only 21% sequence similarity. Also, modeling other distantly related MFS members ( e.g. TetAB and vesicular monoamine transporter) on this MFS structure predicts tertiary configurations consistent with their known biochemical and structural properties ( 56 ). When we model FLVCR on this structure, regions ECL1 and ECL6 of the FLVC-binding site ( 57 ) are adjacent to each other, despite being separated by ∼330 amino acids in the sequence (data not shown), implying that the model can provide functional information about FLVCR.

To transport substrates, MFS transporters generally use an open-in then open-out mechanism termed a rocker-switch mechanism ( 55 ). Based on the functional data for LacY, which are most complete ( 58 – 60 ), the cytoplasmic substrate enters the transporter channel, and the channel then closes to the inside and opens to the outside, permitting the passage of substrate and thus export. Conceptually, a heme-binding protein like hemopexin or albumin might rapidly remove heme from the channel at the cell surface, allowing FLVCR to change conformation, reopen in, and accept a second heme molecule for export. Thus, the concentration and type of heme-binding protein that is present outside the cell regulate the export efficiency.

Across all mammalian species, there are two invariant histidine residues in FLVCR at positions 145 and 198, located adjacent to the outside opening of the exporting channel. These two histidine residues are not conserved in related paralogs that do not transport heme. It is possible that these two histidine residues each form a salt bridge with the -COO- groups of heme, which, in coordination with other functional domains either within FLVCR itself or on an adjacent membrane protein, serve as a transient binding site for heme, facilitating its transfer to hemopexin. When occupied, FLVCR may be maintained in an open-out configuration. Our data showing that heme (see “Experimental Procedures”) and hemopexin bind to a FLVCR peptide (amino acids 132–301) that contains these residues, as well as the results of our competitive binding and ZnMP export studies, support this concept and the rocker-switch mechanism of export. Of note, the internal H-bonding of the -COOH groups of UCB may render them unavailable to form salt bridges with the histidines in FLVCR and may contribute to the inability of FLVCR to transport bilirubin.

As an additional approach to link FLVCR structure with its heme export function, we surveyed the structures of prokaryotic heme transporters. Recently, it was reported that CcsBA, an integral membrane protein of Helicobacter hepaticus , is involved in heme transport for cytochrome c biogenesis ( 61 ). CcsBA has a highly conserved tryptophan-rich WWD domain that orients the heme to be translocated in concert with histidine residues. Although FLVCR does not have a WWD domain, it does have amino acid sequence WLLD in intracellular loop 1 surrounding the transport channel ( 17 , 18 ). We propose that this similar sequence, or other unidentified functional domains in FLVCR, can serve as a docking site or orient heme entering the transport channel. These structural findings and the presence of hemopexin outside (but not inside) of cells may explain why FLVCR exports (but does not import) heme ( 1 ), whereas many MFS family members mediate bidirectional concentration-dependent transport and support its physiological role.

This study and our previous observations suggest that heme export by FLVCR is a mechanism for heme iron trafficking to prevent cellular heme and iron toxicity and to maintain heme and iron homeostasis. Hemopexin as an available and effective heme-binding protein facilitates this function by targeting heme to liver ( 3 ). It seems possible that hemopexin or other heme-binding molecules might facilitate removal of excess heme iron from tissues, ameliorate the anemia of chronic inflammation (which results from impaired export of elemental iron via ferroportin ( 62 , 63 )) or the systemic iron overload of hemochromatosis or other disorders, and provide a therapeutic benefit.
