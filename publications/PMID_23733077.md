BBX24 and BBX25 are two important transcriptional regulators, which regulate 
seedling photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. Very recently, we have shown that 
BBX24 and BBX25 negatively regulate the expression of BBX22, reducing the 
function of HY5, by physically interacting with its bZIP domain. (1) 
Furthermore, HY5 HOMOLOG, HYH, has been reported to heterodimerize with HY5 and 
enhances its photomorphogenic function in seedling de-etiolation by serving as 
coactivator. (8) Here, we further report that BBX24 and BBX25 physically 
interact with HYH. The physical interactions of BBX24 and BBX25 with HYH could 
lead to depletion of HYH molecules from the active pool and, thus indirectly, 
reduce the function of HY5 in promoting photomorphogenesis. Hence, our results 
suggest another mode of regulation by which BBX24 and BBX25 exert their negative 
effects on HY5 indirectly through HYH for the fine-tuning of seedling 
photomorphogenesis.

Abstract

BBX24 and BBX25 are two important transcriptional regulators, which regulate seedling photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis . Very recently, we have shown that BBX24 and BBX25 negatively regulate the expression of BBX22, reducing the function of HY5, by physically interacting with its bZIP domain. 1 Furthermore, HY5 HOMOLOG, HYH, has been reported to heterodimerize with HY5 and enhances its photomorphogenic function in seedling de-etiolation by serving as coactivator. 8 Here, we further report that BBX24 and BBX25 physically interact with HYH. The physical interactions of BBX24 and BBX25 with HYH could lead to depletion of HYH molecules from the active pool and, thus indirectly, reduce the function of HY5 in promoting photomorphogenesis. Hence, our results suggest another mode of regulation by which BBX24 and BBX25 exert their negative effects on HY5 indirectly through HYH for the fine-tuning of seedling photomorphogenesis.
