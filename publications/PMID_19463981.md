Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is the most prevalent and least understood 
disorder of the oxidative phosphorylation system. The genetic cause of many 
cases of isolated complex I deficiency is unknown because of insufficient 
understanding of the complex I assembly process and the factors involved. We 
performed homozygosity mapping and gene sequencing to identify the genetic 
defect in five complex I-deficient patients from three different families. All 
patients harbored mutations in the NDUFAF3 (C3ORF60) gene, of which the 
pathogenic nature was assessed by NDUFAF3-GFP baculovirus complementation in 
fibroblasts. We found that NDUFAF3 is a genuine mitochondrial complex I assembly 
protein that interacts with complex I subunits. Furthermore, we show that 
NDUFAF3 tightly interacts with NDUFAF4 (C6ORF66), a protein previously 
implicated in complex I deficiency. Additional gene conservation analysis links 
NDUFAF3 to bacterial-membrane-insertion gene cluster SecF/SecD/YajC and to 
C8ORF38, also implicated in complex I deficiency. These data not only show that 
NDUFAF3 mutations cause complex I deficiency but also relate different complex I 
disease genes by the close cooperation of their encoded proteins during the 
assembly process.
