HLA-F is currently the most enigmatic of the human MHC-encoded class Ib genes. 
We have investigated the expression of HLA-F using a specific Ab raised against 
a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 61-84 in the alpha1 domain of 
the predicted HLA-F protein. HLA-F is expressed as a 
beta2-microglobulin-associated, 42-kDa protein that shows a restricted tissue 
distribution. To date, we have detected this product only in peripheral blood B 
cells, B cell lines, and tissues containing B cells, in particular adult tonsil 
and fetal liver, a major site of B cell development. Thermostability assays 
suggest that HLA-F is expressed as an empty heterodimer devoid of peptide. 
Consistent with this, studies using endoglycosidase-H and cell surface 
immunoprecipitations also indicate that the overwhelming majority of HLA-F 
contains an immature oligosaccharide component and is expressed inside the cell. 
We have found that IFN-gamma treatment induces expression of HLA-F mRNA and 
HLA-F protein, but that this does not result in concomitant cell surface 
expression. HLA-F associates with at least two components of the conventional 
class I assembly pathway, calreticulin and TAP. The unusual characteristics of 
the predicted peptide-binding groove together with the predominantly 
intracellular localization raise the possibility that HLA-F may be capable of 
binding only a restricted set of peptides.
