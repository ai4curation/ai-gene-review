Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapts to hypoxia by expressing a large group of 
"anaerobic" genes. Among these, the eight DAN/TIR genes are regulated by the 
repressors Rox1 and Mot3 and the activator Upc2/Mox4. In attempting to identify 
factors recruited by the DNA binding repressor Mot3 to enhance repression of the 
DAN/TIR genes, we found that the histone deacetylase and global repressor 
complex, Rpd3-Sin3-Sap30, was not required for repression. Strikingly, the 
complex was instead required for activation. In addition, the histone H3 and H4 
amino termini, which are targets of Rpd3, were also required for DAN1 
expression. Epistasis tests demonstrated that the Rpd3 complex is not required 
in the absence of the repressor Mot3. Furthermore, the Rpd3 complex was required 
for normal function and stable binding of the activator Upc2 at the DAN1 
promoter. Moreover, the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex was strongly 
required for activation of DAN1, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis 
showed an Rpd3-dependent reduction in DAN1 promoter-associated nucleosomes upon 
induction. Taken together, these data provide evidence that during anaerobiosis, 
the Rpd3 complex acts at the DAN1 promoter to antagonize the chromatin-mediated 
repression caused by Mot3 and Rox1 and that chromatin remodeling by Swi/Snf is 
necessary for normal expression.
