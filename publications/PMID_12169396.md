BCAS2 is a novel gene isolated from breast cancer cell line by differential 
display technique. Previously we reported that BCAS2 gene is localized on 
chromosome 1p13.3-21 and is up-regulated by gene amplification in breast cancer 
cell lines MCF-7 and BT-20. In this study, we investigated the amplification of 
the BCAS2 gene in a series of 104 gynecological primary tumors by means of 
Southern blot analysis. The BCAS2 gene was amplified in two of 60 primary breast 
cancer tissues, whereas no amplification was detected in any of endometrial 
(0/26) and cervical (0/18) tumor tissues. Gene amplification was also not 
detected in a series of pancreatic (0/9) and gastric (0/6) cancer cell lines. An 
enhanced green fluorescent protein assay revealed that BCAS2 protein seems to be 
translocated into the nucleus. Although frequent deletions of the proximal 
region of chromosome 1p13.3-21 have been found in primary breast cancer, our 
results support first evidence of amplification within this region and indicate 
that BCAS2 gene codes for a nuclear protein.
