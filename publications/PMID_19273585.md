While hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a major actor in the cell survival 
response to hypoxia, HIF also is associated with cell death. Several studies 
implicate the HIF-induced putative BH3-only proapoptotic genes bnip3 and bnip3l 
in hypoxia-mediated cell death. We, like others, do not support this assertion. 
Here, we clearly demonstrate that the hypoxic microenvironment contributes to 
survival rather than cell death by inducing autophagy. The ablation of Beclin1, 
a major actor of autophagy, enhances cell death under hypoxic conditions. In 
addition, the ablation of BNIP3 and/or BNIP3L triggers cell death, and BNIP3 and 
BNIP3L are crucial for hypoxia-induced autophagy. First, while the small 
interfering RNA-mediated ablation of either BNIP3 or BNIP3L has little effect on 
autophagy, the combined silencing of these two HIF targets suppresses 
hypoxia-mediated autophagy. Second, the ectopic expression of both BNIP3 and 
BNIP3L in normoxia activates autophagy. Third, 20-mer BH3 peptides of BNIP3 or 
BNIP3L are sufficient in initiating autophagy in normoxia. Herein, we propose a 
model in which the atypical BH3 domains of hypoxia-induced BNIP3/BNIP3L have 
been designed to induce autophagy by disrupting the Bcl-2-Beclin1 complex 
without inducing cell death. Hypoxia-induced autophagy via BNIP3 and BNIP3L is 
clearly a survival mechanism that promotes tumor progression.
