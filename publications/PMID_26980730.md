Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is essential for assembly and maintenance of 
cilia and flagella as well as ciliary motility and signaling. IFT is mediated by 
multisubunit complexes, including IFT-A, IFT-B, and the BBSome, in concert with 
kinesin and dynein motors. Under high salt conditions, purified IFT-B complex 
dissociates into a core subcomplex composed of at least nine subunits and at 
least five peripherally associated proteins. Using the visible 
immunoprecipitation assay, which we recently developed as a convenient 
protein-protein interaction assay, we determined the overall architecture of the 
IFT-B complex, which can be divided into core and peripheral subcomplexes 
composed of 10 and 6 subunits, respectively. In particular, we identified 
TTC26/IFT56 and Cluap1/IFT38, neither of which was included with certainty in 
previous models of the IFT-B complex, as integral components of the core and 
peripheral subcomplexes, respectively. Consistent with this, a ciliogenesis 
defect of Cluap1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts was rescued by exogenous 
expression of wild-type Cluap1 but not by mutant Cluap1 lacking the binding 
ability to other IFT-B components. The detailed interaction map as well as 
comparison of subcellular localization of IFT-B components between wild-type and 
Cluap1-deficient cells provides insights into the functional relevance of the 
architecture of the IFT-B complex.
