Vesicular acidification and trafficking are associated with various cellular 
processes. However, their pathologic relevance to cancer remains elusive. We 
identified transmembrane protein 9 (TMEM9) as a vesicular acidification 
regulator. TMEM9 is highly upregulated in colorectal cancer. Proteomic and 
biochemical analyses show that TMEM9 binds to and facilitates assembly of 
vacuolar-ATPase (v-ATPase), a vacuolar proton pump, resulting in enhanced 
vesicular acidification and trafficking. TMEM9-v-ATPase hyperactivates 
Wnt/β-catenin signalling via lysosomal degradation of adenomatous polyposis coli 
(APC). Moreover, TMEM9 transactivated by β-catenin functions as a positive 
feedback regulator of Wnt signalling in colorectal cancer. Genetic ablation of 
TMEM9 inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation in vitro, ex vivo and in 
vivo mouse models. Moreover, administration of v-ATPase inhibitors suppresses 
intestinal tumorigenesis of APC mouse models and human patient-derived 
xenografts. Our results reveal the unexpected roles of TMEM9-controlled 
vesicular acidification in hyperactivating Wnt/β-catenin signalling through APC 
degradation, and propose the blockade of TMEM9-v-ATPase as a viable option for 
colorectal cancer treatment.
