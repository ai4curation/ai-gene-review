Bromodomain-PHD finger protein 1 (BRPF1) is part of the MOZ HAT complex and 
contains a unique combination of domains typically found in chromatin-associated 
factors, which include plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, a bromodomain and a 
proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline (PWWP) domain. Bromodomains are conserved 
structural motifs generally known to recognize acetylated histones, and the 
BRPF1 bromodomain preferentially selects for H2AK5ac, H4K12ac and H3K14ac. We 
solved the X-ray crystal structures of the BRPF1 bromodomain in complex with the 
H2AK5ac and H4K12ac histone peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis on residues in 
the BRPF1 bromodomain-binding pocket was carried out to investigate the 
contribution of specific amino acids on ligand binding. Our results provide 
critical insights into the molecular mechanism of ligand binding by the BRPF1 
bromodomain, and reveal that ordered water molecules are an essential component 
driving ligand recognition.
