Integrin ligand binding induces a signaling complex formation via the direct 
association of the docking protein p130(Cas) (Cas) with diverse molecules. We 
report here that the 14-3-3zeta protein interacts with Cas in the yeast 
two-hybrid assay. We also found that the two proteins associate in mammalian 
cells and that this interaction takes place in a phosphoserine-dependent manner, 
because treatment of Cas with a serine phosphatase greatly reduced its ability 
to bind 14-3-3zeta. Furthermore, the Cas-14-3-3zeta interaction was found to be 
regulated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Thus, when cells are detached from 
the extracellular matrix, the binding of Cas to 14-3-3zeta is greatly 
diminished, whereas replating the cells onto fibronectin rapidly induces the 
association. Consistent with these results, we found that the subcellular 
localization of Cas and 14-3-3 is also regulated by integrin ligand binding and 
that the two proteins display a significant co-localization during cell 
attachment to the extracellular matrix. In conclusion, our results demonstrate 
that 14-3-3 proteins participate in integrin-activated signaling pathways 
through their interaction with Cas, which, in turn, may contribute to important 
biological responses regulated by cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.
