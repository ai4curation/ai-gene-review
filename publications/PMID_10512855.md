The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a limited life-span, which is measured by 
the number of divisions that individual cells complete. Among the many changes 
that occur as yeasts age are alterations in chromatin-dependent transcriptional 
silencing. We have genetically manipulated histone deacetylases to modify 
chromatin, and we have examined the effect on yeast longevity. Deletion of the 
histone deacetylase gene RPD3 extended life-span. Its effects on chromatin 
functional state were evidenced by enhanced silencing at the three known 
heterochromatic regions of the genome, the silent mating type (HM), 
subtelomeric, and rDNA loci, which occurred even in the absence of SIR3. 
Similarly, the effect of the rpd3Delta on life-span did not depend on an intact 
Sir silencing complex. In fact, deletion of SIR3 itself had little effect on 
life-span, although it markedly accelerated the increase in cell generation time 
that is observed during yeast aging. Deletion of HDA1, another histone 
deacetylase gene, did not result in life-span extension, unless it was combined 
with deletion of SIR3. The hda1Delta sir3Delta resulted in an increase in 
silencing, but only at the rDNA locus. Deletion of RPD3 suppressed the loss of 
silencing in rDNA in a sir2 mutant; however, the silencing did not reach the 
level found in the rpd3Delta single mutant, and RPD3 deletion did not overcome 
the life-span shortening seen in the sir2 mutant. Deletion of both RPD3 and HDA1 
caused a decrease in life-span, which resulted from a substantial increase in 
initial mortality of the population. The expression of both of these genes 
declines with age, providing one possible explanation for the increase in 
mortality during the life-span. Our results are consistent with the loss of rDNA 
silencing leading to aging in yeast. The functions of RPD3 and HDA1 do not 
overlap entirely. RPD3 exerts its effect on chromatin at additional sites in the 
genome, raising the possibility that events at loci other than rDNA play a role 
in the aging process.
