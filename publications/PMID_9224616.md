Mammalian cells express two genetically distinct isoforms of DNA topoisomerase 
II, designated topoisomerase IIalphaand topoisomerase IIbeta. We have recently 
shown that mouse topoisomerase IIalpha can substitute for the yeast 
topoisomerase II enzyme and complement yeast top2 mutations. This functional 
complementation allowed functional analysis of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of 
mammalian topoisomerase II, where the amino acid sequences are divergent and 
species-specific, in contrast to the highly conserved N-terminal and central 
domains. Several C-terminal deletion mutants of mouse topoisomerase IIalpha were 
constructed and expressed in yeast top2 cells. We found that the CTD of 
topoisomerase IIalphais dispensable for enzymatic activity in vitro but is 
required for nuclear localization in vivo. Interestingly, the CTD of 
topoisomerase IIbetawas also able to function as a signal for nuclear targeting. 
We therefore examined whether the CTD alone is sufficient for nuclear 
localization in vivo . The C-terminal region was fused to GFP (green fluorescent 
protein) and expressed under the GAL1 promoter in yeast cells. As expected, GFP 
signal was exclusively detected in the nucleus, irrespective of the CTD derived 
from either topoisomerase IIalphaor IIbeta. Surprisingly, when the upstream 
sequence of each CTD was added nuclear localization of the GFP signal was found 
to be cell cycle dependent: topoisomerase IIalpha-GFP was seen in the mitotic 
nucleus but was absent from the interphase nucleus, while topoisomerase 
IIbeta-GFP was detected predominantly in the interphase nucleus and less in the 
mitotic nucleus. Our results suggest that the catalytically dispensable CTD of 
topoisomerase II is sufficient as a signal for nuclear localization and that 
yeast cells can distinguish between the two isoforms of mammalian topoisomerase 
II, localizing each protein properly.
