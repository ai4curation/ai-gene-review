The crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, growing optimally at temperatures 
between 75 and 80 °C, thrives in volcanic hot spring habitats that are typified 
by large temperature gradients, which impose frequent temperature stresses on 
the cells. Heat shock response is characterized by an upregulation of heat shock 
proteins, but similar to most (hyper-)thermophilic archaea, S. acidocaldarius 
seems to be able to bear supra-optimal temperatures with a restricted repertoire 
of chaperones. Here, we study the physiological consequences of continuous 
high-temperature stress and rapid heat shock for S. acidocaldarius. Growth 
experiments and cell viability assays demonstrate that temperatures of 85 °C and 
higher result in a decreased growth rate and, when the cells are rapidly 
subjected to a heat shock, a dynamic increase in mRNA levels of all relevant 
heat shock proteins and a subset of transcription regulators is observed. When 
exponentially growing cultures are exposed to a heat shock, the survival tipping 
point is situated around 90 °C, and the rate of heating determines whether cells 
are able to cope with this stress or whether the defense mechanism immediately 
fails, leading to extensive cell death. In conclusion, S. acidocaldarius does 
not seem to be better equipped to handle sudden supra-optimal temperature stress 
than mesophilic organisms.
