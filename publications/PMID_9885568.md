Iron-sulfur clusters are prosthetic groups that are required for the function of 
numerous enzymes in the cell, including enzymes important in respiration, 
photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation. Here we report cloning of the human 
homolog of NifS, a cysteine desulfurase that is proposed to supply the inorganic 
sulfur in iron-sulfur clusters. In human cells, different forms of NifS that 
localize either to mitochondria or to the cytosol and nucleus are synthesized 
from a single transcript through initiation at alternative inframe AUGs, and 
initiation site selection varies according to the pH of the medium or cytosol. 
Thus, a novel form of translational regulation permits rapid redistribution of 
NifS proteins into different compartments of the cell in response to changes in 
metabolic status.
