The insulin receptor (IR) and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) 
have a highly homologous structure, but different biological effects. Insulin 
and IGF-I half-receptors can heterodimerize, leading to the formation of 
insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors (Hybrid-Rs) that bind IGF-I with high affinity. 
As the IR exists in two isoforms (IR-A and IR-B), we evaluated whether the 
assembly of the IGF-IR with either IR-A or IR-B moieties may differently affect 
Hybrid-R signaling and biological role. Three different models were studied: (a) 
3T3-like mouse fibroblasts with a disrupted IGF-IR gene (R(-) cells) 
cotransfected with the human IGF-IR and with either the IR-A or IR-B cDNA; (b) a 
panel of human cell lines variably expressing the two IR isoforms; and (c) HepG2 
human hepatoblastoma cells predominantly expressing either IR-A or IR-B, 
depending on their differentiation state. We found that Hybrid-Rs containing 
IR-A (Hybrid-Rs(A)) bound to and were activated by IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin. 
By binding to Hybrid-Rs(A), insulin activated the IGF-I half-receptor 
beta-subunit and the IGF-IR-specific substrate CrkII. In contrast, Hybrid-Rs(B) 
bound to and were activated with high affinity by IGF-I, with low affinity by 
IGF-II, and insignificantly by insulin. As a consequence, cell proliferation and 
migration in response to both insulin and IGFs were more effectively stimulated 
in Hybrid-R(A)-containing cells than in Hybrid-R(B)-containing cells. The 
relative abundance of IR isoforms therefore affects IGF system activation 
through Hybrid-Rs, with important consequences for tissue-specific responses to 
both insulin and IGFs.
