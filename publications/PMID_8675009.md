The molecular pathway of p53-dependent apoptosis (programmed cell death) is 
poorly understood. Because p53 binds to the basal transcription-repair complex 
TFIIH and modulates its DNA helicase activities, we hypothesized that TFIIH DNA 
helicases XPB and XPD are members of the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway. Whereas 
transfer of a wild-type p53 expression vector by microinjection or retroviral 
infection into primary normal human fibroblasts resulted in apoptosis, primary 
fibroblasts from individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), who are deficient 
in DNA repair and have germ-line mutations in the XPB or XPD gene, but not in 
the XPA or XPC gene, have a deficiency in the apoptotic response. This 
deficiency can be rescued by transferring the wild-type XPB or XPD gene into the 
corresponding mutant cells. XP-D lymphocytes also have a decreased apoptotic 
response to DNA damage by adriamycin, indicating a physiologically relevant 
deficiency. The XP-B or XP-D mutant cells undergo a normal apoptotic response 
when microinjected with the Ich-L, and ICE genes. Analyses of p53 mutants and 
the effects of microinjected anti-p53 antibody, Pab421, indicate that the 
carboxyl terminus of p53 may be required for apoptosis. Direct microinjection of 
the p53 carboxy-terminal-derived peptide (amino acid residues 319-393) resulted 
in apoptosis of primary normal human fibroblasts. These results disclose a novel 
pathway of p53-induced apoptosis.
