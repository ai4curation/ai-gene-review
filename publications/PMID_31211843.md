Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by deletions or 
mutations in survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1). The molecular mechanisms underlying 
motor neuron degeneration in SMA remain elusive, as global cellular dysfunction 
obscures the identification and characterization of disease-relevant pathways 
and potential therapeutic targets. Recent reports have implicated microRNA 
(miRNA) dysregulation as a potential contributor to the pathological mechanism 
in SMA. To characterize miRNAs that are differentially regulated in SMA, we 
profiled miRNA levels in SMA induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor 
neurons. From this array, miR-23a downregulation was identified selectively in 
SMA motor neurons, consistent with previous reports where miR-23a functioned in 
neuroprotective and muscle atrophy-antagonizing roles. Reintroduction of miR-23a 
expression in SMA patient iPSC-derived motor neurons protected against 
degeneration, suggesting a potential miR-23a-specific disease-modifying effect. 
To assess this activity in vivo, miR-23a was expressed using a 
self-complementary adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (scAAV9) viral vector in 
the Smn2B/- SMA mouse model. scAAV9-miR-23a significantly reduced the pathology 
in SMA mice, including increased motor neuron size, reduced neuromuscular 
junction pathology, increased muscle fiber area, and extended survival. These 
experiments demonstrate that miR-23a is a novel protective modifier of SMA, 
warranting further characterization of miRNA dysfunction in SMA.
