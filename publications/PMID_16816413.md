Perturbation of the protein-folding environment in the mitochondrial matrix 
selectively upregulates the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial 
chaperones. To identify components of the signal transduction pathway(s) 
mediating this mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)), we first 
isolated a temperature-sensitive mutation (zc32) that conditionally activates 
the UPR(mt) in C. elegans and subsequently searched for suppressors by 
systematic inactivation of genes. RNAi of ubl-5, a gene encoding a 
ubiquitin-like protein, suppresses activation of the UPR(mt) markers hsp-60::gfp 
and hsp-6::gfp by the zc32 mutation and by other manipulations that promote 
mitochondrial protein misfolding. ubl-5 (RNAi) inhibits the induction of 
endogenous mitochondrial chaperone encoding genes hsp-60 and hsp-6 and 
compromises the ability of animals to cope with mitochondrial stress. 
Mitochondrial morphology and assembly of multi-subunit mitochondrial complexes 
of biotinylated proteins are also perturbed in ubl-5(RNAi) worms, indicating 
that UBL-5 also counteracts physiological levels of mitochondrial stress. 
Induction of mitochondrial stress promotes accumulation of GFP-tagged UBL-5 in 
nuclei of transgenic worms, suggesting that UBL-5 effects a nuclear step 
required for mounting a response to the threat of mitochondrial protein 
misfolding.
