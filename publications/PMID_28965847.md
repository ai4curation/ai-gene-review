The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway is a key signaling pathway orchestrating 
embryonic development, mainly of the CNS and limbs. In vertebrates, SHH 
signaling is mediated by the primary cilium, and genetic defects affecting 
either SHH pathway members or ciliary proteins cause a spectrum of developmental 
disorders. SUFU is the main negative regulator of the SHH pathway and is 
essential during development. Indeed, Sufu knock-out is lethal in mice, and 
recessive pathogenic variants of this gene have never been reported in humans. 
Through whole-exome sequencing in subjects with Joubert syndrome, we identified 
four children from two unrelated families carrying homozygous missense variants 
in SUFU. The children presented congenital ataxia and cerebellar vermis 
hypoplasia with elongated superior cerebellar peduncles (mild "molar tooth 
sign"), typical cranio-facial dysmorphisms (hypertelorism, depressed nasal 
bridge, frontal bossing), and postaxial polydactyly. Two siblings also showed 
polymicrogyria. Molecular dynamics simulation predicted random movements of the 
mutated residues, with loss of the native enveloping movement of the binding 
site around its ligand GLI3. Functional studies on cellular models and 
fibroblasts showed that both variants significantly reduced SUFU stability and 
its capacity to bind GLI3 and promote its cleavage into the repressor form 
GLI3R. In turn, this impaired SUFU-mediated repression of the SHH pathway, as 
shown by altered expression levels of several target genes. We demonstrate that 
germline hypomorphic variants of SUFU cause deregulation of SHH signaling, 
resulting in recessive developmental defects of the CNS and limbs which share 
features with both SHH-related disorders and ciliopathies.
