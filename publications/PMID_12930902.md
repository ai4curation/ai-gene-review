The linkage of sister chromatids after DNA replication ensures the faithful 
inheritance of chromosomes by daughter cells. In budding yeast, the 
establishment of sister chromatid cohesion requires Ctf8, Dcc1, and Ctf18, a 
homologue of the p140 subunit of the replication factor C (RFC). In this report 
we demonstrate that in 293T cells, Flag-tagged Ctf18 forms a seven-subunit 
cohesion-RFC complex comprised of Ctf18, Dcc1, Ctf8, RFCp40, RFCp38, RFCp37, and 
RFCp36 (Ctf18-RFC). We demonstrate that a stoichiometric heteroheptameric 
Ctf18-RFC complex can be assembled by coexpressing the seven proteins in 
baculovirus-infected insect cells. In addition, the two other stable 
subcomplexes were formed, which include a pentameric complex comprised of Ctf18, 
RFCp40, RFCp38, RFCp37, and RFCp36 and a dimeric Dcc1-Ctf8. Both the five- and 
seven-subunit Ctf18-RFC complexes bind to single-stranded and primed DNAs and 
possess weak ATPase activity that is stimulated by the addition of primed DNA 
and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). These complexes catalyzed the 
ATP-dependent loading of PCNA onto primed and gapped DNA but not onto 
double-stranded nicked or single-stranded circular DNAs. Consistent with these 
observations, both Ctf18-RFC complexes substituted for the replicative RFC in 
the PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase delta-catalyzed DNA replication reaction. 
These results support a model in which sister chromatid cohesion is linked to 
DNA replication.
