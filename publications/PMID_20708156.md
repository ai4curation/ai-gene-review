Mdm2 is the major negative regulator of the p53 pathway. Here, we report that 
Mdm2 is rapidly degraded after DNA damage and that phosphorylation of Mdm2 by 
casein kinase I (CKI) at multiple sites triggers its interaction with, and 
subsequent ubiquitination and destruction, by SCF(beta-TRCP). Inactivation of 
either beta-TRCP or CKI results in accumulation of Mdm2 and decreased p53 
activity, and resistance to apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents. Moreover, 
SCF(beta-TRCP)-dependent Mdm2 turnover also contributes to the control of 
repeated p53 pulses in response to persistent DNA damage. Our results provide 
insight into the signaling pathways controlling Mdm2 destruction and further 
suggest that compromised regulation of Mdm2 results in attenuated p53 activity, 
thereby facilitating tumor progression.

Introduction

Tumors often arise through gain of function of certain oncogenes concomitantly with loss of key tumor suppressors. The p53 protein is considered an important tumor suppressor because its function is compromised in over 50% of human tumors ( Hollstein et al., 1991 ). The ability of p53 to suppress tumor development is primarily attributed to its activity as a transcription factor that can activate a wide variety of downstream target genes that are responsible for p53-dependent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis upon a variety of cellular stresses ( Harms et al., 2004 ; Levine, 1997 ), such as p21 ( Bunz et al., 1998 ; el-Deiry et al., 1993 ), Gadd45, 14-3-3 ( Chan et al., 1999 ; Wang et al., 1999 ) and Bax ( Zhang et al., 2000 ). Because of its crucial role in response to DNA damage, p53 is critical for maintaining the integrity of the genome ( Daujat et al., 2001 ; Harper and Elledge, 2007 ; Levine et al., 2004 ).

Due to the important role of p53 in regulating cell proliferation and survival, its activity has to be tightly regulated ( Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). In normal unstressed cells, p53 activity must be kept low because inappropriate activation of p53 promotes premature senescence or apoptosis ( Blaydes and Wynford-Thomas, 1998 ; Mendrysa et al., 2003 ). On the other hand, p53 destruction must be quickly disabled to allow for the rapid establishment of the p53 stress response ( Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). Central to this regulatory mechanism is the Mdm2 protein, a major negative regulator of p53, which promotes p53 ubiquitination and subsequent destruction in unstressed cells ( Haupt et al., 1997 ; Midgley and Lane, 1997 ). The Mdm2 protein’s N-terminus interacts with p53 and its C-terminal ring-finger domain, which possesses the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, ubiquitinates p53 ( Kussie et al., 1996 ). The importance of Mdm2 in p53 regulation is further illustrated by the fact that the embryonic lethal phenotype in Mdm2 knockout mice can be partially rescued by further inactivation of the p53 protein ( Montes de Oca Luna et al., 1995 ).

Previous studies showed that binding of Mdm2 to p53 is subject to many layers of regulation. Among them, the DNA damage-induced ATM/ATR/CHK kinase cascade plays a pivotal role. In response to stress such as DNA damage, activation of the ATM/ATR/CHK kinase pathway results in p53 phosphorylation, which disrupts the interaction between Mdm2 and p53, allowing p53 to escape Mdm2 mediated proteolysis and become stabilized ( Chehab et al., 2000 ; Harper and Elledge, 2007 ; Hirao et al., 2000 ). It was reported that in response to DNA damage signals, the Mdm2 protein was quickly degraded ( Stommel and Wahl, 2004 ), allowing p53 to accumulate and become fully activated. However, the molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. Although it is proposed that Mdm2 undergoes auto-ubiquitination when cells are challenged with DNA damage agents ( Stommel and Wahl, 2004 ; Stommel and Wahl, 2005 ), a recent study utilizing transgenic mice provided definitive evidence that the E3 ligase activity of Mdm2 is not required for the proper destruction of Mdm2 ( Itahana et al., 2007 ). This suggests that the destruction of Mdm2 is controlled by an as yet unknown pathway. The goal of this study was to delineate the molecular mechanisms governing Mdm2 ubiquitination and destruction.

Discussion

The data presented here provides evidence for a molecular mechanism by which CKI-dependent phosphorylation of Mdm2 at multiple sites triggers SCF β-TRCP -mediated Mdm2 destruction ( Figure 8 ). It is well recognized that most F-box proteins, including β-TRCP, interact with their ubiquitin substrates only after they are properly phosphorylated ( Petroski and Deshaies, 2005 ). Therefore, the destruction of these substrates is regulated primarily at their phosphorylation by appropriate kinases. In the case of Mdm2, specific CKI isoforms control the timing of Mdm2 turnover. In support of this idea, blocking CKI activity resulted in a marked increase in the steady-state abundance of Mdm2. It is known that CKI activity is subject to many layers of regulation ( Giamas et al., 2007 ; Knippschild et al., 2005 ; Swiatek et al., 2004 ). Here we report the nuclear localization of CKIδ and its interaction with Mdm2 was enhanced in response to DNA damage. However, additional studies are required to fully understand the molecular mechanisms by which CKIδ activity is regulated in response to DNA damage and during cell cycle progression.

We demonstrated that the major CKI phosphorylation sites are located in the Mdm2 acidic domain (p2), while other minor CKI sites are located in the N-terminal DSG site (p1) and the C-terminal SQ cluster (p3) region. More interestingly, sequential inactivation of the potentially critical Ser/Thr sites for suboptimal degrons in Mdm2 resulted in a progressive reduction of CKI-mediated phosphorylation ( Figure 4B ), which correlated well with reduced interaction of Mdm2 with β-TRCP1 ( Figure 4C ), and reduced destruction of Mdm2. Furthermore, individual mutation of each phosphorylation site did not show considerable protection against β-TRCP1/CKIδ-mediated destruction (data not shown). This suggests that, in contrast to many known β-TRCP1 substrates that contain one optimized canonical degron sequence, such as Emi-1 or Claspin, the Mdm2 protein contains many suboptimal degron sequences that are phosphorylated by CKI. Other β-TRCP1 substrates, including Cdc25A ( Kanemori et al., 2005 ) and Gli3 ( Pan et al., 2006 ; Tempe et al., 2006 ; Wang and Li, 2006 ), are also known to contain multiple degron sequences. A similar mechanism has been described for SCF Cdc4 -dependent turnover of the Sic1 Cdk inhibitor ( Nash et al., 2001 ). Multi-site phosphorylation likely represents a more general mechanism for creating switch-like transitions via SCF-dependent turnover pathways ( Ferrell, 2001 ; Harper, 2002 ). Our studies suggested that the cumulative, multisite phosphorylation of Mdm2 by CKIδ might set up a switch for Mdm2 destruction in response to DNA damage and during the cell cycle.

It was reported previously that Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination plays an important role in DNA-damage triggered Mdm2 destruction ( Stommel and Wahl, 2004 ). However, in agreement with a recent report ( Itahana et al., 2007 ), we found that Mdm2 C464A could be efficiently degraded in response to various types of DNA damage agents (data not shown). More importantly, co-expression of CKIδand β-TRCP1 promotes destruction of Mdm2 C464A , but not Δp2- Mdm2 C464A , as efficiently as the wild-type Mdm2 ( Figure 5B ). These findings suggest that CKI-mediated phosphorylation, rather than the ring-finger domain, might be critical for Mdm2 destruction after DNA damage. Nevertheless, Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination also plays a critical role in regulating the steady state level of Mdm2 during the cell cycle, as Mdm2 C464A was more stable than wild-type Mdm2 in synchronous cell cycle release experiments ( Figure 6A ). Consistent with gain-of-function experiments, depletion of β-TRCP1 also stabilized Mdm2 C464A ( Figure 6B ). Taken together, these data indicate that constitutive Mdm2 destruction during the cell cycle is tightly regulated by both auto-ubiquitination and β-TRCP1-mediated ubiquitination pathways.

Mdm2 is an oncoprotein that is frequently overexpressed in tumors, which enhances cellular transformation ( Momand et al., 2000 ). Although amplification of the MDM2 locus has been found in some cases, the molecular mechanism leading to elevated Mdm2 expression in most tumors remains unclear. Our studies suggested that disruption of the Mdm2 destruction pathway could potentially contribute to increased Mdm2 abundance. This could be achieved by inactivation of its E3 ligase β-TRCP1 ( Frescas and Pagano, 2008 ; Nakayama and Nakayama, 2005 ), inactivation of its modifying enzyme CKI, or by acquiring mutations that disrupt its phosphorylation by CKI. Similarly, both c-Myc gene amplification and mutations within the degron sequence are thought to contribute to c-Myc overexpression in cancers ( Welcker et al., 2004 ). In this regard, it is interesting that alterations in β-TRCP1 have been reported in many types of cancers ( Nakayama and Nakayama, 2005 ). Our data suggest that a compromised Mdm2 destruction pathway might lead to enhanced Mdm2 oncogenic activity by promoting p53 destruction and thus facilitating tumor progression. Further studies may reveal the extent to which the CKI/β-TRCP pathway and its linkage to Mdm2 is disrupted in cancer.
