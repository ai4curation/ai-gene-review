Abstract

Neuroactive peptides are packaged as proproteins into dense core vesicles or secretory granules, where they are cleaved at dibasic residues by copackaged proprotein convertases. We show here that the Caenorhabditis elegans egl-3 gene encodes a protein that is 57% identical to mouse proprotein convertase type 2 (PC2), and we provide evidence that this convertase regulates mechanosensory responses. Nose touch sensitivity (mediated by ASH sensory neurons) is defective in mutants lacking GLR-1 glutamate receptors (GluRs); however, mutations eliminating the egl-3 PC2 restored nose touch sensitivity to glr-1 GluR mutants. By contrast, body touch sensitivity (mediated by the touch cells) is greatly diminished in egl-3 PC2 mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that egl-3 PC2-processed peptides normally regulate the responsiveness of C. elegans to mechanical stimuli.

RESULTS

We have used a genetic strategy to investigate how two particular C. elegans mechanosensory responses, aversive responses to body touch and nose touch, are modulated. Nose and body touch responses are mediated by different classes of mechanosensory neurons (Fig. 1 A ). Body touch sensitivity is mediated by a set of six mechanosensory neurons, termed the touch cells, which have sensory endings in either the anterior or posterior body regions ( Chalfie and Au, 1989 ). Anterior body touch evokes backward movement, whereas posterior body touch evokes forward movement. Nose touch sensitivity is primarily mediated by the ASH sensory neurons ( Kaplan and Horvitz, 1993 ). The ASH neurons also mediate responsiveness to hyper-osmolarity and to volatile repellents ( Bargmann et al., 1990 ; Troemel et al., 1995 ). In this respect, the ASH neurons are similar to mammalian type C nociceptor neurons, which are also polymodal, sensing painful chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli ( Besson and Chaouch, 1987 ). All three ASH sensory stimuli evoke backward movement but do so via distinct signaling pathways ( Hart et al., 1999 ). The effects of nose and body touch on locomotion are mediated by direct synaptic connections between mechanosensory neurons and interneurons that drive locomotion, which are referred to here as command neurons (Fig. 1 B,C ).

Several results suggest that ASH-command neuron synapses are glutamatergic. All three ASH-mediated sensory behaviors are defective in eat-4 mutants ( Berger et al., 1998 ; Hart et al., 1999 ), which lack the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) ( Bellochio et al., 2000 ; Takamori et al., 2000 ), and hence are defective for glutamate neurotransmission ( Lee et al., 1999 ). The eat-4 VGLUT gene is expressed in the ASH neurons ( Lee et al., 1999 ), suggesting that ASH is glutamatergic. Consistent with this idea, the glr-1 gene encodes an AMPA-type glutamate receptor (GluR) that is expressed in the command interneurons ( Hart et al., 1995 ; Maricq et al., 1995 ), and these receptors are clustered at command neuron synapses in vivo ( Rongo et al., 1998 ). Mutants that lack glr-1 GluRs ( Hart et al., 1995 ; Maricq et al., 1995 ) or those that fail to cluster glr-1 GluRs at command neuron synapses ( Rongo et al., 1998 ) are defective for ASH-mediated nose touch sensitivity. Together these results demonstrate that glutamate neurotransmission is required for ASH-mediated sensory responses and that ASH-command neuron synapses are glutamatergic.

DISCUSSION

We have shown that the egl-3 PC2 gene plays a pivotal role in egg-laying behavior and in regulating the sensitivity of C. elegans to mechanosensory stimuli. We showed that mutations in egl-3 PC2 completely restored the nose touch response of glr-1 GluR mutants, suggesting that egl-3 PC2-processed peptides regulate the function of ASH-command neuron synapses. By contrast, mutants lacking egl-3 PC2 had diminished responsiveness to body touch stimuli. Our primary conclusion from these results is that the levels of egl-3 PC2 activity set the sensitivity of animals to two distinct touch stimuli.

Which egl-3 PC2 substrates are responsible for the behavioral defects we observed? The C. elegans genome sequence predicts the presence of at least 41 genes that encode potential neuropeptides, of which 20 are predicted to encode FMRFamide-related proteins (FaRPs), and 19 encode other neuropeptide-like proteins ( Li et al., 1999 ). In addition, ∼40 genes are predicted to encode insulin-like proteins ( Duret et al., 1998 ; Gregoire et al., 1998 ; Kawano et al., 2000 ). It is likely that this represents an underestimate of the number of potential egl-3 PC2 substrates, because genes encoding small peptides may have been missed by gene predicting algorithms.

One strategy for predicting egl-3 PC2 substrates is to compare the phenotype of egl-3 PC2 mutants with those of neuropeptide or neuropeptide receptor mutants. The flp-1 gene encodes 8 potential FaRPs ( Nelson et al., 1998 ). Furthermore, the command neurons are stained with anti-FaRP antibodies ( Schinkmann and Li, 1992 ), consistent with the idea that FaRPs might play a role in regulating mechanosensory responsiveness. However, immunostaining with anti-FaRP antibodies (which detect only properly processed FaRP peptides) is superficially normal in egl-3 PC2 mutants (J. Kass, unpublished observations), suggesting that egl-3 PC2 is not required to process FaRPs. Mutations in a neuropeptide receptor homolog (NPR-1) cause C. elegans to forage in groups ( de Bono and Bargmann, 1998 ), which is not observed in homozygous egl-3 PC2 mutants. Mutations in the insulin-like signaling pathway alter longevity and dauer formation ( Kimura et al., 1997 ; Duret et al., 1998 ; Gregoire et al., 1998 ; Kawano et al., 2000 ). Homozygous egl-3 PC2 mutants do not have a dauer constitutive phenotype; however, insulin-like peptides have been implicated in both promoting and inhibiting dauer formation ( Pierce et al., 2001 ). Therefore, our results do not exclude the possibility that egl-3 PC2 plays a role in processing endogenous insulin-like ligands. We conclude that the egl-3 PC2 behavioral defects are caused by the failure to synthesize a neuropeptide or neurohormone; however, the identity of the critical peptide or peptides is currently unknown.

The pronounced egg-laying and mechanosensory defects observed in egl-3 PC2 mutants suggests that neuropeptides or neurohormones play a critical role in these behaviors. Others have previously shown that FaRPs encoded by the flp-1 gene alter the timing of egg-laying events ( Waggoner et al., 2000 ); however, the egg-laying defects observed in egl-3 PC2 mutants are far more severe than those found in flp-1 mutants ( Nelson et al., 1998 ). Thus, it is likely egg-laying behavior is regulated by flp-1 FaRPs and by additional (currently unidentified) neuropeptides. Our analysis focused primarily on the role of egl-3 PC2 in mechanosensory responses.

How does egl-3 PC2 regulate mechanosensory responses? Neuropeptides and neurohormones often act as neuromodulators, regulating the impact of classical transmitters ( Kupfermann, 1991 ). Neuropeptides can also act as trophic factors. However, we consider the latter an unlikely explanation for our results, because there was no obvious change in ASH or command neuron cell numbers or axon morphologies in egl-3 PC2 mutants (Kass, unpublished observations). Therefore, we favor the idea that changes in mechanosensory responsiveness in egl-3 PC2 mutants are caused by the absence of neuromodulatory peptides.

Homozygous egl-3 PC2 mutants have reciprocal defects in the nose and body touch responses. To explain the opposite effects of egl-3 PC2 mutations on these two responses, it is necessary to propose that the egl-3 PC2-processed peptides regulate synapses that are unique to each of these circuits (Fig. 1 ). In the case of the nose touch response, we propose that egl-3 PC2-processed peptides are released by the command neurons and that these peptides regulate the ASH-command neuron synapses. It is less likely that egl-3 PC2-processed peptides regulate the command neuron–motor neuron synapses, which are shared between the nose and body touch circuits. In the case of the body touch response, we propose that egl-3 PC2 acts in the touch neurons, which we have shown to express this convertase. Function in the command neurons is less likely in this case, because expressing wild-type egl-3 PC2 in the command neurons did not correct the body touch insensitivity defect of the egl-3 PC2 mutants.

Peptides released from the command neurons might inhibit nose touch-evoked ASH-command neuron neurotransmission by either of two sorts of mechanisms. Peptides could inhibit stimulus-evoked glutamate release from ASH. Alternatively, peptides might inhibit the response of command neurons to glutamate released from ASH. In either of these scenarios, ASH-command neuron synapses might be more efficacious in egl-3 PC2 mutants, thereby increasing ASH-mediated nose touch sensitivity. Further experiments are required to distinguish between these possibilities.

Regulation of mechanosensory responses by egl-3 PC2-processed peptides could provide a mechanism for C. elegans to modulate its locomotion in response to a change in ambient conditions. Different patterns of electrical activity are typically required to evoke release of neuropeptides than are required to release classical neurotransmitters. In general, neuropeptide release occurs only after high-frequency presynaptic activity or after more extreme membrane depolarization ( Whim and Lloyd, 1989 ; Peng and Horn, 1991 ). Thus, we would predict that trains of touch stimuli or particularly intense stimuli would lead to the neuropeptide-induced decrease in mechanosensitivity. One attractive possibility is that neuropeptide release is involved in habituation of the nose touch response. We previously showed that responsiveness to nose touch is diminished by a train of 40 nose touch stimuli, whereas single touch stimuli do not alter sensitivity ( Hart et al., 1999 ). We speculate that trains of touch stimuli are able to evoke neuropeptide release from the interneurons, which could contribute to the decreased sensitivity to further touch stimuli. Further experiments are required to test the potential connection between neuropeptides and habituation of the nose touch response.

In summary, we propose that unidentified neuropeptides regulate mechanosensory responses in C. elegans . Others have previously shown that neuropeptides regulate sensitivity of mice to painful stimuli. Knock-out mice lacking either substance P or its receptor have normal sensitivity to low-intensity noxious stimuli, but are less responsive to moderate noxious stimuli ( Cao et al., 1998 ; De Felipe et al., 1998 ). Although the precise mechanisms involved may differ, our results suggest that C. elegans will provide a useful genetic model for studying the molecular mechanisms by which neuropeptides modulate sensory responses.
