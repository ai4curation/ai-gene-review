We have generated a protein-protein interaction network in Bacillus subtilis 
focused on several essential cellular processes such as cell division, cell 
responses to various stresses, the bacterial cytoskeleton, DNA replication and 
chromosome maintenance by careful application of the yeast two-hybrid approach. 
This network, composed of 793 interactions linking 287 proteins with an average 
connectivity of five interactions per protein, represents a valuable resource 
for future functional analyses. A striking feature of the network is a group of 
highly connected hubs (GoH) linking many different cellular processes. Most of 
the proteins of the GoH have unknown functions and are associated to the 
membrane. By the integration of available knowledge, in particular of 
transcriptome data sets, the GoH was decomposed into subgroups of party hubs 
corresponding to protein complexes or regulatory pathways expressed under 
different conditions. At a global level, the GoH might function as a very robust 
group of date hubs having partially redundant functions to integrate information 
from the different cellular pathways. Our analyses also provide a rational way 
to study the highly redundant functions of the GoH by a genetic approach.
