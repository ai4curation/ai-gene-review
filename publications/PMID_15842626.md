Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous gram-positive bacterium that can cause 
superficial to serious systemic infections in animals and humans. Here we report 
the development of a plant infection model to study the pathogenesis of this 
bacterium. Three global regulatory mutants, RN6911 (agr-), ALC 488 (sarA-) ALC 
842 (sarA-/agr-) and an alpha-toxin mutant defective in biofilm formation 
(DU1090) which are attenuated in animal pathogenesis, were also attenuated in 
their ability to infect plants, suggesting that these regulators that mediate 
synthesis of virulence factors essential for animal pathogenesis are also 
required for plant pathogenesis. Further, using Arabidopsis plants altered in 
defense responses such as the transgenic lines NahG [defective in salicylic acid 
(SA) accumulation], and 35S-LOX2- (defective in jasmonic acid production and 
hyper-accumulator of SA), and mutants ics1 (depleted in SA accumulation), and 
npr1-1 (non-expressor of pathogenesis-related protein) we show that resistance 
of Arabidopsis to typical plant pathogens and the animal pathogen S. aureus is 
conserved and is mediated by SA. The data presented here suggest that 
Arabidopsis thaliana resistance to S. aureus is mediated either by a direct 
effect of SA on the pathogen, specifically one that affects the 
attachment/aggregate formation on the root surface and reduces the pathogen's 
virulence, or by SA-dependent, NPR1-independent host responses.
