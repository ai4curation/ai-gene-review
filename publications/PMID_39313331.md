Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic mode of cell death characterized by 
iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation. While lipid radical 
elimination reaction catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a major 
anti-ferroptosis mechanism, inhibiting this pathway pharmaceutically shows 
promise as an antitumor strategy. However, certain tumor cells exhibit 
redundancy in lipid radical elimination pathways, rendering them unresponsive to 
GPX4 inhibitors. In this study, we conducted screens across different cancer 
cell lines and Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, leading to the 
identification of temsirolimus in combination with the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 as a 
potent inducer of ferroptosis in liver cancer cells. Mechanistically, 
temsirolimus sensitized liver cancer cells to ferroptosis by directly binding to 
and inhibiting ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) enzyme. Notably, while 
temsirolimus is recognized as a potent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
inhibitor, its ferroptosis-inducing effect is primarily attributed to the 
inhibition of FSP1 rather than mTOR activity. By employing in vitro colony 
formation assays and in vivo tumor xenograft models, we demonstrated that the 
combination of temsirolimus and RSL3 effectively suppressed liver tumor 
progression. This tumoricidal effect was associated with increased lipid 
peroxidation and induction of ferroptosis. In conclusion, our findings 
underscore the potential of combining multitarget ferroptosis-inducing agents to 
circumvent the resistance to ferroptosis of liver cancer cells and highlight 
temsirolimus as a promising FSP1 inhibitor and ferroptosis inducer, which also 
deserves further investigation in translational medicine.

IntroductionEvasion of cell death is generally accepted as a hallmark of cancer, and key regulators of cell death pathways are regarded as important pharmaceutical targets for the development of cancer medications (Koren and Fuchs, 2021; Hanahan, 2022). Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death characterized by peroxidation of the phospholipids and phenotypically distinct from apoptosis and necrosis (Jiang et al., 2021). Among ferroptosis regulators, the antioxidative enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is the first defined anti-ferroptosis protein and can efficiently eliminate lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) using reduced glutathione (GSH) as a reducing agent (Dixon et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014). Genetical ablation of GPX4 or pharmaceutical inhibition of its enzyme activity with small-molecule inhibitors, such as RSL3 and FIN56, can induce ferroptosis (Shimada et al., 2016). In accordance, erastin, the first reported small-molecule ferroptosis inducer, is an inhibitor of System Xc−, a trans-membrane cystine/glutamate antiporter system. Its inhibition blocks cellular uptake of cysteine from the environment and subsequently reduces GSH synthesis that is decisive to GPX4 activity (Dixon et al., 2012).Besides GPX4-dependent pathways, GPX4-independent defenders also exist to protect cells against ferroptosis. For instance, it was recently reported that ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) could inhibit ferroptosis in a coenzyme Q (coQ)-dependent mechanism. Both FSP1 and DHODH are oxidoreductases that catalyze the reduction of ubiquinone (coQ) to produce ubiquinol (CoQH2) (Bersuker et al., 2019; Mao et al., 2021). Although widely known as the electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain of oxidative phosphorylation, CoQH2 is also a reducing agent solubilized in the lipid phase of cellular membranes and functions as an efficient radical-trapping antioxidant that can suppress ferroptosis by eliminating lipid peroxyl radicals (Bersuker et al., 2019; Doll et al., 2019; Mao et al., 2021). In addition, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a potent antioxidant and can trap lipid ROS and protect membrane lipids from peroxidation. Enzymes for the biosynthesis of BH4, such as GTP cyclohydroxylase-1, 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase, sepiapterin reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), were reported to support cell survival by inhibiting ferroptosis, especially when GPX4 was inhibited (Kraft et al., 2020; Soula et al., 2020).Lipid peroxidation is an inevitable by-product of multiple cellular processes affecting iron homeostasis, redox homeostasis, and lipid metabolism (von Krusenstiern et al., 2023). PIK3CA mutations or PTEN deletion has been reported to make cancer cells resistant to ferroptosis through multiple mechanisms, such as promoting GPX4 protein synthesis, suppressing autophagy-dependent ferroptosis, or boosting monounsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipid synthesis (Zhang et al., 2021). Oncogenic mutations in p53, KEAP1, RAS, or BAP1 can upregulate cysteine transport through a transcriptional or epigenetic mechanism, which in turn is converted to GSH and fuels GPX4-mediated lipid ROS elimination (Jiang et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016b; Chen et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2019). Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of SLC7A11 effectively inhibits KRAS-mutated tumor progression, offering potential therapeutic approaches for RAS-mutated tumors (Hu et al., 2020). Increasing evidence suggests that ferroptosis pathways merit further exploration to provide potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment (Lei et al., 2022).Although numerous proof-of-concept studies employing tool compounds support pharmaceutically inducing ferroptosis as a strategy for cancer intervention, at least two major drawbacks have hindered the widespread application of ferroptosis inducers. Firstly, there remains a shortage of in vivo applicable ferroptosis inducers with sufficient safety and selectivity. Notably, there are no published reports of GPX4 inhibitors or other anti-ferroptosis targets under clinical trials. Given this gap, repurposing approved drugs presents an attractive and pragmatic approach to identify ferroptosis-inducing compounds. Secondly, inhibition of a single anti-ferroptosis pathway usually proves inadequate in inducing ferroptosis, due to the presence of redundant mechanisms for lipid ROS clearance across a wide range of tumor cells. For instance, tumor cells from various cancer types, including SW480 (colorectal cancer) cells, SGC-7901 (stomach cancer) cells (Gong et al., 2023), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells (Schmitt et al., 2023), breast cancer cells (Park et al., 2023), and bladder cancer cells (Liu et al., 2023b), have demonstrated resistance to RSL3. In this study, we conducted a pan-cancer survey of tumor cells to identify novel targets and compounds capable of overcoming the current limitations of ferroptosis-inducing drugs in cancer treatment.

Introduction

Evasion of cell death is generally accepted as a hallmark of cancer, and key regulators of cell death pathways are regarded as important pharmaceutical targets for the development of cancer medications (Koren and Fuchs, 2021; Hanahan, 2022). Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death characterized by peroxidation of the phospholipids and phenotypically distinct from apoptosis and necrosis (Jiang et al., 2021). Among ferroptosis regulators, the antioxidative enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is the first defined anti-ferroptosis protein and can efficiently eliminate lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) using reduced glutathione (GSH) as a reducing agent (Dixon et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014). Genetical ablation of GPX4 or pharmaceutical inhibition of its enzyme activity with small-molecule inhibitors, such as RSL3 and FIN56, can induce ferroptosis (Shimada et al., 2016). In accordance, erastin, the first reported small-molecule ferroptosis inducer, is an inhibitor of System Xc−, a trans-membrane cystine/glutamate antiporter system. Its inhibition blocks cellular uptake of cysteine from the environment and subsequently reduces GSH synthesis that is decisive to GPX4 activity (Dixon et al., 2012).

Besides GPX4-dependent pathways, GPX4-independent defenders also exist to protect cells against ferroptosis. For instance, it was recently reported that ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) could inhibit ferroptosis in a coenzyme Q (coQ)-dependent mechanism. Both FSP1 and DHODH are oxidoreductases that catalyze the reduction of ubiquinone (coQ) to produce ubiquinol (CoQH2) (Bersuker et al., 2019; Mao et al., 2021).

Lipid peroxidation is an inevitable by-product of multiple cellular processes affecting iron homeostasis, redox homeostasis, and lipid metabolism (von Krusenstiern et al., 2023). PIK3CA mutations or PTEN deletion has been reported to make cancer cells resistant to ferroptosis through multiple mechanisms, such as promoting GPX4 protein synthesis, suppressing autophagy-dependent ferroptosis, or boosting monounsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipid synthesis (Zhang et al., 2021).

Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of SLC7A11 effectively inhibits KRAS-mutated tumor progression, offering potential therapeutic approaches for RAS-mutated tumors (Hu et al., 2020). Increasing evidence suggests that ferroptosis pathways merit further exploration to provide potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment (Lei et al., 2022).

Although numerous proof-of-concept studies employing tool compounds support pharmaceutically inducing ferroptosis as a strategy for cancer intervention, at least two major drawbacks have hindered the widespread application of ferroptosis inducers. Firstly, there remains a shortage of in vivo applicable ferroptosis inducers with sufficient safety and selectivity. Notably, there are no published reports of GPX4 inhibitors or other anti-ferroptosis targets under clinical trials. Given this gap, repurposing approved drugs presents an attractive and pragmatic approach to identify ferroptosis-inducing compounds. Secondly, inhibition of a single anti-ferroptosis pathway usually proves inadequate in inducing ferroptosis, due to the presence of redundant mechanisms for lipid ROS clearance across a wide range of tumor cells. For instance, tumor cells from various cancer types, including SW480 (colorectal cancer) cells, SGC-7901 (stomach cancer) cells (Gong et al., 2023), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells (Schmitt et al., 2023), breast cancer cells (Park et al., 2023), and bladder cancer cells (Liu et al., 2023b), have demonstrated resistance to RSL3. In this study, we conducted a pan-cancer survey of tumor cells to identify novel targets and compounds capable of overcoming the current limitations of ferroptosis-inducing drugs in cancer treatment.

ResultsLiver cancer cells are resistant to GPX4-dependent ferroptosisTo comprehensively investigate the anti-ferroptosis pathways across diverse cancer types, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis, utilizing RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), of the relative expression profiles of genes encoding four key lipid ROS-eliminating enzymes: GPX4, FSP1, DHODH, and DHFR (Figure 1A and B). GPX4 exhibited ubiquitous expression across all tumor types assessed, with no discernible disparity in its mRNA expression levels between tumor and normal tissues. This widespread expression pattern underscores the fundamental role of GPX4 in lipid ROS regulation across various cancer types. Conversely, the expression levels of the other three genes displayed notable variation depending on the specific cancer type, suggesting potential contributions of these lipid ROS-eliminating enzymes to the resistance against ferroptosis inducers in certain cancer contexts. Moreover, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis to determine the correlation between the expression of ferroptosis-related genes and drug sensitivity in the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) dataset. Our analysis revealed that high mRNA expression of FSP1, but not GPX4 or DHODH, was positively correlated with the resistance to numerous drugs, including five known to induce ferroptosis (Supplementary Figure S1).Figure 1Liver cancer cells are resistant to GPX4-dependent ferroptosis.

(F) Heatmaps depicting the sensitivity of different human cancer cell lines to RSL3-induced cell death. Each cell line is represented by a row, and the intensity of color reflects the degree of sensitivity, with darker shades indicating greater sensitivity to RSL3-induced cell death.Next, we performed the cell viability assay to assess the efficacy of the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 in inhibiting the growth of a diverse panel of 28 cell lines derived from various tumor types. We utilized HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line generally acknowledged to be sensitive to RSL3, as the reference standard to gauge the sensitivity of other tested cancer cell lines to RSL3. Accordingly, the 28 cell lines were categorized into three distinct groups: sensitive, partially responsive, and resistant to RSL3-induced ferroptosis (Figure 1C–F). Notably, resistance to RSL3-induced ferroptosis was consistently observed across all liver cancer cell lines examined (Figure 1E and F). These findings underscore the pressing need for alternative therapeutic strategies to target ferroptosis resistance, specifically in the context of liver cancer.Screening of FDA-approved drugs identifies potent ferroptosis inducers in liver cancer cellsTo elucidate the mechanism underlying the resistance of liver cancer cells to GPX4-dependent ferroptosis, we generated two distinct clones of GPX4 knockout (GPX4-KO) cells derived from parental HT1080 or BEL-7404, a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line (Figure 2A). Our data demonstrated that depletion of GPX4 led to a remarkable reduction in cell proliferation in HT1080 cells, and this effect could be rescued by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a specific inhibitor of ferroptosis (Figure 2B), reaffirming the pivotal role of GPX4 as the primary defense against lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in HT1080 cells (Dixon et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2021). In contrast, depletion of GPX4 failed to change the proliferation of BEL-7404 cells (Figure 2C), similar to that observed in another HCC cell line, SK-Hep1 (Supplementary Figure S2A and B), suggesting the intriguing possibility of a GPX4-independent mechanism suppressing ferroptosis in liver cancer cells.Figure 2Screening of FDA-approved drugs identifies potent ferroptosis inducers in liver cancer cells. (A) Verification of GPX4-KO HT1080 and BEL-7404 cells by western blot analysis. (B and C) GPX4-KO HT1080 and BEL-7404 monoclones were treated with DMSO or Fer-1, and cell proliferation was measured by the luminescent cell viability assay. (D) Schematic illustration of screening for ferroptosis-inducing compounds from FDA-approved drugs. Wild-type (WT) and GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells were treated with 1600 drugs from the library for 24 h, and then cell viability was measured. (E) List of top hits from FDA-approved drug screening. The relative lethal rate in combination with GPX4-KO is calculated as follow: (1 − viabilityGPX4-KO/viabilityWT) × 100%. (F) Temsirolimus induces cell death in GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells. WT and GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells were treated with different concentrations of temsirolimus for 24 h, and cell viability was measured. (G) Schematic illustration of GPX4-independent mechanism to suppress ferroptosis in liver cancer cells.To explore GPX4-independent ferroptosis pathways in liver cancer cells, we conducted an unbiased screen of the ferroptosis-inducing capacity of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs (Figure 2D). To this end, BEL-7404 cells with or without GPX4-KO were treated with equal amounts of drugs, and cell viabilities were determined and compared. Based on the rationale that the potential drug that suppresses the GPX4-independent pathway in liver cancer cells should cause more cell death in GPX4-KO cells than in wild-type cells, the top hit with the highest relative mortality rate among 1600 screened compounds was temsirolimus (hereafter referred to TEM in figures, also known as CCI-779 or WAY-130779) (Figure 2E). Temsirolimus, an ester of sirolimus (rapamycin) that can selectively inhibit the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and thereby block the translation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, has been used to treat patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (Simpson and Curran, 2008). Propidium iodide (PI) staining revealed that treatment with temsirolimus increased the death of GPX4-KO SK-Hep1 cells in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S2C). Likewise, temsirolimus robustly decreased the cell viability of GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells, with the median lethal dose (LD50) being 0.72–0.89 μM (Figure 2F). Collectively, these findings suggest that temsirolimus may target a GPX4-independent pathway, which counteracts ferroptosis in liver cancer cells (Figure 2G).FSP1 confers liver cancer cell resistance to ferroptosisSeveral proteins act as GPX4-independent defenders that remove lipid ROS and protect cells against ferroptosis, including DHFR, DHODH, and FSP1 (Doll et al., 2019; Soula et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2021). To uncover which GPX4-independent defenders are involved in lipid ROS elimination pathways in liver cancer, we re-analyzed TCGA data from LIHC patients and found that the mRNA expression of FSP1, but not DHFR or DHODH, was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to peritumoral normal tissues (Figure 3A). Next, we generated two independent clones of FSP1-KO cells derived from BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technique (Figure 3B; Supplementary Figure S3A) and found that depletion of FSP1 could sensitize liver cancer cells to RSL3 treatment (Figure 3C; Supplementary Figure S3B). The decreased viability of FSP1-KO liver cancer cells after RSL3 treatment was associated with increased lipid peroxidation (Figure 3D; Supplementary Figure S3C). This increase in lipid peroxidation was, however, not observed in wild-type or GPX4-KO cells after RSL3 treatment (Figure 3D). Moreover, PI staining demonstrated that temsirolimus treatment led to increased death of GPX4-KO liver cancer cells, and such effect was completely abolished by Fer-1 (Figure 3E), suggesting that the combination of GPX4-KO and temsirolimus treatment can induce ferroptosis in liver cancer cells. Importantly, GPX4 inhibition by RSL3 in combination with temsirolimus treatment led to increased cell death (ferroptosis) in wild-type BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 cells, but such effect was diminished in FSP1-KO liver cancer cells (Figure 3F). Altogether, these results suggest that, in liver cancer cells, FSP1 is an important defender in preventing lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, and the ferroptosis-inducing effect of temsirolimus in GPX4-defective liver cancer cells relies on the presence of FSP1.Figure 3FSP1 confers liver cancer cell resistance to ferroptosis.

(C) FSP1-KO sensitizes BEL-7404 cells to RSL3-induced ferroptosis. WT and FSP1-KO BEL-7404 monoclones were treated with different concentrations of RSL3 for 24 h before the measurement of cell viability. (D) WT, FSP1-KO, and GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells were treated with or without RSL3. Cellular lipid ROS levels were determined by C11-BODIPY staining and flow cytometry. (E) Temsirolimus-induced cell death could be rescued by Fer-1 treatment. Representative images of cell morphology and PI staining in GPX4-KO BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 cells after treatment with DMSO, temsirolimus, and/or Fer-1 are shown. (F) FSP1-KO abolishes the sensitization of liver cancer cells to temsirolimus-induced ferroptosis. WT and FSP1-KO BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 cells were treated with different concentrations of RSL3 and temsirolimus for 24 h, and cell viability was measured.Temsirolimus induces ferroptosis by directly inhibiting FSP1 activityWe next set out to explore how temsirolimus regulates FSP1 and ferroptosis. As temsirolimus is widely recognized as an mTOR inhibitor, we first tested whether temsirolimus inhibited FSP1 through inhibiting mTOR, by including two analogs of temsirolimus, tacrolimus and everolimus, as experimental controls (Figure 4A). We found that both temsirolimus and everolimus could dose-dependently inhibit mTOR in BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 liver cancer cells, as evidenced by reduced S6K and S6 phosphorylation levels and 4EBP1 phosphorylation shifts (Figure 4B; Supplementary Figure S4A). In contrast, tacrolimus was unable to inhibit mTOR (Figure 4A and B; Supplementary Figure S4A). None of these three drugs could change the protein expression of endogenous GPX4 or FSP1 in BEL-7404 cells (Figure 4B). Interestingly, we found that treatment with temsirolimus, tacrolimus, and everolimus led to remarkable, moderate, and no increase, respectively, in lipid peroxidation in GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells (Figure 4C). Consistently, treatment with temsirolimus, tacrolimus, or rapamycin, but not everolimus, significantly induced cell death (ferroptosis) in GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells, with temsirolimus exhibiting the most potent effect (Figure 4D; Supplementary Figure S4D). The inconsistency of these rapalogs in promoting ferroptosis and inhibiting mTOR (Figure 4A) indicated that temsirolimus promoted lipid peroxidation and induced ferroptosis in a manner independent of its mTOR-inhibiting function. Moreover, we found that depletion of FKBP1A (also known as FKBP12), an essential factor mediating the inhibitory effect of mTOR by temsirolimus, failed to change the cellular sensitivity to RSL3 and/or temsirolimus treatment (Supplementary Figure S4B and C), confirming that temsirolimus-induced ferroptosis occurs independently of mTOR inhibition.Figure 4Temsirolimus induces ferroptosis by directly inhibiting FSP1 activity.

The activity of FSP1 was measured by monitoring NADH consumption. (I) Illustration diagram of proposed anti-ferroptosis pathways in liver cancer cells.We then examined the effect of temsirolimus on FSP1 enzyme activity. The isothermal titration calorimetry assay showed that temsirolimus directly bound to purified FSP1 protein in vitro, with a dissociation constant around 5.28 μM (Figure 4E). In contrast, everolimus could not bind to FSP1 protein (Figure 4F). The binding between FSP1 and temsirolimus was confirmed by the cellular thermos shift assay, in which temsirolimus could increase the thermal stability of Flag-tagged FSP1 but failed to change the thermal stability of HSC70 as a negative control (Figure 4G). It is known that FSP1 acts as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H)-dependent oxidoreductase and catalyzes the reduction of CoQ to the radical-trapping antioxidant CoQH2, which suppresses phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis (Bersuker et al., 2019). We compared the effects of temsirolimus, tacrolimus, and everolimus on FSP1 enzyme activity by carefully monitoring the consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in vitro. Our data demonstrated that temsirolimus could potently inhibit the activity of FSP1, while everolimus and tacrolimus showed little effect (Figure 4H). Collectively, our results indicate that the ferroptosis-inducing effect of temsirolimus in GPX4-defective liver cancer cells is due to direct binding and enzymatic inhibition of FSP1 (Figure 4I).Combination therapy targeting multiple ferroptosis pathways overcomes cancer cell resistance in vitro and in vivoThe observation that GPX4 inhibition (by RSL3) in combination with FSP1 inhibition (by temsirolimus) robustly induced ferroptosis in cultured liver cancer cell lines encouraged us to determine the efficacy of combined treatments in overcoming drug resistance. We found that the sole application of RSL3 or temsirolimus had either no or moderate effects on the colony formation of BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 cells, while the combined treatment showed a remarkable inhibitory effect (Figure 5A and B; Supplementary Figure S5A).Figure 5Combination therapy targeting multiple ferroptosis pathways overcomes cancer cell resistance in vitro and in vivo.

(B) Colony numbers were quantified manually from independent biological replicates, and the significance was calculated by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. (C) Schematic illustration of liver cancer xenograft model. BEL-7404 cells were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into nude mice to form xenograft tumors. Tumor-bearing mice were then treated by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of RSL3 (10 mg/kg), temsirolimus (10 mg/kg), or the combination of two drugs (n = 8 per group). (D) Images of tumors at the endpoint (Day 32). (E) The volumes of BEL-7404 xenograft tumors at different time points (measured every 2 days). Error bars represent mean ± SD. P-values were determined by two-way ANOVA (n = 8 independent repeats). (F) Tumor weight at the endpoint (Day 32). (G) Representative images of tumor histology with the indicated treatments. Scale bar, 50 μm. The immunochemistry staining of Ki67, TUNEL, and 4-HNE was conducted and the staining score was quantified. The significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test.Supporting the important role of FSP1 in sustaining liver cancer cell survival and proliferation, genetic depletion of FSP1 led to decreased colony formation in BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 cells (Supplementary Figure S5B). We then extended our investigation to tumor cell lines from other cancer types. Remarkably, combined treatments showed significant synergistic inhibitory effects on colony formation of both RSL3-resistant and partially responsive cell lines (Figure 1D and E; Supplementary Figure S6) but not the RSL3-sensitive A498 (renal cancer) or temsirolimus-sensitive MCF7 (breast cancer) cell line (Supplementary Figure S7). These data suggest that the combination of ferroptosis inducers (GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 and FSP1 inhibitor temsirolimus) holds promise for tumor suppression across multiple cancer types.Finally, we established a xenograft liver cancer model by subcutaneously injecting BEL-7404 cells into nude mice, followed by serial drug treatment with RSL3 and/or temsirolimus (Figure 5C). We found that RSL3 alone failed to affect the growth of liver tumors in vivo (Figure 5D–F), consistent with our findings in cell culture experiments (Figure 5A and B). Differently, temsirolimus alone exhibited a notable effect on inhibiting tumor growth. More importantly, the combination of temsirolimus and RSL3 displayed a clear synergistic effect on suppressing tumor growth (Figure 5D–F). Histology analysis of xenograft tumors further elucidated the efficacy of combination therapy. Tumors subjected to combination therapy with temsirolimus and RSL3 exhibited the significant increase in cell apoptosis, decrease in cell proliferation, and increase in lipid peroxidation, indicated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), Ki67, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonaldehyde (4-HNE) staining, respectively, compared to tumors treated with either drug alone or the solvent control (Figure 5G). In sum, while temsirolimus alone inhibits cancer cell proliferation by targeting the mTOR pathway, combination therapy with RSL3 and temsirolimus exerts an additional inhibitory effect on liver cancer cell growth by inducing cancer cell ferroptosis in vivo.

Liver cancer cells are resistant to GPX4-dependent ferroptosisTo comprehensively investigate the anti-ferroptosis pathways across diverse cancer types, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis, utilizing RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), of the relative expression profiles of genes encoding four key lipid ROS-eliminating enzymes: GPX4, FSP1, DHODH, and DHFR (Figure 1A and B). GPX4 exhibited ubiquitous expression across all tumor types assessed, with no discernible disparity in its mRNA expression levels between tumor and normal tissues. This widespread expression pattern underscores the fundamental role of GPX4 in lipid ROS regulation across various cancer types. Conversely, the expression levels of the other three genes displayed notable variation depending on the specific cancer type, suggesting potential contributions of these lipid ROS-eliminating enzymes to the resistance against ferroptosis inducers in certain cancer contexts. Moreover, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis to determine the correlation between the expression of ferroptosis-related genes and drug sensitivity in the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) dataset. Our analysis revealed that high mRNA expression of FSP1, but not GPX4 or DHODH, was positively correlated with the resistance to numerous drugs, including five known to induce ferroptosis (Supplementary Figure S1).Figure 1Liver cancer cells are resistant to GPX4-dependent ferroptosis.

We utilized HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line generally acknowledged to be sensitive to RSL3, as the reference standard to gauge the sensitivity of other tested cancer cell lines to RSL3. Accordingly, the 28 cell lines were categorized into three distinct groups: sensitive, partially responsive, and resistant to RSL3-induced ferroptosis (Figure 1C–F). Notably, resistance to RSL3-induced ferroptosis was consistently observed across all liver cancer cell lines examined (Figure 1E and F). These findings underscore the pressing need for alternative therapeutic strategies to target ferroptosis resistance, specifically in the context of liver cancer.

Screening of FDA-approved drugs identifies potent ferroptosis inducers in liver cancer cellsTo elucidate the mechanism underlying the resistance of liver cancer cells to GPX4-dependent ferroptosis, we generated two distinct clones of GPX4 knockout (GPX4-KO) cells derived from parental HT1080 or BEL-7404, a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line (Figure 2A). Our data demonstrated that depletion of GPX4 led to a remarkable reduction in cell proliferation in HT1080 cells, and this effect could be rescued by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a specific inhibitor of ferroptosis (Figure 2B), reaffirming the pivotal role of GPX4 as the primary defense against lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in HT1080 cells (Dixon et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2021). In contrast, depletion of GPX4 failed to change the proliferation of BEL-7404 cells (Figure 2C), similar to that observed in another HCC cell line, SK-Hep1 (Supplementary Figure S2A and B), suggesting the intriguing possibility of a GPX4-independent mechanism suppressing ferroptosis in liver cancer cells.Figure 2Screening of FDA-approved drugs identifies potent ferroptosis inducers in liver cancer cells.

(G) Schematic illustration of GPX4-independent mechanism to suppress ferroptosis in liver cancer cells.To explore GPX4-independent ferroptosis pathways in liver cancer cells, we conducted an unbiased screen of the ferroptosis-inducing capacity of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs (Figure 2D). To this end, BEL-7404 cells with or without GPX4-KO were treated with equal amounts of drugs, and cell viabilities were determined and compared. Based on the rationale that the potential drug that suppresses the GPX4-independent pathway in liver cancer cells should cause more cell death in GPX4-KO cells than in wild-type cells, the top hit with the highest relative mortality rate among 1600 screened compounds was temsirolimus (hereafter referred to TEM in figures, also known as CCI-779 or WAY-130779) (Figure 2E). Temsirolimus, an ester of sirolimus (rapamycin) that can selectively inhibit the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and thereby block the translation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, has been used to treat patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (Simpson and Curran, 2008). Propidium iodide (PI) staining revealed that treatment with temsirolimus increased the death of GPX4-KO SK-Hep1 cells in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S2C). Likewise, temsirolimus robustly decreased the cell viability of GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells, with the median lethal dose (LD50) being 0.72–0.89 μM (Figure 2F). Collectively, these findings suggest that temsirolimus may target a GPX4-independent pathway, which counteracts ferroptosis in liver cancer cells (Figure 2G).

FSP1 confers liver cancer cell resistance to ferroptosisSeveral proteins act as GPX4-independent defenders that remove lipid ROS and protect cells against ferroptosis, including DHFR, DHODH, and FSP1 (Doll et al., 2019; Soula et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2021). To uncover which GPX4-independent defenders are involved in lipid ROS elimination pathways in liver cancer, we re-analyzed TCGA data from LIHC patients and found that the mRNA expression of FSP1, but not DHFR or DHODH, was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to peritumoral normal tissues (Figure 3A). Next, we generated two independent clones of FSP1-KO cells derived from BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technique (Figure 3B; Supplementary Figure S3A) and found that depletion of FSP1 could sensitize liver cancer cells to RSL3 treatment (Figure 3C; Supplementary Figure S3B). The decreased viability of FSP1-KO liver cancer cells after RSL3 treatment was associated with increased lipid peroxidation (Figure 3D; Supplementary Figure S3C). This increase in lipid peroxidation was, however, not observed in wild-type or GPX4-KO cells after RSL3 treatment (Figure 3D). Moreover, PI staining demonstrated that temsirolimus treatment led to increased death of GPX4-KO liver cancer cells, and such effect was completely abolished by Fer-1 (Figure 3E), suggesting that the combination of GPX4-KO and temsirolimus treatment can induce ferroptosis in liver cancer cells. Importantly, GPX4 inhibition by RSL3 in combination with temsirolimus treatment led to increased cell death (ferroptosis) in wild-type BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 cells, but such effect was diminished in FSP1-KO liver cancer cells (Figure 3F). Altogether, these results suggest that, in liver cancer cells, FSP1 is an important defender in preventing lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, and the ferroptosis-inducing effect of temsirolimus in GPX4-defective liver cancer cells relies on the presence of FSP1.Figure 3FSP1 confers liver cancer cell resistance to ferroptosis.

FSP1 confers liver cancer cell resistance to ferroptosis

Several proteins act as GPX4-independent defenders that remove lipid ROS and protect cells against ferroptosis, including DHFR, DHODH, and FSP1 (Doll et al., 2019; Soula et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2021).

The decreased viability of FSP1-KO liver cancer cells after RSL3 treatment was associated with increased lipid peroxidation (Figure 3D; Supplementary Figure S3C). This increase in lipid peroxidation was, however, not observed in wild-type or GPX4-KO cells after RSL3 treatment (Figure 3D).

Temsirolimus induces ferroptosis by directly inhibiting FSP1 activityWe next set out to explore how temsirolimus regulates FSP1 and ferroptosis. As temsirolimus is widely recognized as an mTOR inhibitor, we first tested whether temsirolimus inhibited FSP1 through inhibiting mTOR, by including two analogs of temsirolimus, tacrolimus and everolimus, as experimental controls (Figure 4A). We found that both temsirolimus and everolimus could dose-dependently inhibit mTOR in BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 liver cancer cells, as evidenced by reduced S6K and S6 phosphorylation levels and 4EBP1 phosphorylation shifts (Figure 4B; Supplementary Figure S4A). In contrast, tacrolimus was unable to inhibit mTOR (Figure 4A and B; Supplementary Figure S4A). None of these three drugs could change the protein expression of endogenous GPX4 or FSP1 in BEL-7404 cells (Figure 4B). Interestingly, we found that treatment with temsirolimus, tacrolimus, and everolimus led to remarkable, moderate, and no increase, respectively, in lipid peroxidation in GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells (Figure 4C). Consistently, treatment with temsirolimus, tacrolimus, or rapamycin, but not everolimus, significantly induced cell death (ferroptosis) in GPX4-KO BEL-7404 cells, with temsirolimus exhibiting the most potent effect (Figure 4D; Supplementary Figure S4D). The inconsistency of these rapalogs in promoting ferroptosis and inhibiting mTOR (Figure 4A) indicated that temsirolimus promoted lipid peroxidation and induced ferroptosis in a manner independent of its mTOR-inhibiting function. Moreover, we found that depletion of FKBP1A (also known as FKBP12), an essential factor mediating the inhibitory effect of mTOR by temsirolimus, failed to change the cellular sensitivity to RSL3 and/or temsirolimus treatment (Supplementary Figure S4B and C), confirming that temsirolimus-induced ferroptosis occurs independently of mTOR inhibition.Figure 4Temsirolimus induces ferroptosis by directly inhibiting FSP1 activity.

The activity of FSP1 was measured by monitoring NADH consumption. (I) Illustration diagram of proposed anti-ferroptosis pathways in liver cancer cells.We then examined the effect of temsirolimus on FSP1 enzyme activity. The isothermal titration calorimetry assay showed that temsirolimus directly bound to purified FSP1 protein in vitro, with a dissociation constant around 5.28 μM (Figure 4E). In contrast, everolimus could not bind to FSP1 protein (Figure 4F). The binding between FSP1 and temsirolimus was confirmed by the cellular thermos shift assay, in which temsirolimus could increase the thermal stability of Flag-tagged FSP1 but failed to change the thermal stability of HSC70 as a negative control (Figure 4G). It is known that FSP1 acts as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H)-dependent oxidoreductase and catalyzes the reduction of CoQ to the radical-trapping antioxidant CoQH2, which suppresses phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis (Bersuker et al., 2019). We compared the effects of temsirolimus, tacrolimus, and everolimus on FSP1 enzyme activity by carefully monitoring the consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in vitro. Our data demonstrated that temsirolimus could potently inhibit the activity of FSP1, while everolimus and tacrolimus showed little effect (Figure 4H). Collectively, our results indicate that the ferroptosis-inducing effect of temsirolimus in GPX4-defective liver cancer cells is due to direct binding and enzymatic inhibition of FSP1 (Figure 4I).

Collectively, our results indicate that the ferroptosis-inducing effect of temsirolimus in GPX4-defective liver cancer cells is due to direct binding and enzymatic inhibition of FSP1 (Figure 4I).

Combination therapy targeting multiple ferroptosis pathways overcomes cancer cell resistance in vitro and in vivoThe observation that GPX4 inhibition (by RSL3) in combination with FSP1 inhibition (by temsirolimus) robustly induced ferroptosis in cultured liver cancer cell lines encouraged us to determine the efficacy of combined treatments in overcoming drug resistance. We found that the sole application of RSL3 or temsirolimus had either no or moderate effects on the colony formation of BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 cells, while the combined treatment showed a remarkable inhibitory effect (Figure 5A and B; Supplementary Figure S5A).Figure 5Combination therapy targeting multiple ferroptosis pathways overcomes cancer cell resistance in vitro and in vivo.

Scale bar, 50 μm. The immunochemistry staining of Ki67, TUNEL, and 4-HNE was conducted and the staining score was quantified. The significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test.Supporting the important role of FSP1 in sustaining liver cancer cell survival and proliferation, genetic depletion of FSP1 led to decreased colony formation in BEL-7404 and SK-Hep1 cells (Supplementary Figure S5B). We then extended our investigation to tumor cell lines from other cancer types. Remarkably, combined treatments showed significant synergistic inhibitory effects on colony formation of both RSL3-resistant and partially responsive cell lines (Figure 1D and E; Supplementary Figure S6) but not the RSL3-sensitive A498 (renal cancer) or temsirolimus-sensitive MCF7 (breast cancer) cell line (Supplementary Figure S7). These data suggest that the combination of ferroptosis inducers (GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 and FSP1 inhibitor temsirolimus) holds promise for tumor suppression across multiple cancer types.Finally, we established a xenograft liver cancer model by subcutaneously injecting BEL-7404 cells into nude mice, followed by serial drug treatment with RSL3 and/or temsirolimus (Figure 5C). We found that RSL3 alone failed to affect the growth of liver tumors in vivo (Figure 5D–F), consistent with our findings in cell culture experiments (Figure 5A and B). Differently, temsirolimus alone exhibited a notable effect on inhibiting tumor growth. More importantly, the combination of temsirolimus and RSL3 displayed a clear synergistic effect on suppressing tumor growth (Figure 5D–F). Histology analysis of xenograft tumors further elucidated the efficacy of combination therapy. Tumors subjected to combination therapy with temsirolimus and RSL3 exhibited the significant increase in cell apoptosis, decrease in cell proliferation, and increase in lipid peroxidation, indicated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), Ki67, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonaldehyde (4-HNE) staining, respectively, compared to tumors treated with either drug alone or the solvent control (Figure 5G). In sum, while temsirolimus alone inhibits cancer cell proliferation by targeting the mTOR pathway, combination therapy with RSL3 and temsirolimus exerts an additional inhibitory effect on liver cancer cell growth by inducing cancer cell ferroptosis in vivo.

DiscussionWhile inducing ferroptosis holds promise as a strategy to halt tumor progression, designing effective anticancer strategies to induce ferroptosis in vivo is imperative. In this study, we conducted an unbiased screen of 1600 FDA-approved drugs in GPX4-KO cells, leading to the identification of temsirolimus as a potent inducer of ferroptosis. We show that the ferroptosis-inducing effect of temsirolimus needs to be combined with GPX4 inhibitors such as RSL3, underscoring the necessity of targeting multiple anti-ferroptosis pathways to achieve tumoricidal effects in vivo, particularly in tumors resistant to GPX4-dependent ferroptosis. Temsirolimus belongs to the rapamycin analog drug family (rapalog) and has a long history in cancer treatment. As early as 1999, several rapalogs including rapamycin, temsirolimus, and everolimus entered into clinical trials sponsored by the US FDA and their efficacy in cancer treatment was tested (Alexandre et al., 1999). In 2007, temsirolimus became the first FDA-approved anticancer agent targeting the mTOR pathway for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer (Grover et al., 2007). Temsirolimus has demonstrated broad anticancer effects across various tumor types in clinical trials, including melanoma (Margolin et al., 2005), neuroendocrine tumors (Duran et al., 2006), breast cancer (Chan et al., 2005), and lung cancer (Pandya et al., 2007), and most, if not all, of the antitumor activity is attributed to its mTOR-inhibiting function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that temsirolimus inhibits tumor progression by directly promoting ferroptosis. This discovery may open up new avenues for leveraging temsirolimus as a ferroptosis-inducing agent in cancer therapy, potentially expanding its therapeutic repertoire beyond its established role as an mTOR inhibitor.The association between ferroptosis and the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway remains controversial. Some studies have shown that ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors, which are not able to act as radical-trapping antioxidants or iron chelators, can suppress ferroptosis induced by erastin (Conlon et al., 2021), implying that mTOR inhibition may not necessarily stimulate ferroptosis. Additionally, elevated mTOR activation and ferroptotic markers, such as 4-HNE and lipid peroxidation, have been observed in human fatty liver tissues compared to normal liver tissues (Liu et al., 2023a), further complicating the understanding of the relationship between mTOR and ferroptosis. Certain agents, such as a metal-free polymer photosensitizer BDPB, can activate mTOR while triggering ferroptosis in cultured cancer cell lines, such as A549, 4T1, and HeLa cells (Chen et al., 2023). Moreover, carboxyl polystyrene nanoparticles can inhibit mTOR and suppress ferroptosis in HK-2 cells derived from the normal kidney (Li et al., 2019). These contradictions have made mTOR an elusive target in ferroptosis regulation. It was reported that micromolar concentration of temsirolimus might induce ferroptosis in an mTOR-dependent manner, but the demand for a concentration three orders of magnitude higher than its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) toward mTOR indicated that the ferroptosis-inducing effect is probably an off-target effect (Yi et al., 2020).In this study, we provided evidence suggesting that temsirolimus induces ferroptosis through an mTOR-independent pathway. Specifically, we found that temsirolimus failed to induce ferroptosis in FSP1-KO liver cancer cells, indicating that this drug's mechanism of action involves, at least in part, targeting FSP1. Moreover, we demonstrated that temsirolimus directly binds to FSP1 and inhibits its enzyme activity. Despite the existence of specific FSP1 inhibitor iFSP1, its medicinal chemistry development has been limited, mainly due to the unfavorable structure and substitution pattern (Lovering et al., 2009). The second generation of FSP1 inhibitor, icFSP1, inhibits FSP1 through indirect mechanisms such as phase separation and membrane dissociation without affecting FSP1 expression and activity (Nakamura et al., 2023). In contrast, temsirolimus, as an FDA-approved drug with well-established efficacy and safety profiles in cancer treatment, represents a promising candidate for repurposing as an FSP1 inhibitor and ferroptosis inducer. Therefore, further exploration of temsirolimus's potential in translational studies is warranted.Besides temsirolimus, other FDA-approved drugs such as sorafenib can induce ferroptosis in GPX4-KO liver cancer cells (Figure 2E). Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor and the first-line drug in clinical to treat advanced HCC patients, but drug resistance commonly occurs (Chen et al., 2015). Although the underlying mechanisms for sorafenib resistance remain unclear, the upregulation of anti-ferroptosis proteins may contribute to sorafenib resistance in HCC patients. Supporting this notion, the upregulation of metallothionein-1G in an Nrf2-dependent manner has been implicated in sorafenib resistance by inhibiting ferroptosis (Sun et al., 2016a). Another ferroptosis blocker, sigma-1 receptor, has been reported to be upregulated after sorafenib treatment in HCC cells (Bai et al., 2019). Given the potential of sorafenib to induce ferroptosis, it is worthwhile to investigate whether combining sorafenib with ferroptosis inducers, such as GPX4 inhibitors and temsirolimus, could overcome resistance in HCC. Further exploration of these combination therapies in preclinical and clinical studies is warranted to optimize cancer treatment regimens and address the challenge of drug resistance in HCC. Furthermore, the combination of ferroptosis inducers may represent a promising strategy for tumor suppression across a diverse array of cancer types, such as colon cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, osteosarcoma, melanoma, cervical cancer, and glioma (Supplementary Figures S6 and S7). This combination therapy could potentially overcome drug resistance and enhance the effectiveness of ferroptosis induction, offering a novel and broadly applicable approach to cancer treatment.

Methods and materialsBioinformatics analysisThe genome-wide transcriptome data quantified as fragments per kilobase per million were downloaded from TCGA and log2-transformed with pseudo-count 1 added. We used the data from 18 cancer types including BLCA, BRCA, CHOL, COAD, ESCA, HNSC, KICH, KIRC, KIRP, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC, PAAD, PRAD, READ, STAD, THCA, and UCEC, all of which had profiled enough number of samples for both cancer and normal tissues. The mRNA expression levels of GPX4, FSP1, DHODH, and DHFR were compared between normal and cancer samples. The average expression levels in corresponding normal and cancer samples were depicted in a radar chart.Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis between IC50 of 481 drugs and gene expression of FSP1, GPX4, and DHODH was performed with data from CTRP. The P-value was adjusted by false discovery rate.Antibodies, plasmids, and chemicalsAntibodies against Flag (Shanghai Genomics), β-actin (Genescript), GPX4 (Abcam), FSP1 (Proteintech), S6K (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-S6K (Cell Signaling Technology), S6 (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-S6 (Cell Signaling Technology), Ki67(Cell Signaling Technology), and 4-HNE (Abcam) were purchased commercially. Full-length cDNAs of FSP1 and GPX4 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pBabe or pLVX (Addgene #1764, #125839). sgRNAs targeting GPX4 (CTTGGCGGAAAACTCGTGCA) and FSP1 (GGAGATGGGGTCCCAGGTCT) were cloned into pLentiCRISPRv2 (Addgene #78852). Temsirolimus (CSNpharm), everolimus (CSNpharm), tacrolimus (CSNpharm), RSL3 (Sigma), and ferrostatin-1 (Selleck) were purchased commercially.Cell culture, transfection, and stable cell line generationAll cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). GPX4-KO HT1080 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 100 nM Fer-1. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell transfection was carried out by Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells stably expressing Flag-FSP1 were generated by lentiviral infection. In brief, HEK293T cells were transfected with the packaging plasmids for 48 h. The supernatant containing lentiviruses was used to infect the indicated cells for 48 h. Cells transduced by viruses were selected with puromycin. The GPX4-KO and FSP1-KO cells were generated by infecting cells with virus expressing Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting the indicated genes.

Cells were re-suspended in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with protease inhibitor cocktail and then lyzed by repeatedly freezing and thawing for three times. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The cleared cell lysate was incubated at the indicated temperature for 3 min, followed by centrifuge at 15000 rpm for 60 min at 4°C. The supernatant was analyzed by western blotting.Lipid ROS assayCells were stained with C11-BODIPY 581/591 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, D3861) for 30 min at 37°C, harvested by trypsinization, and analyzed by flow cytometry (Accuri C6, BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10000 cells were analyzed for each sample.Western blottingProtein samples were boiled in the Laemmli sample buffer, separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked in 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight and secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Chemiluminescence was developed with Pierce™ ECL Plus Western Blotting substrate and pictures were taken by Typhoon FLA 9500 (Cytiva).PI stainingCells were seeded in 6-well plates with the indicated treatments. PI (Sigma-Aldrich, P4170) was added (50 μg/ml) and images were taken at the indicated time points by OLYMPUS IX81 inverted fluorescence microscope.Isothermal titration calorimetryPurified FSP1 protein and compounds (temsirolimus and everolimus) were solubilized in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 1% DMSO. During all measurements, the proteins (250 μM) were titrated with injections of compounds (25 μM) at a stirring speed of 750 rpm with 150-sec intervals. The isothermal titration calorimetry experiment was performed at 25°C with a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC200 (Malvern) and analyzed by MicroCal PEAQ-DSC.Protein purification and enzyme activity assays
Escherichia coli strain BL21 transformed with pET.M3C was cultured to late logarithmic phase in LB medium. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside to culture medium and incubated at 16°C overnight. Cells were lysed by sonication and recombinant His-FSP1 protein was purified by immobilized metal chelate chromatography by His-tag Purification Resin (Beyotime) following the manufacturer's instructions.To measure FSP1-catalyzed NADH oxidation in vitro, purified FSP1 protein was incubated with 500 μM NADH along with 5–50 μM temsirolimus, tacrolimus, or everolimus in 100 μl PBS. A reduction in absorbance at 340 nm, corresponding to NADH oxidation to NAD, was monitored in real time by a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader.Colony formation assayA total of 250 cells were inoculated into a 35-mm cell culture plate. Fresh medium containing different inhibitors was added every 3 days. After incubation for 1–2 weeks, cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma) and colony numbers were counted manually.Liver cancer xenograftAll mouse studies were approved and supervised by the Laboratory Animal Ethical Committee of Fudan University. Six-week-old male BALB/c nude mice were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Research Center, and 5 × 106 BEL-7404 cells were injected into the right flank of mice subcutaneously. A week after inoculation, the mice were divided randomly into four groups for drug treatment. RSL3 and temsirolimus were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in saline containing 5% Tween-80 (Sigma) and 5% polyethylene glycol 400 (Sigma) for administration in vivo. RSL3 (10 mg/kg) and temsirolimus (10 mg/kg) were delivered by intraperitoneal injection into mice at a volume of 100 μl once every 2 days. Tumor volume was measured every other day and calculated according to the equation: volume = 0.5 × length × width2. After 32 days of treatment, all mice were sacrificed and tumors were collected for histology analysis.Tissue histologyXenograft tumor samples were fixed overnight, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. For immunohistology, slides were stained with antibodies against Ki67 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:400) and 4-HNE (Abcam, 1:400), and color was developed by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The colorimetric TUNEL assay was carried out following the manufacturer's instruction (Beyotime). The staining intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (mild reaction), 2 (moderate reaction), or 3 (intense reaction). The percentage of positive cells was scored as: 0 (<1%), 1 (1%–10%), 2 (10%–50%), 3 (50%–80%), or 4 (>80%). The staining index was calculated by multiplying the intensity value by the percentage value of positively stained cells.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. All data shown represent the average from the indicated number of replicates with a standard deviation of the mean (mean ± SD). The P-values were calculated with two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test or one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's or Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test as indicated in corresponding figure legends. P < 0.05 was determined as statistically significant.

Tissue histologyXenograft tumor samples were fixed overnight, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. For immunohistology, slides were stained with antibodies against Ki67 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:400) and 4-HNE (Abcam, 1:400), and color was developed by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The colorimetric TUNEL assay was carried out following the manufacturer's instruction (Beyotime). The staining intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (mild reaction), 2 (moderate reaction), or 3 (intense reaction). The percentage of positive cells was scored as: 0 (<1%), 1 (1%–10%), 2 (10%–50%), 3 (50%–80%), or 4 (>80%). The staining index was calculated by multiplying the intensity value by the percentage value of positively stained cells.
