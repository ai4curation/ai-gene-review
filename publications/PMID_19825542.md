The gaseous phytohormone ethylene regulates many developmental processes and 
responses to environmental conditions in higher plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 
ethylene perception and initiation of signaling are mediated by a family of five 
receptors which are related to prokaryotic two-component sensor histidine 
kinases. The transient expression of fluorescence-tagged receptors in tobacco 
(Nicotiana benthamiana) epidermal leaf cells demonstrated that all ethylene 
receptors are targeted to the ER endomembrane network and do not localize to the 
plasmalemma. In support of in planta overlay studies, the ethylene receptors 
form homomeric and heteromeric protein complexes at the ER in living plant 
cells, as shown by membrane recruitment assays. A comparable in vivo interaction 
pattern was found in the yeast mating-based split-ubiquitin system. The 
overlapping but distinct expression pattern of the ethylene receptor genes 
suggests a differential composition of the ethylene receptor complexes in 
different plant tissues. Our findings may have crucial functional implications 
on the ethylene receptor-mediated efficiency of hormone perception, induction of 
signaling, signal attenuation and output.
