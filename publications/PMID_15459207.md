Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is known to function in cell 
survival in response to various stresses; however, the mechanism of cell 
survival by ERK1/2 remains poorly elucidated in ischemic heart. Here we applied 
functional proteomics by two-dimensional electrophoresis to identify a cellular 
target of ERK1/2 in response to ischemic hypoxia. Approximately 1500 spots were 
detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of a sample from unstimulated 
cells. The staining intensities of at least 50 spots increased at 6-h 
reoxygenation after 2-h ischemic hypoxia. Of the 50 spots that increased, at 
least 4 spots were inhibited in the presence of PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. A 
protein with a molecular mass of 52 kDa that is strongly induced by ERK1/2 
activation in response to ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation was identified as 
alpha-enolase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, by liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing. The expressions of 
the alpha-enolase mRNA and protein are inhibited during reoxygenation after 
ischemic hypoxia in the cells containing a dominant negative mutant of MEK1 and 
treated with a MEK inhibitor, PD98059, leading to a decrease in ATP levels. 
alpha-Enolase expression is also observed in rat heart subjected to 
ischemia-reperfusion. The induction of alpha-enolase by ERK1/2 appears to be 
mediated by c-Myc. The introduction of the alpha-enolase protein into the cells 
restores ATP levels and prevents cell death during ischemic hypoxia and 
reoxygenation in these cells. These results show that alpha-enolase expression 
by ERK1/2 participates in the production of ATP during reoxygenation after 
ischemic hypoxia, and a decrease in ATP induces apoptotic cell death. 
Furthermore, alpha-enolase improves the contractility of cardiomyocytes impaired 
by ischemic hypoxia. Our results reveal that ERK1/2 plays a role in the 
contractility of cardiomyocytes and cell survival through alpha-enolase 
expression during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation.
