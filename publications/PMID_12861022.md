We have cloned T-cell factor 4N (TCF-4N), an alternative isoform of TCF-4, from 
developing pituitary and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This protein contains the 
N-terminal interaction domain for beta-catenin but lacks the DNA binding domain. 
While TCF-4N inhibited coactivation by beta-catenin of a TCF/lymphoid-enhancing 
factor (LEF)-dependent promoter, TCF-4N potentiated coactivation by beta-catenin 
of several non-TCF/LEF-dependent promoters. For example, TCF-4N synergized with 
beta-catenin to activate the alpha-inhibin promoter through functional and 
physical interactions with the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 
(SF-1). In addition, TCF-4N and beta-catenin synergized with the adipogenic 
transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) to induce 
leptin promoter activity. The mechanism by which beta-catenin and TCF-4N 
coactivated C/EBPalpha appeared to involve p300, based upon synergy between 
these important transcriptional regulators. Consistent with TCF-4N's redirecting 
the actions of beta-catenin in cells, ectopic expression of TCF-4N in 3T3-L1 
preadipocytes partially relieved the block of adipogenesis caused by 
beta-catenin. Thus, we propose that TCF-4N inhibits coactivation by beta-catenin 
of TCF/LEF transcription factors and potentiates the coactivation by 
beta-catenin of other transcription factors, such as SF-1 and C/EBPalpha.

Abstract

We have cloned T-cell factor 4N (TCF-4N), an alternative isoform of TCF-4, from developing pituitary and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This protein contains the N-terminal interaction domain for β-catenin but lacks the DNA binding domain. While TCF-4N inhibited coactivation by β-catenin of a TCF/lymphoid-enhancing factor (LEF)-dependent promoter, TCF-4N potentiated coactivation by β-catenin of several non-TCF/LEF-dependent promoters. For example, TCF-4N synergized with β-catenin to activate the α-inhibin promoter through functional and physical interactions with the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). In addition, TCF-4N and β-catenin synergized with the adipogenic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) to induce leptin promoter activity. The mechanism by which β-catenin and TCF-4N coactivated C/EBPα appeared to involve p300, based upon synergy between these important transcriptional regulators. Consistent with TCF-4N′s redirecting the actions of β-catenin in cells, ectopic expression of TCF-4N in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes partially relieved the block of adipogenesis caused by β-catenin. Thus, we propose that TCF-4N inhibits coactivation by β-catenin of TCF/LEF transcription factors and potentiates the coactivation by β-catenin of other transcription factors, such as SF-1 and C/EBPα.

DISCUSSION

In this study we characterized the function of an alternatively spliced isoform of TCF-4, which we named TCF-4N because it contains the N terminus of the protein. TCF-4N has a translational stop site prior to the DNA binding domain, resulting in a stable protein that retains the ability to bind β-catenin (Fig. 1C ). TCF-4N inhibits the activation by β-catenin of TOPFLASH, a TCF-dependent promoter, similar to the well-established dominant negative TCF ΔNTCF-4E (Fig. 2 ). However, TCF-4N enhances the activation by β-catenin of TCF-independent promoters, such as the mutant cyclin D1 promoters (Fig. 3A ), the SF-1-dependent inhibin promoter (Fig. 4B ), the LexA-responsive promoter as activated by LexASF-1 (Fig. 4B ), the Gal4-responsive promoter as activated by Gal4-βCat or Gal4-C/EBPα (Fig. 3A and 5B ), and the C/EBPα-dependent leptin promoter (Fig. 5A ). The mechanism by which the β-catenin/TCF-4N complex coactivates C/EBPα appears to involve p300, based upon synergy between these important transcriptional regulators (Fig. 5 and 6 ). Finally, ectopic expression of TCF-4N in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes partially relieves the block of differentiation caused by β-catenin (Fig. 7A and B ). Thus, we propose that TCF-4N inhibits coactivation by β-catenin of TCF/LEF transcription factors and enhances the coactivation by β-catenin of other transcription factors, such as SF-1 (Fig. 4 ) and the adipogenic transcription factor C/EBPα (Fig. 7C ).

The ability of TCF-4N to partially relieve the inhibition of 3T3-L1 adipogenesis caused by β-catenin supports the evidence from reporter gene assays that TCF-4N potentiates coactivation by β-catenin of non-TCF/LEF transcription factors, including the positive regulator of adipogenesis C/EBPα (Fig. 5 ). Rescue of the inhibition of β-catenin by TCF-4N could potentially be due to inhibition of TCF/LEF-dependent transcription and/or activation of C/EBPα and other adipogenic transcription factors. Coactivation of C/EBPα by β-catenin is paradoxical, given the inhibitory effect of Wnt signaling and dominant-stable β-catenin on adipogenesis. Interestingly, nuclear β-catenin levels remained elevated for 3 days after induction of adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5C ), despite a decline in the Wnt10b and Frizzled receptors ( 1 ). Levels of the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ increased during this time and peaked 3 days after induction of differentiation. Since β-catenin declined after induction of many adipocyte markers and the accumulation of lipid, it appears that β-catenin has a more complex role during adipogenesis than the strictly antagonistic function predicted by its role in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

Studies that examined the structure of TCF/LEF transcription factors bound to β-catenin suggest that they bind as a heterodimer, with a 1:1 stoichiometry ( 7 , 30 ). As TCF-4N lacks the DNA binding domain and a putative nuclear localization signal, we postulated that TCF-4N could inhibit transcriptional coactivation by β-catenin by blocking interactions of β-catenin with DNA-bound TCF/LEF transcription factors. However, the mechanism by which TCF-4N enhances transcriptional coactivation by β-catenin of target genes is unknown. Protein levels of total exogenous β-catenin are unaltered by TCF-4N, suggesting that TCF-4N does not increase the stability of β-catenin (data not shown). β-Catenin has been reported to be tyrosine phosphorylated, which decreases its affinity for E-cadherin and increases its affinity for TATA binding protein ( 28 ); however, we saw no change in tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin when it was coexpressed with TCF-4N (data not shown). However, other important posttranslational modifications of β-catenin, such as sumoylation or acetylation, may be regulated by TCF-4N ( 17 , 47 ). Another possibility is that TCF-4N alters the cellular localization of β-catenin through regulation of the cytosolic/nuclear pool or the membrane-bound pool by an unknown mechanism. However, expression of TCF-4N does not appear to alter the localization of fluorescently tagged β-catenin (data not shown). Furthermore, the positive effect of TCF-4N on the activity of the Gal4-βCat fusion protein (Fig. 3B ) suggests that the effects of TCF-4N may not involve differences in subcellular localization, as Gal4-βCat is nuclear due to the Gal4 nuclear localization signal.

While the mechanism whereby TCF-4N potentiates transcriptional coactivation by β-catenin does not appear to involve regulation of β-catenin stability, tyrosine phosphorylation, or subcellular localization, the positive effect of TCF-4N on β-catenin may be through the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. It is well established that β-catenin physically and functionally interacts with p300 and CBP ( 10 , 24 , 43 ). TCF-4N may stabilize these interactions, because TCF-4N greatly increased the coactivation of C/EBPα by p300 and β-catenin (Fig. 6D ). Furthermore, TCF-4N may recruit additional coactivators to the complex that are not recruited by β-catenin or p300 alone.

While we identified and characterized TCF-4N as encoding the N terminus of TCF-4 in the mouse, we also identified by database searches a similar isoform of TCF-3 in cows. Strikingly, the alternative splice site and stop codon are completely conserved between mouse TCF-4N and bovine TCF-3. In addition, another group recently cloned a similarly truncated LEF-1 isoform in humans ( 18 ). In contrast to TCF-4N and the putative TCF-3N, which are alternatively spliced and truncated by insertion of a stop codon immediately after the exon junction ( 3 ), the novel LEF-1 isoform contains an alternative exon coding for a novel string of amino acids prior to a stop codon. Similar isoforms of LEF-1 in humans, TCF-4 in mice, and TCF-3 in cows suggest a conserved and important role for N-terminal isoforms in regulation of transcription. In this paper we have shown that TCF-4N inhibits TCF/LEF-dependent transcription and stimulates the coactivation by β-catenin and p300 of other transcription factors, including C/EBPα. The effects of TCF-4N on adipogenesis demonstrate its ability to influence cell growth and differentiation.
