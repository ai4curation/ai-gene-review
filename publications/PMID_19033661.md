dramatically enhanced angiogenesis in 2 models of inflammatory angiogenesis. In 
one of these models, the enhanced angiogenesis observed in the KO mice was

in KO mice and the enhanced retinal angiogenesis was markedly diminished by 
overexpression of AIP1. In vitro, VEGF-induced EC migration was inhibited by 
AIP1 overexpression, whereas it was augmented by both AIP1 knockout and 
knockdown, with the enhanced EC migration caused by AIP1 knockdown being 
associated with increased VEGFR2 signaling. We present mechanistic data that 
suggest AIP1 is recruited to the VEGFR2-PI3K complex, binding to both VEGFR2 and 
PI3K p85, at a late phase of the VEGF response, and that this leads to

Introduction

Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, is involved in many physiological and pathological settings such as ischemia, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer ( 1 ). The VEGFs and their receptors have been shown to be critical in regulating vessel formation in both normal physiological and pathological processes ( 2 ). VEGF primarily utilizes its receptor VEGFR2 (also known as Flk-1 or KDR) to induce angiogenic responses by activating a variety of signaling cascades, including activation of PI3K-Akt, PLC-γ–PKC, and MAPK ( 3 ). Given the critical role of VEGFR2 signaling in angiogenesis, regulation of VEGFR2 activity/activation may represent an important mechanism for the control of angiogenesis. Many secreted antiangiogenic factors, including vasohibin, function, at least in part, by modulating VEGF bioactivity or the binding to VEGFR2 ( 4 ). In contrast, proangiogenic factors can positively regulate VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling. Sphingosine-1 phosphate via its receptor S1P1, placental growth factor via its receptor VEGFR1, and laminar flow via Src can transactivate VEGFR2 ( 5 – 8 ). We have also shown that proinflammatory cytokine TNF via its receptor TNFR2 transactivates VEGFR2 ( 9 , 10 ). VEGFR2 activity is also regulated by direct interactions with other proteins, including co-receptor neuropilins ( 11 ), adhesion molecule vascular endothelial–cadherin (VE-cadherin) ( 12 ), and integrins ( 13 ). For example, VE-cadherin is in complex with VEGFR2 and is critical for VEGF-induced survival (PI3K-Akt) signaling ( 12 ). VE-cadherin–VEGFR2 also regulates EC permeability ( 14 , 15 ). Interestingly, a complex of VEGFR2, VE-cadherin, and PECAM-1 (CD31) has been shown to be a mechanosensor that functions upstream of integrin signaling and transduces shear stress-mediated angiogenesis and vascular remodeling ( 16 ). However, negative regulations of VEGFR2 by protein-protein interactions are less understood, and an endogenous inhibitor that directly binds to and modulates VEGFR2 activity has not been identified.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1–interacting (ASK1-interacting) protein-1 (AIP1), also known as DAB2-interacting protein (DAB2IP), a recently identified, novel member of the Ras GTPase-activating protein family, has been implicated in cell growth inhibition and cell apoptosis ( 17 , 18 ). AIP1, via its Ras GTPase-activating protein (Ras-GAP) activity, inhibits Ras-mediated cell survival signaling, causing cell growth inhibition ( 19 ). On the other hand, AIP1 functions as a positive regulator in cell apoptosis by mediating activation of the apoptotic kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) ( 18 ). Consistent with its role as an inhibitor of cell survival and growth, AIP1 expression is often downregulated in various human cancers ( 17 , 20 , 21 ). Promoter analyses indicate that an epigenetic mechanism regulates AIP1 transcription ( 17 ). Recently, it has been reported that genetic variation in AIP1 gene may predict the risk of aggressive prostate cancer based on single nucleotide polymorphism ( 22 , 23 ). Moreover, human AIP1 (alias for AFQ34) has been identified as a novel fusion partner from an acute myeloid leukemia patient with a t(9;11)(q34;q23) chromosomal translocation; the intron 9 of the MLL gene is translocated into the exon 2 of AIP1 and causes the disruption of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in the AIP1 protein and possible disruption of its functions in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis ( 24 ). These data suggest that AIP1 may function as a tumor suppressor gene.

However, the in vivo function of AIP1 has not been established. In order to define the in vivo function of AIP1, we created mice that were genetically deficient of the AIP1 gene. AIP1 is highly expressed in vascular ECs. However, AIP1-deficient mice (KO mice) show normal vascular development. We determined the function of AIP1 using several models of inflammatory angiogenesis. Our studies suggest that AIP1 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of adaptive angiogenesis, in part, by binding to the VEGFR2-PI3K complex and inhibiting the VEGFR2-dependent angiogenic signaling.

Discussion

In the present study, we show that KO mice exhibit dramatically enhanced ischemia and inflammatory angiogenesis in several in vivo models (ischemic hind limb and sponge granuloma models). Furthermore, VEGF-induced neovascularization is greatly augmented in KO mice, which can be suppressed by re-expression of AIP1. In cultured ECs, overexpression of AIP1 inhibits, while knockout or knockdown of AIP1 in ECs enhances, VEGF-induced migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies suggest that AIP1 is recruited to the VEGFR2-PI3K complex at a late phase of VEGF response. AIP1 via its C2 domain associates with VEGFR2 while via its PR domain binds to the SH3 domain of PI3K p85, leading to an inhibition of VEGFR2-mediated angiogenic signaling (Figure 8 C). Our in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that AIP1 functions as an endogenous scaffold in inflammatory angiogenesis by suppressing VEGFR2-Akt–dependent signaling.

The ischemic hind limb model was created to study peripheral arterial disease and has been extensively used to assess a role of a gene in adult arteriogenesis and angiogenesis. The model represents pathological settings, involving inflammation, cytokine/proangiogenic factors, and altered systemic/local blood flow ( 28 ). We first assessed the phenotype of KO mice in this model, in which KO mice showed impaired arteriogenesis and angiogenesis. We then determined the role of AIP1 in more “simplified” in vivo angiogenesis models, in which only limited components were involved. For example, inflammation (but not ischemia) is predominant in the sponge granuloma model ( 26 ). In contrast, less inflammation is involved in the ear and retina angiogenesis assay, in which a single proangiogenic factor could be applied. In these assays, we have shown that AIP1 specifically inhibits adenoviral-expressed VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the ear and retina angiogenesis assays. Moreover, recombinant VEGF-induced cornea angiogenesis is also augmented in KO mice.

Our study here demonstrates that AIP1 is dispensable in vascular development but suppresses VEGF-induced angiogenesis in adult tissues using these animal models. The mechanisms by which KO mice show normal development, birth, growth, and breeding compared with WT mice are not known. The close members of Ras-GAP family include p120RasGAP and nGAP (Ras protein activator-like 1). It has been reported that deletion of p120RasGAP in mice results in early embryonic lethality associated with defective vasculogenesis and increased apoptosis of neuronal cells, indicating the importance of this gene during vascular embryogenesis ( 32 ). Whether or not these Ras-GAP proteins compensate AIP1 function in KO mice needs further investigation. Previously, several genetically knockout mice that are developmentally “normal” have been used to test the genes in regulating postnatal angiogenesis and remodeling. The tested genes include the VEGF homolog placental growth factor ( 33 ) and Akt ( 34 , 35 ) among others. Embryonic angiogenesis in mice was not affected by the deficiency of these genes. However, loss of these genes impaired ischemic-induced angiogenesis. Our recent studies indicate that TNF receptor 2 ( TNFR2 ) and its downstream nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Bmx are additional members in this group of genes ( 10 , 25 ). In contrast, deletion of antiangiogenic genes augmented angiogenesis in these models. For example, deletion of thrombospondin-2, the secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein that functions as modulator of cell-matrix interactions, exhibits enhanced angiogenesis in a sponge granuloma model ( 27 ). Interestingly, KO mice show similar augmented angiogenic phenotype as TNFR1-KO mice as we described recently ( 25 ). This is consistent with our in vitro studies that AIP1 associates with TNFR1 and mediates TNFR1-induced activation of ASK1-JNK apoptotic signaling in ECs. Moreover, both KO and TNFR1-KO mice show enhanced VEGFR2 signaling. Given that TNF and VEGF are coexpressed in several inflammatory angiogenic settings. It is conceivable that both reduced ASK1-JNK apoptotic signaling and increased VEGFR2-PI3K-Akt–mediated survival and migratory pathways lead to augmented angiogenesis in KO mice. However, our recent data suggest that AIP1 specifically mediates the TNF and ER stress-induced, but not oxidative stress-induced, ASK1-JNK pathway in ECs ( 31 ). Consistent with this finding, we did not detect dramatic differences between WT and KO mice in ischemia-induced ASK1-JNK activities (Supplemental Figure 8). It is likely that AIP1 primarily targets the VEGFR2-PI3K pathway to regulate ischemia-mediated arteriogenesis and angiogenesis.

Therefore, the most important finding of our present study is that we identified AIP1 as an endogenous inhibitor of VEGFR2-mediated angiogenic signaling. Several positive regulators of VEGFR2 signaling have been reported, including co-receptor neuropilins, adhesion molecule VE-cadherin, and integrins. More recently, IQGAP, a Ras-GAP domain-containing protein, has been shown to interact with VEGFR2 and positively regulate VEGFR2 signaling ( 36 ). IQGAP1 was identified as a widely expressed IQ domain-containing protein, with a region containing sequence similarity to the Ras GTPase-activating proteins. However, subsequent in vitro analysis revealed that IQGAP1 actually binds to active GTP-bound Rac1 and inhibits Rac intrinsic GTPase activity, therefore increasing Rac1 activity ( 37 , 38 ). Thus, IQGAP, by activating Rac1, positively regulates VEGF-induced EC migration. Consistently, IQGAP is colocalized with phosphorylated VEGFR2 at the leading edge of migrating ECs ( 36 ). In contrast, AIP1 associates with VEGFR2 and inhibits VEGFR2 activity and the downstream signaling. It needs to be determined if AIP1 antagonizes IQGAP1 function in VEGF signaling. Previous in vitro studies suggest that AIP1 is a Ras-GAP, which promotes Ras intrinsic GTPase activity, promoting a turn off of Ras signaling ( 17 ). However, PLC-γ mediates activation of both PKC and ERK1/2 pathways in VEGFR2 signaling, contributing to EC proliferation. Thus, it has been proposed that VEGFR2 does not use the Ras pathway as a major downstream signaling pathway in the activation of ERK1/2 and DNA synthesis ( 2 , 39 , 40 ). Consistently, our data show that AIP1-PHC2 (deletion of the GAP1 domain) or AIP1-N-R289L (mutation at the catalytic site) can still bind to VEGFR2 and inhibit VEGFR2 activity (Figure 8 B), suggesting that the Ras-GAP activity of AIP1 is not required for its inhibitory effect on VEGFR2 signaling.

The exact mechanism by which AIP1 negatively regulates VEGFR2 activity needs further investigation. Nevertheless, our data support that AIP1 may directly bind to and inhibit VEGFR2 activity. Association of AIP1 with VEGFR2 is diminished by a VEGFR2-specific inhibitor, indicating that VEGFR2 signaling is required for the recruitment of AIP1. In contrast, AIP1-VEGFR2 as well as AIP1-PI3K and VEGFR2-PI3K complexes are strongly enhanced by a PI3K inhibitor. These results may support a model in which AIP1 retains VEGFR2-PI3K in an inactive state.

Negative regulation of VEGFR2 has been previously reported. VEGFR2 protein can be downregulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl–dependent ubiquitination and by PKC-dependent phosphorylation ( 41 , 42 ). Although VE-cadherin functions as a potential co-receptor of VEGFR2 ( 12 ), it has also been implicated in cell contact–dependent inhibition of EC growth through reduced sensitivity of VEGF signaling. Further studies suggest that VE-cadherin, by recruiting a high cell density–enhanced phosphatase (DEP-1) to the VEGFR2-VE-cadherin-catenin complex at cell-cell contacts, reduces VEGFR2 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 signaling ( 43 ). Similarly, a human low molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase (HCPTPA) has been shown to directly associate with VEGFR2, and overexpression of HCPTPA in HUVECs leads to suppression of VEGF-induced cellular responses, suggesting that VEGFR2 might be a direct substrate of these phosphatases ( 44 ). It needs to be determined if AIP1 may recruit c-Cbl or VEGFR2-specific phosphatase(s), turning off VEGFR2 signaling.

Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that AIP1 functions as an endogenous inhibitor in VEGFR2 signaling. Our study suggests that AIP1 may be a novel target for the treatment of vascular diseases such as coronary artery and peripheral arterial diseases.
