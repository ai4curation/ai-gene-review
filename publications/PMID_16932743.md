Although mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes have been well 
established to play important role in transcription, their role in DNA repair 
has remained largely unexplored. Here we show that inactivation of the SWI/SNF 
complexes and downregulation of the catalytic core subunits of the complexes 
both result in inefficient DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and increased 
DNA damage sensitivity as well as a large defect in H2AX phosphorylation 
(gamma-H2AX) and nuclear focus formation after DNA damage. The expression of 
most DSB repair genes remains unaffected and DNA damage checkpoints are grossly 
intact in the cells inactivated for the SWI/SNF complexes. Although the SWI/SNF 
complexes do not affect the expression of ATM, DNA-PK and ATR, or their 
activation and/or recruitment to DSBs, they rapidly bind to DSB-surrounding 
chromatin via interaction with gamma-H2AX in the manner that is dependent on the 
amount of DNA damage. Given the crucial role for gamma-H2AX in efficient DSB 
repair, these results suggest that the SWI/SNF complexes facilitate DSB repair, 
at least in part, by promoting H2AX phosphorylation by directly acting on 
chromatin.

Abstract

Although mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes have been well established to play important role in transcription, their role in DNA repair has remained largely unexplored. Here we show that inactivation of the SWI/SNF complexes and downregulation of the catalytic core subunits of the complexes both result in inefficient DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and increased DNA damage sensitivity as well as a large defect in H2AX phosphorylation (γ-H2AX) and nuclear focus formation after DNA damage. The expression of most DSB repair genes remains unaffected and DNA damage checkpoints are grossly intact in the cells inactivated for the SWI/SNF complexes. Although the SWI/SNF complexes do not affect the expression of ATM, DNA-PK and ATR, or their activation and/or recruitment to DSBs, they rapidly bind to DSB-surrounding chromatin via interaction with γ-H2AX in the manner that is dependent on the amount of DNA damage. Given the crucial role for γ-H2AX in efficient DSB repair, these results suggest that the SWI/SNF complexes facilitate DSB repair, at least in part, by promoting H2AX phosphorylation by directly acting on chromatin.

Introduction

Eukaryotic DNA is organized into nucleosomes and higher-order structure that presents obstacles to the access of cellular proteins to their natural chromatin substrates. The process of modulating chromatin structure therefore must constitute a pivotal step in the regulation of the nuclear processes such as DNA repair ( Kornberg and Lorch, 1999 ; Fyodorov and Kadonaga, 2001 ). One of two major mechanisms by which chromatin modulation is achieved involves reversible addition of an acetyl group to the lysine residues of the histones that comprise the nucleosomes. The other one is mediated by the family of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes that utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disrupt the histone–DNA interactions. While these two mechanisms have been well established to play crucial roles in the regulation of transcription ( Narlikar et al , 2002 ), their role in chromosomal DNA repair is just beginning to be elucidated ( Allard et al , 2004 ; Peterson and Cote, 2004 ; van Attikum and Gasser, 2005 ).

Double-strand breaks (DSBs) of chromosomal DNA, the most destructive form of DNA damage, can be generated by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), and also naturally occur during the nuclear processes such as DNA replication and V(D)J recombination. Unless accurately and efficiently repaired, DNA DSBs can result in chromosomal instability and cancer development ( Hoeijmakers, 2001 ; Jackson, 2002 ). Upon generation of DSBs, cells activate the pathways leading to DNA repair as well as propagate the signals for checkpoint activation to arrest the cell cycle until the repair is completed. The three phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-like kinases (PIKKs), ATM, ATR and DNA-PK, play a key role in initiating these intracellular signaling pathways of DSB responses ( Shiloh, 2003 ; Bakkenist and Kastan, 2004 ).

Immediately after DSB generation, histone H2AX is phosphorylated at Ser-139 at the conserved SQ motif on the C-terminal tail, and the three PIKKs are all responsible for this phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of H2AX (termed γ-H2AX) occurs specifically at the DSB-surrounding chromatin encompassing hundreds of thousands of base pairs, resulting in organization into a poorly understood subnuclear chromosomal structure which can be visualized by immunostaining, termed as IR-induced nuclear foci (IRIF) or frequently referred to as repair foci. γ-H2AX is thought to serve as binding sites for repair and checkpoint proteins such as Nbs1 as well as to influence chromatin structure in such a way that DNA repair events are facilitated ( Bassing and Alt, 2004 ; Fernandez-Capetillo et al , 2004 ). Studies using H2AX-deleted cells demonstrated that γ-H2AX is crucial for efficient repair of chromosomal DSBs and hence the maintenance of genome integrity ( Downs et al , 2000 ; Bassing et al , 2002 , 2003 ; Celeste et al , 2002 , 2003a ).

Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes, belonging to the family of swi2/snf2-based ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, are capable of facilitating alterations of nucleosome structure to control the accessibility of chromatin substrates. The SWI/SNF complexes consist of at least eight subunits containing either BRG-1 or Brm as the catalytic core subunits with ATPase activity. It has been well established that the SWI/SNF complexes play an important role in transcription both in reconstituted in vitro system and within the cells ( Narlikar et al , 2002 ). Studies also have implicated the SWI/SNF complexes in DNA processes other than transcription such as DNA replication ( Flanagan and Peterson, 1999 ), V(D)J recombination ( Kwon et al , 2000 ) and viral integration ( Yung et al , 2001 ). In vitro studies have shown that yeast SWI/SNF complex can stimulate the nucleotide excision repair on reconstituted nucleosomal substrates ( Hara and Sancar, 2002 ; Gaillard et al , 2003 ). However, the in vivo function of the SWI/SNF complexes in DNA repair has remained elusive. Here, we report a role for the mammalian SWI/SNF complexes in H2AX phosphorylation, DSB repair and cell survival after DNA damage.

Inactivation of the SWI/SNF complexes results in increased DNA damage sensitivity and decreased DSB repair

To investigate a potential role for the mammalian SWI/SNF complexes in DNA repair, we initially employed the NIH-3T3 cells, named B05-1, in which the SWI/SNF complexes can be conditionally inactivated by the expression of ATPase-defective dominant negative versions of BRG-1 under the control of tet-off system ( de la Serna et al , 2000 ). Cells were cultured under the conditions with (as control) or without tetracycline (to induce the flag-tagged dominant negative BRG-1) for 4 days before being subjected to the experiments described below, and, for the sake of convenience, we often denote such cells as B05-1(+tet) and B05-1(−tet), respectively.

In the first, we examined the effects of SWI/SNF inactivation on cell viability after DNA damage by colony formation assays. As expected, the expression of flag-tagged proteins was nicely induced by tetracycline depletion from B05-1 cells but not from tet-VP16 cells, the control NIH-3T3 cells expressing no flag-tagged proteins ( de la Serna et al , 2000 ) ( Figure 1A , top). When we exposed these cells to IR, we found that the viability of B05-1(−tet) cells was markedly decreased compared to B05-1(+tet) cells, whereas tet-VP16 cells showed the similar levels of viability regardless of tetracycline depletion ( Figure 1A , bottom), indicating that the SWI/SNF complexes are important for cell survival after DNA damage. The cellular levels of flag-BRG-1 were not affected by irradiation (data not shown). It should be noted that SWI/SNF inactivation reduces clonogenic ability even in undamaged cells (data not shown), suggesting that the SWI/SNF complexes are important for maintaining cell health.

We then asked whether the SWI/SNF complexes are involved in DNA repair. We performed single-cell electrophoresis analysis under the neutral conditions (neutral comet assay) that specifically measures DNA DSBs. Immediately after irradiation (0 h) by 5, 10 and 25 Gy, approximately the same amounts of DNA fragments were generated from B05-1(+tet) and B05-1(−tet) cells at each dose ( Figure 1B and C , and data not shown). When remaining unrepaired DNA fragments were monitored at various hours after irradiation, B05-1(−tet) cells exhibited significantly lower repair efficiency than B05-1(+tet) cells for all three doses tested, whereas tet-VP16 cells showed the same repair efficiency regardless of tetracycline depletion ( Figure 1B and C ). These results show that the SWI/SNF complexes are required for efficient DBS repair as well as cell survival after DNA damage.

Downregulation of BRG-1 and hBrm results inγ-H2AX defect, inefficient DSB repair and increased DNA damage sensitivity

To further demonstrate specifically the role of the SWI/SNF complexes in γ-H2AX induction and DSB repair, we used small interference RNA (siRNA) approaches. When BRG-1 and human Brm (hBrm), the catalytic core subunits of the human SWI/SNF complexes, were downregulated by cotransfecting HeLa cells with the corresponding siRNAs, both H2AX phosphorylation ( Figure 4A and 4B ) and γ-H2AX focus formation ( Figure 4C ) following DNA damage were largely compromised. The cells downregulated for BRG-1 and hBrm also showed increased DNA damage sensitivity ( Figure 4D ) and decreased DSB repair ( Figure 4E ). These results, confirming the data from the dominant negative experiments, demonstrate that the SWI/SNF complexes are specifically responsible for the optimal induction of γ-H2AX, efficient DSB repair and cell survival after DNA damage. It is noted that, as individual knockdown of either BRG-1 or hBrm appears to influence each other in their cellular levels (HL and JK, unpublished observations), we currently do not understand what relative extent to which each subunit would contribute to these functions.

Discussion

In the present study, we reveal the role for the mammalian SWI/SNF complexes in DSB repair and cell survival after DNA damage. Inactivation of the SWI/SNF complexes and downregulation of their catalytic subunits both results in inefficient DBS repair and increased DNA damage sensitivity, with DNA damage checkpoint grossly intact and the expression of most DSB repair genes largely unaffected. We find that the SWI/SNF complexes are critical for the phosphorylation of H2AX and the formation of γ-H2AX foci following DNA damage. Given the crucial role for γ-H2AX in chromosomal DSB repair and cell survival after DNA damage, these results suggest that the SWI/SNF complexes facilitate DSB repair and hence increase the resistance to DNA damage, at least in part, by promoting γ-H2AX induction. Our data, showing that BRG-1/Brm bind to DSB-surrounding chromatin via interaction with γ-H2AX, suggest that the SWI/SNF complexes directly act on the chromatin to facilitate the phosphorylation of H2AX. These results provide the first example, to our knowledge, for direct implication of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in DNA repair in mammalian cells.

Our findings have raised a number of interesting questions to be addressed. Most importantly, whether the SWI/SNF complexes and γ-H2AX function in a common pathway of DSB repair, in other words, whether the SWI/SNF complexes facilitate DSB repair mainly through the γ-H2AX pathway remains to be investigated. Therefore, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the SWI/SNF complexes also contribute to DSB repair by regulating the expression of yet unidentified DSB repair genes. For the same reason, it is also possible that the SWI/SNF complexes contribute to DSB repair in parallel by altering the chromatin structure surrounding the DNA lesion in such a way that subsequent repair events are facilitated. In raising this possibility, the SWI/SNF complexes appear to remain associated with chromatin for an extended period of time after reaching the maximum levels of binding at 2 h after irradiation ( Figure 6B ). We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the DNA damage-induced chromatin binding of the SWI/SNF complexes as well as its functional significance in the γ-H2AX induction and DSB repair.

How might the SWI/SNF complexes promote the phosphorylation of H2AX following DNA damage? Our results support direct mechanisms for this process. In the first, the data clearly excluded the possibilities that the SWI/SNF complexes promote H2AX phosphorylation indirectly by regulating gene expression or affecting the upstream kinase pathways. The SWI/SNF complexes do not affect the expression of H2AX itself ( Figures 3B and 4A ) or the expression of the kinases, ATM, DNA-PKcs and ATR, which are all responsible for the phosphorylation of H2AX ( Figure 5A ). In addition, ATM, the major player for H2AX phosphorylation after IR ( Burma et al , 2001 ; Fernandez-Capetillo et al , 2002 ), can be fully activated and normally recruited to DSB sites in SWI/SNF-defective cells following exposure to IR ( Figure 5B–F ). Moreover, the other two kinases are also properly recruited to DSB sites in irradiated SWI/SNF-defective cells ( Figure 5G and H ). Second, the detergent extraction experiments show that the SWI/SNF complexes rapidly bind to chromatin in response to IR in the manner such that the levels of their binding are proportional to the amount of DNA damage ( Figure 6A–C ). In addition, these experiments also show that the SWI/SNF complexes specifically bind to the chromatin at the sites of γ-H2AX foci ( Figure 6D ). Finally, the ChIP experiments demonstrated that the SWI/SNF complexes specifically interact with γ-H2AX ( Figure 6E–G ). All these data strongly suggest that the SWI/SNF complexes directly act on the chromatin to facilitate H2AX phosphorylation. Alterations of the structure of individual nucleosomes by SWI/SNF remodeling could directly affect the accessibility of H2AX at the sites of DSBs. In support of this possibility, it has been shown that DNA-PK-mediated H2AX phosphorylation in the context of nucleosomal structure can be modulated by histone acetylation, an important mechanism to regulate the accessibility of nucleosomes ( Park et al , 2003 ). Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, the SWI/SNF complexes might facilitate H2AX phosphorylation by influencing the higher order chromatin structure in such a way as to increase the accessibility of the H2AX-containing nucleosomes.

Recent studies showed that several members of the SWI2/SNF2 superfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are directly implicated in DSB repair in yeast. Using the system that permits generation of a single DSB at a defined chromosomal locus, the INO80 complex have been shown to be recruited to the DSB site by specifically interacting with γ-H2AX ( Downs et al , 2004 ; Morrison et al , 2004 ; van Attikum et al , 2004 ). Similarly, the yeast SWI/SNF and related RSC complexes have been shown to be recruited to the DSB site by unknown mechanisms and by the mechanisms involving the repair proteins such as Mre11 and yKu70, respectively ( Chai et al , 2005 ; Shim et al , 2005 ). Our work shows that mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are also implicated in DBS repair, emphasizing the evolutionally conserved functions of this family of chromatin remodeling complexes in DNA repair. Interestingly, however, these results also suggest that different members of the family may adopt distinct mechanisms for facilitating DSB repair. The INO80 complex, albeit it interacts with γ-H2AX, is not required for the induction of γ-H2AX following DNA damage ( Morrison et al , 2004 ), whereas mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are critical for the optimal induction of γ-H2AX (this report). Therefore, it is tempting to propose that the SWI/SNF complexes can function upstream of γ-H2AX, whereas the INO80 complex rather contribute to the downstream repair events. Indeed, a recent work showed that the INO80 complex, after being recruited to a DSB, disrupts the nucleosome structure around the DSB in the manner such that the broken DNA becomes accessible to repair proteins ( Tsukuda et al , 2005 ). In this respect, it is of great interest to ask whether yeast SWI/SNF complex would promote γ-H2AX induction, and whether mammalian INO80 complex binds to γ-H2AX but is dispensable for its induction.

Increasing evidence suggests that the SWI/SNF complexes function as a tumor suppressor ( Roberts and Orkin, 2004 ). Most of the experimental evidence supporting the tumor suppressor function of the SWI/SNF complexes relies on their activities to regulate the expression of the genes involved in cell cycle and proliferation. In this report, we show that the SWI/SNF complexes can function as a positive regulator of γ-H2AX which has recently been defined as a haploinsufficiency tumor suppressor ( Bassing et al , 2003 ; Celeste et al , 2003a ). Our findings therefore provide an important insight into the understanding of the tumor suppressor function of these evolutionally conserved ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes in the context of the function in the chromosomal DSB repair as well as their well-established role for transcription.
