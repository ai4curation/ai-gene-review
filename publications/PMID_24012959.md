Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) is a scaffold protein known to 
interact with a number of cancer-related proteins. nherf1 Mutations (K172N and 
D301V) were recently identified in breast cancer cells. To investigate the 
functional properties of NHERF1, wild-type and cancer-derived nherf1 mutations 
were stably expressed in SKMES-1 cells respectively. NHERF1-wt overexpression 
suppressed the cellular malignant phenotypes, including proliferation, 
migration, and invasion. nherf1 Mutations (K172N and D301V) caused complete or 
partial loss of NHERF1 functions by affecting the PTEN/NHERF1/PDGFRβ complex 
formation, inactivating NHERF1 inhibition of PDGF-induced AKT and ERK 
activation, and attenuating the tumor-suppressor effects of NHERF1-wt. These 
results further demonstrated the functional consequences of breast 
cancer-derived nherf1 mutations (K172N and D301V), and suggested the causal role 
of NHERF1 in tumor development and progression.
