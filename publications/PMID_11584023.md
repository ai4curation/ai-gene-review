Mammalian homologues of DnaJ proteins, also known as Hsp40 proteins, are 
co-chaperonins that complement Hsp70 chaperone function. Using the yeast 
two-hybrid system, we cloned an apolipoprotein (apo) B mRNA editing 
complementation protein, called apobec-1-binding protein-2 (ABBP-2), and found 
that it is a Class II DnaJ homologue. ABBP-2 binds to apobec-1, the mammalian 
apoB mRNA editase, via its J domain and neighboring G/F domain. It is a 
ubiquitously expressed protein, and, by transfection analysis of GFP-ABBP-2, we 
found that the protein is located in both the nucleus and cytosol of transfected 
cells, with predominance in the nucleus. Down-regulation of ABBP-2 expression in 
cultured cells inhibits endogenous apobec-1-mediated apoB mRNA editing. Like 
other Hsp40 proteins, ABBP-2 binds to Hsp70 and has ATPase-stimulating activity. 
Apobec-1-mediated apoB mRNA editing activity of in vitro tissue extracts 
requires the presence of Hsp70/ABBP-2. Although exogenously added ATP is not 
required for editing activity, removal of the endogenous ATP present in these 
extracts, which disrupts ABBP-2-Hsp70 interaction, completely inhibits editing. 
ABBP-2 differs from previously described auxiliary proteins (ABBP-1, ACF, and 
GRY-RBP) in that it does not contain any RNA recognition motifs. Not only is 
ABBP-2 required for efficient apoB mRNA editing, this newly discovered 
apobec-1-binding protein may help determine the subcellular distribution and 
trafficking of apobec-1 via its interaction with the chaperonin Hsp70.
