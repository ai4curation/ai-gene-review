Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes dsRNA generated during viral infection 
and activation of TLR3 results in induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and 
cellular anti-viral response. TLR3 is associated with a TIR domain-containing 
adapter protein TRIF, which activates distinct downstream pathways leading to 
activation of NF-kappaB and ISRE sites in the promoters of type I IFNs. We show 
here that A20, a NF-kappaB-inducible zinc finger protein that has been 
demonstrated to be an inhibitor of TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation and a 
physiological suppressor of inflammatory response, potently inhibited TLR3- and 
Sendai virus-mediated activation of ISRE and NF-kappaB and IFN-beta promoter in 
reporter gene assays. A20 also inhibited TRIF-, but not its downstream signaling 
components TBK1-, IKKbeta-, and IKKepsilon-mediated activation of ISRE and 
NF-kappaB and IFN-beta promoter. Moreover, A20 interacted with TRIF in 
co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Finally, expression of A20 could be induced 
at protein level by Sendai virus infection. These data suggest that A20 targets 
TRIF to inhibit TLR3-mediated induction of IFN-beta transcription and functions 
as a feedback negative regulator for TLR3 signaling and cellular anti-viral 
response.
