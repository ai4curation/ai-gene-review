Tapasin plays an important role in the quality control of major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I assembly, but its precise function in 
this process remains controversial. Whether tapasin participates in the assembly 
of HLA-G has not been studied. HLA-G, an MHC class Ib molecule that binds a more 
restricted set of peptides than class Ia molecules, is a particularly 
interesting molecule, because during assembly, it recycles between the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the cis-Golgi until it is loaded with a high 
affinity peptide. We have taken advantage of this unusual trafficking property 
of HLA-G and its requirement for high affinity peptides to demonstrate that a 
critical function of tapasin is to transform class I molecules into a high 
affinity, peptide-receptive form. In the absence of tapasin, HLA-G molecules 
cannot bind high affinity peptides, and an abundant supply of peptides cannot 
overcome the tapasin requirement for high affinity peptide loading. The addition 
of tapasin renders HLA-G molecules capable of loading high affinity peptides and 
of transporting to the surface, suggesting that tapasin is a prerequisite for 
the binding of high-affinity ligands. Interestingly, the "tapasin-dependent" 
HLA-G molecules are not empty in the absence of tapasin but are in fact 
associated with suboptimal peptides and continue to recycle between the ER and 
the cis-Golgi. Together with the finding that empty HLA-G heterodimers are 
strictly retained in the ER and degraded, our data suggest that MHC class I 
molecules bind any available peptides to avoid ER-mediated degradation and that 
the peptides are in turn replaced by higher affinity peptides with the aid of 
tapasin.
