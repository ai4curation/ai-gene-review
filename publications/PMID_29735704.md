Recently identified Parkinson's disease (PD) genes involved in synaptic vesicle 
endocytosis, such as DNAJC6 (auxilin), have further implicated synaptic 
dysfunction in PD pathogenesis. However, how synaptic dysfunction contributes to 
the vulnerability of human dopaminergic neurons has not been previously 
explored. Here, we demonstrate that commonly mutated, PD-linked leucine-rich 
repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mediates the phosphorylation of auxilin in its 
clathrin-binding domain at Ser627. Kinase activity-dependent LRRK2 
phosphorylation of auxilin led to differential clathrin binding, resulting in 
disrupted synaptic vesicle endocytosis and decreased synaptic vesicle density in 
LRRK2 patient-derived dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, impaired synaptic vesicle 
endocytosis contributed to the accumulation of oxidized dopamine that in turn 
mediated pathogenic effects such as decreased glucocerebrosidase activity and 
increased α-synuclein in mutant LRRK2 neurons. Importantly, these pathogenic 
phenotypes were partially attenuated by restoring auxilin function in mutant 
LRRK2 dopaminergic neurons. Together, this work suggests that mutant LRRK2 
disrupts synaptic vesicle endocytosis, leading to altered dopamine metabolism 
and dopamine-mediated toxic effects in patient-derived dopaminergic neurons.
