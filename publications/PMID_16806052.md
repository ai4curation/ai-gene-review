The yeast orthologue of mammalian TCTP is here proposed to be named Mmi1p 
(microtubule and mitochondria interacting protein). This protein displays about 
50% amino acid sequence identity with its most distantly related orthologs in 
higher organisms and therefore probably belongs to a small class of yeast 
proteins which have housekeeping but so far incompletely known functions needed 
for every eukaryotic cell. Previous investigations of the protein in both higher 
cells and yeast revealed that it is highly expressed during active growth, but 
transcriptionally down-regulated in several kinds of stress situations including 
starvation stress. In human cells, TCTP presumably has anti-apoptotic functions 
as it binds to Bcl-XL in vivo. TCTP of higher cells was also shown to interact 
with the translational machinery. It has acquired an additional function in the 
mammalian immune system, as it is identical with the histamine releasing factor. 
Here, we show that in S. cerevisiae induction of apoptosis by mild oxidative 
stress, replicative ageing or mutation of cdc48 leads to translocation of Mmi1p 
from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria. Mmi1p is stably but reversibly attached 
to the outer surface of the mitochondria and can be removed by digestion with 
proteinase K. Glutathionylation of Mmi1p, which is also induced by oxidants, is 
not a prerequisite or signal for translocation as shown by replacing the only 
cysteine of Mmi1p by serine. Mmi1p probably interacts with yeast microtubules as 
deletion of the gene confers sensitivity to benomyl. Conversely, the deletion 
mutant displays resistance to hydrogen peroxide stress and shows a small but 
significant elongation of the mother cell-specific lifespan. Our results so far 
indicate that Mmi1p is one of the few proteins establishing a functional link 
between microtubules and mitochondria which may be needed for correct 
localization of mitochondria during cell division.
