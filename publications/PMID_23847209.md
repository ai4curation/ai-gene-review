Serine/threonine/tyrosine-interacting protein (STYX) is a catalytically inactive 
member of the dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) family. Whereas the role of 
DUSPs in cellular signaling is well explored, the function of STYX is still 
unknown. Here, we identify STYX as a spatial regulator of ERK signaling. We used 
predictive-model simulation to test several hypotheses for possible modes of 
STYX action. We show that STYX localizes to the nucleus, competes with nuclear 
DUSP4 for binding to ERK, and acts as a nuclear anchor that regulates ERK 
nuclear export. Depletion of STYX increases ERK activity in both cytosol and 
nucleus. Importantly, depletion of STYX causes an ERK-dependent fragmentation of 
the Golgi apparatus and inhibits Golgi polarization and directional cell 
migration. Finally, we show that overexpression of STYX reduces ERK1/2 
activation, thereby blocking PC12 cell differentiation. Overall, our results 
identify STYX as an important regulator of ERK1/2 signaling critical for cell 
migration and PC12 cell differentiation.

Importantly, depletion of STYX causes an ERK-dependent fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus and inhibits Golgi polarization and directional cell migration. Finally, we show that overexpression of STYX reduces ERK1/2 activation, thereby blocking PC12 cell differentiation. Overall, our results identify STYX as an important regulator of ERK1/2 signaling critical for cell migration and PC12 cell differentiation.

Discussion

In the current work, we identify the pseudophosphatase STYX as a regulator of ERK signaling. Owing to its importance in regulating cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell-fate decisions, understanding the regulation of ERK signaling in time and space is central for the design of novel therapeutic strategies against human pathologies. For instance, directional cell migration is thought to constitute the cellular basis for invasion and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells, which accounts for 90% of cancer-associated mortality ( 21 ). Our work shows that STYX regulates ERK signaling, which translates into the modulation of cell migration and cell-fate decisions.

It has long been unclear whether and how pseudophosphatase members of the DUSP family are linked to MAPK signaling. For instance DUSP24 (also known as MK-STYX) has been shown to regulate apoptosis and to inhibit stress granule formation, but no role in the regulation of MAPK signaling has been described. Here, we show that STYX acts as a nuclear anchor for ERK, effectively slowing its nuclear export. In the absence of STYX, ERK leaves the nucleus with faster dynamics, which permits reactivation of ERK in the cytosol, thus causing increased cytoplasmic and nuclear ERK activities. This interpretation is supported by our computational modeling. In contrast to other feasible models of STYX actions, a model in which STYX acts as a nuclear anchor faithfully predicted all our experimental findings. The concept that an inactive phosphatase might act as an anchor for ERK has been proposed when it was shown that an artificially inactivated version of the nuclear DUSP5 may function as a nuclear anchor for ERK ( 22 ). Here, we identify STYX as a naturally occurring dead phosphatase that acts as a nuclear anchor.

Both our computational-modeling and our experimental results indicate that STYX competes with nuclear DUSP4 for binding to ERK and that this competition is part of the mode of action of STYX. It was recently shown that Mxi2 also acts as a competitor of nuclear DUSPs, thereby preventing ERK dephosphorylation ( 23 ). The effects of STYX and Mxi2 on ERK signaling are totally different, despite that they both compete with nuclear DUSPs for binding to ERK. Overexpression of Mxi2 increases ERK signaling, and the depletion of Mxi2 seems to decrease ERK signaling. Exactly the opposite is observed for STYX (its overexpression inhibits and its depletion increases ERK signaling). Another difference is that Mxi2 seems to specifically regulate nuclear ERK activity, whereas STYX affects both cytosolic and nuclear ERK activities. Possible reasons for the difference between Mxi2 and STYX are the fact that Mxi2 promotes entry of active ERK to the nucleus ( 23 , 24 ), whereas we have no evidence that STYX exerts direct effects on the ERK transport. Depletion of a nuclear importer of active ERK is predicted to decrease the amount of nuclear ppERK (model 4). Thus, it is likely that the difference between STYX and Mix2 is that the latter promotes the nuclear entry of ERK. Moreover, STYX binds both to nonphosphorylated ERK and ppERK, and our modeling indicates that this fact is important to explain the experimental findings. It is unclear whether Mxi2 exhibits any preference toward different phosphorylation forms of ERK. However, a strong difference in the binding to phosphorylated vs. nonphosphorylated ERK could potentially also account for the difference between STYX and Mxi2.

Our data strongly suggest that STYX depletion affects Golgi structure via increased ERK signaling. It has been previously shown that ERK phosphorylated the Golgi matrix protein GRASP65, thereby allowing the Golgi to reorient toward the leading edge in migrating cells. Phosphorylation of GRASP65 was shown to result in unlinking from other Golgi matrix proteins, which results in structural rearrangements of the Golgi ( 25 ). Therefore, interphase ERK signaling is capable of phosphorylating the Golgi in addition to the ERK1c form that was shown to phosphorylate the Golgi as part of mitotic disassembly of the Golgi ( 26 ). Further evidence that hyperactive ERK in interphase cells favors fragmentation of the Golgi was provided recently by showing that DUSP6 knockdown, which hyperactivates ERK ( 27 ), results in Golgi fragmentation, which could be rescued by pharmacologically inhibiting ERK ( 28 ).

Typically, an increase of ERK activity is considered to support tumorigenesis. However, our finding places STYX as a potential therapeutic target, because the fragmentation of the Golgi would inhibit directional cell migration and invasion and, thereby, render cancer cells less capable of invasion and metastatic spreading. A further link between STYX and cancer may also be inferred from its crosstalk with DUSP4. Recent studies showed that DUSP4 can have both detrimental and beneficial effects. On the one hand, increased DUSP4 expression was found to be increased in colorectal cancer specimens with high frequency of microsatellite instability, indicating poor survival rates ( 29 ). On the other hand, DUSP4 deficiency in breast cancer patients attenuated their response to chemotherapy ( 30 ). Taking the crosstalk with STYX into account might help to explain these apparently opposing DUSP4 effects. In any case, we propose that understanding the STYX-ERK-DUSP4 crosstalk is critical for fully understanding the impact of dysregulated ERK signaling on human pathologies.
