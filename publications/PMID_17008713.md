Lymphocyte Antigen 6 (Ly-6) superfamily members are cysteine-rich, generally 
GPI-anchored cell surface proteins, which have definite or putative immune 
related roles. There are 27 members of this family described so far in the human 
genome and 37 in the mouse. Five of them are clustered in the class III region 
of the human and mouse MHCs. Following computational analyses, we functionally 
characterized the encoded proteins by creating epitope-tagged fusion constructs 
to determine molecular weight, complex formation, subcellular localization, 
post-translational modifications and ligand binding. We found that all human and 
mouse proteins were glycosylated, and most could form part of larger complexes. 
Human and mouse Ly6G6c and Ly6G6d, and mouse Ly6g6e were found to be 
GPI-anchored cell surface proteins, highly expressed at the leading edges of 
cells, on filopodia, which are normally involved in cell adhesion and migration. 
However, analysis of Ly6G5c and Ly6G5b indicated that they are potentially 
secreted proteins. Our results indicate that there are two subclusters of 
related Ly-6 proteins in this region of the MHC, with Ly6G6c, Ly6G6d, and Ly6G6e 
forming one and Ly6G5c and Ly6G5b forming another. In addition, by FACS analysis 
we have found that the potential ligands for human LY6G6C, LY6G6D, and LY6G5C 
are expressed on K562 cells, an undifferentiated megakaryocyte cell line, 
indicating a potential role in hematopoietic cell differentiation. This 
characterization of the five MHC class III region Ly-6 family members is of 
great relevance, as they represent 18% of the human Ly-6 protein family and 50% 
of the secreted ones.
