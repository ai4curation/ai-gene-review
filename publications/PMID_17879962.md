Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an extracellular matrix protein that modulates focal 
adhesion in mammalian cells and exhibits dual roles in angiogenesis. In a 
previous work, we showed that a recombinant 18 kDa protein encompassing the 
N-terminal residues 1-174 of human TSP-1 (TSP18) induced tubulogenesis of human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells and protected them from apoptosis. Our results 
indicated that these effects were possibly mediated by syndecan-4 proteoglycan, 
since binding of TSP18 to endothelial extracts was inhibited by anti-syndecan-4 
antibody. Syndecan-4 is a heparan-sulfate proteoglycan that regulates 
cell-matrix interactions and is the only member of its family present in focal 
adhesions. In this report, we demonstrate that a monoclonal antibody against 
syndecan-4 blocks TSP18-induced tubulogenesis. Furthermore, through 2D adhesion 
and 3D angiogenic assays, we demonstrate that two sequences, TSP Hep I and II, 
retain the major pro-angiogenic activity of TSP18. These TSP-1 motifs also 
compete with the fibronectin Hep II domain for binding to syndecan-4 on 
endothelial cell surface, indicating that they may exert their effects by 
interfering with the recognition of fibronectin by syndecan-4. Additionally, 
TSP18 and its derived peptides activate the PKC-dependent Akt-PKB signaling 
pathway. Blockage of PKC activation prevented HUVEC spreading when seeded on 
TSP18 fragment, and on TSP Hep I and TSP Hep II peptides, but not on 
gelatin-coated substrates. Our results identify syndecan-4 as a novel receptor 
for the N-terminus of TSP-1 and suggest that TSP-1 N-terminal pro-angiogenic 
activity is linked to its capacity of interfering with syndecan-4 functions in 
the course of cell adhesion.
