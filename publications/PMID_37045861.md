RAF kinases play major roles in cancer. BRAFV600E mutants drive ~6% of human 
cancers. Potent kinase inhibitors exist but show variable effects in different 
cancer types, sometimes even inducing paradoxical RAF kinase activation. Both 
paradoxical activation and drug resistance are frequently due to enhanced 
dimerization between RAF1 and BRAF, which maintains or restores the activity of 
the downstream MEK-ERK pathway. Here, using quantitative proteomics we mapped 
the interactomes of RAF1 monomers, RAF1-BRAF and RAF1-BRAFV600E dimers 
identifying and quantifying >1,000 proteins. In addition, we examined the 
effects of vemurafenib and sorafenib, two different types of clinically used RAF 
inhibitors. Using regression analysis to compare different conditions we found a 
large overlapping core interactome but also distinct condition specific 
differences. Given that RAF proteins have kinase independent functions such 
dynamic interactome changes could contribute to their functional 
diversification. Analysing this dataset may provide a deeper understanding of 
RAF signalling and mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibitors.
