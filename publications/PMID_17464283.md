Spinophilin (SPL) and neurabin (NRB) are structurally similar scaffolding 
proteins with several protein binding modules, including actin and PP1 binding 
motifs and PDZ and coiled-coil domains. SPL also binds regulators of G protein 
signaling (RGS) proteins and the third intracellular loop (3iL) of G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to reduce the intensity of Ca(2+) signaling by 
GPCRs. The role of NRB in Ca(2+) signaling is not known. In the present work, we 
used biochemical and functional assays in model systems and in SPL(-/-) and 
NRB(-/-) mice to show that SPL and NRB reciprocally regulate Ca(2+) signaling by 
GPCRs. Thus, SPL and NRB bind all members of the R4 subfamily of RGS proteins 
tested (RGS1, RGS2, RGS4, RGS16) and GAIP. By contract, SPL, but not NRB, binds 
the 3iL of the GPCRs alpha(1B)-adrenergic (alpha(1B)AR), dopamine, CCKA, CCKB 
and the muscarinic M3 receptors. Coexpression of SPL or NRB with the alpha(1B)AR 
in Xenopus oocytes revealed that SPL reduces, whereas NRB increases, the 
intensity of Ca(2+) signaling by alpha(1B)AR. Accordingly, deletion of SPL in 
mice enhanced binding of RGS2 to NRB and Ca(2+) signaling by alphaAR, whereas 
deletion of NRB enhanced binding of RGS2 to SPL and reduced Ca(2+) signaling by 
alphaAR. This was due to reciprocal modulation by SPL and NRB of the potency of 
RGS2 to inhibit Ca(2+) signaling by alphaAR. These findings suggest a novel 
mechanism of regulation of GPCR-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in which SPL/NRB forms 
a functional pair of opposing regulators that modulates Ca(2+) signaling 
intensity by GPCRs by determining the extent of inhibition by the R4 family of 
RGS proteins.
