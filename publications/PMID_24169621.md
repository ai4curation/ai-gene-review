More than 170 million people worldwide are infected with the hepatitis C virus 
(HCV), for which future therapies are expected to rely upon a combination of 
oral antivirals. For a rapidly evolving virus like HCV, host-targeting 
antivirals are an attractive option. To decipher the role of novel HCV-host 
interactions, we used a proteomics approach combining immunoprecipitation of 
viral-host protein complexes coupled to mass spectrometry identification and 
functional genomics RNA interference screening of HCV partners. Here, we report 
the proteomics analyses of protein complexes associated with Core, NS2, NS3/4A, 
NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. We identified a stringent set of 98 human 
proteins interacting specifically with one of the viral proteins. The overlap 
with previous virus-host interaction studies demonstrates 24.5% shared HCV 
interactors overall (24/98), illustrating the reliability of the approach. The 
identified human proteins show enriched Gene Ontology terms associated with the 
endoplasmic reticulum, transport proteins with a major contribution of NS3/4A 
interactors, and transmembrane proteins for Core interactors. The interaction 
network emphasizes a high degree distribution, a high betweenness distribution, 
and high interconnectivity of targeted human proteins, in agreement with 
previous virus-host interactome studies. The set of HCV interactors also shows 
extensive enrichment for known targets of other viruses. The combined proteomic 
and gene silencing study revealed strong enrichment in modulators of HCV RNA 
replication, with the identification of 11 novel cofactors among our set of 
specific HCV partners. Finally, we report a novel immune evasion mechanism of 
NS3/4A protein based on its ability to affect nucleocytoplasmic transport of 
type I interferon-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 
nuclear translocation. The study revealed highly stringent association between 
HCV interactors and their functional contribution to the viral replication cycle 
and pathogenesis.
