Chronic inflammation and cancer are intimately associated. This is particularly 
true for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis and 
Crohn's disease, which show a major increased risk for colorectal cancer. While 
the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of IBD has recently improved, 
the mechanisms that link these chronic inflammatory states to colorectal cancer 
development are in large part unknown. One of these mechanisms is NF-kappaB 
pathway activation which in turn may contribute to tumor formation by providing 
anti-apoptotic survival signals to the epithelial cells. Based on the 
observation that netrin-1, the anti-apoptotic ligand for the dependence 
receptors DCC and UNC5H is up-regulated in colonic crypts in response to 
NF-kappaB, we show here that colorectal cancers from inflammatory bowel diseases 
patients have selected up-regulation of netrin-1. Moreover, we demonstrate that 
this inflammation-driven netrin-1 up-regulation is causal for colorectal cancer 
development as interference with netrin-1 autocrine loop in a mouse model for 
ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer, while showing no effect on 
inflammation, inhibits colorectal cancer progression.
