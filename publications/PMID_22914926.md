The tumor suppressor p53 is at the hub of cellular signaling networks that are 
activated by stress signals including DNA damage. In the present study, we 
showed that programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) bound to p53 by glutathione 
S-transferase (GST)-pulldown, co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays. 
PDCD5 enhanced the stability of p53 by antagonizing Mdm2-induced p53 
ubiquitination, nuclear export and proteasomal degradation. We also found that 
PDCD5 could dissociate the interaction between p53 and Mdm2 and interact with 
Mdm2 directly to promote its degradation. In cells with or without induction of 
DNA damage, knockdown of PDCD5 by RNA interference decreased the p53 
phosphorylation at Ser9, 20 and 392 residues, as well as the expression of p21 
protein. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed an 
up-regulated association of PDCD5 at the p53BS2 site of the p21 promoter during 
DNA damage. Cell cycle analysis also indicated that PDCD5 was required in G1 
phase cell arrest during DNA damage. In summary, PDCD5 may contribute to 
maintain a basal pool of p53 proteins in unstressed conditions, but upon DNA 
damage it functions as a co-activator of p53 to regulate transcription and cell 
cycle arrest.
