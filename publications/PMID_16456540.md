Nuclear retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RARs) activate gene expression through 
dynamic interactions with coregulators in coordination with the ligand and 
phosphorylation processes. Here we show that during RA-dependent activation of 
the RARalpha isotype, the p160 coactivator pCIP/ACTR/AIB-1/RAC-3/TRAM-1/SRC-3 is 
phosphorylated by p38MAPK. SRC-3 phosphorylation has been correlated to an 
initial facilitation of RARalpha-target genes activation, via the control of the 
dynamics of the interactions of the coactivator with RARalpha. Then, 
phosphorylation inhibits transcription via promoting the degradation of SRC-3. 
In line with this, inhibition of p38MAPK markedly enhances RARalpha-mediated 
transcription and RA-dependent induction of cell differentiation. SRC-3 
phosphorylation and degradation occur only within the context of RARalpha 
complexes, suggesting that the RAR isotype defines a phosphorylation code 
through dictating the accessibility of the coactivator to p38MAPK. We propose a 
model in which RARalpha transcriptional activity is regulated by SRC-3 through 
coordinated events that are fine-tuned by RA and p38MAPK.
