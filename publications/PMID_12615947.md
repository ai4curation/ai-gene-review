Abstract

Plant defenses against pathogens and insects are regulated differentially by cross-communicating signal transduction pathways in which salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) play key roles. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the antagonistic effect of SA on JA signaling. Arabidopsis plants unable to accumulate SA produced 25-fold higher levels of JA and showed enhanced expression of the JA-responsive genes LOX2 , PDF1.2 , and VSP in response to infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000, indicating that in wild-type plants, pathogen-induced SA accumulation is associated with the suppression of JA signaling. Analysis of the Arabidopsis mutant npr1 , which is impaired in SA signal transduction, revealed that the antagonistic effect of SA on JA signaling requires the regulatory protein NPR1. Nuclear localization of NPR1, which is essential for SA-mediated defense gene expression, is not required for the suppression of JA signaling, indicating that cross-talk between SA and JA is modulated through a novel function of NPR1 in the cytosol.

INTRODUCTION

To effectively combat invasion by microbial pathogens and herbivorous insects, plants are able to activate distinct defense responses that are effective specifically against the invader encountered ( Van Loon, 2000 ). These induced defenses often are expressed not just locally but also in parts distant from the site of primary infection, thereby protecting the plant systemically against subsequent attack. Induced resistance is regulated by a network of interconnecting signal transduction pathways in which salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) function as key signaling molecules ( Reymond and Farmer, 1998 ; Pieterse and Van Loon, 1999 ; Glazebrook, 2001 ; Thomma et al., 2001 ). SA and JA accumulate in response to pathogen infection or herbivore damage, resulting in the activation of distinct sets of defense-related genes. Mutant and transgenic plants that are affected in SA accumulation often are more susceptible to pathogen infection than wild-type plants ( Delaney et al., 1994 ; Nawrath and Métraux, 1999 ; Wildermuth et al., 2001 ). Blocking the response to JA generally renders plants more susceptible to herbivore damage ( Howe et al., 1996 ; McConn et al., 1997 ), although enhanced susceptibility toward necrotrophic pathogens has been reported as well ( Thomma et al., 2001 ). SA- and JA-dependent defense pathways have been shown to cross-communicate ( Felton and Korth, 2000 ; Feys and Parker, 2000 ; Pieterse et al., 2001 ), providing the plant with a regulatory potential to fine-tune the defense reaction depending on the type of attacker encountered.

One of the most studied induced defense responses in plants is systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SAR is triggered after local infection with pathogens, causing hypersensitive necrosis, and is effective against a broad spectrum of plant pathogens ( Ryals et al., 1996 ). The onset of SAR is accompanied by a local and systemic increase in the endogenous levels of SA ( Malamy et al., 1990 ; Métraux et al., 1990 ) and the concomitant upregulation of a large set of genes ( Ward et al., 1991 ), including genes that encode pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins ( Van Loon and Van Strien, 1999 ). Several PR proteins possess antimicrobial activity and are thought to contribute to the state of resistance attained. Transduction of the SA signal requires the function of NPR1 (also known as NIM1), a regulatory protein that was identified in Arabidopsis through genetic screens for SAR-compromised mutants ( Cao et al., 1994 ; Delaney et al., 1995 ; Shah et al., 1997 ). Mutant npr1 plants accumulate normal levels of SA after pathogen infection but are impaired in their ability to express PR genes and to mount a SAR response. The NPR1 gene encodes a protein with a BTB/BOZ domain and an ankyrin-repeat domain ( Cao et al., 1997 ; Ryals et al., 1997 ; Aravind and Koonin, 1999 ). Both domains are known to mediate protein–protein interactions and are present in proteins with diverse functions ( Bork, 1993 ; Aravind and Koonin, 1999 ), including the transcriptional regulator IκB, which mediates animal innate immune responses ( Baldwin, 1996 ). Upon induction of SAR, NPR1 is translocated to the nucleus ( Kinkema et al., 2000 ), where it interacts with members of the TGA/OBF subclass of basic domain/Leu zipper (bZIP) transcription factors ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Zhou et al., 2000 ; Subramaniam et al., 2001 ; Fan and Dong, 2002 ) that are involved in the SA-dependent activation of PR genes ( Lebel et al., 1998 ; Niggeweg et al., 2000 ). Physical interaction between NPR1 and TGA transcription factors has been shown to be required for the binding activity of these factors to promoter elements that play a crucial role in the SA-mediated activation of PR genes ( Després et al., 2000 ; Fan and Dong, 2002 ).

The activation of SAR has been shown to suppress JA signaling in plants, thereby prioritizing SA-dependent resistance to microbial pathogens over JA-dependent defense against insect herbivory ( Felton and Korth, 2000 ; Pieterse et al., 2001 ). Moreover, pharmacological and genetic experiments have shown that SA is a potent suppressor of JA-inducible gene expression ( Doherty et al., 1988 ; Peña-Cortés et al., 1993 ; Doares et al., 1995 ; Harms et al., 1998 ; Gupta et al., 2000 ). The antagonistic effect of SA on JA signaling shows a striking resemblance to the effect of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), a derivative of SA, on the formation of prostaglandins in animal cells. Prostaglandins are related structurally to JA and play a role in diverse biological processes, such as inflammation at sites of infection or tissue injury ( Straus and Glass, 2001 ). JA and prostaglandins originate biosynthetically from linolenic acid and arachidonic acid, respectively, which are released from cell membranes upon phospholipid hydrolysis. Linolenic acid and arachidonic acid are metabolized rapidly via the octadecanoid pathway, in which the enzymatic reactions leading to JA and prostaglandin formation are similar ( Pan et al., 1998 ). In animal cells, aspirin inhibits the octadecanoid pathway by acetylating the key enzyme cyclooxygenase, ultimately leading to a decrease in prostaglandin formation ( Van der Ouderaa et al., 1980 ).

In a similar process in plants, aspirin has been shown to inhibit the activity of the counterpart of cyclooxygenase, allene oxide synthase, which catalyzes the same step in the octa-decanoid pathway in plants, thereby affecting the formation of JA and the subsequent activation of stress-related gene expression ( Pan et al., 1998 ). Whereas aspirin is able to inhibit prostaglandin and JA biosynthetic enzymes by acetylating them, SA, which lacks the acetyl group, is ineffective in this respect. Indeed, in Arabidopsis and flax plants, no inhibitory effect of SA on allene oxide synthase activity was observed ( Harms et al., 1998 ; Laudert and Weiler, 1998 ). Thus, given the fact that the acetylated form of SA does not occur naturally in plants ( Pierpoint, 1997 ), it is unlikely that inhibition of the allene oxide synthase activity plays a major role in the cross-communication between SA and JA signaling in plants. Nevertheless, SA is a strong negative regulator of JA-dependent cellular defense responses in plants ( Doherty et al., 1988 ; Doares et al., 1995 ; Harms et al., 1998 ; Gupta et al., 2000 ).

So how does SA negatively regulate JA-dependent cellular defense responses in plants? In animal cells, both aspirin and SA are able to reduce proinflammatory prostaglandin formation by inhibiting the activity of the transcription factor NF-κB ( Kopp and Ghosh, 1994 ; Yin et al., 1998 ). NF-κB plays a key role in the transcriptional activation of many genes during the innate immune response ( Baldwin, 1996 ; Hatada et al., 2000 ), including the gene that encodes CYCLOOXYGENASE2 , which catalyzes a rate-limiting step in prostaglandin production ( Newton et al., 1997 ). In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with its inhibitory protein IκB. In response to various cellular stress conditions, such as infection by microbial or viral pathogens, IκB kinase is activated and phosphorylates IκB. Subsequently, IκB is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, releasing NF-κB to migrate into the nucleus and activate gene expression ( Baldwin, 1996 ; Hatada et al., 2000 ). Both aspirin and SA block the activation of NF-κB by inhibiting IκB kinase, preventing the degradation of IκB and retaining NF-κB in the cytosol ( Kopp and Ghosh, 1994 ; Yin et al., 1998 ). Interestingly, IκB shares structural similarity with NPR1 in plants ( Cao et al., 1997 ; Ryals et al., 1997 ). In addition to the ankyrin-repeat domain, the phosphorylated Ser residues important for IκB function also are conserved in the NPR1 protein ( Ryals et al., 1997 ).

Because of the intriguing analogies between the actions of SA/aspirin, prostaglandin, and IκB in animals and SA, JA, and NPR1 in plants, we investigated whether NPR1 plays a role in the SA-mediated negative regulation of JA signaling in Arabidopsis. In contrast to IκB in animal cells, which functions in the cytosol, NPR1 was reported previously to function in the nucleus when acting as a positive regulator of SA-dependent, defense-related gene expression ( Kinkema et al., 2000 ; Subramaniam et al., 2001 ). Here, we report a novel function of NPR1 in the cytosol and provide evidence that cytosolic NPR1 plays a crucial role in cross-communication between SA- and JA-dependent plant defense responses.

DISCUSSION

The defense response of plants under attack by microbial pathogens or herbivorous insects is regulated by a network of signal transduction pathways. Cross-communication between defense signaling pathways provides the plant with an elaborate regulatory potential that leads to the activation of the most suitable defense against the invader encountered. In some cases, different defense signal transduction pathways cooperate and enhance resistance against pathogen attack ( Van Wees et al., 2000 ). In other cases, antagonism between pathways allows the defense response to be controlled in a focused manner. For instance, plants that are infected by SAR-inducing pathogens have been shown to suppress JA-dependent defenses against certain herbivorous insects or necrotrophic pathogens ( Felton and Korth, 2000 ; Pieterse et al., 2001 ), thereby prioritizing SA-dependent defense responses over JA-dependent responses. We report evidence indicating that SA produced during pathogen infection plays an important role in the suppression of both JA biosynthesis and JA-responsive gene expression, which are involved in the reaction of plants to wounding and insect herbivory. Compared with wild-type plants, transgenic NahG plants showed enhanced expression of LOX2 and accordingly synthesized 25-fold higher levels of JA during pathogen infection ( Figures 1B and 1C ). Moreover, the expression of the JA-responsive genes VSP and PDF1.2 was enhanced strongly in NahG plants, suggesting that in wild-type plants JA signaling is inhibited by SA that accumulates during pathogen infection.

The LOX2 gene, which encodes LOX2 (which is involved in the octadecanoid pathway), is autoregulated by JA and thus controls a feed-forward loop in JA biosynthesis ( Bell et al., 1995 ). Cosuppression of LOX2 gene expression in transgenic S-12 plants appeared to be effective in blocking JA biosynthesis during pathogen infection ( Figure 2 ). Therefore, the inhibition of this JA biosynthetic gene by SA produced during pathogen infection may result in a strong inhibition of JA formation. Other genes involved in JA biosynthesis, such as AOS , which encodes ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE, have been shown to be regulated by JA as well ( Laudert and Weiler, 1998 ). Thus, the SA-mediated inhibition of JA formation during pathogen attack might be the result of a coordinated suppression of JA-responsive genes that encode enzymes of the octadecanoid pathway.

NPR1 has been demonstrated to be an important transducer of the SA signal in the SA-mediated activation of PR gene expression and broad-spectrum resistance ( Cao et al., 1994 ; Delaney et al., 1995 ; Shah et al., 1997 ). Our study revealed NPR1 as a key regulatory factor in the cross-communication between SA and JA signaling. SA-mediated suppression of the JA-responsive genes LOX2 , VSP , and PDF1.2 , which was observed in wild type Col-0 plants, was abolished in mutant npr1 plants ( Figures 3 and 6 ), indicating that NPR1 is essential for the inhibition of JA-responsive gene expression by SA. How does SA-activated NPR1 function as a negative regulator of JA-responsive genes? Previously, NPR1 was found to interact with members of the TGA subclass of the bZIP transcription factor family ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Zhou et al., 2000 ). TGA factors specifically bind to TGACG motifs and have been shown to play both positive and negative regulatory roles in plant defense ( Xiang et al., 1996 ; Rouster et al., 1997 ; Lebel et al., 1998 ; Niggeweg et al., 2000 ; Pontier et al., 2001 ; Fan and Dong, 2002 ). All JA-responsive genes tested in this study contain one or more TGACG motifs in their promoters. Therefore, we hypothesized that NPR1–TGA interactions might play a role in the SA-mediated suppression of JA-responsive gene expression. Experiments indicated that the strong NPR1 interactor TGA2 ( Zhang et al., 1999 ) binds specifically to the TGACG motif in the JA-responsive PDF1.2 promoter in vitro ( Figure 4 ). However, promoter-deletion analysis demonstrated that SA suppressed MeJA-induced expression in all JA-respon-sive transgenic plants, including those that lack the TGACG motif (P4 and P5; Figure 5 ). These results suggest that the TGACG motif is not essential for the SA-mediated inhibition of JA-responsive gene expression.

In animal cells, it has been demonstrated that SA exerts an inhibitory effect on IκB kinase, thereby preventing IκB from being phosphorylated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome ( Kopp and Ghosh, 1994 ; Yin et al., 1998 ). As a result, IκB remains associated with the transcription factor NF-κB, retaining NF-κB in the cytosol and preventing it from activating target genes such as the NF-κB–dependent, proinflammatory prostaglandin biosynthesis gene CYCLOOXYGENASE2 ( Newton et al., 1997 ; Gallois et al., 1998 ). Thus, in animal cells, SA is able to suppress the formation of prostaglandin, the JA counterpart, by affecting the activity of IκB in the cytosol. Because of the structural similarity between IκB and NPR1 ( Cao et al., 1997 ; Ryals et al., 1997 ), we investigated whether the NPR1-dependent inhibitory effect of SA on JA-responsive gene expression and, consequently, JA production, also functions through a role of NPR1 in the cytosol. Using a DEX-inducible system to control the nucleocytoplasmic localization of NPR1, we demonstrated that nuclear localization of NPR1 is not required for cross-talk between SA and JA signaling ( Figure 6 ). By inference, SA-activated NPR1 must exert its negative effect on JA-responsive gene expression through an unknown function in the cytosol.

How does cytosolic NPR1 control the SA-mediated suppression of JA-responsive gene expression? In the absence of SA, cytosolic NPR1 might be involved in the control of JA-responsive gene expression, either by inhibiting negative regulators of JA-responsive gene expression or by facilitating the delivery of positive regulators of JA-responsive genes to the nucleus. However, in this scenario, npr1 null mutants and NPR1 overexpressors should show an altered JA-responsive phenotype in the absence of SA. This was clearly not the case (data not shown), which makes this possibility unlikely. A more plausible explanation for the cytosolic role of NPR1 is presented in the model shown in Figure 7 . In this model, NPR1 is translocated to the nucleus upon activation by SA, where it facilitates the activation of SA-responsive PR genes. In the cytosol, the remaining SA-activated NPR1 pool is involved in the suppression of JA-responsive gene expression, either by facilitating the delivery of negative regulators of JA-responsive genes to the nucleus or by inhibiting positive regulators of JA-responsive gene expression. However, alternative scenarios, such as an effect of SA-activated cytosolic NPR1 on the activity of JA-metabolizing enzymes, cannot be excluded. It is tempting to speculate that, analogous to the effect of SA and aspirin on IκB kinase, (de)phosphorylation of NPR1 plays a role in the process that leads to the SA-mediated activation of NPR1, because the phosphorylated Ser residues important in IκB function are conserved in NPR1 ( Ryals et al., 1997 ).

In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate the importance of NPR1 in cross-talk between the SA- and JA-dependent signaling pathways in plant defense and reveal a novel function of NPR1 in the cytosol. The striking parallels with processes involved in the animal innate immune response suggest that defense signaling pathways in plants and animals are at least partly conserved.
