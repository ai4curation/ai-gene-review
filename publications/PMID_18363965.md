Post-replication DNA repair facilitates the resumption of DNA synthesis upon 
replication fork stalling at DNA damage sites. Despite the importance of RAD18 
and polymerase eta (Poleta) for post-replication repair (PRR), the molecular 
mechanisms by which these factors are recruited to stalled replication forks are 
not well understood. We present evidence that human RAD18 complexed with RAD6B 
protein preferentially binds to forked and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 
structures, which are known to be localized at stalled replication forks. The 
SAP domain of RAD18 (residues 248-282) is crucial for binding of RAD18 complexed 
with RAD6B to DNA substrates. RAD18 mutated in the SAP domain fails to 
accumulate at DNA damage sites in vivo and does not guide DNA Poleta to stalled 
replication forks. The SAP domain is also required for the efficient 
mono-ubiquitination of PCNA. The SAP domain mutant fails to suppress the 
ultraviolet (UV)-sensitivity of Rad18-knockout cells. These results suggest that 
RAD18 complexed with RAD6B is recruited to stalled replication forks via 
interactions with forked DNA or long ssDNA structures, a process that is 
required for initiating PRR.
