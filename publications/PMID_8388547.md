The tumor suppressor protein p53 was first isolated as a simian virus 40 large T
antigen-associated protein and subsequently was found to function in cell
proliferation control. Tumor-derived mutations in p53 occur predominantly in
four evolutionarily conserved regions spanning approximately 50% of the
polypeptide. Previously, three of these regions were identified as essential for
T-antigen binding. We have examined the interaction between p53 and T antigen by
using Escherichia coli-expressed human p53. By a combination of deletion
analysis and antibody inhibition studies, a region of p53 that is both necessary
and sufficient for binding to T antigen has been localized. This function is
contained within residues 94 to 293, which include the four conserved regions
affected by mutation in tumors. Residues 94 to 293 of p53 were expressed in both
wild-type and mutant forms. T-antigen binding was unaffected by tumor-derived
mutations which have been associated with the wild-type conformation of p53 but
was greatly reduced by mutations which were previously shown to alter p53
conformation. Our results show that, like T-antigen binding to the Rb tumor
suppressor protein, T antigen appears to interact with the domain of p53 that is
commonly mutated in human tumors.

Abstract

The tumor suppressor protein p53 was first isolated as a simian virus 40 large T antigen-associated protein and subsequently was found to function in cell proliferation control. Tumor-derived mutations in p53 occur predominantly in four evolutionarily conserved regions spanning approximately 50% of the polypeptide. Previously, three of these regions were identified as essential for T-antigen binding. We have examined the interaction between p53 and T antigen by using Escherichia coli-expressed human p53. By a combination of deletion analysis and antibody inhibition studies, a region of p53 that is both necessary and sufficient for binding to T antigen has been localized. This function is contained within residues 94 to 293, which include the four conserved regions affected by mutation in tumors. Residues 94 to 293 of p53 were expressed in both wild-type and mutant forms. T-antigen binding was unaffected by tumor-derived mutations which have been associated with the wild-type conformation of p53 but was greatly reduced by mutations which were previously shown to alter p53 conformation. Our results show that, like T-antigen binding to the Rb tumor suppressor protein, T antigen appears to interact with the domain of p53 that is commonly mutated in human tumors.
