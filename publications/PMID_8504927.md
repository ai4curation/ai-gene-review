Transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) plays a pivotal role in the formation of 
transcription-competent initiation complexes. TFIIB was found to interact with 
the TATA-binding protein, the small subunit of TFIIF, and RNA polymerase II. 
These interactions require distinct domains in TFIIB. Using the gel 
mobility-shift assay, it was found that the amino terminus of TFIIB was 
necessary for the formation of complexes containing RNA polymerase II and TFIIF, 
whereas the carboxy-terminal domain, which is composed of two imperfect direct 
repeats and includes a putative amphipathic alpha-helix, was sufficient for the 
formation of complexes containing the TATA-binding protein and TFIIB (DB 
complex). Protein-protein interaction analyses demonstrate that the amphipathic 
alpha-helix in TFIIB is important for the interaction with the TATA-binding 
protein. Specific residues mapping to the carboxyl terminus of the second direct 
repeat were found to be crucial for the interaction of TFIIB and RNA polymerase 
II. The interaction with the small subunit of TFIIF was mapped to the amino 
terminus of TFIIB, which includes a zinc finger.
