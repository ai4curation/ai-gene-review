Deubiquitinating enzymes (Dubs) function to remove covalently attached ubiquitin 
from proteins, thereby controlling substrate activity and/or abundance. For most 
Dubs, their functions, targets, and regulation are poorly understood. To 
systematically investigate Dub function, we initiated a global proteomic 
analysis of Dubs and their associated protein complexes. This was accomplished 
through the development of a software platform called CompPASS, which uses 
unbiased metrics to assign confidence measurements to interactions from parallel 
nonreciprocal proteomic data sets. We identified 774 candidate interacting 
proteins associated with 75 Dubs. Using Gene Ontology, interactome topology 
classification, subcellular localization, and functional studies, we link Dubs 
to diverse processes, including protein turnover, transcription, RNA processing, 
DNA damage, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. This work provides 
the first glimpse into the Dub interaction landscape, places previously 
unstudied Dubs within putative biological pathways, and identifies previously 
unknown interactions and protein complexes involved in this increasingly 
important arm of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
