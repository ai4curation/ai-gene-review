Organisms from all domains of life depend on filaments of the protein actin to 
provide structure and to support internal movements. Many eukaryotic cells use 
forces produced by actin polymerization for their motility, and myosin motor 
proteins use ATP hydrolysis to produce force on actin filaments. Actin 
polymerizes spontaneously, followed by hydrolysis of a bound adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP). Dissociation of the γ-phosphate prepares the polymer for 
disassembly. This review provides an overview of the properties of actin and 
shows how dozens of proteins control both the assembly and disassembly of actin 
filaments. These players catalyze nucleotide exchange on actin monomers, 
initiate polymerization, promote phosphate dissociation, cap the ends of 
polymers, cross-link filaments to each other and other cellular components, and 
sever filaments.
