Hub1/Ubl5 is a member of the family of ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs). The 
tertiary structure of Hub1 is similar to that of ubiquitin; however, it differs 
from known modifiers in that there is no conserved glycine residue near the C 
terminus which, in ubiquitin and UBLs, is required for covalent modification of 
target proteins. Instead, there is a conserved dityrosine motif proximal to the 
terminal nonconserved amino acid. In S. cerevisiae, high molecular weight 
adducts can be formed in vivo from Hub1, but the structure of these adducts is 
not known, and they could be either covalent or noncovalent. The budding yeast 
HUB1 gene is not essential, but Delta hub1 mutants display defects in mating. 
Here, we report that fission yeast hub1 is an essential gene, whose loss results 
in cell cycle defects and inefficient pre-mRNA splicing. A screen for Hub1 
interactors identified Snu66, a component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP splicing 
complex. Furthermore, overexpression of Snu66 suppresses the lethality of a 
hub1ts mutant. In cells lacking functional hub1, the nuclear localization of 
Snu66 is disrupted, suggesting that an important role for Hub1 is the correct 
subcellular targeting of Snu66, although our data suggest that Hub1 is likely to 
perform other roles in splicing as well.
