Gas6 is a novel member of the vitamin K-dependent family of gamma-carboxylated 
proteins and is a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl. Gas6-Axl 
interactions have been shown to mediate cell survival in vascular endothelium. 
Although the receptor-binding portion of gas6 lies in the C-terminus, the 
significance of the N-terminal gamma-carboxylated residues (Gla domain) is not 
clear. To address this question, this study examines the role of the Gla domain 
in phospholipid binding as well as in the promotion of cell survival, especially 
in endothelial cells. The results show that carboxylated gas6 binds to 
phosphatidylserine-containing phospholipid membranes in an analogous manner to 
other gamma-carboxylated proteins whereas decarboxylated gas6 does not. The 
gamma-carboxylation inhibitor warfarin abrogates gas6-mediated protection of 
NIH3T3 fibroblasts from serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the 
role of gamma-carboxylation in gas6's survival effect on endothelium is 
demonstrated directly in that only carboxylated, but not decarboxylated, gas6 
protects endothelial cells from serum starvation-induced apoptosis. 
gamma-carboxylation is also required for both Axl phosphorylation and PI3 kinase 
activation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that gamma-carboxylation 
is necessary not only for gas6 binding to phospholipid membranes, but also for 
gas6-mediated endothelial cell survival.
