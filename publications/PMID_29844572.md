The RANK/RANKL axis emerges as a key regulator of breast cancer initiation, 
progression, and metastasis. RANK-c is a RANK receptor isoform produced through 
alternative splicing of the TNFRSF11A (RANK) gene and a dominant-negative 
regulator of RANK-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. Here we report 
that RANK-c transcript is expressed in 3.2% of cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas 
breast cancer cohort evenly between ER-positive and ER-negative cases. 
Nevertheless, the ratio of RANK to RANK-c (RANK/RANK-c) is increased in 
ER-negative breast cancer cell lines compared to ER-positive breast cancer cell 
lines. In addition, forced expression of RANK-c in ER-negative breast cancer 
cell lines inhibited stimuli-induced NF-κB activation and attenuated migration, 
invasion, colony formation, and adhesion of cancer cells. Further, RANK-c 
expression in MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited lung metastasis and colonization in 
vivo. The RANK-c-mediated inhibition of cancer cell aggressiveness and nuclear 
factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in breast cancer cells seems to rely on a 
RANK-c/TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) protein interaction. This was 
further confirmed by a mutated RANK-c that is unable to interact with TRAF2 and 
abolishes the ability to attenuate NF-κB activation, migration, and invasion. 
Additional protein interaction characterization revealed epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) as a novel interacting partner for RANK-c in breast cancer cells 
with a negative effect on EGFR phosphorylation and EGF-dependent downstream 
signaling pathway activation. Our findings further elucidate the complex 
molecular biology of the RANKL/RANK system in breast cancer and provide 
preliminary data for RANK-c as a possible marker for disease progression and 
aggressiveness.
