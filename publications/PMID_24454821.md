The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a continuous membrane network in eukaryotic 
cells comprising the nuclear envelope, the rough ER, and the smooth ER. The ER 
has multiple critical functions and a characteristic structure. In this study, 
we identified a new protein of the ER, TMCC1 (transmembrane and coiled-coil 
domain family 1). The TMCC family consists of at least 3 putative proteins 
(TMCC1-3) that are conserved from nematode to human. We show that TMCC1 is an ER 
protein that is expressed in diverse human cell lines. TMCC1 contains 2 adjacent 
transmembrane domains near the C-terminus, in addition to coiled-coil domains. 
TMCC1 was targeted to the rough ER through the transmembrane domains, whereas 
the N-terminal region and C-terminal tail of TMCC1 were found to reside in the 
cytoplasm. Moreover, the cytosolic region of TMCC1 formed homo- or hetero-dimers 
or oligomers with other TMCC proteins and interacted with ribosomal proteins. 
Notably, overexpression of TMCC1 or its transmembrane domains caused defects in 
ER morphology. Our results suggest roles of TMCC1 in ER organization.
