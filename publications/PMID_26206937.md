Mutations in the LRBA gene (encoding the lipopolysaccharide-responsive and 
beige-like anchor protein) cause a syndrome of autoimmunity, 
lymphoproliferation, and humoral immune deficiency. The biological role of LRBA 
in immunologic disease is unknown. We found that patients with LRBA deficiency 
manifested a dramatic and sustained improvement in response to abatacept, a 
CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4)-immunoglobulin fusion drug. Clinical 
responses and homology of LRBA to proteins controlling intracellular trafficking 
led us to hypothesize that it regulates CTLA4, a potent inhibitory immune 
receptor. We found that LRBA colocalized with CTLA4 in endosomal vesicles and 
that LRBA deficiency or knockdown increased CTLA4 turnover, which resulted in 
reduced levels of CTLA4 protein in FoxP3(+) regulatory and activated 
conventional T cells. In LRBA-deficient cells, inhibition of lysosome 
degradation with chloroquine prevented CTLA4 loss. These findings elucidate a 
mechanism for CTLA4 trafficking and control of immune responses and suggest 
therapies for diseases involving the CTLA4 pathway.
