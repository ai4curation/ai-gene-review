X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure 
to develop cognitive abilities, owing to mutations in a gene on the X 
chromosome. The latest XLMR update lists up to 136 conditions leading to 
'syndromic', or 'specific', mental retardation (MRXS) and 66 entries leading to 
'nonspecific' mental retardation (MRX). For 9 of the 66 MRX entries, the 
causative gene has been identified. Our recent discovery of the contiguous gene 
deletion syndrome ATS-MR (previously known as Alport syndrome, mental 
retardation, midface hypoplasia, elliptocytosis, OMIM #300194), characterized by 
Alport syndrome (ATS) and mental retardation (MR), indicated Xq22.3 as a region 
containing one mental retardation gene. Comparing the extent of deletion between 
individuals with ATS-MR and individuals with ATS alone allowed us to define a 
critical region for mental retardation of approximately 380 kb, containing four 
genes. Here we report the identification of two point mutations, one missense 
and one splice-site change, in the gene FACL4 in two families with nonspecific 
mental retardation. Analysis of enzymatic activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines 
from affected individuals of both families revealed low levels compared with 
normal cells, indicating that both mutations are null mutations. All carrier 
females with either point mutations or genomic deletions in FACL4 showed a 
completely skewed X-inactivation, suggesting that the gene influences survival 
advantage. FACL4 is the first gene shown to be involved in nonspecific mental 
retardation and fatty-acid metabolism.
