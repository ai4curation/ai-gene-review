Kit/SCF signaling and Mitf-dependent transcription are both essential for 
melanocyte development and pigmentation. To identify Mitf-dependent Kit 
transcriptional targets in primary melanocytes, microarray studies were 
undertaken. Among identified targets was BCL2, whose germline deletion produces 
melanocyte loss and which exhibited phenotypic synergy with Mitf in mice. BCL2's 
regulation by Mitf was verified in melanocytes and melanoma cells and by 
chromatin immunoprecipitation of the BCL2 promoter. Mitf also regulates BCL2 in 
osteoclasts, and both Mitf(mi/mi) and Bcl2(-/-) mice exhibit severe 
osteopetrosis. Disruption of Mitf in melanocytes or melanoma triggered profound 
apoptosis susceptible to rescue by BCL2 overexpression. Clinically, primary 
human melanoma expression microarrays revealed tight nearest neighbor linkage 
for MITF and BCL2. This linkage helps explain the vital roles of both Mitf and 
Bcl2 in the melanocyte lineage and the well-known treatment resistance of 
melanoma.
