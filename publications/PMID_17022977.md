Influenza virus matrix protein 1 (M1) has been shown to play a crucial role in 
the virus replication, assembly and budding. We identified heat shock cognate 
protein 70 (Hsc70) as a M1 binding protein by immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF 
MS. The C terminal domain of M1 interacts with Hsc70. We found that Hsc70 does 
not correlate with the transport of M1 to the nucleus, however, it does inhibit 
the nuclear export of M1 and NP, thus resulting in the inhibition of viral 
production. This is the first demonstration that Hsc70 is directly associated 
with M1 and therefore is required for viral production.
