Cytochrome c (Cc) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) form an important redox pair 
for understanding interprotein electron transfer (ET). Measurements of ET rates 
from photoexcited CcP substituted with Zn porphyrin to either yeast Fe(III)Cc or 
horse Fe(III)Cc in crystals reveal that the molecular associations found in the 
respective crystal structures determine solution reactivity. Similar forward 
rates for yeast isozyme-1 Cc (yCc) and yCc homologue horse Cc (hCc), despite 
different orientations relative to CcP, suggest small-amplitude conformational 
gating of ET even in the crystalline state; faster back ET in the yCc compared 
to the hCc complex agrees with the relative coupling between redox sites 
predicted by the structures.
