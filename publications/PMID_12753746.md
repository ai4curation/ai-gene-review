Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to arise in the 
aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of embryo proper, although HSC activity can 
be detected in yolk sac (YS) and paraaortic splanchnopleura (P-Sp) when 
transplanted in newborn mice. We examined the role of Notch signaling in 
embryonic hematopoiesis. The activity of colony-forming cells in the YS from 
Notch1(-/-) embryos was comparable to that of wild-type embryos. However, in 
vitro and in vivo definitive hematopoietic activities from YS and P-Sp were 
severely impaired in Notch1(-/-) embryos. The population representing hemogenic 
endothelial cells, however, did not decrease. In contrast, Notch2(-/-) embryos 
showed no hematopoietic deficiency. These data indicate that Notch1, but not 
Notch2, is essential for generating hematopoietic stem cells from endothelial 
cells.
