The abundant molecular chaperone Hsp90 is essential for the folding and 
stabilization of hundreds of distinct client proteins. Hsp90 is assisted by 
multiple cochaperones that modulate Hsp90's ATPase activity and/or promote 
client interaction, but the in vivo functions of many of these cochaperones are 
largely unknown. We found that Cpr6, Cpr7, and Cns1 interact with the intact 
ribosome and that Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking CPR7 or containing mutations 
in CNS1 exhibited sensitivity to the translation inhibitor hygromycin. Cpr6 
contains a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain and a tetratricopeptide 
repeat (TPR) domain flanked by charged regions. Truncation or alteration of 
basic residues near the carboxy terminus of Cpr6 disrupted ribosome interaction. 
Cns1 contains an amino-terminal TPR domain and a poorly characterized 
carboxy-terminal domain. The isolated carboxy-terminal domain was able to 
interact with the ribosome. Although loss of CPR6 does not cause noticeable 
growth defects, overexpression of CPR6 results in enhanced growth defects in 
cells expressing the temperature-sensitive cns1-G90D mutation (the G-to-D change 
at position 90 encoded by cns1). Cpr6 mutants that exhibit reduced ribosome 
interaction failed to cause growth defects, indicating that ribosome interaction 
is required for in vivo functions of Cpr6. Together, these results represent a 
novel link between the Hsp90 molecular-chaperone machine and protein synthesis.
