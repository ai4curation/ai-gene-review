DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly toxic because they block the 
progression of replisomes. The Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins, encoded by genes 
that are mutated in FA, are important for repair of ICLs. The FA core complex 
catalyzes the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, and this event is essential for 
several steps of ICL repair. However, how monoubiquitination of FANCD2 promotes 
ICL repair at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we describe a highly 
conserved protein, KIAA1018/MTMR15/FAN1, that interacts with, and is recruited 
to sites of DNA damage by, the monoubiquitinated form of FANCD2. FAN1 exhibits 
endonuclease activity toward 5' flaps and has 5' exonuclease activity, and these 
activities are mediated by an ancient VRR_nuc domain. Depletion of FAN1 from 
human cells causes hypersensitivity to ICLs, defects in ICL repair, and genome 
instability. These data at least partly explain how ubiquitination of FANCD2 
promotes DNA repair.
