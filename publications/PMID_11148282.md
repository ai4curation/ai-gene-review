Abstract

Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a broad-spectrum resistance in plants that involves the upregulation of a battery of pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes. NPR1 is a key regulator in the signal transduction pathway that leads to SAR. Mutations in NPR1 result in a failure to induce PR genes in systemic tissues and a heightened susceptibility to pathogen infection, whereas overexpression of the NPR1 protein leads to increased induction of the PR genes and enhanced disease resistance. We analyzed the subcellular localization of NPR1 to gain insight into the mechanism by which this protein regulates SAR. An NPR1–green fluorescent protein fusion protein, which functions the same as the endogenous NPR1 protein, was shown to accumulate in the nucleus in response to activators of SAR. To control the nuclear transport of NPR1, we made a fusion of NPR1 with the glucocorticoid receptor hormone binding domain. Using this steroid-inducible system, we clearly demonstrate that nuclear localization of NPR1 is essential for its activity in inducing PR genes.

INTRODUCTION

Plants, like animals, are capable of mounting an immune response after a primary pathogen infection. One such response is known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SAR, which is often triggered by a local infection, can provide long-term resistance throughout the plant to subsequent infections by a broad range of pathogens ( Ross, 1961 ; Kuc, 1982 ; Ryals et al., 1996 ). The activation of SAR correlates with the expression of the pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes. Even though the functions of most PR gene products are unknown, some of these proteins have been shown to confer various degrees of pathogen resistance ( Schlumbaum et al., 1986 ; Mauch et al., 1988 ; Broglie et al., 1991 ; Woloshuk et al., 1991 ; Terras et al., 1992 , 1995 ; Alexander et al., 1993 ; Liu et al., 1994 ; Ponstein et al., 1994 ; Zhu et al., 1994 ).

Activation of PR gene expression and the establishment of SAR require the signal molecule salicylic acid (SA). Concentrations of SA have been shown to increase in both infected and uninfected tissues after pathogen infection ( Malamy et al., 1990 ; Métraux et al., 1990 , 1991 ; Rasmussen et al., 1991 ). The exogenous application of SA or its synthetic analogs, such as 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) and benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S -methyl ester, results in expression of the PR genes and activation of SAR ( White, 1979 ; Ward et al., 1991 ; Görlach et al., 1996 ; Lawton et al., 1996 ). The essential role of SA in SAR has been demonstrated in transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis plants that express the bacterial salicylate hydroxylase ( nahG ) gene. In these plants, SA is converted to the inactive compound catechol, and the induction of PR gene expression and SAR is inhibited ( Gaffney et al., 1993 ; Delaney et al., 1994 ; Lawton et al., 1995 ).

Transduction of the SA signal requires the function of NPR1, a protein first identified in Arabidopsis through a mutant screen ( Cao et al., 1994 ). The npr1 (nonexpressor of PR genes) mutant fails to respond to various SAR-inducing agents (SA, INA, and avirulent pathogens), displaying little expression of PR genes and exhibiting increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections. Other mutant alleles of npr1 (also known as nim1 and sai1 ) have been isolated by various genetic screening strategies ( Delaney et al., 1995 ; Glazebrook et al., 1996 ; Shah et al., 1997 ). The NPR1 gene encodes a novel protein containing an ankyrin repeat domain and a BTB/POZ ( broad-complex , tramtrack , and bric-à-brac /poxvirus, zinc finger) domain ( Cao et al., 1997 ; Aravind and Koonin, 1999 ), both of which are involved in protein–protein interactions ( Michaely and Bennet, 1992 ; Bork, 1993 ; Li et al., 1997 ; Aravind and Koonin, 1999 ). The importance of these domains in NPR1 is verified by the isolation of loss-of-function point mutations in the highly conserved amino acids within them.

The absence of any known DNA binding domains in NPR1 suggests that it may either play an indirect role in regulating the PR genes or serve as a regulator of the transcription factor or factors that control PR gene expression. Recently, we and other researchers showed that NPR1 interacts with several members of the TGA subclass of basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factors ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Zhou et al., 2000 ). These TGA factors can bind to the SA-responsive as-1 element found in the PR-1 gene promoter ( Lebel et al., 1998 ). In an in vitro gel mobility shift assay, Després et al. (2000) showed that the DNA binding activity of TGA2 is enhanced by NPR1. However, the mechanism by which this enhancement is achieved has not been determined, because NPR1 does not appear to be part of the TGA2/DNA complex. Therefore, the biological significance of NPR1–TGA interactions remains to be determined.

One piece of information that is required to better understand the function of NPR1 is the subcellular localization of the protein during the activation of SAR. To observe the subcellular localization of NPR1 in living plant cells, we fused the NPR1 cDNA with the coding region of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria ( Chiu et al., 1996 ). We found that this biologically active fusion protein accumulates in the nucleus in response to both chemical and biological inducers of plant defense responses. This nuclear accumulation of NPR1-GFP correlates with the expression of PR genes. Using a fusion between NPR1 and the glucocorticoid receptor hormone binding domain (HBD), the nucleocytoplasmic localization of which can be controlled by the steroid dexamethasone (DEX; Beato, 1989 ), we demonstrate that nuclear localization of NPR1 is required for PR gene activation.

DISCUSSION

NPR1 is a key regulator of SAR-related PR gene expression. Plants overexpressing NPR1 show enhanced resistance to various pathogens without constitutively expressing the PR genes ( Cao et al., 1998 ). This indicates that the NPR1 protein requires activation to be functional ( Cao et al., 1998 ; Figures 1A to 1C ). The mechanism of activation could involve the translocation of NPR1 to another cellular compartment and/or a chemical or structural modification of the protein. To better understand the regulation of NPR1 and, more specifically, to determine the requirements for NPR1 protein activation, we examined the subcellular localization of NPR1 in living plant cells by expressing an NPR1-GFP fusion protein in transgenic plants.

Constitutive expression of NPR1-GFP complemented all of the known phenotypes associated with the npr1 mutants ( Figure 1 ). This finding indicates that the fusion protein is biologically functional and therefore is correctly localized. The quantities of NPR1-GFP protein remained constant before and after induction; therefore, the enhanced nuclear fluorescence observed after SAR induction ( Figure 2A ) must have been caused by an accumulation of NPR1-GFP in the nucleus. This conclusion was further confirmed by the detection of increased amounts of NPR1-GFP in a nucleus-enriched fraction from SAR-induced plants relative to that in uninduced plants ( Figure 2B ). The nuclear localization of NPR1-GFP must be directed by an NLS in NPR1 because the predicted size of NPR1-GFP (92 kD) well exceeds the size exclusion limit (40 to 60 kD) for passive diffusion of proteins through the nuclear pores ( Raikhel, 1992 ). On the other hand, GFP alone (26 kD) is distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Identification of a bipartite NLS in NPR1 ( Figure 3 ) further verifies that NPR1 is targeted specifically to the nucleus.

It is still unclear where NPR1 is localized before induction. In guard cells, NPR1-GFP is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei in the absence of an SAR inducer. Treatment with an SAR inducer causes NPR1-GFP to accumulate exclusively in the nuclei, possibly because of an increased retention of the protein in the nuclei as a result of chemical modification or physical association with other proteins. One likely explanation for the lack of cytoplasmic fluorescence in the larger mesophyll cells is that the fusion protein is too diffuse to be detected. Indeed, compared with the amounts of GFP protein detected in 35S :: GFP transgenic lines, the amounts of NPR1-GFP in the 35S :: NPR1-GFP transgenic plants are markedly lower ( Figure 1B ). Analyses of transgenic plants expressing the cytoplasmically localized npr1nls-GFP mutant protein revealed that, for many lines, the cytoplasmic fluorescence was visible only in the guard cells, because of their smaller size. Cytoplasmic fluorescence in the larger cells was detectable only in lines that expressed the fusion protein in greater amounts ( Figure 3 ).

Previous characterization of the npr1 mutant revealed that NPR1 functions downstream of the signal molecule SA ( Cao et al., 1994 ). The data presented here suggest that cell SA levels may in fact regulate the amount of NPR1 that accumulates in the nucleus. Transgenic plants grown on medium containing 0.3 mM SA accumulated more NPR1-GFP in the nucleus than did plants grown on medium containing 0.1 mM SA ( Figure 4 ). In addition, after pathogen infection, the nuclear accumulation of NPR1-GFP was much greater in cells surrounding the infection site ( Figure 4 ), which have been shown to have greater amounts of endogenous SA ( Malamy et al., 1990 ). We also detected an increase in NPR1-GFP nuclear accumulation in systemic tissues after a local infection by an avirulent pathogen. However, the systemic induction of NPR1-GFP nuclear localization is not as consistent as the local response observed after pathogen infection. A likely explanation for this finding is that the relatively small amounts of SA in uninfected tissues are not sufficient to induce consistent, detectable nuclear accumulation, although they are adequate to influence PR gene expression. We cannot rule out, however, the possibility that nuclear accumulation of NPR1 is required only locally to induce resistance and to produce the systemic signal.

Fusion of HBD to NPR1 allowed us to control the nucleocytoplasmic localization of NPR1 by using the hormone DEX. In the absence of steroid, NPR1-HBD is sequestered in the cytoplasm by hsp90. As a result, no PR-1 expression was detected in 35S :: NPR1-HBD plants after treatment with INA ( Figure 5 ). These results show that nuclear localization of NPR1 is essential for its function in activating the PR genes. Interestingly, SA or INA is still required, in addition to DEX, to induce PR-1 expression in 35S :: NPR1-HBD plants. SA or INA may be necessary not only for the nuclear accumulation of NPR1 but also for a chemical or structural modification of the protein. SA or INA also might be involved in activation of regulatory components other than NPR1. Genetic characterization of an npr1 -suppressor mutant, sni1 , indicates that this may be the case ( Li et al., 1999 ). In the sni1 npr1 double mutant, PR gene expression is restored. However, this NPR1-independent PR gene expression still requires the presence of SA or INA.

How does NPR1 localized to the nucleus regulate the expression of PR genes? Recently, NPR1 was found to interact with members of the TGA subclass of basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factors in several yeast two-hybrid screens and in vitro ( Zhang et al., 1999 ; Després et al., 2000 ; Zhou et al., 2000 ). This finding indicates that NPR1 may regulate gene expression through a direct physical interaction with the transcription factors. This is consistent with previous promoter studies that showed the binding motif of TGA transcription factors (known as the as-1 element) to be required for SA-induced gene expression ( Lebel et al., 1998 ). The biological significance of the NPR1–TGA interaction has not been determined. NPR1 is unlikely to be involved in the nuclear transport of the TGA transcription factors. One of the TGA factors (AHBP-1b) has been shown to be localized to the nucleus even in a plant carrying an npr1 mutation that disrupts the NPR1–TGA interaction (M. Kinkema and X. Dong, unpublished data). Alternatively, NPR1 localized to the nucleus could be part of a transcription factor complex, enhancing DNA binding, as suggested by Després et al. (2000) , or modulating the transactivation activity of the complex. Recent studies suggest that induction of the PR genes involves not only the activation of positive regulators but also the inhibition of negative regulators ( Lebel et al., 1998 ; Li et al., 1999 ). A genetic study showed that NPR1 may be required to inactivate the nucleus-localized repressor of SAR, SNI1 ( Li et al., 1999 ). Even though more experiments are required to determine the molecular mechanism by which NPR1 regulates PR gene expression and SAR, the present study, together with previous results, strongly suggests that NPR1 regulates PR gene expression by forming a nuclear protein complex with other transcriptional regulators.
