Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is an 
adaptor/scaffold protein that mediates several important signaling pathways, 
including the tumor necrosis factor-R:NF-kappaB pathway, involved in immune 
surveillance, inflammation, etc. Because most studies of TRAF6 function have 
focused primarily on its role as an adaptor molecule in signaling pathways in 
the cytoplasm, the potential functions of TRAF6 in other cellular compartments 
has not been previously investigated. Here, we demonstrate that TRAF6 resides 
not only in the cellular cytoplasm but is also found in the nuclei of both 
normal and malignant B lymphocytes. TRAF6 does not possess a nuclear 
localization signal but enters the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex 
containing RanGap1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning experiments 
demonstrated that nuclear TRAF6 associates with c-Myb within the 5'-end of the 
c-Myb promoter. Further analysis showed that nuclear TRAF6 is modified by small 
ubiquitin-related modifier-1, interacts with histone deacetylase 1, and 
represses c-Myb-mediated transactivation. Thus, TRAF6 negatively regulates c-Myb 
through a novel repressor function in the nuclei of both normal and malignant 
B-lymphocytes that could represent a novel control mechanism that maintains cell 
homeostasis and immune surveillance.
