The proteasome plays an important role in proteostasis by carrying out 
controlled protein degradation in the cell. Impairments in proteasome function 
are associated with severe and often age-related diseases. Here, we have 
characterized a molecular mechanism linking insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) to 
proteasome activity. We show that decreased IIS, which promotes proteostasis and 
longevity, increases proteasome activity through the FOXO transcription factor 
DAF-16 in C. elegans. Furthermore, we reveal that DAF-16 represses expression of 
the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme ubh-4, which we suggest 
functions as a tissue-specific proteasome inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate 
that proteasome activation through downregulation of the ubh-4 human ortholog 
uchl5 increases degradation of proteotoxic proteins in mammalian cells. In 
conclusion, we have established a mechanism by which the evolutionarily 
conserved IIS contributes to the regulation of proteasome activity in a 
multicellular organism.
