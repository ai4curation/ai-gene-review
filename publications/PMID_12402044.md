The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene is translocated in most acute 
promyelocytic leukaemias and encodes a tumour suppressor protein. PML is 
involved in multiple apoptotic pathways and is thought to be pivotal in gamma 
irradiation-induced apoptosis. The DNA damage checkpoint kinase hCds1/Chk2 is 
necessary for p53-dependent apoptosis after gamma irradiation. In addition, 
gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis also occurs through p53-independent 
mechanisms, although the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we 
report that hCds1/Chk2 mediates gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis in a 
p53-independent manner through an ataxia telangiectasia-mutated 
(ATM)-hCds1/Chk2-PML pathway. Our results provide the first evidence of a 
functional relationship between PML and a checkpoint kinase in gamma 
irradiation-induced apoptosis.
