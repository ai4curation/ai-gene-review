An association between impaired fetal growth and the postnatal development of 
obesity has been established. Here, by comparing adipocytes differentiated from 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) taken from the umbilical cord and derived from 
normal and growth-restricted neonates, we identified the transcription factor 
SOX6 as highly expressed only in growth-restricted individuals. We found that 
SOX6 regulates adipogenesis in vertebrate species by activating adipogenic 
regulators including PPARγ, C/EBPα and MEST. We further show that SOX6 interacts 
with β-catenin in adipocytes, suggesting an inhibition of WNT/β-catenin 
signaling, thereby promoting adipogenesis. The upstream regulatory region of the 
MEST gene in MSCs from growth-restricted subjects harbors hypomethylated CpGs 
next to SOX6 binding motifs, and we found that SOX6 binding is impaired by 
adjacent CpG methylation. In summary, we report that SOX6 is a novel regulator 
of adipogenesis synergizing with epigenetic mechanisms.
