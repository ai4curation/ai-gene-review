The special organelle-located MAVS, STING and TLR3 are important for clearing 
viral infections. Although TLR4 triggers NF-κB activation to produce 
pro-inflammatory cytokines for bacterial clearance, effectors with special 
organelle localization have not been identified. Here, we screened more than 280 
E3 ubiquitin ligases and discovered that the endoplasmic reticulum-located Hrd1 
regulates TLR4-induced inflammation during bacterial infection. Hrd1 interacts 
directly with the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp15. Unlike the classical function 
of Hrd1 in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, Usp15 is not degraded 
but loses its deubiquitinating activity for IκBα deubiquitination, resulting in 
excessive NF-κB activation. Importantly, Hrd1 deficiency in macrophages protects 
mice against lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock, and knockdown of Usp15 in 
Hrd1-knockout macrophages restores the reduced IL-6 production. This study 
proposes that there is crosstalk between Hrd1 and TLR4, thereby linking the 
endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane function during bacterial infection.
