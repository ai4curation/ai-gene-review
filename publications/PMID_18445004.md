GATA-3 is the master transcription factor for T helper 2 (Th2) cell 
differentiation and is critical for the expression of Th2 cytokines. Little is 
known, however, about the nature of the functional molecular complexes of 
GATA-3. We identified a high-mobility group (HMG)-box type transcription factor, 
lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF-1), in the GATA-3 complex present in Th2 cells 
using a Flag-calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP)-tag based proteomics method. The 
interaction between GATA-3 and LEF-1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation 
experiments using LEF-1-introduced T-cell lineage TG40 cells. The HMG-box domain 
of LEF-1 and two zinc finger domains of GATA-3 were found to be important for 
the physical association. The introduction of LEF-1 into developing Th2 cells 
resulted in the suppression of Th2 cytokine production. The suppression was 
significantly lower in the cells into which a HMG-box-deleted LEF-1 mutant was 
introduced. Moreover, LEF-1 inhibited the binding activity of GATA-3 to the 
interleukin (IL)-5 promoter. These results suggest that LEF-1 is involved in the 
GATA-3 complex, while also regulating the GATA-3 function, such as the induction 
of Th2 cytokine expression via the inhibition of the DNA-binding activity of 
GATA-3.

Abstract

GATA-3 is the master transcription factor for T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation and is critical for the expression of Th2 cytokines. Little is known, however, about the nature of the functional molecular complexes of GATA-3. We identified a high-mobility group (HMG)-box type transcription factor, lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF-1), in the GATA-3 complex present in Th2 cells using a Flag-calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP)-tag based proteomics method. The interaction between GATA-3 and LEF-1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using LEF-1-introduced T-cell lineage TG40 cells. The HMG-box domain of LEF-1 and two zinc finger domains of GATA-3 were found to be important for the physical association. The introduction of LEF-1 into developing Th2 cells resulted in the suppression of Th2 cytokine production. The suppression was significantly lower in the cells into which a HMG-box-deleted LEF-1 mutant was introduced. Moreover, LEF-1 inhibited the binding activity of GATA-3 to the interleukin (IL)-5 promoter. These results suggest that LEF-1 is involved in the GATA-3 complex, while also regulating the GATA-3 function, such as the induction of Th2 cytokine expression via the inhibition of the DNA-binding activity of GATA-3.

Introduction

CD4 T cell-dependent immune responses are controlled by at least three distinct helper T-cell subsets, T helper 1 (Th1), Th2 and Th17. 1 – 6 Th1 cells produce a large amount of interferon (IFN)-γ to control cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 and are involved in humoral immunity. 2 – 4 Th17 is a recently identified helper T-cell subpopulation that is required for the exclusion of extracellular pathogens and is associated with inflammatory autoimmune responses. 5 , 6

Several transcription factors that control Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation have been identified. Of these, GATA-3 appears to be a key factor for Th2 cell differentiation, 7 – 9 as is T-cell-specific T-box transcription factor (T-bet) for Th1, 10 and retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) for Th17. 11 Recently, chromatin modification of the IL-4/IL-5/IL-13 loci in developing Th2 cells, 12 – 14 the IFN-γ locus in Th1 cells, 15 and the IL-17 locus in Th17 cells has been demonstrated. 16 The histone modifications at the Th2 cytokine gene loci are primarily mediated by GATA-3 in CD4 and CD8 T cells. 14 , 17 , 18 The binding of GATA-3 at the conserved GATA-3 response element (CGRE) region appears to initiate the long-range histone acetylation accompanied by non-coding transcription. 14

GATA-3 is abundantly expressed in T lymphocytes and the embryonic brain. 19 , 20 The expression of GATA-3 is required for the development of T cells in the thymus 21 , 22 and for β-selection and CD4 single positive thymocyte development. 23 In peripheral T cells, the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) induces GATA-3 mRNA expression, and the ectopic expression of GATA-3 results in Th2 cell differentiation even in the absence of STAT6. 9 , 24 In addition to transcriptional regulation, the expression of GATA-3 is also regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism. We recently reported that the rat sarcoma virus oncogene 1 (Ras)-extracellular regulatory kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade 25 and mammalian polycomb group protein B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 (Bmi1) controls GATA-3 stability through the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway. 26

GATA-3 belongs to a family of zinc finger transcription factors. The mammalian GATA- family consists of six proteins (GATA-1 to GATA-6) that share a zinc finger domain (Cys-X2-Cys-X17-Cys-X2-Cys, where X represents any amino acid residue) and bind to the consensus sequence 5′-(A/T)GATA(A/G)-3′. 27 The zinc finger domain of the GATA protein contains two finger domains, a C-terminal finger (C-finger) and an N-terminal finger (N-finger). The C-finger is responsible for DNA binding, whereas the stabilization of DNA binding is regulated by the N-finger, which also physically interacts with the other zinc finger proteins. Recently, we identified a novel conserved sequence YxKxHxxxPP located immediately downstream of the C-finger, which is essential for DNA binding, supporting Th2 cell differentiation and chromatin remodelling of the Th2 cytokine gene loci. 28

Lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF-1) is a member of the LEF-1/transcription factor (TCF) subfamily of high-mobility group (HMG) domain proteins and recognizes a 5′CCTTTGAACT sequence. 29 , 30 There are four genes, Lef1 , Tcf3 , Tcf4 , and Tcf7 ( TCF-1 ) in the LEF-1/TCF family, which are the products of various different splice variants. 31 These family members show homology in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The N-terminal region contains a β-catenin-binding domain whereas the HMG DNA-binding domain is located in the C-terminal region of the protein. The other amino acid sequences of the protein are very diverse, and have different functional motifs, such as the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP)-binding motif, 32 the p300 interacting domain, 33 and the E-tail motif (CRARF motif). 34 These functional motifs are present only in some isoforms of the LEF-1/TCF molecules. These LEF-1/TCF proteins show various activities when they are expressed ectopically 35 and they also have a regulatory function on some promoters of the target genes. 33

LEF-1 is expressed in lymphoid cells and also in many cells undergoing the processes of organogenesis in the developing mouse. 36 , 37 The HMG-box domain of LEF-1 facilitates the assembly of the DNA-bound enhanceosome by inducing DNA bending, 38 whereas the activation domain of LEF-1 contributes to enhanceosome-mediated enhancement of downstream T-cell receptor (TCR)-α promoter activity. 39 , 40 LEF-1 acts as an architectural transcriptional factor, which mediates wingless/int-1 (Wnt)/β-catenin signalling. 41 – 43 In response to Wnt signals, LEF-1 interacts with and stabilizes β-catenin at its N-terminal region, and hence activates Wnt-response gene transcription. 44 In association with the co-repressor Groucho, LEF-1 represses the Wnt-responsive genes. 45 In addition, LEF-1 can interact with the cofactor ALY and other transcription factors to activate enhancers of specific target genes, in the absence of Wnt signalling.

In the present study, we demonstrate that LEF-1 associates with GATA-3. We found the zinc finger region of GATA-3 and the HMG box of LEF-1 to play important roles in the association of these two molecules. LEF-1 suppresses the transcription of the Th2 cytokine genes in developing Th2 cells. Our results may contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of GATA-3 activity in Th2 cells.

In vitroTh2 cell differentiation and the introduction of LEF-1

Splenic CD4 T cells were purified using magnetic beads and an Auto-MACS Sorter (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) yielding a purity of >98%. For Th2 cell differentiation, the purified CD4 T cells (1·5 × 10 6 ) were stimulated for 2 days with immobilized anti-TCR mAb (H57-597, 3 μg/ml) in the presence of IL-2 (25 U/ml), IL-4 (100 U/ml), and anti-IFN-γ mAb (R4.6A2, 25% culture supernatant). The pMX-IRES-human NGF receptor p75 (hNGFR) plasmid was generated from the pMX-IRES-GFP plasmid by replacing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with the cytoplasmic region-deleted hNGFR cDNA. The method for the generation of virus supernatant and infection has been described previously. 46 Virus supernatant was added to the Th2 cell differentiation cultures on day 2. After culturing for three more days, the cells were harvested, restimulated and subjected to reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The infected cells were enriched by magnetic antibody cell sorting (MACS) with anti-human NGFR (C40-1457; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA).

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that LEF-1 physically associates with GATA-3 in cells of the T-cell lineage TG40, and that the HMG-box domain of LEF-1 is important in the association with GATA-3. Both zinc finger domains of GATA-3 appear to be required for the association with LEF-1. LEF-1 appears to inhibit the DNA binding of GATA-3, while suppressing the production of Th2 cytokines.

Several transcription factors, including repressor of GATA (ROG), friend of GATA (FOG), MAD homolog 3 (Smad3), spleen focus forming virus proviral integration oncogene spi1 (PU.1) and T-bet, have been reported to be associated with GATA-3 and regulate GATA-3 function. 52 – 56 Smad3 acts as a co-activator of GATA-3, whereas ROG, FOG, PU.1 and T-bet appear to suppress GATA-3 function. Although the important regions of GATA-3 regarding the association with ROG and FOG have been determined, those for the association with PU.1 and T-bet remain unclear. ROG binds to the C-finger of GATA-3 and FOG binds to the N-finger, and control GATA-3 functions. In the current report, we found that both zinc fingers of GATA-3 are involved in the binding with LEF-1 ( Fig. 1 ). This result may suggest that the association of LEF-1 with the zinc finger regions of GATA-3 is distinct from that of ROG or FOG.

The overexpression of ROG suppresses GATA-3-dependent transactivation 52 and Th2 cell differentiation. 17 PU.1 also suppresses Th2 cytokine production from the Th2 cell subpopulation through the inhibition of GATA-3 binding to the IL-4 V A enhancer site. 55 An inhibitory effect of T-bet on GATA-3 binding at the IL-5 promoter has also been demonstrated. 56 Interestingly, it was recently reported that GATA-3 could also interfere with the transactivation of the promoter of fucosyltransferase VII by T-bet. 57 The functional consequence of the T-bet/GATA-3 interaction can be bidirectional, and these two opposing transcription factors can counteract each other. Like T-bet and PU.1, LEF-1 is a member of a family of transcription factors that directly recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences. Moreover, the DNA-binding domains of GATA-3 and LEF-1 are involved in their association ( Figs 1 – 3 ). It is therefore likely that the binding of LEF-1 to GATA-3 inhibits the DNA-binding activity of GATA-3. In fact, an inhibitory effect of LEF-1 in the binding of GATA-3 to the IL-5 promoter was demonstrated ( Fig. 4e ).

The expression of LEF-1 was rapidly down-regulated in CD4 T cells after TCR-mediated stimulation ( Fig. 4a ). mRNA expression and the production of Th2 cytokines from in vitro -generated primary Th2 cells were strongly inhibited by the overexpression of LEF-1 ( Fig. 4b,c ). The TCR signal-mediated down-regulation of LEF-1 expression was inhibited by treatment with a MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor or a calcineurin inhibitor (M. Yamashita and T. Nakayama, unpublished observation). We previously reported that the activation of the ERK-MAPK and the Ca 2+ /calcinerurin signalling pathways upon TCR stimulation is required for the efficient development of Th2 cells. 50 , 58 Although a more comprehensive investigation is required, the TCR-mediated down-regulation of LEF-1 may be required for the induction of Th2 function, i.e. robust Th2 cytokine production upon restimulation through the TCR.

In the absence of Wnt signals, LEF-1 associates with the Groucho family co-repressor protein, and represses the LEF-1-responsive genes. 44 When the Wnt signalling pathway is activated, β-catenin is stabilized, binds to LEF-1 and transactivates the Wnt-responsive genes. In our experiments described in this report, we did not experimentally stimulate the Wnt signalling pathway. It therefore remains unclear which form of LEF-1 can bind to GATA-3. A lot of bands were detected in the precipitates ( Fig. 1a ), but we succeeded in the identification of only one band ( Fig. 1 , arrow). The identification of the other co-precipitated proteins may contribute to a better understanding of the GATA-3 complex, and the crosstalk between GATA-3 and the Wnt/β-catenin-mediated signalling pathways.

In summary, we identified LEF-1 as a component of the GATA-3 complex in T cells. The results of this study may help to elucidate a new network of transcription factors that control the activity of GATA-3 and the function of Th2 cells.
