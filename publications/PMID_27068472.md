To probe the mechanism of the Hsp90 chaperone that is required for the 
maturation of many signaling proteins in eukaryotes, we analyzed the effects of 
all individual amino acid changes in the ATPase domain on yeast growth rate. The 
sensitivity of a position to mutation was strongly influenced by proximity to 
the phosphates of ATP, indicating that ATPase-driven conformational changes 
impose stringent physical constraints on Hsp90. To investigate how these 
constraints may vary for different clients, we performed biochemical analyses on 
a panel of Hsp90 mutants spanning the full range of observed fitness effects. We 
observed distinct effects of nine Hsp90 mutations on activation of v-src and 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR), indicating that different chaperone mechanisms can 
be utilized for these clients. These results provide a detailed guide for 
understanding Hsp90 mechanism and highlight the potential for inhibitors of 
Hsp90 that target a subset of clients.
