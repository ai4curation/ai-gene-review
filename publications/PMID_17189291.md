Calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3, a neuronal Ca(2+)-binding protein, has multifunctions 
in nucleus and cytosol. Here, we identified CLN3 as a calsenilin-binding partner 
whose mutation or deletion is observed in Batten disease. In vitro binding and 
immunoprecipitation assays show that calsenilin interacts with the C-terminal 
region of CLN3 and the increase of Ca(2+) concentration in vitro and in cells 
causes significant dissociation of calsenilin from CLN3. Ectopic expression of 
CLN3 or its deletion mutant containing only the C-terminus (153-438) and capable 
of binding to calsenilin suppresses thapsigargin or A23187-induced death of 
neuronal cells. In contrast, CLN3 deletion mutant containing the N-terminus 
(1-153) or (1-263), which is frequently found in Batten disease, induces the 
perturbation of Ca(2+) transient and fails to inhibit the cell death. In 
addition, the expression of calsenilin is increased in the brain tissues of CLN3 
knock-out mice and SH-SY5Y/CLN3 knock-down cells. Down-regulation of CLN3 
expression sensitizes SH-SY5Y cells to thapsigargin or A23187. However, 
additional decrease of calsenilin expression rescues the sensitivity of 
SH-SY5Y/CLN3 knock-down cells to Ca(2+)-mediated cell death. These results 
suggest that the vulnerability of CLN3 knock-out or CLN3 deletion 
(1-153)-expressing neuronal cells to Ca(2+)-induced cell death may be mediated 
by calsenilin.
