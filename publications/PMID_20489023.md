The interactions of protein kinases and phosphatases with their regulatory 
subunits and substrates underpin cellular regulation. We identified a kinase and 
phosphatase interaction (KPI) network of 1844 interactions in budding yeast by 
mass spectrometric analysis of protein complexes. The KPI network contained many 
dense local regions of interactions that suggested new functions. Notably, the 
cell cycle phosphatase Cdc14 associated with multiple kinases that revealed 
roles for Cdc14 in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, the DNA damage 
response, and metabolism, whereas interactions of the target of rapamycin 
complex 1 (TORC1) uncovered new effector kinases in nitrogen and carbon 
metabolism. An extensive backbone of kinase-kinase interactions cross-connects 
the proteome and may serve to coordinate diverse cellular responses.
