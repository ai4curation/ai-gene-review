RNA granules have been likened to liquid droplets whose dynamics depend on the 
controlled dissolution and condensation of internal components. The molecules 
and reactions that drive these dynamics in vivo are not well understood. In this 
study, we present evidence that a group of intrinsically disordered, serine-rich 
proteins regulate the dynamics of P granules in C. elegans embryos. The MEG 
(maternal-effect germline defective) proteins are germ plasm components that are 
required redundantly for fertility. We demonstrate that MEG-1 and MEG-3 are 
substrates of the kinase MBK-2/DYRK and the phosphatase PP2A(PPTR-½). 
Phosphorylation of the MEGs promotes granule disassembly and dephosphorylation 
promotes granule assembly. Using lattice light sheet microscopy on live embryos, 
we show that GFP-tagged MEG-3 localizes to a dynamic domain that surrounds and 
penetrates each granule. We conclude that, despite their liquid-like behavior, P 
granules are non-homogeneous structures whose assembly in embryos is regulated 
by phosphorylation.
