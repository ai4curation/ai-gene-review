Cellular homeostasis is maintained by the highly organized cooperation of 
intracellular trafficking systems, including COPI, COPII, and clathrin 
complexes. COPI is a coatomer protein complex responsible for intracellular 
protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The 
importance of such intracellular transport mechanisms is underscored by the 
various disorders, including skeletal disorders such as cranio-lenticulo-sutural 
dysplasia and osteogenesis imperfect, caused by mutations in the COPII coatomer 
complex. In this article, we report a clinically recognizable craniofacial 
disorder characterized by facial dysmorphisms, severe micrognathia, rhizomelic 
shortening, microcephalic dwarfism, and mild developmental delay due to 
loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in ARCN1, which encodes the coatomer 
subunit delta of COPI. ARCN1 mutant cell lines were revealed to have endoplasmic 
reticulum stress, suggesting the involvement of ER stress response in the 
pathogenesis of this disorder. Given that ARCN1 deficiency causes defective type 
I collagen transport, reduction of collagen secretion represents the likely 
mechanism underlying the skeletal phenotype that characterizes this condition. 
Our findings demonstrate the importance of COPI-mediated transport in human 
development, including skeletogenesis and brain growth.
