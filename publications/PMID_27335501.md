A novel adaptor protein was identified by analyzing phosphotyrosine proteomes 
from membrane rafts of activated T cells. This protein showed sequence 
similarity to a well-known T cell adaptor protein, adhesion and 
degranulation-promoting adaptor protein (ADAP); therefore, the novel protein was 
designated activation-dependent, raft-recruited ADAP-like phosphoprotein (ARAP). 
Suppression of ARAP impaired the major signaling pathways downstream of the TCR. 
ARAP associated with the Src homology 2 domain of Src homology 2-containing 
leukocyte protein of 76 kDa via the phosphorylation of two YDDV motifs in 
response to TCR stimulation. ARAP also mediated integrin activation but was not 
involved in actin polymerization. The results of this study indicate that a 
novel T cell adaptor protein, ARAP, plays a unique role in T cells as a part of 
both the proximal activation signaling and inside-out signaling pathways that 
result in integrin activation and T cell adhesion.
