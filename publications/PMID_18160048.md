The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family contains key 
regulators of cellular proliferation and differentiation as well as the 
suspected oncoproteins Tal1 and Lyl1. Tal1 and Lyl1 are aberrantly 
over-expressed in leukemia as a result of chromosomal translocations, or other 
genetic or epigenetic events. Protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions 
described so far are mediated by their highly homologous bHLH domains, while 
little is known about the function of other protein domains. Hetero-dimers of 
Tal1 and Lyl1 with E2A or HEB, decrease the rate of E2A or HEB homo-dimer 
formation and are poor activators of transcription. In vitro, these 
hetero-dimers also recognize different binding sites from homo-dimer complexes, 
which may also lead to inappropriate activation or repression of promoters in 
vivo. Both mechanisms are thought to contribute to the oncogenic potential of 
Tal1 and Lyl1. Despite their bHLH structural similarity, accumulating evidence 
suggests that Tal1 and Lyl1 target different genes. This raises the possibility 
that domains flanking the bHLH region, which are distinct in the two proteins, 
may participate in target recognition. Here we report that CREB1, a 
widely-expressed transcription factor and a suspected oncogene in acute 
myelogenous leukemia (AML) was identified as a binding partner for Lyl1 but not 
for Tal1. The interaction between Lyl1 and CREB1 involves the N terminal domain 
of Lyl1 and the Q2 and KID domains of CREB1. The histone acetyl-transferases 
p300 and CBP are recruited to these complexes in the absence of CREB1 Ser 133 
phosphorylation. In the Id1 promoter, Lyl1 complexes direct transcriptional 
activation. We also found that in addition to Id1, over-expressed Lyl1 can 
activate other CREB1 target promoters such as Id3, cyclin D3, Brca1, Btg2 and 
Egr1. Moreover, approximately 50% of all gene promoters identified by ChIP-chip 
experiments were jointly occupied by CREB1 and Lyl1, further strengthening the 
association of Lyl1 with Cre binding sites. Given the newly recognized 
importance of CREB1 in AML, the ability of Lyl1 to modulate promoter responses 
to CREB1 suggests that it plays a role in the malignant phenotype by occupying 
different promoters than Tal1.
