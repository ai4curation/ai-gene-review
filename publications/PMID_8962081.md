Increased histone acetylation has been correlated with increased transcription, 
and regions of heterochromatin are generally hypoacetylated. In investigating 
the cause-and-effect relationship between histone acetylation and gene activity, 
we have characterized two yeast histone deacetylase complexes. Histone 
deacetylase-A (HDA) is an approximately 350-kDa complex that is highly sensitive 
to the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Histone deacetylase-B (HDB) is an 
approximately 600-kDa complex that is much less sensitive to trichostatin A. The 
HDA1 protein (a subunit of the HDA activity) shares sequence similarity to RPD3, 
a factor required for optimal transcription of certain yeast genes. RPD3 is 
associated with the HDB activity. HDA1 also shares similarity to three new open 
reading frames in yeast, designated HOS1, HOS2, and HOS3. We find that both hda1 
and rpd3 deletions increase acetylation levels in vivo at all sites examined in 
both core histones H3 and H4, with rpd3 deletions having a greater impact on 
histone H4 lysine positions 5 and 12. Surprisingly, both hda1 and rpd3 deletions 
increase repression at telomeric loci, which resemble heterochromatin with rpd3 
having a greater effect. In addition, rpd3 deletions retard full induction of 
the PHO5 promoter fused to the reporter lacZ. These data demonstrate that 
histone acetylation state has a role in regulating both heterochromatic 
silencing and regulated gene expression.
