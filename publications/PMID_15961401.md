The Ndc80 complex is a constituent of the outer plate of the kinetochore and 
plays a critical role in establishing the stable kinetochore-microtubule 
interactions required for chromosome segregation in mitosis. The Ndc80 complex 
is evolutionarily conserved and contains the four subunits Spc24, Spc25, Nuf2, 
and Ndc80 (whose human homologue is called Hec1). All four subunits are 
predicted to contain globular domains and extensive coiled coil regions. To gain 
an insight into the organization of the human Ndc80 complex, we reconstituted it 
using recombinant methods. The hydrodynamic properties of the recombinant Ndc80 
complex are identical to those of the endogenous HeLa cell complex and are 
consistent with a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry of the four subunits and a very 
elongated shape. Two tight Hec1-Nuf2 and Spc24-Spc25 subcomplexes, each 
stabilized by a parallel heterodimeric coiled coil, maintain this organization. 
These subcomplexes tetramerize via an interaction of the C- and N-terminal 
portions of the Hec1-Nuf2 and Spc24-Spc25 coiled coils, respectively. The 
recombinant complex displays normal kinetochore localization upon injection in 
HeLa cells and is therefore a faithful copy of the endogenous Ndc80 complex.
