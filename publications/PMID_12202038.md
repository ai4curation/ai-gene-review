Using coimmunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometry, we identify INSIG-1 as 
an ER protein that binds the sterol-sensing domain of SREBP cleavage-activating 
protein (SCAP) and facilitates retention of the SCAP/SREBP complex in the ER. In 
sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts SREBPs from ER to Golgi for proteolytic 
processing, thereby allowing SREBPs to stimulate cholesterol synthesis. Sterols 
induce binding of SCAP to INSIG-1, as determined by blue native-PAGE, and this 
is correlated with the inhibition of SCAP exit from the ER. Overexpression of 
INSIG-1 increases the sensitivity of cells to sterol-mediated inhibition of 
SREBP processing. Mutant SCAP(Y298C) fails to bind INSIG-1 and is resistant to 
sterol-mediated inhibition of ER exit. By facilitating sterol-dependent ER 
retention of SCAP, INSIG-1 plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis.
