Axl, a prototypic member of the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor family, 
is known to regulate innate immunity. In this study, we show that Axl expression 
is induced by IFN-alpha during human dendritic cell (DC) differentiation from 
monocytes (IFN/DC) and that constitutively Axl-negative, IL-4-differentiated DC 
(IL-4/DC) can be induced to up-regulate Axl by IFN-alpha. This effect is 
inhibited by TLR-dependent maturation stimuli such as LPS, poly(I:C), TLR7/8 
ligand, and CD40L. LPS-induced Axl down-regulation on the surface of human 
IFN-alpha-treated DC correlates with an increased proteolytic cleavage of Axl 
and with elevated levels of its soluble form. GM6001 and TAPI-1, general 
inhibitors of MMP and ADAM family proteases, restored Axl expression on the DC 
surface and diminished Axl shedding. Furthermore, stimulation of Axl by its 
ligand, Gas6, induced chemotaxis of human DC and rescued them from growth factor 
deprivation-induced apoptosis. Our study provides the first evidence that 
Gas6/Axl-mediated signaling regulates human DC activities, and identifies 
Gas6/Axl as a new DC chemotaxis pathway. This encourages one to explore whether 
dysregulation of this novel pathway in human DC biology is involved in 
autoimmunity characterized by high levels of IFN-alpha.
