Heat shock protein 47 kDa (Hsp47) is considered as a molecular chaperone 
essential for the correct folding of type I and type IV procollagen in the ER. 
However, the function of Hsp47 for other types of procollagen and its importance 
for chondrogenesis have never been elucidated. To examine the function of Hsp47 
in cartilage formation and endochondral ossification, we conditionally 
inactivated the Hsp47 gene in chondrocytes using Hsp47 floxed mice and mice 
carrying a chondrocyte-specific Col2a1-Cre transgene. Hsp47 conditional null 
mutant mice died just before or shortly after birth, and exhibited severe 
generalized chondrodysplasia and bone deformities with lower levels of type II 
and type XI collagen. Second-harmonic generation (SHG) analysis and electron 
microscopy revealed the accumulation of misaligned type I collagen molecules in 
the intervertebral discs and a substantial decrease in type II collagen fibers, 
respectively. Whole-mount skeletal staining showed no calcified region in the 
vertebral bodies of sacral vertebrae, and revealed that the endochondral bones 
were severely twisted and shortened. These results demonstrate that Hsp47 is 
indispensable for well-organized cartilage and normal endochondral bone 
formation.
