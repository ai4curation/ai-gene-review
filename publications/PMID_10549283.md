Germline mutations in BRCA1 confer a high risk of breast and ovarian tumors. The 
role of BRCA1 in tumor suppression is not yet understood, but both transcription 
and repair functions have been ascribed. Evidence that BRCA1 is involved in DNA 
repair stems from its association with RAD51, a homolog of the yeast protein 
involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous 
recombination. We report here that Brca1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells 
have impaired repair of chromosomal DSBs by homologous recombination. The 
relative frequencies of homologous and nonhomologous DNA integration and DSB 
repair were also altered. The results demonstrate a caretaker role for BRCA1 in 
preserving genomic integrity by promoting homologous recombination and limiting 
mutagenic nonhomologous repair processes.
