Structural studies of the extracellular and tyrosine kinase domains of the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB-1) provide considerable insight into 
facets of the receptor activation mechanism, but the contributions of other 
regions of ErbB-1 have not been ascertained. This study demonstrates that the 
intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region plays a vital role in the kinase 
activation mechanism. In the experiments described herein, the entire ErbB-1 
intracellular domain (ICD) has been expressed in mammalian cells to explore the 
significance of the JM region in kinase activity. Deletion of the JM region 
(DeltaJM) results in a severe loss of ICD tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating 
that this region is required for maximal activity of the tyrosine kinase domain. 
Coexpression of DeltaJM and dimerization-deficient kinase domain ICD mutants 
revealed that the JM region is indispensable for allosteric kinase activation 
and productive monomer interactions within a dimer. Studies with the intact 
receptor confirmed the role of the JM region in kinase activation. Within the JM 
region, Thr-654 is a known protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site that 
modulates kinase activity in the context of the intact ErbB-1 receptor; yet, the 
mechanism is not known. Whereas a T654A mutation promotes increased ICD tyrosine 
phosphorylation, the phosphomimetic T654D mutant generates a 50% reduction in 
ICD tyrosine phosphorylation. Similar to the DeltaJM mutants, the T654D mutant 
ICD failed to interact with a wild-type monomer. This study reveals an integral 
role for the intracellular JM region of ErbB-1 in allosteric kinase activation.

Abstract

Structural studies of the extracellular and tyrosine kinase domains of the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB-1) provide considerable insight into facets of the receptor activation mechanism, but the contributions of other regions of ErbB-1 have not been ascertained. This study demonstrates that the intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region plays a vital role in the kinase activation mechanism. In the experiments described herein, the entire ErbB-1 intracellular domain (ICD) has been expressed in mammalian cells to explore the significance of the JM region in kinase activity. Deletion of the JM region (ΔJM) results in a severe loss of ICD tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that this region is required for maximal activity of the tyrosine kinase domain. Coexpression of ΔJM and dimerization-deficient kinase domain ICD mutants revealed that the JM region is indispensable for allosteric kinase activation and productive monomer interactions within a dimer. Studies with the intact receptor confirmed the role of the JM region in kinase activation. Within the JM region, Thr-654 is a known protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site that modulates kinase activity in the context of the intact ErbB-1 receptor; yet, the mechanism is not known. Whereas a T654A mutation promotes increased ICD tyrosine phosphorylation, the phosphomimetic T654D mutant generates a 50% reduction in ICD tyrosine phosphorylation. Similar to the ΔJM mutants, the T654D mutant ICD failed to interact with a wild-type monomer. This study reveals an integral role for the intracellular JM region of ErbB-1 in allosteric kinase activation.

JM Deletions Result in a Significant Loss of Kinase Activity.

The preceding data suggested that phosphorylation of Thr-654 alters kinase activity by either of two mechanisms: ( i ) phosphorylation at Thr-654 promotes an autoinhibitory interaction of the JM region with the kinase domain or ( ii ) the JM region positively modulates the kinase domain and phospho-Thr-654 prevents the interaction. To test these possibilities, segments of the JM region were deleted in the ICD: Δ645–662 and Δ645–676 ( Fig. 2 A ). When expressed in cells, the data revealed that tyrosine kinase activity is decreased by ≈95% in vivo and 65% in vitro for the Δ645–662 mutant and ≈95% for the Δ645–676 mutant in vivo and in vitro ( Fig. 2 B and C ). This result demonstrates that the presence of the JM region is critical for maximal kinase activation. The difference in the level of kinase activity detected for the two JM mutants also suggests that elements in both the N-terminal half of the JM, including the basic cluster and Thr-654, and the C-terminal region participate in regulation of kinase activity. The studies of Zhang et al. ( 18 ) identify Gly-672–Ala-677 as a likely element in the C-terminal JM region that participates in kinase activation, particularly Pro-675.
