Human AP-endonuclease (APE1/Ref-1), a central enzyme involved in the repair of 
oxidative base damage and DNA strand breaks, has a second activity as a 
transcriptional regulator that binds to several trans-acting factors. APE1 
overexpression is often observed in tumor cells and confers resistance to 
various anticancer drugs; its downregulation sensitizes tumor cells to such 
agents. Because the involvement of APE1 in repairing the DNA damage induced by 
many of these drugs is unlikely, drug resistance may be linked to APE1's 
transcriptional regulatory function. Here, we show that APE1, preferably in the 
acetylated form, stably interacts with Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) and 
enhances its binding to the Y-box element, leading to the activation of the 
multidrug resistance gene MDR1. The enhanced MDR1 level due to the ectopic 
expression of wild-type APE1 but not of its nonacetylable mutant underscores the 
importance of APE1's acetylation in its coactivator function. APE1 
downregulation sensitizes MDR1-overexpressing tumor cells to cisplatin or 
doxorubicin, showing APE1's critical role in YB-1-mediated gene expression and, 
thus, drug resistance in tumor cells. A systematic increase in both APE1 and 
MDR1 expression was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer tissue samples. Thus, 
our study has established the novel role of the acetylation-mediated 
transcriptional regulatory function of APE1, making it a potential target for 
the drug sensitization of tumor cells.
