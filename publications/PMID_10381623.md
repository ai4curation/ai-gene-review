The adenovirus E1B19K protein inhibits apoptosis induced by E1A and other 
divergent signals. The cellular proteins that interact with E1B19K have been 
analyzed by isolating cDNA clones by the yeast two hybrid system. One of these 
clones encodes B5 which consists of 219 amino acid residues and contains the 
putative BH3 and transmembrane regions. B5 binds strongly to Nip3 and itself, 
weakly to E1B19K, but not to Bcl-2 and localizes in nuclear envelope, 
endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. B5 has sequence homology with Nip3 in 
the middle and C-terminal regions, but not in the N-terminal region. Unlike 
other E1B19K binding BH3 proteins so far characterized, B5 does not induce 
apoptosis, but inhibits apoptosis induced by Nip3. However the deletion mutant 
B5Delta1-31 lacking the N-terminus does induce apoptosis, although weaker than 
does Nip3, suggesting that the N-terminal region is masking the 
apoptosis-inducing capacity of B5.
