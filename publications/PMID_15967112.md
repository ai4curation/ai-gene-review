## Abstract

1. Neoplasia. 2005 Apr;7(4):348-55. doi: 10.1593/neo.04544.

In an attempt to disclose mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis and discover novel 
target molecules for the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas 
(HCCs), we previously analyzed expression profiles of HCC tissues by means of 
human cDNA microarray. Among the genes upregulated in tumor tissues compared 
with their nontumor counterparts, we focused on a novel gene, termed WDRPUH, and 
characterized its biologic function. WDRPUH encodes a predicted 620-amino acid 
protein containing 11 highly conserved WD40-repeat domains. Multiple-tissue 
Northern blot analysis revealed its specific expression in the testis among 16 
normal tissues examined. Transfection of plasmids designed to express 
WDRPUH-specific siRNA significantly reduced its expression in HCC cells and 
resulted in growth suppression of transfected cells. Interestingly, we found 
that WDRPUH associated with HSP70, proteins of the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 
(CCT1) complex, as well as BRCA2. These findings have disclosed a novel insight 
into hepatocarcinogenesis and suggested that WDRPUH may be a molecular target 
for the development of new strategies to treat HCCs.
