Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis requires nuclear import and hierarchical 
incorporation of ∼80 ribosomal proteins (RPs) into the ribosomal RNA core. In 
contrast to prokaryotes, many eukaryotic RPs possess long extensions that 
interdigitate in the mature ribosome. RpL4 is a prime example, with 
an ∼80-residue-long surface extension of unknown function. Here, we identify 
assembly chaperone Acl4 that initially binds the universally conserved internal 
loop of newly synthesized RpL4 via its superhelical TPR domain, thereby 
restricting RpL4 loop insertion at its cognate nascent rRNA site. RpL4 release 
from Acl4 is orchestrated with pre-ribosome assembly, during which the 
eukaryote-specific RpL4 extension makes several distinct interactions with the 
60S surface, including a co-evolved site on neighboring RpL18. Consequently, 
mutational inactivation of this contact site, on either RpL4 or RpL18, impairs 
RpL4-Acl4 disassembly and RpL4 pre-ribosome incorporation. We propose that 
hierarchical ribosome assembly can be achieved by eukaryotic RP extensions and 
dedicated assembly chaperones.
