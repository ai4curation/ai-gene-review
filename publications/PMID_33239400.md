Neuronal and network-level hyperexcitability is commonly associated with 
increased levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) and contribute to cognitive deficits 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanistic complexity 
underlying the selective loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), a 
well-recognized characteristic of AD, remains poorly understood. In this study, 
we tested the hypothesis that the oligomeric form of amyloid-β (oAβ42), 
interacting with α7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) 
subtypes, leads to subnucleus-specific alterations in BFCN excitability and 
impaired cognition. We used single-channel electrophysiology to show that oAβ42 
activates both homomeric α7- and heteromeric α7β2-nAChR subtypes while 
preferentially enhancing α7β2-nAChR open-dwell times. Organotypic slice cultures 
were prepared from male and female ChAT-EGFP mice, and current-clamp recordings 
obtained from BFCNs chronically exposed to pathophysiologically relevant level 
of oAβ42 showed enhanced neuronal intrinsic excitability and action potential 
firing rates. These resulted from a reduction in action potential 
afterhyperpolarization and alterations in the maximal rates of voltage change 
during spike depolarization and repolarization. These effects were observed in 
BFCNs from the medial septum diagonal band and horizontal diagonal band, but not 
the nucleus basalis. Last, aged male and female APP/PS1 transgenic mice, 
genetically null for the β2 nAChR subunit gene, showed improved spatial 
reference memory compared with APP/PS1 aged-matched littermates. Combined, these 
data provide a molecular mechanism supporting a role for α7β2-nAChR in mediating 
the effects of oAβ42 on excitability of specific populations of cholinergic 
neurons and provide a framework for understanding the role of α7β2-nAChR in 
oAβ42-induced cognitive decline.
