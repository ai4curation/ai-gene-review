FKBP38 (also known as FKBP8) is a transmembrane chaperone protein that inhibits 
apoptosis by recruiting the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) to 
mitochondria. We have now generated mice harboring a loss-of-function mutation 
in Fkbp38. The Fkbp38(-/-) mice die soon after birth manifesting defects in 
neural tube closure in the thoraco-lumbar-sacral region (spina bifida) as well 
as skeletal defects including scoliosis, rib deformities, club foot and curled 
tail. The neuroepithelium is disorganized and that formation of dorsal root 
ganglia is defective in Fkbp38(-/-) embryos, likely as a result of an increased 
frequency of apoptosis and aberrant migration of neuronal cells. Furthermore, 
the extension of nerve fibers in the spinal cord is abnormal in the mutant 
embryos. To explore the mechanisms underlying these characteristics, we screened 
for proteins that interact with FKBP38 in the yeast two-hybrid system and 
thereby identified protrudin, a protein that promotes process formation by 
regulating membrane trafficking. Protrudin was found to be hyperphosphorylated 
in the brain of Fkbp38(-/-) mice, suggesting that FKBP38 regulates 
protrudin-dependent membrane recycling and neurite outgrowth. Together, our 
findings suggest that FKBP38 is required for neuroectodermal organization during 
neural tube formation as a result of its anti-apoptotic activity and regulation 
of neurite extension.
