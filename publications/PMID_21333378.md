The actin-filament associated protein (AFAP) family of adaptor proteins consists 
of three members: AFAP1, AFAP1L1, and AFAP1L2/XB130 with AFAP1 being the best 
described as a cSrc binding partner and actin cross-linking protein. A homology 
search of AFAP1 recently identified AFAP1L1 which has a similar sequence, domain 
structure and cellular localization; however, based upon sequence variations, 
AFAP1L1 is hypothesized to have unique functions that are distinct from AFAP1. 
While AFAP1 has the ability to bind to the SH3 domain of the nonreceptor 
tyrosine kinase cSrc via an N-terminal SH3 binding motif, it was unable to bind 
cortactin. However, the SH3 binding motif of AFAP1L1 was more efficient at 
interacting with the SH3 domain of cortactin and not cSrc. AFAP1L1 was shown by 
fluorescence microscopy to decorate actin filaments and move to punctate actin 
structures and colocalize with cortactin, consistent with localization to 
invadosomes. Upon overexpression in A7r5 cells, AFAP1L1 had the ability to 
induce podosome formation and move to podosomes without stimulation. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of AFAP1L1 in human tissues shows differential 
expression when contrasted with AFAP1 with localization of AFAP1L1 to unique 
sites in muscle and the dentate nucleus of the brain where AFAP1 was not 
detectable. We hypothesize AFAP1L1 may play a similar role to AFAP1 in affecting 
changes in actin filaments and bridging interactions with binding partners, but 
we hypothesize that AFAP1L1 may forge unique protein interactions in which AFAP1 
is less efficient, and these interactions may allow AFAP1L1 to affect invadosome 
formation.
