Calmodulin (CaM) has been shown to suppress basal G protein coupling and 
attenuate agonist-stimulated G protein coupling of the mu-opioid receptor 
(OP(3)) through direct interaction with the third intracellular (i3) loop of the 
receptor. Here we have investigated the role of CaM in regulating changes in 
OP(3)-G protein coupling during morphine treatment, shown to result in CaM 
release from plasma membranes. Basal and agonist-stimulated G protein coupling 
by OP(3) was measured before and after morphine pretreatment by incorporation of 
guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thiotriphosphate) into membranes, obtained from HEK 293 
cells transfected with human OP(3) cDNA. The opioid antagonist 
beta-chlornaltrexamine fully suppressed basal G protein coupling of OP(3), 
providing a direct measure of basal signaling. Pretreatment of the cells with 
morphine enhanced basal G protein coupling (sensitization). In contrast, 
agonist-stimulated coupling was diminished (desensitization), resulting in a 
substantially flattened morphine dose-response curve. To test whether CaM is 
involved in these changes, we constructed OP(3)-i3 loop mutants with reduced 
affinity for CaM (K273A, R275A, and K273A/R275A). Basal signaling of these 
mutant OP(3) receptors was higher than that of the wild-type receptor and, 
moreover, unaffected by morphine pretreatment, whereas desensitization to 
agonist stimulation was only slightly attenuated. Therefore, CaM-OP(3) 
interactions appear to play only a minor role in the desensitization of OP(3). 
In contrast, release of CaM from the plasma membrane appears to enhance the 
inherent basal G protein coupling of OP(3), thereby resolving the paradox that 
OP(3) displays both desensitization and sensitization during morphine treatment.
