The formation of mRNPs controls the interaction of the translation and 
degradation machinery with individual mRNAs. The yeast Scd6 protein and its 
orthologs regulate translation and mRNA degradation in yeast, C. elegans, 
D. melanogaster, and humans by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that Scd6 
represses translation by binding the eIF4G subunit of eIF4F in a manner 
dependent on its RGG domain, thereby forming an mRNP repressed for translation 
initiation. Strikingly, several other RGG domain-containing proteins in yeast 
copurify with eIF4E/G and we demonstrate that two such proteins, Npl3 and Sbp1, 
also directly bind eIF4G and repress translation in a manner dependent on their 
RGG motifs. These observations identify the mechanism of Scd6 function through 
its RGG motif and indicate that eIF4G plays an important role as a scaffolding 
protein for the recruitment of translation repressors.
