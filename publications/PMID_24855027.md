Single-cell species harbor ancestral structural homologs of caspase proteases, 
although the evolutionary benefit of such apoptosis-related proteins in 
unicellular organisms is unclear. Here, we found that the yeast metacaspase Mca1 
is recruited to the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) and juxtanuclear 
quality-control compartment (JUNQ) during aging and proteostatic stress. 
Elevating MCA1 expression counteracted accumulation of unfolded proteins and 
aggregates and extended life span in a heat shock protein Hsp104 disaggregase- 
and proteasome-dependent manner. Consistent with a role in protein quality 
control, genetic interaction analysis revealed that MCA1 buffers against 
deficiencies in the Hsp40 chaperone YDJ1 in a caspase cysteine-dependent manner. 
Life-span extension and aggregate management by Mca1 was only partly dependent 
on its conserved catalytic cysteine, which suggests that Mca1 harbors both 
caspase-dependent and independent functions related to life-span control.
