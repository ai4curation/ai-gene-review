Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a severe congenital anomaly of the enteric 
nervous system (ENS) characterized by functional intestinal obstruction due to a 
lack of intrinsic innervation in the distal bowel. Distal innervation deficiency 
results from incomplete colonization of the bowel by enteric neural crest cells 
(eNCCs), the ENS precursors. Here, we report the generation of a mouse model for 
HSCR--named Holstein--that contains an untargeted transgenic insertion upstream 
of the collagen-6α4 (Col6a4) gene. This insertion induces eNCC-specific 
upregulation of Col6a4 expression that increases total collagen VI protein 
levels in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding both the developing and the 
postnatal ENS. Increased collagen VI levels during development mainly result in 
slower migration of eNCCs. This appears to be due to the fact that collagen VI 
is a poor substratum for supporting eNCC migration and can even interfere with 
the migration-promoting effects of fibronectin. Importantly, for a majority of 
patients in a HSCR cohort, the myenteric ganglia from the ganglionated region 
are also specifically surrounded by abundant collagen VI microfibrils, an 
outcome accentuated by Down syndrome. Collectively, our data thus unveil a 
clinically relevant pathogenic mechanism for HSCR that involves cell-autonomous 
changes in ECM composition surrounding eNCCs. Moreover, as COL6A1 and COL6A2 are 
on human Chr.21q, this mechanism is highly relevant to the predisposition of 
patients with Down syndrome to HSCR.

Abstract

Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) is a severe congenital anomaly of the enteric nervous system (ENS) characterized by functional intestinal obstruction due to a lack of intrinsic innervation in the distal bowel. Distal innervation deficiency results from incomplete colonization of the bowel by enteric neural crest cells (eNCCs), the ENS precursors. Here, we report the generation of a mouse model for HSCR — named Holstein — that contains an untargeted transgenic insertion upstream of the collagen-6α4 ( Col6a4 ) gene. This insertion induces eNCC-specific upregulation of Col6a4 expression that increases total collagen VI protein levels in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding both the developing and the postnatal ENS. Increased collagen VI levels during development mainly result in slower migration of eNCCs. This appears to be due to the fact that collagen VI is a poor substratum for supporting eNCC migration and can even interfere with the migration-promoting effects of fibronectin. Importantly, for a majority of patients in a HSCR cohort, the myenteric ganglia from the ganglionated region are also specifically surrounded by abundant collagen VI microfibrils, an outcome accentuated by Down syndrome. Collectively, our data thus unveil a clinically relevant pathogenic mechanism for HSCR that involves cell-autonomous changes in ECM composition surrounding eNCCs. Moreover, as COL6A1 and COL6A2 are on human Chr.21q, this mechanism is highly relevant to the predisposition of patients with Down syndrome to HSCR.

Introduction

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is located within the gut wall and is mainly composed of multiple interconnected ganglia organized into two main plexuses: the submucosal plexus and the myenteric plexus. The submucosal plexus controls mucosal functions such as electrolyte secretion, paracellular permeability, and epithelial cell proliferation, whereas the key role of the myenteric plexus is to control gastrointestinal motility independently of the central nervous system ( 1 ). The vast majority of the neuronal and glial cells that form the ENS is derived from neural crest cells (NCCs), originating from the vagal region of the neural tube. After having reached the foregut, these enteric NCCs (eNCCs) then migrate in a rostral to caudal direction to colonize the midgut and hindgut, between E9.5 and E14.5 in mice ( 2 ). In addition to eNCC migration, completion of ENS formation relies on tight control of proliferation, survival, and differentiation of these cells ( 3 , 4 ). Accordingly, alteration of any of these events can lead to gut motility disorders such as Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) ( 5 – 7 ).

HSCR is a complex genetic disease that has a global incidence of 1 in 5,000 human births and is characterized by the absence of neural ganglia in the distal gut, from the anus up to a variable length of the intestines. In the majority of cases (80%), the aganglionic zone consists of the rectum and sigmoid colon only (short-segment HSCR), whereas, for most of the remaining cases, it extends toward the proximal end of the colon (long-segment HSCR) ( 8 ). Among the numerous genes that have been associated with HSCR ( 7 ), the main ones encode members of two key signaling pathways: GDNF/RET and EDN3/EDNRB. Extensive characterization of mouse models bearing loss-of-function alleles of these genes has shown that both of these pathways regulate migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation of eNCCs ( 4 , 9 ). However, mutations in these genes or in any other known gene collectively account for less than one-third of HSCR cases ( 10 ). In particular, both the 4:1 male sex bias and the strong association with trisomy 21 are intriguing hallmarks of HSCR that currently remain poorly understood, although candidate genes have been suggested ( 11 – 15 ).

The composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is another important factor that can influence gut colonization by eNCCs and might thus contribute to HSCR pathogenesis. The ECM is a 3-dimensional acellular structure composed of tissue-specific combinations of a large number of collagens, proteoglycans (e.g., decorin and versican), and glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, laminins, and tenascins) ( 16 ). In addition to their well-known scaffolding roles ( 17 ), ECM proteins can influence cell behavior (i.e., migration, proliferation, survival, and/or differentiation) by interacting with either secreted ligands or transmembrane receptors ( 18 ). With respect to eNCCs, such ECM function has been clearly demonstrated by the analysis of NCC-specific Itgb1 -null mice ( 19 , 20 ). Indeed, this work revealed that, without β 1 integrin–mediated interactions with ECM proteins, eNCCs fail to fully colonize the hindgut ( 20 ), at least in part, because they cannot interact with migration-promoting fibronectin ( 19 ). Intriguingly, this latter study also revealed that tenascin-C has an opposite effect on eNCCs (i.e., inhibits migration), whereas another group reported that cell-autonomous production of tenascin-C by eNCCs promotes their migration in chicken embryos ( 21 ). In addition to potential species-specific differences ( 22 ), these apparent conflicting results might be explained by the fact that different combinations of ECM proteins were used in these ex vivo studies (i.e., tenascin-C with vitronectin and tenascin-C with or without fibronectin, respectively). Although both results suggest that the composition of the ECM is critical for eNCC migration, this has never been assessed in vivo.

Collagens, with 28 different types forming 8 different classes, are the most abundant proteins of the ECM ( 18 ). Among these, collagen type VI proteins constitute the highly specific filamentous class. Like every collagen type, collagen VI proteins are first assembled as a trimeric monomer, comprising, in this case, 3 different polypeptide α chains. These trimeric monomers then form antiparallel dimers, which are then laterally associated into tetramers that are secreted in order to form extracellular microfibrils ( 23 ). Each collagen VI trimeric monomer is believed to be composed of the α1-α2 pair, to which is added any one of the structurally related α3, α4, α5, or α6 chains ( 24 , 25 ). These α chains are encoded by individual genes that can be regrouped into “classical” (collagen-6α1–collagen-6α3 [ Col6a1 – Col6a3 ]) and “novel” ( Col6a4 – Col6a6 ) sets ( 25 , 26 ). Col6a1 and Col6a2 form a gene cluster located on Chr.10C1 in mice and on Chr.21q22 in humans, while Col6a4 , Col6a5 , and Col6a6 form a second gene cluster located on Chr.9F1 in mice and on Chr.3q22 in humans. Col6a3 is located independently on Chr.1D in mice and on Chr.2q37 in humans. Of note, in contrast to its murine ortholog, the human COL6A4 gene has been converted into 2 nonprocessed pseudogenes COL6A4P1 and COL6A4P2 , by a chromosomal break ( 25 , 26 ).

Expression analyses in embryonic and postnatal gastrointestinal tissues — at both mRNA and protein levels — indicate that, in contrast to the very broad expression of the α1/α2/α3 subunits, expression of the “novel” subunits appears limited to the α4 (embryonic and postnatal) and α5 (postnatal) subunits and in a much more restricted manner ( 27 ). During ENS formation, the α4 subunit is notably found distributed within the gut wall, with an internal high to external low radial gradient of expression ( 27 ). Moreover, recent transcriptome analyses have revealed that eNCCs express high levels of Col6a1 , Col6a2 , and Col6a3 and low levels of Col6a4 but do not express Col6a5 and Col6a6 ( 11 ).

Apart from playing key structural roles ( 28 – 32 ), collagen VI has also been reported to influence cell migration, at least in part, via fibronectin-dependent means ( 33 – 35 ). Regarding NCCs, it has been shown in vitro that their adhesion and initial migration from cultured neural tubes is similarly stimulated by collagen VI and fibronectin ( 34 ). On the other hand, in the bowel, it has been shown that epithelial cells are a major site of collagen VI production and that COL6A1 knockdown in human intestinal epithelial cells stimulates cell spreading, adhesion, and migration, most likely via increased expression and deposition of fibronectin ( 33 ). This work further revealed that collagen VI and fibronectin are closely codistributed around cultured intestinal epithelial cells and that lack of collagen VI affects the microfibrillar organization of fibronectin, an outcome also previously reported by others in cultured fibroblasts ( 35 ) and which is in accordance with the fact that collagen VI can bind fibronectin ( 35 – 37 ). To the best of our knowledge, neither the specific role of collagen VI on eNCC migration nor the general consequence of overexpressing collagen VI has been reported so far.

In this work, we report the generation and characterization of what we believe to be a novel insertional mutant mouse line, in which eNCCs specifically overexpress Col6a4 . We show that increased cell-autonomous deposition of collagen VI around mutant eNCCs inhibits their migration, most likely by interfering with fibronectin, and thereby leads to an aganglionic megacolon phenotype reminiscent of short-segment HSCR. Analysis of the ganglionated regions of patients with short-segment HSCR with and without Down syndrome strongly suggests that this pathogenic mechanism that we believe to be novel is common and, combined with the fact that COL6A1 and COL6A2 are located on Chr.21q, may provide a mechanistic explanation for the strong association between trisomy 21 and HSCR.

Discussion

In this study, we report the generation and characterization of a mouse model for short-segment HSCR called Holstein. The distinctive feature of this model is the eNCC-specific overexpression of Col6a4 , which encodes a major component of the ECM. Detailed analysis of Hol Tg/Tg eNCCs during gut colonization allowed us to identify a pathogenic mechanism for HSCR involving cell-autonomous modulation of the eNCC microenvironment. Analysis of patient tissues indicated that this mechanism appears to be common and is even more pronounced in patients who also have Down syndrome. Therefore, combined with the fact that the genes encoding the key subunits for collagen VI assembly are located on human Chr.21q, this allows us to propose a possible molecular explanation for the strong association between Down syndrome and HSCR.

Conclusion.

Our previous analysis of the TashT line showed that, among several pathways and processes affected, the mutant eNCCs were notably found to impose major changes on the composition of their own ECM, including increased collagen VI levels ( 11 ). With the Holstein line, we now demonstrate that the single alteration of collagen VI levels in the ECM surrounding eNCCs is enough by itself to cause aganglionosis. This cumulative work suggests that the ECM of the gut wall is a major player in ENS formation. Targeting this previously overlooked aspect of ENS development could have clinical relevance for the cell-based therapies currently being developed for treatment of enteric neuropathies ( 65 ).
