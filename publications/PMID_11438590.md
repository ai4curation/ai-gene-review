Factors that regulate terminal arbor size of substantia nigra pars compacta 
(SNpc) neurons during development and after injury are not well understood. This 
study examined the role of dopamine receptors in regulating arbor size. Terminal 
arbors were examined in mice with targeted deletion of the D1 or D2 dopamine 
receptor [D1(-/-) and D2(-/-) mice, respectively]. Terminal trees were also 
examined after treatment with receptor blockers and after partial SNpc lesions. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed, and the number of SNpc neurons and 
dopaminergic terminals in the striatum was estimated. The number of dopaminergic 
SNpc neurons were reduced in D1(-/-) and D2(-/-) mice. Density of dopaminergic 
terminals was unchanged in D1(-/-) mice and increased in D2 (-/-) mice. 
Steady-state striatal DA and DOPAC levels revealed that dopamine activity was 
enhanced in D2(-/-) mice but reduced in D1(-/-) mice. Two months after partial 
SNpc lesions, striatal terminal density was normal in both wild-type and D1(-/-) 
mice but reduced in D2(-/-) mice. Administration of DA receptor antagonists 
resulted in larger terminal arbors in D1(-/-) and wild-type mice, whereas 
D2(-/-) mice showed no change in terminal density. Functional blockade of the 
D2R during development or in the adult brain results in increased axonal 
sprouting. Partial SNpc lesions resulted in compensatory sprouting, only in mice 
with functional D2R. These results suggest that individual dopaminergic axons in 
D2(-/-) mice have reached maximal arbor size. We conclude that the D2 receptor 
may play a role in modulating the extent of the terminal arbor of SNpc neurons.
