Modulation of NF-κB-dependent responses is critical to the success of 
attaching/effacing (A/E) human pathogenic E. coli (EPEC and EHEC) and the 
natural mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. NleB, a highly conserved type III 
secretion system effector of A/E pathogens, suppresses NF-κB activation, but the 
underlying mechanisms are unknown. We identified the mammalian glycolysis enzyme 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an NleB-interacting protein. 
Further, we discovered that GAPDH interacts with the TNF receptor-associated 
factor 2 (TRAF2), a protein required for TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation, and 
regulates TRAF2 polyubiquitination. During infection, NleB functions as a 
translocated N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase that modifies GAPDH. 
NleB-mediated GAPDH O-GlcNAcylation disrupts the TRAF2-GAPDH interaction to 
suppress TRAF2 polyubiquitination and NF-κB activation. Eliminating NleB 
O-GlcNAcylation activity attenuates C. rodentium colonization of mice. These 
data identify GAPDH as a TRAF2 signaling cofactor and reveal a virulence 
strategy employed by A/E pathogens to inhibit NF-κB-dependent host innate immune 
responses.

Introduction

Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are attaching/effacing (A/E) pathogens that are especially detrimental to human health because they cause hemorrhagic colitis and a type of renal failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome; HUS) for which therapy is limited. A related E. coli virotype, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), is an important cause of infantile diarrhea. These human pathogens, as well as Citrobacter rodentium , a mouse pathogen that shares virulence strategies with E. coli ( Deng et al., 2003 ), translocate virulence proteins (effectors) into intestinal epithelial cells using a type III secretion system (T3SS) to subvert the activity of various cell functions ( Dean and Kenny, 2009 ).

E. coli and C. rodentium T3SS effectors modulate the innate immune system, including host responses regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB, via several different mechanisms ( Rahman and McFadden, 2011 ). The NleB effector is highly conserved among the A/E pathogens ( Kelly et al., 2006 ). NleB-deficient C. rodentium do not cause mortality ( Wickham et al., 2007 ) or significant colonic hyperplasia ( Kelly et al., 2006 ) in mice. These bacteria show markedly reduced colonization, as compared with wild-type (WT) C. rodentium , indicating the importance of NleB to C. rodentium virulence. NleB is associated with human EHEC outbreaks and the subsequent development of HUS ( Wickham et al., 2006 ). The presence of NleB in atypical EPEC strains is associated with diarrheal disease ( Bugarel et al., 2010 ). Thus, NleB plays an important role in the virulence of A/E pathogens. Two recent studies determined that NleB suppresses NF-κB activation ( Nadler et al., 2010 , Newton et al., 2010 ).

Here, we characterize a mechanism by which NleB inhibits NF-κB signaling. NleB functions as a translocated N -acetyl-D-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc)-transferase that modifies the mammalian glycolysis enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). We provide evidence that GAPDH is a co-activator of the TNF receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and that NleB-mediated GAPDH O-GlcNAcylation inhibits both TRAF2 activation and downstream NF-κB signaling.

Discussion

Several studies have suggested GAPDH may be involved in regulating innate immunity. GAPDH is enriched with the NF-κB family member c-Rel and with other NF-κB signaling molecules ( Bouwmeester et al., 2004 ). Mookherjee et al also predicted that GAPDH interacts with molecules in the NF-κB pathway ( Mookherjee et al., 2009 ). GAPDH binding to TRAF2 was enhanced under stress conditions, similar to the interaction between Siah1 and GAPDH ( Hara et al., 2005 ). Our data suggest that GAPDH may be a co-activator of TRAF2, perhaps acting at an early step in the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway, before E1 and E2 enzymes are recruited to TRAF2. How GAPDH facilitates TRAF2 polyubiquitination is unknown and will require significant future structure-function experiments. We raise the possibility that there may be a network of factors recruited to TRAF2 upon TNFR stimulation that is important to regulating TRAF2 activation, among these, GAPDH.

While TNF activates the NF-κB, p38, and JNK signaling pathways through TRAF2, the role of TRAF2 ubiquitination is more essential to downstream JNK, than to either p38 or NF-κB signaling ( Habelhah et al., 2004 ), possibly due to the redundant role of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in NF-κB activation ( Tada et al., 2001 , Yeh et al., 1997 ). Our data show that GAPDH-mediated TRAF2 ubiquitination is required for NF-κB activation, but not for JNK and p38 activation. GAPDH may catalyze a specific form of TRAF2 ubiquitination or may promote a different modification that somehow enhances the TRAF2 polyubiquitination activity required for downstream NF-κB activation.

We found that the GAPDH C150 residue is essential to the GAPDH-TRAF2 interaction. This is consistent with previous work, which also showed that C150 is involved in the GAPDH activities that are independent of glycolysis ( Hara et al., 2005 ). Although it is not clear how C150 contributes to GAPDH involvement in these processes, this active site residue is redox-sensitive and is often modified under stress conditions.

Various studies have also shown that cellular signaling and protein glycosylation are tightly linked ( Wellen and Thompson, 2012 ). O-GlcNAcylation requires UDP-GlcNAc, the final product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Evidence that O-GlcNAcylation is important in regulating immune signaling pathways is emerging. Enhanced glucose metabolism induces O-GlcNAcylation of NF-κB components and increases NF-κB activity ( Kawauchi et al., 2009 , Yang et al., 2008 ). For example, O-GlcNAcylation of TAB1 after IL-1β stimulation is essential for TAK1 activation and NF-κB activation ( Pathak et al., 2012 ). In agreement with these studies, we found that inhibiting OGA increased NF-κB activity after TNF stimulation.

We showed that GAPDH is O-GlcNAcylated by the T3SS effector NleB, a glycogenin-related glycosyltransferase. O-GlcNAcylated GAPDH fails to interact with TRAF2 in vivo . GAPDH O-GlcNAcylation by OGT on T227 has been reported before ( Park et al., 2009 ). However, we did not detect OGT-mediated GAPDH O-GlcNAcylation under our experimental conditions. We are currently identifying NleB-mediated O-GlcNAcylation site(s) on GAPDH to clarify the precise mechanism by which GAPDH functions in the NF-κB signaling pathway.

We have considered the possibility that NleB activity could be somehow coordinated with changes to host cell metabolism associated with infection ( Borregaard and Herlin, 1982 , Cramer et al., 2003 ). However, our preliminary efforts to address this complex issue indicated that NleB-mediated GAPDH O-GlcNAcylation is largely insensitive to different glucose concentrations, likely due to the maintenance of relatively high concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc. Therefore, NleB does not appear to share the same mechanism as OGT, which by contrast, is sensitive to glucose concentrations ( Hart et al., 2011 ). However, inhibiting OGA with TMG augmented GAPDH O-GlcNAcylation by NleB, leaving open the possibility that NleB co-ordinately regulates protein O-GlcNAcylation in concert with the mammalian enzymes OGT and OGA.

Clostridial toxins glucosylate and inhibit GTPases of the Rho and Ras superfamily ( Kelly and LaMont, 2008 ). Legionella pneumophila Lgt proteins glucosylate the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A to block protein synthesis ( Belyi et al., 2006 ). Like NleB, these toxins all belong to GT-A family of glycosyltransferases and contain at least one Rossmann-like fold and the DXD catalytic motif. We have yet to characterize the substrate specificity of NleB and it is possible that NleB may be able to utilize other nucleotide sugars to glycosylate GAPDH. It remains to be determined if NleB interacts with other host proteins, and if so, whether NleB O-GlcNAcylates these proteins. We note that several other proteins detected in GAPDH immunoprecipitates appear to be more heavily O-GlcNAcylated in the presence, than in the absence, of NleB ( Fig. 5D ).

The difference in colonization magnitude between the Δ nleB strain and Δ nleB /p nleB (AAA) is not unexpected. NleB contains an additional DAD motif in its N-terminus, which could also contribute to the ability of NleB to control TNF-induced NF-κB activity. It will be interesting to examine the contribution of other NleB functional domains to bacterial virulence. It is also possible that NleB has functions that are independent of its glycosyltransferase activity and its targeting of the NF-κB pathway.

The impact of NleB on NF-κB is tightly linked with its O-GlcNAc transferase activity directed against GAPDH. GAPDH fails to interact with TRAF2 in the presence of NleB, resulting in attenuated TRAF2 polyubiquitination. This is similar to the phenotype of cells expressing GAPDH C150S, which also fails to bind TRAF2 and fails to promote TRAF2 polyubiquitination. Furthermore, the NleB(AAA) mutant is unable to O-GlcNAcylate GAPDH and does not inhibit NF-κB activation. Our discovery that NleB utilizes UDP-GlcNAc to disrupt TRAF2 complex formation represents a mechanism by which enteric pathogens inhibit host innate immunity.
