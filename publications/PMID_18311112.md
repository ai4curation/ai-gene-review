Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer correlates with overall 
prognosis and disease progression after androgen-deprivation therapy, although 
its specific mechanisms are currently poorly understood. A role of Notch pathway 
has been reported in determining neuroendocrine phenotype of normal and 
neoplastic tissues. The aim of this study was to analyze whether this pathway 
might affect neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer. Human 
achaete-scute homolog 1 (hASH1), a pivotal member of the Notch pathway, was 
investigated in 80 prostate cancers selected and grouped according to 
chromogranin A immunohistochemistry, as follows: prostate cancers without 
neuroendocrine differentiation, untreated (25 cases); prostate cancers with 
neuroendocrine differentiation, untreated (40 cases); prostate cancers with 
previous androgen-deprivation therapy, all having neuroendocrine differentiation 
(15 cases). Human ASH1 protein was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, whereas the 
presence of hASH1 mRNA transcripts was investigated on paraffin material by 
real-time PCR. By immunohistochemistry, hASH1 was colocalized with chromogranin 
A in neuroendocrine cells of normal prostatic gland. It was absent in all but 
one prostate cancers without neuroendocrine differentiation, whereas it was 
positive in 25% of prostate cancers with neuroendocrine 
differentiation/untreated, with a significant correlation with the extent of 
neuroendocrine features (P=0.02). Moreover, comparing untreated and treated 
prostate cancers with neuroendocrine differentiation, a positive association 
with androgen-deprivation therapy was observed (P=0.01). In prostate cancers 
with neuroendocrine differentiation, RNA analysis confirmed the association of 
higher transcript levels in androgen deprivation-treated compared with untreated 
patients (P=0.01). In addition, hASH1 mRNA analysis in microdissected 
chromogranin A-positive and chromogranin A-negative areas within the same tumor 
demonstrated a two- to sevenfold increase of hASH1 mRNA expression in 
chromogranin A-positive tumor cell populations.
