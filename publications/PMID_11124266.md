In Caenorhabditis elegans, an insulin-like signaling pathway to 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and AKT negatively regulates the 
activity of DAF-16, a Forkhead transcription factor. We show that in mammalian 
cells, C. elegans DAF-16 is a direct target of AKT and that AKT phosphorylation 
generates 14-3-3 binding sites and regulates the nuclear/cytoplasmic 
distribution of DAF-16 as previously shown for its mammalian homologs FKHR and 
FKHRL1. In vitro, interaction of AKT- phosphorylated DAF-16 with 14-3-3 prevents 
DAF-16 binding to its target site in the insulin-like growth factor binding 
protein-1 gene, the insulin response element. In HepG2 cells, insulin signaling 
to PI 3-kinase/AKT inhibits the ability of a GAL4 DNA binding domain/DAF-16 
fusion protein to activate transcription via the insulin-like growth factor 
binding protein-1-insulin response element, but not the GAL4 DNA binding site, 
which suggests that insulin inhibits the interaction of DAF-16 with its cognate 
DNA site. Elimination of the DAF-16/1433 association by mutation of the 
AKT/14-3-3 sites in DAF-16, prevents 14-3-3 inhibition of DAF-16 DNA binding and 
insulin inhibition of DAF-16 function. Similarly, inhibition of the 
DAF-16/14-3-3 association by exposure of cells to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor 
LY294002, enhances DAF-16 DNA binding and transcription activity. Surprisingly 
constitutively nuclear DAF-16 mutants that lack AKT/14-3-3 binding sites also 
show enhanced DNA binding and transcription activity in response to LY294002, 
pointing to a 14-3-3-independent mode of regulation. Thus, our results 
demonstrate at least two mechanisms, one 14-3-3-dependent and the other 
14-3-3-independent, whereby PI 3-kinase signaling regulates DAF-16 DNA binding 
and transcription function.
