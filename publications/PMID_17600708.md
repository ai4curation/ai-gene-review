Brassinosteroids (BRs) are phytosteroid hormones controlling various 
physiological processes critical for normal growth and development. BRs are 
perceived by a protein complex containing two transmembrane receptor kinases, 
BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 
(BAK1) [1-3]. BRI1 null mutants exhibit a dwarfed stature with epinastic leaves, 
delayed senescence, reduced male fertility, and altered light responses. BAK1 
null mutants, however, only show a subtle phenotype, suggesting that 
functionally redundant proteins might be present in the Arabidopsis genome. Here 
we report that BAK1-LIKE 1 (BKK1) functions redundantly with BAK1 in regulating 
BR signaling. Surprisingly, rather than the expected bri1-like phenotype, bak1 
bkk1 double mutants exhibit a seedling-lethality phenotype due to constitutive 
defense-gene expression, callose deposition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
accumulation, and spontaneous cell death even under sterile growing conditions. 
Our detailed analyses demonstrate that BAK1 and BKK1 have dual physiological 
roles: positively regulating a BR-dependent plant growth pathway, and negatively 
regulating a BR-independent cell-death pathway. Both BR signaling and 
developmentally controlled cell death are critical to optimal plant growth and 
development, but the mechanisms regulating early events in these pathways are 
poorly understood. This study provides novel insights into the initiation and 
crosstalk of the two signaling cascades.
