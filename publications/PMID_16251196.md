Mutations in the CLN3 gene, which encodes a lysosomal membrane protein, are 
responsible for the neurodegenerative disorder juvenile Batten disease. A 
previous study on the yeast homolog to CLN3, designated Btn1p, revealed a 
potential role for CLN3 in the transport of arginine into the yeast vacuole, the 
equivalent organelle to the mammalian lysosome. Lysosomes isolated from 
lymphoblast cell lines, established from individuals with juvenile Batten 
disease-bearing mutations in CLN3, but not age-matched controls, demonstrate 
defective transport of arginine. Furthermore, we show that there is a depletion 
of arginine in cells derived from individuals with juvenile Batten disease. We 
have, therefore, characterized lysosomal arginine transport in normal lysosomes 
and show that it is ATP-, v-ATPase- and cationic-dependent. This and previous 
studies have shown that both arginine and lysine are transported by the same 
transport system, designated system c. However, we report that lysosomes 
isolated from juvenile Batten disease lymphoblasts are only defective for 
arginine transport. These results suggest that the CLN3 defect in juvenile 
Batten disease may affect how intracellular levels of arginine are regulated or 
distributed throughout the cell. This assertion is supported by two other 
experimental approaches. First, an antibody to CLN3 can block lysosomal arginine 
transport and second, expression of CLN3 in JNCL cells using a lentiviral vector 
can restore lysosomal arginine transport. CLN3 may have a role in regulating 
intracellular levels of arginine possibly through control of the transport of 
this amino acid into lysosomes.
