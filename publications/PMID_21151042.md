The proapoptotic Bcl2 homology domain 3(BH3)-only protein Bim is controlled by 
stringent post-translational regulation, predominantly through alterations in 
phosphorylation status. To identify new kinases involved in its regulation, we 
carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using a non-spliceable variant of the 
predominant isoform--Bim(EL)--as the bait and identified the regulatory subunit 
of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase A--PRKAR1A--as an interacting partner. We 
also show that protein kinase A (PKA) is a Bim(EL) isoform-specific kinase that 
promotes its stabilization. Inhibition of PKA or mutation of the PKA 
phosphorylation site within Bim(EL) resulted in its accelerated 
proteasome-dependent degradation. These results might have implications for 
human diseases that are characterized by abnormally increased PKA activity, such 
as the Carney complex and dilated cardiomyopathy.
