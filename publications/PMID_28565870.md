The present study aimed to investigate the expression of complement component 1, 
q subcomponent-binding protein (C1QBP) in colon cancer cells, and identify 
proteins that interact with C1QBP. Total proteins were extracted from both the 
tumor and normal tissues of 22 patients with colon cancer and analyzed using 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify proteins that were 
differentially-expressed in tumor tissues. C1QBP overexpression was induced in 
293T cells using a pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector. Overexpressed FLAG-tagged C1QBP 
protein was then immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies and 
C1QBP-interacting proteins were screened using LC-MS analysis of the 
immunoprecipitates. The C1QBP-interacting proteins were confirmed using 
reverse-immunoprecipitation and the differential expression of C1QBP in tissues 
and cell lines was confirmed using western blot analysis. LC-MS analysis 
revealed that C1QBP exhibited a typical tumor expression pattern. Two 
immune-reactive signals (33 and 14 kDa) were detected in normal and tumor 
tissues from 19 patients. Furthermore, 14 kDa C1QBP protein was upregulated in 
the tumors of 15 patients. In total, 39 proteins were identified as candidate 
C1QBP-interacting proteins, and an interaction between C1QBP and apolipoprotein 
A-I was confirmed. The present study indicates that C1QBP is involved in colon 
cancer carcinogenesis, and that the mechanisms underlying the established 
anti-tumor properties of apolipoprotein A-I may include interacting with and 
inhibiting the activity of C1QBP.
