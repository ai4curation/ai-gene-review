RGS-GAIP (Galpha-interacting protein) is a member of the RGS (regulator of G 
protein signaling) family of proteins that functions to down-regulate 
Galphai/Galphaq-linked signaling. GAIP is a GAP or guanosine 
triphosphatase-activating protein that was initially discovered by virtue of its 
ability to bind to the heterotrimeric G protein Galphai3, which is found on both 
the plasma membrane (PM) and Golgi membranes. Previously, we demonstrated that, 
in contrast to most other GAPs, GAIP is membrane anchored and palmitoylated. In 
this work we used cell fractionation and immunocytochemistry to determine with 
what particular membranes GAIP is associated. In pituitary cells we found that 
GAIP fractionated with intracellular membranes, not the PM; by immunogold 
labeling GAIP was found on clathrin-coated buds or vesicles (CCVs) in the Golgi 
region. In rat liver GAIP was concentrated in vesicular carrier fractions; it 
was not found in either Golgi- or PM-enriched fractions. By immunogold labeling 
it was detected on clathrin-coated pits or CCVs located near the sinusoidal PM. 
These results suggest that GAIP may be associated with both TGN-derived and 
PM-derived CCVs. GAIP represents the first GAP found on CCVs or any other 
intracellular membranes. The presence of GAIP on CCVs suggests a model whereby a 
GAP is separated in space from its target G protein with the two coming into 
contact at the time of vesicle fusion.
