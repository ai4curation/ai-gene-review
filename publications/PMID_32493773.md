ATP11C, a member of the P4-ATPase flippase, translocates phosphatidylserine from 
the outer to the inner plasma membrane leaflet, and maintains the asymmetric 
distribution of phosphatidylserine in the living cell. We present the crystal 
structures of a human plasma membrane flippase, ATP11C-CDC50A complex, in a 
stabilized E2P conformation. The structure revealed a deep longitudinal crevice 
along transmembrane helices continuing from the cell surface to the phospholipid 
occlusion site in the middle of the membrane. We observed that the extension of 
the crevice on the exoplasmic side is open, and the complex is therefore in an 
outward-open E2P state, similar to a recently reported cryo-EM structure of 
yeast flippase Drs2p-Cdc50p complex. We noted extra densities, most likely bound 
phosphatidylserines, in the crevice and in its extension to the extracellular 
side. One was close to the phosphatidylserine occlusion site as previously 
reported for the human ATP8A1-CDC50A complex, and the other in a cavity at the 
surface of the exoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer. Substitutions in either of the 
binding sites or along the path between them impaired specific ATPase and 
transport activities. These results provide evidence that the observed crevice 
is the conduit along that phosphatidylserine traverses from the outer leaflet to 
its occlusion site in the membrane and suggest that the exoplasmic cavity is 
important for phospholipid recognition. They also yield insights into how 
phosphatidylserine is incorporated from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane 
into the transmembrane.
