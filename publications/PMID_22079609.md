Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive and aggressive primary brain 
tumour in which loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 
10 (PTEN), a negative regulator of PI3K signalling, is a common feature. 
PTEN/PI3K/Akt signalling is involved in the regulation of proliferation, 
apoptosis and cell migration. Deregulation of PI3K signalling is considered an 
essential driver in gliomagenesis. However, the role of different PI3K isoforms 
in glioma is still largely unclear. Here we show that the catalytic PI3K isoform 
p110δ is consistently expressed at a high level in various glioma cell lines. We 
used small interfering RNA to selectively deplete p110δ and to determine its 
tumourigenic roles in PTEN-deficient cells. Interestingly, knockdown of p110δ 
decreased the cell migration and invasion ability of all GBM cell lines tested. 
Mechanistically, p110δ knockdown reduced the protein levels of focal adhesion 
kinase and cell division cycle 42, key regulators of cellular migration. In 
contrast, pharmacologic inhibition of p110δ by IC87114 or CAL-101 also clearly 
impaired glioma cell migration but had no obvious effect on the invasion 
capacity thus pinpointing to possible kinase-dependent and -independent roles of 
p110δ in glioma pathology. In summary, our data provide novel evidence that in 
glioma cells p110δ is a key regulator of cell movement and thus may contribute 
to the highly invasive phenotype of GBM. Isoform specific targeting of PI3Kδ may 
be beneficial in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme by specifically 
inhibiting tumour cell migration capacity.
