Abstract

The redox state of the neural progenitors regulates physiological processes such as neuronal differentiation and dendritic and axonal growth. The relevance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated oxidoreductases in these processes is largely unexplored. We describe a severe neurological disorder caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in thioredoxin (TRX)-related transmembrane-2 ( TMX2 ); these variants were detected by exome sequencing in 14 affected individuals from ten unrelated families presenting with congenital microcephaly, cortical polymicrogyria, and other migration disorders. TMX2 encodes one of the five TMX proteins of the protein disulfide isomerase family, hitherto not linked to human developmental brain disease. Our mechanistic studies on protein function show that TMX2 localizes to the ER mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), is involved in posttranslational modification and protein folding, and undergoes physical interaction with the MAM-associated and ER folding chaperone calnexin and ER calcium pump SERCA2. These interactions are functionally relevant because TMX2 -deficient fibroblasts show decreased mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity and compensatory increased glycolytic activity. Intriguingly, under basal conditions TMX2 occurs in both reduced and oxidized monomeric form, while it forms a stable dimer under treatment with hydrogen peroxide, recently recognized as a signaling molecule in neural morphogenesis and axonal pathfinding. Exogenous expression of the pathogenic TMX2 variants or of variants with an in vitro mutagenized TRX domain induces a constitutive TMX2 polymerization, mimicking an increased oxidative state. Altogether these data uncover TMX2 as a sensor in the MAM-regulated redox signaling pathway and identify it as a key adaptive regulator of neuronal proliferation, migration, and organization in the developing brain.

Introduction

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is responsible for the folding of one third of the human proteome. Protein folding is coordinated by ER chaperones, together with ER oxidoreductases of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family. 1 This family consists of 23 oxidoreductase proteins 2 and is part of the thioredoxin (TRX) superfamily. 3 PDIs are characterized by the presence of at least one TRX-like domain (potentially catalytically active with a sequence including two cysteines, C-X-X-C) and an ER retention domain (typically Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu/KDEL). 3 , 4 In the oxidizing environment of the ER, PDIs with active site cysteines can oxidize thiol groups of newly synthesized polypeptides mediating protein folding, 2 , 5 but they can also catalyze reduction and isomerization of disulfides in misfolded proteins, facilitating ER-associated degradation (ERAD) during the unfolded protein response (UPR). 6

PDI-mediated protein folding is ATP dependent and relies on precise regulation of calcium influx to the mitochondria, necessary for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. 1 , 7 Because the ER is the major storage site for calcium, specialized ion channels, e.g., sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase ATP2A2/SERCA2, inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1), and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 (VDAC1), are located at the mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) of the ER to assure proper calcium transport to and from the ER. 1 Besides regulating protein folding, some PDI oxidoreductases additionally function in calcium trafficking through interaction with these ER calcium channels. 1 , 8 , 9 Accordingly, some PDIs show enriched ER localization at the MAM. 10 Through upregulation of calcium transport into the mitochondria, PDIs are also able to regulate ATP production, which is necessary to increase folding mechanisms when misfolded proteins aggregate (ER-stress). 1 , 7 , 11 Hence, PDIs and protein folding are important determinants for normal mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell survival.

In humans, altered expression of PDIs has been correlated with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 12 However, notwithstanding their proven biological relevance, little is known about the consequence of inherited pathogenic variants in PDIs. At the moment of writing, only one heterozygous recurrent P4HB variant (OMIM: 176790 ) (Prolyl 4-hydroxylase, β-subunit) encoding PDIA1 has been associated with Cole-Carpenter syndrome 1 (OMIM: 112240 ), characterized by skeletal malformations (OMIM: 176790 ). 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 Pathogenic variants in non-PDI oxidoreductases from other protein families, e.g., WWOX (OMIM: 605131 ), 16 DHCR24 (OMIM: 606418 ), 17 and NDUFS1 (OMIM: 157655 ), 18 and variants in MAM-associated genes, e.g., SERAC1 (OMIM: 614725 ) 19 and MFN2 (OMIM: 608507 ), 20 have been linked to neurodevelopmental and mitochondrial disorders.

Thioredoxin (TRX)-related transmembrane proteins (TMX) are five type 1 transmembrane proteins belonging to the PDI family. 2 , 3 , 21 The best studied of the group, TMX1 (PDIA11), is localized at the MAM and regulates calcium trafficking through interaction with the ER calcium pump SERCA2. 1 , 7 No pathogenic variants have been reported in TMX members in relation to human disease until now, although two missense variants of unknown significance in TMX3 were proposed to lead to microphthalmia. 22 TMX2 (PDIA12), one of the least studied of the group, is encoded by TMX2 on chromosome 11q12.1 (OMIM: 616715 ), is ubiquitously expressed, and presents in two isoforms; the longest, with 296 amino acids, is the most biologically relevant as an ER resident protein. 21 The N-terminal signal sequence (amino acid 1–48) is followed by the cytosolic domain (amino acid 49–102), the single transmembrane domain (amino acid 103–125), the atypical TRX domain (amino acid 167–170, Ser-Asn-Asp-Cys, SNDC), the ER intraluminal C-terminal domain (amino acid 126–296), and a Di-lysine ER retention motif (amino acid 293–296, Lys-Lys-Asp-Lys, KKDK). 3 , 4 It has been suggested that TMX2 is enriched at the MAM location. 10 Because TMX2 does not contain a typical thioredoxin-like active domain (SNDC instead of CXXC), its oxidoreductase activity and role in protein folding have been questioned. However, the importance of TMX2 is underlined by the non-viability of homozygous Tmx2 −/− knockout mice (C57BL/6NJ strain, Mouse Genome Informatics MGI: 1914208 ). Here we report microcephaly, polymicrogyria (PMG), complex migration disorders, and epilepsy in individuals bearing bi-allelic, autosomal-recessive variants in TMX2 . We study the function of normal TMX2 and the effect of the variants in human cells, providing a mechanistic understanding of TMX2 function in health and disease and linking PDIs to neurodevelopment.

Discussion

We describe a disorder, characterized by developmental delay, microcephaly, impaired speech and ambulation, epilepsy, and cortical malformations, that has a relatively wide spectrum of severity ranging from early death to intellectual disability with mild motor impairment and resulting from recessive TMX2 variants.

Redox regulatory proteins are enriched at the MAM of the smooth ER. 10 , 48 Some of these proteins interact with ER calcium-handling proteins and regulate the calcium flux into the mitochondria, a process that, in turn, influences mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiration. 1 Thioredoxins of the PDI family regulate the cellular redox state through oxidoreductase-activity-mediated disulfide bond formation and contribute to protein folding. The PDI transmembrane ER thioredoxin-related (TMX) proteins, such as MAM-associated TMX1, seem to have dual function: on the one hand, they regulate protein folding, maintaining the redox environment of the ER and hereby preventing ER stress, and on the other hand, they regulate calcium flux in the mitochondria. 7 Besides regulating protein folding and calcium transport, thioredoxins in general are key molecules in the regulation of oxidative stress through scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROSs), such as hydrogen peroxide. 49

TMX2 lacks the canonical oxidoreductase active C-X-X-C domain. However, its function as a folding chaperone is suggested by our data, demonstrating (1) the dysregulation of disulfide-bond- and N-glycosylation-related genes in TMX2 -deficient fibroblasts, (2) the interaction of TMX2 with several proteins regulating protein folding and UPR, and (3) the presence of both oxidized and reduced forms in the maleimide alkylation assay. In addition, our mechanistic studies discover the function of TMX2 as a regulator of calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics. TMX2 localizes at the MAM, where it physically binds to calnexin and SERCA2, whereas TMX2 -variant fibroblasts show decreased mitochondrial reserve capacity and lower ability to cope with oxidative stress, probably related to defective calcium flux, similarly to what was proposed for TMX1 -deficient cells. 7 Compared to TMX 1, TMX2 is highly expressed in the fetal and postnatal brain. The specific TMX2 expression in the cortex during prenatal life, together with the deleterious effect of its loss of function for human cortical development, places TMX2 as a key molecule in the ER-mitochondrial redox regulation of brain development. Although pathogenic variants in mitochondrial oxidoreductases and MAM-associated proteins have been reported as causes of pediatric neurologic disorders, 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 the TMX2-related disorder is a malformation of cortical development resulting from a defect in a member of the PDI family.

TMX2 is thus an important regulator of oxidative stimuli, and an intriguing aspect is its responsiveness to H 2 O 2 . The sensitivity of TMX proteins to H 2 O 2 has received little attention, although it has been shown that their redox state dramatically changes after H 2 O 2 -treatment, as it happens, for example, for TMX4. 6 The hydrogen peroxide signaling molecule has long been considered to be deleterious for cellular function and a byproduct of oxidoreductase reactions, because it is rapidly metabolized by catalases, glutathione-peroxidases, or peroxi-redoxins. 49 However, more recent findings highlighted the role of H 2 O 2 as a physiological regulator of redox signaling (oxidative eustress), acting via reversible cysteine and methionine oxidation. 50 Additionally, H 2 O 2 functions in higher concentrations as a mediator of pathophysiological signals (oxidative distress), leading to growth arrest and regulated cell death. 50 One of the main intracellular sites of H 2 O 2 production is the ER. 51 Along with the activation of peroxi-redoxins as possible intermediate sensors, the role of H 2 O 2 in the development of the nervous system has been well-established. 51 , 52 , 53 Among targets of H 2 O 2 redox signaling are transcription factors of the Wnt and the Shh pathways. 54 Moreover, H 2 O 2 has been recently discovered to be a signaling molecule controlling axonal path finding in zebrafish 54 and neuronal-growth-cone collapse in vitro . 55 Hence, it is not surprising that a TMX2 -variant-mediated misbalance in oxidative eustress/distress could result in impaired neuronal development.

Under our experimental conditions, increased concentrations of H 2 O 2 in the culture medium induced wild-type TMX2 dimerization. In the same maleimide alkylation assays, the TMX2 redox state does not seem sensitive to ER stressors. These results reflect a physiological sensitivity of TMX2 to H 2 O 2 , possibly mimicking an adaptive response to oxidative eustress, regulating physiological steps in development. 52 , 54 The wild-type TMX2 dimer was still slightly present under β-mercaptoethanol reducing conditions ( Figure S6 ), indicating that it is partially formed through inter-disulfide bonds. The occurrence of homo-dimerization of other members of the PDI superfamily has been described earlier (for PDI, 56 , 57 , 58 PDIp, 59 and ERp29 60 ) and is suggested as a general mechanism to regulate PDI function. 13 , 56 Dimers can exhibit higher chaperone or unfolding activity as described for ERp29, PDIp, CNX, and CRT dimerization. 60 Also, homo-dimerization of other TMX proteins has been postulated, e.g., a putative TMX1 homodimer was observed in immunoprecipitates with anti-CNX after ablation of the TRX domain active cysteines. 61

Our data suggest the formation of TMX2 homo-dimer/polymers, on the basis of the evidence that observed TMX2 molecular masses on gradient gels show linearity with the predicted molecular mass by the Lambin method calculation and on the fact that the dimerization is not strictly dependent on disulfide bridge formation. Both under DTT pre-treatment in culture (of the TMX2 mutants) and by running a gel with β-mercaptoethanol, dimers are still present with an identical linear molecular mass. Because dimerization still occurs in the TRX domain mutant independently of an active cysteine and H 2 O 2 treatment, the dimer does not represent a heterodimer of TMX2 with a substrate formed through mixed disulfides, similar to what is described for TMX1 homo-dimerization. 61 Although polymers were also observed after ablation of the TRX domain cysteine, they were barely present under reducing conditions. Hence, we cannot exclude interactions of TMX2 with other substrates of identical molecular mass, through TRX-domain-independent interactions. For example, N-linked glycosylation has been shown to modulate the formation of PDI polymers, and in TMX2 it could mediate interaction with heterologous peptides. 56

Similar to in wild-type TMX2 under oxidative stress, we observed constitutive TMX2 homodi-/polymerization upon expression of the TMX2 pathogenic variants (p.Arg53Cys and p.Arg231Trp), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced maximal respiration, and increased glycolysis, as seen under ER stress conditions. 7 , 50 , 62 However, we did not detect activation of UPR in fibroblasts from affected individuals, both under native and under treatment with H 2 O 2 (data not shown). This suggests that the UPR is not the primary target of TMX2 function or that cultured fibroblasts are not the ideal test model.

Another fascinating aspect is TMX2 involvement in the pathogenesis of PMG. This malformation has long been considered as a defect of postmigratory cortical organization, 63 with wide genetic heterogeneity, but it is also a proven consequence of prenatal brain injury or disruptive events. 64 These aspects make genetic counseling of PMG most challenging. At brain imaging, it might be difficult to distinguish PMG resulting from environmental factors (e.g., prenatal CMV infection) or from genetic defects. At MRI and pathological examination, the main PMG characteristics are many small gyri with a pebbled appearance, loss of normal cortical lamination, overfolding and fusion of the gyri, and stippling of the white-gray matter border, 65 sometimes giving the appearance of generally thickened cortex. The cobblestone malformation is characterized by a pebbled cerebral surface, thick cortex, and striations perpendicular to the cortical surface, which reflect tracks of neuroglial cells overmigrating above the glia limitans in the subarachnoid space; overmigration is sometimes massive and leads to thinning of the cortical plate. 35 , 66 The cobblestone malformation is frequently associated with cerebellar and pons dysplasia and variable hydrocephalus, as well as white matter and callosal dysgenesis. PMG and the cobblestone malformation have been sporadically reported to coexist in the same genetic disorder. 67 , 68 Pathology of the brain in two TMX2 -variant affected individuals shows complete disorganization of the cortical layers (unlayered PMG) in both and, in one of them (P10), diffusely overmigrating neurons, typical of the cobblestone malformation, together with scattered white matter calcifications and pseudocysts, suggestive of a disruptive (CMV-like) event. Unlayered PMG is supposed to be caused by an early disruption of cortical development between 16–24 weeks gestation 69 and can also be observed in metabolic causes of PMG such as Zellweger disease (a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder characterized by mislocalization of catalase), or lining non-genetic schizencephalic clefts. 64 , 70 A mixture of disruptive and developmental migratory abnormalities has been reported for the brain disorder caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, where the effect on neuronal proliferation and migration is more prominent than in other more common congenital infections, i.e., CMV. 71 We demonstrate that TMX2-related PMG is a disorder of neuronal migration and cortical organization, without evidence of vascular or inflammatory disruption; in some cases it presents with a radiological aspect resembling an infectious, i.e., non-genetic, cause, and in other cases it microscopically shows the cobblestone malformation. These observations support the view that PMG and cobblestone are cortical malformations that can share a common pathogenesis and represent different severity of the spectrum. 72 , 73

It is possible that some of the TMX2-related malformations are caused by a lack of physiological response to regulators of neuronal development (hypothetically H 2 O 2 -mediated axonal pathfinding), and some are the effect of abnormal oxidoreductase-mediated protein folding and calcium homeostasis, with a secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. Although no UPR stimulation was found in TMX2-deficient cells, TMX2 also plays a role in regulation of UPR and apoptosis, both mechanisms essential for regulation of neuronal proliferation and cortical organization. 74

Our observation shows how, in humans, a genetic disorder of cellular redox adaptation mechanisms can be the cause of neuronal proliferation and migration disorders with characteristics of a disruptive event. These studies also provide a mechanistic explanation for the fact that human brain development is driven by steps strictly regulated in time and space, including individual response to environmental stimuli, e.g., to redox signaling molecules and changes in cellular redox state. PDI family members might prove to be major players in this process.
