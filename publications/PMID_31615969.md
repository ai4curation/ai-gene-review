The endocytic protein EHD1 plays an important role in ciliogenesis by 
facilitating fusion of the ciliary vesicle and removal of CP110 (also known as 
CCP110) from the mother centriole, as well as removal of Cep215 (also known as 
CDK5RAP2) from centrioles to permit disengagement and duplication. However, the 
mechanism of its centrosomal recruitment remains unknown. Here, we address the 
role of the EHD1 interaction partner MICAL-L1 in ciliogenesis. MICAL-L1 
knockdown impairs ciliogenesis in a similar manner to EHD1 knockdown, and 
MICAL-L1 localizes to cilia and centrosomes in both ciliated and non-ciliated 
cells. Consistent with EHD1 function, MICAL-L1-depletion prevents CP110 removal 
from the mother centriole. Moreover, upon MICAL-L1-depletion, EHD1 fails to 
localize to basal bodies. Since MICAL-L1 localizes to the centrosome even in 
non-ciliated cells, we hypothesized that it might be anchored to the centrosome 
via an interaction with centrosomal proteins. By performing mass spectrometry, 
we identified several tubulins as potential MICAL-L1 interaction partners, and 
found a direct interaction between MICAL-L1 and both α-tubulin-β-tubulin 
heterodimers and γ-tubulin. Our data support the notion that a pool of 
centriolar γ-tubulin and/or α-tubulin-β-tubulin heterodimers anchor MICAL-L1 to 
the centriole, where it might recruit EHD1 to promote ciliogenesis.
