Abstract

Human immunodeficiency virus Nef is a myristoylated protein expressed early in infection by HIV. In addition to the well known down-regulation of the cell surface receptors CD4 and MHCI, Nef is able to alter T-cell signaling pathways. The ability to alter the cellular signaling pathways suggests that Nef can associate with signaling proteins. In the present report, we show that Nef can interact with calmodulin, the major intracellular receptor for calcium. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses with lysates from the NIH3T3 cell line constitutively expressing the native HIV-1 Nef protein revealed the presence of a stable Nef-calmodulin complex. When lysates from NIH3T3 cells were incubated with calmodulin-agarose beads in the presence of CaCl 2 or EGTA, calcium ion drastically enhanced the interaction between Nef and calmodulin, suggesting that the binding is under the influence of Ca 2+ signaling. Glutathione S -transferase-Nef fusion protein bound directly to calmodulin with high affinity. Using synthetic peptides based on the N-terminal sequence of Nef, we determined that within a 20-amino-acid N-terminal basic domain was sufficient for calmodulin binding. Furthermore, the myristoylated peptide bound to calmodulin with higher affinity than nonmyris-toylated form. Thus, the N-terminal myristoylation domain of Nef plays an important role in interacting with calmodulin. This domain is highly conserved in several HIV-1 Nef variants and resembles the N-terminal domain of NAP-22/CAP23, a myristoylated calmodulin-binder. These results for the interaction between HIV Nef and calmodulin in the cells suggested that the Nef might interfere with intracellular Ca 2+ signaling through calmodulin-mediated interactions in infected cells.

Discussion

Several studies have suggested that expression of HIV-1 Nef results in the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways in a variety of cells. The precise molecular bases for these effects are not fully understood, but are likely to be a consequence of the ability of Nef to interact with a variety of signal transduction molecules. Indeed, Nef interacts with a variety of signaling proteins and intracellular kinases, including the Src family kinases, the MAP kinase, protein kinase C, and PAK family kinases ( Saksela et al. 1995 ; Collette et al. 1996 ; Cullen 1996 ; Greenway et al. 1996 ; Smith et al. 1996 ). In the present study, we demonstrated that Nef binds specifically to calmodulin via its N-terminal myristoylated domain. The Nef-calmodulin interaction occurs in intact cells as demonstrated in Nef-transfected NIH3T3 cells by the coimmunoprecipitation of Nef with calmodulin. We also present evidence that cell-derived Nef coprecipitates with calmodulin agarose in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner. We identified and characterized the calmodulin-binding domain in Nef using a synthetic peptide. In the fluorescence spectrometry assay, an 18-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the N-terminal myristoylation domain of Nef was found to interact with calmodulin. By using myristoylated synthetic peptide in this region, we confirmed that N-terminal myristoylation could enhance the Nef-calmodulin interaction.

The primary structure of the identified calmodulin-binding domain of Nef shows features similar to those of other calmodulin-binding proteins such as CAP-23/NAP-22 (Fig. 4 ▶ ). We recently demonstrated that the calmodulin-binding domain of CAP-23/NAP-22 was narrowed down to the myristoyl moiety together with a nine-amino-acid N-terminal basic domain (myristoyl-GGKLSKKKK) ( Takasaki et al. 1999 ). The identified calmodulin-binding domain of Nef contains well conserved hydrophobic and positively charged residues (myristoyl-GGKWSKRS). We speculate that the basic residues contribute to calmodulin binding via electrostatic interaction with acidic residues in calmodulin, whereas the myristoyl group and large hydrophobic amino acids such as tryptophan and leucine seem to play a more important role in calmodulin binding through interactions with the hydrophobic pocket in the globular domains of calmodulin. In the case of CAP-23/NAP-22, myristoylation is more directly involved in the interaction between the protein and calmodulin. Furthermore, the present study shows that myristoylation of Nef is also required for the interaction with calmodulin. Thus, the myristoylation of these calmodulin-binding proteins is not only a mechanism for targeting to membrane fractions, but also plays a direct functional role by mediating protein-protein interactions.

The similarities in sequence between the N-terminal domain of CAP-23/NAP-22 and that of Nef suggest that they may interact with calmodulin in a similar fashion. In this study, different from the case of CAP-23/NAP-22, it was shown that the N-terminal domain of Nef could interact with calmodulin without the myristoyl moiety, but the affinity was found to be about 20-fold weaker than that of myristoylated forms. The myristoylation of Nef has been shown to enhance interaction between Nef and calmodulin, and, furthermore, on the analogy of CAP-23/NAP-22 ( Takasaki et al. 1999 ), the effect is supposed to be reduced by phosphorylation of the neighboring serine residues of Nef. These results indicate that the calmodulin-binding motif located at the N-terminal region of Nef is not sufficient to interact with calmodulin, and the myristoylation directly enhances the interaction in a manner regulated by plural post-translational modifications, myristoylation and phosphorylation.

The N-terminus of Nef is thought to play an important role in the functions of this protein. Goldsmith et al. (1995) demonstrated that deletion of residues 4–7 of Nef resulted in dramatically reduced infectivity. The mutant also had a significantly reduced ability to down-regulate CD4. A similar result by Greenway et al. (1994) showed that Nef caused down-regulation of the surface expression of CD4 and IL2 receptor when transfected into T-lymphocytes, but this did not occur with Nef, which lacked the 19 N-terminal residues. Another report shows that the N-terminus of HIV-1 Nef associated with a protein complex containing Lck and a serine kinase ( Baur et al. 1997 ). Deletion of the fragments 16–22 and/or 11–40 inhibits association of the kinase complex, and significantly reduces the viral infectivity. Thus, the N-terminus of Nef plays an important role in interactions with cellular proteins involved in intracellular signaling and in inhibition of their activities. We also show here that the N-terminus of Nef binds to calmodulin. The surface plasmon resonance analyses of this study and biophysical analyses of previous studies ( Hayashi et al. 2000 , 2002 ) independently revealed two states of transitions following the interaction between myristoylated Nef and Ca 2+ /CaM. Together with the results of the present study and the previous study ( Hayashi et al. 2002 ), it is revealed that when one molecule of myristoylated Nef is bound to Ca 2+ /CaM, the affinity is very high, although the induced structural change of Ca 2+ /CaM is very low. On the other hand, when the second molecule of myristoylated Nef binds to Ca 2+ /CaM, Ca 2+ /CaM gives rise to drastic structural change despite the lower affinity. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that at least some of the functional significance of Nef may be mediated by the binding of Nef to calmodulin through the N-terminal myristoylation domain.

We have proposed that calmodulin-binding domains of some proteins are cross-talk points of signal transduction pathways. For instance, calmodulin-binding domains of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, GAP-43, CAP-23/NAP-22, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and src kinase bind to acidic membrane phospholipids ( Taniguchi and Manenti 1993 ; Matsubara 1996 ; Hayashi et al. 1997 , 2000 , 2002 , 2004 ; Takasaki et al. 1999 ). Phosphorylations of the domain by PKC significantly reduce their ability to bind to membrane phospholipids and/or calmodulin. Reversible translocation between the membranes and cytosol in response to PKC-dependent phosphorylation and calmodulin binding plays an important role in the regulation and the function of these proteins. In the case of Nef, N-terminal peptides of Nef possess membrane phospholipid-binding properties ( Curtain et al. 1994 , 1998 ). Furthermore, our preliminary results show that the 18 N-terminal amino acid peptide of Nef is phosphorylated by PKC, and the phosphorylation reduces the ability to bind to calmodulin (M. Matsubara and N. Hayashi, unpubl.). Thus, calmodulin, phospholipids, and PKC bind to the same domain, and the bindings are mutually competitive. Therefore, the calmodulin-binding domain of Nef may be involved in the complex regulation and interaction of Nef with other signal transduction pathways, as is also the case with some of the other myristoylated proteins ( Hayashi et al. 2002 ).

Finally, the regulation of Ca 2+ signaling in T lymphocytes is a mechanism that modulates the immune response. Therefore, the alteration of Ca 2+ homeostasis in Nef-expressing T-cell lines could be of importance in different cellular processes. Ca 2+ is also believed to organize and stabilize the calmodulin domain structure in a conformational state that can bind target proteins. The calmodulin concentration in some cells is on the order of micromolar ( Klee and Vanaman 1982 ). Ca 2+ release can thus convert these molecules to the Ca 2+ -bound form. The affinity of Nef for calmodulin is sufficiently high so that under these conditions Nef is free to interact with the cytosolic calmodulin. It is therefore likely that Nef may modulate a diverse array of calmodulin-dependent cell functions. Recent results showed that Nef induces expression of interleukin-10 in a human T-cell line and that induction of interleukin-10 by extracellular Nef involves the Ca 2+ -calmodulin signal transduction pathway ( Brigino et al. 1997 ). Furthermore, in NIH3T3 cells transfected with Nef, Nef selectively affects the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling pathway which is important for cell growth and chemotaxis ( Graziani et al. 1996 ). This observation is of considerable interest, as it was demonstrated that PI 3-kinase activity can be regulated by the binding to calmodulin ( Joyal et al. 1997 ). Therefore, the calmodulin binding by Nef observed in the present study is likely to mediate the functional defects in Nef-infected cells. Further studies are required to unravel the biological significance of calmodulin binding by Nef. The results presented here may provide a new perspective to elucidate the process of HIV-1 infection, and may lead to novel pharmacological strategies against AIDS infection.
