Myosin VI is an unconventional motor protein, and its mutation is responsible 
for the familiar conditions sensorineural deafness and hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy. Myosin VI is found to play a key role in the protein trafficking 
and homeostasis of the Golgi complex. However, very little is known about how 
myosin VI is regulated and whether myosin VI has a function in the DNA damage 
response. Here, we found that myosin VI is regulated by DNA damage in a 
p53-dependent manner and possesses a novel function in the p53-dependent 
prosurvival pathway. Specifically, we show that myosin VI is induced by p53 and 
DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. We found that p53 directly binds to, and 
activates, the promoter of the myosin VI gene. We also show that the 
intracellular localization of myosin VI is substantially altered by p53 and DNA 
damage in a p53-dependent manner such that the pool of myosin VI in endocytic 
vesicles, membrane ruffles, and cytosol migrates to the Golgi complex, 
perinuclear membrane, and nucleus. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of myosin 
VI attenuates activation of p53 and impairs Golgi complex integrity, which makes 
myosin VI-deficient cells susceptible to apoptosis upon DNA damage. Taken 
together, we found a novel function for p53 in the maintenance of Golgi complex 
integrity and for myosin VI in the p53-dependent prosurvival pathway.
