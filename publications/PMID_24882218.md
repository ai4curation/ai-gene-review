Type I interferons (IFN-I) are essential antiviral cytokines produced upon 
microbial infection. IFN-I elicits this activity through the upregulation of 
hundreds of IFN-I-stimulated genes (ISGs). The full breadth of ISG induction 
demands activation of a number of cellular factors including the IκB kinase 
epsilon (IKKε). However, the mechanism of IKKε activation upon IFN receptor 
signaling has remained elusive. Here we show that TRIM6, a member of the 
E3-ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins, interacted with 
IKKε and promoted induction of IKKε-dependent ISGs. TRIM6 and the E2-ubiquitin 
conjugase UbE2K cooperated in the synthesis of unanchored K48-linked 
polyubiquitin chains, which activated IKKε for subsequent STAT1 phosphorylation. 
Our work attributes a previously unrecognized activating role of K48-linked 
unanchored polyubiquitin chains in kinase activation and identifies the 
UbE2K-TRIM6-ubiquitin axis as critical for IFN signaling and antiviral response.
