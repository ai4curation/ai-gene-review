1q21 is frequently involved in different types of translocation in many types of 
cancers. Jumping translocation (JT) is an unbalanced translocation that 
comprises amplified chromosomal segments jumping to various telomeres. In this 
study, we identified a novel gene human JTB (Jumping Translocation Breakpoint) 
at 1q21, which fused with the telomeric repeats of acceptor telomeres in a case 
of JT. hJTB (human JTB) encodes a trans-membrane protein that is highly 
conserved among divergent eukaryotic species. JT results in a hJTB truncation, 
which potentially produces an hJTB product devoid of the trans-membrane domain. 
hJTB is located in a gene-rich region at 1q21, called EDC (Epidermal 
Differentiation Complex). This is the first report identifying the gene involved 
in unbalanced translocations at 1q21.
