Regulation of gene expression is a vital part of the cellular stress response, 
yet the full set of proteins that orchestrate this regulation remains unknown. 
Snt2 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein whose function has not been well 
characterized that was recently shown to associate with Ecm5 and the Rpd3 
deacetylase. Here, we confirm that Snt2, Ecm5, and Rpd3 physically associate. We 
then demonstrate that cells lacking Rpd3 or Snt2 are resistant to hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2)-mediated oxidative stress and use chromatin immunoprecipitation 
followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to show that Snt2 and Ecm5 
recruit Rpd3 to a small number of promoters and in response to H2O2, colocalize 
independently of Rpd3 to the promoters of stress response genes. By integrating 
ChIP-seq and expression analyses, we identify target genes that require Snt2 for 
proper expression after H2O2. Finally, we show that cells lacking Snt2 are also 
resistant to nutrient stress imparted by the TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway 
inhibitor rapamycin and identify a common set of genes targeted by Snt2 and Ecm5 
in response to both H2O2 and rapamycin. Our results establish a function for 
Snt2 in regulating transcription in response to oxidative stress and suggest 
Snt2 may also function in multiple stress pathways.
