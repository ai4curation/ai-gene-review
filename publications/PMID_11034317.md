We report the isolation and characterization of a novel human peptide with 
antimicrobial activity, termed LEAP-1 (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide). 
Using a mass spectrometric assay detecting cysteine-rich peptides, a 25-residue 
peptide containing four disulfide bonds was identified in human blood 
ultrafiltrate. LEAP-1 expression was predominantly detected in the liver, and, 
to a much lower extent, in the heart. In radial diffusion assays, Gram-positive 
Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus 
carnosus, and Gram-negative Neisseria cinerea as well as the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae dose-dependently exhibited sensitivity upon treatment with synthetic 
LEAP-1. The discovery of LEAP-1 extends the known families of mammalian peptides 
with antimicrobial activity by its novel disulfide motif and distinct expression 
pattern.
