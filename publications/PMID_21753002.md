Mutations in the gene encoding Parkin are a major cause of recessive Parkinson's 
disease. Recent work has shown that Parkin translocates from the cytosol to 
depolarized mitochondria and induces their autophagic removal (mitophagy). 
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkin-mediated mitophagy are 
poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether Parkin interacts with 
autophagy-regulating proteins. We purified Parkin and associated proteins from 
HEK293 cells using tandem affinity purification and identified the Parkin 
interactors using mass spectrometry. We identified the autophagy-promoting 
protein Ambra1 (activating molecule in Beclin1-regulated autophagy) as a Parkin 
interactor. Ambra1 activates autophagy in the CNS by stimulating the activity of 
the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex that is essential for 
the formation of new phagophores. We found Ambra1, like Parkin, to be widely 
expressed in adult mouse brain, including midbrain dopaminergic neurons. 
Endogenous Parkin and Ambra1 coimmunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells, SH-SY5Y 
cells, and adult mouse brain. We found no evidence for ubiquitination of Ambra1 
by Parkin. The interaction of endogenous Parkin and Ambra1 strongly increased 
during prolonged mitochondrial depolarization. Ambra1 was not required for 
Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria but was critically important 
for subsequent mitochondrial clearance. In particular, Ambra1 was recruited to 
perinuclear clusters of depolarized mitochondria and activated class III PI3K in 
their immediate vicinity. These data identify interaction of Parkin with Ambra1 
as a key mechanism for induction of the final clearance step of Parkin-mediated 
mitophagy.
