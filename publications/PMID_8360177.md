Human placenta contains, in addition to the ubiquitous p120-GTPase-activating 
protein (GAP), another isoform of 100 kDa, which is specific to this organ. We 
have established a method for purifying this placental p100-GAP to near 
homogeneity. The purified p100-GAP allowed the preparation of polyclonal and 
monoclonal anti Ras-GAP antibodies. Two monoclonal antibodies were selected for 
a two-site enzyme immunoassay. This simple and accurate assay in turn 
facilitated the detection of the GAPs during purification. The purified p100-GAP 
has a specific activity identical to and catalytic properties similar to those 
of native p120-GAP. Sequence analysis of p100-GAP revealed almost total identity 
to the known corresponding sequences predicted by the cDNA. The purified 
p100-GAP kept its activity for 1 year when stored at -80 degrees C. Our 
immunometric assay showed GAP to be present in human placental extracts at the 
exceptional abundance of about 0.1% of the total protein content. Quantitative 
assays showed p100-GAP to be up to 10 times more abundant than p120-GAP. Use of 
our antibodies allowed the specific localization of placental GAPs to 
cytotrophoblasts and in the syncytiotrophoblast barrier. Hence p100-GAP is shown 
to be found only in trophoblasts. The large quantity of p100-GAP in trophoblasts 
suggests that it may play a regulatory role in the proliferation or the 
differentiation of this cell type.
