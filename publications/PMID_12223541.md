Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a critical regulator of neuronal migration 
in the developing CNS, and recent studies have revealed a role for Cdk5 in 
synaptogenesis and regulation of synaptic transmission. Deregulation of Cdk5 has 
been linked to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease. Activation of Cdk5 requires its association with a regulatory subunit, 
and two Cdk5 activators, p35 and p39, have been identified. To gain further 
insight into the functions of Cdk5, we identified proteins that interact with 
p39 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. In this study we report that alpha-actinin-1 
and the alpha-subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II 
(CaMKIIalpha), two proteins localized at the postsynaptic density, interact with 
Cdk5 via their association with p35 and p39. CaMKIIalpha and alpha-actinin-1 
bind to distinct regions of p35 and p39 and also can interact with each other. 
The association of CaMKIIalpha and alpha-actinin-1 to the Cdk5 activators, as 
well as to each other, is stimulated by calcium. Further, the activation of 
glutamate receptors increases the association of p35 and p39 with CaMKIIalpha, 
and the inhibition of CaMKII activation diminishes this effect. The 
glutamate-mediated increase in association of p35 and CaMKIIalpha is mediated in 
large part by NMDA receptors, suggesting that cross talk between the Cdk5 and 
CaMKII signal transduction pathways may be a component of the complex molecular 
mechanisms contributing to synaptic plasticity, memory, and learning.
