The Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway plays essential roles in embryonic 
development and adult tissue homeostasis, and deregulation of this pathway has 
been linked to cancer. Axin is a concentration-limiting component of the 
β-catenin destruction complex, and its stability is regulated by tankyrase. 
However, the molecular mechanism by which tankyrase-dependent 
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARsylation) is coupled to ubiquitylation and 
degradation of axin remains undefined. Here, we identify RNF146, a RING-domain 
E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a positive regulator of Wnt signalling. RNF146 promotes 
Wnt signalling by mediating tankyrase-dependent degradation of axin. 
Mechanistically, RNF146 directly interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) through its WWE 
domain, and promotes degradation of PARsylated proteins. Using proteomics 
approaches, we have identified BLZF1 and CASC3 as further substrates targeted by 
tankyrase and RNF146 for degradation. Thus, identification of RNF146 as a 
PARsylation-directed E3 ligase establishes a molecular paradigm that links 
tankyrase-dependent PARsylation to ubiquitylation. RNF146-dependent protein 
degradation may emerge as a major mechanism by which tankyrase exerts its 
function.
