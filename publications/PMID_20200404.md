Class I PI3K-dependent signaling regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, 
and survival. Analysis of gene-deficient mice revealed specific roles for the 
hematopoietically expressed PI3K catalytic subunits, p110gamma and p110delta, in 
development and function of T and B lymphocytes. However, the functional 
redundancy between these two PI3K isoforms in the B cell lineage remains 
unclear. Here, we demonstrate that p110delta and p110gamma are expressed in B 
cells at early developmental stages. Normal B cell differentiation requires both 
isoforms, as p110gamma/p110delta double deficiency causes an increased 
percentage of CD43(hi)/B220(+)/CD19(-) cells as compared with single deficiency. 
Interestingly, initial transformation efficiency of B cell precursors was 
strongly reduced in double-deficient cells following transformation by p185 
bcr-abl or v-abl oncogenes as compared with single-deficient cells. The 
requirement of p110gamma and p110delta in B cell development is underlined by 
reduced splenic B cell numbers of p110gamma/p110delta double-deficient mice and 
of lethally irradiated wild-type mice reconstituted with double-deficient BM. 
Moreover, the peripheral maintenance of p110gamma/p110delta double-deficient T 
and B cells was highly impaired following adoptive transfer of double-deficient 
splenocytes into wild-type mice. Functionally, LPS stimulation of splenocytes 
revealed proliferation defects resulting in decreased survival of 
p110gamma/p110delta double-deficient B cells, which correlated with impaired 
induction of D-type cyclins and Bcl-X(L). Surprisingly, this was not observed 
when purified B cells were analyzed, indicating a contribution of likely 
cell-extrinsic factor(s) to the impaired proliferation of double-deficient B 
cells. Thus, we provide novel evidence that p110gamma and p110delta have 
overlapping and cell-extrinsic roles in the development, peripheral maintenance, 
and function of B cells.
