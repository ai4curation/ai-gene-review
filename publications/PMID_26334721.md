Genetic studies have shown that aberrant activation of p53 signaling leads to 
embryonic lethality. Maintenance of a fine balance of the p53 protein level is 
critical for normal development. Previously, we have reported that Jmjd5, a 
member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) family, regulates embryonic cell proliferation 
through the control of Cdkn1a expression. Since Cdkn1a is the representative 
p53-regulated gene, we have examined whether the expression of other p53 target 
genes is coincidentally upregulated with Cdkn1a in Jmjd5-deficient embryos. The 
expression of a subset of p53-regulated genes was increased in both Jmjd5 
hypomorphic mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Jmjd5-deficient embryos at 
embryonic day 8.25 without the induced expression of Trp53. Intercrossing of 
Jmjd5-deficient mice with Trp53 knockout mice showed that the growth defect of 
Jmjd5 mutant cells was significantly recovered under a Trp53 null genetic 
background. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in Jmjd5 hypomorphic MEFs 
indicated the increased recruitment of p53 at several p53 target gene loci, such 
as Cdkn1a, Pmaip1, and Mdm2. These results suggest that Jmjd5 is involved in the 
transcriptional regulation of a subset of p53-regulated genes, possibly through 
the control of p53 recruitment at the gene loci. In Jmjd5-deficient embryos, the 
enhanced recruitment of p53 might result in the abnormal activation of p53 
signaling leading to embryonic lethality.
