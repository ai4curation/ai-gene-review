Endocytosis is a conserved cellular process in which nutrients, lipids, and 
receptors are internalized and transported to early endosomes, where they are 
sorted and either channeled to degradative pathways or recycled to the plasma 
membrane. MICAL-L1 and EHD1 are important regulatory proteins that control key 
endocytic transport steps. However, the precise mechanisms by which they mediate 
transport, and particularly the mode by which they connect to motor proteins, 
have remained enigmatic. Here we have identified the collapsin response mediator 
protein-2 (Crmp2) as an interaction partner of MICAL-L1 in non-neuronal cells. 
Crmp2 interacts with tubulin dimers and kinesin and negatively regulates 
dynein-based transport in neuronal cells, but its expression and function in 
non-neuronal cells have remained poorly characterized. Upon Crmp2 depletion, we 
observed dramatic relocalization of internalized transferrin (Tf) from 
peripheral vesicles to the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), similar to the 
effect of depleting either MICAL-L1 or EHD1. Moreover, Tf relocalization to the 
ERC could be inhibited by interfering with microtubule polymerization, 
consistent with a role for uncoupled motor protein-based transport upon 
depletion of Crmp2, MICAL-L1, or EHD1. Finally, transfection of dynamitin, a 
component of the dynactin complex whose overexpression inhibits dynein activity, 
prevented the relocalization of internalized Tf to the ERC upon depletion of 
Crmp2, MICAL-L1, or EHD1. These data provide the first trafficking regulatory 
role for Crmp2 in non-neuronal cells and support a model in which Crmp2 is an 
important endocytic regulatory protein that links MICAL-L1·EHD1-based vesicular 
transport to dynein motors.
