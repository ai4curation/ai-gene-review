Several transcription factors (TFs) have been implicated in neuroectoderm (NE) 
development, and recently, the TF PAX6 was shown to be critical for human NE 
specification. However, microRNA networks regulating human NE development have 
been poorly documented. We hypothesized that microRNAs activated by PAX6 should 
promote NE development. Using a genomics approach, we identified PAX6 binding 
sites and active enhancers genome-wide in an in vitro model of human NE 
development that was based on neural differentiation of human embryonic stem 
cells (hESC). PAX6 binding to active enhancers was found in the proximity of 
several microRNAs, including hsa-miR-135b. MiR-135b was activated during NE 
development, and ectopic expression of miR-135b in hESC promoted differentiation 
toward NE. MiR-135b promotes neural conversion by targeting components of the 
TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting differentiation into 
alternate developmental lineages. Our results demonstrate a novel TF-miRNA 
module that is activated during human neuroectoderm development and promotes the 
irreversible fate specification of human pluripotent cells toward the neural 
lineage.
