BRCA1 is a major player in the DNA damage response. This is evident from its 
loss, which causes cells to become sensitive to a wide variety of DNA damaging 
agents. The major BRCA1 binding partner, BARD1, is also implicated in the DNA 
damage response, and recent reports indicate that BRCA1 and BARD1 co-operate in 
this pathway. In this report, we utilized small interfering RNA to deplete BRCA1 
and BARD1 to demonstrate that the BRCA1-BARD1 complex is required for ATM/ATR 
(ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated/ATM and Rad3-related)-mediated phosphorylation of 
p53(Ser-15) following IR- and UV radiation-induced DNA damage. In contrast, 
phosphorylation of a number of other ATM/ATR targets including H2AX, Chk2, Chk1, 
and c-jun does not depend on the presence of BRCA1-BARD1 complexes. Moreover, 
prior ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser-1423 or Ser-1524 
regulates the ability of ATM/ATR to phosphorylate p53(Ser-15) efficiently. 
Phosphorylation of p53(Ser-15) is necessary for an IR-induced G(1)/S arrest via 
transcriptional induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. 
Consistent with these data, repressing p53(Ser-15) phosphorylation by 
BRCA1-BARD1 depletion compromises p21 induction and the G(1)/S checkpoint arrest 
in response to IR but not UV radia-tion. These findings suggest that BRCA1-BARD1 
complexes act as an adaptor to mediate ATM/ATR-directed phosphorylation of p53, 
influencing G(1)/S cell cycle progression after DNA damage.
