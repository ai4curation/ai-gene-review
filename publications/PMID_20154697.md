Metastasis is responsible for the majority of prostate cancer-related deaths; 
however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this 
process. Here we identify an oncogene-tumor suppressor cascade that promotes 
prostate cancer growth and metastasis by coordinately activating the small 
GTPase Ras and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Specifically, we show that 
loss of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) gene DAB2IP induces 
metastatic prostate cancer in an orthotopic mouse tumor model. Notably, DAB2IP 
functions as a signaling scaffold that coordinately regulates Ras and NF-kappaB 
through distinct domains to promote tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. 
DAB2IP is suppressed in human prostate cancer, where its expression inversely 
correlates with tumor grade and predicts prognosis. Moreover, we report that 
epigenetic silencing of DAB2IP is a key mechanism by which the polycomb-group 
protein histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 activates Ras and NF-kappaB and 
triggers metastasis. These studies define the mechanism by which two major 
pathways can be simultaneously activated in metastatic prostate cancer and 
establish EZH2 as a driver of metastasis.

Abstract

Metastasis is responsible for the majority of prostate cancer-related deaths; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this process. Here we identify an oncogene-tumor suppressor cascade that promotes prostate cancer initiation and metastasis by coordinately activating Ras and NF-κB. Specifically, we show that loss of the RasGAP gene DAB2IP induces metastatic prostate cancer in a murine model. Notably, DAB2IP functions as a signaling scaffold that coordinately regulates Ras and NF-κB through distinct domains to promote tumor initiation and metastasis, respectively. DAB2IP is suppressed in human prostate cancer where expression inversely correlates with tumor grade and predicts prognosis. Moreover, we report that epigenetic silencing of DAB2IP is a key mechanism by which the polycomb-group protein EZH2 activates Ras, NF-κB, and triggers metastasis. These studies define the mechanism by which two major pathways can be simultaneously activated in metastatic prostate cancer and establish EZH2 as a driver of metastasis.

Discussion

If detected early, prostate cancer is curable; however, there are no effective therapies for metastatic disease. The current treatment for recurrent prostate cancer is surgical or medical castration. However, patients ultimately relapse and develop androgen-independent, metastatic tumors 44 . Therefore there is a significant gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie prostate cancer progression, metastasis, and in the development of effective therapies.

This knowledge deficit is, in part, due to the lack of tractable model systems. Genetically-engineered mouse models have helped define genes involved in tumor initiation and aspects of tumor progression; however, few models develop metastases and in those that do it is unclear which gene(s) drive this transition 45 , 46 . Thus orthotopic models represent a platform that can be used in a more high-throughput fashion for gene discovery, in particular for metastasis, which requires numerous prerequisite alterations. In this study we identify DAB2IP as a regulator of metastatic prostate cancer. To date, no other gene has been shown to play a direct causal role in driving prostate cancer metastasis, underscoring the significance of this finding and the utility of this model.

These studies also provide insight into mechanisms that regulate tumor initiation versus metastasis. Specifically, DAB2IP -loss promotes primary tumor growth by activating Ras and drives metastasis through NF-κB, serving as a signaling scaffold to coordinately regulate these two prominent oncogenic pathways ( Fig. 6a ). While Ras and NF-κB are known to be activated in advanced prostate cancer, the genetic alterations that confer activation are largely unknown 3 – 6 , 47 . These findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which these two pathways can be activated in prostate cancer.

In some settings Ras can promote NF-κB activation via effects on Ral B and the TBK1 kinase 47 – 48 ; however, here we report that Ras is not sufficient to stimulate NF-κB in prostate tumors. While these observations appear contradictory, a mutation in the GAP domain enhances the effects of a mutation in the period-like domain of DAB2IP (on NF-κB activity), consistent with a cooperative role for Ras in this pathway. NF-κB is regulated by the integrated output of many signals, which may be differentially limiting in different tumor types. The data presented here suggest that DAB2IP is a critical guardian of the NF-κB pathway in prostate tissue.

Finally, these studies suggest that epigenetic suppression of DAB2IP by EZH2 is an important mechanism of inactivation in human prostate cancer. Interestingly, while EZH2 is highly expressed in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer 37 , it has never been shown to induce metastasis, leading to the unresolved question of whether EZH2 upregulation is a marker or driver of metastasis 49 . These studies establish a causal role for EZH2 in driving metastasis and identify DAB2IP as a critical target in this process among numerous target genes, although certainly others may contribute. These observations have important therapeutic implications. Because EZH2 is an enzyme, it has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic target 36 . Our data underscore the utility of developing EZH2 inhibitors, as such agents might suppress both Ras and NF-κB in prostate cancer: proteins which have proven difficult to target directly. These findings also support the intriguing possibility that such inhibitors might affect primary tumors and metastatic lesions.
