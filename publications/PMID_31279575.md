Hedgehog (Hh) signaling culminates in the conversion of the latent transcription 
factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci)/Gli into its activator form (CiA/GliA), but the 
underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Hh 
stimulates the phosphorylation of Ci by the Ser/Thr kinase Fused (Fu) and that 
Fu-mediated phosphorylation of Ci promotes its activation. We find that Fu 
directly phosphorylates Ci on Ser218 and Ser1230, which primes its further 
phosphorylation by CK1 on adjacent sties. These phosphorylation events alter Ci 
binding to the pathway inhibitor Suppressor of fused (Sufu) and facilitate the 
recruitment of Transportion and the transcriptional coactivator CBP. 
Furthermore, we provide evidence that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) activates Gli2 by 
stimulating its phosphorylation on conserved sites through the Fu-family kinases 
ULK3 and mFu/STK36 in a manner depending on Gli2 ciliary localization. Hence, 
Fu-family kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ci/Gli serves as a conserved 
mechanism that activates the Hh pathway transcription factor.
