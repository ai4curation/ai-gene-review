DNA-damage signaling utilizes a multitude of posttranslational modifiers as 
molecular switches to regulate cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, cellular 
senescence, and apoptosis. Here we show that RNF8, a FHA/RING domain-containing 
protein, plays a critical role in the early DNA-damage response. We have solved 
the X-ray crystal structure of the FHA domain structure at 1.35 A. We have shown 
that RNF8 facilitates the accumulation of checkpoint mediator proteins BRCA1 and 
53BP1 to the damaged chromatin, on one hand through the phospho-dependent FHA 
domain-mediated binding of RNF8 to MDC1, on the other hand via its role in 
ubiquitylating H2AX and possibly other substrates at damage sites. Moreover, 
RNF8-depleted cells displayed a defective G2/M checkpoint and increased IR 
sensitivity. Together, our study implicates RNF8 as a novel 
DNA-damage-responsive protein that integrates protein phosphorylation and 
ubiquitylation signaling and plays a critical role in the cellular response to 
genotoxic stress.
