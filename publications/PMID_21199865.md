Pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins restrain the pro-apoptotic 
activity of Bax, either directly through interactions with Bax or indirectly by 
sequestration of activator BH3-only proteins, or both. Mutations in Bax that 
promote apoptosis can provide insight into how Bax is regulated. Here, we 
describe crystal structures of the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) in 
complex with a 34-mer peptide from Bax that encompasses its BH3 domain. These 
structures reveal canonical interactions between four signature hydrophobic 
amino acids from the BaxBH3 domain and the BH3-binding groove of the 
pro-survival proteins. In both structures, Met-74 from the Bax peptide engages 
with the BH3-binding groove in a fifth hydrophobic interaction. Various Bax 
Met-74 mutants disrupt interactions between Bax and all pro-survival proteins, 
but these Bax mutants retain pro-apoptotic activity. Bax/Bak-deficient mouse 
embryonic fibroblast cells reconstituted with several Bax Met-74 mutants are 
more sensitive to the BH3 mimetic compound ABT-737 as compared with cells 
expressing wild-type Bax. Furthermore, the cells expressing Bax Met-74 mutants 
are less viable in colony assays even in the absence of an external apoptotic 
stimulus. These results support a model in which direct restraint of Bax by 
pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins is a barrier to apoptosis.
