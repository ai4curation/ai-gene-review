Colonic mucus forms a first line of defense against bacterial invasion while 
providing nutrition to support coinhabiting microbes in the gut. Mucus is 
composed of polymeric networks of mucin proteins, which are heavily modified 
post-translationally. The full compendium of enzymes responsible for these 
modifications and their roles in health and disease remain incompletely 
understood. Herein, we determine the biochemical function of NXPE1, a gene 
implicated in ulcerative colitis (UC), and demonstrate that it encodes an 
acetyltransferase that modifies mucin glycans. Specifically, NXPE1 utilizes 
acetyl-CoA to regioselectively modify the mucus sialic acid, 
5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), at the 9-OH group to generate 9-O-acetylated 
Neu5Ac (Neu5,9Ac2). We further demonstrate that colonic organoids derived from 
donors harboring the missense variant NXPE1 G353R, which is protective against 
UC, exhibit severely impaired acetylation of Neu5Ac on mucins. Together, our 
findings support a model in which NXPE1 masks the alcohols of mucus sialoglycans 
via acetylation, which is important for modulating mucus barrier properties that 
limit interactions with commensal microbes.
