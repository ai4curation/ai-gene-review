BACKGROUND: aPKC and PAR-1 are required for cell polarity in various contexts. 
In mammalian epithelial cells, aPKC localizes at tight junctions (TJs) and plays 
an indispensable role in the development of asymmetric intercellular junctions 
essential for the establishment and maintenance of apicobasal polarity. On the 
other hand, one of the mammalian PAR-1 kinases, PAR-1b/EMK1/MARK2, localizes to 
the lateral membrane in a complimentary manner with aPKC, but little is known 
about its role in apicobasal polarity of epithelial cells as well as its 
functional relationship with aPKC.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that PAR-1b is essential for the asymmetric development 
of membrane domains of polarized MDCK cells. Nonetheless, it is not required for 
the junctional localization of aPKC nor the formation of TJs, suggesting that 
PAR-1b works downstream of aPKC during epithelial cell polarization. On the 
other hand, aPKC phosphorylates threonine 595 of PAR-1b and enhances its binding 
with 14-3-3/PAR-5. In polarized MDCK cells, T595 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 
binding are observed only in the soluble form of PAR-1b, and okadaic acid 
treatment induces T595-dependent dissociation of PAR-1b from the lateral 
membrane. Furthermore, T595A mutation induces not only PAR-1b leakage into the 
apical membrane, but also abnormal development of membrane domains. These 
results suggest that in polarized epithelial cells, aPKC phosphorylates PAR-1b 
at TJs, and in cooperation with 14-3-3, promotes the dissociation of PAR-1b from 
the lateral membrane to regulate PAR-1b activity for the membrane domain 
development.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that mammalian aPKC functions upstream of 
PAR-1b in both the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity.
