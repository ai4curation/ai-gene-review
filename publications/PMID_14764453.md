LR11, a member of the LDL receptor family, is highly expressed in vascular 
smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of the hyperplastic intima, and induces enhanced 
migration of SMCs in vitro via its upregulation of urokinase-type plasminogen 
activator receptor (uPAR) expression. In this study, we have delineated the 
mechanism by which LR11 elevates the expression levels of uPAR in SMCs. 
Secretion of soluble LR11 is induced in SMCs during the rapidly proliferating 
phase, and the secreted LR11 induces the migration activities of SMCs. Both the 
cell-anchored and secreted forms of LR11 have the capacity to bind to and form 
complexes with uPAR. LR11-overexpressing cells show significantly enhanced uPAR 
binding, but decreased uPAR internalization. LR11 colocalizes with uPAR on the 
cell surface and inhibits the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP)-mediated 
binding and internalization of uPAR. Thus, LR11 mediates the uPAR localization 
to the plasma membrane. LR11 is highly expressed in the atheromatous plaque 
areas of apoE knockout mice, particularly in the intimal SMCs at the border 
between intima and media. The neutralization of LR11 function with anti-LR11 
antibody reduced cuff-induced intimal thickness in mice. The novel mechanism of 
regulation of uPAR localization in SMCs accompanied with enhanced migration 
activity possibly constitutes an important factor in the process of 
atherosclerosis and arterial remodeling.
