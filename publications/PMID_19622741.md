Mechanical stability of bonds and protein interactions has recently become 
accessible through single molecule mechanical experiments. So far, mechanical 
information about molecular bond mechanics has been largely limited to a single 
direction of force application. However, mechanical force acts as a vector in 
space and hence mechanical stability should depend on the direction of force 
application. In skeletal muscle, the giant protein titin is anchored in the 
Z-disk by telethonin. Much of the structural integrity of the Z-disk hinges upon 
the titin-telethonin bond. In this paper we show that the complex between the 
muscle proteins titin and telethonin forms a highly directed molecular bond. It 
is designed to resist ultra-high forces if they are applied in the direction 
along which it is loaded under physiological conditions, while it breaks easily 
along other directions. Highly directed molecular bonds match in an ideal way 
the requirements of tissues subject to mechanical stress.
