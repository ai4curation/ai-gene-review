The involvement of brassinosteroids in signalling events in plants during UV-B 
stress (280-315 nm) was investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana. Brassinosteroids 
are involved in growth and development in plants and have also been shown to 
enhance stress tolerance. Three mutants deficient in the biosynthetic pathway of 
brassinolide (BL; det2, dim1 and cpd) and the BL insensitive mutant (bri1) were 
together with visible light irradiated with 3 or 9 h of UV-B radiation 
(biologically effective radiation normalised to 300 nm being 0.24 W m(-2)). 
Also, a small size control, irx1, and Columbia 0 (Col-0) wild-type plants were 
examined under identical conditions. Gene expression patterns were established 
for these mutants with a set of four molecular markers (the defence genes 
chalcone synthase (CHS), PYROA, pathogenesis-related protein PR-5, and a gene 
regulated by very low levels of UV-B, MEB5.2). Although the genes in the 
brassinodefective mutants were still induced by UV-B radiation, they all also 
showed reduced levels of mRNA transcripts compared with Col-0 and irx1. The bri1 
and cpd were the mutants with lowest levels of molecular marker mRNA 
transcripts. The effects of impairment of brassinosteroid signalling also 
differed between the genes studied, indicating a need for a complete 
brassinosteroid pathway in UV-B signalling.
