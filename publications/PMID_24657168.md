The apoptotic actions of p53 require its phosphorylation by a family of 
phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related-kinases (PIKKs), which include DNA-PKcs and 
ATM. These kinases are stabilized by the TTT (Tel2, Tti1, Tti2) cochaperone 
family, whose actions are mediated by CK2 phosphorylation. The inositol 
pyrophosphates, such as 5-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7), are 
generated by a family of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks), of which 
IP6K2 has been implicated in p53-associated cell death. In the present study we 
report an apoptotic signaling cascade linking CK2, TTT, the PIKKs, and p53. We 
demonstrate that IP7, formed by IP6K2, binds CK2 to enhance its phosphorylation 
of the TTT complex, thereby stabilizing DNA-PKcs and ATM. This process 
stimulates p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 to activate the cell death program 
in human cancer cells and in murine B cells.
