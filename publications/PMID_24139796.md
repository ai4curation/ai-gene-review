The decay of mRNAs is a key step in eukaryotic gene expression. The cytoplasmic 
Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex is a conserved component of the 5'-to-3' mRNA decay pathway, 
linking deadenylation to decapping. Lsm1-7 is similar to the nuclear Sm 
complexes that bind oligo-uridine tracts in snRNAs. The 2.3 Å resolution 
structure of S. cerevisiae Lsm1-7 shows the presence of a heptameric ring with 
Lsm1-2-3-6-5-7-4 topology. A distinct structural feature of the cytoplasmic Lsm 
ring is the C-terminal extension of Lsm1, which plugs the exit site of the 
central channel and approaches the RNA binding pockets. The 3.7 Å resolution 
structure of Lsm1-7 bound to the C-terminal domain of Pat1 reveals that Pat1 
recognition is not mediated by the distinguishing cytoplasmic subunit, Lsm1, but 
by Lsm2 and Lsm3. These results show how the auxiliary domains and the canonical 
Sm folds of the Lsm1-7 complex are organized in order to mediate and modulate 
macromolecular interactions.
