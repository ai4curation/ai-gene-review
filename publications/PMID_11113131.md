Cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are abundant in animal and plant tissues 
involved in host defense. In insects, most are synthesized in the fat body, an 
organ analogous to the liver of vertebrates. From human urine, we characterized 
a cysteine-rich peptide with three forms differing by amino-terminal truncation, 
and we named it hepcidin (Hepc) because of its origin in the liver and its 
antimicrobial properties. Two predominant forms, Hepc20 and Hepc25, contained 20 
and 25 amino acid residues with all 8 cysteines connected by intramolecular 
disulfide bonds. Reverse translation and search of the data bases found 
homologous liver cDNAs in species from fish to human and a corresponding human 
genomic sequence on human chromosome 19. The full cDNA by 5' rapid amplification 
of cDNA ends was 0.4 kilobase pair, in agreement with hepcidin mRNA size on 
Northern blots. The liver was the predominant site of mRNA expression. The 
encoded prepropeptide contains 84 amino acids, but only the 20-25-amino acid 
processed forms were found in urine. Hepcidins exhibited antifungal activity 
against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger and 
antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, 
Staphylococcus epidermidis, and group B Streptococcus. Hepcidin may be a 
vertebrate counterpart of cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides produced in the 
fat body of insects.
