SIRPalpha and SIRPbeta1, the two major isoforms of the signal regulatory protein 
(SIRP) family, are co-expressed in human leukocytes but mediate distinct 
extracellular binding interactions and divergent cell signaling responses. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that binding of SIRPalpha with CD47, another 
important cell surface molecule, through the extracellular IgV domain regulates 
important leukocyte functions including macrophage recognition, leukocyte 
adhesion and transmigration. Although SIRPbeta1 shares highly homologous 
extracellular IgV structure with SIRPalpha, it does not bind to CD47. Here, we 
defined key amino acid residues exclusively expressing in the IgV domain of 
SIRPalpha, but not SIRPbeta1, which determine the extracellular binding 
interaction of SIRPalpha to CD47. These key residues include Gln67, a small 
hydrophobic amino acid (Ala or Val) at the 57th position and Met102. We found 
that Gln67 and Ala/Val57 are critical. Mutation of either of these residues 
abates SIRPalpha directly binding to CD47. Functional cell adhesion and 
leukocyte transmigration assays further demonstrated central roles of Gln67 and 
Ala/Val57 in SIRPalpha extracellular binding mediated cell interactions and cell 
migration. Another SIRPalpha-specific residue, Met102, appears to assist 
SIRPalpha IgV binding through Gln67 and Ala/Val57. An essential role of these 
amino acid residues in SIRPalpha binding to CD47 was further confirmed by 
introducing these residues into the SIRPbeta1 IgV domain, which dramatically 
converts SIRPbeta1 into a CD47-binding molecule. Our results thus revealed the 
molecular basis by which SIRPalpha binds to CD47 and shed new light into the 
structural mechanisms of SIRP isoform mediated distinctive extracellular 
interactions and cellular responses.
