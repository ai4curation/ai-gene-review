The histone deacetylase RPD3 can be targeted to certain genes through its 
interaction with DNA-binding regulatory proteins. RPD3 can then repress gene 
transcription. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, association of RPD3 with 
the transcriptional repressors SIN3 and UME6 results in repression of reporter 
genes containing the UME6-binding site. RPD3 can deacetylate all histone H4 
acetylation sites in cell extracts. However, it is unknown how H4 proteins 
located at genes near UME6-binding sites are affected, nor whether the effect of 
RPD3 is localized to the promoter regions. Here we study the mechanism by which 
RPD3 represses gene activity by examining the acetylation state of histone 
proteins at UME6-regulated genes. We used antibodies specific for individual 
acetylation sites in H4 to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments. A deletion of 
RPD3 or SIN3, but not of the related histone-deacetylase gene HDA1, results in 
increased acetylation of the lysine 5 residue of H4 in the promoters of the 
UME6-regulated INO1, IME2 and SPO13 genes. As increased acetylation of this 
residue is not merely a consequence of gene transcription, acetylation of this 
site may be essential for regulating gene activity.
