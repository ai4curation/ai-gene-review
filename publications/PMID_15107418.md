Activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)7 is a type I serine/threonine kinase receptor 
of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta family of proteins that has similar 
properties to other type I receptors when activated. To see whether ALK7 can 
induce apoptosis as can some of the other ALK proteins, we infected the FaO rat 
hepatoma cell line with adenovirus expressing a constitutively active form of 
the ALK7. Cells infected with active ALK7 adenovirus showed an 
apoptotic-positive phenotype, as opposed to those that were infected with a 
control protein. DNA fragmentation assays and fluorescence-activated cell sorter 
analysis also indicated that ALK7 infection induced apoptosis in FaO cells. We 
also confirmed this finding in Hep3B human hepatoma cells by transiently 
transfecting the constitutively active form of ALK7, ALK7(T194D). Investigation 
into the downstream targets and mechanisms involved in ALK7-induced apoptosis 
revealed that the TGF-beta signaling intermediates, Smad2 and -3, were 
activated, as well as the MAPKs JNK and p38. In addition, caspase-3 and -9 were 
also activated, and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria was observed. 
Short interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of Smad3 markedly suppressed 
ALK7-induced caspase-3 activation. Treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors 
or the expression of the dominant-negative form of the stress-activated 
protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 abolished not only JNK 
activation but apoptosis as well. Taken together, these results suggest that 
ALK7 induces apoptosis through activation of the traditional TGF-beta pathway 
components, thus resulting in new gene transcription and JNK and p38 activation 
that initiates cross-talk with the cellular stress death pathway and ultimately 
leads to apoptosis.
