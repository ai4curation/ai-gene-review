Gamma-secretase is a member of an unusual class of proteases with intramembrane 
catalytic sites. This enzyme cleaves many type I membrane proteins, including 
the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) precursor (APP) and the Notch receptor. 
Biochemical and genetic studies have identified four membrane proteins as 
components of gamma-secretase: heterodimeric presenilin (PS) composed of its N- 
and C-terminal fragments (PS-NTF/CTF), a mature glycosylated form of nicastrin 
(NCT), Aph-1, and Pen-2. Recent data from studies in Drosophila, mammalian, and 
yeast cells suggest that PS, NCT, Aph-1, and Pen-2 are necessary and sufficient 
to reconstitute gamma-secretase activity. However, many unresolved issues, in 
particular the possibility of other structural or regulatory components, would 
be resolved by actually purifying the enzyme. Here, we report a detailed, 
multistep purification procedure for active gamma-secretase and an initial 
characterization of the purified protease. Extensive mass spectrometry of the 
purified proteins strongly suggests that PS-NTF/CTF, mNCT, Aph-1, and Pen-2 are 
the components of active gamma-secretase. Using the purified gamma-secretase, we 
describe factors that modulate the production of specific Abeta species: (1) 
phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin dramatically improve activity without 
changing cleavage specificity within an APP substrate; (2) increasing CHAPSO 
concentrations from 0.1 to 0.25% yields a approximately 100% increase in Abeta42 
production; (3) exposure of an APP-based recombinant substrate to 0.5% SDS 
modulates cleavage specificity from a disease-mimicking pattern (high 
Abeta42/43) to a physiological pattern (high Abeta40); and (4) sulindac sulfide 
directly and preferentially decreases Abeta42 cleavage within the purified 
complex. Taken together, our results define a procedure for purifying active 
gamma-secretase and suggest that the lipid-mediated conformation of both enzyme 
and substrate regulate the production of the potentially neurotoxic Abeta42 and 
Abeta43 peptides.
