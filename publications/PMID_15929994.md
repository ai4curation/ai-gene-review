Human Securin, also called PTTG1 (pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 product), 
is an estrogen-regulated proto-oncogene with multifunctional properties. We 
characterized human full-length Securin using a variety of biophysical 
techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and 
size-exclusion chromatography. Under physiological conditions, Securin is devoid 
of tertiary and secondary structure except for a small amount of 
poly-(L-proline) type II helix and its hydrodynamic characteristics suggest it 
behaves as an extended polypeptide. These results suggest that Securin is 
unstructured in solution and so belongs to the family of natively unfolded 
proteins. In addition, to gain structural and quantitative insight, we 
investigated the binding of Securin to p53. Analytical ultracentrifugation and 
fluorescence anisotropy studies revealed no evidence of any direct interaction 
between unmodified recombinant Securin and p53 in vitro.
