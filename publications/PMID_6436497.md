Five SWI genes are required for expression of the HO gene in yeast.

Stern M, Jensen R, Herskowitz I.

High-frequency mating type interconversion in yeast requires the HO gene, which 
encodes a site-specific endonuclease that initiates the switching process. We 
have isolated and analyzed switching-defective mutants. These mutants define 
five complementation and linkage groups, SWI 1 to SWI 5. We have shown by two 
assays, Northern hybridization and beta-galactosidase activity in strains 
containing an HO-lacZ fusion, that mutants defective any SWI gene fail to 
express the HO gene. In addition, all of the swi mutants exhibit other 
phenotypes, the most notable being the inviability of double mutants defective 
in SWI 4 and in either SWI 1, SWI 2 or SWI 3. These results indicate that the 
SWI genes function in some way as positive regulators of HO expression and have 
additional cellular roles.
