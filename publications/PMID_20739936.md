Successful partition of replicated genomes at cell division requires chromosome 
attachment to opposite poles of mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). Any defects in 
this regulation bring about chromosomal instability, which may accelerate tumour 
progression in humans. To achieve chromosome bi-orientation at prometaphase, the 
chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of catalytic kinase Aurora B and 
regulatory components (INCENP, Survivin and Borealin), must be localized to 
centromeres to phosphorylate kinetochore substrates. Although the CPC 
dynamically changes the subcellular localization, the regulation of centromere 
targeting is largely unknown. Here we isolated a fission yeast cyclin B mutant 
defective specifically in chromosome bi-orientation. Accordingly, we identified 
Cdk1 (also known as Cdc2)-cyclin-B-dependent phosphorylation of Survivin. 
Preventing Survivin phosphorylation impairs centromere CPC targeting as well as 
chromosome bi-orientation, whereas phosphomimetic Survivin suppresses the 
bi-orientation defect in the cyclin B mutant. Survivin phosphorylation promotes 
direct binding with shugoshin, which we now define as a conserved centromeric 
adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of Borealin has a 
comparable role. Thus, our study resolves the conserved mechanisms of CPC 
targeting to centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in chromosome 
bi-orientation.
