The ubiquitously expressed c-Abl tyrosine kinase localizes to the cytoplasm and 
nucleus. Nuclear c-Abl is activated by diverse genotoxic agents and induces 
apoptosis; however, the mechanisms that are responsible for nuclear targeting of 
c-Abl remain unclear. Here, we show that cytoplasmic c-Abl is targeted to the 
nucleus in the DNA damage response. The results show that c-Abl is sequestered 
into the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of c-Abl on 
Thr 735 functions as a site for direct binding to 14-3-3 proteins. We also show 
that, in response to DNA damage, activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Jnk) 
induces phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins and their release from c-Abl. 
Together with these results, expression of an unphosphorylated 14-3-3 mutant 
attenuates DNA-damage-induced nuclear import of c-Abl and apoptosis. These 
findings indicate that 14-3-3 proteins are pivotal regulators of intracellular 
c-Abl localization and of the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress.
