The catalytic activity of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine 
phosphatase, SHP-2, is required for virtually all of its signaling effects. 
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of SHP-2 signaling, therefore, rests upon 
the identification of its target substrates. In this report, we have used SHP-2 
substrate-trapping mutants to identify the major vault protein (MVP) as a 
putative SHP-2 substrate. MVP is the predominant component of vaults that are 
cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes of unknown function. We show that MVP is 
dephosphorylated by SHP-2 in vitro and it forms an enzyme-substrate complex with 
SHP-2 in vivo. In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), SHP-2 associates 
via its SH2 domains with tyrosyl-phosphorylated MVP. MVP also interacts with the 
activated form of the extracellular-regulated kinases (Erks) in response to EGF 
and a constitutive complex between tyrosyl-phosphorylated MVP, SHP-2, and the 
Erks was detected in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Using MVP-deficient fibroblasts, 
we demonstrate that MVP cooperates with Ras for optimal EGF-induced Elk-1 
activation and is required for cell survival. We propose that MVP functions as a 
novel scaffold protein for both SHP-2 and Erk. The regulation of MVP tyrosyl 
phosphorylation by SHP-2 may play an important role in cell survival signaling.
