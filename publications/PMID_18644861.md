The Chk2 protein kinase protects genome integrity by promoting cell cycle arrest 
or apoptosis in response to DNA double-strand breaks, and Chk2 mutations are 
found in both familial and sporadic cancers. Exposure of cells to ionizing 
radiation (IR) or radiomimetic drugs induces Chk2 phosphorylation by ATM, 
followed by Chk2 oligomerization, auto-/transphosphorylation, and activation. 
Here we demonstrate that Chk2 is ubiquitinated upon activation and that this 
requires Chk2 kinase activity. Serine 379 (S379) was identified as a novel 
IR-inducible autophosphorylation site required for ubiquitination of Chk2 by a 
Cullin 1-containing E3 ligase complex. Importantly, S379 was required for Chk2 
to induce apoptosis in cells with DNA double-strand breaks. Thus, 
auto-/transphosphorylation of S379 is required for Chk2 ubiquitination and 
effector function.
