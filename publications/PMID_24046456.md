Cadherins are essential in many fundamental processes and assemble at regions of 
cell-cell contact in large macromolecular complexes named adherens junctions. We 
have identified flotillin 1 and 2 as new partners of the cadherin complexes. We 
show that flotillins are localised at cell-cell junctions (CCJs) in a 
cadherin-dependent manner. Flotillins and cadherins are constitutively 
associated at the plasma membrane and their colocalisation at CCJ increases with 
CCJ maturation. Using three-dimensional structured illumination super-resolution 
microscopy, we found that cadherin and flotillin complexes are associated with 
F-actin bundles at CCJs. The knockdown of flotillins dramatically affected N- 
and E-cadherin recruitment at CCJs in mesenchymal and epithelial cell types and 
perturbed CCJ integrity and functionality. Moreover, we determined that 
flotillins are required for cadherin association with GM1-containing plasma 
membrane microdomains. This allows p120 catenin binding to the cadherin complex 
and its stabilization at CCJs. Altogether, these data demonstrate that flotillin 
microdomains are required for cadherin stabilization at CCJs and for the 
formation of functional CCJs.
