The Caenorhabditis elegans daf-2/insulin-like signaling pathway is critical for 
regulating development, longevity, metabolism and stress resistance. We 
identified the 14-3-3 protein FTT-2 to be a new regulatory component of this 
pathway. We found that RNAi knock down of ftt-2 specifically enhanced the 
daf-2-mediated dauer formation phenotype. Furthermore, ftt-2 knock down caused 
the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16/FOXO, the forkhead transcription factor that 
is the major downstream effecter of daf-2/insulin-like signaling, and enhanced 
the transcriptional activities of DAF-16. In contrast to ftt-2, RNAi knock down 
of par-5/ftt-1, the only other gene predicted to encode a 14-3-3 protein in C. 
elegans, did not show any notable effect on dauer formation, DAF-16 
localization, or DAF-16 downstream gene transcription, underscoring the 
functional specification of FTT-2 and PAR-5 despite their high sequence 
homology. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we revealed that FTT-2 formed a complex 
with GFP-fused DAF-16 in C. elegans. Our results indicate that FTT-2 binds to 
DAF-16 in C. elegans and regulates DAF-16 by sequestering it in the cytoplasm. A 
similar mechanism of regulation of FOXO by 14-3-3zeta has been reported in 
mammalian cells, highlighting the high degree of conservation of the 
daf-2/insulin-like signaling pathway.
