AlphaA- and alphaB-crystallins are distinct antiapoptotic regulators. Regarding 
the antiapoptotic mechanisms, we have recently demonstrated that 
alphaB-crystallin interacts with the procaspase-3 and partially processed 
procaspase-3 to repress caspase-3 activation. Here, we demonstrate that human 
alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins prevent staurosporine-induced apoptosis through 
interactions with members of the Bcl-2 family. Using GST pulldown assays and 
coimmunoprecipitations, we demonstrated that alpha-crystallins bind to Bax and 
Bcl-X(S) both in vitro and in vivo. Human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins display 
similar affinity to both proapoptotic regulators, and so are true with their 
antiapoptotic ability tested in human lens epithelial cells, human retina 
pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) and rat embryonic myocardium cells (H9c2) 
under treatment of staurosporine, etoposide or sorbitol. Two prominent mutants, 
R116C in alphaA-crystallin and R120G, in alphaB-crystallin display much weaker 
affinity to Bax and Bcl-X(S). Through the interaction, alpha-crystallins prevent 
the translocation of Bax and Bcl-X(S) from cytosol into mitochondria during 
staurosporine-induced apoptosis. As a result, alpha-crystallins preserve the 
integrity of mitochondria, restrict release of cytochrome c, repress activation 
of caspase-3 and block degradation of PARP. Thus, our results demonstrate a 
novel antiapoptotic mechanism for alpha-crystallins.
