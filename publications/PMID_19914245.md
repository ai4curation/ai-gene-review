The tyrosine kinase, c-Abl, plays important roles in many aspects of cellular 
function. Previous reports showed that c-Abl is involved in NF-kappaB signaling. 
However, the functions of c-Abl in innate immunity are still unknown. Here we 
demonstrate that the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein can be 
physically associated with c-Abl in vivo and in vitro. MAVS interacted with 
c-Abl through its Card and TM domain. A phosphotyrosine-specific antibody 
indicated that MAVS was phosphorylated by c-Abl. Functional impairment of c-Abl 
attenuated MAVS or VSV induced type-I IFN production. Importantly, c-Abl 
knockdown in MCF7 cells displayed impaired MAVS-mediated NF-kappaB and IRF3 
activation. Taken together, our results suggest that c-Abl modulates innate 
immune response through MAVS.
