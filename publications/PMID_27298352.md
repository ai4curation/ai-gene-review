Membrane recruitment of coatomer and formation of coat protein I (COPI)-coated 
vesicles is crucial to homeostasis in the early secretory pathway. The 
conformational dynamics of COPI during cargo capture and vesicle formation is 
incompletely understood. By scanning the length of δ-COP via functional 
complementation in yeast, we dissect the domains of the δ-COP subunit. We show 
that the μ-homology domain is dispensable for COPI function in the early 
secretory pathway, whereas the N-terminal longin domain is essential. We map a 
previously uncharacterized helix, C-terminal to the longin domain, that is 
specifically required for the retrieval of HDEL-bearing endoplasmic 
reticulum-luminal residents. It is positionally analogous to an unstructured 
linker that becomes helical and membrane-facing in the open form of the AP2 
clathrin adaptor complex. Based on the amphipathic nature of the critical helix 
it may probe the membrane for lipid packing defects or mediate interaction with 
cargo and thus contribute to stabilizing membrane-associated coatomer.
