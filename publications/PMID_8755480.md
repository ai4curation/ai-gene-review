Bcl-2 is a major regulator of programmed cell death, a critical process in 
shaping the developing nervous system. To assess whether Bcl-2 is involved in 
regulating neuronal survival and in mediating the neuroprotective action of 
neurotrophic factors, we generated Bcl-2-deficient mice. At birth, the number of 
facial motoneurons, sensory, and sympathetic neurons was not significantly 
changed, and axotomy-induced degeneration of facial motoneurons could still be 
prevented by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or ciliary neurotrophic 
factor (CNTF). Interestingly, substantial degeneration of motoneurons, sensory, 
and sympathetic neurons occurred after the physiological cell death period. 
Accordingly, Bcl-2 is not a permissive factor for the action of neurotrophic 
factors, and although it does not influence prenatal neuronal survival, it is 
crucial for the maintenance of specific populations of neurons during the early 
postnatal period.
