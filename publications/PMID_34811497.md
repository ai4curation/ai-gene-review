HIV-1 infection-induced cGAS-STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling activates innate immunity 
to produce type I interferon (IFN). The HIV-1 nonstructural protein viral 
infectivity factor (Vif) is essential in HIV-1 replication, as it degrades the 
host restriction factor APOBEC3G. However, whether and how it regulates the host 
immune response remains to be determined. In this study, we found that Vif 
inhibited the production of type I IFN to promote immune evasion. HIV-1 
infection induced the activation of the host tyrosine kinase FRK, which 
subsequently phosphorylated the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif 
(ITIM) of Vif and enhanced the interaction between Vif and the cellular tyrosine 
phosphatase SHP-1 to inhibit type I IFN. Mechanistically, the association of Vif 
with SHP-1 facilitated SHP-1 recruitment to STING and inhibited the K63-linked 
ubiquitination of STING at Lys337 by dephosphorylating STING at Tyr162. However, 
the FRK inhibitor D-65495 counteracted the phosphorylation of Vif to block the 
immune evasion of HIV-1 and antagonize infection. These findings reveal a 
previously unknown mechanism through which HIV-1 evades antiviral immunity via 
the ITIM-containing protein to inhibit the posttranslational modification of 
STING. These results provide a molecular basis for the development of new 
therapeutic strategies to treat HIV-1 infection.
