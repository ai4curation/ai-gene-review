Learning, a process by which animals modify their behavior as a result of 
experience, enables organisms to synthesize information from their surroundings 
to acquire resources and avoid danger. We showed that a previous encounter with 
only the odor of pathogenic bacteria prepared Caenorhabditis elegans to survive 
exposure to the pathogen by increasing the heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1)-dependent 
expression of genes encoding molecular chaperones. Experience-mediated 
enhancement of chaperone gene expression required serotonin, which primed HSF-1 
to enhance the expression of molecular chaperone genes by promoting its 
localization to RNA polymerase II-enriched nuclear loci, even before 
transcription occurred. However, HSF-1-dependent chaperone gene expression was 
stimulated only if and when animals encountered the pathogen. Thus, learning 
equips C. elegans to better survive environmental dangers by preemptively and 
specifically initiating transcriptional mechanisms throughout the whole organism 
that prepare the animal to respond rapidly to proteotoxic agents. These studies 
provide one plausible basis for the protective role of environmental enrichment 
in disease.
