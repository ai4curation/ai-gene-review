Progression of the cell cycle and control of apoptosis (programmed cell death) 
are thought to be intimately linked processes, acting to preserve homeostasis 
and developmental morphogenesis. Although proteins that regulate apoptosis have 
been implicated in restraining cell-cycle entry and controlling ploidy 
(chromosome number), the effector molecules at the interface between cell 
proliferation and cell survival have remained elusive. Here we show that a new 
inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein, survivin, is expressed in the G2/M phase 
of the cell cycle in a cycle-regulated manner. At the beginning of mitosis, 
survivin associates with microtubules of the mitotic spindle in a specific and 
saturable reaction that is regulated by microtubule dynamics. Disruption of 
survivin-microtubule interactions results in loss of survivin's anti-apoptosis 
function and increased caspase-3 activity, a mechanism involved in cell death, 
during mitosis. These results indicate that survivin may counteract a default 
induction of apoptosis in G2/M phase. The overexpression of survivin in cancer 
may overcome this apoptotic checkpoint and favour aberrant progression of 
transformed cells through mitosis.
