Human p43 is associated with macromolecular tRNA synthase complex and known as a 
precursor of endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II). 
Interestingly, p43 is also secreted to induce proinflammatory genes. Although 
p43 itself seems to be a cytokine working at physiological conditions, most of 
the functional studies have been obtained with its C-terminal equivalent, EMAP 
II. To gain an insight into the working mechanism of p43/EMAP II, we used EMAP 
II and searched for an interacting cell surface molecule. The level of EMAP 
II-binding molecule(s) was significantly increased in serum-starved tumor cells. 
Thus, the EMAP II-binding molecule was isolated from the membrane of the 
serum-starved CEM cell. The isolated protein was determined to be the alpha 
subunit of ATP synthase. The interaction of EMAP II and alpha-ATP synthase was 
confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in vitro pull down assays and 
blocked with the antibodies raised against EMAP II and alpha-ATP synthase. The 
binding of EMAP II to the surface of serum-starved cells was inhibited in the 
presence of soluble alpha-ATP synthase. EMAP II inhibited the growth of 
endothelial cells, and this effect was relieved by soluble alpha-ATP synthase. 
Anti-alpha-ATP synthase antibody also showed an inhibitory effect on the 
proliferation of endothelial cells mimicking the activity of EMAP II. These 
results suggest the potential interaction of p43/EMAP II with alpha-ATP synthase 
and its role in the proliferation of endothelial cells.
