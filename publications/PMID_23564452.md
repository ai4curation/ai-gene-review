Scap is a polytopic protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that controls 
cholesterol homeostasis by transporting sterol regulatory element-binding 
proteins (SREBPs) from the ER to the Golgi complex. Scap has eight transmembrane 
helices (TM) joined by four small hydrophilic loops and three large loops. Two 
of the large loops (Loops 1 and 7) are in the ER lumen, and the other large loop 
(Loop 6) faces the cytosol where it binds COPII proteins that initiate transport 
to Golgi. Cholesterol binding to Loop 1 alters the configuration of Loop 6, 
precluding COPII binding and preventing the exit of Scap from the ER. Here, we 
create a point mutation (Y640S) in luminal Loop 7 that prevents Scap movement to 
Golgi. Trypsin cleavage assays show that Loop 6 of Scap(Y640S) is always in the 
configuration that precludes COPII binding, even in the absence of cholesterol. 
When expressed separately by co-transfection, the NH2-terminal portion of Scap 
(containing TM helices 1-6, including Loop 1) binds to the COOH-terminal portion 
(containing TM helices 7-8 and Loop 7) as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. 
This binding does not occur when Loop 7 contains the Y640S mutation. 
Co-immunoprecipitation is also abolished by a point mutation in Loop 1 (Y234A) 
that also prevents Scap movement. These data suggest that Scap Loop 1 must 
interact with Loop 7 to maintain Loop 6 in the configuration that permits COPII 
binding. These results help explain the operation of Scap as a sterol sensor.

Introduction

Scap is a polytopic membrane protein that binds and transports sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 4 from their sites of origin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to their sites of proteolytic processing in the Golgi complex ( 1 ). After their release in the Golgi complex, the active segments of SREBPs translocate to the nucleus, where they activate all of the genes necessary to produce cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids ( 2 ). The transport activity of Scap is mediated by the binding of COPII to a cytosolic loop (Loop 6) of Scap ( 3 ). When cholesterol levels in the ER rise above 4–5% of ER lipids, Loop 6 undergoes a conformational change that precludes COPII protein binding ( 4 , 5 ). This change is facilitated by the binding of Scap to another ER protein called Insig ( 6 ). The net result is prevention of the proteolytic processing of SREBPs. As a result, cholesterol synthesis declines. This feedback mechanism ensures a constant level of cholesterol in cell membranes.

Recent studies have begun to dissect the functional domains of Scap (see Fig. 1 ). The protein has eight transmembrane helices separated by luminal and cytosolic loops ( 7 ). Three of these loops are large enough to have structure: Loops 1 and 7, which are luminal, and Loop 6, which is cytosolic. The cholesterol binding site was recently localized to luminal Loop 1 ( 8 ). Somehow, this binding reaction in luminal Loop 1 must be communicated to cytosolic Loop 6 to change its conformation. One possibility is that luminal Loop 1 interacts with luminal Loop 7, which might alter Loop 6 through a direct action mediated by transmembrane helix 7.

We recently identified tyrosine 234 in Loop 1 as an essential residue for the transport activity of Scap. When this tyrosine is replaced by alanine (Y234A), Scap continues to bind SREBPs, but it can no longer carry the proteins to the Golgi complex ( 8 ). In the current studies, we have identified another crucial tyrosine at position 640 in luminal Loop 7. When this tyrosine is replaced by serine (Y640S), Scap also loses the ability to transport SREBPs. We provide evidence that these two tyrosines are necessary for the intramolecular binding between Scap segments that contain Loop 1 and those that contain Loop 7, an interaction that appears to be crucial for the transport activity of Scap.

RESULTS

Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the membrane domain of Scap. The protein has eight apparent transmembrane helices and three large loops ( 7 ). Loops 1 and 7 (245 amino acids and 173 amino acids, respectively) project into the lumen of the ER. Loop 6 projects into the cytosol. Loop 6 contains the MELADL sequence that is the recognition site for COPII proteins that cluster the Scap-SREBP complex into coated vesicles for transport to the Golgi ( 3 ). When cholesterol accumulates in ER membranes, Loop 6 undergoes a conformational change that precludes COPII protein binding and abrogates ER-to-Golgi transport ( 4 ). When expressed as a recombinant protein segment, Loop 1 binds cholesterol in vitro ( 8 ). The specificity of sterol binding to Loop 1 mimics the binding specificity of sterol binding to the entire membrane domain of Scap. A point mutation in Loop 1 (Y234A) renders Loop 6 of Scap in the closed COPII-inaccessible configuration even in sterol-depleted membranes and abrogates movement to the Golgi ( 8 ). The other large intraluminal loop (Loop 7) is the subject of the current study.

In an initial attempt to characterize the function of Loop 7, we conducted an alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of the entire loop by systematic replacement of every pair or trio of contiguous residues with alanines. Plasmids encoding the mutant Scaps were transfected into Scap-deficient SRD-13A CHO cells together with a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under control of an SRE-dependent promoter. To control for transfection efficiency, we also transfected a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase driven by a constitutive thymidine kinase promoter, and we included a plasmid encoding Insig-1 to assist in the sterol-mediated inhibition of Scap transport. As shown in Fig. 2 A , most of the Loop 7 mutants behaved like wild-type Scap in restoring SREBP cleavage as measured by the sterol-regulated increase in luciferase activity. Four of the mutants showed a marked reduction in the ability to elicit activation of the SRE-dependent promoter (indicated by red asterisks ). All of these defective mutants clustered in the region of Scap between residues 640 and 657.

All four of the severely defective mutants in Fig. 2 A consisted of three contiguous alanine substitutions. When any of the individual residues in these triplets were changed to alanine, there were only minor losses of function ( Fig. 2 B ). Reasoning that the single alanine substitutions were not drastic enough to perturb function, we selected three hydrophobic residues (Tyr-640, Tyr-648, and Ile-655) and replaced them individually with hydrophilic or charged residues (Ser, Gln, Asp, or Lys). Several of these single substitutions severely reduced SREBP-dependent luciferase activity ( Fig. 2 C ). For further study, we chose Y640S.

To study SREBP cleavage directly, we transfected plasmids encoding WT or Y640S Scap into Scap-deficient SRD-13A cells together with a plasmid containing epitope-tagged SREBP-2. Expression of Scap was driven by the weak TK promoter so as to produce low level expression of Scap, which does not overwhelm endogenous Insigs and thereby facilitates sterol-dependent inhibition of processing. Cells were incubated in sterol-depleted medium with or without added cholesterol. After cells were harvested, nuclear extracts and membrane fractions were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As reported previously ( 25 ), in the absence of Scap, we failed to visualize a nuclear fragment of SREBP-2 ( Fig. 3 A , lane 1 ). SREBP-2 was also not observed in the membrane fraction because the membrane-bound precursor is rapidly degraded in the absence of Scap ( 22 ). When WT Scap was co-transfected, we visualized the membrane form of SREBP-2, indicating that the precursor was stabilized ( lanes 2 and 3 ). We also observed the nuclear form of SREBP-2, and this was reduced by cholesterol. The Y640S Scap mutant stabilized the membrane precursor form of SREBP-2, indicating that it bound the precursor, but it did not generate any nuclear form ( lanes 4 and 5 ). When Insig-1 was transfected together with WT Scap, we observed a more profound cholesterol-mediated reduction in nuclear SREBP-2 ( lanes 6 and 7 ). Again, Scap Y640S stabilized the membrane form of SREBP-2, but it did not generate the nuclear form ( lanes 8 and 9 ). We blotted the membrane fractions with antibodies to the epitope tags on Scap and Insig-1 to show that comparable levels were expressed in all of the transfected cells.

We previously showed that overexpression of WT Scap, driven by the strong CMV promoter, saturates Insig and prevents cholesterol from blocking the transport and cleavage of SREBP-2 ( 26 ). To test whether the Y640S mutant would also saturate Insig, we transfected a plasmid encoding Scap(Y640S) driven by the CMV promoter. As shown in Fig. 3 B , transfection of TK-driven WT Scap stabilized the membrane SREBP-2 precursor and restored cleavage in the SRD-13A cells, and cleavage was reduced by cholesterol ( lanes 1–3 ). Scap(Y640S) stabilized the SREBP-2 precursor, but it did not restore cleavage even when driven by the strong CMV promoter ( lanes 4 and 5 ). Importantly, when co-transfected together with WT Scap, the CMV-driven Scap(Y640S) prevented cholesterol-mediated suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage ( lanes 6 and 7 ). This prevention persisted even when we co-transfected a plasmid encoding Insig-1 ( lanes 12 and 13 ). These data indicate that Scap(Y640S) is capable of binding and saturating Insig-1, a conclusion that was confirmed by direct co-immunoprecipitation (see below).

We previously showed that WT Scap becomes glycosylated in the ER, and the carbohydrates are sensitive to removal by endoglycosidase H ( 27 ). Fig. 4 A repeats this result and shows that the Y640S mutant is similarly glycosylated. In Fig. 4 B , we used our previously described trypsin digestion assay ( 9 , 24 ) to detect the cholesterol-induced change in the conformation of Loop 6 of WT Scap and the Y640S and Y234A mutants. SRD-13A cells were transfected with plasmids encoding one of these proteins. Sealed membrane vesicles were prepared, incubated with varying amounts of cholesterol, and digested with trypsin followed by treatment with peptide- N -glycosidase F and SDS-PAGE. A trypsin-protected fragment of Scap was visualized by blotting with a monoclonal antibody directed against luminal Loop 7 ( Fig. 1 ). In the absence of cholesterol, WT Scap gave a single band of 250 amino acids at ∼30 kDa ( lane 2 ), which is produced by trypsin cleavage at arginine 496 and a cluster of arginines at residues 747–750 ( 9 ) ( Fig. 1 ). In the presence of cholesterol, a new trypsin-protected band of ∼241 amino acids was detected ( lanes 5 and 8 ). The lower band is generated by cleavage at arginines 503/505, which become exposed to trypsin as a result of a cholesterol-induced conformation change in Scap Loop 6 ( 9 , 24 ). The Y640S and Y234A mutants both showed the lower band even in the absence of cholesterol ( lanes 3 and 4 ). When cholesterol was added to the Y640S mutant, the upper band disappeared and the lower band increased ( lanes 6 and 9 ). In contrast, the Y234A mutant showed little change in the presence of cholesterol ( lanes 7 and 10 ).

To confirm the interaction of Scap(Y640S) with Insig-1, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment ( Fig. 4 C ). SRD-13A cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged Insig-1 and WT or Y640S Scap. The cells were incubated in the absence of sterols or in the presence of cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. Membranes were solubilized, and the Myc-tagged Insig-1 was precipitated on anti-Myc beads. The eluted proteins were blotted with anti-Scap or anti-Insig-1. In the absence of Insig-1 expression, no WT Scap was precipitated by the anti-Myc beads ( lane 1 ). When Myc-Insig-1 was expressed, a small amount of Scap was co-immunoprecipitated ( lane 2 ), and this increased when cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol was added to the cells ( lanes 3 and 4 ). In the absence of sterols, Scap(Y640S) was co-precipitated with Myc-Insig-1 ( lane 5 ), and there was no further increase when cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol was added ( lanes 6 and 7 ). These data indicate that Scap(Y640S) retains the ability to bind to Insig-1, and it does so even in the absence of cholesterol.

The failure of Scap(Y640S) to reach the Golgi was confirmed by the immunofluorescence experiment of Fig. 5 . SV589 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-tagged WT Scap or the Y640S mutant. The cells were incubated with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin to remove cholesterol and stimulate Scap translocation to the Golgi. We included cycloheximide to minimize fluorescence due to newly synthesized Scap. The cells were permeabilized and immunostained for the Golgi marker GM130 using an antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594, which fluoresces red. We also added Hoechst 33342, which stains nuclei blue. With WT Scap, the GFP signal was concentrated in discrete particles that stained for GM130, indicating that they represented Golgi stacks ( upper panels ). In sharp contrast, the GFP-tagged Scap(Y640S) showed a lacy distribution consistent with retention in the ER (lower panels). The images shown in Fig. 5 are representative of many transfected cells that were examined individually. Of the 1565 transfected WT cells examined, Scap was localized to the ER in 15% of cells and to the Golgi in 85% of cells, whereas in the 1000 transfected Y640S mutant cells examined, Scap was visualized in the ER in >98% of cells.

Previously, we transfected cells simultaneously with a plasmid encoding the TM1–6 portion of Scap and a second plasmid encoding the remainder of the protein (TM7 to the COOH-terminal end of the WD repeat domain) ( 4 , 26 ). We refer to the latter portion as TM7-end ( Fig. 6 A ). We showed that these two segments interact with each other as measured by co-immunoprecipitation assays and that they reconstitute SREBP transport activity. Fig. 6 B shows a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in which we transfected SRD-13A cells with a plasmid encoding either WT or the Y234A mutant version of Myc-tagged TM1–6 together with a second plasmid encoding WT TM7-end. We also transfected the cells with WT TM1–6 together with Y640S(TM7-end). Cells were incubated in the absence of sterols or in the presence of cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. We isolated the Myc-tagged TM1–6 segment on anti-Myc beads, eluted the bound proteins, and probed immunoblots with an antibody against TM7-end. When both segments were WT, the TM7-end was co-immunoprecipitated with TM1–6 (see pellet in bottom panel , lane 3 ). There was little effect when the cells were incubated with 25-hydroxycholesterol ( lane 5 ). In contrast, cholesterol reduced the amount of co-immunoprecipitated Scap(TM7-end) by about 50%. We observed a similar 50% reduction in more than 10 experiments in which we varied the ratio between the TM1–6 fragment and the TM7-end fragment and in which we performed the co-immunoprecipitation with or without co-transfection with a plasmid encoding Insig-1. All of these experiments were performed by exposing the cells to maximal concentrations of cholesterol/methyl-β-cyclodextrin (30 μ m ). In none of the experiments did 25-hydroxycholesterol reduce the co-immunoprecipitation.

As shown in Fig. 6 B , lanes 6–8 , the Y640S mutant TM7-end segment failed to co-immunoprecipitate with the WT TM1–6 segment. Similarly, the Y234A mutant TM1–6 failed to co-immunoprecipitate with WT TM7-end ( lanes 9–11 ). Thus, point mutations either in Loop 1 or in Loop 7 can abolish the interaction between the TM1–6 segment and the TM7-end segment of Scap.

DISCUSSION

In a previous study, we showed that cholesterol binds to luminal Loop 1 of Scap. We also created a point mutation in Loop 1 (Y234A) that rendered Scap unable to transport SREBP-2 to the Golgi complex even in the absence of sterols ( 8 ). We used trypsin digestion assays to assess the conformation of Loop 6, which contains the MELADL sequence that binds COPII proteins. These digestions revealed that Loop 6 was in the closed conformation ( i.e. the conformation that does not bind COPII proteins) even in the absence of sterols. In the current studies, we have created a point mutation in the other large luminal domain of Scap (Loop 7) that has the same effects as the Loop 1 mutation. In cells expressing Scap with this Y640S mutation, Loop 6 also assumed the closed conformation in the absence of sterols ( Fig. 4 B ). Scap(Y640S) also failed to transport SREBPs to the Golgi as revealed by SREBP processing assays ( Fig. 3 A ) and by immunofluorescence localization ( Fig. 5 ).

We considered the possibility that Scap(Y640S) is misfolded and therefore precluded from exiting the ER through the action of the ER quality control system. Several observations argue against this possibility. First, Scap(Y640S) stabilizes the membrane precursor of SREBP-2, which is rapidly degraded in the absence of Scap ( Fig. 3 A ) ( 22 ). Second, Scap(Y640S) binds Insig-1 as determined by direct co-immunoprecipitation ( Fig. 4 C ) and by the observation that overexpression of Scap(Y640S) saturated Insig-1 and allowed WT Scap to carry SREBPs to the Golgi even in the presence of cholesterol ( Fig. 3 B ). We conclude that Scap(Y640S) is properly folded.

The fact that point mutations in Loop 1 and Loop 7 block Scap movement raises the possibility that these two loops must interact in order for this movement to occur. This hypothesis is supported by the co-immunoprecipitation experiment of Fig. 6 . When we expressed WT Scap(TM1–6) and WT Scap(TM7-end) in the same cells, the two proteins bound to each other, and they could be co-immunoprecipitated. When either the mutant TM1–6 segment or the mutant TM7-end segment was substituted for the corresponding WT segment, co-immunoprecipitation was abolished. Cholesterol reduced the amount of co-immunoprecipitation by about 50% ( Fig. 6 B , lane 5 ). This result was reproduced in more than 10 other experiments. In all of these experiments, 25-hydroxycholesterol failed to reduce the co-immunoprecipitation. This failure persisted even when we co-expressed Insig-1 by transfection.

Interaction of luminal Loop 1 of Scap with luminal Loop 7 provides a potential mechanism by which binding of cholesterol to Loop 1 would alter the conformation of cytosolic Loop 6. If cholesterol binding changes the conformation of Loop 1, and if this is transmitted to Loop 7, then Loop 7 might alter the conformation of Loop 6 through some effect on transmembrane helix 7, which joins the two loops ( Fig. 1 ). The interaction between Loops 1 and 7 might occur within a single Scap monomer or between adjacent molecules in the Scap tetramer ( 28 ). The failure of 25-hydroxycholesterol to reduce the co-immunoprecipitation between Scap(TM1–6) and Scap(TM7-end) might be explained by our previous observation that 25-hydroxycholesterol blocks Scap movement not by binding to Scap, but rather by binding to Insig ( 4 , 29 ). Our findings therefore raise the possibility that the 25-hydroxycholesterol-Insig complex directly blocks COPII binding to the MELADL sequence in Scap Loop 6 without a requirement for dissociation between Loop 1 and Loop 7. Experiments are under way to test these hypotheses.
