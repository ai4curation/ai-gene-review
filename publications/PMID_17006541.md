Regulation of E2F1-mediated apoptosis is essential for proper cellular growth. 
This control requires TopBP1, a BRCT (BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal) domain-containing 
protein, which interacts with E2F1 but not other E2Fs and represses its 
proapoptotic activity. We now show that the regulation of E2F1 by TopBP1 
involves the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, and is 
independent of pocket proteins. Akt phosphorylates TopBP1 in vitro and in vivo. 
Phosphorylation by Akt induces oligomerization of TopBP1 through its seventh and 
eighth BRCT domains. The Akt-dependent oligomerization is crucial for TopBP1 to 
interact with and repress E2F1. Akt phosphorylation is also required for 
interaction between TopBP1 and Miz1 or HPV16 E2, and repression of Miz1 
transcriptional activity, suggesting a general role for TopBP1 oligomerization 
in the control of transcription factors. Together, this study defines a novel 
pathway involving PI3K-Akt-TopBP1 for specific control of E2F1 apoptosis, in 
parallel with cyclin-Cdk-Rb for general control of E2F activities.
