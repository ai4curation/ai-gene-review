Mixed lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5) has been implicated in multiple aspects of cell 
physiology, such as hematopoiesis, cell cycle control and chromatin regulatory 
network. In this study, we present evidence that MLL5 is involved in the 
camptothecin (CPT)-induced p53 activation. CPT promoted the degradation of MLL5 
protein in a time- and dose-dependent manner in actively replicating cells. The 
downregulation of MLL5 led to phosphorylation of p53 at Ser392, which was 
abrogated by exogenous overexpression of MLL5. In MLL5-knockdown cells, p53 
protein was stabilized and bound to DNA with higher affinity, leading to 
activation of downstream genes. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that MLL5 
preferentially interacted with the tetramerized form of p53, and knockdown of 
MLL5 promoted chromatin accumulation of p53 tetramers, suggesting that the 
association of MLL5 with p53 may prevent the p53 tetramers from binding to the 
chromatin target sites. The role of MLL5 in CPT-induced p53 activation was 
conserved in developing zebrafish, where CPT downregulated zebrafish Mll5 
protein, and the microinjection of zebrafish mll5 mRNA substantially blocked the 
CPT-induced apoptosis. In summary, our study proposed MLL5 as a novel component 
in the regulation of p53 homeostasis and a new cellular determinant of CPT.
