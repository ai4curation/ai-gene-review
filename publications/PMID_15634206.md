The Arabidopsis genome contains six NPR1-related genes. Given the pivotal role 
played by NPR1 in controlling salicylic acid (SA)-mediated gene expression and 
disease resistance, functional characterization of other family members appears 
to be justified. Reverse genetics was used to analyze the role of one NPR1-like 
gene, which we called NPR4. The NPR4 protein shares 36% identity with NPR1 and 
interacts with the same spectrum of TGA transcription factors in yeast 
two-hybrid assays. Plants with T-DNA insertions in NPR4 are more susceptible to 
the virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringe pv. tomato DC3000. This 
phenotype is complemented by expression of the wild type NPR4 coding region. As 
determined by the parasite reproduction, the npr4-1 mutant is more susceptible 
to the fungal pathogen Erysiphe cichoracearum, but does not differ markedly from 
wild type in its interaction with virulent and avirulent strains of the oomycete 
Peronospora parasitica. In leaves of wild-type plants, NPR4 mRNA levels increase 
following pathogen challenge or SA treatment, and decrease rapidly following 
methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) treatment. Transcripts of the pathogenesis-related 
(PR) genes PR-1, PR-2, and PR-5 are only marginally reduced in the npr4-1 mutant 
following pathogen challenge or SA treatment. This reduction of PR gene 
expression is more pronounced when leaves are challenged with the bacterial 
pathogen following SA treatment. Expression of the jasmonic acid-dependent 
pathway marker gene PDF1.2 is compromised in npr4-1 leaves following application 
of MeJA or a combination of SA and MeJA. These results indicate that NPR4 is 
required for basal defense against pathogens, and that it may be implicated in 
the cross-talk between the SA- and JA-dependent signaling pathways.
