Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs) are expressed primarily in the plasma membrane of 
most cell types, where they mediate electrogenic exchange of one Ca2+ for three 
Na+ ions, depending on Ca2+ and Na+ electrochemical gradients across the 
membrane. Three mammalian NCX isoforms (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3) are each encoded 
by a distinct gene. Here, we report that NCX2 and NCX3 protein and mRNA levels 
are relatively reduced in hippocampal CA1 of APP23 and APP-KI mice. Likewise, 
NCX2+/- or NCX3+/- mice exhibited impaired hippocampal LTP and memory-related 
behaviors. Moreover, relative to controls, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein 
kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation significantly decreased in NCX2+/- mouse 
hippocampus but increased in hippocampus of NCX3+/- mice. NCX2 or NCX3 
heterozygotes displayed impaired maintenance of hippocampal LTP, a phenotype 
that in NCX2+/- mice was correlated with elevated calcineurin activity and 
rescued by treatment with the calcineurin (CaN) inhibitor FK506. Likewise, FK506 
treatment significantly restored impaired hippocampal LTP in APP-KI mice. 
Moreover, Ca2+ clearance after depolarization following high frequency 
stimulation was slightly delayed in hippocampal CA1 regions of NCX2+/- mice. 
Electron microscopy revealed relatively decreased synaptic density in CA1 of 
NCX2+/- mice, while the number of spines with perforated synapses in CA1 
significantly increased in NCX3+/- mice. We conclude that memory impairment seen 
in NCX2+/- and NCX3+/- mice reflect dysregulated hippocampal CaMKII activity, 
which alters dendritic spine morphology, findings with implications for memory 
deficits seen in Alzheimer's disease model mice.
