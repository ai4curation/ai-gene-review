Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) regulates cell growth in response to 
nutrients and growth factors. Although TORC1 signaling has been thoroughly 
studied at the cellular level, the regulation of TORC1 in multicellular tissues 
and organs has remained elusive. Here we found that TORC1 is selectively 
activated in the second mitotic wave (SMW), the terminal synchronous cell 
division, of the developing Drosophila eye. We demonstrated that Hedgehog (Hh) 
signaling regulates TORC1 through E2F1 and the cyclin D/Cdk4 complex in the SMW, 
and this regulation is independent from insulin and amino acid signaling 
pathways. TORC1 is necessary for the proper G1/S transition of the cells, and 
the activation of TORC1 rescues the cell-cycle defect of Hh signaling-deficient 
cells in the SMW. Based on this evolutionarily conserved regulation of TORC1 by 
Hh signaling, we propose that Hh-dependent developmental signaling pathways 
spatially regulate TORC1 activity in multicellular organisms.
