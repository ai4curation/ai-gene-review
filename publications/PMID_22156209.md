The cell cycle-regulated expression of core histone genes is required for DNA 
replication and proper cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells. Although some 
factors involved in histone gene transcription are known, the molecular 
mechanisms that ensure proper induction of histone gene expression during S 
phase remain enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that S-phase transcription of the 
model histone gene HTA1 in yeast is regulated by a novel attach-release 
mechanism involving phosphorylation of the conserved chromatin boundary protein 
Yta7 by both cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and casein kinase 2 (CK2). Outside 
S phase, integrity of the AAA-ATPase domain is required for Yta7 boundary 
function, as defined by correct positioning of the histone chaperone Rtt106 and 
the chromatin remodeling complex RSC. Conversely, in S phase, Yta7 is 
hyperphosphorylated, causing its release from HTA1 chromatin and productive 
transcription. Most importantly, abrogation of Yta7 phosphorylation results in 
constitutive attachment of Yta7 to HTA1 chromatin, preventing efficient 
transcription post-recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Our study 
identified the chromatin boundary protein Yta7 as a key regulator that links 
S-phase kinases with RNAPII function at cell cycle-regulated histone gene 
promoters.

## Full Text

Histones are important cell cycle-regulated genes, and their expression is tightly restricted to S phase to ensure proper DNA replication and cell cycle progression. The mechanisms regulating histone gene expression are not completely understood. In this paper, Kurat et al. find that phosphorylation and regulation of a chromatin boundary protein by cell cycle kinases is needed for cell cycle-dependent histone gene expression. The authors show that Yta7, a conserved chromatin boundary protein, regulates HTA1 transcription through a novel “attach–release” mechanism. Yta7 binds to chromatin flanking the yeast core histone HTA1 gene. However, during S phase, Cdk1 and CK2 phosphorylate Yta1, causing dissociation from chromatin and expression of HTA1. These results suggest that the Yta7 boundary protein temporally coordinates chromatin domains, ensuring appropriate cell cycle regulation of histone gene expression.
