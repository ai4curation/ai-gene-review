AIMS: Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by 
pathological protein aggregates and inadequate activation of cell cycle 
regulating proteins. Recently, Smad proteins were identified to control the 
expression of AD relevant proteins such as APP, CDK4 and CDK inhibitors, both 
critical regulators of cell cycle activation. This might indicate a central role 
for Smads in AD pathology where they show a substantial deficiency and disturbed 
subcellular distribution in neurones. Still, the mechanisms driving relocation 
and decrease of neuronal Smad in AD are not well understood. However, Pin1, a 
peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase, which allows isomerization of tau protein, 
was recently identified also controlling the fate of Smads. Here we analyse a 
possible role of Pin1 for Smad disturbances in AD.
METHODS: Multiple immunofluorescence labelling and confocal laser-scanning 
microscopy were performed to examine the localization of Smad and Pin1 in human 
control and AD hippocampi. Ectopic Pin1 expression in neuronal cell cultures 
combined with Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation allowed studying 
Smad level and subcellular distribution. Luciferase reporter assays, 
electromobility shift, RNAi-technique and qRT-PCR revealed a potential 
transcriptional impact of Smad on Pin1 promoter.
RESULTS: We report on a colocalization of phosphorylated Smad in AD with Pin1. 
Pin1 does not only affect Smad phosphorylation and stability but also regulates 
subcellular localization of Smad2 and supports its binding to phosphorylated tau 
protein. Smads, in turn, exert a negative feed-back regulation on Pin1.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest both Smad proteins and Pin1 to be elements of a 
vicious circle with potential pathogenetic significance in AD.
