The H/ACA motif of human telomerase RNA (hTR) directs specific pathways of 
endogenous telomerase holoenzyme assembly, function, and regulation. 
Similarities between hTR and other H/ACA RNAs have been established, but 
differences have not been explored even though unique features of hTR H/ACA RNP 
assembly give rise to telomerase deficiency in human disease. Here, we define 
hTR H/ACA RNA and RNP architecture using RNA accumulation, RNP affinity 
purification, and primer extension activity assays. First, we evaluate 
alternative folding models for the hTR H/ACA motif 5' hairpin. Second, we 
demonstrate an unanticipated and surprisingly general asymmetry of 5' and 3' 
hairpin requirements for H/ACA RNA accumulation. Third, we establish that hTR 
assembles not one but two sets of all four of the H/ACA RNP core proteins, 
dyskerin, NOP10, NHP2, and GAR1. Fourth, we address a difference in predicted 
specificities of hTR association with the holoenzyme subunit WDR79/TCAB1. 
Together, these results complete the analysis of hTR elements required for 
active RNP biogenesis and define the interaction specificities and 
stoichiometries of all functionally essential human telomerase holoenzyme 
subunits. This study uncovers unexpected similarities but also differences 
between telomerase and other H/ACA RNPs that allow a unique specificity of 
telomerase biogenesis and regulation.
