During the process of spore formation in Bacillus subtilis, many membrane 
proteins localize to the polar septum where they participate in morphogenesis 
and signal transduction. The forespore membrane protein SpoIIQ plays a central 
role in anchoring several mother-cell membrane proteins in the septal membrane. 
Here, we report that SpoIIQ is also responsible for anchoring a membrane protein 
on the forespore side of the sporulation septum. Co-immunoprecipitation 
experiments reveal that SpoIIQ resides in a complex with the polytopic membrane 
protein SpoIIE. During the early stages of sporulation, SpoIIE participates in 
the switch from medial to polar division and co-localizes with FtsZ at the polar 
septum. We show that after cytokinesis, SpoIIE is released from the septum and 
transiently localizes to all membranes in the forespore compartment. Upon the 
initiation of engulfment, it specifically re-localizes to the septal membrane on 
the forespore side. Importantly, the re-localization of SpoIIE to the engulfing 
septum requires SpoIIQ. These results indicate that SpoIIQ is required to anchor 
membrane proteins on both sides of the division septum. Moreover, our data 
suggest that forespore membrane proteins can localize to the septal membrane by 
diffusion-and-capture as has been described for membrane proteins in the mother 
cell. Finally, our results raise the intriguing possibility that SpoIIE has an 
uncharacterized function at a late stage of sporulation.
