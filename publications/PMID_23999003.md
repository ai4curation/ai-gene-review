BACKGROUND: The formation of dendrites by melanocytes is highly analogous to 
that process in neural cells. We previously reported that a C2 domain-containing 
protein, copine-1, is involved in the extension of dendrites by neural cells. 
However, the effect of C2 domain-containing proteins in dendrite formation by 
melanocytes has not yet been elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to screen novel C2 domain-containing 
proteins related to dendrite outgrowth in melanocytes and to investigate their 
precise roles in melanocyte dendrite formation during differentiation.
METHODS: We transduced mouse melan-a melanocytes with a recombinant adenovirus 
expressing a C2 domain library. Dendrite elongation, melanin content, tyrosinase 
activity and Western blot analyses were conducted to elucidate the possible 
underlying mechanisms of action in melanocytes.
RESULTS: Sixteen sets of C2 domain-containing proteins were identified whose 
over-expression resulted in dendrite lengthening. Among those, we focused on the 
C2 domain of SYT14L (truncated mutant of SYT14L) in this study. Forced 
expression of full length SYT14L or the C2 domain of SYT14L induced a 
significant elongation of dendrite length accompanied by the induction of 
melanocyte differentiation-related markers, including melanin synthesis, 
tyrosinase catalytic activity and the expression of tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase 
related protein-1 (TRP-1) and TRP-2. In addition, over-expression of either the 
C2 domain or the full length form of SYT14L significantly increased the 
phosphorylation of ERK and CREB.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SYT14L, especially its C2 domain, may 
play an important role in regulating melanocyte differentiation through the 
modulation of ERK and (or) CREB signaling.
