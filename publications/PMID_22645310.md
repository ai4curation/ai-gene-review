The Wnt/β-catenin pathway promotes proliferation of neural progenitor cells 
(NPCs) at early stages and induces neuronal differentiation from NPCs at late 
stages, but the molecular mechanisms that control this stage-specific response 
are unclear. Pin1 is a prolyl isomerase that regulates cell signaling uniquely 
by controlling protein conformation after phosphorylation, but its role in 
neuronal differentiation is not known. Here we found that whereas Pin1 depletion 
suppresses neuronal differentiation, Pin1 overexpression enhances it, without 
any effects on gliogenesis from NPCs in vitro. Consequently, Pin1-null mice have 
significantly fewer upper layer neurons in the motor cortex and severely 
impaired motor activity during the neonatal stage. A proteomic approach 
identified β-catenin as a major substrate for Pin1 in NPCs, in which Pin1 
stabilizes β-catenin. As a result, Pin1 knockout leads to reduced β-catenin 
during differentiation but not proliferation of NPCs in developing brains. 
Importantly, defective neuronal differentiation in Pin1 knockout NPCs is fully 
rescued in vitro by overexpression of β-catenin but not a β-catenin mutant that

INTRODUCTION

Neurons are generated from neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) during brain development. Recently, it has been emerging that an array of extracellular factors, including Wnt, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and bone morphogenic proteins, trigger signaling cascades leading to activation of downstream transcription factors to regulate neuronal differentiation from NPCs ( 6 , 16 , 18 , 22 , 23 , 33 , 51 , 68 , 86 , 91 ). However, little is known about how these signaling pathways are integrated to control the highly ordered events of neuronal differentiation to generate neurons in different layers or subregions of the brain during development.

A well-established key signaling pathway in neurogenesis is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway ( 13 , 16 , 18 , 22 , 46 , 62 ). For example, overexpression of constitutively active β-catenin in NPCs induces neurogenesis and increases cortical size ( 12 , 23 , 90 ). Similarly, overexpression of Wnt3 increases neurogenesis in cortical progenitor cells ( 26 , 43 ) and adult hippocampal stem/progenitor cells ( 34 ). Conversely, ablation of β-catenin inhibits neurogenesis, leading to reduced brain size ( 23 , 90 ). Finally, activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway leads to the formation of β-catenin–TCF complexes to transactivate Wnt target genes, including many proneural transcription factors ( 25 , 30 , 48 , 79 ). Significantly, the in vivo function of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in neuronal differentiation depends on the developmental stage during brain development. It appears to promote proliferation of early NPCs (expansion phase) but induces neuronal differentiation of NPCs in the late stage (neurogenic phase). These stage-dependent responses of NPCs might play a central role in determining the timing of differentiation and the size of the final population of each differentiated cell type ( 23 ). However, the molecular mechanisms that control this developmental stage-specific response of NPCs are not fully understood. Moreover, although the function of β-catenin is regulated by phosphorylation, nothing is known about whether β-catenin is further regulated after phosphorylation to control neuronal differentiation.

Proline-directed protein phosphorylation (pSer/Thr-Pro) is a central signaling mechanism in diverse cellular processes ( 8 , 61 , 66 ). Importantly, recent studies have shown that such phosphorylation events are further regulated by conformational changes after protein phosphorylation ( 38 , 40 ). The pSer/Thr-Pro motifs in certain proteins exist in cis or trans conformation, whose conversion is catalyzed by the unique prolyl isomerase Pin1 ( 39 , 42 , 87 ). Such Pin1-catalyzed conformational regulation after phosphorylation often functions as a molecular timer, regulating many key proteins in diverse cellular processes, such as β-catenin, tau, and APP in neurons ( 32 , 34 , 35 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 64 , 72 , 74 , 89 , 92 , 94 ). In fact, cis and trans conformation-specific functions and their regulation by Pin1 have been demonstrated directly by the development of conformation-specific antibodies ( 55 ).

Significantly, Pin1 is tightly regulated at multiple levels, and its deregulation has an important role in a growing number of pathological conditions, notably cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) ( 3 , 9 , 17 , 19 , 38 , 40 , 49 , 78 , 88 ). For example, we have demonstrated that Pin1 acts on the pThr231-Pro motif in tau to promote tau dephosphorylation and degradation and also on the pThr668-Pro motif in APP to reduce amyloidogenic APP processing and toxic Aβ secretion ( 35 , 41 , 45 , 64 , 65 ). Consequently, Pin1-deficient mice display both tau- and Aβ-related pathologies and neurodegeneration, in an age-dependent manner, resembling many aspects of human Alzheimer's disease ( 35 , 64 ). In contrast, moderate Pin1 overexpression in postnatal neurons effectively suppresses tau-related pathology and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease mouse models ( 34 ). Significantly, Pin1 is inhibited by multiple mechanisms in human Alzheimer's neurons, including downregulation, oxidation, and/or possible single nucleotide polymorphisms ( 35 , 77 , 81 , 84 ). In contrast, the Pin1 single nucleotide polymorphism that prevents its downregulation by the brain-specific transcription factor AP4 is associated with a delayed onset of Alzheimer's disease ( 44 ). These results indicate that Pin1 plays a pivotal role in protecting against age-dependent neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, Pin1 has been shown to regulate several other neuron-enriched proteins, including synphilin-1, BIMEL, gephyrin, neurofilament, and JIP3, which might contribute to neurodegeneration ( 7 , 27 , 52 , 70 , 71 , 76 ). Therefore, the roles of Pin1 in various age-dependent neuropathological conditions have been studied extensively. Although Pin1 levels increase during neuronal differentiation in vitro ( 20 ), little is known about the physiological function of Pin1 during brain development.

In studying this issue, we found that increased Pin1 expression occurs in parallel with NPC differentiation in mouse embryos. Furthermore, Pin1 knockout (KO) in mice specifically inhibits neuronal differentiation in vitro and inhibits the birth of upper but not lower layer neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex, resulting in fewer upper layer neurons in the motor cortex and severely impaired motor activity during the neonatal stage. Moreover, a proteomic approach led to the identification of β-catenin as a major substrate for Pin1 in NPCs, in which Pin1 stabilizes β-catenin by controlling its protein conformation after phosphorylation to promote neuronal differentiation from NPCs. These results demonstrate for the first time that Pin1 is a novel regulator of neuronal differentiation by stabilizing β-catenin and that conformational regulation after phosphorylation is a new mechanism for controlling neuronal differentiation during certain stages of brain development.

DISCUSSION

While Pin1 plays a critical role in age-dependent neurodegeneration, its role in normal brain development is not known. We have shown that Pin1 is highly expressed in NPCs at the late developmental stage and has a major impact on their neuronal differentiation. Without affecting gliogenesis, Pin1 knockout in mice does not affect production of NPCs but specifically inhibits their differentiation into upper but not lower layer neurons in the cerebral cortex, resulting in a significant decrease in upper layer neurons in the motor cortex and severely impaired motor activity during the neonatal stage. Moreover, our proteomic approach to search for the substrate of Pin1 in NPCs led to the finding that Pin1 stabilizes β-catenin in NPCs at late but not early stages during mouse brain development. Finally, stimulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway rescues the neuronal differentiation defect of Pin1 KO NPCs, in a Pin1 binding site-dependent manner. Conversely, blockade of signaling by dominant-negative TCF4 abolishes the increased neuronal differentiation seen with Pin1 overexpression. These results not only identify for the first time a major function for Pin1 in regulating neuronal differentiation of NPCs but also uncover a previously unappreciated mechanism by which Wnt/β-catenin signaling is further regulated after phosphorylation to regulate neuronal differentiation.

The characterization of the unique peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1, which specifically regulates the conformation of certain Pro-directed phosphorylation sites in a subset of proteins, has led to the discovery of a new postphosphorylation regulatory mechanism ( 39 , 69 , 73 , 87 ). Such Pin1-dependent conformational regulation has been shown to regulate many key signaling molecules in many cellular events ( 32 , 34 , 35 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 65 , 72 , 74 , 89 , 92 , 94 ). As for Pin1 function in neurons, it has been shown that Pin1 is expressed in most neurons in the brain but is present at an especially low level in the neurons that are most vulnerable to neurodegeneration in AD ( 35 ). Indeed, Pin1 has been shown to play an important role in age-dependent neurodegeneration in AD and other related disorders. Although Pin1 expression is increased when neuron-like SY5Y cells are induced to undergo neuronal differentiation by use of either retinoic acid or nerve growth factor ( 20 ), little is known about the role of Pin1 in neuronal differentiation and in brain development. In this study, we have shown for the first time that Pin1 protein levels in the brain are much higher during developmental stages than those in the adult, and we uncovered a novel physiological function of Pin1 in cortical neuronal differentiation. Thus, Pin1 plays a critical role during early neuronal development, in addition to its protective role against age-dependent neurodegeneration.

Cortical NPCs sequentially undergo expansion, neurogenic, and gliogenic phases during development. The fate decision of NPCs between proliferation and differentiation determines the number of differentiated cells and the size of each region of the brain. β-Catenin has been shown to play a major role in regulating NPC proliferation and differentiation in mouse embryos, depending on the developmental stage ( 13 , 16 , 18 , 22 , 46 , 62 ). For example, during the expansion phase, transgenic overexpression of stabilized β-catenin in NPCs, under the control of the nestin enhancer, which is known to become active at around E8.5, has been shown to expand the NPC population, resulting in enlarged brains ( 12 ). Using the D6 promoter, which is active from around E11, ectopic expression of a β-catenin–LEF1 fusion protein delays the onset of expression of the neurogenic factors Pax6, Ngn2, and Tbr2 and subsequent neurogenesis, whereas conditional ablation of β-catenin accelerates expression of the same neurogenic genes ( 47 ). Likewise, sustained β-catenin activity in conditionally transgenic animals by use of nestin-Cre driver lines delays maturation of RGC into intermediate progenitors, specifically for the production of upper layer cortical neurons ( 85 ).

On the other hand, at later time points during the neurogenic phase, Wnt signaling instructively promotes neuronal differentiation of cortical NPCs prepared from the E13.5 mouse neocortex ( 23 ). Clonal analysis and serial observations of living clones have revealed that signaling via the canonical Wnt pathway, through activation of β-catenin and TCF, increases the neuronal population at the expense of multipotential NPCs, even under conditions not affecting survival or proliferation of neuronal progenitors. Overexpression of Wnt7a or a stabilized form of β-catenin in mouse cortical NPC cultures from E13.5 induces neuronal differentiation. In contrast, inhibition of Wnt signaling by axin or DKK1 leads to suppression of neuronal differentiation of cortical NPCs in vitro and in the developing mouse neocortex ( 23 ). These results together indicate developmental stage-dependent functions of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in NPCs ( 22 ).

Consistent with this idea, we found impaired neuronal differentiation in Pin1 KO mice at E15.5, with no apparent indication of primary migration defects, as indicated by normal reelin expression in Pin1 KO mice (data not shown), although Pin1 might also contribute to promigratory neuronal functions. Furthermore, at E12.5, there was little Pin1 expression and Pin1 knockout had no effects on β-catenin levels in NPCs (data not shown). However, at E15.5, Pin1 levels were significantly elevated and Pin1 knockout significantly reduced β-catenin levels in NPCs. These results suggest that Pin1 may act mainly during late developmental stages (neurogenic phase) to promote neuronal differentiation, rather than during the earlier NPC expansion phase. In line with our results, a recent paper ( 54 ) suggests that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by overexpression of Wnt3a promotes differentiation of intermediate progenitors into neurons. However, electroporation of Wnt3a also led to RGC expansion at E16.5 ( 54 ). Thus, balance among multiple ligands for Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as well as the developmental stage, might also influence the consequence of the balance between proliferation and differentiation of NPCs.

We showed that Pin1 controls NPC differentiation by binding and stabilizing β-catenin. These results are consistent with the previous finding that Pin1 increases β-catenin levels by inhibiting its degradation, with Pin1 expression tightly correlating with β-catenin levels in many human cancer tissues and cells ( 11 , 28 , 60 , 63 , 74 , 93 ). Tau and APP are also substrates for Pin1, and the Aβ peptide increases the number of newborn hippocampal neurons, with no changes in the rate of cell death or proliferation, suggesting that the Aβ peptide could act on hippocampal neuronal progenitors and promote their differentiation into neurons ( 37 ). Because Pin1 reduces neurotoxic Aβ peptides ( 64 ), it does not seem likely that the impaired neuronal differentiation in Pin1 KO mice is due to APP. Instead, a similar mechanism was reported for embryonic stem cells, in which Pin1 binds and stabilizes Nanog, a transcription factor crucial for the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells ( 53 ). Thus, Pin1 may regulate protein stability of multiple substrates in different stem cells.

Significantly, Pin1 KO mice showed severely impaired motor activity during the neonatal period. Abnormal motor activities during the neonatal period are rarely reported. An example is Dyrk1A transgenic mice, which show a longer latency to initiation of walking at P7 and P10 ( 1 ). Since differentiation from NPCs to immature neurons is impaired in Pin1 KO mice, axonal and dendritic development is also likely to be inhibited, such that synaptic organization is immature during the neonatal stage. Indeed, PSD95 staining showed that synaptic organization in Pin1 KO mice was immature at P9. Pin1 KO mice would be useful for studying the mechanisms of neonatal defects in motor activities.

In summary, we have shown that Pin1 expression is increased in NPCs during certain developmental stages and that Pin1 knockout in mice inhibits the birth of upper but not lower layer neurons in the cerebral cortex, without affecting gliogenesis. Moreover, our proteomic approach identified β-catenin as a major substrate for Pin1 in NPCs, in which Pin1 stabilizes β-catenin by inducing conformational changes after phosphorylation. Consequently, Pin1 knockout leads to reduced β-catenin in NPCs at late but not early stages during brain development. Functionally, overexpression of Wnt or β-catenin, but not a β-catenin mutant that cannot act as a Pin1 substrate, fully rescues the deficits in neuronal differentiation of Pin1 knockout NPCs in vitro . These results not only identify for the first time a major function for Pin1 in regulating neuronal differentiation of NPCs but also uncover a previously unappreciated mechanism by which Wnt/β-catenin signaling is further regulated after phosphorylation to orchestrate the developmental stage-specific response of NPCs during neuronal differentiation.
