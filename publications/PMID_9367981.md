Plant developmental processes are controlled by both endogenous programs and 
environmental stimuli. As a photomorphogenetic mutant, hy5 of Arabidopsis has 
been isolated and characterized. Our detailed characterization has revealed that 
the mutant is deficient in a variety of stimulus responses, including 
gravitropic response and waving growth of roots, as well as light-dependent 
hypocotyl elongation. In the roots and hypocotyl, the hy5 mutation also affects 
greening and specific cell proliferation such as lateral root formation and 
secondary thickening. Those phenotypes indicate that the HY5 gene is responsible 
for the regulation of fundamental developmental processes of the plant cell: 
cell elongation, cell proliferation, and chloroplast development. Molecular 
cloning of the HY5 gene using a T-DNA-tagged mutant has revealed that the gene 
encodes a protein with a bZIP motif, one of the motifs found in transcriptional 
regulators. Nuclear localization of the HY5 protein strongly suggests that the 
HY5 gene modulates the signal transduction pathways under the HY5-related 
development by controlling expression of genes downstream of these pathways.

Abstract

Plant developmental processes are controlled by both endogenous programs and environmental stimuli. As a photomorphogenetic mutant, hy5 of Arabidopsis has been isolated and characterized. Our detailed characterization has revealed that the mutant is deficient in a variety of stimulus responses, including gravitropic response and waving growth of roots, as well as light-dependent hypocotyl elongation. In the roots and hypocotyl, the hy5 mutation also affects greening and specific cell proliferation such as lateral root formation and secondary thickening. Those phenotypes indicate that the HY5 gene is responsible for the regulation of fundamental developmental processes of the plant cell: cell elongation, cell proliferation, and chloroplast development. Molecular cloning of the HY5 gene using a T-DNA-tagged mutant has revealed that the gene encodes a protein with a bZIP motif, one of the motifs found in transcriptional regulators. Nuclear localization of the HY5 protein strongly suggests that the HY5 gene modulates the signal transduction pathways under the HY5-related development by controlling expression of genes downstream of these pathways.

Discussion

The HY5 gene was shown earlier to be a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis of young seedlings ( Koornneef et al. 1980 ; Chory 1992 ; Ang and Deng 1994 ). Detailed characterization of the mutant phenotype has revealed that the hy5 mutant is defective in various aspects of morphogenesis and stimulus responses in the hypocotyl and root. The pleiotropic phenotypes can be classified under three criteria: whether the phenotype is mainly related to cell elongation, to cell proliferation, or to chloroplast development (Table 5 ).

The first group includes four phenotypes. Gravitropic and touching responses of roots are placed in the first group because these responses are thought to be a consequence of regulation of cell elongation ( Wilkins 1966 ; Okada and Shimura 1994 ). It has been shown that the length of root hairs is affected by the touching stimulus ( Okada and Shimura 1994 ). Although the type of stimulus is different, the four phenotypes appear to be based on aberrant cell elongation. Therefore, we propose that one of the molecular functions of the HY5 gene is negative regulation at some common step(s) of the intracellular signal transduction pathways that mediate signals triggered by different physical stimuli for cell elongation.

The second group includes three phenotypes: lateral root elongation, lateral root initiation, and secondary thickening. The lateral root elongation appears to be related to cell elongation. However, the length of mature cells in the lateral roots of the hy5 mutant was about the same as that of the wild type, indicating that the enhanced lateral root elongation of the mutant may be caused by enhanced cell proliferation in the meristem. The hy5 mutation also promoted the initiation of lateral roots, suggesting that the differentiation from pericycle cells to a lateral root primordium may be enhanced in the mutant. Because the structure of lateral root primordia of the mutant looked similar to that of the wild type, the HY5 gene is likely to control the initiation by repressing the cell proliferation in wild-type plants. In the secondary thickening of root and hypocotyl, the HY5 gene is likely to promote or maintain the meristimatic activity in the vascular cambial cells that proliferate and differentiate into xylem and fiber elements. Thus, the HY5 gene controls cell proliferation positively in the secondary thickening, and negatively in the lateral root formation. HY5 may regulate cell division in a tissue-specific manner. Interestingly, the three phenotypes in the second group are not directly related to environmental stimuli; however, they are possibly stimulated by endogenous nutrition conditions or balance of phytohormones.

The third group includes a phenotype of the deficiency of greening of root and hypocotyl. The HY5 gene is likely to promote chloroplast development in the root and hypocotyl, possibly stimulated by light, as in cotyledons and leaves. Because the chloroplast development in roots of wild-type plants is usually accompanied by secondary thickening, the phenotype of reduced greening in the hy5 mutant may be dependent on the reduced secondary thickening in roots. It is worthy to note that the hy5 mutation also gives rise to a reduced gravitropic response, longer root hairs, and enhanced lateral root formation in darkness (data not shown). This indicates that the HY5 gene is likely to play roles in the root growth and the gravitropic response independent of the light signal.

Our molecular analysis has revealed that the HY5 gene encodes a bZIP protein localized in the nucleus. Many bZIP proteins have been isolated from various plant species. In many cases, the bZIP proteins bind to DNA containing an ACGT core sequence. Although the ACGT sequence is known as a core motif for cis -acting elements in promoters of various stimulus-responsive genes in plants, the physiological roles of bZIP class trans -acting factors have been demonstrated only in some cases (for review, see Foster et al. 1994 ; Menkens et at. 1995). Many of the plant bZIP proteins contain extra domains such as a proline-rich region, acidic region, or glutamine-rich region, in addition to the bZIP domain. A proline-rich region of the Arabidopsis GBF1 protein was shown to have the activity of transcriptional activation ( Schindler et al. 1992b ). Highly acidic regions are a common feature of transcriptional activators in eukaryotes ( Cress and Triezenberg 1991 ). The HY5 protein has no obvious domains except the bZIP domain. The lack of potential transcriptional activation domains implies that the HY5 protein may not work as a transcriptional activator. The amino acid sequence of this protein from E-35 to the last amino acid residue shares 70% identity with the STF1A protein of soybean, and the basic region of the HY5 protein is completely identical to that of the STF1A protein. The STF1A protein preferentially binds to DNA sequences containing a TGACGT core, and it weakly binds to DNA sequences containing a G box (Y.-H. Cheong and J.-C. Hong, pers. comm.). A crystallographic study on GCN4 (a yeast bZIP protein)/DNA complex clearly showed that the basic region interacts with the target DNA ( Ellenberger et al. 1992 ). Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the basic region in bZIP proteins was shown to specify the target nucleotide sequence ( Suckow et al. 1993 ). Therefore, the complete identity of basic regions between the HY5 protein and the STF1A protein strongly suggests that the HY5 protein likely binds to the same DNA sequences as the STF1A protein. In addition, a region from E-35 to E-49 of the HY5 protein is highly homologous to that of the STF1A protein (Fig. 3 B). This region contains a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by CKII. Because phosphorylation of an Arabidopsis bZIP protein, GBF1, by CKII was shown to stimulate its DNA-binding activity ( Klimczak et al. 1992 ), phosphorylation at the putative CKII phosphorylation sites of the HY5 and STF1A proteins may enhance their DNA-binding activity.

As discussed above, the HY5 protein is likely to have roles as a transcriptional regulatory factor in a wide variety of stimulus responses and developmental processes in the hypocotyl and root. As for the molecular mechanism governing HY5 protein function, studies on photomorphogenesis of young seedlings have provided useful information because molecular genetic data on the HY5 gene and other genes have been accumulated (for review, see Chory 1993 ; Deng 1994 ; McNellis and Deng 1995 ). In the mechanism of hypocotyl elongation of light-grown seedlings, it has been proposed that the HY5 protein works as a positive regulator downstream of photoreceptors in the signaling pathway ( Koornneef et al. 1980 ; Chory 1992 ; Ang and Deng 1994 ). In addition to the HY5 gene, the DET1 and COP1 genes also work downstream of photoreceptors in light-signaling pathways, however, as negative regulators ( Chory et al. 1989b ; Deng et al. 1991 ; Chory 1992 ; Ang and Deng 1994 ). Both DET1 and COP1 proteins have been shown to be localized in the nucleus, and they negatively regulate expression of light-induced genes in dark-grown seedlings ( Pepper et al. 1994 ; von Arnim and Deng 1994 ). Because the HY5 protein is also localized in the nucleus and likely acts as a transcriptional regulatory factor, these three proteins may be associated with a common transcription complex that regulates the expression of light-induced genes. It has been reported that several light-regulated genes contain the ACGT sequence as a light-responsive cis -acting element in their promoters ( Batschauer et al. 1994 ), suggesting that HY5 may bind directly to those promoters. Interestingly, HY5 mRNA was accumulated at a higher level than wild type in roots of both det1 and cop1 mutants. Thus, the amount of the HY5 gene product is likely to be modulated by the DET1 and COP1 genes. Because the det1 and cop1 mutants show excess chloroplast development in their roots—just the reverse effect of the hy5 mutant (Chory and Peto; Deng and Quail 1992 )—the DET1 and COP1 genes may repress chloroplast development in the root of the wild type by repressing the expression of the HY5 gene.

As discussed above, hy5 is a unique mutant because it shows pleiotropic effects on a variety of stimulus responses and on the development of both root and hypocotyl. As a similar mutant with a wide range of phenotypes, the diagiotropica ( dgt ) mutant was isolated from the tomato ( Zobel 1974 ). The dgt mutant shows diageotropism in both shoots and roots and, interestingly, also shows morphological defects, that is, it lacks large secondary xylem vessels in the stem and shows a loss of lateral roots and an open hypocotyl hook. Although not all of the phenotypes of the dgt mutant coincide with those of the hy5 mutant, the resemblance of phenotypes between the two mutants suggests that they affect common signaling pathways in the tomato and in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, the dgt mutant is also known to be insensitive to auxin ( Kelly and Bradford 1986 ). It is known that auxin mediates gravitropism and lateral root formation ( Wilkins 1966 ; Juniper 1976 ; Boerjan et al. 1995 ; Laskowski et al. 1995 ). In addition, auxin is likely to be involved in cambium proliferation and secondary thickening ( Wareing and Phillips 1981 ). As summarized in Table 5 , the HY5 gene is involved not only in the light response but also in gravitropic and touching responses and the process of secondary thickening, in which auxin plays an important role. Therefore, it could be argued that the HY5 protein may be involved in the signaling pathway mediated by auxin and may regulate expression of auxin-induced genes. It has been shown that the promoter of the soybean GH3 gene contains TGACGT elements that confer the auxin inducibility (Liu et at. 1994). Further investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying how the HY5 protein perceives stimulus-induced signals and how the HY5 protein controls the expression of the target genes will unravel the role of the HY5 gene in the development and signaling pathways in plants.
