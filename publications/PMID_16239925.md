The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) coordinates chromosomal and cytoskeletal 
events of mitosis. The enzymatic core of this complex (Aurora-B) is guided 
through the mitotic cell by its companion chromosomal passenger proteins, inner 
centromere protein (INCENP), Survivin and Borealin/Dasra-B, thereby allowing it 
to act at the right place at the right time. Here, we addressed the individual 
contributions of INCENP, Survivin and Borealin to the proper functioning of this 
complex. We show that INCENP has an important role in stabilizing the complex, 
and that Borealin acts to promote binding of Survivin to INCENP. Importantly, 
when Survivin is directly fused to INCENP, this hybrid can restore CPC function 
at the centromeres and midbody, even in the absence of Borealin and the 
centromere-targeting domain of INCENP. Thus, Survivin is an important mediator 
of centromere and midbody docking of Aurora-B during mitosis.
