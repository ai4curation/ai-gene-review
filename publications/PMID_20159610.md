PML/RARalpha is of crucial importance in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) both 
pathologically and therapeutically. Using a genome-wide approach, we identified 
in vivo PML/RARalpha binding sites in a PML/RARalpha-inducible cell model. Of 
the 2979 targeted regions, >62% contained canonical PU.1 motifs and >84% of 
these PU.1 motifs coexisted with one or more RARE half (RAREh) sites in nearby 
regions. Promoters with such PU.1-RAREh binding sites were transactivated by 
PU.1. PU.1-mediated transactivation was repressed by PML/RARalpha and restored 
by the addition of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Genes containing such 
promoters were significantly represented by genes transcriptionally suppressed 
in APL and/or reactivated upon treatment with ATRA. Thus, selective targeting of 
PU.1-regulated genes by PML/RARalpha is a critical mechanism for the 
pathogenesis of APL.
