The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in 
many segments of the mammalian nephron, where it may interact with and modulate 
the activity of a variety of apical membrane proteins, including the renal outer 
medullary potassium (ROMK) K(+) channel. However, the expression of CFTR in 
apical cell membranes or its function as a Cl(-) channel in native renal 
epithelia has not been demonstrated. Here, we establish that CFTR forms protein 
kinase A (PKA)-activated Cl(-) channels in the apical membrane of principal 
cells from the cortical collecting duct obtained from mice. These Cl(-) channels 
were observed in cell-attached apical patches of principal cells after 
stimulation by forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Quiescent Cl(-) channels 
were present in patches excised from untreated tubules because they could be 
activated after exposure to Mg-ATP and the catalytic subunit of PKA. The 
single-channel conductance, kinetics, and anion selectivity of these Cl(-) 
channels were the same as those of recombinant mouse CFTR channels expressed in 
Xenopus laevis oocytes. The CFTR-specific closed-channel blocker CFTR(inh)-172 
abolished apical Cl(-) channel activity in excised patches. Moreover, apical 
Cl(-) channel activity was completely absent in principal cells from transgenic 
mice expressing the DeltaF508 CFTR mutation but was present and unaltered in 
ROMK-null mice. We discuss the physiologic implications of open CFTR Cl(-) 
channels on salt handling by the collecting duct and on the functional CFTR-ROMK 
interactions in modulating the metabolic ATP-sensing of ROMK.
