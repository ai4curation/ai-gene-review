The identification and cDNA cloning of bone-enriched osteonectin and parietal 
endoderm-enriched SPARC indicated that these proteins share greater than 90% 
homology. The present study reports substantial expression of this Mr 43,000 
protein in human decidua and carcinoma. Metabolic labeling of human decidua 
tissue in organ culture demonstrated significant osteonectin biosynthesis. 
Further, Northern analysis and in situ hybridization showed that the osteonectin 
mRNA level in human decidua is very high. Immunohistochemically, the large 
mature decidual cells exhibited faint cytoplasmic immunoreactivity with 
antibodies to osteonectin and a distinct immunoreactivity of the newly deposited 
basement membranes encircling these cells. The intermediate-sized decidual cells 
exhibited a strong cytoplasmic immunostaining with antibodies to osteonectin. 
The small elongated stromal cells were devoid of osteonectin immunoreactivity. 
Blood vessels exhibited variable positive immunoreactivity. The osteonectin 
expression in 38 cases of human carcinomas was examined. In well-differentiated 
carcinomas osteonectin immunoreactivity was located in the basement membrane 
area, codistributing with laminin. Cytoplasmic osteonectin immunoreactivity was 
found in poorly differentiated carcinomas. Stromal cells in the peritumoral 
tissue and some vessels were immunoreactive. Using in situ hybridization, it 
appeared that both the tumor cells and the stromal cells contained osteonectin 
transcripts. In normal steady state human nonosseus tissues investigated, 
osteonectin was found inconsistently in the basement membranes only, as based on 
the present immunohistochemical technique. These results suggest that the 
osteonectin/SPARC gene appears activated in certain human tissues characterized 
by de novo formation of basement membrane.
