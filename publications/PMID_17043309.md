Target of rapamycin (TOR) is an evolutionally conserved protein kinase in 
eukaryotes and a central cell growth controller. TOR exists in two distinct 
complexes, termed TORC1 and TORC2. Mammalian TORC2 has recently been shown to 
possess kinase activity toward the C-terminal hydrophobic site of Akt/PKB. Here, 
we report that Sin1 is an essential component of TORC2 but not of TORC1, and 
functions similarly to Rictor, the defining member of TORC2, in complex 
formation and kinase activity. Knockdown of Sin1decreases Akt phosphorylation in 
both Drosophila and mammalian cells and diminishes Akt function in vivo. It also 
disrupts the interaction between Rictor and mTOR. Furthermore, Sin1 is required 
for TORC2 kinase activity in vitro. Disruption of the Rictor gene in mice 
results in embryonic lethality and ablates Akt phosphorylation. These data 
demonstrate that Sin1 together with Rictor are key components of mTORC2 and play 
an essential role in Akt phosphorylation and signaling.
