In eukaryotic membranes, type IV P-type adenosine triphosphatases (P4-ATPases) 
mediate the translocation of phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet 
and maintain lipid asymmetry, which is critical for membrane trafficking and 
signaling pathways. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of 
six distinct intermediates of the human ATP8A1-CDC50a heterocomplex at 
resolutions of 2.6 to 3.3 angstroms, elucidating the lipid translocation cycle 
of this P4-ATPase. ATP-dependent phosphorylation induces a large rotational 
movement of the actuator domain around the phosphorylation site in the 
phosphorylation domain, accompanied by lateral shifts of the first and second 
transmembrane helices, thereby allowing phosphatidylserine binding. The 
phospholipid head group passes through the hydrophilic cleft, while the acyl 
chain is exposed toward the lipid environment. These findings advance our 
understanding of the flippase mechanism and the disease-associated mutants of 
P4-ATPases.
