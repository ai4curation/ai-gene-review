The interactions of huntingtin (Htt) with the SH3 domain- or WW 
domain-containing proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
Huntington's disease (HD). We report the specific interactions of Htt 
proline-rich region (PRR) with the SH3GL3-SH3 domain and HYPA-WW1-2 domain pair 
by NMR. The results show that Htt PRR binds with the SH3 domain through nearly 
its entire chain, and that the binding region on the domain includes the 
canonical PxxP-binding site and the specificity pocket. The C terminus of PRR 
orients to the specificity pocket, whereas the N terminus orients to the 
PxxP-binding site. Htt PRR can also specifically bind to WW1-2; the N-terminal 
portion preferentially binds to WW1, while the C-terminal portion binds to WW2. 
This study provides structural insights into the specific interactions between 
Htt PRR and its binding partners as well as the alteration of these interactions 
that involve PRR, which may have implications for the understanding of HD.
