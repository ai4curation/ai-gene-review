Unlike broad-host Salmonella serovars, which cause self-limiting disease, 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi can infect only humans causing typhoid fever, 
a life-threatening systemic disease. The molecular bases for these differences 
are presently unknown. Here we show that the GTPase Rab29 (Rab7L1) distinguishes 
the intracellular vacuole of human-adapted and broad-host Salmonella serovars. A 
screen to identify host factors required for the export of typhoid toxin, which 
is exclusively encoded by the human-specific Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi 
(S. Typhi) and Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) identified Rab29. We found that Rab29 is 
recruited to the S. Typhi-containing vacuole but not to vacuoles containing 
broad-host Salmonella. We observed that in cells infected with broad-host 
Salmonella Rab29 is specifically cleaved by the proteolytic activity of GtgE, a 
unique type III secretion effector protein that is absent from S. Typhi. An S. 
Typhi strain engineered to express GtgE and therefore able to cleave Rab29 
exhibited increased intracellular replication in human macrophages. These 
findings indicate significant differences in the intracellular biology of 
human-adapted and broad-host Salmonella and show how subtle differences in the 
assortment of effector proteins encoded by highly related pathogens can have a 
major impact in their biology.
