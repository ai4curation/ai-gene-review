The trithorax gene family contains members implicated in the control of 
transcription, development, chromosome structure, and human leukemia. A feature 
shared by some family members, and by other proteins that function in 
chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation, is the presence of a 130- to 
140-amino acid motif dubbed the SET or Tromo domain. Here we present analysis of 
SET1, a yeast member of the trithorax gene family that was identified by 
sequence inspection to encode a 1080-amino acid protein with a C-terminal SET 
domain. In addition to its SET domain, which is 40-50% identical to those 
previously characterized, SET1 also shares dispersed but significant similarity 
to Drosophila and human trithorax homologues. To understand SET1 function(s), we 
created a null mutant. Mutant strains, although viable, are defective in 
transcriptional silencing of the silent mating-type loci and telomeres. The 
telomeric silencing defect is rescued not only by full-length episomal SET1 but 
also by the conserved SET domain of SET1. set1 mutant strains display other 
phenotypes including morphological abnormalities, stationary phase defects, and 
growth and sporulation defects. Candidate genes that may interact with SET1 
include those with functions in transcription, growth, and cell cycle control. 
These data suggest that yeast SET1, like its SET domain counterparts in other 
organisms, functions in diverse biological processes including transcription and 
chromatin structure.
