Notch pathway signaling is implicated in several human cancers. Aberrant 
activation and mutations of Notch signaling components are linked to tumor 
initiation, maintenance, and resistance to cancer therapy. Several strategies, 
such as monoclonal antibodies against Notch ligands and receptors, as well as 
small-molecule γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), have been developed to interfere 
with Notch receptor activation at proximal points in the pathway. However, the 
use of drug-like small molecules to target the downstream mediators of Notch 
signaling, the Notch transcription activation complex, remains largely 
unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of an orally active small-molecule 
inhibitor (termed CB-103) of the Notch transcription activation complex. We show 
that CB-103 inhibits Notch signaling in primary human T cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia and other Notch-dependent human tumor cell lines, and concomitantly 
induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, thereby impairing proliferation, 
including in GSI-resistant human tumor cell lines with chromosomal 
translocations and rearrangements in Notch genes. CB-103 produces Notch 
loss-of-function phenotypes in flies and mice and inhibits the growth of human 
breast cancer and leukemia xenografts, notably without causing the dose-limiting 
intestinal toxicity associated with other Notch inhibitors. Thus, we describe a 
pharmacological strategy that interferes with Notch signaling by disrupting the 
Notch transcription complex and shows therapeutic potential for treating 
Notch-driven cancers.
