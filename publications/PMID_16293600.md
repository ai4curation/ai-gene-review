Filamin A (FLNa), a dimeric actin cross-linking and scaffold protein with 
numerous intracellular binding partners, anchors the platelet adhesion 
glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V receptor to actin cytoskeleton. We mapped the 
GPIbalpha binding site to a single domain of FLNa and resolved the structure of 
this domain and its interaction complex with the corresponding GPIbalpha 
cytoplasmic domain. This is the first atomic structure of this class of membrane 
glycoprotein-cytoskeleton connection. GPIbalpha binds in a groove formed between 
the C and D beta strands of FLNa domain 17. The interaction is strikingly 
similar to that between the beta7 integrin tail and a different FLNa domain, 
potentially defining a conserved motif for FLNa binding. Nevertheless, the 
structures also reveal specificity of the interfaces, which explains different 
regulatory mechanisms. To verify the topology of GPIb-FLNa interaction we also 
purified the native complex from platelets and showed that GPIb interacts with 
the C-terminus of FLNa, which is in accordance with our biochemical and 
structural data.
