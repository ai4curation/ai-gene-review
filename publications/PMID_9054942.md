Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most commonly inherited 
neurological disorders in humans, affecting approximately one in 4,000 
individuals. NF1 results in a complex cluster of developmental and tumour 
syndromes that include benign neurofibromas, hyperpigmentation of melanocytes 
and hamartomas of the iris. Some NF1 patients may also show neurologic lesions, 
such as optic pathway gliomas, dural ectasia and aqueduct stenosis. Importantly, 
learning disabilities occur in 30% to 45% of patients with NF1, even in the 
absence of any apparent neural pathology. The learning disabilities may include 
a depression in mean IQ scores, visuoperceptual problems and impairments in 
spatial cognitive abilities. Spatial learning has been assessed with a variety 
of cognitive tasks and the most consistent spatial learning deficits have been 
observed with the Judgement of Line Orientation test. It is important to note 
that some of these deficits could be secondary to developmental abnormalities 
and other neurological problems, such as poor motor coordination and attentional 
deficits. Previous studies have suggested a role for neurofibromin in brain 
function. First, the expression of the Nf1 gene is largely restricted to 
neuronal tissues in the adult. Second, this GTPase activating protein may act as 
a negative regulator of neurotrophin-mediated signalling. Third, 
immunohistochemical studies suggest that activation of astrocytes may be common 
in the brain of NF1 patients. Here, we show that the Nf1+/- mutation also 
affects learning and memory in mice. As in humans, the learning and memory 
deficits of the Nf1+/- mice are restricted to specific types of learning, they 
are not fully penetrant, they can be compensated for with extended training, and 
they do not involve deficits in simple associative learning.
