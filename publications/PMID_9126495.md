Rab GTPases reside in specific intracellular compartments and are key regulators 
of vesicular transport. To facilitate studies of the mechanism of lysosomal 
integral membrane protein (LAMP-1) transport, cDNAs for human Rab7 and Rab9 were 
isolated, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. During isolation and 
characterization of these cDNAs a Rab9 pseudogene was identified. The sequences 
are highly homologous to other mammalian Rab proteins and also share homology 
with proteins of the Rab GTPase family. Rab7 and the Rab9 pseudogene were mapped 
to chromosomes 3 and 5, respectively, by amplification of their sequences from 
human monochromosomal somatic cell hybrids. In addition, preliminary studies 
using antisense expression indicate that down-regulation of either Rab7 or Rab9 
proteins induces severe cell vacuolation that resembles the phenotype seen in 
fibroblasts from patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
