The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
5 (ERK5) plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, regulating gene 
transcription. ERK5 has a unique C-terminal tail which contains a 
transcriptional activation domain, and activates transcription by 
phosphorylating transcription factors and acting itself as a transcriptional 
coactivator. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its 
nucleocytoplasmatic traffic are unknown. We have used tandem affinity 
purification to identify proteins that interact with ERK5. We show that ERK5 
interacts with the Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone in resting cells, and that inhibition 
of Hsp90 or Cdc37 results in ERK5 ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. 
Interestingly, activation of cellular ERK5 induces Hsp90 dissociation from the 
ERK5-Cdc37 complex, leading to ERK5 nuclear translocation and activation of 
transcription, by a mechanism which requires the autophosphorylation at its 
C-terminal tail. Consequently, active ERK5 is no longer sensitive to Hsp90 or 
Cdc37 inhibitors. Cdc37 overexpression also induces Hsp90 dissociation and the 
nuclear translocation of a kinase-inactive form of ERK5 which retains 
transcriptional activity. This is the first example showing that ERK5 
transcriptional activity does not require kinase activity. Since Cdc37 
cooperates with ERK5 to promote cell proliferation, Cdc37 overexpression (as 
happens in some cancers) might represent a new, noncanonical mechanism by which 
ERK5 regulates tumor proliferation.

INTRODUCTION

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of protein serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases that transduce a wide range of extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses, and are activated in response to growth factors and different forms of stress. Phosphorylating a broad range of substrates, MAPKs regulate many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and apoptosis ( 1 , 2 ). In mammals, four subfamilies of conventional MAPKs have been characterized: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), p38, and ERK5 ( 3 ).

ERK5 is activated in response to a wide range of growth factors and oxidative and hyperosmotic stresses ( 4 , 5 ). ERK5 phosphorylates several transcription factors, including the members of the myocyte enhancer factor family, MEF2A, -C, and -D ( 4 – 6 ), and is required for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell proliferation and progression through the cell cycle ( 7 ).

ERK5 and its upstream activator, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MEK5), were independently cloned by different groups ( 8 , 9 ). MEK5 activates ERK5 by dual phosphorylation of the Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) motif within the activation loop, and three findings indicate that MEK5 is the only kinase that activates ERK5: (i) MEK5 and ERK5 specifically interact with each other but not with other MAPKs ( 9 ); (ii) targeted deletion of the ERK5 and MEK5 genes renders identical phenotypes, with mice dying around embryonic day 10.5, due to angiogenic failure and cardiovascular defects ( 10 – 13 ); and (iii) in MEK5 −/− MEF cells, EGF and stress fail to activate ERK5 but not other MAPKs ( 13 ).

ERK5 is twice the size of the other mammalian MAPKs (816 amino acids [aa] for human ERK5). ERK5 has a kinase domain located in the N-terminal half of the protein, homologous to the ERK2 kinase domain. In contrast with other MAPKs, ERK5 has a unique C-terminal tail that contains a transcriptional activation domain (residues 664 to 789 of the human protein [ 14 ]). Thus, ERK5 is able to activate transcription not only by direct phosphorylation of transcription factors but by acting itself as a transcriptional coactivator, as, for example, in the case for the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor ( 15 ). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate nuclear-cytoplasmatic localization of ERK5 are unknown, and different cellular localizations, depending on the cell type studied, have been previously reported ( 16 ).

Members of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) family are essential molecular chaperones expressed in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, where they regulate the folding and the maturation of a wide array of proteins, comprising kinases, transcription factors, and steroid hormone receptors ( 17 , 18 ). Hsp90 family members contain an ATP-binding site, required for the folding and release of the client proteins. Hsp90 inhibitors block the interaction with ATP, inducing the release of client proteins and its subsequent unfolding and degradation by the proteasome ( 19 ). Since many Hsp90 clients (such as Akt, Raf, ERBB2, and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) are proteins which are mutated or deregulated in cancer, Hsp90 inhibitors exhibit anticancer activity. Among them, geldanamycin derivatives such as 17-AGG are in clinical trials for the treatment of a wide variety of cancers ( 20 ).

The cochaperone cell division-cycle 37 (Cdc37) promotes the association of Hsp90 with a protein kinase subset of client proteins ( 21 ); therefore, some kinases require Hsp90 and Cdc37 chaperones for maintaining their stability. Via its N-terminal domain, Cdc37 first interacts with the catalytic domain of the kinase client, and then its C-terminal domain recruits Hsp90, generating a Cdc37-kinase-Hsp90 ternary complex ( 22 ). The superchaperone Hsp90-Cdc37 keeps the client protein kinases either active or in a conformation competent for activation ( 23 ). Interestingly, Cdc37 acts as an oncogene by stabilizing other oncogenes which are mutated or overexpressed in cancer cells, and inhibition of the Cdc37 function with compounds such as celastrol represents a new therapy for cancer treatment ( 24 , 25 ). This compound, by inhibiting the Cdc37-Hsp90 interaction, destabilizes kinase clients and sensitizes tumors to Hsp90 inhibitors ( 26 ).

In this report, we provide for the first time biochemical and pharmacological data showing that ERK5 interacts with the superchaperone Hsp90-Cdc37. We also show that the Cdc37-ERK5-Hsp90 complex resides in the cytosol of resting cells and that ERK5 activation results in Hsp90 dissociation and nuclear translocation of the kinase. Unexpectedly, we found that overexpression of Cdc37, an event occurring in several types of cancers, induces nuclear translocation of a catalytically inactive but transcriptionally active form of ERK5.

DISCUSSION

We used tandem affinity purification to identify ERK5-interacting proteins. This methodology identified the chaperone protein Hsp90β as the major protein associated with ERK5 ( Fig. 1 ). Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that endogenous Hsp90 and ERK5 proteins interact. Cdc37, the canonical Hsp90 cochaperone for many kinase clients, also interacted with ERK5, resulting in an Hsp90-Cdc37-ERK5 trimeric complex in cells ( Fig. 2 ). Our analysis also identified other ERK5-interacting proteins, whose physiological relevance is being currently investigated.

The importance of the interaction of Hsp90 with ERK5 was established by the fact that two structurally unrelated Hsp90 inhibitors (geldanamycin and radicicol) promoted ERK5 degradation. Although Truman et al. observed that yeast Hsp90 binds human ERK5 ( 46 ), other authors excluded ERK5 as a client of mammalian Hsp90 since the expression of this kinase was not affected by treatment of COS7 cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG ( 47 ). This was probably due to the use of a relatively low dose (1 μM) of inhibitor, since we noticed that ERK5 expression is not affected by low concentrations of Hsp90 inhibitors that alter other Hsp90 clients. For instance, 1 μM geldanamycin induces degradation of LKB1 ( 48 ), JAK1/JAK2 ( 49 ), CHK1 ( 50 ), or IRAK-1 ( 51 ) kinases after 4 h of treatment, a concentration that has almost no effect on ERK5 after 18 h. The use of 5 μM geldanamycin was necessary to induce complete degradation of ERK5 ( Fig. 3A ). This is not surprising, since closely related kinases show differential levels of sensitivity to geldanamycin, as is the case for the receptor tyrosine kinases ErbB1 and ErbB2. Both proteins require Hsp90 for proper folding, but only ErbB2 binds Hsp90 in the mature state, making ErbB2 more sensitive to geldanamycin ( 52 ). We also show the requirement of Cdc37 for ERK5 stability. Treatment of cells with the cdc37 inhibitor celastrol or silencing the Cdc37 protein results in loss of ERK5 expression ( Fig. 3B and 5B ). Celastrol inhibits Cdc37-Hsp90 interaction, preventing the recruitment of Hsp90 to the kinase domain of the client protein ( 22 ), therefore resulting in the proteasomal degradation of this protein ( 26 ).

ERK5 comprises two well-differentiated regions; the N-terminal region contains the kinase domain, and the C-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal and a transcriptional transactivation domain. We show that Hsp90 and Cdc37 bind the N-terminal region but not the C-terminal tail ( Fig. 2D and E ). The fact that the N-terminal half is ubiquitylated in the absence of proteasomal inhibitor ( Fig. 3E ) suggests that this half becomes unstable in the absence of the C-terminal region.

Our most striking finding is the observation that activation of ERK5 (in response to either EGF stimulation or active MEK5 overexpression) results in Hsp90 dissociation from the ERK5-Cdc37 complex ( Fig. 4A and B ). According to this, active ERK5 is not sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors ( Fig. 5A ). These results suggest that ERK5 is an unstable kinase in its inactive form and that binding to Hsp90 stabilizes it, whereas its activation results in a stable protein that does not require Hsp90 stabilization. Although unusual, a transient interaction of Hsp90 with certain kinase clients, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4, has been reported. Inactive CDK4 binds Hsp90 and Cdc37, and binding of cyclin D induces the release of the Hsp90-Cdc37 superchaperone and CDK4 activation ( 53 ). In this case, Hsp90-Cdc37 promotes stabilization until cyclin D takes over this activity by interacting with (and displacing Hsp90-Cdc37 from) the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. For other kinases, only the mutated forms show Hsp90 dependency. For instance, wild-type B-Raf does not bind Hsp90 but the mutant active form most commonly found in cancer B-Raf V600E shows a strong Hsp90 dependence for its stability ( 30 ). The substitution of Val600 for Glu within the T-loop provokes a conformational change of the N-terminal lobe, exposing the chaperone binding site.

Here we show that a kinase-dead mutant of ERK5 (D200A) remains associated with Hsp90 even after being phosphorylated at the TEY motif by MEK5 ( Fig. 4B ). Thus, ERK5 kinase activity is necessary for the dissociation of Hsp90 but not the phosphorylation of its TEY motif. On the other hand, a functional form of ERK5(1–490) that lacks the C-terminal region remains associated with Hsp90 after MEK5 phosphorylation ( Fig. 4C ). Finally, an ERK5 mutant in which 5 autophosphorylatable residues are mutated to Glu does not bind Hsp90 under basal conditions ( Fig. 4D ). Taken together, these results indicate that autophosphorylation of the C-terminal region induces the release of Hsp90 from the ERK5-Cdc37 complex. The ERK5 C-terminal tail might work in a manner analogous to that of cyclin D for CDK4: upon ERK5 activation, autophosphorylation of its C-terminal region results in a conformational change of this tail that induces the release of Hsp90 and takes over its chaperone function in the stabilization of the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. However, and unlike what happens for CDK4, Cdc37 remains bound to active ERK5.

Unexpectedly, expression of high levels of Cdc37 in cells induced the release of Hsp90 from the ERK5-Cdc37 complex ( Fig. 6A ), by a mechanism that does not involve enzyme activation and C-terminal autophosphorylation ( Fig. 7 ). Thus, Cdc37 mimics ERK5 C-terminal autophosphorylation, probably inducing a conformational change that results in the release of Hsp90. This was an unexpected result, since it is accepted that Cdc37 promotes the association of Hsp90 with client proteins ( 21 , 22 ). One possibility might be that high levels of expression of Cdc37 result in the binding of a second molecule to the ERK5 protein, displacing the Hsp90 by an unknown, noncanonical mechanism. Interestingly, Fig. 6A shows that larger amounts of Cdc37 bound to ERK5 in those cells that overexpress higher levels of Cdc37. We are currently investigating the mechanism by which Cdc37 displaces Hsp90 from the trimeric complex.

We show that MEK5 activation or overexpression of Cdc37 results in three common events: (i) Hsp90 dissociation from the ERK5-Cdc37 complex; (ii) ERK5 nuclear translocation; and (iii) an increase of ERK5-mediated AP-1 transcriptional activity. Several studies have addressed the issue of subcellular location of ERK5. ERK5 resides in the cytosol of HeLa cells and migrates to the nuclei after activation in response to EGF ( 35 , 54 ) or active MEK5 overexpression ( 55 ). However, other studies stated that the cellular location of ERK5 depends on the cell type and can even be nuclear in unstimulated cells ( 16 , 56 ). Kondoh et al. proposed an accepted mechanism for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of ERK5 ( 35 ). The C-terminal region contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and ERK5 itself has nuclear export (NES) activity, so subcellular localization of ERK5 depends on the balance between nuclear export and import: the N-terminal and C-terminal halves bind each other, and this binding is necessary for cytoplasmatic localization. Thus, in resting cells, the two halves would interact, forming either a putative NES or a domain that binds a cytoplasmatic anchor protein. After activation, ERK5 autophosphorylates its C-terminal half, an event that would disrupt the intramolecular interaction between the C-terminal and N-terminal regions, resulting in the loss of the NES activity, exposition of the NLS, and nuclear translocation. Supporting the idea of a role of C-terminal phosphorylation in ERK5 nuclear localization, an ERK5 that is catalytically inactive (but phosphorylated at its C terminus) that resides in the nucleus during mitosis has been previously reported ( 36 , 57 ).

Our results suggest that Hsp90 might be the proposed cytosolic anchor, since dissociation of Hsp90 is the common event implicated in two different mechanisms that induce ERK5 nuclear translocation, i.e., MEK5 activation and Cdc37 overexpression ( Fig. 9 ). Thus, Hsp90 might act as it does for steroid receptors. In the absence of the hormone, steroid receptors reside in the cytosol complexed with Hsp90 and this interaction maintains the receptor in a state capable of binding the hormone. Binding the steroid leads to dissociation of Hsp90 and receptor nuclear translocation ( 58 ). In an analogous way, the Hsp90-ERK5 complex resides in the cytosol and ERK5 activation induces Hsp90 dissociation and nuclear translocation of the kinase, configuring a kinase activity-dependent shuttling ( Fig. 9 ). In this paradigm, it is likely that Hsp90 would keep cytosolic/basal ERK5 properly folded for MEK5 recognition and activation.

We propose that Cdc37 overexpression represents an alternative, noncanonical mechanism of ERK5 nuclear translocation. Unlike the results seen with MEK5, overexpression of Cdc37 does not result in activation of ERK5 ( Fig. 7C ) or in a shift of its electrophoretic mobility, and it induces the nuclear translocation of a catalytically inactive form of ERK5 that retains its transcriptional activity ( Fig. 9 ). This finding is strongly supported by the genetic and pharmacological data ( Fig. 7 ): (i) Cdc37 overexpression induces ERK5 nuclear translocation in MEF MEK5 −/− cells, (ii) ERK5 inhibitor XMD2-98 blocks ERK5 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity induced by active MEK5 but not by Cdc37 overexpression, and (iii) overexpression of Cdc37 induces transcriptional activity of two ERK5 mutants unable to autophosphorylate, D200A and ERK5(5A). Interestingly, Cdc37 overexpression also increases nuclear translocation of other proteins, such as the intracellular domain of the tyrosine kinase receptor Ryk, after being cleaved by γ-secretase ( 59 ). How Cdc37 overexpression induces the release of Hsp90 remains to be studied, but it could be the consequence of Cdc37 either directly displacing Hsp90 or inducing a conformational change in ERK5 that results in Hsp90 dissociation. It is important to study if the different ERK5 cytosolic/nuclear localizations observed in several cell lines are, in fact, the consequence of a different Cdc37 expression level.

Cdc37 acts as an oncogene, stabilizing other oncogenes that are mutated or overexpressed in cancer cells ( 25 ); it is overexpressed in a number of cancers ( 60 ), and silencing Cdc37 reduces cell growth and invasive capability ( 24 , 61 ). On the other hand, MEK5 and ERK5 represent a key pathway associated with some cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer. Tumors showing a strong nuclear ERK5 localization have a poor specific disease factor ( 42 , 43 , 54 , 62 ), and silencing ERK5 or Cdc37 expression induces growth arrest and inhibits the invasive capability of cancer cells ( 44 ). In accordance with the results described above, we show that, in prostate cancer cells, Cdc37 cooperates with ERK5 to promote cell proliferation, as it does proliferation of active MEK5 ( Fig. 8 ). It is important to establish if ERK5 and Cdc37 also cooperate to regulate the progression and invasiveness of cancer. If so, our observation that active ERK5 is no longer sensitive to Hsp90 or Cdc37 inhibitors supports the idea that the ERK5-Cdc37 interaction might represent a new target for therapeutic intervention in some cancers.
