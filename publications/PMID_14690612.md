The highly conserved Tor kinases (TOR) and the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway 
regulate cell proliferation in response to growth factors and/or nutrients. In 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of either TOR or PKA causes cells to arrest 
growth early in G(1) and to enter G(0) by mechanisms that are poorly understood. 
Here we demonstrate that the protein kinase Rim15 is required for entry into 
G(0) following inactivation of TOR and/or PKA. Induction of Rim15-dependent G(0) 
traits requires two discrete processes, i.e., nuclear accumulation of Rim15, 
which is negatively regulated both by a Sit4-independent TOR effector branch and 
the protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) homolog Sch9, and release from PKA-mediated 
inhibition of its protein kinase activity. Thus, Rim15 integrates signals from 
at least three nutrient-sensory kinases (TOR, PKA, and Sch9) to properly control 
entry into G(0), a key developmental process in eukaryotic cells.
