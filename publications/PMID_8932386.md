Drosophila ribosomal protein PO was overexpressed in Escherichia coli to allow 
for its purification, biochemical characterization and to generate polyclonal 
antibodies for Western analysis. Biochemical tests were originally performed to 
see if overexpressed PO contained DNase activity similar to that recently 
reported for the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity associated with 
Drosophila ribosomal protein S3. The overexpressed ribosomal protein was 
subsequently found to act on AP DNA, producing scissions that were in this case 
5' of a baseless site instead of 3', as has been observed for S3. As a means of 
confirming that the source of AP endonuclease activity was in fact due to PO, 
glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions containing a Factor Xa cleavage site 
between GST and PO were constructed, overexpressed in an E.coli strain defective 
for the major 5'-acting AP endonucleases and the fusions purified using 
glutathione-agarose affinity column chromatography. Isolated fractions 
containing purified GST-PO fusion proteins were subsequently found to have 
authentic AP endonuclease activity. Moreover, glutathione-agarose was able to 
deplete AP endonuclease activity from GST-PO fusion protein preparations, 
whereas the resin was ineffective in lowering DNA repair activity for PO that 
had been liberated from the fusion construct by Factor Xa cleavage. These 
results suggested that PO was a multifunctional protein with possible roles in 
DNA repair beyond its known participation in protein translation. In support of 
this notion, tests were performed that show that GST-PO, but not GST, was able 
to rescue an E.coli mutant lacking the major 5'-acting AP endonucleases from 
sensitivity to an alkylating agent. We furthermore show that GST-PO can be 
located in both the nucleus and ribosomes. Its nuclear location can be further 
traced to the nuclear matrix, thus placing PO in a subcellular location where it 
could act as a DNA repair protein. Other roles beyond DNA repair seem possible, 
however, since GST-PO also exhibited significant nuclease activity for both 
single- and double-stranded DNA.
