Mental retardation (MR) and autism are highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental 
disorders. IL-1-receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1) is responsible for 
nonsyndromic MR and is associated with autism. Thus, the elucidation of the 
functional role of IL1RAPL1 will contribute to our understanding of the 
pathogenesis of these mental disorders. Here, we showed that knockdown of 
endogenous IL1RAPL1 in cultured cortical neurons suppressed the accumulation of 
punctate staining signals for active zone protein Bassoon and decreased the 
number of dendritic protrusions. Consistently, the expression of IL1RAPL1 in 
cultured neurons stimulated the accumulation of Bassoon and spinogenesis. The 
extracellular domain (ECD) of IL1RAPL1 was required and sufficient for the 
presynaptic differentiation-inducing activity, while both the ECD and 
cytoplasmic domain were essential for the spinogenic activity. Notably, the 
synaptogenic activity of IL1RAPL1 was specific for excitatory synapses. 
Furthermore, we identified presynaptic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) δ as a 
major IL1RAPL1-ECD interacting protein by affinity chromatography. IL1RAPL1 
interacted selectively with certain forms of PTPδ splice variants carrying 
mini-exon peptides in Ig-like domains. The synaptogenic activity of IL1RAPL1 was 
abolished in primary neurons from PTPδ knock-out mice. IL1RAPL1 showed robust 
synaptogenic activity in vivo when transfected into the cortical neurons of 
wild-type mice but not in PTPδ knock-out mice. These results suggest that 
IL1RAPL1 mediates synapse formation through trans-synaptic interaction with 
PTPδ. Our findings raise an intriguing possibility that the impairment of 
synapse formation may underlie certain forms of MR and autism as a common 
pathogenic pathway shared by these mental disorders.
