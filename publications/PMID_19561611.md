Hedgehog (Hh) morphogens have fundamental roles in development, whereas 
dysregulation of Hh signaling leads to disease. Multiple cell-surface receptors 
are responsible for transducing and/or regulating Hh signals. Among these, the 
Hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip) is a highly conserved, vertebrate-specific 
inhibitor of Hh signaling. We have solved a series of crystal structures for the 
human HHIP ectodomain and Desert hedgehog (DHH) in isolation, as well as HHIP in 
complex with DHH (HHIP-DHH) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (HHIP-Shh), with and 
without Ca2+. The interaction determinants, confirmed by biophysical studies and 
mutagenesis, reveal previously uncharacterized and distinct functions for the Hh 
Zn2+ and Ca2+ binding sites--functions that may be common to all vertebrate Hh 
proteins. Zn2+ makes a key contribution to the Hh-HHIP interface, whereas Ca2+ 
is likely to prevent electrostatic repulsion between the two proteins, 
suggesting an important modulatory role. This interplay of several metal binding 
sites suggests a tuneable mechanism for regulation of Hh signaling.
