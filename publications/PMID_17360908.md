Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by decreased synapse density in 
hippocampus and neocortex, and synapse loss is the strongest anatomical 
correlate of the degree of clinical impairment. Although considerable evidence 
supports a causal role for the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in AD, a direct link 
between a specific form of Abeta and synapse loss has not been established. We 
demonstrate that physiological concentrations of naturally secreted Abeta dimers 
and trimers, but not monomers, induce progressive loss of hippocampal synapses. 
Pyramidal neurons in rat organotypic slices had markedly decreased density of 
dendritic spines and numbers of electrophysiologically active synapses after 
exposure to picomolar levels of soluble oligomers. Spine loss was reversible and 
was prevented by Abeta-specific antibodies or a small-molecule modulator of 
Abeta aggregation. Mechanistically, Abeta-mediated spine loss required activity 
of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) and occurred through a pathway 
involving cofilin and calcineurin. Furthermore, NMDAR-mediated calcium influx 
into active spines was reduced by Abeta oligomers. Partial blockade of NMDARs by 
pharmacological antagonists was sufficient to trigger spine loss. We conclude 
that soluble, low-n oligomers of human Abeta trigger synapse loss that can be 
reversed by therapeutic agents. Our approach provides a quantitative cellular 
model for elucidating the molecular basis of Abeta-induced neuronal dysfunction.
