We developed a quantitative assay for Caenorhabditis elegans avoidance behavior. 
This was then used to demonstrate that the worm moved away from toxic 
concentrations of Cd2+ and Cu2+, but not Ni2+, all ions that prevented 
development from larval to adult stages. Mutants that have structural defects in 
ciliated neurons (che-2 and osm-3) as well as worms with three laser-operated 
neurons (ADL, ASE, and ASH), showed no avoidance behavior from Cd2+ and Cu2+. 
These results suggest that the avoidance from Cd2+ and Cu2+ are mediated through 
multiple neural pathways including ADL, ASE, and ASH neurons. We hypothesize 
that the three sensing neurons provide increased accuracy of the sensory 
response and a survival advantage in the natural environment of the worm.
