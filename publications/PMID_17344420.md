Ecsit is a cytosolic adaptor protein essential for inflammatory response and 
embryonic development via the Toll-like and BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) 
signal transduction pathways, respectively. Here, we demonstrate a mitochondrial 
function for Ecsit (an evolutionary conserved signaling intermediate in Toll 
pathways) in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone 
oxidoreductase). An N-terminal targeting signal directs Ecsit to mitochondria, 
where it interacts with assembly chaperone NDUFAF1 in 500- to 850-kDa complexes 
as demonstrated by affinity purification and vice versa RNA interference (RNAi) 
knockdowns. In addition, Ecsit knockdown results in severely impaired complex I 
assembly and disturbed mitochondrial function. These findings support a function 
for Ecsit in the assembly or stability of mitochondrial complex I, possibly 
linking assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes to inflammatory response 
and embryonic development.

Abstract

Ecsit is a cytosolic adaptor protein essential for inflammatory response and embryonic development via the Toll-like and BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signal transduction pathways, respectively. Here, we demonstrate a mitochondrial function for Ecsit (an evolutionary conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways) in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). An N-terminal targeting signal directs Ecsit to mitochondria, where it interacts with assembly chaperone NDUFAF1 in 500- to 850-kDa complexes as demonstrated by affinity purification and vice versa RNA interference (RNAi) knockdowns. In addition, Ecsit knockdown results in severely impaired complex I assembly and disturbed mitochondrial function. These findings support a function for Ecsit in the assembly or stability of mitochondrial complex I, possibly linking assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes to inflammatory response and embryonic development.

Ecsit knockdown in HeLa mitochondria results in NDUFAF1 decrease and impaired complex I assembly

The mitochondrial association with assembly chaperone NDUFAF1 allows the possibility that Ecsit is involved in the assembly of OXPHOS complexes. To address this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of Ecsit knockdown on OXPHOS complex assembly using two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against Ecsit mRNA directed against exon 4 (target #1) and against exon 7 (target #2). The effects of knockdown were analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis ( Fig. 4A ). Ecsit RNAi effectively knocks down the 45-kDa Ecsit signal, and has substantially reduced the amount of mitochondrial NDUFAF1 ( Fig. 4A ). Apparently, Ecsit is required for stable presence of NDUFAF1 within the mitochondrion. To analyze the effects of Ecsit knockdown on OXPHOS assembly we performed one-dimensional blue-native PAGE analysis ( Fig. 4B ). Complex I is severely reduced upon Ecsit knockdown, whereas the amounts of the other OXPHOS complexes appear relatively unchanged. Furthermore, immunodetection for complex I subunit NDUFS3 reveals the accumulation of intermediates of ∼500 kDa in size. To further investigate the nature of these complexes, we performed two-dimensional SDS PAGE analysis ( Fig. 4C ). As shown using antibodies against complex I subunits NDUFS3 and ND1, RNAi results in accumulation of intermediates smaller than complex I, indicative of disturbed assembly or stability of the holo-complex ( Fig. 4C , “sub”). Furthermore, Ecsit knockdown results in a strong decrease in the NDUFAF1 subcomplexes of 500–850 kDa, strongly suggesting that the stability of these complexes relies on the presence of Ecsit and NDUFAF1 in these subcomplexes.

Ecsit knockdown in HeLa mitochondria results in disturbed mitochondrial function

The impaired assembly or stability of complex I upon Ecsit knockdown may have serious consequences for mitochondrial function. For example, complex I deficiency is known to result in a broad spectrum of mitochondrial disorders ( Janssen et al. 2006 ), increases cellular superoxide levels ( Koopman et al. 2005a ), and affects mitochondrial morphology ( Koopman et al. 2005b ). To investigate the effects of Ecsit knockdown on mitochondrial physiology and morphology we investigated several parameters. As demonstrated by complex I in-gel activity assay, complex I activity drops to 50%–60% of the control value ( Fig. 5A ). Mitochondrial NAD(P)H levels were significantly increased in the siRNA-treated cells compared with untreated and mock-treated controls ( Fig. 5B ), suggesting that NADH oxidation by complex I is decreased. Downstream effects of complex I dysfunction were assayed by measuring superoxide and cytosolic oxidant levels ( Koopman et al. 2005a , 2006b ) and by determining the degree of mitochondrial branching ( F ) and number per cell ( Nc ) ( Fig. 5C,D ; Koopman et al. 2005a , b , 2006a ). This analysis indicated that the level of cellular radical species was increased up to 150%–200% of control values ( Fig. 5C ). Although the number of mitochondria per cell was not affected by siRNA treatment, mitochondrial branching was reduced ( Fig. 5D ). Taken together, these data support the notion that Ecsit is required for normal mitochondrial functioning and morphology.

Discussion

In previous studies, Ecsit has been described as a cytosolic signaling protein essential for the Toll pathway of innate immunity and the BMP pathway of embryonic development ( Kopp et al. 1999 ; Xiao et al. 2003 ). In this study, we show N-terminal targeting of Ecsit to mitochondria, where it interacts with mitochondrial complex I-specific assembly chaperone NDUFAF1 in three high-molecular-weight protein complexes of 500–850 kDa. Ecsit is required for correct complex I assembly or stability in particular, and mitochondrial function in general, and may thus represent a link between mitochondrial function, immune response and embryonic development.

Cytosolic Ecsit associates with TRAF6 and MEKK-1, and is described to facilitate the processing of MEKK-1 ( Kopp et al. 1999 ). MEKK-1, in turn, is able to activate two different pathways leading to transcriptional activation of inflammatory genes ( Moustakas and Heldin 2003 ). It now seems that, while Ecsit may facilitate the processing of another protein such as MEKK-1, Ecsit itself can be processed in the mitochondrion at its N terminus, after which it associates with mitochondrial complexes including complex I assembly chaperone NDUFAF1.

It is yet unclear under which factors determine whether Ecsit is targeted to either the mitochondrion or the cytosol. Whichever the underlying mechanism, we show, at least in HEK293 cells, that only a fraction of the total Ecsit amount is recruited to mitochondria, and that this targeting depends on an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. In addition, we show that addition of a C terminal GFP tag alters the Ecsit distribution from mainly cytoplasmic to predominantly mitochondrial. This shift in localization is most likely not caused by the overexpression itself, as the (low level) leakage expression of Ecsit-GFP in the uninduced cells is also targeted to the mitochondrion.

Even though, compared with its cytosolic counterpart, only a fraction of the Ecsit pool is present in mitochondria, Ecsit knockdown results in severely depressed NDUFAF1 amounts, demonstrating its requirement for stable mitochondrial presence of a complex I-specific chaperone. Furthermore, Ecsit knockdown results in specifically disturbed complex I assembly or stability and subsequently impaired mitochondrial function. Similar to the complex I-deficient patient and rotenone-treated control cells, NAD(P)H, superoxide ( Koopman et al. 2005a ), and cytosolic oxidant levels ( Koopman et al. 2006b ) are increased in Ecsit knockdown cells.

Conversely, NDUFAF1 knockdown is known to result in impaired complex I assembly ( Vogel et al. 2005 ), but only results in a minor decrease in the amount of Ecsit in the 500-kDa subcomplex (data not shown). In contrast to Ecsit knockdown, no accumulation of complex I intermediates can be observed after NDUFAF1 knockdown (R.O. Vogel and R.J.R.J. Janssen, unpubl.), which indicates that although both proteins are present in the 500- to 850-kDa complexes their mechanism of action may be different. Elucidation of the exact composition of these intermediates may clarify the specific significance of the presence of Ecsit in these complexes for complex I assembly or stability.

In conclusion, as Ecsit is required for stabilization of complex I assembly chaperone NDUFAF1 and its absence results in impaired complex I assembly, accumulation of intermediates, and mitochondrial dysfunction, it seems that Ecsit is involved in additional processes apart from its functions in immune response and embryonic development. This putative link between mitochondria and the immune response has recently gained much attention with the discovery of MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) ( Seth et al. 2005 ; McWhirter et al. 2005 ). This protein is associated to the mitochondrial outer membrane via a hydrophobic C terminus and acts as a signaling molecule in the immune response via association to TRAF6, similar to what has been described for the Ecsit protein. As Ecsit is now also found inside the mitochondrion, Ecsit may extend the influence of this cascade to the inner-mitochondrial level. Possibly, Ecsit modulates the energetic requirements upon inflammatory response by regulating the rate of complex I synthesis. Alternatively, Ecsit may induce other mitochondrial processes, such as apoptosis, upon microbial or viral infection. Future research will have to verify which of these possibilities is reality.
