Mdm2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes its own ubiquitination and also 
ubiquitination of the p53 tumour suppressor. In a bacterial two-hybrid screen, 
using Mdm2 as bait, we identified an Mdm2-interacting peptide that bears 
sequence similarity to the deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a. We have established 
that full-length USP2a associates with Mdm2 in cells where it can deubiquitinate 
Mdm2 while demonstrating no deubiquitinating activity towards p53. Ectopic 
expression of USP2a causes accumulation of Mdm2 in a dose-dependent manner and 
consequently promotes Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. This differs from the 
behaviour of HAUSP, which deubiquitinates p53 in addition to Mdm2 and thus 
protects p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation. We further demonstrate that 
suppression of endogenous USP2a destabilises Mdm2 and causes accumulation of p53 
protein and activation of p53. Our data identify the deubiquitinating enzyme 
USP2a as a novel regulator of the p53 pathway that acts through its ability to 
selectively target Mdm2.

Abstract

Mdm2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes its own ubiquitination and also ubiquitination of the p53 tumour suppressor. In a bacterial two-hybrid screen, using Mdm2 as bait, we identified an Mdm2-interacting peptide that bears sequence similarity to the deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a. We have established that full-length USP2a associates with Mdm2 in cells where it can deubiquitinate Mdm2 while demonstrating no deubiquitinating activity towards p53. Ectopic expression of USP2a causes accumulation of Mdm2 in a dose-dependent manner and consequently promotes Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. This differs from the behaviour of HAUSP, which deubiquitinates p53 in addition to Mdm2 and thus protects p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation. We further demonstrate that suppression of endogenous USP2a destabilises Mdm2 and causes accumulation of p53 protein and activation of p53. Our data identify the deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a as a novel regulator of the p53 pathway that acts through its ability to selectively target Mdm2.

Introduction

p53 plays a critical role in preserving the integrity of the genome. Diverse cellular stresses result in p53 stabilisation and activation, which leads to the expression of genes involved in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis ( Vogelstein et al , 2000 ; Michael and Oren, 2003 ). Inhibition of p53 activity either through mutation or other mechanisms, including overexpression of Mdm2 and loss of p14ARF, is frequently required for tumour progression. Restoration of the endogenous p53 pathway is an attractive therapeutic approach for tumours expressing wild-type p53 ( Lain and Lane, 2003 ; Woods and Lane, 2003 ; Vousden and Prives, 2005 ).

Under normal conditions, p53 is tightly regulated. Mdm2 binds the N-terminal domain of p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity directly ( Momand et al , 1992 ; Oliner et al , 1993 ), and its E3 ligase activity promotes p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation ( Haupt et al , 1997 ; Honda et al , 1997 ; Kubbutat et al , 1997 ). Mdm2 can also inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 by promoting its conjugation to the ubiquitin-like molecule, NEDD8 ( Xirodimas et al , 2004 ). As Mdm2 is itself a transcriptional target of p53 ( Barak et al , 1993 ; Wu et al , 1993 ), the relationship between Mdm2 and p53 defines a negative feedback loop ( Picksley and Lane, 1993 ; Prives, 1998 ; Oren et al , 2002 ). Mdm2 has also been reported to have a number of p53-independent functions ( Ganguli and Wasylyk, 2003 ) and is overexpressed in a number of tumours, where it has been proposed to promote tumour survival through both repression of p53 and p53-independent mechanisms ( Wang et al , 2001 ).

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) represent one of the largest families of proteins involved in the ubiquitin–proteasome system ( Nijman et al , 2005 ). The abundance of family members presumably allows for diversity and specificity of DUB activity, although relatively little is known about the physiological substrates of individual members of the family. DUBs have several functions, which include processing and recycling of ubiquitin ( Wing, 2003 ) and reversal of ubiquitination of specific substrate proteins, analogous to the reversal of protein phosphorylation by phosphatases ( Li et al , 2002 ; Brummelkamp et al , 2003 ; Kovalenko et al , 2003 ; Graner et al , 2004 ). There is precedent for a role of DUB activity within the p53–Mdm2 pathway, as demonstrated by the activity of HAUSP, which deubiquitinates p53, Mdm2 and Mdmx. The effects of endogenous HAUSP on the p53 pathway are concentration-dependent. Partial knockdown of HAUSP causes destabilisation of p53, whereas more complete suppression can cause destabilisation of Mdm2 and Mdmx and accumulation of p53 ( Li et al , 2002 , 2004 ; Cummins et al , 2004 ; Meulmeester et al , 2005 ).

In this study we show that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a associates with Mdm2 in vivo . USP2a can deubiquitinate Mdm2, without reversing Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. Ectopic expression of USP2a therefore causes an increase in the levels of Mdm2 and promotes p53 degradation. Transfection of tumour-derived cell lines with siRNA-targeting USP2a results in increased p53 protein expression and upregulation of p53 target genes. We thus identify USP2a as a regulator of the Mdm2/p53 pathway that makes a significant contribution to repression of p53 activity in vivo . As such, the Mdm2-selective deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a represents a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at reactivating wild-type p53 in tumours.

Discussion

Despite the critical role of the ubiquitination pathway in the regulation of cellular processes, surprisingly little is known about the substrate specificity of individual deubiquitinating enzymes. In this study we have identified Mdm2 as a substrate for the deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a. USP2a acts selectively on the p53 pathway in that it can deubiquitinate Mdm2 without reducing p53 ubiquitination. Suppression of USP2a results in the destabilisation of Mdm2 and activation of p53 in vivo . The identification of USP2a as a regulator of Mdm2 will further our understanding of the mechanism of control of p53.

The role of USP2a in normal tissues has not been defined previously. It has been suggested that USP2a may play a part in normal spermatogenesis ( Lin et al , 2000 ), a process in which p53 is also thought to be involved ( Rotter et al , 1993 ; Schwartz et al , 1999 ). In mice and rats, USP2a mRNA levels are highest in testes, but mRNA is also expressed in many other tissues ( Lin et al , 2001 ; Park et al , 2002 ; Gousseva and Baker, 2003 ). We have confirmed these results with a panel of human RNA (data not shown). This suggests that USP2a could play a role in multiple normal tissues.

USP2a associates with Mdm2 in vivo . Our two-hybrid screen identified sequences within the N-terminus of USP2a that are sufficient for binding to Mdm2. However, deletion of both the N- and C-termini of USP2a was required to prevent complex formation with Mdm2. This indicates that there is an additional Mdm2 binding site in the C-terminus of USP2a. The USP2 gene encodes a second deubiquitinating enzyme, USP2b, as a result of alternative splicing of 5′ exons. USP2a and USP2b have different N-terminal extensions, but share an identical C-terminal catalytic core ( Gousseva and Baker, 2003 ; Graner et al , 2004 ), which contains the canonical isopeptidase Cys and His boxes which include the residues critical for catalysis. USP2b may consequently interact with Mdm2 through its common C-terminus. Further studies will be required to investigate the role of USP2b in the regulation of Mdm2. Consistent with the presence of two binding sites in USP2a, two regions of Mdm2 were able to associate with USP2a. Residues 1–110 at the N-terminus of Mdm2 were able to bind USP2a. In addition a second USP2a binding site mapped to residues 276–491. This latter region contains both the zinc finger and ring finger of Mdm2. Multiple contact points in USP2a could aid in properly orientating the DUB to mediate deubiquitination of its substrate. HAUSP has been shown to interact with residues 147–159 ( Sheng et al , 2006 ) and 223–232 of Mdm2 ( Hu et al , 2006 ), indicating that Mdm2 also has multiple binding sites for HAUSP, which are distinct from the USP2a binding sites.

We show that USP2a deubiquitinates Mdm2 in vivo . The behaviour of USP2a displays specificity with respect to the components of the p53 pathway. Overexpression of USP2a consequently results in elevated levels of Mdm2 and enhanced Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53. We compared the effects of USP2a overexpression with those elicited by HAUSP ( Cummins et al , 2004 ; Li et al , 2004 ; Meulmeester et al , 2005 ). In marked contrast to USP2a, HAUSP protected p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation, despite the presence of high levels of Mdm2. This correlated with the ability of HAUSP to deubiquitinate both Mdm2 and p53. USP2a has previously been shown to stabilise fatty acid synthase ( Graner et al , 2004 ), and it is probable that additional substrates also exist. We have demonstrated that a peptide from the N-terminal extension of USP2a binds Mdm2. Such extensions of deubiquitinating enzymes are proposed to be involved in mediating their interaction with specific substrates ( D'Andrea and Pellman, 1998 ). Indeed, the N-terminus of HAUSP has been shown to interact with both p53 and Mdm2 ( Hu et al , 2006 ).

We investigated the role of endogenous USP2a in regulation of the p53 pathway. siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP2a in the NTERA-2 testicular embryonal carcinoma cell line resulted in destabilisation of Mdm2, stabilisation of p53 and an increase in p53 protein expression. Suppression of USP2a caused a p53-dependent increase in the mRNA levels of p53-responsive genes involved in both cell-cycle arrest ( p21 ) and apoptosis ( Bax ) and of Mdm2 itself. This indicates that the accumulated p53 is transcriptionally active. Knockdown of USP2a, like siRNA-mediated suppression of Mdm2, resulted in a p53-dependent decrease in DNA synthesis and an increase in cell death. This demonstrates that regulation of the p53 pathway by USP2a is of physiological significance. We propose that in this tumour cell line USP2a, contributes to the maintenance of Mdm2 stability and thus promotes p53 degradation and limits p53 activity. When USP2a is inhibited, Mdm2 is destabilised, allowing accumulation and transcriptional activation of p53.

In the majority of cases, attenuation of p53 function occurs during tumour progression to facilitate escape from p53 surveillance. In approximately half of tumours p53 is inactivated by mutation, whereas in tumours expressing wild-type p53 other mechanisms are involved in its suppression. USP2a could act as an oncogene when overexpressed by inhibiting wild-type p53 function through stabilisation of Mdm2. Prostate cancers frequently express wild-type p53, and overexpression of Mdm2 without gene amplification has been linked with poor prognosis ( Osman et al , 1999 ). Furthermore, Priolo et al (2006) show that USP2a is oncogenic, and that it is overexpressed in approximately half of prostate tumours. They also demonstrate that high levels of USP2a in prostate cancers correlate with changes in gene expression patterns that are consistent with the repression of p53 transcriptional activity. These observations suggest that overexpression of USP2a could cause suppression of wild-type p53 during the development of prostate cancer. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that knockdown of USP2a causes accumulation of p53 and p21 protein in the LNCaP prostate cancer-derived cell line. Intriguingly, USP2a is upregulated in response to androgens ( Graner et al , 2004 ). Androgens promote the survival of prostate cancers, and there is evidence that this involves androgen-mediated repression of p53 function ( Sengupta and Wasylyk, 2004 ). Further work will be required to determine whether USP2a participates in androgen regulation of p53.

We observed that USP2a knockdown results in the p53-dependent death of NTERA-2 cells. This result is noteworthy as there is considerable interest in the development of non-genotoxic therapies aimed at activating wild-type p53 in tumours ( Lain and Lane, 2003 ; Woods and Lane, 2003 ). Additionally, Mdm2 has tumour-promoting activity in the absence of normally functioning p53 ( Wang et al , 2001 ; Ganguli and Wasylyk, 2003 ). The selective destabilisation of Mdm2 would make USP2a a useful target for therapeutic intervention in p53-positive tumours, as well as in p53-negative backgrounds, in which Mdm2 is required for tumour progression. USP2a-directed therapies could take advantage of two approaches. In addition to therapeutic agents that inhibit USP2a directly, agents could also be developed that block the interaction of USP2a with Mdm2. Our screen identified a peptide with similarity to USP2a that binds to Mdm2. The development of optimised peptides that prevent binding of USP2a to Mdm2 would allow validation of the therapeutic potential of specifically disrupting the interaction of Mdm2 with USP2a and could contribute to the discovery of small molecules that disrupt this interaction ( Bottger et al , 1997 ; Vassilev et al , 2004 ).

It will be of interest to determine whether USP2a and HAUSP function simultaneously in regulating p53 or whether one of them might predominate depending upon the cellular conditions or cell type. Cell type differences in dependency on particular DUBs could contribute towards the development of tumour-selective therapies for p53 activation. Indeed, the overexpression of USP2a in prostate cancer, a tissue in which it is not normally highly expressed ( Graner et al , 2004 ), suggests that USP2a might be a suitable therapeutic target in cancers of specific tissues. Additional studies will be required to further elucidate the degree of importance of USP2a in controlling Mdm2 stability and activity in normal development and cancer and of USP2a regulation in the signaling pathways controlling p53. It is becoming increasingly obvious, however, that numerous feedback loops are involved in the regulation of the p53–Mdm2 pathway, and that deubiquitinating enzymes play a significant role within these feedback loops.
