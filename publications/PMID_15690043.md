Proteins often function as components of multi-subunit complexes. Despite its 
long history as a model organism, no large-scale analysis of protein complexes 
in Escherichia coli has yet been reported. To this end, we have targeted DNA 
cassettes into the E. coli chromosome to create carboxy-terminal, 
affinity-tagged alleles of 1,000 open reading frames (approximately 23% of the 
genome). A total of 857 proteins, including 198 of the most highly conserved, 
soluble non-ribosomal proteins essential in at least one bacterial species, were 
tagged successfully, whereas 648 could be purified to homogeneity and their 
interacting protein partners identified by mass spectrometry. An interaction 
network of protein complexes involved in diverse biological processes was 
uncovered and validated by sequential rounds of tagging and purification. This 
network includes many new interactions as well as interactions predicted based 
solely on genomic inference or limited phenotypic data. This study provides 
insight into the function of previously uncharacterized bacterial proteins and 
the overall topology of a microbial interaction network, the core components of 
which are broadly conserved across Prokaryota.
