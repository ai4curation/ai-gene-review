A variety of surface receptors eliciting diverse cellular responses have been 
shown to recruit tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) adaptor 
molecules. However, a few TRAF-interacting intracellular proteins that serve as 
downstream targets or regulators of TRAF function have been identified. In 
search of new intracellular molecules that bind TRAF6, we carried out a yeast 
two-hybrid cDNA library screening with an N-terminal segment of TRAF6 as the 
bait. A novel human C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger family protein was identified, 
which when coexpressed with TRAF6 led to a suppression of TRAF6-induced 
activation of NF-kappa B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. This novel protein was 
designated TIZ (for TRAF6-inhibitory zinc finger protein). TIZ expression also 
inhibited the signaling of RANK (receptor activator of NF-kappa B), which 
together with TRAF6 has been shown to be essential for osteoclastogenesis. 
Furthermore, the expression level of TIZ appeared to be regulated during the 
differentiation of human peripheral blood monocytes into osteoclasts. More 
significantly, transfection of TIZ into the monocyte/macrophage cell line 
Raw264.7 reduced the RANK ligand-induced osteoclastogenesis of this cell line. 
Our findings suggest that the novel zinc finger protein TIZ may play a role 
during osteoclast differentiation by modulating TRAF6 signaling activity.
