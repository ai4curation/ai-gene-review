Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a key enzyme in the pentose 
phosphate pathway (PPP) and plays an essential role in the oxidative stress 
response by producing NADPH, the main intracellular reductant. G6PD deficiency 
is the most common human enzyme defect, affecting more than 400 million people 
worldwide. Here, we show that G6PD is negatively regulated by acetylation on 
lysine 403 (K403), an evolutionarily conserved residue. The K403 acetylated G6PD 
is incapable of forming active dimers and displays a complete loss of activity. 
Knockdown of G6PD sensitizes cells to oxidative stress, and re-expression of 
wild-type G6PD, but not the K403 acetylation mimetic mutant, rescues cells from 
oxidative injury. Moreover, we show that cells sense extracellular oxidative 
stimuli to decrease G6PD acetylation in a SIRT2-dependent manner. The 
SIRT2-mediated deacetylation and activation of G6PD stimulates PPP to supply 
cytosolic NADPH to counteract oxidative damage and protect mouse erythrocytes. 
We also identified KAT9/ELP3 as a potential acetyltransferase of G6PD. Our study 
uncovers a previously unknown mechanism by which acetylation negatively 
regulates G6PD activity to maintain cellular NADPH homeostasis during oxidative 
stress.
