Accumulating evidence indicates that estrogen regulates diverse but 
interdependent signaling pathways via estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent and 
-independent mechanisms. However, molecular relationship between these pathways 
for gene regulation under the direction of estrogen remains unknown. To address 
this possibility, our uterine analysis of Wnt/beta-catenin downstream effectors 
revealed that lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (Lef-1) and T cell factor 3 (Tcf-3) are 
up-regulated temporally by 17beta-estradiol (E2) in an ER-independent manner. 
Lef-1 is abundantly up-regulated early (within 2 h), whereas Tcf-3 is 
predominantly induced after 6 h, and both are sustained through 24 h. 
Interestingly, activated Lef-1/Tcf-3 molecularly interacted with ERalpha in a 
time-dependent manner, suggesting they possess a cross talk in the uterus by E2. 
Moreover, dual immunofluorescence studies confirm their colocalization in 
uterine epithelial cells after E2. Most importantly, using chromatin 
immunoprecipitation followed by PCR analyses, we provide evidence for an 
interesting possibility that ERalpha and Tcf-3/Lef-1 complex occupies at certain 
DNA regions of estrogen-responsive endogenous gene promoters in the mouse 
uterus. By selective perturbation of activated Lef-1/Tcf-3 or ERalpha signaling 
events, we provide in this study novel evidence that cooperative interactions, 
by these two different classes of transcription factors at the level of 
chromatin, direct uterine regulation of estrogen-responsive genes. Collectively, 
these studies support a mechanism that integration of a nonclassically induced 
beta-catenin/Lef-1/Tcf-3 signaling with ERalpha is necessary for 
estrogen-dependent endogenous gene regulation in uterine biology.

Abstract

Accumulating evidence indicates that estrogen regulates diverse but interdependent signaling pathways via estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent and -independent mechanisms. However, molecular relationship between these pathways for gene regulation under the direction of estrogen remains unknown. To address this possibility, our uterine analysis of Wnt/β-catenin downstream effectors revealed that lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (Lef-1) and T cell factor 3 (Tcf-3) are up-regulated temporally by 17β-estradiol (E 2 ) in an ER-independent manner. Lef-1 is abundantly up-regulated early (within 2 h), whereas Tcf-3 is predominantly induced after 6 h, and both are sustained through 24 h. Interestingly, activated Lef-1/Tcf-3 molecularly interacted with ERα in a time-dependent manner, suggesting they possess a cross talk in the uterus by E 2 . Moreover, dual immunofluorescence studies confirm their colocalization in uterine epithelial cells after E 2 . Most importantly, using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by PCR analyses, we provide evidence for an interesting possibility that ERα and Tcf-3/Lef-1 complex occupies at certain DNA regions of estrogen-responsive endogenous gene promoters in the mouse uterus. By selective perturbation of activated Lef-1/Tcf-3 or ERα signaling events, we provide in this study novel evidence that cooperative interactions, by these two different classes of transcription factors at the level of chromatin, direct uterine regulation of estrogen-responsive genes. Collectively, these studies support a mechanism that integration of a nonclassically induced β-catenin/Lef-1/Tcf-3 signaling with ERα is necessary for estrogen-dependent endogenous gene regulation in uterine biology.

DISCUSSION

Our recent concepts regarding canonical Wnt signaling suggest that functional activation of β-catenin-mediated pathway may interact with multiple nuclear signal transducers to coordinate tissue or cell-specific functions ( 10 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ). Consistent with this current notion, we demonstrated here, for the first time, that protein-protein interaction exists between activated Tcf-3/Lef-1 and ERα for estrogen signaling in the mouse uterus. More specifically, using an adenovirus-directed approach for selective abrogation of individual signaling events induced by activated Tcf/Lef or ERα, we were able to establish the presence of a synergistic control via these two classes of factors at the level of chromatin that directs endogenous regulation of estrogen-sensitive genes. This remarkable finding of ERα-independent early β-catenin/Lef/Tcf expression contributing to ERα-dependent gene-regulatory events in the uterus adds new insights to our understanding of uterine biology.

In the present study, we observed that of four Tcf/Lef families of genes, only Lef-1 and Tcf-3 were up-regulated by E 2 both at mRNA and protein levels (Figs. 1A and 2). In this regard, expression of both genes at mRNA levels appeared to be induced rapidly within 1 h, although they were differentially induced with time at protein levels. However, Lef-1 is primarily regulated early (by 2 h), as opposed to Tcf-3, which was undetected until 6 h but during the late times after E 2 , both proteins appeared to be detected with a predominant expression for Tcf-3. These results suggest that Lef-1 is a primary downstream effector for estrogen-dependent Wnt/β-catenin signaling during the early phase, whereas Lef-1/Tcf-3 primarily directs late signaling. This speculation is consistent with our temporal analysis of β-catenin activation in the mouse uterus by E 2 (Fig. 2). The discrepancy with respect to the time of accumulation of these protein factors, as compared with their mRNAs, under the direction of E 2 appears to suggest that they may possess differential control at the level of translational and/or degradation efficiency in the uterus.

We have previously demonstrated that several Wnt-signaling genes, including β-catenin, SFRP-2, Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Fz were regulated early by estrogen in an ER-independent manner in the mouse uterus ( 2 , 10 ). Consistent with our previous observations, in this study we also noted that the regulation of Lef-1 and Tcf-3 mRNAs does not require ERs during their effects by E 2 in the mouse uterus (Fig. 1, B and C). The mechanism of ER-independent control of early nonclassical uterine genes is currently unknown. However, it should be noted that one of the early canonical Wnt-signaling genes, such as SFRP-2 , has been shown to be regulated by E 2 at the level of mRNA without involving any intermediary protein synthesis ( 9 ), suggesting posttranslational mechanism, viz . phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation of unknown proteins could be involved. In this regard, a recently characterized estrogen-binding membrane receptor GPR30 is indeed interesting. Our recent unpublished work indicate that GPR30 is regulated by E 2 in the uteri of both wild-type and ERα −/− mice (Ray, S., and S. K. Das, unpublished observations). We are currently exploring a possibility for the role of GPR30 role in estrogenic regulation of ER-independent genes in the mouse uterus.

In our studies, we used ERα −/− mice that were generated by Lubahn et al . ( 25 ). In general, the uteri of these null mice showed 5–10% E 2 binding as compared with wild type, but failed to exhibit late physiological responses to E 2 . Although these null mice showed some leakiness in respect to the generation of spliced ER transcripts and proteins ( 45 , 46 ), their significance in uterine biology is not known. Two smaller transcripts resulted from the disrupted NEO sequence. One of the variants was generated by a frame shift mutation with early termination by a stop codon, whereas the other maintained ER reading frame and encodes a smaller mutant ER ( 46 ). In vitro expression studies of the latter form resulted in a smaller protein and detected transactivation function by E 2 ; however, it was completely abolished by ICI 182,780. It should be noted here that gene responses, as we observed by E 2 in the presence of ICI 182,780 in uteri of wild-type and ERα −/− mice, suggest that estrogenic responses are indeed ER independent but ligand dependent.

It has been well documented that activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling leads to cross talk with numerous transcription factors ( 39 ). Because our previous studies implicated a probable convergence between ERα and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in estrogen-regulated uterine biology, we examined protein-protein interaction between the effectors Tcf/Lef and ERα under the direction of estrogen in the mouse uterus. Our results clearly revealed that the estrogen-dependent activated β-catenin indeed interacted not only with Lef-1/Tcf-3, but also with ERα in a multimeric complex (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, the time-specific interaction of Lef-1 and Tcf-3 toward ERα closely resembles their uterine accumulation under the direction of estrogen (Fig. 2 vs . Fig. 3, A and B). In conjunction with this, our dual immunofluorescence studies strongly suggested that estrogen-directed interactions between each of these factors could be achieved primarily in uterine epithelial cells, because activated β-catenin has been shown to be exclusively localized in this cell layer by E 2 ( 10 ). Overall, these results strongly support a contention that epithelial cell layer is the primary target site for estrogen-directed regulation by these two different classes of transcription factors.

For our analyses, consistent with the above speculation, we selected several estrogen-responsive genes ( viz . c-Myc, Cdkn1a, Ltf, Ccnd1 , and Mmp7 ) that are known to be regulated exclusively in uterine epithelial cells, with an exception for Pgr , which showed expression both in epithelial and subluminal stromal cells ( 8 , 26 , 27 , 29 , 30 ). Indeed, our ChIP analyses clearly revealed that estrogen directs occupancy of both ERα and Lef-1/Tcf-3 in a concomitant fashion at distinct regions of the promoters for c-Myc, Cdkn1a, Ltf, Ccnd1 , and Mmp7 (Fig. 5). In this respect, we noted certain regions of the promoters that contain only a single consensus site, but recruited both ERα and Lef-1/Tcf-3, suggesting these two proteins may be occupied at that site in an associated manner (see Fig. 5, at position C for c-Myc , at position A for Cdkn1a , and at position C for Ltf ). This speculation is consistent with our observation of protein-protein interaction. However, Pgr appeared to be regulated only by ERα (Fig. 5), suggesting that this gene is probably not a target for Wnt/β-catenin signaling under the direction of E 2 . Furthermore, it is interesting to note that our analyses revealed that DNA recruitments of Lef-1/Tcf-3 and ERα by E 2 detected at 2 h for early genes were absent during the late time point at 24 h (data not shown). Similarly, the recruitments detected at 24 h for late genes were also undetected during the early time point at 2 h (data not shown). These results further emphasize that identified recruitments sites on gene promoters are indeed specific with time for gene regulation of expression by estrogen.

Previous studies have established that both Wnt/β-catenin and ERα signaling events are crucial for estrogen-regulated uterine responses in mice ( 10 , 25 ). However, the relationship between these two signaling pathways has never been explored in estrogen-regulated uterine biology. Here, we have undertaken for the first time an approach to dissect out the roles of an estrogen-induced individual signaling pathway that is mediated by either ERα or Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-1/Tcf-3 for gene regulation. In this regard, our ChIP analysis, in conjunction with expression studies, after perturbation of individual signaling via adenovirus approaches, revealed that both signaling events cooperate for the regulation of expression via interaction at the level of certain regions of endogenous gene promoters for c-Myc , Cdkn1a, Ltf , and Mmp7 genes (Figs. 6 and 7). It should be noted here that cyclin D1 did not show any cooperative interaction via these transcription factors at the promoter level, although individual signaling appeared to be essential for its expression (Fig. 7, A–C). Overall, these results are consistent with the known regulation via ERα for c-Myc, Cdkn1a, Ltf, Pgr , and Ccnd1 genes ( 8 , 11 , 28 , 31 , 32 , 33 ), as well as via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway for Myc , Ccnd1 , Cdkn1a , and Mmp7 genes ( 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ) in various systems.

In our studies, we have noted an interesting feature, i.e . that both Lef-1 and Tcf-3 are similarly recruited to the late responsive gene promoters Ltf, Ccnd1 , and Mmp7 by E 2 . However, in this regard it should be noted that Lef-1 and Tcf-3 have been shown to possess differential gene regulation acting as activator and repressor, respectively ( 47 ). Thus, it is possible that these two factors may potentially balance the regulation of gene transcriptional status.

Our studies clearly revealed for the first time that Ltf gene is indeed regulated by Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In this regard, Lef-1/Tcf-3 was specifically recruited at two distinct regions (at positions B and C). Interestingly, these sites essentially recruited ERα in cooperation with Lef-1/Tcf-3, because perturbations of individual signaling affect the other recruitment in conjunction with the suppression of expression. In addition, the recruitment of ERα by itself in the proximal region (at position A) appeared to be also essential for ERα-dependent gene regulation. This proximal interaction for ERα has previously been reported for gene regulation ( 11 , 32 ), although the control of additional upstream regulatory regions in gene expression has been previously postulated ( 32 ). To a similar notion, the regulation of Mmp7 by ERα is also clearly defined for the first time in this report.

Previous studies have already established that cyclin D1/D2 crucially controls estrogen-dependent uterine growth response ( 29 , 48 ). Our studies demonstrating the regulation of cyclin D1 gene by each of ERα or Lef-1/Tcf-3 signaling systems, without involving any cooperation at the level of promoter, is consistent with previous observations that either of these pathways directly impacts estrogen-regulated growth response ( 10 , 25 ).

Our studies strongly suggest that Lef-1/Tcf-3 should impact estrogen-regulated uterine biology. In this regard, homozygous null mice either for Tcf-3 or Lef-1 die during the embryonic or neonatal stages, respectively ( 49 , 50 ). Thus, uterus-specific conditional knock-out studies will be needed in the future to confirm their specific roles in uterine estrogen-signaling.

Here we attempted to demonstrate the comprehensive dynamic nature of sequential events resulting in transcriptional activation of selective estrogen-regulated uterine genes. Currently, hormone-mediated activation of Wnt/β-catenin and its cooperation with different nuclear transcription factors is considered to be a major area of research for therapeutic manipulation of various endocrine pathologies ( 39 ). In this regard, our studies demonstrating estrogen-mediated interactions between ERα and Wnt/β-catenin/Tcf/Lef signaling pathways are likely to contribute to the development of different therapeutic strategies.
