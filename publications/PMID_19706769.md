The Bcl-2 family of proteins consists of both antiapoptotic and proapoptotic 
factors, which share sequence homology within conserved regions known as Bcl-2 
homology domains. Interactions between Bcl-2 family members, as well as with 
other proteins, regulate apoptosis through control of mitochondrial membrane 
permeability and release of cytochrome c. Here we identify a novel regulator of 
apoptosis that lacks Bcl-2 homology domains but acts by binding Bcl-2 and 
modulating its antiapoptotic activity. To identify regulators of apoptosis, we 
performed expression profiling in human primary fibroblasts treated with tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a potent inflammatory cytokine that can 
regulate apoptosis and functions, at least in part, by inducing expression of 
specific genes through NF-kappaB. We found that the gene undergoing maximal 
transcriptional induction following TNF-alpha treatment was G(0)-G(1) switch 
gene 2 (G0S2), the activation of which also required NF-kappaB. We show that 
G0S2 encodes a mitochondrial protein that specifically interacts with Bcl-2 and 
promotes apoptosis by preventing the formation of protective Bcl-2/Bax 
heterodimers. We further show that ectopic expression of G0S2 induces apoptosis 
in diverse human cancer cell lines in which endogenous G0S2 is normally 
epigenetically silenced. Our results reveal a novel proapoptotic factor that is 
induced by TNF-alpha through NF-kappaB and that interacts with and antagonizes 
Bcl-2.
