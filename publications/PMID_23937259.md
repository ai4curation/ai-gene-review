A cluster of phosphorylation sites in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), 
including Ser910, Ser935, Ser955 and Ser973, is important for PD (Parkinson's 
disease) pathogenesis as several PD-linked LRRK2 mutants are dephosphorylated at 
these sites. LRRK2 is also dephosphorylated in cells after pharmacological 
inhibition of its kinase activity, which is currently proposed as a strategy for 
disease-modifying PD therapy. Despite this importance of LRRK2 dephosphorylation 
in mutant LRRK2 pathological mechanism(s) and in LRRK2's response to inhibition, 
the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Therefore we aimed to identify 
the phosphatase for LRRK2. Using a panel of recombinant phosphatases, we found 
that PP1 (protein phosphatase 1) efficiently dephosphorylates LRRK2 in vitro. 
PP1 activity on LRRK2 dephosphorylation was confirmed in cells using PP1 
inhibition to reverse LRRK2 dephosphorylation induced by the potent LRRK2 kinase 
inhibitor LRRK2-IN1 as well as in R1441G mutant LRRK2. We also found that PP1 
and LRRK2 can form a complex in cells. Furthermore, we observed that PP1 
inhibition modulates LRRK2's cellular phenotype by reducing skein-like 
LRRK2-positive structures associated with dephosphorylation. In conclusion, the 
present study reveals PP1 as the physiological LRRK2 phosphatase, responsible 
for LRRK2 dephosphorylation observed in PD mutant LRRK2 and after LRRK2 kinase 
inhibition.
