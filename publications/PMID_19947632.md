Metallochaperones are essential for the safe and targeted delivery of necessary 
yet toxic metal cofactors to their respective protein partners. In this study we 
examine the nickel-binding properties of the Escherichia coli protein SlyD, a 
factor that contributes to optimal nickel accumulation in this organism. This 
protein is also required for E. coli energy metabolism because it participates 
in the nickel insertion step during [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenase metallocenter assembly. 
Our study demonstrates that SlyD is a multiple nickel ion binding protein. The 
analysis of noncovalent metal-protein complexes via electrospray ionization mass 
spectrometry revealed that SlyD binds up to seven nickel ions in a 
noncooperative manner with submicromolar affinity (<2 microM, upper limit) and 
that the protein exists in a dynamic mixture of metalloforms that is dependent 
on the availability of nickel ions in solution. Structural analysis indicates 
that this metallochaperone undergoes small but distinct changes in the structure 
upon metal binding and that the nickel-binding sites are assembled through 
beta-turn formation. Although the C-terminal metal-binding domain is primarily 
responsible for metal chelation, we find that metal binding also perturbs the 
structure of the N-terminal domains. An investigation of the nickel sites by 
using X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that SlyD binds nickel ions by 
adapting several different geometries and coordination numbers. Finally, the 
characterization of SlyD mutants demonstrates that the cysteine residues in the 
C-terminal domain confer tighter affinity as well as increased binding capacity 
to SlyD. On the basis of the presented data a model for nickel binding to SlyD 
as well as its role in nickel homeostasis is discussed.
