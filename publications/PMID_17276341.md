The forkhead transcription factor, DAF-16, a downstream target of the 
insulin/IGF-I signaling pathway in C. elegans, is indispensable both for 
lifespan regulation and stress resistance. The molecular mechanisms involved in 
regulating DAF-16 transcriptional activation remain undefined. Here, we have 
identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, RLE-1 (regulation of longevity by E3), which 
regulates aging in C. elegans. Disruption of RLE-1 expression in C. elegans 
increases lifespan; this extension of lifespan is due to elevated DAF-16 protein 
but not to changes of daf-16 mRNA levels. We have also found that RLE-1 
catalyzes DAF-16 ubiquitination, leading to degradation by the proteasome. 
Elimination of RLE-1 expression in C. elegans causes increased transcriptional 
activation and sustained nuclear localization of DAF-16. Overexpression of 
DAF-16 in rle-1 mutants increases worm lifespan, while disruption of DAF-16 
expression in rle-1 mutants reverses their longevity. Thus, RLE-1 is an E3 
ubiquitin ligase of DAF-16 that regulates C. elegans aging.
