When asynchronously growing cells suffer from nutrient depletion and 
inactivation of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) protein kinase, the rDNA 
(rRNA gene) region is condensed in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which 
is executed by condensin and Cdc14 protein phosphatase. However, it is unknown 
whether these mitotic factors can condense the rDNA region in nutrient-starved 
interphase cells. Here, we show that condensin is not involved in TORC1 
inactivation-induced rDNA condensation in G1 cells. Instead, the high-mobility 
group protein Hmo1 drove this process. The histone deacetylase Rpd3 and Cdc14, 
which repress rRNA transcription, were both required for the interphase rDNA 
condensation. Furthermore, interphase rDNA condensation necessitated CLIP and 
cohibin that tether rDNA to inner nuclear membranes. Finally, we showed that 
Hmo1, CLIP, Rpd3, and Cdc14 were required for survival in nutrient-starved G1 
cells. Thus, this study disclosed novel features of interphase chromosome 
condensation.
