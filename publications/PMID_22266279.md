Neutrophil transmigration requires the localization of neutrophils to 
endothelial cell junctions, in which receptor-ligand interactions and the action 
of serine proteases promote leukocyte diapedesis. NB1 (CD177) is a 
neutrophil-expressed surface molecule that has been reported to bind proteinase 
3 (PR3), a serine protease released from activated neutrophils. PR3 has 
demonstrated proteolytic activity on a number of substrates, including 
extracellular matrix proteins, although its role in neutrophil transmigration is 
unknown. Recently, NB1 has been shown to be a heterophilic binding partner for 
the endothelial cell junctional protein, PECAM-1. Disrupting the interaction 
between NB1 and PECAM-1 significantly inhibits neutrophil transendothelial cell 
migration on endothelial cell monolayers. Because NB1 interacts with endothelial 
cell PECAM-1 at cell junctions where transmigration occurs, we considered that 
NB1-PR3 interactions may play a role in aiding neutrophil diapedesis. Blocking 
Abs targeting the heterophilic binding domain of PECAM-1 significantly inhibited 
transmigration of NB1-positive neutrophils through IL-1β-stimulated endothelial 
cell monolayers. PR3 expression and activity were significantly increased on 
NB1-positive neutrophils following transmigration, whereas neutrophils lacking 
NB1 demonstrated no increase in PR3. Finally, using selective serine protease 
inhibitors, we determined that PR3 activity facilitated transmigration of 
NB1-positive neutrophils under both static and flow conditions. These data 
demonstrate that PR3 contributes in the selective recruitment of the 
NB1-positive neutrophil population.
