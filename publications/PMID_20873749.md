## Abstract

Human frataxin is an allosteric switch that activates the Fe-S cluster 
biosynthetic complex.

Cellular depletion of the human protein frataxin is correlated with the 
neurodegenerative disease Friedreich's ataxia and results in the inactivation of 
Fe-S cluster proteins. Most researchers agree that frataxin functions in the 
biogenesis of Fe-S clusters, but its precise role in this process is unclear. 
Here we provide in vitro evidence that human frataxin binds to a Nfs1, Isd11, 
and Isu2 complex to generate the four-component core machinery for Fe-S cluster 
biosynthesis. Frataxin binding dramatically changes the K(M) for cysteine from 
0.59 to 0.011 mM and the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(M)) of the cysteine 
desulfurase from 25 to 7900 M⁻¹s⁻¹. Oxidizing conditions diminish the levels of 
both complex formation and frataxin-based activation, whereas ferrous iron 
further stimulates cysteine desulfurase activity. Together, these results 
indicate human frataxin functions with Fe(2+) as an allosteric activator that 
triggers sulfur delivery and Fe-S cluster assembly. We propose a model in which 
cellular frataxin levels regulate human Fe-S cluster biosynthesis that has 
implications for mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress response, and both 
neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease.
