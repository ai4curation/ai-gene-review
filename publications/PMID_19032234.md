BACKGROUND: Thioredoxins are cross-reactive allergens involved in the 
pathogenesis of atopic eczema and asthma. Cross-reactivity to human thioredoxin 
can contribute to the exacerbation of severe atopic diseases.
METHODS: Human thioredoxin, Asp f28 and Asp f29, two thioredoxins of Aspergillus 
fumigatus, and thioredoxin of Malassezia sympodialis were cloned and produced as 
recombinant proteins. Allergenicity and cross-reactivity to thioredoxins in 
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis patients were assessed by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), inhibition ELISA, immunoblot analysis, 
proliferation assays and skin tests. Molecular homology modelling was used to 
identify conserved, surface-exposed amino acids potentially involved in 
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding.
RESULTS: All thioredoxins, including the human enzyme, bind IgE from patients 
with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and induce allergen-specific 
proliferation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and positive skin reactions 
in thioredoxin-sensitized patients. Inhibition experiments showed that the 
thioredoxins are cross-reactive indicating humoral immune responses based on 
molecular mimicry. To identify structural surface elements involved in 
cross-reactivity, the three-dimensional structures were modelled based on solved 
thioredoxin structures. Analysis of the molecular surfaces combined with 
sequence alignments allowed identification of conserved solvent exposed amino 
acids distantly located in the linear sequences which cluster to patches of 
continuous surface areas. The size of the surface areas conserved between human 
and fungal thioredoxins correlates well with the inhibitory potential of the 
molecules in inhibition ELISA indicating that the shared amino acids are 
involved in IgE-binding.
CONCLUSIONS: Conserved, solvent exposed residues shared between different 
thioredoxins cluster to continuous surface regions potentially forming 
cross-reactive conformational B-cell epitopes responsible for IgE-mediated 
cross-reactivity and autoreactivity.
