The thrombospondins are a family of extracellular calcium binding proteins that 
are involved in cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. We have sequenced 
full-length human thrombospondin-4 and characterized the recombinant protein. In 
contrast to Xenopus laevis thrombospondin-4, the human protein contains an RGD 
cell binding sequence in the third type 3 repeat. Transfection of mouse NIH3T3 
fibroblasts or C2C12 myoblasts with a full-length human thrombospondin-4 cDNA 
results in the expression of a polypeptide with a reduced molecular weight of 
140,000. In the absence of reducing agent, the expressed protein has an apparent 
molecular weight of 550,000. Recombinant thrombospondin-4 has been purified from 
the culture supernatant by heparin-Sepharose and anti-thrombospondin-4 
antibody-Affi-gel affinity chromatography. Electron microscopy indicates that 
thrombospondin-4 is composed of five subunits with globular domains at each end. 
The observation of a calcium-dependent change in the electron microscopic 
appearance of thrombospondin-4 is consistent with limited tryptic digestion data 
that indicate that thrombospondin-4 is resistant to digestion in the presence of 
calcium. These data indicate that thrombospondin-4 is a pentameric protein that 
binds to heparin and calcium.
