Many types of sensory neurons contain modified cilia where sensory signal 
transduction occurs. We report that the C. elegans gene daf-19 encodes an 
RFX-type transcription factor that is expressed specifically in all ciliated 
sensory neurons. Loss of daf-19 function causes the absence of cilia, resulting 
in severe sensory defects. Several genes that function in all ciliated sensory 
neurons have an RFX target site in their promoters and require daf-19 function. 
Several other genes that function in subsets of ciliated sensory neurons do not 
have an RFX target site and are not daf-19 dependent. These results suggest that 
expression of the shared components of sensory cilia is activated by daf-19, 
whereas cell-type-specific expression occurs independently of daf-19.
