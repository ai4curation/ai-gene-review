Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked immunodeficiency caused by 
mutations that affect the WAS protein (WASP) and characterized by cytoskeletal 
abnormalities in hematopoietic cells. By using the yeast two-hybrid system we 
have identified a proline-rich WASP-interacting protein (WIP), which 
coimmunoprecipitated with WASP from lymphocytes. WIP binds to WASP at a site 
distinct from the Cdc42 binding site and has actin as well as profilin binding 
motifs. Expression of WIP in human B cells, but not of a WIP truncation mutant 
that lacks the actin binding motif, increased polymerized actin content and 
induced the appearance of actin-containing cerebriform projections on the cell 
surface. These results suggest that WIP plays a role in cortical actin assembly 
that may be important for lymphocyte function.
