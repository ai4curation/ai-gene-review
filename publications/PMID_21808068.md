Rab GTPases regulate all steps of membrane trafficking. Their interconversion 
between active, GTP-bound states and inactive, GDP-bound states is regulated by 
guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins. The 
substrates for most Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are unknown. Rab9A and 
its effectors regulate transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from late 
endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. We show here that RUTBC1 is a 
Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16 domain-containing protein that binds to Rab9A-GTP both in vitro 
and in cultured cells, but is not a GTPase-activating protein for Rab9A. 
Biochemical screening of RUTBC1 Rab protein substrates revealed highest in vitro 
GTP hydrolysis-activating activity with Rab32 and Rab33B. Catalysis required 
Arg-803 of RUTBC1, and RUTBC1 could activate a catalytically inhibited Rab33B 
mutant (Q92A), in support of a dual finger mechanism for RUTBC1 action. Rab9A 
binding did not influence GAP activity of bead-bound RUTBC1 protein. In cells 
and cell extracts, RUTBC1 influenced the ability of Rab32 to bind its effector 
protein, Varp, consistent with a physiological role for RUTBC1 in regulating 
Rab32. In contrast, binding of Rab33B to its effector protein, Atg16L1, was not 
influenced by RUTBC1 in cells or extracts. The identification of a protein that 
binds Rab9A and inactivates Rab32 supports a model in which Rab9A and Rab32 act 
in adjacent pathways at the boundary between late endosomes and the biogenesis 
of lysosome-related organelles.
