Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is highly expressed in 
neurons and PTEN inhibition has been reported to be neuroprotective against 
ischemic stroke in experimental models. On the other hand, PTEN deletion has 
been shown to lead to cognitive impairment. In the current study, we examined 
the expression and functions of PTEN in an ischemic stroke rodent model. We 
found rapid S-nitrosylation and degradation of PTEN after cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury. PTEN degradation leads to activation of Akt. PTEN 
partial deletion or PTEN inhibition increased the expression of GABAA receptor 
(GABAAR) γ2 subunit and enhanced GABAA receptor current. After cerebral 
ischemia, increased expression of GABAAR γ2 subunit was observed in the ischemia 
region and the penumbra area. We also observed PTEN loss in astrocytes after 
cerebral ischemia. Astrocytic PTEN partial knockout increased astrocyte 
activation and exacerbated ischemic damage. We speculated that ischemic stroke 
induced neuronal PTEN degradation, hence enhanced GABAA receptor-medicated 
neuronal activity inhibition which could attenuate excitotoxicity and provide 
neuroprotection during the acute phase after stroke, while inhibiting long-term 
functional recovery and contributing to vascular cognitive impairment after 
stroke. On the other hand, ischemic stroke induced astrocytic PTEN loss and 
enhanced ischemic damage and astrogliosis. Taken together, our study indicates 
that ischemic stroke induces rapid PTEN degradation in both neurons and 
astrocytes which play both protective and detrimental action in a 
spatiotemporal- and cell-type-dependent manner. Our study provides critical 
insight for targeting PTEN signaling pathway for stroke treatment.
