The ubiquitin E3 protein ligase Nedd4-2 is a physiological regulator of the 
epithelial sodium channel ENaC, which is essential for transepithelial Na+ 
transport and is linked to Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of 
human salt-sensitive hypertension. Nedd4-2 function is negatively regulated by 
phosphorylation via a serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase (Sgk1), 
which serves as a mechanism to inhibit the ubiquitination-dependent degradation 
of ENaC. We report here that 14-3-3 proteins participate in this regulatory 
process through a direct interaction with a phosphorylated form of human Nedd4-2 
(a human gene product of KIAA0439, termed hNedd4-2). The interaction is 
dependent on Sgk1-catalyzed phosphorylation of hNedd4-2 at Ser-468. We found 
that this interaction preserved the activity of the Sgk1-stimulated 
ENaC-dependent Na+ current while disrupting the interaction decreased ENaC 
density on the Xenopus laevis oocytes surface possibly by enhancing 
Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination that leads to ENaC degradation. Our findings 
suggest that 14-3-3 proteins modulate the cell surface density of ENaC 
cooperatively with Sgk1 kinase by maintaining hNedd4-2 in an inactive 
phosphorylated state.
