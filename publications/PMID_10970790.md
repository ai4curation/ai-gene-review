The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein ELO2p is involved in the elongation of 
saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Among several sequences with limited 
identity with the S. cerevisiae ELO2 gene, a consensus cDNA sequence was 
identified from the LifeSeq(R) database of Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Human 
liver cDNA was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides complementary to the 5' 
and 3' ends of the putative human cDNA sequence. The resulting full-length 
sequence, termed HELO1, consisted of 897 bp, which encoded 299 amino acids. 
However, in contrast with the ELO2 gene, expression of this open reading frame 
in S. cerevisiae demonstrated that the encoded protein was involved in the 
elongation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, as determined by the 
conversion of gamma-linolenic acid (C(18:3, n-6)) into dihomo-gamma-linolenic 
acid (C(20:3, n-6)), arachidonic acid (C(20:4, n-6)) into adrenic acid (C(22:4, 
n-6)), stearidonic acid (C(18:4, n-3)) into eicosatetraenoic acid (C(20:4, 
n-3)), eicosapentaenoic acid (C(20:5, n-3)) into omega3-docosapentaenoic acid 
(C(22:5, n-3)) and alpha-linolenic acid (C(18:3, n-3)) into 
omega3-eicosatrienoic acid (C(20:3, n-3)). The predicted amino acid sequence of 
the open reading frame had only 29% identity with the yeast ELO2 sequence, 
contained a single histidine-rich domain and had six transmembrane-spanning 
regions, as suggested by hydropathy analysis. The tissue expression profile 
revealed that the HELO1 gene is highly expressed in the adrenal gland and 
testis. Furthermore, the HELO1 gene is located on chromosome 6, best known for 
encoding the major histocompatibility complex, which is essential to the human 
immune response.
