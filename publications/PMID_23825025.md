The AP-5 complex is a recently identified but evolutionarily ancient member of 
the family of heterotetrameric adaptor proteins (AP complexes). It is associated 
with two proteins that are mutated in patients with hereditary spastic 
paraplegia, SPG11 and SPG15. Here we show that the four AP-5 subunits can be 
coimmunoprecipitated with SPG11 and SPG15, both from cytosol and from 
detergent-extracted membranes, with a stoichiometry of ∼1:1:1:1:1:1. Knockdowns 
of SPG11 or SPG15 phenocopy knockdowns of AP-5 subunits: all six knockdowns 
cause the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor to become trapped in 
clusters of early endosomes. In addition, AP-5, SPG11, and SPG15 colocalize on a 
late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Both SPG11 and SPG15 have predicted 
secondary structures containing α-solenoids related to those of clathrin heavy 
chain and COPI subunits. SPG11 also has an N-terminal, β-propeller-like domain, 
which interacts in vitro with AP-5. We propose that AP-5, SPG15, and SPG11 form 
a coat-like complex, with AP-5 involved in protein sorting, SPG15 facilitating 
the docking of the coat onto membranes by interacting with PI3P via its FYVE 
domain, and SPG11 (possibly together with SPG15) forming a scaffold.
