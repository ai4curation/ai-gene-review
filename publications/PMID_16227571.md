We describe a stable, multisubunit human histone acetyltransferase complex 
(hMSL) that contains homologs of the Drosophila dosage compensation proteins 
MOF, MSL1, MSL2, and MSL3. This complex shows strong specificity for histone H4 
lysine 16 in chromatin in vitro, and RNA interference-mediated knockdown 
experiments reveal that it is responsible for the majority of H4 acetylation at 
lysine 16 in the cell. We also find that hMOF is a component of additional 
complexes, forming associations with host cell factor 1 and a protein distantly 
related to MSL1 (hMSL1v1). We find two versions of hMSL3 in the hMSL complex 
that differ by the presence of the chromodomain. Lastly, we find that reduction 
in the levels of hMSLs and acetylation of H4 at lysine 16 are correlated with 
reduced transcription of some genes and with a G(2)/M cell cycle arrest. This is 
of particular interest given the recent correlation of global loss of 
acetylation of lysine 16 in histone H4 with tumorigenesis.
