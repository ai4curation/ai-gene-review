MAP Kinase Phosphatase-2 (MKP-2) is a dual specific nuclear phosphatase which is 
selective for both ERK and JNK, MAP kinases implicated in the regulation of 
apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. Here we report the conditional 
expression of MKP-2 in human embryonic kidney cells 293. We demonstrate that 
Flag-WT-MKP-2 is able to rescue cells from apoptotic commitment when subjected 
to UV-C or cisplatin treatment. We establish that upon stimulation all three 
major MAP kinase families (ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases) are activated. However, 
MKP-2 is surprisingly only able to deactivate JNK in vivo. Furthermore, whilst 
pre-treatment of cells with either the JNK inhibitor SP600125, or the MEK-1 
inhibitor PD98059, also reverses UV-C and cisplatin-induced apoptosis, the 
anti-apoptotic effect of MKP-2 overexpression is not additive with SP600125 but 
is with PD098059, suggesting that MKP-2 is involved in specifically terminating 
JNK activity and not ERK. The inability of MKP-2 to dephosphorylate ERK in vivo 
is also not due to the inability of Flag-MKP-2 to bind both ERK and JNK; 
phosphorylated forms of each kinase are co-precipitated with both WT and 
CI-MKP-2. Immunofluorescence studies however demonstrate that ERK is exclusively 
cytosolic in origin and not translocated to the nucleus following UV-C and 
cisplatin treatment whilst JNK is principally nuclear. These studies demonstrate 
the in vivo specificity of MKP-2 for JNK and not ERK and show that 
nuclear-targeted JNK is involved in genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis.
