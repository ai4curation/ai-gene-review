We have previously identified a novel interferon (IFN)-stimulated cis-acting 
enhancer element, gamma-IFN-activated transcriptional element (GATE). GATE 
differs from the known IFN-stimulated elements in its primary sequence. 
Preliminary analysis has indicated that the GATE-dependent transcriptional 
response requires the binding of novel transacting factors. A cDNA expression 
library derived from an IFN-gamma-stimulated murine macrophage cell line was 
screened with a (32)P-labeled GATE probe to identify the potential GATE-binding 
factors. A cDNA coding for a novel transcription-activating factor was 
identified. Based on its discovery, we named it as GATE-binding factor-1 
(GBF-1). GBF-1 homologs are present in mouse, human, monkey, and Drosophila. It 
activates transcription from reporter genes carrying GATE. It possesses a strong 
transactivating activity but has a weak DNA binding property. GBF-1 is expressed 
in most tissues with relatively higher steady-state levels in heart, liver, 
kidney, and brain. Its expression is induced by IFN-gamma treatment. GBF-1 is 
present in both cytosolic and nuclear compartments. These studies thus identify 
a novel transactivating factor in IFN signaling pathways.
