The pentaspan membrane glycoprotein CD133 marks lineage-specific cancer 
progenitor cells and is associated with poor prognosis in a number of tumor 
types. Despite its utility as a cancer progenitor cell marker, CD133 protein 
regulation and molecular function remain poorly understood. We find that 
the deacetylase HDAC6 physically associates with CD133 to negatively regulate 
CD133 trafficking down the endosomal-lysosomal pathway for degradation. We 
further demonstrate that CD133, HDAC6, and the central molecule of the canonical 
Wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin, can physically associate as a ternary complex. 
This association stabilizes β-catenin via HDAC6 deacetylase activity, which 
leads to activation of β-catenin signaling targets. Downregulation of either 
CD133 or HDAC6 results in increased β-catenin acetylation and degradation, which 
correlates with decreased proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth 
in vivo. Given that CD133 marks progenitor cells in a wide range of cancers, 
targeting CD133 may be a means to treat multiple cancer types.
