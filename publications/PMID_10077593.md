Angiostatin, a proteolytic fragment of plasminogen, is a potent antagonist of 
angiogenesis and an inhibitor of endothelial cell migration and proliferation. 
To determine whether the mechanism by which angiostatin inhibits endothelial 
cell migration and/or proliferation involves binding to cell surface plasminogen 
receptors, we isolated the binding proteins for plasminogen and angiostatin from 
human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Binding studies demonstrated that 
plasminogen and angiostatin bound in a concentration-dependent, saturable 
manner. Plasminogen binding was unaffected by a 100-fold molar excess of 
angiostatin, indicating the presence of a distinct angiostatin binding site. 
This finding was confirmed by ligand blot analysis of isolated human umbilical 
vein endothelial cell plasma membrane fractions, which demonstrated that 
plasminogen bound to a 44-kDa protein, whereas angiostatin bound to a 55-kDa 
species. Amino-terminal sequencing coupled with peptide mass fingerprinting and 
immunologic analyses identified the plasminogen binding protein as annexin II 
and the angiostatin binding protein as the alpha/beta-subunits of ATP synthase. 
The presence of this protein on the cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometry 
and immunofluorescence analysis. Angiostatin also bound to the recombinant 
alpha-subunit of human ATP synthase, and this binding was not inhibited by a 
2,500-fold molar excess of plasminogen. Angiostatin's antiproliferative effect 
on endothelial cells was inhibited by as much as 90% in the presence of 
anti-alpha-subunit ATP synthase antibody. Binding of angiostatin to the 
alpha/beta-subunits of ATP synthase on the cell surface may mediate its 
antiangiogenic effects and the down-regulation of endothelial cell proliferation 
and migration.
