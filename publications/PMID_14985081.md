The core protein of Hepatitis C virus affects several biological functions of 
the host cells such as cellular growth and apoptosis. The core was shown to 
interact with 53BP2/Bbp/ASPP2, a p53-binding protein, in a yeast two-hybrid 
assay. The core competed with p53 in binding to ASPP2 in vitro. In an apoptosis 
assay using human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells or hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 
cells, ectopic expression of p53 induced apoptosis and ASPP2 enhanced this 
p53-induced apoptosis. However, coexpression of the core with p53 and ASPP2 
increased the number of surviving cells. In a reporter assay, neither ASPP2 nor 
the core with ASPP2 affected the transcriptional activity of p53 on the 
promoters of Bax and p21, major p53 target genes. These findings suggest that 
the core inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis by blocking the interaction between p53 
and ASPP2, without modulating the transcriptional activity of p53, which plays a 
role in oncogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
