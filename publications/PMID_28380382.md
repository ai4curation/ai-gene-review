The iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster of the Rieske protein, UQCRFS1, is essential for 
Complex III (CIII) activity, though the mechanism for Fe-S cluster transfer has 
not previously been elucidated. Recent studies have shown that the co-chaperone 
HSC20, essential for Fe-S cluster biogenesis of SDHB, directly binds LYRM7, 
formerly described as a chaperone that stabilizes UQCRFS1 prior to its insertion 
into CIII. Here we report that a transient subcomplex involved in CIII assembly, 
composed of LYRM7 bound to UQCRFS1, interacts with components of an Fe-S 
transfer complex, consisting of HSC20, its cognate chaperone HSPA9, and the 
holo-scaffold ISCU. Binding of HSC20 to the LYR motif of LYRM7 in a 
pre-assembled UQCRFS1-LYRM7 intermediate in the mitochondrial matrix facilitates 
Fe-S cluster transfer to UQCRFS1. The five Fe-S cluster subunits of Complex I 
also interact with HSC20 to acquire their clusters, highlighting the crucial 
role of HSC20 in the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

INTRODUCTION

Ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (E.C. 1.10.2.2, also known as cytochrome bc1 complex or Complex III), a central component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, consists of 11 different subunits ( Schägger et al., 1986 ) that constitute the monomeric module of a symmetric dimer (CIII 2 ) ( Iwata et al., 1998 ). Energy transduction by Complex III (CIII) follows the Q cycle mechanism, whereby oxidation of a membrane-localized ubiquinol is coupled to proton pumping across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space. The catalytic activity of CIII depends on three highly conserved subunits that contain redox active centers, cytochrome b (MT-CYB), cytochrome c 1 (CYC1), and the Rieske iron-sulfur [Fe 2 -S 2 ] protein (UQCRFS1) ( Trumpower, 1990 ; Yang and Trumpower, 1986 ). The catalytic core of the complex is assembled via intermediate modules through transient association with assembly factors ( Smith et al., 2012 ). Incorporation of the Rieske protein UQCRFS1 is the penultimate step in CIII assembly, followed only by the insertion of a small supernumerary subunit (UQCR10 in mammalian cells). To date, Fe-S cluster delivery to the Rieske protein remains an uncharacterized process likely to be mediated by components of the iron sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly machinery that reside in the mitochondrial matrix. Biogenesis of Fe-S clusters is a complex process that begins with the assembly of a nascent cluster upon a dedicated scaffold protein, ISCU, which is contained within a multimeric complex ( Maio and Rouault, 2015 ). Subsequent binding of a chaperone/co-chaperone system (HSPA9/HSC20, respectively, in humans) facilitates transfer of the nascent Fe-S cluster to recipient proteins ( Rouault, 2015 ).

In the present study, we dissected mechanistic details of the last steps of CIII assembly and found that direct binding of the co-chaperone HSC20 to the LYR (Leucine, Tyrosine, Arginine) consensus sequence of LYRM7 was required for recruitment of the Fe-S transfer complex to the LYRM7-UQCRFS1 assembly intermediate, and ultimately for Fe-S cluster incorporation into UQCRFS1. The interaction of LYRM7 with the Fe-S transfer complex was further confirmed by mass spectrometric identification of HSC20 binding partners, which additionally identified all the Fe-S cluster subunits of Complex I as HSC20 interacting proteins, revealing the crucial role of the co-chaperone for the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
