Patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia and deficient glycine cleavage enzyme 
activity, but without mutations in AMT, GLDC or GCSH, the genes encoding its 
constituent proteins, constitute a clinical group which we call 'variant 
nonketotic hyperglycinemia'. We hypothesize that in some patients the aetiology 
involves genetic mutations that result in a deficiency of the cofactor lipoate, 
and sequenced genes involved in lipoate synthesis and iron-sulphur cluster 
biogenesis. Of 11 individuals identified with variant nonketotic 
hyperglycinemia, we were able to determine the genetic aetiology in eight 
patients and delineate the clinical and biochemical phenotypes. Mutations were 
identified in the genes for lipoate synthase (LIAS), BolA type 3 (BOLA3), and a 
novel gene glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5). Patients with GLRX5-associated variant 
nonketotic hyperglycinemia had normal development with childhood-onset spastic 
paraplegia, spinal lesion, and optic atrophy. Clinical features of 
BOLA3-associated variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia include severe 
neurodegeneration after a period of normal development. Additional features 
include leukodystrophy, cardiomyopathy and optic atrophy. Patients with lipoate 
synthase-deficient variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia varied in severity from 
mild static encephalopathy to Leigh disease and cortical involvement. All 
patients had high serum and borderline elevated cerebrospinal fluid glycine and 
cerebrospinal fluid:plasma glycine ratio, and deficient glycine cleavage enzyme 
activity. They had low pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity but most did not 
have lactic acidosis. Patients were deficient in lipoylation of mitochondrial 
proteins. There were minimal and inconsistent changes in cellular iron handling, 
and respiratory chain activity was unaffected. Identified mutations were 
phylogenetically conserved, and transfection with native genes corrected the 
biochemical deficiency proving pathogenicity. Treatments of cells with lipoate 
and with mitochondrially-targeted lipoate were unsuccessful at correcting the 
deficiency. The recognition of variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia is important 
for physicians evaluating patients with abnormalities in glycine as this will 
affect the genetic causation and genetic counselling, and provide prognostic 
information on the expected phenotypic course.

Introduction

Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH, MIM# 605899) is a disorder of glycine metabolism defined by deficient enzyme activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system and biochemically characterized by elevated glycine in serum and CSF, with an increased CSF:plasma glycine ratio. Typically patients present neonatally with lethargy evolving into coma, apnoea requiring ventilator support, hypotonia, hiccupping, and myoclonic jerks ( Hennermann et al. , 2012 ). Patients regain ventilatory drive after 2 weeks, but develop profound intellectual disability, spasticity, and intractable seizures. Some patients have brain malformations such as agenesis of the corpus callosum or hydrocephalus. Patients with attenuated NKH often present in infancy, have developmental delays, seizures, hyperactivity, and chorea ( Hennermann et al. , 2012 ). Biochemically, the glycine cleavage enzyme system is composed of the P-protein ( GLDC gene, MIM# 238300), which removes CO 2 from glycine and transfers the amino-methyl group to lipoate on the H-protein ( GCSH gene, MIM# 238330), and the T-protein ( AMT gene, MIM# 238310) which releases ammonia and forms methylenetetrahydrofolate, after which the reduced lipoate is re-oxidized by the L-protein ( Fig. 1 ) ( Kikuchi et al. , 2008 ). In typical NKH, 72% of patients have a causative mutation in GLDC , and 24% in AMT , with no mutations identified in GCSH ( Kure et al. , 2006 ; Hamosh et al. , 2009 ). In 4% of patients, no mutations were identified in a gene encoding a constituent of the glycine cleavage enzyme, despite proven deficient glycine cleavage enzyme activity and elevated glycine levels. We will refer to this group as ‘variant NKH’. A previous report of a patient with a regressive form of NKH who had deficient H-protein activity and H-protein devoid of lipoate focused our attention on the cofactor lipoate in variant NKH ( Hirage et al. , 1981 ; Trauner et al. , 1981 ). After normal development for 6 months, this patient lost all milestones, became lethargic, hypotonic, irritable, and developed seizures, dying at 15 months of age. The lipoate synthase enzyme uses an iron-sulphur cluster in a radical S-adenosylmethionine dependent reaction ( Fig. 1 ) ( Cicchillo et al. , 2004 ; Schonauer et al. , 2009 ). Recently, a patient with lactic acidosis was identified with mutations in the lipoate synthase gene ( LIAS , MIM# 607031) ( Mayr et al. , 2011 ). This patient presented with convulsions, progressive hypotonia, somnolence and major lactic acidosis. He developed spastic tetraparesis, multicystic encephalopathy and mild hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Rare patients presenting in infancy with severe fatal primary lactic acidosis had mutations in BOLA3 (MIM# 613183) and NFU1 (MIM# 608100) genes affecting iron-sulphur cluster metabolism, and causing impaired lipoylation of the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (αKGDH) ( Cameron et al. , 2011 ; Navarro-Sastre et al. , 2011 ; Haack et al. , 2013 ). They also had elevated plasma glycine levels. Patients with BOLA3 mutation presented in infancy with large lactic acidosis, progressive developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, white matter disease, cardiomyopathy, vomiting and distress, usually fatal in the first year of life ( Seyda et al. , 2001 ; Cameron et al. , 2011 ; Haack et al. , 2013 ). Patients with NFU1 mutations developed lactic acidosis, lethargy, feeding difficulties and failure to thrive, weakness and hypotonia, irritability, white matter disease, and spongiform cerebral degeneration with necrosis, or with pulmonary hypertension and neurological regression, usually fatal in infancy ( Seyda et al. , 2001 ; Cameron et al. , 2011 ; Navarro-Sastre et al. , 2011 ). All patients had elevated lactate and glycine levels. In this study, we identified 11 patients from 10 families with variant NKH. We hypothesized that defects in lipoate synthesis could be causative in some patients with variant NKH. For these patients, we review the clinical and biochemical spectrum and the genetic aetiology, including the first patients with neurological disease as a result of mutations in GLRX5 .

Biochemical results

Liver glycine cleavage enzyme activity was deficient where measured. Cultured skin fibroblasts from available probands all had deficient pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity and normal respiratory chain enzyme activities ( Table 1 ). Disturbed cellular iron handling has previously been described in some patients with iron-sulphur cluster genetic abnormalities ( Mochel et al. , 2008 ; Ye et al. , 2010 ). In contrast, both the mitochondrial and the cytosolic aconitase activities in our patients ( n = 6) were normal ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). No intramitochondrial iron accumulation was visualized in the fibroblasts of the patients with mutant GLRX5 or BOLA3 ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Quantification of iron per mg cellular protein in fibroblast lysates showed small differences: BOLA3- deficient Patient 6 had 133 ± 37% of normal control subjects ( P = 0.003, n = 6), GLRX5 -deficient Patient 1 had 119 ± 16% ( P = 0.03, n = 6) and Patient 2 had 99 ± 13% ( P = 0.9, n = 6) of normal control subject’s cellular iron (controls n = 30, 100 ± 20%). The previously reported GLRX5 patient had substantial transcriptional changes in iron metabolism-related genes with 15-fold elevation of heme oxygenase 1 ( HMOX1), 5-fold elevation of ferroportin 1 ( SLC40A1 ), and IRP2 was increased 2.4-fold. In our patients, IRP2 was not changed, and only in GLRX5 -deficient Patient 1 were HMOX1 and SLC40A1 increased 2.9-fold compared with control fibroblasts; all other patients were inside the range seen in control subjects. Treatment of fibroblasts from Patient 7 for 3 days with either lipoic acid or with a mitochondrially targeted and cleavable form of lipoate did not correct lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins or increase pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity (data not shown).

Discussion

The pathways for the biosynthesis of iron-sulphur clusters and for lipoate have recently been elucidated ( Hiltunen et al. , 2009 , 2010 ; Lill et al. , 2012 ; Rouault, 2012 ). Intramitochondrial fatty acid synthesis produces octanoyl-mt-acyl carrier protein ( Hiltunen et al. , 2009 ). The octanoyl group is then transferred to the H-protein of the glycine cleavage enzyme ( Schonauer et al. , 2009 ; Hiltunen et al. , 2010 ), and sulphur is incorporated by the lipoate synthase enzyme ( Nesbitt et al. , 2008 ; Lill et al. , 2012 ; Rouault, 2012 ). Lipoate is a critical cofactor for the glycine cleavage system, pyruvate dehydrogenase, αKGDH, and branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase ( Fig. 1 ). All patients presented here had reduced to absent lipoylation of proteins, and reduced activities of the lipoylated enzymes glycine cleavage enzyme system and pyruvate dehydrogenase. We identified mutations in three genes responsible for this deficiency in our patients: lipoic acid synthetase ( LIAS ), BolA family member 3 ( BOLA3 ), and glutaredoxin 5 ( GLRX5 ).

Pathogenic mutations in LIAS will result in reduced lipoylation of target proteins. The LIAS mutations changed highly conserved amino acids and were deleterious by in silico analyses. Reintroduction of the wild-type gene restored pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity proving its causative role. Molecular modelling did not allow us to derive conclusive insights of the mechanism for this decreased enzymatic activity. It is not yet clear which genes contribute to the origin of the iron-sulphur cluster of LIAS, but BOLA3 has been implicated in this process ( Cameron et al. , 2011 ; Haack et al. , 2013 ). In our patients, the nonsense nature of the stop mutation in BOLA3 and its recognition in multiple families suggest a causative role in this condition. Pathogenicity of a similar mutation, a frame-shift to stop codon eight residues upstream, has also been demonstrated ( Cameron et al. , 2011 ).

Mutations in GLRX5 are a newly discovered cause for reduced lipoylation. The proof of the pathogenicity rests on multiple lines of evidence. The deleted amino acid is located in the functionally important and conserved glutaredoxin domain. It resides in a domain of linkage in two geographically-related individuals, and is also found in an ethnically unrelated patient with the same phenotype, whereas it is absent in ethnically matched controls. Patient 3 also has an 8 bp insertion that frame shifts and truncates the message. Reintroduction of the normal gene into a patient’s fibroblasts corrects the lipoylation phenotype, providing compelling proof of a causal role. The molecular mechanism by which the deleted K51 impairs functionality is not yet clear. The protein is present in normal amounts and missplicing is unlikely given the normal RNA structure on reverse transcriptase PCR.

GLXR5 is a monothiol, mitochondrially located glutaredoxin that in yeast reduces disulphides using glutathione, including deglutathionylation of mitochondrial proteins ( Lillig et al. , 2008 ). This function is likely less relevant in humans as purified GLRX5 has 500-fold less deglutathionylation activity than GLRX2 ( Johansson et al. , 2011 ). Rather, GLRX5 is important for iron-sulphur cluster biogenesis, where in yeast it interacts with Isa1 in the transfer pathway to target enzymes after a basic [2Fe-2S] iron-sulphur cluster is generated on ISCU ( Nesbitt et al. , 2008 ; Lill et al. , 2012 ; Rouault, 2012 ). Given the deficient lipoylation, GLRX5 likely functions in the pathway that provides an iron-sulphur cluster to lipoate synthase. A direct interaction with lipoate synthase has not been shown. The deleted K51 potentially disrupts the iron-sulphur cluster interacting lysine residue (K59) through a change in tertiary structure, rather than any direct interactions. Alternatively, given its location on the external surface, the deletion could affect interactions with partner proteins. Some studies have suggested a homotetrameric structure with two [2Fe-2S] clusters and four glutathione molecules bound ( Johansson et al. , 2011 ), whereas others propose a heterodimeric structure of Glrx5–Bola3 with two shared iron-sulphur clusters, similar to Glrx5–Bola3 ( Li and Outten, 2012 a ; Li et al. , 2012 , b ). but no conclusive data have been published ( Lill et al. , 2012 ). This will require further functional investigations.

In this study, we delineate the clinical and biochemical phenotype of variant NKH. Biochemically, all patients had elevated plasma glycine and had been diagnosed as NKH. Most, but not all, had elevated CSF glycine but the increase was less than that seen in classic NKH, or even in the normal range, which complicates the diagnostic approach. Despite deficient pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in all, only some patients had elevated alanine and few had elevated lactate, which is strikingly different from the primary lactic acidosis presentation of multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome. Deficient lipoylation of proteins was present in 8 of 10 families, making this a possible primary test for this heterogenous disorder. Although it is important to note that not all patients with variant NKH have defects in lipoylation (see Patient P in Fig. 5 D).

Clinically, homogenous phenotypes in variant NKH have emerged. The patients with mutations in GLRX5 have relatively preserved cognition, but develop progressive spasticity and all remained alive. They developed signal abnormalities in the white matter hyperintense on T 2 and hypointense on T 1 , progressive in time course and genetic in origin consistent with a leukodystrophy. Characteristically they also developed lesions affecting the periaqueductal zone in the upper spinal cord. Previous case reports of patients with biochemically diagnosed NKH with a phenotype of isolated progressive spastic paraparesis, sometimes accompanied by anterior horn cell disease or with ataxia, occurred in patients of similar Lebanese descent ( Bank and Morrow, 1972 ; Steinman et al. , 1979 ). This presentation differs from that of classic NKH, and differs dramatically from the single previously reported patient with a GLRX5 mutation, who presented at the age of 60 years with pyridoxine-refractory sideroblastic anaemia, but without neurological symptoms (MIM# 205950) ( Camaschella et al. , 2007 ). This patient also had insulin-dependent diabetes, cirrhosis, hypogonadism, and increased ferritin, transferrin saturation, and ringed sideroblasts and ferritin-positive erythroblasts.

The patients with BOLA3 mutations were characterized by neurodegeneration after an initially normal early development, followed by early demise with or without a period of stabilization. Two patients developed MRI signal abnormalities in the white matter of increased intensity on T 2 , decreased intensity on T 1 , progressive in time course, and on post-mortem pathology revealing loss of cellular material in the white matter, likely reflective of a leukodystrophic process. Additional symptoms include optic atrophy, hypotonia and spasticity, and cardiomyopathy, and sometimes lactic acidosis, although not to the dramatic degree noted in previous patients ( Cameron et al. , 2011 ; Haack et al. , 2013 ). Two previously described NKH patients had similar findings: neuroregression and mildly elevated alanine in a patient with deficient liver H-protein lipoylation, and cardiomyopathy in a patient with NKH ( Hirage et al. , 1981 ; Trauner et al. , 1981 ; Al-Shareef et al. , 2011 ).

The phenotype induced by mutations in LIAS seems related to the severity of the functional impact on protein lipoylation. Patient 8, with some residual lipoylated enzymes present, had a mild and stable phenotype of developmental delay and mild seizure disorder, whereas Patient 7, with virtually absent lipoylation, presented with features of severe NKH such as diffusion restriction in the long tracts of the brainstem and internal capsule (yellow arrow in Fig. 2 F), with Leigh-like lesions such as diffusion restriction in the basal ganglia (red arrow Fig. 2 F), and cortical lesions as seen with αKGDH deficiency (blue arrow Fig. 2 F). In mice, complete absence of lipoate synthase is embryonically lethal ( Yi and Maeda, 2005 ).

The pathophysiology of variant NKH is complex. Iron-sulphur clusters are incorporated in many enzymes including respiratory chain complexes I, II and III and the aconitases. Some previously reported BOLA3 patients had reduced activities of some respiratory chain enzymes ( Cameron et al. , 2011 ; Haack et al. , 2013 ). None of the patients in this study had a deficiency of a respiratory chain enzyme, other than reduced liver succinate dehydrogenase activity of Patient 5. Cytosolic aconitase lacking an iron-sulphur cluster loses its aconitase activity and becomes the iron response protein IRP1, binding iron response elements on messenger RNAs involved in cellular iron regulation ( Pantopoulos, 2004 ). It stabilizes the transferrin receptor messenger RNA increasing iron import, and prevents translation of the transferrin and mitochondrial aconitase messenger RNAs ( Pantopoulos, 2004 ). Dysfunctional cellular iron regulation was noted in patients with iron-sulphur cluster defects such as deficient aconitase activities in patients with ISCU mutations ( Mochel et al. , 2008 ). A previously reported patient with near absent GLRX5 protein, as a result of the splicing mutation c.294A>G and fibroblasts with RNA interference-mediated knock down of GLRX5 , had deficient mitochondrial aconitase activity, IRP1 activation, decreased ferritin, increased expression of IRP2 , HMOX1 and SLC40A1 , and iron accumulation in mitochondria ( Camaschella et al. , 2007 ; Ye et al. , 2010 ). In contrast, the currently studied GLRX5 - and BOLA3-deficient fibroblasts had normal mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase activities, and no mitochondrial iron accumulation in a high iron environment. Two cell lines showed a mild increase in cellular iron and one cell line showed a mild increase in HOMX1 and SLC40A1 gene expression, much less than previously described, whereas other cell lines did not show any effect. This discrepancy may be because of the different mutations in GLRX5 , but the effect in BOLA3 was equally minimal. Thus, our study supports the conclusion that intracellular iron mishandling, although valid in some patients, cannot be generalized to the entirety of iron-sulphur cluster biogenesis defects, in contrast with the previous hypothesis ( Rouault, 2012 ).

Instead of dysfunctional cellular iron metabolism, the key pathophysiological component in variant NKH appears to be deficient intramitochondrial lipoylation. Therefore restoration of intramitochondrial lipoate may be a therapeutic target. Treatment with lipoate has only a limited effect and, where it occurs, will likely act through activation of pathways of AMPK and PGC1-α, upregulating the transcription of some mitochondrial enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase, and could stabilize certain mutations with some residual activity ( Koh et al. , 2008 ; Packer and Cadenas, 2011 ). Lipoic acid is not transported into the mitochondria but synthesized de novo , therefore a mitochondrially targeted and releasable form of lipoate ( Ripcke et al. , 2009 ) was tried in our study, but also found to be ineffective. Consequently, a different therapeutic approach will be needed to correct the observed defects.

In conclusion, variant NKH involves in most, but not all patients studied to date, defects of lipoate biosynthesis and related iron-sulphur cluster biogenesis genes, including LIAS , BOLA3 and GLRX5 . These patients present with a biochemistry of elevated glycine in plasma and CSF, less than expected for classic NKH. Symptoms such as leukodystrophy, secondary neurodegeneration after a period of normal development, Leigh disease, optic atrophy, cardiomyopathy and deafness are not part of classic NKH, and suggest the presence of variant NKH ( Table 2 ). The presence of elevated alanine or lactate can also be indicative, but is not required. The absence of lipoylated proteins on western blot in fibroblasts and possibly leucocytes may become a valuable screening tool, but will need further clinical validation. The pathophysiology reflects the deficiency of lipoate on intra-mitochondrial enzymes rather than perturbation of cellular iron handling. This information expands our understanding of the disorder non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia, which can now be classified as ‘classic NKH’ with mutations in AMT , GLDC or GCSH , or ‘variant NKH’ with mutations in LIAS , BOLA3 and GLRX5 , each with a specific phenotype. This information is important for physicians evaluating patients with abnormalities in glycine as it will affect the genetic causation and genetic counselling, and provide prognostic information on the expected phenotypic course.
