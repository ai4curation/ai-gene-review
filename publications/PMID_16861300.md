The activity of cullin-containing ubiquitin protein ligase complexes is 
stimulated by linkage to cullin of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 
("neddylation"). Neddylation is inhibited by the tight binding of cullins to 
CAND1 (cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1) protein, and Nedd8 is 
removed from cullins by specific isopeptidase activity of the COP9/signalosome 
(CSN) complex. The mechanisms that regulate neddylation and deneddylation of 
cullins were unknown. We examined this problem for the case of SCF(Skp2), a 
cullin1 (Cul1)-containing ubiquitin ligase complex that contains the S 
phase-associated protein Skp2 as the substrate-binding F-box protein subunit. 
SCF(Skp2) targets for degradation the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor 
p27 in the G(1)-to-S phase transition, a process that requires its 
phosphorylation and binding to cdk2-cyclin E. Because levels of Skp2, cyclin E, 
and the accessory protein Cks1 (cyclin kinase subunit 1) all rise at the end of 
G(1) phase, it seemed possible that the neddylation of Cul1 in SCF(Skp2) is 
regulated by the availability of the F-box protein and/or the substrate. We 
found that the supplementation of Skp2-Skp1 and substrate (along with further 
components necessary for substrate presentation to the ubiquitin ligase) to 
extracts of HeLa cells synergistically increased levels of neddylated Cul1. 
Skp2-Skp1 abrogates the inhibitory influence of CAND1 on the neddylation of Cul1 
by promoting the dissociation of the cullin-CAND1 complex, whereas substrate, 
together with substrate-presenting components, prevents the action of CSN to 
deneddylate cullin. We propose a sequence of events in which the increased 
availability of Skp2 and substrate in the transition of cells to S phase 
promotes the neddylation and assembly of the SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase complex.
