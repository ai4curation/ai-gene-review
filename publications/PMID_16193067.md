The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease, 
but its physiological function and that of its mammalian paralogs, the amyloid 
precursor-like proteins 1 and 2 (APLPs), is still poorly understood. APP has 
been proposed to form dimers, a process that could promote cell adhesion via 
trans-dimerization. We investigated the dimerization and cell adhesion 
properties of APP/APLPs and provide evidence that all three paralogs are capable 
of forming homo- and heterocomplexes. Moreover, we show that trans-interaction 
of APP family proteins promotes cell-cell adhesion in a homo- and heterotypic 
fashion and that endogenous APLP2 is required for cell-cell adhesion in mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts. We further demonstrate interaction of all the three APP 
family members in mouse brain, genetic interdependence, and molecular 
interaction of APP and APLPs in synaptically enriched membrane compartments. 
Together, our results provide evidence that homo- and heterocomplexes of 
APP/APLPs promote trans-cellular adhesion in vivo.
