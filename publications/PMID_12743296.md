Mumps virus is a common infectious agent of humans, causing parotitis, 
meningitis, encephalitis, and orchitis. Like other paramyxoviruses in the genus 
Rubulavirus, mumps virus catalyzes the proteasomal degradation of cellular STAT1 
protein, a means for escaping antiviral responses initiated by alpha/beta and 
gamma interferons. We demonstrate that mumps virus also eliminates cellular 
STAT3, a protein that mediates transcriptional responses to cytokines, growth 
factors, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, and a variety of oncogenic stimuli. STAT1 
and STAT3 are independently targeted by a single mumps virus protein, called V, 
that assembles STAT-directed ubiquitylation complexes from cellular components, 
including STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, DDB1, and Cullin4A. Consequently, mumps virus V 
protein prevents responses to interleukin-6 and v-Src signals and can induce 
apoptosis in STAT3-dependent multiple myeloma cells and transformed murine 
fibroblasts. These findings demonstrate a unique cytokine and oncogene evasion 
property of mumps virus that provides a molecular basis for its observed 
oncolytic properties.
