Argonaute (AGO) proteins interact with small RNAs to mediate gene silencing. C. 
elegans contains 27 AGO genes, raising the question of what roles these genes 
play in RNAi and related gene-silencing pathways. Here we describe 31 deletion 
alleles representing all of the previously uncharacterized AGO genes. Analysis 
of single- and multiple-AGO mutant strains reveals functions in several 
pathways, including (1) chromosome segregation, (2) fertility, and (3) at least 
two separate steps in the RNAi pathway. We show that RDE-1 interacts with 
trigger-derived sense and antisense RNAs to initiate RNAi, while several other 
AGO proteins interact with amplified siRNAs to mediate downstream silencing. 
Overexpression of downstream AGOs enhances silencing, suggesting that these 
proteins are limiting for RNAi. Interestingly, these AGO proteins lack key 
residues required for mRNA cleavage. Our findings support a two-step model for 
RNAi, in which functionally and structurally distinct AGOs act sequentially to 
direct gene silencing.
