We have identified a novel pro-apoptotic p53 target gene named CDIP (Cell Death 
Involved p53-target). Inhibition of CDIP abrogates p53-mediated apoptotic 
responses, demonstrating that CDIP is an important p53 apoptotic effector. CDIP 
itself potently induces apoptosis that is associated with caspase-8 cleavage, 
implicating the extrinsic cell death pathway in apoptosis mediated by CDIP. 
siRNA-directed knockdown of caspase-8 results in a severe impairment of 
CDIP-dependent cell death. In investigating the potential involvement of 
extrinsic cell death pathway in CDIP-mediated apoptosis, we found that TNF-alpha 
expression tightly correlates with CDIP expression, and that inhibition of 
TNF-alpha signaling attenuates CDIP-dependent apoptosis. We also demonstrate 
that TNF-alpha is upregulated in response to p53 and p53 inducing genotoxic 
stress, in a CDIP-dependent manner. Consistently, knockdown of TNF-alpha impairs 
p53-mediated stress-induced apoptosis. Together, these findings support a novel 
p53 --> CDIP --> TNF-alpha apoptotic pathway that directs apoptosis after 
exposure of cells to genotoxic stress. Thus, CDIP provides a new link between 
p53-mediated intrinsic and death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptotic 
signaling, providing a novel target for cancer therapeutics aimed at maximizing 
the p53 apoptotic response of cancer cells to drug therapy.
