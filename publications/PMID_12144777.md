Human renal dipeptidase is a membrane-bound glycoprotein hydrolyzing dipeptides 
and is involved in hydrolytic metabolism of penem and carbapenem beta-lactam 
antibiotics. The crystal structures of the saccharide-trimmed enzyme are 
determined as unliganded and inhibitor-liganded forms. They are informative for 
designing new antibiotics that are not hydrolyzed by this enzyme. The active 
site in each of the (alpha/beta)(8) barrel subunits of the homodimeric molecule 
is composed of binuclear zinc ions bridged by the Glu125 side-chain located at 
the bottom of the barrel, and it faces toward the microvillar membrane of a 
kidney tubule. A dipeptidyl moiety of the therapeutically used cilastatin 
inhibitor is fully accommodated in the active-site pocket, which is small enough 
for precise recognition of dipeptide substrates. The barrel and active-site 
architectures utilizing catalytic metal ions exhibit unexpected similarities to 
those of the murine adenosine deaminase and the catalytic domain of the 
bacterial urease.
