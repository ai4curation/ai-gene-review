Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in regulating eukaryotic gene 
expression. The HDAC domain, homologous to the yeast repressors RPD3 and HDA1, 
is considered necessary and sufficient for enzymatic activity. Here, we show 
that the catalytic domain of HDAC4 interacts with HDAC3 via the transcriptional 
corepressor N-CoR/SMRT. All experimental conditions leading to the suppression 
of HDAC4 binding to SMRT/N-CoR and to HDAC3 result in the loss of enzymatic 
activity associated with HDAC4. In vitro reconstitution experiments indicate 
that HDAC4 and other class II HDACs are inactive in the context of the 
SMRT/N-CoR-HDAC3 complex and do not contribute to its enzymatic activity. These 
observations indicate that class II HDACs regulate transcription by bridging the 
enzymatically active SMRT/N-CoR-HDAC3 complex and select transcription factors 
independently of any intrinsic HDAC activity.
