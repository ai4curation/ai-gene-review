Neurodegeneration can be triggered by genetic or environmental factors. Although 
the precise cause is often unknown, many neurodegenerative diseases share common 
features such as protein aggregation and age dependence. Recent studies in 
Drosophila have uncovered protective effects of NAD synthase nicotinamide 
mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) against activity-induced 
neurodegeneration and injury-induced axonal degeneration. Here we show that 
NMNAT overexpression can also protect against spinocerebellar ataxia 1 
(SCA1)-induced neurodegeneration, suggesting a general neuroprotective function 
of NMNAT. It protects against neurodegeneration partly through a 
proteasome-mediated pathway in a manner similar to heat-shock protein 70 
(Hsp70). NMNAT displays chaperone function both in biochemical assays and 
cultured cells, and it shares significant structural similarity with known 
chaperones. Furthermore, it is upregulated in the brain upon overexpression of 
poly-glutamine expanded protein and recruited with the chaperone Hsp70 into 
protein aggregates. Our results implicate NMNAT as a stress-response protein 
that acts as a chaperone for neuronal maintenance and protection. Our studies 
provide an entry point for understanding how normal neurons maintain activity, 
and offer clues for the common mechanisms underlying different neurodegenerative 
conditions.
