Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common motor neuron degenerative disease and 
the leading genetic cause of death of young children. The survival of motor 
neurons (SMN) gene, the SMA disease gene, is homozygously deleted or mutated in 
more than 98% of SMA patients. The SMN protein interacts with itself, with 
SMN-interacting protein 1, and with several spliceosomal small nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) Sm proteins. A complex containing SMN plays a critical 
role in spliceosomal snRNP assembly and in pre-mRNA splicing. SMN mutants found 
in SMA patients show reduced self-association and lack the capacity to 
regenerate the splicing machinery. Here we demonstrate that SMN mutants found in 
SMA patients are defective in binding to Sm proteins. Moreover, we show that 
SMN, but not mutants found in SMA patients, can form large oligomers and that 
SMN oligomerization is required for high-affinity binding to spliceosomal snRNP 
Sm proteins. These findings directly link the impaired interaction between SMN 
and Sm proteins to a defect in snRNP metabolism and to SMA.
