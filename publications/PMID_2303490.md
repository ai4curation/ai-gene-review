Two cDNA clones corresponding to human microsomal dipeptidase (MDP, formerly 
referred to as dehydropeptidase-I or renal dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11] were 
isolated from human placental and renal cDNA libraries employing rapid 
amplification of cDNA ends strategy. The complete amino acid sequence deduced 
from the cDNAs contains 411 residues, beginning with a signal peptide of 16 
residues. A highly hydrophobic sequence of 16 amino acids is located at the 
carboxyl terminus, supporting the previous observation which suggested that 
mature MDP is anchored to the membrane by covalently attached 
phosphatidylinositol. MDP has four potential N-glycosylation sites and has no 
apparent sequence similarity to other metallopeptidases. Expression of 
immunologically cross-reactive and enzymatically active MDP was attained in COS 
cells transfected with the cDNA. DNA and RNA blot analyses indicated the 
existence of a single gene and a substantial amount of 1.8-kilobase mRNA in 
kidney.
