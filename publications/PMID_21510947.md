Heat shock transcription factor (HSF), an evolutionarily conserved 
heat-responsive regulator, binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) comprising 
continuous inverted repeats of the pentamer nGAAn. Here, we analyzed DNA-binding 
ability, particularly for the discontinuously arranged nGAAn units, of HSFs from 
various organisms, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, 
Drosophila melanogaster, and Danio rerio. Among these, only C. elegans HSF 
failed to bind the discontinuous nGAAn units, which suggests that the target 
genes of HSFs in many, but not all, organisms contain discontinuous HSEs, as 
well as continuous HSEs. Further analysis of alternatively spliced HSF isoforms 
showed the importance of the C-terminal region in HSF-HSE interaction.
