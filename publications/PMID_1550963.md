The expression of the hsp16 gene family in Caenorhabditis elegans has been 
examined by introducing hsp16-lacZ fusions into the nematode by transformation. 
Transcription of the hsp16-lacZ transgenes was totally heat-shock dependent and 
resulted in the rapid synthesis of detectable levels of beta-galactosidase. 
Although the two hsp16 gene pairs of C. elegans are highly similar within both 
their coding and noncoding sequences, quantitative and qualitative differences 
in the spatial pattern of expression between gene pairs were observed. The 
hsp16-48 promoter was shown to direct greater expression of beta-galactosidase 
in muscle and hypodermis, whereas the hsp16-41 promoter was more efficient in 
intestine and pharyngeal tissue. Transgenes that eliminated one promoter from a 
gene pair were expressed at reduced levels, particularly in postembryonic 
stages, suggesting that the heat shock elements in the intergenic region of an 
hsp16 gene pair may act cooperatively to achieve high levels of expression of 
both genes. Although the hsp16 gene pairs are never constitutively expressed, 
their heat inducibility is developmentally restricted; they are not heat 
inducible during gametogenesis or early embryogenesis. The hsp16 genes represent 
the first fully inducible system in C. elegans to be characterized in detail at 
the molecular level, and the promoters of these genes should find wide 
applicability in studies of tissue- and developmentally regulated genes in this 
experimental organism.
