Alternative splicing of tau exon 10 generates tau isoforms with three or four 
microtubule-binding repeats, 3R-tau or 4R-tau, which are under developmental 
regulation. Dysregulation of tau exon 10 splicing is sufficient to cause 
neurodegenerative disorders. The RNA-binding Fox3 (Rbfox3), identified as NeuN, 
regulates RNA processing. However, whether Rbfox3/NeuN regulates tau exon 10 
splicing is unknown. In the present study, we found that the developmental 
expression of 4R-tau coincided with the expression of Rbfox3 in rat brains. 
Rbfox3 enhanced tau exon 10 inclusion. Tau intron 10 contains UGCAUG, the 
conservative binding sequence of Rbfox3. Intron 10 of tau pre-mRNA was 
co-immunoprecipitated by Rbfox3/NeuN. Deletion mutants of the RNA recognition 
motif (RRM) or three RNA-binding sites of the RRM in Rbfox3/NeuN failed to 
enhance tau exon 10 inclusion. Rbfox3, specifically expressed in the fetal 
brain, did not affect tau exon 10 splicing. The level of Rbfox3/NeuN was reduced 
and was associated with the ratio of 4R-tau/3R-tau in the excitotoxic mouse 
brains induced by kainic acid. These findings suggest that Rbfox3/NeuN regulates 
the alternative splicing of tau exon 10 and that decreased Rbfox3/NeuN may lower 
the ratio of 4R-tau/3R-tau.
