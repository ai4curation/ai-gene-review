## Abstract

1. Plant J. 1997 Sep;12(3):659-67. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-313x.1997.00659.x.

The VLF loci, polymorphic between ecotypes Landsberg erecta and Columbia, 
dissect two branches of phytochrome A signal transduction that correspond to 
very-low-fluence and high-irradiance responses.

Phytochromes play a key role in the perception of light signals by plants. In 
this study, the three classical phytochrome action modes, i.e. very-low-fluence 
responses (VLFR), low-fluence responses (LFR) and high-irradiance responses 
(HIR), were genetically dissected using phyA and phyB mutants of Arabidopsis 
thaliana (respectively lacking phytochrome A or phytochrome B) and a 
polymorphism between ecotypes Landsberg erecta and Columbia. Seed germination 
and potentiation of greening, hypocotyl growth inhibition and cotyledon 
unfolding in etiolated seedlings of the ecotype Landsberg erecta showed biphasic 
responses to the calculated proportion of active phytochrome established by one 
light pulse or repeated light pulses. The first phase, i.e. the VLFR, was absent 
in the phyA mutant, normal in the phyB mutant (both in the Landsberg erecta 
background) and severely deficient in Columbia. The second phase, i.e. the LFR, 
was present in the phyA mutant, deficient in the phyB mutant and normal in 
Columbia. Under continuous far-red light, HIR of etiolated seedlings were absent 
in phyA and normal in phyB and Columbia. The segregation of VLFR in recombinant 
inbred lines derived from a cross between Landsberg erecta and Columbia was 
analysed by MAPMAKER/QTL. Two quantitative trait loci, one on chromosome 2 
(VLF1) and another on chromosome 5 (VLF2), were identified as responsible for 
the polymorphism. Phytochrome A is proposed to initiate two transduction 
pathways, VLFR and HIR, involving different cells and/or different molecular 
steps. This is the first application of the analysis of quantitative trait loci 
polymorphic between ecotypes to dissect transduction chains of environmental 
signals.
