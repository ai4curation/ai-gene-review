The TCP1 ring complex (TRiC) is a molecular chaperone involved in actin and 
tubulin folding. Little is known about the components of this complex. The first 
component identified was TCP1, a protein coded by a gene in the t-complex locus 
on mouse chromosome 17. This locus is involved in several embryonic defects, 
male sterility, and the transmission ratio distortion. In humans, the t-complex 
genes map to chromosome 6. Other components of TRiC are thought to be 
TCP1-related proteins. Recently, a mouse cDNA coding for one of these proteins 
has been cloned and named mTRiC-P5. Here we report the cloning of a partial 
human cDNA clone, homologous to mTRiC-P5, and its chromosome localization by 
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The human TRiC-P5 gene (TRIC5) maps to human 
chromosome 1q23, a region known to be a preferential chromosomal breakpoint 
involved in leukemia. Therefore, even if TCP1 and TRiC-P5 are related proteins 
and are found in the same protein complex, they are not coded by syntenic genes 
in humans.
