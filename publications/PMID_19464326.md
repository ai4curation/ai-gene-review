BACKGROUND: The HSPB family is one of the more diverse families within the group 
of HSP families. Some members have chaperone-like activities and/or play a role 
in cytoskeletal stabilization. Some members also show a dynamic, stress-induced 
translocation to SC35 splicing speckles. If and how these features are 
interrelated and if they are shared by all members are yet unknown.
METHODS: Tissue expression data and interaction and co-regulated gene expression 
data of the human HSPB members was analyzed using bioinformatics. Using a gene 
expression library, sub-cellular distribution of the diverse members was 
analyzed by confocal microscopy. Chaperone activity was measured using a 
cellular luciferase refolding assay.
RESULTS: Online databases did not accurately predict the sub-cellular 
distribution of all the HSPB members. A novel and non-predicted finding was that 
HSPB7 constitutively localized to SC35 splicing speckles, driven by its 
N-terminus. Unlike HSPB1 and HSPB5, that chaperoned heat unfolded substrates and 
kept them folding competent, HSPB7 did not support refolding.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a non-chaperone-like role of HSPB7 at SC35 
speckles.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The functional divergence between HSPB members seems 
larger than previously expected and also includes non-canonical members lacking 
classical chaperone-like functions.
