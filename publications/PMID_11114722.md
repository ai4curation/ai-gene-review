We have studied ceBNIP3, the orthologue of BNIP3 in C. elegans. Sequence 
analysis reveals that the different domains of BNIP3 have been conserved 
throughout evolution. ceBNIP3 contains a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain, a 
conserved domain (CD) of 19 amino acids, a BCL-2 homology-3 (BH3)-like domain 
and a PEST sequence. ceBNIP3 is expressed primarily as a 25 kDa monomer and a 50 
kDa homodimer. After transfection, ceBNIP3 protein is rapidly degraded through a 
ubiquitin-dependent pathway by the proteasome. Like BNIP3, the TM domain of 
ceBNIP3 mediates the localization of the protein to mitochondria and is also 
necessary for homodimerization and cell death in mammalian cells. Neither the 
putative BH3 domain nor conserved domain is necessary for killing. ceBNIP3 
protein interacts with CED-9 and BCL-XL, but unlike other pro-apoptotic BCL-2 
family members, the BH3-like domain does not participate in dimerization. The 
ceBNIP3 TM domain mediates interaction with both CED-9 and BCL-XL. ceBNIP3 
interacts with CED-3 but co-expression of CED-3 and ceBNIP3 does not 
significantly enhance induction of cell death in the presence or absence of 
CED-4. ceBNIP3 kills mammalian cells by a caspase-independent mechanism. In 
conclusion, we find that although ceBNIP3 interacts with CED-9 and CED-3 it 
kills by a BH3- and caspase-independent mechanism.
