Using the technique of subtractive hybridization (natural killer (NK) minus T 
helper cell line Jurkat), a human cDNA clone named B2-1 was isolated and 
sequenced. B2-1 transcripts are highly expressed in NK and peripheral T cells, 
but not in the T helper cell line used in the subtraction. Two overlapping cDNA 
clones contained 3309 bp, in agreement with a predicted size of 3.2 kb obtained 
by Northern blot analysis. The cDNA contained a 5' open reading frame encoding a 
398 amino acid (aa) protein with a calculated M(r) of 46,383. The protein 
contains N-linked glycosylation sites and a site for phosphorylation by protein 
kinase C. Database homology searches show that the deduced protein is novel and 
has three discrete domains with significant homology to several structural 
proteins. The most striking homology was to yeast SEC7 in the central domain of 
the gene (57% identical over 466 bp) and also the protein level (42% identical 
amino acids; 39% conserved amino acids). SEC7 is a large protein (2008 amino 
acids) found on Golgi vesicles that plays a role in protein transport.
