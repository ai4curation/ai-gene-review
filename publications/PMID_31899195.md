T-helper 17 (Th17) cells are involved in the occurrence and development of 
several inflammation-associated diseases. Interleukin (IL)-17, the main cytokine 
secreted by differentiated Th17 cells, mediates immunoreactions and plays 
important roles in immunological diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatic 
arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The maturation and stabilization of 
the differentiated Th17 cell phenotype are associated with the expression of 
IL-17A, which is induced by the activation of signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3). Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) also plays an essential role in 
T-cell activation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Th17 cell 
differentiation and the role of PHB1 have not yet been completely elucidated, 
and this information would greatly facilitate the development of therapeutic 
strategies to prevent or treat immune-associated diseases. Here, we found that 
STAT3 expression was correlated with PHB1 mRNA expression during Th17 cell 
differentiation. Double-labeling immunofluorescence assay results showed that 
exogenous PHB1 and STAT3 proteins were not only located primarily in the nucleus 
but also in the cytoplasm of human Th17 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays of 
Th17 cells revealed that PHB1 interacted with STAT3 and with activated STAT3 
phosphorylated at Ser727 but not at Tyr705. Knocking down PHB1 with specific 
short hairpin RNAs attenuated both STAT3 and IL-17 expression levels as well as 
IL-17 secretion in Th17 cells. These results indicate that PHB1 and STAT3 
interact to affect IL-17 secretion in Th17 cells and provide important insights 
for modulating Th17-mediated pathogenic immune responses.
