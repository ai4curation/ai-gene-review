Transformation of chicken embryo cells by oncogenic forms of pp60src (e.g., 
pp60v-src or pp60527F) is linked with a concomitant increase in the steady-state 
levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins. Activated forms of the Src 
protein-tyrosine kinase stably associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, 
including a protein of 110 kDa, pp110. Previous reports have established that 
stable complex formation between pp110 and pp60src requires the structural 
integrity of the Src SH2 and SH3 domains, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of 
pp110 requires only the structural integrity of the SH3 domain. In normal 
chicken embryo cells, pp110 colocalizes with actin stress filaments, and in 
Src-transformed cells, pp110 is found associated with podosomes (rosettes). 
Here, we report the identification and characterization of cDNAs encoding pp110. 
The predicted open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 635 amino acids which 
exhibits little sequence similarity with other protein sequences present in the 
available sequence data bases. Thus, pp110 is a distinctive 
cytoskeleton-associated protein. On the basis of its association with actin 
stress filaments, we propose the term AFAP-110, for actin filament-associated 
protein of 110 kDa. In vitro analysis of AFAP-110 binding to bacterium-encoded 
glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins revealed that AFAP-110 present 
in normal cell extracts binds efficiently to Src SH3/SH2-containing fusion 
proteins, less efficiently to Src SH3-containing proteins, and poorly to 
SH2-containing fusion proteins. In contrast, AFAP-110 in Src-transformed cell 
extracts bound to GST-SH3/SH2 and GST-SH2 fusion proteins. Analysis of AFAP-110 
cDNA sequences revealed the presence of sequence motifs predicted to bind to SH2 
and SH3 domains, respectively. We suggest that AFAP-110 may represent a cellular 
protein capable of interacting with SH3-containing proteins and, upon tyrosine 
phosphorylation, binds tightly to SH2-containing proteins, such as pp60src or 
pp59fyn. The potential roles of AFAP-110 as an SH3/SH2 cytoskeletal binding 
protein are discussed.
