Arabidopsis seedling photomorphogenesis involves two antagonistically acting 
components, COP1 and HY5. COP1 specifically targets HY5 for degradation via the 
26S proteasome in the dark through their direct physical interaction. Little is 
known regarding how light signals perceived by photoreceptors are transduced to 
regulate COP1. Arabidopsis has two related cryptochromes (cry1 and cry2) 
mediating various blue/ultraviolet-A light responses. Here we show that both 
photoactivated cryptochromes repress COP1 activity through a direct 
protein-protein contact and that this direct regulation is primarily responsible 
for the cryptochrome-mediated blue light regulation of seedling photomorphogenic 
development and genome expression profile.
