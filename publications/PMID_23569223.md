TorsinA is a membrane-associated AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of 
cellular activities) ATPase implicated in primary dystonia, an 
autosomal-dominant movement disorder. We reconstituted TorsinA and its cofactors 
in vitro and show that TorsinA does not display ATPase activity in isolation; 
ATP hydrolysis is induced upon association with LAP1 and LULL1, type II 
transmembrane proteins residing in the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic 
reticulum. This interaction requires TorsinA to be in the ATP-bound state, and 
can be attributed to the luminal domains of LAP1 and LULL1. This ATPase 
activator function controls the activities of other members of the Torsin family 
in distinct fashion, leading to an acceleration of the hydrolysis step by up to 
two orders of magnitude. The dystonia-causing mutant of TorsinA is defective in 
this activation mechanism, suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism for this 
congenital disorder.
