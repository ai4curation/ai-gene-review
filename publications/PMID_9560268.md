The BRCA2 gene was identified based on its involvement in familial breast 
cancer. The analysis of its sequence predicts that the gene encodes a protein 
with 3,418 amino acids but provides very few clues pointing to its biological

pancreatic cancer cells, Capan-1, expressing truncated BRCA2 were shown to be 
hypersensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment. Exogenous expression 
of wild-type BRCA2, but not BRC-deleted mutants, in Capan-1 cells confers 
resistance to MMS treatment. These results suggest that the interaction between

Abstract

The BRCA2 gene was identified based on its involvement in familial breast cancer. The analysis of its sequence predicts that the gene encodes a protein with 3,418 amino acids but provides very few clues pointing to its biological function. In an attempt to address this question, specific antibodies were prepared that identified the gene product of BRCA2 as a 390-kDa nuclear protein. Furthermore, direct binding of human RAD51 to each of the four single 30-amino acid BRC repeats located at the 5′ portion of exon 11 of BRCA2 was demonstrated. Such an interaction is significant, as BRCA2 and RAD51 can be reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated by each of the individual, specific antibodies and form complexes in vivo . Inferring from the function of RAD51 in DNA repair, human pancreatic cancer cells, Capan-1, expressing truncated BRCA2 were shown to be hypersensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment. Exogenous expression of wild-type BRCA2, but not BRC-deleted mutants, in Capan-1 cells confers resistance to MMS treatment. These results suggest that the interaction between the BRC repeats of BRCA2 and RAD51 is critical for cellular response to DNA damage caused by MMS.

DISCUSSION

In an attempt to address the potential biological function of BRCA2, we have determined that the gene product of BRCA2 is a 390-kDa nuclear protein. The BRCA2 390-kDa protein directly binds to human RAD51 through its BRC repeats located at the 5′ portion of exon 11. Such an interaction is significant because BRCA2 and RAD51 apparently form a complex in cells. Using human pancreatic cancer cells, Capan-1, that express a truncated BRCA2, ectopic expression of the wild-type BRCA2, but not BRC-deleted mutants in these cells, restores their resistance to MMS treatment. These data suggest that the BRC repeats are important for the BRCA2 and RAD51 interaction, which seems critical for cellular response to DNA damage.

The above findings underscore the importance of the BRC repeats in BRCA2 because they mediate interactions with RAD51, a critical protein for DNA recombination and double-stranded DNA break repair ( 21 – 23 ). Interestingly, the first four BRC repeats found in the 5′ region of exon 11 are the most conserved in mammals ( 19 , 20 ) and bind RAD51 strongly. The four repeats at the 3′ end of exon 11 are less conserved and do not or weakly bind to RAD51 (Fig. 2 C and D ). These results implicate that the RAD51 binding activity of the BRC repeats is conserved among mammals and may reflect the importance of the BRCA2 function in the RAD51-associated pathway. Although the precise stoichiometry of this complex has to be determined, the eight BRC repeats of BRCA2 apparently did not all bind to RAD51 despite sharing sequence similarity. The four less conserved repeats may have other functions. Recently, the C-terminal region of mouse Brca2 was reported to interact with mouse Rad51 in a two-hybrid system ( 11 , 27 ). This result is clearly different from our finding that specific BRC repeats instead of the C-terminal region of BRCA2 bind to human RAD51. Although the precise reason for this discrepancy remains unclear, there are several possibilities. First, BRC repeat binding might have been overlooked because there was no systematic examination for RAD51 binding activity in other regions of BRCA2. Alternatively, a weak RAD51 binding activity exists at the C-terminal region of mouse Brca2 that is different from humans.

RAD51 is known to be a component in a complex containing other proteins such as RAD52, RAD55, and RAD57 that is involved in DNA recombination or double-stranded DNA break repair ( 21 – 23 ). Apparently, in addition to BRCA2, several other cellular proteins were specifically co-immunoprecipitated by anti-RAD51. However, some of these proteins were not found in the immunoprecipitates with anti-BRCA2. Two proteins with molecular mass of 150 and 85 kDa, respectively, are particularly noticeable in the complex with BRCA2 (Fig. 3 , lane 2). Further identification of these proteins will be of great interest because they will probably provide additional information concerning how BRCA2 functions.

The ability of exogenous expression of BRCA2 to rescue the hypersensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells to MMS indicates a positive role of BRCA2 in the cellular response to DNA damage. It has been reported that mouse Brca2 may have a role in DNA repair as Brca2 −/− mouse embryos are hypersensitive to γ-irradiation ( 11 ). Despite the fact that the mechanism of MMS-induced DNA damage is not completely clear, many reports suggested that MMS induces double-stranded DNA breaks and, therefore, mimics γ-irradiation ( 24 – 26 , 28 ). This scenario is plausible because the BRCA2 interacting protein, RAD51, is primarily involved in double-stranded DNA break repair. Results obtained by Holt’s group also suggested that Capan-1 is hypersensitive to γ-irradiation (J. Holt, personal communication). However, some reports suggest that MMS serves as an alkylating agent that causes single point mutations ( 29 ). If this is the case, BRCA2 may also have a role in the DNA excision repair pathway possibly mediated by different repair proteins. However, the current results did not provide such evidence. Nevertheless, these initial results will allow us to establish an assay for addressing the BRCA2 structure/function relationship in response to DNA damage.

It was reported that BRCA1 also interacts and colocalizes with RAD51 ( 30 ), although no BRC repeats are found in BRCA1. Our preliminary results do not support a direct interaction between RAD51 and BRCA1 by either in vitro or yeast two-hybrid binding assays. Homologs of the BRCT domain in BRCA1 are located in various proteins, including a specific BRCA1-interacting protein, BARD1 ( 31 ), and others involved in the repair and recombination process ( 32 , 33 ), suggesting (though not proving) that BRCA1 may have a role in these activities. This line of thinking is particularly revealing because deletion of Brca1 or Brca2 in mice resulted in failure of early embryogenesis, and loss of function of these genes in humans with hereditary breast cancer resulted in unrestricted growth and tumor formation. Further experimental evidence is needed to substantiate this hypothesis.

Whether mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 are threshold events in breast cancer formation remain to be determined. If both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are only involved in the DNA repair process as mutS is in colon cancer ( 34 , 35 ), exogenous expression of those wild-type genes in cancer cells may only rescue their repair activity and may not be able to suppress their tumorigenicity. This distinction is important for the future treatment for BRCA-related cancers. In yeast cells, where the basic machinery for repair and recombination activities is well studied, a BRCA2 counterpart is not apparent, suggesting that BRCA2 may serve as a positive regulator for this machinery. How BRCA2 positively participates in these pathways in mammalian cells remains to be resolved. It is also quite possible that BRCA1 and BRCA2 may have important function other than response to DNA damage. The large size of BRCA1 or BRCA2 furnishes ample motifs for interactions with other cellular proteins involved in different cellular function. Nevertheless, our results provide a reasonable rationale of how a loss of BRCA2 function may compromise RAD51-mediated DNA repair systems, thereby destabilizing their genomes and leading to cancerous growth.
