The BRCA2 gene was identified based on its involvement in familial breast 
cancer. The analysis of its sequence predicts that the gene encodes a protein 
with 3,418 amino acids but provides very few clues pointing to its biological 
function. In an attempt to address this question, specific antibodies were 
prepared that identified the gene product of BRCA2 as a 390-kDa nuclear protein. 
Furthermore, direct binding of human RAD51 to each of the four single 30-amino 
acid BRC repeats located at the 5' portion of exon 11 of BRCA2 was demonstrated. 
Such an interaction is significant, as BRCA2 and RAD51 can be reciprocally 
coimmunoprecipitated by each of the individual, specific antibodies and form 
complexes in vivo. Inferring from the function of RAD51 in DNA repair, human 
pancreatic cancer cells, Capan-1, expressing truncated BRCA2 were shown to be 
hypersensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment. Exogenous expression 
of wild-type BRCA2, but not BRC-deleted mutants, in Capan-1 cells confers 
resistance to MMS treatment. These results suggest that the interaction between 
the BRC repeats of BRCA2 and RAD51 is critical for cellular response to DNA 
damage caused by MMS.
