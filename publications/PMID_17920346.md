INTRODUCTION: Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive 
disorder characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and bone marrow 
dysfunction. These result in malabsorption and hematological abnormalities. A 
skeletal dysplasia is also an integral feature of SDS. The present study 
assessed prevalence and determinants of osteopenia and osteoporosis in patients 
with SDS and disease-causing mutations in the SBDS gene.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients (8 males) aged from 5 to 37 years (median 
16.7 years) with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of SDS were assessed for 
fracture history, bone mineral content (BMC), lean tissue mass (LTM) and bone 
mineral density (BMD) (Hologic Discovery A), osteoporotic vertebral changes, and 
for blood biochemistry and hematological parameters. Iliac crest bone biopsies 
were obtained from four patients for histology and histomorphometry.
RESULTS: The main findings were: (1) markedly reduced BMD Z-scores at the lumbar 
spine (median -2.1, range -4.4 to -0.8), proximal femur (median -1.3, range -2.2 
to -0.7) and, whole body (median -1.0, range -2.8 to +0.6), and reduced Z-scores 
for height-adjusted BMC/LTM ratio (median -0.9, range -3.6 to +1.1); (2) 
vertebral compression fractures in three patients; and (3) blood biochemistry 
suggestive of mild vitamin D and vitamin K deficiency. Bone biopsies in four 
patients showed significant low-turnover osteoporosis with reduced trabecular 
bone volume, low numbers of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and reduced amount of 
osteoid.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in addition to the skeletal dysplasia, SDS 
is associated with a more generalized bone disease characterized by low bone 
mass, low bone turnover and by vertebral fragility fractures. Osteoporosis may 
result from a primary defect in bone metabolism, and could be related to the 
bone marrow dysfunction and neutropenia.
