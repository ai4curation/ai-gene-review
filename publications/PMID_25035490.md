The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates many cellular 
functions, but its roles in the nervous system are still poorly understood. We 
found that a newly discovered insulin receptor isoform, DAF-2c, is translocated 
from the cell body to the synaptic region of the chemosensory neuron in 
Caenorhabditis elegans by a conditioning stimulus that induces taste avoidance 
learning. This translocation is essential for learning and is dependent on the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated interaction of CASY-1 (the 
calsyntenin ortholog) and kinesin-1. The PI3K pathway is required downstream of 
the receptor. Light-regulated activation of PI3K in the synaptic region, but not 
in other parts of the cell, switched taste-attractive behavior to taste 
avoidance, mimicking the effect of conditioning. Thus, synaptic PI3K is crucial 
for the behavioral switch caused by learning.
