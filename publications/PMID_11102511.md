Sorting nexin (SNX) 1 and SNX2 are mammalian orthologs of Vps5p, a yeast protein 
that is a subunit of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, 
involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi 
network. We report the cloning and characterization of human orthologs of three 
additional components of the complex: Vps26p, Vps29p, and Vps35p. The close 
structural similarity between the yeast and human proteins suggests a similarity 
in function. We used both yeast two-hybrid assays and expression in mammalian 
cells to define the binding interactions among these proteins. The data suggest 
a model in which hVps35 serves as the core of a multimeric complex by binding 
directly to hVps26, hVps29, and SNX1. Deletional analyses of hVps35 demonstrate 
that amino acid residues 1-53 and 307-796 of hVps35 bind to the coiled 
coil-containing domain of SNX1. In contrast, hVps26 binds to amino acid residues 
1-172 of hVps35, whereas hVps29 binds to amino acid residues 307-796 of hVps35. 
Furthermore, hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 have been found in membrane-associated 
and cytosolic compartments. Gel filtration chromatography of COS7 cell cytosol 
showed that both recombinant and endogenous hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 coelute 
as a large complex ( approximately 220-440 kDa). In the absence of hVps35, 
neither hVps26 nor hVps29 is found in the large complex. These data provide the 
first insights into the binding interactions among subunits of a putative 
mammalian retromer complex.
