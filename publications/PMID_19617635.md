Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) convert long-chain fatty acids to 
acyl-CoAs, the activated substrates essential in various metabolic and signaling 
pathways. Mutations in ACSL4 are associated with non-syndromic X-linked mental 
retardation (MRX). However, the developmental functions of ACSL4 and how it is 
involved in the pathogenesis of MRX remain largely unknown. The Drosophila 
ACSL-like protein is highly homologous to human ACSL3 and ACSL4, and we 
designate it as dAcsl. In this study, we demonstrate that dAcsl and ACSL4 are 
highly conserved in terms of ACSL4's ability to substitute the functions of 
dAcsl in organismal viability, lipid storage and the neural wiring in visual 
center. In neurodevelopment, decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP-like molecule) 
production diminished specifically in the larval brain of dAcsl mutants. 
Consistent with the Dpp reduction, the number of glial cells and neurons 
dramatically decreased and the retinal axons mis-targeted in the visual cortex. 
All these defects in Drosophila brain were rescued by the wild-type ACSL4 but 
not by the mutant products found in MRX patients. Interestingly, expression of 
an MRX-associated ACSL4 mutant form in a wild-type background led to the lesions 
in visual center, suggesting a dominant negative effect. These findings validate 
Drosophila as a model system to reveal the connection between ACSL4 and BMP 
pathway in neurodevelopment, and to infer the pathogenesis of ACSL4-related MRX.
