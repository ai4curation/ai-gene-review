During ascospore formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the secretory pathway is 
reorganized to create new intracellular compartments, termed prospore membranes. 
Prospore membranes engulf the nuclei produced by the meiotic divisions, giving 
rise to individual spores. The shape and growth of prospore membranes are 
constrained by cytoskeletal structures, such as septin proteins, that associate 
with the membranes. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions to various proteins 
that associate with septins at the bud neck during vegetative growth as well as 
to proteins encoded by genes that are transcriptionally induced during 
sporulation were examined for their cellular localization during prospore 
membrane growth. We report localizations for over 100 different GFP fusions, 
including over 30 proteins localized to the prospore membrane compartment. In 
particular, the screen identified IRC10 as a new component of the leading-edge 
protein complex (LEP), a ring structure localized to the lip of the prospore 
membrane. Localization of Irc10 to the leading edge is dependent on SSP1, but 
not ADY3. Loss of IRC10 caused no obvious phenotype, but an ady3 irc10 mutant 
was completely defective in sporulation and displayed prospore membrane 
morphologies similar to those of an ssp1 strain. These results reveal the 
architecture of the LEP and provide insight into the evolution of this 
membrane-organizing complex.
