In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, acquisition of exogenous heme is 
largely mediated by the cell membrane-associated Shu1. Here, we report that 
Str3, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, promotes 
cellular heme import. Using a strain that cannot synthesize heme de novo (hem1Δ) 
and lacks Shu1, we found that the heme-dependent growth deficit of this strain 
is rescued by hemin supplementation in the presence of Str3. Microscopic 
analyses of a hem1Δ shu1Δ str3Δ mutant strain in the presence of the heme analog 
zinc mesoporphyrin IX (ZnMP) revealed that ZnMP fails to accumulate within the 
mutant cells. In contrast, Str3-expressing hem1Δ shu1Δ cells could take up ZnMP 
at a 10-μm concentration. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cannot efficiently 
transport exogenously supplied hemin. However, heterologous expression of Str3 
from S. pombe in S. cerevisiae resulted in ZnMP accumulation within S. 
cerevisiae cells. Moreover, hemin-agarose pulldown assays revealed that Str3 
binds hemin. In contrast, an Str3 mutant in which Tyr and Ser residues of two 
putative heme-binding motifs (530YX3Y534 and 552SX4Y557) had been replaced with 
alanines exhibited a loss of affinity for hemin. Furthermore, this Str3 mutant 
failed to rescue the heme-dependent growth deficit of a hem1Δ shu1Δ str3Δ 
strain. Further analysis by absorbance spectroscopy disclosed that a predicted 
extracellular loop region in Str3 containing the two putative heme-binding 
motifs interacts with hemin, with a KD of 6.6 μm Taken together, these results 
indicate that Str3 is a second cell-surface membrane protein for acquisition of 
exogenous heme in S. pombe.

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, acquisition of exogenous heme is largely mediated by the cell membrane–associated Shu1. Here, we report that Str3, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, promotes cellular heme import. Using a strain that cannot synthesize heme de novo (hem1Δ) and lacks Shu1, we found that the heme-dependent growth deficit of this strain is rescued by hemin supplementation in the presence of Str3. Microscopic analyses of a hem1Δ shu1Δ str3Δ mutant strain in the presence of the heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin IX (ZnMP) revealed that ZnMP fails to accumulate within the mutant cells. In contrast, Str3-expressing hem1Δ shu1Δ cells could take up ZnMP at a 10-μm concentration. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cannot efficiently transport exogenously supplied hemin. However, heterologous expression of Str3 from S. pombe in S. cerevisiae resulted in ZnMP accumulation within S. cerevisiae cells. Moreover, hemin-agarose pulldown assays revealed that Str3 binds hemin. In contrast, an Str3 mutant in which Tyr and Ser residues of two putative heme-binding motifs (530YX3Y534 and 552SX4Y557) had been replaced with alanines exhibited a loss of affinity for hemin. Furthermore, this Str3 mutant failed to rescue the heme-dependent growth deficit of a hem1Δ shu1Δ str3Δ strain. Further analysis by absorbance spectroscopy disclosed that a predicted extracellular loop region in Str3 containing the two putative heme-binding motifs interacts with hemin, with a KD of 6.6 μm. Taken together, these results indicate that Str3 is a second cell-surface membrane protein for acquisition of exogenous heme in S. pombe.
