The proprotein convertase PCSK9 gene is the third locus implicated in familial 
hypercholesterolemia, emphasizing its role in cardiovascular diseases. Loss of 
function mutations and gene disruption of PCSK9 resulted in a higher clearance 
of plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol, likely due to a reduced 
degradation of the liver low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). In this study, 
we show that two of the closest family members to LDLR are also PCSK9 targets. 
These include the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and 
apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) implicated in neuronal development and 
lipid metabolism. Our results show that wild type PCSK9 and more so its natural 
gain of function mutant D374Y can efficiently degrade the LDLR, VLDLR, and 
ApoER2 either following cellular co-expression or re-internalization of secreted 
human PCSK9. Such PCSK9-induced degradation does not require its catalytic 
activity. Membrane-bound PCSK9 chimeras enhanced the intracellular targeting of 
PCSK9 to late endosomes/lysosomes and resulted in a much more efficient 
degradation of the three receptors. We also demonstrate that the activity of 
PCSK9 and its binding affinity on VLDLR and ApoER2 does not depend on the 
presence of LDLR. Finally, in situ hybridization show close localization of 
PCSK9 mRNA expression to that of VLDLR in mouse postnatal day 1 cerebellum. 
Thus, this study demonstrates a more general effect of PCSK9 on the degradation 
of the LDLR family that emphasizes its major role in cholesterol and lipid 
homeostasis as well as brain development.
