SVEP1 is a recently identified multidomain cell adhesion protein, homologous to 
the mouse polydom protein, which has been shown to mediate cell-cell adhesion in 
an integrin-dependent manner in osteogenic cells. In this study, we 
characterized SVEP1 function in the epidermis. SVEP1 was found by qRT-PCR to be 
ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, including the skin. Confocal microscopy 
revealed that SVEP1 is normally mostly expressed in the cytoplasm of basal and 
suprabasal epidermal cells. Downregulation of SVEP1 expression in primary 
keratinocytes resulted in decreased expression of major epidermal 
differentiation markers. Similarly, SVEP1 downregulation was associated with 
disturbed differentiation and marked epidermal acanthosis in three-dimensional 
skin equivalents. In contrast, the dispase assay failed to demonstrate 
significant differences in adhesion between keratinocytes expressing normal vs 
low levels of SVEP1. Homozygous Svep1 knockout mice were embryonic lethal. Thus, 
to assess the importance of SVEP1 for normal skin homoeostasis in vivo, we 
downregulated SVEP1 in zebrafish embryos with a Svep1-specific splice 
morpholino. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a rugged epidermis with 
perturbed microridge formation in the centre of the keratinocytes of morphant 
larvae. Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated abnormal 
epidermal cell-cell adhesion with disadhesion between cells in Svep1-deficient 
morphant larvae compared to controls. In summary, our results indicate that 
SVEP1 plays a critical role during epidermal differentiation.
