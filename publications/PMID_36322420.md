Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs) represent the main subunits 
of the spliceosome. While the assembly of the snRNP core particles has been well 
characterized, comparably little is known of the incorporation of snRNP-specific 
proteins and the mechanisms of snRNP recycling. U5 snRNP assembly in yeast 
requires binding of the the Aar2 protein to Prp8p as a placeholder to preclude 
premature assembly of the SNRNP200 helicase, but the role of the human AAR2 
homolog has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, a crystal structure of 
human AAR2 in complex with the RNase H-like domain of the U5-specific PRPF8 
(PRP8F RH) is reported, revealing a significantly different interaction between 
the two proteins compared with that in yeast. Based on the structure of the 
AAR2-PRPF8 RH complex, the importance of the interacting regions and residues 
was probed and AAR2 variants were designed that failed to stably bind PRPF8 in 
vitro. Protein-interaction studies of AAR2 with U5 proteins using size-exclusion 
chromatography reveal similarities and marked differences in the interaction 
patterns compared with yeast Aar2p and imply phosphorylation-dependent 
regulation of AAR2 reminiscent of that in yeast. It is found that in vitro AAR2 
seems to lock PRPF8 RH in a conformation that is only compatible with the first 
transesterification step of the splicing reaction and blocks a conformational 
switch to the step 2-like, Mg2+-coordinated conformation that is likely during 
U5 snRNP biogenesis. These findings extend the picture of AAR2 PRP8 interaction 
from yeast to humans and indicate a function for AAR2 in the spliceosomal 
assembly process beyond its role as an SNRNP200 placeholder in yeast.
