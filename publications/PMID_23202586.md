Ribosome-associated chaperones act in early folding events during protein 
synthesis. Structural information is available for prokaryotic chaperones (such 
as trigger factor), but structural understanding of these processes in 
eukaryotes lags far behind. Here we present structural analyses of the 
eukaryotic ribosome-associated complex (RAC) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 
Chaetomium thermophilum, consisting of heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) Ssz1 and 
the Hsp40 Zuo1. RAC is an elongated complex that crouches over the ribosomal 
tunnel exit and seems to be stabilized in a distinct conformation by expansion 
segment ES27. A unique α-helical domain in Zuo1 mediates ribosome interaction of 
RAC near the ribosomal proteins L22e and L31e and ribosomal RNA helix H59. The 
crystal structure of the Ssz1 ATPase domain bound to ATP-Mg²⁺ explains its 
catalytic inactivity and suggests that Ssz1 may act before the RAC-associated 
chaperone Ssb. Our study offers insights into the interplay between RAC, the ER 
membrane-integrated Hsp40-type protein ERj1 and the signal-recognition particle.
