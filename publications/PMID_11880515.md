Transgenic mice expressing mutant amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) have 
provided important new information about the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) histopathology. However, the molecular basis of memory loss in these mice 
is poorly understood. One of the major impediments has been the difficulty of 
distinguishing between age-dependent and age-independent behavioral changes. To 
address this issue we studied in parallel two lines of APP transgenic mice 
expressing comparable levels of mutant and wild-type human APP. This enabled us 
to identify age-independent behavioral deficits that were not specifically 
related to mutant APP expression. When mice with age-independent deficits were 
eliminated, we detected memory loss in transgenic mice expressing mutant APP 
(Tg2576 mice) starting at approximately 6 months, which coincided with the 
appearance of detergent-insoluble Abeta aggregates (Abeta(insol)). Genetically 
accelerating the formation of Abeta(insol) resulted in an earlier onset of 
memory decline. A facile interpretation of these results, namely that memory 
loss and Abeta(insol) were closely connected, was rejected when we extended our 
analysis to include older mice. No obvious correspondence between memory and 
Abeta(insol) was apparent in a combined group of old and young mice unless the 
mice were stratified by age, whereupon inverse correlations between memory and 
Abeta(insol) became evident. These results suggested that Abeta(insol) is a 
surrogate marker for small assemblies of Abeta that disrupt cognition and occur 
as intermediates during Abeta(insol) formation, and they are the first 
descriptive in vivo data supporting their role in impairing memory. These 
studies also provide a methodological framework within which to investigate 
these Abeta assemblies in vivo.
