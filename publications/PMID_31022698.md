Intestinal epithelial cells form a physical barrier that is tightly regulated to 
control intestinal permeability. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, 
increase epithelial permeability through disruption of epithelial junctions. The 
regulation of the epithelial barrier in inflammatory gastrointestinal disease 
remains to be fully characterized. In this article, we show that the human 
inflammatory bowel disease genetic susceptibility gene C1ORF106 plays a key role 
in regulating gut epithelial permeability. C1ORF106 directly interacts with 
cytohesins to maintain functional epithelial cell junctions. C1orf106-deficient 
mice are hypersensitive to TNF-α-induced increase in epithelial permeability, 
and this is associated with increased diarrhea. This study identifies C1ORF106 
as an epithelial cell junction protein, and the loss of C1ORF106 augments 
TNF-α-induced intestinal epithelial leakage and diarrhea that may play a 
critical role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease.
