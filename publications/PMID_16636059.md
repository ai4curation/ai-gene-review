A subtle but chronic alteration in metabolic balance between amyloid-beta 
peptide (Abeta) anabolic and catabolic activities is thought to cause Abeta 
accumulation, leading to a decade-long pathological cascade of Alzheimer 
disease. However, it is still unclear whether a reduction of the catabolic 
activity of Abeta in the brain causes neuronal dysfunction in vivo. In the 
present study, to clarify a possible connection between a reduction in 
neprilysin activity and impairment of synaptic and cognitive functions, we 
cross-bred amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (APP23) with 
neprilysin-deficient mice and biochemically and immunoelectron-microscopically 
analyzed Abeta accumulation in the brain. We also examined hippocampal synaptic 
plasticity using an in vivo recording technique and cognitive function using a 
battery of learning and memory behavior tests, including Y-maze, novel-object 
recognition, Morris water maze, and contextual fear conditioning tests at the 
age of 13-16 weeks. We present direct experimental evidence that reduced 
activity of neprilysin, the major Abeta-degrading enzyme, in the brain elevates 
oligomeric forms of Abeta at the synapses and leads to impaired hippocampal 
synaptic plasticity and cognitive function before the appearance of amyloid 
plaque load. Thus, reduced neprilysin activity appears to be a causative event 
that is at least partly responsible for the memory-associated symptoms of 
Alzheimer disease. This supports the idea that a strategy to reduce Abeta 
oligomers in the brain by up-regulating neprilysin activity would contribute to 
alleviation of these symptoms.
