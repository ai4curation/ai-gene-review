We provide unprecedented genetic and biochemical evidence that the antiapoptotic 
transcription factor STAT3 serves as a substrate for SYK tyrosine kinase both in 
vitro and in vivo. Induction of SYK in an ecdysone-inducible mammalian 
expression system results in STAT3 activation, as documented by tyrosine 
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, as well as amplified 
expression of several STAT3 target genes. STAT3 activation after oxidative 
stress (OS) is strongly diminished in DT40 chicken B-lineage lymphoma cells 
rendered SYK-deficient by targeted disruption of the syk gene. Introduction of a 
wild-type, C-terminal or N-terminal SH2 domain-mutated, but not a kinase 
domain-mutated, syk gene into SYK-deficient DT40 cells restores OS-induced 
enhancement of STAT-3 activity. Thus, SYK plays an important and indispensable 
role in OS-induced STAT3 activation and its catalytic SH1 domain is critical for 
this previously unknown regulatory function. These results provide evidence for 
the existence of a novel mode of cytokine-independent cross-talk that operates 
between SYK and STAT3 pathways and regulates apoptosis during OS. We further 
provide experimental evidence that SYK is capable of associating with and 
phosphorylating STAT3 in human B-lineage leukemia/lymphoma cells challenged with 
OS. In agreement with a prerequisite role of SYK in OS-induced STAT3 activation, 
OS does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in SYK-deficient human proB 
leukemia cells. Notably, inhibition of SYK with a small molecule drug candidate 
prevents OS-induced activation of STAT3 and overcomes the resistance of human 
B-lineage leukemia/lymphoma cells to OS-induced apoptosis.

Abstract

We provide unprecedented genetic and biochemical evidence that the antiapoptotic transcription factor STAT3 serves as a substrate for SYK tyrosine kinase both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of SYK in an ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system results in STAT3 activation, as documented by tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, as well as amplified expression of several STAT3 target genes. STAT3 activation after oxidative stress (OS) is strongly diminished in DT40 chicken B-lineage lymphoma cells rendered SYK-deficient by targeted disruption of the syk gene. Introduction of a wild-type, C-terminal or N-terminal SH2 domain-mutated, but not a kinase domain-mutated, syk gene into SYK-deficient DT40 cells restores OS-induced enhancement of STAT-3 activity. Thus, SYK plays an important and indispensable role in OS-induced STAT3 activation and its catalytic SH1 domain is critical for this previously unknown regulatory function. These results provide evidence for the existence of a novel mode of cytokine-independent cross-talk that operates between SYK and STAT3 pathways and regulates apoptosis during OS. We further provide experimental evidence that SYK is capable of associating with and phosphorylating STAT3 in human B-lineage leukemia/lymphoma cells challenged with OS.
