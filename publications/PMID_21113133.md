Cullin 4 (Cul4)-based ubiquitin ligases emerged as critical regulators of DNA 
replication and repair. Over 50 Cul4-specific adaptors (DNA damage-binding 1 
(Ddb1)-Cul4-associated factors; DCAFs) have been identified and are thought to 
assemble functionally distinct Cul4 complexes. Using a live-cell imaging-based 
RNAi screen, we analysed the function of DCAFs and Cul4-linked proteins, and 
identified specific subsets required for progression through G1 and S phase. We 
discovered C6orf167/Mms22-like protein (Mms22L) as a putative human orthologue 
of budding yeast Mms22, which, together with cullin Rtt101, regulates genome 
stability by promoting DNA replication through natural pause sites and damaged 
templates. Loss of Mms22L function in human cells results in S phase-dependent 
genomic instability characterised by spontaneous double-strand breaks and DNA 
damage checkpoint activation. Unlike yeast Mms22, human Mms22L does not stably 
bind to Cul4, but is degraded in a Cul4-dependent manner and upon replication 
stress. Mms22L physically and functionally interacts with the scaffold-like 
protein Nfkbil2 that co-purifies with histones, several chromatin remodelling 
and DNA replication/repair factors. Together, our results strongly suggest that 
the Mms22L-Nfkbil2 complex contributes to genome stability by regulating the 
chromatin state at stalled replication forks.
