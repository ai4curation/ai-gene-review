The influence of caloric restriction (CR) from 2 months of age on the activities 
of liver glycolytic enzymes and metabolite levels was studied in young and old 
mice. Livers were sampled 48 h after the last scheduled feeding time. Old mice 
on CR showed significant decreases in the activities of all the enzymes studied, 
except for aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase and phosphoglycerate mutase, 
which were unchanged. The metabolites glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, 
fructose-6-phosphate, pyruvate and lactate were lower while 
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone 
phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate were increased in old CR. 
Young mice on CR also showed reduced enzyme activities, except for aldolase, 
triosephosphate isomerase and enolase which were unchanged when compared with 
young controls. The metabolites glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, 
fructose-6-phosphate and pyruvate were decreased when compared with young 
controls, while phosphoenolpyruvate was increased. Ketone bodies increased (65%) 
in old, but not young, CR mice while fructose-2,6-bisphosphate decreased in both 
young (22%) and old CR (28%) mice. The results indicate that decreased hepatic 
glucose levels in CR mice are associated with decreased enzyme activities but 
not a uniform decrease in metabolite levels. Increased ketone body levels 
indicate increased utilization of non-carbohydrate fuels while decreased 
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level suggests its importance in the control of 
glycolysis in CR.
