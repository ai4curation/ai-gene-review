The human POZ domain and Krüppel-like zinc finger (POK) family proteins play 
important roles in the regulation of apoptosis, cell proliferation, 
differentiation, development, oncogenesis, and tumor suppression. A novel POK 
family transcription factor, BTB/POZ and zinc finger domains factor on 
chromosome 1 (BOZF-1; also called ZBTB8A), contains a POZ domain and two 
C2H2-type Krüppel-like zinc fingers and is localized at nuclear speckles. 
Compared with paired normal tissues, BOZF1 expression is increased in cancer 
tissues of the prostate, breast, and cervix. BOZF1 repressed the transcription 
of p21WAF/CDKN1A by acting on the proximal promoter concentrated with 
Sp1-binding GC boxes. BOZF1 competed with Sp1 in binding to GC boxes 1-5/6 of 
the CDKN1A proximal promoter. In addition, BOZF1 interacted with p53 and 
decreased the acetylation of p53 by p300, which reduced the DNA binding activity 
of p53 at the far distal p53-binding element. BOZF1 blocked the two major 
molecular events that are important in both constitutive and inducible 
transcription activation of CDKN1A. BOZF1 is unique in that it bound to all the 
proximal GC boxes to repress transcription, and it inhibited p53 acetylation 
without affecting p53 stability. BOZF1 might be a novel proto-oncoprotein that 
stimulates cell proliferation.

Introduction

The POZ 2 domain and Krüppel-like zinc finger (POK) proteins play critical roles in apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell cycle regulation, development, tumor suppression, and oncogenesis ( 1 , 2 ). The POK transcription factors that have been relatively well characterized include BCL6 ( 3 , 4 ), promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger ( 5 , 6 ), leukemia/lymphoma-related factor/FBI-1 ( 7 – 9 ), hypermethylated in cancer 1 ( 10 , 11 ), and Myc-interacting zinc finger 1 (MIZ-1) ( 12 – 14 ). Some of the novel POK proteins have been reported as transcription regulators of the genes that control the cell cycle. BCL6 interacts with MIZ-1 to repress CDKN1A transcription and increases cell cycle progression in germinal center B cells ( 14 ). Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and suppresses cell growth through the expression of cyclin A ( 15 ). The proto-oncogene FBI-1 (also called Pokemon; ZBTB7A) is a specific transcription repressor of human CDKN2A , which encodes tumor suppressor alternate reading frame (ARF) and CDKN1A ( 9 , 16 ). ZBTB4 suppresses cell cycle arrest through the regulation of p21 expression ( 17 ).

Under DNA damaging conditions, progression of the cell cycle can be controlled by the genes of the p53 pathway ( ARF-Mdm2-TP53-CDKN1A ) ( 18 , 19 ). DNA damaging signals induce p53 expression, which serves as the “guardian of the genome” through the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis depending on the DNA damage level. As a tumor suppressor, p53 protects the cell from DNA damage, abnormal cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and the loss of survival factors. The inactivation or loss of function of p53 could lead to oncogenesis ( 20 , 21 ).

p53 controls the expression of a number of downstream target genes to determine cell fate, and depending on the posttranslational modification of p53, a particular subset of genes is expressed to perform specific functions related to cell fate ( 22 , 23 ). One of the important regulators of the cell cycle and a downstream target of p53 is CDKN1A , which encodes p21. The expression of p21 is induced by p53 ( 24 – 26 ). p21 is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-CDK2 or -CDK4 complexes and thus functions as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression ( 26 – 29 ).

In addition to inducible p53, Sp1 transcription factor activates CDKN1A transcription through binding at the six Sp1-binding elements (GC boxes 1–6) and plays an important role in the basal expression of p21 ( 30 , 31 ). The interaction between p53 bound at the distal p53-binding elements and Sp1 bound at GC box 3 synergistically activates CDKN1A transcription. Mutations in GC box 3 greatly affect not only the basal transcription of the CDKN1A promoter but also the synergistic transcription activation by p53 and Sp1, suggesting the importance of the element ( 32 ).

Stress signals activate various protein kinases (ATM and ATR) and acetyltransferases (p300, PCAF, and Tip60), which phosphorylate and acetylate p53, respectively ( 33 – 37 ). The posttranslational modification of p53 results in the stabilization and/or activation of p53 in the nucleus. Modified p53 binds to the DNA elements of target genes and regulates diverse cellular responses, such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair. For example, the acetylation of p53 at Lys-373 and Lys-382 increases the stability, site-specific DNA binding, and p53 target gene expression ( e.g. CDKN1A ) ( 38 , 39 ). The PCAF-mediated acetylation of p53 at Lys-320 is induced through DNA damage and results in the inhibition of apoptosis ( 40 ). Deacetylases (SIRT1 and histone deacetylases) and ubiquitinases have also been shown to affect p53 stability ( 41 , 42 ).

BOZF1 is an uncharacterized member of the POK family transcription factors. BOZF1 mRNA encodes polypeptides composed of 441 amino acids and containing a POZ domain at the N terminus and two Krüppel-like zinc fingers at the C terminus. The gene located at chromosome 1p35.1 is 67 kb in size and is composed of five exons and four introns. BOZF1 is highly expressed in cancer tissues of the prostate, breast, cervix, etc. We found that BOZF1 increased cell proliferation by repressing CDKN1A expression through a molecular mechanism that involved the inhibition of p53 and Sp1 activity.

DISCUSSION

Some POK family proteins have been shown to be important in cell differentiation, development, and oncogenesis. In this study, we characterized a novel member of the human POK family proteins, BOZF1. BOZF1 is abundantly expressed in many types of tumor tissues, such as breast, prostate, and cervix ( supplemental Fig. 4 ). BOZF1 stimulates cell proliferation. Biochemical analyses showed that BOZF1 appears to be a mammalian oncogenic transcription factor. We investigated the function of BOZF1 in the control of cell proliferation with particular interest in the molecular mechanism involved in the transcriptional regulation of CDKN1A , which encodes a major negative cell cycle regulator, p21. BOZF1 stimulated cell proliferation by repressing p21 expression at the transcriptional level. The transcriptional repression involved molecular interactions with p53, the inhibition of p53 DNA binding activity, and DNA binding competition with Sp1 at the proximal promoter. BOZF1 bound to the six Sp1-binding GC boxes of the proximal promoter, but it did not directly bind to the distal p53-binding elements. BOZF1 repressed transcription of the endogenous CDKN1A by interfering with Sp1 binding to the proximal promoter region containing all of the Sp1-binding GC boxes ( Fig. 7 , hypothetical model).

The molecular interaction between p53 and BOZF1 resulted in the inhibition of p53 acetylation, decreased p53 DNA binding activity at the distal p53RE-1 site but not at p53RE-2. Intriguingly, the inhibition of acetylation did not affect p53 stability but appeared to affect DNA binding activity at p53RE-1. These data are consistent with a report by Luo et al. ( 38 ) indicating that acetylated p53 binds more efficiently to the p53RE-1 site.

The transcription of CDKN1A is activated through p53 and Sp1 actions at the distal and proximal elements, respectively. The protein interaction between proximal promoter-bound Sp1 and distal p53 is important in the transcriptional activation of the CDKN1A ( 32 ). Apparently, BOZF1 represses CDKN1A gene transcription through decreased Sp1 binding at the proximal promoter by binding competition at the proximal GC boxes and through inhibition of the DNA binding activity of p53 without affecting p53 stability.

Previously, we have shown that FBI-1 (ZBTB7A), ZBTB2, ZBTB5, Kr-pok, and MIZ-1 also regulate the transcription of CDKN1A ( 16 , 43 – 46 ). FBI-1, ZBTB2, and ZBTB5 interact with Sp1 and compete with Sp1 for binding to the GC boxes of the proximal promoter. Interestingly, each POK protein has a preference for binding to a specific GC box(es ) ( e.g. FBI-1, GC box 3; ZBTB2, GC boxes 5/6; ZBTB5, GC boxes 5/6; Kr-pok, GC boxes 1 and 3; MIZ-1, GC boxes 3 and 5/6). In contrast, BOZF1 bound to all of the GC boxes, covering the entire proximal promoter. By competing with Sp1, BOZF1 could exclude Sp1 family transcription factors at this region. Unlike other POK proteins, such as ZBTB2 and ZBTB5, BOZF1 did not interact with Sp1 ( 43 , 46 ).

At the distal p53 binding regions, FBI-1, ZBTB2, and ZBTB5 inhibit p53 activity by DNA binding competition with p53 at the p53RE-1 and/or -2 sites with preference for the p53RE-1 site ( 16 , 43 , 46 ). In the case of Kr-pok, the inhibition of p53 activity occurs by a different mechanism. Kr-pok does not significantly bind to the p53REs. Instead, it interacts with p53 for recruitment to the p53REs and transcriptional suppression; thus, p53 acts as a docking protein ( 45 ). Uniquely, although BOZF1 showed direct DNA binding activity at the proximal promoter GC boxes, it did not have DNA binding activity on the p53 elements, which represents a different mechanism from the other POK proteins that block transcriptional activation through p53. BOZF1 potently blocked p53 acetylation by PCAF or p300, decreased p53 binding, and inhibited transcriptional activation by p53. In particular, BOZF1 potently blocked acetylation at p53 Lys-320, a site known to be important in transcription activation of CDKN1A ( 40 ).

Accordingly, BOZF1 might play a critical role in regulating important biological processes, such as DNA repair, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, by regulating the expression of p21. BOZF1 could be a novel member of the proto-oncogenic POK family of transcription factors that stimulates cell proliferation with a unique mechanism.
