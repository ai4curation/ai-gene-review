Integrin-mediated adhesion of leukemia cells to extracellular matrix proteins 
reduces apoptosis following radiation-induced genotoxic injury. To evaluate the 
role of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in this process, HL60 human acute 
promyelocytic leukemia cells were stably transfected with ILK wild-type or 
kinase-hyperactive overexpression vectors. Suspension or fibronectin (FN) 
adhesion cultures were irradiated with X-rays and processed for measurement of 
apoptosis, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and caspase activation. 
Adhesion to FN pronouncedly reduced radiation-induced apoptosis of HL60 cells 
and vector controls. Intriguingly, overexpressed ILK enhanced apoptosis after 
irradiation by combined activation of caspase-3 through caspase-8 and -9 in 
irradiated FN cultures. Irradiation of ILK suspension cultures lacked caspase-8 
activation, but showed serial cleavage of caspase-9, -3 and poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerase. These findings further characterize the cell death-promoting 
function of ILK in DNA-damaged cells. Moreover, ILK might represent a potential 
therapeutic target for innovative chemo- and radiooncological approaches in 
hematological malignancies.
