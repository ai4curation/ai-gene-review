The transformation-deficient strain E26, isolated as a pHV60 insertion mutant, 
was used to isolate comK, a novel transcription unit required for genetic 
competence in Bacillus subtilis. Mutational analysis and sequence determination 
showed that comK contained one open reading frame (ORF), which could encode a 
protein of 192 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 22,500. 
An integrated copy of comK not only complemented the competence deficiency of a 
comK deletion mutant, but also that of strains E26 and FB93. Expression of comK 
occurred exclusively in glucose-based minimal medium during the transition to 
stationary growth phase. Furthermore, the expression of late competence genes 
appeared to be dependent on the gene product of comK, the expression of which in 
turn depended on the presence of a functional comL (or srfA) transcription unit. 
These epistatic interactions indicate that comK is a competence locus occupying 
an intermediate position in the competence signal transduction network. Primer 
extension analysis showed that comK has one major transcription start site, 
preceded by a sequence resembling the consensus promoter used by the sigma A 
form of RNA polymerase.
