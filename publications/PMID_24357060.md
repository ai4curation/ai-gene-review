OBJECTIVE: Lipid-laden macrophages or foam cells are characterized by massive 
cytosolic lipid droplet (LD) deposition containing mostly cholesterol ester (CE) 
derived from the lipoproteins cleared from the arterial wall. Cholesterol efflux 
from foam cells is considered to be atheroprotective. Because cholesterol is 
effluxed as free cholesterol, CE accumulation in LDs may limit free cholesterol 
efflux. Our objective was to identify proteins that regulate cholesterol 
trafficking through LDs.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: In a proteomic analysis of the LD fraction of RAW 264.7 
macrophages, we identified an evolutionarily conserved protein with a canonical 
GXSXG lipase catalytic motif and a predicted α/β-hydrolase fold, the RIKEN cDNA 
1110057K04 gene, which we named LD-associated hydrolase (LDAH). LDAH association 
with LDs was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. LDAH was 
labeled with a probe specific for active serine hydrolases. LDAH showed 
relatively weak in vitro CE hydrolase activity. However, cholesterol 
measurements in intact cells supported a significant role of LDAH in CE 
homeostasis because LDAH upregulation and downregulation decreased and 
increased, respectively, intracellular cholesterol and CE in human embryonic 
kidney-293 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Mutation of the putative 
nucleophilic serine impaired active hydrolase probe binding, in vitro CE 
hydrolase activity, and cholesterol-lowering effect in cells, whereas this 
mutant still localized to the LD. LDAH upregulation increased CE hydrolysis and 
cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and, interestingly, LDAH is highly 
expressed in macrophage-rich areas within mouse and human atherosclerotic 
lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: The data identify a candidate target to promote reverse cholesterol 
transport from atherosclerotic lesions.
