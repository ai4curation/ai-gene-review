Molecular partners of hNOT/ALG3, the human counterpart of the Drosophila NOT and 
yeast ALG3 gene, suggest its involvement in distinct cellular processes relevant 
to congenital disorders of glycosylation, cancer, neurodegeneration and a 
variety of further pathologies.

This study provides first insights into the involvement of hNOT/ALG3, the human 
counterpart of the Drosophila Neighbour of TID and yeast ALG3 gene, in various 
putative molecular networks. HNOT/ALG3 encodes two translated transcripts 
encoding precursor proteins differing in their N-terminus and showing 33% 
identity with the yeast asparagine-linked glycosylation 3 (ALG3) protein. 
Experimental evidence for the functional homology of the proteins of fly and man 
in the N-glycosylation has still to be provided. In this study, using the yeast 
two-hybrid technique we identify 17 molecular partners of hNOT-1/ALG3-1. We 
disclose the building of hNOT/ALG3 homodimers and provide experimental evidence 
for its in vivo interaction with the functionally linked proteins OSBP, OSBPL9 
and LRP1, the SYPL1 protein and the transcription factor CREB3. Regarding the 
latter, we show that the 55 kDa N-glycosylated hNOT-1/ALG3-1 molecule binds the 
N-glycosylated CREB3 precursor but does not interact with CREB3's proteolytic 
products specific to the endoplasmic reticulum and to the nucleus. The 
interaction between the two partners is a prerequisite for the proteolytic 
activation of CREB3. In case of the further binding partners, our data suggest 
that hNOT-1/ALG3-1 interacts with both OSBPs and with their direct targets LRP1 
and VAMP/VAP-A. Moreover, our results show that various partners of 
hNOT-1/ALG3-1 interact with its diverse post translationally processed products 
destined to distinct cellular compartments. Generally, our data suggest the 
involvement of hNOT-1/ALG3-1 in various molecular contexts determining essential 
processes associated with distinct cellular machineries and related to various 
pathologies, such as cancer, viral infections, neuronal and immunological 
disorders and CDG.
