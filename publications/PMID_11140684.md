Mice that overexpress the human mutant amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) show 
learning deficits, but the apparent lack of a relationship between these 
deficits and the progressive beta-amyloid plaque formation that the hAPP mice 
display is puzzling. In the water maze, hAPP mice are impaired before and after 
amyloid plaque deposition. Here we show, using a new water-maze training 
protocol, that PDAPP mice also exhibit a separate age-related deficit in 
learning a series of spatial locations. This impairment correlates with 
beta-amyloid plaque burden and is shown in both cross-sectional and longitudinal 
experimental designs. Cued navigation and object-recognition memory are normal. 
These findings indicate that A beta overexpression and/or A beta plaques are 
associated with disturbed cognitive function and, importantly, suggest that some 
but not all forms of learning and memory are suitable behavioural assays of the 
progressive cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's-disease-type 
pathologies.
