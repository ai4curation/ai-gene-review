Tetrameric assembly of channel subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is 
essential for surface expression and function of K+ channels, but the molecular 
mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. In this study, we found 
through genetic screening that ER-located J-domain-containing chaperone proteins 
(J-proteins) are critical for the biogenesis and physiological function of 
ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) K+ channels in both Caenorhabditis elegans and 
human cells. Human J-proteins DNAJB12 and DNAJB14 promoted tetrameric assembly 
of ERG (and Kv4.2) K+ channel subunits through a heat shock protein (HSP) 
70-independent mechanism, whereas a mutated DNAJB12 that did not undergo 
oligomerization itself failed to assemble ERG channel subunits into tetramers 
in vitro and in C. elegans. Overexpressing DNAJB14 significantly rescued the 
defective function of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) mutant channels 
associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS), a condition that predisposes to 
life-threatening arrhythmia, by stabilizing the mutated proteins. Thus, 
chaperone proteins are required for subunit stability and assembly of K+ 
channels.
