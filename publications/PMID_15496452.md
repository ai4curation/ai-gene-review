The eukaryotic nucleolus is involved in ribosome biogenesis and a wide range of 
other RNA metabolism and cellular functions. An important step in the functional 
analysis of the nucleolus is to determine the complement of proteins of this 
nuclear compartment. Here, we describe the first proteomic analysis of plant 
(Arabidopsis thaliana) nucleoli, in which we have identified 217 proteins. This 
allows a direct comparison of the proteomes of an important nuclear structure 
between two widely divergent species: human and Arabidopsis. The comparison 
identified many common proteins, plant-specific proteins, proteins of unknown 
function found in both proteomes, and proteins that were nucleolar in plants but 
nonnucleolar in human. Seventy-two proteins were expressed as GFP fusions and 
87% showed nucleolar or nucleolar-associated localization. In a striking and 
unexpected finding, we have identified six components of the postsplicing 
exon-junction complex (EJC) involved in mRNA export and nonsense-mediated decay 
(NMD)/mRNA surveillance. This association was confirmed by GFP-fusion protein 
localization. These results raise the possibility that in plants, nucleoli may 
have additional functions in mRNA export or surveillance.

Abstract

The eukaryotic nucleolus is involved in ribosome biogenesis and a wide range of other RNA metabolism and cellular functions. An important step in the functional analysis of the nucleolus is to determine the complement of proteins of this nuclear compartment. Here, we describe the first proteomic analysis of plant ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) nucleoli, in which we have identified 217 proteins. This allows a direct comparison of the proteomes of an important nuclear structure between two widely divergent species: human and Arabidopsis. The comparison identified many common proteins, plant-specific proteins, proteins of unknown function found in both proteomes, and proteins that were nucleolar in plants but nonnucleolar in human. Seventy-two proteins were expressed as GFP fusions and 87% showed nucleolar or nucleolar-associated localization. In a striking and unexpected finding, we have identified six components of the postsplicing exon-junction complex (EJC) involved in mRNA export and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)/mRNA surveillance. This association was confirmed by GFP-fusion protein localization. These results raise the possibility that in plants, nucleoli may have additional functions in mRNA export or surveillance.

INTRODUCTION

The eukaryotic nucleus is a complex, highly organized organelle containing a range of domains and nuclear bodies involved in DNA replication and gene expression ( Lamond and Earnshaw, 1998 ). The most prominent nuclear subcompartment is the nucleolus, which is the site of transcription and processing of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and their assembly into ribosomal subunits before export to the cytoplasm ( Olsen et al. , 2000 ; Lafontaine and Tollervey, 2001 ; Fatica and Tollervey, 2002 ; Scheer and Hock, 1999 ). The nucleolus therefore contains the RNA polymerase I transcription machinery and the full range of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) required to modify specific bases and to cleave and process sites in the precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA; Filipowicz and Pogacic, 2002 ; Kiss, 2002 ). It also contains ribosomal proteins (r-proteins), ribosome biogenesis factors required for rRNA folding and the step-wise pathway of ribosome biogenesis, and factors required for the export of the ribosomal subunits through the nuclear pore complex to the cytoplasm ( Fatica and Tollervey, 2002 ).

The nucleolus is also implicated in a wider range of other activities and processes, such as maturation, assembly and export of RNP particles, telomerase activity, the cell cycle, and cell growth and aging ( Lamond and Earnshaw, 1998 ; Pedersen, 1998 ; Cockell and Gasser, 1999 ; Scheer and Hock, 1999 ; Carmo-Fonseca et al. , 2000 ; Olsen et al. , 2000 ; Visintin and Amon, 2000 ; Shaw, 2004 ). Furthermore, it has recently been suggested that the nucleolus acts as a sensor for cellular stress, coordinating the cell's response after nucleolar disruption ( Rubbi and Milner, 2003 ; Horn and Vousden, 2004 ) and thereby highlighting the importance of the nucleolus to the functional integrity of the cell.

Besides the nucleolus, animal nuclei contain a variety of other nuclear bodies or domains including Cajal bodies, gems, speckles, paraspeckles and PML bodies ( Lamond and Earnshaw, 1998 ; Matera, 1999 ; Fox et al. , 2002 ). These nuclear subcompartments are involved in different aspects of transcription, RNA processing, maturation of RNP complexes and particles, and transport of RNAs and RNPs. The nucleolus is often closely associated with Cajal bodies, which function in the maturation and recycling of snRNPs; assembly, processing or trafficking to the nucleolus of snoRNPs; 3′ end processing of some histone mRNAs, and modification of snRNAs by small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs; Sleeman and Lamond, 1999 ; Jady and Kiss, 2001 ; Darzacq et al. , 2002 ; Jady et al. , 2003 ). Nuclear proteins and RNPs are in dynamic interaction with chromatin and the various nuclear bodies and diffuse through the nucleoplasm in interchromatin regions. Accumulation of specific components in different nuclear structures occurs to carry out different functions and the composition of the bodies changes in response to cellular conditions and environmental cues ( Sleeman and Lamond, 1999 ; Phair and Misteli, 2000 ; Chen and Huang, 2001 ; Leung and Lamond, 2002 ; Lamond and Spector, 2003 ).

Although the fundamental processes of ribosome biogenesis are very similar in all eukaryotes, there are significant differences in nucleolar organization between plants and animals, and even between different cell types within a single species. This suggests that there is more to nucleolar organization than making ribosomes; these differences may originate in other aspects of nucleolar function. In animal nucleoli, transcription occurs in the dense fibrillar component (DFC; Koberna et al. , 2002 ), often at the surface of the closely associated fibrillar centers (FC). The early processing of rRNAs occurs in the DFC and ribosomal subunits are assembled in the granular component (GC; Shaw and Jordan, 1995 ; Scheer and Hock, 1999 ; Carmo-Fonseca et al. , 2000 ). In plant nucleoli, the active rDNA transcription units are well dispersed throughout a region of the nucleolus broadly corresponding to the DFC, which constitutes up to 70% of the nucleolar volume in plants and which is surrounded by the GC; association of transcription with FCs is not necessary ( Shaw and Jordan, 1995 ; Gonzalez-Melendi et al., 2001 ). The rDNA transcription units have been imaged in plants as compacted “Christmas Trees” ∼300 nm in length ( Gonzalez-Melendi et al., 2001 ). Recent studies of human HeLa cell nucleoli have reached a similar conclusion that transcription units are in the form of compacted, convoluted structures within the comparatively smaller DFC ( Koberna et al. , 2002 ). The localization of a variety of proteins, rRNA and snoRNA species to subdomains within plant nucleoli correlated well with early and late events in rRNA processing ( Beven et al. , 1996 ). From this, Brown and Shaw ( 1998 ) proposed a “vectorial” model of organization, in which successive biochemical steps in rRNA maturation and ribosome biogenesis occur in concentric layers enveloping the transcription sites. Finally, a distinctive feature of most plant nucleoli is a central region called the nucleolar cavity. Its function is unknown, but time-lapse microscopy has shown the cavity apparently emptying its contents into the nucleoplasm (Gunning, URL: www.plantcellbiologyonCD.com ) and Beven et al. ( 1995 , 1996 ) showed accumulation of snoRNAs and the presence of spliceosomal snRNAs in the nucleolar cavity.

Although many components of the nucleolus and other nuclear bodies have been identified, a full understanding of their functions will require far greater knowledge of their component proteins and other macromolecules, their interactions, and their responses to changes in cellular activity. The availability of complete genome sequences, together with rapid advances in mass spectrometry methods for analyzing complex polypeptide mixtures, means that it is now possible to begin to provide a complete identification of the proteins for cellular organelles or substructures of the size and complexity of the nucleolus ( Rappsilber and Mann, 2002 ; Aebersold and Mann, 2003 ; Taylor et al. , 2003 ). Recent studies have provided proteomic analyses of the human nucleolus ( Andersen et al. , 2002 ; Scherl et al. , 2002 ), leading ultimately to the identification of 692 different proteins (Lamond and Mann, unpublished data).

In plants, progress has been made in determining the proteomes of organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes ( Mo et al. , 2003 ). Here we describe the first proteomic analysis of plant nucleoli. We have carried out a proteomic analysis of the Arabidopsis nucleolus in order 1) to address the function of the nucleolus in plants; 2) to provide tools for identification of other nuclear bodies and to examine nuclear dynamics of proteins in the plant nucleus; and 3) to identify proteins that are common between or specific to plant and human nucleoli. We have identified 217 proteins from purified Arabidopsis nucleoli. Over 70 such proteins have been expressed as GFP fusions in Arabidopsis cells and 87% show labeling of, or associated with, the nucleolus, attesting to the quality of the preparation. The protein profile resembles that from human nucleoli, containing many expected nucleolar and ribosomal proteins, but in addition identifies conserved proteins of unknown function, plant-specific proteins and proteins with different localization between the two organisms. Intriguingly, we have identified a number of proteins known to be part of the postsplicing exon-junction complex (EJC), as nucleolar proteins.

DISCUSSION

On the basis of the high incidence of known or expected nucleolar proteins and the low occurrence of, for example, cytoplasmic or organellar proteins, the Arabidopsis nucleolar preparation used in the analysis is of good purity and quality. Furthermore, the high percentage (87%) of the 72 protein:GFP fusions that showed labeling of nucleoli when expressed in Arabidopsis cells, provides complementary evidence for the overall quality of the original nucleolar preparation. The high throughput method for cloning of GFP fusions makes such verification by localization a feasible adjunct to proteomic analyses. Compared with the most recent proteomic analysis of human nucleoli (Lamond and Mann, unpublished data), it is likely that this proteomic analysis represents only an initial estimate of plant nucleolar protein complexity. For example, only three-quarters of the Arabidopsis ribosomal proteins were detected in this analysis, and only the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I was detected. The most recent human proteomic analysis was carried out using more sensitive mass spectrometric techniques than were available when this proteomic study was performed. We anticipate that we will identify a similar number of plant nucleolar proteins when the most sensitive current methods are applied.

The analyses of the proteome of the human nucleolus have demonstrated the complexity of this nuclear body in terms of the number and nature of protein factors (692 proteins) and further underpins the multitude of functions in which the nucleolus may have a role ( Pedersen, 1998 ; Andersen et al. , 2002 ; Scherl et al. , 2002 ; Leung et al. , 2003 ). Furthermore, the level and localization of subsets of proteins can vary under different conditions (e.g., inhibition of transcription) and in different cell types or cell cycle stages reflecting transient association with the nucleolus or dynamic interactions of components of the nucleolus, with other nuclear bodies and the nucleoplasm ( Andersen et al. , 2002 ). Little is known about nuclear architecture in plant cells, and to date, the best characterized nuclear bodies or domains are the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, and SR protein-containing speckles ( Beven et al. , 1995 ; Shaw and Jordan, 1995 ; Lorkovic et al. , 2004a ). However, other plant proteins involved in RNA metabolism or signaling have been recently shown to accumulate in nuclear speckle-like bodies ( Kircher et al. , 2002 ; Chen et al. , 2003 ; Han et al. , 2004 ; Lorkovic et al. , 2004b ; Shaw and Brown, 2004 ), further demonstrating the expected complexity of plant subnuclear organization. Many of the nucleolar protein fusions analyzed here also labeled nuclear bodies. Although some appear similar to Cajal body-like structures or SR-protein containing speckles, it is possible that they label other novel nuclear domains. Confirmation of the nature of these domains will require colocalization analyses with marker proteins for the known bodies and may lead to the identification of other plant nuclear bodies.

The value of comparative proteomic analyses between widely different species is demonstrated here by the identification of known proteins, which were not expected to be nucleolar but which were either found in both proteomes or associated only with the plant nucleolus, and proteins of unknown function that were either plant-specific or conserved in both plant and animal nucleoli. For example, the presence of many proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing and translation in the Arabidopsis nucleolus confirms the findings of the human nucleolar proteome analyses ( Andersen et al. , 2002 ; Scherl et al. , 2002 ). Although it is not known whether these proteins are associated in RNPs or with mRNAs, the presence of the many snRNP proteins in the Arabidopsis nucleolar proteome, taken with evidence of snRNAs being present in the nucleolar cavity ( Beven et al. , 1995 ), suggests that mature snRNPs exist in the nucleolus.

GAPDH was also detected in both the Arabidopsis and human nucleolar proteomes. Recent evidence has shown that besides its glycolytic activity, GAPDH is a multifunctional protein with both cytoplasmic and nuclear functions, one of which is as an essential component of a transcriptional activator complex regulating mammalian histone H2B expression ( Mazzola and Sirover, 2002 ; Zheng et al. , 2003 ). The dual functionality of cytoplasmic enzymes in the activation or repression of transcription or in modulating splicing or stability of mRNAs illustrates potential links between gene regulation and the metabolic activity of the cell ( Macknight, 2003 ). The finding of GAPDH in the nucleolus of both plants and mammals may reflect one of the functions of the nucleolus in sequestration of regulatory components ( Pedersen, 1998 ; Cockell and Gasser, 1999 ; Olsen et al. , 2000 ; Visintin and Amon, 2000 ).

We showed the presence of two different SAM synthetase proteins in the plant nucleolar preparation, whereas this protein was not detected in the human nucleolar proteome. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of l -methionine and ATP to S -adenosyl- l -methionine, which is a methyl group donor. Even considering the extensive methylation of rRNAs by fibrillarin in the nucleolus, the presence of SAM synthetase is unexpected. However, a recent proteomic analysis of the nuclear matrix of Arabidopsis ( Calikowski et al. , 2003 ) identified 36 proteins of which many were nucleolar (expected because of the integral association of the nucleolar matrix with such preparations) and two were SAM synthetases, one of which (At3g17390) was also present in the nucleolar proteome. Arabidopsis contains five SAM synthetase genes and our results suggest that at least two SAM synthetases are found in the nucleolus, perhaps for rapid production of SAM for rRNA methylation.

Finally, the Arabidopsis nucleolar proteomic analysis has identified an association of six EJC components with the nucleolus, confirmed by GFP localization. In contrast, human and Drosophila EJC proteins localize to the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles but are excluded from the nucleolus ( Kataoka et al. , 2001 ; Le Hir et al. , 2001b ; Custódio et al. , 2004 ; Palacios et al. , 2004 ). In the original published human nucleolar proteome of 271 proteins, the only EJC component to be identified was ALY/Ref ( Andersen et al. , 2002 ). In light of the clear association of plant EJC proteins with the nucleolus, we searched the most up-to-date human nucleolar proteome of 692 proteins and found six EJC components (ALY/Ref, UAP56, Y14, DEK, eIF4A-III, and UPF3X; Lamond and Mann, unpublished data). This suggests that at least some EJC components are also associated with the nucleolus in animal cells even though the animal proteins may be present in much lower concentrations as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy.

The exon junction complex couples transcription, RNA processing and, in particular, splicing, to export and other downstream processes such as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) or mRNA surveillance ( Dreyfuss et al. , 2002 ; Maquat, 2004 ). After splicing, the exon junction complex is deposited around 20-24 nt upstream of the exon:exon junction. The complex contains proteins involved in spliceosome assembly and export adapter proteins, which interact with export receptors to contact the nuclear pore complex and effect mRNP export ( Le Hir et al. , 2001a ; Dreyfuss et al. , 2002 ; Maquat, 2004 ). The EJC also recruits Upf proteins involved in NMD, which degrade mRNAs containing premature stop codons, produced by mutation or by aberrant expression and RNA processing. The selective degradation of such transcripts avoids the production of truncated proteins that could have dominant negative effects and be deleterious to the cell.

NMD is a translation-dependent process and the majority of NMD is nuclear, suggesting a pioneer round of translation of mRNAs bound by the cap-binding complex at the 5′ cap ( Ishigaki et al. , 2001 ; Lejeune et al. , 2002 ). Although the site of nuclear NMD is unknown, current models propose translation by cytoplasmic ribosomes as mRNAs pass through the nuclear pore complex or nuclear translation ( Dreyfuss et al. , 2002 ; Wilkinson and Shyu, 2002 ; Maquat, 2004 ). The human EJC proteins ALY, UAP56, SRm160, RNPS1, Y14, and Magoh have recently been shown in mammalian cells to accumulate at sites of transcription/splicing and they therefore bind pre-mRNAs/mRNAs cotranscriptionally ( Custódio et al. , 2004 ). In contrast, the mRNA export adaptor proteins p15 and TAP are not recruited to these sites and must interact later in the export pathway. Similarly, the presence of nonsense codons does not affect splicing of pre-mRNAs suggesting that nuclear mRNA surveillance is unlikely to occur cotranscriptionally ( Lytle and Steitz, 2004 ).

If the detection of ALY, UAP56, RNPS1, Y14, and Mago in the plant nucleolar preparation reflects the presence of mRNAs bound by EJC complexes, then such mRNPs may be targeted to the nucleolus after release from transcription sites. Therefore, our results suggest that the plant nucleolus functions in storage or assembly of EJC subcomplexes, mRNA export or in NMD. Both human and plant nucleolar proteomes contained a variety of translation initiation and elongation factors (including the EJC component, eIF4A-III, and EF-Tu, a mitochondrial translation elongation factor; Andersen et al. , 2002 ; Scherl et al. , 2002 ; this article; Lamond and Mann, unpublished data). Translation factors were also identified in plant nuclear matrix preparations ( Calikowski et al. , 2003 ). Although the nuclear/nucleolar functions of these proteins are unknown, it is possible that they have multiple and novel functions perhaps related to mRNA surveillance.

A major difference between some of the EJC components of plants and animals is the multigene nature of ALY, DEK, p15, and UAP56 genes. Organization of genes into multigene families reflects the prevalence of hybridization and polyploidy, which has occurred in plant evolution (up to 70% of plant species may have undergone such genome amplification events; Wendel, 2000 ). Duplicated genes may diverge and either generate complementary expression patterns or develop differential functions, ensuring continued selection of both genes. Thus it is possible that some plant EJC homologues are functionally distinct, forming different complexes by specific association with different members of the EJC or other proteins. They may therefore bind or associate with different subsets of mRNAs or in some way identify and target mRNAs for transport to and from the nucleolus, export from the nucleus or NMD. The different localization of all four ALY homologues may reflect such differential activities. Detailed cell biological and biochemical analyses of all Arabidopsis EJC proteins, complexes, and associated mRNAs is required to address these major questions in posttranscriptional gene regulation. Nevertheless, the importance of the comparative proteomics approach between Arabidopsis and human nucleoli is evident from the identification of species-specific proteins, proteins with differential localization, and potentially novel functions for the eukaryotic nucleolus.
