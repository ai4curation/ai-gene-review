The human papillomavirus (HPV) transcription/replication factor E2 is essential 
for the life cycle of HPVs. E2 protein binds to DNA target sequences in the 
viral long control regions to regulate transcription of the viral genome. It 
also enhances viral DNA replication by interacting with the viral replication 
factor E1 and recruiting it to the origin of replication and may also play a 
more direct role in replication. The cellular proteins with which E2 interacts 
to carry out these functions are largely unknown. To identify these proteins a 
yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out with the transcription/replication 
domain of HPV16 E2. This screen identified several candidate interacting 
partners for E2 including TopBP1 (topoisomerase II beta-binding protein 1). 
TopBP1 has eight BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal domains that are found in proteins 
regulating the DNA damage response, transcription, and replication. Here we 
demonstrate that HPV16 E2 and TopBP1 interact in vitro and in vivo and that 
TopBP1 can enhance the ability of E2 to activate transcription and replication. 
This is the first time that TopBP1 has been shown to function as a 
transcriptional coactivator and that E2 interacts with TopBP1. Removal of the 
amino-terminal domain of TopBP1 abolishes coactivation of transcription and 
replication. This interaction may have functional consequences upon the viral 
life cycle.
