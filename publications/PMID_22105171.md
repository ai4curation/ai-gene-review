Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia 
(IBMPFD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive myopathy 
that is often accompanied by bone weakening and/or frontotemporal dementia. 
Although it is known to be caused by mutations in the gene encoding 
valosin-containing protein (VCP), the underlying disease mechanism remains 
elusive. Like IBMPFD, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant 
disorder. Neurofibromin, the protein encoded by the NF1 gene, has been shown to 
regulate synaptogenesis. Here, we show that neurofibromin and VCP interact and 
work together to control the density of dendritic spines. Certain mutations 
identified in IBMPFD and NF1 patients reduced the interaction between VCP and 
neurofibromin and impaired spinogenesis. The functions of neurofibromin and VCP 
in spinogenesis were shown to correlate with the learning disability and 
dementia phenotypes seen in patients with IBMPFD. Consistent with the previous 
finding that treatment with a statin rescues behavioral defects in Nf1(+/-) mice 
and providing further support for our hypothesis that there is crosstalk between 
neurofibromin and VCP, statin exposure neutralized the effect of VCP knockdown 
on spinogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. The data presented here 
demonstrate that there is a link between IBMPFD and NF1 and indicate a role for 
VCP in synapse formation.
