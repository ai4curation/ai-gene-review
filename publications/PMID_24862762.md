Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 regulating factor 1/ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding 
phosphoprotein 50 (NHERF1/EBP50), an adaptor molecule that interacts with the 
ERM-neurofibromatosis type 2 family of cytoskeletal proteins through its 
ERM-binding region and with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and β-catenin 
through its PDZ domains, has been recently implicated in the progression of 
various human malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). We report here 
that NHERF1 controls gland morphogenesis, as demonstrated in three-dimensional 
(3D) human intestinal glands developing from a single nonpolarized cell. 
Starting from the early two-cell developmental stage, NHERF1 concentrates at the 
cellular interface in a central membrane disc that marks the apical pole 
delimiting the forming lumen. NHERF1 depletion leads to severe disruption of the 
apical-basal polarity, with formation of enlarged and distorted cell spheroids 
devoid of a central lumen. This characteristic and the increased number of 
mitoses in NHERF1-depleted spheroids, including multipolar ones, mimic 
high-grade dysplasia lesions observed in CRC progression. NHERF1 ERM-binding or 
PDZ-domain mutants fail to localize apically and impair gland formation most 
likely by outcompeting endogenous ligands, with the latter mutant completely 
aborting gland development. Examination of NHERF1 ligands showed that even if 
both ezrin and moesin colocalized with NHERF1 at the apical membrane, moesin but 
not ezrin depletion disrupted morphogenesis similarly to NHERF1. NHERF1 
depletion resulted also in membrane displacement of PTEN and nuclear 
translocation of β-catenin, events contributing to polarity loss and increased 
proliferation. These findings reveal an essential role of NHERF1 in epithelial 
morphogenesis and polarity and validate this 3D system for modeling the 
molecular changes observed in CRC.

Introduction

Epithelial gland morphogenesis is the process resulting in the establishment of polarized tubular or acinar structures formed by tightly connected cells arranged on a basement membrane that delimit a lumen by their apical surface. The polarized architecture of glandular epithelia allows unidirectional fluid and solute transport, which is the basis for the absorptive and secretory functions. Its alteration leads to epithelial sheet disorganization and development of initially benign glandular tumors, or adenomas, that, on further accumulation of mutations, may become malignant, or adenocarcinomas. Epithelial morphogenesis is initiated by cell adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, followed by organization of the cytoskeleton and differential sorting of proteins to the cortical apical and basolateral compartments [1] . Recently, the compartmentalization of lipids, especially phosphoinosides, was shown to maintain epithelial cell polarity, with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) enriched at the apical membrane and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP 3 ), at the basolateral membrane [2] . PTEN tumor suppressor, a phosphoinositide phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP 3 to PIP 2 [3] and opposes the activity of the phosphoinositol 3-OH kinase, has been implicated in maintaining this balance [4] .

Na + /H + exchanger 3 regulating factor 1/ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)–binding phosphoprotein 50 (NHERF1/EBP50) is an adaptor protein that interacts directly with PTEN [5] and is localized mainly at the apical plasma membrane (PM) in human epithelial tissues [6] . NHERF1 knockout mice have ultrastructural defects of the apical intestinal brush border membrane [7,8] and also show mammary alveolar membrane polarity disruption with lactation deficit [9] . Our mechanistic studies in cultured cells showed that NHERF1 behaves as a tumor and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition suppressor through its effects on PTEN and β-catenin [5,10,11] . We and others have also shown that NHERF1 is involved in a series of human cancers, including adenocarcinomas of colon and breast [6,10,12] . We have now examined the involvement of NHERF1 in three-dimensional (3D) intestinal gland formation in which glands develop from single stem cells. We found that NHERF1 is required for epithelial morphogenesis by interacting with moesin and stabilizing PTEN at the apical membrane. This morphogenetic study provides mechanistic support to our previous observations of NHERF1 loss in human colorectal cancer (CRC) that occurs as an early step in adenoma progression [10] .

Discussion

Accurate experimental modeling of pathologic changes observed in human conditions is a powerful tool for understanding the mechanism of disease and for therapy design. In this study, we modeled the initial NHERF1 molecular changes that we have reported in CRC [10] in a previously described 3D model of human intestinal gland formation [17] , which was also tested by the introduction of K-Ras and B-Raf mutations occurring in a subset of human CRCs [25] . We noted strong correspondence between the pathologic changes occurring in the transformation sequence of CRC from normal-> adenoma -> carcinoma and the alteration by NHERF1 loss of the normal gland morphology toward tumorlike 3D structures characterized by enhanced and disorganized growth ( Figure 6 ). These 3D spheroids share similar morphologic changes with colonic-epithelium adenomatous growth, characterized by crowded cells showing enlarged nuclei and increased number of mitoses, some of which are atypical. High-grade dysplasia, a feature of progression from adenoma to carcinoma characterized by cribriform architecture and total loss of polarity has correspondent changes in the formation of aborted lumina and polarity loss in NHERF1-depleted spheroids. A break of the basement membrane with invasion of neoplastic cells through muscularis mucosae characterizes adenocarcinoma. A detached or absent basement membrane in NHERF1-depleted spheroids, sometimes with cells budding off the main structure, may mimic initial phases of invasion (see Figure 2 ). The 3D changes induced by NHERF1 loss are best consistent with high-grade dysplasia, also called carcinoma in situ , and functionally implicate NHERF1 in CRC progression.

The mechanism by which NHERF1 controls cell polarity is related to its correct apical PM localization. NHERF1 is localized at the apical PM in both normal intestine surface epithelium and glands. As previously observed in polarized opossum kidney cells, disruption of the ERM-binding region redirects NHERF1 to the cytoplasm [14,26] . Expression of this ERM-binding deficient mutant with altered subcellular compartmentalization is sufficient to prevent Caco-2 gland morphogenesis with central lumen formation. These observations suggest that apically localized NHERF1 is required to maintain cell polarity, including the apical localization of ERM proteins, and that it is the interaction with ERM proteins that properly localizes NHERF1 at the apical PM. In contrast to knockout mice, where ezrin is the ERM protein involved in proper organization of the apical intestinal brush border membrane similarly to NHERF1 [8,27] , specific ezrin knockdown in the human Caco-2 gland model had no effect on gland morphogenesis. This may be explained by a compensatory interaction of NHERF1 with moesin, which also colocalized apically with NHERF1 in 3D glands. Surprisingly, moesin knockdown disrupted gland morphogenesis similarly to NHERF1. Depletion of another ERM family member, neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), was shown to promote formation of Caco-2 3D glands with multiple lumens [28] . Interestingly, NF2 or Drosophila moesin knockdowns were also shown to alter spindle morphogenesis during mitosis, leading to chromosomal misalignment and multipolar mitoses [28–30] . Most likely, the membrane destabilization of ERM-NF2 proteins in NHERF1-depleted spheroids leads to defective cortical rigidity and spindle positioning during mitosis, with multipolar spindle formation. ERM proteins have high sequence similarity and functional redundancy, but nonredundant functions are being investigated [31] . They have been found differentially overexpressed or sometimes downregulated in various cancers [15,32] . Interestingly, moesin was found overexpressed in CRC compared to normal mucosa, and ezrin was found overexpressed in metastatic CRC compared to primary tumors [33,34] . More studies are therefore warranted to characterize the individual ERM protein expression and function in the CRC transformation sequence, as well as in relationship to NHERF1.

An important step in gland morphogenesis also involves the PDZ domain interactions of NHERF1. Of NHERF1's PDZ-domain ligands, PTEN has been shown to maintain high PIP 2 levels at the apical PM, which are critical for apical-basal polarity in Drosophila photoreceptor epithelial cells and MDCK cell cysts [2,4,35] . Recently, PTEN knockdown has also been shown to disrupt Caco-2 3D gland morphogenesis [36] . However, how PTEN localizes at the apical PM remained unknown. A polarized distribution of PTEN was initially observed in migratory single cells of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum where PTEN and phosphoinositol 3-OH kinase were shown to occupy distinct PM compartments during chemotaxis [37,38] . Similar to MDCK cells, PTEN was required to maintain phosphoinositide partition in Dictyostelium during chemotaxis, and the PIP 2 -binding motif from PTEN N terminus was required for its PM localization [39] . Mutations in this motif were shown not only to disrupt PM binding but also to inactivate PTEN's tumor suppressor function in nonpolarized tumor cells [40–42] . In Drosphila epithelial cells, PTEN interaction and colocalization with Bazooka/Par-3 at the developing apically situated cell-cell junctions were described [35,43] . We show here that the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which is dispensable for PTEN's growth-suppressive function in nonpolarized tumor cells [16] , provides the specialized signal for apical PM localization in polarized epithelial cells. NHERF1 stabilizes PTEN apically through PDZ-domain interactions [5] , and NHERF1 loss leads to PTEN cytosolic redistribution. This change will, in turn, alter the distribution of PIP 2 and contribute to the more severe apical-basal polarity disruption. Of note is that ERM proteins interact with PIP 2 [44] and they are required for relaxing the “closed” conformation of NHERF1, allowing interaction with PTEN [14] . We conclude that the disruption of epithelial morphogenesis seen after NHERF1 depletion or apical displacement is a consequence of dissociation of NHERF1 complexes with both PTEN and the ERM proteins from the apical PM, leading to polarity loss.
