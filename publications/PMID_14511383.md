Testican-1, a secreted proteoglycan enriched in brain, has a single thyropin 
domain that is highly homologous to domains previously shown to inhibit cysteine 
proteases. We demonstrate that purified recombinant human testican-1 is a strong 
competitive inhibitor of the lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin L, with a Ki 
of 0.7 nM, but it does not inhibit the structurally related lysosomal cysteine 
protease cathepsin B. Testican-1 inhibition of cathepsin L is independent of its 
chondroitin sulfate chains and is effective at both pH 5.5 and 7.2. At neutral 
pH, testican-1 also stabilizes cathepsin L, slowing pH-induced denaturation and 
allowing the protease to remain active longer, although the rate of proteolysis 
is reduced. These data indicate that testican-1 is capable of modulating 
cathepsin L activity both in intracellular vesicles and in the extracellular 
milieu.
