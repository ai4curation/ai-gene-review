OBJECTIVES: The PCSK9 gene, encoding a pro-protein convertase involved in 
posttranslational degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptor, has emerged 
as a key regulator of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In 
African-Americans two nonsense mutations resulting in loss of function of PCSK9 
are associated with a 30% to 40% reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol. The aim of this study was to assess whether loss of function 
mutations of PCSK9 were a cause of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and a 
determinant of low-plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in whites.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced PCSK9 gene in 18 familial 
hypobetalipoproteinemia subjects and in 102 hypocholesterolemic blood donors who 
were negative for APOB gene mutations known to cause familial 
hypobetalipoproteinemia. The PCSK9 gene variants found in these 2 groups were 
screened in 42 subjects in the lowest (<5th) percentile, 44 in the highest 
(>95th) percentile, and 100 with the average plasma cholesterol derived from 
general population. In one familial hypobetalipoproteinemia kindred and in 2 
hypocholesterolemic blood donors we found a novel PCSK9 mutation in exon 1 
(c.202delG) resulting in a truncated peptide (Ala68fsLeu82X). Two familial 
hypobetalipoproteinemia subjects and 4 hypocholesterolemic blood donors were 
carriers of the R46L substitution previously reported to be associated with 
reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as other rare amino acid 
changes (T77I, V114A, A522T and P616L) not found in the other groups examined.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a novel inactivating mutation as well as some rare 
nonconservative amino acid substitutions of PCSK9 in white hypocholesterolemic 
individuals.
