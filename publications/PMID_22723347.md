Activation of p53 upon DNA damage induces an array of target genes, leading to 
cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which the cell 
fate is controlled by p53 remains to be clarified. Previously, we showed that 
DEC1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and a target of p53, is 
capable of inducing cell cycle arrest and mediating DNA damage-induced premature 
senescence. Here, we found that ectopic expression of DEC1 inhibits, whereas 
knockdown of DEC1 enhances, DNA damage-induced cell death. Surprisingly, we 
showed that the anti-cell-death activity of DEC1 is p53 dependent, but DEC1 does 
not directly modulate p53 expression. Instead, we showed that DEC1 inhibits the 
ability of p53 to induce macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), but not other 
prosurvival/proapoptotic targets, including p21 and Puma. Importantly, we showed 
that upon binding to their respective response elements on the MIC-1 promoter, 
DEC1 and p53 physically interact on the MIC-1 promoter via the basic 
helix-loop-helix domain in DEC1 and the tetramerization domain in p53, which 
likely weakens the DNA-binding activity of p53 to the MIC-1 promoter. Finally, 
we found that depletion of MIC-1 abrogates the ability of DEC1 to attenuate DNA 
damage-induced cell death. Together, we hypothesize that DEC1 controls the 
response of p53-dependent cell survival vs. cell death to a stress signal 
through MIC-1.

Abstract

Activation of p53 upon DNA damage induces an array of target genes, leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which the cell fate is controlled by p53 remains to be clarified. Previously, we showed that DEC1, a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor and a target of p53, is capable of inducing cell cycle arrest and mediating DNA damage-induced premature senescence. Here, we found that ectopic expression of DEC1 inhibits, whereas knockdown of DEC1 enhances, DNA damage-induced cell death. Surprisingly, we showed that the anti–cell-death activity of DEC1 is p53 dependent, but DEC1 does not directly modulate p53 expression. Instead, we showed that DEC1 inhibits the ability of p53 to induce macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), but not other prosurvival/proapoptotic targets, including p21 and Puma. Importantly, we showed that upon binding to their respective response elements on the MIC-1 promoter, DEC1 and p53 physically interact on the MIC-1 promoter via the basic helix–loop–helix domain in DEC1 and the tetramerization domain in p53, which likely weakens the DNA-binding activity of p53 to the MIC-1 promoter. Finally, we found that depletion of MIC-1 abrogates the ability of DEC1 to attenuate DNA damage-induced cell death. Together, we hypothesize that DEC1 controls the response of p53-dependent cell survival vs. cell death to a stress signal through MIC-1.

Discussion

We previously showed that DEC1, a target of p53, mediates G1 arrest and premature senescence in p53- and p21-independent manners ( 16 ). In this study, we showed that DEC1 inhibits DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, we showed that DEC1 attenuates p53 induction of MIC-1, but not other apoptotic target genes (Puma, FDXR, and PolH), p21, GADD45α, and Mdm2. Moreover, we showed that similar to p53-KD ( Fig. 2 B and Fig. S3 A–C ), depletion of MIC-1 abrogates the ability of DEC1 to suppress DNA damage-induced cell death ( Fig. 5 and Fig. S8 ). It is well established that in response to DNA damage, p53 is activated and then induces an array of target genes, including DEC1 for inducing cell cycle arrest and senescence, and MIC-1 for inducing apoptosis. However, a number of known and unknown factors, including the cellular context and the type of a stress signal, would dictate the response of a cell to choose p53-dependent cell survival vs. cell death. Here, we hypothesize that DEC1 suppresses p53 induction of MIC-1 and thus controls the response of a cell to p53-dependent cell survival vs. cell death to a stress signal ( Fig. 5 D ).

p53 regulates its targets by binding to p53-REs as a tetramer. An intact p53 TD is critical for efficient DNA binding ( 34 ), protein–protein interaction ( 35 ), and posttranslational modifications ( 36 ). Here, we showed that DEC1 physically associates with p53 via the TD ( Fig. S5 ) and attenuates p53 binding to its target MIC-1 promoter ( Fig. 4 ). In addition, transactivation of the MIC-1 promoter by p53 is diminished by DEC1. Importantly, we showed that in order for DEC1 to suppress p53 activation of the MIC-1 promoter, both DEC1 and p53 have to bind to the same promoter and interact with each other on the promoter ( Fig. 4 ). However, although both DEC1 and p53 bind to p21 and Mdm2 promoters, DEC1 is unable to inhibit the ability of p53 to bind to p53-REs on these promoters, probably due to lack of interaction between DEC1 and p53 on the promoters ( Fig. 4 ), and, consequently, DEC1 is unable to suppress p53 induction of p21 and Mdm2 ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S4 ). We note that DEC1 slightly inhibits p53 induction of Bax expression ( Fig. 3 A ) but does not inhibit the ability of p53 to bind to the Bax promoter ( Fig. S7 B ). In addition, DEC1 potentially inhibits Bax expression regardless of p53 ( Fig. S7 E ), which suggests that p53 is capable of inducing apoptosis in the absence of Bax, consistent with published studies ( 37 , 38 ). Together, our data suggest that upon binding to the MIC-1 promoter, DEC1 and p53 form a complex, which weakens the DNA-binding activity of p53 to the MIC-1 promoter. Thus, further study is warranted to examine whether DEC1 disrupts proper formation of p53 tetramers upon binding to the p53 TD.

The activities of transcription factors are often modulated by transcription cofactors, such as HDACs. It has been shown that HDAC1 is recruited by p53 to repress p53 target gene promoters ( 39 ) and inhibits p53 activity through p53 deacetylation ( 40 ). Here, we showed that HDAC1 is present in the p53–DEC1 complex ( Fig. S5 A ). Interestingly, we previously reported that HDAC2 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity ( 31 ), and HDAC2 associates with DEC1 and attenuates DEC1 activation of the ΔNp63 promoter ( 30 ). Thus, DEC1 potentially represses p53 transcriptional activity on the MIC-1 promoter via recruiting HDAC1/2 corepressors, which needs to be further explored.

MIC-1, a TGF-β superfamily cytokine, plays a role in cell proliferation, cell mobility, and the response of cancer cells to a therapy. Under physiological conditions, the level of MIC-1 protein is undetectable in most tissues except placenta and brain ( 41 ). However, MIC-1 expression is increased during neoplastic transformation, along with an elevated level of secreted mature MIC-1 in sera from cancer patients ( 41 ). Thus, the level of serum MIC-1 is explored as a diagnostic tool. Several factors are known to up-regulate MIC-1 expression, including Sp1 ( 23 ) and p53 ( 25 , 27 ). Like other TGF-β family members, MIC-1 acts as a tumor suppressor at the early stage of tumorigenesis, but at the late stage is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis ( 41 ). Here, we showed that DEC1 inhibits MIC-1 expression under both the basal and stress conditions. Interestingly, the basal expression of MIC-1 in the absence of p53 is extremely low in multiple cell lines ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S4 ). Thus, we hypothesize that in the early stage of tumorigenesis when p53 is still wild type and can be readily activated, overexpression of DEC1 in some tumors would inhibit p53 induction of MIC-1, and thus promote tumor development.

DEC1/2 along with CLOCK (NPAS2), BMAL1, Cry1/2, and Per1/2 are five clock-gene families regulating the circadian rhythm ( 14 ). Importantly, recent observations showed that clock genes are involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Loss of Per1 or Per2 impairs DNA damage-induced apoptosis ( 42 , 43 ), whereas Cry-null cells exhibit increased apoptotic response upon DNA damage ( 44 ). These findings suggest that clock genes differentially modulate the extent of DNA damage-induced cell death. Interestingly, rhythmic expression of p53 is synchronized with the expression pattern of Per1 in oral mucosa ( 45 ). In addition, impaired p53 activation upon γ-irradiation was found in Per2-null thymocytes ( 43 ). However, the mechanism by which the clock genes regulate p53 is not clear. Therefore, our findings suggest that DEC1 links the circadian clock with the p53 pathway, and thus may be explored to improve cancer chronotherapy.
