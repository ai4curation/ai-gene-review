Protein synthesis is highly regulated via both initiation and elongation. One 
mechanism that inhibits elongation is phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation 
factor 2 (eEF2) on threonine 56 (T56) by eEF2 kinase (eEF2K). T56 
phosphorylation inactivates eEF2 and is the only known normal eEF2 functional 
modification. In contrast, eEF2K undergoes extensive regulatory phosphorylations 
that allow diverse pathways to impact elongation. We describe a new mode of eEF2 
regulation and show that its phosphorylation by cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 
2 (CDK2) on a novel site, serine 595 (S595), directly regulates T56 
phosphorylation by eEF2K. S595 phosphorylation varies during the cell cycle and 
is required for efficient T56 phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, S595 
phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2 directly stimulates eEF2 T56 phosphorylation by 
eEF2K in vitro, and we suggest that S595 phosphorylation facilitates T56 
phosphorylation by recruiting eEF2K to eEF2. S595 phosphorylation is thus the 
first known eEF2 modification that regulates its inhibition by eEF2K and 
provides a novel mechanism linking the cell cycle machinery to translational 
control. Because all known eEF2 regulation is exerted via eEF2K, S595 
phosphorylation may globally couple the cell cycle machinery to regulatory 
pathways that impact eEF2K activity.

We describe a new mode of eEF2 regulation and show that its phosphorylation by cyclin A–cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) on a novel site, serine 595 (S595), directly regulates T56 phosphorylation by eEF2K. S595 phosphorylation varies during the cell cycle and is required for efficient T56 phosphorylation in vivo . Importantly, S595 phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2 directly stimulates eEF2 T56 phosphorylation by eEF2K in vitro , and we suggest that S595 phosphorylation facilitates T56 phosphorylation by recruiting eEF2K to eEF2. S595 phosphorylation is thus the first known eEF2 modification that regulates its inhibition by eEF2K and provides a novel mechanism linking the cell cycle machinery to translational control.

INTRODUCTION

Global protein synthesis is subject to complex regulation that allows cells to control this energy-intensive process in response to diverse physiologic cues. Translation is regulated at the initiation and elongation levels. For example, translation is repressed in the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle ( 1 , 2 ), in which inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factors represses mitotic translation ( 2 – 4 ). Translational control is also exerted at the level of elongation, and this often involves inhibition of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) ( 5 – 7 ).

eEF2 is a GTP-dependent translocase that is responsible for the movement of nascent peptidyl-tRNAs from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome. The only known normal mechanism that regulates eEF2 is an inhibitory phosphorylation at threonine 56 (T56), which falls within the eEF2 GTP-binding domain and prevents eEF2 from binding to the ribosome ( 8 , 9 ). A single, atypical calmodulin-dependent kinase, termed eEF2 kinase (eEF2K), phosphorylates eEF2 on T56 ( 10 – 12 ). Many signals cause eEF2K to become phosphorylated on residues that inhibit or augment its activity ( 5 , 13 , 14 ). For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mTOR pathways inhibit eEF2K in response to mitogen and nutrient signals ( 15 – 17 ). In contrast, AMP kinase- and protein kinase A/Ca 2+ -dependent signaling activates eEF2K in response to starvation, hypoxia, and oxidative stress ( 18 – 21 ). Thus, while many signaling pathways control eEF2 activity, this regulation is exerted exclusively via modification of eEF2K rather than eEF2. T56 phosphorylation is thus the only known eEF2 functional modification, other than its inhibition by ADP ribosylation catalyzed by bacterial toxins ( 6 ).

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) coordinate cell division by phosphorylating numerous downstream substrates. We developed a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach employing ATP analog-sensitive CDK2 and substrate thiophosphorylation to identify cyclin A-CDK2 substrates in fractionated cell lysates ( 22 ). This screen identified 180 putative CDK2 substrates that function in diverse cellular processes. Several candidates have critical roles in protein synthesis, including eEF2, which we validated to be phosphorylated by cyclin A-CDK2 in vitro ( 22 ). Here, we show that eEF2 phosphorylation on serine 595 (S595) by cyclin A-CDK2 directly promotes its inhibitory phosphorylation by eEF2K. eEF2 S595 phosphorylation is highest in mitosis, when it is also sensitive to pharmacologic CDK inhibition. Remarkably, S595 phosphorylation is required for efficient eEF2 T56 phosphorylation by eEF2K. Mutation of either S595 or a nearby residue (H599) greatly inhibits eEF2 T56 phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro . Moreover, we reconstituted this regulation with purified components and found that eEF2 phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2 directly stimulates its phosphorylation by eEF2K and that this requires CDK2 activity, S595, and T56. Finally, a peptide spanning the eEF2 S595 region functions as a phosphorylation-dependent inhibitor of T56 phosphorylation. We speculate that S595 phosphorylation recruits eEF2K to promote T56 phosphorylation. S595 phosphorylation is the first known eEF2 modification that regulates its phosphorylation by eEF2K. Because all known eEF2 regulation is exerted via eEF2K, S595 phosphorylation may globally modulate elongation responses to diverse physiologic inputs.

DISCUSSION

We describe a new mechanism of eEF2 regulation and show that S595 phosphorylation is required for efficient T56 inhibitory phosphorylation by eEF2K. Because all known regulatory pathways that control eEF2 converge upon eEF2K and T56, S595 phosphorylation can potentially impact global eEF2 regulation by augmenting T56 phosphorylation by eEF2K ( Fig. 7A ). Figure 7B shows the positions of T56, S595, and H599, superimposed on the structure of budding yeast eEF2, which is highly homologous to human eEF2 ( 29 ). Our previous work showed that eEF2K contains distinct C-terminal eEF2 targeting and N-terminal catalytic domains that are separated by a linker region ( 30 ). We thus suggest that the S595 region interacts with eEF2K via its eEF2-targeting domain to promote efficient T56 phosphorylation by its catalytic domain ( Fig. 7B ). However, this model remains speculative and other mechanisms, such as allosteric eEF2 regulation, could account for the impact of S595 phosphorylation on T56.

We focused on cyclin A-CDK2, but other kinases could also have roles in S595 phosphorylation. Multiple cyclin-CDKs phosphorylate eEF2 in vitro , and the impact of specific cyclin-CDKs on S595 phosphorylation may depend upon factors such as cell cycle position, relative binding affinities, and access to eEF2. Other proline-directed kinases also exhibit redundancy with cyclin-CDKs on some substrates. Although we found that GSK3β and MAPK, kinases that can exhibit redundancy with CDKs, do not phosphorylate eEF2 in vitro , other cellular kinases could have roles in S595 phosphorylation ( 25 , 31 ). However, the fact that S595 phosphorylation is inhibited by roscovitine suggests that CDKs are the major S595 kinases in mitosis.

Our findings that both S595 and T56 are hyperphosphorylated in prometaphase cells support previous studies showing that mitotic cells exhibit high eEF2 T56 phosphorylation and suppressed translation ( 1 – 4 , 6 , 7 , 32 ). Moreover, the concordant increase in both S595 and T56 phosphorylation in mitosis is consistent with the notion that S595 phosphorylation facilitates efficient T56 phosphorylation. In contrast, one group found that eEF2K is inhibited by phosphorylation on serine 359 by cyclin B-CDC2, which they suggest keeps eEF2 active in mitotic cells ( 33 ). The idea that CDC2 activity inhibits eEF2K seems opposed to our findings, as well as those of a recent study showing that phosphorylation of elongation factor 1 in mitosis, probably by cyclin B-CDK1, inhibits protein synthesis through hindered tRNA delivery to ribosomes ( 34 ). Although the basis for this discrepancy is unclear, it could reflect numerous experimental variables, including different cyclin-CDKs. Thus, the net impact of CDK activity on eEF2 may involve a balance between S595 phosphorylation and eEF2K inhibition in specific contexts.

In addition to intrinsic cell cycle oscillations, CDK activity is regulated by numerous processes, including checkpoints, apoptosis, DNA damage, and development. S595 phosphorylation may thus impact eEF2 activity in diverse physiologic contexts. However, because of the pleiotropic effects of general CDK inhibition, further physiologic functional studies of S595 phosphorylation will require dissociating S595 phosphorylation from overall CDK activity, such as with S595A knock-in models.
