The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family consists of at least seven closely 
related polypeptide mitogens which exert their activities by binding and 
activation of specific cell surface receptors. Unanswered questions have been 
whether there are multiple FGF receptors and what factors determine binding 
specificity and biological response. We report the complete cDNA cloning of two 
human genes previously designated flg and bek. These genes encode two similar 
but distinct cell surface receptors comprised of an extracellular domain with 
three immunoglobulin-like regions, a single transmembrane domain, and a 
cytoplasmic portion containing a tyrosine kinase domain with a typical kinase 
insert. The expression of these two cDNAs in transfected NIH 3T3 cells led to 
the biosynthesis of proteins of 150 kd and 135 kd for flg and bek, respectively. 
Direct binding experiments with radiolabeled acidic FGF (aFGF) or basic FGF 
(bFGF), inhibition of binding with native growth factors, and Scatchard analysis 
of the binding data indicated that bek and flg bind either aFGF or bFGF with 
dissociation constants of (2-15) x 10(-11) M. The high affinity binding of two 
distinct growth factors to each of two different receptors represents a unique 
double redundancy without precedence among polypeptide growth factor-receptor 
interactions.
