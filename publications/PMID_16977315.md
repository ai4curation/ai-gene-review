In order to fold non-native proteins, chaperonin GroEL undergoes numerous 
conformational changes and GroES binding in the ATP-dependent reaction cycle. We 
constructed the real-time three-dimensional-observation system at high 
resolution using a newly developed fast-scanning atomic force microscope. Using 
this system, we visualized the GroES binding to and dissociation from individual 
GroEL with a lifetime of 6 s (k=0.17 s(-1)). We also caught ATP/ADP-induced 
open-closed conformational changes of individual GroEL in the absence of qGroES 
and substrate proteins. Namely, the ATP/ADP-bound GroEL can change its 
conformation 'from closed to open' without additional ATP hydrolysis. 
Furthermore, the lifetime of open conformation in the presence of ADP ( 
approximately 1.0 s) was apparently lower than those of ATP and ATP-analogs (2-3 
s), meaning that ADP-bound open-form is structurally less stable than ATP-bound 
open-form. These results indicate that GroEL has at least two distinct 
open-conformations in the presence of nucleotide; ATP-bound prehydrolysis 
open-form and ADP-bound open-form, and the ATP hydrolysis in open-form 
destabilizes its open-conformation and induces the 'from open to closed' 
conformational change of GroEL.
