The Toll-like receptor-interleukin 1 receptor signaling (TLR-IL-1R) receptor 
superfamily is important in differentially recognizing pathogen products and 
eliciting appropriate immune responses. These receptors alter gene expression, 
mainly through the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and activating protein 1. 
SIGIRR (single immunoglobulin IL-1R-related molecule), a member of this family 
that does not activate these factors, instead negatively modulates immune 
responses. Inflammation is enhanced in SIGIRR-deficient mice, as shown by their 
enhanced chemokine induction after IL-1 injection and reduced threshold for 
lethal endotoxin challenge. Cells from SIGIRR-deficient mice showed enhanced 
activation in response to either IL-1 or certain Toll ligands. Finally, 
biochemical analysis indicated that SIGIRR binds to the TLR-IL-1R signaling 
components in a ligand-dependent way. Our data show that SIGIRR functions as a 
biologically important modulator of TLR-IL-1R signaling.
