Apaf-1 coassembles with cytochrome c to form the apoptosome, which then binds 
and activates procaspase-9 (pc-9). We removed pc-9 catalytic domains from the 
holoapoptosome by site-directed thrombinolysis. A structure of the resulting 
apoptosome-pc-9 CARD complex was then determined at approximately 9.5 A 
resolution. In our model, the central hub is constructed like other AAA+ protein 
rings but also contains novel features. At higher radius, the regulatory region 
of each Apaf-1 is comprised of tandem seven and eight blade beta-propellers with 
cytochrome c docked between them. Remarkably, Apaf-1 CARDs are disordered in the 
ground state. During activation, each Apaf-1 CARD interacts with a pc-9 CARD and 
these heterodimers form a flexibly tethered "disk" that sits above the central 
hub. When taken together, the data reveal conformational changes during Apaf-1 
assembly that allow pc-9 activation. The model also provides a plausible 
explanation for the effects of NOD mutations that have been mapped onto the 
central hub.
