PUS3 encodes the pseudouridylate synthase 3, an enzyme catalyzing the formation 
of tRNA pseudouridine, which plays a critical role in tRNA structure, function, 
and stability. Biallelic pathogenic variants of PUS3 have been previously 
associated with severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, epilepsy, and 
short stature. We identified a novel homozygous PUS3 frameshift variant in a 
child with facial dysmorphisms, growth failure, microcephaly, retinal dystrophy, 
cerebellar hypoplasia, congenital heart defect, and right kidney hypoplasia. 
This patient further expands the phenotypic spectrum of PUS3-related disorders 
to include a more severe syndromic presentation.
