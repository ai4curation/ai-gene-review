Development and acclimation processes to the environment are associated with 
large-scale changes in chromatin compaction in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
thaliana). Here, we studied the effects of light signals on chromatin 
organization. A decrease in light intensity induces a large-scale reduction in 
chromatin compaction. This low light response is reversible and shows strong 
natural genetic variation. Moreover, the degree of chromatin compaction is 
affected by light quality signals relevant for natural canopy shade. The 
photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME2 appears a general positive regulator of low 
light-induced chromatin decompaction. Phytochrome B also controls light-induced 
chromatin organization, but its effect appears to be dependent on the genetic 
background. We present a model in which chromatin compaction is regulated by the 
light environment via CRYPTOCHROME2 protein abundance, which is controlled by 
phytochrome B action.

Abstract

Development and acclimation processes to the environment are associated with large-scale changes in chromatin compaction in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). Here, we studied the effects of light signals on chromatin organization. A decrease in light intensity induces a large-scale reduction in chromatin compaction. This low light response is reversible and shows strong natural genetic variation. Moreover, the degree of chromatin compaction is affected by light quality signals relevant for natural canopy shade. The photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME2 appears a general positive regulator of low light-induced chromatin decompaction. Phytochrome B also controls light-induced chromatin organization, but its effect appears to be dependent on the genetic background. We present a model in which chromatin compaction is regulated by the light environment via CRYPTOCHROME2 protein abundance, which is controlled by phytochrome B action.
