alpha-Sarcoglycan is a component of the sarcoglycan complex of 
dystrophin-associated proteins. Mutations of any of the sarcoglycan genes cause 
specific forms of muscular dystrophies, collectively termed sarcoglycanopathies. 
Importantly, a deficiency of any specific sarcoglycan affects the expression of 
the others. Thus, it appears that the lack of sarcoglycans deprives the muscle 
cell of an essential, yet unknown function. In the present study, we provide 
evidence for an ecto-ATPase activity of alpha-sarcoglycan. alpha-Sarcoglycan 
binds ATP in a Mg2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent manner. The binding is 
inhibited by 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP and ADP. Sequence analysis reveals the 
existence of a consensus site for nucleotide binding in the extracellular domain 
of the protein. An antibody against this sequence inhibits the binding of ATP. A 
dystrophin.dystrophin-associated protein preparation demonstrates a Mg-ATPase 
activity that is inhibited by the antibody but not by inhibitors of 
endo-ATPases. In addition, we demonstrate the presence in the sarcolemmal 
membrane of a P2X-type purinergic receptor. These data suggest that 
alpha-sarcoglycan may modulate the activity of P2X receptors by buffering the 
extracellular ATP concentration. The absence of alpha-sarcoglycan in 
sarcoglycanopathies leaves elevated the concentration of extracellular ATP and 
the persistent activation of P2X receptors, leading to intracellular Ca2+ 
overload and muscle fiber death.
