The MDM2 oncoprotein is a cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor in that 
it can bind the transactivation domain of p53 and downregulate its ability to 
activate transcription. In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event 
and contributes to the inactivation of p53. The crystal structure of the 
109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation 
domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which 
the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix. The interface relies on the 
steric complementarity between the MDM2 cleft and the hydrophobic face of the 
p53 alpha helix and, in particular, on a triad of p53 amino acids-Phe19, Trp23, 
and Leu26-which insert deep into the MDM2 cleft. These same p53 residues are 
also involved in transactivation, supporting the hypothesis that MDM2 
inactivates p53 by concealing its transactivation domain. The structure also 
suggests that the amphipathic alpha helix may be a common structural motif in 
the binding of a diverse family of transactivation factors to the TATA-binding 
protein-associated factors.
