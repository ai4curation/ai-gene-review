The p53 cofactor Strap (stress responsive activator of p300) is directly
targeted by the DNA damage signalling pathway where phosphorylation by ATM
(ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase facilitates nuclear accumulation. Here,
we show that Strap regulation reflects the coordinated interplay between
different DNA damage-activated protein kinases, ATM and Chk2 (Checkpoint kinase
2), where phosphorylation by each kinase provides a distinct functional
consequence on the activity of Strap. ATM phosphorylation prompts nuclear
accumulation, which we show occurs by impeding nuclear export, whereas Chk2
phosphorylation augments protein stability once Strap has attained a nuclear
location. These results highlight the various functional roles undertaken by the
DNA damage signalling kinases in Strap control and, more generally, shed light
on the pathways that contribute to the regulation of the p53 response.

Abstract

The p53 cofactor Strap (stress responsive activator of p300) is directly targeted by the DNA damage signalling pathway where phosphorylation by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase facilitates nuclear accumulation. Here, we show that Strap regulation reflects the coordinated interplay between different DNA damage-activated protein kinases, ATM and Chk2 (Checkpoint kinase 2), where phosphorylation by each kinase provides a distinct functional consequence on the activity of Strap. ATM phosphorylation prompts nuclear accumulation, which we show occurs by impeding nuclear export, whereas Chk2 phosphorylation augments protein stability once Strap has attained a nuclear location. These results highlight the various functional roles undertaken by the DNA damage signalling kinases in Strap control and, more generally, shed light on the pathways that contribute to the regulation of the p53 response.

Introduction

Strap (stress responsive activator of p300) is a p300-interacting protein that is required for an effective p53 response ( Demonacos et al , 2001 ). Strap has an unusual structure consisting of a tandem array of tetratricopeptide repeat motifs ( Demonacos et al , 2001 ) that function in the assembly of multiprotein complexes ( D'Andrea & Regan, 2003 ). Strap interacts with various components of the p53 co-activator complex, including JMY (junction mediating and regulatory) and p300, which facilitate p53 activity. This occurs in part because Strap increases the half-life of p53 by preventing the downregulation of p53 by Mdm2 (murine double minute 2). These findings, together with the fact that Strap is DNA damage responsive ( Demonacos et al , 2001 , 2004 ), suggest that Strap, as a component of the p53 co-activator complex, has an important function in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage.

Strap is a direct target for the DNA damage signalling pathway; ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase phosphorylates Strap in response to DNA damage, and phosphorylation is required for protein stabilization ( Demonacos et al , 2004 ). It is consistent with the function of ATM kinase in the control of Strap stability that a Strap mutant devoid of the S203 phosphorylation site and endogenous Strap in ataxia telangiectasia cells fail to undergo nuclear accumulation and stabilization in response to DNA damage ( Demonacos et al , 2004 ). However, in the context of the DNA damage signalling cascade, it is widely accepted that Chk2 (Checkpoint kinase 2) lies downstream from ATM, where it becomes activated, in part, through phosphorylation by ATM ( Bartek et al , 2001 ). In turn, Chk2 phosphorylates several effector targets, including p53 and E2F-1, and has a crucial function in mediating the checkpoint response ( Hirao et al , 2000 ).

Here, we report that the response of Strap to DNA damage reflects the coordinated interplay between ATM and Chk2 kinase, each of which phosphorylates Strap on different residues and has distinct functional consequences on Strap activity. Although phosphorylation by ATM kinase causes nuclear accumulation, most probably by impeding nuclear export, Chk2 augments protein stability once Strap has attained a nuclear location. These results highlight the interplay between the main DNA damage signalling kinases in Strap control and, more generally, the intricate pathways involved in cofactor control during the p53 response.

Methods

Plasmids and reagents. The Strap mutant derivative S221A was created using oligonucleotides designed in accordance with Stratagene's QuikChange ® Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) using the following primer: S221A: GTGGACAGGAAAGCAGCTAGCAACCCTGACCTTCATCTC. The Strap mutant derivatives ΔNES and S203A/ΔNES were created by deleting the appropriate region from wild-type or S203A Strap in accordance with Stratagene's QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit using the following primers: ΔNES: forward: GAAGCGAAGCACGTCTACTGTTTTCGAGAC; reverse: GTCTCGAAAACAGTAGACGTGCTTCGCTTC. The resulting constructs were all verified by sequencing. The Strap siRNA sequence was CAGAGAAAGUUGACAGAAAUU custom made from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL, USA). Leptomycin B was supplied by Sigma (Dorset, UK) and the Chk2 inhibitor ( Sharma & Tepe, 2004 ) was from Merck (Nottingham, UK).
