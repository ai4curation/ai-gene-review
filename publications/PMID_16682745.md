Apolipoprotein M (apoM) is a novel apolipoprotein with unknown function. In this 
study, we established a method for isolating apoM-containing lipoproteins and 
studied their composition and the effect of apoM on HDL function. 
ApoM-containing lipoproteins were isolated from human plasma with immunoaffinity 
chromatography and compared with lipoproteins lacking apoM. The apoM-containing 
lipoproteins were predominantly of HDL size; approximately 5% of the total HDL 
population contained apoM. Mass spectrometry showed that the apoM-containing 
lipoproteins also contained apoJ, apoA-I, apoA-II, apoC-I, apoC-II, apoC-III, 
paraoxonase 1, and apoB. ApoM-containing HDL (HDL(apoM+)) contained 
significantly more free cholesterol than HDL lacking apoM (HDL(apoM-)) (5.9 +/- 
0.7% vs. 3.2 +/- 0.5%; P < 0.005) and was heterogeneous in size with both small 
and large particles. HDL(apoM+) inhibited Cu(2+)-induced oxidation of LDL and 
stimulated cholesterol efflux from THP-1 foam cells more efficiently than 
HDL(apoM-). In conclusion, our results suggest that apoM is associated with a 
small heterogeneous subpopulation of HDL particles. Nevertheless, apoM 
designates a subpopulation of HDL that protects LDL against oxidation and 
stimulates cholesterol efflux more efficiently than HDL lacking apoM.
