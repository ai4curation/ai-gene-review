Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited eye 
disease. X-linked nuclear modifiers were proposed to modify the phenotypic 
manifestation of LHON-associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. By 
whole-exome sequencing, we identified the X-linked LHON modifier (c.157C>T, 
p.Arg53Trp) in PRICKLE3 encoding a mitochondrial protein linked to biogenesis of 
ATPase in 3 Chinese families. All affected individuals carried both ND4 11778G>A 
and p.Arg53Trp mutations, while subjects bearing only a single mutation 
exhibited normal vision. The cells carrying the p.Arg53Trp mutation exhibited 
defective assembly, stability, and function of ATP synthase, verified by 
PRICKLE3-knockdown cells. Coimmunoprecipitation indicated the direct interaction 
of PRICKLE3 with ATP synthase via ATP8. Strikingly, cells bearing both 
p.Arg53Trp and m.11778G>A mutations displayed greater mitochondrial dysfunction 
than those carrying only a single mutation. This finding indicated that the 
p.Arg53Trp mutation acted in synergy with the m.11778G>A mutation and 
deteriorated mitochondrial dysfunctions necessary for the expression of LHON. 
Furthermore, we demonstrated that Prickle3-deficient mice exhibited pronounced 
ATPase deficiencies. Prickle3-knockout mice recapitulated LHON phenotypes with 
retinal deficiencies, including degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and 
abnormal vasculature. Our findings provided new insights into the 
pathophysiology of LHON that were manifested by interaction between mtDNA 
mutations and X-linked nuclear modifiers.
