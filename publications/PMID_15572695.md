The bZIP transcription factor Nrf2 controls a genetic program that protects 
cells from oxidative damage and maintains cellular redox homeostasis. Keap1, a 
BTB-Kelch protein, is the major upstream regulator of Nrf2 and controls both the 
subcellular localization and steady-state levels of Nrf2. In this report, we 
demonstrate that Keap1 functions as a substrate adaptor protein for a 
Cul3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Keap1 assembles into a functional E3 
ubiquitin ligase complex with Cul3 and Rbx1 that targets multiple lysine 
residues located in the N-terminal Neh2 domain of Nrf2 for ubiquitin conjugation 
both in vivo and in vitro. Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2 is inhibited 
following exposure of cells to quinone-induced oxidative stress and 
sulforaphane, a cancer-preventive isothiocyanate. A mutant Keap1 protein 
containing a single cysteine-to-serine substitution at residue 151 within the 
BTB domain of Keap1 is markedly resistant to inhibition by either 
quinone-induced oxidative stress or sulforaphane. Inhibition of Keap1-dependent 
ubiquitination of Nrf2 correlates with decreased association of Keap1 with Cul3. 
Neither quinone-induced oxidative stress nor sulforaphane disrupts association 
between Keap1 and Nrf2. Our results suggest that the ability of Keap1 to 
assemble into a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is the critical 
determinant that controls steady-state levels of Nrf2 in response to 
cancer-preventive compounds and oxidative stress.
