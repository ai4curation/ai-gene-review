Nuclear VCP-like 2 (NVL2) is a member of the chaperone-like AAA-ATPase family 
and is involved in the biosynthesis of 60S ribosomal subunits in mammalian 
cells. We previously showed the interaction of NVL2 with a DExD/H-box RNA 
helicase MTR4/DOB1, which is a known cofactor for an exoribonuclease complex, 
the exosome. This finding implicated NVL2 in RNA metabolic processes during 
ribosome biogenesis. In the present study, we found that a series of mutations 
within the ATPase domain of NVL2 causes a defect in pre-rRNA processing into 
mature 28S and 5.8S rRNAs. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that NVL2 was 
associated with the nuclear exosome complex, which includes RRP6 as a 
nucleus-specific catalytic subunit. This interaction was prevented by depleting 
either MTR4 or RRP6, indicating their essential role in mediating this 
interaction with NVL2. Additionally, knockdown of MPP6, another cofactor for the 
nuclear exosome, also prevented the interaction by causing MTR4 to dissociate 
from the nuclear exosome. These results suggest that NVL2 is involved in 
pre-rRNA processing by associating with the nuclear exosome complex and that 
MPP6 is required for maintaining the integrity of this rRNA processing complex.
