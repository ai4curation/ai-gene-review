Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) is due to mutations in the CLN3 
gene. We previously determined that CLN3 protein harbors a highly conserved 
motif, VYFAE, necessary for its impact on cell growth and apoptosis. Using 
molecular modeling we demonstrated that this motif is embedded in a stretch of 
amino acids that is homologous to and structurally compatible with a 
galactosylceramide (GalCer) binding domain. This domain is present in the V3 
loop of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein, beta-amyloid protein, and the 
infectious form of prionic protein, and defines a binding site for lipid rafts. 
We determined the subcellular localization of CLN3 in different cell systems 
including human neurons, primary rat hippocampal neurons, normal human 
fibroblasts, and JNCL fibroblasts homozygous for the 1.02 kb deletion in genomic 
DNA. Wild-type CLN3 protein was present within Golgi, lipid rafts in the plasma 
membrane, and early recycling endosomes, but not late endosomes/lysosomes. 
Wild-type CLN3 internalized from the plasma membrane to the Golgi via Rab4- and 
Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Wild-type CLN3 co-localized with GalCer in 
the Golgi and in lipid rafts at the plasma membrane in normal cells. Neither 
mutant CLN3 protein nor GalCer were found at the plasma membrane in JNCL 
fibroblasts. Mutant CLN3p was retained within the Golgi and partially 
mis-localized to lysosomes, failing to reach recycling endosomes, plasma 
membrane, or lipid rafts. These studies identify a novel CLN3 domain that may 
dictate localization and function of CLN3.
