14-3-3 proteins are evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitous proteins that 
function in a wide variety of biological processes. Here we define a new role 
for C. elegans 14-3-3 proteins in life span regulation. We identify two C. 
elegans 14-3-3 proteins as interacting proteins of a major life span regulator, 
the C. elegans SIR2 ortholog, SIR-2.1. Similar to sir-2.1, we find that 
overexpression of either 14-3-3 protein (PAR-5 or FTT-2) extends life span and 
that this is dependent on DAF-16, a forkhead transcription factor (FOXO), 
another important life span regulator in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. 
Furthermore, we show that both 14-3-3 proteins are co-expressed with DAF-16 and 
SIR-2.1 in the tissues critical for life span regulation. Finally, we show that 
DAF-16/FOXO also physically interacts with the 14-3-3 proteins. These results 
suggest that C. elegans 14-3-3 proteins can regulate longevity by cooperating 
with both SIR-2.1 and DAF-16/FOXO.
