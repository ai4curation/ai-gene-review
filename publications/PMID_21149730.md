Disruption of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway by mutations can 
cause xeroderma pigmentosum, a syndrome predisposing affected individuals to 
development of skin cancer. The xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) protein is 
essential for initiating global genome NER by recognizing the DNA lesion and 
recruiting downstream factors. Here we show that inhibition of the deacetylase 
and longevity factor SIRT1 impairs global genome NER through suppressing the 
transcription of XPC in a SIRT1 deacetylase-dependent manner. SIRT1 enhances XPC 
expression by reducing AKT-dependent nuclear localization of the transcription 
repressor of XPC. Finally, we show that SIRT1 levels are significantly reduced 
in human skin tumors from Caucasian patients, a population at highest risk. 
These findings suggest that SIRT1 acts as a tumor suppressor through its role in 
DNA repair.
