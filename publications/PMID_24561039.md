During interphase, Rab11-GTPase-containing endosomes recycle endocytic cargo. 
However, little is known about Rab11 endosomes in mitosis. Here, we show that 
Rab11 localizes to the mitotic spindle and regulates dynein-dependent endosome 
localization at poles. We found that mitotic recycling endosomes bind γ-TuRC 
components and associate with tubulin in vitro. Rab11 depletion or 
dominant-negative Rab11 expression disrupts astral microtubules, delays mitosis, 
and redistributes spindle pole proteins. Reciprocally, constitutively active 
Rab11 increases astral microtubules, restores γ-tubulin spindle pole 
localization, and generates robust spindles. This suggests a role for Rab11 
activity in spindle pole maturation during mitosis. Rab11 depletion causes 
misorientation of the mitotic spindle and the plane of cell division. These 
findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the organization of astral 
microtubules and the mitotic spindle through Rab11-dependent control of spindle 
pole assembly and function. We propose that Rab11 and its associated endosomes 
cocontribute to these processes through retrograde transport to poles by dynein.

Abstract

During interphase, Rab11-GTPase-containing endosomes recycle endocytic cargo. However, little is known about Rab11 and endosomes in mitosis. Here we show that Rab11 localizes to the mitotic spindle and regulates dynein-dependent endosome localization at poles. We found that mitotic recycling endosomes bind γ-TuRC components and associate with tubulin in vitro . Rab11-depletion or dominant-negative Rab11 expression disrupts astral microtubules, delays mitosis, and redistributes spindle pole proteins. Reciprocally, constitutively-active Rab11 increases astral microtubules, restores γ-tubulin spindle pole localization and generates robust spindles. This suggests a fundamental role for Rab11 activity in spindle pole maturation during mitosis. Rab11 depletion causes misorientation of the mitotic spindle and the plane of cell division. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the organization of astral microtubules and the mitotic spindle through Rab11-dependent control of spindle pole assembly and function. We propose that Rab11 and its associated endosomes co-contribute to these processes through retrograde transport to poles by dynein.

INTRODUCTION

We recently showed that the recycling endosome (RE) GTPase, Rab11, binds to mother centriole appendages in interphase cells. RE vesicles interact with and organize around these appendages. Endosome dissociation from centrosomes disrupts endosome recycling ( Hehnly et al., 2012 ). We hypothesized that REs may, in turn, play a role in centrosome function. In fact, Rab11 was identified in a screen for mitotic regulators of microtubule (MT) dynamics in Caenorhabditis elegan s ( Zhang et al., 2008 ) and was shown to require dynein for this function ( Ai et al., 2009 ). Rab11 is also an important regulator of endosome asymmetric distribution in sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells during cell division (Emery G, Cell 2005). Rab11-vesicles have recently been implicated in asymmetric spindle positioning in mouse oocytes ( Holubcová et al., 2013 ), but how Rab11-vesicles can directly contribute to this process was not thoroughly investigated. However, the authors do propose that these vesicles function as cytoskeletal modulators ( Holubcová et al., 2013 ). Here we explore possible functions for Rab11 in the formation of spindle poles, assembly of MT nucleating, anchoring and regulatory proteins at poles, organization of astral MTs, and orientation of mitotic spindles and the plane of cell division.

DISCUSSION

This work has led us to unexpected functions of the Rab11 GTPase and its associated endosomes. First, our results provide evidence for Rab11 function in the construction of spindle poles. We propose that this occurs through dynein-mediated transport of endosomes that, in turn, carries MT nucleating/anchoring and regulatory proteins to the poles. In essence, Rab11-endosomes act as carriers to recruit and organize MT-nucleating material at spindle poles through dynein ( Figure 1 , 2 , 3 ). We believe that this is particularly significant because previous studies suggested that endosomes, like Golgi complexes and endoplasmic reticulum disperse throughout the cytoplasm during mitosis, and that membrane trafficking is thought to be halted until cytokinesis ( Foley and Kapoor, 2013 ; Yadav and Linstedt, 2011 ; Chen et al., 2012 ; Takatsu et al., 2013 ). Second, when Rab11 is disrupted, the molecular and functional integrity of spindle poles is compromised. This diminishes astral MT integrity and inhibits MT attachment to cortical sites essential for orienting spindles. This work reveals a function for Rab11 in spindle pole assembly and spindle orientation. Third, compromised MTs at spindle poles in Rab11-disrupted cells can explain the misaligned chromosomes, mitotic delay and activation of the SAC. Our results support a pathway for activation of the SAC through poor MT-attachments to spindle poles. This pathway is conventionally thought to sense defects in kinetochores-MT attachments, but we contend that poor MT-attachments can occur at kinetochores and/or spindle poles ( Zimmerman and Doxsey, 2000 ; Delaval et al., 2011 ; Firestone et al., 2012 ). Compromised attachments at either site will prevent MT-tension, which is required to satisfy the SAC and permit anaphase onset. The most compelling data for this additional aspect of an old pathway is that kinetochore integrity and function is normal in Rab11 cells (MT nucleation, SAC activation, presence of kinetochore proteins-MCAK, CREST, p150 (data not shown)) and is sufficient to drive spindle assembly (at least the early stages) presumably through activation/dominance of the acentrosomal kinetochore/chromatin-based pathway. Within the same Rab11-depleted cells lies the centrosome, which usually acts dominantly in vertebrate cells to drive spindle assembly. However, the deleterious effects of Rab11-depletion compromise the centrosome presumably rendering it inadequate for spindle assembly.
