Human chromosomal region 11p15.5, which is homologous to mouse chromosome region 
7F5, is a well-known imprinted region. The CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 imprinted domain, 
which is one of two imprinted domains at 11p15.5, includes nine imprinted genes 
regulated by an imprinting center (IC). The CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 IC is a 
differentially methylated region of KCNQ1OT1(KCNQ1OT-DMR) with DNA methylation 
on the maternal allele and no methylation on the paternal allele. CDKN1C (alias 
p57KIP2), an imprinted gene with maternal expression, encoding a 
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is a critical gene within the CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 
domain. In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), approximately 50% of patients show 
loss of DNA methylation accompanied by loss of histone H3 Lys9 dimethylation on 
maternal KCNQ1OT-DMR, namely an imprinting disruption, leading to diminished 
expression of CDKN1C. In cancer, at least three molecular mechanisms--imprinting 
disruption, aberrant DNA methylations at the CDKN1C promoter, and loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) of the maternal allele--are seen and all three result in 
diminished expression of CDKN1C. Imprinting disruption of the CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 
domain is involved in the development of both BWS and cancer and it changes the 
maternal epigenotype to the paternal type, leading to diminished CDKN1C 
expression. In this review, we describe recent advances in epigenetic control of 
the CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 imprinted domain in both humans and mice.
