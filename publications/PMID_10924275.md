Maintenance of the appropriate pH in the intracellular vacuolar compartments is 
essential for normal cell function. Here, we report that CLN3 protein, which is 
associated with the juvenile form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL), 
participates in lysosomal pH homeostasis in human cells. We show that CLN3 
protein increases lysosomal pH in cultured human embryonal kidney cells, whereas 
inhibition of CLN3 protein synthesis by antisense approach acidifies lysosomal 
compartments. These changes in lysosomal pH are sufficient to exert a 
significant biological effect and modify intracellular processing of 
amyloid-beta protein precursor and cathepsin D, model proteins whose metabolism 
is influenced by the pH of acidic organelles. Mutant CLN3 protein (R334C) that 
is associated with the classical JNCL phenotype was devoid of biological 
activities of wild-type CLN3 protein. These data suggest that the pathogenesis 
of juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is associated with altered 
acidification of lysosomal compartments. Furthermore, our study indicates that 
CLN3 protein affects metabolism of proteins essential for cell functions, such 
as amyloid-beta protein precursor, implicated in Alzheimer's disease 
pathogenesis.
