Mutations affecting the BRCT domains of the breast cancer-associated tumor 
suppressor BRCA1 disrupt the recruitment of this protein to DNA double-strand 
breaks (DSBs). The molecular structures at DSBs recognized by BRCA1 are 
presently unknown. We report the interaction of the BRCA1 BRCT domain with 
RAP80, a ubiquitin-binding protein. RAP80 targets a complex containing the 
BRCA1-BARD1 (BRCA1-associated ring domain protein 1) E3 ligase and the 
deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) BRCC36 to MDC1-gammaH2AX-dependent lysine(6)- and 
lysine(63)-linked ubiquitin polymers at DSBs. These events are required for cell 
cycle checkpoint and repair responses to ionizing radiation, implicating 
ubiquitin chain recognition and turnover in the BRCA1-mediated repair of DSBs.

Abstract

Mutations affecting the BRCT domains of the breast cancer–associated tumor suppressor BRCA1 disrupt the recruitment of this protein to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The molecular structures at DSBs recognized by BRCA1 are presently unknown. We report the interaction of the BRCA1 BRCT domain with RAP80, a ubiquitin-binding protein. RAP80 targets a complex containing the BRCA1-BARD1 (BRCA1-associated ring domain protein 1) E3 ligase and the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) BRCC36 to MDC1-γH2AX–dependent lysine 6 - and lysine 63 -linked ubiquitin polymers at DSBs. These events are required for cell cycle checkpoint and repair responses to ionizing radiation, implicating ubiquitin chain recognition and turnover in the BRCA1-mediated repair of DSBs.
