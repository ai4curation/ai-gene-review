DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ) is a eukaryotic B-family DNA polymerase that 
specializes in translesion synthesis and is essential for normal embryogenesis. 
At a minimum, Pol ζ consists of a catalytic subunit Rev3 and an accessory 
subunit Rev7. Mammalian Rev3 contains >3,000 residues and is twice as large as 
the yeast homolog. To date, no vertebrate Pol ζ has been purified for 
biochemical characterization. Here we report purification of a series of human 
Rev3 deletion constructs expressed in HEK293 cells and identification of a 
minimally catalytically active human Pol ζ variant. With a tagged form of an 
active Pol ζ variant, we isolated two additional accessory subunits of human Pol 
ζ, PolD2 and PolD3. The purified four-subunit Pol ζ4 (Rev3-Rev7-PolD2-PolD3) is 
much more efficient and more processive at bypassing a 1,2-intrastrand 
d(GpG)-cisplatin cross-link than the two-subunit Pol ζ2 (Rev3-Rev7). We show 
that complete bypass of cisplatin lesions requires Pol η to insert dCTP opposite 
the 3' guanine and Pol ζ4 to extend the primers.

Abstract

DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ) is a eukaryotic B-family DNA polymerase that specializes in translesion synthesis and is essential for normal embryogenesis. At a minimum, Pol ζ consists of a catalytic subunit Rev3 and an accessory subunit Rev7. Mammalian Rev3 contains >3,000 residues and is twice as large as the yeast homolog. To date, no vertebrate Pol ζ has been purified for biochemical characterization. Here we report purification of a series of human Rev3 deletion constructs expressed in HEK293 cells and identification of a minimally catalytically active human Pol ζ variant. With a tagged form of an active Pol ζ variant, we isolated two additional accessory subunits of human Pol ζ, PolD2 and PolD3. The purified four-subunit Pol ζ4 (Rev3–Rev7–PolD2–PolD3) is much more efficient and more processive at bypassing a 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG)-cisplatin cross-link than the two-subunit Pol ζ2 (Rev3–Rev7). We show that complete bypass of cisplatin lesions requires Pol η to insert dCTP opposite the 3′ guanine and Pol ζ4 to extend the primers.

Discussion

We succeeded in expressing and purifying an active form of human Pol ζ, which enabled us to carry out the previously impossible in vitro characterization of Pol ζ. Mammalian Rev3 is twice as large as the yeast homolog. Among the 1,500 residues (500∼1,800 and 2,000∼2,200 aa) of Rev3 that are unique in higher eukaryotes, we identified a 340-residue highly positively charged domain (residues 960–1,200), which contains low-complexity sequence dominated by Lys (17.8%), Ser (10%), and Arg (8.3%). Its inclusion enhances the specific activity of DNA synthesis by Pol ζ. The exact amino acid sequence of PCD is not highly conserved, but the Lys- and Arg-rich character is conserved from invertebrates to mammals, suggesting that charge–charge interactions may lead to increased DNA binding by Pol ζ. Our deletion analysis also revealed that the region between R7B (Rev7 binding) and the polymerase catalytic domain (residues 2,048–2,217) negatively impacts the polymerase activity of Pol ζ2 ( Fig. 1 ). The remaining 770 residues, which can be removed from human Rev3 without reducing the polymerase activity of Pol ζ2 as shown by our TR-5 construct, may play a role in interactions with other factors to regulate the activity of Pol ζ and its recruitment to a replication fork.

Based on studies of yeast Pol ζ and the CTD of human Rev3, it is not surprising that human PolD2 and PolD3, the equivalents of yeast Pol31 and Pol32, are accessory subunits of human Pol ζ. Our pull-down experiments using whole-cell lysates of HEK293 cells, however, were conducted without the assumption of PolD2 and PolD3 involvement. Only PolD2 and PolD3 copurified with Rev3 (TR4-2) and Rev7 after stringent washing with a 1.0 M NaCl solution, and Rev1, a known cofactor of Pol ζ via interactions with Rev7 ( 41 , 42 , 45 ), was not detected ( Fig. 2 B ). PolD2 and PolD3 must have stronger interactions with Rev3 and Rev7 than Rev1. In yeast, Pol31 directly interacts with the CTD of Pol ζ and Pol δ, and Pol32 interacts only with Pol31 ( 38 ). However, the recent EM study of yeast Pol ζ4 placed Pol32 proximal to Rev7 ( 46 ). Potential interactions between human PolD3 (yeast Pol32 homolog) and Rev7 may explain our observation that PolD3 remains a component of Pol ζ4, even when PolD3 is in molar excess of PolD2 ( Fig. 3 C ). Unless PolD2 and PolD3 are limiting in vivo, both Pol δ and ζ may exist as a four-subunit complex without competing for the accessory units.

In human Pol ζ4, the presence of PolD2 and PolD3, even at submolar ratios to Rev3 (TR4-2), dramatically increased the efficiency ( k cat / K M ) and processivity of DNA synthesis ( Fig. 3 D ). The effect of decreased K M and increased processivity suggests that PolD2 and PolD3 significantly enhance association of Pol ζ with DNA substrates. The cocrystal structure of human PolD2 and the NTD of PolD3 has been determined ( 35 ) and shows a primarily negatively charged molecular surface without obvious features for DNA binding. It is possible that the unstructured, but positively charged, region in PolD3 that is not included in the crystal structure may play a crucial role in enhancing the Pol ζ catalytic activity and processivity. In contrast, inclusion of two accessory subunits in yeast Pol ζ4 primarily increases the k cat by twofold to threefold without an appreciable change of K M or processivity ( 23 ). This difference between yeast and human Pol ζ4 may result from low similarity between human PolD3 and yeast Pol32 accessory subunits.

Pol ζ and Pol η are synergistic in improving the efficiency and processivity of DNA synthesis both in the absence and presence of a DNA lesion ( Fig. 4 C ). In the absence of direct interactions between Pol ζ and Pol η, the synergy most likely takes place by passing DNA substrate between the two polymerases. Pol η and Pol ζ appear to complement each other in catalytic efficiency and processivity in both TLS, as demonstrated here and in maintenance of common fragile sites in human genome as reported ( 14 , 47 ). However, without necessary regulation of their access to DNA replication forks, the substantial efficiency and processivity of these two low-fidelity DNA polymerases could lead to a high frequency of mutagenesis. We expect that stringent down-regulation of Pol ζ may keep this essential polymerase engaged only when necessary for lesion bypass and cell proliferation.

Materials and Methods

Human Pol ζ2 and ζ4 with His 8 –MBP-labeled Rev7 were expressed in transiently transfected HEK293 cells and purified by using affinity pull-down, ion-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography. The catalytically inactive Pol ζ4 − mutant was generated by using QuikChange (Stratagene). Catalytic activities of Pol ζ variants were measured with Fluorescein (6-FAM)-labeled primers as described ( 26 ).
