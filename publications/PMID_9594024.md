Temperature normally affects peak L-type Ca2+ channel (CaCh) current with a 
temperature coefficient (Q10) of between 1.8 and 3.5; in cardiomyocytes 
attenuating protein kinase A activity increases Q10 whilst activating it lowers 
Q10. We examine temperature effects using cloned human cardiac CaChs expressed 
in Xenopus oocytes. Peak inward currents (IBa) through expressed CaChs (i.e. 
alpha1C alpha2/deltaa beta1b) exhibited a Q10 of 5.8+/-0.4 when examined between 
15 and 25 degreesC. The nifedipine-sensitive IBa exhibited a higher Q10 of 
8.7+/-0.5, whilst the nifedipine-insensitive IBa exhibited Q10 of 3.7+/-0.3. 
Current/voltage (I/V) relationships shifted to negative potentials on warming. 
Using instead a different CaCh beta subunit isoform, beta2c, gave rise to an IBa 
similar to those expressed using beta1b. We utilized a carboxyl deletion mutant, 
alpha1C-Delta1633, to determine the temperature sensitivity of the pore moiety 
in the absence of auxiliary subunits; IBa through this channel exhibited a Q10 
of 9.3+/-0.3. However, the Q10 for macroscopic conductance was reduced compared 
to that of heteromeric channels; decreasing from 5.0 (i.e. alpha1C alpha2/deltaa 
beta1b) and 3.9 (i.e. alpha1C alpha2/deltaa beta2c) to 2.4 (alpha1C-Delta1633). 
These observations differ markedly from those made in studies of cardiomyocytes, 
and suggest that enhanced sensitivity may depend on the membrane environment, 
channel assembly or other regulatory factors.
