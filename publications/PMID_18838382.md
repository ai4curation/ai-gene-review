Members of the Fgd (faciogenital dysplasia) gene family encode a group of 
critical guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which, by specifically 
activating Cdc42, control cytoskeleton-dependent membrane rearrangements. In its 
first characterization, we find that FGD2 is expressed in antigen-presenting 
cells, including B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. In the B 
lymphocyte lineage, FGD2 levels change with developmental stage. In both mature 
splenic B cells and immature bone marrow B cells, FGD2 expression is suppressed 
upon activation through the B cell antigen receptor. FGD2 has a complex 
intracellular localization, with concentrations found in membrane ruffles and 
early endosomes. Although endosomal localization of FGD2 is dependent on a 
conserved FYVE domain, its C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain mediates 
recruitment to membrane ruffles. FGD2 overexpression promotes the activation of 
Cdc42 and leads to elevated JNK1 activity in a Cdc42- but not Rac1-dependent 
fashion. These findings are consistent with a role of FGD2 in leukocyte 
signaling and vesicle trafficking in cells specialized to present antigen in the 
immune system.
