BCL10 belongs to the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) family of proteins that 
regulate apoptosis and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Analysis of BCL10-deficient 
mice has revealed that BCL10 mediates NF-kappaB activation by antigen receptors 
in B and T cells. We recently identified a subclass of CARD proteins (CARD9, 
CARD11, and CARD14) that may function to connect BCL10 to multiple upstream 
signaling pathways. We report here that CARD10 is a novel BCL10 interactor that 
belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family, a class of proteins 
that function to organize signaling complexes at plasma membranes. When 
expressed in cells, CARD10 binds to BCL10 and signals the activation of 
NF-kappaB through its N-terminal effector CARD domain. We propose that CARD10 
functions as a molecular scaffold for the assembly of a BCL10 signaling complex 
that activates NF-kappaB.
