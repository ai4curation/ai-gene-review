Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is a key component of the telomerase 
complex. By lengthening telomeres in DNA strands, TERT increases senescent cell 
lifespan. Mice that lack TERT age much faster and exhibit age-related conditions 
such as osteoporosis, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Accelerated telomere 
shortening in both human and animal models has been documented in conditions 
associated with insulin resistance, including T2DM. We investigated the role of 
TERT, in regulating cellular glucose utilisation by using the myoblastoma cell 
line C2C12, as well as primary mouse and human skeletal muscle cells. Inhibition 
of TERT expression or activity by using siRNA (100nM) or specific inhibitors 
(100nM) reduced basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake by ~50%, in all cell types, without 
altering insulin responsiveness. In contrast, TERT over-expression increased 
glucose uptake by 3.25-fold. In C2C12 cells TERT protein was mostly localised 
intracellularly and stimulation of cells with insulin induced translocation to 
the plasma membrane. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments in C2C12 
cells showed that TERT was constitutively associated with glucose transporters 
(GLUTs) 1, 4 and 12 via an insulin insensitive interaction that also did not 
require intact PI3-K and mTOR pathways. Collectively, these findings identified 
a novel extra-nuclear function of TERT that regulates an insulin-insensitive 
pathway involved in glucose uptake in human and mouse skeletal muscle cells.
