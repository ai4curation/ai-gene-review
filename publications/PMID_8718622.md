The aerial parts of plants are coated with an epicuticular wax layer, which is 
important as a first line of defense against external influences. In 
Arabidopsis, the ECERIFERUM (CER) genes effect different steps of the wax 
biosynthesis pathway. In this article, we describe the isolation of the CER1 
gene, which encodes a novel protein involved in the conversion of long chain 
aldehydes to alkanes, a key step in was biosynthesis. CER1 was cloned after gene 
tagging with the heterologous maize transposable element system 
Enhancer-Inhibitor, also known as Suppressor-mutator. cer1 mutants display 
glossy green stems and fruits and are conditionally male sterile. The similarity 
of the CER1 protein with a group of integral membrane enzymes, which process 
highly hydrophobic molecules, points to a function of the CER1 protein as a 
decarbonylase.
