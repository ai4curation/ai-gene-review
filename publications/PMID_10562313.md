p53 has a key role in the negative regulation of cell proliferation, in the 
maintenance of genomic stability, and in the suppression of transformation and 
tumorigenesis. To identify novel regulators of p53, we undertook two functional 
screens to isolate genes which bypassed either p53-mediated growth arrest or 
apoptosis. In both screens, we isolated cDNAs encoding macrophage migration 
inhibitory factor (MIF), a cytokine that was shown previously to exert both 
local and systemic proinflammatory activities. Treatment with MIF overcame p53 
activity in three different biological assays, and suppressed its activity as a 
transcriptional activator. The observation that a proinflammatory cytokine, MIF, 
is capable of functionally inactivating a tumor suppressor, p53, may provide a 
link between inflammation and tumorigenesis.
