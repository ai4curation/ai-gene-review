DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is a key transcription 
factor for drought and heat stress tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. DREB2A 
induces the expression of dehydration- and heat stress-inducible genes under the 
corresponding stress conditions. Target gene selectivity is assumed to require 
stress-specific posttranslational regulation, but the mechanisms of this process 
are not yet understood. Here, we identified DNA POLYMERASE II SUBUNIT B3-1 
(DPB3-1), which was previously annotated as NUCLEAR FACTOR Y, SUBUNIT C10 
(NF-YC10), as a DREB2A interactor, through a yeast two-hybrid screen. The 
overexpression of DPB3-1 in Arabidopsis enhanced the expression of a subset of 
heat stress-inducible DREB2A target genes but did not affect 
dehydration-inducible genes. Similarly, the depletion of DPB3-1 expression 
resulted in reduced expression of heat stress-inducible genes. Interaction and 
expression pattern analyses suggested the existence of a trimer comprising 
NF-YA2, NF-YB3, and DPB3-1 that could synergistically activate a promoter of the 
heat stress-inducible gene with DREB2A in protoplasts. These results suggest 
that DPB3-1 could form a transcriptional complex with NF-YA and NF-YB subunits 
and that the identified trimer enhances heat stress-inducible gene expression 
during heat stress responses in cooperation with DREB2A. We propose that the 
identified trimer contributes to the target gene selectivity of DREB2A under 
heat stress conditions.

INTRODUCTION

Environmental stresses, such as low or high temperatures, drought, or high salinity, have adverse effects on plant growth and productivity. Plants have developed many mechanisms to adapt to such environmental changes. The perception of a specific environmental stress triggers the transduction of stress signals, which induce stress-specific changes in gene expression. Although overlapping sets of genes are induced by different stress conditions, many genes show stress-specific expression patterns ( Thomashow, 1999 ; Zhu, 2002 ; Chinnusamy et al., 2004 ; Bartels, 2005 ; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 2006 ). Because the response mechanisms differ in response to various environmental conditions, the correct expression of genes is assumed to be necessary for plants to survive stress.

The dehydration-responsive element ( DRE ), a 9-bp cis -acting sequence motif (TACCGACAT), was identified from a subset of dehydration-inducible genes in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1994 ). DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A), an APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding factor-type (AP2/ERF-type) transcription factor, was isolated as a protein that recognizes DRE ( Stockinger et al., 1997 ; Liu et al., 1998 ). Subsequent research has revealed that the activity of DREB2A is posttranslationally regulated, and a 30-amino acid region adjacent to the AP2/ERF DNA binding domain plays a critical role in the posttranslational regulation of this protein. The deletion of this region converts the DREB2A protein into a constitutively active form (DREB2A CA), and DREB2A CA -overexpressing Arabidopsis shows a dwarf phenotype and a significant increase in drought stress tolerance ( Sakuma et al., 2006a ). Previous studies revealed that wild-type DREB2A was unstable and degraded by the 26S proteasome pathway under normal conditions, while the conversion into DREB2A CA increased protein stability ( Sakuma et al., 2006a ; Qin et al., 2008 ). Additionally, DREB2A was stabilized under stress conditions, together demonstrating that regulation of stability is one of the posttranslational regulatory mechanisms affecting DREB2A ( Qin et al., 2008 ; Morimoto et al., 2013 ). A microarray analysis revealed that the overexpression of DREB2A CA causes the expression of heat-inducible genes in addition to dehydration-inducible genes. Also, DREB2A expression increases in response to heat stress. The overexpression of DREB2A CA significantly increases heat stress tolerance, and DREB2A knockout mutants exhibit a significant decrease in heat stress tolerance ( Sakuma et al., 2006b ). Thus, the DREB2A transcription factor functions in both dehydration and heat stress responses by inducing the expression of specific gene sets under both conditions. However, the mechanism that determines the stress-specific expression pattern of DREB2A target genes, i.e., how the expression of a subset of DREB2A target genes is activated under a specific stress condition, remains unknown. We assume that the posttranslational regulation of DREB2A activity plays an important role in the correct expression of each stress-inducible gene via unknown mechanisms.

H2A/H2B-like histonefold domain (HFD)-containing proteins are highly conserved among eukaryotes, and the HFD is responsible for the dimerization of H2A- and H2B-like subunits and DNA binding ( Gnesutta et al., 2013 ). Previous studies have revealed that these proteins are involved in various molecular biological processes, including transcription, replication, and remodeling. DNA POLYMERASE II SUBUNIT B3 (DPB3) and DPB4 subunits, which are major H2A/H2B-like proteins, have been identified as components of DNA polymerase II ( Araki et al., 1991 ; Ohya et al., 2000 ); however, additional experiments have suggested that DPB3 and DPB4 are also associated with the histone acetylating complex and the chromatin remodeling complex ( Hartlepp et al., 2005 ; Wang et al., 2008 ). Additionally, DPB3 and DPB4 are suggested to bind double-stranded DNA without sequence specificity ( Tsubota et al., 2006 ). NF-YB and NF-YC subunits are members of other extensively analyzed families of H2A/H2B-like proteins. These subunits form a trimer with an NF-YA subunit, and the trimer binds to a cis -acting element, CCAAT, on gene promoters and regulates transcription in concert with other transcription factors ( McNabb et al., 1995 ; Edwards et al., 1998 ; Mantovani, 1999 ). The negative cofactors 2α (NC2α) and NC2β are also H2A/H2B-like proteins and were originally characterized as corepressors of the TATA box binding protein ( Mermelstein et al., 1996 ; Zhou et al., 2009 ). However, a subsequent study revealed that NC2 subunits are involved in activating promoters with downstream promoter elements ( Willy et al., 2000 ). These protein families (DPB3/DPB4, NF-YB/NF-YC, and NC2α/NC2β) in Arabidopsis were correctly reclassified in a recent study, although all had previously been classified as NF-YB/NF-YC family proteins ( Petroni et al., 2012 ). The number of genes encoding each subunit of H2A/H2B-like HFD-containing proteins in plants is much larger than those in animals ( Petroni et al., 2012 ), which typically encode each subunit as a single gene. As described above, previous studies have revealed the function and characteristics of each family of H2A/H2B-like HFD-containing proteins. However, it is mostly unknown whether and how these protein families act in a coordinated manner to regulate molecular processes. In particular, very little research has been performed on H2A/H2B-like HFD-containing proteins other than NF-YB/NF-YC, such as DPB3/DPB4 and NC2α/NC2β in plants.

In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis DPB3 homolog, DPB3-1, which interacts with DREB2A. We confirmed the interaction between DREB2A and DPB3-1 and characterized functions of DPB3-1 in Arabidopsis . We identified that DPB3-1 could interact with NF-Y subunits, NF-YA2 and NF-YB3, and found that the trimer of these proteins enhanced the transcriptional activity of DREB2A in protoplasts. Our results suggest that the identified trimer comprising DPB3-1, NF-YA2, and NF-YB3 is involved as an enhancer in the heat stress-specific expression, but not the dehydration-specific expression, of DREB2A target genes. The function of the identified trimer may be important in the target selectivity of DREB2A in the adaptive responses of plants to heat stress.

Knockdown ofDPB3-1Results in Reduced Expression of Heat-Inducible Genes and Enhanced Sensitivity to Heat Stress

To further understand the function of DPB3-1 , we obtained a T-DNA insertion mutant of DPB3-1 ( dpb3-1 ; Figure 5A ). The expression level of DPB3-1 was markedly reduced in the dpb3-1 mutant ( Figures 5B ), although a low amount of the mature DPB3-1 mRNA by splicing was detected ( Supplemental Figure 5A ). These results indicate that the dpb3-1 was a DPB3-1 knockdown mutant. We also transformed the dpb3-1 mutant with the 35S:DPB3-1 construct and selected two transgenic lines that exhibited relatively low levels of DPB3-1 expression ( 35S:DPB3-1/dpb3-1 -a and -b) ( Figure 5B ). The dpb3-1 knockdown mutant did not differ from the wild type in the growth under nonstress conditions ( Supplemental Figures 5B and 5C ) or tolerance to drought or salt stress ( Supplemental Figures 5D and 5E ). However, the survival rate after heat stress was significantly decreased in the dpb3-1 mutant compared with the survival rate of the wild type, and the heat stress sensitivity was rescued by the expression of DPB3-1 ( Figures 5C and 5D ). The increased sensitivity to heat stress in the dpb3-1 mutant indicates a critical role of DPB3-1 in the heat stress response in Arabidopsis .

Next, we analyzed the expression patterns of heat stress-inducible genes in 7-d-old dpb3-1 mutant and wild-type plants during heat stress. The expression levels of the three heat stress-inducible DREB2A target genes, HsfA3 , At1g75860 , and At4g36010 , were reduced in the dpb3-1 mutant compared with the wild type, and the decreases in their expression levels were restored by the expression of DPB3-1 ( Figure 5E ). A similar result was obtained for HsfA2 , which is not a DREB2A target ( Figure 5E ). The levels of the DREB2A transcript and the DREB2A protein during heat stress were not significantly different between the dpb3-1 mutant and wild-type plants ( Figure 5E ; Supplemental Figure 5F ). Moreover, the expression levels of the dehydration-inducible DREB2A target genes RD29A and RD29B did not significantly differ between the dpb3-1 mutant and wild-type plants ( Supplemental Figure 5G ). These results suggest that DPB3-1 is necessary for the full induction of DREB2A target genes specifically under heat stress. Also, they support the idea that DPB3-1 contributes to gene expression under heat stress through multiple pathways, including the DREB2A-dependent pathway. We also analyzed the expression patterns of DREB2A target genes under heat and dehydration stress conditions using 14-d-old plants in which DPB3-1 was more weakly expressed ( Figures 2A to 2H ) and found that the expression levels of these genes were not obviously different between the mutant and wild-type plants under either stress condition ( Supplemental Figure 5H ).

DISCUSSION

Arabidopsis DREB2A is an important transcription factor that specifically activates the expression of dehydration- and heat stress-responsive genes via the DRE sequence in promoters ( Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1994 ; Liu et al., 1998 ; Sakuma et al., 2002 ). The mechanisms that regulate the selective activation of stress-specific target genes by DREB2A remain to be elucidated. In this study, we identified DPB3-1 (NF-YC10), an H2A-like HFD-containing protein, as a potential coactivator of DREB2A that specifically functions under heat stress ( Figure 1B ). Arabidopsis has 14 H2A-like HFD-containing proteins ( Petroni et al., 2012 ), and our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Arabidopsis DPB3-1 belongs to a monophyletic subgroup conserved among land plants ( Supplemental Figure 2C ). This result suggests that DPB3-1 has a unique function among Arabidopsis H2A-like proteins. In accordance with this hypothesis, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that, of the 14 H2A-like proteins, only DPB3-1 showed the clear interaction with DREB2A ( Supplemental Figures 1A and 2D ), although the BiFC experiments suggested the weak interactions between DREB2A and other H2A-like proteins ( Supplemental Figure 11B ). Orthologs of Arabidopsis DPB3-1 in other land plant species might interact with DREB2A homologs and have similar conserved roles.

The DPB3-1 gene was specifically induced by heat stress in 7-d-old plants ( Figure 2K ). This result suggests that DPB3-1 has a heat stress-specific function. The enhanced expression of the heat stress-inducible DREB2A target genes HsfA3 , At1g75860 , and At4g36010 in DPB3-1 -overexpressing Arabidopsis ( Figure 4A ) and the direct binding of the DPB3-1 protein to the corresponding promoters under heat stress ( Figure 4C ) support this hypothesis. Moreover, the knockdown of DPB3-1 resulted in decreased expression of the heat stress-responsive genes of interest in the dpb3-1 mutant ( Figure 5E ). Conversely, the expression levels of the dehydration-inducible DREB2A target genes were not different under dehydration in 35S:DPB3-1 plants or in the dpb3-1 mutant ( Figures 4A ; Supplemental Figure 5G ). These data indicate that DPB3-1 has a positive role in the heat stress response. Together with the interaction between DREB2A and DREB2A-dependent enhancement of the target gene expression ( Supplemental Figures 4C to 4E ), DPB3-1 most likely positively regulates its transcriptional activity specifically under heat stress. Previous studies have suggested that DPB3 family proteins that are associated with DNA polymerase represent part of the histone acetylating complex or the chromatin remodeling complex ( Hartlepp et al., 2005 ; Asturias et al., 2006 ; Wang et al., 2008 ); however, it remains largely unknown whether and how DPB3 is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Here, we found that a DPB3 protein can regulate the activity of a transcription factor in Arabidopsis .

Because the coexpression of the DPB3-1 subunit alone or dimers of the DPB3-1 and H2B-like proteins with DREB2A did not affect the transactivation of the HsfA3 promoter- GUS reporter gene ( Figure 8B ; Supplemental Figure 6D ), we identified the NF-YA2 subunit as a candidate protein that forms a trimer with DPB3-1 and NF-YB3 ( Figure 6C ) and NF-YB3 is encoded by a heat stress-inducible gene ( Figure 6B ). The identified trimer comprising NF-YA2, NF-YB3, and DPB3-1 enhanced HsfA3 promoter transactivation by DREB2A ( Figure 8B ), although this combination of trimer components did not further increase the activity of the RD29A promoter in combination with DREB2A ( Supplemental Figure 10E ). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that this trimer is involved in the heat stress-specific positive regulation of DREB2A. Many studies have shown that a trimer or a subunit of NF-Y is involved in the promoter binding or transcriptional efficiency of specific transcription factors ( Wright et al., 1994 ; Li et al., 1998 ; Yamamoto et al., 2009 ; Liu and Howell, 2010 ; Schiavoni et al., 2010 ; Li et al., 2011 ). Our current results indicated that DPB3 family proteins could also affect gene expression, together with NF-YA and NF-YB subunits. Our data suggest a complex mechanism of H2A/H2B-like HFD-containing proteins in eukaryotic cells involving the possible combination of subunits comprising the protein complex to regulate gene expression levels in cooperation with another transcription factor. The transactivation assay revealed that a CCAAT box was necessary for HsfA3 promoter activation in protoplasts by the trimer of NF-YA2, NF-YB3, and DPB3-1 in protoplasts ( Figure 9B ). Therefore, it is assumed that this trimer of NF-YA2, NF-YB3, and DPB3-1 binds to the CCAAT box as the NF-Y trimer ( Figure 9B ). Analysis of the crystal structure of animal NF-Y trimer on the CCAAT box revealed that the CCAAT motif was mostly recognized by NF-YA and partially by NF-YB ( Nardini et al., 2013 ). Therefore, the DPB3-1 subunit might not critically contribute to the binding of the trimer to the CCAAT motif. Further studies are required to understand the detailed mechanism by which the identified trimer enhances target gene expression.

Interestingly, some of the trimers ( Figure 8D ) containing DPB3-1 did not significantly enhance HsfA3 promoter- GUS reporter gene activation by DREB2A ( Figure 8E ). These analyses provide some suggestive evidence for the existence of a novel and complex relationship among H2A/H2B-like proteins and NF-YA subunits in Arabidopsis . The yeast three-hybrid analysis indicated that a H2A/H2B dimer is selective for NF-YA subunits, although the NF-YA subunits are highly similar to each other in Arabidopsis ( Figure 8D ). A previous study suggested that the NF-YB6/NF-YC3 dimer did not form a trimer with NF-YA2 ( Calvenzani et al., 2012 ), although a recent study indicated that the NF-YB3/NF-YC9 dimer formed a trimer with NF-YA2 ( Hou et al., 2014 ). Additionally, among the H2B-like proteins, DPB4, NC2β1, and NC2β2 did not form trimers with DPB3-1 and NF-YA ( Figure 8D ), suggesting that NF-YB proteins, among the H2B-like proteins, are necessary components in the formation of a trimer containing DPB3-1 and NF-YA. These facts imply that NF-YA subunits exhibit a preference to form trimers. Additionally, our results suggest functional diversity among the differently combined H2A/H2B and NF-YA subunits in land plants. The two types of trimers observed (NF-YA1, NF-YB6, and DPB3-1, and NF-YA4, NF-YB9, and DPB3-1) repressed HsfA3 promoter- GUS reporter activity in protoplasts ( Figure 8E ). Some reports have suggested that NF-Y demonstrates both activation and repression of gene expression ( Willy et al., 2000 ; Dalvai et al., 2011 ; Zhu et al., 2012 ). Therefore, these two trimers, which repressed the HsfA3 promoter- GUS reporter, might function in Arabidopsis under non-heat-stressed conditions or during the attenuation of gene expression to regulate the heat stress-specific expression pattern. Intriguing data have been presented indicating that NF-YA2 overexpression in Arabidopsis enhanced heat stress tolerance; however, a significant number of heat stress-related genes in the MapMan ontology were repressed under the nonstress condition ( Leyva-González et al., 2012 ). Some transcriptional complexes, including NF-YA2, might also repress the expression of heat stress-inducible genes under non-stress conditions. Upregulated genes in NF-YA2 -overexpressing plants under nonstress conditions did not overlap with those in DPB3-1 -overexpressing plants under heat stress conditions: This difference might result from the presence or absence of the heat stress. Moreover, our three-hybrid analysis revealed that NF-YB9 and NF-YB6 formed different trimers with DPB3-1 and NF-YA subunits ( Figure 8D ). The NF-YB9 and NF-YB6 genes (alias LEAFY COTYLEDON1 and LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE , respectively) are reportedly required for development during the early and late phases of embryogenesis ( Lotan et al., 1998 ; Kwong et al., 2003 ). According to the plant microarray database (Genevestigator; https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/ ), DPB3 -1 is also expressed strongly in embryos. These results suggest that DPB3-1 might act in concert with NF-YB9 and NF-YB6 during embryogenesis.

Our microarray analysis of the 35S:DPB3-1 plants confirmed that some DREB2A target genes are upregulated upon heat stress ( Supplemental Data Set 2 ), and the enhanced expression of those genes was confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR ( Figure 4B ). However, several heat stress-inducible genes that were not DREB2A targets were also identified as potential downstream of DPB3-1 ( Supplemental Data Set 2 ). Interestingly, the expression of HsfA2 was enhanced in the 35S:DPB3-1 plants, while it was reduced in the dpb3-1 mutant ( Figures 4B and 5E ). Moreover, ChIP assays confirmed the direct binding of DPB3-1 to the HsfA2 promoter under heat stress ( Figure 4C ). Previous studies have revealed that HsfA2 is a major transcription factor that regulates numerous target genes in response to heat stress and that HsfA2 is not a DREB2A target gene ( Sakuma et al., 2006b ). Instead, it is induced by HsfA1 master transcription factors in response to heat shock ( Yoshida et al., 2011 ). Therefore, instead of the effects on DREB2A, DPB3-1 (NF-YC10) may positively regulate the expression of HsfA2 together with HsfA1s. Other studies in human and other animal cells suggested that an NF-Y trimer induces the transcription of heat stress-inducible genes together with heat shock factors ( Li et al., 1998 ; Imbriano et al., 2001 ; Sasi et al., 2014 ). Further analysis is necessary to confirm whether Arabidopsis DPB3-1 and other NF-Y subunits form a transcriptional complex with HsfA1s to regulate HsfA2 expression.

Consistent with the increased expression levels of the various heat stress-inducible genes in the DPB3-1 -overexpressing Arabidopsis , these transgenic plants showed significantly enhanced heat stress tolerance ( Figure 3E ). Moreover, DPB3-1 -overexpressing plants did not exhibit any growth retardation compared with the wild-type plants under normal conditions ( Figures 3B to 3D ; Supplemental Figures 3C and 3D ). The overexpression of transcription factors that have constitutive activity, such as DREB1A, DREB2A CA, and HsfA2, often causes severe growth retardation under normal conditions ( Liu et al., 1998 ; Sakuma et al., 2006a ; Ogawa et al., 2007 ). Therefore, the application of these strong transcription factors to the molecular breeding of crops requires an optimized stress-inducible promoter for the control of gene expression to minimize negative effects on plant growth ( Kim et al., 2003 ; Sakuma et al., 2006a ; Nakashima et al., 2007 ; Pino et al., 2007 ). However, the optimization of stress-inducible promoters for each gene and plant species is time-consuming. Due to its simplicity, the overexpression of DPB3-1 or its orthologs could be a useful strategy for generating stress-tolerant crops. According to the plant microarray database (Genevestigator; https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/ ), a DPB3-1 ortholog in O. sativa , LOC_Os03g63530 ( OsDPB3-2 ), is also induced upon heat stress (>3-fold change; P < 0.001).

Although our study strongly suggests that DPB3-1 enhances the transactivation of target promoters by DREB2A and raises the possibility that the trimer of NF-YA2, NF-YB3, and DPB3-1 forms a transcriptional complex with DREB2A specifically under heat stress, further analysis is necessary to elucidate the detailed mechanisms. First, the mechanisms underlying the dehydration stress-specific target gene expression of DREB2A remain unknown. It is possible that another combination of a trimer or enhancers other than H2A/H2B-like proteins may regulate dehydration stress-specific target gene expression. Recent studies revealed the cell type-specific expression of enhancers and cell type-specific chromatin connectivity and suggested the existence of cell type-specific transcriptional complexes in human and mouse cells ( Jin et al., 2013 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ; Andersson et al., 2014 ). Future research should focus on the identification of various stress-specific transcriptional complexes in eukaryotes, including Arabidopsis . In addition, the detailed mechanisms by which the identified trimer enhanced the transcriptional activity of DREB2A were not elucidated. The overexpression of DPB3-1 did not affect the amount of protein accumulation or DNA binding activity of DREB2A ( Supplemental Figures 4 and 4F ). Therefore, the trimer may enhance the transcriptional efficiency of DREB2A via other mechanisms. One possibility is that the identified trimer regulates histone modifications for gene activation. DPB3/DPB4 family proteins are reportedly components of the histone-acetylating complex ( Wang et al., 2008 ) and exhibit nucleosome remodeling activity ( Hartlepp et al., 2005 ). Additionally, NF-Y trimers have been suggested to act in concert with a histone acetyltransferase ( Li et al., 1998 ; Caretti et al., 2003 ; Peng et al., 2007 ), affecting the acetylation of histone H2A.Z on promoters ( Li et al., 1998 ; Caretti et al., 2003 ; Peng et al., 2007 ; Gatta and Mantovani, 2011 ). Moreover, a recent study revealed that a NF-Y trimer is also involved in histone methylation to regulate the target gene expression of a transcription factor ( Hou et al., 2014 ). Therefore, further study is required to reveal the regulation of histone modifications during drought or heat stress responses.

Figure 9C shows our current model. When Arabidopsis cells receive a heat stress signal, the expression levels of the DREB2A , DPB3-1 , and NF-YB3 genes are increased. In addition, the stress signal also induces the stabilization of DREB2A and the nuclear translocation of NF-YB3. NF-YB3 and DPB3-1 form a trimer with NF-YA2 in the nucleus, and the trimer comprises a transcriptional complex with stabilized DREB2A on the promoters of target genes. We also hypothesize that DPB3-1 might be involved in the induction of the HsfA2 gene, which is mainly controlled by the HsfA1 transcription factors, and that the CCAAT box on the target promoter has an important role for gene induction. Thus, DPB3-1 enhances the induction of heat-inducible genes and contributes to the acquisition of heat stress tolerance. In conclusion, we found that DPB3-1 is a DREB2A-interacting factor and identified the candidate trimer that regulates heat stress-specific target gene expression of DREB2A. Our findings provide insight into the elaborate mechanisms that regulate stress-specific gene expression through the formation of a specific transcriptional complex.
