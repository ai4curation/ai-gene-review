CIN85 is a multi-adaptor protein involved in different cellular functions 
including the down-regulation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases and 
survival of neuronal cells. CIN85 contains three SH3 domains that specifically 
bind a unique proline-arginine motif (PxxxPR) found in several CIN85 effectors. 
In this report, we show that the MAP kinase kinase kinase MEKK4 is a new 
CIN85-interacting partner. This interaction is mediated by the engagement of the 
SH3 domains of CIN85 to three PxxxPR motifs located within MEKK4 sequence. By 
disrupting this interaction we demonstrated that CIN85 binding to MEKK4 enhances 
the activation of MKK6 and of the downstream p38 MAP kinase following oxidative 
stress and growth factor stimulation. CIN85 was also shown to regulate the 
activation of MEKK4 by GADD45 proteins and promote multi-ubiquitination of 
MEKK4. Taken together, these results indicate a novel role for CIN85 in the 
regulation of cellular stress response via the MAPK pathways.
