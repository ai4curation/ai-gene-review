FoxO1 and FoxO3a (collectively FoxO1/3a) proteins regulate a wide array of 
cellular processes, including hepatic gluconeogenesis. Phosphorylation of 
FoxO1/3a is a key event that determines its subcellular location and 
transcriptional activity. During glucose synthesis, the activity of FoxO1/3a is 
negatively regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation, which leads to the 
cytoplasmic retention of FoxO1/3a. However, the nuclear phosphatase that 
directly regulates FoxO1/3a remains to be identified. In this study, we 
discovered a nuclear phosphatase, SCP4/CTDSPL2 (SCP4), that dephosphorylated 
FoxO1/3a and promoted FoxO1/3a transcription activity. We found that SCP4 
enhanced the transcription of FoxO1/3a target genes encoding PEPCK1 and G6PC, 
key enzymes in hepatic gluconeogenesis. Ectopic expression of SCP4 increased, 
while knockdown of SCP4 inhibited, glucose production. Moreover, we demonstrated 
that gene ablation of SCP4 led to hypoglycemia in neonatal mice. Consistent with 
the positive role of SCP4 in gluconeogenesis, expression of SCP4 was regulated 
under pathophysiological conditions. SCP4 expression was induced by glucose 
deprivation in vitro and in vivo and was elevated in obese mice caused by 
genetic (Avy) and dietary (high-fat) changes. Thus, our findings provided 
experimental evidence that SCP4 regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis and could 
serve as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of diet-induced 
glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes.
