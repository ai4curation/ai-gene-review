Extended longevity is often correlated with increased resistance against various 
stressors. Insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) is known to have a conserved role 
in aging and cellular mechanisms against stress. In C. elegans, genetic studies 
suggest that heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 is required for IIS to 
modulate longevity. Here, we report that the activity of HSF-1 is regulated by 
IIS. This regulation occurs at an early step of HSF-1 activation via two HSF-1 
regulators, DDL-1 and DDL-2. Inhibition of DDL-1/2 increases longevity and 
thermotolerance in an hsf-1-dependent manner. Furthermore, biochemical analyses 
suggest that DDL-1/2 negatively regulate HSF-1 activity by forming a protein 
complex with HSF-1. The formation of this complex (DHIC) is affected by the 
phosphorylation status of DDL-1. Both the formation of DHIC and the 
phosphorylation of DDL-1 are controlled by IIS. Our findings point to DDL-1/2 as 
a link between IIS and the HSF-1 pathway.
