The expression of numerous Escherichia coli cellular proteins was previously 
demonstrated to be greatly enhanced in a hns deletion background, relative to 
the levels in wild-type cells. In this study, a subset of such proteins, 
expression of which is affected by H-NS, was partially purified, and the genes 
coding for some of the proteins were identified and characterized. Two of the 
proteins thus characterized, 19K and 17K, were found to be encoded by previously 
predicted genes that are located adjacent to, and downstream of, the trpABCDE 
operon (27.6 min on the E. coli genetic map). The genes coding for the other two 
proteins, 10K-L and 10K-S, are located at 77.5 min on the genetic map. Their 
nucleotide sequences were determined and revealed that they may constitute an 
operon. To characterize the putative promoters for these genes, a set of 
promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusion genes was constructed on the E. coli 
chromosome. The results of such promoter-probe analyses indicated that H-NS 
represses the expression of these genes at the transcriptional level. 
Furthermore, H-NS appeared to exhibit relatively strong affinity for the 
putative promoter sequences in vitro. These results are compatible with the 
hypothesis that H-NS functions as a transcriptional repressor.
