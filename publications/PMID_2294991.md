gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase is one of the enzymes of glutathione (GSH) 
synthesis. A deficiency of this enzyme has been found only once previously in 
humans: it was associated with spinocerebellar degeneration and hemolytic 
anemia. We report the case of a woman, daughter of fifth cousins, who was 
gamma-glutamylcysteine-synthetase-deficient. Modest decreases in the amount of 
GSH in cultured lymphoblasts and fibroblasts could be documented. The amount of 
residual enzyme was insufficient to permit detailed studies of the 
characteristics of the mutant enzymes, but no major abnormality in its Km for 
cysteine and glutamic acid or in its heat stability were found. In contrast to 
the earlier report, the only manifestation of the enzyme deficiency was 
hemolytic anemia. This leads us to conclude that either the occurrence of 
neurologic symptoms in the other reported family was a chance association or 
that the clinical expression of this rare defect is pleomorphic.
