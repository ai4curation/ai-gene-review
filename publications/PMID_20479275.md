In mammals, Up-frameshift proteins (UPFs) form a surveillance complex that 
interacts with the exon junction complex (EJC) to elicit nonsense-mediated mRNA 
decay (NMD). UPF3b is the component of the surveillance complex that bridges the 
interaction with the EJC. Here, we report the 3.4 A resolution crystal structure 
of a minimal UPF3b-EJC assembly, consisting of the interacting domains of five 
proteins (UPF3b, MAGO, Y14, eIF4AIII, and Barentsz) together with RNA and 
adenylyl-imidodiphosphate. Human UPF3b binds with the C-terminal domain 
stretched over a composite surface formed by eIF4AIII, MAGO, and Y14. Residues 
that affect NMD when mutated are found at the core interacting surfaces, whereas 
differences between UPF3b and UPF3a map at peripheral interacting residues. 
Comparison with the binding mode of the protein PYM underscores how a common 
molecular surface of MAGO and Y14 recognizes different proteins acting at 
different times in the same pathway. The binding mode to eIF4AIII identifies a 
surface hot spot that is used by different DEAD-box proteins to recruit their 
regulators.
