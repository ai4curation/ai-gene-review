The zinc finger protein A20 is encoded by an immediate early response gene and 
acts as an inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent gene expression 
induced by different stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) 
and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 have been 
found to transduce, respectively, peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) signals for the activation of NF-kappaB and the production of inflammatory 
cytokines. Here, we have examined the role of A20 in TLR-mediated 
NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in human airway epithelial cells (AECs). 
Stimulation with LPS and PGN resulted in a significant increase in the level of 
A20 mRNA in primary cultured AECs and in NCI-H292 AECs. LPS and PGN induced 
activation of the IL-8 promoter both in NCI-H292 AECs and in HEK293 cells 
expressing either TLR2 or TLR4 plus MD-2. Dominant-negative myeloid 
differentiation protein and a mutant form of IkappaBalpha attenuated this PGN- 
or LPS-induced activation of the IL-8 promoter. Furthermore, overexpression of 
A20 inhibited activation of both NF-kappaB and the IL-8 promoter by PGN or LPS 
in these cells. Taken together, our results suggest that A20 may function as a 
negative regulator of TLR-mediated inflammatory responses in the airway, thereby 
protecting the host against harmful overresponses to pathogens.
