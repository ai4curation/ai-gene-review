The FOXO (Forkhead box class O) subgroup of forkhead transcription factors 
controls the expression of many genes involved in fundamental cellular 
processes. Until recently, studies conducted on posttranslational modifications 
of Forkhead proteins were restricted to their phosphorylation. In this report, 
we show that the coactivator p300 directly acetylates lysines in the 
carboxyl-terminal region of Foxo1 in vivo and in vitro, and potently stimulates 
Foxo1-induced transcription of IGF-binding protein-1 in transient transfection 
experiments. The intrinsic acetyltransferase activity of p300 is required for 
both activities. Our results suggest that acetylation of Foxo1 by p300 is 
responsible, at least in part, for its increased transactivation potency, 
although acetylation of histones cannot be excluded. Insulin, the major negative 
regulator of Foxo1-stimulated transcription, potently enhances p300 acetylation 
of Foxo1. Three consensus protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation sites whose 
phosphorylation is stimulated by insulin are required for insulin-induced 
acetylation of Foxo1. In contrast to its importance in regulating the 
transcriptional activity of Foxo1 in the absence of insulin, acetylation plays 
only a minor role compared with phosphorylation in insulin inhibition of Foxo1 
transcriptional activity.
