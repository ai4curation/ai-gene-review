In cytokinesis, there is a lengthy interval between cleavage furrow ingression 
and abscission, during which the midbody microtubule bundle provides both 
structural support for a narrow intercellular bridge and a platform that 
orchestrates the biochemical preparations for abscission. It is currently 
unclear how the midbody structure is stably maintained during this period. Here, 
we report a novel role for the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) GTPase in the 
post-mitotic stabilisation of midbody. Centralspindlin kinesin-6/RhoGAP complex, 
a midbody component critical for both the formation and function of the midbody, 
assembles in a sharp band at the centre of the structure in a manner antagonised 
by 14-3-3 protein. We show that ARF6 competes with 14-3-3 for binding to 
centralspindlin such that midbodies formed by centralspindlin mutants that can 
bind 14-3-3 but not ARF6 frequently collapse before abscission. These data 
indicate a novel mechanism for the regulation of midbody dynamics in which ARF6 
protects the compacted centralspindlin assembly from dissipation by 14-3-3.
