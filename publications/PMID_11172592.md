We have analyzed by immunohistochemistry Brca1 and Brca2 protein expression in 
mouse during embryonic development, in adult tissues, and during postnatal 
mammary gland development. Our observations confirm previous localization of 
Brca1 and Brca2 mRNA on frozen sections by in situ hybridization, and 
demonstrate that Brca1 and Brca2 proteins are expressed in rapidly proliferating 
cell types undergoing differentiation. These results imply that Brca1 and Brca2 
proteins are involved in the process of proliferation and differentiation in 
multiple tissues, notably in the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation.
