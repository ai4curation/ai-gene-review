The role of dopamine in the production of behaviour is multifarious in that it 
can influence different aspects of movement (e.g. movement initiation, 
sensorimotor integration, and movement sequencing). A characteristic of the 
dopamine system which seems to be critical for the expression of this diverse 
influence is its varied receptor population. Previous studies have shown that 
specific receptor subtype activation leads to specific behavioural responses or 
alterations of selective aspects of movement. It is known that one of the 
important influences of dopamine includes sequential co-ordination of 
'syntactic' patterns of grooming movements because moderate loss of the 
dopaminergic nigrostriatal projections specifically disrupts these patterns 
without affecting grooming actions in a general fashion (Berridge, K.C. 
Psychobiology, 15, 336, 1989). The specific receptors of the dopamine family 
which play a key part in this co-ordination of movement sequences is not known. 
In the present study, we examined the serial order of particular syntactic 
sequences or chains of grooming actions in mice lacking D1A receptors to explore 
the relationship between this receptor subtype and movement sequencing. Mutant 
mice had shorter grooming bouts and a disruption of the organization of 
sequential patterns compared with wild-type littermate controls. Sequential 
disruption was reflected in the failure of D1A mutants to follow the syntactic 
pattern of grooming to completion. This sequential disruption deficit appeared 
to be specific, as mutant mice initiated more syntactic chains than wild-type 
controls even though they were less likely to complete them. These results 
support the hypothesis that D1A receptor activation plays a part in the 
sequencing of natural action. This conclusion has important implications for the 
understanding of the functional heterogeneity of dopamine receptor subtypes and 
of the aetiology of symptoms observed in patients with basal ganglia disease.
