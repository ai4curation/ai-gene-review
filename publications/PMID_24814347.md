Abstract

Under conditions of genotoxic stress, human p53 activates the apoptotic effectors BAX or BAK, resulting in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BCL-xL opposes this activity by sequestering cytosolic p53 via association with its DNA-binding domain, an interaction that is enhanced by p53 tetramerization. Here we characterized the BCL-xL – p53 complex using NMR spectroscopy and modulated it through mutagenesis to determine the relative contributions of BCL-xL’s interactions with p53, or with other BCL-2 family proteins, to BCL-xL-dependent inhibition of UV irradiation-induced apoptosis. Under our experimental conditions, one third of the anti-apoptotic activity of BCL-xL was mediated by p53 sequestration and the remaining two thirds through sequestration of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. Our studies define the contributions of cytosolic p53 to UV irradiation-induced apoptosis and provide opportunities to explore its contributions to other, p53-dependent apoptotic signaling pathways.

INTRODUCTION

The tumor suppressor p53 exhibits a subset of cytosolic functions, independent of nuclear transactivation, including activation of apoptosis through interactions with the apoptotic effector proteins BAX and BAK 1 . Activated effectors form oligomers within and permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), resulting in the release of cytochrome c and other signaling molecules and induction of apoptosis 2 , 3 .

Effector activation is antagonized through sequestration of cytosolic p53 by the anti-apoptotic BCL-xL 1 , 4 . BCL-xL and homolog proteins also sequester “BH3-only” pro-apoptotic proteins (BID, BIM) that can also activate BAX and BAK. These proteins are down-regulated in inhibitory complexes when their BH3 domains fold into α-helices and bind a hydrophobic groove within BCL-xL 5 – 8 . Unlike other interaction partners of BCL-xL, p53 does not exhibit a BH3 domain 9 , suggesting that the BCL-xL – p53 complex differs from those between BCL-xL and BH3-only proteins or between p53 and Mdm2 10 .

Full-length p53 is a multi-domain, tetrameric protein 11 ( Fig. 1 ). Studies with individual p53 domains indicate that the DNA-binding domain (p53 DBD) contributes predominantly to BCL-xL binding 12 – 15 without engaging the hydrophobic groove that is the binding site for BH3-only proteins 12 – 15 . While lacking a BH3 domain, p53 contains two transactivation domains (TAD1, residues 15–30; TAD2, residues 50–65) within its N-terminus (p53 NTD) that fold into amphipathic α–helices upon complex formation 10 , 16 , 17 and bind weakly to the BH3 groove of BCL-xL 18 – 20 . However, how NTD and DBD cooperate when full-length p53 binds to BCL-xL is not understood. Here, we endeavored to characterize the interaction of near full-length, tetrameric p53 with BCL-xL and elucidate the thermodynamic interplay between p53 domains upon binding BCL-xL. Using NMR spectroscopy, we determined the solution structure of the BCL-xL – p53 DBD complex and characterized the same interactions in the context of tetrameric p53. Our results confirmed that the BCL-xL-binding surface of p53 DBD largely overlaps with its DNA-binding surface 12 and explained BCL-xL binding specificity. Using mutagenesis, we identified sites within p53 DBD that contribute primarily to BCL-xL binding or to both BCL-xL and DNA binding, providing opportunities to dissect p53’s nuclear and cytosolic functions. The diverse regulatory functions of p53, ranging from cell cycle arrest 21 to senescence 22 and apoptosis 23 , are mediated by promiscuous interactions of its individual domains with other proteins and DNA. The p53 DBD contributes to this hub-like behavior, by binding to double-stranded DNA, BCL-xL, and other proteins 24 , 25 . Our studies reveal the mechanism by which BCL-xL binds the same surface of p53 DBD that has evolved to also bind a diverse family of DNA gene regulatory sites.

DISCUSSION

Past studies of BCL-xL – p53 interactions have dealt with individual p53 domains 12 – 15 , 18 – 20 without addressing how they synergize within the full-length protein to engage BCL-xL. Our results confirm that p53 DBD is thermodynamically dominant in mediating binding to BCL-xL, and show that, while p53 NTD interacts weakly with the BH3 groove of BCL-xL, as previously reported 18 – 20 , it does not synergize with other domains to enhance BCL-xL binding. Tetramerization of p53, however, indirectly enhances binding to BCL-xL by increasing the local concentration of DBDs. Our determination of the solution structure of the BCL-xLΔC – p53 DBD complex reveals the molecular basis for sequestration of p53 by BCL-xL to inhibit BAX-BAK activation. This knowledge empowered the elucidation of differential roles of BCL-xL in regulating apoptosis through protein-protein interactions mediated by its BH3-binding groove and its p53-binding surface. The interface between the two proteins buries 1821 Å 2 of surface area, dominated by charged and hydrophilic (1076 Å 2 ) versus hydrophobic (745 Å 2 ) amino acids. This situation arises because the BCL-xL surface recognizes the same region of p53 DBD utilized for binding DNA 33 . While BCL-xL does not structurally mimic duplex DNA, charged residues on its surface engage p53 DBD residues that make contacts with bases or phosphate groups of promoter DNA. The electrostatic nature of the interaction patch that overlaps with the p53 DNA-binding surface, as well as contacts involving the Zn 2+ coordination site in p53 and acidic residues in BCL-xL, result in a low interface hydrophobicity (−0.43 Kcal/residue calculated solvation energy, versus an average value of −0.26 Kcal/mol for heterodimeric complexes) 51 . These results define the structural and functional roles of different p53 domains in binding to BCL-xL.

The p53 DBD surface that engages BCL-xL is larger than that utilized to bind DNA, suggesting that it was possible to modulate this interaction through p53 DBD mutagenesis without abrogating DNA binding. Efforts to selectively eliminate BCL-xL binding through mutagenesis, however, were confounded by additional effects on protein stability and/or other interactions mediated by the same region of p53 24 , 25 . Additional functions affected may include the activation of BAX or BAK, previously reported to engage the DNA-binding domain of p53 13 . Despite this caveat, the slightly higher levels of apoptosis induced by the D186A mutant, which is released from BCL-xL, reinforces the role of BCL-xL as an inhibitor of p53’s cytosolic, pro-apoptotic activity. This result suggests that decreased BCL-xL sequestration of this mutant compensates for its partial impairment in activation of both transcription and BAX, leading to efficient induction of apoptosis.

In contrast to the complexities associated with selectively disrupting p53 binding to BCL-xL, structure-based mutagenesis of BCL-xL selectively disrupted BCL-xL – p53 binding in vitro and in cells, and enhanced p53-dependent apoptosis without disrupting BCL-xL’s functions associated with sequestration of BH3 domains 33 . In the absence of ABT-737, the equivalent inhibitory activities of wild-type and mutant BCL-xL constructs against BH3 domains overrode their differential ability to bind and sequester UV-activated p53. In the presence of ABT-737 these anti-apoptotic activities were inhibited, to reveal the differential p53 binding-related, anti-apoptotic functions of wild-type versus mutant BCL-xL. In cells expressing wild-type BCL-xL, capable of sequestering cytosolic p53, addition of ABT-737 was insufficient to abrogate its protective effects against UV-induced apoptosis. However, BCL-xL mutants with impaired p53 binding displayed markedly impaired anti-apoptotic effects. These results underscore the activity of cytosolic p53 to mediate UV-induced apoptosis and the ability of BCL-xL to oppose this activity.

The BCL-xL – p53 DBD structure expands our understanding of p53 DBD’s binding and functional versatility: this domain exploits the same surfaces to bind diverse protein partners (e.g., BCL-xL, 53BP1 43 , 53BP2 44 , and sv40 45 ) or target DNA in different regulatory contexts. It is fascinating that the DBD, long thought to dominate p53’s tumor suppressor functions through its nuclear gene regulatory activity 21 , 22 , 23 , 52 , is also an instrument of apoptotic regulation in the cytosol. We have characterized the structural details of p53’s interaction with BCL-xL and the role this interaction plays in restraining UV- and p53-dependent BAX activation and apoptosis. Our data show that p53 functionally interacts with BAX, as shown previously 2 , but molecular details of these interactions are poorly understood. Future studies into the structural basis of this interaction, as well as that with the other apoptotic effector, BAK, will provide deeper understanding of p53’s cytosolic, apoptotic regulatory network and its contributions to tumor suppression.
