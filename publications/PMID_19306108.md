Arylsulfatase B (ASB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase; 4-sulfatase; ARSB) is 
the enzyme that removes 4-sulfate groups from N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate, 
which combines with glucuronate to form the disaccharide unit of 
chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S). In this study, we report how variation in 
expression of ASB affected the migration of human colonic epithelial cells. In 
the T84 cell line, derived from lung metastasis of malignant colonic epithelial 
cells, the activity of ASB, as well as steroid sulfatase, arylsulfatase A, and 
galactose-6-sulfatase, were significantly less than in normal, primary colonic 
epithelial cells and in the NCM460 cell line which was derived from normal 
colonocytes. In the T84 cells, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), activated 
RhoA, and cell migration, as well as C4S content, were significantly more than 
in the NCM460 cells. Silencing and overexpression of ASB had inverse effects on 
MMP9, activated RhoA, and cell migration, as well as the C4S content, in the 
NCM460 and T84 cells. When ASB expression was silenced by siRNA in the NCM460 
cells, MMP9 secretion increased to over 3 times the basal level, activated RhoA 
increased * 85%, and cell migration increased * 52%. Following overexpression of 
ASB, MMP9 declined 51%, activated RhoA declined * 51%, and cell migration 
decreased * 37%. These findings demonstrate marked effects of ASB expression on 
the migratory activity of colonic epithelial cells, activated RhoA, and MMP9, 
and suggest a potential vital role of ASB, due to its impact on chondroitin 
sulfation, on determination of the invasive phenotype of colonic epithelial 
cells.
