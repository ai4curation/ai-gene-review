Phytochromes are red and far-red photoreceptors that regulate plant growth and 
development in response to environmental light cues. Phytochromes exist in two 
photo-interconvertible conformational states: an inactive Pr form and an active 
Pfr form. The alteration of phytochromes' subcellular location functions as a 
major regulatory mechanism of their biological activities. Whereas phytochromes 
in the Pr form localize in the cytoplasm, phytochromes in the Pfr form 
accumulate in the nucleus, where they interact with transcription factors to 
regulate gene expression. The molecular details of the regulation of phytochrome 
translocation by light are poorly understood. Using Arabidopsis phyB as a model, 
we demonstrate that the C-terminal PAS-related domain (PRD) is both necessary 
and sufficient for phyB nuclear import and that the entire C terminus is 
required for nuclear-body (NB) localization. We also show that phyB's N-terminal 
bilin lyase domain (BLD) and PHY domain interact directly with the PRD in a 
light-dependent manner. In vivo localization studies indicate that BLD-PHY is 
sufficient to regulate phyB's nuclear accumulation. For phyB nuclear 
localization, our results suggest a molecular mechanism in which the 
nuclear-localization signal in the PRD is masked by interactions with phyB's 
chromophore-attachment domains and unmasked by light-dependent conformational 
changes.
