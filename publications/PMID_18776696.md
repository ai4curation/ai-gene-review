Human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) 
dependent beta-replacement reaction to synthesize cystathionine from serine and 
homocysteine. The enzyme is unique in bearing not only a catalytically important 
PLP but also heme. In order to study a regulatory process mediated by heme, we 
performed mutagenesis of Arg-51 and Arg-224, which have hydrogen-bonding 
interactions with propionate side chains of the prosthetic group. It was found 
that the arginine mutations decrease CBS activity by approximately 50%. The 
results indicate that structural changes in the heme vicinity are transmitted to 
PLP existing 20 A away from heme. A possible explanation of our results is 
discussed on the basis of CBS structure.
