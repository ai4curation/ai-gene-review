Sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism in the gut may have an impact on colon cancer 
development. In this study, we purified alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase) 
from human intestinal content, and studied its location in the mucosa, 
expression in colon cancer, and function on colon cancer cells. The enzyme was 
purified by a series of chromatographies. The molecular mass of the enzyme is 60 
kDa, optimal pH is 8.5, and isoelectric point is 6.6. Under optimal conditions, 
1 mg of the enzyme hydrolyzed 11 mM SM per hour. The properties of the enzyme 
are similar to those of rat intestinal alk-SMase but not to those of bacterial 
neutral SMase. Immunogold electronmicroscopy identified the enzyme on the 
microvillar membrane in endosome-like structures and in the Golgi complexes of 
human enterocytes. The expression and the activity of the enzyme were decreased 
in parallel in human colon cancer tissues compared with the adjacent normal 
tissue. The enzyme inhibited DNA biosynthesis and cell proliferation dose 
dependently and caused a reduction of SM in HT29 cells. Intestinal alk-SMase is 
localized in the enterocytes, down-regulated in human colon cancer, and may have 
antiproliferative effects on colon cancer cells.
