Increases in p53 protein levels after DNA damage have largely been attributed to 
an increase in the half-life of p53 protein. Here we demonstrate that increased 
translation of p53 mRNA is also a critical step in the induction of p53 protein 
in irradiated cells. Ribosomal protein L26 (RPL26) and nucleolin were found to 
bind to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of p53 mRNA and to control p53 
translation and induction after DNA damage. RPL26 preferentially binds to the 
5'UTR after DNA damage, and its overexpression enhances association of p53 mRNA 
with heavier polysomes, increases the rate of p53 translation, induces G1 
cell-cycle arrest, and augments irradiation-induced apoptosis. Opposite effects 
were seen when RPL26 expression was inhibited. In contrast, nucleolin 
overexpression suppresses p53 translation and induction after DNA damage, 
whereas nucleolin downregulation promotes p53 expression. These findings 
demonstrate the importance of increased translation of p53 in DNA-damage 
responses and suggest critical roles for RPL26 and nucleolin in affecting p53 
induction.
