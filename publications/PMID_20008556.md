Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are integral to the mechanisms by 
which cells respond to physiological stimuli and a wide variety of environmental 
stresses. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the stress response is controlled by a 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-like MAPK signaling pathway, which is regulated by 
MLK-1 MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), MEK-1 MAPKK, and KGB-1 JNK-like MAPK. In this 
study, we identify the max-2 gene encoding a C. elegans Ste20-related protein 
kinase as a component functioning upstream of the MLK-1-MEK-1-KGB-1 pathway. The 
max-2 loss-of-function mutation is defective in activation of KGB-1, resulting 
in hypersensitivity to heavy metals. Biochemical analysis reveals that MAX-2 
activates MLK-1 through direct phosphorylation of a specific residue in the 
activation loop of the MLK-1 kinase domain. Our genetic data presented here also 
show that MIG-2 small GTPase functions upstream of MAX-2 in the KGB-1 pathway. 
These results suggest that MAX-2 and MIG-2 play a crucial role in mediating the 
heavy metal stress response regulated by the KGB-1 pathway.
