Laminin-nidogen complex. Extraction with chelating agents and structural 
characterization.

Large quantities of intact laminin-nidogen complex could be extracted from a 
mouse tumor basement membrane with a physiological buffer containing EDTA. 
Analysis of the purified complex demonstrated that the two proteins occur in an 
equimolar ratio and that anchoring of these complexes to the extracellular 
matrix requires divalent cations. Reversible dissociation of the complex was 
achieved with 2 M guanidine X HCl and has been used for purification of the 
individual components. Electron microscopy and binding studies using laminin 
fragments demonstrated that nidogen interacts specifically with the center of 
the cross-shaped laminin molecule as represented by the short-arm structure 
fragment 1. The complex was also useful to confirm and refine a previously 
proposed dumb-bell structure of nidogen and to prepare and characterize the 
cell-binding fragment 8 from the long arm of laminin.
