Transcription of the four yeast histone gene pairs (HTA1-HTB1, HTA2-HTB2, 
HHT1-HHF1, and HHT2-HHF2) is repressed during G1, G2, and M. For all except 
HTA2-HTB2, this repression requires several trans-acting factors, including the 
products of the HIR genes, HIR1, HIR2, and HIR3. ASF1 is a highly conserved 
protein that has been implicated in transcriptional silencing and chromatin 
assembly. In this analysis, we show that HIR1 interacts with ASF1 in a 
two-hybrid analysis. Further, asf1 mutants, like hir mutants, are defective in 
repression of histone gene transcription during the cell cycle and in cells 
arrested in early S phase in response to hydroxyurea. asf1 and hir1 mutations 
also show very similar synergistic interactions with mutations in cac2, a 
subunit of the yeast chromatin assembly factor CAF-I. The results suggest that 
ASF1 and HIR1 function in the same pathway to create a repressive chromatin 
structure in the histone genes during the cell cycle.
