Maintaining proper mRNA levels is a key aspect in the regulation of gene 
expression. The balance between mRNA synthesis and decay determines these 
levels. We demonstrate that most yeast mRNAs are degraded by the cytoplasmic 
5'-to-3' pathway (the "decaysome"), as proposed previously. Unexpectedly, the 
level of these mRNAs is highly robust to perturbations in this major pathway 
because defects in various decaysome components lead to transcription 
downregulation. Moreover, these components shuttle between the cytoplasm and the 
nucleus, in a manner dependent on proper mRNA degradation. In the nucleus, they 
associate with chromatin-preferentially ∼30 bp upstream of transcription 
start-sites-and directly stimulate transcription initiation and elongation. The 
nuclear role of the decaysome in transcription is linked to its cytoplasmic role 
in mRNA decay; linkage, in turn, seems to depend on proper shuttling of its 
components. The gene expression process is therefore circular, whereby the 
hitherto first and last stages are interconnected.
