Most Ty1 retrotransposons in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are 
transpositionally competent but rarely transpose. We screened yeast mutagenized 
by insertion of the mTn3-lacZ/LEU2 transposon for mutations that result in 
elevated Ty1 cDNA-mediated mobility, which occurs by cDNA integration or 
recombination. Here, we describe the characterization of mTn3 insertions in 21 
RTT (regulation of Ty1 transposition) genes that result in 5- to 111-fold 
increases in Ty1 mobility. These 21 RTT genes are EST2, RRM3, NUT2, RAD57, RRD2, 
RAD50, SGS1, TEL1, SAE2, MED1, MRE11, SCH9, KAP122, and 8 previously 
uncharacterized genes. Disruption of RTT genes did not significantly increase 
Ty1 RNA levels but did enhance Ty1 cDNA levels, suggesting that most RTT gene 
products act at a step after mRNA accumulation but before cDNA integration. The 
rtt mutations had widely varying effects on integration of Ty1 at preferred 
target sites. Mutations in RTT101 and NUT2 dramatically stimulated Ty1 
integration upstream of tRNA genes. In contrast, a mutation in RRM3 increased 
Ty1 mobility >100-fold without increasing integration upstream of tRNA genes. 
The regulation of Ty1 transposition by components of fundamental pathways 
required for genome maintenance suggests that Ty1 and yeast have coevolved to 
link transpositional dormancy to the integrity of the genome.
