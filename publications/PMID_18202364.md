Adhesins play a central role in the cellular response of eukaryotic 
microorganisms to their host environment. In pathogens such as Candida spp. and 
other fungi, adhesins are responsible for adherence to mammalian tissues, and in 
Saccharomyces spp. yeasts also confer adherence to solid surfaces and to other 
yeast cells. The analysis of FLO11, the main adhesin identified in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, has revealed complex mechanisms, involving both genetic and 
epigenetic regulation, governing the expression of this critical gene. We 
designed a genomewide screen to identify new regulators of this pivotal adhesin 
in budding yeasts. We took advantage of a specific FLO11 allele that confers 
very high levels of FLO11 expression to wild "flor" strains of S. cerevisiae. We 
screened for mutants that abrogated the increased FLO11 expression of this 
allele using the loss of the characteristic fluffy-colony phenotype and a 
reporter plasmid containing GFP controlled by the same FLO11 promoter. Using 
this approach, we isolated several genes whose function was essential to 
maintain the expression of FLO11. In addition to previously characterized 
activators, we identified a number of novel FLO11 activators, which reveal the 
pH response pathway and chromatin-remodeling complexes as central elements 
involved in FLO11 activation.
