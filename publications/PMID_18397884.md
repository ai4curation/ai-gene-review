TIP60 (HTATIP) is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) whose function is critical 
in regulating ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, gene expression, 
and chromatin acetylation in DNA repair. Here we show that under non-stressed 
conditions, activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) in cooperation with Cul3 
ubiquitin ligase promotes degradation of TIP60, thereby attenuating its HAT 
activity. Inhibiting either ATF2 or Cul3 expression by small interfering RNA 
stabilizes the TIP60 protein. ATF2 association with TIP60 on chromatin is 
decreased following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), resulting in enhanced 
TIP60 stability and activity. We also identified a panel of melanoma and 
prostate cancer cell lines whose ATF2 expression is inversely correlated with 
TIP60 levels and ATM activation after IR. Inhibition of ATF2 expression in these 
lines restored TIP60 protein levels and both basal and IR-induced levels of ATM 
activity. Our study provides novel insight into regulation of ATM activation by 
ATF2-dependent control of TIP60 stability and activity.
