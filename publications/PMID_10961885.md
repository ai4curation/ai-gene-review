Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a key immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes Th1 
differentiation and cell-mediated immune responses. The transcription factor 
STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) is an important 
element in mediating IL-12 signals, as evidenced by the fact that STAT4(-/-) 
mice display impaired responsiveness to IL-12 and deficient Th1 differentiation. 
STAT4 is inducibly phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine in response to IL-12, 
but the kinase(s) responsible for the latter event is unknown. Here we show that 
IL-12 induces STAT4 phosphorylation on serine 721 and that mutation of serine 
721 interferes with STAT4 transcriptional activity. In addition, we show that 
mutation of tyrosine 693 abrogates IL-12-induced STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation 
and transcriptional activity. Although the site surrounding serine 721 is an 
optimum consensus sequence for mitogen-activated family of protein kinases 
(MAPKs)-mediated phosphorylation, we demonstrate that IL-12 does not induce 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 
activation in T and natural killer (NK) cells and that IL-12-induced STAT4 
transcriptional activity is not affected by these kinases. Rather, we show that 
IL-12 induces p38 activation. Moreover, we demonstrate that p38alpha and its 
upstream activator, MKK6, phosphorylate STAT4 on serine 721, and are required 
for STAT4 full transcriptional activity induced by IL-12, establishing the 
MKK6/p38alpha/STAT4 pathway as an important mediator of IL-12 actions. (Blood.
