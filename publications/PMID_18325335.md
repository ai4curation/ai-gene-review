Affixin/beta-parvin is an integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-binding focal adhesion 
protein highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart. To elucidate the possible 
role of affixin in skeletal muscle, we established stable C2C12 cell line 
expressing T7-tagged human affixin (C2C12-affixin cells). Exogenous expression 
of affixin promotes lamellipodium formation where affixin, ILK 
alphap21-activated kinase (PAK)-interactive exchange factor (PIX) and betaPIX 
accumulate. The association of affixin and betaPIX was confirmed by 
immunoprecipitation and pull down assay. In C2C12-affixin cells, an increased 
level of activated Rac1 but not Cdc42 was observed, and mutant betaPIX lacking 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity inhibited lamellipodium formation. 
These results suggest that affixin is involved in reorganization of 
subsarcolemmal cytoskeletal actin by activation of Rac1 through alpha and 
betaPIXs in skeletal muscle.
