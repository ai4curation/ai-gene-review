Early-onset torsion dystonia is a hereditary movement disorder thought to be 
caused by decreased release of dopamine into the basal ganglia, without apparent 
neuronal degeneration. Recent cloning of the gene responsible for this disease, 
TOR1A (DYT1), identified the encoded protein, torsinA, as a member of the AAA+ 
superfamily of chaperone proteins and revealed highest levels of expression in 
dopaminergic neurons in human brain. Most cases of this disease are caused by a 
deletion of one glutamic acid residue in the C-terminal region of the protein. 
Antibodies generated against torsinA revealed expression of a predominant 
immunoreactive protein species similar to the predicted size of 37.8 kDa in 
neural, glial and fibroblastic lines by western blot analysis. This protein is 
N-glycosylated with high mannose content and not, apparently, phosphoryl-ated. 
Overexpression of torsinA in mouse neural CAD cells followed by 
immunocytochemistry, revealed a dramatically different pattern of distribution 
for wild-type and mutant forms of the protein. The wild-type protein was found 
throughout the cytoplasm and neurites with a high degree of co-localization with 
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, protein disulfide isomerase. In contrast, 
the mutant protein accumulated in multiple, large inclusions in the cytoplasm 
around the nucleus. These inclusions were composed of membrane whorls, 
apparently derived from the ER. If disrupted processing of the mutant protein 
leads to its accumulation in multilayer membranous structures in vivo, these may 
interfere with membrane trafficking in neurons.
