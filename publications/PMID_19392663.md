The endocytosis pathway controls multiple cellular and physiological events. The 
lysosome is the destination of newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes. 
Internalized molecules or particles are delivered to the lysosome for 
degradation through sequential transport along the endocytic pathway. The 
endocytic pathway is also emerging as a signalling platform, in addition to the 
well-known role of the plasma membrane for signalling. Rab7 is a late 
endosome-/lysosome-associated small GTPase, perhaps the only lysosomal Rab 
protein identified to date. Rab7 plays critical roles in the endocytic 
processes. Through interaction with its partners (including upstream regulators 
and downstream effectors), Rab7 participates in multiple regulation mechanisms 
in endosomal sorting, biogenesis of lysosome [or LRO (lysosome-related 
organelle)] and phagocytosis. These processes are closely related to substrates 
degradation, antigen presentation, cell signalling, cell survival and microbial 
pathogen infection. Consistently, mutations or dysfunctions of Rab7 result in 
traffic disorders, which cause various diseases, such as neuropathy, cancer and 
lipid metabolism disease. Rab7 also plays important roles in microbial pathogen 
infection and survival, as well as in participating in the life cycle of 
viruses. Here, we give a brief review on the central role of Rab7 in endosomal 
traffic and summarize the studies focusing on the participation of Rab7 in 
disease pathogenesis. The underlying mechanism governed by Rab7 and its partners 
will also be discussed.
