Cytosolic tyrosine kinases play a critical role both in neural development and 
in adult brain function and plasticity. Here we isolated a cDNA with high 
homology to human Ack1 and mouse Tnk2. This cDNA directs the expression of a 
125-kD protein that can be autophosphorylated in tyrosines. Initially, this 
clone was named Pyk1 for proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Lev et al., 1995); 
however, since it corresponds to the mouse homolog of Ack1, here we called it 
Ack1/Pyk1. In this study we show that Ack1/Pyk1 mRNA and protein is highly 
expressed in the developing and adult brain. The highest levels of Ack1/Pyk1 
expression were detected in the hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum. Electron 
microscopy studies showed that Ack1/Pyk1 protein is expressed in these regions 
both at dendritic spines and presynaptic axon terminals, indicating a role in 
synaptic function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ack1/Pyk1 mRNA levels are 
strongly upregulated by increased neural activity, produced by intraperitoneal 
kainate injections. During development, Ack1/Pyk1 was also expressed in the 
proliferative ventricular zones and in postmitotic maturing neurons. In neuronal 
cultures, Ack1/Pyk1 was detected in developing dendrites and axons, including 
dendritic tips and growth cones. Moreover, Ack1/Pyk1 colocalized with Cdc42 
GTPase in neuronal cultures and coimmunoprecipitated with Cdc42 in HEK 293T 
cells. Altogether, our findings indicate that Ack1/Pyk1 tyrosine kinase may be 
involved both in adult synaptic function and plasticity and in brain 
development.
