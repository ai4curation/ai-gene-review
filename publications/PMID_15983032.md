Previously, we reported that BRCA1 strongly represses the transcriptional 
activity of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) in human breast and prostate 
cancer cells but only weakly inhibits ER-alpha in cervical cancer cells. We now 
report that introduction of the human papillomavirus E7 or E6 oncogenes into 
human papillomavirus-negative cells rescues the BRCA1 repression of ER-alpha 
activity and that the E7 and E6 oncoproteins interact directly with BRCA1 in 
vitro and associate with BRCA1 in vivo in cultured cells. This interaction 
involves at least two contact points on BRCA1, one within an N-terminal site 
shown previously to interact with ER-alpha and the other in a C-terminal region 
of BRCA1 containing the first BRCA1 C-terminal domain. Point mutations within 
the zinc finger domains of E7 and E6 inactivated the binding to the N terminus 
of BRCA1 and reduced their ability to rescue BRCA1 inhibition of ER-alpha. E6 
and E7 also antagonized the ability of BRCA1 to inhibit c-Myc E-box-mediated 
transactivation and human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter activity, in 
a manner dependent upon the zinc finger domains. Finally, the ability of E6 and 
E7 to antagonize BRCA1 did not involve proteolytic degradation of BRCA1. These 
findings suggest functional interactions of BRCA1 with E7 and E6. The potential 
significance of these findings is discussed.
