The nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master transcriptional 
activator of genes encoding numerous cytoprotective enzymes that are induced in 
response to environmental and endogenously derived oxidative/electrophilic 
agents. Under normal, nonstressed circumstances, low cellular concentrations of 
Nrf2 are maintained by proteasomal degradation through a 
Keap1-Cul3-Roc1-dependent mechanism. A model for Nrf2 activation has been 
proposed in which two amino-terminal motifs, DLG and ETGE, promote efficient 
ubiquitination and rapid turnover; known as the two-site substrate 
recognition/hinge and latch model. Here, we show that in human cancer, somatic 
mutations occur in the coding region of NRF2, especially among patients with a 
history of smoking or suffering from squamous cell carcinoma; in the latter 
case, this leads to poor prognosis. These mutations specifically alter amino 
acids in the DLG or ETGE motifs, resulting in aberrant cellular accumulation of 
Nrf2. Mutant Nrf2 cells display constitutive induction of cytoprotective enzymes 
and drug efflux pumps, which are insensitive to Keap1-mediated regulation. 
Suppression of Nrf2 protein levels by siRNA knockdown sensitized cancer cells to 
oxidative stress and chemotherapeutic reagents. Our results strongly support the 
contention that constitutive Nrf2 activation affords cancer cells with undue 
protection from their inherently stressed microenvironment and anti-cancer 
treatments. Hence, inactivation of the Nrf2 pathway may represent a therapeutic 
strategy to reinforce current treatments for malignancy. Congruously, the 
present study also provides in vivo validation of the two-site substrate 
recognition model for Nrf2 activation by the Keap1-Cul3-based E3 ligase.
