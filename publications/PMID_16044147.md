TP53INP1 is an alternatively spliced gene encoding two nuclear protein isoforms 
(TP53INP1alpha and TP53INP1beta), whose transcription is activated by p53. When 
overexpressed, both isoforms induce cell cycle arrest in G1 and enhance 
p53-mediated apoptosis. TP53INP1s also interact with the p53 gene and regulate 
p53 transcriptional activity. We report here that TP53INP1 expression is induced 
during experimental acute pancreatitis in p53-/- mice and in cisplatin-treated 
p53-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We demonstrate that ectopic expression 
of p73, a p53 homologue, leads to TP53INP1 induction in p53-deficient cells. In 
turn, TP53INP1s alters the transactivation capacity of p73 on several p53-target 
genes, including TP53INP1 itself, demonstrating a functional association between 
p73 and TP53INP1s. Also, when overexpressed in p53-deficient cells, TP53INP1s 
inhibit cell growth and promote cell death as assessed by cell cycle analysis 
and colony formation assays. Finally, we show that TP53INP1s potentiate the 
capacity of p73 to inhibit cell growth, that effect being prevented when the p53 
mutant R175H is expressed or when p73 expression is blocked by a siRNA. These 
results suggest that TP53INP1s are functionally associated with p73 to regulate 
cell cycle progression and apoptosis, independently from p53.
