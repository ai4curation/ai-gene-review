The processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) and its metabolites 
plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Down's syndrome. The authors have reported elsewhere that a targeted mutation 
resulting in low expression of a shortened betaAPP protein 
(betaAPP(delta/delta)) entails reduced learning abilities. Here the authors 
investigate whether these effects were caused by postnatal developmental actions 
of the altered protein. The authors examined 35 mice carrying the 
betaAPP(delta/delta) mutation for somatic growth and sensorimotor development 
during the first 4 postnatal weeks (pw) and compared them with 31 wildtype 
litter-mates. Thereafter, the same mice were tested at about 10 weeks of age for 
openfield behavior and for swimming navigation learning. Mutant mice showed both 
transient and long-lasting deficits in development. Body weight deficit started 
to emerge at postnatal day (pd) 12, peaked with a 15.1% deficit at pd 27 and 
lasted until pw 33-37. Significant transient deficits in mutant mice during 
sensorimotor development were observed in three time windows (pd 3-10, pd 11-19 
and pd 20-27), long-lasting effects, manifest at pw 8-12 and pw 33-37, emerged 
at any of the three periods. In the adult mice, exploratory activity of betaAPP 
mutants in the openfield arena was severely reduced. In the Morris water maze 
task, mutant mice showed moderate escape performance deficits during the 
acquisition period but no impairment in spatial memory. The authors conclude 
that a defective betaAPP gene impairs postnatal somatic development, associated 
with transient as well as long-lasting neurobehavioral retardation and muscular 
weakness. Comparison with earlier data suggests that early postnatal handling 
may attenuate some of the non-cognitive performance deficits in the water maze. 
Further, the manifestation and time course of behavioral yet not 
neuropathological symptoms in betaAPP mutant mice resemble in some aspects those 
of the human Down's syndrome.
