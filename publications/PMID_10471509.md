## Abstract

1. Nat Genet. 1999 Sep;23(1):104-7. doi: 10.1038/12709.

A novel member of the F-box/WD40 gene family, encoding dactylin, is disrupted in 
the mouse dactylaplasia mutant.

Early outgrowth of the vertebrate embryonic limb requires signalling by the 
apical ectodermal ridge (AER) to the progress zone (PZ), which in response 
proliferates and lays down the pattern of the presumptive limb in a proximal to 
distal progression. Signals from the PZ maintain the AER until the anlagen for 
the distal phalanges have been formed. The semidominant mouse mutant 
dactylaplasia (Dac) disrupts the maintenance of the AER, leading to truncation 
of distal structures of the developing footplate, or autopod. Adult Dac 
homozygotes thus lack hands and feet except for malformed single digits, whereas 
heterozygotes lack phalanges of the three middle digits. Dac resembles the human 
autosomal dominant split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) diseases. One of these, 
SHFM3, maps to chromosome 10q24 (Refs 6,7), which is syntenic to the Dac region 
on chromosome 19, and may disrupt the orthologue of Dac. We report here the 
positional cloning of Dac and show that it belongs to the F-box/WD40 gene 
family, which encodes adapters that target specific proteins for destruction by 
presenting them to the ubiquitination machinery. In conjuction with recent 
biochemical studies, this report demonstrates the importance of this gene family 
in vertebrate embryonic development.
