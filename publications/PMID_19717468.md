Magnesium (Mg(2+)) is the second most abundant cation in cells, yet relatively 
few mechanisms have been identified that regulate cellular levels of this ion. 
The most clearly identified Mg(2+) transporters are in bacteria and yeast. Here, 
we use a yeast complementary screen to identify two mammalian genes, MagT1 and 
TUSC3, as major mechanisms of Mg(2+) influx. MagT1 is universally expressed in 
all human tissues and its expression level is up-regulated in low extracellular 
Mg(2+). Knockdown of either MagT1 or TUSC3 protein significantly lowers the 
total and free intracellular Mg(2+) concentrations in mammalian cell lines. 
Morpholino knockdown of MagT1 and TUSC3 protein expression in zebrafish embryos 
results in early developmental arrest; excess Mg(2+) or supplementation with 
mammalian mRNAs can rescue the effects. We conclude that MagT1 and TUSC3 are 
indispensable members of the vertebrate plasma membrane Mg(2+) transport system.
