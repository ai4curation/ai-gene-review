DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) is an essential enzyme that mediates a variety of 
chromosome activities including DNA replication, transcription, recombination, 
and chromosome condensation and segregation. Isoform-specific anti-topo II 
antibodies were used to determine the distribution of topo II alpha and beta in 
mouse gametes and embryos. Immunoblot analysis with two anti-topo IIalpha 
antibodies revealed that a 170 kDa topo IIalpha band was present in ovary and 
testis. Mature sperm exhibited an 89 kDa band only, which may be a degradation 
product of topo IIalpha. Immunoblots probed with a monoclonal antibody that 
recognizes both isoforms, showed bands at 170 and 180 kDa, which correspond to 
topo IIalpha and beta, respectively. An additional 100 kDa band was also present 
in ovary and testis. Mature sperm did not exhibit staining with this antibody. 
We also localized topo II in mouse gametes and embryos up to the blastocyst 
stage using immunofluorescence microscopy. While both isoforms were found in 
nuclei and nucleoli of germinal vesicle oocytes, topo IIalpha localized to 
metaphase chromosomes during meiosis, and only to nucleoli during embryonic 
interphase. Topo IIbeta was absent from chromosomes of metaphase II oocytes, but 
localized to embryonic interphase nuclei. Both full-length isoforms were absent 
from sperm, indicating topo II is stored maternally. These results identify topo 
II as an important component of mouse oocyte and embryonic chromatin, and 
suggest its involvement in oocyte maturation and preimplantation embryonic 
development. The different immunofluorescent staining patterns indicate topo 
IIalpha and beta may serve different roles during the embryonic cell cycle.
