We previously described many Hsp70 Ssa1p mutants that impair [PSI(+)] prion 
propagation in yeast without affecting cell growth. To determine how the 
mutations alter Hsp70 we analyzed biochemically the substrate-binding domain 
(SBD) mutant L483W and the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) mutants A17V and 
R34K. Ssa1(L483W) ATPase activity was elevated 10-fold and was least stimulated 
by substrates or Hsp40 co-chaperones. Ssa1(A17V) and Ssa1(R34K) ATPase 
activities were nearly wild type but both showed increased stimulation by 
substrates. Peptide binding and reactivation of denatured luciferase were 
enhanced in Ssa1(A17V) and Ssa1(R34K) but compromised in Ssa1(L483W). The 
nucleotide exchange factor Fes1 influenced ATPase of wild type Ssa1 and each 
mutant differently. Partial protease digestion uncovered similar and distinct 
conformational changes of the substrate-binding domain among the three mutants. 
Our data suggest that prion-impairing mutations of Ssa1 can increase or decrease 
substrate interactions, alter the Hsp70 reaction cycle at different points and 
impair normal NBD-SBD cooperation.
