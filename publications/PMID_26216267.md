Nuclear translocation of IGFBP3 by importin-β1 is a prerequisite for 
IGFBP3-induced apoptosis. The neuroprotective peptide humanin (HN) counteracts 
IGFBP3-induced cell death. However, the mechanism by which humanin protects 
cells is currently unknown. The natural synthesis of this peptide decreases with 
age, coincident with the likelihood for the development of Alzheimer's Disease, 
making it a promising target for therapeutics. We have examined the effect of 
full-length humanin and a synthetic analogue (HN 3-19), known to be sufficient 
for its neuroprotective function, on the interaction between IGFBP3 and 
importin-β1. Using competitive ligand dot blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and 
an ELISA-based binding assay, we determined that 1) humanin binds to IGFBP3 with 
a Kd of 5.05 µM and 2) both humanin (IC50 of 18.1 µM) and HN 3-19 (IC50 of 10.3 
μM) interfere with the binding of importin-β1 to IGFBP3 in vitro. We also 
demonstrated that HN 3-19 is able to reduce the rate of apoptosis in a human 
lung adenocarcinoma cell line, suggesting a possible mechanism of action for 
humanin as an inhibitor of IGFBP3 nuclear translocation. Understanding the exact 
mechanism by which humanin and its analogue, HN 3-19, bind to IGFPB3 and 
regulate its interaction with importin-β1 will open the door to modulating the 
protein-protein interactions involved in neuronal cell death.
