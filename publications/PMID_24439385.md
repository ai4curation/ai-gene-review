Ferroptosis is a form of nonapoptotic cell death for which key regulators remain 
unknown. We sought a common mediator for the lethality of 12 
ferroptosis-inducing small molecules. We used targeted metabolomic profiling to 
discover that depletion of glutathione causes inactivation of glutathione 
peroxidases (GPXs) in response to one class of compounds and a chemoproteomics 
strategy to discover that GPX4 is directly inhibited by a second class of 
compounds. GPX4 overexpression and knockdown modulated the lethality of 12 
ferroptosis inducers, but not of 11 compounds with other lethal mechanisms. In 
addition, two representative ferroptosis inducers prevented tumor growth in 
xenograft mouse tumor models. Sensitivity profiling in 177 cancer cell lines 
revealed that diffuse large B cell lymphomas and renal cell carcinomas are 
particularly susceptible to GPX4-regulated ferroptosis. Thus, GPX4 is an 
essential regulator of ferroptotic cancer cell death.
