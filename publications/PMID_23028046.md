Cellular adaptation to different stresses related to survival and function has 
been demonstrated in several cell types. Anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) induces 
rapid cell death, termed "pyroptosis," by activating NLRP1b/caspase-1 in murine 
macrophages. We and others (S. D. Ha et al., J. Biol. Chem. 282:26275-26283, 
2007; I. I. Salles et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100:12426 -12431, 
2003) have shown that RAW264.7 cells preexposed to sublethal doses of LeTx 
become resistant to subsequent high cytolytic doses of LeTx, termed 
toxin-induced resistance (TIR). To date, the cellular mechanisms of pyroptosis 
and TIR are largely unknown. We found that LeTx caused 
NLRP1b/caspase-1-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, including 
hyperpolarization and generation of reactive oxygen species, which was distinct 
from that induced by stimuli such as NLRP3-activating ATP. In TIR cells, these 
mitochondrial events were not detected, although caspase-1 was activated, in 
response to LeTx. We identified that downregulation of the late endosomal 
cholesterol-transferring protein MLN64 in TIR cells was involved in TIR. The 
downregulation of MLN64 in TIR cells was at least in part due to DNA 
methyltransferase 1-mediated DNA methylation. In wild-type RAW264.7 cells and 
primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, LeTx caused NLRP1b/caspase-1-dependent 
mitochondrial translocation of MLN64, resulting in cholesterol enrichment, 
membrane hyperpolarization, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and 
depletion of free glutathione (GSH). This study demonstrates for the first time 
that MLN64 plays a key role in LeTx/caspase-1-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
