Telomerase is a specialized DNA polymerase that extends the 3' ends of 
eukaryotic linear chromosomes, a process required for genomic stability and cell 
viability. Here we present the crystal structure of the active Tribolium 
castaneum telomerase catalytic subunit, TERT, bound to an RNA-DNA hairpin 
designed to resemble the putative RNA-templating region and telomeric DNA. The 
RNA-DNA hybrid adopts a helical structure, docked in the interior cavity of the 
TERT ring. Contacts between the RNA template and motifs 2 and B' position the 
solvent-accessible RNA bases close to the enzyme active site for nucleotide 
binding and selectivity. Nucleic acid binding induces rigid TERT conformational 
changes to form a tight catalytic complex. Overall, TERT-RNA template and 
TERT-telomeric DNA associations are remarkably similar to those observed for 
retroviral reverse transcriptases, suggesting common mechanistic aspects of DNA 
replication between the two families of enzymes.
