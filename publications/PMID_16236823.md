Laminin alpha5-chain, a constituent of laminins-10 and -11, is expressed in 
endothelial basement membranes. In this study we evaluated the roles of alpha5 
laminins and Lutheran blood group glycoproteins (Lu), recently identified 
receptors of the laminin alpha5-chain, in the adhesion of human dermal 
microvascular and pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Field emission scanning 
electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry showed that the endothelial cells 
spread on laminin-10 and formed fibronectin-positive fibrillar adhesion 
structures. Immunoprecipitation results suggested that the cells produced 
fibronectin, which they could use as adhesion substratum, during the adhesion 
process. When the protein synthesis during the adhesion was inhibited with 
cycloheximide, the formation of fibrillar adhesions on laminin-10 was abolished, 
suggesting that laminin-10 does not stimulate the formation of any adhesion 
structures. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that the cells expressed 
M(r) 78,000 and 85,000 isoforms of Lu. Quantitative cell adhesion assays showed 
that in the endothelial cell adhesion to laminin-10, Lu acted in concert with 
integrins beta(1) and alpha(v)beta(3), whereas in the adhesion to laminin-10/11, 
Lu and integrin beta(1) were involved. In the cells adhering to the alpha5 
laminins, Lu and the integrins showed uniform cell surface distribution. These 
findings indicate that alpha5 laminins stimulate endothelial cell adhesion but 
not the formation of fibrillar or focal adhesions. Lu mediates the adhesion of 
human endothelial cells to alpha5 laminins in collaboration with integrins 
beta(1) and alpha(v)beta(3).
