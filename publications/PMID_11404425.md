In the striatum, dopamine D(1) and adenosine A(2A) receptors stimulate the 
production of cAMP, which is involved in neuromodulation and long-lasting 
changes in gene expression and synaptic function. Positive coupling of receptors 
to adenylyl cyclase can be mediated through the ubiquitous GTP-binding protein 
Galpha(S) subunit or through the olfactory isoform, Galpha(olf), which 
predominates in the striatum. In this study, using double in situ hybridization, 
we show that virtually all striatal efferent neurons, identified by the 
expression of preproenkephalin A, substance P, or D(1) receptor mRNA, contained 
high amounts of Galpha(olf) mRNA and undetectable levels of Galpha(s) mRNA. In 
contrast, the large cholinergic interneurons contained both Galpha(olf) and 
Galpha(s) transcripts. To assess the functional relationship between dopamine or 
adenosine receptors and G-proteins, we examined G-protein levels in the striatum 
of D(1) and A(2A) receptor knock-out mice. A selective increase in Galpha(olf) 
protein was observed in these animals, without change in mRNA levels. 
Conversely, Galpha(olf) levels were decreased in animals lacking a functional 
dopamine transporter. These results indicate that Galpha(olf) protein levels are 
regulated through D(1) and A(2A) receptor usage. To determine the functional 
consequences of changes in Galpha(olf) levels, we used heterozygous Galpha(olf) 
knock-out mice, which possess half of the normal Galpha(olf) levels. In these 
animals, the locomotor effects of amphetamine and caffeine, two psychostimulant 
drugs that affect dopamine and adenosine signaling, respectively, were markedly 
reduced. Together, these results identify Galpha(olf) as a critical and 
regulated component of both dopamine and adenosine signaling.
