The Arp2/3 complex is a seven-protein assembly that is critical for actin 
nucleation and branching in cells. Here we report the reconstitution of active 
human Arp2/3 complex after expression of all seven subunits in insect cells. 
Expression of partial complexes revealed that a heterodimer of the p34 and p20 
subunits constitutes a critical structural core of the complex, whereas the 
remaining subunits are peripherally located. Arp3 is crucial for nucleation, 
consistent with it being a structural component of the nucleation site. p41, 
p21, and p16 contribute differently to nucleation and stimulation by ActA and 
WASP, whereas p34/p20 bind actin filaments and likely function in actin 
branching. This study reveals that the nucleating and organizing functions of 
Arp2/3 complex subunits are separable, indicating that these activities may be 
differentially regulated in cells.
