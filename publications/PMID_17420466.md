In the cilia of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, anterograde intraflagellar 
transport (IFT) is mediated by two kinesin-2 complexes, kinesin II and OSM-3 
kinesin. These complexes function together in the cilia middle segments, whereas 
OSM-3 alone mediates transport in the distal segments. Not much is known about 
the mechanisms that compartmentalize the kinesin-2 complexes or how transport by 
both kinesins is coordinated. Here, we identify DYF-5, a conserved MAP kinase 
that plays a role in these processes. Fluorescence microscopy and EM revealed 
that the cilia of dyf-5 loss-of-function (lf) animals are elongated and are not 
properly aligned into the amphid channel. Some cilia do enter the amphid 
channel, but the distal ends of these cilia show accumulation of proteins. 
Consistent with these observations, we found that six IFT proteins accumulate in 
the cilia of dyf-5(lf) mutants. In addition, using genetic analyses and live 
imaging to measure the motility of IFT proteins, we show that dyf-5 is required 
to restrict kinesin II to the cilia middle segments. Finally, we show that, in 
dyf-5(lf) mutants, OSM-3 moves at a reduced speed and is not attached to IFT 
particles. We propose that DYF-5 plays a role in the undocking of kinesin II 
from IFT particles and in the docking of OSM-3 onto IFT particles.
