Protein glycosylation modulates a wide variety of intracellular events and 
dysfunction of the glycosylation pathway has been reported in a variety of human 
pathologies. Endo-apyrases have been suggested to have critical roles in protein 
glycosylation and sugar metabolism. However, deciphering the physiological 
relevance of Endo-apyrases activity has actually proved difficult, owing to 
their complexity and the functional redundancy within the family. We report here 
that a UDP/GDPase, homologous to the human apyrase Scan-1, is present in the 
membranes of Caenorhabditis elegans, encoded by the ORF F08C6.6 and 
hereinafter-named APY-1. We showed that ER stress induced by tunicamycin or high 
temperature resulted in increased transcription of apy-1. This increase was not 
observed in C. elegans mutants defective in ire-1 or atf-6, demonstrating the 
requirement of both ER stress sensors for up-regulation of apy-1. Depletion of 
APY-1 resulted in constitutively activated unfolded protein response. Defects in 
the pharynx and impaired organization of thin fibers in muscle cells were 
observed in adult worms depleted of APY-1. Some of the apy-1(RNAi) phenotypes 
are suggestive of premature aging, because these animals also showed 
accumulation of lipofuscin and reduced lifespan that was not dependent on the 
functioning of DAF-2, the receptor of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway.
