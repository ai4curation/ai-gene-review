Two intronic elements, a polymorphic TGmTn locus at the end of intron 8 and an 
intronic splicing silencer in intron 9, regulate aberrant splicing of human 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) exon 9. Previous 
studies (Pagani, F., Buratti, E., Stuani, C., Romano, M., Zuccato, E., Niksic, 
M., Giglio, L., Faraguna, D., and Baralle, F. E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 
21041-21047 and Buratti, E., Dork, T., Zuccato, E., Pagani, F., Romano, M., and 
Baralle, F. E. (2001) Embo J. 20, 1774-1784) have demonstrated that trans-acting 
factors that bind to these sequences, TDP43 and Ser/Arg-rich proteins, 
respectively, mediate splicing inhibition. Here, we report the identification of 
two polypyrimidine-binding proteins, TIA-1 and polypyrimidine tract-binding 
protein (PTB), as novel players in the regulation of CFTR exon 9 splicing. In 
hybrid minigene experiments, TIA-1 induced exon inclusion, whereas PTB induced 
exon skipping. TIA-1 bound specifically to a polypyrimidine-rich controlling 
element (PCE) located between the weak 5'-splice site (ss) and the intronic 
splicing silencer. Mutants of the PCE polypyrimidine motifs did not bind TIA-1 
and, in a splicing assay, did not respond to TIA-1 splicing enhancement. PTB 
antagonized in vitro TIA-1 binding to the PCE, but its splicing inhibition was 
independent of its binding to the PCE. Recruitment of U1 small nuclear RNA to 
the weak 5'-ss by complementarity also induced exon 9 inclusion, consistent with 
the facilitating role of TIA-1 in weak 5'-ss recognition by U1 small nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein. Interestingly, in the presence of a high number of TG repeats 
and a low number of T repeats in the TGmTn locus, TIA-1 activated a cryptic 
exonic 3'-ss. This effect was independent of both TIA-1 binding to the PCE and 
U1 small nuclear RNA recruitment to the 5'-ss. Moreover, it was abolished by 
deletion of either the TG or T sequence. These data indicate that, in CFTR exon 
9, TIA-1 binding to the PCE recruits U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein to the 
weak 5'-ss and induces exon inclusion. The TIA-1-mediated alternative usage of 
the 3'-splice sites, which depends on the composition of the unusual TGmTn 
element, represents a new mechanism of splicing regulation by TIA-1.
