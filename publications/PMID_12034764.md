Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase is an enzyme of 
phagocytes that produces bactericidal superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) via an 
electrogenic process. Proton efflux compensates for the charge movement across 
the cell membrane. The proton channel responsible for the H(+) efflux was 
thought to be contained within the gp91(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase, but 
recent data do not support this idea (DeCoursey, T.E., V.V. Cherny, D. Morgan, 
B.Z. Katz, and M.C. Dinauer. 2001. J. Biol. Chem. 276:36063-36066). In this 
study, we investigated electrophysiological properties and superoxide production 
of COS-7 cells transfected with all NADPH oxidase components required for enzyme 
function (COS(phox)). The 7D5 antibody, which detects an extracellular epitope 
of the gp91(phox) protein, labeled 96-98% of COS(phox) cells. NADPH oxidase was 
functional because COS(phox) (but not COS(WT)) cells stimulated by phorbol 
myristate acetate (PMA) or arachidonic acid (AA) produced superoxide anion. No 
proton currents were detected in either wild-type COS-7 cells (COS(WT)) or 
COS(phox) cells studied at pH(o) 7.0 and pH(i) 5.5 or 7.0. Anion currents that 
decayed at voltages positive to 40 mV were the only currents observed. PMA or AA 
did not elicit detectable H(+) current in COS(WT) or COS(phox) cells. Therefore, 
gp91(phox) does not function as a proton channel in unstimulated cells or in 
activated cells with a demonstrably functional oxidase.
