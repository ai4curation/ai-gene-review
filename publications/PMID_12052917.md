The Notch signaling pathway has long been known to influence cell fate in the 
developing nervous system. However, this pathway has generally been thought to 
inhibit the specification of certain cell types in favor of others, or to simply 
maintain a progenitor pool. Recently, this view has been challenged by numerous 
studies suggesting that Notch may play an instructive role in promoting glial 
development. This work has inspired a new look at the role of Notch signaling in 
specifying cell fate. It has also prompted further consideration of the emerging 
view that in some contexts glia may be multipotent progenitors. This review 
examines the role of Notch during gliogenesis in both fruit flies and 
vertebrates, as well as evidence in vertebrates that some glia may be stem 
cells.
