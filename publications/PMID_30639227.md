There has been a steadily increasing appreciation of the fact that the 
relationship between protein sequence and structure is often sufficiently 
ambiguous to allow a single sequence to adopt alternative, stable folds. Living 
organisms have been able to utilize such metamorphic proteins in remarkable and 
unanticipated ways. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is among the earliest such 
proteins identified and remains a unique example in which a functional 
heterodimer contains two, alternatively folded polymerase domains. Structural 
characterization of the p66 precursor protein combined with NMR spectroscopic 
and molecular modeling studies have provided insights into the factors 
underlying the metamorphic transition and the subunit-specific programmed 
unfolding step required to expose the protease cleavage site within the 
ribonuclease H domain, supporting the conversion of the p66/p66' precursor into 
the mature p66/p51 heterodimer.
