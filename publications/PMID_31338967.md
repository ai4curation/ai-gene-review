The concerted action of many protein kinases helps orchestrate the error-free 
progression through mitosis of mammalian cells. The roles and regulation of some 
prominent mitotic kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinases, are well 
established. However, these and other known mitotic kinases alone cannot account 
for the extent of protein phosphorylation that has been reported during 
mammalian mitosis. Here we demonstrate that CK1α, of the casein kinase 1 family 
of protein kinases, localises to the spindle and is required for proper spindle 
positioning and timely cell division. CK1α is recruited to the spindle by 
FAM83D, and cells devoid of FAM83D, or those harbouring CK1α-binding-deficient 
FAM83DF283A/F283A knockin mutations, display pronounced spindle positioning 
defects, and a prolonged mitosis. Restoring FAM83D at the endogenous locus in 
FAM83D-/- cells, or artificially delivering CK1α to the spindle in 
FAM83DF283A/F283A cells, rescues these defects. These findings implicate CK1α as 
new mitotic kinase that orchestrates the kinetics and orientation of cell 
division.
