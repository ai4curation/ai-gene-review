PACE4 is a mammalian subtilisin-like proprotein convertase that activates 
transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-related proteins such as bone 
morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), BMP4 and Nodal and exhibits a dynamic expression 
pattern during embryogenesis. We recently determined that the 1 kb 5'-upstream 
region of the PACE4 gene contains 12 E-box (E1-E12) elements and that an E-box 
cluster (E4-E9) acts as a negative regulator [Tsuji, Yoshida, Hasegawa, Bando, 
Yoshida, Koide, Mori and Matsuda (1999) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 126, 494-502]. It is 
known that the mammalian achaete-scute homologue 1 (MASH-1) binds specifically 
to an E-box (CACCTG) sequence in collaboration with E47, a ubiquitously 
expressed basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor. To identify the roles of the 
bHLH factor and E-box elements in regulating PACE4 gene expression in neural 
development, we analysed the effects of human achaete-scute homologue 1 (hASH-1) 
on PACE4 gene expression with various neuroblastoma cell lines. The expressions 
of PACE4 and hASH-1 are correlated inversely in these cell lines. The 
overexpression of hASH-1 or MASH-1 causes a marked decrease in endogenous PACE4 
gene expression but has no effect on the expression of other subtilisin-like 
proprotein convertases such as furin, PC5/6 and PC7/8. In contrast, other neural 
bHLH factors (MATH-1, MATH-2, neurogenin 1, neurogenin 2, neurogenin 3 and E47) 
did not affect PACE4 gene expression. Furthermore, an E-box cluster was a 
negative regulatory element for the promoter activity in NBL-S cells expressing 
hASH-1 at high level as determined by a luciferase assay. Binding of hASH-1 to 
the E-box cluster was confirmed by gel mobility-shift assay. In the present 
study we identified the PACE4 gene as one of the targets of hASH-1, which is a 
key factor in the initiation of neural differentiation. These results suggest 
that the alteration of PACE4 gene expression by hASH-1 causes rapid changes in 
the biological activities of TGF-beta-related proteins via post-translational 
modification of these proteins.
