Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a multistep process which requires interaction 
between a number of conserved proteins. We have cloned two mammalian genes which 
code for a number of endocytic adaptor proteins. Two of these proteins, termed 
Ese1 and Ese2, contain two N-terminal EH domains, a central coiled-coil domain 
and five C-terminal SH3 domains. Ese1 is constitutively associated with Eps15 
proteins to form a complex with at least 14 protein-protein interaction 
surfaces. Yeast two-hybrid assays have revealed that Ese1 EH and SH3 domains 
bind epsin family proteins and dynamin, respectively. Overexpression of Ese1 is 
sufficient to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis in cultured cells, presumably 
through disruption of higher order protein complexes, which are assembled on the 
endogenous Ese1-Eps15 scaffold. The Ese1-Eps15 scaffold therefore links dynamin, 
epsin and other endocytic pathway components.
