Arabidopsis COP1 is a photomorphogenesis repressor capable of directly 
interacting with the photomorphogenesis-promoting factor HY5. This interaction 
between HY5 and COP1 results in targeted deg radation of HY5 by the 26S 
proteasome. Here we characterized the WD40 repeat domain-mediated interactions 
of COP1 with HY5 and two new proteins. Mutational analysis of those interactive 
partners revealed a conserved motif responsible for the interaction with the 
WD40 domain. This novel motif, with the core sequence V-P-E/D-&phi;-G (&phi; = 
hydrophobic residue) in conjunction with an upstream stretch of 4-5 negatively 
charged residues, interacts with a defined surface area of the ss-propeller 
assembly of the COP1 WD40 repeat domain through both hydrophobic and ionic 
interactions. Several residues in the COP1 WD40 domain that are critical for the 
interaction with this motif have been revealed. The fact that point mutations 
either in the COP1 WD40 domain or in the HY5 motif that abolish the interaction 
between COP1 and HY5 in yeast result in a dramatic reduction of HY5 degradation 
in transgenic plants validates the biological significance of this defined 
interaction.

Abstract

Arabidopsis COP1 is a photomorphogenesis repressor capable of directly interacting with the photomorphogenesis-promoting factor HY5. This interaction between HY5 and COP1 results in targeted deg radation of HY5 by the 26S proteasome. Here we characterized the WD40 repeat domain-mediated interactions of COP1 with HY5 and two new proteins. Mutational analysis of those interactive partners revealed a conserved motif responsible for the interaction with the WD40 domain. This novel motif, with the core sequence V-P-E/D-φ-G (φ = hydrophobic residue) in conjunction with an upstream stretch of 4–5 negatively charged residues, interacts with a defined surface area of the β-propeller assembly of the COP1 WD40 repeat domain through both hydrophobic and ionic interactions. Several residues in the COP1 WD40 domain that are critical for the interaction with this motif have been revealed. The fact that point mutations either in the COP1 WD40 domain or in the HY5 motif that abolish the interaction between COP1 and HY5 in yeast result in a dramatic reduction of HY5 degradation in transgenic plants validates the biological significance of this defined interaction.

Introduction

Arabidopsis seedlings follow two dramatically different developmental patterns depending on the presence or absence of light ( Kendrick and Kronenberg, 1994 ). Light-grown seedlings undergo photomorphogenesis and have short hypocotyls with photosynthetically active and highly differentiated cotyledons. In contrast, seedlings grown in darkness are etiolated and develop elongated hypocotyls with unexpanded cotyledons. Genetic screens have identified both positive and negative regulators mediating this light control of seedling development in Arabidopsis ( Deng and Quail, 1999 ; Nagy and Schafer, 2000 ; Neff et al., 2000 ).

Two of these regulators, HY5 and COP1, act as critical components of this developmental switch ( Osterlund et al., 1999 ). The bZIP transcription factor HY5 promotes photomorphogenesis in the light, whereas COP1 represses photomorphogenic development in darkness. The COP1 protein contains three distinct domains, a Zn 2+ -binding RING finger domain, a coiled-coil domain and seven WD40 repeats in the C-terminal half of the protein ( Deng et al., 1992 ; McNellis et al., 1994a ). All characterized lethal cop1 alleles contain mutations within the WD40 domain, whereas the weak alleles either lack the WD40 domain or have mutations N-terminal to the domain ( McNellis et al., 1994a ). COP1 is nuclear localized in the dark, whereas its nuclear abundance decreases upon exposure to light ( von Arnim and Deng, 1994 , 1996 ). COP1 interacts directly with HY5, both genetically and physically, through its WD40 domain, negatively regulating HY5 activity ( Ang and Deng, 1994 ; Ang et al., 1998 ; Torii et al., 1998 ). Recent evidence suggests that the interaction results in a dark-dependent degradation of HY5 ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ). HY5 accumulation is very low in dark-grown seedlings and is ∼20-fold higher in the light. The level of HY5 protein correlates directly with photomorphogenic development and inversely with the nuclear abundance of COP1. The regulated HY5 degradation is likely to be mediated by the 26S proteasome and depends on its interaction with COP1 ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ). Taken together, the results suggest that HY5 interacts with the WD40 domain of COP1 and that the interaction negatively regulates the abundance of HY5 in the dark.

Many regulatory proteins have WD40 domains that mediate protein–protein interactions. WD40 domains usually contain 4–8 WD40 repeats and were originally identified in the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins (Gβ) ( Fong et al ., 1986 ). The repeats have since been found in a large number of proteins, including transcriptional repressors, such as TUP1 and Groucho ( Paroush et al ., 1994 ; Komachi and Johnson, 1997 ), as well as several E3 ubiquitin ligases ( Tyers and Jorgensen, 2000 ). Crystal structures of representative WD40 domains alone and in complex with interacting proteins have been determined ( Wall et al ., 1995 ; Gaudet et al ., 1996 ; Lambright et al ., 1996 ; Sondek et al ., 1996 ; Sprague et al ., 2000 ). The WD40 repeats form four antiparallel β-strands producing β-sheets, which in turn fold into a propeller-like structure, denoted the β-propeller ( Sondek et al ., 1996 ). The β-propeller gains rigidity from hydrophobic interactions between the β-sheets, and solvent-exposed residues in the loops between the β-sheets are free to interact with other proteins. Residues in the loops of Gβ interact with Gα and phosducin, as well as with several other effectors ( Gaudet et al ., 1996 ; Lambright et al ., 1996 ; Ford et al ., 1998 ). Furthermore, loop residues in TUP1 are important for the interaction between TUP1 and the DNA-binding protein α2 ( Komachi and Johnson, 1997 ).

In this study, we characterize the interaction between the WD40 domain of COP1 and HY5 as well as with two new interaction partners, STO and STH. We define a novel WD40 domain-interacting motif conserved in all three COP1-interacting proteins. Furthermore, we identify residues important for the interaction both in the motif and in the WD40 domain of COP1, and reveal key features of the underlying interaction.

Discussion

This study defines a novel motif found in HY5 and two new COP1-interacting proteins, STO and a STO homolog (STH), which are essential for their interaction with the WD40 domain of COP1. We identify several key residues important for the interaction both in the COP1 WD40 domain and in the motif. Finally, substitutions in the COP1 WD40 domain or in the motif that abolish interaction between HY5 and COP1 in yeast also dramatically reduce the dark-dependent degradation of HY5 protein in plants.
