T helper 1 (T(H)1) differentiation and IFN-gamma production are crucial in 
cell-mediated immune responses. IL-12 is an important regulator of this process 
and mediates its effects through signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 4 (STAT4). IFN-gamma production is also regulated by the p38 
mitogen-activated kinase pathway, although the mechanisms are ill-defined. We 
show here that GADD45-beta and GADD45-gamma can induce STAT4 S721 
phosphorylation via the MKK6/p38 pathway. Thus, STAT4 could be a target that 
accounts for the defects in cell-mediated immunity associated with perturbations 
in the p38 pathway. To investigate the biological significance of STAT4 S721 
phosphorylation, we reconstituted primary spleen cells from STAT4-deficient mice 
with wild-type and mutated STAT4, by using a retroviral gene transduction. We 
demonstrated that expression of wild-type STAT4, but not the S721A mutant, 
restored normal T(H)1 differentiation and IFN-gamma synthesis. The inability of 
STAT4 S721 to restore IFN-gamma production was not caused by decreased IL-12R 
expression because the STAT4 S721 mutant also failed to restore IFN-gamma 
production in STAT4-deficient IL-12Rbeta2 transgenic cells. Importantly, STAT4 
S721A-transduced cells showed normal proliferative response to IL-12, 
illustrating that serine phosphorylation is not required for IL-12-induced 
proliferation. Additionally, the results imply the existence of STAT4 serine 
phosphorylation-dependent and -independent target genes. We conclude that 
phosphorylation of STAT4 on both tyrosine and serine residues is important in 
promoting normal T(H)1 differentiation and IFN-gamma secretion.
