Amylin receptors (AMYRs) are heterodimers of the calcitonin (CT) receptor (CTR) 
and one of three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), AMY1R, AMY2R, and 
AMY3R. Selective AMYR agonists and dual AMYR/CTR agonists are being developed as 
obesity treatments; however, the molecular basis for peptide binding and 
selectivity is unknown. We determined the structure and dynamics of active AMYRs 
with amylin, AMY1R with salmon CT (sCT), AMY2R with sCT or human CT (hCT), and 
CTR with amylin, sCT, or hCT. The conformation of amylin-bound complexes was 
similar for all AMYRs, constrained by the RAMP, and an ordered midpeptide motif 
that we call the bypass motif. The CT-bound AMYR complexes were distinct, 
overlapping the CT-bound CTR complexes. Our findings indicate that activation of 
AMYRs by CT-based peptides is distinct from their activation by amylin-based 
peptides. This has important implications for the development of AMYR 
therapeutics.
