Omi is a human serine protease whose catalytic domain is homologous to a 
bacterial heat shock endoprotease (HtrA), a protein indispensable to the 
survival of bacteria at elevated temperatures. Omi is expressed ubiquitously, 
and its protein product is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum 
of mammalian cells. Here we present the genomic structure of Omi, consisting of 
eight exons located on human chromosome 2p12-p13. Furthermore, we describe an 
alternatively splice form of Omi (D-Omi) that is expressed predominantly in the 
kidney, colon, and thyroid. D-Omi lacks peptide sequence encoded by two exons 
(exons III and VII). The absence of exon VII leads to a protein with a modified 
PDZ domain unable to interact with a known partner, the Mxi2 protein. The 
absence of exon III affects the catalytic domain and leads to a protein with no 
detectable protease activity. Our studies suggest that D-Omi may have a unique 
role in the normal function of kidney, colon, and thyroid.
