We show that the antiapoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, BFL-1, and BCL-w 
each bear a unique pattern of interaction with a panel of peptides derived from 
BH3 domains of BH3-only proteins. Cellular dependence on an antiapoptotic 
protein for survival can be decoded based on the pattern of mitochondrial 
sensitivity to this peptide panel, a strategy that we call BH3 profiling. 
Dependence on antiapoptotic proteins correlates with sequestration of activator 
BH3-only proteins like BID or BIM by antiapoptotic proteins. Sensitivity to the 
cell-permeable BCL-2 antagonist ABT-737 is also related to priming of BCL-2 by 
activator BH3-only molecules. Our data allow us to distinguish a cellular state 
we call "primed for death," which can be determined by BH3 profiling and which 
correlates with dependence on antiapoptotic family members for survival.
