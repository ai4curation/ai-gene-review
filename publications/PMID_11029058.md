During the meiotic cell cycle, a surveillance mechanism called the "pachytene 
checkpoint" ensures proper chromosome segregation by preventing meiotic 
progression when recombination and chromosome synapsis are defective. The 
silencing protein Dot1 (also known as Pch1) is required for checkpoint-mediated 
pachytene arrest of the zip1 and dmc1 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In 
the absence of DOT1, the zip1 and dmc1 mutants inappropriately progress through 
meiosis, generating inviable meiotic products. Other components of the pachytene 
checkpoint include the nucleolar protein Pch2 and the heterochromatin component 
Sir2. In dot1, disruption of the checkpoint correlates with the loss of 
concentration of Pch2 and Sir2 in the nucleolus. In addition to its checkpoint 
function, Dot1 blocks the repair of meiotic double-strand breaks by a 
Rad54-dependent pathway of recombination between sister chromatids. In 
vegetative cells, mutation of DOT1 results in delocalization of Sir3 from 
telomeres, accounting for the impaired telomeric silencing in dot1.
