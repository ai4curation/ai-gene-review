We have identified a cytokine of the IL-6 family and named it novel 
neurotrophin-1/B cell-stimulating factor-3 (NNT-1/BSF-3). NNT-1/BSF-3 cDNA was 
cloned from activated Jurkat human T cell lymphoma cells. Its sequence predicts 
a 225-aa protein with a 27-aa signal peptide, a molecular mass of 22 kDa in 
mature form, and the highest homology to cardiotrophin-1 and ciliary 
neurotrophic factor. The gene for NNT-1/BSF-3 is on chromosome 11q13. A murine 
equivalent to NNT-1/BSF-3 also was identified, which shows 96% homology to human 
NNT-1/BSF-3. NNT-1/BSF-3 mRNA is found mainly in lymph nodes and spleen. 
NNT-1/BSF-3 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of glycoprotein 130 (gp130), 
leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta, and signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 in the SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cells. NNT-1/BSF-3 shows 
activities typical of IL-6 family members. In vitro, it supports the survival of 
chicken embryo motor and sympathetic neurons. In mice, it induces serum amyloid 
A, potentiates the induction by IL-1 of corticosterone and IL-6, and causes body 
weight loss and B cell hyperplasia with serum IgG and IgM increase. NNT-1/BSF-3 
is a gp130 activator with B-cell stimulating capability.
