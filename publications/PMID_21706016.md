Signaling pathways are commonly organized through inducible protein-protein 
interactions, mediated by adaptor proteins that link activated receptors to 
cytoplasmic effectors. However, we have little quantitative data regarding the 
kinetics with which such networks assemble and dissolve to generate specific 
cellular responses. To address this deficiency, we designed a mass spectrometry 
method, affinity purification-selected reaction monitoring (AP-SRM), which we 
used to comprehensively and quantitatively investigate changes in protein 
interactions with GRB2, an adaptor protein that participates in a remarkably 
diverse set of protein complexes involved in multiple aspects of cellular 
function. Our data reliably define context-specific and time-dependent networks 
that form around GRB2 after stimulation, and reveal core and growth 
factor-selective complexes comprising 90 proteins identified as interacting with 
GRB2 in HEK293T cells. Capturing a key hub protein and dissecting its 
interactions by SRM should be equally applicable to quantifying signaling 
dynamics for a range of hubs in protein interaction networks.
