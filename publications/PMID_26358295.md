Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that alter their morphology in response to 
cellular signaling and differentiation through balanced fusion and fission. In 
this study, we found that the mitochondrial inner membrane ATPase ATAD3A 
interacted with ccdc56/MITRAC12/COA3, a subunit of the cytochrome oxidase 
(COX)-assembly complex. Overproduction of ccdc56 in HeLa cells resulted in 
fragmented mitochondrial morphology, while mitochondria were highly elongated in 
ccdc56-repressed cells by the defective recruitment of the fission factor Drp1. 
We also found that mild and chronic inhibition of COX led to mitochondrial 
elongation, as seen in ccdc56-repressed cells. These results indicate that 
ccdc56 positively regulates mitochondrial fission via regulation of COX activity 
and the mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1, and thus, suggest a novel 
relationship between COX assembly and mitochondrial morphology.
