The amyloid-beta (Abeta) cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
maintains that accumulation of Abeta peptide constitutes a critical event in the 
early disease pathogenesis. The direct binding between Abeta and apolipoprotein 
E (apoE) is an important factor implicated in both Abeta clearance and its 
deposition in the brain's parenchyma and the walls of meningoencephalic vessels 
as cerebral amyloid angiopathy. With the aim of testing the effect of blocking 
the apoE/Abeta interaction in vivo as a potential novel therapeutic target for 
AD pharmacotherapy, we have developed Abeta12-28P, which is a 
blood-brain-barrier-permeable nontoxic, and nonfibrillogenic synthetic peptide 
homologous to the apoE binding site on the full-length Abeta. Abeta12-28P binds 
with high affinity to apoE, preventing its binding to Abeta, but has no direct 
effect on Abeta aggregation. Abeta12-28P shows a strong pharmacological effect 
in vivo. Its systemic administration resulted in a significant reduction of 
Abeta plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy burden and a reduction of the 
total brain level of Abeta in two AD transgenic mice models. The treatment did 
not affect the levels of soluble Abeta fraction or Abeta oligomers, indicating 
that inhibition of the apoE/Abeta interaction in vivo has a net effect of 
increasing Abeta clearance over deposition and at the same time does not create 
conditions favoring formation of toxic oligomers. Furthermore, behavioral 
studies demonstrated that treatment with Abeta12-28P prevents a memory deficit 
in transgenic animals. These findings provide evidence of another therapeutic 
approach for AD.
