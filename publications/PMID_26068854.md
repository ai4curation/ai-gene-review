The spindle checkpoint of the cell division cycle senses kinetochores that are 
not attached to microtubules and prevents precocious onset of anaphase, which 
can lead to aneuploidy. The nuclear division cycle 80 complex (Ndc80C) is a 
major microtubule receptor at the kinetochore. Ndc80C also mediates the 
kinetochore recruitment of checkpoint proteins. We found that the checkpoint 
protein kinase monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) directly bound to Ndc80C through two 
independent interactions. Both interactions involved the microtubule-binding 
surfaces of Ndc80C and were directly inhibited in the presence of microtubules. 
Elimination of one such interaction in human cells caused checkpoint defects 
expected from a failure to detect unattached kinetochores. Competition between 
Mps1 and microtubules for Ndc80C binding thus constitutes a direct mechanism for 
the detection of unattached kinetochores.
