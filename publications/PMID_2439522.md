PDGF induces c-myc mRNA expression in MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells but does 
not stimulate cell replication.

The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) modulated growth response of the MG-63 
human osteosarcoma cell line, which neither expresses c-sis mRNA nor secretes a 
PDGF analogue, was characterized. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that the MG-63 
cells have 23,000 receptors per cell with a Kd of 5 X 10(-11) M. The receptor 
became phosphorylated, in a PDGF concentration-dependent manner, when 
32P-orthophosphate-labeled cells were treated with PDGF for 3 h at 4 degrees C. 
The phosphorylated receptor was identified by autoradiography and gel 
electrophoresis after isolation of the 32P-labeled receptor using a solid-phase 
monoclonal antibody directed against phosphotyrosine. Binding of the receptor to 
the antibody was inhibited by 5 mM phenyl phosphate, further suggesting that 
PDGF stimulated tyrosine-specific receptor autophosphorylation. In addition, 
treatment of MG-63 cells with PDGF for 3 h at 37 degrees C induced a 7.5-fold 
increase in c-myc mRNA accumulation as analyzed on Northern gels. However, MG-63 
cells grew equally well in either serum-(which contains PDGF) or plasma-(which 
does not) supplemented medium. Furthermore, PDGF did not stimulate DNA synthesis 
in growth arrested MG-63 cells, nor did it potentiate DNA synthesis modulated by 
somatomedin C. Thus MG-63 cells are a naturally occurring cell variant in which 
PDGF stimulates c-myc expression but does not modulate mitogenesis.
