Endotoxin tolerance impairs IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 4 and 
TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 activation, K63-linked polyubiquitination and 
assembly of IRAK1, TNF receptor-associated factor 6, and IkappaB kinase gamma 
and increases A20 expression.

Endotoxin tolerance reprograms Toll-like receptor 4 responses by impairing 
LPS-elicited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines without inhibiting 
expression of anti-inflammatory or anti-microbial mediators. In septic patients, 
Toll-like receptor tolerance is thought to underlie decreased pro-inflammatory 
cytokine expression in response to LPS and increased incidence of microbial 
infections. The impact of endotoxin tolerance on recruitment, post-translational 
modifications and signalosome assembly of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 
4, IRAK1, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK) 
1, and IκB kinase (IKK) γ is largely unknown. We report that endotoxin 
tolerization of THP1 cells and human monocytes impairs LPS-mediated receptor 
recruitment and activation of IRAK4, ablates K63-linked polyubiquitination of 
IRAK1 and TRAF6, compromises assembly of IRAK1-TRAF6 and IRAK1-IKKγ platforms, 
and inhibits TAK1 activation. Deficiencies in these signaling events in 
LPS-tolerant cells coincided with increased expression of A20, an essential 
deubiquitination enzyme, and sustained A20-IRAK1 associations. Overexpression of 
A20 inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and ablated NF-κB reporter 
activation driven by ectopic expression of MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK2, TRAF6, and 
TAK1/TAB1, while not affecting the responses induced by IKKβ and p65. A20 shRNA 
knockdown abolished LPS tolerization of THP1 cells, mechanistically linking A20 
and endotoxin tolerance. Thus, deficient LPS-induced activation of IRAK4 and 
TAK1, K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1 and TRAF6, and disrupted 
IRAK1-TRAF6 and IRAK1-IKKγ assembly associated with increased A20 expression and 
A20-IRAK1 interactions are new determinants of endotoxin tolerance.
