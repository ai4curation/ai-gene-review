The vacuolar H+-ATPase is an enzymatic complex that functions in an 
ATP-dependent manner to pump protons across membranes and acidify organelles, 
thereby creating the proton/pH gradient required for membrane trafficking by 
several different types of transporters. We describe heterozygous point variants 
in ATP6V0C, encoding the c-subunit in the membrane bound integral domain of the 
vacuolar H+-ATPase, in 27 patients with neurodevelopmental abnormalities with or 
without epilepsy. Corpus callosum hypoplasia and cardiac abnormalities were also 
present in some patients. In silico modelling suggested that the patient 
variants interfere with the interactions between the ATP6V0C and ATP6V0A 
subunits during ATP hydrolysis. Consistent with decreased vacuolar H+-ATPase 
activity, functional analyses conducted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed 
reduced LysoSensor fluorescence and reduced growth in media containing varying 
concentrations of CaCl2. Knockdown of ATP6V0C in Drosophila resulted in 
increased duration of seizure-like behaviour, and the expression of selected 
patient variants in Caenorhabditis elegans led to reduced growth, motor 
dysfunction and reduced lifespan. In summary, this study establishes ATP6V0C as 
an important disease gene, describes the clinical features of the associated 
neurodevelopmental disorder and provides insight into disease mechanisms.
