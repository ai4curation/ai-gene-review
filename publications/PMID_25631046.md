During injury, cells are vulnerable to apoptosis from a variety of stress 
conditions including DNA damage causing double-stranded breaks. Without repair, 
these breaks lead to aberrations in DNA replication and transcription, leading 
to apoptosis. A major response to DNA damage is provided by the protein kinase 
ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) that is capable of commanding a plethora of 
signaling networks for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and even apoptosis. A key 
element in the DNA damage response is the mobilization of activating proteins 
into the cell nucleus to repair damaged DNA. BRAT1 is one of these proteins, and 
it functions as an activator of ATM by maintaining its phosphorylated status 
while also keeping other phosphatases at bay. However, it is unknown how BRAT1 
is trafficked into the cell nucleus to maintain ATM phosphorylation. Here we 
demonstrate that Ndfip1-mediated ubiquitination of BRAT1 leads to BRAT1 
trafficking into the cell nucleus. Without Ndfip1, BRAT1 failed to translocate 
to the nucleus. Under genotoxic stress, cells showed increased expression of 
both Ndfip1 and phosphorylated ATM. Following brain injury, neurons show 
increased expression of Ndfip1 and nuclear translocation of BRAT1. These results 
point to Ndfip1 as a sensor protein during cell injury and Ndfip1 up-regulation 
as a cue for BRAT1 ubiquitination by Nedd4 E3 ligases, followed by nuclear 
translocation of BRAT1.
