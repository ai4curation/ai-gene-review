Cardiomyocyte proliferation is high in early development and decreases 
progressively with gestation, resulting in the lack of a robust cardiomyocyte 
proliferative response in the adult heart after injury. Little is understood 
about how both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous signals are integrated to 
regulate the balance of cardiomyocyte proliferation during development. In this 
study, we show that a single transcription factor, Foxp1, can control the 
balance of cardiomyocyte proliferation during development by targeting different 
pathways in the endocardium and myocardium. Endocardial loss of Foxp1 results in 
decreased Fgf3/Fgf16/Fgf17/Fgf20 expression in the heart, leading to reduced 
cardiomyocyte proliferation. This loss of myocardial proliferation can be 
rescued by exogenous Fgf20, and is mediated, in part, by Foxp1 repression of 
Sox17. In contrast, myocardial-specific loss of Foxp1 results in increased 
cardiomyocyte proliferation and decreased differentiation, leading to increased 
myocardial mass and neonatal demise. We show that Nkx2.5 is a direct target of 
Foxp1 repression, and Nkx2.5 expression is increased in Foxp1-deficient 
myocardium. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of Nkx2.5 leads to increased 
cardiomyocyte proliferation and increased ventricular mass, similar to the 
myocardial-specific loss of Foxp1. These data show that Foxp1 coordinates the 
balance of cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation through cell 
lineage-specific regulation of Fgf ligand and Nkx2.5 expression.
