The Nova family of proteins are target antigens in the autoimmune disorder 
paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia and contain K-homology (KH)-type RNA 
binding domains. The Nova-1 protein has recently been shown to regulate 
alternative splicing of the alpha2 glycine receptor subunit pre-mRNA by binding 
to an intronic element containing repeats of the tetranucleotide UCAU. Here, we 
have used selection-amplification to demonstrate that the KH3 domain of Nova 
recognizes a single UCAY element in the context of a 20-base hairpin RNA; the 
UCAY tetranucleotide is optimally presented as a loop element of the hairpin 
scaffold and requires protein residues C-terminal to the previously defined KH 
domain. These results suggest that KH domains in general recognize 
tetranucleotide motifs and that biological RNA targets of KH domains may use 
either RNA secondary structure or repeated sequence elements to achieve high 
affinity and specificity of protein binding.
