The utilization of organized supramolecular assemblies to exploit the 
synergistic interactions afforded by close proximity, both for enzymatic 
synthesis and for the degradation of recalcitrant substrates, is an emerging 
theme in cellular biology. Anaerobic bacteria harness a multiprotein complex, 
termed the "cellulosome," for efficient degradation of the plant cell wall. This 
megadalton catalytic machine organizes an enzymatic consortium on a multifaceted 
molecular scaffold whose "cohesin" domains interact with corresponding 
"dockerin" domains of the enzymes. Here we report the structure of the 
cohesin-dockerin complex from Clostridium thermocellum at 2.2-A resolution. The 
data show that the beta-sheet cohesin domain interacts predominantly with one of 
the helices of the dockerin. Whereas the structure of the cohesin remains 
essentially unchanged, the loop-helix-helix-loop-helix motif of the dockerin 
undergoes conformational change and ordering compared with its solution 
structure, although the classical 12-residue EF-hand coordination to two calcium 
ions is maintained. Significantly, internal sequence duplication within the 
dockerin is manifested in near-perfect internal twofold symmetry, suggesting 
that both "halves" of the dockerin may interact with cohesins in a similar 
manner, thus providing a higher level of structure to the cellulosome and 
possibly explaining the presence of "polycellulosomes." The structure provides 
an explanation for the lack of cross-species recognition between 
cohesin-dockerin pairs and thus provides a blueprint for the rational design, 
construction, and exploitation of these catalytic assemblies.
