We used electron microscopy to examine the structure of human DNA pol gamma, the 
heterotrimeric mtDNA replicase implicated in certain mitochondrial diseases and 
aging models. Separate analysis of negatively stained preparations of the 
catalytic subunit, pol gammaA, and of the holoenzyme including a dimeric 
accessory factor, pol gammaB(2), permitted unambiguous identification of the 
position of the accessory factor within the holoenzyme. The model explains 
protection of a partial chymotryptic cleavage site after residue L(549) of pol 
gammaA upon binding of the accessory subunit. This interaction region is near 
residue 467 of pol gammaA, where a disease-related mutation has been reported to 
impair binding of the B subunit. One pol gammaB subunit dominates contacts with 
the catalytic subunit, while the second B subunit is largely exposed to solvent. 
A model for pol gamma is discussed that considers the effects of known mutations 
in the accessory subunit and the interaction of the enzyme with DNA.
