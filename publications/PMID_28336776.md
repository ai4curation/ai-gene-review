Caspases are key enzymes responsible for mediating apoptotic cell death. Across 
species, caspase-2 is the most conserved caspase and stands out due to unique 
features. Apart from cell death, caspase-2 also regulates autophagy, genomic 
stability and ageing. Caspase-2 requires dimerization for its activation which 
is primarily accomplished by recruitment to high molecular weight protein 
complexes in cells. Here, we demonstrate that apoptosis inhibitor 5 (API5/AAC11) 
is an endogenous and direct inhibitor of caspase-2. API5 protein directly binds 
to the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of caspase-2 and impedes dimerization 
and activation of caspase-2. Interestingly, recombinant API5 directly inhibits 
full length but not processed caspase-2. Depletion of endogenous API5 leads to 
an increase in caspase-2 dimerization and activation. Consistently, loss of API5 
sensitizes cells to caspase-2-dependent apoptotic cell death. These results 
establish API5/AAC-11 as a direct inhibitor of caspase-2 and shed further light 
onto mechanisms driving the activation of this poorly understood caspase.
