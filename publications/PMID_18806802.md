Cyclophilin D (CypD, encoded by Ppif) is an integral part of the mitochondrial 
permeability transition pore, whose opening leads to cell death. Here we show 
that interaction of CypD with mitochondrial amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) 
potentiates mitochondrial, neuronal and synaptic stress. The CypD-deficient 
cortical mitochondria are resistant to Abeta- and Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial 
swelling and permeability transition. Additionally, they have an increased 
calcium buffering capacity and generate fewer mitochondrial reactive oxygen 
species. Furthermore, the absence of CypD protects neurons from Abeta- and 
oxidative stress-induced cell death. Notably, CypD deficiency substantially 
improves learning and memory and synaptic function in an Alzheimer's disease 
mouse model and alleviates Abeta-mediated reduction of long-term potentiation. 
Thus, the CypD-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore is directly 
linked to the cellular and synaptic perturbations observed in the pathogenesis 
of Alzheimer's disease. Blockade of CypD may be a therapeutic strategy in 
Alzheimer's disease.
