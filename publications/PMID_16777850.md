Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) plays critical roles in the control 
of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Smad proteins are 
substrates of the TGF-beta type I receptor and are responsible for transducing 
receptor signals to target genes in the nucleus. The PIAS (protein inhibitor of 
activated STAT) proteins were originally identified as transcriptional 
co-regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway. Subsequently, cross-talk between the PIAS 
proteins and other signaling pathways has been shown to be involved in various 
cellular processes. Importantly, PIAS proteins modulate TGF-beta signaling by 
regulating the transcriptional activity of Smad3. In this study we tested 
whether hZimp10, a novel PIAS-like protein, acts as other PIAS proteins to 
regulate Smad3-mediated transcription. We show that expression of exogenous 
hZimp10 enhances the transcriptional activity of Smad3, which appears to be 
Smad4-dependent and responsive to TGF-beta induction. Furthermore, knockdown of 
endogenous hZimp10 reduced the transcriptional activity of Smad3. A 
protein-protein interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 with hZimp10 was identified 
in glutathione S-transferase-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The Miz 
domain of hZimp10 and the MH2 domains of Smad3 and Smad4 were mapped as the 
regions responsible for binding. Results from immunostaining assays further 
demonstrated that Smad3, Smad4, and hZimp10 co-localize within cell nuclei. 
Finally, we demonstrated that Smad3/4-mediated transcription is significantly 
impaired in response to TGF-beta induction in Zimp10 null (zimp10-/-) embryonic 
fibroblasts. Taken together, these results provide the first line of evidence to 
demonstrate a role for Zimp10 in regulating the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway.
