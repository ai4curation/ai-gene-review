Cell polarity is induced and maintained by separation of the apical and 
basolateral domains through specialized cell-cell junctions. The Crumbs protein 
and its binding partners are involved in formation and stabilization of adherens 
junctions. In this study, we describe a novel component of the mammalian Crumbs 
complex, the FERM domain protein EPB41L5, which associates with the 
intracellular domains of all three Crumbs homologs through its FERM domain. 
Surprisingly, the same FERM domain is involved in binding to the HOOK domain of 
MPP5/PALS1, a previously identified interactor of Crumbs. Co-expression and 
co-localization studies suggested that in several epithelial derived tissues 
Epb4.1l5 interacts with at least one Crumbs homolog, and with Mpp5. Although at 
early embryonic stages Epb4.1l5 is found at the basolateral membrane 
compartment, in adult tissues it co-localizes at the apical domain with Crumbs 
proteins and Mpp5. Overexpression of Epb4.1l5 in polarized MDCK cells affects 
tightness of cell junctions and results in disorganization of the tight junction 
markers ZO-1 and PATJ. Our results emphasize the importance of a conserved 
Crumbs-MPP5-EPB41L5 polarity complex in mammals.
