Hsp70s are a ubiquitous family of molecular chaperones involved in many cellular 
processes. Two Hsp70s, Lhs1p and Kar2p, are required for protein biogenesis in 
the yeast endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we found that Lhs1p and Kar2p 
specifically interacted to couple, and coordinately regulate, their respective 
activities. Lhs1p stimulated Kar2p by providing a specific nucleotide exchange 
activity, whereas Kar2p reciprocally activated the Lhs1p adenosine 
triphosphatase (ATPase). The two ATPase activities are coupled, and their 
coordinated regulation is essential for normal function in vivo.
