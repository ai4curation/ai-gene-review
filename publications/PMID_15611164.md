In the yeast S. cerevisiae, ribosome assembly is linked to environmental 
conditions by the coordinate transcriptional regulation of genes required for 
ribosome biogenesis. In this study we show that two nonessential 
stress-responsive genes, YAR1 and LTV1, function in 40S subunit production. We 
provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Yar1, a small ankyrin-repeat 
protein, physically interacts with RpS3, a component of the 40S subunit, and 
with Ltv1, a protein recently identified as a substoichiometric component of a 
43S preribosomal particle. We demonstrate that cells lacking YAR1 or LTV1 are 
hypersensitive to particular protein synthesis inhibitors and exhibit aberrant 
polysome profiles, with a reduced absolute number of 40S subunits and an excess 
of free 60S subunits. Surprisingly, both mutants are also hypersensitive to a 
variety of environmental stress conditions. Overexpression of RPS3 suppresses 
both the stress sensitivity and the ribosome biogenesis defect of Deltayar1 
mutants, but does not suppress either defect in Deltaltv1 mutants. We propose 
that YAR1 and LTV1 play distinct, nonessential roles in 40S subunit production. 
The stress-sensitive phenotypes of strains lacking these genes reveal a hitherto 
unknown link between ribosome biogenesis factors and environmental stress 
sensitivity.
