Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a critical mediator of apoptotic 
signaling pathways initiated by a variety of death stimuli. Its activity is 
tightly controlled by various mechanisms such as covalent modification and 
protein-protein interaction. One of the proteins that control ASK1 function is 
14-3-3zeta, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family. Here, we report that ASK1 is 
capable of binding to other isoforms of 14-3-3, suggesting that binding ASK1 is 
a general property of the 14-3-3 family. In support of this notion, mutational 
analysis revealed that the ASK1/14-3-3 interaction was mediated by the conserved 
amphipathic groove of 14-3-3 with some residue selectivity. Functionally, 
expression of various isoforms of 14-3-3 suppressed ASK1-induced apoptosis. To 
understand how 14-3-3 controls the ASK1 activity, we examined intracellular 
localization of ASK1 upon 14-3-3 co-expression. We found that 14-3-3 
co-expression is correlated with the translocation of ASK1 from the cytoplasm to 
a perinuclear localization, likely the ER compartment. Consistent with this 
notion, ASK1(S967A), a 14-3-3 binding defective mutant of ASK, showed no change 
in intracellular distribution upon 14-3-3 co-expression. These data support a 
model that 14-3-3 proteins regulate the proapoptotic function of ASK1 in part by 
controlling its subcellular distribution.
