Introduction

The good quality of oocyte is essential for female fertility [ 1 ]. In the post-natal ovaries of mammalian species, fully grown oocytes in follicles are arrested at diplotene stage of the first meiotic prophase, which is also known as the germinal vesicle (GV) stage [ 2 ]. With the stimulation of pituitary gonadotropins in mid-estrus, meiosis resumes with the signature of GV breakdown (GVBD) followed by chromatin condensation [ 3 ]. During the prometaphase of meiosis I (Pro-MI), the spindle is assembled accompanied with the capture of condensed chromosomes. When all chromosomes align at the spindle middle plate in the metaphase of meiosis I (MI), the meiotic cell cycle progresses to anaphase I (AI), followed by chromosomes segregation and the exclusion of the polar body-1 (PB1) [ 4 ]. Then the ovulated oocytes entered another cell cycle arrest at the metaphase of meiosis II (MII) until fertilization [ 5 ]. Errors in meiotic progression result in fertilization failure or abnormalities of preimplantation embryonic development, leading to early abortion and female infertility.

Oocyte meiosis is regulated by a hierarchical network that ensures the normal cell cycle progression and the accurate chromosome separation [ 6 ]. Since de novo mRNA transcription ceases in fully grown oocytes, the meiotic maturation, fertilization, and the first embryonic division are completely supported by RNAs and proteins stored in the GV oocytes [ 7 , 8 ]. Particularly, the progression of oocyte meiosis requires timely degradation of specific proteins mediated by the ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent mechanisms.

Protein ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligases, in particular, play key roles during both meiotic and mitotic cell cycle progression by triggering specific proteins degradation [ 9 ]. For example, an anaphase promoting complex (APC) initiates the metaphaseâ€“anaphase transition by inducing the degradation of cyclin B and securin [ 10 ]. Our previous studies have shown that cullin ring-finger ubiquitin ligase 4 (CRL4) has multiple functions in the maintenance of oocyte survival, meiotic cell cycle progression, and genome reprogramming after fertilization [ 11 ]. CRL4 plays versatile biological roles by employing nearly 90 different WD40 repeat-containing adaptor proteins, known as DDB1-cullin-4-associated factors (DCAFs) [ 12 , 13 ]. These DCAFs recruit a wide spectrum of substrates to CRL4 for poly- or mono-ubiquitylation [ 14 , 15 ]. DCAF1 and DCAF2 are evolutionarily conserved substrate receptors of CRL4 [ 16 ]. Using conditional knockout mouse models, we revealed that both are key mediators of CRL4 function in mammalian oocytes. While DCAF1 regulates the hydroxymethylation of genomic DNA to maintain oocyte survival and to promote zygotic genome reprogramming after fertilization [ 11 , 17 , 18 ], DCAF2 is a previously unrecognized maternal factor that safeguards zygotic genome stability by preventing DNA re-replication in the first mitotic cell cycle of the zygote [ 19 ].

In addition to DCAF1 and DCAF2, we recently identified DCAF13 as a novel CRL4 adaptor conserved from yeast to human [ 20 , 21 ]. DCAF13 is essential for oocyte survival in primordial follicles as well as for preimplantation embryonic development [ 20 , 21 ]. Dcaf13 is an early zygotic gene in both murine and human embryos and is expressed mainly at the 8-cell to morula stages. Dcaf13 knockout murine embryos are arrested at the 8- to 16-cell stage before compaction, and this situation causes preimplantation mortality [ 21 ]. To bypass the early embryonic lethality caused by Dcaf13 knockout, we generated an oocyte-specific Dcaf13 deletion mouse model, and discovered that this gene plays key roles for oocyte chromatin configuration transition and follicle development [ 20 ]. Although CRL4-DCAF13 facilitates genome activation in preimplantation embryos by polyubiquitinating and removing the histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9) trimethylase SUV39H1, this mechanism did not seem to be essential in growing oocytes because the H3K9 trimethylation level did not increase in Dcaf13 knockout oocytes [ 20 ]. Furthermore, analyses of RNA-sequencing results indicated that Dcaf13 deletion did not significantly affect the transcriptome in oocytes [ 20 ]. Therefore, the ubiquitination target proteins of CRL4-DCAF13 in growing oocytes remain obscure.

The Dcaf13 deletion in oocytes results in a low follicular developmental rate to the antral stage [ 20 ]. On the other hand, some of these Dcaf13 null oocytes can grow to the GV stage with sizes close to the fully grown wild-type (WT) oocytes, but the females remain sterile. We, therefore, suspected that the Dcaf13 -deleted oocytes have meiotic maturation defects, and thus failed to be fertilized. In this study, we carefully investigated the meiotic maturation process in Dcaf13 -deleted oocytes, and demonstrated that the CRL4-DCAF13-regulated biochemical processes are crucial for timely meiotic resumption, normal spindle assembly, accurate chromosome separation, and smooth MI-to-MII transition in maturing mouse oocytes. Mechanistically, CRL4 DCAF13 targets the polyubiquitination and degradation of PTEN, a lipid phosphatase that inhibits the PI3K pathway as well as oocyte growth and maturation. Therefore, DCAF13 stimulates the meiotic resumption-coupled activation of protein synthesis in oocytes, partially by maintaining the activity of PI3K signaling pathway. These findings not only described novel functions of DCAF13 in supporting oocyte development, but also elucidated a long-looked-for regulation mechanism of PTEN and PI3K signaling pathway in oocytes.

Discussion

The gene encoding DCAF13 was first discovered in yeast in 2003 [ 43 ], and was later shown to be evolutionarily conserved and to perform key functions in the preimplantation embryos. CRL4 DCAF13 interacts with the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 and directs it to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and therefore facilitates the removal of trimethylated histone H3 at lysine-9 and early zygotic gene expression. On the other hand, its participation in post-natal development and hemostasis was not studied in the first report, owing to the early mortality of Dcaf13 knockout embryos at the 8â€“16-cell stage.

After generating a novel Dcaf13 -floxed mouse strain, we studied the function of Dcaf13 in oogenesis by knocking out this gene in oocyte using Zp3 - Cre . In growing oocytes, nucleolus-localized DCAF13 is an important component of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-processing complex. DCAF13 deletion in oocytes led to follicle growth retardation, impaired NSN-SN configuration transition, and ultimately caused POF. Further exploration showed that DCAF13 participates in the 18S rRNA processing in growing oocytes. The lack of 18S rRNA caused a ribosome assembly disorder and then reduced global protein synthesis [ 20 ]. In addition, the zygotes derived from these defective oocytes do not have developmental potential and are arrested at the 2-cell stage after fertilization, most likely because the transcription activation of zygotic genome failed to occur [ 44 ].

However, the biochemical function of DCAF13, as an adaptor subunit of CRL4 ubiquitin E3 ligase, in mediating target protein degradation, has been investigated in oocytes. Maternal Dcaf13 knockout inhibited protein synthesis, but had little impact on mRNA transcription and histone methylation levels in oocytes [ 20 ]. These observation suggested that DCAF13 functions in oocytes by mechanisms other than targeting the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 for degradation.

In this study, we further demonstrated that DCAF13 is required for normal meiotic cell cycle progression of oocytes. To assess the impact of Dcaf13 knockout on meiotic maturation, which is an event later than intrafollicular oocyte growth, we isolated GV oocytes from 4-week-old Dcaf13 fl/fl ;Gdf9 - Cre female mice for analyses. At this young age, these mice have not shown obvious signs of premature ovarian insufficiency. Therefore, we were able to harvest fully grown oocytes from the ovaries, although the numbers are fewer than normal.

Oocyte meiotic resumption is accompanied by a remarkable increase in protein synthesis. These temporally translated proteins play key roles in the principal meiotic events, such as reorganization of microtubules, meiotic spindle assembly, condensation and segregation of chromosomes, as well as meiosis II (MII) arrest [ 45 ]. Therefore, the quality of oocyte meiotic maturation is to a large extent dependent on protein synthesis as the regulation of gene expression at the transcription level at the meiosis stage is halted [ 30 ]. Our current results indicated that DCAF13 expressed in both growing and fully grown oocytes are crucial for the translation of key meiosis regulators including cyclin B1, CDC25B, and CDC20. Both cyclin B and CDC25B are important to activate CDK1 during meiotic resumption. It is well recognized that CDK1 activity is essential to maintain the chromosomes in a condensed state during oocyte maturation. Therefore, decreased cyclin B1 and CDC25B levels may be the cause of chromosome condensation defect in Dcaf13 knockout oocytes.

Based on our recent findings, DCAF13 might ensure adequate global protein translation activity of maturing oocytes by regulating rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly during oocyte growth [ 20 ]. Although DCAF13 is enriched in nucleolus-like bodies in oocytes and early embryos, this CRL4 adaptor is also detected in the neoplasm, suggesting that it also has nucleolus-independent function. In addition, the fact that depletion of DCAF13 in transcriptionally inactive GV oocytes also impaired meiosis indicates DCAF13 has a direct function in meiotic maturation in addition to indirectly stimulating rRNA transcription and splicing.

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we searched the human protein interactome and noticed the potential interaction between DCAF13 and PTEN, the key inhibitor of PI3K pathway. This observation enlightened us because it has been reported that PI3K pathway triggers meiotic cell cycle progression in oocytes by multiple mechanisms [ 38 , 39 , 41 , 46 ]. Results of further experiments collectively established that CRL4 DCAF13 maintains PTEN protein at a low level by mediating their polyubiquitination and degradation, and PTEN accumulation led to defective protein synthesis and meiotic maturation in oocytes. These two Dcaf13 -dependent mechanisms (rRNA synthesis and PTEN degradation) are not exclusive to each other, and may both contribute to the physiological importance of DCAF13 in oogenesis. This finding also answered a long-standing question of how the activity of PI3K signaling pathway, particularly the abundance of PTEN protein level, is regulated by intraoocyte factors.

This question was raised as early as more than a decade ago when the fundamental role of PI3K pathway in oocyte growth and maturation was beginning to be recognized. PI3K activation play an important role in growth factor-dependent oocyte meiotic maturation. Inhibition of PI3K as well as AKT, the key kinase in PI3K pathway, in maturing oocytes impaired GVBD, spindle assembly, and chromosome alignment [ 41 , 46 â€“ 50 ]. AKT directly phosphorylates and activates cGMP-inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A), which is essential for meiotic resumption of GV stage-arrested oocytes [ 39 ]. Furthermore, translation of a subset of oocyte mRNAs is under the control of somatic cell inputs acting through the PI(3)K pathway [ 38 ]. These regulation functions are involved in establishing the competence of oocytes to accomplish meiotic maturation. However, the mechanism that regulates PI3K/AKT activity in oocytes was not investigated before we identified the CRL4 DCAF13 -mediated PTEN degradation pathway. Two recent studies reported that DCAF13 expression was upregulated in human osteosarcoma cells and hepatocellular carcinoma samples [ 40 , 51 ]. Employing multivariate Cox regression analysis, these authors showed that DCAF13 was a prognostic predictor of survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients [ 51 ]. They suggest that DCAF13 is a potential cell cycle regulator. Disrupting the stability of CRL4B DCAF13 E3 ligase by small molecules resulted in PTEN accumulation and greatly inhibited osteosarcoma cell growth [ 40 ]. Consistent with this finding but at an advantage of using an in vivo model system, we demonstrated that DCAF13 was involved in meiotic division based on its regulation of protein synthesis potentially by removing PTEN and activating PI3K pathways (Fig. 8 ).

The results of this study also shed light on the mechanism that associated with our recent work in which we describe a DCAF13 downregulation-associated functional decline of the oocyte quality and developmental potential. In that study, we reported that proper rRNA synthesis and ribosome accumulation mediated by DCAF13 and its associated nucleolar proteins, such as fibrillarin, are prerequisites of translational activation during oocyte GV-MII transition [ 20 ]. Nevertheless, how does oocyte DCAF13, as one of substrate receptors of the CRL4 complex, perform an E3 ubiquitin ligase function in regulating follicular development was unexplained. The discovery that CRL4 DCAF13 maintains an appropriate activity of PI3K pathway in oocytes logically fits in its role in developing follicles. Activity of PI3K pathway is required for primordial follicle activation, follicle growth, and maintenance [ 52 , 53 ]. PTEN is highly expressed in oocytes at the primordial follicle stage and represses their awakening [ 36 ]. By mechanisms previously unclear, PTENâ€™s inhibitory effect was relieved in some oocytes. Then these oocytes enter the pool of growing follicles. DCAF13 is strongly expressed in growing follicles, and may provide a key intracellular signal that facilitates the partial removal of PTEN and maintains a high activity of PI3K signaling. The phenotype of Dcaf13 knockout in oocytes (retarded follicle growth and premature ovarian insufficiency) partially mimics those of Pdk1 and Rps6 knockout (both genes encode key components of PI3K pathway) [ 54 ], suggesting that CRL4 DCAF13 -mediated PTEN degradation is also a permissive mechanism for normal follicle development.

Collectively, in this study, we described meiotic maturation-related phenotypes observed in oocyte-specific Dcaf13 knockout mice (Fig. 8 ) in addition to the defects of follicle development. We also identified PTEN, an important PI3K pathway regulator and a well-established tumor repressor, as intraoocyte target of CRL4 DCAF13 ubiquitin E3 ligase. These physiological as well as biochemical findings extend the current understanding of oocyte development regulation. The same mechanism may also potentially crucial in some other developmental processes and cancer development.
