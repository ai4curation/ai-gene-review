Two distinct mechanisms, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis implement the formation 
of the vascular network in the embryo. Vasculogenesis gives rise to the heart 
and the first primitive vascular plexus inside the embryo and in its surrounding 
membranes, as the yolk sac circulation. Angiogenesis is responsible for the 
remodeling and expansion of this network. While vasculogenesis refers to in situ 
differentiation and growth of blood vessels from mesodermal derived 
hemangioblasts, angiogenesis comprises two different mechanisms: endothelial 
sprouting and intussusceptive microvascular growth (IMG). The sprouting process 
is based on endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation. IMG 
divides existing vessel lumens by formation and insertion of tissue folds and 
columns of interstitial tissue into the vessel lumen. The latter are termed 
interstitial or intervascular tissue structures (ITSs) and tissue pillars or 
posts. Intussusception also includes the establishment of new vessels by in situ 
loop formation in the wall of large veins. The molecular regulation of these 
distinct mechanisms is discussed in respect to the most important positive 
regulators, VEGF and its receptors flk-1 (KDR) and flt-1, the Angiopoietin/tie 
system and the ephrin-B/EpH-B system. The cellular mechanisms and the molecular 
regulation of angiogenesis in the pathological state are summarized and the 
differences of physiological and pathological angiogenesis elaborated.
