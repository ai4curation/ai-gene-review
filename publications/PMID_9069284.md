X-chromosome inactivation is the process by which female mammals (with two X 
chromosomes) achieve expression of X-chromosomal genes equivalent to that of 
males (one X and one Y chromosome). This results in the transcriptional 
silencing of virtually all genes on one of the X chromosomes in female somatic 
cells. X-chromosome inactivation has been shown to act in cis and to initiate 
and spread from a single site on the X chromosome known as the X-inactivation 
centre (Xic). The Xic has been localized to a 450-kilobase region of the mouse X 
chromosome. The Xist gene also maps to this region and is expressed exclusively 
from the inactive X chromosome. Xist is unusual in that it appears not to code 
for a protein but produces a nuclear RNA which colocalizes with the inactive X 
chromosome. The creation of a null allele of Xist in embryonic stem cells has 
demonstrated that this gene is required for X inactivation to occur in cis. Here 
we show that Xist, introduced onto an autosome, is sufficient by itself for 
inactivation in cis and that Xist RNA becomes localized close to the autosome 
into which the gene is integrated. In addition, the presence of autosomal Xist 
copies leads to activation of the endogeneous Xist gene in some cells, 
suggesting that elements required for some aspects of chromosome counting are 
contained within the construct. Thus the Xist gene exhibits properties of the 
X-inactivation centre.
