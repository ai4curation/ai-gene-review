A human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binding protein from serum of cancer 
patients was purified to homogeneity and partially sequenced. Synthetic DNA 
probes based on amino acid sequence information were used to isolate cDNA clones 
encoding a receptor for TNF. The TNF receptor (TNF-R) is a 415 amino acid 
polypeptide with a single membrane-spanning region. The extracellular 
cysteine-rich domain of the TNF-R is homologous to the nerve growth factor 
receptor and the B cell activation protein Bp50. Human embryonic kidney cells 
transfected with a TNF-R expression vector specifically bind both 125I-labeled 
and biotinylated TNF-alpha. Unlabeled TNF-alpha and TNF-beta were equally 
effective at displacing the binding of labeled TNF-alpha to TNF-R expressing 
cells. Northern analysis indicates a single species of mRNA for the TNF-R in a 
variety of cell types. Therefore, the soluble TNF binding protein found in human 
serum is probably proteolytically derived from the TNF-R.
