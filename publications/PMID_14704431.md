To initiate studies on how protein-protein interaction (or "interactome") 
networks relate to multicellular functions, we have mapped a large fraction of 
the Caenorhabditis elegans interactome network. Starting with a subset of 
metazoan-specific proteins, more than 4000 interactions were identified from 
high-throughput, yeast two-hybrid (HT=Y2H) screens. Independent coaffinity 
purification assays experimentally validated the overall quality of this Y2H 
data set. Together with already described Y2H interactions and interologs 
predicted in silico, the current version of the Worm Interactome (WI5) map 
contains approximately 5500 interactions. Topological and biological features of 
this interactome network, as well as its integration with phenome and 
transcriptome data sets, lead to numerous biological hypotheses.
