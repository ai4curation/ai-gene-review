The organization of a cell emerges from the interactions in protein networks. 
The interactome is critically dependent on the strengths of interactions and the 
cellular abundances of the connected proteins, both of which span orders of 
magnitude. However, these aspects have not yet been analyzed globally. Here, we 
have generated a library of HeLa cell lines expressing 1,125 GFP-tagged proteins 
under near-endogenous control, which we used as input for a next-generation 
interaction survey. Using quantitative proteomics, we detect specific 
interactions, estimate interaction stoichiometries, and measure cellular 
abundances of interacting proteins. These three quantitative dimensions reveal 
that the protein network is dominated by weak, substoichiometric interactions 
that play a pivotal role in defining network topology. The minority of stable 
complexes can be identified by their unique stoichiometry signature. This study 
provides a rich interaction dataset connecting thousands of proteins and 
introduces a framework for quantitative network analysis.
