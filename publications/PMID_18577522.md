The gaseous hormone ethylene is perceived in Arabidopsis by a five member 
receptor family that consists of the subfamily 1 receptors ETR1 and ERS1 and the 
subfamily 2 receptors ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4. Previous work has demonstrated that 
the basic functional unit for the ethylene receptor, ETR1, is a disulfide-linked 
homodimer. We demonstrate here that ethylene receptors isolated from Arabidopsis 
also interact with each other through noncovalent interactions. Evidence that 
ETR1 associates with other ethylene receptors was obtained by co-purification of 
ETR1 with tagged versions of ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 from Arabidopsis 
membrane extracts. ETR1 preferentially associated with the subfamily 2 receptors 
compared with the subfamily 1 receptor ERS1, but ethylene treatment affected the 
interactions and relative composition of the receptor complexes. When 
transgenically expressed in yeast, ETR1 and ERS2 can form disulfide-linked 
heterodimers. In plant extracts, however, the association of ETR1 and ERS2 can 
be largely disrupted by treatment with SDS, supporting a higher order 
noncovalent interaction between the receptors. Yeast two-hybrid analysis 
demonstrated that the receptor GAF domains are capable of mediating heteromeric 
receptor interactions. Kinetic analysis of ethylene-insensitive mutants of ETR1 
is consistent with their dominance being due in part to an ability to associate 
with other ethylene receptors. These data suggest that the ethylene receptors 
exist in plants as clusters in a manner potentially analogous to that found with 
the histidine kinase-linked chemoreceptors of bacteria and that interactions 
among receptors contribute to ethylene signal output.

Abstract

The gaseous hormone ethylene is perceived in Arabidopsis by a five
 member receptor family that consists of the subfamily 1 receptors ETR1 and
 ERS1 and the subfamily 2 receptors ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4. Previous work has
 demonstrated that the basic functional unit for the ethylene receptor, ETR1,
 is a disulfide-linked homodimer. We demonstrate here that ethylene receptors
 isolated from Arabidopsis also interact with each other through
 noncovalent interactions. Evidence that ETR1 associates with other ethylene
 receptors was obtained by co-purification of ETR1 with tagged versions of
 ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 from Arabidopsis membrane extracts. ETR1
 preferentially associated with the subfamily 2 receptors compared with the
 subfamily 1 receptor ERS1, but ethylene treatment affected the interactions
 and relative composition of the receptor complexes. When transgenically
 expressed in yeast, ETR1 and ERS2 can form disulfide-linked heterodimers. In
 plant extracts, however, the association of ETR1 and ERS2 can be largely
 disrupted by treatment with SDS, supporting a higher order noncovalent
 interaction between the receptors. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that
 the receptor GAF domains are capable of mediating heteromeric receptor
 interactions. Kinetic analysis of ethylene-insensitive mutants of ETR1 is
 consistent with their dominance being due in part to an ability to associate
 with other ethylene receptors. These data suggest that the ethylene receptors
 exist in plants as clusters in a manner potentially analogous to that found
 with the histidine kinase-linked chemoreceptors of bacteria and that
 interactions among receptors contribute to ethylene signal output.

RESULTS

TAP-tagged Ethylene Receptors Are Functional —To characterize
 ethylene receptors from Arabidopsis at the protein level, a TAP tag
 ( 31 ) was fused to the C
 terminus of the ethylene receptors ETR2, ERS2, EIN4, and ERS1. The native
 promoter and genomic sequence of each ethylene receptor gene were used for the
 constructs to allow for normal levels and patterns of expression. The ethylene
 receptor constructs were transformed into corresponding single
 loss-of-function mutant backgrounds to use for biochemical analysis. In
 addition, the ETR2-TAP construct was transformed into an etr1/etr2/ein4 triple mutant
 ( 19 ), and the ERS2-TAP and
 EIN4-TAP constructs were each transformed into an etr2/ers2/ein4 triple mutant ( 29 ), to
 determine whether TAP-tagged ethylene receptors were functional. The
 TAP-tagged ethylene receptors rescued the constitutive ethylene-response
 phenotype of the triple mutants ( Fig.
 1 A ), indicating that the TAP tag does not disrupt
 receptor function. Consistent with rescue, the TAP-tagged ethylene receptors
 were detectable by immunoblot in membranes isolated from the transgenic plants
 ( Fig. 1 B ).

ETR1 Co-purifies with Other TAP-tagged Ethylene Receptors from
 Arabidopsis —The transgenic plants that expressed TAP-tagged
 ethylene receptors in their corresponding single loss-of-function mutant
 backgrounds were used to determine if ETR1 interacted with the other ethylene
 receptors in Arabidopsis . The TAP-tagged ethylene receptors were
 purified by incubating lysophosphatidylcholine-solubilized membrane proteins
 with human IgG beads. The IgG beads bind the protein-A portion of the TAP tag,
 resulting in affinity purification of the TAP-tagged ethylene receptors. An
 anti-ETR1 antibody was then used to determine if ETR1 co-purified with the
 TAP-tagged ethylene receptors.

The pull-down experiments demonstrated that ETR1 co-purified with
 TAP-tagged ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 ( Fig.
 2 ). Controls confirmed that IgG beads did not pull-down ETR1 from
 the wild-type control, nor did IgG beads pull-down BiP, a resident protein of
 the plant endoplasmic reticulum
 ( 36 ), indicating that the
 co-purification of ETR1 was mediated by the TAP-tagged ethylene receptors. By
 comparing the enrichment factor of the TAP-tagged receptor to the enrichment
 factor of ETR1 by IgG beads, we estimated that ∼25% of the total amount of
 ETR1 co-purified with ETR2 or ERS2, and ∼3% of the total amount of ETR1
 co-purified with ERS1 or EIN4 ( Fig.
 2 A ).

Expression of the TAP-tagged receptors varied, resulting in differing
 yields following pull-down with IgG beads
 ( Fig. 2 A ). Therefore,
 we also ran gels of the same purified fractions, loading these so as to have
 equivalent intensity of the TAP-tagged receptors
 ( Fig. 2 B ). The amount
 of ETR1 co-purified with the TAP-tagged ethylene receptors was then compared
 to determine the efficiency of co-purification. Based on this analysis, the
 subfamily 2 ethylene receptors ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 have similar efficiency
 for co-purification of ETR1, whereas the subfamily 1 member ERS1 has a lower
 efficiency for co-purification of ETR1.

Effect of Ethylene upon ETR1 Interactions with TAP-tagged Ethylene
 Receptors —To determine whether ethylene affects the interactions
 between ETR1 and the other ethylene receptors, we used etiolated seedlings,
 because they show a pronounced response to ethylene treatment. Interactions
 were examined with ERS1-TAP, ETR2-TAP, and ERS2-TAP, each of which is induced
 at the transcriptional level by ethylene
 ( 37 ). Aminoethoxyvinylglycine,
 an inhibitor of ACC synthase, was included in the growth medium to block
 endogenous production of ethylene
 ( 38 ).

Protein levels of ERS1-TAP, ETR2-TAP, and ERS2-TAP all increased following
 4-h treatment with 10 μl/liter ethylene
 ( Fig. 3 ), consistent with their
 transcriptional regulation by ethylene. The pull-downs revealed differing
 levels of ETR1 interactions with the TAP-tagged receptors. In the absence of
 ethylene, we estimated that ∼16% of the total amount of ETR1 co-purified
 with ETR2, 43% with ERS2, and 11% with ERS1. Following ethylene treatment, the
 total amount of ETR1 associated with ETR2-TAP increased at a level coincident
 with the increase in ETR2-TAP levels ( Fig.
 3, A and C ). The total amount of ETR1 associated
 with ERS1-TAP also showed a small increase following the short-term ethylene
 treatment ( Fig. 3, A and C ). Longer-term ethylene treatment of the ERS1-TAP line
 resulted in a total level of ETR1 association with ERS1-TAP coincident with
 the increase in ERS1-TAP levels ( Fig. 3, B and C ). In contrast to the effect of ethylene
 upon ETR1 association with ETR2 and ERS1, decreased levels of ETR1 were found
 associated with ERS2 following ethylene treatment
 ( Fig. 3, A and C ). These results indicate that receptor complexes exist
 in both the absence and presence of ethylene, but the kinetics of formation
 and relative composition for the receptor complexes may vary following
 ethylene treatment.

Formation of Heterodimers by ETR1 and ERS2 When Transgenically
 Expressed in Yeast —Previous data indicate that ETR1 exists as a
 disulfide-linked dimer, and that Cys-4 and Cys-6 are the sites that
 participate in formation of disulfide bonds in the homodimer
 ( 15 ). The Cys-4 and Cys-6
 residues are conserved in all ethylene receptors, and the N termini of the
 five receptors have high amino acid identity. Evidence indicates that ethylene
 receptors can form homodimers in plants
 ( 15 , 39 ), but the presence of
 heterodimers between ethylene receptors has not been demonstrated.

To determine whether ETR1 can interact with other ethylene receptors as a
 disulfide-linked heterodimer, we used a transgenic yeast system for receptor
 expression. We co-transformed yeast with a full-length tagged version of ETR1
 (ETR1-TAP) and a truncated tagged version of ERS2 (ERS2-(1–356)-GST).
 ERS2-(1–356) contains just the transmembrane domains and the GAF domain
 of ERS2, and thus has a significantly different molecular mass from
 full-length ETR1. Thus, it should be possible to resolve the disulfide-linked
 heterodimer of ETR1-ERS2 from the ETR1 homodimer and the ERS2 homodimer by
 nonreducing SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.

Expression of ETR1-TAP and ERS2-(1–356)-GST was induced with
 galactose. Both ETR1-TAP and ERS2-(1–356)-GST can be detected by
 immunoblot when using the anti-GST monoclonal antibody, because of a weak
 interaction between the TAP tag and the mouse and goat IgGs
 ( Fig. 4 ). In the presence of
 reducing reagent, ERS2-(1–356)-GST migrated at 65 kDa, consistent with
 its predicted molecular mass of 65 kDa, and ETR1-TAP migrated at 110 kDa,
 consistent with its predicted molecular mass of 102 kDa. In the absence of
 reducing reagent, both ERS2-(1–356)-GST and ETR1-TAP were found to form
 homodimers when expressed individually. The homodimer of
 ERS2-(1–356)-GST migrated at 140 kDa, consistent with its predicted
 molecular mass of 130 KDa, and the homodimer of ETR1-TAP migrated at 210 kDa,
 consistent with its predicted molecular mass of 204 kDa. When the two proteins
 were co-expressed in yeast, a new band at a size of 180 kDa was detected
 between the homodimer bands of ETR1-TAP and ERS2-(1–356)-GST, consistent
 with a predicted heterodimer molecular mass of 167 kDa
 ( Fig. 4 ). Interestingly, the
 truncated ERS2 protein preferentially formed the ERS2-ETR1 heterodimer rather
 than the ERS2 homodimer. This may relate to a natural propensity for ERS2 to
 interact with subfamily 1 receptors. Alternatively it may be an indirect
 effect of the truncated ERS2 lacking its histidine kinase domain, as this
 domain may facilitate dimerization.

To exclude the possibility that GST mediates the heterodimer formation
 between ETR1-TAP and ERS2-(1–356)-GST, we co-expressed GST and ETR1-TAP
 in yeast. Results indicate that GST does not form a disulfide-linked
 heterodimer with ETR1-TAP (data not shown). Because the TAP tag does not
 contain cysteine, the possibility of it forming a disulfide-linked heterodimer
 with ERS2-(1–356) is excluded. The formation of a heterodimer between
 ETR1 and ERS2 in yeast supports the possibility that such heterodimer
 interactions could occur between ETR1 and the other ethylene receptors of Arabidopsis .

Higher Order Interaction of ETR1 with ERS2 in
 Arabidopsis —Because ETR1 co-purifies with ERS2-TAP from Arabidopsis , we considered two possibilities by which ETR1 could
 interact with ERS2-TAP. First, ETR1 and ERS2-TAP could form disulfide-linked
 heterodimers. This possibility is supported by our finding that ETR1 and ERS2
 can form heterodimers in yeast ( Fig.
 4 ). According to this hypothesis, the interaction of ETR1 with
 ERS2-TAP would not be disrupted by treatment with SDS, which would be unable
 to break the covalent disulfide bond. Second, an ETR1 homodimer could interact
 with an ERS2-TAP homodimer through noncovalent interactions. Such an
 interaction would represent a higher order interaction and, being noncovalent,
 should be capable of being destroyed by denaturing treatment with SDS.

To determine whether ETR1 interacts with ERS2 by forming heterodimers or
 through higher order interactions in Arabidopsis , IgG-bound ERS2-TAP
 along with its associated ETR1 were eluted with 1% (w/v) SDS. SDS treatment
 can disrupt most protein-protein interactions maintained by noncovalent
 interactions, and thus the ETR1-ERS2 interaction will be disrupted if it is
 maintained by higher order interactions. The eluted solution was then diluted
 10-fold to reduce the SDS concentration to 0.1% and brought to 0.25% (w/v)
 LPC, thus allowing IgG beads to pull-down ERS2-TAP again. ETR1 was then
 examined on the IgG beads to determine whether ETR1 still co-purified with
 ERS2-TAP after the SDS treatment.

Two independent replicates of the experiment indicate that the 1% SDS
 treatment reduced the co-purification of ETR1 with ERS2-TAP by ∼80%
 ( Fig. 5 ), demonstrating that
 the interaction of ETR1 and ERS2-TAP in Arabidopsis is maintained by
 higher order interactions. The fact that a small amount of ETR1 still
 co-purified with ERS2-TAP after the SDS treatment indicates that ETR1-ERS2
 heterodimers may also exist in Arabidopsis ( Fig. 5 ). To test this
 hypothesis, ERS2-TAP and ETR1 bound by IgG beads were eluted with 1% SDS and
 10 m m DTT, thereby allowing for the disruption of disulfide-linked
 heterodimers and higher order interactions. This treatment almost completely
 abolished the co-purification of ETR1 with ERS2-TAP
 ( Fig. 5 ).

The GAF Domain Facilitates Physical Interactions between
 Receptors —We performed yeast two-hybrid analysis to determine which
 regions of the receptors were capable of mediating heteromeric interactions,
 examining interactions between the subfamily 1 receptor ETR1 and the subfamily
 2 receptor ETR2 ( Fig. 6 ).
 Constructs containing the entire soluble domains but lacking the N-terminal
 transmembrane domains were tested and determined to interact based on two
 different reporters (HIS3+ and LacZ). Similar results were also obtained when
 we examined interaction between the soluble domains of ETR1 and ERS2 (data not
 shown). The soluble region of greatest sequence similarity between the
 subfamily 1 and 2 receptors is the GAF domain. GAF domains have been shown to
 mediate cGMP binding and light regulation in some proteins, but their function
 in the ethylene receptors is unknown
 ( 40 ). We found through the
 examination of additional truncated versions of the ETR1 and ETR2 receptors
 that the GAF domain was sufficient to mediate their interaction, although
 based on the LacZ reporter analysis the strength of this interaction was
 reduced compared with that observed with the entire soluble domains
 ( Fig. 6 ).

Kinetic Analysis of the Truncated etr1-1-(1–349)
 Receptor — etr1-1 is a dominant gain-of-function mutation
 that results in a C65Y amino acid change in the receptor such that the mutant
 receptor no longer binds ethylene
 ( 6 , 7 ). This results in a
 gain-of-function because the etr1-1 receptor appears locked into a functional
 conformation that constitutively activates CTR1 to suppress ethylene
 responses. Surprisingly, a truncated version of the mutant receptor,
 etr1-1-(1–349), which lacks its signal output domain still confers on
 plants a partial ethylene-insensitive phenotype when introduced into the etr1-7 genetic background that lacks ETR1
 ( 30 , 41 ). This dominance could
 arise because of an ability of etr1-1-(1–349) to interact with and
 convert other receptors to an ethylene-insensitive conformation. Consistent
 with this possibility, etr1-1-(1–349) contains the GAF domain, which we
 found sufficient for facilitating physical interaction with other members of
 the ethylene receptor family ( Fig.
 6 ).

If etr1-1-(1–349) requires additional ethylene receptors to confer
 ethylene insensitivity, then its effectiveness may vary in a manner dependent
 upon the expression levels of the other receptors. We therefore examined the
 effectiveness of etr1-1-(1–349) compared with etr1-1 by kinetic analysis
 following treatment of seedlings with ethylene, making use of transgenic lines
 in which the truncated and full-length versions of etr1-1 are expressed at
 similar levels ( 30 ). Unlike
 ETR1, which is constitutively expressed, three members of the ethylene
 receptor family (ERS1, ETR2, and ERS2) are induced by ethylene treatment in
 wild-type seedlings ( 11 , 37 ). The total level of ETR1
 associated with ETR2-TAP and ERS1-TAP increases following ethylene treatment
 ( Fig. 3 ) and thus, if
 etr1-1-(1–349) requires interaction with ETR2 and ERS1 to confer
 ethylene insensitivity, it should be more effective following ethylene
 treatment of seedlings.

The genetic background used ( etr1-7 ) shows a kinetic response to
 10 μl/liter exogenous ethylene similar to that found in wild-type
 seedlings, displaying a rapid decrease in the hypocotyl growth rate that
 stabilizes at a new steady-state growth rate by 2 h following the initial
 ethylene application ( Fig.
 7 A ) ( 11 ).
 A transgenic etr1-7 line containing a full-length version of the
 etr1-1 receptor displays no change in its growth rate upon ethylene treatment,
 thereby demonstrating the ethylene insensitivity conferred on the seedlings by
 introduction of this mutant receptor ( Fig.
 7 A ). Because the mutant etr1-1 receptor is full-length,
 it contains its own signal output domain to suppress ethylene responses and so
 should not be dependent upon other ethylene receptors to exert its effect. The
 truncated etr1-1-(1–349) transgenic line initially behaves similarly to
 the background etr1-7 line in response to ethylene, showing a rapid
 decrease in hypocotyl growth rate that closely matches that of etr1-7 ( Fig. 7 A ). But rather
 than plateauing at a new steady state growth rate, the growth rate starts to
 increase again at ∼2 h after ethylene treatment, reaching a new growth
 rate intermediate between that of the etr1-7 background and the
 transgenic line containing full-length etr1-1. An etr1-7 line
 containing the truncated wild-type receptor construct ETR1-(1–349)
 showed a kinetic response similar to that of etr1-7 (data not shown),
 demonstrating that the altered kinetic response of etr1-1-(1–349) is not
 due simply to the introduction of a truncated receptor but that it also
 requires the C65Y ( etr1-1 ) mutation. Analysis by real-time PCR
 confirmed that the transcriptionally regulated ethylene receptor genes ERS1 (subfamily 1), as well as ETR2 and ERS2 (subfamily 2) were induced by 4-h ethylene treatment in etr1-7 and
 the etr1-1-(1–349) transgenic line, but were not induced in the
 transgenic line containing full-length etr1-1
 ( Fig. 7 B ). The change
 in receptor transcript levels following ethylene treatment is reflected at the
 protein level based on immunoblot analysis using an anti-ETR2 antibody
 ( Fig. 7 C ).

DISCUSSION

Protein-protein interactions are important for signaling by ethylene
 receptors. Both genetic and biochemical evidence indicate that ethylene
 receptors interact with CTR1 to mediate ethylene signal transduction
 ( 21 – 23 ).
 According to the current model, when plants grow in air (absence of ethylene),
 the kinase domain of CTR1 actively represses ethylene responses. In the
 presence of ethylene, binding of ethylene to the receptors leads to a
 conformational change in CTR1 that inactivates its kinase domain, thereby
 relieving the suppression of ethylene responses. The physical association of
 the ethylene receptors with CTR1 is essential for its regulation as a mutation
 that abolishes this interaction results in a constitutive ethylene response
 ( 21 , 23 ).

Co-purification of ETR1 with other TAP-tagged ethylene receptors
 demonstrates that receptor-receptor interactions also occur in Arabidopsis . Our results suggest that 60–70% of ETR1 is
 physically associated with other receptors. This number cannot be considered
 an exact representation of the levels of receptor-receptor interactions for
 several reasons. First, the amount of ETR1 found associated with the
 TAP-tagged receptors is likely to be dependent upon the transgenic expression
 level of these receptors. Although we expressed the transgenes from their
 native promoters, we previously observed variability in levels of
 transgenically expressed ETR1 protein when compared with the native protein
 expression level ( 9 ). Second,
 our analysis of receptor interactions required solubilization of the receptors
 from membranes, a process that may disrupt protein-protein interactions and
 thus result in an underestimation of the actual association levels. Third, our
 analysis of ethylene effects on receptor associations suggests dynamic changes
 in the composition of receptor-receptor complexes. Nevertheless our data on
 ETR1 associations with other receptors, along with the finding that ERS2-Myc
 can co-purify with ERS1-TAP and
 EIN4-TAP, 4 suggest a
 substantial level of interaction between the ethylene receptors.

The interaction between ETR1 and ERS2-TAP isolated from plants was
 disrupted by SDS treatment, indicating that the interaction between ethylene
 receptors is a noncovalent higher order interaction, and that the ethylene
 receptors may thus exist as multimeric clusters. The capacity for receptors to
 form covalent disulfide-linked heterodimers was supported by use of a
 transgenic yeast system, but such heterodimers do not appear common in plants
 based on our analysis here, as well as prior analysis of ETR1 truncations in
 plants in which we only found clear evidence for disulfide-linked homodimers
 ( 30 ). The formation of the
 disufide-linked heterodimers in yeast could represent an artifact arising from
 the high levels of receptor expression and points to the necessity of
 analyzing such receptor interactions under native expression conditions. Our
 data are consistent with the recent report that Arabidopsis ethylene
 receptors can form homomeric and heteromeric associations with each other at
 the ER in transiently transformed tobacco leaf cells
 ( 42 ), and extend this analysis
 to indicate that in planta such interactions are predominantly higher
 order.

Ethylene receptors contain several domains that may play roles in
 maintaining receptor-receptor interactions. We demonstrate here that the GAF
 domains of the receptors can physically interact. GAF domains are widespread
 in nature and, although best known for their capacity to bind a diversity of
 small molecules, have also been found to mediate the dimerization of
 phosphodiesterase 2A ( 40 , 43 ). All the ethylene
 receptors also contain histidine-kinase-like domains, and bacterial
 histidine-kinase domains have been found to dimerize through coiled-coil
 interactions ( 44 ). In
 addition, three of the receptors (ETR1, ETR2, EIN4) contain receiver domains
 and the crystal structure of the ETR1 receiver domain reveals it to form a
 dimer ( 45 ). Whether these
 interactions are responsible for the formation of homodimers or higher order
 interactions is currently unknown and it is possible that the same domain
 could function for both purposes. In addition, the analysis of domain-domain
 interactions of the ethylene receptors has to date relied upon bacterial and
 yeast overexpression systems, and it remains to be determined how well these
 represent the associations found in the plant.

Higher order interactions between ethylene receptors suggest a mechanism as
 to how Arabidopsis can display such a high sensitivity for ethylene.
 When transgenically expressed in yeast, ETR1 binds ethylene with a K d of 2.4 n m ( 6 ). The other ethylene
 receptors appear to bind ethylene with similar affinity to ETR1
 ( 46 ). Interestingly, Arabidopsis responds to ethylene levels as low as 0.2 nl/liter (0.09
 n m ), which is 300-fold lower than the K d value
 ( 2 ). The higher order
 interaction between ethylene receptors would allow for the ethylene signal to
 be amplified by lateral receptor interactions. By transmitting the
 ligand-bound conformation to proximate ligand-free receptors, one ethylene
 molecule can modulate signaling by several ethylene receptors. This signal
 amplification mechanism has been demonstrated in bacterial chemotaxis
 signaling. The bacterial chemoreceptors form higher order clusters through
 direct physical interactions, and respond to ligand binding in a coordinated
 way ( 25 ). Such cooperative
 behavior can be considered in terms of a model in which the receptor cluster
 exists in equilibrium between T (tense) and R (relaxed) states, with ligand
 binding to a subset of receptors shifting the equilibrium of the entire
 cluster toward the R state.

The interactions between ethylene receptors may fine tune the signal output
 from the receptors. Although all receptors appear to have similar ethylene
 binding abilities, several lines of evidence indicate that different receptors
 may have different signal output abilities. First, their C-terminal signal
 output domains are different. Second, subfamily 1 ethylene receptors of Arabidopsis have a greater level of signal output ability than
 subfamily 2 receptors ( 28 , 29 , 47 ), potentially due to
 differing affinities for the Raf-like kinase CTR1. Thus, interactions between
 different receptors would provide multiple signal output combinations that
 allow plants to alter the degree to which they respond to ethylene
 binding.

Interactions between receptors can also explain the dominance exhibited by
 ethylene-insensitive mutations in the receptors such as the etr1-1 mutation ( 17 ). The etr1-1
 mutant receptor appears locked into a functional conformation that
 constitutively activates CTR1 to suppress ethylene responses, conferring an
 ethylene-insensitive phenotype. etr1-1 is a dominant mutation,
 suggesting the etr1-1 receptor produces sufficient signal output to suppress
 ethylene responses. However, the native ETR1 does not appear able to produce
 enough signal output to suppress ethylene responses by itself, based on the
 finding that a triple receptor knock-out mutant ( etr2/ers2/ein4 ) that
 only has ETR1 and ERS1 shows a constitutive ethylene response phenotype
 ( 19 ). The higher order
 interaction model can explain the effectiveness of the etr1-1 receptor in
 suppressing the ethylene responses. According to this model, etr1-1 is locked
 in its signal output conformation and is unresponsive to ethylene binding by
 neighboring receptors. The dominant etr1-1 receptor may instead amplify its
 signal output by conferring upon other receptors a similar conformation
 ( i.e. shift equilibrium of the receptor cluster toward the T-state).
 Our kinetic analysis of etr1-1-(1–349 ) seedlings is consistent
 with this model, as the mutant line became progressively less sensitive to
 ethylene following an ethylene treatment that induced transcription of
 additional receptors. Also consistent with this model is the previous finding
 that etr1-1-(1–349 ) is less effective at conferring ethylene
 insensitivity in genetic backgrounds null for other members of the receptor
 family, in particular subfamily 1 receptors such as ERS1 ( 41 ). The etr1-1-(1–349)
 receptor, although lacking histidine kinase and receiver domains, could be
 capable of interacting with other receptors by its GAF domain, which we show
 here is sufficient for mediating receptor-receptor interactions. This result
 suggests that direct GAF-GAF interactions may be important for mediating
 signaling between receptors.

Previous genetic analyses indicate that synergistic interactions exist
 between subfamily 1 receptors and subfamily 2 receptors. A double
 loss-of-function mutant ( etr1/ers1 ) which lacks subfamily 1 ethylene
 receptors shows a severe constitutive ethylene response phenotype, and
 transforming genes of subfamily 2 receptors cannot rescue the phenotype
 ( 28 , 29 , 47 ). These data suggest that
 subfamily 1 receptors are absolutely needed to suppress ethylene responses in Arabidopsis , and their functions cannot be replaced by subfamily 2
 receptors. However, a triple knock-out mutant etr2/ers2/ein4 that
 lacks the subfamily 2 receptors also shows a constitutive ethylene response
 phenotype ( 19 , 29 ), indicating that subfamily
 1 receptors are unable to efficiently suppress ethylene signal transduction by
 themselves. These two genetic observations suggest that subfamily 1 members
 and subfamily 2 members may function synergistically to suppress ethylene
 responses. In wild-type plants, subfamily 2 receptors may recruit CTR1
 ( 23 ), but subfamily 1
 receptors may help subfamily 2 receptors activate their associated CTR1 by
 receptor-receptor interactions, thus allowing enough signal output to suppress
 ethylene responses.

The finding that the subfamily 1 receptor ETR1 interacts with subfamily 2
 receptors suggests that signal transduction between ethylene receptors of
 subfamilies 1 and 2 may occur in part through a two-component phosphorelay.
 Several reports indicate that such a phosphorelay, although not required for
 signaling, may modulate the ethylene response
 ( 11 , 12 , 28 , 48 ). A significant difference
 between subfamily 1 and subfamily 2 members is that subfamily 1 receptors have
 a functional histidine kinase domain, whereas subfamily 2 receptors have
 Ser/Thr kinase activity ( 4 , 14 ). The histidine kinase
 domain is a classic component in a two-component signal transduction system
 ( 49 ). In this system, signals
 are mediated through a His-Asp phosphorelay between proteins containing a
 histidine kinase domain and proteins containing a receiver domain in which a
 conserved Asp amino acid can be phosphorylated by the His-Asp phosphorelay. In Arabidopsis , the subfamily 1 receptors ETR1 and ERS1 each have
 functional histidine kinase domains, and ETR1, ETR2, and EIN4 each have
 receiver domains. Upon autophosphorylation on histidine, the subfamily 1
 receptors may transfer the phosphate to the aspartate within the receiver
 domains of the subfamily 2 receptors ETR2 and EIN4, both of which we found
 capable of interacting with ETR1.
