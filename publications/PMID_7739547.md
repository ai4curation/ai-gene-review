Cyclin D-dependent kinases act as mitogen-responsive, rate-limiting controllers 
of G1 phase progression in mammalian cells. Two novel members of the mouse INK4 
gene family, p19 and p18, that specifically inhibit the kinase activities of 
CDK4 and CDK6, but do not affect those of cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin A-CDK2, or 
cyclin B-CDC2, were isolated. Like the previously described human INK4 
polypeptides, p16INK4a/MTS1 and p15INK4b/MTS2, mouse p19 and p18 are primarily 
composed of tandemly repeated ankyrin motifs, each ca. 32 amino acids in length, 
p19 and p18 bind directly to CDK4 and CDK6, whether untethered or in complexes 
with D cyclins, and can inhibit the activity of cyclin D-bound cyclin-dependent 
kinases (CDKs). Although neither protein interacts with D cyclins or displaces 
them from preassembled cyclin D-CDK complexes in vitro, both form complexes with 
CDKs at the expense of cyclins in vivo, suggesting that they may also interfere 
with cyclin-CDK assembly. In proliferating macrophages, p19 mRNA and protein are 
periodically expressed with a nadir in G1 phase and maximal synthesis during S 
phase, consistent with the possibility that INK4 proteins limit the activities 
of CDKs once cells exit G1 phase. However, introduction of a vector encoding p19 
into mouse NIH 3T3 cells leads to constitutive p19 synthesis, inhibits cyclin 
D1-CDK4 activity in vivo, and induces G1 phase arrest.
