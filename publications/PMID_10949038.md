The coupling of apoptosis (programmed cell death) to the cell division cycle is 
essential for homeostasis and genomic integrity. Here, we report the crystal 
structure of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, which has been implicated in 
both control of cell death and regulation of cell division. In addition to a 
conserved N-terminal Zn finger baculovirus IAP repeat, survivin forms a dimer 
through a symmetric interaction with an intermolecularly bound Zn atom located 
along the molecular dyad axis. The interaction of the dimer-related C-terminal 
alpha helices forms an extended surface of approximately 70 A in length. 
Mutagenesis analysis revealed that survivin dimerization and an extended 
negatively charged surface surrounding Asp-71 are required to counteract 
apoptosis and preserve ploidy. These findings may provide a structural basis for 
a dual role of survivin in inhibition of apoptosis and regulation of cell 
division.
