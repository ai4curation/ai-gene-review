The mammalian neocortex contains two major classes of neurons, projection and 
local circuit neurons. Projection neurons contain the excitatory 
neurotransmitter glutamate, while local circuit neurons are inhibitory, 
containing GABA. The complex function of neocortical circuitry depends on the 
number and diversity of GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric-acid-releasing) local 
circuit neurons. Using retroviral labelling in organotypic slice cultures of the 
embryonic human forebrain, we demonstrate the existence of two distinct lineages 
of neocortical GABAergic neurons. One lineage expresses Dlx1/2 and Mash1 
transcription factors, represents 65% of neocortical GABAergic neurons in 
humans, and originates from Mash1-expressing progenitors of the neocortical 
ventricular and subventricular zone of the dorsal forebrain. The second lineage, 
characterized by the expression of Dlx1/2 but not Mash1, forms around 35% of the 
GABAergic neurons and originates from the ganglionic eminence of the ventral 
forebrain. We suggest that modifications in the expression pattern of 
transcription factors in the forebrain may underlie species-specific programmes 
for the generation of neocortical local circuit neurons and that distinct 
lineages of cortical interneurons may be differentially affected in genetic and 
acquired diseases of the human brain.
