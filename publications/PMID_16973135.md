Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase rho (RPTPrho/PTPRT) is a transmembrane 
protein that is highly expressed in the developing and adult central nervous 
system. It is a member of the RPTP R2B subfamily, which includes PTPkappa, PTPmu 
and PCP-2. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays were used to show 
that RPTPrho interacts with several adherens junctional proteins in brain, 
including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, VE-cadherin (cadherin-5), desmoglein, alpha, 
beta and gamma catenin, p120(ctn) and alpha-actinin. With the exception of 
E-cadherin and alpha-actinin, binding was considerably reduced at high sodium 
concentrations. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation phosphatase assays indicated 
that E-cadherin, and to a far lesser extent p120(ctn), were tyrosine 
dephosphorylated by a recombinant RPTPrho intracellular fragment, and thus, were 
likely to be primary substrates for RPTPrho. The interaction of RPTPrho with 
adherens junctional components suggests that this phosphatase may transduce 
extracellular signals to the actin cytoskeleton and thereby play a role in 
regulating cadherin-mediated cell adhesion in the central nervous system.
