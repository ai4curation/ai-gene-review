The product of the Escherichia coli secB gene is required for efficient export 
of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. The studies described in this 
report show that in wild-type growing cells, SecB protein associates with 
precursor forms of exported proteins, such as the periplasmic maltose-binding 
protein (MBP) and the outer-membrane proteins LamB and OmpA. In contrast, the 
cytoplasmic protein beta-galactosidase was not found in association with SecB. 
Pulse-chase analysis showed that the SecB-precursor MBP complex was short lived, 
as expected for a complex that represents an intermediate in the protein-export 
pathway. The results support the hypothesis that SecB protein associates with 
exported protein precursors in the cytoplasm and dissociates prior to or during 
translocation of precursors across the cell membrane.
