The phytochemical resveratrol has recently gained attention for its protection 
against metabolic disease and for extension of life span, which have been linked 
to its metabolic effects and SIRT1 activation in fat cells. However, little is 
known about the effect of resveratrol on fat cell apoptosis. Here, we identify a 
novel, SIRT1-independent mechanism by which resveratrol regulates fat cell 
numbers. We demonstrate for the first time that resveratrol enhances TNF-related 
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)- or CD95-induced apoptosis of human 
preadipocytes in a highly synergistic manner (EC(50) at 72 h: resveratrol, >300 
microM; TRAIL, >100 ng/ml; combination: 30 microM resveratrol and 10 ng/ml 
TRAIL, combination index 0.4). Similar results in primary human preadipocytes 
prepared from subcutaneous white adipose tissue and mature human adipocytes 
underline the relevance to human physiology. Mechanistic studies reveal that 
resveratrol inhibits PI3K-driven phosphorylation of Akt, leading to increased 
Bax activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, 
and caspase-dependent apoptosis. The synergistic interaction of resveratrol and 
TRAIL depends on the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and caspases, since Bcl-2 
overexpression and the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk inhibit apoptosis, whereas 
knockdown of SIRT1 by RNA interference has no effect. The discovery of this 
novel activity of resveratrol significantly advances the knowledge of fat tissue 
regulation by resveratrol and has important implications for its use in 
metabolic and age-related diseases.
