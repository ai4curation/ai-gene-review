In addition to orchestrating the expression of all erythroid-specific genes, 
GATA-1 controls the growth, differentiation, and survival of the erythroid 
lineage through the regulation of genes that manipulate the cell cycle and 
apoptosis. The stages of mammalian erythropoiesis include global gene 
inactivation, nuclear condensation, and enucleation to yield circulating 
erythrocytes, and some of the genes whose expression are altered by GATA-1 
during this process are members of the p53 pathway. In this study, we 
demonstrate a specific in vitro interaction between the transactivation domain 
of p53 (p53TAD) and a segment of the GATA-1 DNA-binding domain that includes the 
carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger domain. We also show by immunoprecipitation that 
the native GATA-1 and p53 interact in erythroid cells and that activation of 
p53-responsive promoters in an erythroid cell line can be inhibited by the 
overexpression of GATA-1. Mutational analysis reveals that GATA-1 inhibition of 
p53 minimally requires the segment of the GATA-1 DNA-binding domain that 
interacts with p53TAD. This inhibition is reciprocal, as the activation of a 
GATA-1-responsive promoter can be inhibited by p53. Based on these findings, we 
conclude that inhibition of the p53 pathway by GATA-1 may be essential for 
erythroid cell development and survival.

The stages of mammalian erythropoiesis include global gene inactivation, nuclear condensation, and enucleation to yield circulating erythrocytes, and some of the genes whose expression are altered by GATA-1 during this process are members of the p53 pathway. In this study, we demonstrate a specific in vitro interaction between the transactivation domain of p53 (p53TAD) and a segment of the GATA-1 DNA-binding domain that includes the carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger domain. We also show by immunoprecipitation that the native GATA-1 and p53 interact in erythroid cells and that activation of p53-responsive promoters in an erythroid cell line can be inhibited by the overexpression of GATA-1. Mutational analysis reveals that GATA-1 inhibition of p53 minimally requires the segment of the GATA-1 DNA-binding domain that interacts with p53TAD. This inhibition is reciprocal, as the activation of a GATA-1–responsive promoter can be inhibited by p53. Based on these findings, we conclude that inhibition of the p53 pathway by GATA-1 may be essential for erythroid cell development and survival.

Introduction

GATA-1 is the founding member of the GATA factor family of DNA-binding proteins, 1 and is critical to the development of the erythroid, 2 , 3 megakaryocyte, 4 mast, 5 and eosinophil 6 cell lineages. It is multifunctional and acts as a global regulator of erythroid-specific genes. 7 It is both an activator and repressor of transcription 8 , 9 and participates in long-range gene regulation through the ß-globin locus control region 10 , 11 and the c- kit locus. 12 GATA-1 alters chromatin structure; it is a substrate for acetylation, 13 , 14 sumolation, 15 and ubiquitination, 16 and recruits the corresponding activities to chromatin.

The GATA-1 DNA-binding domain (DBD) consists of 2 zinc-finger domains (C-X 2 -C-X 17 and C-X 2 -C type) and is highly conserved among the 6 vertebrate GATA factors. The carboxyl-terminal zinc finger (GATA-1 CF) constitutes the primary DBD and is capable of independent high-affinity binding 9 to the consensus motif A/TGATAA/G. 17 The amino-terminal zinc-finger domain (GATA-1 NF) binds independently to a related sequence containing a GATC core with lower affinity, 18 , 19 and stabilizes binding to DNA with multiple GATA sites. 9 , 20 , 21 In addition to their role in DNA binding, both zinc fingers participate in protein-protein interactions 22 , 23 with multiple partners, including friend-of-GATA-1 (FOG-1) 23 and PU.1. 24

GATA-1 is required for generation of erythroid cells, 2 , 3 and GATA-1-negative embryonic stem cells have been used to demonstrate that definitive erythroid cells lacking GATA-1 are blocked at the proerythroblast stage of development. 25 Unlike wild-type cells, GATA-1 null definitive erythroid progenitors die of apoptosis, leading to the conclusion that GATA-1 controls the survival of erythroid cells in addition to contributing to growth and differentiation. GATA-1 stimulates the expression of Bcl-x L , 26 an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that is critical to the erythroid lineage, 27 and Bcl-x L most likely contributes to increased cell survival seen in the presence of GATA-1. This was confirmed in studies with the GATA-1.05 mouse, 28 in which it was shown that 5% of the normal level of GATA-1 is sufficient to stop the apoptosis of day 11 definitive erythroid precursors and to increase the expression of Bcl-x L . 29 The observed apoptosis in the absence of GATA-1 occurs without the accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, through an undetermined mechanism. 25 , 29

The process of terminal erythroid differentiation is one that might induce the p53 pathway because DNA breakage accompanies nuclear condensation and enucleation. p53 is activated by chromosome instability and by DNA damage; however, the p53 pathway remains largely inactive during erythropoiesis even though apoptosis is an integral part of the process. 30 p53 accumulates at low levels during nuclear apoptosis in the normoblast stage of erythropoiesis just before enucleation, but surprisingly, the cells survive. 31 A modified p53 response rather than the classical pathway is observed, concomitant with a reduction of caspase 3/7, the ultimate agent of apoptosis. Recently, erythroid conditional knockouts of the inhibitory p53 partner protein genes murine double minute (Mdm)–2 and Mdm-4 in wild-type and in p53 −/− mice have shown unequivocally that a competent p53 pathway is present and is induced in erythroid cells in the absence of these proteins. 32 Mdm-2 and -4 are clearly involved in preventing the p53 response, but there are most likely other factors because a specialized p53 response is observed (in normoblasts).

The last few cell divisions are critical in erythroid differentiation, because a controlled exit from the cell cycle without induction of apoptosis is essential. GATA-1 regulates cell cycle progression in a concentration- and context-dependent manner, and can both block and accelerate the cell cycle. 33 The restoration of GATA-1 to the GATA-1 null erythroid cell line, G1E, altered the expression of many cell cycle regulators in a manner consistent with the induction of cell cycle arrest 33 ; at least one of these, c- myc , was shown to be directly inhibited by GATA-1. 33 The expression of the p21 gene, which causes cell cycle withdrawal, was stimulated by GATA-1 in a murine erythroleukemia cell line (MEL). 34 p53 also induces cell cycle arrest in part by regulating the same genes. It directly inhibits the transcription of the proliferation-inducing oncogene, c- myc , 35 and activates the p21 gene, a primary component of the p53 response. In other instances, GATA-1 and p53 appear to have opposing functions, as GATA-1 stimulates the antiapoptotic Bcl-x L gene, but p53 induces several proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax 36 and Noxa, 37 and all function in the same intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition, the tumor suppressor RB interacts with both the p53-Mdm-2 complex 38 and GATA-1. 39 Thus, several proteins that are prominent in GATA-1 function are also participants in the p53 pathway. The observation that the p53 transactivation domain (TAD) has similar amino acid composition (high in acidic and hydrophobic residues) to the TAD of PU.1, which interacts with the GATA-1 DBD, resulting in inhibition of GATA-1, 24 caused us to consider that a similar mechanism might explain the interplay between the GATA-1 and p53 pathways.

In this study, we demonstrate a specific interaction between the TAD of p53 (p53TAD) and a segment of GATA-1 that includes the linker between the zinc fingers and the carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger domain (GATA-1 L plus CF). We also show that the native proteins interact and can be coimmunoprecipitated from MEL cell extract. Furthermore, the activation of p53-responsive promoters in an erythroid cell line is inhibited by overexpression of GATA-1, but not by the expression of a GATA-1 mutant that lacks a region required for binding p53. The inhibition is reciprocal, because the activation of a GATA-1–responsive promoter can be inhibited by p53.

Discussion

The observation that GATA-1 interacts strongly with p53 in vitro caused us to consider that GATA-1 directly influences p53 and that there may be interdependency between these 2 regulatory networks in erythroid cells. We have shown that GATA-1 is a potent inhibitor of p53 transactivation in erythroid precursor cells and that this inhibition requires a region of the GATA-1 DBD critical to a high-affinity interaction with the TAD of p53. This inhibition is competed by p53 fragments that bind to GATA-1, but not by ones that do not. Mutants of GATA-1 that do not inhibit p53 transactivation can still bind to DNA and to FOG-1, and transactivate GATA-responsive reporter genes like native GATA-1.

The region of the GATA-1 DBD required for p53 inhibition correlates with the region required for binding to the p53TAD. Residues 228-317 of GATA-1 are sufficient for maximal binding to p53, and significantly lower binding is seen when residues 228-251 from the linker of GATA-1 are deleted ( Figure 2 D). In the transactivation assay, the GATA-1 ΔNF mutant (removal of residues 196-233) still inhibits p53. This mutant removes the cysteine residues of the amino-terminal zinc finger, but retains most of the linker region, including several residues that are part of the helix associated with the amino-terminal zinc finger. In contrast, the GATA-1 ΔNL and ΔNL2 mutants, which contain the amino-terminal zinc-binding domain, but lack either residues 234-254 or residues 236-254 from the linker, do not inhibit p53 activity efficiently. Residues within the linker between the 2 zinc fingers of GATA-1 are critical for both the in vitro binding and the inhibition of p53 transactivation.

All GATA-1 DNA-binding mutants tested to date are defective in the inhibition of p53 transactivation. This is consistent with the requirement for the complete carboxyl-terminal zinc finger of GATA-1 (the major DBD) for p53 binding, and does not necessarily indicate that DNA binding by GATA-1 is required for the inhibition of p53. Our NMR studies indicate that the p53TAD does not disturb the GATA-1/DNA complex in vitro, suggesting that a ternary complex of the 3 molecules does not occur ( Figure 4 ). This is consistent with the fact that the affinity of the GATA-1 DNA interaction is 10-fold higher than that of GATA-1 and p53TAD, and there is overlap between the regions of GATA-1 required for its interaction with DNA and with p53. We do not know if a ternary complex forms at p53 DNA-binding sites, but this is plausible because the p53 DBD is not required for the interaction with GATA-1. It is important to remember that GATA-1 is present at very high concentration in erythroid cells and could either sequester p53 from its targets, or bind to p53 at its targets and inactivate it. Further experiments are required to determine whether GATA-1 and p53 are able to form a ternary complex on a p53 DNA-binding site.

Whereas the inhibition of p53 by GATA-1 has been seen in 2 types of erythroid cells, we have not observed it in nonerythroid cells, and thus, cell-type–specific modifications of either GATA-1 or p53 may be important. Alternately, the cell-type specificity may be the result of a significantly different balance between the concentrations of the 2 proteins in other cell types. Both proteins can be toxic at high concentrations, and it is difficult to express GATA-1 at the normally high levels that occur in red blood cells in nonhematopoietic cells. High levels of GATA-1 may be required to prevent cell death induced by ectopically expressed p53, and this may be unattainable except in an erythroid cell. In this case, the inhibition of p53 by GATA-1 would be an erythroid cell-specific event.

GATA-1 has been linked to leukemias in mice and humans. GATA 1.05 knockdown mice, producing 5% of normal levels of GATA-1, develop erythroleukemia at 3 to 5 months of age and B-cell leukemia at 1 year; 1.05 fetal erythroid cells are unable to differentiate due to lack of GATA-1, but escape the apoptosis seen in GATA-1 null cells and are hyperproliferative. 47 After birth, secondary mutations in this unchecked cell population lead to overt transformation and disease; the inhibition of p53 by GATA-1 observed in this study could facilitate this cell expansion.

In humans, GATA-1 mutations are associated with transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) in Downs Syndrome (DS): both diseases occur frequently in DS patients. 22 TMD and AMKL patients produce GATA-1s, a shorter form of GATA-1 lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain that is translated from an internal ATG: GATA-1s is a critical factor in these diseases. DS TMD is usually a transient disease, but 20% to 30% of cases develop into DS AMKL derived from the original clone of diseased cells with identical mutations in GATA-1. 22 In several experimental systems, substitution of GATA-1s for the native protein has resulted in transient hyperproliferation of fetal megakaryocyte progenitors, but leukemia was not observed consistent with the requirement for trisomy 21. 22 , 47 It is thought that during DS fetal development, mutations producing GATA1s occur at high incidence, leading to expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors to generate TMD. These cells undergo secondary mutation leading to transformation and AMKL. 22 The p53 tumor suppressor pathway is evidently unable to prevent the accumulation of these cells, but p53 mutations are observed in approximately 21% of cases, and are thus not prerequisite for DS AMKL. 48 GATA-1s has the complete DBD and should interact with p53 as native GATA-1. It would be interesting to investigate whether the interaction between GATA-1 and p53 described in this study prevents the p53 response, allowing the expansion of this cell type. The interaction could also be relevant in preventing the activation of the p53 pathway in other leukemias that express hematopoietic GATA factors. Targeting the interaction in diseased cells may be therapeutic.

Inhibition in the transactivation assay is reciprocal between the p53 and GATA-1 proteins, and our competition assay ( Figure 7 ) shows that p53TAD is involved. We propose that only the inhibition of p53 by GATA-1 is functionally important, and may be needed to prevent the induction of the p53 pathway and to avoid apoptosis and/or senescence during red cell development. To accomplish this, GATA-1 regulates p53 and several proteins usually controlled by p53 to cause cell cycle withdrawal to facilitate enucleation and the formation of functional erythrocytes.

There is precedent for the participation of GATA-1 in this type of regulation, although the mechanism may not be identical. The association of PU.1 with GATA-1 through the DBDs of both proteins and the PU.1 TAD also results in a reciprocal inhibition of activity, which specifies the choice of either the myeloerythroid or myelolymphoid lineages. 24 , 42 , 49 , 50 Each transcription factor drives cells toward a specific hematopoietic potential, while simultaneously inactivating the master regulator that specifies alternate lineages. The similarity of the TADs of p53 and PU.1 suggests that both the transactivation and the inhibitory functions of this domain have been conserved between the 2 proteins.
