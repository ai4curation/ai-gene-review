In addition to orchestrating the expression of all erythroid-specific genes, 
GATA-1 controls the growth, differentiation, and survival of the erythroid 
lineage through the regulation of genes that manipulate the cell cycle and 
apoptosis. The stages of mammalian erythropoiesis include global gene 
inactivation, nuclear condensation, and enucleation to yield circulating 
erythrocytes, and some of the genes whose expression are altered by GATA-1 
during this process are members of the p53 pathway. In this study, we 
demonstrate a specific in vitro interaction between the transactivation domain 
of p53 (p53TAD) and a segment of the GATA-1 DNA-binding domain that includes the 
carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger domain. We also show by immunoprecipitation that 
the native GATA-1 and p53 interact in erythroid cells and that activation of 
p53-responsive promoters in an erythroid cell line can be inhibited by the 
overexpression of GATA-1. Mutational analysis reveals that GATA-1 inhibition of 
p53 minimally requires the segment of the GATA-1 DNA-binding domain that 
interacts with p53TAD. This inhibition is reciprocal, as the activation of a 
GATA-1-responsive promoter can be inhibited by p53. Based on these findings, we 
conclude that inhibition of the p53 pathway by GATA-1 may be essential for 
erythroid cell development and survival.

Mutational analysis reveals that GATA-1 inhibition of p53 minimally requires the segment of the GATA-1 DNA-binding domain that interacts with p53TAD. This inhibition is reciprocal, as the activation of a GATA-1â€“responsive promoter can be inhibited by p53. Based on these findings, we conclude that inhibition of the p53 pathway by GATA-1 may be essential for erythroid cell development and survival.
