Unlike the other MAP3Ks, MEKK1 (encoded by Map3k1) contains a PHD motif. To 
understand the role of this motif, we have created a knockin mutant of mouse 
Map3k1 (Map3k1(m) (PHD)) with an inactive PHD motif. Map3k1(m) (PHD) ES cells 
demonstrate that the MEKK1 PHD controls p38 and JNK activation during TGF-β, EGF 
and microtubule disruption signalling, but does not affect MAPK responses to 
hyperosmotic stress. Protein microarray profiling identified the adaptor TAB1 as 
a PHD substrate, and TGF-β- or EGF-stimulated Map3k1(m) (PHD) ES cells exhibit 
defective non-canonical ubiquitination of MEKK1 and TAB1. The MEKK1 PHD binds 
and mediates the transfer of Lys63-linked poly-Ub, using the conjugating enzyme 
UBE2N, onto TAB1 to regulate TAK1 and MAPK activation by TGF-β and EGF. Both the 
MEKK1 PHD and TAB1 are critical for ES-cell differentiation and tumourigenesis. 
Map3k1(m) (PHD) (/+) mice exhibit aberrant cardiac tissue, B-cell development, 
testis and T-cell signalling.
