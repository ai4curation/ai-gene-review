SnoN/SkiL (TGFβ regulator) is dysregulated in ovarian cancer, a disease 
associated with acquired drug-resistance. Arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃, used in 
treating APL) induces SnoN to oppose the apoptotic response in ovarian cancer 
cells. We now report that As₂O₃ increases phosphorylation of EGFR/p66ShcA and 
EGFR degradation. As₂O₃ activates Src(Y416) whose activity (inhibited by PP2) 
modulates EGFR activation, its interaction with Shc/Grb2, and p-AKT. Inhibition 
of PI3K reduces SnoN and cell survival. Although EGFR or MAPK1 siRNA did not 
alter SnoN expression, As₂O₃-induced cleaved PARP was reduced together with 
increased XIAP. Collectively, As₂O₃ mediates an initial rise in pY-Src(416) to 
regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway which increases SnoN and cell survival; these 
early events may counter the cell death response associated with increased 
pY-EGFR/MAPK activation.

Abstract

SnoN/SkiL (TGFβ regulator) is dysregulated in ovarian cancer, a disease associated with acquired drug-resistance. Arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 used in treating APL) induces SnoN to oppose the apoptotic response in ovarian cancer cells. We now report that As 2 O 3 increases phosphorylation of EGFR/p66ShcA and EGFR degradation. As 2 O 3 activates Src(Y416) whose activity (inhibited by PP2) modulates EGFR activation, its interaction with Shc/Grb2, and p-AKT. Inhibition of PI3K reduces SnoN and cell survival. Although EGFR or MAPK1 siRNA did not alter SnoN expression, As 2 O 3 –induced cleaved PARP was reduced together with increased XIAP. Collectively, As 2 O 3 mediates an initial rise in pY-Src(416) to regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway which increases SnoN and cell survival; these early events may counter the cell death response associated with increased pY-EGFR/MAPK activation.

1. Introduction

Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Regrettably, the current chemotherapeutics (platinum/taxane-based drugs) have not markedly increased recurrence-free survival of this deadly disease. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of novel treatment strategies. Specific genes located in regions of genomic aberrations associated with ovarian cancers include two co-transcriptional repressors, SnoN/SkiL [ 1 ] and ecotropic viral integration site-1 ( EVI1 ) [ 2 ], amplified at the 3q26.2 locus and involved in the TGF-β signaling cascade. Other genetic alterations include amplification of the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K, PIK3CA ) located at the 3q26.3 locus [ 3 ]. Inhibition of this pathway sensitizes multiple cancer cell types to chemotherapeutic agents [ 4 ].

As 2 O 3 , a clinically approved drug in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), elicits antitumor properties in cells derived from solid tumors such as ovarian cancers [ 5 ]. As 2 O 3 treatment leads to cytotoxicity via induction of apoptosis [ 5 ]. We have shown that As 2 O 3 treatment in epithelial ovarian cancer cells alters expression of certain TGFβ mediators [ 6 ]. This cytotoxic agent markedly induces SnoN/SkiL expression concurrent with pro-survival autophagy in a reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent manner. This protective pathway antagonizes the As 2 O 3 -induced apoptotic response [ 6 ]. Indeed, small interfering RNA-mediated SnoN knockdown increases the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to As 2 O 3 [ 6 ]. However, the mechanisms through which As 2 O 3 induce SnoN expression and the consequent cell death response are not clearly understood.

Herein, we assess the contribution of EGFR and downstream pathways including activation of the Src/PI3K/AKT and ShcA/Grb2/MAPK signaling pathways to As 2 O 3 -induced SnoN expression and the cell death response. We identified that As 2 O 3 activates EGFR and promotes phosphorylation of p66 ShcA and its interaction with the Grb2 adaptor protein with slower kinetics compared to EGF-mediated EGFR activation. Furthermore, EGFR is degraded upon As 2 O 3 treatment in combination with cycloheximide. Inhibitors of Src (PP2 but not SU6656), PI3K (LY294002 or GDC0941 (to a lesser degree)), and knockdown of PIK3CA altered As 2 O 3 -induced changes in SnoN expression. In contrast to EGF, PP2 modulated As 2 O 3 -induced EGFR activation and interaction with Shc/Grb2. We also noted reduced Grb2-EGFR interaction with p66 ShcA knockdown in the presence of As 2 O 3 implicating p66 ShcA isoform in mediating this interaction. With MAPK1 and EGFR (to a lesser extent) siRNA, we noted a significant increase in cell survival. Together, our results implicate activation of the pro-survival PI3K pathway in As 2 O 3 –induced changes in SnoN expression and cell survival. These events occur prior to full activation of the EGFR/MAPK pathway which may contribute to the As 2 O 3 -induced cell death response.

4. Discussion

We previously demonstrated that As 2 O 3 induces autophagy in ovarian carcinoma cells and that increased expression of SnoN, a TGFβ co-transcriptional repressor, modulates As 2 O 3 -induced protective autophagy [ 6 ]. Since EGFR and downstream signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT) are amplified and/or dysregulated in cancers [ 3 , 12 , 13 ], we assessed their contribution to As 2 O 3 -induced cell death response and to regulation of SnoN expression in ovarian cancer cells. Since HEY cells are very resistant to As 2 O 3 , we assessed three independent doses of As 2 O 3 (5, 10, and 25 µM) which elicits similar expression profiles of the assessed markers; however, we noted increased intensity of cleaved PARP and cell death with higher doses of As 2 O 3 (cleaved PARP together with reduction in anti-apoptotic markers (i.e. Bcl-XL and XIAP) is observed weakly with 10µM As 2 O 3 ). In A431 cells, a dose of 20 µM As 2 O 3 was utilized to investigate the cellular response on the EGFR/ERK signaling cascade [ 14 , 15 ]; this dose is markedly higher to doses used in the treatment of APL (~2 µM As 2 O 3 ). As 2 O 3 -treated ovarian carcinoma cells show a rapid and transient AKT activation prior to pY-EGFR. We now demonstrate that the PI3K pathway transcriptionally regulates SnoN expression and the consequent cell death response (apoptosis) via the use of PI3K inhibitors (LY294002/GDC0941) and specific siRNA targeting PIK3CA ( Fig. 3G and 4E ). These responses are similar to TG-interacting factor (TGIF), another transcriptional TGFβ co-repressor, whose expression levels are increased post-transcriptionally as a result of activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in HepG2 cells in response to As 2 O 3 [ 16 ].

We observed that Src activity increased upon treatment with As 2 O 3 (5, 10 and 25 µM) eliciting a biphasic profile (early (1–6 h) and late response (18 h)). We propose that the initial activation may be responsible for the early cytoprotective response while the later activation may be involved in eliciting the cell death response. Indeed, Src family members has been described to elicit both functionalities (pro- and anti-apoptotic responses) which may depend on the involvement of different Src family members [ 17 ]. The fate of the cell will likely depend, however, on the overall balance of survival and death inducing signals. Cell treatments performed in the presence of PP2 could markedly reduce SnoN mRNA and protein. In contrast, SU6656 and siRNA targeting pp60 c-Src did not alter SnoN levels (or pY-EGFR/p-AKT). Since this differential response may be due to effective inhibition of different Src family kinases by PP2 and SU6656, future directions would include identification of the specific Src family kinase member that os activated upon As 2 O 3 treatment which modulates SnoN expression.

Since phosphatase activity was not altered markedly with As 2 O 3 treatment in our cells, other mechanisms leading to EGFR activation may include Src activity which is influenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated with As 2 O 3 [ 18 ]. Interestingly, SnoN induction following As 2 O 3 treatment could be reverted by co-treatment with an anti-oxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) [ 6 ]. Thus, in response to As 2 O 3 , Src activity may be upregulated via ROS leading to increased SnoN levels. It has been reported that activation of Src leads to transactivation of the EGF receptor; in response to As 2 O 3 , EGFR can be phosphorylated at Y845 and Y1173, which are well-established c-Src phosphorylation sites [ 15 ]. In our studies, we observed that the kinetics of EGFR/p66 ShcA activation and interaction with Grb2 upon As 2 O 3 treatment was markedly slower relative to EGF and further, was modulated differently in response to PP2 and p66 ShcA siRNA. Thus, in contrast to EGF treatment, a ligand-independent mechanism (i.e. activation of non-receptor Src tyrosine kinases) is likely to be involved under our conditions leading to receptor activation in cells treated with As 2 O 3 [ 19 ].

Interestingly, activation of EGFR signaling cascade can also counteract the cell death response to various chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin [ 20 ]. These results could be explained by the level of stress induced; under moderate oxidative stress conditions, pY-EGFR elicits a pro-survival role while under severe oxidative stress, pY-EGFR leads to increased cell death [ 21 , 22 ]. Although knockdown of EGFR and MAPK1 did not alter SnoN levels, they increased cell survival. Indeed, siRNA towards MAPK1 is similar to that reported to ERK1/ERK2 which suppresses cell viability in ovarian cancer cells with chemotherapeutic agents [ 10 ]. However, in contrast to cisplatin treatment where disruption of EGFR activation increases cell death [ 23 ], disruption of EGFR/MAPK signaling with As 2 O 3 in our system leads to increased cell survival with recovery of XIAP expression. Indeed, As 2 O 3 can induce apoptosis by preventing induction of XIAP and Bcl-XL [ 24 ] together with induction of Noxa and Bim [ 25 ]. The EGFR and MAPK pathway appears to be disconnected to the regulation of SnoN expression. The cytoprotective pathway may involve an early burst of Src activity leading to SnoN upregulation which is eventually overcome by the strength of the pro-death EGFR/Src (late burst of activity)/MAPK pathway.

Since the catalytic subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) is located at 3q26.2, upstream of the chromosomal location of SnoN at 3q26.2, we propose that oncogenic cooperativity may occur between PI3K and SnoN in ovarian cancer chemoresponsiveness. Collectively, our results implicate the cytoprotective Src/PI3K pathway as contributing to SnoN expression; this may be a valuable pathway to target or develop new strategies for increasing the therapeutic effectiveness of As 2 O 3 and other chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of cancer patients.
