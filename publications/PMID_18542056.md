Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is frequently observed in human 
cancer and contributes to the growth, survival and therapeutic resistance of 
tumors. EGFRvIII is an oncogenic EGFR mutant resulting from the deletion of 
exons 2-7 and is the most common EGFR mutant observed in glioblastoma 
multiforme, an aggressive brain tumor. EGFRvIII is constitutively active but 
poorly ubiquitinated, leading to inefficient receptor trafficking to lysosomes 
and unattenuated oncogenic signaling. The mechanism by which EGFRvIII evades 
downregulation is not fully understood although recent studies suggest that its 
interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Cbl may be compromised. In this study, we 
examine the regulation of EGFRvIII by the recently identified negative 
regulator, LRIG1, which targets EGFR through recognition of its extracellular 
domain. Here, we determine whether the extracellular domain deletion in EGFRvIII 
renders it refractory to LRIG1 regulation. We find that EGFRvIII retains 
interaction with LRIG1 and is in fact more sensitive to LRIG1 action than 
wild-type receptor. We demonstrate that LRIG1 regulation of EGFRvIII is distinct 
from the only other known mechanism of EGFR regulation, Cbl-mediated 
degradation. Ectopic expression of LRIG1 in EGFRvIII(+) glioblastoma cells 
opposes EGFRvIII-driven tumor cell proliferation, survival, motility and 
invasion. Finally, RNAi-mediated silencing of LRIG1 alters EGFRvIII 
intracellular trafficking and leads to enhanced EGFRvIII expression, suggesting 
that loss of LRIG1 in tumors may contribute to a permissive environment for 
EGFRvIII overexpression, contributing to EGFRvIII oncogenesis.

Introduction

Aberrant activation of the ErbB signaling network occurs in cancer via autocrine production of ligand, receptor overexpression, gene amplification and mutation. In the case of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), each of these mechanisms is operative ( Sibilia et al ., 2007 ). Overexpression of EGFR has been documented in a variety of solid tumor types and predicts reduced recurrence-free and overall patient survival. Amplification of the EGFR gene occurs in a high proportion of glioblastomas and is often accompanied by gene rearrangement ( Nicholas et al ., 2006 ). The most common of these rearrangements leads to the deletion of exons 2–7, yielding a receptor that lacks amino acids 6–273 of the extracellular domain, known as EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII). This deletion renders EGFRvIII unable to bind ligand, resulting in a receptor with weak but constitutive signaling activity, leading to enhanced tumor cell growth and survival ( Rosell et al ., 2006 ). Expression of EGFRvIII is a negative prognostic indicator in glioblastoma and mediates resistance to EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) through drug-resistant activation of Akt ( Learn et al ., 2004 ). As such, coexpression of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue, which opposes Akt activation, with EGFRvIII, is associated with response to EGFR-targeted TKIs both in cultured cell experiments and in a clinical setting ( Mellinghoff et al ., 2005 ).

In normal cells, ligand-stimulated activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is followed by attenuation of receptor signaling through internalization, ubiquitination and degradation in lysosomes. A tight coupling of these opposing processes assures the maintenance of signaling within a narrow window commensurate with normal physiology. The importance of this regulatory mechanism is underscored by the fact that a noninternalizing EGFR mutant elicits enhanced mitogenesis and cellular transformation ( Wells et al ., 1990 ). EGFRvIII is very inefficiently degraded compared to wild-type EGFR and expression of EGFRvIII is sufficient for cellular transformation ( Davies et al ., 2006 ).

The mechanism by which EGFRvIII evades downregulation, has been intensely studied yet remains controversial. A recent study found that inefficient internalization accompanied by efficient recycling to the plasma membrane contributes to the long half-life of EGFRvIII ( Grandal et al ., 2007 ). The ubiquitin ligase Cbl plays an essential role in EGFR degradation and is recruited to the receptor following ligand stimulation via two mechanisms: through a direct interaction with Y 1045 of the receptor and/or indirectly through interaction with the adaptor protein Grb2 ( Waterman et al ., 2002 ). Hypophosphorylation of EGFRvIII on Y 1045 has been reported to attenuate Cbl interaction with the receptor, promoting EGFRvIII stability ( Han et al ., 2006 ). However, an opposing study found that EGFRvIII interaction with Cbl remained intact and that EGFRvIII was subject to Cbl regulation in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner ( Davies et al ., 2006 ). Further study is needed to resolve whether EGFRvIII eludes regulation by Cbl.

Leucine rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain protein-1 (LRIG1), a recently identified negative regulator of ErbB and Met RTKs, enhances both basal and ligand-stimulated receptor ubiquitination and degradation. With respect to the EGF receptor, LRIG1 has been reported to function by augmenting Cbl recruitment to the receptor ( Gur et al ., 2004 ). However, the requirement of Cbl for LRIG1 action is not universal as LRIG1-mediated Met degradation is independent of Cbl ( Shattuck et al ., 2007 ). LRIG1 opposes tumor cell proliferation, motility and invasion in vitro and has been proposed to function as a tumor suppressor ( Hedman et al ., 2002 ). Although genetic evidence of LRIG1’s tumor suppressor activity is currently lacking, LRIG1 null mice develop a psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, consistent with a role for LRIG1 as a growth suppressor ( Suzuki et al ., 2002 ). In addition, LRIG1 is underexpressed in a number of tumor types ( Thomasson et al ., 2003 ; Tanemura et al ., 2005 ; Lindström et al ., 2008 ; Miller et al ., under revision).

LRIG1 interaction with ErbB receptors is specified by a mutual interaction amongst extracellular domains ( Gur et al ., 2004 ). EGFRvIII lacks 267 amino acids of the receptor extracellular domain comprising the dimerization arm and a portion of the ligand-binding domain. This large deletion could conceivably render EGFRvIII refractory to LRIG1 action by disrupting complex formation and in turn could contribute to the long half-life of the receptor. In this manuscript we examine whether EGFRvIII escapes regulation by LRIG1. We find that EGFRvIII retains the ability to interact with LRIG1 and provide evidence that LRIG1 opposes EGFRvIII oncogenic activity.

Discussion

Aberrant or unopposed signaling from RTKs is a recurrent theme in human diseases, most notably in cancer. Receptor activation in healthy cells is balanced by receptor deactivation, mediated by a variety of negative regulatory molecules. These molecules fall into several categories, including phosphatases and ubiquitin ligases, and impinge upon both the magnitude and duration of RTK signaling ( Sweeney et al ., 2006 ; Kirisits et al ., 2007 ). Evasion of downregulation is a powerful mechanism by which RTKs can tip the balance in the favor of uncontrolled growth and eventual tumor formation. Indeed, EGFRvIII internalization is significantly impaired compared to wild-type receptor and when coupled with efficient recycling, provides a mechanism by which growth and survival signals are amplified by this receptor ( Grandal et al ., 1997 ; Huang et al ., 2007 ).

In this study, we considered whether EGFRvIII eludes regulation by the negative regulatory protein, LRIG1. The phenotype of the LRIG1 knockout mouse, a psoriatic-like epidermal hyperplasia, supports its role as a growth suppressor and negative regulator of EGFR signaling because transgenic mice overexpressing EGFR ligands ( Cook et al ., 1997 ; Vassar and Fuchs, 1991 ) display a phenotype similar to LRIG1 −/− mice. Interestingly, loss of a distinct negative regulator of ErbB receptors, Mig6/RALT, also manifests in an epidermal hyperplasia, indicating that the skin is a sensitive reporter of ErbB oversignaling ( Ferby et al ., 2006 ). Deletion analysis of LRIG1 and ErbB receptors found that the extracellular domains of both proteins are necessary and sufficient for interaction ( Gur et al ., 2004 ). LRIG1 represents the first example of a protein that selects EGFR for degradation through recognition of its extracellular domain, raising the possibility that oncogenic receptors may escape regulation through deletion of LRIG1 recognition elements.

In this study, we find that the deletion in EGFRvIII does not render this receptor refractory to regulation by LRIG1. We demonstrate that EGFRvIII retains interaction with LRIG1 by co-immunoprecipitation analysis and that EGFRvIII is destabilized by LRIG1 coexpression as efficiently, if not more efficiently, than wild-type receptor. Despite a previous report that LRIG1 acts in a Cbl-dependent manner with respect to EGFR degradation, we find that Cbl activity is dispensable for LRIG1-mediated ligand-independent degradation of EGFRvIII, representing the first example of a Cbl-independent means of EGFR degradation. Presumably, LRIG1 acts by recruiting novel components of the protein degradation machinery to its targets and studies are ongoing in our lab to identify these components.

EGFRvIII(+) tumors are highly aggressive and refractory to conventional therapeutic approaches. In this study, we find that ectopic expression of LRIG1 potently inhibits tumor cell behaviors that impact clinical outcome, including growth, motility and invasion. EGFRvIII(+) glioblastomas are highly invasive and readily infiltrate surrounding brain tissue, forming a mesh-like network of tumor, making complete surgical removal impossible. Chemoresistance of remaining tumor tissue presents a significant problem, leading to recurrence following surgical resection in nearly all patients ( Raizer, 2005 ). Treatment of U87MG-EGFRvIII cells with AG1478, a specific EGFR TKI, sensitizes these cells to cisplatin, presumably through an attenuation of EGFRvIII-mediated survival signals ( Huang et al ., 2007 ). LRIG1, by virtue of its effects on EGFRvIII stability, attenuates signaling through the pro-survival PI-3 kinase pathway and leads to a sensitization of U87MG-EGFRvIII cells to both cisplatin and the oral alkylating agent, temozolomide. These results suggest that restoration of LRIG1 to EGFRvIII(+) tumors could have far-reaching effects on several key parameters of aggressive tumor cell behavior and could perhaps represent an alternative approach for tumors that develop resistance to TKIs. However, it should be emphasized that restoration of a large transmembrane protein such as LRIG1 to tumor cells is currently not feasible and represents a technical hurdle. Use of a soluble version of LRIG1 or peptides derived from LRIG1 ( Goldoni et al ., 2007 ) may hold promise for future therapies.

Mechanisms of receptor overexpression have been the subject of intense study for some years due to their clear link to the oncogenic phenotype. An interesting theme that has emerged from recent work suggests that the loss of negative regulatory molecules creates a ‘permissive environment’ for receptor overexpression. Negative regulatory molecules continue to antagonize receptor signaling, even in the face of overwhelming receptor overexpression, and silencing or loss of these molecules further promotes tumor cell growth and survival. This is evidenced by recent work demonstrating that reconstitution of the negative regulator Mig6/RALT in ErbB2-amplified breast cancer cells inhibits ErbB2-dependent mitogenesis and reverses Herceptin resistance ( Anastasi et al ., 2005 ). These findings suggest that loss of RALT and other negative regulatory molecules such as LRIG1 may cooperate with receptor amplification to drive full oncogenic signaling. In agreement with this, depletion of LRIG1 from U87MG-EGFRvIII cells leads to a further increase in EGFRvIII expression through decreased receptor trafficking to lysosomes. These results indicate that although EGFRvIII is not refractory to LRIG1 by ‘design’, depletion or loss of LRIG1 in EGFRvIII(+) tumors could contribute to EGFRvIII overexpression and drive the oncogenic phenotype.
