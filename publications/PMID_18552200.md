The human DDB1-CUL4 ASSOCIATED FACTOR (DCAF) proteins have been reported to 
interact directly with UV-DAMAGED DNA BINDING PROTEIN1 (DDB1) through the WDxR 
motif in their WD40 domain and function as substrate-recognition receptors for 
CULLIN4-based E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here, we identified and characterized a 
homolog of human DCAF1/VprBP in Arabidopsis thaliana. Yeast two-hybrid analysis 
demonstrated the physical interaction between DCAF1 and DDB1 from Arabidopsis, 
which is likely mediated via the WD40 domain of DCAF1 that contains two WDxR 
motifs. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that DCAF1 associates with 
DDB1, RELATED TO UBIQUITIN-modified CUL4, and the COP9 signalosome in vivo but 
not with CULLIN-ASSOCIATED and NEDDYLATION-DISSOCIATED1, CONSTITUTIVE 
PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), or the COP10-DET1-DDB1 complex, supporting the 
existence of a distinct Arabidopsis CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase, the 
CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1 complex. Transient expression of fluorescently tagged DCAF1, 
DDB1, and CUL4 in onion epidermal cells showed their colocalization in the 
nucleus, consistent with the notion that the CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1 complex functions 
as a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase. Genetic and phenotypic analysis of two T-DNA 
insertion mutants of DCAF1 showed that embryonic development of the dcaf1 
homozygote is arrested at the globular stage, indicating that DCAF1 is essential 
for plant embryogenesis. Reducing the levels of DCAF1 leads to diverse 
developmental defects, implying that DCAF1 might be involved in multiple 
developmental pathways.

INTRODUCTION

Protein ubiquitination is an important and universal posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. In this process, a cascade of reactions is performed by three distinct enzymes, ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin protein ligase (E3). Among them, substrate specificity is largely dependent on E3 ubiquitin ligases, which mediate the recruitment of target protein and the optimal transfer of the ubiquitin moiety from E2 enzyme to the target. Therefore, eukaryotic cells contain hundreds or thousands of distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases for specific ubiquitination of diverse substrates in different biological processes ( Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002 ; Smalle and Vierstra, 2004 ).

CUL4-based E3 ubiquitin ligases constitute a large subfamily of CULLIN-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and consist of three core subunits: CULLIN4 (CUL4), a RING finger protein REGULATOR OF CULLINS1 (ROC1)/RING-BOX1 (RBX1), and UV-DAMAGED DNA BINDING PROTEIN1 (DDB1) ( Lee and Zhou, 2007 ). Structurally, the arc-shaped helical N-terminal domain of CUL4 interacts extensively with the β-propeller B domain of the adapter protein DDB1 to assemble a substrate receptor complex, in which the BPA and BPC double propellers of DDB1 fold tightly into a clam-shaped pocket for substrate receptor binding. The RING finger protein ROC1/RBX1 binds to the globular C-terminal portion of CUL4 and recruits E2 enzyme to form a catalytic core. Therefore, CUL4 forms a rigid packing architecture for the precise positioning of substrate toward E2 enzyme, therefore facilitating the ubiquitin transfer ( Zheng et al., 2002 ; Angers et al., 2006 ; Li et al., 2006 ).

The core components of CUL4-based E3 ubiquitin ligases, including CUL4 and DDB1, are highly conserved during evolution and have also been studied in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Schroeder et al., 2002 ; Bernhardt et al., 2006 ; Chen et al., 2006 ). Arabidopsis CUL4 interacts with DDB1 and ROC1/RBX1 in a conserved manner similar to that of the human DDB1-CUL4-ROC1/RBX1 complex ( Angers et al., 2006 ; Bernhardt et al., 2006 ; Li et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, several lines of evidence, including in vivo interactions of CUL4 with CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 10 (COP10) and ROC1/RBX1, and in vitro reconstruction of the COP10-DET1-DDB1 (CDD) complex with CUL4-ROC1/RBX1 to form an active E3 ubiquitin ligase, suggest the existence of a CDD-CUL4-ROC1/RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in Arabidopsis ( Chen et al., 2006 ). It is also shown that CUL4 binds to CULLIN-ASSOCIATED and NEDDYLATION-DISSOCIATED1 (CAND1) and the COP9 signalosome (CSN) in a mutually exclusive manner and is modified by RELATED TO UBIQUITIN (RUB), consistent with the known characteristics of the CRL E3 enzyme activity regulation mechanism ( Petroski and Deshaies, 2005 ; Chen et al., 2006 ). Reducing the amount of CUL4 results in various defects in Arabidopsis development ( Bernhardt et al., 2006 ; Chen et al., 2006 ). DDB1 has two homologs in Arabidopsis that are encoded by DDB1A and DDB1B , respectively. While the ddb1a mutant shows no obvious phenotype but can enhance the de-etiolated1 ( det1 ) phenotype in the det1 ddb1a double mutant, the ddb1b null mutant is lethal ( Schroeder et al., 2002 ). The genetic and phenotypic analysis of both core components so far has provided evidence for the essential function of CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligases in Arabidopsis .

The substrate recruitment module for CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligases has recently been revealed ( Angers et al., 2006 ; He et al., 2006 ; Higa et al., 2006 ; Jin et al., 2006 ). Through proteomic, structural, and bioinformatics analysis, it was found that CUL4, via its linker protein, DDB1, potentially interacts with a large number of proteins containing WD40 repeats, which form a subgroup of the WD40 proteins and are variably referred to as DDB1-CUL4 ASSOCIATED FACTOR (DCAF) proteins, or DDB1 binding WD40 (DWD) proteins, or CUL4- and DDB1-associated WD40-repeat proteins ( Angers et al., 2006 ; He et al., 2006 ; Higa et al., 2006 ; Jin et al., 2006 ). Structure-based sequence analysis and point mutagenesis experiments revealed the presence of one or two copies of the WDxR motif located in the WD40 domain of most DCAF proteins, and within the WDxR motif, the conserved Asp and Arg residues are major determinant features for DCAF proteins to bind DDB1 ( Angers et al., 2006 ; Higa et al., 2006 ; Jin et al., 2006 ). Thus, the WDxR motif–containing WD40 domain is defined as the signature of potential substrate receptors of CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligases, and as many as 90 distinct DWD proteins have been predicted in the human genome ( He et al., 2006 ). Most recently, 85 WD40 proteins in Arabidopsis and 78 WD40 proteins in rice ( Oryza sativa ) have been found to contain one or two copies of a conserved 16–amino acid DDB1-interacting motif, referred to as the DWD motif, that can potentially act as substrate receptors in different CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligases ( Lee et al., 2008 ). These findings suggest that CUL4 may potentially constitute a large number of distinct CUL4-DDB1-DCAF/DWD E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes in vivo.

In Arabidopsis , the 85 DWD proteins can be divided into five subgroups based on the phylogenetic relationship of their DWD motifs, and representative proteins from each subgroup have been tested and confirmed for their ability to interact with DDB1 in vitro and associate with DDB1 and CUL4 in vivo ( Lee et al., 2008 ). Among those Arabidopsis DWD proteins, so far only PLEIOTROPIC REGULATORY LOCUS1 has been shown to act as a substrate receptor to target its specific substrate ARABIDOPSIS SNF1 KINASE HOMOLOG 10 for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation ( Lee et al., 2008 ).

In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a human DCAF1/VprBP homolog in Arabidopsis . Human DCAF1 was originally identified as a Vpr binding protein (VprBP) that interacts with a viral accessory protein (Vpr) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Human DCAF1 is one of the well-studied DCAF proteins, which contains two WDxR motifs within its WD40 domain ( Angers et al., 2006 ). The human CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase is recruited by HIV-1 protein Vpr to trigger G2 arrest of HIV-1 infected cells ( Belzile et al., 2007 ; Hrecka et al., 2007 ; Le Rouzic et al., 2007 ; Schröfelbauer et al., 2007 ; Tan et al., 2007 ; Wen et al., 2007 ), while the cellular function of DCAF1 and the physiological significance underlying the Vpr-DCAF1 interaction for HIV viral propagation both remains unclear. Here, we show that Arabidopsis DCAF1 also contains two WDxR motifs within its WD40 domain, which are essential for the interaction with DDB1. We also provide evidence for the existence of a CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in Arabidopsis , which is possibly regulated by RUB, CSN, and CAND1. Interestingly, DCAF1 was not predicted to be a DWD protein based on the criterion of a 16–amino acid DWD motif that was used in a previous report ( Lee et al., 2008 ), suggesting that the number of DWD proteins may be underestimated and that there are potentially other WD40 proteins that can function as substrate receptors of CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligases. The broad expression of DCAF1 , the nuclear colocalization of DCAF1 with CUL4 and DDB1, the embryo lethal phenotype of dcaf1 homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants, and the multifaceted developmental defects shown by dcaf1cs cosuppression lines suggest that DCAF1 and CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase participate in many biological processes in Arabidopsis .

Reducing the Amount of DCAF1 Results in Multifaceted Developmental Defects inArabidopsis

Since embryonic lethality of dcaf1 homozygous mutants prevents them from being analyzed beyond embryonic development, we sought to investigate the physiological function of DCAF1 by altering its expression level in Arabidopsis . To this end, we constructed two 35S promoter–driven transgenes expressing full-length DCAF1 fused with three copies of HA tag at the N terminus (HA-DCAF1) or three copies of Flag tag at the C terminus (DCAF1-Flag), respectively. Both constructs were introduced into wild-type backgrounds. The accumulation of HA-DCAF1 and DCAF1-Flag fusion proteins in transgenic plants and the endogenous DCAF1 protein was examined using antibodies against DCAF1 or the corresponding tag. Several DCAF1 overexpression lines were isolated from 35S:DCAF1-Flag transgenic plants; however, no obvious developmental defects were observed under normal growth conditions, as was the case with DCAF1g/dcaf1 transgenic plants.

Interestingly, we also isolated several cosuppression lines from the 35S:HA-DCAF1 transgenic plants (named dcaf1cs ), in which endogenous DCAF1 protein abundance was downregulated by the presence of the exogenous transgene ( Figure 9H ), and no HA-DCAF1 fusion protein could be detected by the anti-HA antibody. These dcaf1cs cosuppression transgenic lines exhibited multifaceted developmental defects, as shown in Figures 9A to 9G . For two-week-old seedlings, dcaf1cs plants already looked distinct from their wild-type counterparts in that they were smaller and frequently exhibited an asymmetrical development with abnormal phyllotaxy and irregularly shaped true leaves ( Figure 9A ). During later vegetative phases, dcaf1cs plants tended to produce smaller but more rosette leaves than wild-type plants, with various leaf developmental patterns, including lobed, curled, or asymmetrical rosette leaves ( Figures 9C and 9D ). In the reproductive phase, the phenotypic differences between dcaf1cs and wild-type plants became more drastic. During the transition from vegetative to reproductive development, dcaf1cs plants generally tended to produce more than two primary shoots, while only one primary shoot was produced by most wild-type plants ( Figure 9C ). Following stem elongation and emergence of lateral branches, most dcaf1cs plants exhibited obvious dwarfism with multiple slimmer primary shoots ( Figure 9F ) and irregular development of nodes and internodes, including more than two axillary buds and cauline leaves at the same node, decreased distance between two neighboring nodes, and abnormal division or combination of internodes ( Figure 9E ). Moreover, some dcaf1cs plants produced abnormal flowers with three, five, or six petals ( Figure 9B ) as opposed to the cruciate four petals in the wild-type flowers, and siliques of dcaf1cs were smaller than their wild-type counterparts ( Figure 9G ). In summary, different dcaf1cs lines tended to share common developmental defects, although often to different degrees of severity. The defects throughout vegetative and reproductive development displayed by dcaf1cs plants suggest that the DCAF1 protein and CUL4-DDB1-DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase may participate in many developmental processes in Arabidopsis . In the future, the identification of specific E3 ubiquitin ligase substrates recruited by DCAF1 will further reveal its biological functions.
