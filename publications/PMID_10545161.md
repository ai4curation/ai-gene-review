Mice lacking p35, an activator of cdk5 in the central nervous system (CNS), 
exhibit defects in a variety of CNS structures, most prominently characterized 
by a disruption in the laminar structure of the neocortex (Chae et al., 1997). 
In addition, alterations of certain axonal fiber tracts are found in the cortex 
of p35 mutant mice. Notably, the corpus callosum appears bundled at the midline, 
but dispersed lateral to the midline. Tracer injection experiments in adult p35 
mutant mice reveal that projecting cortical axons fail to assimilate into the 
corpus callosum, and take oblique paths to the midline. After crossing the 
midline, cortical axons defasciculate prematurely from the corpus callosum and 
take similarly oblique paths through the cortex. This callosal phenotype is not 
detected in reeler mice, which also exhibit defects in cortical lamination, 
suggesting that the lack of fasciculation of callosal axons is not an inherent 
manifestation of a disruption of cortical lamination. The embryonic callosal 
axon tract is defasciculated before crossing the midline, suggesting that axon 
guidance may be affected during embryonic development of the corpus callosum. In 
addition, embryonic thalamocortical afferents also exhibit a defasciculated 
phenotype. These results suggest that defective axonal fasciculation and 
guidance may be primary responses to the loss of p35 in the cortex. Furthermore, 
this study postulates a role for the p35/cdk5 kinase in molecular signaling 
pathways necessary for proper guidance of selective axons during embryonic 
development.
