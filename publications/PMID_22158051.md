Alpha B-crystallin (CRYAB) maps within the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 
tumor-suppressive critical region 11q22-23 and its downregulation is 
significantly associated with the progression of NPC. However, little is known 
about the functional impact of CRYAB on NPC progression. In this study we 
evaluated the NPC tumor-suppressive and progression-associated functions of 
CRYAB. Activation of CRYAB suppressed NPC tumor formation in nude mice. 
Overexpression of CRYAB affected NPC progression-associated phenotypes such as 
loss of cell adhesion, invasion, interaction with the tumor microenvironment, 
invasive protrusion formation in three dimensional Matrigel culture, as well as 
expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated markers. CRYAB 
mediates this ability to suppress cancer progression by inhibition of E-cadherin 
cytoplasmic internalization and maintenance of β-catenin in the membrane that 
subsequently reduces the levels of expression of critical downstream targets 
such as cyclin-D1 and c-myc. Both ectopically expressed and recombinant CRYAB 
proteins were associated with endogenous E-cadherin and β-catenin, and, thus, 
the cadherin/catenin adherens junction. The CRYAB α-crystallin core domain is 
responsible for the interaction of CRYAB with both E-cadherin and β-catenin. 
Taken together, these results indicate that CRYAB functions to suppress NPC 
progression by associating with the cadherin/catenin adherens junction and 
modulating the β-catenin function.
