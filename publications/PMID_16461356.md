The immune cell adaptor adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein 
(ADAP) and its binding to T-cell adaptor Src kinase-associated protein of 55 kDa 
(SKAP-55) play a key role in the modulation of T-cell adhesion. While primary 
binding occurs via SKAP-55 SH3 domain binding to a proline-rich region in ADAP, 
a second interaction occurs between the ADAP C-terminal SH3 domain (ADAP-SH3c) 
and a non-canonical RKXXY294XXY297 motif in SKAP-55. Increasing numbers of 
non-canonical SH3 domain binding motifs have been identified in a number of 
biological systems. The presence of tyrosine residues in the SKAP-55 
RKXXY294XXY297 motif suggested that phosphorylation might influence this unusual 
SH3 domain interaction. Here, we show that the Src kinase p59fyn can induce the 
in vivo phosphorylation of the motif, and this event blocks ADAP-SH3c domain 
binding to the peptide motif. The importance of tyrosine phosphorylation was 
confirmed by plasmon resonance interaction analysis showing that phosphorylation 
of Tyr294 residue plays a central role in mediating dissociation, whereas 
phosphorylation of the second Tyr297 had no effect. Although loss of this 
secondary interaction did not result in the disruption of the complex, the Y294F 
mutation blocked T-cell receptor-induced up-regulation of lymphocyte 
function-associated antigen-1-mediated adhesion to intercellular adhesion 
molecule-1 and interleukin-2 promoter activity. Our findings identify a RKXXY294 
motif in SKAP-55 that mediates unique ADAP SH3c domain binding and is needed for 
LFA-1-mediated adhesion and cytokine production.
