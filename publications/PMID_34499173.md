Protein-protein interactions are vital for executing nearly all cellular 
processes. To facilitate the detection of protein-protein interactions in living 
cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, here we present an 
efficient and convenient method termed the Pil1 co-tethering assay. In its basic 
form, we tether a bait protein to mCherry-tagged Pil1, which forms cortical 
filamentary structures, and examine whether a GFP-tagged prey protein 
colocalizes with the bait. We demonstrate that this assay is capable of 
detecting pairwise protein-protein interactions of cytosolic proteins and 
nuclear proteins. Furthermore, we show that this assay can be used for detecting 
not only binary protein-protein interactions, but also ternary and quaternary 
protein-protein interactions. Using this assay, we systematically characterized 
the protein-protein interactions in the Atg1 complex and in the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complexes and found that Atg38 is 
incorporated into the PtdIns3K complex I via an Atg38-Vps34 interaction. Our 
data show that this assay is a useful and versatile tool and should be added to 
the routine toolbox of fission yeast researchers. This article has an associated 
First Person interview with the first author of the paper.
