AIMS: Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) have 
been established as a common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). The 
distribution of LRRK2 mRNA and protein in the human brain has previously been 
described, although it has not been reported in PD cases with the common LRRK2 
G2019S mutation.
METHODS: To further elucidate the role of LRRK2 in PD, we determined the 
localization of LRRK2 mRNA and protein in post-mortem brain tissue from control, 
idiopathic PD (IPD) and G2019S positive PD cases.
RESULTS: Widespread neuronal expression of LRRK2 mRNA and protein was recorded 
and no difference was observed in the morphological localization of LRRK2 mRNA 
or protein between control, IPD and G2019S positive PD cases. Using quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that there is no regional 
variation in LRRK2 mRNA in normal human brain, but we have identified 
differential expression of LRRK2 mRNA with significant reductions recorded in 
limbic and neocortical regions of IPD cases compared with controls. 
Semi-quantitative analysis of LRRK2 immunohistochemical staining demonstrated 
regional variation in staining intensity, with weak LRRK2 immunoreactivity 
consistently recorded in the striatum and substantia nigra. No clear differences 
were identified in LRRK2 immunoreactivity between control, IPD and G2019S 
positive PD cases. LRRK2 protein was identified in a small proportion of Lewy 
bodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that widespread dysregulation of LRRK2 mRNA 
expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of IPD.
