Several small heat shock proteins contain a well conserved alpha-crystallin 
domain, flanked by an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal extension, both of 
which vary in length and sequence. The structural and functional role of the 
C-terminal extension of small heat shock proteins, particularly of alphaA- and 
alphaB-crystallins, is not well understood. We have swapped the C-terminal 
extensions between alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins and generated two novel 
chimeric proteins, alphaABc and alphaBAc. We have investigated the 
domain-swapped chimeras for structural and functional alterations. We have used 
thermal and non-thermal models of protein aggregation and found that the 
chimeric alphaB with the C-terminal extension of alphaA-crystallin, alphaBAc, 
exhibits dramatically enhanced chaperone-like activity. Interestingly, however, 
the chimeric alphaA with the C-terminal extension of alphaB-crystallin, 
alphaABc, has almost lost its activity. Pyrene solubilization and 
bis-1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate binding studies show that alphaBAc exhibits 
more solvent-exposed hydrophobic pockets than alphaA, alphaB, or alphaABc. 
Significant tertiary structural changes are revealed by tryptophan fluorescence 
and near-UV CD studies upon swapping the C-terminal extensions. The far-UV CD 
spectrum of alphaBAc differs from that of alphaB-crystallin whereas that of 
alphaABc overlaps with that of alphaA-crystallin. Gel filtration chromatography 
shows alteration in the size of the proteins upon swapping the C-terminal 
extensions. Our study demonstrates that the unstructured C-terminal extensions 
play a crucial role in the structure and chaperone activity, in addition to 
generally believed electrostatic "solubilizer" function.
