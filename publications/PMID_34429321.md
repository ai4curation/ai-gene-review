Clonal hematopoiesis is a prevalent age-related condition associated with a 
greatly increased risk of hematologic disease; mutations in DNA 
methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) are the most common driver of this state. DNMT3A 
variants occur across the gene with some particularly associated with 
malignancy, but the functional relevance and mechanisms of pathogenesis of the 
majority of mutations are unknown. Here, we systematically investigated the 
methyltransferase activity and protein stability of 253 disease-associated 
DNMT3A mutations, and found that 74% were loss-of-function mutations. Half of 
these variants exhibited reduced protein stability and, as a class, correlated 
with greater clonal expansion and acute myeloid leukemia development. We 
investigated the mechanisms underlying the instability using a CRISPR screen and 
uncovered regulated destruction of DNMT3A mediated by the DCAF8 E3 ubiquitin 
ligase adaptor. We establish a new paradigm to classify novel variants that has 
prognostic and potential therapeutic significance for patients with hematologic 
disease. SIGNIFICANCE: DNMT3A has emerged as the most important epigenetic 
regulator and tumor suppressor in the hematopoietic system. Our study represents 
a systematic and high-throughput method to characterize the molecular impact of 
DNMT3A missense mutations and the discovery of a regulated destruction mechanism 
of DNMT3A offering new prognostic and future therapeutic avenues.See related
