Signalling through dopamine D2 receptors governs physiological functions related 
to locomotion, hormone production and drug abuse. D2 receptors are also known 
targets of antipsychotic drugs that are used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders 
such as schizophrenia. By a mechanism of alternative splicing, the D2 receptor 
gene encodes two molecularly distinct isoforms, D2S and D2L, previously thought 
to have the same function. Here we show that these receptors have distinct 
functions in vivo; D2L acts mainly at postsynaptic sites and D2S serves 
presynaptic autoreceptor functions. The cataleptic effects of the widely used 
antipsychotic haloperidol are absent in D2L-deficient mice. This suggests that 
D2L is targeted by haloperidol, with implications for treatment of 
neuropsychiatric disorders. The absence of D2L reveals that D2S inhibits D1 
receptor-mediated functions, uncovering a circuit of signalling interference 
between dopamine receptors.
