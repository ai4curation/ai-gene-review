The Bacillus subtilis spoVD gene has been cloned and sequenced. It encodes a 
71,262 Da protein with extensive sequence similarity to penicillin-binding 
proteins from various organisms. The context of this gene in the B. subtilis 
chromosome, immediately upstream of the mur operon, suggests that it is related 
to the pbpB gene of Escherichia coli, which is involved in the synthesis of 
septal peptidoglycan during cell division. Expression of spoVD in E. coli leads 
to the synthesis of a membrane-associated protein of the size expected for 
SpoVD, which can bind labelled penicillin. However, insertional disruption of 
the spoVD gene has no effect on vegetative growth or division: a second pbp-like 
gene immediately upstream of spoVD is probably the functional homologue of E. 
coli pbpB. spoVD seems instead to have a specialized role in the morphogenesis 
of the spore cortex, which is a modified form of peptidoglycan. spoVD 
transcription appears to occur from a promoter recognized by the sigma E form of 
RNA polymerase. Analysis of the expression of a spoVD'-lacZ reporter gene 
supports this notion and indicates that a second level of negative regulation is 
dependent on the SpoIIID protein. SpoVD synthesis probably occurs only in the 
mother cell since both sigma E and SpoIIID are thought to be specific to this 
cell type. Such localization of SpoVD synthesis was supported by the results of 
a genetic test showing that expression of spoVD only in the mother cell is 
sufficient for spore formation. The results support the proposition that spore 
cortex formation is determined primarily by the mother cell.
