Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 produces an extracellular cellulase system 
capable of hydrolyzing crystalline cellulose. The enzyme system involves a 
multicomponent protein aggregate (the cellulosome) with a total molecular weight 
in the millions, impeding mechanistic studies. However, two major components of 
the aggregate, SS (M(r) = 82,000) and SL (M(r) = 250,000), which act 
synergistically to hydrolyze crystalline cellulose, have been identified (J. H. 
D. Wu, W. H. Orme-Johnson, and A. L. Demain, Biochemistry 27:1703-1709, 1988). 
To further study this synergism, we cloned and sequenced the gene (celS) coding 
for the SS (CelS) protein by using a degenerate, inosine-containing 
oligonucleotide probe whose sequence was derived from the N-terminal amino acid 
sequence of the CelS protein. The open reading frame of celS consisted of 2,241 
bp encoding 741 amino acid residues. It encoded the N-terminal amino acid 
sequence and two internal peptide sequences determined for the native CelS 
protein. A putative ribosome binding site was identified at the 5' end of the 
gene. A putative signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues was adjacent to the N 
terminus of the CelS protein. The predicted molecular weight of the secreted 
protein was 80,670. The celS gene contained a conserved reiterated sequence 
encoding 24 amino acid residues found in proteins encoded by many other 
clostridial cel or xyn genes. A palindromic structure was found downstream from 
the open reading frame. The celS gene is unique among the known cel genes of C. 
thermocellum. However, it is highly homologous to the partial open reading frame 
found in C. cellulolyticum and in Caldocellum saccharolyticum, indicating that 
these genes belong to a new family of cel genes.
