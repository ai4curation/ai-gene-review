Molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 kDa (Hsp90) is known to facilitate the 
conformational maturation of a diverse range of proteins involved in different 
signal transduction pathways during development. Recent studies have implicated 
Hsp90 in transcriptional regulation and an important role for Hsp90 in 
epigenetic processes has been proposed. Importantly, genetic and pharmacological 
perturbation of Hsp90 was shown to reveal heritable phenotypic variation and 
Hsp90 was found to play an important role in buffering genetic and epigenetic 
variation whose expression led to altered phenotypes. The underlying molecular 
mechanism remains elusive, however. Here, we show a direct molecular interaction 
between Hsp90 and Trithorax (Trx). Trx is a member of the TrxG chromatin 
proteins controlling, together with the members of the Polycomb group, the 
developmental fate of cells by modulating epigenetic signals. Hsp90 cooperates 
with Trx at chromatin for maintaining the active expression state of targets 
like the Hox genes. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 results in degradation 
of Trx and a concomitant down-regulation of homeotic gene expression. A similar 
effect is observed with the human orthologue mixed-lineage leukemia. Connecting 
an epigenetic network controlling major developmental and cellular pathways with 
a system sensing external cues may explain the rapid fixation and epigenetic 
inheritance of phenotypic variation as a result of impaired Hsp90.
