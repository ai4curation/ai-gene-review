Formation of the immunological synapse between an antigen-presenting cell (APC) 
and a T cell leads to signal generation in both cells involved. In T cells, the 
lipid raft-associated transmembrane adaptor protein LAT plays a central role. 
Its phosphorylation is a crucial step in signal propagation, including the 
calcium response and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and largely 
depends on its association with the SLP76 adaptor protein. Here we report the 
discovery of a new palmitoylated transmembrane adaptor protein, termed SCIMP. 
SCIMP is expressed in B cells and other professional APCs and is localized in 
the immunological synapse due to its association with tetraspanin-enriched 
microdomains. In B cells, it is constitutively associated with Lyn kinase and 
becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after major histocompatibility complex type II 
(MHC-II) stimulation. When phosphorylated, SCIMP binds to the SLP65 adaptor 
protein and also to the inhibitory kinase Csk. While the association with SLP65 
initiates the downstream signaling cascades, Csk binding functions as a negative 
regulatory loop. The results suggest that SCIMP is involved in signal 
transduction after MHC-II stimulation and therefore serves as a regulator of 
antigen presentation and other APC functions.
