The ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 is conjugated to a variety of proteins 
including Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1), IkappaBalpha, and PML. 
SUMO-1-modified proteins display altered subcellular targeting and/or stability. 
We have purified the SUMO-1-activating enzyme from human cells and shown that it 
contains two subunits of 38 and 72 kDa. Isolation of cDNAs for each subunit 
indicates that they are homologous to ubiquitin-activating enzymes and to the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzymes responsible for conjugation of Smt3p and 
Rub-1p. In vitro, recombinant SAE1/SAE2 (SUMO-1-activating enzyme) was capable 
of catalyzing the ATP-dependent formation of a thioester linkage between SUMO-1 
and SAE2. The addition of the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubch9 resulted in 
efficient transfer of the thioester-linked SUMO-1 from SAE2 to Ubch9. In the 
presence of SAE1/SAE2, Ubch9, and ATP, SUMO-1 was efficiently conjugated to the 
protein substrate IkappaBalpha. As SAE1/SAE2, Ubch9, SUMO-1, and IkappaBalpha 
are all homogeneous, recombinant proteins, it appears that SUMO-1 conjugation of 
IkappaBalpha in vitro does not require the equivalent of an E3 ubiquitin protein 
ligase activity.
