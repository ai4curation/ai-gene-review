The calnexin homologue (Cne1p) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was expressed in 
Escherichia coli to evaluate its chaperone function. The chaperone function was 
examined as to the effects on the suppression of thermal denaturation and the 
enhancement of refolding, using citrate synthase (CS) as a nonspecific chaperone 
substrate. Cne1p effectively suppressed the thermal denaturation of CS and 
enhanced the refolding of thermally or chemically denatured CS in a 
concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the chaperone function of Cne1p was 
greatly affected in the presence of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides (G1M9) 
that specifically bind to the lectin site. These results indicated that Cne1p 
functions as a molecular chaperone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
