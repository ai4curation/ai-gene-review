Mitochondria consist of four compartments-outer membrane, intermembrane space, 
inner membrane, and matrix--with crucial but distinct functions for numerous 
cellular processes. A comprehensive characterization of the proteome of an 
individual mitochondrial compartment has not been reported so far. We used a 
eukaryotic model organism, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to determine the 
proteome of highly purified mitochondrial outer membranes. We obtained a 
coverage of approximately 85% based on the known outer membrane proteins. The 
proteome represents a rich source for the analysis of new functions of the outer 
membrane, including the yeast homologue (Hfd1/Ymr110c) of the human protein 
causing Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. Surprisingly, a subclass of proteins known to 
reside in internal mitochondrial compartments were found in the outer membrane 
proteome. These seemingly mislocalized proteins included most top scorers of a 
recent genome-wide analysis for mRNAs that were targeted to mitochondria and 
coded for proteins of prokaryotic origin. Together with the enrichment of the 
precursor form of a matrix protein in the outer membrane, we conclude that the 
mitochondrial outer membrane not only contains resident proteins but also 
accumulates a conserved subclass of preproteins destined for internal 
mitochondrial compartments.
