To systematically investigate innate immune signaling networks regulating 
production of type I interferon, we analyzed protein complexes formed after 
microbial recognition. Fifty-eight baits were associated with 260 interacting 
proteins forming a human innate immunity interactome for type I interferon (HI5) 
of 401 unique interactions; 21% of interactions were modulated by RNA, DNA, or 
LPS. Overexpression and depletion analyses identified 22 unique genes that 
regulated NF-κB and ISRE reporter activity, viral replication, or virus-induced 
interferon production. Detailed mechanistic analysis defined a role for mind 
bomb (MIB) E3 ligases in K63-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, a kinase that 
phosphorylates IRF transcription factors controlling interferon production. Mib 
genes selectively controlled responses to cytosolic RNA. MIB deficiency reduced 
antiviral activity, establishing the role of MIB proteins as positive regulators 
of antiviral responses. The HI5 provides a dynamic physical and regulatory 
network that serves as a resource for mechanistic analysis of innate immune 
signaling.

INTRODUCTION

The innate immune system is genetically programmed for detection of invading pathogens. Host recognition of conserved microbial products depends on germline-encoded receptors, collectively termed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The tailoring of innate responses is mediated through different sets of PRRs including the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize extracellular microbial by-products, and the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which sense infection in the cytosolic compartment ( Takeuchi and Akira, 2010 ; Wilkins and Gale, 2010 ). Detection of microbial components by TLRs and RLRs activates signaling cascades, leading to production of antimicrobial cytokines.

Different TLRs recognize distinct ligands. For example, TLR3 senses microbial nucleic acids whereas TLR4 can recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and viral coat proteins. Signaling through TLR3 and TLR4 activate TBK1 kinase activity and induce production of potent antimicrobial cytokines including type I interferons (IFN). However, TLRs have a restricted tissue distribution with expression generally limited to immunocytes. RLRs sense viral RNAs in the cytoplasm of nearly all cell types ( Gitlin et al., 2006 ; Kato et al., 2005 , 2006 ; Yoneyama et al., 2004 ). Activation of RLRs engages the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS (also termed IPS-1, VISA, and Cardif), which recruits TBK1, leading to phosphorylation of the IRF3 transcription factor ( Kawai et al., 2005 ; Meylan et al., 2005 ; Seth et al., 2005 ; Xu et al., 2005 ). Once phosphorylated, IRF3 helps drive IFN expression ( Sharma et al., 2003 ). Infection with DNA viruses or transfection with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) also leads to TBK1 activation and IFN production through a series of still poorly defined DNA sensors and adaptors. Thus, the signaling pathways for TLR3, TLR4, RIG-I, MDA5, and DNA sensors converge at the level of TBK1 activation ( Fitzgerald et al., 2003 ; Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006 ; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010 ). Because excessive or prolonged cytokine production leads to inflammation and tissue damage, IFN responses are strictly regulated to avoid pathologic consequences including autoimmunity.

To systematically explore the signal transduction pathways responsible for regulating cellular antiviral defense and IFN production, we initiated a global proteomic analysis of the human innate immunity interactome for type I interferon (HI5). We followed the dynamic changes in protein-protein interactions resulting from encounter with ligand. Analysis of 58 HI5-associated baits revealed connections with 260 proteins forming a framework of 401 protein interactions. Some of these interactions represent signaling modules that may participate in assembly, recruitment, and activation or disruption of the IFN signaling circuit. Functional studies demonstrated the biologic activity of 22 proteins in the HI5. Detailed mechanistic analysis defined the role of the E3 ligases mind bomb 1 and 2 (MIB1 and MIB2) in response to RNA viruses. MIBs are responsible for TBK1 K63-linked ubiquitination, promoting IFN production and controlling antiviral immunity.

All cells have basic defenses against infection. We performed a systematic proteomic analysis to discover unique molecules capable of regulating innate antiviral responses. More than 20% of the protein interactions were up- or downregulated after stimulation with microbial byproducts, demonstrating dynamic remodeling of the interactome. Functional analyses identified 22 molecules that modulated IFN expression and antiviral activity. The HI5 network integrates candidate genes into a dynamic antimicrobial network and serves as a resource for mechanistic analysis of innate immune signaling.

DISCUSSION

Here we have constructed a comprehensive map describing the dynamic physical and functional protein interactions regulating innate immunity. This architectural representation of the HI5 may help unravel the multitiered signaling mechanisms underlying the innate responses and connect innate immunity to other cellular pathways. We assembled a map of 401 unique interactions between 58 baits and 260 HCIP. As with any screening approach, the database does not represent a complete interaction network and the absence of some known interactors illustrates the limitations of this technology (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ). Many of the hits identified in this screen require additional validation by more directed experiments. The regulatory responses of genes in the HI5 were also detailed by transcriptional profiling of macrophages exposed to virus, viral RNA and DNA mimics, LPS, or IFN. Furthermore, to examine HCIP activity, we assessed the gain- and loss-of function effects in eight independent assays in HEK293 and THP-1 cells and identified 22 genes that functionally regulate NF-κB and ISRE reporter activity, VSV replication, or Sendai virus- and HSV-induced IFN production. Finally, detailed mechanistic analysis of MIB proteins established their roles in regulation of innate immunity to RNA viruses.

MIB proteins were shown here to physically interact with TBK1. They selectively participate in ubiquitination of TBK1 after stimulation with dsRNA or RNA viruses. MIBs are best known for their role in the Notch pathway, an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction cascade that plays an essential role in organ formation and other developmental processes in flies, fish, and mammals ( Itoh et al., 2003 ). Mice lacking MIB1 die during early embryogenesis with defects in neurogenesis and vasculogenesis resulting from the failure to activate Notch signaling ( Koo et al., 2005a ). MIB1 is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in both embryo and adult tissues, whereas MIB2 is primarily found in some adult tissues ( Koo et al., 2005b ). Consequently, MIB2-deficient mice do not share the same developmental defects noted for MIB1-deficient animals ( Koo et al., 2007 ; Wu et al., 2007 ).

A recent report identified Nrdp1 as an E3 ligase involved in LPS-induced TBK1 ubiquitination ( Wang et al., 2009 ). Nrdp1 is selectively expressed in mouse hematopoietic cells and was not detectable in other cells ( Abdullah et al., 2001 ). Cell-autonomous defense against infection with viruses is a fundamental process affecting all cell types. MIB1 is ubiquitously expressed ( Song et al., 2008 ) and may play a central role in innate defense against RNA viruses in all tissues. However, there is no evidence that MIBs participate in responses to LPS, dsDNA, or DNA virus, suggesting that these stimuli trigger alternate pathways to TBK1 activation. We provide genetic evidence to underscore the role of MIB proteins in TBK1 ubiquitination in response to dsRNA and RNA viruses, in both MEFs and macrophages. The data indicate that MIBs selectively control responses to cytosolic RNA and regulate type I interferon transcription.

IFN transcriptional activation is regulated by the cooperative assembly of the IRF3 and NF-κB transcription factors ( Panne et al., 2007 ). Although we demonstrate that overexpression of MIB1 and MIB2 activates both NF-κB and IRF3 signaling, with RNAi we noted that MIBs were not required for NF-κB activation or IL-6 production in response to RNA virus. Similarly, it has been shown that TBK1 is not essential for NF-κB activation induced by virus although overexpression of TBK1 strongly activates NF-κB signaling ( Perry et al., 2004 ). Thus, it is possible that over-expression of MIBs activates TBK1, which in turn elicits NF-κB signaling.

Through proteomic analysis of TBK1 and IKKε complexes, we found that IKKε but not TBK1 can directly associate with MAVS ( Figure S2 ), suggesting that MAVS may use different mechanisms to activate IKKε. Silencing MIB1 in HEK293 cells inhibits TBK1-induced ISRE reporter activity but not IKKε-induced ISRE reporter activity. Further studies are required to define the molecular requirements for IKKε-mediated signal transduction, but these data are consistent with the hypothesis that TBK1 and IKKε utilize different signaling cascades ( Paz et al., 2009 ).

K63-linked ubiquitination plays an essential role in transmitting signals required for activation of innate antiviral responses ( Bhoj and Chen, 2009 ). The TRIM25 and TRIM56 E3 ligases target upstream elements in the IFN pathway ( Gack et al., 2007 ; Tsuchida et al., 2010 ). TBK1 K63-linked ubiquitination may link NEMO to TBK1. NEMO was shown to be critical for IFN production in response to dsRNA ( Zeng et al., 2009 ; Zhao et al., 2007 ). Proteomic analysis of NEMO complexes demonstrated inducible interactions with both TBK1 and MAVS after poly(rI:rC) stimulation ( Figures S2 and S3B ). NEMO has two ubiquitin binding domains (UBD) and both are required for IRF3 activation ( Zeng et al., 2009 ). These two independent UBD potentially allow NEMO to bridge TBK1 with other ubiquitinated components of the signalosome.

Computational analyses allowed us to integrate several candidate genes into a dynamic antiviral innate immune network. This network covers several processes including RNA and DNA sensing, TLR4 engagement, activation of NF-κB, IRF and STAT transcription factors, translation, transcription, apoptosis and ER stress, RNA interference, autophagy, and trafficking ( Figure 7 ). At least four proteins (CALCOCO2, ATG7, ATG9A, and RB1CC1) appear to connect the HI5 to autophagy. SARM1 associates with NLRX1 on mitochondria where they may regulate IFN production ( Carty et al., 2006 ) and oxidative stress ( Tattoli et al., 2008 ). Their binding partners, GHITM and SPNS1, have been reported to regulate apoptosis ( Oka et al., 2008 ; Yanagisawa et al., 2003 ). Similarly, BAT3 and SGPL1 also regulate cell apoptosis ( Colié et al., 2010 ; Tsukahara et al., 2009 ). These protein interactions suggest links between innate antiviral responses and autophagy, cell stress, and apoptosis.

Recently, LGP2 was shown to support both RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated antiviral responses ( Satoh et al., 2010 ). We found that LGP2 associated with PKR and this combination interacted with six common proteins including DICER1. However, Dicer1 -deficient mouse cells do not have a generalized defect in IFN transcription ( Otsuka et al., 2007 ). Crosstalk between LGP2 and PKR with the RNAi pathway needs further study because it represents a potential mechanism for processing viral RNA prior to RLR recognition. In addition, two PKR binding proteins, MOV10 and DHX9, were found to regulate VSV replication and Sendai-mediated IFN production, respectively, but the mechanisms underlying this activity are unknown.

Several cytosolic DNA sensors have been identified but little is known about how DNA recognition signals IFN transcription. Genetic deficiency of a DNA sensor termed DAI suggests that it is dispensable for DNA-induced IFN production and implies that other DNA sensors exist ( Ishii et al., 2008 ; Takaoka et al., 2007 ). Additional DNA receptors including DHX9 and IFI16 have recently been identified but both are cell type specific ( Kim et al., 2010 ; Unterholzner et al., 2010 ). Recent studies also showed that poly(dA:dT) induces RNA polymerase III-dependent innate immune responses that activate the RIG-I/MAVS signaling axis. However, in primary cells, dsDNA induces innate immune responses independently of MAVS ( Ablasser et al., 2009 ; Chiu et al., 2009 ). Our analysis of DAI complexes indicated that DAI associates with a transcriptional repressor complex containing CtBP1 and CtBP2. RNAi of CtBP1 and CtBP2 compensated for HSV-induced IFN production ( Figure 5E ). Whether these corepressors inhibit viral or host DNA transcription needs further investigation. Another DAI binding protein, PALADIN, was found to interact with TLR9 and IRF7. PALADIN contains a protein tyrosine phosphatase domain and negatively regulates insulin signaling ( Huang et al., 2009 ). PALADIN mRNA levels are upregulated after HSV infection ( Figure 2C ). Silencing of PALADIN enhanced HSV-induced IFN-β production ( Figure 5C ), suggesting that PALADIN negatively regulates a pathway controlling responses to DNA viruses.

Recently, STING (also known as MITA or MPYS) has been shown to regulate DNA-mediated IFN transcription ( Ishikawa and Barber, 2008 ). SEC61A, a central component of the protein translocation apparatus in the ER, is associated with STING, suggesting potential crosstalk with translocation functions. It was reported that ATG9A interacted with STING and inhibited its association with TBK1 ( Saitoh et al., 2009 ). We found that poly(dA:dT) induced an association between TBK1 and ATG9A. Furthermore, we found that STING and UNC93B1 interacted with 10 common binding partners and most of them are ER membrane proteins involved in protein translocation. Among them, SURF4 overexpression activated NF-κB reporter activity and inhibited VSV replication whereas RNAi of NPC1 inhibited HSV-mediated IFN production.

We also found that the TBK1 binding protein α-taxilin (TXLNA) was required for HSV-induced IFN production. The taxilin family consists of three members that share an extraordinarily long coiled-coil region ( Nogami et al., 2004 ). TXLNA interacts with the nascent polypeptide-associated complex and coactivator alpha (NACA) transcriptional coactivator ( Yoshida et al., 2005 ). Because NACA has DNA-binding ability ( Akhouayri et al., 2005 ), it may sense DNA in the cytoplasm and transduce signals to TXLNA. This hypothesis is currently under investigation in our laboratory.

Several proteins in the HI5 were found to associate with IRF transcriptional regulators. EAP1, FOXK1, and FOXK2 bind IRF2 and negatively regulate Sendai virus-induced IFN production. IKBKAP interacts with IRF4 and negatively regulates HSV-induced IFN production. In addition to transcriptional regulation, several HCIP may regulate translation of viral and/or host proteins. TRMT61B is a tRNA methyltransferase regulating RNA translation. Gene targeting of TRMT61B severely impaired VSV replication ability. Thus, mapping the molecular circuits of the HI5 can be a valuable tool for understanding the connections between innate immunity and other cell processes.

The HI5 is a resource for the study of molecular mechanisms controlling innate immune responses. Dynamic remodeling of the HI5 occurs after perturbation with ligand. The genes identified by these proteomic approaches offer potential for therapeutic intervention of infectious and autoimmune diseases.
