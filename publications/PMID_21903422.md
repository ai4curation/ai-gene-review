To systematically investigate innate immune signaling networks regulating 
production of type I interferon, we analyzed protein complexes formed after 
microbial recognition. Fifty-eight baits were associated with 260 interacting 
proteins forming a human innate immunity interactome for type I interferon (HI5) 
of 401 unique interactions; 21% of interactions were modulated by RNA, DNA, or 
LPS. Overexpression and depletion analyses identified 22 unique genes that 
regulated NF-κB and ISRE reporter activity, viral replication, or virus-induced 
interferon production. Detailed mechanistic analysis defined a role for mind 
bomb (MIB) E3 ligases in K63-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, a kinase that 
phosphorylates IRF transcription factors controlling interferon production. Mib 
genes selectively controlled responses to cytosolic RNA. MIB deficiency reduced 
antiviral activity, establishing the role of MIB proteins as positive regulators 
of antiviral responses. The HI5 provides a dynamic physical and regulatory 
network that serves as a resource for mechanistic analysis of innate immune 
signaling.
