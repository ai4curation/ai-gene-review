Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], which has been shown to interact with fibrin(ogen) and 
other components of the blood clotting cascade, is a major independent risk 
factor for atherothrombotic disease in humans. The physiological function(s) of 
Lp(a), as well as the precise mechanism(s) by which high plasma levels of Lp(a) 
increase risk are unknown. Identification of further potential apo(a)-protein 
ligands may be crucial to illuminate apo(a)'s function(s) and pathophysiological 
properties. We used the repetitive apo(a) kringle IV type 2, which is variable 
in number in apo(a), to screen a human liver cDNA library by the yeast 
two-hybrid interaction trap system. Among 11 positive clones that emerged from 
the screen, eight clones were identified as beta-2 glycoprotein I and one as 
fibronectin. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that beta-2 
glycoprotein I and apo(a)/Lp(a) interact in human plasma and in cell culture 
supernatants of COS-1 cells, which ectopically expressed apo(a). The 
apo(a)-beta2-glycoprotein I interaction indicates new potential roles for Lp(a) 
in fibrinolysis and autoimmunity.
