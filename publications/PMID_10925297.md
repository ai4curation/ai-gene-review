Neutrophil adhesion is fundamentally important during the onset of inflammatory 
responses. The adhesion signaling pathways control neutrophil arrest and 
extravasation and influence neutrophil shape and function at sites of 
inflammation. In the present study the intracellular signaling pathways for the 
adhesion of human neutrophils by pituitary growth hormone (GH) were examined. 
Pituitary GH triggered the tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and 
STAT3 in neutrophils. In addition, pituitary GH treatment resulted in the 
morphological changes and the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase 
(p125FAK) and paxillin. Preincubation with genistein, a tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor, blocked the GH-stimulated adhesion and Jak2, STAT3, p125FAK, and 
paxillin phosphorylation. Confocal microscopy revealed that pituitary GH 
stimulates the focal localization of p125FAK, paxillin, phosphotyrosine, and 
filamentous actin filament into the membrane rufflings and uropods of human 
neutrophils. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a physical association of 
Jak2 with p125FAK via STAT3 in vivo. Also an in vitro kinase assay showed an 
augmentation of p125FAK autophosphorylation as a result of pituitary GH 
treatment. These results suggest that pituitary GH modulates neutrophil adhesion 
through tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, p125FAK, and paxillin and actin 
polymerization.
