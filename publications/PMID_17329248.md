Phosphodiesterase type 2A (PDE2A) hydrolyzes cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP, 
thus efficiently controlling cNMP-dependent signaling pathways. PDE2A is 
composed of an amino-terminal region, two regulatory GAF domains, and a 
catalytic domain. Cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis is known to be activated by cGMP 
binding to GAF-B; however, other mechanisms may operate to fine-tune local 
cyclic nucleotide levels. In a yeast two-hybrid screening we identified XAP2, a 
crucial component of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) complex, as a major 
PDE2A-interacting protein. We mapped the XAP2 binding site to the GAF-B domain 
of PDE2A. PDE assays with purified proteins showed that XAP2 binding does not 
change the enzymatic activity of PDE2A. To analyze whether PDE2A could affect 
the function of XAP2, we studied nuclear translocation of AhR, i.e. the master 
transcription factor controlling the expression of multiple detoxification 
genes. Notably, regulation of AhR target gene expression is initiated by 
tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) binding to AhR and by a poorly understood 
cAMP-dependent pathway followed by the translocation of AhR from the cytosol 
into the nucleus. Binding of PDE2A to XAP2 inhibited TCDD- and cAMP-induced 
nuclear translocation of AhR in Hepa1c1c7 hepatocytes. Furthermore, PDE2A 
attenuated TCDD-induced transcription in reporter gene assays. We conclude that 
XAP2 targets PDE2A to the AhR complex, thereby restricting AhR mobility, 
possibly by a local reduction of cAMP levels. Our results provide first insights 
into the elusive cAMP-dependent regulation of AhR.
