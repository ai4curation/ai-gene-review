Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1/THBS1) plays a major role in the pathophysiology of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, its interface with the cytokine network 
involved in RA has not been delineated. Correlations were performed between 
plasma levels of TSP1 and selected cytokines from blood samples collected from 
20 patients affected by RA and 13 healthy donors (control). Plasma levels of 
TSP1 and tissue growth factor beta (TGFbeta) were determined by standard 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cytokines were measured by protein 
profiling rolling-circle amplification (RCA). TSP1 circulating levels in plasma 
were found significantly increased in the RA patients when compared with control 
individuals (P = 0.039). The plasma levels of TGFbeta were also increased in the 
RA patients, which indicates a statistical trend. Cytokine levels of interleukin 
(IL)-4, IL-5, IL-12, chemokine CXC 10 (CXCL10/IP10), and chemokine CC 4 
(CCL4)/MIP1beta were significantly increased in the RA patients when compared 
with the control group. In summary, this study demonstrates increased plasma 
levels of TSP1, which correlated with increased levels of proinflammatory 
cytokines in plasma of RA patients. More detailed research is required to 
explore the cytokine imprint yielded by this study and its interface with TSP1 
and TGFbeta.

INTRODUCTION

The pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been extensively studied and multiple factors have been implicated in the onset and perpetuation of the disease. 1 The molecules that had been identified to date include but are not limited to cytokines and growth factors. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is one of the proteins involved in RA. 2 – 6 TSP1 is a multifunctional glycoprotein present in multiple cells including platelets, leukocytes and endothelial cells. 7 TSP1 promotes thrombin generation on the cellular surface of leukocytes with a subsequent action on endothelial cells that upregulates the expression of TSP1. In addition, TSP1 is an effective activator of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ). 8 TGFβ is a pleiotropic immunoregulatory cytokine found up-regulated in RA. 5 Even though TGFβ is considered as an anti-inflammatory molecule, in some pathologic conditions TGFβ may act as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. 9 In RA in particular, elevated TGFβ levels in plasma and synovial fluid have been reported, 10 however its role in this disease remains obscure.

This study determined the signature expression pattern in the cytokine network and its potential interface with TSP1 and TGFβ in RA by the use of protein profiling rolling- circle amplification (RCA). RCA is a useful alternative to measure multiple cytokine levels utilizing a single small sample volume of 50 µL. Among the advantages of the RCA method is that is more sensitive and specific when compared to conventional ELISA techniques. The specificity of the technique is due to its principle in which amplified signals remain localized at each of the microarray spots. Global patterns of cytokine expression are more likely to yield biological relevance and clinically useful information than assays of a single cytokine.
