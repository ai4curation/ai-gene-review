Urea is highly concentrated in the mammalian kidney to produce the osmotic 
gradient necessary for water re-absorption. Free diffusion of urea across cell 
membranes is slow owing to its high polarity, and specialized urea transporters 
have evolved to achieve rapid and selective urea permeation. Here we present the 
2.3 A structure of a functional urea transporter from the bacterium 
Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The transporter is a homotrimer, and each subunit 
contains a continuous membrane-spanning pore formed by the two homologous halves 
of the protein. The pore contains a constricted selectivity filter that can 
accommodate several dehydrated urea molecules in single file. Backbone and 
side-chain oxygen atoms provide continuous coordination of urea as it progresses 
through the filter, and well-placed alpha-helix dipoles provide further 
compensation for dehydration energy. These results establish that the urea 
transporter operates by a channel-like mechanism and reveal the physical and 
chemical basis of urea selectivity.

Abstract

Urea is highly concentrated in mammalian kidney to produce the osmotic gradient necessary for water re-absorption. Free diffusion of urea across cell membranes is slow due to its high polarity, and specialized urea transporters have evolved to achieve rapid and selective urea permeation. Here we present the 2.3 Å structure of a functional urea transporter from the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris . The transporter is a homotrimer, and each subunit contains a continuous membrane-spanning pore formed by the two homologous halves of the protein. The pore contains a constricted selectivity filter that can accommodate multiple dehydrated urea molecules in single file. Backbone and side chain oxygen atoms provide continuous coordination of urea as it progresses through the filter, and well-placed α-helix dipoles provide additional compensation for dehydration energy. These results establish that the urea transporter operates by a channel-like mechanism and reveal the physical and chemical basis of urea selectivity.

Methods Summary

An N-terminal His-tagged SUMO-dvUT fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified on a cobalt affinity column. After cleavage of the affinity tag and SUMO domain with SUMO protease and a second round of chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column, the protein was concentrated to ~8 mg/mL in buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 40 mM n-octyl-β-D-maltoside. Crystals were obtained by sitting-drop vapour diffusion in mother liquor containing 22% PEG1500, 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 10 mM thiomersal or KAu(CN) 2 . A 2.5 Å mercury-derivatized and a 2.3 Å gold-derivatized dataset were collected on beamlines X25 and X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The mercury dataset was used for location of heavy atom sites and SAD phasing. After density modification and automated and manual model building, the resulting partial structure was used as a molecular replacement model for the gold dataset. Iterative rounds of building and refinement produced a final model with 330 out of 337 residues resolved and R and R-free values of 17.9 and 20.4%. High resolution DMU-dvUT crystals were obtained by co-crystallizing the protein with 10 mM DMU as well as KAu(CN) 2 , and the 2.4 Å ligand-bound structure was solved by molecular replacement. For the SPA binding assays, 100 μL of 2.5 mg/mL Cu 2+ -coated YSi SPA beads (GE # RPNQ00096), 181 μM 14 C-urea (55mCi/mmol), 50–250 ng dvUT, and appropriate concentrations of cold urea or DMU were combined per assay in clear bottomed/while-wall 96-well plates in buffer containing 150 mM Tris/Mes, pH 7.5, with 50 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM). Reactions performed in the presence of 400 mM imidazole served as negative controls for all conditions tested.
