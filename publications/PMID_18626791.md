Regulation of cell division requires the concerted function of proteins and 
protein complexes that properly mediate cytoskeletal dynamics. NudC is an 
evolutionarily conserved protein of undetermined function that associates with 
microtubules and interacts with several key regulators of mitosis, such as 
polo-kinase 1 (Plk1) and dynein. NudC is essential for proper mitotic 
progression, and homologs have been identified in species ranging from fungi to 
humans. In this paper, we report the characterization of the Caenorhabditis 
elegans NudC homolog, NUD-1, as a protein exhibiting molecular chaperone 
activity. All NudC/NUD-1 proteins share a conserved p23/HSP20 domain predicted 
by three-dimensional modeling [Garcia-Ranea, Mirey, Camonis, Valencia, FEBS Lett 
529(2-3):162-167, 2002]. We demonstrate that nematode NUD-1 is able to prevent 
the aggregation of two substrate proteins, citrate synthase (CS) and luciferase, 
at stoichiometric concentrations. Further, NUD-1 also protects the native state 
of CS from thermal inactivation by significantly reducing the inactivation rate 
of this enzyme. To further determine if NUD-1/substrate complexes were 
productive or simply "dead-end" unfolding intermediates, a luciferase refolding 
assay was utilized. Following thermal denaturation, rabbit reticulocyte lysate 
and ATP were added and luciferase activity measured. In the presence of NUD-1, 
nearly all of the luciferase activity was regained, indicating that unfolded 
intermediates complexed with NUD-1 could be refolded. These studies represent 
the first functional evidence for a member of this mitotically essential protein 
family as having chaperone activity and facilitates elucidation of the role such 
proteins play in chaperone complexes utilized in cell division. C. elegans NUD-1 
is a member of an evolutionary conserved protein family of unknown function 
involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. NUD-1 and its mammalian 
homolog, NudC, function with the dynein motor complex to ensure proper cell 
division, and knockdown or overexpression of these proteins leads to disruption 
of mitosis. In this paper, we show that NUD-1 possesses ATP-independent 
chaperone activity comparable to that of small heat shock proteins and 
cochaperones and that changes in phosphorylation state functionally alter 
chaperone activity in a phosphomimetic NUD-1 mutant.
