Dynamic interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and specific proteins are 
crucial for changes in cell shape and motility. Here we describe a novel protein 
MSAP (MIR-interacting saposin-like protein) that is a positive regulator of 
neurite outgrowth. MSAP is expressed in different tissues, including brain, and 
has an apparent molecular weight of 21 kDa. MSAP interacts with the 
ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-like myosin regulatory light chain-interacting 
protein (MIR), and the two proteins are co-localized in cell lines and in 
primary neurons. Overexpression of MSAP enhances neurite out-growth in 
neuroblastoma and PC12 cells, whereas down-regulation of MSAP using RNA 
silencing led to inhibition of neurite formation. The stimulation of neurite 
outgrowth by MSAP was abrogated by the overexpression of MIR, which induced a 
decrease in the levels of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC). This reduction 
in MRLC by MIR was inhibited by blocking the activity of proteasome and by 
overexpression of MSAP, suggesting an effect on protein stability. Evidence was 
obtained that MIR decreases MRLC by inducing its ubiquitination. The results 
show that the levels of MRLC are controlled by MIR via ubiquitination and that 
the effect of MIR on MRLC is counteracted in the presence of MSAP. MSAP can 
stabilize MRLC and thus bring about an increase in neurite outgrowth.
