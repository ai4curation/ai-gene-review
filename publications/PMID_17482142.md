Pathways adopted by developing cancer cells for evasion of cellular surveillance 
mechanism deserve attention for therapeutic exploitation as well as for better 
prognosis. A novel mitotic kinase, PDZ-binding kinase or PBK, which is 
upregulated in a variety of neoplasms including hematological malignancies, has 
been the focus of our attention with a goal to understand its role in malignant 
conversion and to examine as a possible new therapeutic target in disparate 
types of cancer. Earlier, we reported that PBK expression was downregulated 
during macrophage differentiation of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, during 
doxorubicin-induced growth arrest in G2/M phase and that PBK was regulated by 
cell cycle-specific transcription factors E2F and CREB/ATF. Here, we demonstrate 
that HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells become adapted to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage 
checkpoint upon ectopic expression of a phosphomimetic mutant of PBK as 
indicated by the accumulation of polyploid cells. Aberrant entry into the 
mitotic phase by these cells is suggested by the appearance of a mitotic 
phase-specific marker, MPM-2. We propose that the effect is due to 
downregulation of p53 caused by direct physical interaction with PBK as detected 
by both a biochemical means as well as by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Together, 
our studies provide a plausible explanation for the role of PBK augmenting tumor 
cell growth following transient appearance in different types of progenitor 
cells in vivo as reported.
