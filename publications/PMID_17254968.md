Like apoptosis, oncogene-induced senescence is a barrier to tumor development. 
However, relatively little is known about the signaling pathways mediating the 
senescence response. p38-regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK) is a p38 MAPK 
substrate whose physiological functions are poorly understood. Here we describe 
a role for PRAK in tumor suppression by demonstrating that PRAK mediates 
senescence upon activation by p38 in response to oncogenic ras. PRAK deficiency 
in mice enhances DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis, coinciding with compromised 
senescence induction. In primary cells, inactivation of PRAK prevents senescence 
and promotes oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, we show that PRAK activates 
p53 by direct phosphorylation. We propose that phosphorylation of p53 by PRAK 
following activation of p38 MAPK by ras plays an important role in ras-induced 
senescence and tumor suppression.
