Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of heart failure, characterized by 
ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction. Familial DCM is reportedly 
caused by mutations in more than 50 genes, requiring precise disease 
stratification based on genetic information. However, the underlying genetic 
causes of 60 to 80% of familial DCM cases remain unknown. Here, we identified 
that homozygous truncating mutations in the gene encoding Bcl-2–associated 
athanogene (BAG) co-chaperone 5 (BAG5) caused inherited DCM in five patients 
among four unrelated families with complete penetrance. BAG5 acts as a 
nucleotide exchange factor for heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70), 
promoting adenosine diphosphate release and activating HSC70-mediated protein 
folding. Bag5 mutant knock-in mice exhibited ventricular dilatation, 
arrhythmogenicity, and poor prognosis under catecholamine stimulation, 
recapitulating the human DCM phenotype, and administration of an 
adeno-associated virus 9 vector carrying the wild-type BAG5 gene could fully 
ameliorate these DCM phenotypes. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that BAG5 
localized to junctional membrane complexes (JMCs), critical microdomains for 
calcium handling. Bag5-mutant mouse cardiomyocytes exhibited decreased abundance 
of functional JMC proteins under catecholamine stimulation, disrupted JMC 
structure, and calcium handling abnormalities. We also identified heterozygous 
truncating mutations in three patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, 
a reversible DCM subtype associated with abnormal calcium homeostasis. Our study 
suggests that loss-of-function mutations in BAG5 can cause DCM, that BAG5 may be 
a target for genetic testing in cases of DCM, and that gene therapy may 
potentially be a treatment for this disease.
