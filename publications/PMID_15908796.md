The phosphatase CDC25B is one of the key regulators that control entry into 
mitosis through the dephosphorylation and subsequent activation of the 
cyclin-dependent kinases. Here we study the phosphorylation of CDC25B at mitosis 
by the kinase pEg3, a member of the KIN1/PAR-1/MARK family. Using mass 
spectrometry analysis we demonstrate that CDC25B is phosphorylated in vitro by 
pEg3 on serine 169, a residue that lies within the B domain. Moreover, using 
phosphoepitope-specific antibodies we show that serine 169 is phosphorylated in 
vivo, that this phosphorylated form of CDC25B accumulates during mitosis, and is 
localized to the centrosomes. This labelling is abrogated when pEg3 expression 
is repressed by RNA interference. Taken together, these results support a model 
in which pEg3 contributes to the control of progression through mitosis by 
phosphorylation of the CDC25 phosphatases.
