Exit from mitosis requires the degradation of regulatory proteins including the 
mitotic cyclins and securin through ubiquitination by the anaphase promoting 
complex (APC) bound to Cdc20 or Cdh1. Cdc20-APC is regulated through inhibition 
by the spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2. Knowledge of Cdh1-APC 
regulation is limited to the phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of Cdh1 from 
APC. We report a novel means of regulating Cdh1 by the MAD2-related gene, 
MAD2L2. MAD2L2 specifically binds and inhibits Cdh1-APC, paralleling the effect 
of MAD2 on Cdc20. We suggest that MAD2L2 and MAD2 inhibit the release of 
substrates from APC and propose a mechanism of inhibition.
