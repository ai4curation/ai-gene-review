The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha are structurally 
similar as regards their DNA-binding and dimerization domains, but differ in 
their transactivation domains and, as is shown by experiments using hif-1 
alpha(-/-) and hif-2 alpha(-/-) mice, in their functions. This implies that 
HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha may have unique target genes. To address this 
discrepancy and identify HIF-2 alpha-specific target genes, we performed yeast 
two-hybrid analysis and identified the tumor suppressor Int6/eIF3e/p48 as a 
novel target gene product involved in HIF-2 alpha regulation. The int6 gene was 
first identified from a screen in which the mouse mammary tumor virus was 
employed as an insertional mutagen to identify genes whose functions are 
critical for breast tumor formation. Here, by using two-hybrid analysis, 
immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells, and HRE-reporter assays, we report the 
specific interaction of HIF-2 alpha (but not HIF-1 alpha or HIF-3 alpha) with 
Int6. The results indicate that the direct interaction of Int6 induces 
proteasome inhibitor-sensitive HIF-2 alpha degradation. This degradation was 
clearly observed in renal cell carcinoma 786-O cells, and was found to be both 
hypoxia- and pVHL-independent. Furthermore, Int6 protein knockdown by int6-siRNA 
vectors or the dominant-negative mutant Int6-Delta C increased endogenous HIF-2 
alpha expression, even under normoxia, and induced sets of critical angiogenic 
factors comprising vascular endoplasmic growth factor, angiopoietin, and basic 
fibroblast growth factor mRNA. These results indicate that Int6 is a novel and 
critical determinant of HIF-2 alpha-dependent angiogenesis as well as cancer 
formation, and that int6-siRNA transfer may be an effective therapeutic strategy 
in pathological conditions such as heart and brain ischemia, hepatic cirrhosis, 
and obstructive vessel diseases.
