Oscillating cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity is the major regulator of 
cell-cycle progression, whereas the Aurora B kinase, as part of the chromosome 
passenger complex (CPC), controls critical aspects of mitosis such as chromosome 
condensation and biorientation on the spindle. How these kinases mechanistically 
coordinate their important functions is only partially understood. Here, using 
budding yeast, we identify a regulatory mechanism by which the Cdk1 kinase Cdc28 
directly controls the Aurora kinase Ipl1. We show that Cdk1 phosphorylates Ipl1 
on two serine residues in the N-terminal domain, thereby suppressing its 
association with the microtubule plus-end tracking protein Bim1 until the onset 
of anaphase. Failure to phosphorylate Ipl1 leads to its premature targeting to 
the metaphase spindle and results in constitutive Bim1 phosphorylation, which is 
normally restricted to anaphase. Cells expressing an Ipl1-Sli15 complex that 
cannot be phosphorylated by Cdk1 display a severe growth defect. Our work shows 
that Ipl1/Aurora is not only the catalytic subunit of the CPC but also an 
important regulatory target that allows Cdk1 to coordinate chromosome 
biorientation with spindle morphogenesis.

Abstract

Cells coordinate diverse events at anaphase onset, including separase activation, cohesin cleavage, chromosome separation, and spindle reorganization. Regulation of the XMAP215 family member and microtubule polymerase, Stu2, at the metaphase-anaphase transition determines a redistribution from kinetochores to spindle microtubules. We show that cells modulate Stu2 kinetochore-microtubule localization by Polo-like kinase1/Cdc5-mediated phosphorylation of T866, near the Stu2 C-terminus, thereby promoting dissociation from the kinetochore Ndc80 complex. Cdk/Cdc28 likely primes Cdc5:Stu2 interaction. Cdc28 activity is also required for Stu2 nuclear import. PP2A Cdc55 actively opposes Cdc5 activity on Stu2 T866 during metaphase. This counter-regulation allows for switchlike redistribution of Stu2 pT866 at anaphase onset when separase inhibits PP2A Cdc55 . Blocking Stu2 T866 phosphorylation disrupts anaphase spindle progression, and we infer that PP2A Cdc55 regulates the mitotic spindle by dephosphorylating multiple MAPs, including Stu2. These data support a model in which increased phosphorylation at anaphase onset results from phosphatase inhibition and point to a larger regulatory network that facilitates rapid cytoskeletal modulation required for anaphase spindle function.

INTRODUCTION

Accurate chromosome segregation during cell division ensures equal partitioning of genetic information into daughter cells. Cells must therefore exert precise temporal control on the complex set of regulatory events that determine proper segregation. At anaphase onset in particular, cells must coordinate separase activation and subsequent removal of cohesin, chromosome movement, spindle reorganization, and preparation for cytokinesis ( De Gramont and Cohen-Fix, 2005 ). Multiple factors, including microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) and motor proteins, are also required during anaphase to maintain the integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton ( Goshima and Vale, 2003 ; Khmelinskii et al., 2007 ; Amin, Agarwal and Varma, 2019 ).

The XMAP215 family member and microtubule polymerase Stu2 is among the proteins that cells must regulate at anaphase onset. Stu2 is a MAP that is essential for proper chromosome segregation, performing multiple important roles in the cell. Stu2 binds to the plus ends of microtubules to regulate microtubule dynamics ( Kosco et al., 2001 ; van Breugel, Drechsel and Hyman, 2003 ; Al-Bassam et al., 2006 ; Ayaz et al., 2012 , 2014 ), but it also must localize to kinetochores through an interaction with the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c) to carry out functions essential for chromosome biorientation ( Hsu and Toda, 2011 ; Tang et al., 2013 ; Miller, Asbury and Biggins, 2016 ; Vasileva et al., 2017 ; Miller et al., 2019 ; Herman, Miller and Biggins, 2020 ; Zahm et al., 2021 ). It also has important functions at microtubule organizing centers to support microtubule nucleation ( Wang and Huffaker, 1997 ; Gunzelmann et al., 2018 ) and at the spindle midzone to promote anaphase spindle elongation ( Severin et al., 2001 ). This diversity of function requires dramatic relocalization of Stu2 during the cell cycle. Fluorescently labeled Stu2 shifts between various cellular locations, including kinetochores, microtubule tips, and the spindle midzone, as well as into and out of the nucleus at different cell cycle stages ( Usui et al., 2003 ; Ma et al., 2007 ; Van Der Vaart et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, photobleaching studies show changes in Stu2 dynamics at kinetochores-proximal puncta from metaphase to anaphase ( Aravamudhan et al., 2014 ). Understanding how cells alter Stu2’s activity and localization in the cell cycle is important for uncovering how it facilitates proper spindle maintenance and chromosome segregation, and how aneuploidy might result when these processes go awry.

Strict coordination with the cell cycle implicates phosphoregulation by cell-cycle kinases. We show here that phosphorylation by cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk/Cdc28 in yeast) of a conserved serine in Stu2’s nuclear localization signal (NLS) promotes nuclear import. Once in the nucleus, Stu2 associates with numerous factors, including the kinetochore. Stu2:kinetochore interaction is mediated through an interaction between Stu2’s C-terminal segment and the Ndc80c. At anaphase onset, phosphorylation of a conserved threonine near the C-terminus of Stu2 (Stu2 T866 ) reduces the amount of Stu2 bound to Ndc80c. We show that Stu2 T866 phosphorylation depends on Polo-like kinase (Cdc5 in yeast) and that phosphorylation of a conserved serine (Stu2 S603 ) in the basic-linker region of Stu2 primes it for Cdc5 interaction. Phosphorylation of Stu2 S603 is the same modification that promotes nuclear import, showing multiple functions for this region of Stu2’s basic linker. The phosphatase PP2A Cdc55 opposes Cdc5 modification of Stu2 T866 during metaphase and sets up proper timing of Stu2 T866 modification at anaphase onset. Phosphorylation of Stu2 T866 corresponds with relocalization of a pool of Stu2 from kinetochores to interpolar spindle microtubules. Blocking this modification leads to defects in anaphase spindle progression, and synthetic phenotypes with cellular spindle regulators, including IPL1, BIM1, and KAR3 . Constitutively mimicking phosphorylation of Stu2 T866 results in cell viability and chromosome segregation defects as well, highlighting the importance of dephosphorylation by PP2A Cdc55 .

Finally, Stu2 appears to be one component of a larger network of microtubule associated proteins that are regulated in a similar manner. Disrupting this entire network by blocking PP2A Cdc55 activity leads to spindle defects in metaphase and anaphase, indicating this phosphatase broadly regulates the microtubule cytoskeleton during mitosis. These findings illustrate an interconnected and likely conserved network of kinases and phosphatases that regulate Stu2 activity, along with many other factors, to ensure precise timing of the numerous events that unfold in rapid succession at anaphase onset.

DISCUSSION

The XMAP215 family member Stu2 has multiple cellular roles and functions at microtubule organizing centers, kinetochores, and microtubules during different points in the cell cycle ( van Breugel, Drechsel and Hyman, 2003 ; Al-Bassam et al., 2006 ; Hsu and Toda, 2011 ; Miller, Asbury and Biggins, 2016 ; Zahm et al., 2021 ). We have studied their regulation, including the import into the nucleus and modulation of kinetochore and microtubule localization. In particular, we have investigated how phosphorylation of Stu2 at two specific sites governs its subcellular activities. We find that Cdk/Cdc28 activity facilitates nuclear import of Stu2, through phosphorylation of Stu2 S603 in the nuclear localization sequence in Stu2’s basic linker. We further find that phosphorylation of a threonine in Stu2’s CTS (Stu2 T866 ) reduces association of Stu2 with Ndc80c. Stu2 T866 phosphorylation depends on the polo-like kinase, Cdc5, and Cdc28 phosphorylation of S603 primes the Stu2:Cdc5 interaction. PP2A Cdc55 opposes Stu2 T866 phosphorylation in metaphase. Upon inhibition by the newly activated separase, downregulation of PP2A Cdc55 ( Queralt et al., 2006 ) leads to rapid accumulation of phosphorylated Stu2 T866 at anaphase onset ( Fig. 8D ). Modification of this site allows cells to relocalize a pool of Stu2 to the spindle midzone during anaphase for maintenance of anaphase spindle function. This regulatory event is likely one of many modifications that the Cdc5-PP2A Cdc55 network catalyzes to elicit the rapid cytoskeletal changes required for entry into anaphase ( Touati et al., 2019 ).

The phenotypic effects of blocking Stu2 T866 phosphorylation are consistent with a role for this modification in anaphase spindle function. Cell harboring stu2 T866V had anaphase spindle defects and striking cell viability alterations when combined with mutants of other spindle regulators ( Fig. 7A – G ). The dependence of kar3-AID stu2 T866V cells on benomyl for growth is particularly notable, and it is reminiscent of the phenotype associated with tubulin mutants that produce hyperstable microtubules ( Thomas, Neff and Botstein, 1985 ; Richards et al., 2000 ; Macaluso et al., 2025 ). The tub2–150 allele in particular displays hyperstable microtubules, and is both benomyl dependent for growth and defective for anaphase spindle elongation ( Thomas, Neff and Botstein, 1985 ; Macaluso et al., 2025 ). Given the similarity in cellular phenotypes between hyperstable tubulin mutants and stu2 T866V , which is further exacerbated with Kar3 depletion ( Fig. S2E , 7A – G ), we propose Stu2 T866 phosphorylation, and the resulting changes in Stu2 localization, may also play a role in modulating microtubule stability. Further work will be needed to confirm this hypothesis. Why stu2 T866V does not produce more dramatic cell viability defects on its own is unknown. This could be either because rapid anaphase spindle elongation is dispensable in yeast ( Abouelghar et al., 2022 ), or possibly because Stu2 T866 is just one of many sites that Cdc5-PP2A Cdc55 modify to regulate the anaphase spindle ( Fig. 8A , S5G ), and the effects of blocking just one of these sites is relatively small.

The rapid phosphorylation of Stu2 T866 at anaphase onset could also serve other cellular purposes. One mechanism we considered is whether Stu2-dependent kinetochore functions are affected by Stu2 T866 phosphorylation, including Stu2’s proposed role in error correction ( Miller, Asbury and Biggins, 2016 ; Miller et al., 2019 ). Kinetochore error-correction mechanisms are thought to be downregulated at anaphase onset to address the “anaphase problem” (Vázquez-Novelle et al., 2010) as kinetochore-microtubule attachments are under low tension during anaphase. Ipl1, a main effector of error-correction in metaphase, is relocalized from centromeres to the midzone at anaphase onset through Cdc14-mediated dephosphorylation of Sli15 ( Buvelot et al., 2003 ; Khmelinskii et al., 2007 ; Zimniak et al., 2012 ; Cairo et al., 2023 ). It is attractive to propose that phosphorylation of Stu2 T866 could serve as a mechanism to control Stu2’s putative error-correction activity, but our data suggest that Stu2 T866 modification is not the sole regulator of Stu2-dependent kinetochore function. The phenotypes observed in stu2 T866V cells are not consistent with hyperactivated error correction, such as tethering Ipl1 to outer kinetochore substrates ( Li, Garcia-Rodriguez and Tanaka, 2023 ), which severely compromises cell viability. Instead, it is more likely that Stu2 T866 phosphorylation plays a role in redistributing Stu2 between kinetochores and microtubules to regulate the mitotic spindle, as our data show. Our results also do not exclude the possibility that other post-translational modifications of Stu2 or Ndc80c may influence their association and/or kinetochore function ( Greenlee et al., 2022 ), and this is an important topic for future studies.

Another role for rapid Stu2 T866 phosphorylation could be to regulate non-kinetochore subpopulations of Stu2. This is possible because the Stu2 CTS facilitates multiple protein-protein interactions with various coiled-coil containing proteins (including Bik1 and Spc72). The best available structure predictions suggest that Stu2’s CTS interacts with Bik1 and Spc72 using similar modes as the Stu2:Ndc80c interaction, however robust biochemical and structural studies are needed to conclusively demonstrate this ( Fig. S2G ) ( Zheng et al., 2025 ). If all CTS:protein interactions modes are identical, then phosphorylation of the Stu2 CTS at T866 by Cdc5 would be expected to disrupt all such interactions. While direct structural evidence for the Stu2:Bik1 interaction is currently lacking, we cannot rule out the possibility that it is also regulated by T866 phosphorylation. Changes in Stu2:Bik1 binding could offer an alternative explanation for our results. However, our data clearly demonstrate that T866 phosphorylation modulates Stu2:Ndc80c interactions. Further work will be needed to definitively determine how these pathways influence Stu2’s subcellular localization.

Subcellular localization of Cdc5 or PP2A Cdc55 could also differentially regulate Stu2 subpopulations, even if they share similar CTS binding modes. For instance, Cdc5 transitions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during late anaphase, potentially leading to differential regulation of nuclear versus cytoplasmic Stu2 pools (Botchkarev, Rossio and Yoshida, 2014; Botchkarev et al., 2017). This dynamic localization, coupled with a drop in Cdc5 activity during mitotic exit (Touati et al., 2018, 2019 ), could result in distinct regulation of cytoplasmic Stu2 bound to Spc72 versus nuclear Stu2 bound to Ndc80c. Additionally, other Stu2 domains, such as the basic linker, mediate protein interactions and may define CTS-independent Stu2 pools that are regulated differently. A subset of nuclear and kinetochore-proximal Stu2 has also been shown to vary in its dynamism across the cell cycle ( Aravamudhan et al., 2014 ). It remains unclear how Stu2 T866 phosphorylation affects these dynamics versus stable Stu2 pools, or whether this regulation influences dynamism at all. These questions warrant further investigation.

Our work provides new, detailed information concerning mechanisms for specifying substrates of Plk1/Cdc5. Many Cdc5 substrates require priming through proline-directed phosphorylation before they can interact with Cdc5 polo-box domain ( Elia et al., 2003 ), while others depend on hydrophobic interactions between the substrate and a distal face of the Cdc5 polo-box domain, separate from the canonical phosphopeptide binding region ( Almawi et al., 2020 ). A recent report also suggests a different mode of human Plk1:substrate interaction, mediated by electrostatic interactions on the canonical phosphopeptide binding surface of Plk1, but independent of substrate phosphorylation ( Conti et al., 2024 ). This interaction has been shown to be important for Plk1 to assist in nucleosome deposition in G1, a time at which Cdk activity is very low (reviewed in ( Bloom and Cross, 2007 )). Our finding that Cdc5-FRB can reduce Stu2 colocalization with kinetochores in both G1 and mitotic cells is surprising given the previous literature suggesting ectopically expressed Cdc5 is inactive in G1 due to low Cdc28 activity ( Mortensen et al., 2005 ; Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2016 ). However, the effect we observe relies only on re-localizing Cdc5 and not on ectopically expressing it, perhaps suggesting there are more control mechanisms for Cdc5 activity than just Cdc28 priming. In agreement with this idea, and with new findings in ( Conti et al., 2024 ), our results show that Stu2 has two polo-box interacting motifs: one dependent on phosphorylation of a Cdk/Cdc28 consensus site (Stu2 S603 ) and another driven by hydrophobic interactions independent of Cdc28 phosphorylation. An important direction for future research will be to determine whether both interaction motifs are always used or if they are specifically engaged during different stages of the cell cycle, when Cdc28 activity levels vary. We also note that a previous study has suggested that Stu2 is a Cdc5 substrate, findings that nicely complement our mechanistic work here ( Park et al., 2008 ).

Our in-depth mutational analysis is consistent with the notion of a kinase-phosphatase network that controls the timing of many cellular events at anaphase onset. For Stu2 this phosphorylation appears to follow a “switchlike” response in the cell cycle, with phosphorylation of Stu2 T866 increasing rapidly at anaphase onset. We therefore propose Stu2 is a newly identified Cdc5-PP2A Cdc55 substrate as it behaves like the prototypical Cdc5-PP2A Cdc55 substrate Net1 ( Queralt et al., 2006 ; Touati et al., 2019 ). Certainly, Stu2 T866 is not the only site regulated within this network. Phosphoproteomics experiments also showed that Cdc5 and PP2A Cdc55 modify many microtubule- and actin-cytoskeleton associated factors during the metaphase-anaphase transition ( Fig. S5G , see also ( Touati et al., 2019 )). More targeted studies show that PP2A Cdc55 regulates the actin cytoskeleton during the cell cycle ( Jonasson et al., 2016 ; Moyano-Rodríguez et al., 2022 ). Complementing these findings, we show that PP2A Cdc55 also regulates the microtubule cytoskeleton, in part by controlling Stu2 localization. Additional microtubule regulators such as Bim1, Stu1, and Ase1, which are also PP2A Cdc55 targets ( Touati et al., 2019 ), likely contribute to the large changes in the cytoskeleton during anaphase. We believe that misregulation of these factors may account for the spindle defects observed in cells induced to enter anaphase via TEV-Scc1 cleavage in the absence of separase activity ( Uhlmann et al., 2000 ). Furthermore, it is unknown if other important substrates in this pathway may have thus far escaped detection ( Baro et al., 2018 ; Touati et al., 2019 ). In particular, several kinetochore, motor, and MAP proteins are predicted to be Cdc5 substrates, including Ndc80, Spc24, Kar3, Bim1, Sli15, and Cse4 ( Ólafsson and Thorpe, 2015 , 2020 ). Whether the Cdc5-PP2A Cdc55 network also regulates these or other proteins at anaphase onset could be addressed by the kinase tethering tools and mutational analyses described here, and remain important avenues for future work.

Finally, there are reports from studies on human cells indicating anaphase-specific phosphorylation of Plk1 targets, particularly the microtubule regulator Prc1 (homolog of yeast Ase1). These studies show that Prc1 T602 is phosphorylated by Plk1 in metaphase, and that phosphorylated T602 accumulates rapidly in anaphase to facilitate proper function of the spindle midzone ( Neef et al., 2007 ; Hu et al., 2012 ; Holder, Mohammed and Barr, 2020 ; Lim et al., 2024 ; Tai et al., 2025 ), and support the notion that post transitional modifications of MAPs tune microtubule dynamics in anaphase. This pattern is reminiscent of the behavior of Stu2 T866 and other Cdc5-PP2A Cdc55 threonine substrates in yeast. Furthermore, evidence suggests a similar inactivation of human PP2A B55 dephosphorylation during anaphase ( Játiva et al., 2019 ). The mechanisms described here may therefore represent a conserved strategy to enhance phosphorylation of Plk1 substrates rapidly at anaphase onset.
