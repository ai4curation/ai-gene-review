Oscillating cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity is the major regulator of 
cell-cycle progression, whereas the Aurora B kinase, as part of the chromosome 
passenger complex (CPC), controls critical aspects of mitosis such as chromosome 
condensation and biorientation on the spindle. How these kinases mechanistically 
coordinate their important functions is only partially understood. Here, using 
budding yeast, we identify a regulatory mechanism by which the Cdk1 kinase Cdc28 
directly controls the Aurora kinase Ipl1. We show that Cdk1 phosphorylates Ipl1 
on two serine residues in the N-terminal domain, thereby suppressing its 
association with the microtubule plus-end tracking protein Bim1 until the onset 
of anaphase. Failure to phosphorylate Ipl1 leads to its premature targeting to 
the metaphase spindle and results in constitutive Bim1 phosphorylation, which is 
normally restricted to anaphase. Cells expressing an Ipl1-Sli15 complex that 
cannot be phosphorylated by Cdk1 display a severe growth defect. Our work shows 
that Ipl1/Aurora is not only the catalytic subunit of the CPC but also an 
important regulatory target that allows Cdk1 to coordinate chromosome 
biorientation with spindle morphogenesis.

Cells coordinate diverse events at anaphase onset, including separase activation, cohesin cleavage, chromosome separation, and spindle reorganization. Regulation of the XMAP215 family member and microtubule polymerase, Stu2, at the metaphase-anaphase transition determines a redistribution from kinetochores to spindle microtubules. We show that cells modulate Stu2 kinetochore-microtubule localization by Polo-like kinase1/Cdc5-mediated phosphorylation of T866, near the Stu2 C-terminus, thereby promoting dissociation from the kinetochore Ndc80 complex. Cdk/Cdc28 likely primes Cdc5:Stu2 interaction. Cdc28 activity is also required for Stu2 nuclear import. PP2ACdc55 actively opposes Cdc5 activity on Stu2T866 during metaphase. This counter-regulation allows for switchlike redistribution of Stu2pT866 at anaphase onset when separase inhibits PP2ACdc55. Blocking Stu2T866 phosphorylation disrupts anaphase spindle progression, and we infer that PP2ACdc55 regulates the mitotic spindle by dephosphorylating multiple MAPs, including Stu2. These data support a model in which increased phosphorylation at anaphase onset results from phosphatase inhibition and point to a larger regulatory network that facilitates rapid cytoskeletal modulation required for anaphase spindle function.

Stu2 displays dynamic localization patterns in the cell cycle, with different kinetochore and microtubule distribution during distinct phases. Phosphorylation near Stu2’s C-terminus reduces its attachment to kinetochores to promote its microtubule activity in anaphase. Cdc5 and PP2ACdc55 play counteracting roles in this pathway to promote proper timing of Stu2 phosphorylation.
