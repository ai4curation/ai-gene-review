Oscillating cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity is the major regulator of 
cell-cycle progression, whereas the Aurora B kinase, as part of the chromosome 
passenger complex (CPC), controls critical aspects of mitosis such as chromosome 
condensation and biorientation on the spindle. How these kinases mechanistically 
coordinate their important functions is only partially understood. Here, using 
budding yeast, we identify a regulatory mechanism by which the Cdk1 kinase Cdc28 
directly controls the Aurora kinase Ipl1. We show that Cdk1 phosphorylates Ipl1 
on two serine residues in the N-terminal domain, thereby suppressing its 
association with the microtubule plus-end tracking protein Bim1 until the onset 
of anaphase. Failure to phosphorylate Ipl1 leads to its premature targeting to 
the metaphase spindle and results in constitutive Bim1 phosphorylation, which is 
normally restricted to anaphase. Cells expressing an Ipl1-Sli15 complex that 
cannot be phosphorylated by Cdk1 display a severe growth defect. Our work shows 
that Ipl1/Aurora is not only the catalytic subunit of the CPC but also an 
important regulatory target that allows Cdk1 to coordinate chromosome 
biorientation with spindle morphogenesis.
