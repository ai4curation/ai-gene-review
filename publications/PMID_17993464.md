Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a component of cartilage, 
synovium, ligament, and tendon, yet its normal function is largely unknown. To 
identify its function we have expressed it in 293 and HeLa cell lines and in 
primary human chondrocytes. We find that COMP protects these cells against 
death, either in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor alpha and is 
able to block activation of caspase 3, a critical effector caspase. This effect 
appears to be mediated by the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) family of 
anti-apoptotic proteins because the levels of XIAP, survivin, cIAP1 and cIAP2 
are significantly elevated in the COMP-expressing cells and down-regulation of 
survivin and XIAP protein levels by small interfering RNAs blocks the ability of 
COMP to enhance survival. The mRNAs for most of the IAP family members were not 
increased by COMP, indicating that a translational/post-translational mechanism 
was involved in their induction. However, in both HeLa cells and chondrocytes, 
COMP induced survivin mRNA by 5-fold. Thus survivin is the first gene identified 
to be up-regulated transcriptionally by COMP. The carboxyl-terminal half of the 
protein comprising the type 3 repeats and the RGD sequence (CaCTD domain) was 
sufficient to promote survival and to elevate the IAPs. Further, an RGD peptide 
was able to block the prosurvival effect of COMP and the induction of XIAP and 
survivin, indicating that survival is likely mediated through integrin 
signaling. These data point to a new role for COMP in protecting cells against 
death.
