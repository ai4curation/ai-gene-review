The assembly of stable cytoskeletal structures from dynamically recycled 
molecules requires developmental and spatial regulation of protein interactions. 
In muscle, titin acts as a molecular ruler organizing the actin cytoskeleton via 
interactions with many sarcomeric proteins, including the crosslinking protein 
alpha-actinin. An interaction between the C-terminal domain of alpha-actinin and 
titin Z-repeat motifs targets alpha-actinin to the Z-disk. Here we investigate 
the cellular regulation of this interaction. alpha-actinin is a rod shaped 
head-to-tail homodimer. In contrast to C-terminal fragments, full-length 
alpha-actinin does not bind Z-repeats. We identify a 30-residue Z-repeat 
homologous sequence between the actin-binding and rod regions of alpha-actinin 
that binds the C-terminal domain with nanomolar affinity. Thus, Z-repeat binding 
is prevented by this 'pseudoligand' interaction between the subunits of the 
alpha-actinin dimer. This autoinhibition is relieved upon binding of the Z-disk 
lipid phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphate to the actin-binding domain. We suggest 
that this novel mechanism is relevant to control the site-specific interactions 
of alpha-actinin during sarcomere assembly and turnover. The intramolecular 
contacts defined here also constrain a structural model for intrasterical 
regulation of all alpha-actinin isoforms.
