Agonists of CCR1 contribute to hypersensitivity reactions and atherosclerotic 
lesions, possibly via the regulation of the transcription factor STAT3. CCR1 was 
demonstrated to use pertussis toxin-insensitive Gα(14/16) to stimulate 
phospholipase Cβ and NF-κB, whereas both Gα(14) and Gα(16) are also capable of 
activating STAT3. The coexpression of CCR1 and Gα(14/16) in human THP-1 
macrophage-like cells suggests that CCR1 may use Gα(14/16) to induce STAT3 
activation. In this study, we demonstrated that a CCR1 agonist, leukotactin-1 
(CCL15), could indeed stimulate STAT3 Tyr(705) and Ser(727) phosphorylation via 
pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, human 
erythroleukemia cells, and HEK293 cells overexpressing CCR1 and Gα(14/16). The 
STAT3 Tyr(705) and Ser(727) phosphorylations were independent of each other and 
temporally distinct. Subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy 
illustrated that Tyr(705)-phosphorylated STAT3 translocated to the nucleus, 
whereas Ser(727)-phosphorylated STAT3 was retained in the cytosol after 
CCR1/Gα(14) activation. CCL15 was capable of inducing IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCL8) 
production in both THP-1 macrophage-like cells and HEK293 cells overexpressing 
CCR1 and Gα(14/16). Neutralizing Ab to IL-6 inhibited CCL15-mediated STAT3 
Tyr(705) phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of STAT3 activity abolished 
CCL15-activated CXCL8 release. The ability of CCR1 to signal through Gα(14/16) 
provides a linkage for CCL15 to regulate IL-6/STAT3-signaling cascades, leading 
to expression of CXCL8, a cytokine that is involved in inflammation and the 
rupture of atherosclerotic plaque.
