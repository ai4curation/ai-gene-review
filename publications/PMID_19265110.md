PTPN22 is a gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase Lyp. A missense 
mutation changing residue 1858 from cytosine to thymidine (1858C/T) is 
associated with multiple autoimmune disorders. Studies have demonstrated that 
Lyp has an inhibitory effect on TCR signaling; however, the presence of 
autoantibodies in all of the diseases associated with the 1858T variant and 
recent evidence that Ca(2+) flux is altered in B cells of 1858T carriers 
indicate a role for Lyp in B cell signaling. In this study we show that B cell 
signal transduction is impaired in individuals who express the variant. This 
defect in signaling is characterized by a deficit in proliferation, a decrease 
in phosphorylation of key signaling proteins, and is reversed by inhibition of 
Lyp. These findings suggest that the PTPN22 1858T variant alters BCR signaling 
and implicate B cells in the mechanism by which the PTPN22 1858T variant 
contributes to autoimmunity.
