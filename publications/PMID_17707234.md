Reversible covalent methylation of lysine residues on histone proteins 
constitutes a principal molecular mechanism that links chromatin states to 
diverse biological outcomes. Recently, lysine methylation has been observed on 
nonhistone proteins, suggesting broad cellular roles for the enzymes generating 
and removing methyl moieties. Here we report that the lysine methyltransferase 
enzyme SET8/PR-Set7 regulates the tumor suppressor protein p53. We find that 
SET8 specifically monomethylates p53 at lysine 382 (p53K382me1). This 
methylation event robustly suppresses p53-mediated transcription activation of 
highly responsive target genes but has little influence on weak targets. 
Further, depletion of SET8 augments the proapoptotic and checkpoint activation 
functions of p53, and accordingly, SET8 expression is downregulated upon DNA 
damage. Together, our study identifies SET8 as a p53-modifying enzyme, 
identifies p53K382me1 as a regulatory posttranslational modification of p53, and 
begins to dissect how methylation may contribute to a dynamic posttranslational 
code that modulates distinct p53 functions.

Introduction

Methylation events at distinct lysine residues within histone proteins are linked to diverse functional outcomes ( Jenuwein and Allis, 2001 ). For example, methylation at histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me) is largely detected at euchromatin and is thought to generally lead to increased DNA accessibility, whereas methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me) is most commonly associated with heterochromatin and inaccessible DNA ( Bannister and Kouzarides, 2004 ). One mechanism by which lysine methylation aids in the establishment of distinct chromatin states is by mediating modular protein-protein interactions ( Daniel et al., 2005 ). In this regard, the proteins that recognize a methylated lysine within a specific sequence context can define the functional outcome of a lysine methylation event. Further, histone lysines can be mono-, di- or trimethylated, with a unique activity frequently being coupled to the specific state and extent of methylation on the lysine residue. Thus, methylation of lysine residues on a target protein can increase the signaling potential of the modified protein and as such lead to diverse physiologic consequences.

p53 is a transcription regulator that plays a central role in tumor suppression by directing cellular responses to diverse stresses ( Laptenko and Prives, 2006 ; Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). The levels and activity of p53 are regulated by a complex network of post-translational modifications that primarily occur within two regions of the protein: an N-terminal region that is phosphorylated at multiple sites and a C-terminal region rich in basic residues ( Appella and Anderson, 2001 ; Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). Recent reports indicate that p53 is monomethylated at two different lysine residues within the regulatory C-terminal region ( Chuikov et al., 2004 ; Huang et al., 2006 ). Akin to how H3K4me and H3K9me are linked to opposing states of chromatin, the two known sites of p53 methylation are coupled to activities that oppose one another. Specifically, SET7/9-mediated monomethylation of p53 at K372 (p53K372me1) activates p53, postulated in part to occur via stabilization of chromatin-associated p53, whereas Smyd2-mediated monomethylation of p53 at K370 (p53K370me1) represents a repressive mark, the generation of which is impeded by p53K372me1 ( Chuikov et al., 2004 ; Huang et al., 2006 ). In addition to methylation at K370 and K372, the C-terminal region of human p53 harbors several K residues that are subject to modification by acetylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation and neddylation (reviewed in Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). Notably, endogenous p53 protein from two independent mouse models in which these lysines were targeted for mutation did not display an alteration in stability, and the phenotypes of cells derived from the mice were relatively mild ( Feng et al., 2005 ; Krummel et al., 2005 ). This work argues that in sum, the post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the p53 C-terminal region fine-tune p53 activity. However, as substitution of lysines will prevent all forms of PTMs, including mono-, di- and trimethylation, mutant phenotypes may indicate the elimination of both positive and negative regulatory effects. Thus, identifying and characterizing the enzymes that catalyze p53 modifications is critical for developing a molecular understanding of how p53 PTMs are coordinated to regulate p53 functions.

SET7/9 and Smyd2 were both first reported to function as histone methyltransferases (HMTs), suggesting that other HMTs might have non-histone substrates ( Brown et al., 2006 ; Nishioka et al., 2002a ; Wang et al., 2001 ). SET8/PR-Set7 is an HMT that adds a single methyl moiety to histone H4 tails at lysine 20 (H4K20me1), preferentially to nucleosomal H4 ( Fang et al., 2002 ; Nishioka et al., 2002b ). Mutation of the SET8/PR-Set7 gene in Drosophila melanogaster leads to lethality during development ( Nishioka et al., 2002b ). H4K20me1 generation by SET8 has also been shown to be important for gene silencing and mitotic regulation ( Fang et al., 2002 ; Julien and Herr, 2004 ; Rice et al., 2002 ). Here we demonstrate a novel activity for SET8 as a p53 methyltransferase. We find that SET8-mediated methylation of p53 at K382 represses highly responsive p53 target genes to attenuate p53 pro-apoptotic and cell-cycle arrest functions. We propose a model in which SET8-mediated p53 methylation tips the balance of p53 function away from cell elimination towards cell survival.

Discussion

Here we have shown that the HMT enzyme SET8/PR-Set7 specifically monomethylates p53 at lysine 382 in vitro and in vivo . We have also provided the first mass spectrometry evidence that endogenous p53 is methylated (see Figure 2A ). Ectopic expression of SET8 suppresses p53 transactivation activity and knock-down of endogenous SET8 by RNAi augments a number of p53 activities, including induction of highly responsive target genes, and increased apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest (see model, Figure 7 ). Numerous experiments indicate that these phenotypes are a consequence of SET8 methylation of p53, and not an indirect effect of H4K20 methylation by SET8. For example, in H1299 cells, SET8 represses ectopic p53, but fails to do so if p53 harbors a mutation at K382 (p53K382R) ( Figure 4A and 4B ). If SET8 repression of p53 target genes occurred via H4K20 methylation rather than p53K382 methylation, then the transactivation activity of wild-type and mutant p53K382R proteins should both be equally affected by SET8. As we do observe a requirement for K382 to be intact, we conclude that availability of this residue for methylation by SET8 is needed for SET8 to repress p53. Further evidence for a direct regulation of p53 by SET8 is that all SET8 RNAi phenotypes associated with DNA damage (e.g. increased p21 induction and cell death) are absolutely dependent on the presence of p53 protein. Thus, SET8, like a number of other p53-regulatory enzymes, such as TIP60, SIRT1, SET7/9 and HDAC1, utilizes both p53 and histones as substrates â€“ with distinct functions specific to the different substrates ( Sykes et al., 2006 ; Tang et al., 2006 ) ( Chuikov et al., 2004 ; Luo et al., 2001 ; Luo et al., 2000 ; Vaquero et al., 2004 ; Vaziri et al., 2001 ; Wang et al., 2001 ).

We observe that p53K382me1 levels decrease with DNA damage. This observation, in conjunction with our functional characterization, argues that SET8 is a negative regulator of p53 activity. However, we do observe a SET8-dependent up-regulation of the DNA repair gene GADD45, indicating that p53K382 methylation might have more complex regulatory roles than simply contributing to on/off functions. In this regard, under normal conditions, monomethylation at K382 might render p53 largely inert but predisposed to respond to specific cellular stresses ( Figure 7 ). Alternatively, this methylation event might dampen p53 as a mechanism for measured responses to mild insults, allowing for p53-dependent repair of DNA without the induction of cell death.

At the molecular level, how might K382 monomethylation be coupled to regulation of p53 functions? We postulate that the biological consequences of p53K382me1, alone, or in the context of additional modifications, might be dictated by distinct protein binding partners; different proteins can therefore define and channel p53 towards divergent activities. In this context, the MBT domain is a protein module found commonly on nuclear proteins and that has been shown to bind monomethyllysines ( Kim et al., 2006 ), raising the possibility that a modular interaction between an MBT domain-containing protein and p53K382me1 acts to repress p53. There are several other methyllysine-binding domains that preferentially recognize higher methyl states than monomethyllysine ( Daniel et al., 2005 ; Ruthenburg et al., 2007 ; Zhang, 2006 ). This raises the question of whether SET8 monomethylation of p53 at K382 leaves p53 poised to be further methylated in response to a specific signal, and that the higher methyl forms are linked to additional p53 functions ( Figure 7 ). We have not detected methyltransferase activity on p53K382 by Suv4-20h1 and Suv4-20h2, two well-characterized H4K20 HMTs (X. Shi and O. Gozani, unpublished observations) ( Schotta et al., 2004 ). In addition to these two enzymes, there are other putative H4K20 HMTs, such as ASH1 and NSD1, as well as numerous uncharacterized SET domain containing proteins, and perhaps one of these functions as a di- or trimethyltransferase at p53K382 ( Beisel et al., 2002 ; Rayasam et al., 2003 ). In summary, this study reveals novel functions for the SET8 HMT in regulating the non-histone protein p53, and supports the hypothesis that protein lysine methylation likely modulates diverse cellular processes ( Zhang and Dent, 2005 ).
