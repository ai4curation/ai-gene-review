## Abstract

1. Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Sep;24(17):7444-55. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.17.7444-7455.2004.

BRCA2 is ubiquitinated in vivo and interacts with USP11, a deubiquitinating 
enzyme that exhibits prosurvival function in the cellular response to DNA 
damage.

Individuals carrying a germ line mutation of the breast cancer susceptibility 
gene BRCA2 are predisposed to breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer. The 
BRCA2 protein has been proposed to function in the repair of DNA double-strand 
breaks. Using an immunopurification-mass spectrometry approach to identify novel 
proteins that associate with the BRCA2 gene product, we found that a 
deubiquitinating enzyme, USP11, formed specific complexes with BRCA2. Moreover, 
BRCA2 was constitutively ubiquitinated in vivo in the absence of detectable 
proteasomal degradation. Mitomycin C (MMC) led to decreased BRCA2 protein levels 
associated with increased ubiquitination, consistent with proteasome-dependent 
degradation. While BRCA2 could be deubiquitinated by USP11 in transient 
overexpression assays, a catalytically inactive USP11 mutant had no effect on 
BRCA2 ubiquitination or protein levels. Antagonism of USP11 function either 
through expression of this mutant or through RNA interference increased cellular 
sensitivity to MMC in a BRCA2-dependent manner. All of these results imply that 
BRCA2 expression levels are regulated by ubiquitination in the cellular response 
to MMC-induced DNA damage and that USP11 participates in DNA damage repair 
functions within the BRCA2 pathway independently of BRCA2 deubiquitination.
