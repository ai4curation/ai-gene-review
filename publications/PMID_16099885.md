High-throughput genomic technology identified an association between a single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), a proline (P387) rather than the predominant 
alanine (A387) at position 387 in thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4) and premature 
myocardial infarction. The inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis invokes a 
prominent role of leukocytes and cytokines in pathogenesis. As the expression of 
TSP-4 by vascular cells permits its exposure to circulating leukocytes, the 
interactions of human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]) with 
both TSP-4 variants were investigated. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(PMA)-stimulated PMNs adhered and migrated well and equally on the TSP-4 
variants. Integrin alpha(M)beta2 was identified as the TSP-4 receptor mediating 
these responses, and the 3 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of TSP-4 
harboring the SNPs interacted with the alpha(M)I-domain. Despite the similarity 
in these responses, the P387 variant induced more robust tyrosine 
phosphorylation of the stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): 
p38MAPK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), as well as signal transducer and 
activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) than the 
A387 variant. Additionally, cells adherent to P387 TSP-4 variant released 4-fold 
more H2O2 and secreted 2-fold more interleukin 8 (IL-8) as compared with the 
A387. H2O2 release and p38MAPK activation were totally inhibited by blockade of 
alpha(M)beta2. Thus, alpha(M)beta2 plays a central role in proinflammatory 
activities of TSP-4 (P387) and may contribute to the prothrombotic phenotype 
associated with this variant.

Abstract

High-throughput genomic technology identified an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), a proline (P387) rather than the predominant alanine (A387) at position 387 in thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4) and premature myocardial infarction. The inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis invokes a prominent role of leukocytes and cytokines in pathogenesis. As the expression of TSP-4 by vascular cells permits its exposure to circulating leukocytes, the interactions of human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]) with both TSP-4 variants were investigated. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)–stimulated PMNs adhered and migrated well and equally on the TSP-4 variants. Integrin α M β 2 was identified as the TSP-4 receptor mediating these responses, and the 3 epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like domains of TSP-4 harboring the SNPs interacted with the α M I-domain. Despite the similarity in these responses, the P387 variant induced more robust tyrosine phosphorylation of the stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): p38MAPK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), as well as signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) than the A387 variant. Additionally, cells adherent to P387 TSP-4 variant released 4-fold more H 2 O 2 and secreted 2-fold more interleukin 8 (IL-8) as compared with the A387. H 2 O 2 release and p38MAPK activation were totally inhibited by blockade of α M β 2 . Thus, α M β 2 plays a central role in proinflammatory activities of TSP-4 (P387) and may contribute to the prothrombotic phenotype associated with this variant.

Introduction

Recent high-throughput genotyping has sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with familial coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI). 1 - 3 One such study detected a highly statistical association between SNPs in 3 of the 5 members of the thrombospondin (TSP) family and MI. 1 The disease-associated TSP-4 SNP, a proline at position 387 (P387) rather than the predominant alanine (A387), showed very strong association with MI (adjusted odds ratio, 1.89) and occurred at high frequency (34%) in a white population. 1 This association was particularly surprising because no prior data had linked TSP-4 with MI; indeed, very little was known about the function of TSP-4 in vivo. Nevertheless, the association of TSP-4 (P387) with MI has been corroborated in several independent studies 4 - 7 and strongly supports the importance of TSP-4 in cardiovascular pathology.

The thrombospondin family is composed of 5 extracellular matrix glycoproteins. TSP-1 and TSP-2 are the best characterized members of the family and are implicated in diverse responses, including platelet aggregation, inflammatory processes, and regulation of angiogenesis (reviewed in Adams, 8 Adams and Lawler, 9 and Bornstein et al 10 ). TSP-4 mRNA was first identified in heart and skeletal muscles, 11 and cellular expression of its mRNA and/or protein has been demonstrated in endothelial and smooth muscle cells from brain and heart. 12 Of the limited information on its functions, TSP-4 has been shown to support myoblast adhesion 13 and neurite outgrowth 14 and to interact with certain matrix proteins. 15 We have reported that the TSP-4 variants exert distinct effects on endothelial cells with the proatherogenic TSP-4 variant, (P387), failing to support endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation. 12 However, not only endothelium but also leukocytes are crucial to the inflammatory response underlying atherosclerosis. In early stages of the disease, monocytes and neutrophils infiltrate the intima and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which provoke oxidative damage to vascular cells. 16 - 18 Indeed, epidemiologic studies indicate that peripheral blood leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, correlate with coronary atherosclerosis and MI. 19 In addition, neutrophils are activated in patients with unstable angina and MI and accumulate in eroded atherosclerotic plaques and sites of endothelial cell denudation immediately following bypass grafting. 20 - 22 In view of these findings, we sought to characterize and compare interactions of TSP-4 and its variants with human neutrophils.

Discussion

In the present study, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized interaction between human leukocytes and TSP-4 and show that the MI risk variant, TSP-4 (P387), and the predominant form, TSP-4 (A387), induce distinct biologic responses in these cells. We also show that α M β 2 is a receptor for TSP-4, the first identified receptor for this TSP family member. Although both TSP-4 variants supported PMN adhesion and migration by engaging α M β 2 , the disease-associated variant induced more robust prothrombotic and proinflammatory responses as evidenced by greater release of H 2 O 2 and IL-8. These differences are the consequence of activation of distinct signaling pathways by the variants.

Our identification of α M β 2 as a TSP-4 receptor is based on several lines of evidence: (1) function-blocking mAbs directed to either α M or β 2 subunit completely inhibited PMN adhesion to TSP-4; (2) a high-affinity and specific ligand of α M β 2 , NIF, also blocked PMN adhesion to TSP-4 34 , 35 ; (3) HEK293 cells expressing α M β 2 , but not α L β 2 or vector-transfected control cells, responded to TSP-4; (4) a chimeric receptor in which the α M I-domain was placed into the α L β 2 backbone acquired the capacity to recognize TSP-4; and (5) TSP-4 directly interacted with recombinant α M I-domain. This latter observation, together with the specificities of NIF 34 , 35 and mAb 44a 36 for the α M I-domain, indicates that this region of the α M subunit plays a crucial role in TSP-4 recognition. Thus, TSP-4 appears to represent an additional ligand of this promiscuous receptor and its I-domain, and its recognition supports both adhesion and migration of PMNs. Although PMN adhesion to TSP-4 was partially mediated by α V β 3 , the observed kinase activation and biologic responses (H 2 O 2 production) depended on engagement of α M β 2 , legitimizing its classification as a genuine TSP-4 receptor. To date, interactions of TSP-1 with human PMNs have been reported, but the involvement of α M β 2 in recognition remains uncertain. Nathan et al 37 demonstrated that PMNs isolated from patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), who lack β 2 integrins, as well as normal PMNs treated with blocking mAbs to the integrin, exhibited diminished adherence to TSP-1, indicating involvement of the β 2 integrins in TSP-1 binding, whereas Suchard et al 38 and Suchard and Boxer 39 reported that PMNs from other patients with LAD still adhered to TSP-1. The latest study identified 2 TSP-1 regions involved in PMN recognition: F16-G33 in its heparin binding domain and A784-N823 within its type-3 repeats. 40 Our data with the EGF-3 fragments implicate the type-2 repeats of TSP-4 in recognition by α M β 2 . Hence, there is not a common site that mediates recognition of both TSP-1 and TSP-4 by α M β 2 .

We observed that PMNs increased H 2 O 2 production by 4-fold in response to TSP-4 (P387). Consistent with the observations made with TSP-1 by Nathan, 41 , 42 ROS production was critically dependent on PMN adhesion and only occurred to a very modest extent with cells exposed to ligand in suspension. Our results also are in agreement with other studies indicating that production of ROS by macrophages is not only dependent on α M β 2 43 but also on activation of p38MAPK. 44 - 46 Although exogenous oxidants can promote p38MAPK activation, 47 the time course of events indicated that p38MAPK phosphorylation (5-30 minutes) preceded H 2 O 2 production (first detected at 3 hours, data not shown). Of the inflammatory cytokines measured, TSP-4 P387 enhanced production of IL-8. It is likely that IL-8 secretion also is β 2 integrin dependent in view of the data demonstrating that α M β 2 -dependent PMN adhesion to fibrinogen resulted in IL-8 production by de novo synthesis and that PMNs isolated from β 2 -deficient mice are unable to produce MIP-2, a homologue of human IL-8. 48 , 49

Analyses of the tyrosine protein phosphorylation patterns on Western blots of lysates of PMNs adherent to TSP-4 provided direct evidence that the variants induce distinct cellular responses. The TSP-4 P387 variant preferentially activated several kinases. Among these, p38MAPK was selectively activated by engagement of TSP-4 (P387) by α M β 2 ; its phosphorylation was inhibited by mAbs to α M β 2 . Subsequently, active p38 MAPK mediated ROS release by adherent PMNs. In addition, we may speculate that p38 MAPK supported enhanced IL-8 secretion in view of the findings that this kinase promotes stabilization of IL-8 mRNA. 50 Activation of p38 MAPK by (P387) TSP-4 is particularly important, because p38 MAPK is a highly proinflammatory kinase, being critically involved in cell migration, regulation of apoptosis and survival, 51 oxidative burst, 52 and production of IL-6 and TNFα in PMNs and other leukocytes. 31 , 32 , 53 Thus, p38 MAPK might be an attractive therapeutic target for protection against cardiovascular disease in individuals carrying the P387 variant. 54 TSP-4 P387 induced activation of other MAPK family members, heat shock protein (HSP) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Both are activated by a variety of environmental stresses and regulate cell apoptosis, production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-12, and IL-1 (reviewed in Kyriakis and Avruch, 31 Dong et al, 32 and Rane et al 55 ). Thus, TSP-4 (P387), in contrast to the TSP-4 A387 variant, preferentially activates stress-related signaling events in human PMNs, contributing to augmented inflammation.

Interestingly, the TSP-4 (P387) variant significantly enhanced PMN spreading as well as α M β 2 expression and clustering. These differences in PMN spreading are consistent with increased p38MAPK activation, which controls spreading of macrophages 56 and would more likely lead to distinct PMN responses because H 2 O 2 production depends on PMN spreading. 57

The mechanism by which TSP-4 variants induce distinct effects on PMNs is a particularly important issue for future investigations. A387P polymorphism in TSP-4 resides in the third type-2 repeat (EGF-like domain). We did observe that a recombinant fragment of TSP-4 of approximately 50 kDa (residues 325-491) composed of 3 type 2 (EGF-like) repeats 23 (3EGF–TSP-4) ( Figure 7 ) retained their differential effects on cell signaling, IL-8, and ROS production. However, short TSP-4 peptides containing the SNPs did not support PMN adhesion and did not inhibit any of tested PMN responses induced by the full-length or shorter TSP-4 variant fragments. Either the short peptide cannot present the α M β 2 recognition site in an appropriate conformation, or the SNP substitutions exert broader conformational changes, which influence the α M β 2 recognition site residing elsewhere within the 3 EGF-like repeats. From homology to other EGF-related domains, it is predicted that the P387 substitution would lead to formation of a unique Ca 2+ binding site that would not be present in the A387 variant or with most other substitutions at this position. 58 , 23 Alterations in Ca 2+ binding, either through local or global conformational changes, is know to exert profound effects on the structure and function of other TSP family members. 59 , 60 Such postulated conformational differences within EGF-like domains could account for the higher apparent affinity of the P387 variant for the α M I-domain as compared with the A387 variant, which, in turn, could explain the differences in the functional responses elicited by the 2 variants even though both interact with α M β 2 . Thus, type-2 repeats in TSPs are important integrin binding sites because they are recognized not only by α M β 2 (in TSP-4) but also by the β 1 integrins (in TSP-1). 61

Because TSP-4 (P387) promotes endothelial cell detachment, 12 PMNs would migrate and adhere to it and produce ROS and IL-8, which are extremely important in the genesis of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and heart failure (reviewed in Husemann et al 43 and Cai and Harrison 62 ). Thus, TSP-4 P387 creates a microenvironment rich in proatherogenic stimuli and ripe for lesion development.
