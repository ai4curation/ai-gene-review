The decision of stem cells to proliferate and differentiate is finely 
controlled. The Caenorhabditis elegans germline provides a tractable system for 
studying the mechanisms that control stem cell proliferation and homeostasis 
[1-4]. Autophagy is a conserved cellular recycling process crucial for cellular 
homeostasis in many different contexts [5], but its function in germline stem 
cell proliferation remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a function for 
autophagy in germline stem cell proliferation. We found that autophagy genes 
such as bec-1/BECN1/Beclin1, atg-16.2/ATG16L, atg-18/WIPI1/2, and atg-7/ATG7 are 
required for the late larval expansion of germline stem cell progenitors in the 
C. elegans gonad. We further show that BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1 acts independently of 
the GLP-1/Notch or DAF-7/TGF-β pathways but together with the DAF-2/insulin 
IGF-1 receptor (IIR) signaling pathway to promote germline stem cell 
proliferation. Similar to DAF-2/IIR, BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1, ATG-18/WIPI1/2, and 
ATG-16.2/ATG16L all promote cell-cycle progression and are negatively regulated 
by the phosphatase and tensin homolog DAF-18/PTEN. However, whereas 
BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1 acts through the transcriptional regulator SKN-1/Nrf1, 
ATG-18/WIPI1/2 and ATG-16.2/ATG16L exert their function through the DAF-16/FOXO 
transcription factor. In contrast, ATG-7 functions in concert with the 
DAF-7/TGF-β pathway to promote germline proliferation and is not required for 
cell-cycle progression. Finally, we report that BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1 functions 
non-cell-autonomously to facilitate cell-cycle progression and stem cell 
proliferation. Our findings demonstrate a novel non-autonomous role for 
BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1 in the control of stem cell proliferation and cell-cycle 
progression, which may have implications for the understanding and development 
of therapies against malignant cell growth in the future.
