Human thioredoxin (hTrx), a small ubiquitous protein with strong reducing 
potential, has multiple biological functions, including signal transduction and 
regulation of the activity of transcription factors. hTrx expression is enhanced 
in HPV-transformed cancer cells; however, the role of hTrx in the malignant 
cells is not fully understood. We employed a yeast two-hybrid system to search 
for proteins that bind to hTrx in HeLa cells, a type of HPV-transformed human 
cervical cancer cell. In a screen of 1.62 x 10(6) yeast cotransformed with a 
HeLa cDNA library and an hTrx vector, 13 clones were identified as candidates 
for hTrx-binding proteins. Among them, 3 clones were found to code in frame for 
the carboxyl-terminal portion of VDUP1 protein, lacking at most the first 155 
residues from the start codon. A reconstructed clone carrying the full-length 
VDUP1 coding sequence also showed the ability to bind to an hTrx fusion protein. 
Loss of interaction between VDUP1 and hTrx was observed either when two 
cysteines (Cys 32 and 35) in hTrx were substituted by serines or when the 
deletion in VDUP1 was extended from amino acid position 155 to 225 or beyond. 
The 71-mer peptide fragment (position 155-225) of VDUP-1 alone did not bind to 
hTrx.
