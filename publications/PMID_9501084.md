The extracellular calcium-binding domain (positions 138-286) of the matrix 
protein BM-40 possesses a binding epitope of moderate affinity for several 
collagen types. This epitope was predicted to reside in helix alphaA and to be 
partially masked by helix alphaC. Here we show that deletion of helix alphaC 
produces a 10-fold increase in collagen affinity similar to that seen after 
proteolytic cleavage of this helix. The predicted removal of the steric 
constraint was clearly demonstrated by the crystal structure of the mutant at 
2.8 A resolution. This constitutively activated mutant was used to map the 
collagen-binding site following alanine mutagenesis at 13 positions. Five 
residues were crucial for binding, R149 and N156 in helix alphaA, and L242, M245 
and E246 in a loop region connecting the two EF hands of BM-40. These residues 
are spatially close and form a flat ring of 15 A diameter which matches the 
diameter of a triple-helical collagen domain. The mutations showed similar 
effects on binding to collagens I and IV, indicating nearly identical binding 
sites on both collagens. Selected mutations in the non-activated mutant DeltaI 
also reduced collagen binding, consistent with the same location of the epitope 
but in a more cryptic form in intact BM-40.

Here we show that deletion of helix alphaC produces a 10-fold increase in collagen affinity similar to that seen after proteolytic cleavage of this helix. The predicted removal of the steric constraint was clearly demonstrated by the crystal structure of the mutant at 2.8 A resolution. This constitutively activated mutant was used to map the collagen-binding site following alanine mutagenesis at 13 positions. Five residues were crucial for binding, R149 and N156 in helix alphaA, and L242, M245 and E246 in a loop region connecting the two EF hands of BM-40.
