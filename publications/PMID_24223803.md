MiRNAs can have pleiotropic effects by targeting multiple genes belonging to 
diverse signalling networks. Alternatively, miRNAs can enhance the potency of 
their cellular effects by targeting multiple genes within the same genetic 
pathway. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that miR-335 is a potent 
suppressor of tumour cell migration, invasion and metastasis, in part by 
targeting several genes involved in these cellular processes, including ROCK1, 
MAPK1, LRG1, SP1 and SOX4. Here, we demonstrate that direct targeting of 
multiple members of the formin family of actin nucleators contributes to the 
inhibitory effects of miR-335 in neuroblastoma cells. We demonstrate that 
miR-335 regulates the expression of at least five formin family members and 
validate three family members, FMNL3, FMN2 and DAAM2, as direct targets of 
miR-335. The contribution of the formin family genes to cancer progression and 
metastasis has recently begun to emerge and here we demonstrate for the first 
time the ability of FMN2 and DAAM2 to regulate tumour cell migration and 
invasion, using siRNA-mediated inhibition of each of these formin genes. 
Finally, we demonstrate that the formin genes, in particular FMNL3, are 
responsible for the protrusion of actin-rich filopodia structures that 
contribute to the enhanced migratory and invasive potential associated with 
reduced expression of miR-335. Thus, direct targeting of the formin family 
contributes to the metastasis suppressing abilities of miR-335 by providing a 
direct regulatory link to the actin assembly machinery of the cell. We conclude 
that miR-335 is a master regulator of tumour cell migration and invasion by 
directly targeting a plethora of genes that effectively control cell migratory 
processes.
