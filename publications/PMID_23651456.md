Proteins and lipids are heterogeneously distributed in biological membranes. The 
correct function of membrane proteins depends on spatiotemporal organization 
into defined membrane areas, called lipid domains or rafts. Lipid microdomains 
are therefore thought to assist compartmentalization of membranes. However, how 
lipid and protein assemblies are organized and whether proteins are actively 
involved in these processes remains poorly understood. We now have identified 
flotillins to be responsible for lateral segregation of defined membrane domains 
in the model organism Bacillus subtilis. We show that flotillins form large, 
dynamic assemblies that are able to influence membrane fluidity and prevent 
condensation of Laurdan stained membrane regions. Absence of flotillins in vivo 
leads to coalescence of distinct domains of high membrane order and, hence, loss 
of flotillins in the bacterial plasma-membrane reduces membrane heterogeneity. 
We show that flotillins interact with various proteins involved in protein 
secretion, cell wall metabolism, transport and membrane-related signalling 
processes. Importantly, maintenance of membrane heterogeneity is critical for 
vital cellular processes such as protein secretion.
