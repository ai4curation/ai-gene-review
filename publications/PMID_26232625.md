The mammalian Nrf/CNC proteins (Nrf1, Nrf2, Nrf3, p45 NF-E2) perform a wide 
range of cellular protective and maintenance functions. The most thoroughly 
described of these proteins, Nrf2, is best known as a regulator of antioxidant 
and xenobiotic defense, but more recently has been implicated in additional 
functions that include proteostasis and metabolic regulation. In the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans, which offers many advantages for genetic analyses, the 
Nrf/CNC proteins are represented by their ortholog SKN-1. Although SKN-1 has 
diverged in aspects of how it binds DNA, it exhibits remarkable functional 
conservation with Nrf/CNC proteins in other species and regulates many of the 
same target gene families. C. elegans may therefore have considerable predictive 
value as a discovery model for understanding how mammalian Nrf/CNC proteins 
function and are regulated in vivo. Work in C. elegans indicates that SKN-1 
regulation is surprisingly complex and is influenced by numerous growth, 
nutrient, and metabolic signals. SKN-1 is also involved in a wide range of 
homeostatic functions that extend well beyond the canonical Nrf2 function in 
responses to acute stress. Importantly, SKN-1 plays a central role in diverse 
genetic and pharmacologic interventions that promote C. elegans longevity, 
suggesting that mechanisms regulated by SKN-1 may be of conserved importance in 
aging. These C. elegans studies predict that mammalian Nrf/CNC protein functions 
and regulation may be similarly complex and that the proteins and processes that 
they regulate are likely to have a major influence on mammalian life- and 
healthspan.
