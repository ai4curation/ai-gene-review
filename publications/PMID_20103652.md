Dysregulation of tissue development pathways can contribute to cancer initiation 
and progression. In murine embryonic prostate epithelia, the transcription 
factor SOX9 is required for proper prostate development. In this study, we 
examined a role for SOX9 in prostate cancer in mouse and human. In Pten and 
Nkx3.1 mutant mice, cells with increased levels of SOX9 appeared within prostate 
epithelia at early stages of neoplasia, and higher expression correlated with 
progression at all stages of disease. In transgenic mice, SOX9 overexpression in 
prostate epithelia increased cell proliferation without inducing hyperplasia. In 
transgenic mice that were also heterozygous for mutant Pten, SOX9 overexpression 
quickened the induction of high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. In 
contrast, Sox9 attenuation led to a decrease proliferating prostate epithelia 
cells in normal and homozygous Pten mutant mice with prostate neoplasia. 
Analysis of a cohort of 880 human prostate cancer samples showed that SOX9 
expression was associated with increasing Gleason grades and higher Ki67 
staining. Our findings identify SOX9 as part of a developmental pathway that is 
reactivated in prostate neoplasia where it promotes tumor cell proliferation.
