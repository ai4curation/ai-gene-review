Cellular receptors for KSHV attachment and entry were characterized using 
tyramide signal amplification (TSA)-enhanced confocal microscopy. Integrins 
αVβ3, αVβ5 and α3β1 were detected on essentially all the actin-based cell 
surface microdomains that initially bind KSHV, while the presence of CD98 and 
heparan sulfate (HS), the putative attachment receptor, was more variable. KSHV 
bound to the same cell surface microdomains with and without HS indicating that 
initial attachment of KSHV is not dependent on HS and that receptors other than 
HS can mediate attachment. A human salivary gland (HSG) epithelial line was 
identified, which lacks αVβ3 but expresses high levels of HS, α3β1 and other 
putative KSHV receptors. These cells were resistant to KSHV binding and 
infection. Reconstitution of cell surface αVβ3 rendered HSG cells highly 
susceptible to KSHV infection, demonstrating a critical role for αVβ3 in the 
binding and entry of KSHV that is not shared with other proposed receptors.
