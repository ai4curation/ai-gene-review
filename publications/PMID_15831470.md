Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) stimulates renal branching morphogenesis via 
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38(MAPK)) and activating transcription 
factor 2 (ATF-2) (M. C. Hu, D. Wasserman, S. Hartwig, and N. D. Rosenblum, J. 
Biol. Chem. 279:12051-12059, 2004). Here, we demonstrate a novel role for 
integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in mediating renal epithelial cell morphogenesis in 
embryonic kidney explants and identify p38(MAPK) as a target of ILK signaling in 
a cell culture model of renal epithelial morphogenesis. The spatial and temporal 
expression of ILK in embryonic mouse kidney cells suggested a role in branching 
morphogenesis. Adenovirus-mediated expression of ILK stimulated and expression 
of a dominant negative ILK mutant inhibited ureteric bud branching in embryonic 
mouse kidney explants. BMP7 increased ILK kinase activity in inner medullary 
collecting duct 3 (IMCD-3) cells, and adenovirus-mediated expression of ILK 
increased IMCD-3 cell morphogenesis in a three-dimensional culture model. In 
contrast, treatment with a small molecule ILK inhibitor or expression of a 
dominant negative-acting ILK (ILK(E359K)) inhibited epithelial cell 
morphogenesis. Further, expression of ILK(E359K) abrogated BMP7-dependent 
stimulation. To investigate the role of ILK in BMP7 signaling, we showed that 
ILK overexpression increased basal and BMP7-induced levels of phospho-p38(MAPK) 
and phospho-ATF-2. Consistent with its inhibitory effects on IMCD-3 cell 
morphogenesis, expression of ILK(E359K) blocked BMP7-dependent increases in 
phospho-p38(MAPK) and phospho-ATF-2. Inhibition of p38(MAPK) activity with the 
specific inhibitor, SB203580, failed to inhibit BMP7-dependent stimulation of 
ILK activity, suggesting that ILK functions upstream of p38(MAPK) during BMP7 
signaling. We conclude that ILK functions in a BMP7/p38(MAPK)/ATF-2 signaling 
pathway and stimulates epithelial cell morphogenesis.
