Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a major transactivator of heat shock genes in 
response to stress and mediates cell protection against various harmful 
conditions. In this study, we identified the interaction of CHIP (carboxyl 
terminus of the heat shock cognate protein 70-interacting protein) with the 
N-terminus of HSF1. Using GST full-down assay, we found that CHIP directly 
interacts with C-terminal deleted HSF1 (a.a. 1-290) but not with full-length 
HSF1 under non-stressed conditions. Interestingly, interaction of CHIP with 
full-length HSF1 was induced by heat shock treatment. The structural change of 
HSF1 was observed under heat stressed conditions by CD spectra. These 
observations demonstrate the direct interaction between HSF1 and CHIP and this 
interaction requires conformational change of HSF1 by heat stress.
