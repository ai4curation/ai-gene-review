Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are transported to the 
cytoplasm for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a process 
otherwise known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Mammalian HRD1, an integral 
membrane ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates ERAD substrates, forms a large 
assembly in the ER membrane including SEL1L, a single-pass membrane protein, and 
additional components. The mechanism by which these molecules export misfolded 
proteins through the ER membrane remains unclear. Unlike Hrd3p, the homologue in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, human SEL1L is an unstable protein, which is restored 
by the association with HRD1. Here we report that the inherently unstable nature 
of the human SEL1L protein lies in its transmembrane domain, and that 
association of HRD1 with the SEL1L transmembrane domain restored its stability. 
On the other hand, we found that the SEL1L luminal domain escaped degradation, 
and inhibited the degradation of misfolded α1 -antitrypsin variant null Hong 
Kong by retaining the misfolded cargo in the ER. Overexpression of HRD1 
inhibited the degradation of unfolded secretory cargo, which was restored by the 
interaction of HRD1 with the SEL1L transmembrane domain. Hence, we propose that 
SEL1L critically regulates HRD1-mediated disposal of misfolded cargo through its 
short membrane spanning stretch.
