Alzheimer's disease pathology is characterized by the presence of neuritic 
plaques and the loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain. The underlying 
mechanisms leading to these events are unclear, but the 42-amino acid 
beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta(1-42)) is involved. Immunohistochemical studies on 
human sporadic Alzheimer's disease brains demonstrate that Abeta(1-42) and a 
neuronal pentameric cation channel, the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
(alpha7nAChR), are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in 
individual cortical neurons. Using human brain tissues and cells that 
overexpress either alpha7nAChR or amyloid precursor protein as the starting 
material, Abeta(1-42) and alpha7nAChR can be co-immunoprecipitated by the 
respective specific antibodies, suggesting that they are tightly associated. The 
formation of the alpha7nAChR.Abeta(1-42) complex can be efficiently suppressed 
by Abeta(12-28), implying that this Abeta sequence region contains the binding 
epitope. Receptor binding experiments show that Abeta(1-42) and alpha7nAChR bind 
with high affinity, and this interaction can be inhibited by alpha7nAChR 
ligands. Human neuroblastoma cells overexpressing alpha7nAChR are readily killed 
by Abeta(1-42), whereas alpha7nAChR agonists such as nicotine and epibatidine 
offered protection. Because Abeta(1-42) inhibits alpha7nAChR-dependent calcium 
activation and acetylcholine release, two processes critically involved in 
memory and cognitive functions, and the distribution of alpha7nAChR correlates 
with neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease brains, we propose that interaction 
of the alpha7nAChR and Abeta(1-42) is a pivotal mechanism involved in the 
pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.
