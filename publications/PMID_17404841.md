Peripheral nerve sheath tumors from individuals with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 
(NF1) are highly vascular and contain Schwann cells which are deficient in 
neurofibromin. This study examines the angiogenic expression profile of 
neurofibromin-deficient human Schwann cells relative to normal human Schwann 
cells, characterizing both pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. 
Conditioned media from neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cell lines was 
pro-angiogenic as evidenced by its ability to stimulate endothelial cell 
proliferation and migration. Using gene array and protein array analysis, we 
found increased expression of pro-angiogenic factors and decreased expression of 
anti-angiogenic factors in neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells relative to 
normal human Schwann cells. Neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells also showed 
increased expression of several growth factor receptors and decreased expression 
of an integrin. We conclude that neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells have 
dysregulated expression of pro-angiogenic factors, anti-angiogenic factors, 
growth factor receptors, and an integrin. These dysregulated molecules may 
contribute to the growth and progression of NF1 peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
