We demonstrate the existence of a large endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized 
multiprotein complex that is comprised of the molecular chaperones BiP; GRP94; 
CaBP1; protein disulfide isomerase (PDI); ERdj3, a recently identified ER Hsp40 
cochaperone; cyclophilin B; ERp72; GRP170; UDP-glucosyltransferase; and SDF2-L1. 
This complex is associated with unassembled, incompletely folded immunoglobulin 
heavy chains. Except for ERdj3, and to a lesser extent PDI, this complex also 
forms in the absence of nascent protein synthesis and is found in a variety of 
cell types. Cross-linking studies reveal that the majority of these chaperones 
are included in the complex. Our data suggest that this subset of ER chaperones 
forms an ER network that can bind to unfolded protein substrates instead of 
existing as free pools that assembled onto substrate proteins. It is noticeable 
that most of the components of the calnexin/calreticulin system, which include 
some of the most abundant chaperones inside the ER, are either not detected in 
this complex or only very poorly represented. This study demonstrates an 
organization of ER chaperones and folding enzymes that has not been previously 
appreciated and suggests a spatial separation of the two chaperone systems that 
may account for the temporal interactions observed in other studies.
