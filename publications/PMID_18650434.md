In heart and skeletal muscle an S100 protein family member, S100A1, binds to the 
ryanodine receptor (RyR) and promotes Ca(2+) release. Using competition binding 
assays, we further characterized this system in skeletal muscle and showed that 
Ca(2+)-S100A1 competes with Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM) for the same binding site on 
RyR1. In addition, the NMR structure was determined for Ca(2+)-S100A1 bound to a 
peptide derived from this CaM/S100A1 binding domain, a region conserved in RyR1 
and RyR2 and termed RyRP12 (residues 3616-3627 in human RyR1). Examination of 
the S100A1-RyRP12 complex revealed residues of the helical RyRP12 peptide 
(Lys-3616, Trp-3620, Lys-3622, Leu-3623, Leu-3624, and Lys-3626) that are 
involved in favorable hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with 
Ca(2+)-S100A1. These same residues were shown previously to be important for 
RyR1 binding to Ca(2+)-CaM. A model for regulating muscle contraction is 
presented in which Ca(2+)-S100A1 and Ca(2+)-CaM compete directly for the same 
binding site on the ryanodine receptor.
