Proinflammatory molecules, including IFN-gamma and IL-12, play a crucial role in 
the elimination of causative agents. To allow healing, potent anti-inflammatory 
processes are required to down-regulate the inflammatory response. In this 
study, we first show that CD47/integrin-associated protein, a ubiquitous 
multispan transmembrane protein highly expressed on T cells, interacts with 
signal-regulator protein (SIRP)-alpha, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based 
inhibition motif-containing molecule selectively expressed on myelomonocytic 
cells, and next demonstrate that this pair of molecules negatively regulates 
human T and dendritic cell (DC) function. CD47 ligation by CD47 mAb or 
L-SIRP-alpha transfectants inhibits IL-12R expression and down-regulates IL-12 
responsiveness of activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) adult T cells without affecting 
their response to IL-2. Human CD47-Fc fusion protein binds SIRP-alpha expressed 
on immature DC and mature DC. SIRP-alpha engagement by CD47-Fc prevents the 
phenotypic and functional maturation of immature DC and still inhibits cytokine 
production by mature DC. Finally, in allogeneic MLR between mDC and naive T 
cells, CD47-Fc decreases IFN-gamma production after priming and impairs the 
development of a Th1 response. Therefore, CD47 on T cells and its cognate 
receptor SIRP-alpha on DC define a novel regulatory pathway that may be involved 
in the maintenance of homeostasis by preventing the escalation of the 
inflammatory immune response.
