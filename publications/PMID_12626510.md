The SAS2 gene is involved in transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Based on its primary sequence, the Sas2 protein is predicted to be a 
member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Sas2 forms a 
complex with Sas4 and Sas5, which are required for its silencing function. Here 
we show that recombinant Sas2 has HAT activity that absolutely requires Sas4 and 
is stimulated by Sas5. The recombinant SAS complex acetylates H4 lysine 16 and 
H3 lysine 14. Furthermore, a purified SAS complex from yeast shows similar 
activity and specificity. In contrast to other MYST HATs, neither the 
recombinant nor the native SAS complex acetylated nucleosomal histones under 
conditions that were optimum for acetylating free histones. Finally, although 
the SAS subunits interact genetically and physically with Asf1, a histone 
deposition factor, association of H3 and H4 with Asf1 blocks their acetylation 
by the SAS complex, raising the possibility that the SAS HAT complex may 
acetylate free histones prior to their deposition onto DNA by Asf1 or CAF-I.
