Meiotic recombination requires the formation of programmed Spo11-dependent DNA 
double strand breaks (DSBs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Sae2 protein and 
the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex are necessary to remove the covalently attached 
Spo11 protein from the DNA ends, which are then resected by so far unknown 
nucleases. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Sae2 Ser-267 by 
cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) is required to initiate meiotic DSB resection 
by allowing Spo11 removal from DSB ends. This finding suggests that Cdk1 
activity is required for the processing of Spo11-induced DSBs, thus providing a 
mechanism for coordinating DSB resection with progression through meiotic 
prophase. Furthermore, the helicase Sgs1 and the nucleases Exo1 and Dna2 
participate in lengthening the 5'-3' resection tracts during meiosis by 
controlling a step subsequent to Spo11 removal.
