The temporal firing of replication origins throughout S phase in yeast depends 
on unknown determinants within the adjacent chromosomal environment. We 
demonstrate here that the state of histone acetylation of surrounding chromatin 
is an important regulator of temporal firing. Deletion of RPD3 histone 
deacetylase causes earlier origin firing and concurrent binding of the 
replication factor Cdc45p to origins. In addition, increased acetylation of 
histones in the vicinity of the late origin ARS1412 by recruitment of the 
histone acetyltransferase Gcn5p causes ARS1412 alone to fire earlier. These data 
indicate that histone acetylation is a direct determinant of the timing of 
origin firing.
