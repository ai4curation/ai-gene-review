The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a facultative aerobe able to adapt its 
metabolism according to the carbon substrate. The mechanisms of these 
adaptations involve at least partly the mitochondria but are not yet well 
understood. To address the possible role of protein phosphorylation event in 
their regulation, it is necessary in a first instance to determine precisely the 
phosphorylation sites that show changes depending on the carbon source. In this 
aim we performed an overall quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic study of 
isolated mitochondria extracted from yeast grown on fermentative (glucose or 
galactose) and respiratory (lactate) media. Label free quantitative analysis of 
protein accumulation revealed significant variation of 176 mitochondrial 
proteins including 108 proteins less accumulated in glucose medium than in 
lactate and galactose media. We also showed that the responses to galactose and 
glucose are not similar. Stable isotope dimethyl labeling allowed the 
quantitative comparison of phosphorylation levels between the different growth 
conditions. This study enlarges significantly the map of yeast mitochondrial 
phosphosites as 670 phosphorylation sites were identified, of which 214 were new 
and quantified. Above all, we showed that 90 phosphosites displayed a 
significant variation according to the medium and that variation of 
phosphorylation level is site-dependent.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This proteomic and phosphoproteomic study is the first 
extensive study providing quantitative data on phosphosites responses to 
different carbon substrates independent of the variations of protein quantities 
in the yeast S. cerevisiae mitochondria. The significant changes observed in the 
level of phosphorylation according to the carbon substrate open the way to the 
study of the regulation of mitochondrial proteins by phosphorylation in 
fermentative and respiratory media. In addition, the identification of a large 
number of new phosphorylation sites show that the characterization of 
mitochondrial phosphoproteome is not yet completed.
