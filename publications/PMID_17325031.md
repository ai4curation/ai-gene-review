The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase 
mediating targeted proteolysis through ubiquitination of protein substrates to 
control the progression of mitosis. The APC/C recognizes its substrates through 
two adapter proteins, Cdc20 and Cdh1, which contain similar C-terminal domains 
composed of seven WD-40 repeats believed to be involved in interacting with 
their substrates. During the transition from metaphase to anaphase, APC/C-Cdc20 
mediates the ubiquitination of securin and cyclin B1, allowing the activation of 
separase and the onset of anaphase and mitotic exit. APC/C-Cdc20 and APC/C-Cdh1 
have overlapping substrates. It is unclear whether they are redundant for 
mitosis. Using a gene-trapping approach, we have obtained mice which lack Cdc20 
function. These mice show failed embryogenesis. The embryos were arrested in 
metaphase at the two-cell stage with high levels of cyclin B1, indicating an 
essential role of Cdc20 in mitosis that is not redundant with that of Cdh1. 
Interestingly, Cdc20 and securin double mutant embryos could not maintain the 
metaphase arrest, suggesting a role of securin in preventing mitotic exit.
