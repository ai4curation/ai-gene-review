Translation regulation largely occurs during initiation, which features ribosome 
assembly onto mRNAs and selection of the translation start site. Short, upstream 
ORFs (uORFs) located in the 5'-leader of the mRNA can be selected for 
translation. Multiple transcripts associated with stress amelioration are 
preferentially translated through uORF-mediated mechanisms during activation of 
the integrated stress response (ISR) in which phosphorylation of the α subunit 
of eIF2 results in a coincident global reduction in translation initiation. This 
review presents key features of uORFs that serve to optimize translational 
control that is essential for regulation of cell fate in response to 
environmental stresses.
