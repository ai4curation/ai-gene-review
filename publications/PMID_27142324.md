The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a meiosis-specific scaffold that links 
homologous chromosomes from end to end during meiotic prophase and is required 
for the formation of meiotic crossovers. Assembly of SC components is regulated 
by a combination of associated nonstructural proteins and post-translational 
modifications, such as SUMOylation, which together coordinate the timing between 
homologous chromosome pairing, double-strand-break formation and recombination. 
In addition, transcriptional and translational control mechanisms ensure the 
timely disassembly of the SC after crossover resolution and before chromosome 
segregation at anaphase I.
