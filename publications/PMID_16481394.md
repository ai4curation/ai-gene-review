We define here a previously unrecognized structural element close to the heart 
muscle plasma membrane at the intercalated disc where the myofibrils lead into 
the adherens junction. At this location, the plasma membrane is extensively 
folded. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy reveal a 
spectrin-rich domain at the apex of the folds. These domains occur at the axial 
level of what would be the final Z-disc of the terminal sarcomere in the 
myofibril, although there is no Z-disc-like structure there. However, a sharp 
transitional boundary lies between the myofibrillar I-band and intercalated disc 
thin filaments, identifiable by the presence of Z-disc proteins, alpha-actinin, 
and N-terminal titin. This allows for the usual elastic positioning of the 
A-band in the final sarcomere, whereas the transduction of the contractile force 
normally associated with the Z-disc is transferred to the adherens junctions at 
the plasma membrane. The axial conjunction of the transitional junction with the 
spectrin-rich domains suggests a mechanism for direct communication between 
intercalated disc and contractile apparatus. In particular, it provides a means 
for sarcomeres to be added to the ends of the cells during growth. This is of 
particular relevance to understanding myocyte elongation in dilated 
cardiomyopathy.

Abstract

We define here a previously unrecognized structural element close to the heart muscle plasma membrane at the intercalated disc where the myofibrils lead into the adherens junction. At this location, the plasma membrane is extensively folded. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy reveal a spectrin-rich domain at the apex of the folds. These domains occur at the axial level of what would be the final Z-disc of the terminal sarcomere in the myofibril, although there is no Z-disc-like structure there. However, a sharp transitional boundary lies between the myofibrillar I-band and intercalated disc thin filaments, identifiable by the presence of Z-disc proteins, α-actinin, and N-terminal titin. This allows for the usual elastic positioning of the A-band in the final sarcomere, whereas the transduction of the contractile force normally associated with the Z-disc is transferred to the adherens junctions at the plasma membrane. The axial conjunction of the transitional junction with the spectrin-rich domains suggests a mechanism for direct communication between intercalated disc and contractile apparatus. In particular, it provides a means for sarcomeres to be added to the ends of the cells during growth. This is of particular relevance to understanding myocyte elongation in dilated cardiomyopathy.

INTRODUCTION

Mechanical coupling and chemical communication between cardiac muscle cells are encompassed by a structure called the intercalated disc (ID). It is known that mutations or deficiencies in its constituent proteins give rise to cardiomyopathy or other fatal defects. The ID is a highly involuted element located at the distal ends of the bipolar muscle cells. During cardiac contractions, the ID must have an adhesive function while also transmitting and coordinating essential signaling events. To fulfill these roles the ID is highly organized structurally. Thus, complex ID domains alternate to afford both mechanical strength and electrical and chemical communication across the membranes of adjacent cells. There are a number of reports of heart disease associated with structural change in the ID (for a review, see Perriard et al ., 2003 ). For example, in mice with inactivated expression of the intercalated disc protein N-cadherin, the embryo dies ( Radice et al ., 1997 ). In contrast, knockout of expression of the β-spectrin binding protein muscle LIM protein (MLP) leads to overexpression of some of the ID proteins, especially those of the adherens junction, and results in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) ( Arber et al ., 1997 ; Ehler et al ., 2001 ). This holds also for the tropomodulin overexpressing transgenic mouse ( Sussman et al ., 1998 ; Ehler et al ., 2001 ).

In the light microscope in longitudinal sections, the ID is seen as a transverse dense line of mass with occasional steps at irregular intervals (for review, see Forbes and Sperelakis, 1985 ). At higher magnification in the electron microscope, the membrane on the transverse treads describes complex folds, whereas the risers are straight ( Figure 1 ). In three dimensions, the treads may be likened to an egg box with troughs and peaks where the cells interdigitate. Within this complicated arrangement three specialized membrane-associated regions have been described: adherens junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. In addition, there are apparently unspecialized regions of no known function. As seen in Figure 1B , at the gap junction (g) which mostly occurs in the riser regions, the plasma membranes of the two adjacent cells come close together with an increased density. The desmosome (d) is usually seen as a dense but well-ordered structure with extra mass in the interstitial gap between the membranes. The membrane here is usually straight and most frequently occurs in nonfibrillar parts of the ID, e.g., where there are stacks of mitochondria. Finally, the adherens junctions (a) are found at the end of myofibrils and are characterized by considerable extra, somewhat fuzzy, mass close to the plasma membrane (known as the cytoplasmic plaque). The ID at this point has been termed the interfibrillar region ( Forbes and Sperelakis, 1985 ), and it is this region with which we are concerned here.

In support of the structural complexity, a wide array of proteins have been associated with the ID by immunofluorescence and other means, many of which are located in the specialized membrane junctions. The locations and functions of other proteins are uncertain. One such protein is the membrane-bound protein, spectrin ( Messina and Lemanski, 1989 ; Isayama et al ., 1993 ; Bennett et al ., 2004 ; Baines and Pinder, 2005 ), a heterodimeric (αβ) elongated actin-binding protein (for review, see Bennett and Baines, 2001 ). The dimers associate head-to-head to form tetramers that bind to filamentous actin at their distal ends. The resulting network is the basis of the elasticity and shear-resistance of the erythrocyte membrane. In the erythrocyte, this meshwork, together with a number of other proteins, forms a dynamic membrane-associated cytoskeleton that helps the cell withstand the forces experienced in its passage through capillaries. How this relates to the role of spectrin in the intercalated disc is not clear, but it implies the presence of a type of domain other than the previously described junctions. Whatever its role, spectrin's importance in cardiac tissue has been clearly demonstrated; in mouse a null mutation in the βII-spectrin gene produces nonviable animals that die in midgestation from defects that include heart malformation ( Tang et al ., 2003 ).

Spectrin has two α-chain and five β-chain isoforms in vertebrates (for review, see Bennett and Baines, 2001 ), four of which, αI and βI (the erythrocyte isoforms) and αII and βII (also known as α- and β-fodrin), have been identified in heart. They distribute differentially in cardiac muscle, although the precise location of each is not clear (for review, see Baines and Pinder, 2005 ). All but βII-spectrin are found on the lateral plasma membrane, but both βII-spectrin splice variants occur in the cardiomyocyte at the ID, within the cell at the Z-disc level, and weakly elsewhere ( Hayes et al ., 2000 ; Baines and Pinder, 2005 ). Furthermore, we recently also found the αII isoform at the ID and within the cell at the edges of the myofibrils, mainly at the Z-disc level ( Bennett et al ., 2004 ). The immunofluorescence staining of αII-spectrin at the ID is much stronger than that at the Z-disc level. Immunogold labeling showed it to be associated with the transverse pleated treads of the ID ( Bennett et al ., 2004 ).

The association of spectrin with the Z-disc of the myofibrils within cardiomyocytes suggests that there may be a similar association at or near the ID. However, little is known about the junction between the myofibrillar structure and the ID. It is striking that the fibrils maintain their ordered sarcomeric arrangement in a region adjacent to the apparently unordered ID ( Figure 1 ). This is in the absence of a terminal Z-disc. It is clear that the thin actin filaments leave the terminal half-sarcomere and pass into the ID, where they insert into the adherens junctions at the membrane ( Forbes and Sperelakis, 1985 ; Yamaguchi et al ., 1988 ). The longitudinal tension generated by the myofibrils is evidently transmitted across the cell membranes at these junctions. It is in this interfibrillary region that the ID membrane is most convoluted. Furthermore, the apices of the folds are approximately at the axial level that the Z-disc would have occupied, had it been present, implying a likely interaction between the myofibril and an ID membrane domain.

We have investigated the distribution and position of spectrin within the ID as well as its relationship to the known membrane junctional complexes, in particular the adherens junction, using immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. We find that although the components of the adherens junctions, such as vinculin, can be considered to be distributed uniformly over much of the ID membrane, spectrin is confined to the axial extremes of the ID where it lies on the outer convex folds of the membrane. To determine the relationship of cardiac ID spectrin to the myofibrillar structure, we have labeled sarcomeric and Z-disc proteins and find we can accurately define the junction between the myofibrillar thin filaments and the ID filaments. From this, we define the presence of a new subcellular structure that we have named the “transitional junction,” whose axial position is closely correlated with that of spectrin. The transitional junction also acts as an anchor point for titin and hence for maintaining the ordered array of the terminal A-band.
