The NuA4/TIP60 acetyltransferase complex is a key regulator of genome expression 
and stability. Here we identified MBTD1 as a stable subunit of the complex, and 
we reveal that, via a histone reader domain for H4K20me1/2, MBTD1 allows TIP60 
to associate with specific gene promoters and to promote the repair of DNA 
double-strand breaks by homologous recombination. It was previously suggested 
that TIP60-dependent acetylation of H4 regulates binding of the non-homologous 
end joining factor 53BP1, which engages chromatin through simultaneous binding 
of H4K20me2 and H2AK15ub. We find that the TIP60 complex regulates association 
of 53BP1 partly by competing for H4K20me2 and by regulating H2AK15ub. 
Ubiquitylation of H2AK15 by RNF168 inhibits chromatin acetylation by TIP60, 
while this residue can be acetylated by TIP60 in vivo, blocking its 
ubiquitylation. Altogether, these results uncover an intricate mechanism 
orchestrated by the TIP60 complex to regulate 53BP1-dependent repair through 
competitive bivalent binding and modification of chromatin.

INTRODUCTION

Histone post-translational modifications (PTM) act as key regulators of chromatin organization, mainly by serving as docking sites for chromatin-binding factors ( Zentner and Henikoff, 2013 ). Acetylation of lysine residues also destabilizes the DNA-histone and histone-histone interactions, leading to a more open and dynamic chromatin organization ( Steunou et al., 2014 ). It is catalyzed by lysine acetyltransferases such as the mammalian NuA4/TIP60 complex, a 1.5 MDa multiprotein platform of at least 16 subunits, highly conserved from yeast to human ( Steunou et al., 2014 ). In vivo, TIP60’s major acetylation targets are lysines (K) 5, 8 and 12 on nucleosomal H4, H2AK5, histone variants H2AZ and H2AX, as well as non-histone substrates such as p53 ( Steunou et al., 2014 ). The TIP60 complex is a key regulator of cell homeostasis, response to stress, as well as maintenance and renewal of stem cells ( Avvakumov and Cote, 2007 ; Voss and Thomas, 2009 ). It functions as an activator of transcription and is implicated in the regulation of key tumor suppressors and oncogenes such as p53, Rb and Myc ( Avvakumov and Cote, 2007 ; Jeong et al., 2011 ; Kim et al., 2010 ; Ravens et al., 2015 ). Notably, Tip60/KAT5 is a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor gene frequently mutated or deregulated in cancer ( Voss and Thomas, 2009 ).

The NuA4/TIP60 complex also plays a key part in repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) ( Rossetto et al., 2010 ). This type of DNA damage is particularly harmful as it can lead to genomic instability and loss of genetic material. Phosphorylation of Ser139 on the H2AX variant (γ-H2AX) that occurs in response to DSB initiates a cascade of signaling events and serves as a platform for recruitment of DNA repair mediators ( Soria et al., 2012 ). Components of the NuA4/TIP60 complex are also rapidly recruited to DSB to acetylate H4, H2A and H2AX, thereby facilitating chromatin opening ( Courilleau et al., 2012 ; Rossetto et al., 2010 ; Soria et al., 2012 ; Xu et al., 2010 ). Additionally, the Tip60/KAT5 acetyltransferase has been implicated in DNA damage signaling via direct acetylation and activation of ATM and inhibition of 53BP1 binding to damaged chromatin ( Dantuma and van Attikum, 2016 ; Panier and Boulton, 2014 ; Tang et al., 2013 ). Finally, acetylation of γ-H2AX by TIP60 has been proposed to facilitate chromatin dynamics during and after DNA repair ( Soria et al., 2012 ).

In higher eukaryotes, DSB are primarily repaired by one of two key pathways: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) based on the direct re-ligation of the DNA ends, and homologous recombination (HR), in which a sister chromatid is used as a template to correct damaged DNA. These two pathways are regulated by 53BP1 – a keystone of the chromatin-induced signaling pathway and a key deciding factor between HR and NHEJ ( Panier and Boulton, 2014 ). Recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA breaks inhibits HR by blocking resection of the DNA ends and directs the repair choice to NHEJ ( Panier and Boulton, 2014 ).

53BP1 is a bivalent chromatin reader that binds H4K20 methylation and H2AK13/15 ubiquitylation via its tandem Tudor-UDR domain. These interactions are required both for recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB and for subsequent signaling ( Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013 ). Since methylation of H4K20 is widely distributed in the genome, competition for H4K20me2 by JMJD2A and L3MBTL1 has been proposed to block genome-wide 53BP1 recruitment ( Panier and Boulton, 2014 ). By contrast, ubiquitylation of H2AK13/15 is actively mediated by E3 ubiquitin-ligases RNF8/168 in response to damage ( Mattiroli et al., 2012 ). Interestingly, recent studies directly implicate histone H4 acetylation in regulating 53BP1 during DNA damage response (DDR) and propose that TIP60-mediated H4K16ac impacts the ability of 53BP1 to bind neighboring H4K20me2 ( Panier and Boulton, 2014 ; Tang et al., 2013 ).

In this study, we describe a newly identified stable subunit of the human NuA4/TIP60 acetyltransferase complex. MBTD1 contains MBT domains that recognize H4K20me and allow TIP60 to bind a number of genes, thus playing a role in regulation of transcription. Moreover, during DDR, MBTD1 regulates binding of 53BP1 at DNA lesions, likely through targeting the same H4K20me2 mark. In addition, we characterize an H2AK15 acetylation/ubiquitylation regulatory switch that further highlights the opposite functions of 53BP1 and TIP60 at DNA breaks. While RNF168-dependent H2AK15ub interferes with TIP60 binding to chromatin and blocks acetylation of H4, we demonstrate that H2AK15 can be acetylated by TIP60, inhibiting its ubiquitylation. We propose a new model in which TIP60 acts as a key regulator of DSB repair pathway choice, counterbalancing the role played by 53BP1 through incompatible bivalent interactions with chromatin near DNA lesions. Taken together, our results provide interesting insights into TIP60 function during transcription and DNA repair, and reveal a novel interplay between histone methylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation.

DISCUSSION

Activities of the multifunctional TIP60/NuA4 complex are modulated by a number of internal motifs capable of reading histone marks. Subunits of the complex contain domains that individually are capable of binding histone PTM in distinct genomic contexts ( Fig. 7C ). Thus, it is crucial to consider the TIP60 complex as a whole in order to fully understand any of its functions. Furthermore, conducting experiments in conditions close to physiological is essential as true histone target specificity is often only achieved with native modifying or remodeling complexes and their bona fide chromatin substrates ( Lalonde et al., 2014 ).

In this study, we identified MBTD1 as a new stable stoichiometric subunit of the TIP60 complex, with which it appears to be exclusively associated. This protein can read histone PTM through its quadruple MBT repeat and displays a strong affinity for H4K20me1/2 (K D 7-13 μM) ( Eryilmaz et al., 2009 ). Our discovery of the physical association between MBTD1 and TIP60 can reconcile contradictory observations about the role of H4K20me1 and the enzyme responsible for its deposition, SETD8. Prior studies had predominantly linked them to gene repression. This conclusion had been reached mainly through work on the L3MBTL1/2 transcription repressors that also contain H4K20me1/2-specific MBT repeats ( van Nuland and Gozani, 2015 ). Inexplicably, ChIP-seq analysis of H4K20me1 had demonstrated a relatively high occupancy of this histone mark within bodies of actively transcribed genes ( Ernst et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis had uncovered a frequent co-occurrence of transcriptionally permissive acetylated lysines and K20me1/2 within the tails of the same histone molecules ( Pesavento et al., 2008 ). Our present discovery of the MBTD1-TIP60 association finally establishes a clear link between H4K20me1/2 and transcription activation. It will be interesting to investigate whether this connection is responsible for the role of H4K20me1 in local regulation of RNA polymerase II pausing through targeted H4 acetylation ( Kapoor-Vazirani and Vertino, 2014 ).

Both the TIP60 complex and H4K20me are important players in the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks. H4K20 methylation at DSB is rapidly recognized by the double Tudor domain of 53BP1 ( Botuyan et al., 2006 ). Other H4K20me readers, L3MBTL1 and JMJD2A/KDM4A, are actively displaced to allow 53BP1 to bind damaged chromatin ( Panier and Boulton, 2014 ). Acetylation of the H4 tail by Tip60/KAT5 has been hypothesized to disrupt the interaction of 53BP1’s tandem Tudor domain with the neighboring H4K20me2 ( Panier and Boulton, 2014 ; Tang et al., 2013 ). Interestingly, budding yeast KAT5/Esa1 performs an opposite function to that of the 53BP1 homolog Rad9 in controlling the cell cycle upon DNA damage ( Javaheri et al., 2006 ). However, budding yeast lacks H4K20 methylation, which may explain the absence of an MBTD1 homolog in the yeast NuA4 complex.

Given the above, it was intriguing to investigate a possible role of MBTD1 in the cellular response to DNA damage. Our results presented demonstrate that MBTD1 can displace 53BP1 for the H4K20me2 mark in vitro and affect the formation and stability of 53BP1 foci after DNA damage in vivo . MBTD1 and TIP60 regulate the disappearance of these foci at a later time-point after damage – a process that mirrors TIP60’s role in removing γ-H2AX foci within a similar time frame. These activities are clearly important for repair of DSB by homologous recombination, as TIP60 is required for efficient loading of Rad51 ( Courilleau et al., 2012 ; Murr et al., 2006 ). Thus, our observations favor the model in which the TIP60 complex promotes HR repair over NHEJ by decreasing 53BP1 occupancy on damaged chromatin, thereby relieving inhibition of DNA end resection and homology search ( Panier and Boulton, 2014 ; Tang et al., 2013 ).

We show that the EPC1 subunit of TIP60 is responsible for the direct association of MBTD1 with the complex. In addition, EPC1 interacts with the N-terminal tail of histone H2A in the nucleosome, which is critical for H4 acetylation by TIP60 ( Huang and Tan, 2013 ; Lalonde et al., 2013 ). This led us to investigate whether TIP60 and 53BP1 also vie for chromatin interaction via the H2A tail. DNA damage-induced ubiquitylation of H2A on K13 and K15 by RNF168 is critical for 53BP1 binding through its UDR domain, as well as for signaling ( Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013 ). In this study, we show that while H2AK15ub nucleosomes are refractory to modification by TIP60, acetylation of H2AK15 is induced in vivo in response to DNA damage. This ubiquitylation/acetylation switch is clearly a powerful mechanism of regulating 53BP1 binding and TIP60-dependent histone H4 acetylation. Taken together, our observations of the events surrounding H4K20me demonstrate distinctly incompatible binding and opposing functions of 53BP1 and TIP60/NuA4 on nucleosomes near DNA lesions ( Fig. 7D ).

53BP1 is a bivalent chromatin reader, binding both H2AK15ub and H4K20me2 via its Tudor and UDR regions. Strikingly, TIP60 targets the same two nucleosome surfaces through MBTD1 and EPC1. If TIP60 gains the upper hand in binding nucleosomes near DNA breaks, local acetylation of the H4 tail further blocks 53BP1 binding, as proposed previously ( Tang et al., 2013 ). Naturally, activities of deacetylases and de-ubiquitinases of H2AK15 are critical in shifing the balance between 53BP1 and TIP60. This is consistent with the established model in which HDAC1/2 promote end joining of DSB, likely by negating the activity of TIP60 ( Miller et al., 2010 ). Importantly, acetylation of H2AK15 after DNA damage is induced throughout the nucleus and not only in the vicinity of DSBs. We hypothesize that this may serve to block promiscuous ubiquitylation of H2A by RNF168, which is induced as part of the repair process, restricting it to the vicinity of DNA lesions ( Gudjonsson et al., 2012 ). Likewise, increased levels of H2AK15ac in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle may be linked to homologous recombination, but may also block unwanted DSB repair during mitosis ( Orthwein et al., 2014 ).

Overall, the identification of MBTD1 as a stable subunit of the TIP60 complex raises several interesting questions. The putative oncogenicity of several translocations or truncations of EPC1, found in uterine sarcoma and leukemia, could be partly explained by the loss of MBTD1 from the complex ( Avvakumov and Cote, 2007 ). It will also be very interesting to investigate the function of MBTD1 in gene regulation and chromatin dynamics vis-a-vis other H4K20me readers like the L3MBTL1/2 repressors. Furthermore, both 53BP1 and L3MBTL1 can bind specific mono- and di-methylated lysines on tumor suppressors p53, thereby regulating its function ( Kachirskaia et al., 2008 ; West et al., 2010 ). Thus, it will be important to examine whether MBTD1 can also target such non-histone proteins and counteract their inhibition. Finally, 53BP1 itself is acetylated in vivo on multiple lysine residues, including those near the UDR domain and within the dimerization domain ( phosphosite.org ). Therefore, it will be intriguing to determine whether these modifications are carried out by TIP60 to further regulate 53BP1 function in the cellular response to DNA damage.

In conclusion, our findings reveal new insights about TIP60 composition, architecture and function during transcription and DNA repair. Notably, our data further uncover the role in repair pathway choice played by TIP60 through multivalent interactions and chromatin modifications at DNA breaks. This study highlights the intricate crosstalk between acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation of chromatin in proper coordination of DSB repair. Retention of 53BP1 on damaged chromatin appears to be the key element in the decision between HR and NHEJ. Therefore, the incompatibility between TIP60 and 53BP1 is instrumental in the temporal and spatial orchestration of DSB repair, which relies on complex and finely modulated interactions between a variety of chromatin post-translational modifications.
