The acquisition of invasiveness is characteristic of tumor progression. Numerous 
genetic changes are associated with metastasis, but the mechanism by which a 
cell becomes invasive remains unclear. Expression of p85β, a regulatory subunit 
of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, markedly increases in advanced carcinoma, but its 
mode of action is unknown. We postulated that p85β might facilitate cell 
invasion. We show that p85β localized at cell adhesions in complex with focal 
adhesion kinase and enhanced stability and maturation of cell adhesions. In 
addition, p85β induced development at cell adhesions of an F-actin core that 
extended several microns into the cell z-axis resembling the skeleton of 
invadopodia. p85β lead to F-actin polymerization at cell adhesions by recruiting 
active Cdc42/Rac at these structures. In accordance with p85β function in 
invadopodium-like formation, p85β levels increased in metastatic melanoma and 
p85β depletion reduced invadopodium formation and invasion. These results show 
that p85β enhances invasion by inducing cell adhesion development into 
invadopodia-like structures explaining the metastatic potential of tumors with 
increased p85β levels.
