Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) has an essential role in heterochromatin 
formation and mitotic progression through its interaction with various proteins. 
We have identified a unique HP1alpha-binding protein, POGZ (pogo transposable 
element-derived protein with zinc finger domain), using an advanced proteomics 
approach. Proteins generally interact with HP1 through a PxVxL (where x is any 
amino-acid residue) motif; however, POGZ was found to bind to HP1alpha through a 
zinc-finger-like motif. Binding by POGZ, mediated through its zinc-finger-like 
motif, competed with PxVxL proteins and destabilized the HP1alpha-chromatin 
interaction. Depletion experiments confirmed that the POGZ HP1-binding domain is 
essential for normal mitotic progression and dissociation of HP1alpha from 
mitotic chromosome arms. Furthermore, POGZ is required for the correct 
activation and dissociation of Aurora B kinase from chromosome arms during M 
phase. These results reveal POGZ as an essential protein that links HP1alpha 
dissociation with Aurora B kinase activation during mitosis.
