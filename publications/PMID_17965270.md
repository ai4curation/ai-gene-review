CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) are two 
major regulators of light signaling in plants. Here, we identify SALT TOLERANCE 
HOMOLOG2 (STH2) as a gene that interacts genetically with both of these key 
regulators. STH2 encodes a B-box-containing protein that interacts physically 
with HY5 in yeast and in plant cells. Whereas STH2 is uniformly nuclear by 
itself, it shows a COP1-dependent localization to speckles when coexpressed with 
COP1. We identified two independent T-DNA insertion lines in STH2. Both alleles 
are hyposensitive to blue, red, and far-red light. The sth2 mutant, like hy5, 
shows an enhanced number of lateral roots and accumulates less anthocyanin. 
Analysis of double mutants between sth2 and hy5 indicates that STH2 has both 
HY5-dependent and -independent functions. Furthermore, besides partially 
suppressing the hypocotyl phenotype of dark-grown cop1 alleles, sth2 also 
suppresses the reduced number of lateral roots and high anthocyanin levels in 
light-grown cop1 alleles. Interestingly, we found that STH2 can activate 
transcription. Transient transfection assays in protoplasts using a LUC reporter 
driven by the chalcone isomerase promoter show that the B-boxes in STH2 and a 
functional G-box element in the promoter are required for this activity. In 
conclusion, we have identified STH2, a B-box protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, as 
a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis and report that the B-box domain 
plays a direct role in activating transcription in plants.

INTRODUCTION

Throughout their life cycle, plants continuously monitor the quality, quantity, duration, and direction of light in order to optimize their growth and development according to the ambient light environment. The light is sensed by wavelength-specific photoreceptors, of which at least four classes have been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana . The phytochromes PHYA to PHYE perceive red/far-red light (600 to 750 nm); the cryptochromes CRY1 to CRY3 and the phototropins PHOT1 and PHOT2 detect blue and UV-A light (320 to 500 nm), respectively; and UV-B light (282 to 320 nm) is perceived by a yet uncharacterized photoreceptor ( Sullivan and Deng, 2003 ). A dramatic example of light signaling can be seen when a seedling emerges from soil into the light. During this developmental transition, light signaling releases a developmental arrest upon which autotrophic growth and adult development can commence. In no or low light, the seedlings develop long hypocotyls with undifferentiated cotyledons forming an apical hook, whereas in light, the seedling undergoes photomorphogeneis or deetiolation, which is characterized by the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon expansion, and greening, leading to the acquisition of photosynthetic capacity. This light-induced developmental transition is primarily mediated by the phytochromes, CRY1, and CRY2 and is accompanied by a massive transcriptional reprogramming. Microarray analysis revealed that up to one-third of the genes in Arabidopsis showed changes in expression between seedlings grown in the dark and the light ( Ma et al., 2001 ). Studies performed on seedlings grown in monochromatic far-red, red, or blue light found that a large fraction of the early-affected genes are transcription factors ( Tepperman et al., 2001 , 2004 ; Jiao et al., 2003 ). It has been proposed that activation of a photoreceptor initiates a transcriptional cascade by regulating a group of master transcription factors that, in turn, control the transcriptional reprogramming during photomorphogenesis ( Tepperman et al., 2001 , 2004 ).

Genetic screens have identified several transcription factors acting as positive or negative regulators downstream of a specific photoreceptor or set of transcription factors. Studies of far-red light–dependent photomorphogenensis have revealed FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1) and FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3), both of which are novel transposase-related putative transcription factors ( Hudson et al., 1999 ; Wang and Deng, 2002 ; Hudson and Quail, 2003 ), whereas LONG AFTER FAR-RED LIGHT1 (LAF1) is homologous with R2R3-MYB transcription factors ( Ballesteros et al., 2001 ). The developmental defects of loss-of-function mutations in far1 , fhy3 , and laf1 are specific to PHYA-mediated photomorphogenesis in response to far-red light. Mutations in LONG HYPOCOTYLS IN FAR-RED LIGHT1 (HFR1), encoding a basic helix-loop-helix protein, show similar light-hyposensitive phenotypes in both far-red and blue light, suggesting a role in both PHYA and CRY signaling ( Fairchild et al., 2000 ; Duek and Fankhauser, 2003 ). Two Dof family transcription factors, COGWHEEL1 (COG1) and OBF4 BINDING PROTEIN3 (OBP3), are involved in red light signaling: COG1 acts as a negative regulator in both red and far-red light ( Park et al., 2003 ), whereas OBP3 has both positive and negative roles in PHYB and CRY1 signaling pathways ( Ward et al., 2005 ). In addition the identification of MYC2, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, and GBF1, a basic domain/leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, revealed that these two factors act as a repressor of blue and far-red light–mediated deetiolation and as a negative and positive regulator of blue light signaling, respectively ( Yadav et al., 2005 ; Mallappa et al., 2006 ).

The regulation of protein stability has been found to play a key role in the signaling pathways downstream of the photoreceptors. Mutations in a group of at least 10 genes, the COP/DET/FUS genes, result in constitutive photomorphogenesis ( Wei and Deng, 1996 ). The molecular characterization of the COP/DET/FUS proteins suggests that most, if not all, act in a proteolytic pathway aimed at degrading photomorphogenesis-promoting factors in the absence of light ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ). CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, acts in concert with SPA proteins as a dark-dependent repressor of photomorphogenesis ( Saijo et al., 2003 ). The COP1 repression is partly mediated through ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the transcription factors ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), HYH, LAF1, and HFR1 ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ; Holm et al., 2002 ; Seo et al., 2003 ; Yang et al., 2005 ). Furthermore, COP1 was found to interact with several photoreceptors, such as phyA, phyB, cry1, and cry2 ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ; Shalitin et al., 2002 ; Seo et al., 2004 ), and can target some of them for degradation, as in the case of phyA ( Seo et al., 2004 ), or regulate its abundance, as in cry2 ( Shalitin et al., 2002 ).

The bZIP transcription factor HY5 is a well-characterized target of COP1 regulation. Mutations in HY5 result in an elongated hypocotyl in all light conditions, suggesting that HY5 acts downstream of all photoreceptors ( Koornneef et al., 1980 ; Oyama et al., 1997 ; Ang et al., 1998 ; Ulm et al., 2004 ). The hy5 mutant also has defects in lateral root formation, secondary thickening in roots, and chlorophyll and anthocyanin accumulation ( Oyama et al., 1997 ; Holm et al., 2002 ). Recently, it was shown that HY5 plays a role in both auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways ( Cluis et al., 2004 ; Sibout et al., 2006 ; Vandenbussche et al., 2007 ), suggesting that HY5 might be a common intermediate in light and hormone signaling pathways. In vitro DNA–protein interaction studies revealed that HY5 binds specifically to the G-box present in the promoters of several light-inducible genes, such as chalcone synthase (CHS) and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit (RbcS1A) ( Ang et al., 1998 ; Chattopadhyay et al., 1998 ). Recently, a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation technique in combination with a whole-genome tiling array (ChIP-chip) revealed that HY5 binds to promoter regions of a large number of annotated genes ( Lee et al., 2007 ). HY5 appears to mediate both the upregulation and downregulation of gene expression by light. Most of the genes subject to HY5 regulation are included among the genes regulated by light and constitute ∼20% of all light-regulated genes ( Ma et al., 2001 ). Interestingly, Lee et al. (2007) found that >60% of the early-induced genes by PhyA and PhyB ( Tepperman et al., 2001 , 2004 ) are HY5 binding targets, which suggests that HY5 is high in the hierarchy of the transcriptional cascade during photomorphogenesis. However, HY5 binding is not sufficient for transcriptional regulation. HY5 was found to be constitutively bound to the promoters of both light-regulated genes such as CHS and RbcS1A and circadian regulators such as CCA1, LHY, TOC1, and ELF4, suggesting that additional factors are required for HY5-dependent transcriptional regulation ( Lee et al., 2007 ).

We previously identified three B-box–containing proteins, COL3, STH (now renamed STH1), and STO, that are able to interact with COP1 ( Holm et al., 2001 ; Datta et al., 2006 ). We found that COL3 acts as a positive regulator of red light signaling ( Datta et al., 2006 ), and functional SPA proteins were recently found to be important for the stability of the B-box–containing protein CONSTANS ( Laubinger et al., 2006 ). These proteins all contain N-terminal tandem repeated B-boxes. The B-box is a Zn 2+ -ligating domain constituted of conserved Cys and His residues that has been proposed to be a protein interaction domain ( Borden et al., 1995 ; Torok and Etkin, 2001 ); however, no interaction partners or functions have been described for this domain. There are 32 B-box–containing proteins in Arabidopsis , and although they are listed as transcription factors by Riechmann et al. (2000) , the molecular function of the B-box domain is still poorly understood.

Here, we identify SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG2 (STH2), a B-box–containing protein that interacts physically with HY5 and interacts genetically with both HY5 and COP1. We found that the B-boxes in STH2 are required for interaction with HY5. We present evidence for the role of STH2 in light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, lateral root formation, and anthocyanin accumulation. We also describe the genetic interaction of sth2 with hy5 and cop1 . All of the phenotypic data indicate a positive role of STH2 in photomorphogenic development. Finally, we provide functional data demonstrating that STH2 can activate transcription and show that the B-boxes in STH2 and a functional G-box element in the promoter are required for this activity. We propose that STH2 interacts with HY5 through the B-box, thus providing transactivating potential to the HY5 transcription factor.

DISCUSSION

We demonstrate that the STH2 protein interacts with HY5 in yeast and living plant cells and that STH2 shows a COP1-dependent localization to nuclear speckles. To further analyze STH2 , we identified independent alleles in the Col-0 and L er accessions. While sth2-1 is a null allele, the sth2-2 allele retains residual STH2 expression. The T-DNA insertion in sth2-2 is in the third exon and deletes the last 117 codons of STH2 . The STH2 transcript in sth2-2 is thus both truncated and reduced in level. Furthermore, both alleles showed very similar phenotypes, strongly supporting the notion that the phenotypes are a result of loss and reduction of STH2 expression. The characterization of these alleles revealed hyposensitivity to blue, red, and far-red light and reduced accumulation of photoprotective anthocyanin pigments. Furthermore, sth2 showed an enhanced number of emerged lateral roots. The phenotypes of sth2 firmly establish STH2 as a positive regulator of light signaling during seedling photomorphogenesis and indicate that STH2 is involved also in root system architecture. Interestingly, in all conditions in which we found phenotypes in the sth2 alleles, the effect was similar, albeit weaker, than what is seen in hy5 alleles, except for the lateral root phenotype, suggesting that STH2 may be involved in HY5 - and/or COP1 -regulated processes.

Conclusion

We demonstrate here that the STH2 protein interacts with HY5 in yeast and living plant cells and that STH2 shows a COP1-dependent localization to nuclear speckles. The identification and characterization of two sth2 alleles indicates that STH2 positively regulates anthocyanin accumulation and the inhibition of seedling hypocotyl elongation in red and blue light. The sth2 mutants show reduced numbers of lateral roots, indicating that STH2 negatively regulates the formation of lateral roots. The genetic characterization of sth2 revealed that sth2 acts as a suppressor of cop1 and that STH2 plays a positive role in regulating photomorphogenesis, both independently and together with HY5 . Functional assays in protoplasts suggest that STH2 acts as a transcriptional cofactor able to activate transcription through the G-box promoter element. The B-boxes in STH2 are required both for interaction with HY5 and for the ability of STH2 to activate transcription, thus demonstrating a molecular function for this domain.

Yeast Two-Hybrid Methods and FRET Experiments

The β-galactosidase assays were performed as described ( Holm et al., 2001 ). For the FRET acceptor photobleaching experiments, the pAM-PAT-35SS-YFP-HY5, pAM-PAT-35SS-CFP-STH2, and pRTL2-COP1 overexpression constructs were introduced into onion ( Allium cepa ) epidermal cells by particle bombardment and incubated, and live cell images were acquired using an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a laser scanning confocal imaging LSM 510 META system (Carl Zeiss). Cells were visualized at 20 h after particle bombardment using the confocal microscope through a Plan-Neofluor 403/1.3 oil (differential interference contrast) objective. The multitracking mode was used to eliminate spillover between fluorescence channels. The CFP was excited by a laser diode 405 laser and the YFP by an argon-ion laser, both at low intensities. Regions of interest were selected and bleached with 100 iterations using the argon-ion laser at 100%.
