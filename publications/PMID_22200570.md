Abstract Hyperhomocysteinemia has recently been identified as an important risk 
factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the potential mechanisms underlying 
harmful effects of homocysteine (Hcy) is site-specific acylation of proteins at 
lysine residues by homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL). The accumulation of amyloid 
β-peptide (Aβ) in the brain is a neuropathological hallmark of AD. In the 
present study we were interested to investigate the effects of 
N-homocysteinylation on the aggregation propensity and neurotoxicity of 
Aβ(1-42). By coupling several techniques, we demonstrated that the 
homocysteinylation of lysine residues increase the neurotoxicity of the Aβ 
peptide by stabilizing soluble oligomeric intermediates.
