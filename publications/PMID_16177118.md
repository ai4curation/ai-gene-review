gC1qR, a complement receptor for C1q, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of 
inflammatory and antiviral T cell responses. Several pathogens, including 
hepatitis C virus, exploit gC1qR-dependent regulatory pathways to manipulate 
host immunity. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of gC1qR signaling involved 
in regulating inflammatory responses remains unknown. We report the selective 
inhibition of TLR4-induced IL-12 production after cross-linking of gC1qR on the 
surface of macrophages and dendritic cells. Suppression of IL-12 did not result 
from increased IL-10 or TGF-beta, but was dependent on PI3K activation. 
Activation of PI3K and subsequent phosphorylation of Akt define an intracellular 
pathway mediating gC1qR signaling and cross-talk with TLR4 signaling. This is 
the first report to identify signaling pathways used by gC1qR-mediated immune 
suppression, and it establishes a means of complement-mediated immune 
suppression to inhibit Th1 immunity crucial for clearing pathogenic infection.
