The DF3/MUC1 mucin-like, transmembrane glycoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed 
in most human carcinomas. The MUC1 cytoplasmic domain interacts with the c-Src 
tyrosine kinase and thereby increases binding of MUC1 and beta-catenin. In the 
present work, coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that MUC1 associates 
constitutively with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) in human 
ZR-75-1 breast carcinoma cells. Immunofluorescence studies show that EGF-R and 
MUC1 associate at the cell membrane. We also show that the activated EGF-R 
phosphorylates the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail on tyrosine at a YEKV motif that 
functions as a binding site for the c-Src SH2 domain. The results demonstrate 
that EGF-R-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 induces binding of MUC1 to c-Src in 
cells. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that EGF-R increases 
binding of MUC1 and beta-catenin. These findings support a novel role for EGF-R 
in regulating interactions of MUC1 with c-Src and beta-catenin.
