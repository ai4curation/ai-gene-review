By combining experimental neuron models and mathematical tools, we developed a 
"systems" approach to deconvolve cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration 
underlying the most common known cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), mutations in 
leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Neurons ectopically expressing mutant 
LRRK2 formed inclusion bodies (IBs), retracted neurites, accumulated synuclein, 
and died prematurely, recapitulating key features of PD. Degeneration was 
predicted from the levels of diffuse mutant LRRK2 that each neuron contained, 
but IB formation was neither necessary nor sufficient for death. Genetic or 
pharmacological blockade of its kinase activity destabilized LRRK2 and lowered 
its levels enough to account for the moderate reduction in LRRK2 toxicity that 
ensued. By contrast, targeting synuclein, including neurons made from PD 
patient-derived induced pluripotent cells, dramatically reduced LRRK2-dependent 
neurodegeneration and LRRK2 levels. These findings suggest that LRRK2 levels are 
more important than kinase activity per se in predicting toxicity and implicate 
synuclein as a major mediator of LRRK2-induced neurodegeneration.
