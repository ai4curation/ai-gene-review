The DNA ligation reaction of topoisomerase II is essential for genomic 
integrity. However, it has been impossible to examine many fundamental aspects 
of this reaction because ligation assays historically required the enzyme to 
cleave a DNA substrate before sealing the nucleic acid break. Recently, a 
cleavage-independent DNA ligation assay was developed for human topoisomerase 
IIalpha [Bromberg, K. D., Hendricks, C., Burgin, A. B., and Osheroff, N. (2002) 
J. Biol. Chem. 277, 31201-31206]. This assay overcomes the requirement for DNA 
cleavage by monitoring the ability of the enzyme to ligate a nicked 
oligonucleotide in which the 5'-terminal phosphate at the nick has been 
activated by covalent attachment to the tyrosine mimic, p-nitrophenol. The 
cleavage-independent ligation assay was used to more fully characterize the DNA 
ligation activity of human topoisomerase IIalpha. Results suggest that the 
active site tyrosine contributes little to the catalysis of DNA ligation beyond 
its primary role as an activating/leaving group. Although arginine 804 (the 
residue immediately N-terminal to the active site tyrosine) has been proposed to 
help anchor the 5'-DNA terminus during cleavage, conversion of this residue to 
alanine had only a modest effect on DNA ligation. Thus, it appears that arginine 
804 does not play an essential role in DNA strand joining. In contrast, 
disruption of base pairing at the 5'-DNA terminus abrogated DNA ligation in the 
absence of a covalent enzyme-DNA bond. Therefore, it is proposed that base 
pairing represents a secondary mechanism for aligning the 5'-DNA termini for 
ligation. Finally, the human enzyme appears to ligate the two scissile bonds of 
a cleavage site in a nonconcerted fashion.
