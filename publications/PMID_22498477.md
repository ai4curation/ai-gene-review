Bcl-2 family members are key modulators of apoptosis that have recently been 
shown to also regulate autophagy. It has been previously reported that Bcl-2 and 
Bcl-X(L) bind and inhibit BECN1, an essential mediator of autophagy. Bcl-B is an 
anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that possesses the four BH (Bcl-2 
homology) domains (BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4) and a predicted C-terminal 
trans-membrane domain. Although the anti-apoptotic properties of Bcl-B are well 
characterized, its physiological function remains to be established. In the 
present study, we first established that Bcl-B interacts with the BH3 domain of 
BECN1. We also showed that Bcl-B overexpression reduces autophagy triggered by a 
variety of pro-autophagic stimuli. This impairment of autophagy was closely 
related to the capacity of Bcl-B to bind to BECN1. Importantly, we have 
demonstrated that Bcl-B knockdown triggers autophagic cell death and sensitizes 
cells to amino acid starvation. The cell death induced by Bcl-B knockdown was 
partially dependent on components of the autophagy machinery (LC3; BECN1; ATG5). 
These findings reveal a new role of Bcl-B in the regulation of autophagy.
