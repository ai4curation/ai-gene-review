The p300 and CREB binding protein (CBP) transcriptional coactivators interact 
with a variety of transcription factors and regulate their activity. Among the 
interactions that have been described, the COOH-terminal region of p300 binds to 
cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cyclin E-Cdk2) and TFIIB, as well as to the 
E1A gene products of adenovirus. Inhibition of Cdk activity by Cdk inhibitors, 
such as p21 or p27, potentiates NF-kappaB activity and provides a mechanism to 
coordinate cell cycle progression with the transcription of genes expressed 
during growth arrest. In this report, we analyze the specific domains of p300 
required for the binding of p300 to cyclin E-Cdk2, TFIIB, and E1A and the 
ability of these proteins to interact with p300, alone or in combination. 12S 
E1A, an inhibitor of p300-dependent transcription, reduces the binding of TFIIB, 
but not that of cyclin E-Cdk2, to p300. In contrast, 13S E1A, a pleiotropic 
transcriptional activator, does not inhibit TFIIB binding to p300, although it 
enhances the interaction of cyclin E-Cdk2 with p300. Modification of cyclin 
E-Cdk2 is most likely required for association with p300 since the interaction 
is observed only with cyclin E-Cdk2 purified from mammalian cells. Domain swap 
studies show that the cyclin homology domain of TFIIB is involved in 
interactions with p300, although the homologous region from cyclin E does not 
mediate this interaction. These findings suggest that p300 or CBP function is 
regulated by interactions of various proteins with a common coactivator domain.
