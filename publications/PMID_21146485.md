Cyclophilin-40 (CyP40) is part of the immunophilin family and is found in 
Hsp90-containing protein complexes. We were interested in identifying proteins 
that interact with CyP40. CyP40-interacting proteins in HeLa cells were 
identified using the tandem affinity purification approach. Adenovirus 
expressing human CyP40 protein (Ad-CyP40), fused with streptavidin and 
calmodulin binding peptides at the N terminus, was generated. Proteins were 
separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel 
after tandem affinity purification. Here 10 silver-stained protein bands that 
were enriched in the Ad-CyP40-infected lysate and the corresponding regions in 
the control lysate were excised, digested by trypsin, and identified by tandem 
mass spectrometric analysis. Of 11 interacting proteins that were identified, 4 
(RACK1, Ku70, RPS3, and NF45) were expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 
bacteria, and MCF-7 cells. We confirmed that these proteins interact with CyP40. 
We observed that RACK1 suppressed the cobalt chloride-induced, hypoxia response 
element-dependent luciferase activity in MCF-7 cells but not in MCF-7 stable 
cells expressing approximately 10% of the cellular CyP40 content. In addition, 
RACK1 reduced the HIF-1α protein accumulation after cobalt chloride treatment, 
which was not observed when the CyP40 content was down-regulated. Collectively, 
we conclude that reduction of the HIF-1 α protein by RACK1 is CyP40-mediated.
