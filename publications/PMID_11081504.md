Cytokines are important in the regulation of haematopoiesis and immune 
responses, and can influence lymphocyte development. Here we have identified a 
class I cytokine receptor that is selectively expressed in lymphoid tissues and 
is capable of signal transduction. The full-length receptor was expressed in 
BaF3 cells, which created a functional assay for ligand detection and cloning. 
Conditioned media from activated human CD3+ T cells supported proliferation of 
the assay cell line. We constructed a complementary DNA expression library from 
activated human CD3+ T cells, and identified a cytokine with a four-helix-bundle 
structure using functional cloning. This cytokine is most closely related to IL2 
and IL15, and has been designated IL21 with the receptor designated IL21 R. In 
vitro assays suggest that IL21 has a role in the proliferation and maturation of 
natural killer (NK) cell populations from bone marrow, in the proliferation of 
mature B-cell populations co-stimulated with anti-CD40, and in the proliferation 
of T cells co-stimulated with anti-CD3.
