Isolated complex II deficiency is a rare cause of mitochondrial disease and 
bi-allelic mutations in SDHB have been identified in only a few patients with 
complex II deficiency and a progressive neurological phenotype with onset in 
infancy. On the other hand, heterozygous SDHB mutations are a well-known cause 
of familial paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma and renal cell cancer. Here, we 
describe two additional patients with respiratory chain deficiency due to 
bi-allelic SDHB mutations. The patients' clinical, neuroradiological, and 
biochemical phenotype is discussed according to current knowledge on complex II 
and SDHB deficiency and is well in line with previously described cases, thus 
confirming the specific neuroradiological presentation of complex II deficiency 
that recently has emerged. The patients' genotype revealed one novel SDHB 
mutation, and one SDHB mutation, which previously has been described in 
heterozygous form in patients with familial paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma 
and/or renal cell cancer. This is only the second example in the literature 
where one specific SDHx mutation is associated with both recessive mitochondrial 
disease in one patient and familial paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma in others. 
Due to uncertainties regarding penetrance of different heterozygous SDHB 
mutations, we argue that all heterozygous SDHB mutation carriers identified in 
relation to SDHB-related leukoencephalopathy should be referred to relevant 
surveillance programs for paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma and renal cell cancer. 
The diagnosis of complex II deficiency due to SDHB mutations therefore raises 
implications for genetic counselling that go beyond the recurrence risk in the 
family according to an autosomal recessive inheritance.
