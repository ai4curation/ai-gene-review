FCRL6 receptor is a more recently identified representative of the FCRL family. 
We generated a panel of mouse mAbs to baculovirus-derived recombinant FCRL6 
protein. The clone 7B2 was found to specifically recognize a 63kDa protein 
expressed preferentially on the surface of CD8 T and CD56 NK cells in human 
peripheral blood and spleen. The clone 7B2 reacts with FCRL6 in Western 
blotting, FACS, and immunohistochemistry. In the T cell lineage, FCRL6 functions 
in antigen-experienced cells. Mitogenic stimulation of PB leukocytes in vitro 
resulted in an abrogation of the FCRL6 gene expression. We found a significant 
decrease in the FCRL6 gene expression in peripheral T cells of patients with 
certain autoimmune and blood diseases, and its upregulation at the late stages 
of HIV infection. Study of the FCRL6 association with signaling molecules showed 
its ability to recruit SHP-1, SHP-2, SHIP-1, and SHIP-2 phosphatases, and also 
adaptor protein Grb2 through phosphorylated cytoplasmic tyrosines. The current 
results demonstrate inhibitory potential of FCRL6 and suggest its possible 
involvement in modulation of CTL effector functions in various immune disorders.
