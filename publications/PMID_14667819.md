High-throughput (HTP) protein-interaction assays, such as the yeast two-hybrid 
(Y2H) system, are enormously useful in predicting the functions of novel 
gene-products. HTP-Y2H screens typically do not include all of the 
reconfirmation and specificity tests used in small-scale studies, but the 
effects of omitting these steps have not been assessed. We performed HTP-Y2H 
screens that included all standard controls, using the predicted intracellular 
proteins expressed from the human MHC class III region, a region of the genome 
associated with many autoimmune diseases. The 91 novel interactions identified 
provide insight into the potential functions of many MHC genes, including 
C6orf47, LSM2, NELF-E (RDBP), DOM3Z, STK19, PBX2, RNF5, UAP56 (BAT1), ATP6G2, 
LST1/f, BAT2, Scythe (BAT3), CSNK2B, BAT5, and CLIC1. Surprisingly, our results 
predict that 1/3 of the proteins may have a role in mRNA processing, which 
suggests clustering of functionally related genes within the human genome. Most 
importantly, our analysis shows that omitting standard controls in HTP-Y2H 
screens could significantly compromise data quality.
