The SHR3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an integral membrane component 
of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with four membrane-spanning segments and a 
hydrophilic, cytoplasmically oriented carboxyl-terminal domain. Mutations in 
SHR3 specifically impede the transport of all 18 members of the amino acid 
permease (aap) gene family away from the ER. Shr3p does not itself exit the ER. 
Aaps fully integrate into the ER membrane and fold properly independently of 
Shr3p. Shr3p physically associates with the general aap Gap1p but not Sec61p, 
Gal2p, or Pma1p in a complex that can be purified from 
N-dodecylmaltoside-solubilized membranes. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that 
the Shr3p-Gap1p association is transient, a reflection of the exit of Gap1p from 
the ER. The ER-derived vesicle COPII coatomer components Sec13p, Sec23p, Sec24p, 
and Sec31p but not Sar1p bind Shr3p via interactions with its carboxyl-terminal 
domain. The mutant shr3-23p, a nonfunctional membrane-associated protein, is 
unable to associate with aaps but retains the capacity to bind COPII components. 
The overexpression of either Shr3p or shr3-23p partially suppresses the 
temperature-sensitive sec12-1 allele. These results are consistent with a model 
in which Shr3p acts as a packaging chaperone that initiates ER-derived transport 
vesicle formation in the proximity of aaps by facilitating the membrane 
association and assembly of COPII coatomer components.
