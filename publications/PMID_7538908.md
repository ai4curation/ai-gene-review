Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 
(CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. 
Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have 
identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of 
Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor 
interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis 
factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of 
Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal 
region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a 
cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular 
domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the 
morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these 
properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.
