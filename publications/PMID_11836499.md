The breast cancer tumor-suppressor gene, BRCA1, encodes a protein with a BRCT 
domain-a motif that is found in many proteins that are implicated in DNA damage 
response and in genome stability. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 by the DNA 
damage-response proteins ATM, ATR and hCds1/Chk2 changes in response to DNA 
damage and at replication-block checkpoints. Although cells that lack BRCA1 have 
an abnormal response to DNA damage, the exact role of BRCA1 in this process has 
remained unclear. Here we show that BRCA1 is essential for activating the Chk1 
kinase that regulates DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest. Thus, BRCA1 controls the 
expression, phosphorylation and cellular localization of Cdc25C and Cdc2/cyclin 
B kinase-proteins that are crucial for the G2/M transition. We show that BRCA1 
regulates the expression of both Wee1 kinase, an inhibitor of Cdc2/cyclin B 
kinase, and the 14-3-3 family of proteins that sequesters phosphorylated Cdc25C 
and Cdc2/cyclin B kinase in the cytoplasm. We conclude that BRCA1 regulates key 
effectors that control the G2/M checkpoint and is therefore involved in 
regulating the onset of mitosis.
