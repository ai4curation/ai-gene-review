The naphthoquinone pigment, shikonin, is a natural product derived from 
Lithospermum erythrorhizon and an active component of a Chinese traditional 
herbal therapeutic. We identified shikonin as a candidate for shortening the 
circadian period using real-time reporter gene assays based on NIH3T3-derived 
stable reporter cells. Period length that became shortened in cells incubated 
with shikonin or etoposide reverted to that of control cells after continued 
incubation without these compounds. These findings indicated that shikonin and 
etoposide shorten the circadian period reversibly and through similar 
mechanisms. Topoisomerase II (Top2)-specific decatenation assays confirmed that 
shikonin, liker etoposide, is a Top2 inhibitor. Shikonin was incorporated into 
the nucleus and Top2 was located in the Bmal1 promoter, suggesting the 
relationship between Bmal1 transcription and Top2 inhibition. Top2a siRNA also 
shortened period length, suggesting that Top2 is involved in this process. 
Promoter assays showed that Top2a siRNA, etoposide and shikonin reduce Bmal1 
promoter activity. These findings indicated that Top2 is involved in Bmal1 
transcription and influences the circadian period, and that shikonin is a novel 
contributor to the control of period length in mammalian cells.
