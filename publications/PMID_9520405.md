Posttranslational acetylation of core histone amino termini has long been 
associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. Recent reports have 
demonstrated histone acetyltransferase activity in a small group of conserved 
transcriptional regulators directly linked to gene activation. In addition, the 
presence of a putative acetyltransferase domain has been discovered in a group 
of proteins known as the MYST family (for its founding members MOZ, YBF2/SAS3, 
SAS2, and Tip60). Members of this family are implicated in acute myeloid 
leukemia (MOZ), transcriptional silencing in yeast (SAS2 and YBF2/SAS3), HIV Tat 
interaction in humans (Tip60), and dosage compensation in Drosophila (MOF). In 
this report, we express a yeast ORF with homology to MYST family members and 
show it possesses histone acetyltransferase activity. Unlike the other MYST 
family members in Saccharomyces cerevisiae this gene is essential for growth.
