The gene responsible for the human genetic neurodegenerative disorder DFN-1/MTS 
encodes a small protein known as deafness/dystonia peptide (DDP). It bears a 
strong resemblance to a recently characterized set of zinc-binding yeast 
proteins (Tim8p, Tim9p, Tim10p, Tim12p, and Tim13p) that are implicated in the 
import of a class of transmembrane carrier proteins from the cytoplasm to the 
mitochondrial inner membrane. We describe here the human complement of 
DDP/Tim-like proteins and establish the likely orthologous relationships between 
sequences from human, yeast, and other organisms. We also describe the 
expression patterns and chromosomal locations of their genes, which are 
candidate loci for autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders.
