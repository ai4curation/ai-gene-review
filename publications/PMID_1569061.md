We have studied the structure, biosynthesis, intracellular routing, and vacuolar 
localization of carboxypeptidase ysCS in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two forms of 
carboxypeptidase yscS with different electrophoretic mobility. Antibodies 
specific for carboxypeptidase yscS recognized two glycoproteins of 77- and 
74-kDa apparent molecular mass which differ by one N-linked carbohydrate 
residue. Both observations suggest that carboxypeptidase yscS exists in two 
catalytically active forms. The enzyme was found to be synthesized as two active 
high molecular mass precursor forms which are converted to the mature forms with 
a half-time of 20 min. The mature forms of carboxypeptidase yscS appeared 
soluble in the vacuolar lumen, while the precursor proteins accumulated tightly 
associated with the vacuolar membrane. The single hydrophobic domain present at 
the N terminus is believed to be responsible for the membrane association of the 
precursor molecules. Double mutants defective in proteinase yscA and proteinase 
yscB synthesize solely the carboxypeptidase yscS precursor forms. Correct 
proteolytic cleavage of the precursor forms was performed using purified 
proteinase yscB in vitro. Sec61, sec18, and sec7 mutants, conditionally 
defective in the secretory pathway, accumulate carboxypeptidase yscS precursor 
protein. Thus the carboxypeptidase yscS precursor molecules are delivered to the 
vacuole in a membrane bound form via the secretory pathway. After assembly into 
the vacuolar membrane, proteinase yscB presumably cleaves the precursor 
molecules to release soluble carboxypeptidase yscS forms into the lumen of the 
vacuole. The proposed mechanism is different from the delivery mechanism found 
for the other soluble vacuolar hydrolases in yeast.
