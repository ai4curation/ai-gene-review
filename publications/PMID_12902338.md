The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and glucocorticoid signaling 
pathways interact both positively and negatively in regulating a variety of 
physiological and pathologic processes. We previously reported that liganded 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) repressed TGF-beta induction of human plasminogen 
activator inhibitor-1 gene transcription by directly targeting the 
transcriptional activation function of Smad3. To identify the domain(s) in the 
glucocorticoid receptor involved in this repression, we have examined the 
ability of various GR truncation, deletion, and substitution mutants to repress 
TGF-beta transactivation in Hep3B human hepatoma cells that lack functional 
endogenous GR. Partial deletions in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), including 
the tau2 and tauc regions, greatly reduced or eliminated GR repression, whereas 
deletion of the N-terminal AF1 (tau1) domain and substitution mutations in the 
DNA-binding domain had little or no effect. Liganded androgen receptor repressed 
TGF-beta transactivation, whereas mineralocorticoid receptor did not, and 
studies with rat GR-mineralocorticoid receptor chimeras confirmed that the GR 
C-terminal domains were required for repression. RU486, a strong antagonist of 
transactivation by GR, partially reversed repression by wild type GR. 
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in Hep3B cells indicated that physical 
interaction between GR and Smad3 is necessary but not sufficient for repression. 
Physical interaction required activation of Smad3 by TGF-beta but not 
dexamethasone binding to GR. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays 
demonstrated that several regions of the LBD could mediate GR-Smad3 physical 
interaction. We conclude that the LBD of GR, but not the DNA-binding domain or 
the N-terminal activation domain, is required for GR-mediated transrepression of 
TGF-beta transactivation.
