Jun-dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) is a member of the activating protein-1 (AP-1) 
family of transcription factors. JDP2 dimerizes with other AP-1 proteins such as 
activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) and Jun to repress transcription from 
promoters that contain a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE). Interferon 
regulatory factor-2-binding protein-1 (IRF2-BP1), which is reported to be a 
transcriptional corepressor of IRF2, was isolated as a JDP2-binding protein 
using an epitope-tagging method. As anticipated from the presence of a 
RING-finger domain, IRF2-BP1 enhanced the polyubiquitination of JDP2. Moreover, 
IRF2-BP1 repressed ATF2-mediated transcriptional activation from a 
CRE-containing promoter.
