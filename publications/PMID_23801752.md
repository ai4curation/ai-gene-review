Tumor cells activate autophagy in response to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage as 
a survival program to cope with metabolic stress. Here, we provide in vitro and 
in vivo evidence that histone deacetylase (HDAC)10 promotes autophagy-mediated 
survival in neuroblastoma cells. We show that both knockdown and inhibition of 
HDAC10 effectively disrupted autophagy associated with sensitization to 
cytotoxic drug treatment in a panel of highly malignant V-MYC myelocytomatosis 
viral-related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived-amplified neuroblastoma cell 
lines, in contrast to nontransformed cells. HDAC10 depletion in neuroblastoma 
cells interrupted autophagic flux and induced accumulation of autophagosomes, 
lysosomes, and a prominent substrate of the autophagic degradation pathway, 
p62/sequestosome 1. Enforced HDAC10 expression protected neuroblastoma cells 
against doxorubicin treatment through interaction with heat shock protein 70 
family proteins, causing their deacetylation. Conversely, heat shock protein 
70/heat shock cognate 70 was acetylated in HDAC10-depleted cells. HDAC10 
expression levels in high-risk neuroblastomas correlated with autophagy in 
gene-set analysis and predicted treatment success in patients with advanced 
stage 4 neuroblastomas. Our results demonstrate that HDAC10 protects cancer 
cells from cytotoxic agents by mediating autophagy and identify this HDAC 
isozyme as a druggable regulator of advanced-stage tumor cell survival. 
Moreover, these results propose a promising way to considerably improve 
treatment response in the neuroblastoma patient subgroup with the poorest 
outcome.
