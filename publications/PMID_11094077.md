The role of HSP90 in stress tolerance was investigated in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Cells showing 20-fold overexpression of Hsc82, an HSP90 homologue in 
yeast, were hypersensitive to high-NaCl or H-LiCl stresses. Hsc82-overexpressing 
cells appeared similar to calcineurin-defective cells in salt sensitivity and 
showed reduced levels of calcineurin-dependent gene expression. 
Co-overexpression of Cna2, the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, suppressed the 
hypersensitivity. Cna2 and Hsc82 coimmunoprecipitated from control cells grown 
under normal conditions but not from stressed cells. In contrast, 
coimmunoprecipitation was detected with Hsc82-overexpressing cells even after 
exposure to stresses. Cna2 immune complexes from stressed control cells showed a 
significant level of calcineurin activity, whereas those from stressed 
Hsc82-overexpressing cells did not. Treatment of extracts from 
Hsc82-overexpressing cells with Ca(2+)-calmodulin increased the calcineurin 
activity associated with Cna2 immune complexes. Geldanamycin, an inhibitor of 
HSP90 abolished the coimmunoprecipitation but did not activate calcineurin. When 
the expression level of Hsc82 decreased to below 30% of the normal level, cells 
also became hypersensitive to salt stress. In these cells, the amount of Cna2 
was reduced, likely as a result of degradation. The present results showed that 
Hsc82 binds to and stabilizes Cna2 and that dissociation of Cna2 from Hsc82 is 
necessary for its activation.
