How tumour suppressor p53 bifurcates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and 
executes these distinct pathways is not clearly understood. We show that BAX and 
PUMA promoters harbour an identical MAR element and are transcriptional targets 
of SMAR1. On mild DNA damage, SMAR1 selectively represses BAX and PUMA through 
binding to the MAR independently of inducing p53 deacetylation through HDAC1. 
This generates an anti-apoptotic response leading to cell cycle arrest. 
Importantly, knockdown of SMAR1 induces apoptosis, which is abrogated in the 
absence of p53. Conversely, apoptotic DNA damage results in increased size and 
number of promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies with consequent 
sequestration of SMAR1. This facilitates p53 acetylation and restricts SMAR1 
binding to BAX and PUMA MAR leading to apoptosis. Thus, our study establishes 
MAR as a damage responsive cis element and SMAR1-PML crosstalk as a switch that 
modulates the decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to 
DNA damage.

Abstract

How tumour suppressor p53 bifurcates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and executes these distinct pathways is not clearly understood. We show that BAX and PUMA promoters harbour an identical MAR element and are transcriptional targets of SMAR1. On mild DNA damage, SMAR1 selectively represses BAX and PUMA through binding to the MAR independently of inducing p53 deacetylation through HDAC1. This generates an anti-apoptotic response leading to cell cycle arrest. Importantly, knockdown of SMAR1 induces apoptosis, which is abrogated in the absence of p53. Conversely, apoptotic DNA damage results in increased size and number of promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies with consequent sequestration of SMAR1. This facilitates p53 acetylation and restricts SMAR1 binding to BAX and PUMA MAR leading to apoptosis. Thus, our study establishes MAR as a damage responsive cis element and SMAR1–PML crosstalk as a switch that modulates the decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

Introduction

The tumour suppressor p53 is the cellular sentinel of the mammalian cell cycle and an indispensable component of the DNA damage response pathway. Activation of p53 in response to DNA damage results in either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Although genes that regulate cellular processes such as arrest and apoptosis are essentially p53 targets, activation of p53 always results in specific and selective transcription of p53-regulated genes ( Riley et al , 2008 ). Thus, it is likely that unique sets of p53-regulated genes operate in tandem to bring about a desired outcome in response to specific stimuli. How p53 executes these two distinct functions in a promoter-specific manner remains largely unclear. Recent reports suggest that activation of specific promoters by p53 is achieved through its interaction with heterologous transcription factors such as Hzf, human cellular apoptosis susceptibility (hCAS)/CSE1L and ASPP family proteins ( Samuels-Lev et al , 2001 ; Das et al , 2007 ; Tanaka et al , 2007 ). In addition, under conditions of stress, different phosphorylation and acetylation modules stabilize p53 enhancing its sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activity ( Sakaguchi et al , 1998 ). Although phosphorylation at amino-terminus is required for p53 stability, acetylation at carboxyl-terminus has been shown to be indispensable for p53 transcriptional activation ( Tang et al , 2008 ).

The tumour suppressor promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein is involved in the regulation of p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis. The PML protein localizes to multi-protein sub-nuclear structures termed as PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which act as sensors of DNA damage and cellular stress. On genotoxic stress, the PML protein functions as a transcriptional co-activator of p53 by recruiting it to the PML-NBs, wherein PML facilitates p53 phosphorylation and acetylation through recruitment of factors such as HIPK2 and CBP ( Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007 ). Further, the PML gene itself is a transcriptional target of p53 ( de Stanchina et al , 2004 ).

Scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) are regulatory DNA sequences mostly present upstream of various promoters. Matrix attachment region-binding proteins (MARBPs), which bind to such regulatory sequences, interact with numerous chromatin modifying factors and facilitate transcription in response to diverse stimuli ( Zaidi et al , 2005 ). SMAR1 is an MARBP identified in mouse double positive thymocytes, wherein it binds to MARβ sequence at TCRβ locus and affects V(D)J recombination ( Chattopadhyay et al , 2000 ; Kaul-Ghanekar et al , 2005 ). Subsequently, SMAR1 has been characterized as a tumour suppressor by virtue of its ability to interact with p53 and delay tumour growth in mouse melanoma model ( Kaul et al , 2003 ; Jalota et al , 2005 ). The tumour suppressor p53 is also an MARBP that associates with the nuclear matrix and this association increases after DNA damage ( Jiang et al , 2001 ). The PML-NBs are also associated with the nuclear matrix indirectly. However, the biological and functional significances of nuclear matrix-bound p53 and nuclear matrix-associated PML-NBs in context to p53 regulation are not known.

In this study, we show that p53 target gene SMAR1 modulates the cellular response to genotoxic stress by a dual mechanism. First, SMAR1 interacts with p53 and facilitates p53 deacetylation through recruitment of HDAC1. Second, SMAR1 represses the transcription of BAX and PUMA by binding to an identical 25 bp MAR element in their promoters. We show that on mild DNA damage, SMAR1 generates an anti-apoptotic response by promoting p53 deacetylation and specifically repressing Bax and Puma expression. Reducing the expression of SMAR1 by shRNA leads to significant increase in p53-dependent apoptosis. However, severe DNA damage results in sequestration of SMAR1 into the PML-NBs. This facilitates p53 acetylation and transactivation of BAX and PUMA leading to apoptosis in cancer cells. Silencing of PML by specific siRNA abrogates DNA damage-induced apoptosis through transrepression of BAX and PUMA by SMAR1. Thus, sequestration of SMAR1 into the PML-NBs acts as a molecular switch to dictate p53-dependent cell arrest and apoptosis on DNA damage and we suggest that SMAR1 may be a new molecular target for cancer therapy.

Discussion

In this study using a low- and high-dose UV stress, we have deciphered the molecular functionality of MARBP SMAR1 during p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We show that p53 target gene SMAR1 is induced during UV DNA damage, but is compartmentalized into the PML-NBs at high-dose DNA damage and, therefore, have different functional outcome. Unlike proteins such as Mdm2, Pirh2 and COP1, which regulate basal levels of p53 through direct ubiquitination ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ), SMAR1 modulates basal p53 acetylation status by recruiting HDAC1. This kind of basal regulation of p53 acetylation is important to prevent sudden cell death arising out of mild metabolic stresses, which the cells always encounter. Although, transcription factors such as Hzf, hCAS and ASPP family members modulate p53 function by directly binding to selective p53 target genes under conditions of stress, SMAR1 modulates the transactivation potential of p53 by associating with HDAC1 apart from imparting specific regulation of p53 apoptotic targets Bax and Puma through MAR element. We show for the first time that both BAX and PUMA promoter harbour a similar 25 bp MAR element through which SMAR1 anchors these genes to the nuclear matrix making them transcriptionally inactive. Although, mild DNA damage triggers p53 acetylation and transcription of p53 apoptotic targets BAX and PUMA , induction of SMAR1 results in p53 deacetylation through increased association of p53 with SMAR1–HDAC1 complex. This prevents prolonged and sustained accumulation of p53 acetylation levels and inhibits apoptosis. Further, SMAR1 is recruited to BAX and PUMA promoter MAR resulting in abatement of their transcription. Thus, induction of SMAR1 generates an anti-apoptotic signal that prevents cellular apoptosis after mild DNA damage. Although low-dose UV DNA damage induced around 5% cell death, the percentage of apoptosis increased to 21% in SMAR1 knockdown cells treated with low-dose UV. In addition, SMAR1 knockdown itself induced significant apoptosis. Knockdown of SMAR1 resulted in prolonged and robust accumulation of p53 acetylation levels and, therefore, promotes apoptosis. Thus, we establish SMAR1 as an important apoptotic check point regulator. It is intriguing as to why SMAR1 needs to repress BAX and PUMA by binding to an MAR element when it can inhibit p53 acetylation through HDAC1 and thereby block p53 downstream effectors. One possible explanation is that p53 deacetylation occurs at protein level and is kinetically a much slower process compared with direct repression through MAR. The MAR site in BAX and PUMA promoter acts as a negative regulatory element that ensures timely repression and safeguard mechanism from commitment of cells towards apoptosis when damage is repairable. This is the reason why after mild DNA damage, p21 and SMAR1 remain induced till 48 h, whereas BAX and PUMA are suppressed considering that all of them are p53 target genes. This suggests that the drastic repression of BAX and PUMA is a direct effect of the MAR element coupled to p53 deacetylation. Moreover, genes which harbour MARs and are attached to the nuclear matrix are more repressed than genes in matrix without MARs ( Rudd et al , 2004 ). Thus, MARs serve as an additional layer of transcriptional regulation for BAX and PUMA besides p53 in response to DNA damage. Interestingly, Bax and Puma are mitochondrial proteins, genes of which are located in the same locus 19q13.3 and both are transcriptionally regulated by a single MAR element present in both promoters. Thus, it is possible that binding of SMAR1 to the identical MAR element brings the promoters of BAX and PUMA in close proximity of each other to confer regulatory effects by allowing the intervening sequence (1.7 Mb) between the promoters to form intrachromosomal loops ( Figures 4A and 8B ). Such kind of long-range intrachromosomal interactions have been reported for T H 2 cytokine locus ( Spilianakis and Flavell, 2004 ).

It is shown that in PML −/− cells, induction of proapoptotic targets such as BAX is impaired ( Guo et al , 2000 ). However, mechanism how PML regulates the expression of Bax is not known. In this study, we showed that PML is induced at high-dose 100 J/m 2 UV in a p53-dependent manner. PML induction is associated with sequestration of SMAR1 with concomitant increase in p53 acetylation. We have shown that SMAR1 forms a repressor complex with p53 and HDAC1, and this repressor complex is associated with BAX and PUMA MAR. Therefore, sequestration of SMAR1 by PML not only facilitates p53 acetylation, but also enhances the expression of Bax and Puma. Further, the occupancy of SMAR1 on BAX and PUMA promoter MAR in UV-treated PML knockdown cells abrogates UV-induced apoptosis. In this context, it is worth mentioning that tumour suppressor PML protein is downregulated in most of the cancers ( Scaglioni et al , 2006 ). Although we have earlier shown that SMAR1 is downregulated in higher grades of breast cancer in which p53 function becomes defective, SMAR1 responds positively to various DNA damaging and chemotherapeutic agents in cells harbouring wild-type p53 ( Singh et al , 2007 ). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that loss of PML expression coupled to the responsiveness of SMAR1 to various drugs in tumours harbouring wild-type p53 might explain their increased refractory nature to various chemotherapeutic treatment modules. Thus, SMAR1 can be a potential target for cancer therapy in which p53 function is not compromised.
