The macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR) is a trimeric membrane protein which 
binds to modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and has been indicated in the 
development of atherosclerosis. It has recently been demonstrated that the 
N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of MSR has an important role in the efficient 
internalization and cell-surface expression of the receptor. This study shows 
that the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain in bovine was constructed using a peptide 
architecture technique in which the peptide chain was bundled at their 
C-terminus to yield a trimeric form and that this did not form an ordered 
structure. Furthermore, the binding proteins to the cytoplasmic domain of MSR 
were determined for the first time using a peptide affinity column. Sequence 
analyses of the specific binding proteins in bovine revealed that heat shock 
protein 90 (HSP90), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), 
adenocylhomocysteinase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 
were included. GST-pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation analyses on HSP90, 
HSP70, and GAPDH showed that all these proteins could bind to the cytoplasmic 
domain of MSR in vitro and in vivo. These proteins interact with the cytoplasmic 
domain directly and may have an effect on the functions of MSR such as 
internalization, cell-surface expression, and signal transduction.
