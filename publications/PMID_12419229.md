Transcriptional repression is based on the selective actions of recruited 
corepressor complexes, including those with enzymatic activities. One 
well-characterized developmentally important corepressor is the C-terminal 
binding protein (CtBP). Although intriguingly related in sequence to D2 
hydroxyacid dehydrogenases, the mechanism by which CtBP functions remains 
unclear. We report here biochemical and crystallographic studies which reveal 
that CtBP is a functional dehydrogenase. In addition, both a cofactor-dependent 
conformational change, with NAD(+) and NADH being equivalently effective, and 
the active site residues are linked to the binding of the PXDLS consensus 
recognition motif on repressors, such as E1A and RIP140. Together, our data 
suggest that CtBP is an NAD(+)-regulated component of critical complexes for 
specific repression events in cells.
