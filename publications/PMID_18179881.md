We describe a distinct retinal disorder, autosomal-recessive bestrophinopathy 
(ARB), that is consequent upon biallelic mutation in BEST1 and is associated 
with central visual loss, a characteristic retinopathy, an absent 
electro-oculogram light rise, and a reduced electroretinogram. Heterozygous 
mutations in BEST1 have previously been found to cause the two dominantly 
inherited disorders, Best macular dystrophy and autosomal-dominant 
vitreoretinochoroidopathy. The transmembrane protein bestrophin-1, encoded by 
BEST1, is located at the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium 
in which it probably functions as a Cl(-) channel. We sequenced BEST1 in five 
families, identifying DNA variants in each of ten alleles. These encoded six 
different missense variants and one nonsense variant. The alleles segregated 
appropriately for a recessive disorder in each family. No clinical or 
electrophysiological abnormalities were identified in any heterozygotes. We 
conducted whole-cell patch-clamping of HEK293 cells transfected with 
bestrophin-1 to measure the Cl(-) current. Two ARB missense isoforms severely 
reduced channel activity. However, unlike two other alleles previously 
associated with Best disease, cotransfection with wild-type bestrophin-1 did not 
impair the formation of active wild-type bestrophin-1 channels, consistent with 
the recessive nature of the condition. We propose that ARB is the null phenotype 
of bestrophin-1 in humans.
