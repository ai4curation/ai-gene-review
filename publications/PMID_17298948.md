Cryptochromes are flavoproteins that are evolutionary related to the DNA 
photolyases but lack DNA repair activity. Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY) is a 
blue light photoreceptor that is involved in the synchronization of the 
circadian clock with the environmental light-dark cycle. Until now, 
spectroscopic and structural studies on this and other animal cryptochromes have 
largely been hampered by difficulties in their recombinant expression. We have 
therefore established an expression and purification scheme that enables us to 
purify mg amounts of monomeric dCRY from Sf21 insect cell cultures. Using 
UV-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and reversed phase high pressure 
liquid chromatography, we show that insect cell-purified dCRY contains flavin 
adenine dinucleotide in its oxidized state (FAD(ox)) and residual amounts of 
methenyltetrahydrofolate. Upon blue light irradiation, dCRY undergoes a 
reversible absorption change, which is assigned to the conversion of FAD(ox) to 
the red anionic FAD(.) radical. Our findings lead us to propose a novel 
photoreaction mechanism for dCRY, in which FAD(ox) corresponds to the ground 
state, whereas the FAD(.) radical represents the light-activated state that 
mediates resetting of the Drosophila circadian clock.
