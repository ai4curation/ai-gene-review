The Wnt pathway tumor-suppressor protein Axin coordinates the formation of a 
critical multiprotein destruction complex that serves to downregulate β-catenin 
protein levels, thereby preventing target gene activation. Given the lack of 
structural information on some of the major functional parts of Axin, it remains 
unresolved how the recruitment and positioning of Wnt pathway kinases, such as 
glycogen synthase kinase 3β, are coordinated to bring about β-catenin 
phosphorylation. Using various biochemical and biophysical methods, we 
demonstrate here that the central region of Axin that is implicated in binding 
glycogen synthase kinase 3β and β-catenin is natively unfolded. Our results 
support a model in which the unfolded nature of these critical scaffolding 
regions in Axin facilitates dynamic interactions with a kinase and its 
substrate, which in turn act upon each other.
