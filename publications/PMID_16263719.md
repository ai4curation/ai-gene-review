Mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (pol gamma) is responsible for replication 
and repair of mtDNA and is mutated in individuals with genetic disorders such as 
chronic external ophthalmoplegia and Alpers syndrome. pol gamma is also an 
adventitious target for toxic side effects of several antiviral compounds, and 
mutation of its proofreading exonuclease leads to accelerated aging in mouse 
models. We have used a variety of physical and functional approaches to study 
the interaction of the human pol gamma catalytic subunit with both the wild-type 
accessory factor, pol gammaB, and a deletion derivative that is unable to 
dimerize and consequently is impaired in its ability to stimulate processive DNA 
synthesis. Our studies clearly showed that the functional human holoenzyme 
contains two subunits of the processivity factor and one catalytic subunit, 
thereby forming a heterotrimer. The structure of pol gamma seems to be variable, 
ranging from a single catalytic subunit in yeast to a heterodimer in Drosophila 
and a heterotrimer in mammals.
