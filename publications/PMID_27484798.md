The A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) GSK3β interaction protein (GSKIP) is a 
cytosolic scaffolding protein binding protein kinase A (PKA) and glycogen 
synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Here we show that both the AKAP function of GSKIP, 
i.e. its direct interaction with PKA, and its direct interaction with GSK3β are 
required for the regulation of β-catenin and thus Wnt signaling. A cytoplasmic 
destruction complex targets β-catenin for degradation and thus prevents Wnt 
signaling. Wnt signals cause β-catenin accumulation and translocation into the 
nucleus, where it induces Wnt target gene expression. GSKIP facilitates control 
of the β-catenin stabilizing phosphorylation at Ser-675 by PKA. Its interaction 
with GSK3β facilitates control of the destabilizing phosphorylation of β-catenin 
at Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41. The influence of GSKIP on β-catenin is explained by its 
scavenger function; it recruits the kinases away from the destruction complex 
without forming a complex with β-catenin. The regulation of β-catenin by GSKIP 
is specific for this AKAP as AKAP220, which also binds PKA and GSK3β, did not 
affect Wnt signaling. We find that the binding domain of AKAP220 for GSK3β is a 
conserved GSK3β interaction domain (GID), which is also present in GSKIP. Our 
findings highlight an essential compartmentalization of both PKA and GSK3β by 
GSKIP, and ascribe a function to a cytosolic AKAP-PKA interaction as a 
regulatory factor in the control of canonical Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling 
controls different biological processes, including embryonic development, cell 
cycle progression, glycogen metabolism, and immune regulation; deregulation is 
associated with diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory, and 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
