Abstract

Plant photoreceptors transduce environmental light cues to downstream signaling pathways, regulating a wide array of processes during growth and development. Two major plant photoreceptors with critical roles in photomorphogenesis are phytochrome B (phyB), a red/far-red absorbing photoreceptor, and cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), a UV-A/blue photoreceptor. Despite substantial genetic evidence for cross-talk between phyB and CRY1 pathways, a direct interaction between these proteins has not been observed. Here, we report that Arabidopsis phyB interacts directly with CRY1 in a light-dependent interaction. Surprisingly, the interaction is light-dissociated; CRY1 interacts specifically with the dark/far-red (Pr) state of phyB, but not with the red light-activated (Pfr) or the chromophore unconjugated form of the enzyme. The interaction is also regulated by light activation of CRY1; phyB Pr interacts only with the unstimulated form of CRY1 but not with the photostimulated protein. Further studies reveal that a small domain extending from the photolyase homology region (PHR) of CRY1 regulates the specificity of the interaction with different conformational states of phyB. We hypothesize that in plants, the phyB/CRY1 interaction may mediate cross-talk between the red/far-red- and blue/UV-sensing pathways, enabling fine-tuning of light responses to different spectral inputs.

Introduction

The phyB 2 and CRY1 pathways of Arabidopsis act to control large aspects of plant photomorphogenesis, with critical roles in light regulation of de-etiolation, germination, shade avoidance, and other diverse processes ( 1 – 5 ). phyB is a red/far-red-sensing photoreceptor that converts between two distinct structural states, a “Pr” form that exists predominantly in dark and far-red light and a “Pfr” form that exists predominantly in red light ( 6 ). The Pfr form of phyB is thought to be the signaling state, and most known light-dependent interactions with phyB, including interactions with the PIF family of transcription factors ( 7 ), occur with this conformation of the protein, although at least one protein complex has been observed to show some specificity in binding to phytochrome Pr ( 8 ).

CRY1 is a UV-A/blue photoreceptor that has been shown to interact in a light-dependent manner with only one other protein, SPA1 ( 9 , 10 ). The CRY1/SPA1 interaction requires blue light and was shown to prevent interaction of SPA1 with COP1 ( 9 , 10 ). CRY2, a closely related cryptochrome, was also shown to interact with SPA1 in a light-dependent manner, via a different site ( 9 , 11 ). Only one other light-dependent interaction of a plant cryptochrome has been reported, an interaction of CRY2 with the basic helix-loop-helix protein CIB1, which also occurs only with the blue light-stimulated state ( 12 ).

Despite many prior studies in plants that have provided genetic evidence for cross-talk between the cryptochrome and phytochrome pathways ( 13 – 22 ), it has not been clear how this is mediated because evidence for a direct, light-dependent interaction between these photoreceptors has been elusive. Phytochrome A (phyA), a phytochrome that mediates far-red and very low light responses, was previously found to interact with CRY1, but this interaction was not demonstrated to be light-dependent ( 23 ). A direct interaction was also shown between phyB and cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), where phyB and CRY2 were found to interact in nuclear speckles formed by light, but co-immunoprecipitation studies did not demonstrate light dependence ( 24 ).

In this study, we sought to identify novel proteins that interact in a light-dependent manner with phyB. Although most light-dependent interactions with phytochrome occur with the Pfr form, we speculated that there could exist additional interactions specific to the Pr form. We thus carried out yeast two-hybrid screens with both the Pr and the Pfr forms of phyB, allowing identification of Arabidopsis proteins that specifically interact with these conformations. Here, we report a novel interaction between the phyB and CRY1 photoreceptor proteins that is specific to the Pr state of phyB and is disrupted by light stimulation of either phyB or CRY1. This light-dissociated interaction may represent a novel mechanism for cross-talk between blue and red/far-red signaling pathways.

RESULTS

To identify novel interacting partners of phyB, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using an Arabidopsis library. Phytochromes require a bilin chromophore, phytochromobilin, to mediate light responses. Although this chromophore is not present in yeast, incubation of yeast with phycocyanobilin (PCB), a bilin from Spirulina , allows reconstitution of functional phyB holoenzyme ( 28 ). We thus carried out two-hybrid screening in the presence of 5 μ m PCB to identify proteins that interact with holo-phyB. We used the amino terminus of phyB (residues 1–621, phyBNT) as bait because a full-length version of phyB bait was found to be self-activating and stimulated the two-hybrid reporter on its own (data not shown). The screen was carried out under red light or dark conditions and in the presence or absence of PCB. From the +PCB plates that were incubated in the dark, we identified full-length CRY1 as a novel, PCB-dependent interacting partner of phyB ( Fig. 1 A ).

To confirm the two-hybrid results and examine the interaction of CRY1 with full-length phyB, we used an in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assay. We used an S-tagged truncated CRY1 (residues 1–551, CRY(551)) as it showed improved expression in bacteria when compared with full-length CRY1. Full-length HA-tagged apo-phyB was generated in vitro using a T n T T7-coupled expression system. Wheat germ lysates containing apo-phyB were first incubated with PCB in the dark to generate holo-phyB and then combined with antibody-conjugated CRY(551) and immunoprecipitated in the dark or under blue light conditions. As shown in Fig. 1 B , full-length phyB co-immunoprecipitates with CRY(551), indicating that the full-length phyB protein also interacts. Samples exposed to blue light showed reduced levels of immunoprecipitated phyB-HA when compared with those incubated in the dark, indicating that the interaction is dependent on the light activation state of CRY1.

Our initial studies suggested that the interaction between phyB and CRY1 is dissociated by light. To further explore the light dependence of the interaction for each photoreceptor, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay. In the presence of chromophore, phyB converts from a Pr state in dark or far-red light to a Pfr state with red light illumination. The Pfr and Pr states are structurally distinct; the Pfr, but not Pr, form of phyB interacts with the PIF family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors to induce expression of downstream proteins ( 29 – 31 ). To determine whether CRY1 interacts specifically with the Pfr or Pr form of phyB, we examined the red light dependence of the interaction. After incubating cells for 4 h to allow PCB uptake and generate holo-phyBNT, samples were subjected to various light treatments for 2 h, and then reporter activity was determined ( Fig. 2 A ). We observed a 7-fold difference between the red- and far-red-treated samples that was reversed by red/far-red pulses, indicating that CRY1 binds specifically to the Pr form of phyBNT.

Using blue and far-red light treatments, we examined whether the interaction is regulated by CRY1 photoactivation. To test light dependence, samples were exposed to periodic blue light pulses (1-s duration). Because a previous study of purified CRY1 had suggested that the signaling state extends for several minutes ( t ½ ∼5 min) ( 32 ), a rate that is consistent with the observed reversion rate of the CRY2/CIB1 interaction ( t ½ ∼5.5 min) ( 33 ), we exposed samples to light pulses delivered every 3 min, conditions that would maintain on average >90% of CRY1 protein in the light-stimulated form over this time period. Because blue light can also stimulate phyB ( 34 ), every pulse of blue light was followed immediately by a 30-s pulse far-red light, thus maintaining CRY1 in the light-activated state while converting any blue light-activated phyB to the Pr state. Cells treated in this manner yielded reduced levels of interaction similar to that obtained with red light ( Fig. 2 A ), indicating that phyB does not interact with the light-stimulated form of CRY1.

To further probe the interaction of CRY1 with Pr phyB, we used a phyB mutant, Y276H. phyB Y276H (phyB(YH)) was initially identified as a constitutively active mutant that results in a light-independent dominant constitutive photomorphogenic ( cop ) phenotype in Arabidopsis ( 35 ). Tyr-276 is known to be of critical importance for phyB photochemistry, and the substitution of histidine at this residue has been proposed to “lock” phyB in the light-activated Pfr state ( 35 ). We tested interaction between phyBNT(YH) and CRY1 ( Fig. 2 B ). As a control, we also examined interaction of phyBNT(YH) with PIF3, a protein that interacts with the Pfr conformation of phyB. Although phyBNT(YH) interacted robustly with PIF3 in the dark, confirming the constitutive phenotype of this mutant, it did not interact with CRY1, providing additional support that CRY1 does not interact with the Pfr state of phyB ( Fig. 2 B ).

We explored additional differences between the phyB/CRY1 and phyB/PIF interactions using a phyB truncation mutant. A previous study had shown that the N-terminal P1 domain of phyB contained within the first 100 residues is essential for binding to PIF3 ( 36 ). A truncation mutant missing this region (phyB(101–621)) failed to interact with PIF3 in dark or red light but still interacted with CRY1 in the dark ( Fig. 2 C ), indicating that CRY1 and PIF3 interact with phyB at distinct sites in the respective Pr and Pfr forms. Additional analysis showed that the interaction of CRY1 with phyB(101–621) shows similar light dependence as with phyBNT ( Fig. 2 D ), with red or blue/far-red light treatment dissociating the interaction.

Our initial studies in yeast established that chromophore binding to phyB is essential for the phyB/CRY1 interaction, but did not reveal the importance of chromophore binding to CRY1 because the chromophore, FAD, is present in yeast. To examine the importance of FAD binding to CRY1, we used a mutant that disrupts FAD binding, D390A. This mutation was previously generated in the homologous region of CRY2 (D387A), where it resulted in a CRY2 protein that expressed well but did not bind FAD ( 12 ). We examined interaction of phyB with CRY1 (D390A). Although CRY1 D390A expressed well, it failed to interact with phyB ( Fig. 2 E ), providing strong support that FAD conjugation to CRY1 is required for phyB interaction.

DISCUSSION

Here, we show that a direct interaction occurs in vitro and in a yeast heterologous system between unstimulated CRY1 and phyB Pr. The functional consequences of this interaction in plants are unknown. In vivo , this interaction could serve to directly regulate activity or control binding to downstream effectors. For example, phytochrome and cryptochrome could form part of a larger scaffolding complex allowing local concentration of signaling molecules and cross-talk between multiple effectors ( 41 , 42 ). Such a complex could also contain other photoreceptors; for example, both phyB and CRY1 have been found to bind to ADO1/ZTL/LKP1, a LOV domain-containing photosensory protein ( 43 ).

Previous genetic studies have speculated on interaction between cryptochrome and phytochrome pathways. One early study found that irradiating plant seedlings with blue, but not red, light caused subsequent illumination with red light to have a larger effect on hypocotyl growth ( 22 ). In studies of hypocotyl growth, cry1 and phyB mutants were used to show synergistic interaction of CRY1 and phyB pathways under specific light conditions ( 14 , 16 , 44 ). phyB and cryptochromes were also found to synergistically regulate root greening in a process where the C terminus of phyB was found to be dispensable ( 20 ). In a previously mentioned study with the L407F CRY1 mutant, plants showed a substantial increase in the rate of red light-dependent germination, which was completely reversed by far-red light ( 40 ). As the seed germination pathway is thought to be controlled by phytochromes but not cryptochromes (and by phyB in response to red light), the authors speculated that CRY1 L407F increases the sensitivity of phyB signaling in this pathway. This conclusion, along with our results that CRY1 L407F fails to bind phyB in the dark, suggests the possibility that CRY1 could negatively regulate phyB activity. Although these and other possibilities have yet to be fully explored, it seems possible that direct phytochrome-cryptochrome interactions may play a significant role in mediating cross-talk between red/far-red- and blue light-regulated pathways in plants.

In plants, CRY1 and phyB colocalize in the cytosol in the dark, and thus, it is possible that such an interaction may occur in the cytosol. Upon light stimulation, Pfr phyB moves into the nucleus, ( 45 , 46 ), although the Pr and Pfr forms of phyB contain overlapping absorbance spectra, and some phyB remains in the cytosol even in the light ( 47 ). Although CRY1 remains mostly in the cytosol in light, a small amount of CRY1 is nuclear-localized ( 48 ), and CRY1 appears to have separable functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm ( 49 ). Thus, the possibility also exists for formation of a CRY1-phyB complex in the nucleus (upon phyB reversion to the Pr state). Follow-up studies will be needed in plants to investigate these possibilities.

Our work provides the first demonstration of a direct light-dependent interaction between phytochromes and cryptochromes, as previously reported interactions between phyB/CRY2 and phyA/CRY1 were not shown to be directly dependent on the photostimulated state of the proteins. The phyB interaction also represents the first interaction of any Arabidopsis cryptochrome that is specific to the dark state as all previously identified light-dependent interactions occur with the light-stimulated conformation. The specific light- and ligand-dependent requirements of this interaction may have hindered its discovery as an interaction would only be detected under dark or far-red light conditions and in the presence of chromophore. Live cell imaging of the interaction would also be difficult as imaging using typical fluorescent reporters such as CFP, GFP, YFP, or RFP would dissociate the interaction.

We found that the truncated CRY1 PHR domain interacts preferentially with phyB Pr, but that this domain also interacts to some degree with both apo-phyB and phyB Pfr. This result suggests that the C terminus of CRY1 regulates interaction with phyB by preventing interaction with the apo and Pfr forms. We propose that in the apo or Pfr states, phyB is prevented from interacting with CRY1 by the CRY1 C terminus, but that conversion of phyB to the Pr state removes the steric conflict and allows binding ( Fig. 5 ). Our studies with the CRY(551) truncation mutant reveal that a short extension at the C-terminal PHR domain (amino acids 507–551) is of critical importance in conferring light specificity to the interaction, prevent binding to apo-phyB and phyB Pfr. On the other hand, although this short extension is essential for preventing interaction with non-Pr phyB, it does not play a role in conferring light specificity to CRY1; the truncated CRY1 PHR domain alone, without this extension, shows tight blue light dependence in interaction with phyB Pr.

Although the function of the CRY1/phyB interaction in plants remains to be elucidated, our work in yeast shows that these proteins can mediate tight light-dependent control of protein transcription in a heterologous system. A number of recent studies have explored using plant photoreceptor proteins to mediate light-dependent protein interactions with precise spatial and temporal resolution for control of cellular processes. For instance, an interaction between phyB and PIF3 was used for precise, light-inducible control of transcription in yeast ( 50 ), an interaction between phyB and PIF6 was used to inducibly activate small GTPases using light ( 51 ), an interaction with CRY2 and CIB1 was used to generate a light-activated Cre recombinase ( 33 ), and an interaction between an engineered phototropin LOV2 domain and a PDZ domain was used to control cell polarity ( 39 ). As phyB and CRY1 interact in dark or far-red light and dissociate in red and blue light, they may well complement other optogenetic modules such as the phyB/PIF6 system ( 51 ), which respond in the opposite manner.
