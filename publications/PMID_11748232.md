The recently cloned gene p73 is a close homologue of p53, which is a crucial 
tumor suppressor gene for preventing the malignant transformation of cells by 
inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Previous reports have shown that 
architectural DNA-bending/looping chromosomal proteins HMGB1 and HMGB2 (formerly 
known as HMG1 and HMG2), which function in a number of biological processes 
including transcription and DNA repair, interact in vitro with p53 and stimulate 
p53 binding to DNA containing p53 consensus sites. Here, we report that HMGB1 
physically interacts with two splicing variants of p73, alpha and beta 
(pull-down assay), and enhances binding of p73 to specific cognate DNA sites 
(gel-shift assay). Both HMG box domains of HMGB1, A and B, interact with 
p73alpha. Association of HMGB1 with p73, like the demonstrated ability of HMGB1 
to stimulate p73 binding to different p53-responsive elements, requires the 
oligomerization region and/or region between DNA-binding domain and 
oligomerization domain of p73 (residues 312-381). Transient transfections 
revealed that ectopically expressed or endogenous HMGB1 and HMGB2 (antisense 
strategy) significantly inhibit in vivo both p73alpha/beta- and p53-dependent 
transactivation from the Bax gene promoter (and much less from Mdm2 and 
p21(waf1) promoters) in p53-deficient SAOS-2 cells. In contrast, HMGB1 and HGMB2 
stimulate p73- or p53-dependent transactivation in p53-deficient H1299 cells, 
irrespective of the promoter used. Our results suggest that ubiquitously 
expressed HMGB1 and HMGB2 have potential to cell- and promoter-specifically 
down- or up-regulate in vivo transcriptional activity of different members of 
the p53 family. A possible mechanism of HMGB1-mediated modulation of p73- and 
p53-dependent transactivation is discussed.
