Sirtuins or Sir2 (silent information regulator 2)-related enzymes have 
originally been defined as a family of nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide-dependent enzymes that deacetylate lysine residue on various 
proteins. Certain sirtuins have in addition an ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. 
The sirtuins are remarkably conserved throughout evolution from archaebacteria 
to eukaryotes. The mammalian sirtuins SIRT1-SIRT7 are implicated in a variety of 
cellular functions ranging from gene silencing, over the control of the cell 
cycle and apoptosis, to energy homeostasis. On a whole-body level, the wide 
range of cellular activities of the sirtuins suggests that they could constitute 
therapeutic targets to combat metabolic, neurodegenerative, and proliferative 
diseases. Here, we review some of the recent data related to the sirtuins and 
discuss their mode of action, their biological role in cellular and organismal 
models, and their possible association to age-related human diseases.
