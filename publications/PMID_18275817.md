ASPP1 and ASPP2 are activators of p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas iASPP is an 
inhibitor of p53. Binding assays showed differential binding for C-terminal 
domains of iASPP and ASPP2 to the core domains of p53 family members p53, p63, 
and p73. We also determined a high-resolution crystal structure for the C 
terminus of iASPP, comprised of four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain. The 
crystal lattice revealed an interaction between eight sequential residues in one 
iASPP molecule and the p53-binding site of a neighboring molecule. ITC confirmed 
that a peptide corresponding to the crystallographic interaction shows specific 
binding to iASPP. The contributions of ankyrin repeat residues, in addition to 
those of the SH3 domain, generate distinctive architecture at the p53-binding 
site suitable for inhibition by small molecules. These results suggest that the 
binding properties of iASPP render it a target for antitumor therapeutics and 
provide a peptide-based template for compound design.
