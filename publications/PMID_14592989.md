Active macromolecular transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm proceeds 
through nuclear pore complexes and is mostly mediated by transport receptors of 
the importin beta-superfamily. Here we identify exportin 6 (Exp6) as a novel 
family member from higher eukaryotes and show that it mediates nuclear export of 
profilin.actin complexes. Exp6 appears to contact primarily actin, but the 
interaction is greatly enhanced by the presence of profilin. Profilin thus 
functions not only as the nucleotide exchange factor for actin, but can also be 
regarded as a cofactor of actin export and hence as a suppressor of actin 
polymerization in the nucleus. Even though human and Drosophila Exp6 share only 
approximately 20% identical amino acid residues, their function in 
profilin.actin export is conserved. A knock-down of Drosophila Exp6 by RNA 
interference abolishes nuclear exclusion of actin and results in the appearance 
of nuclear actin paracrystals. In contrast to a previous report, we found no 
indications of a major and direct role for CRM1 in actin export from mammalian 
or insect nuclei.

Abstract

Active macromolecular transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm proceeds through nuclear pore complexes and is mostly mediated by transport receptors of the importin β-superfamily. Here we identify exportin 6 (Exp6) as a novel family member from higher eukaryotes and show that it mediates nuclear export of profilin·actin complexes. Exp6 appears to contact primarily actin, but the interaction is greatly enhanced by the presence of profilin. Profilin thus functions not only as the nucleotide exchange factor for actin, but can also be regarded as a cofactor of actin export and hence as a suppressor of actin polymerization in the nucleus. Even though human and Drosophila Exp6 share only ∼20% identical amino acid residues, their function in profilin·actin export is conserved. A knock-down of Drosophila Exp6 by RNA interference abolishes nuclear exclusion of actin and results in the appearance of nuclear actin paracrystals. In contrast to a previous report, we found no indications of a major and direct role for CRM1 in actin export from mammalian or insect nuclei.

Introduction

The nuclear envelope separates eukaryotic cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The nucleus is specialized in DNA replication and transcription, RNA processing and assembly of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), while the cytoplasm harbours the translation machinery, for example, and most cytoskeletal elements such as microtubules and actin filaments. This compartmentalization certainly provides many advantages, but also necessitates nucleocytoplasmic transport: the nucleus lacks protein synthesis and therefore has to import each and every protein from the cytoplasm. Conversely, the cytoplasm relies on a nuclear supply of tRNAs, mRNA and ribosomes.

All nucleocytoplasmic exchange proceeds through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which permit passage of material through two modes: passive diffusion and facilitated translocation (reviewed in Mattaj and Englmeier, 1998 ; Görlich and Kutay, 1999 ; Conti and Izaurralde, 2001 ; Weis, 2003 ). Passive diffusion is fast for small molecules, but becomes increasingly inefficient as the mass of the diffusing species approaches a limit of 20–40 kDa. In contrast, facilitated translocation can accommodate the transport of even very large objects. It is often coupled to an input of metabolic energy (active transport), which permits import or export cargoes to accumulate even against steep gradients of chemical activity ( Görlich et al ., 2003 ).

Most of these active nuclear transport pathways are mediated by nuclear transport receptors of the importin β-superfamily (reviewed in Wozniak et al ., 1998 ; Görlich and Kutay, 1999 ; Imamoto, 2000 ; Macara, 2001 ; Strom and Weis, 2001 ). These receptors circulate between nucleus and cytoplasm, recognize cargo molecules and transfer them from one side of the nuclear envelope to the other. To achieve unidirectional transport, positional information is provided by a RanGTP gradient across the nuclear membrane ( Görlich et al ., 1996 ; Izaurralde et al ., 1997 ; Kalab et al ., 2002 ; Smith et al ., 2002 ; Görlich et al ., 2003 ). Nuclear transport receptors are RanGTP-binding proteins and respond to this gradient by loading and unloading their cargo in the appropriate compartment. Nuclear import mediators (importins) recruit cargo at low RanGTP levels in the cytoplasm and release it upon RanGTP binding in the nucleus ( Rexach and Blobel, 1995 ; Görlich et al ., 1996 ). They return as RanGTP complexes to the cytoplasm, where the Ran-bound GTP is hydrolyzed, the complex dissociated and the importin enabled to bind and import another substrate ( Bischoff and Görlich, 1997 ; Floer et al ., 1997 ). Exportins function in exactly the opposite manner. They recruit cargo at high RanGTP levels in the nucleus, forming ternary cargo·exportin·RanGTP complexes ( Fornerod et al ., 1997b ; Kutay et al ., 1997 ); these complexes are transferred through NPCs into the cytoplasm, where GTP is hydrolyzed and the export complex disassembled. The cargo-free and Ran-free exportin can then re-enter the nucleus and export another cargo molecule.

Human cells employ at least 11 different importins as well as 10 adaptor·importin β-heterodimers to distinguish the thousands of different nuclear import cargoes from proteins with a non-nuclear destination (reviewed by Strom and Weis, 2001 ). The export side appears no less demanding. Several highly abundant export substrates, such as ribosomes, mRNAs, tRNAs and import adaptors, as well as a much larger number of regulatory factors must be exported from the nuclei ( Izaurralde, 2002 ; Johnson et al ., 2002 ; Lei and Silver, 2002 ; Simos et al ., 2002 ). The nuclear export machinery also antagonizes the constant leakage of cytoplasmic proteins into the nuclear compartment and expels translation factors, for example, into the cytoplasm ( Mingot et al ., 2001 ; Bohnsack et al ., 2002 ; Calado et al ., 2002 ).

The nuclear export mediators known so far comprise the mRNA export factors (reviewed in Izaurralde, 2002 ) and six members of the importin β-superfamily. CRM1/exportin 1 ( Fornerod et al ., 1997a ; Stade et al ., 1997 ) is the exportin with the broadest substrate specificity and exports a large number of proteins with leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs) and several RNPs such as ribosomes, SRP and U snRNAs. CAS/exportin 2 accounts for the recycling of importin α adaptors to the cytoplasm ( Kutay et al ., 1997 ). Exportin-t mediates export of tRNA ( Arts et al ., 1998 ; Kutay et al ., 1998 ), exportin 5 (Exp5) exports tRNA, the translation elongation factor 1A and certain minihelix-containing RNAs ( Bohnsack et al ., 2002 ; Calado et al ., 2002 ; Gwizdek et al ., 2003 ), while exportin 4 (Exp4) has so far only a single substrate, eIF5A ( Lipowsky et al ., 2000 ). Finally, importin 13 is quite unique in that it moves different cargoes in opposite directions ( Mingot et al ., 2001 ). It imports several proteins, but also exports the translation initiation factor eIF1A from nuclei.

While characterizing a novel human exportin, we identified β-actin and profilin I as export cargoes. β-Actin is one of three actin types and the predominant form in non-muscle cells ( Pollard and Earnshaw, 2002 ). It forms the cytoplasmic microfilaments, which in turn serve as tracks for myosin-type motor proteins, control cell shape, aid phagocytosis and form the contractile ring that separates daughter cells after nuclear division. Actin filaments (F-actin) can be highly dynamic, whereby the barbed (+) end of the filament grows by the addition of ATP-charged actin monomers (G-actin), and the pointed (–) end shrinks by releasing G-actin in its ADP form. A great number of regulatory factors control these dynamics by either sequestering G-actin, stabilizing or destabilizing the filaments, or seeding new filaments. Profilin is one of these regulators and a central and highly abundant constituent of the actin-system ( Schluter et al ., 1997 ; Pollard and Borisy, 2003 ). It binds selectively to G-actin and causes two types of effects: First, it suppresses the spontaneous (i.e. non-nucleated) polymerization into F-actin ( Carlsson et al ., 1977 ; Reichstein and Korn, 1979 ). Secondly, profilin functions as a nucleotide-exchange factor and catalyzes the efficient conversion of ADP– G-actin to the ATP form, which in turn is required for the controlled growth of actin filaments ( Mockrin and Korn, 1980 ; Wolven et al ., 2000 ; Lu and Pollard, 2001 ). Profilin·actin·ATP complexes represent the preferred substrate for filament elongation. Profilin itself interacts with numerous additional regulators, which typically bind profilin via proline-rich domains and thereby recruit profilin·actin complexes to sites of actin-filament growth ( Holt and Koffer, 2001 ).

We identify here exportin 6 (Exp6) as a novel nuclear export receptor and profilin·actin complexes as its predominant or even sole cargo. It is well established that nuclei are void of phalloidin-stainable actin filaments. This could be achieved, at least in part, by confining nucleators of actin polymerization to the cytoplasm. In addition, however, free nuclear actin must be kept below the critical concentration for polymerization and steady nuclear export of profilin·actin complexes along the Exp6 pathway appears an elegant solution to this problem.
