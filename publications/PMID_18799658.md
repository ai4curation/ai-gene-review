Many plant species exhibit seasonal variation of flowering time in response to 
daylength. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) flowers earlier under long days 
(LDs) than under short days (SDs). This quantitative response to photoperiod is 
characterized by two parameters, the critical photoperiod (Pc), below which 
there is a delay in flowering, and the ceiling photoperiod (Pce), below which 
there is no further delay. Thus Pc and Pce define the thresholds beyond which 
maximum LD and SD responses are observed, respectively. We studied the 
quantitative response to photoperiod in 49 mutants selected for early flowering 
in SDs. Nine of these mutants exhibited normal Pce and Pc, showing that their 
precocious phenotype was not linked to abnormal measurement of daylength. 
However, we observed broad diversification in the patterns of quantitative 
responses in the other mutants. To identify factors involved in abnormal 
measurement of daylength, we analyzed the association of these various patterns 
with morphogenetic and rhythmic defects. A high proportion of mutants with 
altered Pce exhibited abnormal hypocotyl elongation in the dark and altered 
circadian periods of leaf movements. This suggested that the circadian clock and 
negative regulators of photomorphogenesis may contribute to the specification of 
SD responses. In contrast, altered Pc correlated with abnormal hypocotyl 
elongation in the light and reduced photosynthetic light-input requirements for 
bolting. This indicated that LD responses may be specified by positive elements 
of light signal transduction pathways and by regulators of resource allocation. 
Furthermore, the frequency of circadian defects in mutants with normal 
photoperiodic responses suggested that the circadian clock may regulate the 
number of leaves independently of its effect on daylength perception.
