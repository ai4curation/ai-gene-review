Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse biological 
processes; however, few have been identified that regulate immune cell 
differentiation and function. Here, we identified lnc-DC, which was exclusively 
expressed in human conventional dendritic cells (DCs). Knockdown of lnc-DC 
impaired DC differentiation from human monocytes in vitro and from mouse bone 
marrow cells in vivo and reduced capacity of DCs to stimulate T cell activation. 
lnc-DC mediated these effects by activating the transcription factor STAT3 
(signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). lnc-DC bound directly to 
STAT3 in the cytoplasm, which promoted STAT3 phosphorylation on tyrosine-705 by 
preventing STAT3 binding to and dephosphorylation by SHP1. Our work identifies a 
lncRNA that regulates DC differentiation and also broadens the known mechanisms 
of lncRNA action.
