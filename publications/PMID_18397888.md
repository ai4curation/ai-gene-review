Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common cause of familial 
and apparently sporadic Parkinson disease. LRRK2 is a multidomain protein kinase 
with autophosphorylation activity. It has previously been shown that the kinase 
activity of LRRK2 is required for neuronal toxicity, suggesting that 
understanding the mechanism of kinase activation and regulation may be important 
for the development of specific kinase inhibitors for Parkinson disease 
treatment. Here, we show that LRRK2 predominantly exists as a dimer under native 
conditions, a state that appears to be stabilized by multiple domain-domain 
interactions. Furthermore, an intact C terminus, but not N terminus, is required 
for autophosphorylation activity. We identify two residues in the activation 
loop that contribute to the regulation of LRRK2 autophosphorylation. Finally, we 
demonstrate that LRRK2 undergoes intramolecular autophosphorylation. Together, 
these results provide insight into the mechanism and regulation of LRRK2 kinase 
activity.
