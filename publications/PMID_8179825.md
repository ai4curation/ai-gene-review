Human melanoma cells, but not tumor cells of other histological origin, express 
a unique membrane-associated glycoprotein, designated ME20-M, and secrete a 
soluble glycoprotein, designated ME20-S, defined by monoclonal antibody ME20. 
Here we report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone that when 
transfected into COS cells directs the expression of ME20-M and ME20-S. This 
cDNA contains an open reading frame which encodes a 661-amino-acid-long 
precursor that contains a 23-amino-acid signal peptide and a 26-amino-acid 
transmembrane domain, separated by a hydrophilic region containing 5 potential 
Asn-linked and 14 predicted Pro-associated, Thr-linked glycosylation sites. The 
transmembrane domain is followed by a carboxy-terminal 45-amino-acid putative 
intracellular domain rich in Ser residues. Analysis of ME20-M by amino acid 
sequencing identified the proteolytic processing site. Signal peptide cleavage 
occurs at the Thr-24-Lys-25 peptide bond of the precursor and results in the 
637-amino-acid ME20-M with a calculated molecular weight of 67,782. ME20-M is 
derived from a single 3.3- to 3.4-kb mRNA transcript that is expressed at 
varying levels in melanoma cell lines, correlating with immunofluorescence 
determination of protein expression. The amino acid sequence of the ME20 antigen 
deduced from the cDNA differs from the human neonatal melanocyte-specific Pmel 
17 gene product by a single amino acid substitution and deletion of 7 amino acid 
residues, and it is 80% homologous with the bovine retinal pigment RPE1 
cDNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
