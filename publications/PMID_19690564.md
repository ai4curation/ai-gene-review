Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to substrates is crucial to protein 
degradation, transcription regulation and cell signalling. Highly specific 
interactions between ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) and ubiquitin protein E3 
ligases fulfil essential roles in this process. We performed a global yeast-two 
hybrid screen to study the specificity of interactions between catalytic domains 
of the 35 human E2s with 250 RING-type E3s. Our analysis showed over 300 
high-quality interactions, uncovering a large fraction of new E2-E3 pairs. Both 
within the E2 and the E3 cohorts, several members were identified that are more 
versatile in their interaction behaviour than others. We also found that the 
physical interactions of our screen compare well with reported functional E2-E3 
pairs in in vitro ubiquitination experiments. For validation we confirmed the 
interaction of several versatile E2s with E3s in in vitro protein interaction 
assays and we used mutagenesis to alter the E3 interactions of the E2 specific 
for K63 linkages, UBE2N(Ubc13), towards the K48-specific UBE2D2(UbcH5B). Our 
data provide a detailed, genome-wide overview of binary E2-E3 interactions of 
the human ubiquitination system.
