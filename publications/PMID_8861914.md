Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) is a transcription factor 
of the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) family. Mice with a null 
mutation of ICSBP exhibit two prominent phenotypes related to previously 
described activities of the IRF family. The first is enhanced susceptibility to 
virus infections associated with impaired production of IFN(gamma). The second 
is deregulated hematopoiesis in both ICSBP-/- and ICSBP+/- mice that manifests 
as a syndrome similar to human chronic myelogenous leukemia. The chronic period 
of the disease progresses to a fatal blast crisis characterized by a clonal 
expansion of undifferentiated cells. Normal mice injected with cells from mice 
in blast crisis developed acute leukemia within 6 weeks of transfer. These 
results suggest a novel role for ICSBP in regulating the proliferation and 
differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.
