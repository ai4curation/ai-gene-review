The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) binds peptides in its 
cytosolic part and subsequently translocates the peptides into the lumen of the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where assembly of major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) class I and peptide takes place. Tapasin is a subunit of the TAP complex 
and binds both to TAP1 and MHC class I. In the absence of tapasin, the assembly 
of MHC class I in the ER is impaired, and the surface expression is reduced. To 
clarify the function of tapasin in the processing of antigenic peptides, we 
studied the interaction of peptide and TAP, peptide transport across the 
membrane of the ER, and association of peptides with MHC class I molecules in 
the microsomes derived from tapasin mutant cell line 721.220, its sister cell 
line 721.221 expressing tapasin, and their HLA-A2 transfectants. The binding of 
peptides to TAP in tapasin mutant 721.220 cells was significantly diminished in 
comparison with 721.221 cells. Impaired peptide-TAP interaction resulted in a 
defective peptide transport in tapasin mutant 721.220 cells. Interestingly, 
despite the diminished peptide binding to TAP, the transport rate of 
TAP-associated peptides was not significantly altered in 721.220 cells. After 
transfection of tapasin cDNA into 721.220 cells, efficient peptide-TAP 
interaction was restored. Thus, we conclude that tapasin is required for 
efficient peptide-TAP interaction.
