The interaction between the low molecular weight G protein ras p21 and a 
guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) uncouples a heterotrimeric G 
protein (Gk) from muscarinic receptors. Through the use of isolated atrial cell 
membranes and genetically engineered GAP deletion mutants, the src homology 
regions (SH2-SH3) at the amino terminus of GAP have been identified as the 
domains responsible for this effect. Deletion of the domain required to 
stimulate the guanosine triphosphatase activity of ras p21 relieves the 
requirement for ras p21 in this system. A model is presented that suggests that 
ras p21 induces a conformational change in GAP, which allows the SH2-SH3 regions 
of GAP to function.
