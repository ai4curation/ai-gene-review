The human MOCS3 gene encodes a protein involved in activation and sulfuration of 
the C terminus of MOCS2A, the smaller subunit of the molybdopterin (MPT) 
synthase. MPT synthase catalyzes the formation of the dithiolene group of MPT 
that is required for the coordination of the molybdenum atom in the last step of 
molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis. The two-domain protein MOCS3 catalyzes 
both the adenylation and the subsequent generation of a thiocarboxylate group at 
the C terminus of MOCS2A by its C-terminal rhodanese-like domain (RLD). The low 
activity of MOCS3-RLD with thiosulfate as sulfur donor and detailed mutagenesis 
studies showed that thiosulfate is most likely not the physiological sulfur 
source for Moco biosynthesis in eukaryotes. It was suggested that an L-cysteine 
desulfurase might be involved in the sulfuration of MOCS3 in vivo. In this 
report, we investigated the involvement of the human L-cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 
in sulfur transfer to MOCS3-RLD. A variant of Nfs1 was purified in conjunction 
with Isd11 in a heterologous expression system in Escherichia coli, and the 
kinetic parameters of the purified protein were determined. By studying direct 
protein-protein interactions, we were able to show that Nfs1 interacted 
specifically with MOCS3-RLD and that sulfur is transferred from L-cysteine to 
MOCS3-RLD via an Nfs1-bound persulfide intermediate. Because MOCS3 was shown to 
be located in the cytosol, our results suggest that cytosolic Nfs1 has an 
important role in sulfur transfer for the biosynthesis of Moco.
