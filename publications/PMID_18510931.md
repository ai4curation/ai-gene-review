During gastrulation of the amphibian embryo, specification of the three germ 
layers, endo-, ecto-, and mesoderm, is regulated by maternal and zygotic 
mechanisms. Although it is known that mesoderm specification requires the 
cooperation between TGF-beta signaling and p53 activity and requires maternal 
factors, essential zygotic factors have been elusive. Here, we report that the 
Zn-finger protein XFDL156 is an ectodermal, zygotic factor that suppresses 
mesodermal differentiation. XFDL156 overexpression suppresses mesodermal 
markers, and its depletion induces aberrant mesodermal differentiation in the 
presumptive ectoderm. Furthermore, we find that XFDL156 and its mammalian 
homologs interact with the C-terminal regulatory region of p53, thereby 
inhibiting p53 target gene induction and mesodermal differentiation. Thus, 
XFDL156 actively restricts mesodermal differentiation in the presumptive 
ectoderm by controlling the spatiotemporal responsiveness to p53.
