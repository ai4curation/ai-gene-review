The MDM2 homolog MDMX is an important regulator of p53 during mouse embryonic 
development. DNA damage promotes MDMX phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, 
and degradation by MDM2. Here we show that MDMX copurifies with 14-3-3, and DNA 
damage stimulates MDMX binding to 14-3-3. Chk2-mediated phosphorylation of MDMX 
on S367 is important for stimulating 14-3-3 binding, MDMX nuclear import by a 
cryptic nuclear import signal, and degradation by MDM2. Mutation of MDMX S367 
inhibits ubiquitination and degradation by MDM2, and prevents MDMX nuclear 
import. Expression of 14-3-3 stimulates the degradation of phosphorylated MDMX. 
Chk2 and 14-3-3 cooperatively stimulate MDMX ubiquitination and overcome the 
inhibition of p53 by MDMX. These results suggest that MDMX-14-3-3 interaction 
plays a role in p53 response to DNA damage by regulating MDMX localization and 
stability.
