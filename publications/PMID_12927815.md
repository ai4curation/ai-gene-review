The centrosomal protein ninein has been identified as a microtubules minus end 
capping, centriole position, and anchoring protein, but the true physiological 
function remains to be determined. In this report, using immunofluorescence 
analysis and GFP-fusions we show that coiled-coil II domain (CCII domain, 
1303-2096) co-localized with gamma-tubulin and centrin at the centrosome. We 
further narrow down within 83 amino acids and classify a new centrosomal 
targeting signal. Interestingly, antibodies raised against CCII domain reveal 
that ninein protein declines from spindle poles during mitosis, but 
reaccumulates at centrosomes at the end of cell division. Moreover, the data 
also suggest that fragment 1783-1866 may be attributed to declined signal of 
ninein. In kinase assay, we show that CCII domain could readily be 
phosphorylated by AIK and PKA. Taken together, our results suggest that ninein 
protein contains two distinct subdomains which are required for targeting and 
regulating asymmetry centrosomes. Importantly, the decline of ninein during 
mitosis implies that this centrosomal protein may play a role to regulate the 
process of chromosome segregation without discrimination. The model we propose 
here will foster a clearer picture of how two asymmetric centrosomes could 
direct and ensure the correct segregation of chromosomes during the mitotic 
stage.
