Apoptosis has an important role during development to regulate cell number. In 
differentiated cells, however, activation of autophagy has a critical role by 
enabling cells to remain functional following stress. In this study, we show 
that the antiapoptotic BCL-2 homologue MCL-1 has a key role in controlling both 
processes in a developmentally regulated manner. Specifically, MCL-1 degradation 
is an early event not only following induction of apoptosis, but also under 
nutrient deprivation conditions where MCL-1 levels regulate activation of 
autophagy. Furthermore, deletion of MCL-1 in cortical neurons of transgenic mice 
activates a robust autophagic response. This autophagic response can, however, 
be converted to apoptosis by either reducing the levels of the autophagy 
regulator Beclin-1, or by a concomitant activation of BAX. Our results define a 
pathway whereby MCL-1 has a key role in determining cell fate, by coordinately 
regulating apoptosis and autophagy.
