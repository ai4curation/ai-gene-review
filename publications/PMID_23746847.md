A major challenge for metazoans is to ensure that different tissues, each 
expressing distinctive proteomes, are nevertheless well protected at an 
organismal level from proteotoxic stress. We show that expression of endogenous 
metastable proteins in muscle cells, which rely on chaperones for proper 
folding, induces a systemic stress response throughout multiple tissues of 
C. elegans. Suppression of misfolding in muscle cells can be achieved not only 
by enhanced expression of HSP90 in muscle cells but as effectively by elevated 
expression of HSP90 in intestine or neuronal cells. This cell-nonautonomous 
control of HSP90 expression relies upon transcriptional feedback between somatic 
tissues that is regulated by the FoxA transcription factor PHA-4. This 
transcellular chaperone signaling response maintains organismal proteostasis 
when challenged by a local tissue imbalance in folding and provides the basis 
for organismal stress-sensing surveillance.
