Photosynthetic organisms must achieve a delicate balance between the light 
energy absorbed by chlorophyll and their capacity to channel that energy into 
productive photochemical reactions. Release of excess absorbed energy in the 
cell can cause lethal photooxidative damage. We identified a basic 
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, designated PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING 
FACTOR 1 (PIF1), that negatively regulates chlorophyll biosynthesis. pif1 mutant 
seedlings accumulate excess free protochlorophyllide when grown in the dark, 
with consequent lethal bleaching upon exposure to light. PIF1 interacts 
specifically with the photoactivated conformer of phytochromes A and B, 
suggesting a signaling pathway by which chlorophyll biosynthetic rates are 
tightly controlled during the critical initial emergence of seedlings from 
subterranean darkness into sunlight.
