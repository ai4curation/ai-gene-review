Genetic screens in simple model organisms have identified many of the key 
components of the conserved signal transduction pathways that are oncogenic when 
misregulated. Here, we identify H37N21.1 as a gene that regulates vulval 
induction in let-60(n1046gf), a strain with a gain-of-function mutation in the 
Caenorhabditis elegans Ras orthologue, and show that somatic deletion of Nrbp1, 
the mouse orthologue of this gene, results in an intestinal progenitor cell 
phenotype that leads to profound changes in the proliferation and 
differentiation of all intestinal cell lineages. We show that Nrbp1 interacts 
with key components of the ubiquitination machinery and that loss of Nrbp1 in 
the intestine results in the accumulation of Sall4, a key mediator of stem cell 
fate, and of Tsc22d2. We also reveal that somatic loss of Nrbp1 results in 
tumourigenesis, with haematological and intestinal tumours predominating, and 
that nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1) is downregulated in a range of 
human tumours, where low expression correlates with a poor prognosis. Thus NRBP1 
is a conserved regulator of cell fate, that plays an important role in tumour 
suppression.
