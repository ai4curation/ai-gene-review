S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) acts to integrate nutrient and growth factor signals to 
promote cell growth but also cell survival as a mitochondria-tethered protein 
kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the proapoptotic molecule BAD. Here 
we report that the prefoldin chaperone URI represents a mitochondrial substrate 
of S6K1. In growth factor-deprived or rapamycin-treated cells, URI forms stable 
complexes with protein phosphatase (PP)1gamma at mitochondria, thereby 
inhibiting the activity of the bound enzyme. Growth factor stimulation induces 
disassembly of URI/PP1gamma complexes through S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of 
URI at serine 371. This activates a PP1gamma-dependent negative feedback program 
that decreases S6K1 activity and BAD phosphorylation, thereby altering the 
threshold for apoptosis. These findings establish URI and PP1gamma as integral 
components of an S6K1-regulated mitochondrial pathway dedicated, in part, to 
oppose sustained S6K1 survival signaling and to ensure that the mitochondrial 
threshold for apoptosis is set in accord with nutrient and growth factor 
availability.
