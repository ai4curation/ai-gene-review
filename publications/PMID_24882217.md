Animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes 
at the right place and the right time. Understanding such tight control of host 
defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. By using 
an unbiased approach in the model Caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that 
HLH-30 (known as TFEB in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host 
defense. HLH-30 was activated shortly after Staphylococcus aureus infection, and 
drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including 
antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of 
infection. TFEB was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon S. aureus 
infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several 
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, our data suggest that TFEB is 
a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the 
host response to infection.
