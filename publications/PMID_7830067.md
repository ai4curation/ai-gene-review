Subunit c is normally present as an inner mitochondrial membrane component of 
the F0 section of the ATP synthase complex, but in the late infantile form of 
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) it was also found in lysosomes in high 
concentrations. To explore the mechanism of storage of subunit c, the rates of 
degradation and synthesis of subunit c were measured in fibroblast cell types 
from controls and patients with the late infantile form of NCL. The radiolabel 
from subunit c decreased with time in control cells, whereas no apparent loss of 
radioactivity of subunit c was found in patients' cells. There were no 
significant differences between control cells and cells with disease in the 
degradation of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, an inner membrane protein of 
mitochondria. A combination of pulse-chase and subcellular fractionation 
analysis showed that a delay of intramitochondrial loss from prelabeled subunit 
c was seen in all diseased cells tested. Lysosomal appearance of labeled subunit 
c could be detected after chase for more than 1 week and its radioactivities 
were variable among diseased cell types. The biosynthetic rate of subunit c was 
almost the same in both control and patient cells. Northern blotting analyses 
showed that mRNAs for P1 and P2 genes had no significant difference in lengths 
and amounts between control and patient cells. Results suggest a specific 
failure in the degradation of subunit c after its normal inclusion in 
mitochondria and its consequent accumulation in lysosomes. This is the first 
direct evidence to show a delay of subunit c degradation in the cells from the 
late infantile form of NCL.
