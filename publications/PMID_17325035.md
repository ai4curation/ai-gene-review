Gcn5 was the first transcription-related histone acetyltransferase (HAT) to be 
identified. However, the functions of this enzyme in mammalian cells remain 
poorly defined. Deletion of Gcn5 in mice leads to early embryonic lethality with 
increased apoptosis in mesodermal lineages. Here we show that deletion of p53 
allows Gcn5(-/-) embryos to survive longer, but Gcn5(-/-) p53(-/-) embryos still 
die in midgestation. Interestingly, embryos homozygous for point mutations in 
the Gcn5 catalytic domain survive significantly longer than Gcn5(-/-) or 
Gcn5(-/-) p53(-/-) mice. In contrast to Gcn5(-/-) embryos, Gcn5(hat/hat) embryos 
do not exhibit increased apoptosis but do exhibit severe cranial neural tube 
closure defects and exencephaly. Together, our results indicate that Gcn5 has 
important, HAT-independent functions in early development and that Gcn5 
acetyltransferase activity is required for cranial neural tube closure in the 
mouse.

Gcn5 was the first transcription-related histone acetyltransferase (HAT) to be identified. However, the functions of this enzyme in mammalian cells remain poorly defined. Deletion of Gcn5 in mice leads to early embryonic lethality with increased apoptosis in mesodermal lineages. Here we show that deletion of p53 allows Gcn5−/− embryos to survive longer, but Gcn5−/− p53−/− embryos still die in midgestation. Interestingly, embryos homozygous for point mutations in the Gcn5 catalytic domain survive significantly longer than Gcn5−/− or Gcn5−/− p53−/− mice. In contrast to Gcn5−/− embryos, Gcn5hat/hat embryos do not exhibit increased apoptosis but do exhibit severe cranial neural tube closure defects and exencephaly. Together, our results indicate that Gcn5 has important, HAT-independent functions in early development and that Gcn5 acetyltransferase activity is required for cranial neural tube closure in the mouse.
