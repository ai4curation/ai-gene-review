Oncogene-induced senescence is a p53-dependent defence mechanism against 
uncontrolled proliferation. Consequently, many human tumours harbour p53 
mutations and others show a dysfunctional p53 pathway, frequently by unknown 
mechanisms. Here we identify BRD7 (bromodomain-containing 7) as a protein whose 
inhibition allows full neoplastic transformation in the presence of wild-type 
p53. In human breast tumours harbouring wild-type, but not mutant, p53 the BRD7 
gene locus was frequently deleted and low BRD7 expression was found in a 
subgroup of tumours. Functionally, BRD7 is required for efficient p53-mediated 
transcription of a subset of target genes. BRD7 interacts with p53 and p300 and 
is recruited to target gene promoters, affecting histone acetylation, p53 
acetylation and promoter activity. Thus, BRD7 suppresses tumorigenicity by 
serving as a p53 cofactor required for the efficient induction of p53-dependent 
oncogene-induced senescence.
