Fluid and HCO3- secretion are vital functions of secretory epithelia. In most 
epithelia, this entails HCO3- entry at the basolateral membrane, mediated by the 
Na+-HCO3- cotransporter, pNBC1, and exit at the luminal membrane, mediated by a 
CFTR-SLC26 transporters complex. Here we report that the protein IRBIT 
(inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate [IP3] receptors binding protein released with 
IP3), a previously identified activator of pNBC1, activates both the basolateral 
pNBC1 and the luminal CFTR to coordinate fluid and HCO3- secretion by the 
pancreatic duct. We used video microscopy and ion selective microelectrodes to 
measure fluid secretion and Cl- and HCO3- concentrations in cultured murine 
sealed intralobular pancreatic ducts. Short interference RNA-mediated knockdown 
of IRBIT markedly inhibited ductal pNBC1 and CFTR activities, luminal Cl- 
absorption and HCO3- secretion, and the associated fluid secretion. 
Single-channel measurements suggested that IRBIT regulated CFTR by reducing 
channel mean close time. Furthermore, expression of IRBIT constructs in HEK 
cells revealed that activation of pNBC1 required only the IRBIT PEST domain, 
while activation of CFTR required multiple IRBIT domains, suggesting that IRBIT 
activates these transporters by different mechanisms. These findings define 
IRBIT as a key coordinator of epithelial fluid and HCO3- secretion and may have 
implications to all CFTR-expressing epithelia and to cystic fibrosis.
