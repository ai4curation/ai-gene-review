Myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) was first identified as the leukemic fusion 
protein NPM-MLF1 generated by the t(3;5)(q25.1;q34) chromosomal translocation. 
Although MLF1 expresses normally in a variety of tissues including hematopoietic 
stem cells and the overexpression of MLF1 correlates with malignant 
transformation in human cancer, little is known about how MLF1 is involved in 
the regulation of cell growth. Here we show that MLF1 is a negative regulator of 
cell cycle progression functioning upstream of the tumor suppressor p53. MLF1 
induces p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in murine embryonic fibroblasts. This 
action requires a novel binding partner, subunit 3 of the COP9 signalosome 
(CSN3). A reduction in the level of CSN3 protein with small interfering RNA 
abrogated MLF1-induced G1 arrest and impaired the activation of p53 by genotoxic 
stress. Furthermore, ectopic MLF1 expression and CSN3 knockdown inversely affect 
the endogenous level of COP1, a ubiquitin ligase for p53. Exogenous expression 
of COP1 overcomes MLF1-induced growth arrest. These results indicate that MLF1 
is a critical regulator of p53 and suggest its involvement in leukemogenesis 
through a novel CSN3-COP1 pathway.
