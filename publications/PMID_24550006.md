A common function of the TFIID and SAGA complexes, which are recruited by 
transcriptional activators, is to deliver TBP to promoters to stimulate 
transcription. Neither the relative contributions of the five shared 
TBP-associated factor (TAF) subunits in TFIID and SAGA nor the requirement for 
different domains in shared TAFs for transcriptional activation is well 
understood. In this study, we uncovered the essential requirement for the highly 
conserved C-terminal region (CRD) of Taf9, a shared TAF, for transcriptional 
activation in yeast. Transcriptome profiling performed under Gcn4-activating 
conditions showed that the Taf9 CRD is required for induced expression of ∼9% of 
the yeast genome. The CRD was not essential for the Taf9-Taf6 interaction, TFIID 
or SAGA integrity, or Gcn4 interaction with SAGA in cell extracts. Microarray 
profiling of a SAGA mutant (spt20Δ) yielded a common set of genes induced by 
Spt20 and the Taf9 CRD. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that, 
although the Taf9 CRD mutation did not impair Gcn4 occupancy, the occupancies of 
TFIID, SAGA, and the preinitiation complex were severely impaired at several 
promoters. These results suggest a crucial role for the Taf9 CRD in genome-wide 
transcription and highlight the importance of conserved domains, other than 
histone fold domains, as a common determinant for TFIID and SAGA functions.
