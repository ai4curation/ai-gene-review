The gene for Tom1 was initially identified as a specific target of the oncogene 
v-myb. The Tom1 protein belongs to the VHS domain-containing protein family, and 
it has a GAT domain in a central part as well as an N-terminal VHS domain. VHS 
domain-containing proteins, including Hrs/Vps27, STAM, and GGA proteins, have 
been implicated in intracellular trafficking and sorting, but the role of Tom1 
has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that Tom1 binds directly 
with ubiquitin chains and Tollip, which was initially isolated as a mediator of 
interleukin-1 signaling and has a capacity to bind ubiquitin chains. Gel 
filtration and subsequent Western blot analysis showed that endogenous Tom1 
associates with Tollip to form a complex. In addition, Tom1 was found to be 
capable of binding to clathrin heavy chain through a typical clathrin-binding 
motif. Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that green fluorescent 
protein-Tom1 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas its mutant 
with deletion of the clathrin-binding motif had a diffuse localization 
throughout the cell. Thus, we propose that a Tom1-Tollip complex functions as a 
factor that links polyubiquitinated proteins to clathrin.
