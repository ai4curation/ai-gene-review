The vacuolar protein sorting 75 (Vps75) histone chaperone participates in 
chromatin assembly and disassembly at both active and inactive genes through the 
preferential binding to histone H3-H4. Vps75 is also one of two histone 
chaperones, along with antisilencing factor 1, that promotes histone H3-Lys-56 
acetylation by the regulation of Ty1 transposition protein 109 (Rtt109) histone 
acetyltransferase. Here, we report the x-ray crystal structure of Vps75 and 
carry out biochemical studies to characterize its interaction with Rtt109. We 
find that the Vps75 structure forms a homodimeric "headphone" architecture that 
includes an extended helical dimerization domain and earmuff domains at opposite 
ends and sides of the dimerization domain. Despite the similar overall 
architecture with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein 1 and human 
SET/TAF-1beta/INHAT histone chaperones, Vps75 shows several unique features 
including the relative disposition of the earmuff domains to the dimerization 
domain, characteristics of the earmuff domains, and a pronounced cleft at the 
center of the Vps75 dimer. These differences appear to correlate with the unique 
function of Vps75 to interact with Rtt109 for histone acetylation. Our 
biochemical studies reveal that two surfaces on the earmuff domain of Vps75 
participate in Rtt109 interaction with a stoichiometry of 2:1, thus leaving the 
pronounced central cleft of the Vps75 dimer largely accessible for histone 
binding. Taken together, our data provide a structural framework for 
understanding how Vps75 mediates both nucleosome assembly and histone 
acetylation by Rtt109.
