Autophagy is a potentially inimical pathway and together with apoptosis, may be 
activated by similar stress stimuli that can lead to cell death. The molecular 
cues that dictate the cell fate choice between autophagy and apoptosis remain 
largely unknown. Here we report that the proapoptotic protein BBC3/PUMA (BCL2 
binding component 3) is a bona fide substrate of chaperone-mediated autophagy 
(CMA). BBC3 associates with HSPA8/HSC70 (heat shock 70kDa protein 8), leading to 
its lysosome translocation and uptake. Inhibition of CMA results in 
stabilization of BBC3, which in turn sensitizes tumor cells to undergo 
apoptosis. We further demonstrate that upon TNF (tumor necrosis factor) 
treatment, IKBKB/IKKβ (inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in 
B-cells, kinase β)-mediated BBC3 Ser10 phosphorylation is crucial for BBC3 
stabilization via blocking its degradation by CMA. Mechanistically, Ser10 
phosphorylation facilitates BBC3 translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria. 
BBC3 stabilization resulting from either Ser10 phosphorylation or CMA inhibition 
potentiates TNF-induced apoptotic cell death. Our findings thus reveal that the 
selective degradation of BBC3 underlies the prosurvival role of CMA and define a 
previously unappreciated proapoptotic role of IKBKB that acts through 
phosphorylation-mediated stabilization of BBC3, thereby promoting TNF-triggered 
apoptosis.
