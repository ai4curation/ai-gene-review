The INK4a-ARF locus encodes two unrelated proteins that both function in tumor 
suppression. p16INK4 binds to and inhibits the activity of CDK4 and CDK6, and 
ARF arrests the cell cycle in a p53-dependent manner. We show here that ARF 
binds to MDM2 and promotes the rapid degradation of MDM2. This interaction is 
mediated by the exon 1beta-encoded N-terminal domain of ARF and a C-terminal 
region of MDM2. ARF-promoted MDM2 degradation is associated with MDM2 
modification and concurrent p53 stabilization and accumulation. The functional 
consequence of ARF-regulated p53 levels via MDM2 proteolysis is evidenced by the 
ability of ectopically expressed ARF to restore a p53-imposed G1 cell cycle 
arrest that is otherwise abrogated by MDM2. Thus, deletion of the ARF-INK4a 
locus simultaneously impairs both the INK4a-cyclin D/CDK4-RB and the 
ARF-MDM2-p53 pathways.
