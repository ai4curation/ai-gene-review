The plant Golgi plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of cell wall matrix 
polysaccharides, protein glycosylation, and vesicle trafficking. Golgi-localized 
proteins have become prospective targets for reengineering cell wall 
biosynthetic pathways for the efficient production of biofuels from plant cell 
walls. However, proteomic characterization of the Golgi has so far been limited, 
owing to the technical challenges inherent in Golgi purification. In this study, 
a combination of density centrifugation and surface charge separation techniques 
have allowed the reproducible isolation of Golgi membranes from Arabidopsis 
(Arabidopsis thaliana) at sufficiently high purity levels for in-depth proteomic 
analysis. Quantitative proteomic analysis, immunoblotting, enzyme activity 
assays, and electron microscopy all confirm high purity levels. A composition 
analysis indicated that approximately 19% of proteins were likely derived from 
contaminating compartments and ribosomes. The localization of 13 newly assigned 
proteins to the Golgi using transient fluorescent markers further validated the 
proteome. A collection of 371 proteins consistently identified in all replicates 
has been proposed to represent the Golgi proteome, marking an appreciable 
advancement in numbers of Golgi-localized proteins. A significant proportion of 
proteins likely involved in matrix polysaccharide biosynthesis were identified. 
The potential within this proteome for advances in understanding Golgi processes 
has been demonstrated by the identification and functional characterization of 
the first plant Golgi-resident nucleoside diphosphatase, using a yeast 
complementation assay. Overall, these data show key proteins involved in primary 
cell wall synthesis and include a mixture of well-characterized and unknown 
proteins whose biological roles and importance as targets for future research 
can now be realized.

Abstract

The plant Golgi plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of cell wall matrix polysaccharides, protein glycosylation, and vesicle trafficking. Golgi-localized proteins have become prospective targets for reengineering cell wall biosynthetic pathways for the efficient production of biofuels from plant cell walls. However, proteomic characterization of the Golgi has so far been limited, owing to the technical challenges inherent in Golgi purification. In this study, a combination of density centrifugation and surface charge separation techniques have allowed the reproducible isolation of Golgi membranes from Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) at sufficiently high purity levels for in-depth proteomic analysis. Quantitative proteomic analysis, immunoblotting, enzyme activity assays, and electron microscopy all confirm high purity levels. A composition analysis indicated that approximately 19% of proteins were likely derived from contaminating compartments and ribosomes. The localization of 13 newly assigned proteins to the Golgi using transient fluorescent markers further validated the proteome. A collection of 371 proteins consistently identified in all replicates has been proposed to represent the Golgi proteome, marking an appreciable advancement in numbers of Golgi-localized proteins. A significant proportion of proteins likely involved in matrix polysaccharide biosynthesis were identified. The potential within this proteome for advances in understanding Golgi processes has been demonstrated by the identification and functional characterization of the first plant Golgi-resident nucleoside diphosphatase, using a yeast complementation assay. Overall, these data show key proteins involved in primary cell wall synthesis and include a mixture of well-characterized and unknown proteins whose biological roles and importance as targets for future research can now be realized.

DISCUSSION

This study outlines, to our knowledge, the first high-purity isolation and proteomic characterization of the Golgi apparatus from plants. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that organelle enrichment and subsequent purification by FFE is a powerful combination in the characterization of subcellular proteomes ( Eubel et al., 2008 ; Huang et al., 2009 ). Here, to our knowledge for the first time, such approaches have been employed in the isolation of Golgi membranes from a complex background of contaminants with similar densities and surface charges. A Golgi proteome of 371 proteins, excluding contaminants and protein synthesis proteins, has been proposed, representing a sizable increase in Golgi-localized proteins; SUBA ( Heazlewood et al., 2007 ) lists 173 proteins as experimentally localized to the Golgi. This proteome includes important regulatory and biosynthetic proteins in the secretory pathway of plants as well as many unknown proteins and, therefore, appreciably expands our potential for understanding Golgi-localized processes.

CONCLUSION

This study outlines, to our knowledge, the first isolation and proteomic characterization of high-purity Golgi membranes from plants and marks a significant advancement on previous isolation strategies. This analysis of Golgi membranes will be a hugely important resource enabling the prioritization of research into both known and uncharacterized Golgi proteins. Thus far, many hundreds of proteins have been predicted to act as GTs, and this study provides an opportunity to assess the relative importance of some of these putative GTs in primary cell wall synthesis. Finally, the value of this Golgi proteome was demonstrated through confirmed localization and functional characterization of a plant Golgi NDPase (ATAPY1) that had been previously reported to function at the plasma membrane in nucleotide signaling. This proteomic characterization of the Golgi is a timely addition to plant cell wall science, where the advent of biofuels-related research demands a rapid expansion of the current knowledge base.
