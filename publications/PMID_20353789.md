The beta-2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) has a carboxyl terminus motif that can 
interact with PSD-95/discs-large/ZO1 homology (PDZ) domain-containing proteins. 
In this paper, we identified membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted-3 
(MAGI-3) as a novel binding partner of beta2AR. The carboxyl terminus of beta2AR 
binds with high affinity to the fifth PDZ domain of MAGI-3, with the last four 
amino acids (D-S-L-L) of the receptor being the key determinants of the 
interaction. In cells, the association of full-length beta2AR with MAGI-3 occurs 
constitutively and is enhanced by agonist stimulation of the receptor. Our data 
also demonstrated that beta2AR-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) activation was substantially retarded by MAGI-3 expression. 
These data suggest that MAGI-3 regulates beta2AR-mediated ERK activation through 
the physical interaction between beta2AR and MAGI-3.
