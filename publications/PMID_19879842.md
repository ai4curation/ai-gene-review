DYRKs are kinases that self-activate in vitro by autophosphorylation of a YTY 
motif in the kinase domain, but their regulation in vivo is not well understood. 
In C. elegans zygotes, MBK-2/DYRK phosphorylates oocyte proteins at the end of 
the meiotic divisions to promote the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Here we 
demonstrate that MBK-2 is under both positive and negative regulation during the 
transition. MBK-2 is activated during oocyte maturation by CDK-1-dependent 
phosphorylation of serine 68, a residue outside of the kinase domain required 
for full activity in vivo. The pseudotyrosine phosphatases EGG-4 and EGG-5 
sequester activated MBK-2 until the meiotic divisions by binding to the YTY 
motif and inhibiting MBK-2's kinase activity directly, using a mixed-inhibition 
mechanism that does not involve tyrosine dephosphorylation. Our findings link 
cell-cycle progression to MBK-2/DYRK activation and the oocyte-to-embryo 
transition.
