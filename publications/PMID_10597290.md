Myc family proteins play an important role in cellular processes such as 
proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and transformation. A number of 
interaction partners of Myc have been identified, such as Max, p107, TBP, YY1, 
Miz-1, AP-2 and Nmi. Both Max and Nmi also bind to MycN. In contrast to the well 
defined binding of Max to Myc family proteins the interaction of Nmi with Myc or 
MycN is only poorly characterized. By employing the yeast two-hybrid system we 
have mapped the regions of MycN and Myc responsible for binding to Nmi. For MycN 
exclusively a central region mediates binding to Nmi. In contrast, for Myc a 
C-terminal portion of the protein, and possibly also a central part, is involved 
in Nmi interaction. Nmi does not interact with Max and has no transactivation 
capabilities in yeast, suggesting that Nmi alone is not a transcriptional 
activator in mammalian cells. Immunofluorescence demonstrates that both in 293 
embryonic kidney cells and in Kelly neuroblastoma cells all detectable 
ectopically expressed Nmi is localized in the cytoplasm, in part in a punctate, 
granular pattern. MycN, which is highly expressed in Kelly cells consequent to 
amplification, appears to be localized exclusively in the nuclei. This directly 
demonstrates that in the same cell at least the major proportion of MycN and Nmi 
is localized in different cellular compartments. This result is confirmed by the 
finding that endogenous Nmi, which is expressed in Kelly cells only after 
stimulation with interferon gamma, is detected exclusively in the cytoplasm of 
these cells. Therefore only a very small amount of MycN and Nmi is likely to be 
involved in MycN/Nmi interaction in vivo.
