Most excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain are formed on dendritic spines, 
and spine density has a profound impact on synaptic transmission, integration, 
and plasticity. Membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins are 
intracellular scaffolding proteins with well established roles in synapse 
function. However, whether MAGUK proteins are required for the formation of 
dendritic spines in vivo is unclear. We isolated a novel disc large-5 (Dlg5) 
allele in mice, Dlg5(LP), which harbors a missense mutation in the DLG5 SH3 
domain, greatly attenuating its ability to interact with the DLG5 GUK domain. We 
show here that DLG5 is a MAGUK protein that regulates spine formation, 
synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission in cortical neurons. DLG5 regulates 
synaptogenesis by enhancing the cell surface localization of N-cadherin, 
revealing a key molecular mechanism for regulating the subcellular localization 
of this cell adhesion molecule during synaptogenesis.

Abstract

Most excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain are formed on dendritic spines, and spine density has a profound impact on synaptic transmission, integration, and plasticity. Membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins are intracellular scaffolding proteins with well established roles in synapse function. However, whether MAGUK proteins are required for the formation of dendritic spines in vivo is unclear. We isolated a novel disc large-5 ( Dlg5 ) allele in mice, Dlg5 LP , which harbors a missense mutation in the DLG5 SH3 domain, greatly attenuating its ability to interact with the DLG5 GUK domain. We show here that DLG5 is a MAGUK protein that regulates spine formation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission in cortical neurons. DLG5 regulates synaptogenesis by enhancing the cell surface localization of N -cadherin, revealing a key molecular mechanism for regulating the subcellular localization of this cell adhesion molecule during synaptogenesis.

Introduction

Dendritic spines are the main postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain ( Nimchinsky et al., 2002 ). Spine density, distribution, and morphology exert a profound impact on synaptic transmission, integration, and plasticity ( Elston and DeFelipe, 2002 ; Hayashi and Majewska, 2005 ; Ballesteros-Yáñez et al., 2006 ; Knobloch and Mansuy, 2008 ; Spruston, 2008 ; Bhatt et al., 2009 ). Not surprisingly, alterations in spine density and morphology are associated with numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders ( Irwin et al., 2000 ; Kaufmann and Moser, 2000 ; Knobloch and Mansuy, 2008 ; Penzes et al., 2011 ). A comprehensive picture of the molecular and cellular processes that initiate the formation of dendritic spines and synapses requires the identification and functional analysis of the myriad intracellular components required to orchestrate connectivity in the CNS ( Lippman and Dunaevsky, 2005 ; Tada and Sheng, 2006 ; Yoshihara et al., 2009 ; Saneyoshi et al., 2010 ).

A critical early event in dendritic spine formation and synaptogenesis is the stabilization of trans -synaptic contacts mediated by cell surface proteins; these proteins include neurexins, neuroligins, ephrins, leucine-rich-repeat proteins, and cadherins ( Henkemeyer et al., 2003 ; Craig and Kang, 2007 ; Arikkath and Reichardt, 2008 ; Kayser et al., 2008 ; Suzuki and Takeichi, 2008 ; Ko et al., 2009 ; de Wit et al., 2009 ; Siddiqui and Craig, 2011 ). N -cadherin is the most abundant and widely distributed classical cadherin in the mammalian brain ( Yagi and Takeichi, 2000 ; Togashi et al., 2002 ) and its critical role in dendritic spine formation has been well described. For example, in cultured hippocampal neurons, N -cadherin knockdown using shRNA results in a decrease in dendritic spine density ( Saglietti et al., 2007 ). However, the intracellular mechanisms that localize N -cadherin to the cell surface during dendritic spine formation and synaptogenesis remain poorly understood.

MAGUK proteins are intracellular scaffolding proteins with well established roles in synapse development and function, but whether MAGUK proteins are required for the formation of dendritic spines in vivo remains unclear. Discs large homolog 5 (DLG5) is a member of the discs large (Dlg) family of MAGUK proteins ( de Mendoza et al., 2010 ). The size and domain organization of DLG5 are distinct from other classical Dlg family members. In addition to the PDZ (PDZ-95, Dlg, ZO-1), SH3 (Src Homology 3), and GUK (Guanylate Kinase) domains, Dlg5 also contains an N-terminal CARD (Caspase Activation and Recruitment Domain) domain, a DUF (Domain of Unknown Function) domain, and a coiled-coil domain ( Nechiporuk et al., 2007 ). Previous work shows that DLG5 is important for the delivery and stabilization of cadherin-catenin protein complexes to the plasma membrane of epithelial cells, and loss of Dlg5 in vivo leads to disruption of adherens junctions and epithelial cell polarity in Dlg5 −/− mutant mice ( Nechiporuk et al., 2007 ). How DLG5 might function in other cell types and organ systems is unknown.

We show here that a Dlg5 allele, Dlg5 LP , reveals novel neuronal functions of this MAGUK protein. DLG5 promotes dendritic spine formation and synaptogenesis in cortical pyramidal neurons through the facilitation of N -cadherin localization to the neuronal cell surface. The DLG5 LP mutant protein abolishes key protein domain interactions required for neuronal DLG5 function. These observations lend insight into the function of MAGUK proteins in synaptogenesis and reveal a critical molecular mechanism for regulating the subcellular localization of cell adhesion molecules during synaptogenesis.
