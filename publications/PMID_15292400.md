Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] regulates endocytic and autophagic 
membrane traffic. In order to understand the downstream effects of PtdIns(3)P in 
these processes, it is important to identify PtdIns(3)P-binding proteins, many 
of which contain FYVE zinc-finger domains. Here, we describe a novel giant 
FYVE-domain-containing protein, named autophagy-linked FYVE protein (Alfy). Alfy 
is ubiquitously expressed, shares sequence similarity with the 
Chediak-Higashi-syndrome protein and has putative homologues in flies, nematodes 
and fission yeast. Alfy binds PtdIns(3)P in vitro and partially colocalizes with 
PtdIns(3)P in vivo. Unlike most other FYVE-domain proteins, Alfy is not found on 
endosomes but instead localizes mainly to the nuclear envelope. When HeLa cells 
are starved or treated with a proteasome inhibitor, Alfy relocalizes to 
characteristic filamentous cytoplasmic structures located close to autophagic 
membranes and ubiquitin-containing protein aggregates. By electron microscopy, 
similar structures can be found within autophagosomes. We propose that Alfy 
might target cytosolic protein aggregates for autophagic degradation.
