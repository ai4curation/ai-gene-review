Many mammalian viruses have acquired genes from their hosts during their 
evolution. The rationale for these acquisitions is usually quite clear: the 
captured genes are subverted to provide a selective advantage to the virus. Here 
we describe the opposite situation, where a viral gene has been sequestered to 
serve an important function in the physiology of a mammalian host. This gene, 
encoding a protein that we have called syncytin, is the envelope gene of a 
recently identified human endogenous defective retrovirus, HERV-W. We find that 
the major sites of syncytin expression are placental syncytiotrophoblasts, 
multinucleated cells that originate from fetal trophoblasts. We show that 
expression of recombinant syncytin in a wide variety of cell types induces the 
formation of giant syncytia, and that fusion of a human trophoblastic cell line 
expressing endogenous syncytin can be inhibited by an anti-syncytin antiserum. 
Our data indicate that syncytin may mediate placental cytotrophoblast fusion in 
vivo, and thus may be important in human placental morphogenesis.
