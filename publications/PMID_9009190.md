Most neurons of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) lose the ability to 
regenerate severed axons in vivo after a certain point in development. At least 
part of this loss in regenerative potential is intrinsic to neurons. Although 
embryonic retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can grow axons into tectum of any age, 
most RGCs from older animals fail to extend axons into CNS tissue derived from 
donors of any age, including the embryonic tectum. Here we report that the 
proto-oncogene bcl-2 plays a key role in this developmental change by promoting 
the growth and regeneration of retinal axons. This effect does not seem to be an 
indirect consequence of its well-known anti-apoptotic activity. Another 
anti-apoptotic drug, ZVAD, supported neuronal survival but did not promote axon 
regeneration in culture. This finding could lead to new strategies for the 
treatment of injuries to the CNS.
