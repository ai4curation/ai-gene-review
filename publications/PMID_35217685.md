The adaptor protein complex AP-4 mediates anterograde axonal transport and is 
essential for axon health. AP-4-deficient patients suffer from a severe 
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder. Here we identify DAGLB 
(diacylglycerol lipase-beta), a key enzyme for generation of the endocannabinoid 
2-AG (2-arachidonoylglycerol), as a cargo of AP-4 vesicles. During normal 
development, DAGLB is targeted to the axon, where 2-AG signalling drives axonal 
growth. We show that DAGLB accumulates at the trans-Golgi network of 
AP-4-deficient cells, that axonal DAGLB levels are reduced in neurons from a 
patient with AP-4 deficiency, and that 2-AG levels are reduced in the brains of 
AP-4 knockout mice. Importantly, we demonstrate that neurite growth defects of 
AP-4-deficient neurons are rescued by inhibition of MGLL (monoacylglycerol 
lipase), the enzyme responsible for 2-AG hydrolysis. Our study supports a new 
model for AP-4 deficiency syndrome in which axon growth defects arise through 
spatial dysregulation of endocannabinoid signalling.
