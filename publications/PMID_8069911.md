Adhalin, the 50 kDa dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, is deficient in skeletal 
muscle of patients having severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular 
dystrophy (SCARMD). In several North African families, SCARMD has been linked to 
chromosome 13q, but SCARMD has been excluded from linkage to this locus in other 
families. We have now cloned human adhalin cDNA and mapped the adhalin gene to 
chromosome 17q12-q21.33, excluding it from involvement in 13q-linked SCARMD. 
However, one allelic variant of a polymorphic microsatellite located within 
intron 6 of the adhalin gene cosegregated perfectly with the disease phenotype 
in a large family. Furthermore, missense mutations were identified within the 
adhalin gene that might cause SCARMD in this family. Thus, the adhalin gene is 
involved in at least one form of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy.
