Sulfatases catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate ester bonds from a wide variety of 
substrates. Several human inherited diseases are caused by the deficiency of 
individual sulfatases, while in patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency 
mutations in the Sulfatase Modifying Factor 1 (SUMF1) gene cause a defect in the 
post-translational modification of a cysteine residue into 
C(alpha)-formylglycine (FGly) at the active site of all sulfatases. This unique 
modification mechanism, which is required for catalytic activity, has been 
highly conserved during evolution. Here, we used a genomic approach to 
investigate the relationship between sulfatases and their modifying factors in 
humans and several model systems. First, we determined the complete catalog of 
human sulfatases, which comprises 17 members (versus 14 in rodents) including 
four novel ones (ARSH, ARSI, ARSJ and ARSK). Secondly, we showed that the active 
site, which is the target of the post-translational modification, is the most 
evolutionarily constrained region of sulfatases and shows intraspecies sequence 
convergence. Exhaustive sequence analyses of available proteomes indicate that 
sulfatases are the only likely targets of their modifying factors. Thirdly, we 
showed that sulfatases and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatases share significant 
homology at their active sites, suggesting a common evolutionary origin as well 
as similar catalytic mechanisms. Most importantly, gene association studies 
performed on prokaryotes suggested the presence of at least two additional 
mechanisms of cysteine-to-FGly conversion, which do not require SUMF1. These 
results may have important implications in the study of diseases caused by 
sulfatase deficiencies and in the development of therapeutic strategies.
