Two-hybrid searches with the tumor suppressor MMAC1/PTEN isolated the proteins 
hDLG and hMAST205. Further two-hybrid analysis and microtiter plate binding 
assays localized the sites of interaction to PDZ domains from hDLG and hMAST205 
and the PDZ binding domain at the COOH terminus of MMAC1/PTEN. A synthetic 
peptide derived from the MMAC1/PTEN PDZ binding domain (MMAC1/PTEN-PDZBD) was 
used to coprecipitate proteins from A431 human cell lysate. The recovered 
proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. 
Treatment of this membrane with an anti-hDLG antibody identified a Mr 140,000 
band, consistent with the size of hDLG. Treatment of this membrane with the 
MMAC1/PTEN-PDZBD peptide identified a single prominent band of slightly larger 
than Mr 200,000 (Mr 200,000 kDa). Threonine phosphorylation of the MMAC1/ 
PTEN-PDZBD peptide inhibited both microtiter plate binding to the hDLG and 
hMAST205 PDZ domains and coprecipitation of the Mr 140,000 and > 200,000 
proteins, but promoted coprecipitation of proteins of approximately Mr 90,000 
and Mr 120,000 from A431 cell lysate. This result suggests phosphorylation of 
the MMAC1/PTEN PDZ binding domain can both inhibit and promote PDZ interactions.
