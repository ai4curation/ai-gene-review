Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) regulate diverse cellular functions by cleaving 
ubiquitin from specific protein substrates. How their activities are modulated 
in various cellular contexts remains poorly understood. The yeast deubiquitinase 
Ubp8 protein is recruited and activated by the SAGA complex and, together with 
Sgf11, Sus1, and Sgf73, forms a DUB module responsible for deubiquitinating 
histone H2B during gene expression. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 
complete SAGA DUB module, which features two functional lobes structurally 
coupled by Sgf73. In the "assembly lobe," a long Sgf11 N-terminal helix is 
clamped onto the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain by Sus1. In the "catalytic lobe," an Sgf11 
C-terminal zinc-finger domain binds to the Ubp8 catalytic domain next to its 
active site. Our structural and functional analyses reveal a central role of 
Sgf11 and Sgf73 in activating Ubp8 for deubiquitinating histone H2B and 
demonstrate how a DUB can be allosterically regulated by its nonsubstrate 
partners.
