We describe unrelated individuals with ichthyosis, failure to thrive, 
thrombocytopenia, photophobia, and progressive hearing loss. Each have 
bi-allelic mutations in AP1B1, the gene encoding the β subunit of 
heterotetrameric adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) complexes, which mediate endomembrane 
polarization, sorting, and transport. In affected keratinocytes the AP-1 β 
subunit is lost, and the γ subunit is greatly reduced, demonstrating 
destabilization of the AP-1 complex. Affected cells and tissue contain an 
abundance of abnormal vesicles and show hyperproliferation, abnormal epidermal 
differentiation, and derangement of intercellular junction proteins. 
Transduction of affected cells with wild-type AP1B1 rescues the vesicular 
phenotype, conclusively establishing that loss of AP1B1 function causes this 
disorder.
