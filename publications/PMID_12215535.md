To investigate the role of chromatin remodeling in nucleotide excision repair, 
we prepared mononucleosomes with a 200-bp duplex containing an 
acetylaminofluorene-guanine (AAF-G) adduct at a single site. DNase I 
footprinting revealed a well-phased nucleosome structure with the AAF-G adduct 
near the center of twofold symmetry of the nucleosome core. This mononucleosome 
substrate was used to examine the effect of the SWI/SNF remodeling complex on 
the activity of human excision nuclease reconstituted from six purified excision 
repair factors. We found that the three repair factors implicated in damage 
recognition, RPA, XPA, and XPC, stimulate the remodeling activity of SWI/SNF, 
which in turn stimulates the removal of the AAF-G adduct from the nucleosome 
core by the excision nuclease. This is the first demonstration of the 
stimulation of nucleotide excision repair of a lesion in the nucleosome core by 
a chromatin-remodeling factor and contrasts with the ACF remodeling factor, 
which stimulates the removal of lesions from internucleosomal linker regions but 
not from the nucleosome core.

Abstract

To investigate the role of chromatin remodeling in nucleotide excision repair, we prepared mononucleosomes with a 200-bp duplex containing an acetylaminofluorene-guanine (AAF-G) adduct at a single site. DNase I footprinting revealed a well-phased nucleosome structure with the AAF-G adduct near the center of twofold symmetry of the nucleosome core. This mononucleosome substrate was used to examine the effect of the SWI/SNF remodeling complex on the activity of human excision nuclease reconstituted from six purified excision repair factors. We found that the three repair factors implicated in damage recognition, RPA, XPA, and XPC, stimulate the remodeling activity of SWI/SNF, which in turn stimulates the removal of the AAF-G adduct from the nucleosome core by the excision nuclease. This is the first demonstration of the stimulation of nucleotide excision repair of a lesion in the nucleosome core by a chromatin-remodeling factor and contrasts with the ACF remodeling factor, which stimulates the removal of lesions from internucleosomal linker regions but not from the nucleosome core.

DISCUSSION

Chromatin structure affects every aspect of DNA-protein interactions in eukaryotes, including transcription, replication, recombination, and repair. In general, chromatin inhibits these processes by interfering with enzymes which mediate these reactions ( 7 , 16 , 20 , 21 , 41 , 44 ). Recent work in the transcription field has identified many factors which increase the accessibility of DNA in chromatin to the transcription machinery involved in initiation and elongation. No such specific factors which promote other DNA transactions have been described. However, it has been found that some of the factors identified as transcription accessibility factors have more general roles in promoting the functions of other DNA-acting enzymes as well. For example, SWI/SNF has been found to enhance V(D)J cleavage by RAG1/RAG2 recombinase ( 19 ) by weakening the DNA-protein interactions within the nucleosome. Thus, it is possible that the other histone-modifying and nucleosome-remodeling complexes are general accessibility factors for all DNA-acting enzymes. Indeed, in this study, we show that SWI/SNF, which was originally identified as a chromatin-remodeling transcription factor, in addition to stimulating RAG1/RAG2 recombinase, stimulates human excision nuclease as well. To put our findings in the broader context of chromatin remodeling and repair, in the following we briefly discuss the effects of DNA damage on nucleosome stability, summarize current knowledge on nucleotide excision repair of nucleosomal DNA in vitro, and present a plausible model for the cooperation of nucleosome-remodeling factors and excision repair proteins during the repair of damaged chromatin.
