SR31747A is a sigma ligand previously described as having original 
immunosuppressive properties. Two SR31747A targets were recently identified and 
termed sigma(1) or SR-BP-1 (SR31747A-binding protein-1) and hSI (human sterol 
isomerase). In order to characterize these proteins further, we examined their 
expression and localization at the subcellular level. Based on the amino acid 
sequence deduced from the cloned hSI, anti-hSI polyclonal antibody was raised 
against the N-terminal fragment of the protein. Using this antibody, we 
performed Western-blot experiments to demonstrate the presence of hSI in various 
B and T cell lines, and hSI expression was quantified in these cell lines by 
flow cytometry and estimated at 15 000-30 000 sites per cell. Subcellular 
localization studies by both confocal and electron microscopy, performed on THP1 
cells with anti-hSI antibody and with the previously described anti-(SR-BP-1) 
monoclonal antibody, demonstrated that: (a) hSI was colocalized with SR-BP-1; 
(b) hSI and SR-BP-1 were associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and with the 
outer and inner membranes of the nuclear envelope; (c) both proteins were 
delocalized during the cell cycle at the mitosis step when the nuclear membranes 
disappeared. Taken together our results suggest that both SR31747A-binding 
proteins not only play a role in sterol metabolism but indirectly affect 
lipoprotein functions.
