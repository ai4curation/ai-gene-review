Autophagy, a cytoplasmic catabolic process, plays a critical role in defense 
against intracellular infection. In turn, evasion or inhibition of autophagy has 
emerged as an important virulence factor for intracellular pathogens. However, 
Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the obligatory intracellular bacterium that causes 
human granulocytic anaplasmosis, replicates in the membrane-bound compartment 
resembling early autophagosome. Here, we found that Anaplasma translocated 
substrate 1 (Ats-1), a type IV secretion effector, binds Beclin 1, a subunit of 
the class III PI3K and Atg14L, and it nucleates autophagosomes with markers of 
omegasomes, double FYVE-containing protein 1, Atg14L, and LC3. Ats-1 autophagy 
induction did not activate the starvation signaling pathway of mammalian target 
of rapamycin. These autophagy proteins were also localized to the Anaplasma 
inclusion. Ectopically expressed Ats-1 targeted the Anaplasma inclusions and 
enhanced infection, whereas host cytoplasmic delivery of anti-Ats-1 or Beclin 1 
depletion by siRNA suppressed the infection; beclin 1 heterozygous-deficient 
mice were resistant to Anaplasma infection. Furthermore, Anaplasma growth arrest 
by the class III PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine was alleviated by essential 
amino acid supplementation. Thus, Anaplasma actively induces autophagy by 
secreting Ats-1 that hijacks the Beclin 1-Atg14L autophagy initiation pathway 
likely to acquire host nutrients for its growth.
