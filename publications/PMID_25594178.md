The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is upregulated in numerous human

for basal and starvation-induced autophagy. LAPTM4B and Sec5 promote EGFR 
association with the autophagy inhibitor Rubicon, which in turn disassociates 
Beclin 1 from Rubicon to initiate autophagy. Thus, the oncoprotein LAPTM4B

Abstract

The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is upregulated in numerous human cancers. Inhibition of EGFR signaling induces autophagy in tumor cells. Here we report an unanticipated role for the inactive EGFR in autophagy initiation. Inactive EGFR interacts with the oncoprotein LAPTM4B that is required for the endosomal accumulation of EGFR upon serum starvation. Inactive EGFR and LAPTM4B stabilize each other at endosomes and recruit the exocyst subcomplex containing Sec5. We show that inactive EGFR, LAPTM4B, and the Sec5 subcomplex are required for basal and starvation induced autophagy. LAPTM4B and Sec5 promote EGFR association with the autophagy inhibitor Rubicon, which in turn disassociates Beclin 1 from Rubicon to initiate autophagy. Thus, the oncoprotein LAPTM4B facilitates the role of inactive EGFR in autophagy initiation. This pathway is positioned to control tumor metabolism and promote tumor cell survival upon serum deprivation or metabolic stress.

INTRODUCTION

Autophagy (macroautophagy) is a self-eating process where part of the cytoplasm, organelles and/or membrane are engulfed and eventually digested in lysosomes for cell homeostasis, development and/or nutrient recycling ( Feng et al., 2014 ). Autophagy is inducible by nutrient starvation as a mechanism to protect cells ( Klionsky et al., 2012 ). The core machinery required for autophagosome formation consists of autophagy-related (Atg) proteins that function in a specific order ( Feng et al., 2014 ). The Beclin 1 (Atg6 in yeast) complex containing Beclin 1, VPS34, ATG14 and VPS15 plays essential roles in phagophore nucleation and autophagy initiation and is emerging as a regulatory complex by autophagy signals ( He and Levine, 2010 ; Matsunaga et al., 2009 ; Sun et al., 2009 ; Zhong et al., 2009 ). LC3 (Atg8 in yeast) is an autophagy regulator downstream of Beclin 1, and a hallmark of autophagosome formation is the conversion of the cytosolic LC3-I into the lipidated LC3-II that associates with autophagosome membranes ( Kabeya et al., 2000 ). The exocyst also plays a role in the Beclin 1 complex assembly during autophagy initiation ( Bodemann et al., 2011 ), but how and where the exocyst and the autophagy complexes are regulated is not defined.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays fundamental roles in physiology and cancers ( Schlessinger, 2000 ). Aberrant EGFR signaling due to EGFR mutations and/or protein overexpression is associated with most epithelial cancers ( Mendelsohn and Baselga, 2006 ). Recent studies have shown a role for EGFR signaling in autophagy suppression by activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway or by EGFR-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of Beclin 1 ( Wei et al., 2013 ). Autophagy is generally thought to prevent cancer initiation but is also positioned to promote cancer cell survival upon metabolic stress ( Brech et al., 2009 ; White, 2012 ). Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, exhibits cytotoxic effects in cancer cells treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib or gefitinib ( Fung et al., 2012 ; Gorzalczany et al., 2011 ). However, autophagy induced by EGFR TKIs or neutralizing antibody shows cytoprotective roles ( Choi et al., 2013 ; Dragowska et al., 2013 ; Eimer et al., 2011 ; Han et al., 2011 ; Li and Fan, 2010 ; Li et al., 2010b ; Sobhakumari et al., 2013 ; Zou et al., 2013 ), suggesting that EGFR TKIs (or neutralizing antibody) may induce autophagy by a mechanism distinct from rapamycin. At least some EGFR overexpressing cells and tumors are dependent on autophagy for growth and survival ( Jutten et al., 2013 ; Jutten and Rouschop, 2014 ). A gefitinib resistant subpopulation of lung adenocarcinoma cells depend on enhanced autophagic activity but not EGFR signaling for survival ( Sakuma et al., 2013 ). The combined data suggest a kinase-independent role for EGFR in autophagy that regulates cancer cell survival.

The lysosomal-associated transmembrane protein 4B (LAPTM4B) is a tetra-transmembrane protein localized primarily to the late endosome and lysosome ( Liu et al., 2004 ). LAPTM4B was originally identified in hepatocellular carcinoma patients as an abnormally overexpressed protein and was later found to be upregulated in many other human cancers including breast, lung, ovarian, and colon cancers ( Kasper et al., 2005 ). Ectopic expression of LAPTM4B transforms normal cells and promotes proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells ( Li et al., 2011a ; Yang et al., 2010 ). LAPTM4B is proposed to promote cancer cell proliferation by upregulating PI3K/ATK signaling ( Li et al., 2010a ). We have shown that LAPTM4B blocks EGF-stimulated EGFR intraluminal sorting and lysosomal degradation, resulting in enhanced and prolonged EGFR signaling (unpublished data). A potential role for LAPTM4B in the promotion or inhibition of autophagosome maturation has been proposed ( Li et al., 2011b ; Vergarajauregui et al., 2011 ).

Here, we report an unexpected role for inactive EGFR in autophagy initiation. Upon serum starvation, inactive EGFR collaborates with LAPTM4B and Sec5 at endosomes to disassociate Rubicon from Beclin 1, which in turn initiates autophagy. EGFR TKIs also induce autophagy initiation, revealing that kinase-inactive EGFR functions in autophagy and this may be a mechanism for tumor cell resistance to EGFR TKIs.

DISCUSSION

Autophagy is activated in many cancers and facilitates cancer cell survival in stressed conditions ( Brech et al., 2009 ; White, 2012 ). EGFR plays crucial roles in many epithelial cancers, and its signaling has been linked to pro-survival, proliferative, and pro-metastatic functions of cancer cells ( Mendelsohn and Baselga, 2006 ). There are multiple links of EGFR to autophagy: (1) EGFR signaling activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that inhibits autophagy; (2) activated EGFR directly phosphorylates and inhibits Beclin 1, a key component in autophagy initiation; (3) EGFR TKIs upregulate autophagy in many cancer cells ( Jutten and Rouschop, 2014 ; Li and Fan, 2010 ; Wei et al., 2013 ). These studies all support a role for EGFR signaling in autophagy suppression.

Our data reveal a direct and unexpected role for inactive EGFR in autophagy initiation. Upon serum starvation, inactive EGFR forms a complex with LAPTM4B at endosomes where it recruits the Sec5 exocyst subcomplex. This EGFR complex binds the autophagy inhibitor Rubicon resulting in its disassociation from Beclin 1, releasing the Rubicon-free Beclin 1 complex to initiate autophagy ( Figure 7M , top). These results establish the concept that while in nutrient rich conditions activated EGFR suppresses autophagy and promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival through agonist stimulated EGFR signaling, in metabolically stressed conditions inactive EGFR alternatively facilitates cancer cell survival by activating autophagy. Consistent with our findings, kinase independent roles for EGFR in cancer cell survival have been reported ( Coker et al., 1994 ; Ewald et al., 2003 ; Weihua et al., 2008 ), and cancer cells expressing EGFR have been shown to depend on autophagy for survival and growth ( Jutten et al., 2013 ; Jutten and Rouschop, 2014 ; Sakuma et al., 2013 ).

In clinical treatments, the EGFR TKIs, erlotinib and gefitinib, are effective in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) that have activating mutations in EGFR, but show no effects in most solid tumors with WT EGFR ( Mendelsohn and Baselga, 2006 ; Paez et al., 2004 ). Recent studies have shown that treatment with EGFR TKIs increased autophagy with cytoprotective effects in many cancer cells ( Dragowska et al., 2013 ; Eimer et al., 2011 ; Gorzalczany et al., 2011 ; Han et al., 2011 ; Jutten and Rouschop, 2014 ; Li et al., 2013 ; Sakuma et al., 2013 ; Sobhakumari et al., 2013 ; Zou et al., 2013 ). EGFR TKIs activate autophagy by blocking the role for active EGFR in autophagy suppression in lung cancer cells with activating EGFR mutations ( Wei et al., 2013 ), but the mechanism by which the EGFR TKIs induce autophagy in cancer cells with WT EGFR was not defined. We show that EGFR TKIs induce a direct role for inactivated EGFR in autophagy initiation. EGFR TKIs mimic serum starvation and trigger endosomal accumulation of inactive EGFR that gains enhanced interaction with the Sec5 exocyst subcomplex and Rubicon, releasing Beclin 1 to initiate autophagy ( Figure 7M , bottom). Thus, though EGFR TKIs block the cellular functions mediated by EGFR kinase signaling, they activate a role for inactive EGFR in autophagy that could potentially provide a survival advantage and TKI resistance in WT EGFR expressing cancers. In fact, there is in vitro and in vivo evidence that co-targeting EGFR and autophagy is a promising strategy to overcome TKI resistance of cancer cells with WT EGFR, even when these cancer cells carry a different oncogenic factor like K-Ras or p53 mutation ( Choi et al., 2013 ; Dragowska et al., 2013 ; Jutten and Rouschop, 2014 ; Zou et al., 2013 ). For example, while erlotinib or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, a clinically available autophagy inhibitor) alone show no anti-tumor activity in xenografts derived from H460 NSCLC cells expressing WT EGFR but mutant K-Ras, combination of the two drugs resulted in dramatic inhibition of tumor growth ( Zou et al., 2013 ). A recent clinical trial has confirmed the safety and tolerance for co-treatment of erlotinib with HCQ ( Goldberg et al., 2012 ), and additional trials combining HCQ with erlotinib or gefitinib are ongoing for the treatment of NSCLC.

EGFR and/or LAPTM4B are overexpressed in the majority of human cancers and contribute to cancer cell survival and proliferation ( Kasper et al., 2005 ; Shao et al., 2003 ). The results presented here highlight the roles for the oncoprotein LAPTM4B in EGFR mediated cell survival functions. We have previously shown that LAPTM4B promotes active EGFR signaling by blocking EGF stimulated EGFR intraluminal sorting and lysosomal degradation (unpublished data). In the EGF stimulated condition, LAPTM4B has a weak interaction with EGFR but it inhibits the function of Hrs, a key subunit of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-0 (ESCRT-0), through enhancing the ubiquitination of Hrs by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (unpublished data). Here, we show that upon serum starvation, LAPTM4B senses EGFR inactivation at endosomes and selectively forms a complex with inactive EGFR to initiate autophagy. In both conditions, LAPTM4B facilitates the pro-survival functions of EGFR in cancer cells. The lack of a requirement for LAPTM4B in EGFR-TKIs induced autophagy is not surprising, as LAPTM4B appears to be a cofactor for EGFR driven autophagy and the effects of LAPTM4B knockdown on autophagy can be largely compensated by EGFR overexpression ( Figures S4G and S4H ). Importantly, in chemotherapies, LAPTM4B appears to increase drug resistance by multiple mechanisms ( Li et al., 2010a ; Li et al., 2010c ). Thus, although LAPTM4B is not required for the erlotinib/gefitinib-induced EGFR functions in autophagy initiation, it may enhance EGFR-TKI resistance through other pathways. This supports LAPTM4B as a therapeutic target for EGFR positive cancers or a combined target for anti-EGFR therapies.

Multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) and autophagosomes are closely related as in mammalian cells autophagosomes often fuse with endosomes to form amphisomes before the final formation of autolysosomes ( Fader and Colombo, 2009 ; Lamb et al., 2013 ). Therefore, endosomes have an established role in autophagosome maturation. Our results demonstrate that the endosome-localized inactive EGFR and LAPTM4B play pivotal roles in autophagy initiation. This emphasizes the importance of endosomes not only as canonical degradative compartments of the autophagosome content but also as signaling organelles that activate the autophagy pathway. The EGFR mediated Rubicon-Beclin 1 disassociation may occur at the endosomal surface, but the Beclin 1 complex functions in autophagosomal membrane nucleation at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ( Hamasaki et al., 2013 ; Lamb et al., 2013 ). This suggests that the phagophore initiation sites at ER are in close proximity to endosomal Beclin 1 releasing sites. In support of this, LC3 puncta were observed adjacent to EGFR positive endosomes ( Figures 1D and 4D , top panels), suggesting that autophagosomes are formed at the ER close to EGFR positive endosomes. Consistently, there are tight associations between the ER network and endosomes through ER-endosome contacts in mammalian cells ( Eden et al., 2010 ; Friedman et al., 2013 ; Helle et al., 2013 ). Although most studies have focused on the roles for ER, mitochondria and Golgi in phagophore initiation, the ER-endosome contact sites are positioned to play key roles. In this case, autophagosome maturation could be coupled, as autophagosomes would be formed close to endosomes.

In summary, this study identifies a key role for inactive EGFR in autophagy initiation in cells with WT EGFR gene in both serum starved and EGFR TKIs treated cells. It provides new insights into the mechanistic regulation of cancer cell survival by EGFR expression in metabolically stressed tumors and suggests a basis for EGFR TKI resistance in the treatments of tumors without EGFR mutations.
