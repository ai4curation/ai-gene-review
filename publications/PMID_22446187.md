Cilia are highly specialized microtubule-based organelles that have pivotal 
roles in numerous biological processes, including transducing sensory signals. 
Defects in cilia biogenesis and transport cause pleiotropic human ciliopathies. 
Mutations in over 30 different genes can lead to cilia defects, and complex 
interactions exist among ciliopathy-associated proteins. Mutations of the 
centrosomal protein 290 kDa (CEP290) lead to distinct clinical manifestations, 
including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a hereditary cause of blindness due 
to photoreceptor degeneration. Mice homozygous for a mutant Cep290 allele 
(Cep290rd16 mice) exhibit LCA-like early-onset retinal degeneration that is 
caused by an in-frame deletion in the CEP290 protein. Here, we show that the 
domain deleted in the protein encoded by the Cep290rd16 allele directly 
interacts with another ciliopathy protein, MKKS. MKKS mutations identified in 
patients with the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome disrupted this interaction. 
In zebrafish embryos, combined subminimal knockdown of mkks and cep290 produced 
sensory defects in the eye and inner ear. Intriguingly, combinations of 
Cep290rd16 and Mkksko alleles in mice led to improved ciliogenesis and sensory 
functions compared with those of either mutant alone. We propose that altered 
association of CEP290 and MKKS affects the integrity of multiprotein complexes 
at the cilia transition zone and basal body. Amelioration of the sensory 
phenotypes caused by specific mutations in one protein by removal of an 
interacting domain/protein suggests a possible novel approach for treating human 
ciliopathies.
