Protein N(alpha)-terminal acetylation is one of the most common protein 
modifications in eukaryotic cells. In yeast, three major complexes, NatA, NatB, 
and NatC, catalyze nearly all N-terminal acetylation, acetylating specific 
subsets of protein N termini. In human cells, only the NatA and NatB complexes 
have been described. We here identify and characterize the human NatC (hNatC) 
complex, containing the catalytic subunit hMak3 and the auxiliary subunits 
hMak10 and hMak31. This complex associates with ribosomes, and hMak3 acetylates 
Met-Leu protein N termini in vitro, suggesting a model in which the human NatC 
complex functions in cotranslational N-terminal acetylation. Small interfering 
RNA-mediated knockdown of NatC subunits results in p53-dependent cell death and 
reduced growth of human cell lines. As a consequence of hMAK3 knockdown, p53 is 
stabilized and phosphorylated and there is a significant transcriptional 
activation of proapoptotic genes downstream of p53. Knockdown of hMAK3 alters 
the subcellular localization of the Arf-like GTPase hArl8b, supporting that 
hArl8b is a hMak3 substrate in vivo. Taken together, hNatC-mediated N-terminal 
acetylation is important for maintenance of protein function and cell viability 
in human cells.
