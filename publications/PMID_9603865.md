The localization of FtsI (PBP3), a penicillin-binding protein specifically 
required for cell division in Escherichia coli, was investigated by 
immunofluorescence microscopy and found to localize to the septum. The 
localization of FtsI was not observed in ftsZ or ftsA mutants, indicating that 
it was dependent on the prior localization of these proteins. Addition of 
furazlocillin, a specific inhibitor of FtsI, prevented localization of FtsI even 
though FtsZ and FtsA localization occurred. Interestingly, the localization of 
FtsN was also prevented by furazlocillin. FtsZ displayed limited localization in 
furazlocillin-treated cells, whereas it was efficiently localized in 
FtsI-depleted cells. FtsW, another essential cell division protein, was also 
localized to the septum.
