F-box only protein 8 (FBX8), as a critical component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box 
(SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligases, has been associated with several malignancies 
through interacting with a member of proteins. However, the substrates of FBX8 
for destruction in the progression of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) need to be 
explored. Here, we show that loss of FBX8 accelerates chemical-induced colon 
tumorigenesis. FBX8 directly targets GSTP1 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasome 
degradation in CRC. GSTP1 promotes the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis 
of CRC cells. Furthermore, GSTP1 is upregulated in CRC tissue samples and 
predicts poor prognosis of CRC patients. The inactivation of FBX8 negatively 
correlated with increased levels and stability of GSTP1 in clinical CRC tissues 
and FBX8 knockout transgenic mice. These findings identify a novel 
ubiquitination pathway as FBX8-GSTP1 axis that regulates the progression of CRC, 
which might be a potential prognostic biomarker for CRC patients.
