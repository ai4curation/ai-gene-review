The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) initiates signals by interacting with 
cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) through a 17-residue sequence motif 
[called the antigen recognition activation motif (ARAM)] that is contained in 
the TCR zeta and CD3 chains. TCR stimulation induces the tyrosine 
phosphorylation of several cellular substrates, including the ARAMs. Lck kinase 
activity is required for phosphorylation of two conserved tyrosine residues in 
an ARAM. This phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of a second cytoplasmic 
PTK, ZAP-70, through both of the ZAP-70 Src homology 2 domains and its 
phosphorylation. Thus, TCR signal transduction is initiated by the sequential 
interaction of two PTKs with TCR ARAMs.
