RATIONALE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), in particular miR-29b and miR-30c, have been 
implicated as important regulators of cardiac fibrosis.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a proteomics comparison of miRNA effects on extracellular 
matrix secretion by cardiac fibroblasts.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mouse cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with 
pre-/anti-miR of miR-29b and miR-30c, and their conditioned medium was analyzed 
by mass spectrometry. miR-29b targeted a cadre of proteins involved in fibrosis, 
including multiple collagens, matrix metalloproteinases, and leukemia inhibitory 
factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and pentraxin 3, 3 predicted targets of 
miR-29b. miR-29b also attenuated the cardiac fibroblast response to transforming 
growth factor-β. In contrast, miR-30c had little effect on extracellular matrix 
production but opposite effects regarding leukemia inhibitory factor and 
insulin-like growth factor 1. Both miRNAs indirectly affected cardiac myocytes. 
On transfection with pre-miR-29b, the conditioned medium of cardiac fibroblasts 
lost its ability to support adhesion of rat ventricular myocytes and led to a 
significant reduction of cardiac myocyte proteins (α-actinin, cardiac 
myosin-binding protein C, and cardiac troponin I). Similarly, cardiomyocytes 
derived from mouse embryonic stem cells atrophied under pre-miR-29 conditioned 
medium, whereas pre-miR-30c conditioned medium had a prohypertrophic effect. 
Levels of miR-29a, miR-29c, and miR-30c, but not miR-29b, were significantly 
reduced in a mouse model of pathological but not physiological hypertrophy. 
Treatment with antagomiRs to miR-29b induced excess fibrosis after aortic 
constriction without overt deterioration in cardiac function.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proteomic analysis revealed novel molecular targets of miRNAs 
that are linked to a fibrogenic cardiac phenotype. Such comprehensive screening 
methods are essential to define the concerted actions of miRNAs in 
cardiovascular disease.
