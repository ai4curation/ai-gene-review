Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters serve as cofactors in many proteins that have 
important redox, catalytic, and regulatory functions. In bacteria, biogenesis of 
Fe-S clusters is mediated by multiple gene products encoded by the isc and nif 
operons. In particular, genetic and biochemical studies suggest that IscU, Nfu, 
and IscA function as scaffold proteins for assembly and delivery of rudimentary 
Fe-S clusters to target proteins. Here we report the characterization of human 
Nfu. A combination of biochemical and spectroscopic techniques, including 
UV-visible absorption and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopies, have been used to 
investigate the ability of purified human Nfu to assemble Fe-S clusters. The 
results suggest that Nfu can assemble approximately one labile [4Fe-4S] cluster 
per two Nfu monomers, and support the proposal that Nfu is an alternative 
scaffold protein for assembly of clusters that are subsequently used for 
maturation of targeted Fe-S proteins. Analyses of genomic DNA, transcripts, and 
translation products indicate that alternative splicing of a common pre-mRNA 
results in synthesis of two Nfu isoforms with distinct subcellular 
localizations. Isoform I is localized in the mitochondria, whereas isoform II is 
present in the cytosol and the nucleus. These results, together with previous 
reports of subcellular distributions of isoforms of human IscS and IscU in 
mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus suggest that the Fe-S cluster assembly 
machineries are compartmentalized in higher eukaryotes.
