Guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins activate ADP-ribosylation factors by 
accelerating the replacement of bound GDP with GTP. Mammalian brefeldin 
A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins, BIG1 and BIG2, are important 
activators of ADP-ribosylation factors for vesicular trafficking. To identify 
proteins that interact with BIG2, we used cDNA constructs encoding BIG2 
sequences in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart library. Clone p2-5-3, 
encoding a form of human exocyst protein Exo70, interacted with BIG2 amino acids 
1-643 and 1-832, but not 644-832, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation 
of in vitro-translated BIG2 N-terminal segments and 2-5-3. By immunofluorescence 
microscopy, endogenous BIG2 and Exo70 in HepG2 cells were visualized at Golgi 
membranes and apparently at the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Both were 
identified in purified centrosomes. Immunoreactive Exo70 and BIG2 partially or 
completely overlapped with gamma-tubulin at the MTOC in cells inspected by 
confocal microscopy. In cells incubated with brefeldin A, most of the BIG2, 
Exo70, and trans-Golgi protein p230 were widely dispersed from their perinuclear 
concentrations, but small amounts always remained, apparently at the MTOC. After 
disruption of microtubules with nocodazole, BIG2 and Exo70 were widely 
distributed in cells and remained only partially colocalized with p230, BIG2 
more so than Exo70. We conclude that in HepG2 cells BIG2 and Exo70 interact in 
trans-Golgi network and centrosomes, as well as in exocyst structures or 
complexes that move along microtubules to the plasma membrane, consistent with a 
functional association in both early and late stages of vesicular trafficking.
