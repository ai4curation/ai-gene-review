Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) assembles nucleosomes in a 
replication-dependent manner. The small subunit of CAF-1 (p48) is a member of a 
highly conserved subfamily of WD-repeat proteins. There are at least two members 
of this subfamily in both human (p46 and p48) and yeast cells (Hat2p, a subunit 
of the B-type H4 acetyltransferase, and Msi1p). Human p48 can bind to histone H4 
in the absence of CAF-1 p150 and p60. p48, also a known subunit of a histone 
deacetylase, copurifies with a chromatin assembly complex (CAC), which contains 
the three subunits of CAF-1 (p150, p60, p48) and H3 and H4, and promotes DNA 
replication-dependent chromatin assembly. CAC histone H4 exhibits a novel 
pattern of lysine acetylation that overlaps with, but is distinct from, that 
reported for newly synthesized H4 isolated from nascent chromatin. Our data 
suggest that CAC is a key intermediate of the de novo nucleosome assembly 
pathway and that the p48 subunit participates in other aspects of histone 
metabolism.
