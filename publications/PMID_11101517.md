Abstract

Lhs1p is an Hsp70-related chaperone localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Δlhs1 mutant cells are viable but are constitutively induced for the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here, we demonstrate a severe growth defect in Δire1Δlhs1 double mutant cells in which the UPR can no longer be induced. In addition, we have identified a UPR- regulated gene, SIL1 , whose overexpression is sufficient to suppress the Δire1Δlhs1 growth defect. SIL1 encodes an ER-localized protein that interacts directly with the ATPase domain of Kar2p (BiP), suggesting some role in modulating the activity of this vital chaperone. SIL1 is a non-essential gene but the Δlhs1Δsil1 double mutation is lethal and correlates with a complete block of protein translocation into the ER. We conclude that the IRE1 -dependent induction of SIL1 is a vital adaptation in Δlhs1 cells, and that the activities associated with the Lhs1 and Sil1 proteins constitute an essential function required for protein translocation into the ER. The Sil1 protein appears widespread amongst eukaryotes, with homologues in Yarrowia lipolytica (Sls1p), Drosophila and mammals.

Introduction

Protein translocation across the membrane of the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can occur by two distinct pathways. The co-translational pathway targets nascent polypeptides to the ER membrane via signal recognition particle (SRP), whereas the post-translational pathway translocates full-length precursor polypeptides that are targeted to the ER independently of SRP (for a review see Stirling, 1999 ). Recent evidence suggests a specific role for BiP, an ER lumenal Hsp70, in gating the translocon prior to the initiation of co-translational translocation ( Hamman et al., 1998 ). Such an activity might be expected to be crucial in living cells, and indeed Kar2p (yeast BiP; Normington et al., 1989 ; Rose et al., 1989 ) has recently been shown to be essential for the translocation of SRP-dependent precursors in vivo (B.P.Young, R.A.Craven, P.J.Reid and C.J.Stirling, submitted). Kar2p is also essential for the post-translational translocation pathway in yeast where it is required at two distinct stages: (i) for initiation of translocation prior to the stable interaction of precursor with the translocon and (ii) to promote the vectorial transport of polypeptide chains through the translocon into the ER lumen ( Sanders et al., 1992 ; Lyman and Schekman, 1995 , 1997 ). This latter role involves the Hsp70 ATP-dependent reaction cycle, which drives multiple rounds of Kar2p binding to the translocating polypeptide as it enters the lumen. Such binding of the incoming precursor by a lumenal factor prevents ‘backslip’ and is sufficient to drive import ( Matlack et al., 1999 ).

A second ER-resident Hsp70-related protein, encoded by the LHS1 gene, has been characterized in yeast ( Baxter et al., 1996 ; Craven et al., 1996 ; Hamilton and Flynn, 1996 ). The Lhs1 protein (Lhs1p) represents a novel branch of the Hsp70 superfamily ( Craven et al., 1997 ) and appears ubiquitous amongst eukaryotes, with homologues including mammalian Grp170/Orp150 ( Chen et al., 1996 ; Kuwabara et al., 1996 ; Craven et al., 1997 ). Unlike KAR2 , the LHS1 gene is not essential for viability, but lhs1 null mutant cells display a partial defect in post-translational translocation ( Baxter et al., 1996 ; Craven et al., 1996 ; Hamilton and Flynn, 1996 ) and are also defective in the repair of misfolded proteins in the ER ( Saris et al., 1997 ). However, the interpretation of the Δlhs1 mutant phenotype is complicated by the fact that these cells exhibit a constitutive induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) ( Baxter et al., 1996 ; Craven et al., 1996 ). The UPR is triggered by a reduction in the levels of free Kar2p/BiP, presumably resulting from its sequestration onto misfolded polypeptides ( Kohno et al., 1993 ; Bertolotti et al., 2000 ). In yeast, this leads to activation of the transmembrane kinase/nuclease Ire1p ( Cox et al., 1993 ; Mori et al., 1993 ; Shamu and Walter, 1996 ) which initiates a novel splicing mechanism that removes an intron from the HAC1 mRNA ( Cox and Walter, 1996 ; Mori et al., 1996 ; Sidrauski et al., 1996 ; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997 ). Translation of the spliced mRNA produces a functional Hac1p transcription factor which then mediates the transcriptional induction of at least 381 genes in the yeast genome ( Travers et al., 2000 ). Many of these induced genes are known to encode ER-resident chaperones, hence this response is presumed to maximize the cell’s capacity to process misfolded molecules and thus to tolerate a variety of stresses affecting folding pathways ( Cox et al., 1993 ; Mori et al., 1993 ). Interestingly, the LHS1 gene is itself UPR regulated, suggesting that Lhs1p plays a role in the normal cellular response to folding stress ( Baxter et al., 1996 ; Craven et al., 1996 ). However, the fact that the UPR is induced in Δlhs1 cells also raises the possibility that one or more UPR-regulated chaperones might be required to compensate for the loss of Lhs1p. Here we report that a functional UPR is required for the near normal growth rate observed in Δlhs1 cells when compared with the parental strain. Moreover, we have identified a single UPR-regulated gene, which we have named SIL1 , that is essential for survival of Δlhs1 cells and whose overexpression is sufficient to suppress the phenotypes associated with the lhs1 deletion. Furthermore, we show that the lethal Δsil1Δlhs1 double mutation results in a complete defect in protein translocation into the ER.

Discussion

Previous characterization of the yeast Δlhs1 null mutant revealed a modest growth phenotype but also identified a substantial induction of UPR-regulated genes. Genetic studies revealed that Δire1Δlhs1 double mutant spores were non-viable, leading us to propose that the Ire1p-dependent UPR represents an important physiological adaptation in Δlhs1 mutant cells ( Craven et al., 1996 , 1997 ). This hypothesis is confirmed in this study where we have shown a severe synthetic growth defect in vegetative cells in which the Δlhs1 and Δire1 mutations are combined. Given that Lhs1p and Kar2p are related, we have suggested previously ( Craven et al., 1996 ) that the UPR induction of Kar2p might be required to compensate for the absence of Lhs1p. However, our findings indicate that multicopy KAR2 had no effect upon the growth of the Δire1Δlhs1 double mutant. Interestingly, multicopy KAR2 has been shown to rescue the growth defect associated with accumulation of a misfolded protein in Δire1 cells ( Umebayashi et al., 1999 ). It therefore follows that the growth defect in Δire1Δlhs1 cells is unlikely to be due solely to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Similarly, overexpression of Kar2p does not rescue the translocation phenotype of a Δlhs1 mutant, from which we conclude that this phenotype is not an indirect consequence of sequestration of Kar2p onto unfolded polypeptides.

We next attempted to isolate multicopy plasmid suppressors of the Δire1Δlhs1 double mutant growth defect. As expected, we isolated complementing clones of both LHS1 and IRE1 , but were struck by the isolation of a clone capable of expressing only the C-terminal portion of Ire1p (Ire1Cp). This clone led to a constitutive induction of the UPR and was of interest as it provides novel insights into the function of Ire1p. Current evidence suggests that the N-terminal ‘dimerization’ domain of Ire1p interacts with Kar2p/BiP in the ER lumen and, upon sequestration of Kar2p/BiP, promotes oligomerization of Ire1p and subsequent activation by phosphorylation ( Shamu and Walter, 1996 ; Welihinda and Kaufman, 1996 ; Bertolotti et al., 2000 ). Given that this induction can occur in cells expressing only the C-terminal kinase/nuclease domain, then we must conclude that the dimerization domain of Ire1p is not essential for Ire1p activation. We therefore propose that the lumenal domain functions primarily as a Kar2p-dependent inhibitor of oligomerization/activation of Ire1p.

In addition to complementing clones of LHS1 and IRE1 , our screen identified one bona fide suppressor named SIL1 . The SIL1 gene corresponds to a reading frame of unknown function, YOL031c , identified in the yeast genome sequence. The SIL1/YOL031c gene has also been characterized recently as PER100 , one of 381 UPR-inducible genes in the yeast transcriptome ( Travers et al., 2000 ). The finding that SIL1 is UPR regulated would allow the IRE1 -dependent induction of Sil1p in Δlhs1 cells. Such induction of Sil1p would be sufficient to explain the observed requirement for Ire1p in Δlhs1 cells. An absolute requirement for Sil1p in Δlhs1 cells is demonstrated by the synthetically lethal interaction observed between the Δsil1 and Δlhs1 mutations. We therefore conclude that the IRE1 -dependent induction of SIL1 is a critical adaptation in Δlhs1 cells.

The SIL1/YOL031c gene encodes a polypeptide previously noted to be 27.5% identical (52% similar) to the Sls1 protein (Sls1p) from Y.lipolytica ( Boisrame et al., 1996 ). The SLS1 gene was identified by virtue of a mutation that is lethal in combination with a defect in the Y.lipolytica SRP, suggesting some role for Sls1p in protein translocation in this system ( Boisrame et al., 1996 ). However, like the Δsil1 mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the Y.lipolytica Δsls1 mutant is viable and does not accumulate any untranslocated precursor forms of secretory proteins. Nonetheless, the Δsls1 mutant is defective in the rate of synthesis of at least one secretory protein from which a translocation defect has been inferred ( Boisrame et al., 1998 ). Some role in translocation is supported further by the finding that Sls1p can be co-immunoprecipitated with Sec61p ( Boisrame et al., 1996 ), the core component of the translocon complex responsible for protein translocation across the ER membrane ( Stirling et al., 1992 ; Broughton et al., 1997 ). Moreover, Sls1p has been shown to interact with the ATP-binding domain of Kar2p, leading to the proposal that Sls1p might function as a co-chaperone responsible for modulating the activity of Kar2p during its ATP-dependent reaction cycle ( Boisrame et al., 1998 ; Kabani et al., 2000 ).

The translocation defects previously reported in Δlhs1 cells would be consistent with a defect that is exclusive to the post-translational SRP-independent protein translocation pathway ( Baxter et al., 1996 ; Craven et al., 1996 ; Hamilton and Flynn, 1996 ). However, the lethal depletion of the truncated form of Lhs1p in Δsil1Δlhs1 cells correlates with a severe translocation phenotype for all precursors. This might be due to a gross perturbation of the structural integrity of the ER that might simply eliminate all ER functions. However, we observed substantial ER glycosylation of newly synthesized DPAPB in cells where translocation of prepro-CPY is blocked (Figure 6 , lanes 2 and 3). From this, it is evident that the defect in CPY translocation must precede any gross loss of ER function. Our data are therefore entirely consistent with a direct role for Lhs1p in the post-translational translocation reaction. We cannot, at this time, exclude the possibility that a secondary consequence of this defect may then lead to the observed defect in co-translational translocation. Alternatively, the delayed onset of the co-translational translocation defect may reflect a direct requirement for Lhs1p/Sil1p that is satisfied by lower levels of Lhs1p trun than are needed in the post-translational reaction. Circumstantial evidence in support of such a direct role includes the fact that the Y.lipolytica SLS1 gene was identified via its genetic interactions with SRP ( Boisrame et al., 1996 ), and also that the mammalian homologue of Lhs1p, GRP170, is a major component of an ATP-binding fraction of ER lumenal proteins required for co-translational translocation into microsomes in vitro ( Dierks et al., 1996 ).

The translocation defect observed in Δsil1Δlhs1 double mutant cells clearly demonstrates that Kar2p is not sufficient to drive ER translocation in vivo . We therefore conclude that Sil1p/Lhs1p provide a novel lumenal function(s) that is essential for the translocation process. Clearly, this function might affect either translocon gating, vectorial transport into the lumen, termination of translocation or the recycling of components of the translocon. Current evidence indicates that Kar2p/BiP is sufficient to gate the translocon during initiation of translocation ( Hamman et al., 1998 ). However, the Lhs1 protein (Lhs1p) has been shown to bind to peptides in an ATP-dependent manner similar to that demonstrated for BiP ( Hamilton et al., 1999 ). We therefore propose that Lhs1p binds to translocating polypeptides, thus contributing to the driving force for post-translational translocation in a manner similar to that previously suggested for Kar2p. There is no evidence for Sil1p interacting directly with precursors, but, given the observed interactions between Sil1p and Kar2p, we propose that a complex of Sil1p– Kar2p acts in concert with Lhs1p to drive the import reaction. Lhs1p is sufficient for this activity since the Δsil1 mutant has no translocation defect. Indeed, the fact that Δlhs1 cells exhibit a significant translocation defect, despite UPR induction of Sil1p, suggests that Lhs1p plays a major role in protein translocation in yeast. In the absence of Lhs1p, we propose that the Ire1-dependent induction of Sil1p is required to activate/potentiate Kar2p in order to enhance its contribution to the import reaction. The finding that Sil1p interacts directly with the ATPase domain of Kar2p suggests a direct mechanism by which Sil1p could modulate Kar2p activity. The proposed role of Kar2p in translocon gating would be independent of Sil1p, since the latter is non-essential, and since translocation is not blocked in a Δsil1 mutant. Our model makes a number of experimentally verifiable predictions that currently are under investigation. Finally, the identification of homologues of Sil1p in a variety of eukaryotes suggests that this newly defined role for Sil1p may in fact be widespread.
