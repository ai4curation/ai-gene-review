TFAR19, a novel apoptosis-related gene cloned from human leukemia cell line 
TF-1, could enhance apoptosis of some tumor cells induced by growth factor 
withdrawal.

Using the cDNA-representative differences analysis (cDNA-RDA) approach, we 
identified a novel gene, TFAR19 (TF-1 cell apoptosis related gene-19), from TF-1 
cells undergoing apoptosis. The human TFAR19 encodes a protein which shares 
significant homology to the corresponding proteins of species ranging from yeast 
to mice. TFAR19 exhibits a ubiquitous expression pattern and its expression is 
upregulated in the tumor cells undergoing apoptosis. Overexpression of TFAR19 in 
tumor cells enhances apoptosis triggered by growth factor or serum deprivation. 
We propose that TFAR19 may play a general role in the apoptotic process.
