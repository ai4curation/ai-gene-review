Telomerase uses a short stretch of its intrinsic RNA molecule as template for 
telomere repeat synthesis. Reverse transcription of the RNA template is 
catalyzed by the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein subunit. We 
demonstrate that human telomerase reconstituted from recombinant TERT and 
telomerase RNA runs as a dimer on a gel filtration column and that it contains 
two telomerase RNA molecules. Significantly, a telomerase heterodimer 
reconstituted from wild-type and mutant telomerase RNA is barely active when 
compared with the wild-type homodimer. We conclude that the telomerase RNA 
templates in the active enzyme are interdependent and functionally cooperate 
with each other. We discuss models that may explain the biological and enzymatic 
roles of telomerase dimerization.
