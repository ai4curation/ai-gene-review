Centriole duplication involves the growth of a procentriole next to the parental 
centriole. Mutations in STIL and CPAP/CENPJ cause primary microcephaly (MCPH). 
Here, we show that human STIL has an asymmetric localization to the daughter 
centriole and is required for procentriole formation. STIL levels oscillate 
during the cell cycle. Interestingly, STIL interacts directly with CPAP and 
forms a complex with hSAS6. A natural mutation of CPAP (E1235V) that causes MCPH 
in humans leads to significantly lower binding to STIL. Overexpression of STIL 
induced the formation of multiple procentrioles around the parental centriole. 
STIL depletion inhibited normal centriole duplication, Plk4-induced centriole 
amplification, and CPAP-induced centriole elongation, and resulted in a failure 
to localize hSAS6 and CPAP to the base of the nascent procentriole. Furthermore, 
hSAS6 depletion hindered STIL targeting to the procentriole, implying that STIL 
and hSAS6 are mutually dependent for their centriolar localization. Together, 
our results indicate that the two MCPH-associated proteins STIL and CPAP 
interact with each other and are required for procentriole formation, implying a 
central role of centriole biogenesis in MCPH.
