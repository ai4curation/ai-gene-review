The bcl-2 oncogene is activated as a consequence of the t(14;18) chromosomal 
translocation in human follicular lymphomas. Bcl-2 functions to inhibit 
apoptosis in a variety of in vitro and in vivo experiments, suggesting 
interference with a central mechanism of apoptosis. The bcl-2 protein is 
associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, however, the biochemical 
function of bcl-2 is unknown. Transgenic mice which overexpress bcl-2 provide 
evidence for bcl-2's role in memory B cells and thymic education as an 
intracellular survival factor. Additional regulators of apoptosis, such as the 
p53 tumor suppressor gene, may be altered in human cancers as one step in 
tumorigenesis.
