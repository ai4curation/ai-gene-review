Cellular homeostasis is coordinated through communication between mitochondria 
and the nucleus, organelles that each possess their own genomes. Whereas the 
mitochondrial genome is regulated by factors encoded in the nucleus, the nuclear 
genome is currently not known to be actively controlled by factors encoded in 
the mitochondrial DNA. Here, we show that MOTS-c, a peptide encoded in the 
mitochondrial genome, translocates to the nucleus and regulates nuclear gene 
expression following metabolic stress in a 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. In the nucleus, MOTS-c regulated a broad 
range of genes in response to glucose restriction, including those with 
antioxidant response elements (ARE), and interacted with ARE-regulating 
stress-responsive transcription factors, such as nuclear factor erythroid 
2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2). Our findings indicate that the mitochondrial 
and nuclear genomes co-evolved to independently encode for factors to 
cross-regulate each other, suggesting that mitonuclear communication is 
genetically integrated.
