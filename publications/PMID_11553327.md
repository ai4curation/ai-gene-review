Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) strikes 1 in 1000 
individuals and often results in end-stage renal failure. Mutations in either 
PKD1 or PKD2 account for 95% of all cases [1-3]. It has recently been 
demonstrated that polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 (encoded by PKD1 and PKD2, 
respectively) assemble to form a cation channel in vitro [4]. Here we determine 
that the Caenorhabditis elegans PKD1 and PKD2 homologs, lov-1 [5] and pkd-2, act 
in the same pathway in vivo. Mutations in either lov-1 or pkd-2 result in 
identical male sensory behavioral defects. Also, pkd-2;lov-1 double mutants are 
no more severe than either of the single mutants, indicating that lov-1 and 
pkd-2 act together. LOV-1::GFP and PKD-2::GFP are expressed in the same 
male-specific sensory neurons and are concentrated in cilia and cell bodies. 
Cytoplasmic, nonnuclear staining in cell bodies is punctate, suggesting that one 
pool of PKD-2 is localized to intracellular membranes while another is found in 
sensory cilia. In contrast to defects in the C. elegans autosomal recessive PKD 
gene osm-5 [6-8], the cilia of lov-1 and pkd-2 single mutants and of lov-1;pkd-2 
double mutants are normal as judged by electron microscopy, demonstrating that 
lov-1 and pkd-2 are not required for ultrastructural development of 
male-specific sensory cilia.
