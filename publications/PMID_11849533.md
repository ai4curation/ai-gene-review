The Rok (YkuW) protein acts as a negative regulator of comK, which encodes the 
competence transcription factor of Bacillus subtilis. In the absence of Rok, 
ComK is overproduced, and when excess Rok is present comK transcription is 
inhibited. Rok acts transcriptionally to repress comK expression but does not 
affect ComK stability, which is controlled by the MecA switch. Gel-shift assays 
show that Rok binds directly to a DNA fragment that contains the comK promoter. 
SinR and AbrB act negatively on rok transcription, and the inactivation of rok 
bypasses the positive requirements for sinR and abrB for the expression of comK. 
Therefore, the dependence of comK expression on SinR and AbrB may be a result of 
their repression of rok transcription. It has also been shown in vivo that Rok 
and ComK can indivi-dually repress rok transcription, and that Rok and ComK bind 
to the rok promoter in vitro. These interactions establish feedback loops, and 
the roles of these circuits are discussed.
