NEK protein kinases are evolutionarily conserved kinases structurally related to 
the Aspergillus nidulans mitotic regulator NIMA. At least nine members of the 
NEK family in vertebrates have been described to date, but for most of them the 
interacting protein partners are unknown. The pleiotropic deleterious effects 
and the formation of kidney cysts caused by NEK1 mutation in mice emphasize its 
involvement in the regulation of diverse cellular processes and in the etiology 
of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), respectively. Here we report the 
identification of proteins that interacted with the human NEK1 protein kinase in 
a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library, using the 
catalytic and regulatory domains of NEK1 separately as baits. These proteins are 
known to take part either in the development of PKD, in the double-strand DNA 
break repair at the G2/M transition phase of the cell cycle, or in neural cell 
development. The proteins involved in PKD include the motor protein KIF3A and 
the proteins tuberin and alpha-catulin. Mapping studies of the human NEK1 
regulatory domain (NRD) indicated a strong interaction of most of the proteins 
retrieved from the library with putative coiled coils located in the central 
region of NRD. Our results give further support to the previous observation that 
NEK1 is of functional importance for the etiology of PKD.
