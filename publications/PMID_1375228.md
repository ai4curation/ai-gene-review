The APO-1 antigen as defined by the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-APO-1 was 
previously found to be expressed on the cell surface of activated human T and B 
lymphocytes and a variety of malignant human lymphoid cell lines. Cross-linking 
of the APO-1 antigen by anti-APO-1 induced programmed cell death, apoptosis, of 
APO-1 positive cells. To characterize the APO-1 cell surface molecule and to 
better understand its role in induction of apoptosis, the APO-1 protein was 
purified to homogeneity from membranes of SKW6.4 B lymphoblastoid cells by 
solubilization with sodium deoxycholate, affinity chromatography with anti-APO-1 
antibody, and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Each 
purification step was followed by an APO-1-specific solid phase enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay using the monoclonal antibody anti-APO-1. In sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the APO-1 antigen was found to be a 
membrane glycoprotein of 48-kDa. Endoproteinase-cleaved peptides of the APO-1 
protein were subjected to amino acid sequencing, and corresponding 
oligonucleotides were used to identify a full-length APO-1 cDNA clone from an 
SKW6.4 cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of APO-1 showed sequence 
identity with the Fas antigen, a cysteine-rich transmembrane protein of 335 
amino acids with significant similarity to the members of the tumor necrosis 
factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily. The APO-1 antigen was expressed 
upon transfection of APO-1 cDNA into BL60-P7 Burkitt's lymphoma cells and 
conferred sensitivity towards anti-APO-1-induced apoptosis to the transfectants.
