DNA damage-activated signaling pathways are critical for coordinating multiple 
cellular processes, which must be tightly regulated to maintain genome 
stability. To provide a comprehensive and unbiased perspective of DNA damage 
response (DDR) signaling pathways, we performed 30 fluorescence-activated cell 
sorting (FACS)-based genome-wide CRISPR screens in human cell lines with 
antibodies recognizing distinct endogenous DNA damage signaling proteins to 
identify critical regulators involved in DDR. We discovered that 
proteasome-mediated processing is an early and prerequisite event for cells to 
trigger camptothecin- and etoposide-induced DDR signaling. Furthermore, we 
identified PRMT1 and PRMT5 as modulators that regulate ATM protein level. 
Moreover, we discovered that GNB1L is a key regulator of DDR signaling via its 
role as a co-chaperone specifically regulating PIKK proteins. Collectively, 
these screens offer a rich resource for further investigation of DDR, which may 
provide insight into strategies of targeting these DDR pathways to improve 
therapeutic outcomes.
