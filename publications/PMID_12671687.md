Cbl functions as an adaptor protein by interacting with other signalling 
molecules to form multimolecular complexes. Previous studies have proposed that 
Cbl is also a positive regulator of CrkL-C3G signalling, which leads to Rap1 
activation. However, there is a lack of genetic evidence for a physiological 
function of Cbl in regulating this pathway. Here, we show that Cbl deficiency 
results in enhanced activation of Rap1. Cbl was shown to promote the 
ubiquitylation of CrkL without any apparent effect on its stability. Remarkably, 
the membrane translocation of C3G, its association with CrkL, and the 
guanine-nucleotide exchange activity of C3G were all increased in Cbl(-/-) 
thymocytes. Consistent with a function of Rap1 in integrin activation, enhanced 
integrin-mediated cell adhesion was also seen in Cbl(-/-) thymocytes. Thus, Cbl 
negatively regulates Rap1 activation, probably through a proteolysis-independent 
E3-ubiquitin-ligase activity of Cbl that modulates protein-protein interactions.
