The developmental, regulatory gene Pax-2 is activated during early kidney 
morphogenesis and repressed in mature renal epithelium. Persistent Pax-2 
expression is also observed in a variety of kidney tumors. Yet, little is known 
about the signals regulating this transient expression pattern in the developing 
kidney. We have examined the spatial and temporal expression patterns of Pax-2 
and the Wilm's tumor suppresser protein WT1 with specific antibodies in 
developing mouse kidneys. A marked increase in WT1 protein levels coincided 
precisely with down-regulation of the Pax-2 gene in the individual precursor 
cells of the visceral glomerular epithelium, suggesting a direct effect of the 
WT1 repressor protein on Pax-2 regulatory elements. To examine whether WT1 could 
directly repress Pax-2 transcription, binding of WT1 to three high affinity 
sites in the 5' untranslated Pax-2 leader sequence was demonstrated by DNAseI 
footprinting analysis. Furthermore, co-transfection assays using CAT reporter 
constructs under the control of Pax-2 regulatory sequences demonstrated 
WT1-dependent transcriptional repression. These three WT1 binding sites were 
also able to repress transcription, in a WT1-dependent manner, when inserted 
between a heterologous promoter and the reporter gene. The data indicate that 
Pax-2 is a likely target gene for WT1 and suggest a direct link, at the level of 
transcriptional regulation, between a developmental control gene, active in 
undifferentiated and proliferating cells, and a known tumor suppressor gene.
