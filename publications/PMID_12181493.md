Overexpression of the TCL1 oncogene has been shown to play a causative role in T 
cell leukemias of humans and mice. The characterization of Tcl1-deficient mice 
in these studies indicates an important developmental role for Tcl1 in early 
embryogenesis. In wild-type embryos, Tcl1 is abundant in the first three mitotic 
cycles, during which it shuttles between nuclei and the embryo cortical regions 
in a cell-cycle-dependent fashion. The absence of this protein in early 
embryogenesis results in reduced fertility of female mice. The present studies 
elucidate the mechanism responsible for the reduced female fertility through 
analysis of the oogenesis stages and early embryo development in Tcl1-deficient 
mice. Even though Tcl1(-/-) females display normal oogenesis and rates of oocyte 
maturation/ovulation and fertilization, the lack of maternally derived Tcl1 
impairs the embryo's ability to undergo normal cleavage and develop to the 
morula stage, especially under in vitro culture conditions. Beyond this crisis 
point, differentiative traits of zygotic genome activation and embryo compaction 
can take place normally. In contrast with this unanticipated role in early 
embryogenesis, we observed an overexpression of TCL1 in human seminomas. This 
finding suggests that TCL1 dysregulation could contribute to the development of 
this germinal cell cancer as well as lymphoid malignancies.

Abstract

Overexpression of the TCL1 oncogene has been shown to play a causative role in T cell leukemias of humans and mice. The characterization of Tcl1 -deficient mice in these studies indicates an important developmental role for Tcl1 in early embryogenesis. In wild-type embryos, Tcl1 is abundant in the first three mitotic cycles, during which it shuttles between nuclei and the embryo cortical regions in a cell-cycle-dependent fashion. The absence of this protein in early embryogenesis results in reduced fertility of female mice. The present studies elucidate the mechanism responsible for the reduced female fertility through analysis of the oogenesis stages and early embryo development in Tcl1 -deficient mice. Even though Tcl1 −/− females display normal oogenesis and rates of oocyte maturation/ovulation and fertilization, the lack of maternally derived Tcl1 impairs the embryo's ability to undergo normal cleavage and develop to the morula stage, especially under in vitro culture conditions. Beyond this crisis point, differentiative traits of zygotic genome activation and embryo compaction can take place normally. In contrast with this unanticipated role in early embryogenesis, we observed an overexpression of TCL1 in human seminomas. This finding suggests that TCL1 dysregulation could contribute to the development of this germinal cell cancer as well as lymphoid malignancies.

Discussion

The present observation of impaired fertility in Tcl1 -deficient females prompted the analysis of Tcl1 intracellular distribution and function in the early mouse embryo. The mouse zygotic genome is transcriptionally activated soon after the first embryo cleavage ( 15 , 20 , 23 ). Two additional mitotic divisions then lead the embryo to the 8-cell stage at which its peripheral blastomeres compact and establish tight and gap junctional communications with each other ( 21 , 24 ), eventually resulting in blastocoel cavity formation. Our results indicate that Tcl1 -deficient embryos acquire major differentiative traits normally and with the appropriate developmental timing. At the time of compaction, however, these embryos consistently display a reduced number of blastomeres, indicating a specific defect(s) in blastomere proliferation per se . As a consequence of the impaired blastomere proliferation, the in vitro cultured Tcl1 −/− embryos are unable to reach the blastocyst stage and, likewise, neither are the heterozygote embryos derived from Tcl1 −/− mothers. The presence of a paternal Tcl1 allele can only partially rescue the defect in initial blastomere proliferation, but not the eventual embryo development to the blastocyst stage, as a further indication that maternally derived Tcl1 is essential to early mouse embryo development. The Tcl1 dependency of initial embryo cleavages thus represents one of the earliest phenotypes so far elucidated in mouse gene targeted models.

Our observation that Tcl1 expression is higher under in vitro versus in vivo conditions is concordant with the findings of Minami et al. ( 22 ) who have described enhanced Tcl1 gene expression in embryos cultured without oviductal tissues. This higher expression of Tcl1 might account also for the more dramatic in vitro phenotype observed for Tcl1 −/− embryos compared with the in vivo phenotype, wherein the absence of Tcl1 in females reduces their litter size and significantly shortens their reproductive life. This suggests that alternative mechanisms may counteract the lack of Tcl1 in vivo . Tcl1 has been shown to interact with Akt to increase Akt kinase activity ( 4 , 5 ) through the formation of Akt-Tcl1 hetero-oligomers ( 25 , 26 ). Tcl1 may thus act as a structural amplification loop in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) Akt pathway ( 25 ). Although the mechanism of Tcl1 action in early embryo development is not yet fully elucidated, the Tcl1 cofactor role in the PI3-kinase Akt pathway may be essential under conditions where growth factors are minimal, as for the in vitro conditions used in this study or in the absence of oviduct factors ( 22 ).

The nuclear translocation of Tcl1 is assumed to have functional significance on the basis of the Tc11 β-barrel structure ( 27 , 28 ), TCL1 expression patterns in normal lymphoid and cancerous tissues ( 8 , 17 ), and the enhancing effects of TCL1 and AKT1 cotransfection ( 4 ). The present analysis of early mouse embryos unambiguously demonstrates that Tcl1 is repetitively translocated from the extranuclear cortical region to the nucleus in a cell-cycle-dependent manner during the first three mitotic divisions. The initial localization of Tcl1 in the outmost region of embryo cortex may suggest a role for this factor in an external milieu sensing capacity. Interestingly, the abridgement of the Tcl1 shuttling by the 8-cell stage and the concordant progressive decrease in Tcl1 expression coincides precisely with the developmental blockade observed in Tcl1 −/− embryos.

A definitive interpretation of the pathogenetic significance of the elevated Tcl1 expression that we observed in seminomas will require further genetic analysis. Nevertheless, Tcl1 overexpression in human seminomas is highly suggestive in view of the fact that ectopic TCL1 overexpression is associated with the development of lymphoid tumors ( 3 , 29 , 30 ). The Tcl1 associate, Akt1, may be linked to the spermatogenesis process in that Akt1 −/− mice have increased testicular cell apoptosis and attenuated spermatogenesis ( 31 ). Although an increase in phosphorylated Akt apparently does not accompany the elevated Tcl1 expression in human seminomas, the most well-documented effect of Tcl1 is to increase Akt kinase activity. Tcl1 could thus act to maximize kinase activity of the Akt, which is present in very low levels in the seminoma cells. In this regard, transfection experiments have indicated that whereas Tcl1 is unable to directly induce Akt phosphorylation, it can effectively enhance Akt kinase activity ( 4 ). In conclusion, the present studies indicate that TCL1 plays a significant role in early embryo development and suggest that it may also contribute to the pathophysiology of male germ cells.
