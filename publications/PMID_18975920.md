Molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family counteract 
protein misfolding in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models. To 
determine whether human Hsp70 exerts similar effects on the aggregation of 
alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn), the key component of insoluble fibrils present in 
Parkinson's disease, we investigated alpha-Syn fibril assembly in the presence 
of Hsp70. We found in vitro assembly was efficiently inhibited by 
substoichiometric concentrations of purified Hsp70 in the absence of cofactors. 
Experiments using alpha-Syn deletion mutants indicated that interactions between 
the Hsp70 substrate binding domain and the alpha-Syn core hydrophobic region 
underlie assembly inhibition. This assembly process was inhibited prior to the 
elongation stage as we failed to detect any fibrils by electron microscopy. In 
addition, fluorescence polarization and binding assays suggest that Hsp70 
recognizes soluble alpha-Syn species in a highly dynamic and reversible manner. 
Together, these results provide novel insights into how Hsp70 suppresses 
alpha-Syn aggregation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that this critical step 
in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis may be subject to modulation by a common 
molecular chaperone.
