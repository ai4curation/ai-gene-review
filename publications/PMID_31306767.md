The activation of long-chain free fatty acids is the first step reaction of 
their usage in the cells and tissues, which are catalyzed by a family of enzymes 
called acyl-coenzyme A synthetases long-chain isoform (ACSL). The five ACSL 
enzymes identified in mammals are thought to have specific and differing 
functions. Among them, ACSL4 is a unique isozyme that preferentially catalyzes 
several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid (AA), and 
ACSL4 is thought to be an important isozyme for PUFA metabolism. Recent studies 
revealed that ACSL4 is involved in biological responses including inflammation, 
steroidogenesis, cell death, female fertility, and cancer. ACSL4 and its 
substrate PUFAs are thus likely to contribute to these responses. However, the 
roles of ACSL4 in PUFA metabolism are not fully understood. In this review, we 
describe the recent progress in ACSL4 research including the involvement of this 
enzyme in AA metabolism.
