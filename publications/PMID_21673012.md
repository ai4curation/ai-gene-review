To find genes and proteins that collaborate with BRCA1 or BRCA2 in the 
pathogenesis of breast cancer, we used an informatics approach and found a 
candidate BRCA interactor, KIAA0101, to function like BRCA1 in exerting a 
powerful control over centrosome number. The effect of KIAA0101 on centrosomes 
is likely direct, as its depletion does not affect the cell cycle, KIAA0101 
localizes to regions coincident with the centrosomes, and KIAA0101 binds to 
BRCA1. We analyzed whether KIAA0101 protein is overexpressed in breast cancer 
tumor samples in tissue microarrays, and we found that overexpression of 
KIAA0101 correlated with positive Ki67 staining, a biomarker associated with 
increased disease severity. Furthermore, overexpression of the KIAA0101 gene in 
breast tumors was found to be associated with significantly decreased survival 
time. This study identifies KIAA0101 as a protein important for breast 
tumorigenesis, and as this factor has been reported as a UV repair factor, it 
may link the UV damage response to centrosome control.
