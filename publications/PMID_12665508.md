A large number of correlative studies have established that the activation of 
the unfolded protein response (UPR) alters the cell's sensitivity to 
chemotherapeutic agents. Although the induction of the glucose-regulated 
proteins (GRPs) is commonly used as an indicator for the UPR, the direct role of 
the GRPs in conferring resistance to DNA damaging agents has not been proven. We 
report here that without the use of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers, 
specific overexpression of GRP78 results in reduced apoptosis and higher colony 
survival when challenged with topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and 
doxorubicin, and topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. While investigating 
the mechanism for the GRP78 protective effect against etoposide-induced cell 
death, we discovered that in contrast to the UPR, GRP78 overexpression does not 
result in G1 arrest or depletion of topoisomerase II. Caspase-7, an executor 
caspase that is associated with the ER, is activated by etoposide. We show here 
that specific expression of GRP78 blocks caspase-7 activation by etoposide both 
in vivo and in vitro, and this effect can be reversed by addition of dATP in a 
cell-free system. Recently, it was reported that ectopically expressed GRP78 and 
caspases-7 and -12 form a complex, thus coupling ER stress to the cell death 
program. However, the mechanism of how GRP78, a presumably ER lumen protein, can 
regulate cytosolic effectors of apoptosis is not known. Here we provide evidence 
that a subpopulation of GRP78 can exist as an ER transmembrane protein, as well 
as co-localize with caspase-7, as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. 
Co-immunoprecipitation studies further reveal endogenous GRP78 constitutively 
associates with procaspase-7 but not with procaspase-3. Lastly, a GRP78 mutant 
deleted of its ATP binding domain fails to bind procaspase-7 and loses its 
protective effect against etoposide-induced apoptosis.
