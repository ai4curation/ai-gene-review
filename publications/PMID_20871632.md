The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase family and have been implicated in tumorigenesis. One isoform in 
particular, JNK2α, has been shown to be frequently activated in primary brain 
tumors, to enhance several tumorigenic phenotypes and to increase tumor 
formation in mice. As JNK is frequently activated in non-small cell lung 
carcinoma (NSCLC), we investigated the role of the JNK2α isoform in NSCLC 
formation by examining its expression in primary tumors and by modulating its 
expression in cultured cell lines. We discovered that 60% of the tested primary 
NSCLC tumors had three-fold higher JNK2 protein and two- to three-fold higher 
JNK2α mRNA expression than normal lung control tissue. To determine the 
importance of JNK2α in NSCLC progression, we reduced JNK2α expression in 
multiple NSCLC cell lines using short hairpin RNA. Cell lines deficient in JNK2α 
had decreased cellular growth and anchorage-independent growth, and the tumors 
were four-fold smaller in mass. To elucidate the mechanism by which JNK2α 
induces NSCLC growth, we analyzed the JNK substrate, signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Our data demonstrates for the first time 
that JNK2α can regulate the transcriptional activity of STAT3 by phosphorylating 
the Ser727 residue, thereby regulating the expression of oncogenic genes, such 
as c-Myc. Furthermore, reintroduction of JNK2α2 or STAT3 restored the 
tumorigenicity of the NSCLC cells, demonstrating that JNK2α is important for 
NSCLC progression. Our studies reveal a novel mechanism in which phosphorylation 
of STAT3 is mediated by a constitutively active JNK2 isoform, JNK2α.
