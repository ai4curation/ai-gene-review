We demonstrate the efficacy of double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) 
of gene expression in generating "knock-out" phenotypes for specific proteins in 
several Drosophila cell lines. We prove the applicability of this technique for 
studying signaling cascades by dissecting the well-characterized insulin signal 
transduction pathway. Specifically, we demonstrate that inhibiting the 
expression of the DSOR1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MAPKK) 
prevents the activation of the downstream ERK-A (MAPK). In contrast, blocking 
ERK-A expression results in increased activation of DSOR1. We also show that 
Drosophila AKT (DAKT) activation depends on the insulin receptor substrate, 
CHICO (IRS1-4). Finally, we demonstrate that blocking the expression of 
Drosophila PTEN results in the activation of DAKT. In all cases, the 
interference of the biochemical cascade by RNAi is consistent with the known 
steps in the pathway. We extend this powerful technique to study two proteins, 
DSH3PX1 and Drosophila ACK (DACK). DSH3PX1 is an SH3, phox homology 
domain-containing protein, and DACK is homologous to the mammalian activated 
Cdc42 tyrosine kinase, ACK. Using RNAi, we demonstrate that DACK is upstream of 
DSH3PX1 phosphorylation, making DSH3PX1 an identified downstream 
target/substrate of ACK-like tyrosine kinases. These experiments highlight the 
usefulness of RNAi in dissecting complex biochemical signaling cascades and 
provide a highly effective method for determining the function of the identified 
genes arising from the Drosophila genome sequencing project.
