Ikaros--a factor that positively or negatively controls gene transcription--is 
active in murine adult erythroid cells, and involved in fetal to adult globin 
switching. Mice with Ikaros mutations have defects in erythropoiesis and anemia. 
In this paper, we have studied the role of Ikaros in human erythroid development 
for the first time. Using a gene-transfer strategy, we expressed Ikaros 6 
(Ik6)--a known dominant--negative protein that interferes with normal Ikaros 
activity-in cord blood or apheresis CD34(+) cells that were induced to 
differentiate along the erythroid pathway. Lentivirally induced Ik6-forced 
expression resulted in increased cell death, decreased cell proliferation, and 
decreased expression of erythroid-specific genes, including GATA1 and fetal and 
adult globins. In contrast, we observed the maintenance of a residual myeloid 
population that can be detected in this culture system, with a relative increase 
of myeloid gene expression, including PU1. In secondary cultures, expression of 
Ik6 favored reversion of sorted and phenotypically defined erythroid cells into 
myeloid cells, and prevented reversion of myeloid cells into erythroid cells. We 
conclude that Ikaros is involved in human adult or fetal erythroid 
differentiation as well as in the commitment between erythroid and myeloid 
cells.
