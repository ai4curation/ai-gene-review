We have found that expression of the Bip (immunoglobulin heavy chain binding 
protein)/GRP78 (glucose regulated protein 78) gene is markedly enhanced 
specifically among the heat shock protein (HSP) 70 gene family during the 
neuronal cell death of PC12 (22a) cells, that is induced by removal of nerve 
growth factor (NGF) and blocked by a transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D. The 
Bip mRNA induction is suppressed when the NGF-deprivation-dependent cell death 
of PC12 (22a) cells is inhibited by cAMP, cycloheximide or high K+. The Ca2+ 
ionophore, A23187, caused neuronal cell death accompanied by up-regulation of 
Bip, HSP90, and HSP70 mRNAs. In addition, a chelator of intracellular Ca2+ 
(BAPTA) elevated Bip mRNA and induced cell death in a low Ca2+ medium. 
Alterations of intracellular calcium homeostasis thus appear to induce Bip mRNA 
expression as well as apoptosis in PC12 (22a) cells. However, release of Ca2+ 
from intracellular stores by thapsigargin induced Bip mRNA expression but not 
cell death, indicating that Bip mRNA induction is not sufficient for neuronal 
death. Induction of Bip mRNA in association with apoptosis was also observed for 
NGF-deprived sympathetic ganglion cells in primary culture. These lines of 
evidence suggest that selective induction of Bip mRNA may play an important role 
in the programmed cell death of neurons deprived of neurotrophic factors and 
could be a landmark of the neuronal programmed cell death.
