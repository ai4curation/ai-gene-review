Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is caused by alterations in the WAS protein 
(WASP), and 80% of the missense mutations are located in the WH1 domain, the 
region essential for interaction with the WASP-interacting protein (WIP). It has 
been suggested that loss of WASP-WIP interaction is causal to the disease. 
Las17p (yeast WASP) is essential for growth at 37 degrees C. The growth defect 
of the las17Delta strain can be suppressed by the expression of human WASP 
together with WIP. Using the las17Delta strain, we have analyzed 52 missense 
mutations in the gene encoding WASP and found that 13 of these mutant proteins 
were unable to suppress the growth defect of the las17Delta strain. The majority 
of these 13 mutations cause the classic WAS in humans and are located within the 
WH1 domain, while none of the 12 mutations outside the WH1 domain abolished the 
activity of WASP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. This suggests that some of 
the mutations (13 out of 40) in the WH1 domain cause the syndrome in humans by 
perturbing the WASP-WIP complex formation, while the rest of the mutations cause 
the syndrome without affecting the WASP-WIP complex formation, but may affect 
the activity of the complex.
