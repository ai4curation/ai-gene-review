Nucleophosmin (NPM)/B23 has been implicated in the regulation of centrosome 
duplication. NPM/B23 localizes between two centrioles in the unduplicated 
centrosome. Upon phosphorylation on Thr(199) by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 
(CDK2)/cyclin E, the majority of centrosomal NPM/B23 dissociates from 
centrosomes, but some NPM/B23 phosphorylated on Thr(199) remains at centrosomes. 
It has been shown that Thr(199) phosphorylation of NPM/B23 is critical for the 
physical separation of the paired centrioles, an initial event of the centrosome 
duplication process. Here, we identified ROCK II kinase, an effector of Rho 
small GTPase, as a protein that localizes to centrosomes and physically 
interacts with NPM/B23. Expression of the constitutively active form of ROCK II 
promotes centrosome duplication, while down-regulation of ROCK II expression 
results in the suppression of centrosome duplication, especially delaying the 
initiation of centrosome duplication during the cell cycle. Moreover, ROCK II 
regulates centrosome duplication in its kinase and centrosome localization 
activity-dependent manner. We further found that ROCK II kinase activity is 
significantly enhanced by binding to NPM/B23 and that NPM/B23 acquires a higher 
binding affinity to ROCK II upon phosphorylation on Thr(199). Moreover, physical 
interaction between ROCK II and NPM/B23 in vivo occurs in association with 
CDK2/cyclin E activation and the emergence of Thr(199)-phosphorylated NPM/B23. 
All these findings point to ROCK II as the effector of the CDK2/cyclin E-NPM/B23 
pathway in the regulation of centrosome duplication.
