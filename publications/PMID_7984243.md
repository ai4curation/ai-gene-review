The heat-inducible members of the Hsp100 (or Clp) family of proteins share a 
common function in helping organisms to survive extreme stress, but the basic 
mechanism through which these proteins function is not understood. Hsp104 
protects cells against a variety of stresses, under many physiological 
conditions, and its function has been evolutionarily conserved, at least from 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae to Arabidopsis thaliana. Homology with the Escherichia 
coli ClpA protein suggests that Hsp104 may provide stress tolerance by helping 
to rid the cell of heat-denatured proteins through proteolysis. But genetic 
analysis indicates that Hsp104 may function like Hsp70 as a molecular chaperone. 
Here we investigate the role of Hsp104 in vivo using a temperature-sensitive 
Vibrio harveyi luciferase-fusion protein as a test substrate. We find that 
Hsp104 does not protect luciferase from thermal denaturation, nor does it 
promote proteolysis of luciferase. Rather, Hsp104 functions in a manner not 
previously described for other heat-shock proteins: it mediates the 
resolubilization of heat-inactivated luciferase from insoluble aggregates.
