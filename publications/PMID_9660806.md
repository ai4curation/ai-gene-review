Here we show that the yeast mitochondrial chaperone Ssc2p, a homolog of 
mt-Hsp70, plays a critical role in mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Yeast with 
ssc2-1 mutations were identified by a screen for altered iron-dependent gene 
regulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. These mutants exhibit increased 
cellular iron uptake, and the iron accumulates exclusively within mitochondria. 
Yfh1p is homologous to frataxin, the human protein implicated in the 
neurodegenerative disease, Friedreich's ataxia. Like mutants of yfh1, ssc2-1 
mutants accumulate vast quantities of iron in mitochondria. Furthermore, using 
import studies with isolated mitochondria, we demonstrate a specific role for 
Ssc2p in the maturation of Yfh1p within this organelle. This function for a 
mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone is likely to be conserved, implying that a human 
homolog of Ssc2p may be involved in iron homeostasis and in neurodegenerative 
disease.
