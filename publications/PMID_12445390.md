By integrating functional genomic and proteomic mapping approaches, biological 
hypotheses should be formulated with increasing levels of confidence. For 
example, yeast interactome and transcriptome data can be correlated in 
biologically meaningful ways. Here, we combine interactome mapping data 
generated for a multicellular organism with data from both large-scale 
phenotypic analysis ("phenome mapping") and transcriptome profiling. First, we 
generated a two-hybrid interactome map of the Caenorhabditis elegans germline by 
using 600 transcripts enriched in this tissue. We compared this map to a phenome 
map of the germline obtained by RNA interference (RNAi) and to a transcriptome 
map obtained by clustering worm genes across 553 expression profiling 
experiments. In this dataset, we find that essential proteins have a tendency to 
interact with each other, that pairs of genes encoding interacting proteins tend 
to exhibit similar expression profiles, and that, for approximately 24% of 
germline interactions, both partners show overlapping embryonic lethal or high 
incidence of males RNAi phenotypes and similar expression profiles. We propose 
that these interactions are most likely to be relevant to germline biology. 
Similar integration of interactome, phenome, and transcriptome data should be 
possible for other biological processes in the nematode and for other organisms, 
including humans.
