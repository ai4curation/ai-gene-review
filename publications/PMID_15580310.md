Human WWOX gene encodes a proapoptotic WW domain-containing oxidoreductase WOX1 
(also named WWOX, FOR2 or WWOXv1). Apoptotic and stress stimuli activate WOX1 
via Tyr33 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. WOX1 possesses a tetrad 
NSYK motif in the C-terminal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) 
domain, which may bind estrogen and androgen. Here, we determined that 
17beta-estradiol (E(2)) activated WOX1, p53 and ERK in COS7 fibroblasts, primary 
lung epithelial cells, and androgen receptor (AR)-negative prostate DU145 cells, 
but not in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast MCF7 cells. Androgen also 
activated WOX1 in the AR-negative DU145 cells. These observations suggest that 
sex hormone-mediated Tyr33 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of WOX1 is 
independent of ER and AR. Stress stimuli increase physical binding of p53 with 
WOX1 in vivo. We determined here that E(2) increased the formation of p53/WOX1 
complex and their nuclear translocation in COS7 cells; however, nuclear 
translocation of this complex could not occur in MCF7 cells. By 
immunohistochemistry, we determined that progression of prostate from normal to 
hyperplasia, cancerous and metastatic stages positively correlate with 
upregulation and activation of WOX1 and WOX2 (FOR1/WWOXv2). In contrast, breast 
cancer development to a premetastatic state is associated with upregulation and 
Tyr33 phosphorylation of cytosolic WOX1 and WOX2, followed by significant 
downregulation or absent expression during metastasis. These 
Tyr33-phosphorylated proteins are mostly located in the mitochondria without 
translocating to the nuclei, which is comparable to those findings in cultured 
breast cancer cells. Together, sex steroid hormone-induced activation of WOX1 
and WOX2 is independent of ER and AR, and this activation positively correlates 
with cancerous progression of prostate and breast to a premetastatic state.
