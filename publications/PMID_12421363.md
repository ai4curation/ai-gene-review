Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) is an essential protein kinase that 
regulates numerous functions within the cell. One critically important substrate 
of GSK3beta is the microtubule-associated protein tau. Phosphorylation of tau by 
GSK3beta decreases tau-microtubule interactions. In addition to phosphorylating 
tau, GSK3beta is a downstream regulator of the wnt signaling pathway, which 
maintains the levels of beta-catenin. Axin plays a central role in regulating 
beta-catenin levels by bringing together GSK3beta and beta-catenin and 
facilitating the phosphorylation of beta-catenin, targeting it for 
ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Although axin clearly 
facilitates the phosphorylation of beta-catenin, its effects on the 
phosphorylation of other GSK3beta substrates are unclear. Therefore in this 
study the effects of axin on GSK3beta-mediated tau phosphorylation were 
examined. The results clearly demonstrate that axin is a negative regulator of 
tau phosphorylation by GSK3beta. This negative regulation of GSK3beta-mediated 
tau phosphorylation is due to the fact that axin efficiently binds GSK3beta but 
not tau and thus sequesters GSK3beta away from tau, as an axin mutant that does 
not bind GSK3beta did not inhibit tau phosphorylation by GSK3beta. This is the 
first demonstration that axin negatively affects the phosphorylation of a 
GSK3beta substrate, and provides a novel mechanism by which tau phosphorylation 
and function can be regulated within the cell.
