Hearing impairment is a worldwide health problem. Employing semi-quantitative 
immunological detection methods, we found that the apoptosis inhibitor protein 
Birc5 is expressed in cell types critical for hearing perception. In the guinea 
pig model, moderate noise exposure causing only a temporary mean hearing 
impairment of 33dB significantly enhanced Birc5 expression in the spiral 
ligament, nerve fibers and the organ of Corti. In contrast, intratympanic 
gentamicin injection inducing permanent cell damage and mean hearing loss of 
24dB correlated with a significant Birc5 downregulation in the ligament, nerve 
fibers and the organ of Corti. The cytoprotective activity of the guinea pig and 
human Birc5 protein was confirmed by cloning of the gene and by subsequent 
ectopic expression and challenging studies against the ototoxin gentamicin in 
epithelial and auditory cell models. As the mammalian cochlea is unable to 
regenerate upon damage, these data suggest that modulation of Birc5 expression 
may represent a novel physiological mechanism to protect the inner ear against 
stress-induced cell damage. Hence, the targeted modulation of Birc5 levels may 
lead to novel otoprotective therapeutic strategies.
