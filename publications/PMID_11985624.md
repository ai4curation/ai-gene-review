A systematic search for Escherichia coli proteins with the zinc-binding activity 
was performed using the assay of radioactive Zn(II) binding to total E. coli 
proteins fractionated by two methods of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A 
total of 30-40 radioactive spots were identified, of which 14 have been assigned 
from N-terminal sequencing. In addition to five known zinc-binding proteins, 
nine zinc-binding proteins were newly identified including: acetate kinase 
(AckA), DnaK, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA), transketolase isozymes 
(TktA/TktB), translation elongation factor Ts (Tsf), ribosomal proteins L2 
(RplB), L13 (RplM) and one of S15 (RpsO), S16 (RpsP) or S17 (RpsQ). Together 
with about 20 known zinc-binding proteins, the total number of zinc-binding 
proteins in E. coli increased up to more than 30 species (or more than 3% of 
about 1000 proteins expressed under laboratory culture conditions). The 
specificity and affinity of zinc-binding were analysed for some of the 
zinc-binding proteins.
