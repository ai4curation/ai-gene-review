The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor. In 
this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate cDNAs encoding 
proteins that interact with the human GR ligand-binding domain (LBD) in a 
ligand-dependent manner. One isolated cDNA from a HeLa cell library encoded the 
COOH-terminal portion of the eta-isoform of the 14-3-3 protein (residues 
187-246). Glucocorticoid agonists, triamcinolone acetonide and dexamethasone, 
induced the GR LBD/14-3-3eta protein fragment interaction, but an antagonist, 
RU486, did not. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments in vitro showed 
that full-length 14-3-3eta protein also interacted with the activated GR. 
Transient transfection studies using COS-7 cells revealed a stimulatory effect 
of 14-3-3eta protein on transcriptional activation by the GR. The 14-3-3 family 
members have recently been found to associate with a number of important 
signaling proteins, such as protein kinase C and Raf-1, as functional 
modulators. Our findings suggest a novel regulatory role of 14-3-3eta protein in 
GR-mediated signaling pathways and also point to a mechanism whereby GR may 
cross-talk with other signal transduction systems.
