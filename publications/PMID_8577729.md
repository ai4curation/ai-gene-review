SH-PTP1 (also known as PTP1C, HCP, and SHP) is a non-transmembrane protein 
tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) containing two tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) 
domains. We show here that the two SH2 (N-SH2 and C-SH2) domains in SH-PTP1 have 
different functions in regulation of the PTPase domain and thereby signal 
transduction. While the N-terminal SH2 domain is both necessary and sufficient 
for autoinhibition through an intramolecular association with the PTPase domain, 
truncation of the C-SH2 domain [SH-PTP1 (delta CSH2) construct] has little 
effect on SH-PTP1 activity. A synthetic phosphotyrosine residue (pY) peptide 
derived from the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR pY429) binds to the N-SH2 domain 
and activates both wild-type SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP1 (delta CSH2) 60- to 80-fold. 
Another pY peptide corresponding to a phosphorylation site on the IgG Fc 
receptor (Fc gamma RIIB1 pY309) associates with both the C-SH2 domain (Kd = 2.8 
microM and the N-SH2 domain (Kd = 15.0 microM) and also activates SH-PTP1 
12-fold. By analysis of the effect of the Fc gamma RIIB1 pY309 peptide on 
SH-PTP1 (delta CSH2), SH-PTP1 (R30K/R33E), SH-PTP1 (R30K/R136K), and SH-PTP1 
(R136K) mutants in which the function of either the N- or C-SH2 domain has been 
impaired, we have determined that both synthetic pY peptides stimulate SH-PTP1 
by binding to its N-SH2 domain; binding of pY ligand to the C-SH2 domain has no 
effect on SH-PTP1 activity. We propose that the N-terminal SH2 domain serves 
both as a regulatory domain and as a recruiting unit, whereas the C-terminal SH2 
domain acts merely as a recruiting unit.
