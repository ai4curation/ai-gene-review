Autophagy mediates the cellular response to nutrient deprivation, protein 
aggregation, and pathogen invasion in human. Dysfunction of autophagy has been 
implicated in multiple human diseases including cancer. The identification of 
novel autophagy factors in mammalian cells will provide critical mechanistic 
insights into how this complicated cellular pathway responds to a broad range of 
challenges. Here, we report the cloning of an autophagy-specific protein that we 
called Barkor (Beclin 1-associated autophagy-related key regulator) through 
direct interaction with Beclin 1 in the human phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
class III complex. Barkor shares 18% sequence identity and 32% sequence 
similarity with yeast Atg14. Elimination of Barkor expression by RNA 
interference compromises starvation- and rapamycin-induced LC3 lipidation and 
autophagosome formation. Overexpression of Barkor leads to autophagy activation 
and increased number and enlarged volume of autophagosomes. Tellingly, Barkor is 
also required for suppression of the autophagy-mediated intracellular survival 
of Salmonella typhimurium in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, Barkor competes 
with UV radiation resistance associated gene product (UVRAG) for interaction 
with Beclin 1, and the complex formation of Barkor and Beclin1 is required for 
their localizations to autophagosomes. Therefore, we define a regulatory 
signaling pathway mediated by Barkor that positively controls autophagy through 
Beclin 1 and represents a potential target for drug development in the treatment 
of human diseases implicated in autophagic dysfunction.
