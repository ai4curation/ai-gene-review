Dsl1p, an essential component of the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum retrieval 
system in yeast, uses the same sequence motif to interact with different 
subunits of the COPI vesicle coat.

Dsl1p is required for Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrograde transport in 
yeast. It interacts with the ER resident protein Tip20p and with delta-COP, a 
subunit of coatomer, the coat complex of COPI vesicles. To test the significance 
of these interactions, we mapped the different binding sites and created mutant 
versions of Dsl1p and delta-COP, which are unable to bind directly to each 
other. Three domains were identified in Dsl1p: a Tip20p binding region within 
the N-terminal 200 residues, a highly acidic region in the center of Dsl1p 
containing crucial tryptophan residues that is required for binding to delta-COP 
and essential for viability, and an evolutionarily well conserved domain at the 
C terminus. Most importantly, Dsl1p uses the same central acidic domain to 
interact not only with delta-COP but also with alpha-COP. Strong interaction 
with alpha-COP requires the presence of comparable amounts of epsilon-COP or 
beta' -COP. Thus, the binding characteristics of Dsl1p resemble those of many 
accessory factors of the clathrin coat. They interact with different layers of 
the vesicle coat by using tandemly arranged sequence motifs, some of which have 
dual specificity.
