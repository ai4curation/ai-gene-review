The programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) protein plays an important 
apoptosis-accelerating role in cells undergoing apoptosis. Decreased expression 
of PDCD5 has been detected in various human carcinomas. Here we describe that 
one potent short interfering RNA (siRNA) against the PDCD5 (siPDCD5) 
specifically inhibits the expression of PDCD5 at both the mRNA and protein 
level. Cells with decreased PDCD5 expression displayed reduced sensitivity to an 
apoptotic stimulus induced by Bax overexpression in HeLa, HEK293 and 293T cell 
lines. Furthermore, we also show that siPDCD5 inhibited both caspase-3 activity 
and procaspase-3 cleavage. Suppressed expression of PDCD5 attenuates the release 
of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol induced by Bax overexpression. This 
phenomenon is accompanied by the reduced translocation of Bax from the cytosol 
to mitochondria. MTT assay shows that targeted suppression of PDCD5 expression 
markedly promoted cell proliferation in Hela and HEK293 cell lines. Our data 
suggests that PDCD5 may exert its effects through pathway of mitochondria by 
modulating Bax translocation, cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation 
directly or indirectly, and that decreased PDCD5 expression may be one of the 
mechanisms by which tumor cells achieve resistance to apoptotic stimulus induced 
by anticancer drugs.
