GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) is the rate-limiting enzyme of a metabolic pathway 
synthesizing tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), the cofactor dimerizing and activating 
inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2). GCH1 protein expression and enzyme 
activity are minimal in cultured, phenotypically stable, untreated normal adult 
human astrocytes (NAHA), but are strongly induced, together with NOS-2, by a 
mixture of three proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and 
IFN-gamma--the CM-trio) released by microglia under brain-damaging conditions. 
The resulting hyper-production of NO severely harms neurons. In this study, 
using MALDI-TOF/MS, PMF, Western immunoblotting (WB), and antibody microarrays 
we identified several proteins coimmunoprecipitating with GCH1. Under basal 
conditions, GCH1 was associated with various adaptor/regulator molecules 
involved in G-protein-coupled receptors signalling, protein serine/threonine 
phosphatase 2Cbeta (PP2Cbeta), and serine-threonine kinases like Ca(2+) 
calmodulin kinases (CaMKs), casein kinases (CKs), cAMP-dependent kinases (PKAs), 
and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Exposure to the three cytokines' 
mixture (CM-trio) significantly changed, within the 48-72 h required for the 
induction and activation of GCH1, the levels and identities of some of the 0 
h-associated proteins: after 72 h CK-IIalpha tended to dissociate from, whereas 
MAPK12 and JNK3 were strongly associated with fully active GCH1. These findings 
provide a first enticing glimpse into the intricate mechanisms regulating GCH1 
activation by proinflammatory cytokines in NAHA, and may have therapeutic 
implications.
