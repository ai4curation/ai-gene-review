Uridine-cytidine kinase (UCK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of uridine and 
cytidine as well as the pharmacological activation of several cytotoxic 
pyrimidine ribonucleoside analogues. In this study, we investigated the 
functional role of two isoforms of UCK in neuroblastoma cell lines. Analysis of 
mRNA coding for UCK1 and UCK2 showed that UCK2 is the most abundantly expressed 
UCK in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines. Transient and stable overexpression 
of UCK2 in neuroblastoma cells increased the metabolism of uridine and cytidine 
as well as the cytotoxicity of 3-deazauridine. Knockdown of endogenous UCK2 as 
well as overexpression of UCK1 resulted in decreased metabolism of uridine and 
cytidine and protected the neuroblastoma cells from 3-deazauridine-induced 
toxicity. Subcellular localization studies showed that UCK1-GFP and UCK2-GFP 
were localized in the cell nucleus and cytosol, respectively. However, 
co-expression of UCK1 with UCK2 resulted in a nuclear localization of UCK2 
instead of its normal cytosolic localization, thereby impairing its normal 
function. The physical association of UCK1 and UCK2 was further demonstrated 
through pull-down analysis using his-tagged UCK. The discovery that UCK2 is 
highly expressed in neuroblastoma opens the possibility for selectively 
targeting neuroblastoma cells using UCK2-dependent pyrimidine analogues, while 
sparing normal tissues.
