We have identified a C. elegans protein, ceBNIP3, homologous to the human 
BCL-2/EIB-19K interacting BCL-2 family pro-apoptotic protein BNIP3. In 
transiently transfected mammalian cells, ceBNIP3 complexes with CED-9, the worm 
homolog of BCL-2. CeBNIP3 also efficiently heterodimerizes with the cell death 
protease proCED-3 by direct binding via the prodomain. Transfection of ceBNIP3 
and CED-3 results in enhanced proteolytic processing of the CED-3 zymogen and in 
cooperative induction of apoptosis. Coexpression of CED-9 suppresses the 
cooperative cell death induced by ceBNIP3 and CED-3. In cells coexpressing 
CED-9, ceBNIP3 and CED-3, all three proteins exist as a ternary complex 
suggesting that CED-9 may suppress cooperative apoptosis induced by CED-3 and 
ceBNIP3 by simultaneous complex formation with CED-3 and ceBNIP3. Our results 
suggest that ceBNIP3 may be a novel component of the C. elegans apoptosis 
paradigm and may initiate apoptosis by recruiting CED-3 to mitochondria and 
other cytoplasmic membranes.
