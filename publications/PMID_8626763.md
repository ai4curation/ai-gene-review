A double-stranded RNA structure transcribed from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat 
known as TAR is critical for increasing gene expression in response to the 
transactivator protein Tat. Two cellular factors, RNA polymerase II and TRP-185, 
bind specifically to TAR RNA, but require the presence of cellular proteins 
known as cofactors which by themselves are unable to bind to TAR RNA. In an 
attempt to determine the mechanism by which these cofactors stimulate binding to 
TAR RNA, we purified these factors from HeLa nuclear extract and amino acid 
microsequence analysis performed. Three proteins were identified in the cofactor 
fraction including two previously described proteins, elongation factor 1alpha 
(EF-1alpha) and the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), and a novel 
protein designated the stimulator of TAR RNA-binding proteins (SRB). SRB has a 
high degree of homology with a variety of cellular proteins known as 
chaperonins. Recombinant EF-1alpha, PTB, and SRB produced from vaccinia 
expression vectors stimulated the binding of RNA polymerase II and TRP-185 to 
TAR RNA in gel retardation analysis. These studies define a group of cellular 
factors that function in concert to stimulate the binding of TRP-185 and RNA 
polymerase II to HIV-1 TAR RNA.
