Thrombospondin (Thbs) proteins are induced in sites of tissue damage or active 
remodeling. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is also prominently 
induced with disease where it regulates protein production and resolution of 
misfolded proteins. Here we describe a function for Thbs as ER-resident 
effectors of an adaptive ER stress response. Thbs4 cardiac-specific transgenic 
mice were protected from myocardial injury, whereas Thbs4(-/-) mice were 
sensitized to cardiac maladaptation. Thbs induction produced a unique profile of 
adaptive ER stress response factors and expansion of the ER and downstream 
vesicles. Thbs bind the ER lumenal domain of activating transcription factor 6α 
(Atf6α) to promote its nuclear shuttling. Thbs4(-/-) mice showed blunted 
activation of Atf6α and other ER stress-response factors with injury, and 
Thbs4-mediated protection was lost upon Atf6α deletion. Hence, Thbs can function 
inside the cell during disease remodeling to augment ER function and protect 
through a mechanism involving regulation of Atf6α.

INTRODUCTION

The endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress response / unfolded protein response (UPR) has been studied for nearly 2 decades, revealing a role in many forms of human disease ( Glembotski, 2007 ; Zhang and Kaufman, 2008 ). Engagement of the ER stress response acutely reduces protein synthesis in the ER, enhances protein degradation of damaged or misfolded proteins, and selectively induces expression of protective proteins ( Glembotski, 2007 ; Zhang and Kaufman, 2008 ). While acute activation of the ER stress response is protective, prolongation of the response typically leads to cell death in the heart and other tissues ( Zhang and Kaufman, 2008 ; Hamada et al., 2004 ; Cook et al., 2009 ; Xu et al., 2009 ). The ER stress response is initiated within the ER lumen and membrane through the chaperone protein BiP (Grp78) that directly binds Ca 2+ and senses unfolded or damaged proteins. BiP then aids activation of three primary pathways; PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) and activating transcription factor 6 (Atf6). PERK activation at the ER membrane results in phosphorylation and inactivation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) to reduce protein synthesis but also to selectively induce expression of the transcription factor Atf4. The second branch involves IRE1α, which is a kinase and RNAase that mediates selective splicing of the message encoding the transcription factor Xbp1. Finally, the third branch involves Atf6, an ER membrane bound transcription factor that shuttles to the Golgi with ER stress stimulation where it is cleaved into an active form that translocates to the nucleus.

Five thrombospondins (Thbs) genes are present in mammals that encode secreted matricellular Ca 2+ -binding glycoproteins involved in diverse biologic processes given their ability to bind numerous proteins and serve as interaction platforms in the extracellular matrix (ECM) ( Stenina et al., 2007 ; Kazerounian et al., 2008 ). Thbs1 and 2 comprise a subfamily that form homo-and hetero-trimers. They contain a procollagen binding domain, a type 1 repeat domain that binds transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), and domains that bind β1 integrins, calreticulin, and the CD36 and CD47 receptors ( Kazerounian et al., 2008 ). In contrast, Thbs3/4/5 constitute a different structural subfamily that forms homo- and hetero-pentamers. This subfamily lacks the procollagen domain and type 1 repeats, and they are less than 50% homologous to Thbs1 and 2 with presumably divergent functions ( Stenina et al., 2007 ; Kazerounian et al., 2008 ). All 5 Thbs gene family members appear capable of low-level ubiquitous expression in diverse tissues, although each is dramatically induced by injury, stress, or acute remodeling events ( Kazerounian et al., 2008 ). For example, Thbs1, Thbs2, Thbs3 and Thbs4 are each induced in the heart in response to hypertrophy or infarction injury ( Schroen et al., 2004 ; Stenina et al., 2007 ), and loss of Thbs1 or Thbs2 in gene-targeted mice promoted greater cardiac disease with aging or stress stimulation ( Swinnen et al., 2009 ; Schroen et al., 2004 ; Frangogiannis et al., 2005 ). Thbs1 and Thbs4 reside within the ER, either indefinitely or for a period of time before being secreted outside the cell, depending on Ca 2+ levels or the cell type that was examined ( Veliceasa et al., 2007 ).

DISCUSSION

Once induced in select tissues, Thbs protein expression can be observed directly within cells or between cells in the extracellular space ( Chen et al., 2000 ; Sodersten et al., 2007 ; Veliceasa et al., 2007 ; Greco et al., 2010 ). We observed prominent Thbs4 protein localization within the ER/SR compartment of adult cardiomyocytes of the heart, with some mild accumulation in the extracellular space or ECM. Indeed, while Thbs’ are generally secreted, examples of their intracellular retention in the ER or vesicles have been reported ( Chen et al., 2000 ; Sodersten et al., 2007 ; Veliceasa et al., 2007 ; Hauser et al., 1995 ; Greco et al., 2010 ). Thbs’ are assembled into trimers (Thbs1 and 2) or pentamers (Thbs3, 4, and 5) in the ER, and Thbs1 was shown to be part of a complex with PDI, BiP, p72 and Grp94, and to reside in the ER compartment for up to 30 minutes before presumably shuttling to the Golgi for gylcosylation ( Prabakaran et al., 1996 ; Kuznetsov, 1997 ; Hecht et al., 2001 ). More provocatively, Thbs1 is retained in the ER in response to low calcium levels in renal cell carcinoma tissue and cultured cells, while restoration of ER calcium permitted Thbs1 secretion ( Veliceasa et al., 2007 ). Thus, Thbs’ could easily have a primary function in the ER or other associated intracellular vesicular compartments, either as they are being produced in complexes with known ER stress chaperones or ECM proteins, or if they maintain residence in the ER long-term, as regulators of the ER stress response in conjunction with calcium sensing.

Here we identified a novel role for Thbs in the ER stress response to presumably enhance the ability of a cell to secrete proteins, properly re-construct the ECM after injury, and deal with unfolded proteins during disease. We determined that the type 3 repeat domain in Thbs4 directly binds to Atf6α to facilitate its activation ( Figure S6 ). All 5 Thbs contain this calcium-binding type 3 repeat domain, although its function remains essentially unknown ( Kazerounian et al., 2008 ). Here we propose a working hypothesis that accounts for induction of all 5 Thbs genes during injury or tissue remodeling, incorporates the fact that these proteins are resident in the ER-vesicular network, and that builds from our new observations related to Atf6α activation by Thbs4 ( Figure S6 ). We propose that the type 3 repeat domain in Thbs’ activates Atf6α to upregulate the protective ER stress response. Increased Atf6α activity is known to expand the ER compartment and upregulate other ER stress response effectors and chaperones ( Adachi et al., 2008 ; Bommiasamy et al., 2009 ). In addition, a previously published mRNA expression analysis from mice containing a tamoxifen-inducible activated Atf6α transgene for heart-specific expression showed a very similar profile of enhanced ER stress response genes as our microarrays from Thbs4 DTG hearts, suggesting that Atf6α is the primary mediator of Thbs effects in the heart ( Belmont et al., 2008 ; Martindale et al., 2006 ). It is also interesting to speculate that Thbs4 might be more evolutionarily divergent as a dedicated mediator of this adaptive ER stress/conditioning effect with injury compared with Thbs1 and 2. Indeed, loss of Thbs4 −/− in the mouse compromised the ER stress response activation profile that is normally observed with acute injury to the heart, despite known induction and presence of Thbs1 and Thbs2 with cardiac injury ( Schellings et al., 2009 ).

A critical observation that supports the importance and function of the type 3 repeat domain comes from known mutations in COMP (encodes Thbs5 protein) that causes genetic diseases resulting in skeletal dysplasia ( Briggs et al., 1995 ; Hecht et al., 1995 ). Such mutations in COMP occur within the type 3 repeat domain that appears to affect its function and ability to traverse the ER compartment ( Hecht et al., 2001 ; Hashimoto et al., 2003 ). Indeed mutations in this type 3 repeat region of COMP cause its retention in the ER, co-retention of type IX collagen and aggrecan, sequestration of several ER stress chaperones, and enlargement of the rER compartment ( Hecht et al., 1998 ; Delot et al., 1999 ; Vranka et al., 2001 ; Chen et al., 2007 ). The inability of the mutant Thbs5 protein to leave the ER and be secreted causes a maladaptive ER stress response leading to cellular apoptosis ( Hashimoto et al., 2003 ). These results suggest that the type 3 repeat domain is critical for proper ER conditioning and processing of Thbs proteins once generated, which also directly affects overall ER function and the ability to properly produce and secrete other ECM proteins. These results also suggest that Thbs proteins may have a chaperone-like function for processing large ECM-fated proteins for their construction outside the cell after injury. Interestingly, this type 3 repeat domain in Thbs’ binds calcium where is could also serve to sense the health of the ER environment. Indeed, reductions in ER calcium are known to cause Thbs1 ER retention and lack of secretion ( Veliceasa et al., 2007 ).

While Thbs4 produced a protective ER stress response through Atf6α activation, we cannot exclude other protective functions of Thbs4 in the ER or associated vesicles that might be separate from Atf6α. Indeed, proteins that underlie ERAD were specifically upregulated in Thbs4-DTG hearts. Another possibility is that Thbs4 itself might function to enhance vesicular trafficking through the secretory pathway to help move more traditional ECM targeted proteins outside the cell. Indeed, while the ER was expanded in Thbs4 DTG hearts, we also observed a large increase in total vesicles throughout the cytosol and near the plasma membranes of cardiomyocytes, suggesting enhanced trafficking. We also observed increased markers of autophagy (LC3) and signs of greater autophagic vesicles by EM, especially in Thbs1 DTG hearts ( Figure 3G , and data not shown). However, it is also possible that simply mobilizing Atf6α mediates all or much of the protective and adaptive ER functions observed in Thbs4 DTG hearts, especially given the results with the decoy pieces of Thbs4 (type 3 repeat domain) and the dominant negative luminal portion of Aft6α. While PERK and Atf4 were mildly activated in Thbs4 DTG hearts or by AdThbs4 infection in neonatal cardiomyocytes, this effect could also be due to a primary change in Atf6α, which secondarily changes BiP levels or other ER stress regulatory factors to possibly favor PERK activation. IRE1α was noticeably down-regulated by Thbs4 overexpression, which again could be due to adaptive secondary changes associated with Atf6α.

Our results show a unique paradigm whereby these Thbs proteins contain within their primary sequence all the necessary domains for ER adaptation and greater construction or turnover of the ECM with injury or disease. Thbs proteins contain a highly conserved domain that functions to condition the ER when expressed through a direct effect on Atf6α that results in expansion of the ER for greater capacity, along with more protective chaperones that aid in generation of complex ECM proteins. Thbs proteins also bind various ECM proteins where they likely facilitate their processing and eventual extrusion into the ECM, after which Thbs proteins are likely degraded. Such built in heterofunctionality allows inherent coordination of extracellular milieu content or dynamic extracellular replacement events with increased functioning of the ER and vesicular trafficking. Such conditions most likely arise after injury in adult tissues or during active developmental remodeling, or when ER calcium levels are altered during chronic disease.
