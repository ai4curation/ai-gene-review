The synthesis and trafficking of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in both prokaryotes 
and eukaryotes requires coordination within an expanding network of proteins 
that function in the cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts in order 
to assemble and deliver these ancient and essential cofactors to a wide variety 
of Fe-S-dependent enzymes and proteins. This review focuses on the evolving 
roles of two ubiquitous classes of proteins that operate in this network: CGFS 
glutaredoxins and BolA proteins. Monothiol or CGFS glutaredoxins possess a 
Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser active site that coordinates an Fe-S cluster in a homodimeric 
complex. CGFS glutaredoxins also form [2Fe-2S]-bridged heterocomplexes with BolA 
proteins, which possess an invariant His and an additional His or Cys residue 
that serve as cluster ligands. Here we focus on recent discoveries in bacteria, 
fungi, humans, and plants that highlight the shared and distinct roles of CGFS 
glutaredoxins and BolA proteins in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, Fe-S cluster storage 
and trafficking, and Fe-S cluster signaling to transcriptional factors that 
control iron metabolism--.

Abstract

The synthesis and trafficking of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes requires coordination within an expanding network of proteins that function in the cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts in order to assemble and deliver these ancient and essential cofactors to a wide variety of Fe-S-dependent enzymes and proteins.

Monothiol or CGFS glutaredoxins possess a Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser active site that coordinates an Fe-S cluster in a homodimeric complex. CGFS glutaredoxins also form [2Fe-2S]-bridged heterocomplexes with BolA proteins, which possess an invariant His and an additional His or Cys residue that serve as cluster ligands.

1. Introduction

Transition metal trafficking, utilization, and regulation are critical processes for all organisms because transition metals serve as cofactors for a wide variety of essential pathways. In particular, iron is one of the most common cofactors for metalloenzymes owing to its abundance in nature and its favorable chemical properties [ 1 ]. This versatile redox-active metal can achieve multiple oxidation states, coordination geometries, and cofactor configurations in biological systems, in the form of mono- and di-iron centers, heme, and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. As such, iron metalloproteins play diverse, indispensable roles in cellular respiration, oxygen transport, nucleotide biosynthesis and repair, drug metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, proteins, cofactors, and vitamins, and many others [ 2 ]. Organisms must acquire and store iron in order to maintain sufficient levels to supply these iron-dependent pathways while minimizing harmful side reactions and mismetallation events that can occur with iron overaccumulation. The pathways for trafficking and storing iron as well as assembling iron cofactors involves coordination within an ever-growing network of proteins. Here we focus on two widespread protein families, the CGFS-type monothiol glutaredoxin (Grx) proteins and the BolA proteins, that specifically function in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, Fe-S cluster trafficking and storage, and iron sensing and regulation.

Conclusions and Future Outlook

The past few years have seen a plethora of new studies that have revealed key insights and crucial details about the molecular structures and functions of CGFS Grxs and BolA proteins found in prokaryotic organisms and in different subcellular compartments of eukaryotic organisms. CGFS Grxs and BolA proteins are implicated in Fe-S cluster trafficking and biogenesis in prokaryotes, although more biochemical and genetic studies are required to fully reveal the specific functions of these proteins in these organisms. In contrast, strong physiological evidence exists for the role of CGFS Grxs in mitochondria as central carrier proteins that link the early and late machinery for Fe-S biogenesis in yeast, plants, and humans. Similar phenotypes are observed across species when mitochondrial CGFS Grxs deficient or absent, suggesting a strong conservation of function. In general, mitochondrial BOLA deletions have somewhat weaker and more diffuse phenotypes (with the exception of the human BOLA3 deficiency symptoms), partially owing to the overlapping functions of multiple mitochondrial BolA paralogs, making the assignment of their specific functions more difficult. Additional cellular and genetic studies are required to more carefully tease out the individual roles of mitochondrial BolA proteins. Even less is known about the in vivo function of chloroplast Grx and BolA proteins due to the redundancy of function between Grx or BolA paralogs in the same compartment and the lack of specific single and double mutants for study. Although the considerable structural and biophysical information provided by analysis of these plant proteins has certainly driven this field forward. Finally, recent studies in yeast and human cells have clearly shown essential roles for cytosolic Grx and BolA proteins in trafficking [2Fe-2S] clusters to Fe-S cluster dependent enzymes and transcription factors that control iron metabolism. Many of the mechanistic details of these trafficking pathways are still missing, representing a ripe area of future study. In addition, a focus on cytosolic CGFS Grxs and BolA proteins controlling iron regulation and virulence in pathogenic fungi is just recently emerging, with many molecular details about their functional roles unexamined.
