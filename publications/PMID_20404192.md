The primary route of iron acquisition in vertebrates is the transferrin receptor 
(TfR) mediated endocytotic pathway, which provides cellular entry to the metal 
transporter serum transferrin (Tf). Despite extensive research efforts, complete 
understanding of Tf-TfR interaction mechanism is still lacking owing to the 
complexity of this system. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) is 
used in this study to monitor the protein/receptor interaction and demonstrate 
the ability of metal-free Tf to associate with TfR at neutral pH. A set of Tf 
variants is used in a series of competition and displacement experiments to 
bracket TfR affinity of apo-Tf at neutral pH (0.2-0.6 microM). Consistent with 
current models of endosomal iron release from Tf, acidification of the protein 
solution results in a dramatic change of binding preferences, with apo-Tf 
becoming a preferred receptor binder. Contrary to the current models implying 
that the apo-Tf/TfR complex dissociates almost immediately upon exposure to the 
neutral environment at the cell surface, our data indicate that this complex 
remains intact. Iron-loaded Tf displaces apo-Tf from TfR, making it available 
for the next cycle of iron binding, transport and delivery to tissues. However, 
apo-Tf may still interfere with the cellular uptake of engineered Tf molecules 
whose TfR affinity is affected by various modifications (e.g., conjugation to 
cytotoxic molecules). This work also highlights the great potential of ESI MS as 
a tool capable of providing precise details of complex protein-receptor 
interactions under conditions that closely mimic the environment in which these 
encounters occur in physiological systems.

Abstract

The primary route of iron acquisition in vertebrates is the transferrin receptor (TfR) mediated endocytotic pathway, which provides cellular entry to the metal transporter serum transferrin (Tf). Despite extensive research efforts, complete understanding of Tf-TfR interaction mechanism is still lacking owing to the complexity of this system.

A set of Tf variants is used in a series of competition and displacement experiments to bracket TfR affinity of apo-Tf at neutral pH (0.2–0.6 μM). Consistent with current models of endosomal iron release from Tf, acidification of the protein solution results in a dramatic change of binding preferences, with apo-Tf becoming a preferred receptor binder. Contrary to the current models implying that the apo-Tf/TfR complex dissociates almost immediately upon exposure to the neutral environment at the cell surface, our data indicate that this complex remains intact.

Discussion

It is well established that the iron status of h Tf is a major determinant of its interaction with TfR both at the cell surface and in the endosome. The results of earlier cell binding assays suggested that iron removal from h Tf results in a dramatic reduction of its receptor affinity ( 6 – 9 ), while the results of more recent biophysical studies were consistent with a complete loss of the receptor-binding competence for the apo- h Tf under conditions mimicking the extra cellular environment ( 11 – 14 ). ESI MS provides conclusive evidence that a Tf has the ability to form relatively stable complexes with TfR at neutral and mildly basic pH. The observed a Tf/TfR complexes have the same stoichiometry as the complexes formed by Fe 2 Tf ( Fig. 1 ). Specificity of the aTf/TfR association at neutral pH is confirmed not only by demonstrating the inability of other ubiquitous serum proteins such as HSA to bind TfR under similar conditions ( Fig. 1 D ), but also by the fact that associations of a Tf and Fe 2 Tf to each monomeric unit of TfR are mutually exclusive. Indeed, when Fe 2 Tf is present in solution at levels insufficient for complete TfR saturation, a Tf binds to the receptor only by filling the vacancies left by Fe 2 Tf ( Fig. 2 ). Once the Fe 2 Tf/TfR molar ratio exceeds 2∶1 (complete receptor saturation), no association between a Tf and TfR is observed, consistent with the notion of either identical or significantly overlapping binding interfaces in Fe 2 Tf/TfR and a Tf/TfR complexes.

The specificity of the a Tf/TfR interaction provides a unique opportunity to evaluate it in a semiquantitative fashion by ranking it among other TfR binders. Competition experiments ( Fig. 3 ) provide clear evidence that iron status of h Tf does determine the rank of its receptor affinity: Fe 2 Tf≫Fe N Tf ≈ Fe C Tf > a Tf, effectively placing an upper limit on TfR affinity of a Tf at neutral pH as 0.2 μM ( 9 ). At the same time, the ability of a Tf to displace b Tf from TfR ( Fig. 6 ) indicates that the 0.6 μM affinity of b Tf to human receptor ( 9 ) can be used as a lower limit of the a Tf/TfR binding strength. Importantly, this bracketing approach may be used to evaluate receptor affinity for any Tf-related protein, including covalent Tf-cytotoxin conjugates and chimeric proteins.

Specific binding of a Tf to TfR at mildly basic (near-physiological) pH with modest, but measurable (sub-μM) affinity is rather surprising, since Tf conformation was suggested as the major factor enabling its recognition by the receptor ( 12 , 13 , 22 , 23 ). Iron dissociation from Tf triggers large-scale conformational changes in each of its lobes, which may interfere with the ability of this protein to make contacts with key TfR residues in the binding interface. Recent analysis of the low-resolution structure of the Tf/TfR complex suggests that only conformational changes triggered by iron removal from the N-lobe may be restricted by h Tf binding to TfR ( 22 ). We note that despite the existence of two distinct conformations (open in the iron-free protein and closed in the holo-form), Tf molecules are highly dynamic in solution, and may sample both open and closed states in the absence of iron ( 24 ).

The existence of a fine balance between open and closed conformations of Tf in the absence of iron, with very little energy difference between them, would allow the protein to sample both states frequently, as long as they are separated by a small activation energy barrier ( 24 ). Therefore, a Tf may transiently populate the conformation required for TfR recognition at neutral pH. Binding to TfR may further increase the Boltzmann weight of the “noncanonical” closed conformation of a Tf, although it apparently fails to lock a Tf in this TfR-favored conformation, as evidenced by the ease of displacing a Tf from TfR with Fe 2 Tf ( Fig. 5 ). Interestingly, recent attempts to obtain a structure of apo- h Tf bound to the receptor using electron microscopy produced electron density maps, whose resolution could not be improved beyond 16 Å ( 23 ), attributed to the significant structural variability of iron-free h Tf.

The canonical (open) conformation of apo- h Tf is stabilized by the TfR in the mildly acidic endosomal environment, a phenomenon which is often viewed as an indirect facilitator of endosomal iron release from Tf ( 13 ). The dramatic reversal of the TfR affinities of a Tf and Fe 2 Tf is indeed evident upon mild acidification of the a Tf/Fe 2 Tf/TfR mixture ( Fig. 4 ). The molecules of a Tf present in solution at mildly basic pH displace Fe 2 Tf from TfR, although the Fe 2 Tf/TfR binding is not completely eliminated under these conditions. Indeed, in a similar experiment carried out in the absence of a Tf, Fe 2 Tf molecules remained bound to TfR for at least half an hour and their iron status was not changed based on the inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurements. The low-resolution electron density maps of the apo- h Tf/TfR complex crystallized at endosomal pH suggested the preference of TfR-bound apo- h Tf to adopt an open conformation ( 23 ). Recently, evidence was presented that the preferred recognition of the open conformation of Tf by TfR at endosomal pH is a result of acid-triggered conformational transition in the remote regions of the receptor, which are then transmitted to the binding site ( 13 ). The ability of Fe 2 Tf to interact with the TfR under these conditions (e.g., by filling the vacancies left by a Tf) should not be surprising, and its explanation is also likely to invoke the notion of noncanonical conformations.

The ability of the holo-protein to sample a noncanonical open conformation at endosomal pH was postulated a long time ago based on the results of an ESI MS study of iron dissociation from the N-lobe of h Tf under mildly acidic conditions ( 25 ), and the existence of this state was recently confirmed by hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange measurements ( 26 ). It appears that the receptor alone cannot trigger iron dissociation from Fe 2 Tf under endosomal conditions, and additional (still unidentified) players must be considered in order to achieve full understanding of the iron release process. Additional stabilization of the noncanonical open conformation of Fe 2 Tf by TfR may nonetheless be a critical component of this process, as it should enhance the access of organic chelators and/or other metalloproteins, such as ferrireductase, to the iron-binding sites of Tf ( 22 ).

Whatever the specific mechanism for iron removal from h Tf in the endosomal environment is, apo- h Tf is likely to be recycled back to the cell surface in the TfR-bound form. On average, each TfR molecule spends less than 3 min on the cell surface before being internalized again ( 27 ). Although the commonly accepted model of iron delivery to tissues implies that the apo- h Tf/TfR complex dissociation occurs within seconds upon its exposure to the neutral environment at the cell surface ( 28 ), our data indicate that the protein may remain bound to TfR for extended periods of time ( vide supra ). However, this does not interfere with the iron delivery process, since the iron-loaded h Tf molecules displace iron-free Tf from the receptor ( Fig. 5 ). Such displaced apo-Tf molecules would contribute to the circulating pool of metal-free transporters available for the next cycle of intestinal iron binding, transport, and delivery to tissues needing this metal.

While the ability of apo- h Tf to remain bound to TfR at near-physiological pH does not interfere with the normal iron delivery cycle, its modest receptor affinity may nonetheless be sufficient to pose a challenge for cellular entry for other forms of Tf molecules whose binding to TfR is less efficient than that of the wild-type h Tf. Indeed, our studies provide strong evidence that a Tf is perfectly capable of displacing Tf molecules of nonhuman origin from TfR regardless of their iron status ( Fig. 6 ). Recently, Tf has emerged as an attractive delivery vehicle for cytotoxic agents that target cells with elevated demand for iron, e.g., those in neoplastic tissues ( 4 ). The underlying assumption in designing these therapeutic strategies utilizing Tf as a delivery vector is that the conjugated form of Tf should retain its ability to enter the cell as long as the receptor recognition is not abolished by the protein modification. The results of our study suggest that this assumption may be too optimistic, as the efficient cellular entry may not only require the ability to bind to a free receptor at the cell surface, but also to displace iron-free h Tf molecules from the receptor. This challenge is multiplied due to the vast amounts of h Tf in the blood ( ca . 35 μM), against which the modified forms of transferrin would have to compete. Therefore, minimizing the influence of Tf conjugation on its receptor affinity must become a critical part in the design of efficient antitumor therapies.
