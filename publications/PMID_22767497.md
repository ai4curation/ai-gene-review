Abstract

Human peripheral Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are activated by phosphorylated metabolites (phosphoagonists [PAg]) of the mammalian mevalonate or the microbial desoxyxylulose-phosphate pathways accumulated by infected or metabolically distressed cells. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. We show that treatment of nonsusceptible target cells with antibody 20.1 against CD277, a member of the extended B7 superfamily related to butyrophilin, mimics PAg-induced Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation and that the Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell receptor is implicated in this effect. Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation can be abrogated by exposing susceptible cells (tumor and mycobacteria-infected cells, or aminobisphosphonate-treated cells with up-regulated PAg levels) to antibody 103.2 against CD277. CD277 knockdown and domain-shuffling approaches confirm the key implication of the CD277 isoform BTN3A1 in PAg sensing by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments support a causal link between intracellular PAg accumulation, decreased BTN3A1 membrane mobility, and ensuing Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation. This study demonstrates a novel role played by B7-like molecules in human γδ T-cell antigenic activation and paves the way for new strategies to improve the efficiency of immunotherapies using Vγ9Vδ2 T cells.

Introduction

γδ T cells are key players in the immune surveillance of cellular distress, thanks to their ability to recognize conserved determinants up-regulated after inflammation, infection, or cell transformation. 1 , 2 Although γδ T-cell receptors (TCRs) contribute to detection of danger-associated determinants, ligands for these receptors have been identified in a few cases only. 3 Thus, the antigenic specificity of γδ T cells and their fine activation modalities in response to cell stress remain largely unknown.

One of the best studied γδ T-cell subsets in humans expresses Vγ9Vδ2 TCR and predominates in blood, composing several percent of the whole peripheral lymphoid pool in most adults. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are activated by nonpeptidic phosphorylated isoprenoid pathway metabolites, 4 - 6 hereafter referred to as phosphoagonists (PAg). Natural Vγ9Vδ2-stimulating PAg include isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), 7 a metabolite of the mevalonate pathway found in mammalian cells and the desoxyxylulose phosphate pathway shared by many microorganisms, and hydroxy-methyl-butyl-pyrophosphate, 8 an intermediate of the latter pathway. PAg detection by γδ T cells underlies their broad reactivity toward infected and transformed cells. Indeed, tumor cell recognition by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells is linked to enhanced production of the weak agonist IPP, resulting from increased cell metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway that up-regulate (eg, aminobisphosphonates, NBP) or down-regulate (eg, statins) IPP production, respectively, increase or decrease antitumor Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses. 9 , 10 Moreover, because of the high Vγ9Vδ2 T cell-stimulating activity of the microbial agonist hydroxy-methyl-butyl-pyrophosphate, Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses are elicited by infected cells producing even traces of this PAg. 8

Although PAg-induced activation is restricted to Vγ9Vδ2 T cells and can be conferred by Vγ9Vδ2 TCR gene transfer, 11 , 12 attempts to detect cognate interactions between PAg and Vγ9Vδ2 TCR have failed so far. 13 So how Vγ9Vδ2 T cells sense PAg remains an enigma. PAg rapidly induce Ca 2+ signaling and activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell clones, but this requires cell-to-cell contact, suggesting the implication of additional target cell surface receptors in this phenomenon. 11 , 14 PAg elicit Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses against basically all human cells, irrespective of their tissue origin, but do not induce recognition of any murine target cells. Therefore, the putative target cell receptors involved in PAg-mediated T-cell activation are expected to be broadly expressed by human, but not murine, cells.

Activation of antigen-stimulated T cells is tuned by interactions involving T cell-derived CD28-related receptors and target cell-derived B7-related counter-receptors, 15 which family includes members, such as Skint and butyrophilin (BTN) receptors. The mandatory role played by Skint-1 in the intrathymic positive selection and functional maturation of the murine intraepidermal Vγ5Vδ1 T-cell subset raises questions about the general role played by Skint1-related receptors in the selection and activation of γδ T cells in mice and other species. 16 - 19 Although there are 10 intact skint1 paralogs in the mouse, the only human skint1 ortholog is a pseudogene. The human proteins with the greatest similarity to the extracellular domain of murine Skint-1 are the BTNs. BTNs are type I membrane proteins with 2 extracellular Ig domains frequently linked to an intracellular B30.2 (PRY/SPRY) domain, and encompass 3 gene subfamilies in humans: btn1 , btn2 , and btn3 . Some BTN receptors exert nonimmunologic functions (eg, milk fat globule formation for BTN1A1). Others, in line with their homology with several B7-related coinhibitory receptors, can up- or down-modulate TCR-induced T-cell activation and contribute to dampening of inflammatory responses. 17 , 20 , 21 This can result from either direct engagement of BTN receptors expressed on responding T cells by target cell ligands, or interactions involving target cell BTN molecules and responding T cell-derived ligands. 22 - 25

In this study, we provide evidence that ubiquitous human CD277/BTN3A plays a key role in PAg-induced activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in both tumor and infectious contexts and that CD277-dependent activation is conferred by Vγ9Vδ2 TCR. Our results suggest that intracellular PAg accumulation is associated with membrane reorganization of CD277 molecules, which in turn leads to Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation, and bring new insights into the mechanisms linking metabolic and infectious distress and human γδ T-cell activation. We also describe agonist and blocking CD277-specific antibodies that could be used for the immunotherapeutic modulation of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses toward tumor or infected cells.

Discussion

Sensing of microbial and mammalian PAg is an elegant strategy for immune detection of infectious and metabolic distress exploited by a major γδ T-cell subset shared by primates but absent in other species. 2 , 4 - 5 Although expression of Vγ9Vδ2 TCR has been known for years to be a prerequisite for PAg-induced activation, 12 , 39 how such small nonpeptidic metabolites promote γδ TCR engagement has remained a mystery. Our results identifying a key role for CD277, a recently identified member of the extended B7 receptor family, yield new insights into this mechanism. The key implication of the ubiquitous CD277 molecule in γδ T-cell activation is consistent with the lack of tissue restriction of NBP- and PAg-induced γδ T-cell responses. 11 Moreover, the lack of functional CD277 orthologs in rodents goes hand in hand with the absence of PAg-responding γδ T-cell subsets in these species, 2 and the lack of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell reactivity toward NBP- or PAg-treated murine cell lines. 5 , 11

How do the effects of anti-CD277 mAb on Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation fit in with the recently reported modulation of αβ T-cell responses by several CD277-specific mAbs? In agreement with previous studies, 23 , 25 soluble 20.1 mAb had neither stimulatory nor costimulatory activity on αβ T cells. Costimulatory activity of mAb 20.1 on TCR-stimulated αβ T cells has been reported with plate-bound mAb only and is the consequence of direct engagement of CD277 expressed by responder T cells. 25 In marked contrast, soluble, but not immobilized, mAb 20.1 induced full activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in the absence of any other stimuli (eg, anti-CD3 mAb) and acted primarily, if not exclusively, in an indirect manner (ie, through sensitization of CD277 + target cells to Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell recognition. Yamashiro et al also described inhibition of anti-CD3–stimulated αβ T cells by a high-affinity anti-CD277 mAb able to induce CD277 phosphorylation in T cells. 23 This again suggests a direct coinhibitory effect of the mAb. Although we could not assess activity of this particular mAb on Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses, its mode of action clearly differs from that of the blocking mAb 103.2 we used. In particular, mAb 103.2 inhibited PAg-induced Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses, but not anti-CD3–stimulated Vγ9Vδ2 or αβ T cells, and acted indirectly, by interfering with Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell recognition of NBP-treated or BCG-infected target cells (as indicated by mAb preincubation experiments and analysis of the responses of murine Vγ9Vδ2 TCR transductants).

Results of anti-CD277 mAb treatments and CD277-knockdown approaches both point to a unique role played by CD277 in PAg-induced Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses. Moreover, the effects of both agonist and blocking anti-CD277 mAbs on Vγ9Vδ2 TCR transductant responses indicate that the TCR is necessary for this CD277-dependent activation process. How CD277, PAg, and the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR are linked together remains nevertheless unclear. The CD277-dependent recognition of PAg-treated human cells by murine Vγ9Vδ2 TCR transductants argues against engagement of CD277 by a counter-receptor expressed by responder T cells. Indeed, because CD277 is not conserved in the mouse, 21 existence of a murine counter-receptor seems unlikely.

Interestingly, whereas Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation by agonist anti-CD277 mAbs was restored after re-expression of any of the 3 CD277 isoforms, responses to PAg or NBP were obtained after re-expression of BTN3A1 only. This suggests that PAg are not bona fide γδ T-cell antigens, consistent with previous failures to demonstrate interactions between PAg and Vγ9Vδ2 TCR. 13 We propose that PAg act through the intracytoplasmic domain of the BTN3A1 isoform to induce membrane reorganization of CD277 complexes sensed directly or indirectly by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Because of the high conservation of the extracellular domain of all 3 CD277 isoforms, such Vγ9Vδ2-stimulatory CD277 complexes could be mimicked by agonist anti-CD277 mAbs, irrespective of the isoform expressed. This model (supplemental Figure 8) is supported by the similar Ca 2+ signaling kinetics of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells stimulated by agonist anti-CD277 mAb and PAg as well as by the results of FRAP experiments. Both agonist mAb and NBP induce changes of CD277 membrane mobility that correlate with Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation. Here again, NBP induced topologic rearrangement of only BTN3A1, whereas agonist mAb affected the mobility of both BTN3A1 and BTN3A2 isoforms. This establishes a specific and presumably causal link between intracellular PAg accumulation and CD277 reorganization, which occurs independently of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation. PAg-dependent recruitment of CD277 molecules could be achieved through direct interactions between PAg and the intracellular domain of BTN3A1. Alternatively, in line with the role played by some B30.2 domains in protein/protein interactions, 40 , 41 BTN3A1 recruitment could involve additional intracellular or membrane-bound partners. Although PAg are likely to act intracellularly, we cannot rule out an extracellular mode of action (eg, after interaction with the extracellular part of a transmembrane receptor that would in turn induce BTN3A1 reorganization in a B30.2-dependent fashion). This hypothesis would be in line with evidence for the existence of surface receptors able to interact with PAg. 42 , 43

How Vγ9Vδ2 T cells detect PAg-induced changes of CD277 remains to be determined. These changes could be sensed by the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR directly, although we failed to demonstrate cognate interactions between recombinant Vγ9Vδ2 TCR and CD277 (E.J.A., unpublished results, January 2012), or to restore Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses toward NBP-treated murine target cells after BTN3A1 transduction (C.H., R.B., M.B., and E.S., unpublished results, January 2011). Alternatively, CD277 might promote recruitment of other receptors recognized by the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR, such as ecto-F1-ATPase, which is a known ligand for Vγ9Vδ2 TCR. 44 , 45

The restricted but mandatory implication of CD277 in the activation of particular human γδ T-cell subsets brings to mind the mandatory role played by Skint-1, another member of the extended B7 receptor family, in the selection of murine intraepidermal γδ T cells. 16 - 18 Although Skint-1 deficiency prevents differentiation of T cells expressing invariant Vγ5Vδ1 TCR, it has no effect on other γδ or αβ T-cell compartments. Whether Skint-1 directly interacts with Vγ5Vδ1 TCR or modulates TCR engagement by yet undefined antigens remains unclear. It is striking that the human B7-related molecules, which are most homologous to SKINT1 in their extracellular regions, are the mouse and human BTNs, including CD277. 21 Therefore, the implication of BTN/Skint-related members of the extended B7 receptor family in cell selection and/or peripheral activation could represent a unifying feature shared by seemingly unrelated γδ T-cell subsets from distinct species.

From an applied standpoint, trials using clinical grade 5γ9Vδ2 T-cell agonists (like NBP or synthetic PAg) have yielded promising preclinical and clinical responses in viral infections and several cancers. 2 , 5 , 46 Such protocols are nevertheless suboptimal because of the progressive exhaustion of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses after repeated treatment with specific agonists and because of the rather weak reactivity of in vitro or in vivo expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells toward fresh autologous tumor cells. 5 Enhancing antitumor responses of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells with agonist anti-CD277 mAbs may prove a good way to improve their antitumor efficacy. On the other hand, antagonist anti-CD277 mAbs might be exploited to dampen deleterious Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell responses, 47 for instance, during Mycobacterium tuberculosis –induced immune restoration syndrome in AIDS patients under therapy. 48
