Mutations in SPG11, encoding spatacsin, constitute the major cause of autosomal 
recessive Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) with thinning of the corpus 
callosum. Previous studies showed that spatacsin orchestrates cellular traffic 
events through the formation of a coat-like complex and its loss of function 
results in lysosomal and axonal transport impairments. However, the upstream 
mechanisms that regulate spatacsin trafficking are unknown. Here, using 
proteomics and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tagging of endogenous spatacsin, we 
identified a subset of 14-3-3 proteins as physiological interactors of 
spatacsin. The interaction is modulated by Protein Kinase A (PKA)-dependent 
phosphorylation of spatacsin at Ser1955, which initiates spatacsin trafficking 
from the plasma membrane to the intracellular space. Our study provides novel 
insight in understanding spatacsin physio-pathological roles with mechanistic 
dissection of its associated pathways.
