MDM2 and MDM4 are proteins involved in regulating the tumour suppressor p53. 
MDM2/4 and p53 interact through their N-terminal domains and disrupting this 
interaction is a potential anticancer strategy. The MDM2-p53 interaction is 
structurally and biophysically well characterised, whereas equivalent studies on 
MDM4 are hampered by aggregation of the protein. Here we present the NMR 
characterization of MDM4 (14-111) both free and in complexes with peptide and 
small-molecule ligands. MDM4 is more dynamic in its apo state than is MDM2, with 
parts of the protein being unstructured. These regions become structured upon 
binding of a ligand. MDM4 appears to bind its ligand through conformational 
selection and/or an induced fit mechanism; this might influence rational design 
of MDM4 inhibitors.
