The HP1 proteins regulate epigenetic gene silencing by promoting and maintaining 
chromatin condensation. The HP1 chromodomain binds to methylated histone H3. 
More enigmatic is the chromoshadow domain (CSD), which mediates dimerization, 
transcription repression, and interaction with multiple nuclear proteins. Here 
we show that KAP-1, CAF-1 p150, and NIPBL carry a canonical amino acid motif, 
PxVxL, which binds directly to the CSD with high affinity. We also define a new 
class of variant PxVxL CSD-binding motifs in Sp100A, LBR, and ATRX. Both 
canonical and variant motifs recognize a similar surface of the CSD dimer as 
demonstrated by a panel of CSD mutants. These in vitro binding results were 
confirmed by the analysis of polypeptides found associated with nuclear HP1 
complexes and we provide the first evidence of the NIPBL/delangin protein in 
human cells, a protein recently implicated in the developmental disorder, 
Cornelia de Lange syndrome. NIPBL is related to Nipped-B, a factor participating 
in gene activation by remote enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster. Thus, this 
spectrum of direct binding partners suggests an expanded role for HP1 as factor 
participating in promoter-enhancer communication, chromatin remodeling/assembly, 
and sub-nuclear compartmentalization.
