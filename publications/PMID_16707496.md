Proteins selected for degradation are labeled with multiple molecules of 
ubiquitin and are subsequently cleaved by the 26 S proteasome. A family of 
proteins containing at least one ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and one 
ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain have been shown to act as soluble ubiquitin 
receptors of the 26 S proteasome and introduce a new level of specificity into 
the degradation system. They bind ubiquitylated proteins via their UBA domains 
and the 26 S proteasome via their UBL domain and facilitate the contact between 
substrate and protease. NEDD8 ultimate buster-1 long (NUB1L) belongs to this 
class of proteins and contains one UBL and three UBA domains. We recently 
reported that NUB1L interacts with the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 and 
accelerates its degradation and that of its conjugates. Here we show that a 
deletion mutant of NUB1L lacking the UBL domain is still able to bind FAT10 but 
not the proteasome and no longer accelerates FAT10 degradation. A version of 
NUB1L lacking all three UBA domains, on the other hand, looses the ability to 
bind FAT10 but is still able to interact with the proteasome and accelerates the 
degradation of FAT10. The degradation of a FAT10 mutant containing only the 
C-terminal UBL domain is also still accelerated by NUB1L, even though the two 
proteins do not interact. In addition, we show that FAT10 and either one of its 
UBL domains alone can interact directly with the 26 S proteasome. We propose 
that NUB1L not only acts as a linker between the 26 S proteasome and 
ubiquitin-like proteins, but also as a facilitator of proteasomal degradation.
