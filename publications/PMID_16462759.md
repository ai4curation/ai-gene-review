Oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause cervical cancer in 
humans. The antiapoptotic viral E6 gene has been identified as a key factor for 
maintaining the viability of HPV-positive cancer cells. Although E6 has the 
potential to modulate many apoptosis regulators, the crucial apoptotic pathway 
blocked by endogenous E6 in cervical cancer cells remained unknown. Using RNA 
interference (RNAi), here, we show that targeted inhibition of E6 expression in 
cervical cancer cells leads to the transcriptional stimulation of the PUMA 
promoter, in a p53-dependent manner. This is linked to the activation and 
translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release into 
the cytosol, and activation of caspase-3, in a PUMA-dependent manner. Moreover, 
inhibition of Bax expression by RNAi efficiently reverts the apoptotic 
phenotype, which results from inhibition of E6 expression. Thus, interference 
with the p53/PUMA/Bax cascade is crucial for the antiapoptotic function of the 
viral E6 oncogene in HPV-positive cancer cells.
