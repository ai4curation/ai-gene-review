The plant cell cytosol is a dynamic and complex intracellular matrix that, by 
definition, contains no compartmentalization. Nonetheless, it maintains a wide 
variety of biochemical networks and often links metabolic pathways across 
multiple organelles. There have been numerous detailed proteomic studies of 
organelles in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, although no such analysis 
has been undertaken on the cytosol. The cytosolic protein fraction from cell 
suspensions of Arabidopsis thaliana was isolated and analyzed using offline 
strong cation exchange liquid chromatography and LC-MS/MS. This generated a 
robust set of 1071 cytosolic proteins. Functional annotation of this set 
revealed major activities in protein synthesis and degradation, RNA metabolism 
and basic sugar metabolism. This included an array of important cytosol-related 
functions, specifically the ribosome, the set of tRNA catabolic enzymes, the 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, glycolysis and associated sugar metabolism 
pathways, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, vitamin metabolism, nucleotide 
metabolism, an array of signaling and stress-responsive molecules, and NDP-sugar 
biosynthesis. This set of cytosolic proteins provides for the first time an 
extensive analysis of enzymes responsible for the myriad of reactions in the 
Arabidopsis cytosol and defines an experimental set of plant protein sequences 
that are not targeted to subcellular locations following translation and folding 
in the cytosol.
