To ensure the fidelity of chromosome segregation, the spindle checkpoint blocks 
the ubiquitin ligase activity of APC/C(Cdc20) in response to a single chromatid 
not properly attached to the mitotic spindle. Here we show that HeLa cells 
depleted for Bub1 by RNA interference are defective in checkpoint signaling. 
Bub1 directly phosphorylates Cdc20 in vitro and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase 
activity of APC/C(Cdc20) catalytically. A Cdc20 mutant with all six Bub1 
phosphorylation sites removed is refractory to Bub1-mediated phosphorylation and 
inhibition in vitro. Upon checkpoint activation, Bub1 itself is 
hyperphosphorylated and its kinase activity toward Cdc20 is stimulated. Ectopic 
expression of the nonphosphorylatable Cdc20 mutant allows HeLa cells to escape 
from mitosis in the presence of spindle damage. Therefore, Bub1-mediated 
phosphorylation of Cdc20 is required for proper checkpoint signaling. We 
speculate that inhibition of APC/C(Cdc20) by Bub1 in a catalytic fashion may 
partly account for the exquisite sensitivity of the spindle checkpoint.
