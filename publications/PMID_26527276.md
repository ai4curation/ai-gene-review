Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a key enzyme for glycolysis and catalyzes the 
conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, which supplies cellular 
energy. PKM2 also phosphorylates histone H3 threonine 11 (H3T11); however, it is 
largely unknown how PKM2 links cellular metabolism to chromatin regulation. 
Here, we show that the yeast PKM2 homolog, Pyk1, is a part of a novel protein 
complex named SESAME (Serine-responsive SAM-containing Metabolic Enzyme 
complex), which contains serine metabolic enzymes, SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) 
synthetases, and an acetyl-CoA synthetase. SESAME interacts with the Set1 H3K4 
methyltransferase complex, which requires SAM synthesized from SESAME, and 
recruits SESAME to target genes, resulting in phosphorylation of H3T11. SESAME 
regulates the crosstalk between H3K4 methylation and H3T11 phosphorylation by 
sensing glycolysis and glucose-derived serine metabolism. This leads to 
auto-regulation of PYK1 expression. Thus, our study provides insights into the 
mechanism of regulating gene expression, responding to cellular metabolism via 
chromatin modifications.
