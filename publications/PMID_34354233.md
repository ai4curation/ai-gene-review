The shieldin complex functions as the downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 to 
promote DNA double-strand break end-joining by restricting end resection. The 
SHLD2 subunit binds to single-stranded DNA ends and blocks end resection through 
OB-fold domains. Besides blocking end resection, it is unclear how the shieldin 
complex processes SHLD2-bound single-stranded DNA and promotes non-homologous 
end-joining. Here, we identify a downstream effector of the shieldin complex, 
ASTE1, as a structure-specific DNA endonuclease that specifically cleaves 
single-stranded DNA and 3' overhang DNA. ASTE1 localizes to DNA damage sites in 
a shieldin-dependent manner. Loss of ASTE1 impairs non-homologous end-joining, 
leads to hyper-resection and causes defective immunoglobulin class switch 
recombination. ASTE1 deficiency also causes resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) 
polymerase inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient cells owing to restoration of 
homologous recombination. These findings suggest that ASTE1-mediated 3' 
single-stranded DNA end cleavage contributes to the control of DSB repair choice 
by 53BP1, RIF1 and shieldin.
