Four genes responsible for a position effect on expression from HML and HMR in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Rine J, Herskowitz I.

Mating type interconversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs by transposition 
of copies of the a or alpha mating type cassettes from inactive loci, HML and 
HMR, to an active locus, MAT. The lack of expression of the a and alpha genes at 
the silent loci results from repression by trans-acting regulators encoded by 
SIR (Silent Information Regulator) genes. In this paper we present evidence for 
the existence of four SIR genes. Inactivation of any of these genes leads to 
expression of cassettes at both HML and HMR. Unusual complementation properties 
are observed for a number of sir mutations. Specifically, some recessive 
mutations in different genes fail to complement. The correspondence between 
SIR1, SIR2, SIR3, SIR4 and other genes with similar roles (MAR, CMT, STE8 and 
STE9) is presented.
