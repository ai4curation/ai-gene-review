By an unknown mechanism, β-thymosins are extracellular modulators of 
angiogenesis, inflammation, wound healing, and development. We were interested 
in identifying β-thymosin interactors and determining their importance in 
β-thymosins signaling in human vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We performed 
pulldown experiments with biotinylated thymosin β-4 (Tβ4) in comparison to 
neutravidin beads alone and used mass spectrometric analysis to identify 
differentially interacting proteins. By this method, we identified F1-F0 ATP 
synthase, a known target of antiangiogenic angiostatin. By surface plasmon 
resonance, we determined for Tβ4 binding to the β subunit of ATP synthase a K(D) 
of 12 nM. Blocking antibodies and antagonists (oligomycin, IC(50) ∼1.8 μM; 
piceatannol, IC(50) ∼1.05 μM; and angiostatin, IC(50) ∼2.9 μg/ml) of ATP 
synthase inhibited the Tβ4-induced increase in cell surface ATP levels, as 
measured by luciferase assay, and the Tβ4-induced increase in HUVEC migration, 
as measured by transwell migration assay. Silencing of the ATP-responsive 
purinergic receptor P2X4 with siRNA also blocked Tβ4-induced HUVEC migration in 
a transwell assay. Furthermore, in silico we identified common amphiphilic 
α-helical structural similarities between β-thymosins and the inhibitory factor 
1 (IF1), an inhibitor of ATP synthase hydrolysis. In summary, we have identified 
an extracellular signaling pathway where Tβ4 increases cell surface ATP levels 
via ATP synthase and have shown further that ATP-responsive P2X4 receptor is 
required for Tβ4-induced HUVEC migration.
