CBF1 is a member of the CSL family of DNA binding factors, which mediate either 
transcriptional repression or transcriptional activation. CSL proteins play a 
central role in Notch signaling and in Epstein-Barr virus-induced 
immortalization. Notch is a transmembrane protein involved in cell-fate 
decisions, and the cytoplasmic domain of Notch (NotchIC) targets CBF1. The 
Epstein-Barr virus-immortalizing protein EBNA2 activates both cellular and viral 
gene expression by targeting CBF1 and mimicking NotchIC. We have examined the 
mechanism of CBF1-mediated repression and show that CBF1 binds to a unique 
corepressor, CBF1 interacting corepressor (CIR). A CIR homolog is encoded by 
Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that CIR is evolutionarily conserved. Two 
CBF1 mutants that were unable to bind CIR did not function as repressors, 
suggesting that targeting of CIR to CBF1 is an important component of 
repression. When expressed as a Gal4 fusion protein, CIR repressed reporter gene 
expression. CIR binds to histone deacetylase and to SAP30 and serves as a linker 
between CBF1 and the histone deacetylase complex.
