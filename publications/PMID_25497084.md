The Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1) plays a critical role in tumorigenesis by 
promoting cell proliferation, overriding cell-cycle check points, and enhancing 
genomic instability. In this study, the interactome of YBX1 in renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to 
better understand its function and regulatory mechanism. A total of 129 proteins 
were identified as potential YBX1 binding partners. The interaction between the 
complement component 1, q subcomponent binding protein (C1QBP), and YBX1 was 
further confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Knockdown of 
C1QBP enhanced the phosphorylation of YBX1and its nuclear translocation, 
indicating that C1QBP negatively regulated YBX1 activation. The clinical 
significance of these two proteins was analyzed in the tissues from 52 RCC 
patients by immunohistochemistry. Expression of YBX1 was markedly elevated in 
the carcinoma tissues, and its nuclear expression was associated with 
histological T stage and metastasis. Meanwhile, the level of C1QBP in the 
carcinoma tissues was significantly lower than that in the adjacent healthy 
tissues, which was negatively correlated with the nuclear localization of YBX1 
in the RCC tissues (P = 0.011). These data suggest that C1QBP is a novel 
regulator of YBX1, and the expression of C1QBP and the nuclear expression of 
YBX1 could both be used as independent prognostic makers for cancer progression 
in the RCC patients. The proteomics data have been deposited to the 
ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001493.
