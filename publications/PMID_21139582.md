BACKGROUND: Guanidine exchange factor (GEF)-catalysed activation of Rho proteins 
such as Cdc42 has been shown to have a crucial role in cellular transformation, 
malignant progression and invasion. We have previously shown that the HPV16 E6 
oncoprotein binds to the PDZ domain protein Tax-interacting-protein 1 (Tip-1) 
and we now report identification and functional analysis of a novel Tip-1 
binding GEF.
METHODS: Yeast two-hybrid, in vitro pull-down, site-directed mutagenesis, 
semiquantitative PCR, co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting were used to 
identify/confirm novel Tip-1 binding partners and analyse cellular expression 
levels. In vitro kinetic analyses of recombinant proteins, siRNA gene silencing 
and in cell assays were used to measure Rho protein activation.
RESULTS: Tax-interacting-protein 1 was shown to interact with ARHGEF16 by its 
carboxyl PDZ binding motif. Levels of ARHGEF16 were increased in transformed and 
immortalised cells expressing ectopic HPV16 E6 and Cdc42 was 
co-immunoprecipitated by ARHGEF16 in the presence of high-risk HPV E6. In vitro 
kinetic analysis confirmed that recombinant ARHGEF16 activates Cdc42 and this 
was increased by the addition of recombinant Tip-1 and E6. Cells expressing 
HPV16 E6 had higher levels of Cdc42 activation, which was decreased by siRNA 
silencing of either Tip-1 or ARHGEF16.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that HPV16 E6, Tip-1 and ARHGEF16 may cooperate 
to activate Cdc42 and support a potential link between the expression of HPV16 
E6 and Cdc42 activation.
