BACKGROUND: Although inflammation plays an important role in the development of 
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), little is known about the exact mechanism 
underlying this pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the relationship between the 
inflammatory reaction and BPH.
METHODS: cDNA microarray analysis was used to identify changes in 
inflammation-related gene expression in a recently established rat model that 
mimics human BPH. To investigate the genes identified in the analysis, 
quantitative (q)RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunostaining, and a cell 
proliferation assay were conducted using BPH model tissues, human prostate 
tissues, and normal human prostate cultured cells.
RESULTS: Of the 31,100 genes identified in the cDNA analysis, seven 
inflammatory-response-related genes were expressed at a >2-fold higher level in 
rat BPH tissues than in normal rat prostate tissues. The levels of the most 
commonly expressed pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-18, significantly increased in 
rat BPH tissues. In humans, IL-18 was localized in the epithelial and stromal 
components, while its receptor was strongly localized in smooth muscle cells. 
Furthermore, in human prostate smooth muscle cell line (PrSMC), IL-18 effected 
dose-dependent increases in the phosphorylated Akt and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) 
levels. TSP-1 promoted proliferation of the human prostate stromal cells (PrSC).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-18 may act directly in BPH pathogenesis by inducing TSP-1 
production in prostatic smooth muscle cells via Akt phosphorylation.
