The primary cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), the most frequent fatal genetic 
disease in Caucasians, is deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del), 
located in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the CF transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. F508del-CFTR is recognized by the 
endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC), which targets it for proteasomal 
degradation, preventing this misfolded but partially functional Cl(-) channel 
from reaching the cell membrane. We recently proposed that the ERQC proceeds 
along several checkpoints, the first of which, utilizing the chaperone heat 
shock cognate 70 (Hsc70), is the major one directing F508del-CFTR for 
proteolysis. Therefore, a detailed characterization of the interaction occurring 
between F508del-CFTR and Hsc70 is critical to clarify the mechanism that senses 
misfolded F508del-CFTR in vivo. Here, we determined by surface plasmon resonance 
that: (a) F508del-murine (m)NBD1 binds Hsc70 with higher affinity (K(D), 2.6 nm) 
than wild-type (wt) mNBD1 (13.9 nm); (b) ATP and ADP dramatically reduce 
NBD1-Hsc70 binding; (c) the F508del mutation increases by approximately six-fold 
the ATP concentration required to inhibit the NBD1-Hsc70 interaction (IC(50); 
wt-mNBD1, 19.7 microm ATP); and (d) the small molecule CFTR corrector 4a (C4a), 
but not VRT-325 (V325; both rescuing F508del-CFTR traffic), significantly 
reduces F508del-mNBD1 binding to Hsc70, by approximately 30%. Altogether, these 
results provide a novel, robust quantitative characterization of Hsc70-NBD1 
binding, bringing detailed insights into the molecular basis of CF. Moreover, we 
show how this surface plasmon resonance assay helps to elucidate the mechanism 
of action of small corrective molecules, demonstrating its potential to validate 
additional therapeutic compounds for CF.
