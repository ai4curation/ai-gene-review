## Abstract

1. Genes Dev. 2002 Jun 1;16(11):1371-82. doi: 10.1101/gad.971402.

Phosphorylation of the mitotic regulator Pds1/securin by Cdc28 is required for 
efficient nuclear localization of Esp1/separase.

Sister chromatid separation at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition is induced 
by the proteolytic cleavage of one of the cohesin complex subunits. This process 
is mediated by a conserved protease called separase. Separase is associated with 
its inhibitor, securin, until the time of anaphase initiation, when securin is 
degraded in an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-dependent manner. In 
budding yeast securin/Pds1 not only inhibits separase/Esp1, but also promotes 
its nuclear localization. The molecular mechanism and regulation of this nuclear 
targeting are presently unknown. Here we show that Pds1 is a substrate of the 
cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. Phosphorylation of Pds1 by Cdc28 is important for 
efficient binding of Pds1 to Esp1 and for promoting the nuclear localization of 
Esp1. Our results uncover a previously unknown mechanism for regulating the 
Pds1-Esp1 interaction and shed light on a novel role for Cdc28 in promoting the 
metaphase-to-anaphase transition in budding yeast.
