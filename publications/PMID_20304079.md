The effects of apple intake on the fecal flora, water content, pH, and metabolic 
activities in eight healthy volunteers and the utilization of apple pectin in 
vitro were investigated. Although several isolates of Bifidobacterium, 
Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and the Bacteroides fragilis group utilized apple 
pectin, most isolates of Escherichia coli, Collinsela aerofaciense, Eubacterium 
limosum, and Clostridium perfringens could not. When fecal samples from healthy 
adults were incubated in liquid broth with apple pectin present or absent, the 
numbers of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the former were higher than 
those in the later. After the intake of apples (2 apples a day for 2 weeks) by 
eight healthy adult humans, the number of bifidobacteria in feces increased 
(p < 0.05 on day 7 and p < 0.01 on day 14 of the intake period), and the numbers 
of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus including Enterococcus tended to increase. 
However, lecithinase-positive clostridia, including C. perfringens, decreased 
(p < 0.05), and Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas tended to decrease. Moreover, 
the concentrations of fecal acetic acid tended to increase on apple intake. The 
fecal ammonia concentration showed a tendency to reduce and fecal sulfide 
decreased (p < 0.05) on apple intake. These findings indicate that apple 
consumption is related to an improved intestinal environment, and apple pectin 
is one of the effective apple components improving the fecal environment.
