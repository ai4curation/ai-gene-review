Synapse deterioration underlying severe memory loss in early Alzheimer's disease

Mechanistically, soluble Abeta oligomers, also referred to as Abeta-derived 
diffusible ligands (ADDLs), act as highly specific pathogenic ligands, binding

critical to plasticity and memory. We report here the existence of a protective

Synapse pathology was investigated in mature cultures of hippocampal neurons. 
Before spine loss, ADDLs caused major downregulation of plasma membrane insulin 
receptors (IRs), via a mechanism sensitive to calcium calmodulin-dependent 
kinase II (CaMKII) and casein kinase II (CK2) inhibition. Most significantly, 
this loss of surface IRs, and ADDL-induced oxidative stress and synaptic spine 
deterioration, could be completely prevented by insulin. At submaximal insulin 
doses, protection was potentiated by rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing drug 
used to treat type 2 diabetes. The mechanism of insulin protection entailed a 
marked reduction in pathogenic ADDL binding. Surprisingly, insulin failed to 
block ADDL binding when IR tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited; in fact, a 
significant increase in binding was caused by IR inhibition. The protective role 
of insulin thus derives from IR signaling-dependent downregulation of ADDL 
binding sites rather than ligand competition. The finding that synapse 
vulnerability to ADDLs can be mitigated by insulin suggests that bolstering 
brain insulin signaling, which can decline with aging and diabetes, could have 
significant potential to slow or deter AD pathogenesis.

Abstract

Synapse deterioration underlying severe memory loss in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be caused by soluble amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers. Mechanistically, soluble Aβ oligomers, also referred to as Aβ-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), act as highly specific pathogenic ligands, binding to sites localized at particular synapses. This binding triggers oxidative stress, loss of synaptic spines, and ectopic redistribution of receptors critical to plasticity and memory. We report here the existence of a protective mechanism that naturally shields synapses against ADDL-induced deterioration. Synapse pathology was investigated in mature cultures of hippocampal neurons. Before spine loss, ADDLs caused major downregulation of plasma membrane insulin receptors (IRs), via a mechanism sensitive to calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and casein kinase II (CK2) inhibition. Most significantly, this loss of surface IRs, and ADDL-induced oxidative stress and synaptic spine deterioration, could be completely prevented by insulin. At submaximal insulin doses, protection was potentiated by rosiglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing drug used to treat type 2 diabetes. The mechanism of insulin protection entailed a marked reduction in pathogenic ADDL binding. Surprisingly, insulin failed to block ADDL binding when IR tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited; in fact, a significant increase in binding was caused by IR inhibition. The protective role of insulin thus derives from IR signaling-dependent downregulation of ADDL binding sites rather than ligand competition. The finding that synapse vulnerability to ADDLs can be mitigated by insulin suggests that bolstering brain insulin signaling, which can decline with aging and diabetes, could have significant potential to slow or deter AD pathogenesis.

Discussion

We have identified a unique molecular mechanism that protects CNS neurons against ADDLs, soluble neurotoxins putatively responsible for the synaptic deterioration underlying Alzheimer's memory failure. ADDLs are known to initiate deterioration by acting as highly specific pathogenic ligands. We have found that ADDL binding to particular synaptic sites and the resulting neuronal oxidative stress, IR downregulation, and synapse loss are markedly decreased by the presence of insulin. Interestingly, neuroprotection by insulin requires IR activity. Thus the mechanism of protection does not involve simple competition between ADDLs and insulin for a common binding site on the neuronal surface, but rather is a signaling-dependent downregulation of ADDL binding sites. The insulin-sensitizing drug rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, potentiated the ability of insulin to protect synapses against ADDLs. Results strongly support the hypothesis that insulin signaling plays a role in defending CNS neurons against AD and provide a disease-specific basis for treatments based on stimulating CNS insulin pathways.

Although the brain once was considered insulin insensitive, it is now known that CNS insulin signaling is important for many aspects of neuronal function, including plasticity and memory formation ( 26 , 27 , 47 ). Recently, human subjects have been found to respond to CNS insulin signaling stimulation with enhanced verbal memory performance ( 40 ). When given to subjects with early AD, intranasal insulin also improves performance ( 30 ) but only at higher doses, suggesting involvement of additional mechanisms other than stimulation of plasticity. Results here support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of insulin in AD derives at least in part from an acute decrease in ADDL synaptotoxicity. In harmony with this possibility, it recently was shown that insulin ameliorates Aβ oligomer-induced inhibition of LTP ( 41 , 42 ), a standard paradigm for plasticity and memory mechanisms. Long-term CNS insulin stimulation potentially could increase cognitive benefits to AD patients further by reducing ADDL-induced neuronal deterioration. Insulin, besides decreasing ADDL binding, ADDL-induced spine degeneration, oxidative stress, and insulin receptor loss (as shown here), also protects against accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau ( 48 ), a pathological hallmark of AD that is induced by ADDLs ( 15 ).

The marked decrease in ADDL binding caused by insulin ostensibly could be a simple competitive interaction at the cell surface, which would be consistent with coimmunoprecipitation data ( 9 , 41 ). However, this mechanism is not supported by the current experiments using AG1024, an inhibitor of IR PTK. When receptor activity is blocked, insulin no longer prevents ADDL binding. Furthermore, we note that addition of rosiglitazone markedly enhanced the ability of submaximal insulin to block ADDL binding ( Fig. 3 E–J ). These findings indicate that the mechanism of protection involves insulin signaling-dependent downregulation of ADDL binding sites from the neuronal surface. Future identification of proteins lost from the membrane in response to insulin could provide insight into the nature of the ADDL binding sites, which have yet to be determined.

It is intriguing that insulin and ADDLs have reciprocal effects on their neuronal binding sites. Insulin signaling downregulates ADDL binding, while ADDLs downregulate IRs. Given that insulin protects neurons against AD-causing neurotoxins, it follows that dysfunctional CNS insulin signaling would be an AD risk factor. In fact, brain insulin signaling declines with age ( 36 ), the primary risk factor for AD. An elevated risk for AD also exists in type 2 diabetes patients, who manifest deficient CNS insulin signaling. This deficiency is likely a consequence of decreased insulin uptake into the brain following sustained peripheral hyperinsulinemia ( 31 ). Experimentally induced diabetes moreover causes AD mice models to exhibit accelerated cognitive failure ( 32 , 33 ). Significantly, the marked loss of IRs from synaptic plasma membranes seen in response to ADDLs ( 9 ) has been confirmed in neuropathology studies showing that IRs are lost from dendrites in AD brain ( 49 ).

Recent clinical trials indicate that insulin-sensitizing drugs such as rosiglitazone improve cognition and memory in both AD and type 2 diabetes patients ( 28 , 43 , 50 , 51 ). The basis for the cognitive benefits of rosiglitazone has not been established, although reductions in inflammation and amyloid plaque burden have been hypothesized. However, rosiglitazone attenuates deficits in learning and memory in AD animal models without affecting amyloid deposition ( 29 ). A plausible mechanism of protection is provided by the current finding that rosiglitazone potentiates the ability of insulin to protect synapses against ADDLs. This effect is particularly salient given the relevance of synaptotoxic Aβ oligomers to AD memory impairment ( 7 , 8 ). Overall, an appealing strategy to protect synaptic memory mechanisms would be to increase the inherent synaptic defense against ADDLs while, in tandem, reducing ADDL abundance. Improved insulin-signaling sensitizing drugs may serve the first function, while therapeutic antibodies may serve the latter, as suggested by promising results from recent clinical trials ( 25 ).
