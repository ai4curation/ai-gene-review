TM4SF20 (transmembrane 4 L6 family 20) is a polytopic membrane protein that 
inhibits proteolytic processing of CREB3L1 (cAMP response element-binding 
protein 3-like 1), a membrane-bound transcription factor that blocks cell 
division and activates collagen synthesis. Here we report that ceramide 
stimulates CREB3L1 cleavage by inverting the orientation of TM4SF20 in 
membranes. In the absence of ceramide, the N terminus of the first transmembrane 
helix of TM4SF20 is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. This 
translocation requires TRAM2 (translocating chain-associated membrane protein 
2), a membrane protein containing a putative ceramide-interacting domain. In the 
presence of ceramide, the N terminus of the first transmembrane domain of 
TM4SF20 is exposed to cytosol. Consequently, the membrane topology of TM4SF20 
is inverted, and this form of TM4SF20 stimulates CREB3L1 cleavage. In the 
presence of ceramide, translocation of TM4SF20 is TRAM2-independent. We 
designate this mechanism-causing regulated inversion of the membrane topology as 
"regulated alternative translocation."
