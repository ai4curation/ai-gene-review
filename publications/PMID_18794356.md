Identifying direct substrates of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and 
understanding how those substrates are selected is central to understanding how 
these ubiquitously activated enzymes generate diverse biological responses. In 
previous work, we identified several new candidate substrates for the MAPK ERK2 
(extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2), including the nuclear pore complex 
protein Tpr (translocated promoter region). In this report, we identify sites on 
Tpr for ERK2 phosphorylation and binding and demonstrate their functional 
interaction. ERK2 phosphorylation and dimerization are necessary for ERK2-Tpr 
binding, and this occurs through a DEF (docking site for ERK2, FXF) domain on 
Tpr. Surprisingly, the DEF domain and the phosphorylation sites displayed 
positive cooperativity to promote ERK2 binding to Tpr, in contrast to substrates 
where phosphorylation reduces binding. Ectopic expression or depletion of Tpr 
resulted in decreased movement of activated ERK2 from the cytoplasm to the 
nucleus, implying a role for Tpr in ERK2 translocation. Collectively, the data 
provide direct evidence that a component of the nuclear pore complex is a bona 
fide substrate of ERK2 in vivo and that activated ERK2 stably associates with 
this substrate after phosphorylation, where it could play a continuing role in 
nuclear pore function. We propose that Tpr is both a substrate and a scaffold 
for activated ERKs.

Abstract

Identifying direct substrates of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and understanding how those substrates are selected is central to understanding how these ubiquitously activated enzymes generate diverse biological responses. In previous work, we identified several new candidate substrates for the MAPK ERK2 ( e xtracellular signal- r egulated k inase 2), including the nuclear pore complex protein Tpr ( t ranslocated p romoter r egion). In this report, we identify sites on Tpr for ERK2 phosphorylation and binding and demonstrate their functional interaction. ERK2 phosphorylation and dimerization are necessary for ERK2-Tpr binding, and this occurs through a DEF ( d ocking site for E RK2, F XF) domain on Tpr. Surprisingly, the DEF domain and the phosphorylation sites displayed positive cooperativity to promote ERK2 binding to Tpr, in contrast to substrates where phosphorylation reduces binding. Ectopic expression or depletion of Tpr resulted in decreased movement of activated ERK2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, implying a role for Tpr in ERK2 translocation. Collectively, the data provide direct evidence that a component of the nuclear pore complex is a bona fide substrate of ERK2 in vivo and that activated ERK2 stably associates with this substrate after phosphorylation, where it could play a continuing role in nuclear pore function. We propose that Tpr is both a substrate and a scaffold for activated ERKs.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we present evidence that Tpr is a bona fide ERK2 substrate in vivo. We have shown that Tpr is a direct substrate for ERK2 in cell lysates and in vitro, that the sites of in vitro phosphorylation by MAPK are identical to a subset of in vivo phosphorylation sites, and that these specific phosphorylations disappeared after blockade of the MAPK ERK2 pathway. We also show that ERK2 binds to Tpr and have identified both the docking domains on Tpr and the complementary domain on ERK2. We show that phosphorylation of Tpr by ERK stabilizes the interaction between these proteins and that this interaction positions ERK2 for phosphorylation of other substrates. Finally, we provide evidence that the ERK-Tpr interaction regulates nuclear translocation of ERK2. Collectively, the findings develop a picture of activated ERK2 interacting with Tpr to enhance its nuclear uptake and to phosphorylate other proteins that either are transiting through the pore or may be involved in nuclear pore function.
