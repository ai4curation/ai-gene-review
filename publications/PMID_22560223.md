The TOR kinase, which is present in the functionally distinct complexes TORC1 
and TORC2, is essential for growth but associated with disease and aging. 
Elucidation of how TOR influences life span will identify mechanisms of 
fundamental importance in aging and TOR functions. Here we show that when TORC1 
is inhibited genetically in C. elegans, SKN-1/Nrf, and DAF-16/FoxO activate 
protective genes, and increase stress resistance and longevity. SKN-1 also 
upregulates TORC1 pathway gene expression in a feedback loop. Rapamycin triggers 
a similar protective response in C. elegans and mice, but increases worm life 
span dependent upon SKN-1 and not DAF-16, apparently by interfering with TORC2 
along with TORC1. TORC1, TORC2, and insulin/IGF-1-like signaling regulate SKN-1 
activity through different mechanisms. We conclude that modulation of SKN-1/Nrf 
and DAF-16/FoxO may be generally important in the effects of TOR signaling 
in vivo and that these transcription factors mediate an opposing relationship 
between growth signals and longevity.
