BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although early studies show that Mdm2 is the primary E3 
ubiquitin ligase for the p53 tumor suppressor, an increasing amount of data 
suggests that p53 ubiquitination and degradation are more complex than once 
thought. Here, we investigated the role of RNF125, a non-Mdm2 ubiquitin-protein 
ligase, in the regulation of p53.
METHODS AND RESULTS: RNF125 physically interacted with p53 in 
exogenous/endogenous co-immunoprecipitation (IP) and GST-pull down assay, and a 
C72/75A mutation of RNF125 did not interfere with this interaction. Expression 
of RNF125 decreased the level of p53 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas 
knockdown of RNF125 by RNA interference increased the level of p53. As shown by 
Western blotting and ubiquitin assay, RNF125 ubiquitinated p53 and targeted it 
for proteasome degradation. Furthermore, RNF125 repressed p53 functions 
including p53-dependent transactivation and growth inhibition.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that RNF125 negatively regulates p53 function 
through physical interaction and ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation.
