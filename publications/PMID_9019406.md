The Arabidopsis NPR1 gene controls the onset of systemic acquired resistance 
(SAR), a plant immunity, to a broad spectrum of pathogens that is normally 
established after a primary exposure to avirulent pathogens. Mutants with 
defects in NPR1 fail to respond to various SAR-inducing treatments, displaying 
little expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and exhibiting increased 
susceptibility to infections. NPR1 was cloned using a map-based approach and was 
found to encode a novel protein containing ankyrin repeats. The lesion in one 
npr1 mutant allele disrupted the ankyrin consensus sequence, suggesting that 
these repeats are important for NPR1 function. Furthermore, transformation of 
the cloned wild-type NPR1 gene into npr1 mutants not only complemented the 
mutations, restoring the responsiveness to SAR induction with respect to PR-gene 
expression and resistance to infections, but also rendered the transgenic plants 
more resistant to infection by P. syringae in the absence of SAR induction.
