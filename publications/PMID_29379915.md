A concise and efficient protocol to assemble diverse benzothiazole derivatives 
in high yields was provided via copper catalyzed tandem cyclization with 
o-haloanilines, elemental sulfur and terminal alkynes as raw materials. In this 
protocol, C atoms on the C[triple bond, length as m-dash]C triple bond were 
controllably involved in the construction of the benzothiazole framework and 
multiple carbon-heteroatom bonds through divergent routes.
