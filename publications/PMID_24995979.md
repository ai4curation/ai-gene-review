Brown fat can reduce obesity through the dissipation of calories as heat. 
Control of thermogenic gene expression occurs via the induction of various 
coactivators, most notably PGC-1α. In contrast, the transcription factor 
partner(s) of these cofactors are poorly described. Here, we identify interferon 
regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as a dominant transcriptional effector of 
thermogenesis. IRF4 is induced by cold and cAMP in adipocytes and is sufficient 
to promote increased thermogenic gene expression, energy expenditure, and cold 
tolerance. Conversely, knockout of IRF4 in UCP1(+) cells causes reduced 
thermogenic gene expression and energy expenditure, obesity, and cold 
intolerance. IRF4 also induces the expression of PGC-1α and PRDM16 and interacts 
with PGC-1α, driving Ucp1 expression. Finally, cold, β-agonists, or forced 
expression of PGC-1α are unable to cause thermogenic gene expression in the 
absence of IRF4. These studies establish IRF4 as a transcriptional driver of a 
program of thermogenic gene expression and energy expenditure.
