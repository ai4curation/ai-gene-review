The U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) is an essential component of the 
spliceosome, the cellular machine responsible for removing introns from 
precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) in all eukaryotes. U2 is an extraordinarily dynamic 
splicing factor and the most frequently mutated in cancers. Cryo-electron 
microscopy (cryo-EM) has transformed our structural and functional understanding 
of the role of U2 in splicing. In this review, we synthesize these and other 
data with respect to a view of U2 as an assembly of interconnected functional 
modules. These modules are organized by the U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) for 
roles in spliceosome assembly, intron substrate recognition, and protein 
scaffolding. We describe new discoveries regarding the structure of U2 
components and how the snRNP undergoes numerous conformational and compositional 
changes during splicing. We specifically highlight large scale movements of U2 
modules as the spliceosome creates and rearranges its active site. U2 serves as 
a compelling example for how cellular machines can exploit the modular 
organization and structural plasticity of an RNP.
