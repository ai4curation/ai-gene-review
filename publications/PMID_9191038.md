Autophosphorylating histidine kinases are an ancient conserved family of enzymes 
that are found in eubacteria, archaebacteria and eukaryotes. They are activated 
by a wide range of extracellular signals and transfer phosphate moieties to 
aspartates found in response regulators. Recent studies have shown that such 
two-component signal transduction pathways mediate osmoregulation in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium discoideum and Neurospora crassa. 
Moreover, they play pivotal roles in responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to 
ethylene and cytokinin. A transmembrane histidine kinase encoded by dhkA 
accumulates when Dictyostelium cells aggregate during development. Activation of 
DhkA results in the inhibition of its response regulator, RegA, which is a cAMP 
phosphodiesterase that regulates the cAMP dependent protein kinase PKA. When PKA 
is activated late in the differentiation of prespore cells, they encapsulate 
into spores. There is evidence that this two-component system participates in a 
feedback loop linked to PKA in prestalk cells such that the signal to initiate 
encapsulation is rapidly amplified. Such signal transduction pathways can be 
expected to be found in a variety of eukaryotic differentiations since they are 
rapidly reversible and can integrate disparate signals.
