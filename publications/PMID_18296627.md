In Arabidopsis thaliana, the blue light photoreceptor cryptochromes (CRY) act to 
promote photomorphogenic development and the transition from vegetative to 
floral development in long days (LDs). We previously proposed that one of the 
mechanisms by which CRY regulates light responses is via its physical 
interaction with COP1, a RING motif-containing E3 ligase. Under LDs, the 
transcription of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is activated by CONSTANS (CO) in leaf, 
and the FT protein moves to the shoot apex to induce flowering. CO protein is 
degraded in darkness, whereas it is stabilized by the CRY-mediated signal. 
However, the mechanism underlying this process is unknown. We show in this 
report that CO acts genetically downstream of COP1 and CRY to regulate flowering 
time. In addition, COP1 physically interacts with CO and functions as an E3 
ligase, ubiquitinating CO in vitro and reducing CO levels in vivo. These results 
suggest that COP1 acts as a repressor of flowering by promoting the 
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of CO in darkness and that CRY-mediated signal 
may negatively regulate COP1, thereby stabilizing CO, activating FT 
transcription, and inducing flowering.

Abstract

In Arabidopsis thaliana , the blue light photoreceptor cryptochromes (CRY) act to promote photomorphogenic development and the transition from vegetative to floral development in long days (LDs). We previously proposed that one of the mechanisms by which CRY regulates light responses is via its physical interaction with COP1, a RING motif–containing E3 ligase. Under LDs, the transcription of FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) is activated by CONSTANS (CO) in leaf, and the FT protein moves to the shoot apex to induce flowering. CO protein is degraded in darkness, whereas it is stabilized by the CRY-mediated signal. However, the mechanism underlying this process is unknown. We show in this report that CO acts genetically downstream of COP1 and CRY to regulate flowering time. In addition, COP1 physically interacts with CO and functions as an E3 ligase, ubiquitinating CO in vitro and reducing CO levels in vivo. These results suggest that COP1 acts as a repressor of flowering by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of CO in darkness and that CRY-mediated signal may negatively regulate COP1, thereby stabilizing CO, activating FT transcription, and inducing flowering.

INTRODUCTION

In many plants, the transition from vegetative to reproductive development is controlled by the daily duration of light and/or darkness (i.e., the photoperiod). In Arabidopsis thaliana , long days (LDs) accelerate flowering, whereas short days (SDs) delay flowering, and these processes are regulated by multiple photoreceptors. Specifically, flowering time in Arabidopsis is promoted by the blue light photoreceptor cryptochromes (CRY1 and CRY2) but is suppressed by the red light photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) ( Reed et al., 1993 ; Guo et al., 1998 ; Mockler et al., 1999 , 2003 ; Yang et al., 2000 ; Cerdan and Chory, 2003 ). In addition to regulating flowering, Arabidopsis cryptochromes act together with phytochromes to regulate photomorphogenic development ( Ahmad and Cashmore, 1993 ; Chory et al., 1996 ; Ahmad et al., 1998 ; Guo et al., 1998 ; Neff and Chory, 1998 ; Quail, 2002 ), entrain the circadian clock ( Somers et al., 1998 ), and together with the blue light photoreceptor phototropins, mediate blue light regulation of stomatal opening ( Kinoshita et al., 2001 ; Mao et al., 2005 ).

Significant progress has been made recently in elucidating the signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis CRY. Cryptochomes typically have an N-terminal PHR (photolyase related) domain that shares sequence similarity with photolyase, a family of flavoproteins that catalyzes the repair of UV light–damaged DNA, and a distinguishing C-terminal domain that is absent in photolyase and has no strong sequence similarity with any known protein domain ( Sancar, 1994 ; Cashmore et al., 1999 ; Lin and Shalitin, 2003 ). The C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis CRY1 or CRY2 (CCT1 or CCT2) is shown to mediate the signaling of CRY1 or CRY2 in response to light activation through physical interaction with COP1 ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ), a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that also controls various light responses, including photomorphogenesis ( Deng et al., 1992 ), flowering time ( McNellis et al., 1994 ), and stomatal opening ( Mao et al., 2005 ). It has recently been demonstrated that the N-terminal PHR domain of CRY mediates homodimerization of the CRY protein, which is required for light activation of the photoreceptor activity of CRY ( Sang et al., 2005 ; Yu et al., 2007 ).

In Arabidopsis , CONSTANS ( CO ) acts as a critical positive regulator of flowering in LDs and encodes a B box–type zinc finger transcriptional activator ( Putterill et al., 1995 ). The co mutants flower late only under LDs, whereas transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CO flower early in both LDs and SDs ( Putterill et al., 1995 ; Suarez-Lopez et al., 2001 ). CO mRNA abundance is controlled by multiple regulators, including FLAVIN BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, AND F-BOX1, GIGANTEA (GI), and CYCLING DOF FACTOR1 ( Fowler et al., 1999 ; Imaizumi et al., 2003 , 2005 ; Sawa et al., 2007 ), and the circadian clock regulates the expression of all these genes ( Imaizumi et al., 2005 ; Sawa et al., 2007 ). Under LDs, CO mRNA peaks in the afternoon, and CO protein activates transcription of the FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) gene in leaves ( An et al., 2004 ), which encodes a RAF kinase inhibitor-like protein that promotes flowering ( Kardailsky et al., 1999 ; Kobayashi et al., 1999 ; Samach et al., 2000 ; Suarez-Lopez et al., 2001 ; Yanovsky and Kay, 2002 ). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the FT protein acts as a florigen that moves from leaves to the shoot apex to induce flowering in Arabidopsis ( Corbesier et al., 2007 ; Jaeger and Wigge, 2007 ; Mathieu et al., 2007 ). Blue light acts to stabilize CO in a CRY-dependent manner, whereas red light acts to reduce CO abundance in a phyB-dependent manner, and under LDs, CRY acts to antagonize the degradation of CO mediated by phyB. In darkness, the CO protein is degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway ( Valverde et al., 2004 ). Recent studies demonstrated that regulated proteolysis plays a pivotal role in light signaling. Specifically, COP1 is shown to interact with HY5 ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ), LAF1 ( Seo et al., 2003 ), and HFR1 ( Jang et al., 2005 ; Yang et al., 2005 ), all of which are transcriptional activators that act to positively regulate photomorphogenesis and act as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate and degrade all these proteins in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner ( Saijo et al., 2003 ; Seo et al., 2003 ; Jang et al., 2005 ; Yang et al., 2005 ).

To date, the mechanism of how CO abundance is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we show by genetic studies that CO acts downstream of COP1 and CRY to regulate flowering time. We also show, by biochemical and transgenic studies, that COP1 physically interacts with CO and functions as an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates CO in vitro and reduces CO levels in vivo. We propose that COP1 acts as a critical negative regulator of flowering that reduces CO abundance in darkness and that the CRY-mediated signal may negatively regulate COP1, thus stabilizing CO and promoting flowering.

Expression of the Dominant-Negative N-Terminal Fragment of COP1 in TransgenicP35S–CO–YFP#5 Seedlings Results in an Increase in CO Abundance

To determine whether COP1 regulates CO levels in vivo, we prepared a construct expressing the dominant-negative N-terminal fragment of COP1 (COP1–N) ( McNellis et al., 1996 ) fused to a 6xFLAG epitope, which is driven by a chemical-inducible promoter XVE ( Zuo et al., 2000 ) ( Figure 7A ), and transformed it into wild-type Arabidopsis . A transgenic line, PXVE – COP1 – N #8, was obtained and genetically crossed into the P35S – CO – YFP #5 background to generate the double transgenic line PXVE – COP1 – N #8 P35S – CO – YFP #5. As shown in Figure 7B , without β-estradiol induction, the PXVE – COP1 – N #8 P35S – CO – YFP #5 seedlings were fully etiolated in darkness, similar to the wild type, but displayed a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype (COP phenotype) with β-estradiol induction, similar to the cop1 mutant. Consistent with the COP phenotype, protein gel blot analysis using an antibody against FLAG indicated that PXVE – COP1 – N #8 P35S – CO – YFP #5 seedlings accumulated FLAG–COP1–N fusion protein only in the presence of β-estradiol induction ( Figure 7C ). Confocal microscopy analysis indicated that almost no CO–YFP accumulated in root cells of the dark-grown PXVE – COP1 – N #8 P35S – CO – YFP #5 seedlings in the absence of β-estradiol induction ( Figure 7D ). However, induction of COP1–N expression in darkness resulted in a dramatic increase in CO accumulation ( Figure 7E ). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that CO – YFP expressed at similar levels either with or without β-estradiol induction ( Figure 7F ). These results suggest that inhibition of the endogenous COP1 activity by expression of the dominant-negative COP1–N fragment might reduce CO degradation.

DISCUSSION

Previous studies demonstrated that Arabidopsis cryptochromes COP1 and CO are involved in regulating flowering time ( McNellis et al., 1994 ; Putterill et al., 1995 ; Guo et al., 1998 ; Mockler et al., 1999 , 2003 ) and that cryptochromes act to stabilize the CO protein ( Valverde et al., 2004 ). The photomorphogenic development controlled by CRY is mediated through direct interaction with COP1 ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ). In this report, we further the understanding of the mechanism of flowering time regulation involving Arabidopsis CRY, COP1, and CO by demonstrating that COP1 acts genetically downstream of CRY , CO acts downstream of COP1 and CRY , and that COP1 physically interacts with CO in both yeast and plant cells. We demonstrate that COP1 serves as an E3 ligase for CO in vitro and induces CO degradation in Arabidopsis in darkness. We propose that cryptochrome regulation of flowering time might involve negative regulation of COP1, through either direct CRY–COP1 interaction or via other unknown mechanisms, which relieves the E3 ligase activity of COP1 on CO. Once CO accumulates, it activates FT transcription to induce flowering. This proposal is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that CO abundance is positively regulated by cryptochromes and that CO degradation is mediated by the 26S proteasome pathway ( Valverde et al., 2004 ).
