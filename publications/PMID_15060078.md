By exploiting nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques along with novel 
applications of saturation difference analysis, we deciphered the functions of 
the previously uncharacterized products of three bacterial genes, rbsD, fucU, 
and yiiL, which are part of the ribose, fucose, and rhamnose operons of 
Escherichia coli, respectively. We show that RbsD catalyzes the pyran to furan 
conversion of ribose, whereas FucU and YiiL are involved in the catalysis of the 
anomeric conversion of their respective sugars. It was observed that the 
anomeric exchange of only ribofuranose, not ribopyranose, occurs spontaneously 
in solution rationalizing its evolutionary incorporation into the nucleic acid. 
The RbsD and FucU proteins share sequence homology and belong to the same 
protein family that is found from eubacteria to human, whereas the YiiL 
homologues exist in archaebacteria and lower eukaryotes. These enzymes, 
including the galactose mutarotase, exhibit a certain degree of 
cross-specificity to structurally analogous sugars thereby encompassing all 
existing monosaccharides in terms of their reactivities. The ubiquitous presence 
of enzymes involved in the anomeric changes of monosaccharides highlights an 
importance of these activities in various cellular processes requiring efficient 
monosaccharide utilization.
