The VPS4 AAA ATPases function both in endosomal vesicle formation and in the 
budding of many enveloped RNA viruses, including HIV-1. VPS4 proteins act by 
binding and catalyzing release of the membrane-associated ESCRT-III protein 
lattice, thereby allowing multiple rounds of protein sorting and vesicle 
formation. Here, we report the solution structure of the N-terminal VPS4A 
microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domain and demonstrate that the 
VPS4A MIT domain binds the C-terminal half of the ESCRT-III protein, CHMP1B (Kd 
= 20 +/- 13 microM). The MIT domain forms an asymmetric three-helix bundle that 
resembles the first three helices in a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif. 
Unusual interhelical interactions are mediated by a series of conserved aromatic 
residues that form coiled-coil interactions between the second two helices and 
also pack against the conserved alanines that interdigitate between the first 
two helices. Mutational analyses revealed that a conserved leucine residue 
(Leu-64) on the third helix that would normally bind the fourth helix in an 
extended TPR is used to bind CHMP1B, raising the possibility that ESCRT-III 
proteins may bind by completing the TPR motif.

Abstract

The VPS4 AAA ATPases function both in endosomal vesicle formation and in the budding of many enveloped RNA viruses, including HIV-1. VPS4 proteins act by binding and catalyzing release of the membrane-associated ESCRT-III protein lattice, thereby allowing multiple rounds of protein sorting and vesicle formation. Here, we report the solution structure of the N-terminal VPS4A m icrotubule i nteracting and t ransport (MIT) domain and demonstrate that the VPS4A MIT domain binds the C-terminal half of the ESCRT-III protein, CHMP1B ( K d = 20 ± 13 μM). The MIT domain forms an asymmetric three-helix bundle that resembles the first three helices in a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif. Unusual interhelical interactions are mediated by a series of conserved aromatic residues that form coiled-coil interactions between the second two helices and also pack against the conserved alanines that interdigitate between the first two helices. Mutational analyses revealed that a conserved leucine residue (Leu-64) on the third helix that would normally bind the fourth helix in an extended TPR is used to bind CHMP1B, raising the possibility that ESCRT-III proteins may bind by completing the TPR motif.

Results and Discussion

VPS4A MIT Domain Structure Determination. N-terminal fragments of VPS4A and VPS4B were screened for their feasibility for NMR structural studies. The two fragments tested, VPS4A 1–122 and VPS4B 1–129 , were designed to span the entire region of VPS4B that was disordered in our recent crystal structure of the full-length protein (residues 1–122) ( 19 ). Both VPS4A 1–122 and VPS4B 1–129 exhibited reasonable amide proton and nitrogen chemical shift dispersion, but VPS4B 1–129 NH resonance line-widths and intensities varied, whereas the VPS4A 1–122 spectrum was of uniformly high quality. Therefore, this protein was selected for high-resolution structural studies.

Essentially complete proton resonance assignments were obtained for VPS4A 1–122 by using a standard suite of NMR experiments (Table 1). Analyses of short- and medium-range NOE patterns, 3 J HNHA couplings, and 13 C chemical shift indices indicated the presence of three well defined helices (residues 5–20, 25–45, and 50–76), a fourth region with helical propensity (105–114), and random coil secondary structure elsewhere (Fig. 5). VPS4A 1–122 residues 77–122, including the final nascent helix, lacked any detectable long-range NOEs, and were therefore excluded from structure calculations. VPS4 residues 5–76 formed a tightly packed, well ordered structure as judged by the excellent agreement between different structures (0.26-Å backbone heavy atom rms deviation for 20 calculated structures), good geometries, low residual energies, and a lack of NOE violations (see Table 2 and Fig. 6).

Structure of the VPS4A MIT Domain. The MIT domain of VPS4A (residues 5–76) forms an antiparallel three helix bundle ( Fig. 2 A ). The three helices wrap with a left superhelical twist, and are disposed asymmetrically onto three corners of a square ( Fig. 2 B ). The third helix is longer than the first two, and has an ≈10° bend centered about residue Tyr-63. Helices 2 and 3 form a two-stranded, antiparallel coiled coil, and interact with canonical “knobs in holes” side chain interactions ( 32 , 33 ) ( Fig. 3 ). This interaction explains the predicted coiled-coil propensity of the third helix ( 10 ), and also explains the conservation of hydrophobic residues across MIT domains at helix 2 positions 25, 29, 32, 36, 39, and 43 and helix 3 positions 56, 60, 63, 67, 70, and 74 (see Fig. 1 ), because these residues correspond to the alternating a (+1) and d (+4) positions in the heptad repeats of the coiled coil. However, the coiled coil formed between helices 2 and 3 is unusual in that it is mediated by conserved aromatic (as opposed to aliphatic) side chains at positions 25, 32, 39, and 63.

In contrast, helices 1 and 2 do not form a canonical coiled coil, but rather interact through a motif that could be described as an “alanine zipper.” As shown in Figs. 2 C and 3 , the closest contacts between the two helices are mediated by five alanine residues, two from helix 1 (Ala-9 and Ala-16), and three from helix 2 (Ala-28, Ala-35, and Ala-42). Each set of alanines is separated by seven residues, and the side chains therefore project from the same side of the helix with a spacing of two helical turns. However, unlike the side chains in a coiled coil, the alanines project directly toward the partner helix, and form an interdigitating strip between the two helices ( Fig. 2 C ). As shown in Fig. 3 , all of these alanines sit between hydrophobic residues that project from the +4 and +5 positions on the partner helix (numbering relative to the preceding alanine). The distance between helices 1 and 2 in the MIT domain of VPS4A is not unusual (≈10 Å), but this packing distance can only readily accommodate small side chains such as Ala and Gly at the five zipper positions ( 9 , 16 , 28 , 35 , and 42 ). Importantly, these alanines or glycines are highly conserved, particularly within the center of the zipper, with ≥93% conservation of Ala or Gly at positions 9, 16, 28, and 35 in the 116 known MIT domain sequences ( 23 ). Therefore, analogous interhelical packing interactions likely exist in all MIT domains.

Importantly, the alanine zipper formed between the first two helices is linked structurally to the aromatic coiled coil formed between the second two helices, so that the entire three-helix bundle of the MIT domain can be considered a single structural motif. Specifically, the two alanines from helix 1 (Ala-9 and Ala-16) pack between conserved central aromatic residues from helix 2 (Tyr-32 and Phe-39). Similarly, the three alanines on helix 2 (Ala-28, Ala-35, and Ala-42) pack against aromatic/large hydrophobic side chains from the heptad repeat of helix 3 (Leu-70, Tyr-63, and Ile-56). Thus, the central strip of aromatic residues between helices 2 and 3 simultaneously buttresses the alanine zipper and participates in coiled-coil formation, and apparently serves to hold the three helices at a proper angle (see Figs. 2 B and 3 ).

The closest known structural matches to the VPS4A MIT domain occur for two distinct classes of helical bundles ( 34 ). The first class corresponds to the first three helices within canonical four helix bundles. In the best matches, the three MIT domain helices align with the first three helices of the four helix bundles with backbone atom rms deviations of ≈2 Å (e.g., α-1 catenin; Protein Data Bank ID 1h6g, Dali z score = 8.1, backbone atom rms deviation = 2.0 over 74 residues). However, as emphasized above, the interhelical side chain packing interactions of the VPS4A 5–76 MIT domain are quite distinct from those of canonical four helix bundles, and it therefore seems unlikely that MIT domains bind their partners by completing the four helix bundle. The second class of similar structures correspond to helices within tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR). For example, the three MIT domain helices align well with the first three helices in the TPR of FKBP51 (Protein Data Bank ID 1kt0, Dali z score = 8.7, backbone atom rms deviation = 2.1 over 70 residues in helices 1–3, see Fig. 4 D and E ). TPR motifs are repeats of paired helices composed of two different types of interhelical interactions: an A/B interaction within each helical pair and a B/A′ interaction that links one helix pair to the next ( 35 ). TPR and MIT domain helices are similar in that: ( i ) the helices have similar spatial dispositions, ( ii ) an Ala/Gly zipper pairs the first two helices (the A/B interaction), and ( iii ) conserved aromatic residues perform similar roles in helping to bridge the first helix pair and the following repeat (the B/A′ interaction). In a TPR, the fourth (B′) helix, which is absent in the MIT domain, binds the third helix and we envision that an analogous interaction could mediate the intermolecular interaction with CHMP1B (see below).

The VPS4A MIT Domain Binds the C-Terminal Region of CHMP1B. To begin to define how the VPS4 ATPases interact with the assembled ESCRT-III lattice, we mapped the sites of interaction between the VPS4A and CHMP1B proteins. The 10 different human CHMP proteins exhibit only modest pairwise sequence identities (12–65%), but nevertheless share a number of common features, including similar sizes (210 ± 20 residues), predicted coiled-coil motifs, and highly asymmetric charge distributions ( 9 ). CHMP1B is typical of other CHMP proteins in that the first 64 residues are highly basic [predicted isoelectric point (PI) of 10.1] and contain a predicted coiled coil (see Fig. 1 ), whereas the C-terminal 132 residues are highly acidic (predicted PI of 4.5) and lack predicted coiled-coil motifs. We have previously used GST pull-down assays to demonstrate that both VPS4A and VPS4B bind to a series of full-length ESCRT-III proteins, including CHMP1B ( 12 ). As shown in Fig. 4 A , the full-length recombinant VPS4A protein also bound a C-terminal fragment of GST-CHMP1B (residues 65–196), but not GST alone (compare lanes 4 and 5). Thus, VPS4A does not interact with the CHMP1B coiled-coil/basic region as had been predicted ( 10 ), but instead binds the protein's acidic C-terminal region. These data are consistent with other recent experiments showing that C-terminal regions of other CHMP proteins bind VPS4 in extracts ( 13 , 36 ).

As discussed above, the ESCRT-III proteins are apparently substrates for the VPS4 ATPases ( 9 , 10 , 14 – 17 ) and AAA ATPase substrate recognition is typically meditated by the N-terminal domain (reviewed in ref. 18 ). Therefore, we tested whether the N-terminal MIT domain of VPS4A alone (VPS4A 1–84 ) could bind CHMP1B proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 A , VPS4A 1–84 bound GST-CHMP1B 65–196 , but not GST alone (compare lanes 6 and 7). Thus, the VPS4A MIT domain alone contains CHMP1B binding activity. This observation was confirmed and quantitated in biosensor binding experiments, in which soluble monomeric VPS4A 1–84 bound specifically to immobilized GST-CHMP1B proteins. VPS4A MIT domain binding and dissociation were rapid at 20°C, and dissociation constants were therefore obtained by analyzing equilibrium binding phases (see Fig. 7 B for representative sensorgrams). As shown in Fig. 4 B , the MIT domain bound with equal affinity to both full-length GST-CHMP1B ( K d = 20 ± 13 μM) and GST-CHMP1B 65–196 ( K d = 13 ± 6 μM). Thus, a C-terminal CHMP1B fragment that contains the acidic region but lacks the predicted coiled-coil contributes all of the energetically significant VPS4A MIT binding contacts.

Biosensor binding assays were also used to map the interaction surface on the VPS4A MIT domain. We reasoned that the binding site might feature a cluster of conserved, surface-exposed residues, particularly hydrophobic residues. As discussed above, interhelical packing interactions rationalize the conservation of all hydrophobic residues found with >50% frequency in the MIT domain, with the sole exception of Leu-64, which is exposed on the surface of helix 3 (see Figs. 1 and 4 C ). Most of the remaining hydrophobic residues that lack strict sequence conservation also appear to perform structural roles, as do a conserved pair of charged residues, Asp-20 and Arg-66, which approach one another across the interface between helices 1 and 2, where they may interact to form a salt bridge. This leaves nine solvent-exposed residues that are conserved at >50% identity and that appear unlikely to perform important structural roles within the three helix bundle (Lys/Arg-15, Glu/Asp-26, Glu/Asp-37, Arg/Lys-53, Arg/Lys-57, Lys-59, Leu-64, Glu-68, and Lys/Arg-71). We created an ensemble of proteins that contained single alanine substitution mutations at each conserved position, as well as in the exposed Ile-10 residue. Although Ile-10 is <50% conserved across all MIT domains, this position is typically hydrophobic and lies on the face opposite Leu-64.

As summarized in Fig. 4 B – E , the affinity of CHMP1B (and CHMP1B 65–96 ) binding was reduced very substantially (>30-fold) by the VPS4A 1–84 L64A mutation. An alanine substitution mutation in the adjacent Glu-68 residue also reduced CHMP1B binding affinity, albeit modestly (3.5-fold). None of the other mutants altered the CHMP1B binding affinity significantly (<3-fold). Importantly, an [ 1 H, 15 N] HSQC spectrum of the VPS4A 1–84 L64A protein confirmed that this mutation did not alter the overall fold of the MIT domain (see Fig. 7 A ). Therefore, we conclude that CHMP1B contacts the Leu-64/Glu-68 patch directly. As shown in Fig. 4 E , this patch corresponds to the surface of helix 3 that would normally interact with the fourth helix in a TPR motif. Thus, the short TPR in the MIT domain has adapted to bind a target protein in trans, rather than a fourth helix in cis, raising the intriguing possibility that helices from the ESCRT-III proteins may bind by completing or extending the TPR.

Potential Biological Implications. MIT domains are found in proteins that function in important biological processes such as endosomal protein sorting (VPS4, SNX15, spastin) ( 10 , 20 , 22 ), virus budding (VPS4) ( 25 ), microtubule organization (spastin) ( 21 , 22 , 37 , 38 ), and maintenance of motor neuron function (spastin and spartin) ( 22 , 39 ). The general conservation of key structural residues indicates that all MIT domains will form three-helix bundles that are similar to the VPS4A MIT domain structure presented here.

Our data also demonstrate that the MIT domain of VPS4A binds directly to the C-terminal acidic region of the ESCRT-III protein, CHMP1B, and to analogous regions on other human CHMP proteins (data not shown). These interactions seem functionally important because recruitment of VPS4 proteins to endosomal membranes requires both the C-terminal half of CHMP proteins ( 40 ) and the MIT domains of VPS4 proteins ( 10 ). Interestingly, another MIT domain-containing protein, spastin, is also a CHMP1B-binding protein and the MIT domain is again required for this interaction ( 22 ). As shown in Fig. 1 , the key Leu-64 residue in helix 3 critical for the VPS4A/CHMP1B interaction is also conserved in the spastin MIT domain. This domain again precedes a AAA ATPase cassette, raising the possibility that spastin may perform at least some functions that are analogous to those of the two better characterized human VPS4 proteins. Indeed, although the binding partners for most MIT domain proteins have not yet been determined experimentally, the apparent conservation of the exposed leucine on helix 3 suggests that other human MIT domain proteins such as SNX15, which again seems to function in endosomal protein sorting ( 20 ), may also interact functionally with ESCRT-III proteins.
