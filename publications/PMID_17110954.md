Modulating transcription factors is crucial to executing sophisticated gene 
expression programs. The silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) family of 
NAD-dependent protein deacetylases influences transcription by targeting 
proteins such as histones, p53 and forkhead-box family transcription factors. 
Although apparently cytoplasmic, both mammalian SIRT2 and its yeast orthologue 
Hst2 have been implicated in transcriptional regulation. Here, we show that Hst2 
moves between the nucleus and cytoplasm, but is largely cytoplasmic owing to 
efficient nuclear export. This nuclear exclusion is mediated by the exportin 
chromosomal region maintenance 1 (Crm1) and a putative leucine-rich nuclear 
export sequence in Hst2, which overlaps a unique autoregulatory helix. 
Disruption of Hst2 export shows that nuclear exclusion inhibits the activity of 
Hst2 as a transcriptional repressor. Our identification of putative nuclear 
export sequences in numerous vertebrate SIRT2 proteins shows that active nuclear 
export can be a conserved mechanism for regulating Sir2 homologues.
