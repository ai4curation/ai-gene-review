The sequestration of damaged mitochondria within double-membrane structures 
termed autophagosomes is a key step of PINK1/Parkin mitophagy. The ATG4 family 
of proteases are thought to regulate autophagosome formation exclusively by 
processing the ubiquitin-like ATG8 family (LC3/GABARAPs). We discover that human 
ATG4s promote autophagosome formation independently of their protease activity 
and of ATG8 family processing. ATG4 proximity networks reveal a role for ATG4s 
and their proximity partners, including the immune-disease protein LRBA, in 
ATG9A vesicle trafficking to mitochondria. Artificial intelligence-directed 3D 
electron microscopy of phagophores shows that ATG4s promote phagophore-ER 
contacts during the lipid-transfer phase of autophagosome formation. We also 
show that ATG8 removal during autophagosome maturation does not depend on ATG4 
activity. Instead, ATG4s can disassemble ATG8-protein conjugates, revealing a 
role for ATG4s as deubiquitinating-like enzymes. These findings establish 
non-canonical roles of the ATG4 family beyond the ATG8 lipidation axis and 
provide an AI-driven framework for rapid 3D electron microscopy.
