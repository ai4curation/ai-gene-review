Beta1 integrins are highly expressed on chondrocytes, where they mediate 
adhesion to cartilage matrix proteins. To assess the functions of beta1 integrin 
during skeletogenesis, we inactivated the beta1 integrin gene in chondrocytes. 
We show here that these mutant mice develop a chondrodysplasia of various 
severity. beta1-deficient chondrocytes had an abnormal shape and failed to 
arrange into columns in the growth plate. This is caused by a lack of motility, 
which is in turn caused by a loss of adhesion to collagen type II, reduced 
binding to and impaired spreading on fibronectin, and an abnormal F-actin 
organization. In addition, mutant chondrocytes show decreased proliferation 
caused by a defect in G1/S transition and cytokinesis. The G1/S defect is, at 
least partially, caused by overexpression of Fgfr3, nuclear translocation of 
Stat1/Stat5a, and up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitors p16 and p21. 
Altogether these findings establish that beta1-integrin-dependent motility and 
proliferation of chondrocytes are mandatory events for endochondral bone 
formation to occur.
