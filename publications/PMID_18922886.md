The retinoic acids all-trans retinoic acid (AT-RA) and 9-cis retinoic acid 
(9C-RA) and the retinoic acid receptors RAR and RXR significantly induce 
transcriptional activity from a 200-bp PKD1 proximal promoter in transfected 
mammalian cells. This PKD1 promoter region contains Ets, p53, and GC box motifs, 
but lacks a canonical RAR/RXR motif. Mutagenesis of the Ets sites did not affect 
RA induction. In contrast, GC box mutations completely blocked stimulation by 
AT-RA and by RXRbeta or RARbeta. Mithramycin A, which prevents Sp1 binding, 
significantly reduced basal promoter activity and suppressed upregulation by 
AT-RA and RXR. The 200-bp proximal promoter could not be induced by AT-RA in 
Drosophila SL2 cells, which lack Sp1, but could be activated in these cells 
transfected with exogenous Sp1. Small interfering RNA knockdown of Sp1 in 
mammalian cells completely blocked RXRbeta upregulation of the promoter. These 
data indicate that induction of the PKD1 promoter by retinoic acid is mediated 
through Sp1 elements. RT-PCR showed that AT-RA treatment of HEK293T cells 
increased the levels of endogenous PKD1 RNA, and chromatin immunoprecipitation 
showed the presence of both RXR and Sp1 at the PKD1 proximal promoter. These 
results suggest that retinoids and their receptors may play a role in PKD1 gene 
regulation.
