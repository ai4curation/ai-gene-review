Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most common genetic cause of familial 
Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its physiological and pathological functions 
are unknown. Therefore, we generated several independent Drosophila lines 
carrying WT or mutant human LRRK2 (mutations in kinase, COR or LRR domains, 
resp.). Ectopic expression of WT or mutant LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons caused 
their significant loss accompanied by complex age-dependent changes in locomotor 
activity. Overall, the ubiquitous expression of LRRK2 increased lifespan and 
fertility of the flies. However, these flies were more sensitive to rotenone. 
LRRK2 expression in the eye exacerbated retinal degeneration. Importantly, in 
double transgenic flies, various indices of the eye and dopaminergic survival 
were modified in a complex fashion by a concomitant expression of PINK1, DJ-1 or 
Parkin. This evidence suggests a genetic interaction between these PD-relevant 
genes.
