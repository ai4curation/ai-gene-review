AFAP-110 has an intrinsic ability to alter actin filament integrity as an actin 
filament crosslinking protein. This capability is regulated by a carboxy 
terminal leucine zipper (Lzip) motif. The Lzip motif facilitates 
self-association stabilizing the AFAP-110 multimers. Deletion of the Lzip motif 
(AFAP-110(Deltalzip)) reduces the stability of the AFAP-110 multimer and 
concomitantly increases its ability to crosslink actin filaments, in vitro, and 
to activate cSrc and alter actin filament integrity, in vivo. We sought to 
determine how the Lzip motif regulates AFAP-110 function. Substitution of the 
c-Fos Lzip motif in place of the AFAP-110 Lzip motif (AFAP-110(fos)) was 
predicted to preserve the alpha-helical structure while changing the sequence. 
To alter the structure of the alpha-helix, a leucine to proline mutation was 
generated in the AFAP-110 alpha-helical Lzip motif (AFAP-110(581P)), which 
largely preserved the sequence. The helix mutants, AFAP-110(Deltalzip), 
AFAP-110(fos), and AFAP-110(581P), demonstrated reduced multimer stability with 
an increased capacity to crosslink actin filaments, in vitro, relative to 
AFAP-110. An analysis of opposing binding sites indicated that the carboxy 
terminus/Lzip motif can contact sequences within the amino terminal pleckstrin 
homology (PH1) domain indicating an auto-inhibitory mechanism for regulating 
multimer stability and actin filament crosslinking. In vivo, only 
AFAP-110(Deltalzip) and AFAP-110(581P) were to activate cSrc and to alter 
cellular actin filament integrity. These data indicate that the intrinsic 
ability of AFAP-110 to crosslink actin filaments is dependent upon both the 
sequence and structure of the Lzip motif, while the ability of the Lzip motif to 
regulate AFAP-110-directed activation of cSrc and changes in actin filament 
integrity in vivo is dependent upon the structure or presence of the Lzip motif. 
We hypothesize that the intrinsic ability of AFAP-110 to crosslink actin 
filaments or activate cSrc are distinct functions.
