AKAP-Lbc is a novel member of the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAPs) family, 
which functions as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-targeting protein as 
well as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoA. We recently 
demonstrated that AKAP-Lbc Rho-GEF activity is stimulated by the alpha-subunit 
of the heterotrimeric G protein G(12), whereas phosphorylation of AKAP-Lbc by 
the anchored PKA induces the recruitment of 14-3-3, which inhibits its GEF 
function. In the present report, using co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we 
demonstrated that AKAP-Lbc can form homo-oligomers inside cells. Mutagenesis 
studies revealed that oligomerization is mediated by two adjacent leucine zipper 
motifs located in the C-terminal region of the anchoring protein. Most 
interestingly, disruption of oligomerization resulted in a drastic increase in 
the ability of AKAP-Lbc to stimulate the formation of Rho-GTP in cells under 
basal conditions, suggesting that oligomerization maintains AKAP-Lbc in a 
basal-inactive state. Based on these results and on our previous findings 
showing that AKAP-Lbc is inactivated through the association with 14-3-3, we 
investigated the hypothesis that AKAP-Lbc oligomerization might be required for 
the regulatory action of 14-3-3. Most interestingly, we found that mutants of 
AKAP-Lbc impaired in their ability to undergo oligomerization were completely 
resistant to the inhibitory effect of PKA and 14-3-3. This suggests that 14-3-3 
can negatively regulate the Rho-GEF activity of AKAP-Lbc only when the anchoring 
protein is in an oligomeric state. Altogether, these findings provide a novel 
mechanistic explanation of how oligomerization can regulate the activity of 
exchange factors of the Dbl family.
