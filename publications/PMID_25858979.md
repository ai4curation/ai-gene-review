The integrated stress response (ISR) modulates messenger RNA translation to 
regulate the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR), immunity, and memory 
formation. A chemical ISR inhibitor, ISRIB, enhances cognitive function and 
modulates the UPR in vivo. To explore mechanisms involved in ISRIB action, we 
screened cultured mammalian cells for somatic mutations that reversed its effect 
on the ISR. Clustered missense mutations were found at the amino-terminal 
portion of the delta subunit of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. 
When reintroduced by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of wild-type cells, these 
mutations reversed both ISRIB-mediated inhibition of the ISR and its stimulatory 
effect on eIF2B GEF activity toward its substrate, the translation initiation 
factor eIF2, in vitro. Thus, ISRIB targets an interaction between eIF2 and eIF2B 
that lies at the core of the ISR.

Abstract

The integrated stress response (ISR) modulates mRNA translation to regulate the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR), immunity and memory formation. A chemical ISR inhibitor, ISRIB, enhances cognitive function and modulates the UPR in vivo. To explore mechanisms involved in ISRIB action we screened cultured mammalian cells for somatic mutations that reversed its effect on the ISR. Clustered missense mutations were found at the N-terminal portion of the delta subunit of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. When reintroduced by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of wildtype cells, these mutations reversed both ISRIB-mediated inhibition of the ISR and its stimulatory effect on eIF2B GEF activity towards its substrate, eIF2, in vitro. Thus ISRIB targets an interaction between eIF2 and eIF2B that lies at the core of the ISR.
