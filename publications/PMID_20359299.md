The development of small molecule and antibody inhibitors targeting the 
interaction of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR), is of high pharmacological and biological interest. 
Unfortunately, conventional biochemical techniques using cell or tissue lysates 
and co-immunoprecipitation experiments to investigate EGFR dimerization are not 
always conclusive. Here we describe a series of technical and biological 
validation experiments demonstrating the utility of a proximity ligation assay 
(PLA)-based methodology for in situ visualization and quantification of 
ligand-dependent EGFR receptor dimerization in intact cells. Using the PLA 
approach combined with a universally applicable epitope tagging strategy, we 
detected EGFR dimers in cells transiently co-expressing FLAG-tagged and 
MYC-tagged human EGFRs. Our data strongly suggest that PLA can be used to detect 
ligand-dependent EGFR dimerization and this signal is generated in a protein 
interaction-based manner, rather than solely due to proximity of target 
proteins. This application represents a generalized RTK expression strategy for 
protein-interaction analysis in a transient expression system where antibody 
epitopes are not known or not unique enough to discriminate between interaction 
partners. This assay also holds promise as a general RTK dimerization screening 
tool in tissue specimens to identify potential dimerization inhibitors with 
clinical relevance.
