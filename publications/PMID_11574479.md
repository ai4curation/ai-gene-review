Purified U7 snRNPs lack the Sm proteins D1 and D2 but contain Lsm10, a new 14 
kDa Sm D1-like protein.

U7 snRNPs were isolated from HeLa cells by biochemical fractionation, followed 
by affinity purification with a biotinylated oligonucleotide complementary to U7 
snRNA. Purified U7 snRNPs lack the Sm proteins D1 and D2, but contain additional 
polypeptides of 14, 50 and 70 kDa. Microsequencing identified the 14 kDa 
polypeptide as a new Sm-like protein related to Sm D1 and D3. Like U7 snRNA, 
this protein, named Lsm10, is enriched in Cajal bodies of the cell nucleus. Its 
incorporation into U7 snRNPs is largely dictated by the special Sm binding site 
of U7 snRNA. This novel type of Sm complex, composed of both conventional Sm 
proteins and the Sm-like Lsm10, is most likely to be important for U7 snRNP 
function and subcellular localization.
