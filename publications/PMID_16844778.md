Hsp90 plays an essential role in maintaining stability and activity of its 
clients, including oncogenic signaling proteins that regulate key signal 
transduction nodes. Hsp90 inhibitors interfere with diverse signaling pathways 
by destabilizing and attenuating activity of such proteins, and thus they 
exhibit antitumor activity. However, Hsp90 inhibition has recently been reported 
to activate Akt and Erk and potentiate Akt activation induced by insulin-like 
growth factor 1 and insulin, raising the concern that clinical use of Hsp90 
inhibitors might promote tumor progression under certain circumstances. Here, we 
show that the prototypical Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin induces Akt and Erk 
activation that is independent of PTEN status and is mediated by transient 
activation of Src kinase. Activated Src phosphorylates Cbl, which recruits the 
p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, resulting in phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase activation and eventually the activation of Akt and Erk. We show that 
geldanamycin rapidly disrupts Src association with Hsp90, suggesting that Src 
activation results directly from dissociation of the chaperone. These data 
suggest that, under certain circumstances, dual inhibition of Hsp90 and Src may 
be warranted.

Abstract

Hsp90 plays an essential role in maintaining stability and activity of its clients, including oncogenic signaling proteins that regulate key signal transduction nodes. Hsp90 inhibitors interfere with diverse signaling pathways by destabilizing and attenuating activity of such proteins, and thus they exhibit antitumor activity. However, Hsp90 inhibition has recently been reported to activate Akt and Erk and potentiate Akt activation induced by insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin, raising the concern that clinical use of Hsp90 inhibitors might promote tumor progression under certain circumstances. Here, we show that the prototypical Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin induces Akt and Erk activation that is independent of PTEN status and is mediated by transient activation of Src kinase. Activated Src phosphorylates Cbl, which recruits the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, resulting in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and eventually the activation of Akt and Erk. We show that geldanamycin rapidly disrupts Src association with Hsp90, suggesting that Src activation results directly from dissociation of the chaperone. These data suggest that, under certain circumstances, dual inhibition of Hsp90 and Src may be warranted.

Discussion

We observed in this study that brief treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor GA activated both Akt and Erk in human cancer cells, confirming earlier reports ( 7 , 8 ). We showed that both Akt and Erk activation by GA require PI3-kinase activity but are independent of cellular PTEN status. Finally, we clearly demonstrated that GA-induced Src activation accounts for these processes, in part by phosphorylation of Cbl to serve as an adaptor protein that recruits the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase, thus providing a molecular mechanism for these observations. Although the mechanism by which GA stimulates Src is not yet proven, it is likely to depend on GA-induced loss of Hsp90 binding. Similar pharmacologic disruption of Hsp90 binding to PKR kinase coincides with its activation ( 7 ), and a transient increase in activity of the Hsp90 client ErbB2 after Hsp90 inhibitor-dependent dissociation of the chaperone has recently been reported ( 26 ). Thus, although client protein destabilization is likely to remain the predominant outcome of Hsp90 inhibition, it is important to consider that a previously unappreciated, albeit transient consequence of this process may be selective activation of clients.

Although Hsp90 is required for Src maturation ( 27 ), association of endogenous mature c-Src with Hsp90 is difficult to detect ( 28 ). Indeed, we found only a small amount of Hsp90 to coprecipitate with Src in T24 cells. An explanation of this apparent paradox may be found in recent studies detailing the complex structural alterations involved in the process of Src activation. Inactive Src exists in a clamped configuration in which the SH2 domain interacts with the C-terminal phospho-Tyr-529 residue, whereas the SH3 domain covers the kinase domain, sterically obstructing access to the recently identified Hsp90 binding loop ( 29 , 30 ). In addition to dephosphorylation of Tyr-529, interaction with SH2 and/or SH3 ligands primes Src for activation by relaxing this inhibitory conformation and allowing the kinase to be fully activated by phosphorylation of Tyr-418 in the activation loop ( 31 ). We propose that this intermediate conformation, neither fully repressed nor fully active, interacts with Hsp90 via the now accessible chaperone binding loop ( 30 ), and that the subsequent release of Hsp90 permits efficient phosphorylation of Tyr-418. In this study, we observed a rapid increase in phosphorylation of Tyr-418 upon GA-induced release of Hsp90 from the small pool of Src protein with which it was associated. In addition, we observed that stimulation of integrin signaling with fibronectin, which recruits the SH3 domain of Src to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin and eventually leads to Src activation ( 32 ), promoted GA-sensitive Src interaction with Hsp90 (see Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).

In the context of cancer, Hsp90 inhibitor-dependent Src activation, although subtle, may be of particular relevance. GA-induced Src activation appears to be a relatively common occurrence in human cells because this process was not only observed in T24 bladder cancer cells and MCF7 breast cancer cells, but also in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and two prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3; data not shown). Src activation is also likely involved in GA potentiation of insulin-like growth factor and insulin signaling ( 7 , 9 ) because Src can directly phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate 1 ( 33 ) and insulin-like growth factor receptor ( 34 ). Although Src-dependent activation of Akt and Erk after GA is relatively short-lived, these data raise the concern that in certain contexts Hsp90 inhibition might favor tumor survival and/or progression. Indeed, a recent study reported that 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) promotes formation of osteolytic lesions and bone metastases in a murine breast cancer model by potentiating osteoclastic bone resorption, even though the drug reduced tumor growth at the orthotopic site ( 35 ). Because Src is essential for osteoclast activity ( 20 ) and Src-induced activation of Akt and Erk promotes osteoclast survival ( 36 , 37 ), 17-AAG-induced Src activation, as described in this study, may be responsible for the reported effects of 17-AAG on bone. If that is the case, coadministration of an Src inhibitor should prevent these unfavorable effects of Hsp90 inhibitors. These data suggest that a fuller appreciation of the complex role played by Hsp90 in regulating signal transduction pathways will better inform the clinical utility of Hsp90 inhibitors.
