Titin is a giant muscle protein with a molecular weight in the megaDalton range 
and a contour length of more than 1 microm. Its size and location within the 
sarcomere structure determine its important role in the mechanism of muscle 
elasticity. According to the current consensus, elasticity stems directly from 
more than one type of spring-like behaviour of the I-band portion of the 
molecule. Starting from slack length, extension of the sarcomere first causes 
straightening of the molecule. Further extension then induces local unfolding of 
a unique sequence, the PEVK region, which is named due to the preponderance of 
these amino-acid residues. High speeds of extension and/or high forces are 
likely to lead to unfolding of the beta-sandwich domains from which the molecule 
is mainly constructed. A release of tension leads to refolding and recoiling of 
the polypeptide. Here, we review the literature and present new experimental 
material related to the role of titin in muscle elasticity. In particular, we 
analyse the possible influence of the arrangement and environment of titin 
within the sarcomere structure on its extensible behaviour. We suggest that, due 
to the limited conformational space, elongation and compression of the molecule 
within the sarcomere occur in a more ordered way or with higher viscosity and 
higher forces than are observed in solution studies of the isolated protein.
