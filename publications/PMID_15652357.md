The cytoplasmic domain of the transforming growth factor-alpha precursor 
(proTGFalpha) contains a C-terminal PSD-95/SAP90, Discs Large, and Zona 
Occludens-1 (PDZ) recognition motif (TVV). By yeast two-hybrid screening of a 
mouse embryo library, we have found that a third member of a family of 
PDZ-containing proteins, membrane associated guanylate kinase inverted-3 
(MAGI-3), binds to TGFalpha's TVV. MAGI-3 is widely expressed in multiple mouse 
tissues, including brain. Immunolocalization showed that MAGI-3 and TGFalpha 
were colocalized in neurons in the cortex and dentate gyrus, as well as in 
ependymal cells and some astrocytes. In vitro, proTGFalpha bound the PDZ-1 
domain of MAGI-3 and MAGI-2, but not MAGI-1. MAGI-3 and the 17-kDa cell surface 
form of proTGFalpha interact transiently in MDCK cells stably transfected with 
both MAGI-3 and human proTGFalpha cDNAs. MAGI-3 and wild-type proTGFalpha 
colocalize at the cell surface. In contrast, MAGI-3 forms a stable complex with 
membrane-fixed TGFalpha early in the secretory pathway and interacts with 
immature and cell surface forms of membrane-fixed TGFalpha. Overexpression of 
MAGI-3 resulted in increased levels of TGFalpha in the basolateral medium of 
polarized MDCK cells, suggesting that MAGI-3 has a role in efficient trafficking 
of TGFalpha to the cell surface in polarized epithelial cells.
