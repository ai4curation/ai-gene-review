Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is involved in the survival of a number of 
different neural cell types, including motor neurons. CNTF functional responses 
are mediated through a tripartite membrane receptor composed of two signalling 
receptor chains, gp130 and the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), 
associated with a non-signalling CNTF binding receptor alpha component (CNTFR). 
CNTFR-deficient mice show profound neuronal deficits at birth, leading to a 
lethal phenotype. In contrast, inactivation of the CNTF gene leads only to a 
slight muscle weakness, mainly during adulthood, suggesting that CNTFR binds to 
a second ligand that is important for development. Modelling studies of the 
interleukin-6 family member cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) revealed 
structural similarities with CNTF, including the conservation of a site I domain 
involved in binding to CNTFR. Co-expression of CLC and CNTFR in mammalian cells 
generates a secreted composite cytokine, displaying activities on cells 
expressing the gp130-LIFR complex on their surface. Correspondingly, CLC-CNTFR 
activates gp130, LIFR and STAT3 signalling components, and enhances motor neuron 
survival. Together, these observations demonstrate that CNTFR induces the 
secretion of CLC, as well as mediating the functional responses of CLC.
