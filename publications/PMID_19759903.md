BACKGROUND: Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS) is a hereditary disease caused by 
mutations in the SBDS gene. SDS is clinically characterized by pancreatic 
insufficiency, skeletal abnormalities and bone marrow dysfunction. The 
hematologic abnormalities include neutropenia, neutrophil chemotaxis defects, 
and an increased risk of developing Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Although 
several studies have suggested that SBDS as a protein plays a role in ribosome 
processing/maturation, its impact on human neutrophil development and function 
remains to be clarified.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We observed that SBDS RNA and protein are 
expressed in the human myeloid leukemia PLB-985 cell line and in human 
hematopoietic progenitor cells by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. 
SBDS expression is downregulated during neutrophil differentiation. 
Additionally, we observed that the differentiation and proliferation capacity of 
SDS-patient bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells in a liquid 
differentiation system was reduced as compared to control cultures. 
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that SBDS co-localizes with the mitotic 
spindle and in vitro binding studies reveal a direct interaction of SBDS with 
microtubules. In interphase cells a perinuclear enrichment of SBDS protein which 
co-localized with the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) was observed. Also, 
we observed that transiently expressed SDS patient-derived SBDS-K62 or SBDS-C84 
mutant proteins could co-localize with the MTOC and mitotic spindle.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SBDS co-localizes with the mitotic spindle, suggesting 
a role for SBDS in the cell division process, which corresponds to the decreased 
proliferation capacity of SDS-patient bone marrow CD34(+) hematopoietic 
progenitor cells in our culture system and also to the neutropenia in SDS 
patients. A role in chromosome missegregation has not been clarified, since 
similar spatial and time-dependent localization is observed when patient-derived 
SBDS mutant proteins are studied. Thus, the increased risk of myeloid malignancy 
in SDS remains unexplained.
