Notch receptors control differentiation and contribute to pathologic states such 
as cancer by interacting directly with a transcription factor called CSL (for 
CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to induce expression of target genes. A 
number of Notch-regulated targets, including genes of the 
hairy/enhancer-of-split family in organisms ranging from Drosophila to humans, 
are characterized by paired CSL-binding sites in a characteristic head-to-head 
arrangement. Using a combination of structural and molecular approaches, we 
establish here that cooperative formation of dimeric Notch transcription 
complexes on promoters with paired sites is required to activate transcription. 
Our findings identify a mechanistic step that can account for the exquisite 
sensitivity of Notch target genes to variation in signal strength and 
developmental context, enable new strategies for sensitive and reliable 
identification of Notch target genes, and lay the groundwork for the development 
of Notch pathway inhibitors that are active on target genes containing paired 
sites.
