The Caenorhabditis elegans AMP-activated protein kinase AAK-2 is phosphorylated 
by LKB1 and is required for resistance to oxidative stress and for normal 
motility and foraging behavior.

AAK-2 is one of two alpha isoforms of the AMP-activated protein kinase in 
Caenorhabditis elegans and is involved in life span maintenance, stress 
responses, and germ cell cycle arrest upon dauer entry. We found that AAK-2 was 
phosphorylated at threonine 243 in response to paraquat treatment and that this 
phosphorylation depends on PAR-4, the C. elegans LKB1 homologue. Both aak-2 
mutation and par-4 knockdown increased the sensitivity of C. elegans worms to 
paraquat, and the double deficiency did not further increase sensitivity, 
indicating that aak-2 and par-4 act in a linear pathway. Both mutations also 
slowed body bending during locomotion and failed to reduce head oscillation in 
response to anterior touch. Consistent with this abnormal motility and 
behavioral response, expression of the AAK-2::green fluorescent protein fusion 
protein was observed in the ventral cord, some neurons, body wall muscle, 
pharynx, vulva, somatic gonad, and excretory cell. Our study suggests that AMPK 
can influence the behavior of C. elegans worms in addition to its well known 
function in metabolic control.
