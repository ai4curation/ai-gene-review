## Abstract

Sporulation-specific sigma factor sigma 29 of Bacillus subtilis is synthesized 
from a precursor protein, P31.

LaBell TL, Trempy JE, Haldenwang WG.

Evidence is presented that a sporulation-essential sigma factor of Bacillus 
subtilis, sigma 29, is synthesized as an inactive precursor (P31) and that its 
activation occurs by a developmentally regulated cleavage of 29 amino acids from 
the P31 amino terminus. A pulse-chase experiment demonstrated that sigma 29 was 
derived from a preexisting protein, with appearance of radioactively labeled 
sigma 29 paralleling the disappearance of labeled P31. The disappearance of 
pulse-labeled P31 did not occur when the experiment was done with a B. subtilis 
strain carrying a mutation in a locus (spoIIE) required for sigma 29, but not 
P31, synthesis. Microsequencing of sigma 29 protein revealed that its amino 
terminus originates at amino acid 30 of the P31 amino acid sequence. In order to 
test whether a proteolytic event alone could activate P31 to a protein with 
sigma 29-like properties, a fusion protein (P31*) containing most of P31 was 
overproduced in Escherichia coli and converted in vitro into a protein with the 
electrophoretic mobility of sigma 29 by limited treatment with Staphylococcus 
aureus V8 protease. Protease-treated P31*, but not untreated P31*, was capable 
of directing B. subtilis core RNA polymerase to specifically initiate RNA 
synthesis at a sigma 29-recognized promoter in vitro.
