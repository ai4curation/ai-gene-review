A gene from human chromosome 11p11.2 was isolated and was shown to suppress 
metastasis when introduced into rat AT6.1 prostate cancer cells. Expression of 
this gene, designated KAI1, was reduced in human cell lines derived from 
metastatic prostate tumors. KAI1 specifies a protein of 267 amino acids, with 
four hydrophobic and presumably transmembrane domains and one large 
extracellular hydrophilic domain with three potential N-glycosylation sites. 
KAI1 is evolutionarily conserved, is expressed in many human tissues, and 
encodes a member of a structurally distinct family of leukocyte surface 
glycoproteins. Decreased expression of this gene may be involved in the 
malignant progression of prostate and other cancers.
