The DNA-binding domain of Skn-1, a developmental transcription factor that 
specifies mesoderm in C. elegans, is shown by X-ray crystallography to have a 
novel fold in which a compact, monomeric, four-helix unit organizes two 
DNA-contact elements. At the C-terminus, a helix extends from the domain to 
occupy the major groove of DNA in a manner similar to bZip proteins. Skn-1, 
however, lacks the leucine zipper found in all bZips. Additional contacts with 
the DNA are made by a short basic segment at the N-terminus of the domain, 
reminiscent of the 'homeodomain arm'.
