The endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells contains a heat shock protein of 
approximately 70 kDa (hsp70) termed binding protein BiP that is thought to 
promote the folding and subunit assembly of newly synthesized proteins. To study 
BiP function, we placed the BiP-encoding gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
under the control of a regulated promoter and examined the effects of BiP 
depletion. Reduction of BiP protein to about 15% of normal levels led to a 
profound reduction in secretion of alpha factor and invertase. At the same time, 
unglycosylated precursors of these proteins accumulated intracellularly. The 
predominant form of the invertase precursor had undergone signal sequence 
cleavage but accumulated as a soluble species in the cytosol. In contrast, the 
alpha-factor precursor was exclusively in the signal-uncleaved form. It 
sedimented with microsomal membranes and was exposed at the cytoplasmic face in 
a protease-resistant form. These findings suggest that, in yeast, BiP function 
is required for translocation of soluble proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum 
at a stage beyond the initial nascent chain-membrane association.
