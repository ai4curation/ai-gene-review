Platelet glycoprotein (GP) V is a Mr 82,000 plasma membrane protein of unknown 
function that is cleaved by the potent platelet agonist, thrombin, to yield a Mr 
69,500 fragment (GPVf1). Platelet GPIb, a disulfide-linked alpha beta 
heterodimer (Mr 160,000) that forms a noncovalent complex with GPIX (Mr 22,000), 
functions as the platelet adhesion receptor for surface-bound von Willebrand 
factor. Association between GPV and GPIb-IX has been suggested by the finding 
that both proteins are deficient in the Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a bleeding 
disorder characterized by giant platelets and defective interaction with von 
Willebrand factor. Here we report that GPV and GPIb-IX are coprecipitated by 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against GPV, GPIb, or GPIX when platelets are 
solubilized in the mild detergent, digitonin. Treatment of digitonin 
immunopreciptates with the nonionic detergent, Nonidet P-40, released GPV from 
anti-GPIb and anti-GPIX mAb precipitates and GPIb-IX from the anti-GPV mAb 
precipitate. Removal of the Mr 45,000 amino-terminal part of GPIb alpha by 
treatment with elastase did not abrogate association of GPV with GPIb-IX, 
showing that the leucine-rich repeat sequences in GPIb alpha are not required 
for complex formation. Binding studies with 125I-labeled mAbs showed the 
presence of 24,370 GPIb-IX complexes and 11,170 molecules of GPV/platelet (n = 
5). These data show that the leucine-rich glycoproteins GPV and GPIb-IX form a 
noncovalent complex in the platelet membrane. GPV may play a role in the 
interaction of platelets with von Willebrand factor.
