Molecular mechanisms for the developmental stage and tissue-specific regulation 
of the erythropoietin (EPO) gene are poorly understood. Recent findings indicate 
a role of the Wilms tumor suppressor, Wt1, in the formation of the hematopoietic 
system. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that Wt1 is a transcriptional regulator 
of the EPO gene. Binding of the transcriptionally competent Wt1(-KTS) isoform to 
the minimal EPO promoter was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift 
assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Under normoxia, EPO expression was 
significantly increased in HEK 293 and HepG2 cells with forced expression of 
Wt1(-KTS). A reporter construct harboring the 117-bp minimal human EPO promoter 
was activated up to 20-fold by transient cotransfection of Wt1(-KTS) in 
different cell lines. Mutation of the Wt1 binding site in the EPO promoter 
abrogated this stimulatory effect of the Wt1(-KTS) protein. Hepatic Epo mRNA 
expression was significantly reduced in embryonic mice with homozygous Wt1 
deletion. Furthermore, Wt1 and EPO were colocalized in hepatocytes of the liver 
and in neuronal cells of the dorsal root ganglia in developing mice. Both 
proteins were also detected in Sertoli cells of the adult murine testis. In 
conclusion, we identified Wt1(-KTS) as a novel transcriptional activator for the 
tissue-specific expression of the EPO gene.
