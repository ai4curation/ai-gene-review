Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis has been implicated in the 
development of multiple diseases. However, the in vivo signaling pathways are 
still not fully understood. In this report, through the use of genetically 
deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and their matched wild-type controls, 
we have demonstrated that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway mediated by Apaf-1 
is an integral part of ER stress-induced apoptosis and that ER stress activates 
different caspases through Apaf-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In 
search of the molecular link between ER stress and the mitochondrial apoptotic 
pathway, we have discovered that in MEFs, ER stress selectively activates 
BH3-only proteins PUMA and NOXA at the transcript level through the tumor 
suppressor gene p53. In p53(-/-) MEFs, ER stress-induced apoptosis is partially 
suppressed. The p53-independent apoptotic pathway may be mediated by C/EBP 
homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-12, as their activation is intact in 
p53(-/-) MEFs. In multiple MEF lines, p53 is primarily nuclear and its level is 
elevated upon ER stress. To establish the role of NOXA and PUMA in ER 
stress-induced apoptosis, we have shown that, in MEFs deficient in NOXA or PUMA, 
ER stress-induced apoptosis is reduced. Reversibly, overexpression of NOXA or 
PUMA induces apoptosis as evidenced by the activation of BAK and caspase-7. Our 
results provide new evidence that, in MEFs, in addition to PUMA, p53 and NOXA 
are novel components of the ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway, and both 
contribute to ER stress-induced apoptosis.
