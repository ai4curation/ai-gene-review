Tag7 (also known as peptidoglycan recognition protein PGRP-S, PGLYRP1), an 
innate immunity protein, interacts with Hsp70 to form a stable Tag7-Hsp70 
complex with cytotoxic activity against some tumor cell lines. In this study, we 
have analyzed the programmed cell death mechanisms that are induced when cells 
interact with the Tag7-Hsp70 complex, which was previously shown to be released 
by human lymphocytes and is cytotoxic to cancer cells. We show that this complex 
induces both apoptotic and necroptotic processes in the cells. Apoptosis follows 
the classic caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation pathway. Inhibition of apoptosis 
leads to a switch to the RIP1-dependent necroptosis. Both of these cytotoxic 
processes are initiated by the involvement of TNFR1, a receptor for TNF-α. Our 
results suggest that the Tag7-Hsp70 complex is a novel ligand for this receptor. 
One of its components, the innate immunity protein Tag7, can bind to the TNFR1 
receptor, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxic actions of the Tag7-Hsp70 complex and 
TNF-α, an acquired immunity cytokine.
