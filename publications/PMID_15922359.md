Streptococcal surface dehydrogenase (SDH) is a multifunctional, anchorless 
protein present on the surface of group A Streptococcus (GAS). It plays a 
regulatory role in GAS-mediated intracellular signaling events in human 
pharyngeal cells. Using ligand-binding assays, we have identified an 
approximately 55 kDa protein as an SDH-specific receptor protein on the surface 
of Detroit human pharyngeal cells. LC-MS/MS analyses identified this SDH-binding 
pharyngeal cell-surface-exposed membrane-bound protein as uPAR (urokinase 
plasminogen activator receptor)/CD87. Ligand-binding assays also revealed that 
only the N-terminal domain (D1) of uPAR bound to SDH. uPAR-D1 more specifically 
bound to the C-terminal alpha-helix and two immediate flanking regions of the 
S-loop of the SDH molecule. Site-directed mutagenesis in GAS resulting in SDH 
with altered C-terminal ends, and the removal of uPAR from pharyngeal cells by 
phosphatidylinositol-phopsholipase C treatment decreased GAS ability to adhere 
to pharyngeal cells. When compared to uninfected Detroit pharyngeal cells, 
GAS-infected pharyngeal cells showed a transient but a significant increase in 
the expression of uPAR-specific mRNA, and a prolonged recycling process of uPAR 
on the cell surface. Together, these results indicate that the specific 
streptococcal surface protein-pharyngeal cell receptor interaction mediated by 
SDH and uPAR is modulated during GAS infection of human pharyngeal cells. This 
interaction significantly contributes to bacterial adherence and thus may play a 
significant role in GAS pathogenesis by regulating intracellular signaling 
events in pharyngeal cells.
