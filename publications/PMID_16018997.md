The ciliary rootlet is a large striated fibrous network originating from basal 
bodies in ciliated cells. To explore its postulated role in intracellular 
transport, we investigated the interaction between kinesin light chains (KLCs) 
and rootletin, the structural component of ciliary rootlets. We show here that 
KLCs directly interact with rootletin and are located along ciliary rootlets. 
Their interactions are mediated by the heptad repeats of KLCs. Further studies 
found that these interactions tethered kinesin heavy chains along ciliary 
rootlets. However, the ciliary rootlet-bound kinesin-1 did not recruit 
microtubules or move along ciliary rootlets. Additionally, amyloid precursor 
protein (APP; a kinesin-1 vesicular cargo receptor) and presenilin 1 (a presumed 
cargo of APP/kinesin-1) were found to be enriched along the rootletin fibers, 
suggesting that the interaction between ciliary rootlets and kinesin-1 recruits 
APP and presenilin 1 along ciliary rootlets. These findings indicate that 
ciliary rootlets may provide a scaffold for kinesin-1 vesicular cargos and, 
thus, play a role in the intracellular transport in ciliated cells.
