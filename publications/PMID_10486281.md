The serum concentration of the inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 
protein (ITIH4) increases (from 1.4-3 times) in male patients suffering of 
different acute-phase processes (myocardial infarction, unstable angina or 
programmed surgery). The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) in these 
samples ranged from 15 microg/ml to 133 microg/ml. Using the hepatocarcinoma 
HepG2 cell line we have observed up-regulation of ITIH4 mRNA expression upon 
dose-response treatments with interleukin-6 (IL-6). This effect correlates with 
the increase of radiolabeled ITIH4 in the cellular media of (35)S-labeled HepG2 
cells treated with the cytokine. A similar effect was observed for haptoglobin 
mRNA, used as a control for acute-phase protein expression. IL-1beta, although 
up-regulating the expression of alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein in these cells, did 
not induce any effect in the expression of ITIH4. No changes were observed after 
TNF-alpha treatments. The results presented here indicate that ITIH4 is a type 
II acute-phase protein in humans.
