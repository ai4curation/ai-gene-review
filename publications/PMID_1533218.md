Immunochemical studies demonstrated the specific accumulation of subunit c of 
mitochondrial ATP synthase in the brain homogenates of late infantile and 
juvenile forms of Batten's disease. It is not stored in the infantile form. 
Storage of subunit alpha of mitochondrial ATP synthase and cytochrome c oxidase 
subunit IV, an inner membrane protein of mitochondria was not detected in the 
brains. There was also no difference in the levels of cathepsin B between the 
two forms of Batten's disease and controls. In cultured skin fibroblasts subunit 
c accumulates in the late infantile form, whereas it does not in other lysosomal 
storage diseases. Crude mitochondrial lysosomal preparations of control 
fibroblasts were separated into high-density fractions rich in a lysosomal 
marker and low-density fractions rich in a mitochondrial marker on Percoll 
density gradients. Subunit c was mostly recovered in low-density mitochondrial 
fractions, but in cells from the late infantile disease a part of subunit c was 
recovered in the high-density lysosomal fractions. Immunolocalization studies 
demonstrated a dot-like staining of storage materials for subunit c in the cells 
from late infantile patients and the staining pattern of subunit c is similar to 
that of a lysosomal membrane marker, lgp120. Immunostaining failed to detect 
subunit c in control cells. These results indicate a specific accumulation of 
subunit c in lysosomes, and suggest that the two forms of Batten's disease are 
caused by a specific failure in the degradation of subunit c.
