Rim1, a brain-specific Rab3a-binding protein, localizes to the presynaptic 
cytomatrix and plays an important role in synaptic transmission and synaptic 
plasticity. Rim2, a homologous protein, is more ubiquitously expressed and is 
found in neuroendocrine cells as well as in brain. Both Rim1 and Rim2 contain 
multiple domains, including an N-terminal zinc finger, which in Rim1 strongly 
enhances secretion in chromaffin and PC12 cells. The yeast two-hybrid technique 
identified 14-3-3 proteins as ligands of the N-terminal domain. In vitro protein 
binding experiments confirmed a high-affinity interaction between the N terminus 
of Rim1 and 14-3-3. The N-terminal domain of Rim2 also bound 14-3-3. The binding 
domains were localized to a short segment just C-terminal to the zinc finger. 
14-3-3 proteins bind to specific phosphoserine residues. Alkaline phosphatase 
treatment of N-terminal domains of Rim1 and Rim2 almost completely inhibited the 
binding of 14-3-3. Two serine residues in Rim1 (Ser-241 and Ser-287) and one 
serine residue in Rim2 (Ser-335) were required for 14-3-3 binding. Incubation 
with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II greatly stimulated the 
interaction of recombinant N-terminal Rim but not the S241/287A mutant with 
14-3-3, again indicating the importance of the phosphorylation of these residues 
for the binding. Rabphilin3, another Rab3a effector, also bound 14-3-3. 
Serine-to-alanine mutations identified Ser-274 as the likely phosphorylated 
residue to which 14-3-3 binds. Because the phosphorylation of this residue had 
been shown to be stimulated upon depolarization in brain slices, the interaction 
of 14-3-3 with Rabphilin3 may be important in the dynamic function of central 
nervous system neurons.
