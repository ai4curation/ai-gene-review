After axotomy, expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is greatly reduced in 
the superior cervical ganglion (SCG); however, the molecular events involved in 
this response remain unknown. Here, we first examined AChE mRNA levels in the 
brain of transgenic mice that overexpress human HuD. Both in situ hybridization 
and reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that AChE transcript levels were 
increased by more than twofold in the hippocampus of HuD transgenic mice. 
Additionally, direct interaction between the HuD transgene product and AChE mRNA 
was observed. Next, we examined the role of HuD in regulating AChE expression in 
intact and axotomized rat SCG neurons. After axotomy of the adult rat SCG 
neurons, AChE transcript levels decreased by 50 and 85% by the first and fourth 
day, respectively. In vitro mRNA decay assays indicated that the decrease in 
AChE mRNA levels resulted from changes in the stability of presynthesized 
transcripts. A combination of approaches performed using the region that 
directly encompasses an adenylate and uridylate (AU)-rich element within the 
AChE 3'-untranslated region demonstrated a decrease in RNA-protein complexes in 
response to axotomy of the SCG and, specifically, a decrease in HuD binding. 
After axotomy, HuD transcript and protein levels also decreased. Using a herpes 
simplex virus construct containing the human HuD sequence to infect SCG neurons 
in vivo, we found that AChE and GAP-43 mRNA levels were maintained in the SCG 
after axotomy. Together, the results of this study demonstrate that AChE 
expression in neurons of the rat SCG is regulated via post-transcriptional 
mechanisms that involve the AU-rich element and HuD.
