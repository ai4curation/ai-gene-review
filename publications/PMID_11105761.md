Nmd3p from yeast is required for the export of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit 
from the nucleus (Ho et al., 2000). Here, we show that Nmd3p forms a stable 
complex with free 60S subunits. Using an epitope-tagged Nmd3p, we show that free 
60S subunits can be coimmunoprecipitated with Nmd3p. The interaction was 
specific for 60S subunits; 40S subunits were not coimmunoprecipitated. Using 
this coprecipitation technique and pulse-chase labeling of ribosomal subunit 
proteins we showed that Nmd3p bound nascent subunits, consistent with its role 
in export. However, under conditions in which ribosome biogenesis was inhibited 
(e.g., inhibition of transcription with thiolutin, inhibition of transcription 
of ribosomal protein and RNA genes in a sly1-1 mutant at nonpermissive 
temperature, and inhibition of translation in a conditional prt1 mutant), Nmd3p 
remained associated with 60S subunits. In addition, Nmd3delta120, a truncated 
protein that lacked a nuclear localization signal, retained 60S binding. These 
results suggest that Nmd3p recruits nascent 60S subunits into the pool of free 
60S subunits and exchanges on 60S subunits as they recycle during translation.
