The avascularity of cardiac valves is abrogated in several valvular heart 
diseases (VHDs). This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying 
valvular avascularity and its correlation with VHD. Chondromodulin-I, an 
antiangiogenic factor isolated from cartilage, is abundantly expressed in 
cardiac valves. Gene targeting of chondromodulin-I resulted in enhanced Vegf-A 
expression, angiogenesis, lipid deposition and calcification in the cardiac 
valves of aged mice. Echocardiography showed aortic valve thickening, 
calcification and turbulent flow, indicative of early changes in aortic 
stenosis. Conditioned medium obtained from cultured valvular interstitial cells 
strongly inhibited tube formation and mobilization of endothelial cells and 
induced their apoptosis; these effects were partially inhibited by 
chondromodulin-I small interfering RNA. In human VHD, including cases associated 
with infective endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and atherosclerosis, VEGF-A 
expression, neovascularization and calcification were observed in areas of 
chondromodulin-I downregulation. These findings provide evidence that 
chondromodulin-I has a pivotal role in maintaining valvular normal function by 
preventing angiogenesis that may lead to VHD.
