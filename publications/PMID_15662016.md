Cell lineage specification depends on both gene activation and gene silencing, 
and in the differentiation of T helper progenitors to Th1 or Th2 effector cells, 
this requires the action of two opposing transcription factors, T-bet and 
GATA-3. T-bet is essential for the development of Th1 cells, and GATA-3 performs 
an equivalent role in Th2 development. We report that T-bet represses Th2 
lineage commitment through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between the two 
transcription factors that interferes with the binding of GATA-3 to its target 
DNA. These results provide a novel function for tyrosine phosphorylation of a 
transcription factor in specifying alternate fates of a common progenitor cell.
