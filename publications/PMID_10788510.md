Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen capable of causing a wide 
spectrum of diseases in humans and animals. This bacterium expresses a variety 
of virulence factors that participate in the process of infection. These include 
MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) 
that mediate the adherence of the bacteria to host extracellular matrix 
components, such as collagen, fibronectin (Fn), and fibrinogen (Fg). Two 
Fn-binding MSCRAMMs, FnbpA and FnbpB, have been previously identified. The Fn 
binding activity has been localized to the approximately 40-amino acid residue D 
repeats in the C-terminal part of these proteins. However, no biological 
activity has yet been attributed to the N-terminal A regions of these proteins. 
These regions exhibit substantial amino acid sequence identity to the A regions 
of other staphylococcal MSCRAMMs, including ClfA, ClfB, and SdrG (Fbe), all of 
which bind Fg. This raises the question of whether the Fn-binding MSCRAMMs can 
also bind specifically to Fg. In this report, we show that a recombinant form of 
the A region of FnbpA does specifically recognize Fg. We localize the binding 
site in Fg for recombinant FnbpA to the gamma-chain, in particular to the 
C-terminal residues of this polypeptide, the site also recognized by ClfA. In 
addition, we demonstrate that recombinant FnbpA can compete with ClfA for 
binding to both immobilized and soluble Fg. By the use of surface plasmon 
resonance spectroscopy and fluorescence polarization, we determine the 
dissociation equilibrium constant for the interaction of recombinant FnbpA with 
intact immobilized Fg and with a synthetic C-terminal gamma-chain peptide, 
respectively. Finally, by overexpressing FnbpA in a mutant strain of S. aureus 
that lacks the expression of both ClfA and ClfB, we show that native FnbpA can 
mediate the interaction of S. aureus with soluble Fg.
