Hsp90 is an essential chaperone for more than 200 client proteins in eukaryotic 
cells. The human genome encodes two highly similar cytosolic Hsp90 proteins 
called Hsp90α and Hsp90β. Most of the client proteins can interact with either 
Hsp90 protein; however, only a handful client proteins and one co-chaperone that 
interact specifically with one of the Hsp90 isoforms were identified. Structural 
differences underlying these isoform-specific interactions were not studied. 
Here we report for the first time that the Hsp90 co-chaperone Aha1 interacts 
preferentially with Hsp90α. The distinction depends on the middle domain of 
Hsp90. The middle domain of Hsp90α is also responsible for the slow growth 
phenotype of yeasts that express this isoform as a sole source of Hsp90. These 
results suggest that differences in the middle domain of Hsp90α and Hsp90β may 
be responsible for the isoform-specific interactions with selected proteins. 
Also shown here within, we determine that preferential chaperoning of cIAP1 by 
Hsp90β is mediated by the N-terminal domain of this isoform.
