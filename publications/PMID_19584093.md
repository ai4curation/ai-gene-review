AIMP2 (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase interacting multifunctional protein 2; also 
known as JTV-1) was first identified as p38 in a macromolecular protein complex 
that consisted of nine different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and two other 
auxiliary factors. AIMP2 also plays pivotal roles in the regulation of cell 
proliferation and death. Although AIMP2 was previously shown to augment 
TNFalpha-induced cell death, its working mechanism in this signal pathway was 
not understood. Here, we investigate the functional significance and mode of 
action of AIMP2 in TNFalpha signaling. TNFalpha-induced cell death was 
compromised in AIMP2-deficient or -suppressed cells and exogenous 
supplementation of AIMP2 augmented apoptotic sensitivity to TNFalpha signaling. 
This activity was confirmed by the AIMP2-dependent increase of IkappaB and 
suppression of NFkappaB. We found binding of AIMP2 to TRAF2, a key player in the 
TNFalpha signaling pathway. AIMP2 augmented the association of an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase, c-IAP1, with TRAF2, causing ubiquitin-dependent degradation of TRAF2. 
These findings suggest that AIMP2 can mediate the pro-apoptotic activity of 
TNFalpha via the downregulation of TRAF2 expression.
