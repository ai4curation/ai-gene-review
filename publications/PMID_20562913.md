Upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and subsequent increases 
in extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling are implicated in 
prostate cancer progression. Impaired endocytic downregulation of EGFR also 
contributes to oncogenic phenotypes such as metastasis. Thus, understanding the 
roles of divergent signaling pathways in the regulation of EGFR trafficking and 
EGFR-driven invasive migration may enable the development of more effective 
therapies. In this study, we use the human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and 
PC3, to investigate the effects of both the ERK and Akt pathways on epidermal 
growth factor (EGF)-mediated EGFR signaling, trafficking and cell motility. We 
show that DU145 and PC3 cells overexpress EGFR and migrate in a ligand 
(EGF)-dependent manner. Next, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ERK 
(but not Akt) signaling enhances EGF-induced EGFR activation, ubiquitination and 
downregulation, and may lead to enhanced receptor turnover. These findings 
negatively correlate with ERK-mediated threonine phosphorylation of EGFR, 
implicating it as a possible mechanism. Further, we uncover that EGF promotes 
disassembly of cell-cell junctions, downregulation of E-cadherin and 
upregulation of the transcriptional repressor, Snail, typical characteristics of 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These effects are dependent on 
activation of Akt, as inhibition of Akt signaling abolishes EGF/EGFR-driven cell 
migration and EMT. Knockdown of endogenous Snail also prevents EGFR-mediated 
downregulation of E-cadherin, EMT and cell migration. Surprisingly, inhibition 
of the ERK pathway augments EGFR-dependent motility, occurring concomitantly 
with elevation of EGF-induced Akt activity. Collectively, our results suggest 
that EGF-triggered ERK activation has profound feedback on EGFR signaling and 
trafficking by EGFR threonine phosphorylation, and Akt has a pivotal role in 
EGFR-mediated cell migration by activating EMT. More important, our results also 
suggest that therapeutic targeting of ERK signaling may have undesirable 
outcomes (for example, augmenting EGFR-driven motility).
