Defective DNA damage responses in the nervous system can result in 
neurodegeneration or tumorigenesis. Despite the importance of DNA damage 
signalling, the neural function of many critical DNA repair factors is unclear. 
BRCA2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DNA and the prevention 
of diseases including Fanconi Anemia and cancer. We determined the role of BRCA2 
during brain development by inactivating murine Brca2 throughout neural tissues. 
In striking contrast to early embryonic lethality after germ-line inactivation, 
Brca2(LoxP/LoxP);Nestin-cre mice were viable. However, Brca2 loss profoundly 
affected neurogenesis, particularly during embryonic and postnatal neural 
development. These neurological defects arose from DNA damage as 
Brca2(LoxP/LoxP);Nestin-cre mice showed extensive gammaH2AX in neural tissue and 
p53 deficiency restored brain histology but lead to rapid formation of 
medulloblastoma brain tumors. In contrast, loss of the Atm kinase did not 
markedly attenuate apoptosis after Brca2 loss, but did partially restore 
cerebellar morphology, supporting a genomic surveillance function for ATM during 
neurogenesis. These data illustrate the importance of Brca2 during nervous 
system development and underscore the tissue-specific requirements for DNA 
repair factors.

Defective DNA damage responses in the nervous system can result in neurodegeneration or tumorigenesis. Despite the importance of DNA damage signalling, the neural function of many critical DNA repair factors is unclear. BRCA2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DNA and the prevention of diseases including Fanconi Anemia and cancer. We determined the role of BRCA2 during brain development by inactivating murine Brca2 throughout neural tissues. In striking contrast to early embryonic lethality after germ-line inactivation, Brca2LoxP/LoxP;Nestin-cre mice were viable. However, Brca2 loss profoundly affected neurogenesis, particularly during embryonic and postnatal neural development. These neurological defects arose from DNA damage as Brca2LoxP/LoxP;Nestin-cre mice showed extensive Î³H2AX in neural tissue and p53 deficiency restored brain histology but lead to rapid formation of medulloblastoma brain tumors. In contrast, loss of the Atm kinase did not markedly attenuate apoptosis after Brca2 loss, but did partially restore cerebellar morphology, supporting a genomic surveillance function for ATM during neurogenesis. These data illustrate the importance of Brca2 during nervous system development and underscore the tissue-specific requirements for DNA repair factors.
