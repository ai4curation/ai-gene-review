A genetic screen for GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) or other negative 
regulators of the Rac/Rho family GTPase Cdc42p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
identified ZDS1, a gene encoding a protein of 915 amino acids. Sequence from the 
yeast genome project identified a homolog, ZDS2, whose predicted product of 942 
amino acids is 38% identical in sequence to Zds1p. Zds1p and Zds2p have no 
detectable homology to known Rho-GAPs or to other known proteins. However, by 
several assays, it appears that overexpression of either Zds1p or Zds2p 
decreases the level of Cdc42p activity. Deletion analysis also suggests that 
Zds1p and Zds2p are at least partially overlapping in function. Deletion of ZDS2 
produced no obvious phenotype, and deletion of ZDS1 produced no obvious 
phenotype other than a mild effect on cell shape. However, the zds1 zds2 double 
mutant grew slowly with an apparent mitotic delay and produced elongated cells 
and buds with other evidence of abnormal morphogenesis. A glutathione 
S-transferase-Zds1p fusion protein that fully complemented the double mutant 
localized to presumptive bud sites and the tips of small buds. The similarity of 
this localization to that of Cdc42p suggests that Zds1p may interact directly 
with Cdc42p. As ZDS1 and ZDS2 have recently been identified also by numerous 
other groups studying a wide range of biological phenomena, the roles of Cdc42p 
in intracellular signaling may be more diverse than has previously been 
appreciated.
