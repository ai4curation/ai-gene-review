The primary structures of three human forms of secretory carrier membrane 
proteins (SCAMPs) have been deduced from full-length clones isolated from a HeLa 
cell cDNA library and confirmed by a combination of comparison to expressed 
sequence tags, microsequencing of purified protein, and in vitro transcription 
and translation. The structures indicated that SCAMPs are highly related 
products of distinct genes, and that the sequence identity of an individual 
SCAMP between different mammalian species is almost complete. Analysis of the 
distribution of SCAMPs among different mammalian tissues and cells indicates 
parallel expression of polypeptides and cognate mRNAs, and indicates that the 
three SCAMPs are usually but not always expressed together. The apparent M(r)s 
of two SCAMPs (1 and 2) do not vary appreciably among species, while that of the 
third (SCAMP3) is approximately 2 kDa larger in rodent cells than in humans. 
Examination of the codistribution of the three forms within individual cells 
using double label immunofluorescence indicates extensive colocalization of 
SCAMP2 and SCAMP3 with endogenous SCAMP1, however, subcellular regions enriched 
for a particular SCAMP are readily visible. These findings suggest that the 
SCAMPs may largely function at the same sites during vesicular transport rather 
than in separate post-Golgi recycling pathways.
