Apart from serving as a prosthetic group in globins and enzymes, heme is a key 
regulator controlling a wide range of molecular and cellular processes involved 
in oxygen sensing and utilization. To gain insights into molecular mechanisms of 
heme signaling and oxygen sensing in eukaryotes, we investigated the yeast 
heme-responsive transcriptional activator HAP1. HAP1 activity is regulated 
precisely and tightly by heme. Here we show that in the absence of heme, HAP1 
forms a biochemically distinctive higher-order complex. Our data suggest that 
this complex contains HAP1 and four other cellular proteins including Hsp82 and 
Ydj1. The formation of this complex is directly correlated with HAP1 repression 
in the absence of heme, and mutational or heme disruption of the complex 
correlates with HAP1 activation, suggesting that this complex is responsible for 
heme regulation of HAP1 activity. Further, we determined HAP1 domains required 
for heme regulation: three domains-the dimerization domain, the heme domain, and 
the HRM7 (heme-responsive motif 7) domain-cooperate to form the higher-order 
complex and mediate heme regulation. Strikingly, we uncovered a novel function 
for the HAP1 dimerization domain: it not only allows dimerization but also 
provides critical functions in heme regulation and transcriptional activation. 
Our studies provide significant insights into the molecular events leading to 
heme activation of HAP1 and may shed light on molecular mechanisms of various 
heme-controlled biological processes in diverse organisms.
