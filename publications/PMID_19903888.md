In metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) cells, imbalance between cell survival and 
death signals such as constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K)-Akt and inactivation of apoptosis-stimulated kinase (ASK1)-JNK pathways 
is often detected. Here, we show that DAB2IP protein, often down-regulated in 
PCa, is a potent growth inhibitor by inducing G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and is 
proapoptotic in response to stress. Gain of function study showed that DAB2IP 
can suppress the PI3K-Akt pathway and enhance ASK1 activation leading to cell 
apoptosis, whereas loss of DAB2IP expression resulted in PI3K-Akt activation and 
ASK1-JNK inactivation leading to accelerated PCa growth in vivo. Moreover, 
glandular epithelia from DAB2IP(-/-) animal exhibited hyperplasia and apoptotic 
defect. Structural functional analyses of DAB2IP protein indicate that both 
proline-rich (PR) and PERIOD-like (PER) domains, in addition to the critical 
role of C2 domain in ASK1 activity, are important for modulating PI3K-Akt 
activity. Thus, DAB2IP is a scaffold protein capable of bridging both survival 
and death signal molecules, which implies its role in maintaining cell 
homeostasis.

Abstract

In metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) cells, imbalance between cell survival and death signals such as constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt and inactivation of apoptosis-stimulated kinase (ASK1)-JNK pathways is often detected. Here, we show that DAB2IP protein, often down-regulated in PCa, is a potent growth inhibitor by inducing G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest and is proapoptotic in response to stress. Gain of function study showed that DAB2IP can suppress the PI3K-Akt pathway and enhance ASK1 activation leading to cell apoptosis, whereas loss of DAB2IP expression resulted in PI3K-Akt activation and ASK1-JNK inactivation leading to accelerated PCa growth in vivo. Moreover, glandular epithelia from DAB2IP −/− animal exhibited hyperplasia and apoptotic defect. Structural functional analyses of DAB2IP protein indicate that both proline-rich (PR) and PERIOD-like (PER) domains, in addition to the critical role of C2 domain in ASK1 activity, are important for modulating PI3K-Akt activity. Thus, DAB2IP is a scaffold protein capable of bridging both survival and death signal molecules, which implies its role in maintaining cell homeostasis.

Discussion

Altered homeostatic control in cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis underlies many diseases particularly cancer malignancy. In many cancer types, including PCa, the PI3K-Akt signaling axis has been shown as a dominant survival pathway ( 1 , 31 ). In contrast, insufficient activation of ASK1, an important mediator of apoptotic signaling responses to many stress stimuli, and/or its downstream MKK4-JNK-c-Jun pathway has been correlated with the development of aggressive PCa ( 32 ). Although there is cross-talk between the Akt and ASK1 pathways ( 13 , 33 ), the mechanism of how these signal pathways are coordinated to maintain cell homeostasis in response to diverse stimulus remains undetermined. Our data ( Figs. 2 and 3 ) have unveiled that DAB2IP as a scaffold protein sequesters both Akt and ASK1 and counterbalances the activity of each distinct kinase by modulating their phosphorylation status in response to different signals. Mechanistically, there are several components in the cell-death machinery that could be common target(s) for Akt or ASK1. For example, Bad is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that promotes cell death by forming a nonfunctional heterodimer with the survival factor Bcl-XL. Phosphorylation of Bad by Akt prevents this interaction, restoring Bcl-XL's antiapoptotic function ( 34 ). In addition, Akt inhibits the catalytic activity of a prodeath protease, caspase-9, through phosphorylation ( 35 ). On the other hand, ASK1 can activate JNK or p38, which can activate several proapoptotic targets in the Bcl-2 family such as Bim and Bax, respectively ( 36 ). Thus, the presence of DAB2IP is expected to augment the apoptotic effect via inactivating Akt and activating ASK1.

The p85, a regulatory subunit of PI3K, contains SH3, BCR, two SH2 domains, and an inter-SH2 domain that binds constitutively to the p110 catalytic subunit. In general, the SH3 and BCR domains have a negative role in modulating PI3K kinase activity ( 3 ), which is due to the conformational changes in the p85–p110 complex ( 1 ). Thus, the SH3 or BCR domain is considered as an intrinsic inhibitor toward the catalytic activity of p110 subunit ( 1 , 2 ). Clearly, our results ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 ) indicate that the first four prolines in the DAB2IP-PR domain is a critical binding site for the p85-SH3 domain. Despite that, this interaction has no effect on p85 phosphorylation, and DAB2IP is able to inhibit PI3K activity by sequestering and stabilizing p85-p110 complex and then further inactivating Akt ( Fig. 4 ). Because DAB2IP is able to relocate from membrane to cytosol in the presence of TNF-α ( 25 ), we believe that the formation of DAB2IP-p85-p110 complex may prevent them from translocating to the cell membrane, which provides additional evidence for the inhibitory effect of the p85-SH3 domain on PI3K activity. Taken together, DAB2IP has a similar function with PTEN as a negative regulator in PI3K-Akt pathway. Nevertheless, DAB2IP is a scaffold protein associated with various effector molecules rather than a phosphatase.

Noticeably, DAB2IP functions as a key ”platform” to modulate various signals by recruiting PI3K, Akt, and ASK1 proteins via its individual binding domain ( Fig. 6 E ). For example, LY- or TNF-α-mediated different pathways eventually merge into the same downstream effect—Akt inactivation and ASK1 activation. It is known that TNF-α-elicited ASK1 activation requires several sequential steps ( 37 – 39 ), and we have shown that DAB2IP dissociates ASK1 inhibitor 14-3-3 from its C terminus and then facilitates ASK1 activation ( 17 ). In this study, we further show that the DAB2IP-mediated binding and inhibition of PI3K-Akt also contributes to ASK1 activation ( Fig. 4 D ). In a feedback loop, ASK1 increases S604 phosphorylation in DAB2IP, which significantly enhances the binding ability of DAB2IP to Akt and PI3K complex ( Fig. 5 and Fig. S4 ), implying that this phosphorylation site relates to the conformational changes of DAB2IP from inactive to active status. Thus, the ASK1–DAB2IP–PI3K complex is a “signal platform” to counterbalance between cell survival and apoptosis, which exists not only in PCa or normal prostate epithelial cells but also in other cell type as well ( Fig. S6 ). Based on these outcomes, DAB2IP is capable of enhancing the effect of targeted therapy with pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K or TNF-α. Given the possible off-target effect of these agents at higher dosage, we believe that restoring DAB2IP expression in target tissue by either genetic or inductive approach is expected to increase the therapeutic index of these agents.

Overall, as illustrated in Fig. 6 E , DAB2IP is a unique scaffold protein that can modulate cell growth, survival, and death via several signaling pathways such as Ras-Raf-ERK, PI3K-Akt and ASK1-JNK. Thus, loss of DAB2IP leads to imbalance of cell survival and apoptosis pathways, which plays a significant role in tumor development ( Fig. 6 ).
