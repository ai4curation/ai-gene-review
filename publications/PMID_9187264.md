We examined the effects of histamine and its agonists on the expression of the 
c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogenes at the transcriptional and translational levels 
in the human promonocytic U937 cell line. Histamine transiently increased cAMP 
and c-fos expression through H2 receptors. Dibutyryl cAMP also increased c-fos 
mRNA and protein, and levels remained elevated even after 12 hr of treatment. 
Dose-dependence studies using histamine and dimaprit showed that the EC50 values 
for cAMP production and c-fos increase were similar, suggesting that cAMP might 
be involved in c-fos induction via H2 receptors. Furthermore, studies carried 
out using H7, a protein kinase A/protein kinase C inhibitor, blocked c-fos 
induction, whereas no effect was observed with bisindolylmaleimide, a specific 
protein kinase C inhibitor. No modification of c-myc expression could be 
detected on treatment with histamine or its analogues. Nevertheless, dibutyryl 
cAMP induced a down-regulation of the levels of this proto-oncogene. In 
addition, dibutyryl cAMP inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, 
whereas histamine failed to affect proliferation and differentiation of U937 
cells. Cells pretreated with dimaprit showed a decrease in the cAMP response to 
subsequent addition of H2 agonists, whereas the cAMP response to prostaglandin 
E2 remained unaltered. This homologous mechanism of H2 receptor desensitization 
was time dependent. These results indicate that histamine activates several 
mechanisms involved in the induction of differentiation, such as cAMP and c-fos 
production, but fails to promote differentiation of U937 cells, apparently due 
to the rapid desensitization of H2 receptors.
