Accumulating data show that the tyrosine protein kinase Zap-70 plays an 
essential role in T cell receptor-mediated signal transduction. However, the 
model of action, as well as the physiologically relevant substrates of Zap-70, 
have not been determined. We have attempted to identify a 120-kD 
tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (p120) that associates with Zap-70 in activated 
T lymphocytes. The results of our analyses showed that p120 is largely encoded 
by the c-cbl protooncogene. Furthermore, the association of Zap-70 with c-Cbl 
was shown to be induced by T cell receptor stimulation, implying that it 
required posttranslational modification of one or both of these products. FynT, 
but not Lck, also associated with c-Cbl in activated T cells. Finally, using a 
heterologous system, it was demonstrated that the ability of Zap-70 to cause 
tyrosine phosphorylation of p120c-cbl was dependent on Lck- or FynT-mediated 
signals. As c-Cbl can associate with several other signaling molecules, it may 
couple Zap-70 to downstream effectors during T cell activation.
