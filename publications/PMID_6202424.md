A variant form of beta-actin in a mutant of KB cells resistant to cytochalasin 
B.

Toyama S, Toyama S.

Lines of KB cells resistant to cytochalasin B have been isolated and 
characterized. The mutant Cyt 1 exhibits increased cross-resistance to 
cytochalasin E. Cyt 1 cells bind less cytochalasin B than parental KB cells. 
Two-dimensional gel analysis shows that Cyt 1 cells carry an alteration in 
beta-actin. This is further confirmed by one-dimensional peptide analysis. The 
altered beta-actin (beta'-actin) is synthesized when poly(A)+ RNA from Cyt 1 
cells is translated in a reticulocyte-cell-free translation system. These 
results suggest that the primary site of action of cytochalasin B on cellular 
motility processes is beta-actin.
