Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is critical to resolution of inflammation. High 
mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), a mediator of inflammation, has been shown 
to diminish phagocytosis through binding to phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on 
the surface of apoptotic neutrophils. However, it is currently unknown whether 
HMGB1 also modulates the activity of receptors involved in PS recognition on the 
surface of phagocytes. In the present studies, we found that preincubation of 
macrophages with HMGB1 decreased their ability to engulf apoptotic neutrophils 
or thymocytes. Preincubation of macrophages with HMGB1 prevented the enhancement 
of efferocytosis resulting from exposure to milk fat globule EGF factor 8 
(MFG-E8), an opsonin that bridges PS and α(v)β(3) as well as α(v)β(5)-integrins 
on the surface of phagocytes. The inhibitory effect of HMGB1 on the phagocytic 
activity of macrophages was prevented by preincubation of HMGB1 with soluble 
α(v)β(3), but not with soluble α(v)β(5). HMGB1 colocalized with the 
β(3)-integrin on the cell membrane of macrophages and bound to soluble α(v)β(3), 
but not to soluble α(v)β(5). HMGB1 suppressed the interaction between MFG-E8 and 
α(v)β(3). HMGB1 also inhibited intracellular signaling events, including ERK 
phosphorylation and Rac-1 activation, which are activated in macrophages during 
phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. These results demonstrate that HMGB1 blocks 
α(v)β(3)-dependent recognition and uptake of apoptotic cells.
