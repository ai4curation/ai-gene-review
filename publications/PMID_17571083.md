A dinucleotide deletion in human ubiquitin (Ub) B messenger RNA leads to 
formation of polyubiquitin (UbB)+1, which has been implicated in neuronal cell 
death in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies 
demonstrate that UbB+1 protein causes proteasome dysfunction. However, the 
molecular mechanism of UbB+1-mediated neuronal degeneration remains unknown. We 
now report that UbB+1 causes neuritic beading, impairment of mitochondrial 
movements, mitochondrial stress and neuronal degeneration in primary neurons. 
Transfection of UbB+1 induced a buildup of mitochondria in neurites and 
dysregulation of mitochondrial motor proteins, in particular, through detachment 
of P74, the dynein intermediate chain, from mitochondria and decreased 
mitochondria-microtubule interactions. Altered distribution of mitochondria was 
associated with activation of both the mitochondrial stress and p53 cell death 
pathways. These results support the hypothesis that neuritic clogging of 
mitochondria by UbB+1 triggers a cascade of events characterized by local 
activation of mitochondrial stress followed by global cell death. Furthermore, 
UbB+1 small interfering RNA efficiently blocked expression of UbB+1 protein, 
attenuated neuritic beading and preserved cellular morphology, suggesting a 
potential neuroprotective strategy for certain neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract

A dinucleotide deletion in human ubiquitin (Ub) B messenger RNA leads to formation of polyubiquitin (UbB) + 1, which has been implicated in neuronal cell death in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies demonstrate that UbB + 1 protein causes proteasome dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanism of UbB + 1-mediated neuronal degeneration remains unknown. We now report that UbB + 1 causes neuritic beading, impairment of mitochondrial movements, mitochondrial stress and neuronal degeneration in primary neurons. Transfection of UbB + 1 induced a buildup of mitochondria in neurites and dysregulation of mitochondrial motor proteins, in particular, through detachment of P74, the dynein intermediate chain, from mitochondria and decreased mitochondria–microtubule interactions. Altered distribution of mitochondria was associated with activation of both the mitochondrial stress and p53 cell death pathways. These results support the hypothesis that neuritic clogging of mitochondria by UbB + 1 triggers a cascade of events characterized by local activation of mitochondrial stress followed by global cell death. Furthermore, UbB + 1 small interfering RNA efficiently blocked expression of UbB + 1 protein, attenuated neuritic beading and preserved cellular morphology, suggesting a potential neuroprotective strategy for certain neurodegenerative disorders.

Discussion

Neuritic beading has previously been shown to occur in association with neurodegeneration induced by excitotoxins, β-amyloid peptide and other neurotoxic agents. 21 – 23 Here, we demonstrate that the mutant protein, UbB + 1, causes rapid induction of neuritic beading and subsequent cell death. Although protein overexpression may nonspecifically lead to neuritic morphology, changes consistent with neuritic beading were evident only in UbB + 1-expressing cells. Further, Western blotting demonstrated that the amounts of EGFP–Ub and EGFP–UbB + 1 expressed with time after transfection were roughly equivalent. Despite abundant levels of EGFP–Ub on Western blots, we did observe a lower intensity of fluorescence signal in EGFP–Ub-expressing cells ( Figure 1a , panel 2). This discrepancy might be due to modulation of fluorescence intensity by interactions between EGFP and UPP-related proteins. 24 Moreover, neuritic beading of mitochondria was also induced by nontagged UbB + 1 ( Figure 3c ). Taken together, these observations indicate that the demonstrated neuritic effects were specific to UbB + 1. A slight increase in the number of beading cells was detected in pEGFP–Ub- or pEGFP-transfected cultures. These changes were not significant and possibly due to minor toxic effects of overexpressed proteins as well as transfection stress.

Ultrastructural studies revealed that the beads contained one or more mitochondria. Although the time frame used for transport measurements in our study was relatively long, significant changes in retrograde movement of mitochondria-associated aggregates were nonetheless observed, whereas changes in anterograde movement were not significant. More specific analyses of mitochondrial velocities and movements over shorter periods of time may help to delineate the dynamics of mitochondrial movement in injured neurons. Whereas there was no effect of UbB + 1 expression on the overall levels of P74 dynein and KIF1B kinesin, a significant decrease in the abundance of mitochondria-associated P74 was observed. This most likely resulted from detachment of P74 from mitochondrial cargo based on the findings from a cell-free reconstitution assay. The importance of P74 is demonstrated by its role as a key adaptor molecule involved in linking two 530 kDa dynein heavy chains to cargo for retrograde transport. 25 Accordingly, inhibition of dynein function causes what has been described as ‘organelle jams’ or ‘clogs’. 26 Our results therefore support the hypothesis that UbB + 1-mediated detachment of P74 from mitochondrial cargo disturbs the physiological balance between antero-grade and retrograde transport. The finding that mitochondria– MT associations were significantly reduced in the processes of UbB + 1-transfected neurons provides further evidence in support of this hypothesis. There was a minor decrease in retrograde axonal transport that was not statistically significant in EGFP–Ub-transfected cells. This suggests that the overexpression of wild-type Ub might also lead to a slight accumulation of polyUb conjugates, which interferes with motor–MT interactions. The combined effects of UbB + 1-induced detachment of P74 from mitochondrial cargo and altered MT associations may profoundly disable dynein-driven retrograde motion, thereby leading to an imbalance between anterograde and retrograde movements and a buildup of mitochondria in neurites. Moreover, both UbB + 1 and dynein play key roles in the formation of aggresomes during the cellular response to misfolded proteins. 27 , 28 Although we did not specifically identify aggresomes in this study, it is possible that aggresomes may compete with mitochondria for P74 binding and thereby facilitate mitochondrial detachment and impairment of retrograde transport. 28 UbB + 1-mediated actions may also be modulated by heat-shock protein family members, 29 which may be important regulators of axonal transport. 30

In addition to mitochondria, the transport machinery conveys other membranous and nonmembranous cargo between the neuronal soma and its processes. 17 Although we did not detect either ER or Golgi bodies in neuritic beads, the distribution of these organelles and other cargo in neuronal processes might still be perturbed by UbB + 1-mediated disruption of axonal transport. Thus, impaired axonal transport with abnormal organelle clustering in neurites has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases. 31 Moreover, induction of neuritic beading by impairment of the UPP suggests that the adverse effects of UbB + 1 on axonal transport may result, in part, from inhibition of proteasome function. In this regard, proteasome inhibition induces neuritic beading in cultured neurons (Tan et al ., unpublished observation), and UbB + 1as well as polyubiquitinated protein aggregates accumulate in the pathological hallmarks of AD, such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. 7 In addition, axon damage has been implicated in the initial stages of Alzheimer’s-related neuronal degeneration. 32 , 33 Although amyloid precursor protein and presenilin mutations, as well as tau isoforms, may disrupt axonal transport, 34 , 35 UbB + 1-mediated clogging of mitochondria in neurites may also contribute to the mechanism of axon injury and neuropathology in AD.

The pathophysiological significance of neuritic beading is underscored by the detection of mitochondrial stress in this study. The results suggest that there is a temporal relationship between activation of mitochondrial stress in neurites and neuronal cell death. Notably, mitochondrial stress indicated by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential seemed to start in peripheral neurites and then spread toward the cell soma. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential may lead to a local release of cytochrome c in neurites that triggers the mitochondrial cell death cascade through caspase-3 activation. Accordingly, about 70% of UbB + 1-positive cells exhibited a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in peripheral neurites relatively early on, which preceded a more global loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial oxidative stress and cell death indicated by TUNEL staining. Our findings therefore support the idea that overwhelming mitochondrial stress in neuronal processes, possibly triggered, in part, by impaired transport, may activate a cell death-signaling cascade that is propagated from the periphery to the cell body in a dying-back fashion.

Our observation that UbB + 1 induced significant accumulation of polyUb conjugates is in agreement with prior studies that demonstrated inhibition of proteasome function by UbB + 1. 8 , 9 Impaired UPP function likely contributed to the accumulation of tumor suppressor p53, which is a major UPP substrate. 36 Our results showed that activation of the p53 pathway plays an important role in UbB + 1-induced neuronal degeneration, as cell death was substantially decreased in neurons from p53-null mice. In addition, absence of p53 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cells exhibiting mitochondrial oxidative stress. These findings suggest that p53 might enhance mitochondrial stress either through direct interaction, as has previously been shown, or an indirect mechanism yet to be defined. 37 A link between impaired proteasome activity and mitochondrial oxidative stress has recently been demonstrated. 38 In the present study, UbB + 1-mediated UPP dysfunction may therefore facilitate mitochondrial superoxide production and contribute to mitochondrial stress.

The use of siRNA is an efficient way to block expression of specific genes, including alleles that differ by only one nucleotide. 20 Our results demonstrate that siRNA/shRNA can effectively knockdown expression and prevent the toxic effects of UbB + 1 protein in cultured neurons. Thus, siRNA might be a potential therapeutic approach to counteract the accumulation of UbB + 1 protein in certain neurological disorders. In addition to UbB + 1 mRNA, dinucleotide deletions in other transcripts may increase with aging due to a process of molecular misreading. 39 RNA interference may therefore be an effective tool to control the expression of abnormal transcripts associated with aging.

In summary, our results demonstrate that UbB + 1 causes a buildup of mitochondria in neurites and suggest that this results from dysregulation of motor protein–MT interactions. Impaired transport may then lead to mitochondrial stress and activation of both the mitochondrial and p53 cell death pathways. siRNA-mediated knockdown of UbB + 1 expression prevents neuritic beading and may be an effective therapeutic strategy for certain neurodegenerative diseases. Current investigations are aimed at understanding specific interactions between UbB + 1 and other polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and axonal transport motors, and relevant effects on mitochondrial movements. These studies may also help to elucidate molecular mechanisms of axon damage in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
