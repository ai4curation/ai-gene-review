The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is a sensor of 
different environmental conditions and regulator of cell growth, metabolism, and 
autophagy. mTORC1 is activated by Rag GTPases, working as RagA:RagB and 
RagC:RagD heterodimers. Rags control mTORC1 activity by tethering mTORC1 to the 
lysosomes where it is activated by Rheb GTPase. RagA:RagB, active in its 
GTP-bound form, is inhibited by GATOR1 complex, a GTPase-activating protein, and 
GATOR1 is in turn negatively regulated by GATOR2 complex. Sestrins are 
stress-responsive proteins that inhibit mTORC1 via activation of AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) and tuberous sclerosis complex. Here we report an 
AMPK-independent mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition by Sestrins mediated by their 
interaction with GATOR2. As a result of this interaction, the Sestrins suppress 
mTOR lysosomal localization in a Rag-dependent manner. This mechanism is 
potentially involved in mTORC1 regulation by amino acids, rotenone, and 
tunicamycin, connecting stress response with mTORC1 inhibition.
