The human ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3), a component of the 40S small subunit in 
the ribosome, is a known multi-functional protein with roles in DNA repair and 
apoptosis. We recently found that the arginine residue(s) of rpS3 are methylated 
by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). In this paper, we confirmed the 
arginine methylation of rpS3 protein both in vitro and in vivo. The sites of 
arginine methylation are located at amino acids 64, 65 and 67. However, mutant 
rpS3 (3RA), which cannot be methylated at these sites, cannot be transported 
into the nucleolus and subsequently incorporated into the ribosome. Our results 
clearly show that arginine methylation of rpS3 plays a critical role in its 
import into the nucleolus, as well as in small subunit assembly of the ribosome.
