HsfA2 is a heat stress (hs)-induced Hsf in peruvian tomato (Lycopersicon 
peruvianum) and the cultivated form Lycopersicon esculentum. Due to the high 
activator potential and the continued accumulation during repeated cycles of 
heat stress and recovery, HsfA2 becomes a dominant Hsf in thermotolerant cells. 
The formation of heterooligomeric complexes with HsfA1 leads to nuclear 
retention and enhanced transcriptional activity of HsfA2. This effect seems to 
represent one part of potential molecular mechanisms involved in its activity 
control. As shown in this paper, the activity of HsfA2 is also controlled by a 
network of nucleocytoplasmic small Hsps influencing its solubility, 
intracellular localization and activator function. By yeast two-hybrid 
interaction and transient coexpression studies in tobacco (Nicotiana 
plumbaginifolia) mesophyll protoplasts, we found that tomato (Lycopersicon 
esculentum) Hsp17.4-CII acts as corepressor of HsfA2. Given appropriate 
conditions, both proteins together formed large cytosolic aggregates which could 
be solubilized in presence of class CI sHsps. However, independent of the 
formation of aggregates or of the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of HsfA2, its 
transcriptional activity was specifically repressed by interaction of 
Hsp17.4-CII with the C-terminal activator domain. Although not identical in all 
aspects, the situation with the highly expressed, heat stress-inducible 
Arabidopsis HsfA2 was found to be principally similar. In corresponding reporter 
assays its activity was repressed in presence of AtHsp17.7-CII but not of 
AtHsp17.6-CII or LpHsp17.4-CII.

Abstract

HsfA2 is a heat stress (hs)-induced Hsf in peruvian tomato ( Lycopersicon peruvianum ) and the cultivated form Lycopersicon esculentum . Due to the high activator potential and the continued accumulation during repeated cycles of heat stress and recovery, HsfA2 becomes a dominant Hsf in thermotolerant cells. The formation of heterooligomeric complexes with HsfA1 leads to nuclear retention and enhanced transcriptional activity of HsfA2. This effect seems to represent one part of potential molecular mechanisms involved in its activity control. As shown in this paper, the activity of HsfA2 is also controlled by a network of nucleocytoplasmic small Hsps influencing its solubility, intracellular localization and activator function. By yeast two-hybrid interaction and transient coexpression studies in tobacco ( Nicotiana plumbaginifolia ) mesophyll protoplasts, we found that tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum ) Hsp17.4-CII acts as corepressor of HsfA2. Given appropriate conditions, both proteins together formed large cytosolic aggregates which could be solubilized in presence of class CI sHsps. However, independent of the formation of aggregates or of the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of HsfA2, its transcriptional activity was specifically repressed by interaction of Hsp17.4-CII with the C-terminal activator domain. Although not identical in all aspects, the situation with the highly expressed, heat stress-inducible Arabidopsis HsfA2 was found to be principally similar. In corresponding reporter assays its activity was repressed in presence of AtHsp17.7-CII but not of AtHsp17.6-CII or LpHsp17.4-CII.

DISCUSSION

Although our knowledge is still rather fragmentary, there is experimental evidence that the maintenance of the inactive state of Hsfs requires additional proteins functioning as corepressors. On the one hand, a small Hsf-binding protein (HSBP1) in mammals and nematodes was reported to mask the HR-A/B region by coiled-coil interactions, and thus to stabilize the inactive, monomeric form of Hsfs ( Satyal et al., 1998 ; Tai et al., 2002 ). Recently, a HSBP ortholog was identified in maize. The lack of HSBP in the mutant empty pericarp 2 (emp2) leads to an uncontrolled expression of hs genes and embryo lethality ( Fu et al., 2002 ). On the other hand, Hsp70 and Hsp90 are evidently involved in the control of Hsf activity in yeast and vertebrates ( Baler et al., 1996 ; Nair et al., 1996 ; Ali et al., 1998 ; Shi et al., 1998 ; Bharadwaj et al., 1999 ; Bonner et al., 2000 ; Guo et al., 2001 ), and the function of Hsp70 as coregulator of Hsf activity may be similar in plants as well ( Lee and Schöffl, 1996 ; Kim and Schöffl, 2002 ). To our knowledge, a role of a sHsp for control of Hsf activity was never shown before.

The tomato Hsf system is characterized by an intriguing cooperation between two Hsfs, i.e. HsfA1 and HsfA2. As master regulator of the heat stress response, HsfA1 is responsible for the hs-induced synthesis of HsfA2 ( Mishra et al., 2002 ). With ongoing heat stress, the latter accumulates to fairly high levels and becomes the dominant Hsf of tomato cells. Its strong activator potential and abundance markedly enhances the efficiency of hs gene expression, especially in combination with HsfA1. Earlier, we distinguished three major states of HsfA2 in tomato cell cultures ( Scharf et al., 1998a ; Heerklotz et al., 2001 ): (1) Nuclear HsfA2: Despite its strong nuclear export signal, HsfA2 accumulates in the nucleus in presence of HsfA1, probably in form of HsfA2/A1 heterooligomeric complexes. This corresponds to the behavior of HsfA2 if coexpressed together with HsfA1 in native tissues or in tobacco protoplasts ( Scharf et al., 1998a ). (2) HsfA2 in HSG complexes: With ongoing synthesis during hs, a considerable portion of HsfA2 can be detected in large cytoplasmic aggregates (heat stress granules) together with Hsp17-CI, Hsp17-CII, and probably denatured proteins ( Scharf et al., 1998a ; Mishra et al., 2002 ). (3) Cytoplasmic, soluble HsfA2: The hs-specific, high salt-resistant structural binding of HsfA2 in the HSG fraction is reversible. In the recovery period, most of the HsfA2 is found in soluble form in the cytoplasm.

Results in this manuscript demonstrate that the three states of HsfA2 not only depend on its interaction with HsfA1 mediated by the similarity of their oligomerization domains, but also with Hsp17.4-CII binding to the C-terminal domain of HsfA2. The latter interaction has two effects. On the one hand, Hsp17.4-CII acts as corepressor of HsfA2. On the other hand, it promotes formation of high M r aggregates of HsfA2 and Hsp17.4-CII even under control temperature conditions ( Figs. 3 , 4 , and 6 ). This aggregation represents an experimental artifact valuable to investigate details of the protein network responsible for the intracellular localization and function of HsfA2. In the reality of tomato cells in the recovery period following a short hs treatment, no aggregates of HsfA2 are observed because two proteins counteract the structural binding of HsfA2 and Hsp17.4-CII. First, interaction with HsfA1 not only prevents aggregation of HsfA2, but it also promotes nuclear accumulation and keeps HsfA2 in a transcriptionally competent state ( Scharf et al., 1998a ). Second, Hsp17-CI interacts with Hsp17.4-CII and inhibits the aggregation together with HsfA2 ( Fig. 4A ).

This solubilizing effect of Hsp17-CI under control temperature conditions is a class-specific but organism-independent character. It reflects the interaction between Hsp17.4-CII and Hsp17-CI in their oligomeric states as found upon coexpression in plant cells ( Siddique et al., 2003 ). It can be visualized by shifts of the relative positions of oligomeric Hsp complexes in a native gel ( Fig. 5C ) and by disintegration of the HsfA2/Hsp17.4-CII aggregates ( Figs. 4A and 6 ). The results in native plant cells are in contrast to the lacking interaction of class CI and CII proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system, because the dimer interfaces of both sHsps are class-specific and not compatible ( Kirschner et al., 2000 ).

In contrast to the broad specificity of the class CI proteins, the interaction between HsfA2 and Hsp17.4-CII is highly selective. It was not observed with any other class CII protein tested so far. This is even true for the closely related tomato Hsp17.3-CII. A single amino acid exchange (V48>A) makes the crucial difference between the two proteins. Remarkably, this interaction can be detected in all test systems, e.g. in yeast two-hybrid tests ( Fig. 2 ), in glutathione S -transferase (GST)-pull-down assays (data not shown) as well as in situ in protoplasts ( Fig. 6 ) and in reporter assays ( Fig. 7 ). Evidently, it is independent of the oligomeric state of the two proteins.

Analysis of the Arabidopsis orthologs, i.e. of HsfA2 and the two class CII sHsps, indicates that a comparable functional relationship might exist in this plant as well. Similar to tomato, the Arabidopsis HsfA2 is also strictly hs-inducible and, together with the small Hsps and other chaperones, it accumulates to high levels in cell cultures and leaves ( Kotak et al., 2004 ). In the protoplast reporter assay, the activity of AtHsfA2 was clearly repressed upon coexpression with AtHsp17.7-CII, but not with the closely related AtHsp17.6-CII. However, unlike the situation with the tomato proteins, we could not detect this interaction in any of our other assays. One possible explanation for this failure could be that, in contrast with the reporter assays, the outcome of the other interaction tests is strongly influenced by the intrinsic properties of the tested partner proteins, i.e. only tomato HsfA2 has the intrinsic tendency for aggregation, which is lacking for Arabidopsis HsfA2. This is also supported by results from the analysis of modified forms of the tomato sHsps, e.g. the A48>V mutant form of LpHsp17.3-CII. It acts as corepressor of LpHsfA2 and promotes the formation of the sedimentable form, but it does not interact in the yeast two-hybrid assay ( Figs. 7A and 2 ). Further, the results obtained with the chimeric constructs encoding the C-terminal activator domain of tomato HsfA2 fused to the DNA binding domain of HsfA1 showed no detectable formation of sedimentable forms in presence of LpHsp17.4-CII ( Fig. 3C ), although the activator potential was repressed (data not shown). Evidently, formation of high M r aggregates is only observed with the full-length HsfA2, and the interaction of its C-terminal domain with Hsp17.4-CII is only one aspect of this phenomenon. Clearly, these interesting aspects need further studies including HsfA2 of other plants in combination with their potential sHsp corepressors.

Our results show for the first time important elements of a protein network controlling the intracellular distribution, stability, and activator function of tomato HsfA2. Previously, we showed that HsfA1 as master regulator of the hs response in tomato is responsible for hs-induced new synthesis of HsfA2 ( Mishra et al., 2002 ) and for its nuclear retention ( Scharf et al., 1998a ; Heerklotz et al., 2001 ). The new elements added to the protein network are the nucleocytoplasmic sHsps of classes CI and CII accumulating together with HsfA2 as a result of the hs-induced gene expression. Both types of sHsps play completely different roles in the HsfA2 network. Hsp17.4-CII functions as a putative repressor of HsfA2 activity and most probably represents the specific anchor protein for the incorporation of HsfA2 into HSG complexes formed only under hs conditions. In contrast to this, class CI sHsps are essential for resolubilization of the HSG complexes in the recovery period and/or for keeping HsfA2/Hsp17.4-CII complexes in soluble state at control temperatures. This leads to the interesting hypothesis that in thermotolerant tomato cells HsfA2 is stabilized in a transcriptional inactive form by interaction with soluble Hsp17.4-CII in presence of Hsp17-CI and is kept competent for a rapid activation under repeating hs conditions. In addition to our results reported in this paper, two earlier observations support this hypothesis: (1) In preinduced tomato culture cells a transient increase in the nuclear localization of HsfA2 was found at the beginning of a second hs treatment ( Scharf et al., 1998b ), and (2) the detection of Hsp17-CI in nuclei purified from heat stressed tomato cells was reported by Wollgiehn et al. (1994) .

Although we have probably identified the four major components of the HsfA2 network, we cannot exclude that in the reality of an hs-induced cell, additional proteins might be important for the control of the activity state and stability of HsfA2 as well. Our analysis was mainly based on the coexpression of the partner proteins in tobacco protoplasts. Although probably very similar, this cannot completely simulate the situation in native tomato cells. Further experiments are required, e.g. an RNAi approach in tomato protoplasts that would allow selectively knocking-down expression of these and other components with putative functional interactions to the HsfA2 network.

General Materials and Methods

The use of tobacco ( Nicotiana plumbaginifolia ) mesophyll protoplasts for polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation and transient gene expression was published ( Treuter et al., 1993 ; Scharf et al., 1998a ; Döring et al., 2000 ) and polyclonal antisera from rabbit against tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum ) HsfA2, Hsp17-CI and Hsp17-CII were described before ( Lyck et al., 1997 ; Scharf et al., 1998a ; Kirschner et al., 2000 ). Peptide-specific antisera against tomato Hsp17 class CI and class CII were generated in rabbits by immunization with synthetic, class-specific peptides (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) corresponding to nonhomologous amino acid sequence motifs in the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of LpHsp17.7-CI and LpHsp17.4-CII, respectively. If not indicated otherwise, the peptide-specific antisera were used for immunoblot detections of class CI and class CII sHsps (see below). For the requirements of double-immunostaining class-specific antibodies were raised in guinea-pigs (Eurogentec) by immunization with purified GST fusion proteins of tomato Hsp17.7-CI and Hsp17.4-CII expresssed in Escherichia coli BL21DE3. Monoclonal antibodies, clone 16B12 and 9E10 (Hiss Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany), were used for immunodetection of 3HA- and Myc-tagged proteins, respectively. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent dyes CY2 or CY3 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany) and Dianova (Hamburg, Germany), respectively.

LMB was kindly provided by Minoru Yoshida, Tokyo, and used as specific repressor of the nuclear export receptor exportin 1 as described before ( Kudo et al., 1999 ; Heerklotz et al., 2001 ).

For indirect immunofluorescence of protoplasts we followed the procedures described by Scharf et al. (1998a) and Heerklotz et al. (2001) . Fixation of protoplasts was done with 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in microtubule stabilizing buffer (100 m m PIPES buffer, pH 6.8, 2 m m EGTA, 1 m m MgSO 4 ).

For microscopic analysis a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) combined with a Color View F12 System (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) was used. Captured images were resized and combined using Photoshop 5.5 Software (Adobe Systems, La Jolla, CA). Confocal laser scan micrographs were captured using a Leica CLSM (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) and Imaris Software (Bitplane, Zurich).

Standard procedures were used for cloning ( Ausubel et al., 1993 ; Sambrook and Russell, 2001 ). Plant expression vectors are derivatives of pRT101 ( Töpfer et al., 1988 ) and modified versions for expression of triple HA- or Myc-tagged proteins were described before ( Kirschner et al., 2000 ; Siddique et al., 2003 ). The expression vector encoding HsfA2M4, a mutant form of HsfA2 with disrupted NES, was described ( Heerklotz et al., 2001 ). For deletions or combinations of functional parts of HsfA1 and HsfA2, we used unique Sal I sites in different regions of the cDNA introduced by site-directed mutagenesis ( Treuter et al., 1993 ; Boscheinen et al., 1997 ; Döring et al., 2000 ). The principle modular structures of the chimeric proteins of Hsfs A1 and A2 as well as fusions of their C-terminal domains (CTD) to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 are given in the block diagrams in Figure 3C and Figure 7B , respectively.

To minimize possible interferences of the endogenous set of sHsps in tobacco protoplasts, two inactive HsfA2 variants were used in those experiments where the intracellular distribution or the aggregation behavior of HsfA2 and coexpressed sHsps was analyzed. The corresponding expression plasmids are pRTHsfA2M2 encoding a mutant form of HsfA2 impaired in DNA-binding ( Lyck et al., 1997 ) and pRT3HA-HsfA2 encoding HsfA2 with a triple HA-tag preceeding the N-terminal DBD.

For Hsf-dependent GUS reporter assays, we used the phsp17gus vector containing the promoter region of the soybean hsp17.3 -B gene upstream of the TATA box ( Treuter et al., 1993 ) and the Gal4DBDgus plasmid as reporter for monitoring the activator potential of Gal4DBD-HsfCTD fusion constructs ( Döring et al., 2000 ).
