The cellular response to DNA damage is mediated by evolutionarily conserved 
Ser/Thr kinases, phosphorylation of Cdc25 protein phosphatases, binding to 
14-3-3 proteins, and exit from the cell cycle. To investigate DNA damage 
responses mediated by the p38/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) axis of 
signaling, the optimal phosphorylation motifs of mammalian p38alpha SAPK and 
MAPKAP kinase-2 were determined. The optimal substrate motif for MAPKAP 
kinase-2, but not for p38 SAPK, closely matches the 14-3-3 binding site on 
Cdc25B/C. We show that MAPKAP kinase-2 is directly responsible for Cdc25B/C 
phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding in vitro and in response to UV-induced DNA 
damage within mammalian cells. Downregulation of MAPKAP kinase-2 eliminates DNA 
damage-induced G2/M, G1, and intra S phase checkpoints. We propose that MAPKAP 
kinase-2 is a new member of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase family that 
functions in parallel with Chk1 and Chk2 to integrate DNA damage signaling 
responses and cell cycle arrest in mammalian cells.
