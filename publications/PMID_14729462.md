Nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II), alternatively named RNA helicase A (RHA), is 
an F-actin binding protein that is particularly enriched in the nucleolus of 
mouse cells. Here, we show that the nucleolar localization of NDH II of murine 
3T3 cells depended on an ongoing rRNA synthesis. NDH II migrated out of the 
nucleolus after administration of 0.05 microg/ml actinomycin D, while nucleolin 
and the upstream binding factor (UBF) remained there. In S phase-arrested mouse 
cells, NDH II was frequently found at the nucleolar periphery, where it was 
accompanied by newly synthesized nucleolar RNA. Human NDH II was mainly 
distributed through the whole nucleoplasm and not enriched in the nucleoli. 
However, in the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, NDH II was also found at 
the nucleolar periphery, together with the tumor suppressor protein p53. Both 
NDH II and p53 were apparently attached to the F-actin-based filamentous network 
that surrounded the nucleoli. Accordingly, this subnuclear structure was 
sensitive to F-actin depolymerizing agents. Depolymerization with gelsolin led 
to a striking accumulation of NDH II in the nucleoli of MCF-7 cells. This effect 
was abolished by RNase, which extensively released nucleolus-bound NDH II when 
added together with gelsolin. Taken together, these results support the idea 
that an actin-based filamentous network may anchor NDH II at the nucleolar 
periphery for pre-ribosomal RNA processing, ribosome assembly, and/or transport.
