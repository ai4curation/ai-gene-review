The oligomerization domain that is present at the C terminus of Ikaros-family 
proteins and the protein Trps-1 is important for the proper regulation of 
developmental processes such as hematopoiesis. Remarkably, this domain is 
predicted to contain two classical zinc fingers (ZnFs), domains normally 
associated with the recognition of nucleic acids. The preference for protein 
binding by these predicted ZnFs is not well-understood. We have used a range of 
methods to gain insight into the structure of this domain. Circular dichroism, 
UV-vis, and NMR experiments carried out on the C-terminal domain of Eos (EosC) 
revealed that the two putative ZnFs (C1 and C2) are separable, i.e., capable of 
folding independently in the presence of Zn(II). We next determined the 
structure of EosC2 using NMR spectroscopy, revealing that, although the overall 
fold of EosC2 is similar to other classical ZnFs, a number of differences exist. 
For example, the conformation of the C terminus of EosC2 appears to be flexible 
and may result in a major rearrangement of the zinc ligands. Finally, 
alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify the residues that are involved 
in the homo- and hetero-oligomerization of Eos, and these results are discussed 
in the context of the structure of EosC. These studies provide the first 
structural insights into how EosC mediates protein-protein interactions and 
contributes to our understanding of why it does not exhibit high-affinity DNA 
binding.
