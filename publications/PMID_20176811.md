Protein complexes containing Prp19 play a central role during catalytic 
activation of the spliceosome, and Prp19 and its related proteins are major 
components of the spliceosome's catalytic core RNP. To learn more about the 
spatial organization of the human Prp19 (hPrp19)/CDC5L complex, which is 
comprised of hPrp19, CDC5L, PRL1, AD002, SPF27, CTNNBL1, and HSP73, we purified 
native hPrp19/CDC5L complexes from HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged 
AD002 or SPF27. Stoichiometric analyses indicated that, like Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae NTC (nineteen complex), the human Prp19/CDC5L complex contains four 
copies of hPrp19. Salt treatment identified a stable core comprised of CDC5L, 
hPrp19, PRL1, and SPF27. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that SPF27 
directly interacts with each component of the hPrp19/CDC5L complex core and also 
elucidated several additional, previously unknown interactions between 
hPrp19/CDC5L complex components. Limited proteolysis of the hPrp19/CDC5L complex 
revealed a protease-resistant complex comprised of SPF27, the C terminus of 
CDC5L, and the N termini of PRL1 and hPrp19. Under the electron microscope, 
purified hPrp19/CDC5L complexes exhibit an elongated, asymmetric shape with a 
maximum dimension of approximately 20 nm. Our findings not only elucidate the 
molecular organization of the hPrp19/CDC5L complex but also provide insights 
into potential protein-protein interactions at the core of the catalytically 
active spliceosome.
