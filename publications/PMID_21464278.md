The small heat shock protein (sHSP) αB-crystallin (αB) plays a key role in the 
cellular protection system against stress. For decades, high-resolution 
structural studies on heterogeneous sHSPs have been confounded by the 
polydisperse nature of αB oligomers. We present an atomic-level model of 
full-length αB as a symmetric 24-subunit multimer based on solid-state NMR, 
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and EM data. The model builds on our 
recently reported structure of the homodimeric α-crystallin domain (ACD) and 
C-terminal IXI motif in the context of the multimer. A hierarchy of interactions 
contributes to build multimers of varying sizes: Interactions between two ACDs 
define a dimer, three dimers connected by their C-terminal regions define a 
hexameric unit, and variable interactions involving the N-terminal region define 
higher-order multimers. Within a multimer, N-terminal regions exist in multiple 
environments, contributing to the heterogeneity observed by NMR. Analysis of 
SAXS data allows determination of a heterogeneity parameter for this type of 
system. A mechanism of multimerization into higher-order asymmetric oligomers 
via the addition of up to six dimeric units to a 24-mer is proposed. The 
proposed asymmetric multimers explain the homogeneous appearance of αB in 
negative-stain EM images and the known dynamic exchange of αB subunits. The 
model of αB provides a structural basis for understanding known 
disease-associated missense mutations and makes predictions concerning substrate 
binding and the reported fibrilogenesis of αB.
