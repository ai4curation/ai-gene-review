Amyloid beta/A4 protein precursor (APP) is secreted into medium by most cultured 
cells and can function as an autocrine factor. To study the biological function 
of secreted forms of APP (sAPP) on neurons, we used a clonal CNS neuronal line, 
B103, which does not synthesize detectable levels of APP. B103 cells transfected 
with APP construct developed neurites faster than the parent B103 cells when 
plated in a serum-free defined medium. Neurite outgrowth of B103 cells was 
promoted by the conditioned medium of APP-695-over-producing cells or by the 
bacteria-produced sAPP-695 (named KB75). A series of peptides having sequences 
between Ala-319 and Met-335 of APP-695 also stimulated neurite outgrowth of B103 
cells. The sequence of five amino acids, RERMS (APP 328-332), within this 
stretch of sequence, was the shortest active peptide, although the concentration 
required for the neuritotropic activity was higher than that of KB75. Binding 
assay using 125I-labeled APP 17-mer peptide corresponding to Ala-319 to Met-335 
of APP-695 as a ligand demonstrated specific and saturable cell-surface binding 
sites. The predicted KD value was 20 +/- 5 nM and the Bmax value was 80 +/- 8 
fmol/10(6) cells. The binding could be displaced with KB75. A 17-mer peptide 
with reverse sequence neither induced neurite outgrowth nor competed for the 
binding. A bacteria-produced sAPP fragment lacking the active 17-mer sequence 
(named KB75 delta) did not compete with 125I-labeled 17-mer for binding or 
stimulate neurite extension. A peptide of sequence RMSQ (APP 330-333), which 
partially overlaps the active sequence RERMS, could block the neuritotropic 
effects of both KB75 and the 17-mer at higher concentrations. APP 17-mer was 
also found to induce the accumulation of inositol polyphosphates, suggesting 
that the APP 17-mer effects involve activation of inositol phospholipid signal 
transduction systems. These data indicate that sAPP induces neurite extension 
through cell-surface binding and that the domain containing the RERMS sequence 
(APP 328-332) represents the active site responsible for this function.
