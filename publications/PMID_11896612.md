Many human cancers have been associated with the deregulation of receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTK). However, the individual contribution of 
receptor-associated signaling proteins in cellular transformation and metastasis 
is poorly understood. To examine the role of RTK activated signal transduction 
pathways to processes involved in cell transformation, we have exploited the 
oncogenic derivative of the Met RTK (Tpr-Met). Unlike other RTKs, twin tyrosine 
residues in the carboxy-terminal tail of the Met oncoprotein and receptor are 
required for all biological and transforming activities, and a mutant lacking 
these tyrosines is catalytically active but non transforming. Using this mutant 
we have inserted oligonucleotide cassettes, each encoding a binding site for a 
specific signaling protein derived from other RTKs. We have generated variant 
forms of the Tpr-Met oncoprotein with the ability to bind individually to the 
p85 subunit of PI3'K, PLCgamma, or to the Grb2 or Shc adaptor proteins. Variants 
that recruit the Shc or Grb2 adaptor proteins generated foci of morphologically 
transformed fibroblast cells and induced anchorage-independent growth, 
scattering of epithelial cells and experimental metastasis. In contrast, 
variants that bind and activate PI3'K or PLCgamma failed to generate readily 
detectable foci. Although cell lines expressing the PI3'K variant grew in 
soft-agar, these cells were non metastatic. Using this unique RTK oncoprotein 
model, we have established that Grb2 or Shc dependent signaling pathways are 
sufficient for cell transformation and metastatic spread.
