The critical pathways through which protein-tyrosine kinases induce cellular 
proliferation and malignant transformation are not well defined. As 
microinjection of antibodies against p21ras can block the biological effects of 
both normal and oncogenic tyrosine kinases, it is likely that they require 
functional p21ras to transmit their mitogenic signals. No biochemical link has 
been established, however, between tyrosine kinases and p21ras. We have 
identified a non-catalytic domain of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, SH2, that 
regulates the activity and specificity of the kinase domain. The presence of two 
adjacent SH2 domains in the p21ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) indicates 
that GAP might interact directly with tyrosine kinases. Here we show that GAP, 
and two co-precipitating proteins of relative molecular masses 62,000 and 
190,000 (p62 and p190) are phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells that have been 
transformed by cytoplasmic and receptor-like tyrosine kinases. The 
phosphorylation of these polypeptides correlates with transformation in cells 
expressing inducible forms of the v-src or v-fps encoded tyrosine kinases. 
Furthermore, GAP, p62 and p190 are also rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in 
fibroblasts stimulated with epidermal growth factor. Our results suggest a 
mechanism by which tyrosine kinases might modify p21ras function, and implicate 
GAP and its associated proteins as targets of both oncoproteins and normal 
growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. These data support the 
idea that SH2 sequences direct the interactions of cytoplasmic proteins involved 
in signal transduction.
