Human glutaredoxin 3 (Glrx3) is an essential [2Fe-2S]-binding protein with 
ill-defined roles in immune cell response, embryogenesis, cancer cell growth, 
and regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. Similar to other members of the CGFS 
monothiol glutaredoxin (Grx) family, human Glrx3 forms homodimers bridged by two 
[2Fe-2S] clusters that are ligated by the conserved CGFS motifs and glutathione 
(GSH). We recently demonstrated that the yeast homologues of human Glrx3 and the 
yeast BolA-like protein Fra2 form [2Fe-2S]-bridged heterodimers that play a key 
role in signaling intracellular iron availability. Herein, we provide 
biophysical and biochemical evidence that the two tandem Grx-like domains in 
human Glrx3 form similar [2Fe-2S]-bridged complexes with human BolA2. UV-visible 
absorption and circular dichroism, resonance Raman, and electron paramagnetic 
resonance spectroscopic analyses of recombinant [2Fe-2S] Glrx3 homodimers and 
[2Fe-2S] Glrx3-BolA2 complexes indicate that the Fe-S coordination environments 
in these complexes are virtually identical to those of the analogous complexes 
in yeast. Furthermore, we demonstrate that apo BolA2 binds to each Grx domain in 
the [2Fe-2S] Glrx3 homodimer forming a [2Fe-2S] BolA2-Glrx3 heterotrimer. Taken 
together, these results suggest that the unusual [2Fe-2S]-bridging Grx-BolA 
interaction is conserved in higher eukaryotes and may play a role in signaling 
cellular iron status in humans.

Abstract

Human glutaredoxin 3 (Glrx3) is an essential [2Fe-2S]-binding protein with ill-defined roles in immune cell response, embryogenesis, cancer cell growth, and regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. Similar to other members of the CGFS monothiol glutaredoxin (Grx) family, human Glrx3 forms homodimers bridged by two [2Fe-2S] clusters that are ligated by the conserved CGFS motifs and glutathione (GSH). We recently demonstrated that the yeast homologues of human Glrx3 and the yeast BolA-like protein Fra2 form [2Fe-2S]-bridged heterodimers that play a key role in signaling intracellular iron availability. Herein we provide biophysical and biochemical evidence that the two tandem Grx-like domains in human Glrx3 form similar [2Fe-2S]-bridged complexes with human BolA2. UV-visible absorption and CD, resonance Raman, and EPR spectroscopic analyses of recombinant [2Fe-2S] Glrx3 homodimers and [2Fe-2S] Glrx3-BolA2 complexes indicate that the Fe-S coordination environments in these complexes are virtually identical to the analogous complexes in yeast. Furthermore, we demonstrate that apo BolA2 binds to each Grx domain in the [2Fe-2S] Glrx3 homodimer forming a [2Fe-2S] BolA2-Glrx3 heterotrimer. Taken together, these results suggest that the unusual [2Fe-2S]-bridging Grx-BolA interaction is conserved in higher eukaryotes and may play a role in signaling cellular iron status in humans.

Biochemical and Spectroscopic Methods

The calculated extinction coefficient for each apo protein studied was used to standardize the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, protein concentrations were routinely determined by the Bradford assay using BSA as the calibration standard. Iron concentrations were determined using the colorimetric ferrozine assay ( 21 ). Acid-labile sulfur concentrations were determined using published methods ( 22 , 23 ). GSH measurements of the purified Fe-S protein complexes were described previously ( 1 ). Analytical gel filtration analyses were performed on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris/MES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM GSH and calibrated with the Low Molecular Weight Gel Filtration Calibration kit (GE Healthcare) as previously described ( 1 ). UV−visible absorption, circular dichroism (CD), resonance Raman, and X-band (9.6 GHz) EPR spectra were recorded as previously described ( 12 ). The samples for spectroscopic studies were handled under anaerobic conditions in a glove box (< 2 ppm O 2 ).
