The SIR2 homologues HST3 and HST4 have been implicated in maintenance of genome 
integrity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that Hst3 has 
NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity in vitro and that it functions during 
S phase to deacetylate the core domain of histone H3 at lysine 56 (H3K56). In 
response to genotoxic stress, Hst3 undergoes rapid Mec1-dependent 
phosphorylation and is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, thus 
providing a mechanism for the previously observed checkpoint-dependent 
accumulation of Ac-H3K56 at sites of DNA damage. Loss of Hst3-mediated 
regulation of H3K56 acetylation results in a defect in the S phase DNA damage 
checkpoint. The pathway that regulates H3K56 acetylation acts in parallel with 
the Rad9 pathway to transmit a DNA damage signal from Mec1 to Rad53. We also 
observe that loss of Hst3 function impairs sister chromatid cohesion (SCC). Both 
S phase checkpoint and SCC defects are phenocopied by H3K56 point mutants. Our 
findings demonstrate that Hst3-regulated H3K56 acetylation safeguards genome 
stability by controlling the S phase DNA damage response and promoting SCC.
