Cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) detects 
intracellular DNA and signals through the adapter protein STING to initiate the 
antiviral response to DNA viruses. Whether DNA viruses can prevent activation of 
the cGAS-STING pathway remains largely unknown. Here, we identify the oncogenes 
of the DNA tumor viruses, including E7 from human papillomavirus (HPV) and E1A 
from adenovirus, as potent and specific inhibitors of the cGAS-STING pathway. We 
show that the LXCXE motif of these oncoproteins, which is essential for blockade 
of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, is also important for antagonizing DNA 
sensing. E1A and E7 bind to STING, and silencing of these oncogenes in human 
tumor cells restores the cGAS-STING pathway. Our findings reveal a host-virus 
conflict that may have shaped the evolution of viral oncogenes.
