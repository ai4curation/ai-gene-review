Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a Zn2+-metalloprotease, is involved in the 
clearance of insulin and amyloid-beta (refs 1-3). Loss-of-function mutations of 
IDE in rodents cause glucose intolerance and cerebral accumulation of 
amyloid-beta, whereas enhanced IDE activity effectively reduces brain 
amyloid-beta (refs 4-7). Here we report structures of human IDE in complex with 
four substrates (insulin B chain, amyloid-beta peptide (1-40), amylin and 
glucagon). The amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of IDE (IDE-N and IDE-C, 
respectively) form an enclosed cage just large enough to encapsulate insulin. 
Extensive contacts between IDE-N and IDE-C keep the degradation chamber of IDE 
inaccessible to substrates. Repositioning of the IDE domains enables substrate 
access to the catalytic cavity. IDE uses size and charge distribution of the 
substrate-binding cavity selectively to entrap structurally diverse 
polypeptides. The enclosed substrate undergoes conformational changes to form 
beta-sheets with two discrete regions of IDE for its degradation. Consistent 
with this model, mutations disrupting the contacts between IDE-N and IDE-C 
increase IDE catalytic activity 40-fold. The molecular basis for substrate 
recognition and allosteric regulation of IDE could aid in designing IDE-based 
therapies to control cerebral amyloid-beta and blood sugar concentrations.

Abstract

Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a Zn 2+ -metalloprotease, is involved in the clearance of insulin and amyloid-β (refs 1 – 3 ). Loss-of-function mutations of IDE in rodents cause glucose intolerance and cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β, whereas enhanced IDE activity effectively reduces brain amyloid-β (refs 4 – 7 ). Here we report structures of human IDE in complex with four substrates (insulin B chain, amyloid-β peptide (1–40), amylin and glucagon). The amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of IDE (IDE-N and IDE-C, respectively) form an enclosed cage just large enough to encapsulate insulin. Extensive contacts between IDE-N and IDE-C keep the degradation chamber of IDE inaccessible to substrates. Repositioning of the IDE domains enables substrate access to the catalytic cavity. IDE uses size and charge distribution of the substrate-binding cavity selectively to entrap structurally diverse polypeptides. The enclosed substrate undergoes conformational changes to form β-sheets with two discrete regions of IDE for its degradation. Consistent with this model, mutations disrupting the contacts between IDE-N and IDE-C increase IDE catalytic activity 40-fold. The molecular basis for substrate recognition and allosteric regulation of IDE could aid in designing IDE-based therapies to control cerebral amyloid-β and blood sugar concentrations 1 , 8 , 9 .
