c-Cbl associates with the activated EGF receptor before endocytosis. We here 
reveal that the capacity of c-Cbl to promote receptor internalization depends on 
its ubiquitin ligase activity, which functionally connects the EGF receptor to 
Eps15, a mediator of clathrin-coated pit formation. EGF-induced phosphorylation 
of Eps15, as well as recruitment of Eps15 to the plasma membrane and its 
co-localization with the EGF receptor in endosomes required the ubiquitin ligase 
activity of c-Cbl. This suggested that ubiquitin provides a direct or indirect 
link between the receptor and Eps15. Indeed, EGF-induced redistribution of Eps15 
to the plasma membrane and endosomes depended on its ubiquitin-interacting 
motif. Upon over-expression, the ubiquitin-interacting motif abrogated the 
capacity of c-Cbl to promote EGF receptor endocytosis and only allowed receptor 
internalization via a route that lacked Eps15. Our findings disclose a novel 
function for the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase and identify ubiquitin as a module that 
directs the EGF receptor into an endocytic pathway involving Eps15.
