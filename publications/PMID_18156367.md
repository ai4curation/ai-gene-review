The mammalian RBC lacks de novo lipid synthesis but maintains its membrane 
composition by rapid turnover of acyl moieties at the sn-2 position of 
phospholipids. Plasma-derived fatty acids are esterified to acyl-CoA by acyl-CoA 
synthetases and transferred to lysophospholipids by acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid 
acyltransferases. We report the characterization of three 
lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) acyltransferases (LPCATs), products of the 
AYTL1, -2, and -3 genes. These proteins are three members of a LPCAT family, of 
which all three genes are expressed in an erythroleukemic cell line. Aytl2 mRNA 
was detected in mouse reticulocytes, and the presence of the product of the 
human ortholog was confirmed in adult human RBCs. The three murine Aytl proteins 
generated phosphatidylcholine from long-chain acyl-CoA and lysoPC when expressed 
in Escherichia coli membranes. Spliced variants of Aytl1, affecting a conserved 
catalytic motif, were identified. Calcium and magnesium modulated LPCAT activity 
of both Aytl1 and -2 proteins that exhibit EF-hand motifs at the C terminus. 
Characterization of the product of the Aytl2 gene as the phosphatidylcholine 
reacylating enzyme in RBCs represents the identification of a plasma membrane 
lysophospholipid acyltransferase and establishes the function of a LPCAT 
protein.
