SMILE (small heterodimer partner interacting leucine zipper protein) has been 
identified as a corepressor of the glucocorticoid receptor, constitutive 
androstane receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha. Here we show that 
SMILE also represses estrogen receptor-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) 
transactivation. Knockdown of SMILE gene expression increases ERRgamma activity. 
SMILE directly interacts with ERRgamma in vitro and in vivo. Domain mapping 
analysis showed that SMILE binds to the AF2 domain of ERRgamma. SMILE represses 
ERRgamma transactivation partially through competition with coactivators 
PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta, and GRIP1. Interestingly, the repression of SMILE on 
ERRgamma is released by SIRT1 inhibitors, a catalytically inactive SIRT1 mutant, 
and SIRT1 small interfering RNA but not by histone protein deacetylase 
inhibitor. In vivo glutathione S-transferase pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation 
assays validated that SMILE physically interacts with SIRT1. Furthermore, the 
ERRgamma inverse agonist GSK5182 enhances the interaction of SMILE with ERRgamma 
and SMILE-mediated repression. Knockdown of SMILE or SIRT1 blocks the repressive 
effect of GSK5182. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that 
GSK5182 augments the association of SMILE and SIRT1 on the promoter of the 
ERRgamma target PDK4. GSK5182 and adenoviral overexpression of SMILE cooperate 
to repress ERRgamma-induced PDK4 gene expression, and this repression is 
released by overexpression of a catalytically defective SIRT1 mutant. Finally, 
we demonstrated that ERRgamma regulates SMILE gene expression, which in turn 
inhibits ERRgamma. Overall, these findings implicate SMILE as a novel 
corepressor of ERRgamma and recruitment of SIRT1 as a novel repressive mechanism 
for SMILE and ERRgamma inverse agonist.
