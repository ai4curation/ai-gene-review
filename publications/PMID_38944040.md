We describe a next-generation Drosophila protein interaction 
map-"DPIM2"-established from affinity purification-mass spectrometry of 5,805 
baits, covering the largest fraction of the Drosophila proteome. The network 
contains 32,668 interactions among 3,644 proteins, organized into 632 clusters 
representing putative functional modules. Our analysis expands the pool of known 
protein interactions in Drosophila, provides annotation for poorly studied 
genes, and postulates previously undescribed protein interaction relationships. 
The predictive power and functional relevance of this network are probed through 
the lens of the Notch signaling pathway, and we find that newly identified 
members of complexes that include known Notch modifiers can also modulate Notch 
signaling. DPIM2 allows direct comparisons with a recently published human 
protein interaction network, defining the existence of functional interactions 
conserved across species. Thus, DPIM2 defines a valuable resource for predicting 
protein co-complex memberships and functional associations as well as generates 
functional hypotheses regarding specific protein interactions.
