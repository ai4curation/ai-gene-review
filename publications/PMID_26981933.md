BACKGROUND: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by 
late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia in the absence of predisposing factors. The 
genetic cause is unknown in the majority of cases, and less than 10% of patients 
have a family history of the disease. Most patients have normal numbers of B 
cells but lack plasma cells.
METHODS: We used whole-exome sequencing and array-based comparative genomic 
hybridization to evaluate a subset of patients with CVID and low B-cell numbers. 
Mutant proteins were analyzed for DNA binding with the use of an electrophoretic 
mobility-shift assay (EMSA) and confocal microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to 
analyze peripheral-blood lymphocytes and bone marrow aspirates.
RESULTS: Six different heterozygous mutations in IKZF1, the gene encoding the 
transcription factor IKAROS, were identified in 29 persons from six families. In 
two families, the mutation was a de novo event in the proband. All the 
mutations, four amino acid substitutions, an intragenic deletion, and a 4.7-Mb 
multigene deletion involved the DNA-binding domain of IKAROS. The proteins 
bearing missense mutations failed to bind target DNA sequences on EMSA and 
confocal microscopy; however, they did not inhibit the binding of wild-type 
IKAROS. Studies in family members showed progressive loss of B cells and serum 
immunoglobulins. Bone marrow aspirates in two patients had markedly decreased 
early B-cell precursors, but plasma cells were present. Acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia developed in 2 of the 29 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor IKAROS caused an 
autosomal dominant form of CVID that is associated with a striking decrease in 
B-cell numbers. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).
