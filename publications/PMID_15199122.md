MLL (for mixed-lineage leukemia) is a proto-oncogene that is mutated in a 
variety of human leukemias. Its product, a homolog of Drosophila melanogaster 
trithorax, displays intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity and functions 
genetically to maintain embryonic Hox gene expression. Here we report the 
biochemical purification of MLL and demonstrate that it associates with a cohort 
of proteins shared with the yeast and human SET1 histone methyltransferase 
complexes, including a homolog of Ash2, another Trx-G group protein. Two other 
members of the novel MLL complex identified here are host cell factor 1 (HCF-1), 
a transcriptional coregulator, and the related HCF-2, both of which specifically 
interact with a conserved binding motif in the MLL(N) (p300) subunit of MLL and 
provide a potential mechanism for regulating its antagonistic transcriptional 
properties. Menin, a product of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene, is also a 
component of the 1-MDa MLL complex. Abrogation of menin expression phenocopies 
loss of MLL and reveals a critical role for menin in the maintenance of Hox gene 
expression. Oncogenic mutant forms of MLL retain an ability to interact with 
menin but not other identified complex components. These studies link the menin 
tumor suppressor protein with the MLL histone methyltransferase machinery, with 
implications for Hox gene expression in development and leukemia pathogenesis.
