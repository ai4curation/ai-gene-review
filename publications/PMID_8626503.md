The neuronal-specific Elav-like proteins (HuD, Hel-N, and HuC) contain three 
RNP-type concensus motifs and bind to AU-rich elements. We have identified and 
cloned a fourth member of this family (HuR) that is expressed in a wide variety 
of cell types. The purified recombinant protein binds avidly to the AU-rich 
element in c-fos and interleukin-3 mRNAs. In the case of the c-fos AU-rich 
element, HuR binds to a core element of 27 nucleotides that contain AUUUA, 
AUUUUA, and AUUUUUA motifs. Mutational analysis has shown that all three AU 
motifs are required for maximal binding.
