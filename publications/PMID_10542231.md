The proline-rich domain of synaptojanin 1, a synaptic protein with 
phosphatidylinositol phosphatase activity, binds to amphiphysin and to a family 
of recently discovered proteins known as the SH3p4/8/13, the SH3-GL, or the 
endophilin family. These interactions are mediated by SH3 domains and are 
believed to play a regulatory role in synaptic vesicle recycling. We have 
precisely mapped the target peptides on human synaptojanin that are recognized 
by the SH3 domains of endophilins and amphiphysin and proven that they are 
distinct. By a combination of different approaches, selection of phage displayed 
peptide libraries, substitution analyses of peptides synthesized on cellulose 
membranes, and a peptide scan spanning a 252-residue long synaptojanin fragment, 
we have concluded that amphiphysin binds to two sites, PIRPSR and PTIPPR, 
whereas endophilin has a distinct preferred binding site, PKRPPPPR. The 
comparison of the results obtained by phage display and substitution analysis 
permitted the identification of proline and arginine at positions 4 and 6 in the 
PIRPSR and PTIPPR target sequence as the major determinants of the recognition 
specificity mediated by the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1. More complex is the 
structural rationalization of the preferred endophilin ligands where SH3 binding 
cannot be easily interpreted in the framework of the "classical" type I or type 
II SH3 binding models. Our results suggest that the binding repertoire of SH3 
domains may be more complex than originally predicted.
