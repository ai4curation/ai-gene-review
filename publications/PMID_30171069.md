The tumor suppressor F-box protein 31 (FBXO31) is indispensable for maintaining 
genomic stability. Its levels drastically increase following DNA damage, leading 
to cyclin D1 and MDM2 degradation and G1 and G2/M arrest. Prolonged arrest in 
these phases leads to cellular senescence. Accordingly, FBXO31 needs to be kept 
at low basal levels in unstressed conditions for normal cell cycle progression 
during growth and development. However, the molecular mechanism maintaining 
these basal FBXO31 levels has remained unclear. Here, we identified the F-box 
family SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO46 (SCFFBXO46) as an important proteasomal 
regulator of FBXO31 and found that FBXO46 helps maintain basal FBXO31 levels 
under unstressed conditions and thereby prevents premature senescence. Using 
molecular docking and mutational studies, we showed that FBXO46 recognizes an 
RXXR motif located at the FBXO31 C terminus to direct its polyubiquitination and 
thereby proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, FBXO46 depletion enhanced the 
basal levels of FBXO31, resulting in senescence induction. In response to 
genotoxic stress, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) Ser/Thr kinase-mediated 
phosphorylation of FBXO31 at Ser-278 maintained FBXO31 levels. In contrast, 
activated ATM phosphorylated FBXO46 at Ser-21/Ser-67, leading to its degradation 
via FBXO31. Thus, ATM-catalyzed phosphorylation after DNA damage governs FBXO31 
levels and FBXO46 degradation via a negative feedback loop. Collectively, our 
findings reveal that FBXO46 is a crucial proteasomal regulator of FBXO31 and 
thereby prevents senescence in normal growth conditions. They further indicate 
that FBXO46-mediated regulation of FBXO31 is abrogated following genotoxic 
stress to promote increased FBXO31 levels for maintenance of genomic stability.
