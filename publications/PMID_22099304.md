A20 is a potent anti-inflammatory protein that inhibits NF-κB, and A20 
dysfunction is associated with autoimmunity and B cell lymphoma. A20 harbors a 
deubiquitination enzyme domain and can employ multiple mechanisms to antagonize 
ubiquitination upstream of NEMO, a regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase complex 
(IKK). However, direct evidence of IKK inhibition by A20 is lacking, and the 
inhibitory mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we show that A20 can 
directly impair IKK activation without deubiquitination or impairment of 
ubiquitination enzymes. We find that polyubiquitin binding by A20, which is 
largely dependent on A20's seventh zinc-finger motif (ZnF7), induces specific 
binding to NEMO. Remarkably, this ubiquitin-induced recruitment of A20 to NEMO 
is sufficient to block IKK phosphorylation by its upstream kinase TAK1. Our 
results suggest a noncatalytic mechanism of IKK inhibition by A20 and a means by 
which polyubiquitin chains can specify a signaling outcome.
