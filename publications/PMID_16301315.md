Saliva of blood-sucking arthropods contains a complex and diverse mixture of 
antihemostatic, antiinflammatory, and immunomodulatory compounds. The D7 
salivary family of proteins is abundantly expressed in blood-feeding Diptera and 
is distantly related to the odorant-binding protein superfamily. In mosquitoes, 
two subfamilies exist, the long and short D7 proteins. Ticks and kissing bugs 
evolved salivary lipocalins that act as efficient scavengers of biogenic amines, 
and a similar function was postulated for the D7 proteins. Accordingly, we 
expressed the five members of the small D7 family of the African malaria vector 
Anopheles gambiae and a D7 long form from Aedes aegypti and showed by isothermal 
microcalorimetry, a modified and very sensitive non-equilibrium 
chromatography/spectrum distortion method, and by smooth muscle bioassay that 
four of these five short D7 proteins and the D7 long form bind serotonin with 
high affinity, as well as histamine and norepinephrine. The nonbinding D7 
protein is poorly expressed in the salivary glands and appears to be on the path 
to becoming a pseudogene. Scavenging of host amines would antagonize their 
vasoconstrictor, platelet-aggregating, and pain-inducing properties. It appears 
that counteracting biogenic amines is of strong adaptive value in the convergent 
evolution of arthropods to hematophagy. This adaptation has been solved 
independently in ticks, bugs, and mosquitoes by co-option of either member of 
the lipocalin or, as shown here, by the odorant-binding protein families.
