Chronic stalling of DNA replication forks caused by DNA damage can lead to 
genomic instability. Cells have evolved lesion bypass pathways such as 
postreplication repair (PRR) to resolve these arrested forks. In yeast, one 
branch of PRR involves proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 
polyubiquitination mediated by the Rad5-Ubc13-Mms2 complex that allows bypass of 
DNA lesion by a template-switching mechanism. Previously, we identified human 
SHPRH as a functional homologue of yeast Rad5 and revealed the existence of 
RAD5-like pathway in human cells. Here we report the identification of HLTF as a 
second RAD5 homologue in human cells. HLTF, like SHPRH, shares a unique domain 
architecture with Rad5 and promotes lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA. 
Similar to yeast Rad5, HLTF is able to interact with UBC13 and PCNA, as well as 
SHPRH; and the reduction of either SHPRH or HLTF expression enhances spontaneous 
mutagenesis. Moreover, Hltf-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts show elevated 
chromosome breaks and fusions after methyl methane sulfonate treatment. Our 
results suggest that HLTF and SHPRH are functional homologues of yeast Rad5 that 
cooperatively mediate PCNA polyubiquitination and maintain genomic stability.
