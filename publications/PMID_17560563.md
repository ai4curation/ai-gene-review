The key role played by Fgf10 during early lung development is clearly 
illustrated in Fgf10 knockout mice, which exhibit lung agenesis. However, Fgf10 
is continuously expressed throughout lung development suggesting extended as 
well as additional roles for FGF10 at later stages of lung organogenesis. We 
previously reported that the enhancer trap Mlcv1v-nLacZ-24 transgenic mouse 
strain functions as a reporter for Fgf10 expression and displays decreased 
endogenous Fgf10 expression. In this paper, we have generated an allelic series 
to determine the impact of Fgf10 dosage on lung development. We report that 80% 
of the newborn Fgf10 hypomorphic mice die within 24 h of birth due to 
respiratory failure. These mutant mouse lungs display severe hypoplasia, 
dilation of the distal airways and large hemorrhagic areas. Epithelial 
differentiation and proliferation studies indicate a specific decrease in TTF1 
and SP-B expressing cells correlating with reduced epithelial cell proliferation 
and associated with a decrease in activation of the canonical Wnt signaling in 
the epithelium. Analysis of vascular development shows a reduction in PECAM 
expression at E14.5, which is associated with a simplification of the vascular 
tree at E18.5. We also show a decrease in alpha-SMA expression in the 
respiratory airway suggesting defective smooth muscle cell formation. At the 
molecular level, these defects are associated with decrease in Vegfa and Pdgfa 
expression likely resulting from the decrease of the epithelial/mesenchymal 
ratio in the Fgf10 hypomorphic lungs. Thus, our results indicate that FGF10 
plays a pivotal role in maintaining epithelial progenitor cell proliferation as 
well as coordinating alveolar smooth muscle cell formation and vascular 
development.

Introduction

Fibroblast Growth Factor 10 (FGF10) is responsible for directed outgrowth of the lung endoderm ( Bellusci et al., 1997 ). In the developing lung, Fgf10 is expressed in the distal mesenchyme at sites where prospective epithelial buds will appear. Moreover, its dynamic pattern of expression and its ability to induce epithelial expansion and budding in organ cultures have led to the hypothesis that FGF10 governs the directional outgrowth of lung buds during branching morphogenesis ( Bellusci et al., 1997 ). Furthermore, FGF10 was shown to induce chemotaxis of the distal lung epithelium ( Park et al., 1998 ; Weaver et al., 2000 ). Consistent with these observations, Fgf10 null mutants show multiple organ defects including complete lung agenesis ( Min et al., 1998 ; Sekine et al., 1999 ), therefore excluding the study of subsequent FGF10 roles during lung development. FGF10 is the main ligand for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2b (FGFR2b) during embryonic development as demonstrated by the remarkable similarity of phenotypes exhibited by embryos where these genes have been inactivated ( Min et al. 1998 ; Sekine et al. 1999 , Burns et al., 2004 ; De Moerlooze et al., 2000 ; Mailleux et al., 2002 ; Burns et al., 2004 ; del Moral et al., 2006 ). Moreover, inhibition of FGFR2b signaling at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) using a transgenic mouse line expressing a soluble FGFR2b (FGFR2b-HFc) under the control of an inducible lung-specific, Surfactant protein C promoter ( SpC-rtTA ), resulted in decreased epithelial morphogenesis before birth and caused severe emphysema at maturity ( Hokuto et al., 2003 ). Interestingly, Fgf10 expression levels increase as the lung develops between E11.5 and E18.5, ( Bellusci et al., 1997 ), suggesting that Fgf10 most likely plays an extended and vital role during late lung organogenesis.

We have previously shown that a transgenic mouse line with the β-galactosidase gene under the control of Fgf10 regulatory sequences can be used to monitor Fgf10 expression in the heart, lung and somites ( Kelly et al., 2001 ; Mailleux et al., 2005 ; Veltmaat et al., 2006 ). Originally, Kelly et al. (2001) sought to express LacZ under the control of the myocardial ventricular-slow skeletal muscle Myosin Alkali-light chain ( Mlc1v ) promoter. In one of four founders, the expression pattern in the developing heart suggested that LacZ was under the control of Fgf10 regulatory sequences. In addition, analysis of the integration site showed that the Mlc1v-LacZ cassette had integrated 120 kb upstream of the Fgf10 gene. Based on the expression pattern as well as on the site of insertion, the authors proposed that LacZ expression was under the control of Fgf10 regulatory sequences. We reported that the insertion of the Mlc1v-LacZ cassette disrupted the endogeneous expression of Fgf10 ( Mailleux et al., 2005 ). The Mlc1v-LacZ mice were crossed with Fgf10 +/− mice to generate an allelic series to determine the effect of decreasing Fgf10 expression on parabronchial smooth muscle cell formation. We also demonstrated that Fgf10 identifies a new population of parabronchial smooth muscle cell progenitors located in the sub-mesothelial mesenchyme ( Mailleux et al., 2005 ).

In this paper, we report our analysis of Fgf10 hypomorphic ( Fgf10 +/− ; Mlc1v-LacZ +/− ) lungs at various developmental stages. Newborn Fgf10 hypomorphic mice exhibit respiratory failure and consequently die within 48 hours. Analysis shows severe lung hypoplasia, dilation of the distal airways and large hemorrhagic areas. Therefore, this mouse represents a unique opportunity to study the role of FGF10 in coordinating epithelial morphogenesis with the differentiation of the mesenchyme, in particular with the formation of alveolar smooth muscle cells and the vasculature.

Insertion of theMlc1v-LacZcassette results in decreased endogenousFgf10expression

We recently published that the insertion of the Mlvc1v-LacZ cassette 120 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of the Fgf10 gene, resulted in a general decrease in Fgf10 expression in the embryo ( Mailleux et al., 2005 ; Veltmaat et al., 2006 ). We took advantage of this characteristic of the Mlc1v-LacZ line to generate an allelic series to determine the impact of Fgf10 dosage on lung development. Mlc1v-LacZ +/− line was crossed with Fgf10 neo null allele heterozygote line (denoted as Fgf10 - ) to generate Fgf10 +/+ ; Mlc1v-LacZ −/− (wild type), Fgf10 +/+ ; Mlc1v-LacZ +/− , Fgf10 +/− ; Mlc1v-LacZ −/− (called thereafter Fgf10 +/− ) and Fgf10 +/− ; Mlc1v-LacZ +/− (called also thereafter Fgf10 hypomorph) embryos at different developmental stages. As the lungs of embryos corresponding to the first three genotypes ( Fgf10 +/+ ; Mlc1v-LacZ −/− (wild type), Fgf10 +/+ ; Mlc1v-LacZ +/− and Fgf10 +/− ; Mlc1v-LacZ −/− (or Fgf10 +/− )) were phenotypically identical throughout all the developmental stages examined (data not shown), we considered as control for this study, among these 3 genotypes, the one corresponding to the lowest expression of Fgf10 ( Fgf10 +/− ). 47 Fgf10 +/− ; Mlc1v-LacZ +/− compound heterozygous embryos were generated at expected Mendelian ratios and examined at different stages. As expected, real time PCR experiments show that Fgf10 expression is reduced by 27% in E14.5 Fgf10 +/− ; Mlc1v-LacZ +/− lungs compared to corresponding Fgf10 +/− lungs ( Fig. 1A,B ; n=3, P=0.005).

Discussion

Fgf10 −/− embryos display lung agenesis precluding functional analysis of Fgf10 during subsequent lung development. Here, we show that, in addition to its use as a reporter for Fgf10 expression, the Mlc1v-LacZ transgenic line also represents a hypomorphic allele of Fgf10 . This allowed us to determine the in vivo role of Fgf10 during the later phases of lung development. Newborn Fgf10 +/− ; Mlc1v-LacZ +/− compound heterozygote mice exhibit severe respiratory defects and most die within 24 hours of birth. During embryogenesis, the Fgf10 +/− ; Mlc1v-LacZ +/− lungs display significant hypoplasia, associated with dilated distal airways. Analysis of vascular development shows a reduction in PECAM expression at E14.5. This reduction is associated with simplification of the vascular tree at E18.5. E18.5 mutant lungs also display reduced expression of α-SMA in the respiratory airways indicating abnormal alveolar smooth muscle cell formation. These defects are associated with a decrease in Vegfa and Pdgfa expression, both expressed in the epithelium.
