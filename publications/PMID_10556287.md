We report the cloning and genetic characterization of one human and two murine 
homologs of the mab-21 cell fate specification gene. mab-21 participates in the 
formation of sensory organs in the male nematode tail, and is essential for 
other developmental functions elsewhere in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. 
The expanding mab-21 gene family, which is strikingly conserved in evolution, 
includes two putative Drosophila members. The two mammalian genes, encoding 41 
kDa nuclear basic proteins, are expressed in partially overlapping territories 
in the embryonic brain, eye and limbs, as well as in neural crest derivatives. 
Recent genetic data implicating mab-21 as a downstream target of TGF-beta 
signaling, together with the distribution of mab-21 transcripts in the mouse 
embryo, propose these novel genes as relevant factors in various aspects of 
vertebrate neural development.
