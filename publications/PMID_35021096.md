Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell. Dysfunction of 
mitochondria homeostasis induces the mitochondrial unfolded protein response 
(UPRmt), altering cellular metabolism. How cells sense the UPRmt to rewire 
metabolism is largely unknown. Here, we show that inactivation of either the 
citric/tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes aco-2 or idha-1, which encode 
aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase respectively, leads to citrate 
accumulation. In Caenorhabditis elegans, both in vitro and in vivo, citrate 
accumulation consequently triggers the UPRmt and also promotes lipid 
accumulation. The transcription factor DVE-1 binds to the promoter of the 
nuclear hormone receptor nhr-80 to transactivate its expression. NHR-80 then 
upregulates lipogenesis and lipid accumulation, shifting excess citrate for use 
in lipogenesis and for storage as triacylglycerol in lipid droplets. 
Inactivation of DVE-1 or NHR-80 fully abolishes the citrate-induced lipid 
accumulation. Therefore, our work uncovers a DVE-1-NHR-80-lipogenesis axis 
linking the transmission of the mitochondrial stress signal to lipid metabolism.
