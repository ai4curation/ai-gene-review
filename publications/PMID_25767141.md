Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to play an important role in the 
regulation of human sperm function. In this study, we demonstrate for the first 
time that human spermatozoa possess interleukin-induced gene 1 (IL4I1), an 
l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) which is capable of generating ROS on exposure to 
aromatic amino acids in the presence of oxygen. The preferred substrates were 
found to be phenylalanine and tryptophan while the enzyme was located in the 
acrosomal region and midpiece of these cells. In contrast to equine and bovine 
spermatozoa, enzyme activity was lost as soon as the spermatozoa became 
non-viable. On a cell-to-cell basis human spermatozoa were also shown to 
generate lower levels of hydrogen peroxide than their equine counterparts on 
exposure to phenylalanine. Stimulation of LAAO activity resulted in the 
induction of several hallmarks of capacitation including tyrosine 
phosphorylation of the sperm flagellum and concomitant activation of phospho-SRC 
expression. In addition, stimulation of LAAO resulted in an increase in the 
levels of acrosomal exocytosis in both the presence and absence of progesterone 
stimulation, via mechanisms that could be significantly reversed by the presence 
of catalase. As is often the case with free radical-mediated phenomena, 
prolonged exposure of human spermatozoa to phenylalanine resulted in the 
stimulation of apoptosis as indicated by significant increases in mitochondrial 
superoxide generation and the activation of intracellular caspases. These 
results confirm the existence of an LAAO in human spermatozoa with a potential 
role in driving the redox regulation of sperm capacitation and acrosomal 
exocytosis.
