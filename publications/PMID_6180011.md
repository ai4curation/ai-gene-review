Two subgroups of HLA Bw44 defined by cell-mediated lympholysis that differ in 
Bw44 expression on platelets and in patterns of genetic linkage disequilibrium.

Possible immunogenic heterogeneity of the HLA-Bw44 antigen was investigated 
using cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) generated between donors identical for 
HLA-A2,3,-B7,w44. Highly discriminatory CTL combinations were identified that 
defined two subgroups of Bw44, designated 44.1 and 44.2. Out of 47 Bw44-positive 
donors tested in a population study, 30 were lysed by the CTL defining 44.1, and 
19 were lysed by the CTL defining 44.2. All Bw44 cells could be typed as either 
44.1 or 44.2, except two Bw44-positive cells that were phenotypically homozygous 
for the serologically defined Bw44 antigen and were lysed by both CTL. No 
Bw44-negative donors (zero out of 37) expressed either 44.1 or 44.2, although 
cold target blocking was required to eliminate a contaminating reactivity of one 
CTL population on Bw35 and some Bw45 cells. CTL were also raised between 
responder/stimulator combinations mismatched for Bw44. These CTL lysed all 
Bw44-positive target cells, indicating a CML antigen shared by all Bw44 cells. 
But clear discrimination of the 44.1 and 44.2 subgroups was obtained when 
appropriate cold target blocking cells were added. All donors with 44.2 
expressed high levels of serologically detectable Bw44 on their platelets, and 
all with 44.1 expressed low levels (p less than 0.005). Furthermore, population 
studies indicate that 44.1 is in positive linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A2 and 
possibly DR4, whereas 44.2 is in positive linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DR7 
and possibly HLA-A23, -A26, and -A29. These data suggest the existence of two 
genetically and functionally different subgroups of Bw44 antigens.
