Rim15 kinase, a downstream effector of PKA and TORC1 signaling pathways, 
initiates the quiescent program upon nutrient starvation via induction of genes 
whose expression depends on transcription factors Msn2, Msn4, and Gis1. Here, we 
demonstrate that Rim15 also induces expression of Hsf1 target genes upon glucose 
depletion by both transcriptional activation and stabilization of the 
transcripts. Rim15 phosphorylates Hsf1 in vitro, suggesting that Rim15 might 
directly activate Hsf1. In addition, Igo1 and Igo2, Rim15 substrate proteins 
involved in mRNA stabilization, regulate mRNA levels of Hsf1 target genes. We 
also show that Rim15 can phosphorylate Msn2, but not Gis1, in vitro, implying 
different mechanisms for the activation of these transcription factors.
