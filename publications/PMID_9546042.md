A new member of Hsp40, HLJ1, consisting of 337 amino acids, was cloned from a 
human liver cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of HLJ1 has an 84% 
homology (69% identity) with that of HDJ-1 isolated from human placenta. 
Northern analysis showed that expression of the HLJ1 gene is heat-inducible and 
its transcription shows some degree of preference in heart, skeletal muscle, and 
pancreas.
