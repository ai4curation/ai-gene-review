Circadian rhythms in mammals are generated by a feedback loop in which the three 
PERIOD (PER) proteins, acting in a large complex, inhibit the transcriptional 
activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 dimer, which represses their own expression. 
Although fundamental, the mechanism of negative feedback in the mammalian clock, 
or any eukaryotic clock, is unknown. We analyzed protein constituents of PER 
complexes purified from mouse tissues and identified PSF (polypyrimidine 
tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor). Our analysis indicates that 
PSF within the PER complex recruits SIN3A, a scaffold for assembly of 
transcriptional inhibitory complexes and that the PER complex thereby 
rhythmically delivers histone deacetylases to the Per1 promoter, which repress 
Per1 transcription. These findings provide a function for the PER complex and a 
molecular mechanism for circadian clock negative feedback.
