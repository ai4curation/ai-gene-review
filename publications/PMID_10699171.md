Microphthalmia with linear skin defects (MLS) is an X-linked dominant, 
male-lethal syndrome characterized by microphthalmia, aplastic skin and agenesis 
of the corpus callosum, and is caused by the deletion of a 500 kb critical 
region in Xp22.3. Our laboratory isolated a novel rho GTPase-activating protein 
(rhoGAP) gene named ARHGAP6 from the MLS region. ARHGAP6 contains 14 exons 
encoding a 974 amino acid protein with three putative SH3-binding domains. 
Because exons 2-14 are deleted in all MLS patients, we hypothesized that ARHGAP6 
may be responsible for some of the phenotypic features of MLS. We pursued two 
approaches to study the function of ARHGAP6 and its role in the pathogenesis of 
MLS: gene targeting of the rhoGAP domain in mouse embryonic stem cells and in 
vitro expression studies. Surprisingly, loss of the rhoGAP function of Arhgap6 
does not cause any detectable phenotypic or behavioral abnormalities in the 
mutant mice. Transfected mammalian cells expressing ARHGAP6 lose their actin 
stress fibers, retract from the growth surface and extend thin, branching 
processes resembling filopodia. The ARHGAP6 protein co-localizes with actin 
filaments through an N-terminal domain and recruits F-actin into the growing 
processes. Mutation of a conserved arginine residue in the rhoGAP domain 
prevents the loss of stress fibers but has little effect on process outgrowth. 
These results suggest that ARHGAP6 has two independent functions: one as a GAP 
with specificity for RhoA and the other as a cytoskeletal protein that promotes 
actin remodeling.
