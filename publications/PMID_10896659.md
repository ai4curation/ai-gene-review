protein displaying oligomeric organization.

Drosophila melanogaster has four main small heat shock proteins (Hsps), D. 
melanogaster Hsp22 (DmHsp22), Hsp23 (DmHsp23), Hsp26 (DmHsp26), and Hsp27 
(DmHsp27). These proteins, although they have high sequence homology, show 
distinct developmental expression patterns. The function(s) of each small heat 
shock protein is unknown. DmHsp22 is shown to localize in mitochondria both in 
D. melanogaster S2 cells and after heterologous expression in mammalian cells. 
Fractionation of mitochondria indicates that DmHsp22 resides in the 
mitochondrial matrix, where it is found in oligomeric complexes, as shown by 
sedimentation and gel filtration analysis and by cross-linking experiments. 
Deletion analysis using a DmHsp22-EGFP construct reveals that residues 1-17 and 
an unknown number of residues between 17-28 are necessary for import. 
Site-directed mutagenesis within a putative mitochondrial motif (WRMAEE) at 
positions 8-13 shows that the first four residues are necessary for 
mitochondrial localization. Immunoprecipitation results indicate that there is 
no interaction between DmHsp22 and the other small heat shock proteins. The 
mitochondrial localization of this small Hsp22 of Drosophila and its high level 
of expression in aging suggests a role for this small heat shock protein in 
protection against oxidative stress.
