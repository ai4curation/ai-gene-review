ErbB2, a metastasis-promoting oncoprotein, is overexpressed in approximately 25% 
of invasive/metastatic breast cancers, but in 50%-60% of noninvasive ductal 
carcinomas in situ (DCIS). It has been puzzling how a subset of 
ErbB2-overexpressing DCIS develops into invasive breast cancer (IBC). We found 
that co-overexpression of 14-3-3zeta in ErbB2-overexpressing DCIS conferred a 
higher risk of progression to IBC. ErbB2 and 14-3-3zeta overexpression, 
respectively, increased cell migration and decreased cell adhesion, two 
prerequisites of tumor cell invasion. 14-3-3zeta overexpression reduced cell 
adhesion by activating the TGF-beta/Smads pathway that led to ZFHX1B/SIP-1 
upregulation, E-cadherin loss, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. 
Importantly, patients whose breast tumors overexpressed both ErbB2 and 
14-3-3zeta had higher rates of metastatic recurrence and death than those whose 
tumors overexpressed only one.
