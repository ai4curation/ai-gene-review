The nef gene product of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is important 
for the induction of AIDS, and key to its function is its ability to manipulate 
T-cell function by targeting cellular signal transduction proteins. We reported 
that Nef coprecipitates a multiprotein complex from cells which contains tumor 
suppressor protein p53. We now show that Nef interacts directly with p53. 
Binding assays showed that an N-terminal, 57-residue fragment of Nef (Nef 1-57) 
contains the p53-binding domain. Nef also interacted with p53 during HIV-1 
infection in vitro. As p53 plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, 
we hypothesized that Nef may alter this process. Nef inhibited UV light-induced, 
p53-dependent apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells, with Nef 1-57 being as effective as its 
full-length counterpart. The inhibition by Nef of p53 apoptotic function is most 
likely due its observed ability to decrease p53 protein half-life and, 
consequently, p53 DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation. These 
data show that HIV-1 Nef may augment HIV replication by prolonging the viability 
of infected cells by blocking p53-mediated apoptosis.

Abstract

The nef gene product of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is important for the induction of AIDS, and key to its function is its ability to manipulate T-cell function by targeting cellular signal transduction proteins. We reported that Nef coprecipitates a multiprotein complex from cells which contains tumor suppressor protein p53. We now show that Nef interacts directly with p53. Binding assays showed that an N-terminal, 57-residue fragment of Nef (Nef 1-57) contains the p53-binding domain. Nef also interacted with p53 during HIV-1 infection in vitro. As p53 plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, we hypothesized that Nef may alter this process. Nef inhibited UV light-induced, p53-dependent apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells, with Nef 1-57 being as effective as its full-length counterpart. The inhibition by Nef of p53 apoptotic function is most likely due its observed ability to decrease p53 protein half-life and, consequently, p53 DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation. These data show that HIV-1 Nef may augment HIV replication by prolonging the viability of infected cells by blocking p53-mediated apoptosis.

DISCUSSION

In this report we provide conclusive evidence showing that Nef expressed both alone and during HIV-1 infection can protect cells against UV-induced, p53-dependent apoptosis. A direct protein interaction between p53 and the N-terminal 57 amino acids of Nef mediates this effect. Binding of Nef to p53 shortens its intracellular half-life, reduces UV-induced p53 accumulation, and inhibits p53 transcriptional activation. Taken together these effects dramatically reduce intracellular p53 concentrations and activity. The ability of Nef to inhibit p53-dependent apoptotic events correlates directly with its control of intracellular p53 concentration and cell viability during HIV-1 infection of CD4 + T cells. The ability of Nef to inhibit apoptosis is likely to be an important feature of its capacity to enhance virus replication and by association may be related to the increased pathogenicity linked with the expression of Nef during HIV-1 infection in vivo. Nef now joins E1A, E6, and other viral proteins in modulating apoptosis through an interaction with p53 ( 55 ). The conserved function of Nef action on p53 is also supported by our studies with the nef genes from two primary HIV-1 isolates.

We have mapped the p53-binding domain within Nef to its N-terminal region. A fragment of Nef corresponding to amino acid residues 1 to 57 binds directly to p53 as efficiently as its full-length counterpart, while p53 binding to Nef is abolished by deletion of the first 19 amino acid residues of Nef. Hence it is possible that the precise binding region for p53 resides within the first 19 amino acid residues, although inclusion of a synthetic peptide corresponding to this region of Nef into the binding assays did not support binding to p53. Most likely the first 19 amino acid residues of Nef play an important role in stabilizing a conformation of Nef which is necessary for p53 interaction and/or the precise interactive domain requires elements near the junction of each Nef fragment (amino acid residues 1 to 19 and 20 to 206). Indeed, Nef 20-206 displays reduced binding capacity for Lck despite the fact that the binding domain for Lck resides within the proline repeat motif (amino acid residues 69 to 78) of Nef (unpublished data). While there is considerable sequence heterogeneity within the N-terminal 57 amino acid residues of Nef, clusters of highly conserved residues, which may represent the p53 binding domain, are present. In particular, amino acid residues 18 to 32 (ERMRRAEPAADGVGA) of Nef are highly conserved among all Nef sequences reported ( 52 ).

The activity of Nef against p53 resembles to that of MDM-2. MDM-2, a 409-amino-acid protein, plays a role in the regulation of p53 by directly binding to p53 ( 4 ). Overexpression of MDM-2 inhibits the transcriptional activation of p53 and can inhibit p53-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ( 4 ), ( 39 ). Like MDM-2 ( 4 ), Nef inhibited the ability of p53 to bind and transactivate a target promoter containing the p53 consensus target DNA sequence. Nef, like MDM-2, may, by binding directly to the N-terminal region of p53 (its transactivation domain), block interaction of p53 with transcriptional coactivator proteins such as transcription factor TAF31 ( 57 ). Concurrently, reduced DNA binding activity by p53 and p53-mediated transcriptional activation may be related to its destabilization by Nef. This argument is supported by a significant decrease in the steady-state level of p53 induced by Nef. Additionally, Nef prevented an increase in p53 levels in response to stress signals such as UV radiation. Normally the p53 protein is kept at a low concentration in a cell by its relatively short half-life ( 25 , 35 ). MDM-2, which promotes p53 degradation in a manner dependent on its direct interaction with p53, is thought to play a key role in maintaining low levels of p53 in normal cells ( 23 ). As Nef displays functional characteristics similar to those of MDM-2, it may promote degradation of p53 in a similar fashion.

Subcellular localization of Nef and p53 will be a determining factor in their complex formation. Detailed immunohistochemical and subcellular fractionation studies have shown that, while Nef is predominantly plasma membrane localized, significant amounts of Nef protein are also found in the cytoplasm and nucleus ( 27 , 32 , 40 , 41 , 43 ). Similarly, MDM-2 localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm ( 4 ). Transient expression of a full-length Nef protein in 293T cells confirmed the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of Nef (A. L. Greenway et al., unpublished data). Furthermore, colocalization studies using immunofluorescence staining for p53 and Nef expressed during transfection showed that Nef and p53 colocalize in the nucleus, whereas p53 predominates in 293T cells (A. L. Greenway et al., unpublished data). Colocalization of Nef and p53 is consistent with the interaction between Nef and p53. A Nef-EGFP fusion protein corresponding to amino acid residues 1 to 75 demonstrated a localization pattern identical to that of its full-length Nef counterpart in 293T cells, suggesting that the N terminus of Nef is sufficient to enable nuclear localization (A. L. Greenway et al., unpublished data). During HIV-1 infection nuclear localization of Nef appears to be dependent on the coincidence of the infection cycle with the peak of virus production ( 43 ). Normally, p53 is localized in the cytoplasm, the nucleus, or both subcompartments of the cell, and to execute transcriptional activation p53 must enter the cell nucleus ( 30 , 51 ). The overlapping spatial arrangement of Nef and p53 may allow interaction. It is of interest that conformational changes within p53 which can be brought about by protein-protein interaction may play a major role in p53 subcellular distribution ( 60 ).

Other mechanisms for inhibition of apoptosis by Nef also exist. Nef blocks T-cell receptor (TcR)-mediated apoptosis in CD4 + T cells via its interactions with src family kinases Lck and Fyn and MAPK (A. L. Greenway et al., unpublished data). Regulation of p53-mediated apoptosis by Nef represents a second mechanism whereby Nef can regulate the survival of the HIV-1-infected cell. In fact, modulation of src kinases and MAPK by Nef may represent additional mechanisms by which HIV alters p53 activity. High expression of Ras or activation of the MAPK pathway induces wild-type p53 levels and causes a permanent growth arrest ( 13 , 50 ). Similarly, in a cell line defective in both the MAPK pathway and in p53 expression, increased expression and activity of MAPK restore the normal levels of p53. This effect may be due to phosphorylation of p53 by MAPK, thereby stabilizing the protein ( 35 , 37 ). The ability of Nef to regulate events which occur at the plasma membrane by targeting src family kinases and MAPK coupled with its ability to control p53 activity suggests that Nef may target different proteins depending upon it subcellular localization. Thus, Nef may create multiple opportunities to control normal cellular events for the benefit of virus replication.

Many oncogenic or transforming viruses encode proteins which inactivate p53 ( 55 ). For example, the simian virus 40 T antigen prevents DNA binding by p53, while the E6 protein of human papillomavirus targets p53 to the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway ( 55 ). Further still, adenovirus encodes two proteins of 19 and 55 kDa which modulate p53 activity; in particular, the 55-kDa protein interacts with p53 that is bound to its specific DNA recognition element and prevents transactivation ( 55 ). The present study highlights a further example of a viral protein which targets p53 and underscores the importance of controlling this complex transcription/tumor suppressor factor during virus infection.
