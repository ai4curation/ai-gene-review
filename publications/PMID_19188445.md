APE1/Ref-1 (hereafter, APE1), a DNA repair enzyme and a transcriptional 
coactivator, is a vital protein in mammals. Its role in controlling cell growth 
and the molecular mechanisms that fine-tune its different cellular functions are 
still not known. By an unbiased proteomic approach, we have identified and 
characterized several novel APE1 partners which, unexpectedly, include a number 
of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. In particular, a 
novel interaction between nucleophosmin (NPM1) and APE1 was characterized. We 
observed that the 33 N-terminal residues of APE1 are required for stable 
interaction with the NPM1 oligomerization domain. As a consequence of the 
interaction with NPM1 and RNA, APE1 is localized within the nucleolus and this 
localization depends on cell cycle and active rRNA transcription. NPM1 
stimulates APE1 endonuclease activity on abasic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but 
decreases APE1 endonuclease activity on abasic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) by 
masking the N-terminal region of APE1 required for stable RNA binding. In 
APE1-knocked-down cells, pre-rRNA synthesis and rRNA processing were not 
affected but inability to remove 8-hydroxyguanine-containing rRNA upon oxidative 
stress, impaired translation, lower intracellular protein content, and decreased 
cell growth rate were found. Our data demonstrate that APE1 affects cell growth 
by directly acting on RNA quality control mechanisms, thus affecting gene 
expression through posttranscriptional mechanisms.
