Common fragile sites are loci that form chromosome gaps or breaks when DNA 
synthesis is partially inhibited. Fragile sites are prone to deletions, 
translocations, and other rearrangements that can cause the inactivation of 
associated tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. It was previously shown that 
ATR is critical to fragile-site stability and that ATR-deficient cells have 
greatly elevated fragile-site expression (A. M. Casper, P. Nghiem, M. F. Arlt, 
and T. W. Glover, Cell 111:779-789, 2002). Here we demonstrate that mouse and 
human cells deficient for BRCA1, due to mutation or knockdown by RNA 
interference, also have elevated fragile-site expression. We further show that 
BRCA1 functions in the induction of the G(2)/M checkpoint after 
aphidicolin-induced replication stalling and that this checkpoint function is 
involved in fragile-site stability. These data indicate that BRCA1 is important 
in fragile-site stability and that fragile sites are recognized by the G(2)/M 
checkpoint pathway, in which BRCA1 plays a key role. Furthermore, they suggest 
that mutations in BRCA1 or interacting proteins could lead to rearrangements at 
fragile sites in cancer cells.
