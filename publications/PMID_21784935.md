Fimbrial ushers are the largest β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) known to 
date, which function in the polymerization of fimbriae and their translocation 
to the bacterial surface. Folding and assembly of these complex OMPs are not 
characterized. Here, we investigate the role of periplasmic chaperones (SurA, 
Skp, DegP, and FkpA) and individual components of the β-barrel assembly 
machinery (BAM) complex (BamA, BamB, BamC, and BamE) in the folding of the 
Escherichia coli FimD usher. The FimD level is dramatically reduced (∼30-fold) 
in a surA null mutant, but a strong cell envelope stress is constitutively 
activated with upregulation of DegP (∼10-fold). To demonstrate a direct role of 
SurA, FimD folding was analyzed in a conditional surA mutant in which SurA 
expression was controlled. In this strain, FimD is depleted from bacteria in 
parallel to SurA without significant upregulation of DegP. Interestingly, the 
dependency on SurA is higher for FimD than for other OMPs. We also demonstrate 
that a functional BAM complex is needed for folding of FimD. In addition, FimD 
levels were strongly reduced (∼5-fold) in a mutant lacking the accessory 
lipoprotein BamB. The critical role of BamB for FimD folding was confirmed by 
complementation and BamB depletion experiments. Similar to SurA dependency, FimD 
showed a stronger dependency on BamB than OMPs. On the other hand, folding of 
FimD was only marginally affected in bamC and bamE mutants. Collectively, our 
results indicate that FimD usher follows the SurA-BamB pathway for its assembly. 
The preferential use of this pathway for the folding of OMPs with large 
β-barrels is discussed.
