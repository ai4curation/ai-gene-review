Initiation of transcriptional silencing at mating type loci and telomeres in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the recruitment of a Sir2/3/4 (silent 
information regulator) protein complex to the chromosome, which occurs at least 
in part through its association with the silencer- and telomere-binding protein 
Rap1p. Sir3p and Sir4p are structural components of silent chromatin that can 
self-associate, interact with each other, and bind to the amino-terminal tails 
of histones H3 and H4. We have identified a small region of Sir3p between amino 
acids 455 and 481 that is necessary and sufficient for association with the 
carboxyl terminus of Rap1p but not required for Sir complex formation or histone 
binding. SIR3 mutations that delete this region cause a silencing defect at HMR 
and telomeres. However, this impairment of repression is considerably less than 
that displayed by Rap1p carboxy-terminal truncations that are defective in Sir3p 
binding. This difference may be explained by the ability of the Rap1p carboxyl 
terminus to interact independently with Sir4p, which we demonstrate by in vitro 
binding and two-hybrid assays. Significantly, the Rap1p-Sir4p two-hybrid 
interaction does not require Sir3p and is abolished by mutation of the carboxyl 
terminus of Rap1p. We propose that both Sir3p and Sir4p can directly and 
independently bind to Rap1p at mating type silencers and telomeres and suggest 
that Rap1p-mediated recruitment of Sir proteins operates through multiple 
cooperative interactions, at least some of which are redundant. The physical 
separation of the Rap1p interaction region of Sir3p from parts of the protein 
required for Sir complex formation and histone binding raises the possibility 
that Rap1p can participate directly in the maintenance of silent chromatin 
through the stabilization of Sir complex-nucleosome interactions.
