The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of proteins has been 
implicated in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous 
recombination (HR). The SMC1/3 cohesin complex is thought to promote HR by 
maintaining the close proximity of sister chromatids at DSBs. The SMC5/6 complex 
is also required for DNA repair, but the mechanism by which it accomplishes this 
is unclear. Here, we show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the SMC5/6 complex 
components in human cells increases the efficiency of gene targeting due to a 
specific requirement for hSMC5/6 in sister chromatid HR. Knockdown of the 
hSMC5/6 complex decreases sister chromatid HR, but does not reduce nonhomologous 
end-joining (NHEJ) or intra-chromatid, homologue, or extrachromosomal HR. The 
hSMC5/6 complex is itself recruited to nuclease-induced DSBs and is required for 
the recruitment of cohesin to DSBs. Our results establish a mechanism by which 
the hSMC5/6 complex promotes DNA repair and suggest a novel strategy to improve 
the efficiency of gene targeting in mammalian somatic cells.
