SmgGDS is an atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that promotes 
both cell proliferation and migration and is up-regulated in several types of 
cancer. SmgGDS has been previously shown to activate a wide variety of small 
GTPases, including the Ras family members Rap1a, Rap1b, and K-Ras, as well as 
the Rho family members Cdc42, Rac1, Rac2, RhoA, and RhoB. In contrast, here we 
show that SmgGDS exclusively activates RhoA and RhoC among a large panel of 
purified GTPases. Consistent with the well known properties of GEFs, this 
activation is catalytic, and SmgGDS preferentially binds to nucleotide-depleted 
RhoA relative to either GDP- or GTPγS-bound forms. However, mutational analyses 
indicate that SmgGDS utilizes a distinct exchange mechanism compared with 
canonical GEFs and in contrast to known GEFs requires RhoA to retain a polybasic 
region for activation. A homology model of SmgGDS highlights an electronegative 
surface patch and a highly conserved binding groove. Mutation of either area 
ablates the ability of SmgGDS to activate RhoA. Finally, the in vitro 
specificity of SmgGDS for RhoA and RhoC is retained in cells. Together, these 
results indicate that SmgGDS is a bona fide GEF that specifically activates RhoA 
and RhoC through a unique mechanism not used by other Rho family exchange 
factors.
