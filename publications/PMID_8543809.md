binding proteins, highly conserved in human and mouse.

The Ikaros gene is an essential regulator in the development and homeostasis of 
the mouse lymphopoietic system. To study the role of the Ikaros gene in the 
human lymphopoietic system, we cloned and characterized human Ikaros cDNAs. In 
the human, as in the mouse, differential splicing of Ikaros primary transcripts 
generates a family of lymphoid-restricted zinc finger DNA binding proteins, 
highly conserved in sequence composition and relative expression to the mouse 
homologues. Expression of Ikaros isoforms is highly restricted to the 
lymphopoietic system and is particularly enriched in maturing thymocytes. The 
Ikaros gene maps at a syntenic locus located on the short arm of human 
chromosome 7 and on mouse chromosome 11 next to the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (Egfr). The high degree of conservation of the Ikaros gene at the 
genetic and expression levels strongly suggests that it plays a fundamental role 
in the ontogeny of the lymphopoietic system across species.
