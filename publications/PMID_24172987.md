The Mycoplasma genus comprises a group of microbes that cause persistent 
infection in humans and its role in promoting tumor development has long been a 
concern. Although mixtures of components isolated from Mycoplasma have been 
shown to activate host Rho family small GTPases and Stat3, no individual factor 
with this activity has been reported. In the current study, a conserved small 
GTPase-like protein fragment (SGLP) from Mycoplasma pulmonis chromosome 
partition protein, Smc, was identified as a virulence factor. SGLP was observed 
to interact with Rac1 and Stat3. The wild‑type (wt) SGLP, which contains a WxxxE 
motif, induced activation of Rac1 and phosphorylation of Stat3 at the 
tyrosine‑705 residue, while the SGLP mutant containing a mutation from WxxxE to 
AxxxA did not exert the same effects. Moreover, SGLP‑induced Stat3 
phosphorylation was observed to be dependent upon Rac1 activity. Furthermore, wt 
SGLP was observed to promote cell migration and increase bromodeoxyuridine 
incorporation in HeLa cells and the SGLP mutant did not elicit these effects in 
HeLa cells. In conclusion, the current observations suggest that SGLP is an 
important virulence factor of Mycoplasma, which contributes to tumor cell 
migration and proliferation in vitro via interaction with Rac1 and Stat3.
