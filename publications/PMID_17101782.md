The forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) transcription factor regulates expression of cell 
cycle genes essential for DNA replication and mitosis during organ repair and 
cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate that FoxM1-deficient (-/-) mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts and osteosarcoma U2OS cells depleted in FoxM1 levels by 
small interfering RNA transfection display increased DNA breaks, as evidenced by 
immunofluorescence focus staining for phosphospecific histone H2AX. 
FoxM1-deficient cells also exhibit stimulation of p53 transcriptional activity, 
as evidenced by increased expression of the p21(cip1) gene. FoxM1-deficient 
cells display reduced expression of the base excision repair factor X-ray 
cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) and breast cancer-associated gene 2 (BRCA2), 
the latter of which is involved in homologous recombination repair of DNA 
double-strand breaks. Furthermore, FoxM1 protein is phosphorylated by checkpoint 
kinase 2 (Chk2) in response to DNA damage. This phosphorylation of FoxM1 on 
serine residue 361 caused increased stability of the FoxM1 protein with 
corresponding increased transcription of XRCC1 and BRCA2 genes, both of which 
are required for repair of DNA damage. These results identify a novel role for 
FoxM1 in the transcriptional response during DNA damage/checkpoint signaling and 
show a novel mechanism by which Chk2 protein regulates expression of DNA repair 
enzymes.
