Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) kinase is a key mediator in many cellular responses 
to genotoxic stresses, including ionizing radiation (IR) and topoisomerase 
inhibitors. Upon IR, CHK2 is activated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase 
and regulates the S-phase and G1-S checkpoints, apoptosis and DNA repair by 
phosphorylating downstream target proteins, such as p53 and Brca1. In addition, 
CHK2 is thought to be a multi-organ cancer susceptibility gene. In this study, 
we used a tandem affinity purification strategy to identify proteins that 
interact with CHK2 kinase. Cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11)(p110) kinase, 
implicated in pre-mRNA splicing and transcription, was identified as a 
CHK2-interacting protein. CHK2 kinase phosphorylated CDK11(p110) on serine 737 
in vitro. Unexpectedly, CHK2 kinase constitutively phosphorylated CDK11(p110) in 
a DNA damage-independent manner. At a molecular level, CDK11(p110) 
phosphorylation was required for homodimerization without affecting its kinase 
activity. Overexpression of CHK2 promoted pre-mRNA splicing. Conversely, CHK2 
depletion decreased endogenous splicing activity. Mutation of the 
phosphorylation site in CDK11(p110) to alanine abrogated its splicing-activating 
activity. These results provide the first evidence that CHK2 kinase promotes 
pre-mRNA splicing via phosphorylating CDK11(p110).
