Through the comprehensive analysis of the genomic DNA sequence of human 
chromosome 22, we identified a novel gene of 702 kb encoding a big protein of 
2481 amino acid residues, and named it as TPRBK (TPR containing big gene cloned 
at Keio). A novel protein TPRBK possesses 25 units of the TPR motif, which has 
been known to associate with a diverse range of biological functions. 
Orthologous genes of human TPRBK were found widely in animal species, from 
insecta to mammal, but not found in plants, fungi and nematoda. Northern 
blotting and RT-PCR analyses revealed that TPRBK gene is expressed ubiquitously 
in the human and mouse fetal tissues and various cell lines of human, monkey and 
mouse. Immunofluorescent staining of the synchronized monkey COS-7 cells with 
several relevant antibodies indicated that TPRBK changes its subcellular 
localization during the cell cycle: at interphase TPRBK locates on the 
centrosomes, during mitosis it translocates from spindle poles to mitotic 
spindles then to spindle midzone, and through a period of cytokinesis it stays 
on the midbody. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunofluorescent staining with 
adequate antibodies revealed that TPRBK binds to Aurora B, and those proteins 
together translocate throughout mitosis and cytokinesis. Treatments of cells 
with two drugs (Blebbistatin and Y-27632), that are known to inhibit the 
contractility of actin-myosin, disturbed the proper intracellular localization 
of TPRBK. Moreover, the knockdown of TPRBK expression by small interfering RNA 
(siRNA) suppressed the bundling of spindle midzone microtubules and disrupted 
the midbody formation, arresting the cells at G(2)+M phase. These observations 
indicated that a novel big protein TPRBK is essential for the formation and 
integrity of the midbody, hence we postulated that TPRBK plays a critical role 
in the progress of mitosis and cytokinesis during mammalian cell cycle.
