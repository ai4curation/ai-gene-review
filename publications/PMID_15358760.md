ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a pivotal regulator of 
cholesterol efflux from cells to apolipoproteins, whereas sterol-responsive 
element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) is the key protein regulating cholesterol 
synthesis and uptake. We investigated the regulation of ABCA1 by SREBP2 in 
vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Our results showed that sterol depletion 
activated SREBP2 and increased its target, low density lipoprotein receptor 
mRNA, with a concurrent decrease in the ABCA1 mRNA. Transient transfection 
analysis revealed that sterol depletion decreased the ABCA1 promoter activity by 
50%, but low density lipoprotein receptor promoter- and the sterol-responsive 
element-driven luciferase activities were increased. Overexpression of the N 
terminus of SREBP2 (SREBP2(N)), an active form of SREBP2, also inhibited the 
ABCA1 promoter activity. Functionally adenovirus-mediated SREBP2(N) expression 
increased cholesterol accumulation and decreased apoA-I-mediated cholesterol 
efflux. The conserved E-box motif was responsible for the SREBP2(N)-mediated 
inhibition since mutation of the E-box increased the basal activity of the ABCA1 
promoter and abolished the inhibitory effect of SREBP2(N). Furthermore sterol 
depletion and SREBP2(N) overexpression induced the binding of SREBP2(N) to both 
consensus and ABCA1-specific E-box. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay 
demonstrated that serum starvation enhanced the association of SREBP2 and the 
ABCA1 promoter in ECs. To correlate this mechanism pathophysiologically, we 
found that oscillatory flow caused the activation of SREBP2 and therefore 
attenuated ABCA1 promoter activity in ECs. Thus, this SREBP-regulated mechanism 
may control the efflux of cholesterol, which is a newly defined function of 
SREBP2 in ECs in addition to its role in cholesterol uptake and biosynthesis.
