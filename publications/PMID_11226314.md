Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 5 is a unique member of the Cdk family, because 
Cdk5 kinase activity is detected only in the nervous tissue. Two neuron-specific 
activating subunits of Cdk5, p35 and p39, have been identified. Overlapping 
expression pattern of these isoforms in the embryonic mouse brain and the 
significant residual Cdk5 kinase activity in brain homogenate of the p35-/- mice 
indicate the redundant functions of the Cdk5 activators in vivo. Severe neuronal 
migration defects in p35-/-Cdk5 +/- mice further support the idea that the 
redundant expression of the Cdk5 activators may cause a milder phenotype in 
p35-/- mice compared with Cdk5-/- mice. Mutant mice lacking either Cdk5 or p35 
exhibit certain similarities with Reelin/Dab1-mutant mice in the disorganization 
of cortical laminar structure in the brain. To elucidate the relationship 
between Cdk5/p35 and Reelin/Dab1 signaling, we generated mouse lines that have 
combined defects of these genes. The addition of heterozygosity of either Dab1 
or Reelin mutation to p35-/- causes the extensive migration defects of cortical 
neurons in the cerebellum. In the double-null mice of p35 and either Dab1 or 
Reelin, additional migration defects occur in the Purkinje cells in the 
cerebellum and in the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. These additional 
defects in neuronal migration in mice lacking both Cdk5/p35 and Reelin/Dab1 
indicate that Cdk5/p35 may contribute synergistically to the positioning of the 
cortical neurons in the developing mouse brain.
