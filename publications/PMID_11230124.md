During apoptosis, release of cytochrome c initiates dATP-dependent 
oligomerization of Apaf-1 and formation of the apoptosome. In a cell-free 
system, we have addressed the order in which apical and effector caspases, 
caspases-9 and -3, respectively, are recruited to, activated and retained within 
the apoptosome. We propose a multi-step process, whereby catalytically active 
processed or unprocessed caspase-9 initially binds the Apaf-1 apoptosome in 
cytochrome c/dATP-activated lysates and consequently recruits caspase-3 via an 
interaction between the active site cysteine (C287) in caspase-9 and a critical 
aspartate (D175) in caspase-3. We demonstrate that XIAP, an 
inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein, is normally present in high molecular weight 
complexes in unactivated cell lysates, but directly interacts with the 
apoptosome in cytochrome c/dATP-activated lysates. XIAP associates with 
oligomerized Apaf-1 and/or processed caspase-9 and influences the activation of 
caspase-3, but also binds activated caspase-3 produced within the apoptosome and 
sequesters it within the complex. Thus, XIAP may regulate cell death by 
inhibiting the activation of caspase-3 within the apoptosome and by preventing 
release of active caspase-3 from the complex.
