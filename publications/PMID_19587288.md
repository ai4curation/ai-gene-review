It has been recently shown that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenic peptide 
amyloid beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) binds to the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptor (alpha7nAChR) with high affinity and the alpha7nAChR and Abeta(1-42) 
are both found colocalized in neuritic plaques of human brains with AD. 
Moreover, the intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta(1-42) was shown to be 
facilitated by its high-affinity binding to the alpha7nAChR, and alpha7nAChR 
activation mediates Abeta-induced tau protein phosphorylation. To test the 
hypothesis that alpha7nAChRs are involved in AD pathogenesis, we used a 
transgenic mouse model of AD overexpressing a mutated form of the human amyloid 
precursor protein (APP) and lacking the alpha7nAChR gene (APPalpha7KO). We have 
shown that, despite the presence of high amounts of APP and amyloid deposits, 
deleting the alpha7nAChR subunit in the mouse model of AD leads to a protection 
from the dysfunction in synaptic integrity (pathology and plasticity) and 
learning and memory behavior. Specifically, APPalpha7KO mice express APP and 
Abeta at levels similar to APP mice, and yet they were able to solve a cognitive 
challenge such as the Morris water maze test significantly better than APP, with 
performances comparable to control groups. Moreover, deleting the alpha7nAChR 
subunit protected the brain from loss of the synaptic markers synaptophysin and 
MAP2, reduced the gliosis, and preserved the capacity to elicit long-term 
potentiation otherwise deficient in APP mice. These results are consistent with 
the hypothesis that the alpha7nAChR plays a role in AD and suggest that 
interrupting alpha7nAChR function could be beneficial in the treatment of AD.
