To screen candidate molecules that might be useful as diagnostic biomarkers or 
for development of novel molecular-targeting therapies, we previously carried 
out gene-expression profile analysis of 101 lung carcinomas and detected an 
elevated expression of FGFR1OP (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 oncogene 
partner) in the majority of lung cancers. Immunohistochemical staining using 
tumor tissue microarrays consisting of 372 archived non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) specimens revealed positive staining of FGFR1OP in 334 (89.8%) of 372 
NSCLCs. We also found that the high level of FGFR1OP expression was 
significantly associated with shorter tumor-specific survival times (P < 0.0001 
by log-rank test). Moreover, multivariate analysis determined that FGFR1OP was 
an independent prognostic factor for surgically treated NSCLC patients (P < 
0.0001). Treatment of lung cancer cells, in which endogenous FGFR1OP was 
overexpressed, using FGFR1OP siRNA, suppressed its expression and resulted in 
inhibition of the cell growth. Furthermore, induction of FGFR1OP increased the 
cellular motility and growth-promoting activity of mammalian cells. To 
investigate its function, we searched for FGFR1OP-interacting proteins in lung 
cancer cells and identified ABL1 (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 
1) and WRNIP1 (Werner helicase interacting protein 1), which was known to be 
involved in cell cycle progression. FGFR1OP significantly reduced ABL1-dependent 
phosphorylation of WRNIP1 and resulted in the promotion of cell cycle 
progression. Because our data imply that FGFR1OP is likely to play a significant 
role in lung cancer growth and progression, FGFR1OP should be useful as a 
prognostic biomarker and probably as a therapeutic target for lung cancer.
