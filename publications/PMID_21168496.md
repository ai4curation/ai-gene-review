The generation and maturation of adult neural stem/progenitor cells are impaired 
in many neurodegenerative diseases, among them is Parkinson's disease (PD). In 
mammals, including humans, adult neurogenesis is a lifelong feature of cellular 
brain plasticity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and in the subventricular 
zone (SVZ)/olfactory bulb system. Hyposmia, depression, and anxiety are early 
non-motor symptoms in PD. There are parallels between brain regions associated 
with non-motor symptoms in PD and neurogenic regions. In autosomal dominant PD, 
mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are frequent. LRRK2 
homologs in non-vertebrate systems play an important role in chemotaxis, cell 
polarity, and neurite arborization. We investigated adult neurogenesis and the 
neurite development of new neurons in the DG and SVZ/olfactory bulb system in 
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) human Lrrk2 G2019S transgenic mice. We 
report that mutant human Lrrk2 is highly expressed in the hippocampus in the DG 
and the SVZ of adult Lrrk2 G2019S mice. Proliferation of newly generated cells 
is significantly decreased and survival of newly generated neurons in the DG and 
olfactory bulb is also severely impaired. In addition, after stereotactic 
injection of a GFP retrovirus, newly generated neurons in the DG of Lrrk2 G2019S 
mice exhibited reduced dendritic arborization and fewer spines. This loss in 
mature, developed spines might point towards a decrease in synaptic 
connectivity. Interestingly, physical activity partially reverses the decrease 
in neuroblasts observed in Lrrk2 G2010S mice. These data further support a role 
for Lrrk2 in neuronal morphogenesis and provide new insights into the role of 
Lrrk2 in adult neurogenesis.
