The RIG-G gene, originally isolated from an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell 
line NB4, codes for a 60-kDa cytoplasmic protein that is induced by all-trans 
retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment along with the induction of morphological 
differentiation of NB4 cells. Here, we provide evidence that ectopic expression 
of Rig-G in U937 cells can lead to a significant accumulation of cells at G(1)/S 
transition. Growth arrest seems to occur by modulating several major cell cycle 
regulatory players. Interestingly, Rig-G alters JAB1 cellular distribution 
through interacting with this protein and increases the intracellular level of 
p27 by preventing it from the JAB-1-dependent and ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated 
degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a role of Rig-G for c-myc 
down-regulation that results in an up-regulation of p21, tightly associated with 
cell cycle arrest. In addition, our studies reveal that Rig-G is a direct target 
of STAT1, a key transcription factor in regulating IFN responses, and may be one 
of the first experimentally proven molecular mediators for the antiproliferative 
effect of IFN-alpha. Considering that IFN-alpha and ATRA synergistically inhibit 
growth along the intracellular pathways triggered by the two compounds in many 
cell types, we suggest that Rig-G may also represent one of the key molecular 
nodes of signaling cross-talk between ATRA and IFN-alpha.

Abstract

The RIG-G gene, originally isolated from an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4, codes for a 60-kDa cytoplasmic protein that is induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment along with the induction of morphological differentiation of NB4 cells. Here, we provide evidence that ectopic expression of Rig-G in U937 cells can lead to a significant accumulation of cells at G 1 /S transition. Growth arrest seems to occur by modulating several major cell cycle regulatory players. Interestingly, Rig-G alters JAB1 cellular distribution through interacting with this protein and increases the intracellular level of p27 by preventing it from the JAB-1-dependent and ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a role of Rig-G for c-myc down-regulation that results in an up-regulation of p21, tightly associated with cell cycle arrest. In addition, our studies reveal that Rig-G is a direct target of STAT1, a key transcription factor in regulating IFN responses, and may be one of the first experimentally proven molecular mediators for the antiproliferative effect of IFN-α. Considering that IFN-α and ATRA synergistically inhibit growth along the intracellular pathways triggered by the two compounds in many cell types, we suggest that Rig-G may also represent one of the key molecular nodes of signaling cross-talk between ATRA and IFN-α.

Discussion

In this work, we show that RIG-G , a gene whose expression is triggered by both IFN-α and ATRA, plays an important role in leukemia cell growth inhibition. Indeed, a survey of the literature indicates that the induction of Rig-G by ATRA or IFN-α occurs not merely in acute promyelocytic leukemia but also in many types of solid tumors, including head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, non-small-cell lung cancer H460 and A549 cells, cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, and epithelium-like WISH cells ( 5 , 20 ), suggesting that the significance of Rig-G-induced cell growth inhibition is well beyond the acute promyelocytic leukemia model.

On the basis of bioinformatics analysis, RIG-G belongs to the IFI gene family and is also called IFI60 ( 5 ). It is worth pointing out that the expression of other members in this family, such as IFI54, IFI56, and IFI58, can also be induced with comparable kinetics by IFN-α or ATRA in NB4 cells (data not shown). Of note, these genes are tightly clustered at 10q23–24 and share similar cis elements in the promoters, indicating that the human IFI gene family members, including RIG-G , most likely evolve from one common gene ancestor because of gene duplication, and their expression may comply with the same transcriptional mechanisms.

It has been reported that the STAT1 gene contains a retinoic acid response element in its promoter, suggesting that the STAT1 may be a direct target of ATRA ( 21 ). However, this is doubtful in NB4 cells because of the slower kinetics of STAT1 up-regulation by ATRA as shown in Fig. 1 E . According to our data and literature, several conceivable situations in NB4 cells are proposed. First, ATRA-induced STAT1 induction depends on the rapid up-regulation of IRF1 ( 22 , 23 ), a primary target of ATRA. This idea is supported by the presence of ISRE and GAS elements in the promoter of STAT1 gene, which is molecularly essential for STAT1 response to IRF1 ( 24 ). Second, the fact that ATRA can induce IFN-α synthesis and secretion in NB4 cells ( 22 , 25 ) together with the observed time course of STAT1 and Rig-G expression collectively support the idea that ATRA-induced STAT1 indeed may be mediated by IFN-α. Nonetheless, we observed that in NB4 cells, ATRA was unable to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (data not shown), which is a crucial step in the IFN-α-mediated classical JAK-STAT pathway (1). Therefore, it was postulated that ATRA and IFN-α induce Rig-G expression through distinct mechanisms (IRF1 and STAT1 activation, sequentially).

In this study, we find that the antiproliferative effect of Rig-G is correlated with increased p21 and p27, two negative regulators of the cell cycle progression from G 1 into S phase. The induction of p21 by Rig-G has been shown to be at the transcriptional level. It is most likely that the c-Myc-dependent mechanisms act with regard to the p21 up-regulation ( 13 , 14 , 17 ). By contrast, we provide evidence that the Rig-G-induced up-regulation of p27 occurs at posttranslational level by disturbing the JAB1 function. JAB1 was first identified as a Jun activating binding protein ( 8 ), which can stabilize the binding of c-Jun or Jun D-containing AP-1 complex to their consensus DNA sites and increase the transcription of AP-1-dependent target genes. Besides, it has been also reported that JAB1 can physically interact with p27 in the nucleus and stimulate its nuclear export and subsequent proteolysis via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway ( 9 , 10 ). In our case, the interaction between Rig-G and JAB1 in the cytosol could partially prevent JAB1 from entering the nucleus and allow the nuclear accumulation of p27 and rescue of p27 from the degradation machinery. Similarly, the formation of Rig-G/JAB1 complex in the cytosol can also account for this inhibitory effect of Rig-G on JAB1-enhanced AP-1 transactivities, leading to cell proliferation inhibition. Taken together, our data suggest that Rig-G may work as a negative regulator of JAB1 function. Over the last several years, JAB1 also has been known as COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (CSN5), which is a component of the COP9 signalosome regulatory complex ( 26 – 28 ). Some reports show that JAB1/CSN5 subunit possesses a metalloprotease catalytic activity that is required for the COP9 holocomplex-directed deneddylation of the Cullins, a subunit of SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein) ubiquitin E3 ligases ( 29 , 30 ). Although JAB1/CSN5 can exist in a monomeric form and act independently of COP9 holocomplex ( 7 , 28 ), it should be interesting to explore in the future whether Rig-G has effects on the function of COP9 holocomplex through interaction with JAB1/CSN5.

The hallmark of tumors consist of a rapid, uncontrolled cell proliferation, accompanied by differentiation block and accumulation of genetic alterations. Induction of G 1 /S arrest and cell cycle exit can sensitize cells to differentiation and keep the cells from becoming tumorous. In our study, the potential of Rig-G to promote cell differentiation was also found, indicating that up-regulation of p21 and p27 might also have an effect on leukemia cell maturation. This is reminiscent of the observation that ectopic overexpression of p21 and/or p27 in U937 cells can induce the expression of the monocyte/macrophage-specific differentiation markers in the absence of hormone ( 31 ). It has been suggested that several cell cycle regulatory proteins may have dual functions (growth inhibition and/or differentiation), such as pRb family proteins, p21 and p27. The molecular mechanisms whereby the interplay between differentiation and cell cycle operates remain to be determined.
