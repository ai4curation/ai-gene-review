Ste20-related protein kinases have been implicated as regulating a range of 
cellular responses, including stress-activated protein kinase pathways and the 
control of cytoskeletal architecture. An important issue involves the identities 
of the upstream signals and regulators that might control the biological 
functions of mammalian Ste20-related protein kinases. HPK1 is a 
protein-serine/threonine kinase that possesses a Ste20-like kinase domain, and 
in transfected cells activates a protein kinase pathway leading to the 
stress-activated protein kinase SAPK/JNK. Here we have investigated candidate 
upstream regulators that might interact with HPK1. HPK1 possesses an N-terminal 
catalytic domain and an extended C-terminal tail with four proline-rich motifs. 
The SH3 domains of Grb2 bound in vitro to specific proline-rich motifs in the 
HPK1 tail and functioned synergistically to direct the stable binding of Grb2 to 
HPK1 in transfected Cos1 cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation did 
not affect the binding of Grb2 to HPK1 but induced recruitment of the Grb2.HPK1 
complex to the autophosphorylated EGF receptor and to the Shc docking protein. 
Several activated receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, including the EGF 
receptor, stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the HPK1 serine/threonine 
kinase. These results suggest that HPK1, a mammalian Ste20-related 
protein-serine/threonine kinase, can potentially associate with protein-tyrosine 
kinases through interactions mediated by SH2/SH3 adaptors such as Grb2. Such 
interaction may provide a possible mechanism for cross-talk between distinct 
biochemical pathways following the activation of tyrosine kinases.
