Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an imprinted neurodevelopmental disease caused by 
a loss of paternal genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. It is characterized by 
cognitive impairments, developmental delay, sleep abnormalities, and hyperphagia 
often leading to obesity. Clinical research has shown that a lack of expression 
of SNORD116, a paternally expressed imprinted gene cluster that encodes multiple 
copies of a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) in both humans and mice, is most likely 
responsible for many PWS symptoms seen in humans. The majority of previous 
research using PWS preclinical models focused on characterization of the 
hyperphagic and metabolic phenotypes. However, a crucial understudied clinical 
phenotype is cognitive impairments and thus we investigated the learning and 
memory abilities using a model of PWS, with a heterozygous deletion in Snord116. 
We utilized the novel object recognition task, which doesn't require external 
motivation, or exhaustive swim training. Automated findings were further 
confirmed with manual scoring by a highly trained blinded investigator. We 
discovered deficits in Snord116+/- mutant mice in the novel object recognition, 
location memory and tone cue fear conditioning assays when compared to age-, 
sex- matched, littermate control Snord116+/+ mice. Further, we confirmed that 
despite physical neo-natal developmental delays, Snord116+/- mice had normal 
exploratory and motor abilities. These results show that the Snord116+/- 
deletion murine model is a valuable preclinical model for investigating learning 
and memory impairments in individuals with PWS without common confounding 
phenotypes.

Abstract

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an imprinted neurodevelopmental disease caused by a loss of paternal genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. It is characterized by cognitive impairments, developmental delay, sleep abnormalities, and hyperphagia often leading to obesity. Clinical research has shown that a lack of expression of SNORD116, a paternally expressed imprinted gene cluster that encodes multiple copies of a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) in both humans and mice, is most likely responsible for many PWS symptoms seen in humans. The majority of previous research using PWS preclinical models focused on characterization of the hyperphagic and metabolic phenotypes. However, a crucial understudied clinical phenotype is cognitive impairments and thus we investigated the learning and memory abilities using a model of PWS, with a heterozygous deletion in Snord116 . We utilized the novel object recognition task, which doesn’t require external motivation, or exhaustive swim training. Automated findings were further confirmed with manual scoring by a highly trained blinded investigator. We discovered deficits in Snord116 + /– mutant mice in the novel object recognition, location memory and tone cue fear conditioning assays when compared to age-, sex- matched, littermate control Snord116 +/+ mice. Further, we confirmed that despite physical neo-natal developmental delays, Snord116 +/− mice had normal exploratory and motor abilities. These results show that the Snord116 + /– deletion murine model is a valuable preclinical model for investigating learning and memory impairments in individuals with PWS without common confounding phenotypes.

1. Introduction

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that occurs in approximately 1:15,000 live births. PWS is characterized by neonatal failure to thrive, developmental delay, lack of satiety cues, lack of control of food intake and metabolic abnormalities that lead to obesity. In addition to obesity, PWS affected individuals usually exhibit low to moderate intellectual disability and issues with numerous tasks related to executive function (e.g., response inhibition, set-shifting and planning) ( Dykens, Hodapp, Walsh, & Nash, 1992a , 1992b ; Dykens, Leckman, & Cassidy, 1996 ; Dykens et al., 2017 ; Dykens and Shah, 2003 ; Martin et al., 1998 ; Schwartz et al., 2016 ).

Due to the imprinted status of the 15q11-q13 locus, allele-specific mutations lead to the development of two distinct neurodevelopmental disorders. PWS results from genetic mutations leading to deficient gene expression from the paternal allele of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13), while Angelman Syndrome (AS) results from mutations inherited from the maternal allele of the same locus, emphasizing a critical neurological function of these genes ( Jiang, Tsai, Bressler, & Beaudet, 1998 ). Numerous mutant mouse models were generated by targeting different portions of the orthologous mouse region. The first model deleted the entire PWS/AS locus, similar to the vast majority of PWS and/or AS patients ( Gabriel et al., 1999 ; Stefan, Portis, Longnecker, & Nicholls, 2005 ). Follow-up model systems highlighted the PWS imprinting center and informed the essential nature of the epigenetic processes ( Yang et al., 1998 ). Several smaller deletion and single gene mutant model systems have been created to delineate the contribution of each gene in the region to aspects of the PWS phenotype. These include models deleting exons in the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N ( Snrpn ), an RNA-protein complex that forms an RNA spliceosome ( Bressler et al., 2001 ; Dubose, Smith, Yang, Johnstone, & Resnick, 2011 ; Tsai, Jiang, et al., 1999 ), necdin ( Ndn ), which can influence multiple pathways involved in neuronal survival, differentiation and outgrowth and Magel2, a Ndn homolog that is expressed in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex and spinal cord and key in circadian timekeeping ( Kozlov et al., 2007 ; Lee et al., 2000 ).

While many genes are likely involved in the entire complicated PWS phenotype (including developmental failure to thrive, metabolic anomalies, obesity, cognitive deficits, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and other psychiatric co-morbidities), analyses of rare PWS patients have determined that a ~ 200 kb deletion of a cluster of small nucleolar/noncoding RNAs (snoRNAs) within this locus is sufficient to cause PWS ( Bieth et al., 2015 ; de Smith et al., 2009 ; Duker et al., 2010 ; Sahoo et al., 2008 ). Thus, investigation into the loss of this particular group of snoRNA genes, known as the Snord116 cluster, as contributing factors is an essential step toward elucidating the neurobiology of the PWS phenotype.

Ding et al. (2008) derived a novel mouse model for PWS by deleting the paternal copies of Snord116. Mice with paternally inherited Snord116 +/− deletions had growth delays in the first three postnatal weeks, hyperphagia, prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin but normal pain sensitivity, motor abilities and working memory measured by the spontaneous alternation task ( Ding et al., 2008 ). Lassi, Maggi, et al. (2016) observed significant changes in working-for-food behavioral responses at various timescales in a home cage behavioral system in Snord116 +/− mice ( Lassi, Maggi, et al., 2016 ). It is unknown how or if the missing Snord116 cluster contributes to other components of the intellectual disability behavioral diagnosis in clinical populations since the overwhelming majority of previous research using PWS preclinical models focused on characterization of the hyperphagic and metabolic phenotypes. The following report carefully investigated learning and memory abilities in the heterozygous deletion Snord116 +/− model of PWS. We discovered that Snord116 +/− mice exhibited learning and memory impairments compared to their wildtype littermates on the low stress-standard assays of novel object recognition (NOR) and object location memory (OLM). Second, we illustrated data that were quantified with reasonable signal to noise ratio by automated tracking software, and confirmed and fine-tuned by human manual scoring. We also discovered that the Snord116 +/− group showed deficits in cued but not contextual fear conditioning. Finally, we confirmed our results were not confounded by physical or motor dysfunction.

4. Discussion

Basic research to discover highly specific intervention targets requires well-controlled in vivo studies in model organisms with high construct validity. PWS arises by paternal 15q11–13 deletions, maternal uniparental disomy, or imprinting errors which lead to aberrant methylation and downregulation of paternally expressed transcripts. Genetic mapping data from unique “microdeletion” patients suggest SNORD116, is a critical mediator of the neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Therefore, we evaluated a mouse model of paternally inherited Snord116 deletion on physical characteristics and functional outcome measures. For the first time, we reliably identified the clinically relevant phenotype of cognitive deficits due to the loss of Snord116 using several standard behavioral metrics of learning and memory. Further, we corroborated earlier reports of postnatal failure to thrive. Our data highlight a functional cognitive contribution of this critical snoRNA complex and suggest a broader role for Snord116/SNORD116, beyond known cellular processes.

We discovered that Snord116 +/− mice exhibited robust learning and memory impairments in the low stress standard assay of NOR using optimized methods of our laboratory and the MIND Institute’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC) Rodent Behavioral Core, recently highlighted as a collaborative effort by numerous prominent neuroscientists ( Gulinello et al., 2018 ). The outcome parameter of time spent in zone of close proximity using Noldus 9.0XT automated tracking software was corroborated by an expert technician blinded to genotype that scored time spent sniffing the objects manually. Both methods produced quantifiable data with reasonable signal to noise ratio. However, we discovered that only manual observation was able to eliminate misdetections in the automated tracking such as subjects knocking over objects, subjects sitting on objects, subjects grooming next to objects, and/or when the nose and tail detection indicator points switch amongst one another.

Our study also discovered deficits of the Snord116+/− mutants in learning and memory by OLM on which rodents are presented with two identical, familiar objects, one of which is in its previous location while the other is in a new location. Rodents spend more time exploring the object in the novel location ( Ennaceur & Meliani, 1992 ). The NOR and OLM impairments were detected in the typical short-term range by a 1-hr time interval between familiarization and testing. This window is thought to occur within the consolidation phase of memory formation and may not be dependent on protein synthesis. Snord116+/− mutants showed impairments in cued but not contextual fear conditioning. The cued conditioning deficits but intact responses in context learning and memory were detected 48-hr post-training and therefore were transcriptionally and translationally dependent learning and memory as previously shown by this Pavlovian paradigm ( Schafe and LeDoux, 2000 ; Schafe et al., 2000 ), and as further suggested by studies performed using a latent inhibition cued conditioning protocol ( Lewis & Gould, 2007 ). Our detection of impairments in the short and longer term intervals implicate the multiple biochemical mechanisms that underlie learning and memory.

These cognitive behavioral deficiencies are intriguing and lend suggestions toward the role of the well-studied underlying neural circuitry. OLM and NOR both heavily rely on the spontaneous exploratory behavior of rodents towards objects ( Bevins and Besheer, 2006 ; Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988 ; Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014 ). Broadly, neuroanatomical substrates implicated in these functional outcomes include the hippocampus and its supporting limbic regions, such as the medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices. In fact, an array of lesions in limbic sites connected with the hippocampus did not disrupt performance on a 15-min retention test of NOR while similar studies in OLM revealed impairments from lesions of the fornix and the cingulate cortex but not the medial prefrontal cortex ( Ennaceur, Neave, & Aggleton, 1997 ). The amygdala is important for associating objects or spatial relationships with positive or aversive outcomes and appears to mediate fear responses to novel stimuli or neophobia ( Ennaceur, Michalikova, & Chazot, 2009 ). For example, rodents with amygdala lesions show attenuated neophobia for novel food ( Burns, Annett, Kelley, Everitt, & Robbins, 1996 ). Moreover, a rich literature of lesion work indicated that specific but different brain regions appear to regulate cued versus contextual fear conditioning. Although the responses of behavioral freezing elicited by contextual and cued fear conditioning are identical, the processing demands underlying the two forms of fear conditioning are different. The preponderance of the evidence supports the hypothesis that primary sensory information from the auditory thalamus into the lateral amygdala mediate cued fear conditioning ( Phillips and LeDoux, 1992 ; Schafe and LeDoux, 2000 ) while contextual fear conditioning require both the amygdala and the hippocampus ( Phillips and LeDoux, 1995 ; Maren and Holt, 2000 ). Given our reported impairments in Snord116+/− mice using novelty-based tasks and cued fear conditioning, we hypothesize a broad range of neural substrates underlying the dysfunction. A study by Lassi, Priano et al. (2016) also supports our suggestion of subcortical and limbic anomalies with evidence of morphological changes measured by structal MRI. Moreover, they discovered a major reduction in the size of the hippocampus in Snord116 +/− mice and PWS patients ( Lassi, Priano, et al., 2016 ).

We corroborated the previously reported physical neo-natal developmental delays in weight and growth in Snord116 +/− ( Ding et al., 2008 ; Powell et al., 2013 ). We extended these phenotypic outcomes by also quantifying smaller body lengths and smaller head circumferences. Development of walking measured by the animals’ skills to traverse outward of a circle disk was delayed in the Snord116 +/− mice. Interestingly, other standard neonatal neurological reflexes such as negative geotaxis, righting reflex and cliff aversion remained intact. We confirmed that the cognitive deficits observed in Snord116 +/− mice were not the result of confounding motor hypo activity, despite the substantial growth delays in the first 2 weeks of postnatal life. In extension of earlier work, we also examined anxiety-related phenotypes. Earlier characterization studies had reported an increased anxiety-like phenotype measured by increased ratio of time spent in the closed arm by the Snord116 +/− mice ( Ding et al., 2008 ). We corroborated this finding by the standard measure of anxiety-like behavior on the plus- maze of percent time spent on the open arm. While a mild anxiety-like phenotype was observed on the elevated plus-maze, it was not supported by data from the light-dark conflict task nor the center time in the open field, which suggested to us a very mild anxiety-like phenotype which probably did not confound learning and memory results.

Earlier research using the same Snord116 +/− mutation mice reported disrupted circadian rhythms, sleep-wake cycles, frontal cortical transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, as well as reduced forebrain neuronal and cerebellar cellular sizes, which could mechanistically contribute to the behavioral phenotypes reported ( Burnett et al., 2017 ; Coulson et al., 2018 ; Lassi, Priano, et al., 2016 ). Other in vivo model systems of PWS deleted the entire critical imprinting center and reported low locomotor abilities and impairments in the frontal cortical dependent five choice serial reaction time task ( Relkovic et al., 2010 ). Given the number of genes in the critical imprinting region, other models were generated that focused on mutations of single paternally expressed genes. Necdin (Ndn) null mutants were the first to be generated and characterized since Necdin protein is postulated to govern the permanent arrest of cell growth of post-mitotic neurons during development. Ndn mutant mouse models were generated from multiple laboratories and displayed highly variable functional phenotypes, that ranged from no abnormality to respiratory distress and lethality, depending on the background strain of mouse ( Gerard, Hernandez, Wevrick, & Stewart, 1999 ; Kuwako et al., 2005 ; Muscatelli et al., 2000 ; Tsai, Armstrong, et al., 1999 ). The other gene in the region that is highly homologous to Ndn, paternally expressed and has multiple key cell cycle regulatory functions is Magel2 . Magel2 mutant mice have disrupted circadian rhythm and reduced brain volumes however relatively normal motor and learning abilities ( Fountain, Tao, Chen, Yin, & Schaaf, 2017 ; Kozlov et al., 2007 ; Mercer et al., 2009 ) in contrast to the learning and memory deficits reported herein.

5. Conclusion

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disease caused by a loss of imprinted paternal genes on chromosome 15q11-q13 and is characterized by cognitive impairments, developmental delay, hyperphagia, and obesity. The majority of previous research using PWS preclinical models focused on characterization of the hyperphagic and metabolic phenotypes. This work reports the clinically relevant phenotype of cognitive impairments on three different learning and memory behavioral assays in the Snord116+/− model of PWS. These deficits in the Snord116 +/− mouse model highlight the critical role of Snord116 +/− in PWS and extend validity of the model as a valuable preclinical tool for investigating learning and memory impairments in PWS.
