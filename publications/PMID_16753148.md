Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can result in cell cycle arrest. The reactivation 
of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is necessary for cell cycle reentry. But the 
mechanism of how Plk1 regulates p53 in UV-induced mitotic arrest cells remained 
elusive. Here we find that UV treatment leads HEK293 cells to inverse changes of 
Plk1 and p53. Over-expression of Plk1 rescue UV-induced mitotic arrest cells by 
inhibiting p53 activation. Plk1 could also inhibit p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, 
thus facilitates its nuclear export and degradation. Further examination shows 
that Plk1, p53 and Cdc25C can form a large complex. Plk1 could bind to the 
sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of p53 and active Cdc25C by 
hyperphosphorylation. These results hypothesize that Plk1 and Cdc25C participate 
in recovery the mitotic arrest through binding to the different domain of p53. 
Cdc25C may first be actived by Plk1, and then its phosphatase activity makes p53 
dephosphorylated at Ser15.
