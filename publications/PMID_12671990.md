Most cases of early-onset torsion dystonia are caused by deletion of GAG in the 
coding region of the DYT1 gene encoding torsinA. This autosomal dominant 
neurologic disorder is characterized by abnormal movements, believed to 
originate from neuronal dysfunction in the basal ganglia of the human brain. The 
torsins (torsinA and torsinB) are members of the "ATPases associated with a 
variety of cellular activities" (AAA(+)) superfamily of proteins that mediate 
chaperone and other functions involved in conformational modeling of proteins, 
protection from stress, and targeting of proteins to cellular organelles. In 
this study, the intracellular localization and levels of endogenous torsin were 
evaluated in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells following differentiation and 
stress. TorsinA, apparent MW 37 kDa, cofractionates with markers for the 
microsomal/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment and appears to reside 
primarily within the ER lumen based on protease resistance. TorsinA 
immunoreactivity colocalizes with the lumenal ER protein protein disulfide 
isomerase (PDI) and extends throughout neurites. Levels of torsinA did not 
increase notably in response to nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. 
None of the stress conditions tested, including heat shock and the unfolded 
protein response, affected torsinA, except for oxidative stress, which resulted 
in an increase in the apparent MW of torsinA and redistribution to protrusions 
from the cell surface. These findings are consistent with a relatively rapid 
covalent modification of torsinA in response to oxidative stress causing a 
change in state. Mutant torsinA may interfere with and/or compromise ER 
functions, especially in dopaminergic neurons, which have high levels of torsinA 
and are intrinsically vulnerable to oxidative stress.
