Lambda ZAP cDNA library constructed from spleen of a p53-deficient mouse was 
screened by South-Western technique using Fragment A, a DNA sequence that p53 
specifically binds to, as a probe. One (clone 2) of six clones isolated was 
identical to MEF2c, a MADS-family transcription factor. Transcripts of the mef2c 
gene was also detected in spleen where the expression has not been reported so 
far. Isolated clones except clone 2 had a growth-suppression activity on 
p53-deficient osteosarcoma cell line (Saos II). Clone 2 repressed the 
transactivation from Fragment A by p53, suggesting that MEF2c may act as a 
negative regulator of p53-responsive element.
