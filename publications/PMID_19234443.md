The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system is essential 
for multivesicular body biogenesis, in which cargo sorting is coupled to the 
invagination and scission of intralumenal vesicles. The ESCRTs are also needed 
for budding of enveloped viruses including human immunodeficiency virus 1, and 
for membrane abscission in cytokinesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ESCRT-III 
consists of Vps20, Snf7, Vps24 and Vps2 (also known as Did4), which assemble in 
that order and require the ATPase Vps4 for their disassembly. In this study, the 
ESCRT-III-dependent budding and scission of intralumenal vesicles into giant 
unilamellar vesicles was reconstituted and visualized by fluorescence 
microscopy. Here we show that three subunits of ESCRT-III, Vps20, Snf7 and 
Vps24, are sufficient to detach intralumenal vesicles. Vps2, the ESCRT-III 
subunit responsible for recruiting Vps4, and the ATPase activity of Vps4 were 
required for ESCRT-III recycling and supported additional rounds of budding. The 
minimum set of ESCRT-III and Vps4 proteins capable of multiple cycles of vesicle 
detachment corresponds to the ancient set of ESCRT proteins conserved from 
archaea to animals.

Abstract

The ESCRT system is essential for multivesicular body biogenesis, in which cargo sorting is coupled to the invagination and scission of intralumenal vesicles. The ESCRTs are also needed for budding of enveloped viruses including HIV-1, and for membrane abscission in cytokinesis. In yeast, ESCRT-III consists of Vps20, Snf7, Vps24, and Vps2, which assemble in that order, and require the ATPase Vps4 for their disassembly. The ESCRT-III-dependent budding and scission of intralumenal vesicles into giant unilamellar vesicles was reconstituted and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Three subunits of ESCRT-III, Vps20, Snf7, and Vps24, were sufficient to detach intralumenal vesicles. Vps2, the ESCRT-III subunit responsible for recruiting Vps4, and the ATPase activity of Vps4 were required for ESCRT-III recycling and supported additional rounds of budding. The minimum set of ESCRT-III and Vps4 proteins capable of multiple cycles of vesicle detachment corresponds to the ancient set of ESCRT proteins conserved from archaea to animals.

Discussion

We have reconstituted ESCRT-dependent membrane scission using a minimal set of protein components and a simple model for the eukaryotic endosomal membrane. The proteins included correspond to the minimal set conserved between eukaryotes and archaea, ESCRT-III and Vps4 13 , 14 . The model system recapitulates the ordered recruitment of ESCRT-III and Vps4 established in yeast. Snf7 has the highest stoichiometry in vivo relative to other subunits 35 , and it is the most important subunit in cargo sequestration 35 . The in vitro studies show that Snf7 is the most potent of the subunits in membrane scission. The behavior of the system is consistent with known biological and biochemical data.

The first major insight is that ESCRT-III proteins alone have the intrinsic ability to drive the detachment of ILVs. ESCRT-III is capable of cleaving membrane necks with the appropriate inward topology in this minimal system. It is remarkable that the system does not require any of the upstream ESCRT complexes −0, -I, or -II, cargo, unusual lipids such as lysobisphosphatidic acid 27 , or manipulation of membrane tension. Most of these factors are still likely to modulate the reaction, even if they are not essential. For example, the ILVs seen in this study are more heterogeneous and far larger than those seen physiologically 36 . We previously suggested that ESCRT-I and perhaps other upstream ESCRTs might regulate ILV size 37 . In a cellular setting the bud neck is scaffolded by upstream ESCRTs and cargo (MVB pathway), viral Gag assembly (HIV-1 budding), or the extension of the central spindle coupled to membrane addition (cytokinesis). In the in vitro assay the ESCRT-III proteins scaffold the formation of their own membrane neck. In vitro scission may be acting at both the intravesicular and extravesicular end of the neck, but the recycling step requires action from the extravesicular side. Substantial amounts of labeled ESCRT-III and Vps4 are on ILVs, suggesting that some of the cleavage is occurring intravesicularly. However, the ability of Vps4 to recycle a portion of the ESCRT-III demonstrates that at least some in vitro scission is driven from the extravesicular end. Under physiological conditions, the presence of cargo, Gag, etc., is likely to inhibit scission from the intravesicular side of the neck. The efficiency of the neck closure and the predominance of extravesicular cleavage would be higher in the physiological setting of a preformed neck. None of this alters the major conclusion that ESCRT-III alone can detach ILVs from the limiting membrane.

The second major insight pertains to the role of ATP hydrolysis by Vps4, the only thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. It has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis by Vps4, whilst anchored tightly to the membrane by ESCRT-III, could power a dynamin-like constriction of the neck leading to cleavage 26 . While Vps4 can disassemble ESCRT-III in vitro 25 , 26 , the relationship between disassembly and vesicle scission was unknown. Here we find that Vps4 acts after the membrane scission step to recycle ESCRT-III proteins. This has a precedent in SNARE-dependent vesicle fusion. SNAREs drive vesicle fusion by forming tight complexes that bring opposing membranes into proximity 38 . SNARE complexes do not dissociate spontaneously, but require the hydrolysis of ATP by the ATPase, NSF after membrane fusion 38 . A recycling role for Vps4 is consistent with all available data, and fits well with the SNARE-NSF precedent.

Snf7 is the most critical of the ESCRT-III subunits for membrane scission. Snf7 can form either spirals or extended tubes when overexpressed 20 . The tubes suggest a mechanism for the formation of invaginations of the GUV membrane, although we do not propose that the tubes are involved in physiological budding. In MVB biogenesis, the inward bud is filled with cargo, and in HIV-1 budding, with the Gag protein. In the in vitro system, the ability of ESCRT-III components to form inward buds independently of cargo, Gag, or other factors, has fortuitously yielded membrane necks for study as scission substrates. The spirals suggest an attractive mechanism for membrane scission in both in vitro and physiological settings ( Fig. 6 ). In this model, one surface of Snf7 is tightly anchored to the membrane. Other Snf7 surfaces form an inwardly-growing spiral. The growing spiral could progressively squeeze the membrane neck until critical proximity for membrane fusion is reached ( Fig. 6 , Supplementary Movie 3 ).

In conclusion, ESCRT-III has the instrinsic ability to drive the scission of membrane necks. Vps4 recycles ESCRT-III but does not directly participate in neck closure. Further elaborations of this ESCRT reconstitution should help complete the mechanistic analysis of the pathway.
