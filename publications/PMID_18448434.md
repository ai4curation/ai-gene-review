The Cdc42 effector IRSp53 is a strong inducer of filopodia formation and 
consists of an Src homology domain 3 (SH3), a potential WW-binding motif, a 
partial-Cdc42/Rac interacting binding region motif, and an 
Inverse-Bin-Amphiphysins-Rvs (I-BAR) domain. We show that IRSp53 interacts 
directly with neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) via its SH3 
domain and furthermore that N-WASP is required for filopodia formation as IRSp53 
failed to induce filopodia formation in N-WASP knock-out (KO) fibroblasts. 
IRSp53-induced filopodia formation can be reconstituted in N-WASP KO fibroblasts 
by full-length N-WASP, by N-WASPDeltaWA (a mutant unable to activate the Arp2/3 
complex), and by N-WASPH208D (a mutant unable to bind Cdc42). IRSp53 failed to 
induce filopodia in mammalian enabled (Mena)/VASP KO cells, and N-WASP failed to 
induce filopodia when IRSp53 was knocked down with RNA interference. The IRSp53 
I-BAR domain alone induces dynamic membrane protrusions that lack actin and are 
smaller than normal filopodia ("partial-filopodia") in both wild-type N-WASP and 
N-WASP KO cells. We propose that IRSp53 generates filopodia by coupling membrane 
protrusion through its I-BAR domain with actin dynamics through SH3 domain 
binding partners, including N-WASP and Mena.
