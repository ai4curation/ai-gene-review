## Abstract

1. Mol Pharmacol. 1993 Aug;44(2):364-70.

Differential effects of antimycin A on endocytosis and exocytosis of transferrin 
also are observed for internalization and externalization of beta-adrenergic 
receptors.

In many cells catecholamines induce a translocation of beta-adrenergic receptors 
from the cell surface to intracellular vesicular sites. We have postulated that 
the translocation event is the result of ligand-induced endocytosis of the 
receptor, probably via clathrin-coated pits. Previously, we demonstrated that 
reduction of cellular ATP content with antimycin A completely blocked 
endocytosis of epidermal growth factor and translocation of beta-adrenergic 
receptors in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. However, the effect of reduction in ATP 
content on endocytosis remains controversial. In the present report, we 
demonstrate that reduction of ATP content to a level < 5% of that in control 
cells is sufficient to prevent endocytosis of [125I]iodotransferrin and 
translocation of beta-adrenergic receptors. The further demonstration that 
reactions leading to the return of internalized transferrin or beta-adrenergic 
receptors to the cell surface are blocked after relatively modest reductions in 
ATP content provides further evidence of the similarity in the processes 
subserving diacytosis of beta-adrenergic receptors and transferrin. The 
differential requirement for ATP of the two arms of diacytosis provides the 
basis for an explanation of the controversy regarding a requirement for ATP in 
endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits.
