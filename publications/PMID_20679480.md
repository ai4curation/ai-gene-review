The Ras-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras-RAF-MAPK) pathway is 
overactive in many cancers and in some developmental disorders. In one of those 
disorders, namely, Noonan syndrome, nine activating C-RAF mutations cluster 
around Ser(259), a regulatory site for inhibition by 14-3-3 proteins. We show 
that these mutations impair binding of 14-3-3 proteins to C-RAF and alter its 
subcellular localization by promoting Ras-mediated plasma membrane recruitment 
of C-RAF. By presenting biophysical binding data, the 14-3-3/C-RAFpS(259) 
crystal structure, and cellular analyses, we indicate a mechanistic link between 
a well-described human developmental disorder and the impairment of a 
14-3-3/target protein interaction. As a broader implication of these findings, 
modulating the C-RAFSer(259)/14-3-3 protein-protein interaction with a 
stabilizing small molecule may yield a novel potential approach for treatment of 
diseases resulting from an overactive Ras-RAF-MAPK pathway.
