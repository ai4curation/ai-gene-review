A human ribosomal protein S17 cDNA [Chen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83 
(1986) 6907-6911] was used to isolate four S17 DNA clones from human genomic 
libraries constructed in bacteriophage lambda and cosmid vectors. Based on its 
transcriptional activity in a transient expression assay and on sequence 
similarity with S17 cDNA, cosmid clone HGS17-6 was identified as carrying the 
functional RPS17 gene. RPS17 is composed of five exons and four introns that 
span 4 kb of DNA. Two lambda clones of human genomic DNA were recognized as 
containing processed S17 pseudogenes, because (i) they were transcriptionally 
inactive in the transient assay, and (ii) they possess multiple, perfectly 
spliced RPS17 exons. Their coding sequences differ slightly from the cDNA and 
functional genomic clone.
