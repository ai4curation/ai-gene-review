The chaperonin-containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) is a cytosolic molecular 
chaperone composed of eight subunits that assists in the folding of actin, 
tubulin and other cytosolic proteins. We show here that the content of 
particular subunits of CCT within mammalian cells decreases concomitantly with 
the reduction of chaperone activity during cell cycle arrest at M phase. CCT 
recovers chaperone activity upon resumption of these subunits after release from 
M phase arrest or during arrest at S phase. The levels of alpha, delta and 
zeta-1 subunits decreased more rapidly than the other subunits during M phase 
arrest by colcemid treatment and recovered after release from the arrest. Gel 
filtration chromatography or native (nondenaturing) PAGE analysis followed by 
immunoblotting indicated that the alpha and delta subunit content in the 700- to 
900-kDa CCT complex was appreciably lower in the M phase cells than in 
asynchronous cells. In vivo, the CCT complex of M-phase-arrested cells was found 
to bind lower amounts of tubulin than that of asynchronous cells. In vitro, the 
CCT complex of M phase-arrested cells was less active in binding and folding 
denatured actin than that of asynchronous cells. On the other hand, the CCT 
complex of asynchronous cells (a mixture of various phases of cell cycle) 
exhibited lower alpha and delta subunit content and lower chaperone activity 
than that of S-phase-arrested cells obtained by excess thymidine treatment. In 
addition, turnover (synthesis and degradation) rates of the alpha and delta 
subunits in vivo were more rapid than those of most other subunits. These 
results suggest that the content of alpha and delta subunits of CCT reduces from 
the complete active complex in S phase cells to incomplete inactive complex in M 
phase cells.
