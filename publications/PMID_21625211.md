14-3-3σ, a gene upregulated by p53 in response to DNA damage, exists as part of 
a positive-feedback loop, which activates p53 and is a human cancer epithelial 
marker downregulated in various cancer types. 14-3-3σ levels are critical for 
maintaining p53 activity in response to DNA damage and regulating signal 
mediators such as Akt. In this study, we identify mammalian constitutive 
photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for targeting 14-3-3σ 
through proteasomal degradation. We show for the first time that COP9 
signalosome subunit 6 (CSN6) associates with COP1 and is involved in 14-3-3σ 
ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Mechanistic studies show that CSN6 expression 
leads to stabilization of COP1 through reducing COP1 self-ubiquitination and 
decelerating COP1's turnover rate. We also show that CSN6-mediated 14-3-3σ 
ubiquitination is compromised when COP1 is knocked down. Thus, CSN6 mediates 
14-3-3σ ubiquitination through enhancing COP1 stability. Subsequently, we show 
that CSN6 causes 14-3-3σ downregulation, thereby activating Akt and promoting 
cell survival. Also, CSN6 overexpression leads to increased cell growth, 
transformation and promotes tumorigenicity. Significantly, 14-3-3σ expression 
can correct the abnormalities mediated by CSN6 expression. These data suggest 
that the CSN6-COP1 axis is involved in 14-3-3σ degradation, and that 
deregulation of this axis will promote cell growth and tumorigenicity.

Introduction

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is important for controlling the abundance of proteins and plays an essential role in maintaining normal cellular function. Dysregulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis results in the development of a variety of human cancers ( Hoeller et al. , 2006 ). The evolutionarily conserved Constitutive Photomorphogenesis 9 Signalosome (CSN) was originally identified from plant ( Arabidopsis ) mutants that mimic light-induced seedling development when grown in the dark ( Chamovitz et al. , 1996 ; Karniol and Chamovitz, 2000 ; Wei and Deng, 1992 ). Mammalian COP9 signalosome contains eight subunits (CSN1–CSN8), which share sequence homology with subunits of the ‘lid’ complex of the 26S proteasome ( Li and Deng, 2003 ). Because of the homology, the COP9 signalosome has been postulated to play a role in protein degradation. CSN6 and CSN5 are the only two subunits that contain an MPN ( M pr1p and P ad1p N -terminal) domain ( Gusmaroli et al. , 2007 ; Peng et al. , 2001 ), which will have impact on Cullin-Ring Ligases (CRL) ( Cope et al. , 2002 ; Wang et al. , 2001 ). CSN5 has an MPN domain containing a JAMM (JAB1/MPN/Mov34) or MPN+ motif linked to the metalloprotease motif (EXnHXHX10D) that can deneddylate Cullins ( Cope et al. , 2002 ), a process important for regulating CRL activity. By comparison, CSN6 is not recognized to have a JAMM motif and thus its function remains obscure. Recently, CSN6 was characterized as a positive regulator of MDM2 ( Zhao et al. , 2011 ).

Mammalian Constitutive Photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) is an evolutionarily conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase which contains RING-finger, coiled-coil and WD40-repeat domains ( Yi and Deng, 2005 ). Through association with the COP9 signalosome, COP1 has been identified as a crucial mediator to block photomorphogenesis in the dark through the ubiquitinated proteasomal degradation of light-induced transcription factor HY5 ( Hardtke et al. , 2000 ; von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ). In mammalian cells, the ubiquitinated targets of COP1 include stress-responsive transcription factors p53 ( Dornan et al. , 2004a ; Su et al. , 2010 ), suggesting its role in cancer. COP1 is overexpressed in cancers ( Su et al. , 2011 ), but whether COP1 targets any tumor suppressor protein for degradation during tumorigenesis remains elusive.

14-3-3 proteins are a family of evolutionarily conserved regulatory chaperone molecules involved in many diverse physiological functions, including signal transduction, stress response, apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoint regulation ( Fu et al. , 2000 ; Laronga et al. , 2000 ; Yaffe et al. , 1997 ). Binding by 14-3-3 proteins mediates stability and/or subcellular localization of target proteins ( Michaud et al. , 1995 ). 14-3-3σ was originally characterized as a human mammary epithelial-specific marker (HME1) ( Prasad et al. , 1992 ), and was later found to be an essential regulator of apoptosis, cell migration, cell cycle ( Hermeking et al. , 1997 ; Laronga et al. , 2000 ) and DNA damage response involving p53 and MDM2 ( Lee and Lozano, 2006 ; Yang et al. , 2003 ; Yang et al. , 2007 ). 14-3-3σ, but not other family members, has been found to be frequently lost or decreased in various human cancers ( Lee and Lozano, 2006 ; Li et al. , 2009b ) and functions as a potential tumor suppressor. In response to DNA damage, 14-3-3σ is known to be a p53 downstream target and may serve as a regulator to prevent oxidative and DNA-damage stress-induced mitotic checkpoint dysfunction ( Hermeking et al. , 1997 ; Lee and Lozano, 2006 ). 14-3-3σ also acts as a negative regulator of Akt ( Yang et al. , 2006 ). As for its role in cancer, a previous report showed that there is a high frequency of hypermethylation at the 14-3-3σ gene locus in breast cancer ( Ferguson et al. , 2000 ). Posttranscriptional regulation such as ubiquitination also regulates 14-3-3σ ( Horie-Inoue and Inoue, 2006 ). Although 14-3-3σ may play an important role in protecting cells from DNA damage or cancer, the detailed mechanism by which 14-3-3σ is modulated remains not well characterized. In this study, we found that CSN6, COP1 and 14-3-3σ interact and we demonstrated the role of the CSN6-COP1 axis in regulating 14-3-3σ stability. Our studies indicate the applicability of employing CSN6-COP1 axis as a therapeutic intervention target in cancer.

Discussion

In mammalian cells, COP1 regulates various cellular targets, including stress-responsive transcription factors, p53 tumor suppressor ( Dornan et al. , 2004a ), c-JUN ( Bianchi et al. , 2003 ; Savio et al. , 2008 ; Wertz et al. , 2004 ), acetyl-coA carboxylase ( Qi et al. , 2006 ), TORC2 ( Dentin et al. , 2007 ), MVP ( Yi et al. , 2005 ) and nucleosome remodeling factor MTA1 ( Li et al. , 2009a ), suggesting its versatile functions. Many COP1 associated proteins remain to be characterized. In this study, our results indicate that COP1 binds and is a novel E3 ligase for 14-3-3σ.

The known proteins interacting with 14-3-3 σ, include Cdk’s ( Chan et al. , 1999 ; Laronga et al. , 2000 ), p53 ( Yang et al. , 2003 ) and Efp (estrogen inducible finger protein) ( Urano et al. , 2002 ) and all play important roles in tumorigenesis. We find here that CSN6 is a new 14-3-3σ-associating protein ( Fig. 1 ) and is important in promoting cancer growth ( Fig. 6 ) through its binding and degradation of 14-3-3σ ( Fig. 2 ). We further determined that CSN6 regulates 14-3-3σ posttransccriptionally by enhancing 14-3-3σ ubiquitination. CSN6 does not have the conserved RING or HECT domains found in well-characterized E3 ligases. Therefore, at issue is how CSN6 causes 14-3-3σ downregulation. Thus we searched for potential ligases that could associate with the COP9 signalosome and found that the COP1 E3 ligase is a potential candidate. It is worthwhile to point out that as an E3 ligase for p53, COP1 drives the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of p53, thereby maintaining low steady-state levels of p53 in unstressed cells ( Dornan et al. , 2004b ). In this way, COP1 may antagonize the activity of positive p53 regulators such as 14-3-3σ, which can stabilize p53 by reducing p53 ubiquitination level. Also, COP1 is downregulated in response to DNA damage ( Dornan et al. , 2006 ), while 14-3-3σ protein level is elevated by DNA damage ( Hermeking et al. , 1997 ). Together, it is conceivable that COP1 and 14-3-3σ may have a functional relationship. Indeed, we observed for the first time that CSN6 recruits RING containing COP1 to degrade 14-3-3σ. This is based on the observation that CSN6-mediated 14-3-3σ degradation is compromised when COP1 is knocked down with shRNA. Importantly, CSN6 not only associates with COP1 but also prevents COP1’s self-ubiquitination, adding yet another layer of regulation.

Although Efp, another RING containing protein, was previously characterized as an E3 ligase for 14-3-3σ ( Urano et al. , 2002 ), it remains to be studied whether CSN6 also recruits Efp to degrade 14-3-3σ. Interestingly, Efp has another activity and seems to serve as an E3 ligase to add ISG15 (15 Kd protein encoded by an interferon stimulated gene) for 14-3-3σ-ISGylation ( Horie-Inoue and Inoue, 2006 ; Zou and Zhang, 2006 ), but the role of this type of modification in terms of 14-3-3σ protein degradation remains unclear. We previously showed that 14-3-3σ is a negative regulator of Akt ( Yang et al. , 2006 ). Consistent with this, we found that CSN6 can downregulate the expression of 14-3-3σ and lead to Akt activation. The observation that CSN6 increases the activity of Akt ( Fig. 5 ) is very intriguing. This is the first discovery that links the COP9 signalosome with Akt activation. We have shown that CSN6 is involved in14-3-3σ-mediated Akt inhibition, which in turn potentiates Akt-meditated cell survival ( Fig. 5 ). Our mechanistic studies of CSN6-mediated 14-3-3σ downregulation explains how CSN6 can activate Akt in our proposed model ( Fig. 6D ). This study shows that CSN6 positively regulates Akt and promotes Akt-mediated cell survival to prevent apoptosis. Clearly, the CSN6-Akt link will be an important molecular target for rational cancer therapy. Indeed, we show that adenoviral gene delivery of 14-3-3σ can inhibit tumorigenicity mediated by CSN6 activity in cancer models ( Fig. 6 ). Since both CSN6 and COP1 are involved in degrading 14-3-3σ, promoting cell survival and increasing tumorigenicity, targeting the CSN6-COP1 axis may be a useful therapeutic strategy for cancer intervention.
