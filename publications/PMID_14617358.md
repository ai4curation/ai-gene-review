Regulation of membrane trafficking requires the concerted actions of rab 
proteins, their effectors and several phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinases. Rab7 is 
required for late endosomal transport and here we establish that the 
phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase hVPS34 and its adaptor protein p150 are rab7 
interacting partners. The hVPS34/p150 complex colocalized with rab7 on late 
endosomes and hVPS34 activity was dependent on nucleotide cycling of rab7. In 
addition, total cellular phosphatidylinositol 3'-phosphate levels were modulated 
by rab7 expression, suggesting that rab7 activation impacted kinase cycling to 
early endosomes. The data identify rab7 as an important regulator of late 
endosomal hVPS34 function and link rab7 to the regulation of 
phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase cycling between early and late endosomes.
