In addition to DNA repair pathways, cells utilize translesion DNA synthesis 
(TLS) to bypass DNA lesions during replication. During TLS, Y-family DNA 
polymerase (Polη, Polκ, Polı and Rev1) inserts specific nucleotide opposite 
preferred DNA lesions, and then Polζ consisting of two subunits, Rev3 and Rev7, 
carries out primer extension. Here, we report the complex structures of 
Rev3-Rev7-Rev1(CTD) and Rev3-Rev7-Rev1(CTD)-Polκ(RIR). These two structures 
demonstrate that Rev1(CTD) contains separate binding sites for Polκ and Rev7. 
Our BIAcore experiments provide additional support for the notion that the 
interaction between Rev3 and Rev7 increases the affinity of Rev7 and Rev1. We 
also verified through FRET experiment that Rev1, Rev3, Rev7 and Polκ form a 
stable quaternary complex in vivo, thereby suggesting an efficient switching 
mechanism where the "inserter" polymerase can be immediately replaced by an 
"extender" polymerase within the same quaternary complex.
