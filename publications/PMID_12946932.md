Insulin resistance is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and is associated with 
hyperinsulinemia, abnormal lipid profile, and hypertension. Whether 
hyperinsulinemia affects vascular function independent of insulin resistance or 
other metabolic risk factors is unknown. This investigation aimed to assess the 
effects of hyperinsulinemia on endothelial function in subjects with a spectrum 
of insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. Endothelium-dependent (flow-mediated 
dilation, FMD) and -independent (nitroglycerin) responses of the brachial artery 
were studied by high-resolution ultrasound before and during hyperinsulinemia 
(euglycemic clamp) in 25 normoglycemic, normotensive subjects. Participants were 
divided into an insulin-sensitive and an insulin-resistant subgroup based on 
their sensitivity index values, with a cutoff of 8, and into a 
normal-cholesterol and a high-cholesterol subgroup based on their total 
cholesterol levels, with a cutoff of 5.2 mmol/l (200 mg/dl). In the whole 
population, FMD was lower during hyperinsulinemia compared with baseline (2.3 
+/- 0.6% vs. 6 +/- 0.6%; P < 0.001). Resting FMD was lower in the 
insulin-resistant subgroup compared with the insulin-sensitive subgroup (4.2 +/- 
0.9% vs. 7.4 +/- 0.8%; P = 0.014) and in the high-cholesterol subjects compared 
with the normal-cholesterol subjects (4.4 +/- 0.7% vs. 8 +/- 0.7%; P = 0.002). 
Hyperinsulinemia decreased FMD in both the insulin-sensitive (from 7.4 +/- 0.8% 
to 3.6 +/- 0.4%; P < 0.001) and insulin-resistant (from 4.2% to 1.22%; P = 
0.012) subgroups and in both the normal-cholesterol (from 8 +/- 0.7% to 3.9 +/- 
0.4%; P < 0.001) and high-cholesterol (from 4.4 +/- 0.7% to 1.1 +/- 0.8%; P = 
0.01) participants. Acute hyperinsulinemia impairs conduit vessel endothelial 
function independent of insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. Insulin may 
trigger endothelial dysfunction and promote atherosclerosis.
