Diphthamide, a posttranslational modification of translation elongation factor 2 
that is conserved in all eukaryotes and archaebacteria and is the target of 
diphtheria toxin, is formed in yeast by the actions of five proteins, Dph1 to 
-5, and a still unidentified amidating enzyme. Dph2 and Dph5 were previously 
identified. Here, we report the identification of the remaining three yeast 
proteins (Dph1, -3, and -4) and show that all five Dph proteins have either 
functional (Dph1, -2, -3, and -5) or sequence (Dph4) homologs in mammals. We 
propose a unified nomenclature for these proteins (e.g., HsDph1 to -5 for the 
human proteins) and their genes based on the yeast nomenclature. We show that 
Dph1 and Dph2 are homologous in sequence but functionally independent. The human 
tumor suppressor gene OVCA1, previously identified as homologous to yeast DPH2, 
is shown to actually be HsDPH1. We show that HsDPH3 is the previously described 
human diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A sensitivity required gene 1 
and that DPH4 encodes a CSL zinc finger-containing DnaJ-like protein. Other 
features of these genes are also discussed. The physiological function of 
diphthamide and the basis of its ubiquity remain a mystery, but evidence is 
presented that Dph1 to -3 function in vivo as a protein complex in multiple 
cellular processes.
