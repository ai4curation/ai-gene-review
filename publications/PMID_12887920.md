Apoptosis induced by TNF-receptor I (TNFR1) is thought to proceed via 
recruitment of the adaptor FADD and caspase-8 to the receptor complex. TNFR1 
signaling is also known to activate the transcription factor NF-kappa B and 
promote survival. The mechanism by which this decision between cell death and 
survival is arbitrated is not clear. We report that TNFR1-induced apoptosis 
involves two sequential signaling complexes. The initial plasma membrane bound 
complex (complex I) consists of TNFR1, the adaptor TRADD, the kinase RIP1, and 
TRAF2 and rapidly signals activation of NF-kappa B. In a second step, TRADD and 
RIP1 associate with FADD and caspase-8, forming a cytoplasmic complex (complex 
II). When NF-kappa B is activated by complex I, complex II harbors the caspase-8 
inhibitor FLIP(L) and the cell survives. Thus, TNFR1-mediated-signal 
transduction includes a checkpoint, resulting in cell death (via complex II) in 
instances where the initial signal (via complex I, NF-kappa B) fails to be 
activated.
