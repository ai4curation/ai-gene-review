Interleukin-9 (IL-9), a T-cell-derived cytokine, interacts with a specific 
receptor associated with the IL-2 receptor gamma chain. In this report, we 
analyze the functional domains of the human IL-9 receptor transfected into mouse 
lymphoid cell lines. Three different functions were examined: growth stimulation 
in factor-dependent pro-B Ba/F3 cells, protection against dexamethasone-induced 
apoptosis, and Ly-6A2 induction in BW5147 lymphoma cells. The results indicated 
that a single tyrosine, at position 116 in the cytoplasmic domain, was required 
for all three activities. In addition, we observed that human IL-9 reduced the 
proliferation rate of transfected BW5147 cells, an effect also dependent on the 
same tyrosine. This amino acid was necessary for IL-9-mediated tyrosine 
phosphorylation of the receptor and for STAT activation but not for IRS-2/4PS 
activation or for JAK1 phosphorylation, which depended on a domain closer to the 
plasma membrane. We also showed that JAK1 was constitutively associated with the 
IL-9 receptor. Activated STAT complexes induced by IL-9 were found to contain 
STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 transcription factors. Moreover, sequence homologies 
between human IL-9 receptor tyrosine 116 and tyrosines (of other receptors 
activating STAT3 and STAT5 were observed. Taken together, these data indicate 
that a single tyrosine of the IL-9 receptor, required for activation of three 
different STAT proteins, is necessary for distinct activities of this cytokine, 
including proliferative responses.
