Human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (hCMPCs) are cardiac progenitor cells that 
are unique for their efficient differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes 
without requiring co-culture with neonatal cardiomyocytes. hCMPCs have shown 
great potential in preserving the function of infarcted mouse myocardium. 
MiRNA-204 has been reported to be up-regulated in differentiated hCMPCs, 
however, its biological significance is unclear. In this study, hCMPC 
proliferation, viability, apoptosis and necrosis were determined using the ELISA 
Kit (colorimetric BrdU detection), Cell Counting Kit-8, and Annexin V and 
propidium iodide staining, respectively. MiRNA-204 inhibition promoted hCMPC 
proliferation without affecting cell viability and the level of apoptosis and 
necrosis, indicating that miRNA-204 might be required for hCMPC differentiation. 
Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions were used to 
detect the expression profile of cardiac genes, including MEF2C, GATA-4, 
Nkx-2.5, TropT, βMHC, and cActin. Cardiac α-actin staining was used to quantify 
the degree of differentiation. MiRNA-204 inhibition significantly down-regulated 
TropT, βMHC, and cActin and reduced differentiation by 47.81% after 2 weeks of 
differentiation induction. Interestingly, miRNA-204 mimics (30 nM) did not 
promote hCMPC proliferation and differentiation. The bioinformatic tool GOmir 
identified the activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) as a potential target, 
which was confirmed by Western blot and a luciferase reporter assay. ATF-2 
overexpression promoted hCMPC proliferation, further demonstrating the role 
played by ATF-2 as a target gene of miRNA-204. Therefore, miRNA-204 is required 
for hCMPC differentiation and ATF-2 is a target gene of miRNA-204 in hCMPCs. 
This study indicates that miRNA-204 is among the regulators that drive hCMPC 
proliferation and differentiation, and miRNA-204 might be used to influence cell 
fate.
