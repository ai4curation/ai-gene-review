Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that synthesizes telomere 
repeats in tissue progenitor cells and cancer cells. Active human telomerase 
consists of at least three principal subunits, including the telomerase reverse 
transcriptase, the telomerase RNA (TERC), and dyskerin. Here, we identify a 
holoenzyme subunit, TCAB1 (telomerase Cajal body protein 1), that is notably 
enriched in Cajal bodies, nuclear sites of RNP processing that are important for 
telomerase function. TCAB1 associates with active telomerase enzyme, established 
telomerase components, and small Cajal body RNAs that are involved in modifying 
splicing RNAs. Depletion of TCAB1 by using RNA interference prevents TERC from 
associating with Cajal bodies, disrupts telomerase-telomere association, and 
abrogates telomere synthesis by telomerase. Thus, TCAB1 controls telomerase 
trafficking and is required for telomere synthesis in human cancer cells.
