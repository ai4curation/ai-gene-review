The circadian clock is an endogenous mechanism that coordinates biological 
processes with daily and seasonal changes in the environment. Heterodimerization 
of central clock components is an important way of controlling clock function in 
several different circadian systems. CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE 
ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) are Myb-related proteins that function in or close to 
the central oscillator in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Single mutants of 
cca1 and lhy have a phenotype of short-period rhythms. cca1 lhy double mutants 
show an even shorter period phenotype than the cca1 single mutant, suggesting 
that CCA1 and LHY are only partially functionally redundant. To determine 
whether CCA1 and LHY act in parallel or synergistically in the circadian clock, 
we examined their expression in both light-grown and etiolated seedlings. We 
have shown that LHY and CCA1 bind to the same region of the promoter of a 
Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (Lhcb, also known as CAB). CCA1 and LHY 
can form homodimers, and they also colocalize in the nucleus and heterodimerize 
in vitro and in vivo. In Arabidopsis, CCA1 and LHY physically interact in a 
manner independent of photoperiod. Moreover, results from gel filtration 
chromatography indicate that CCA1 and LHY are present in the same large complex 
in plants. Taken together, these results imply that CCA1 and LHY function 
synergistically in regulating circadian rhythms of Arabidopsis.

Abstract

The circadian clock is an endogenous mechanism that coordinates biological processes with daily and seasonal changes in the environment. Heterodimerization of central clock components is an important way of controlling clock function in several different circadian systems. CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) are Myb-related proteins that function in or close to the central oscillator in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). Single mutants of cca1 and lhy have a phenotype of short-period rhythms. cca1 lhy double mutants show an even shorter period phenotype than the cca1 single mutant, suggesting that CCA1 and LHY are only partially functionally redundant. To determine whether CCA1 and LHY act in parallel or synergistically in the circadian clock, we examined their expression in both light-grown and etiolated seedlings. We have shown that LHY and CCA1 bind to the same region of the promoter of a Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein ( Lhcb , also known as CAB ). CCA1 and LHY can form homodimers, and they also colocalize in the nucleus and heterodimerize in vitro and in vivo. In Arabidopsis, CCA1 and LHY physically interact in a manner independent of photoperiod. Moreover, results from gel filtration chromatography indicate that CCA1 and LHY are present in the same large complex in plants. Taken together, these results imply that CCA1 and LHY function synergistically in regulating circadian rhythms of Arabidopsis.

DISCUSSION

It has been shown that heterodimerization of central clock components is an important way of controlling clock function in other circadian systems ( Dunlap, 1999 ). Examples include the interaction of PER and TIM in Drosophila as a means of controlling the nuclear entry and degradation of both proteins ( Edery, 1999 ; Meyer et al., 2006 ), the interactions among Kai proteins in cyanobacteria ( Iwasaki et al., 1999 ) and heterodimers of the transcription factors mCLOCK and BMAL1, and interactions among three mPER (PER1–PER3) and two CRYPTOCHROME (mCRY1 and mCRY2) proteins in mammals ( Reppert and Weaver, 2002 ; Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004 ). In this study, we demonstrate that CCA1 and LHY have similar expression patterns, bind to a similar region of the Lhcb1*3 promoter, colocalize in the nucleus, and that they can physically interact both in vitro and in plants. These findings are consistent with the evidence showing the involvement of dimerization between core oscillator components in the mammalian system ( Kwon et al., 2006 ) and in Drosophila ( Meyer et al., 2006 ), suggesting that homodimerization and heterodimerization might be conserved aspects in the regulation of eukaryotic circadian clocks.

The observation that cca1-1 plants show persistent rhythms in LL, albeit with a shorter period length than wild type, has been attributed to the presence of functionally redundant components in the circadian system, particularly to the CCA1-homolog LHY ( Green and Tobin, 1999 ). We have shown that in mutants lacking both CCA1 and LHY , rhythms are still generated and persist in LL, but with a reduced amplitude and shortened period length ( Fig. 1 ). Similar results have been reported elsewhere ( Locke et al., 2005 ). Hence, a compromised, but functioning oscillator continues to operate in the absence of the two proteins. It is known that CCA1 and LHY belong to a 10-member family of Myb-related proteins that have significant homology in their Myb domains ( Yanhui et al., 2006 ). Moreover, some of the single Myb domain proteins in this family have been reported to be under circadian control ( Somers, 1999 ; Strayer and Kay, 1999 ; Kuno et al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2007 ). One can postulate that in the absence of CCA1 and LHY , some or all of the eight remaining members can substitute for them to some extent so that some rhythmic expression is maintained.

The phenotype of the single mutants and the enhanced phenotype of cca1 lhy double mutants ( Fig. 1 ) indicate that CCA1 and LHY are not entirely functionally redundant. One possibility is that CCA1 and LHY have distinct roles and work in parallel in the control of circadian rhythms. Alternatively, CCA1 and LHY may have similar functions, but either the dosage of their combined gene products or the interactions between them are crucial for their function. cca1 and lhy single mutants have similar phenotypes ( Green and Tobin, 1999 ; Alabadí et al., 2002 ; Mizoguchi et al., 2002 ), and overexpression of each gene has similar effects on circadian rhythms ( Schaffer et al., 1998 ; Wang and Tobin, 1998 ). Together with the evidence presented here that CCA1 and LHY have similar expression patterns ( Fig. 2 ) and that LHY and CCA1 bind to the same region of the Lhcb1*3 promoter ( Fig. 3 ), this suggests that CCA1 and LHY have closely related functions within the circadian system. It has been shown that proteins containing a single Myb domain could bind DNA as dimers ( Jin and Martin, 1999 ). In Drosophila , the transcription factors CYC and dCLK are localized in the nucleus and activated by dimerization. The complex of CYC and dCLK binds to the E-boxes of the PER and TIM promoters and activates their expression ( Shirasu et al., 2003 ). Our results showed that CCA1 and LHY not only homodimerize but also colocalize in the nucleus and form heterodimers in vitro and in vivo ( Figs. 4 and 5 ). The interaction between CCA1 and LHY was confirmed in plants using coimmunoprecipitation with total plant extract of wild-type Arabidopsis ( Fig. 6 ). In addition, we determined that the region of CCA1 between amino acids 136 and 316 is responsible for interacting with LHY ( Figs. 4B and 5D ). Although the functional significance of CCA1 and LHY dimerization has yet to be elucidated, one hypothesis is that homodimers and heterodimers may have different effects on nuclear entry, DNA binding, and/or protein degradation. In wild-type plants, heterodimers of CCA1 and LHY could be important for proper feedback inhibition and in single mutants of cca1 and lhy , CCA1 or LHY may form homodimers, which could maintain rhythmic oscillations but cause the feedback inhibition to occur faster and result in a short-period phenotype. This is consistent with the notion that CCA1 and LHY have different biochemical activities ( Gould et al., 2006 ) and they are only partially redundant in the circadian system.

In an effort to detect CCA1/LHY heterodimers in plants, wild-type plant extracts were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography. Interestingly, both CCA1 and LHY are found in a large complex ( Fig. 7A ). This novel finding will open up new opportunities for future work. Because CCA1 and LHY physically interact ( Fig. 7B ), it is likely that they are present in the same complex. The calculated molecular mass of heterodimers of CCA1/LHY is about 150 kD, yet the CCA1/LHY-containing complex is >400 kD ( Fig. 7 ). Discovery of other components in the complex will significantly increase our knowledge of the functions of CCA1 and LHY and of the central oscillator of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. To discover other components of the protein complex, transgenic plants expressing tandem affinity purification-tagged CCA1 have been generated and will be used to purify the complex.

In summary, our study shows that CCA1 and LHY not only homodimerize, but also colocalize in the nucleus and heterodimerize. They are also present in a protein complex, suggesting that CCA1 and LHY function synergistically in the control of circadian rhythms of Arabidopsis.
