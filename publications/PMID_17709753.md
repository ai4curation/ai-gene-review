The key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease include synaptic 
dysfunction, profound changes in the cholinergic system, and deposition of 
beta-amyloid peptides generated by proteolytic processing of the amyloid-beta 
precursor protein (APP). However, the pathways linking APP with synaptic 
activity and cholinergic neuronal function are poorly understood. We report here 
that APP is essential in regulating the presynaptic expression and activity of 
the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT), a molecule that mediates the 
rate-limiting step of cholinergic synaptic transmission in both the 
neuromuscular junction and central cholinergic neurons. Loss of APP leads to 
aberrant localization of CHT at the neuromuscular synapses and reduced CHT 
activity at cholinergic projections. At the cellular level, we show that APP and 
CHT can be found in Rab5-positive endosomal compartments and that APP affects 
CHT endocytosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that APP interacts with CHT through 
the C-terminal domain, providing support for a specific and direct regulation of 
CHT by APP through protein-protein interactions. These results identify a 
physiological activity of APP in cholinergic neurons, and our data indicate that 
deregulation of APP function may contribute to cholinergic impairment and AD 
pathogenesis.
