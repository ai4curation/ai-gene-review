Cytoplasmic dynein-2 powers retrograde intraflagellar transport that is 
essential for cilium formation and maintenance. Inactivation of dynein-2 by 
mutations in DYNC2H1 causes skeletal dysplasias, and it remains unclear how the 
dynein-2 heavy chain moves in cilia. Here, using the genome-editing technique to 
produce fluorescent dynein-2 heavy chain in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show by 
high-resolution live microscopy that dynein-2 moves in a surprising way along 
distinct ciliary domains. Dynein-2 shows triphasic movement in the retrograde 
direction: dynein-2 accelerates in the ciliary distal region and then moves at 
maximum velocity and finally decelerates adjacent to the base, which may 
represent a physical obstacle due to transition zone barriers. By knocking the 
conserved ciliopathy-related mutations into the C. elegans dynein-2 heavy chain, 
we find that these mutations reduce its transport speed and frequency. 
Disruption of the dynein-2 tail domain, light intermediate chain, or 
intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B complex abolishes dynein-2's ciliary 
localization, revealing their important roles in ciliary entry of dynein-2. 
Furthermore, our affinity purification and genetic analyses show that IFT-A 
subunits IFT-139 and IFT-43 function redundantly to promote dynein-2 motility. 
These results reveal the molecular regulation of dynein-2 movement in sensory 
cilia.
