Angiogenesis is important in pathophysiological processes, including the 
pathogenesis of acute monocytic leukemia (AML). MicroRNA‑21 (miR‑21) is 
overexpressed and exhibits oncogenic activity in cancer. However, the biological 
mechanism underlying the effect of miR‑21 in AML remains to be fully elucidated. 
In the present study, the expression levels of miR‑21 and vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) were determined in 26 patients with AML and 28 healthy 
individuals. The secretion of VEGF was also measured following the transfection 
of THP‑1 cells with miR‑21 mimic or inhibitor. The supernatants of the THP‑1 
cells, which were transfected with miR‑21 mimic, inhibitor or small interfering 
RNA (si)VEGF, respectively, were used to incubate human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs), following which tube formation of the HUVECs was 
measured. miR‑21 targets were predicted using a biological target prediction 
website and confirmed using a luciferase assay. The effects of interleukin 
(IL)‑12 were investigated by examining the tube formation of HUVECs and the 
secretion of VEGF following recombinant human (rh) IL‑12 pretreatment. The 
results revealed that miR‑21 and VEGF expression was significantly increased in 
the peripheral blood monocytes of the patients, compared with the healthy 
controls. There was negative correlation between the expression of IL‑12 and 
miR‑21 in the serum of patients with AML. Furthermore, supernatant VEGF levels 
from the miR‑21 mimic‑transfected THP‑1 cells were increased, whereas a 
decreasing trend was observed in the miR‑21 inhibitor group. The angiogenic 
ability of the HUVECs pretreated with supernatant from the THP‑1 cells 
transfected with miR‑21 mimic was higher, and was lower in THP‑1 cells 
co‑transfected with miR‑21 mimic and siVEGF, compared with the miR‑21 mimic only 
group. A luciferase assay demonstrated that IL‑12 was the direct target of 
miR‑21, and the level of IL‑12 in the supernatant of THP‑1 cells transfected 
with miR‑21 mimic was increased. IL‑12 pretreatment increased VEGF expression 
and angiogenic ability in HUVECs. The inactivation of miR‑21 or activation of 
its target gene may be a potential therapeutic strategy in human AML.
