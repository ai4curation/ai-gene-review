To identify proteins that may participate in the activation of the protein 
kinase Raf, proteins that interact with Raf were selected in a two-hybrid 
screen. Two members of the 14-3-3 protein family were isolated that interacted 
with both the amino terminal regulatory regions of Raf and the kinase domain of 
Raf, but did not compete with the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras for 
binding to Raf. 14-3-3 proteins associated with Raf in mammalian cells and 
accompanied Raf to the membrane in the presence of activated Ras. In yeast cells 
expressing Raf and MEK, mammalian 14-3-3 beta or 14-3-3 zeta activated Raf to a 
similar extent as did expression of Ras. Therefore, 14-3-3 proteins may 
participate in or be required for the regulation of Raf function. These findings 
suggest a role for 14-3-3 proteins in Raf-mediated signal transduction.
