The cdc25 phosphatases play key roles in cell cycle progression by activating 
cyclin-dependent kinases. Two members of the 14-3-3 protein family have been 
isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins that 
interact with the human cdc25A and cdc25B phosphatases. Genes encoding the human 
homolog of the 14-3-3 epsilon protein and the previously described 14-3-3 beta 
protein have been isolated in this screening. 14-3-3 proteins constitute a 
family of well-conserved eukaryotic proteins that were originally isolated in 
mammalian brain preparations and that possess diverse biochemical activities 
related to signal transduction. We present evidence that indicates that cdc25 
and 14-3-3 proteins physically interact both in vitro and in vivo. 14-3-3 
protein does not, however, affect the phosphatase activity of cdc25A. Raf-1, 
which is known to bind 14-3-3 proteins, has recently been shown to associate 
with cdc25A and to stimulate its phosphatase activity. 14-3-3 protein, however, 
has no effect on the cdc25A-kinase activity of Raf-1. Instead, 14-3-3 may 
facilitate the association of cdc25 with Raf-1 in vivo, participating in the 
linkage between mitogenic signaling and the cell cycle machinery.
