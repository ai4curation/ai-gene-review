A high frequency of apoptosis is a conserved hallmark of oocyte development. In 
C. elegans, about half of all developing oocytes are normally killed by a 
physiological germline-specific apoptosis pathway, apparently so that they 
donate cytoplasm to the survivors. We have investigated the functions of CGH-1, 
the C. elegans ortholog of the predicted RNA helicase ste13/ME31B/RCK/p54, which 
is germline-associated in metazoans and required for sexual reproduction in 
yeast. We show that CGH-1 is expressed specifically in the germline and early 
embryo, and is localized to P granules and other possible mRNA-protein 
particles. cgh-1 is required for oocyte and sperm function. It is also needed to 
prevent the physiological germline apoptosis mechanism killing essentially all 
developing oocytes, making lack of cgh-1 function the first stimulus identified 
that can trigger this mechanism. We conclude that cgh-1 and its orthologs may 
perform conserved functions during gametogenesis, that in C. elegans certain 
aspects of oocyte development are monitored by the physiological germline 
apoptosis pathway, and that similar surveillance mechanisms may contribute to 
germline apoptosis in other species.
