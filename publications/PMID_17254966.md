Comment in
    Cell. 2007 Jan 26;128(2):241-4. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.006.

p27Kip1 controls cell proliferation by binding to and regulating the activity of 
cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Here we show that Cdk inhibition and p27 
stability are regulated through direct phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases. A 
conserved tyrosine residue (Y88) in the Cdk-binding domain of p27 can be 
phosphorylated by the Src-family kinase Lyn and the oncogene product BCR-ABL. 
Y88 phosphorylation does not prevent p27 binding to cyclin A/Cdk2. Instead, it 
causes phosphorylated Y88 and the entire inhibitory 3(10)-helix of p27 to be 
ejected from the Cdk2 active site, thus restoring partial Cdk activity. 
Importantly, this allows Y88-phosphorylated p27 to be efficiently phosphorylated 
on threonine 187 by Cdk2 which in turn promotes its SCF-Skp2-dependent 
degradation. This direct link between transforming tyrosine kinases and p27 may 
provide an explanation for Cdk kinase activities observed in p27 complexes and 
for premature p27 elimination in cells that have been transformed by activated 
tyrosine kinases.
