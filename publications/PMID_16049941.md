Several approaches have been used in an effort to identify proteins that 
interact with beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, few studies have 
addressed the identification of proteins associated with APP in brain tissue 
from patients with Alzheimer's disease. We report the results of a pilot 
proteomic study performed on complexes immunoprecipitated with APP in brain 
samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease and normal control subjects. The 21 
proteins identified could be grouped into five functional classes: molecular 
chaperones, cytoskeletal and structural proteins, proteins involved in 
trafficking, adaptors, and enzymes. Among the proteins identified, six had been 
reported previously as direct, indirect, or genetically inferred APP 
interactors. The other 15 proteins immunoprecipitated with APP were novel 
potential partners. We confirmed the APP interaction by Western blotting and 
coimmunolocalization in brain tissues, for 5 of the 21 interactors. In agreement 
with previous studies, our results are compatible with an involvement of APP in 
axonal transport and vesicular trafficking, and with a potential association of 
APP with cellular protein folding/protein degradation systems.

Abstract

Several approaches have been used in an effort to identify proteins that interact with β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, few studies have addressed the identification of proteins associated with APP in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer’s disease. We report the results of a pilot proteomic study performed on complexes immunoprecipitated with APP in brain samples of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and normal control subjects. The 21 proteins identified could be grouped into five functional classes: molecular chaperones, cytoskeletal and structural proteins, proteins involved in trafficking, adaptors, and enzymes. Among the proteins identified, six had been reported previously as direct, indirect, or genetically inferred APP interactors. The other 15 proteins immunoprecipitated with APP were novel potential partners. We confirmed the APP interaction by Western blotting and coimmunolocalization in brain tissues, for 5 of the 21 interactors. In agreement with previous studies, our results are compatible with an involvement of APP in axonal transport and vesicular trafficking, and with a potential association of APP with cellular protein folding/protein degradation systems.

Discussion

We have used immunoprecipitation followed by a proteomic-type mass spectrometric analysis to identify molecules that associate with APP in the brains of patients with AD and in control brains from patients without neurological diseases. This approach has the advantage of allowing for the unbiased exploration of all possible interactors (subject to the sensitivity of the immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry combination) in relevant settings such as diseased and nondiseased human brain tissues at a defined time in disease development. The main disadvantage of the method, which is shared by most biochemical approaches, is the required disruption of cell types and compartments at the time of lysis, potentially allowing for interactions that would not occur in intact, compartmentalized tissues or cells. Notwithstanding the latter caveat, potential bona fide interactors can be identified among the list of candidates by further immunohistochemical analyses, as we demonstrate in this study.

We have unambiguously identified 21 proteins in complexes immunoprecipitated with APP-specific antibodies from human AD brains. These proteins included APP interactors that had been described previously, such as Fe65 and αB-crystallin, indicating that we could effectively identify APP interactors in human brain tissues. Interestingly, all proteins identified were in a few functional groups: proteins involved in axonal transport, vesicle formation, and trafficking (dynamin, NEM [ N -ethyl-maleimide]-sensitive factor, Munc18, dynein, myosin); cytoskeletal and structural proteins (spectrin, actin, tubulin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light polypeptide, myelin basic protein); chaperone proteins (αB-crystallin, HSP90, HSC71, cyclophilin A), adaptors (Fe65, 14-3-3), and enzymes (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L-1 [UCH-L1], phosphoglycerate mutase A, uracil DNA glycosylase, ASK1). As noted earlier, one of the limitations of the approach used here is the bias toward proteins of high expression, and thus the failure to identify interactors of lower expression. It is likely that this limitation accounts for our failure to identify some of the known interactors of APP, such as kinesin, which was observed only when Western blotting was used.

Experimental evidence indicating a functional role for several of the identified proteins in the formation of complexes with APP was already available 12 , 13 , 20 – 22 , 32 , 33 , 40 and provides additional support for our results. Munc18a recently was found to interact with the N-terminus of X-11, an APP-interacting protein that requires the presence of the YENPTY motif at the C-terminus of APP. 51

It has been proposed that HSC70 depends on NEM-sensitive factor activity to release kinesin from trafficking vesicles. 52 Our data provide further support for the notion that APP is involved in vesicle trafficking, as we identified a member of the HSC70 family, HSC71, together with NEM-sensitive factor, in complexes with APP in lysates of human brains. Although we did not identify kinesin in complexes immunoprecipitated with APP and resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis, we were able to detect its presence in complexes immunoprecipitated by APP antibodies and Western blotting (data not shown). Consistent with the notion that APP may be involved in vesicle transport, we detected dynamin, a GTPase that regulates endocytosis, and dynein, a retrograde transport–specific motor protein, in complex with APP in human brain lysates. Confirming the previously described genetic interaction between APP and dynamin, 45 we identified this protein in complexes with APP immunoprecipitated from human AD and nondiseased brains. Interestingly, a pronounced decrease in the amount of dynamin in APP-based complexes was observed in frontal and parietal cortices of AD compared with nondiseased brains. These results suggest that APP-mediated retrograde vesicle trafficking may be compromised in the brains of patients with AD.

Our data demonstrate that APP can interact also with a minus-end–directed motor protein, dynein, which also has been genetically linked to a putative function of APP in axonal transport. 11 The interaction requires the presence of the C-terminal 15 amino acids of APP in vivo. This observation validates the rationale for the experimental approach chosen and indicates the usefulness of proteomics methods as a first-stage approach to the study of interactions of a protein of interest.

We also have identified several cytoskeletal components in APP-based complexes immunoprecipitated from human brain lysates. Actin is a fundamental constituent of the cytoskeleton and is required for the maintenance of cellular structure and a variety of processes dependent on cytoskeletal integrity, including the recycling of synaptic vesicles. 53 Although APP was not present in compartments overlapping with tubulin-containing structures in one of these studies, 13 our results suggest that APP may be associated with the microtubule-based cytoskeleton at some point during axonal trafficking.

Confirming previous reports (in the case of Fe65 13 , 21 , 33 ) and consistent with the proposed role of the intracellular domain of APP in the assembly of signaling complexes, both Fe65 and 14-3-3, which have been implicated as adaptors in different signal transduction pathways, 33 , 54 were found in APP-containing complexes immunoprecipitated from human brain lysates. Interestingly, Fountoulakis and colleagues 55 had shown previously in a two-dimensional-based study that 14-3-3 levels are increased in the AD brain.

Spectrin (α-fodrin) links cortical actin to the plasma membrane. 56 Interestingly, a genetic interaction between spectrin and the components of the γ-secretase complex presenilin and nicastrin has been found in Drosophila . 57 Presenilin or nicastrin mutations that affect Notch processing were also found to disrupt the spectrin cytoskeleton. The identification of spectrin in APP-based complexes in human brain lysates may point to a physical association between APP and spectrin that may underlie the observed genetic effect. We also found that both glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light polypeptide are present in complexes immunoprecipitated with APP from human AD brains.

Similar to previous findings in C. elegans 40 and in mammalian cell culture systems, 58 , 59 several molecular chaperones were found in complexes with APP in human brain lysates. αB-crystallin is a major constituent of the lens and is abundantly expressed in other tissues, such as in the heart. 60 This chaperone has been proposed to interact stoichiometrically with partially assembled amyloid precursors and inhibit their aggregation at the nucleation step. 61 HSP16, the C. elegans αB-crystallin homolog, is induced robustly by the expression of Aβ in the worm and colocalizes with Aβ deposits. 40 Interestingly, Aβ-associated toxicity in this model could be suppressed by inhibition of a negative regulator of HSP70 function, implying an important role for chaperones in Aβ-induced toxicity. Inhibition of proteasome activity has been shown to increase levels of αB-crystallin 62 and facilitate the interaction of HSP73, a member of the HSP70 family of cytosolic chaperones, with APP. 63 In this study, C-terminally cleaved forms of endogenous mouse APP were preferentially found in complexes with αB-crystallin in brain tissues when compared with C-terminally intact forms of the molecule.

Further supporting a role for alterations in protein folding/degradation homeostasis in AD, several reports have documented the involvement of the ubiquitin/proteasome system in pathogenic changes associated with the disease. 64 We have identified a key activity in the ubiquitin pathway, UCH-L1, in complexes with APP in brain lysates. Interestingly, UCH-L1 had been identified previously as a target of protein oxidation specific to AD brains. 27

Finally, ASK1, an apical mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that specifically activates the stress response through the stress-activated protein kinases JNK and p38 and is also required for sustained activation of the unfolded protein response, 65 was found in complexes immunoprecipitated with APP from human brain lysates. Although we did not detect the presence of JIP adaptor proteins or JNK kinases in complexes immunoprecipitated with APP from human brain lysates using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis, Western blotting of the immunoprecipitated material did show the presence of JIP-1 and JNK proteins in APP-containing complexes (these data resulted from a separate study and, together with data on the interaction of APP and ASK1, will be reported elsewhere).

In summary, this study offers a look at the spectrum of in vivo interactors with APP, and potentially with proteolytic fragments derived from APP, in AD and in control brains. Our results support previous suggestions that APP function may involve a role in axonal transport and vesicular trafficking, and also support its association with the protein folding/protein degradation machinery.
