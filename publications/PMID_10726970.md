While programmed cell death is induced by a variety of internal and external 
stimuli, including reactive oxygen species, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is 
involved in opposing cell death and affects the antioxidant status of cells. 
Since the exact mechanism of its action is uncertain, in this study we examined 
the role of Bcl-2 using a loss of function model, Bcl-2 knockout mice. The 
consequence of Bcl-2 knockout was assessed in kidneys, liver and brain, using 
protein carbonyls and cellular levels of antioxidant enzymes as markers of 
oxidative stress. Kidney extracts from 8 days-old Bcl-2-knockout mice had 59% 
higher content of protein carbonyls relative to the wild type, but similar 
levels of oxidized proteins at the age of 30 days. By marked contrast, in liver 
and brain, levels of protein carbonyls were similar at 8 days but by 30 days the 
liver of knockout animals (and brains, as we have shown previously) show 36% 
higher protein carbonyls. Measures of glutathione reductase (GRX), glutathione 
transferase (GST) and catalase revealed significantly higher levels in kidneys 
of 8 days old Bcl-2-knockout mice compared to wild type. By 30 days activities 
of glutathione-related enzymes and catalase increased and abolished the 
differences between the knockout and wild type. At 8 days, in liver there were 
no significant differences in activities of all enzymes between the mice, 
however by 30 days, the specific activity of GRX was significantly higher in 
Bcl-2-knockout mice, relative to controls. From day 8 to day 30 there was an 
increase in liver catalase activity that resulted in significantly higher levels 
in Bcl-2-knockout animals. Catalase activity in brains of Bcl-2-knockout, 8 days 
old mice was significantly higher compared to the wild type, and significantly 
lowers at 30 days. Taken together our findings indicate that Bcl-2 knockout 
results in significant perturbations of oxidative metabolism and antioxidant 
status of in kidney, liver and brain. Such changes are tissue specific with 
respect to age, magnitude and type of enzyme affected.
