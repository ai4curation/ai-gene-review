Integral membrane proteins of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) are inserted into 
the endoplasmic reticulum membrane during their biogenesis and are then targeted 
to their final destination. We have used human SUN2 to delineate features that 
are required for INM targeting and have identified multiple elements that 
collectively contribute to the efficient localization of SUN2 to the nuclear 
envelope (NE). One such targeting element is a classical nuclear localization 
signal (cNLS) present in the N-terminal, nucleoplasmic domain of SUN2. A second 
motif proximal to the cNLS is a cluster of arginines that serves 
coatomer-mediated retrieval of SUN2 from the Golgi. Unexpectedly, also the 
C-terminal, lumenal SUN domain of SUN2 supports NE localization, showing that 
targeting elements are not limited to cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains of 
INM proteins. Together, SUN2 represents the first mammalian INM protein relying 
on a functional cNLS, a Golgi retrieval signal and a perinuclear domain to 
mediate targeting to the INM.
