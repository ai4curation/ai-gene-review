Calnexin is a 90-kDa integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER). Calnexin binds Ca2+ and may function as a chaperone in the transition of 
proteins from the ER to the outer cellular membrane. We have purified human 
calnexin in association with the human interferon-gamma receptor and cloned 
calnexin cDNA from placenta. Fragments of calnexin have been prepared as 
glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and analyzed for their abilities to 
bind 45Ca2+ and ruthenium red. A subdomain containing four internal repeats 
binds Ca2+ with the highest affinity. This sequence is highly conserved when 
compared to calreticulin (a luminal ER protein), an Onchocerca surface antigen, 
and yeast and plant calnexin homologues. Consequently, this sequence represents 
a conserved motif for the high-affinity binding of Ca2+, which is clearly 
distinct from the "E-F hand" motif. An adjacent subdomain, also highly conserved 
and containing four internal repeats, fails to bind Ca2+. The carboxyl-terminal, 
cytosolic domain is highly charged and binds Ca2+ with moderate affinity, 
presumably by electrostatic interactions. The calnexin amino-terminal domain 
(residues 1-253) also binds Ca2+, in contrast to the amino-terminal domain of 
calreticulin, which is relatively less acidic. We have also determined the cDNA 
sequences of mouse and rat calnexins. Comparison of the known mammalian calnexin 
sequences reveals very high conservation of sequence identity (93-98%), 
suggesting that calnexin performs important cellular functions. The gene for 
human calnexin is located on the distal end of the long arm of human chromosome 
5, at 5q35.
