Early embryonic arrest is a challenge for in vitro fertilization (IVF). No 
genetic factors were previously revealed in the sperm-derived arrest of 
embryonic development. Here, we reported two infertile brothers presenting 
normal in conventional semen analysis, but both couples had no embryos for 
transfer after several IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). 
Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation of ACTL7A in 
both brothers. This mutation is deleterious and causes sperm acrosomal 
ultrastructural defects. The Actl7a knock-in mouse model was generated, and male 
mutated mice showed sperm acrosomal defects, which were completely consistent 
with the observations in patients. Furthermore, the sperm from 
ACTL7A/Actl7a-mutated men and mice showed reduced expression and abnormal 
localization of PLCζ as a potential cause of embryonic arrest and failure of 
fertilization. Artificial oocyte activation could successfully overcome the 
Actl7a-mutated sperm-derived infertility, which is meaningful in the future 
practice of IVF/ICSI for the ACTL7A-associated male infertility.
