Neuronally expressed auxilin and ubiquitously expressed cyclin-G-dependent 
kinase (GAK) are homologous proteins that act as cochaperones to support the 
Hsc70-dependent clathrin uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles. GAK was 
previously shown to be essential in mouse during embryonic development and in 
the adult. We have now engineered an auxilin knockout mouse. Mutant mice had a 
high rate of early postnatal mortality and surviving pups generally had a lower 
body weight than wild-type pups, although they had a normal life span. GAK was 
up-regulated as much as 3-fold in the brains of both surviving neonates and 
adult mutant mice. An increased number of clathrin-coated vesicles and empty 
cages were present at knockout synapses both in situ and in primary neuronal 
cultures. Additionally, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles in 
knockout hippocampal neurons was impaired, most likely due to sequestration of 
coat components in assembled coats and cages. Collectively, our results 
demonstrate the specialized role of auxilin in the recycling of synaptic 
vesicles at synapses, but also show that its function can be partially 
compensated for by up-regulation of GAK.
