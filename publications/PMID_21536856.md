Ribosome biogenesis starts with transcription of the large ribosomal RNA 
precursor (47S pre-rRNA), which soon combines with numerous factors to form the 
90S pre-ribosome in the nucleolus. Although the subsequent separation of the 
pre-90S particle into pre-40S and pre-60S particles is critical for the 
production process of mature small and large ribosomal subunits, its molecular 
mechanisms remain undetermined. Here, we present evidence that p32, fibrillarin 
(FBL), and Nop52 play key roles in this separation step. Mass-based analyses 
combined with immunoblotting showed that p32 associated with 155 proteins 
including 31 rRNA-processing factors (of which nine were components of small 
subunit processome, and six were those of RIX1 complex), 13 chromatin remodeling 
components, and six general transcription factors required for RNA polymerase 
III-mediated transcription. Of these, a late rRNA-processing factor Nop52 
interacted directly with p32. Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that p32 
colocalized with an early rRNA-processing factor FBL or Nop52 in the nucleolus 
and Cajal bodies, but was excluded from the nucleolus after actinomycin D 
treatment. p32 was present in the pre-ribosomal fractions prepared by cell 
fractionation or separated by ultracentrifugation of the nuclear extract. p32 
also associated with pre-rRNAs including 47S/45S and 32S pre-rRNAs. Furthermore, 
knockdown of p32 with a small interfering RNA slowed the early processing from 
47S/45S pre-rRNAs to 18S rRNA and 32S pre-rRNA. Finally, Nop52 was found to 
compete with FBL for binding to p32 probably in the nucleolus. Given the fact 
that FBL and Nop52 are associated with pre-ribosome particles distinctly 
different from each other, we suggest that p32 is a new rRNA maturation factor 
involved in the remodeling from pre-90S particles to pre-40S and pre-60S 
particles that requires the exchange of FBL for Nop52.
