The survival motor neuron (SMN) is a spliceosomal snRNP-interacting protein that 
was initially identified as a defective molecule in spinal muscular atrophy 
(SMA). The disease severity of SMA is determined by SMN protein level. Here, we 
show that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) stabilizes SMN protein by 
inhibiting SMN poly-ubiquitination, and that the kinase activity of ASK1 is less 
important than its ability to bind to SMN. Furthermore, depletion of ASK1 by RNA 
interference revealed that ASK1 modulates neurite outgrowth by regulating SMN 
protein level in NSC34 motor neuron-like cells. Collectively, our results 
suggest that ASK1 acts as a novel binding partner of SMN and controls the 
steady-state level of SMN through complex formation with SMN in neurite 
outgrowth.
