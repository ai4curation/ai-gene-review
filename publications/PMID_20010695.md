In addition to mitochondria, BCL-2 is located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
where it is a constituent of several distinct complexes. Here, we identify the 
BCL-2-interacting protein at the ER, nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1 
(NAF-1)-a bitopic integral membrane protein whose defective expression underlies 
the aetiology of the neurodegenerative disorder Wolfram syndrome 2 (WFS2). NAF-1 
contains a two iron-two sulphur coordinating domain within its cytosolic region, 
which is necessary, but not sufficient for interaction with BCL-2. NAF-1 is 
displaced from BCL-2 by the ER-restricted BH3-only protein BIK and contributes 
to regulation of BIK-initiated autophagy, but not BIK-dependent activation of 
caspases. Similar to BCL-2, NAF-1 is found in association with the inositol 
1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and is required for BCL-2-mediated depression of ER 
Ca(2+) stores. During nutrient deprivation as a physiological stimulus of 
autophagy, BCL-2 is known to function through inhibition of the autophagy 
effector and tumour suppressor Beclin 1. NAF-1 is required in this pathway for 
BCL-2 at the ER to functionally antagonize Beclin 1-dependent autophagy. Thus, 
NAF-1 is a BCL-2-associated co-factor that targets BCL-2 for antagonism of the 
autophagy pathway at the ER.
