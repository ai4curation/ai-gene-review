The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular proliferation, 
differentiation, and apoptosis. Unregulated activation of Notch signaling can 
result in excessive cellular proliferation and cancer. Human T-cell leukemia 
virus type 1 (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). 
The disease has a dismal prognosis and is invariably fatal. In this study, we 
report a high frequency of constitutively activated Notch in ATL patients. We 
found activating mutations in Notch in more than 30% of ATL patients. These 
activating mutations are phenotypically different from those previously reported 
in T-ALL leukemias and may represent polymorphisms for activated Notch in human 
cancers. Compared with the exclusive activating frameshift mutations in the 
proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST) domain in T-ALLs, those in 
ATLs have, in addition, single-substitution mutations in this domain leading to 
reduced CDC4/Fbw7-mediated degradation and stabilization of the intracellular 
cleaved form of Notch1 (ICN1). Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of Notch 
signaling by γ-secretase inhibitors reduced tumor cell proliferation and tumor 
formation in ATL-engrafted mice. These data suggest that activated Notch may be 
important to ATL pathogenesis and reveal Notch1 as a target for therapeutic 
intervention in ATL patients.
