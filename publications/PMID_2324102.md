The structure of human syndecan, an integral membrane proteoglycan, has been 
determined by cloning its full-length cDNA, which codes for the entire 310-amino 
acid-long core protein, including the NH2-terminal signal peptide. Similar to 
mouse syndecan (Saunders, S., Jalkanen, M., O'Farrell, S., and Bernfield, M. 
(1989) J. Cell Biol. 108, 1547-1556), the core protein of human syndecan can be 
divided into three domains: a matrix-interacting ectodomain containing putative 
glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, a 25-residue hydrophobic membrane-spanning 
domain, and a 34-residue cytoplasmic domain. Several interesting conserved 
structures were revealed by comparing the human syndecan sequence to the murine 
one. (i) Although the ectodomains are only 70% identical, all putative 
glycosaminoglycan attachment sites are identical (two of them belong to the 
consensus sequence SGXG and three others to (E/D)GSG(E/D), as are also (ii) the 
single putative N-glycosylation site and (iii) the proteinase-sensitive dibasic 
RK site adjacent to the extracellular face of the transmembrane domain. 
Furthermore, (iv) the transmembrane domain is 96% identical, as the only change 
in human syndecan was an alteration of an alanine residue to glycine; and 
finally, (v) the cytoplasmic domain is 100% identical, including 3 identically 
located tyrosine residues. Comparison of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains 
to a third cell-surface proteoglycan, 48K5 from human lung fibroblasts (Marynen, 
P., Zhang, J., Cassiman, J., Vanden Berghe, H., and David, C. (1989) J. Biol. 
Chem. 264, 7017-7024), indicates that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains 
are similar also in this molecule regardless of the presence of a totally 
nonhomologous ectodomain. Thus, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are 
unique for these cell-surface proteoglycans, which we propose to be members of a 
novel gene family of syndecans.
