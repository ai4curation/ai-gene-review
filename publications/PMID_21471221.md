In response to a shortage of intracellular energy, mammalian cells reduce energy 
consumption and induce cell cycle arrest, both of which contribute to cell 
survival. Here we report that a novel nucleolar pathway involving the 
energy-dependent nucleolar silencing complex (eNoSC) and Myb-binding protein 1a 
(MYBBP1A) is implicated in these processes. Namely, in response to glucose 
starvation, eNoSC suppresses rRNA transcription, which results in a reduction in 
nucleolar RNA content. As a consequence, MYBBP1A, which is anchored to the 
nucleolus via RNA, translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. The 
translocated MYBBP1A induces acetylation and accumulation of p53 by enhancing 
the interaction between p300 and p53, which eventually leads to the cell cycle 
arrest (or apoptosis). Taken together, our results indicate that the nucleolus 
works as a sensor that transduces the intracellular energy status into the cell 
cycle machinery.

Abstract

In response to a shortage of intracellular energy, mammalian cells reduce energy consumption and induce cell cycle arrest, both of which contribute to cell survival. Here we report that a novel nucleolar pathway involving the energy-dependent nucleolar silencing complex (eNoSC) and Myb-binding protein 1a (MYBBP1A) is implicated in these processes. Namely, in response to glucose starvation, eNoSC suppresses rRNA transcription, which results in a reduction in nucleolar RNA content. As a consequence, MYBBP1A, which is anchored to the nucleolus via RNA, translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. The translocated MYBBP1A induces acetylation and accumulation of p53 by enhancing the interaction between p300 and p53, which eventually leads to the cell cycle arrest (or apoptosis). Taken together, our results indicate that the nucleolus works as a sensor that transduces the intracellular energy status into the cell cycle machinery.

Introduction

Intracellular energy balance is important for cell survival. In response to nutrient or environmental stresses that cause reduction in the intracellular energy level, mammalian cells sense the intrinsic energy status and attempt to restore bioenergetic homeostasis through compensatory changes in the regulation of intermediate metabolic processes. One such mechanism is the reduction of ribosome biosynthesis, a major biosynthetic and energy-consuming process in mammalian cells, whereas the other mechanism is the arrest of cell proliferation. The LKB1-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 3 pathway is reportedly involved in both regulatory processes ( 1 – 5 ). During energy starvation or glucose deprivation, when the cellular AMP/ATP ratio is increased, the LKB1-AMPK pathway is activated. This signaling in turn inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 S6 kinase activity that is required for rapid and sustained serum-induced ribosomal biosynthesis ( 2 ). In addition to this regulation, AMPK, which is reportedly activated in response to reduced energy level, phosphorylates and activates p53, which leads to G 1 cell cycle arrest ( 6 ). Inhibition of mTOR by AMPK and G 1 cell cycle arrest by AMPK via p53 activation suppresses energy expenditure and protects cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis ( 4 , 5 ).

On the other hand, a recent study in our laboratory revealed that glucose deprivation also reduces rRNA synthesis, which leads to down-regulation of ribosome biosynthesis in HeLa cells lacking the LKB1-AMPK pathway ( 7 ). We found that a novel nucleolar protein, nucleomethylin (NML), forms an energy-dependent nucleolar silencing complex (eNoSC) with SIRT1 and SUV39H1 and functions in this process. Our results suggest that an energy-dependent change in the NAD + /NADH ratio regulates eNoSC, allowing the complex to couple the changing energy status with the level of rRNA transcription by regulating the epigenetic status of rRNA clusters. eNoSC promotes the restoration of energy balance and protects cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis ( 7 ).

With regard to p53 activation, several lines of evidence show that apart from ribosomal biogenesis, the nucleolus has additional functions, including regulation of mitosis, cell cycle progression, and proliferation ( 8 ), and many forms of stress response such as p53 activation ( 9 – 11 ). Among them, several studies have shed light on the relationship between ribosomal biogenesis and p53 activation in response to nucleolar stress; p53 is reportedly activated by the reduction in ribosomal biogenesis through inhibition of rRNA transcription and processing ( 12 – 15 ). Inhibition of rRNA transcription by actinomycin D or TIF-IA siRNA treatment, which suppresses ribosomal biogenesis, causes disturbance of the nucleolus ( 9 , 15 – 17 ). The ribosome-induced nucleolar disturbance is thought to activate p53 by blocking proteasomal degradation via MDM2. This can be achieved by negative regulation of MDM2 by the tumor suppressor protein p19ARF or ribosomal proteins, both of which sequester MDM2, resulting in stabilization of p53 ( 18 – 20 ).

Very recently, we found that a nucleolar protein, Myb-binding protein 1a (MYBBP1A), is involved in p53 activation when ribosomal biogenesis is suppressed. MYBBP1A, which is anchored to the nucleolus through RNA, translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm when nucleolar RNA content is reduced by inhibition of rRNA transcription. The translocated MYBBP1A acetylates and accumulates p53 by facilitating the interaction between p53 and histone acetyltransferase p300 ( 27 ). Given that nutrient shortage can reduce nucleolar RNA content by suppressing rRNA transcription, MYBBP1A may cause activation of p53 that is induced by glucose deprivation.

Here we report that NML senses the energy status and reduces nucleolar RNA content by suppressing rRNA transcription in response to glucose starvation and that this leads to the translocation of MYBBP1A from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Then, MYBBP1A activates p53 by enhancing its acetylation, which is a novel pathway different from the already known LKB1-AMPK pathway. These findings indicate that NML and MYBBP1A may be the sensors in the nucleolus that connect intracellular energy status with the cell cycle machinery.

DISCUSSION

Here we have focused on the novel function of the nucleolus that converts the signal of intracellular energy shortage into activation of p53. Two nucleolar factors are involved in this regulation. The first is the NML-SITR1-SUV39H1 protein complex eNoSC that detects intracellular energy status in terms of the NAD + /NADH ratio. Upon energy shortage, indicated by an increased NAD + /NADH ratio, eNoSC is activated via its SIRT1 subunit and suppresses rRNA transcription, which eventually leads to the reduction in nucleolar RNA content. The second is MYBBP1A that is tethered to the nucleolus by binding to nucleolar RNA. MYBBP1A translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm when nucleolar RNA content is reduced. The translocated MYBBP1A enhances the acetylation and accumulation of p53 by enhancing the interaction between p53 and p300 ( 27 ). Thus, eNoSC functions as a detector and a signal transducer of the intracellular energy status, whereas MYBBP1A functions as an effector that activates p53 by enhancing its acetylation ( Fig. 6 ).

In addition to the NML-MYBBP1A pathway, the LKB1-AMPK pathway is reportedly implicated in this regulation. Namely, in response to intracellular energy shortage, the increased AMP/ATP ratio activates AMPK, which leads to suppression of ribosomal biogenesis by inhibiting mTOR/p70 S6 kinase activity ( 3 ). In addition, activated AMPK enhances phosphorylation of p53 at its Ser-15 and Ser-46 residues, leading to p53 activation ( 6 , 22 ).

The biological significance and separate roles of the NML-MYBBP1A and LKB1-AMPK pathways remain to be determined. However, these two pathways may compensate for each other, thus, improving their efficiency and reliability.

The suppression of ribosomal biogenesis or rRNA transcription by the LKB1-AMPK or NML-MYBBP1A pathways in response to energy deprivation is considered to be an adaptation mechanism that reduces energy expenditure. In addition, these pathways activate p53 under energy-starved conditions. However, the physiological relevance of p53 up-regulation upon energy starvation is enigmatic. For example, our experimental results using WI-38, a human normal fibroblast cell line, indicate that up-regulation of p53 in response to glucose starvation leads to G 1 cell cycle arrest. Thus, the NML-MYBBP1A pathway reduces the energy consumption of WI-38 by repressing ribosomal biogenesis as well as arresting the cell cycle in the G 1 phase. In contrast, our experimental results using MCF-7, a human breast tumor cell line, showed that glucose limitation induced cell death in a p53-dependent manner. The molecular basis underlying this controversy on the role of p53 on cell fate remains to be determined. Notably, the acetylation of p53 reportedly enhances sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 and recruitment of a coactivator complex to promoter regions to activate p53-target gene expression ( 24 , 25 ). The functional consequences of p53 acetylation suggest that the strength of acetylation may determine p53 regulation and cell fate. The activation of genes involved in cell cycle control requires partial acetylation, whereas the activation of proapoptotic genes requires full activation of p53 ( 26 ). Furthermore, we found that the amount of MYBBP1A in the normal cell line is less than that in the cancer cell line (data not shown). The differences in cell fate due to activation of p53 between cell lines ( e.g. normal cells versus tumor cells) may be explained by the difference in the expression levels of MYBBP1A.
