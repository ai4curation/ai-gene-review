Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are highly conserved for efficient and precise 
translation of genetic codes. In higher eukaryotic systems, several different 
ARSs including glutamyl-prolyl-, isoelucyl-, leucyl-, methionyl-, glutaminyl-, 
lysyl-, arginyl-, and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase form a macromolecular protein 
complex with three nonenzymatic cofactors (AIMP1/p43, AIMP2/p38, and AIMP3/p18). 
Although the structure and functional implications for this complex formation 
are not completely understood, rapidly accumulating evidences suggest that this 
complex would work as a molecular hub linked to the multiple signaling pathways 
that involve the components of enzymes and cofactors. In this article, the roles 
of three nonenzymatic components of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex in the 
assembly of the components and in cell regulation are addressed.
