Constitutional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SPRED1 gene cause 
a phenotype known as Legius syndrome, which consists of symptoms of multiple 
café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, learning disabilities, and 
macrocephaly. Legius syndrome resembles a mild neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) 
phenotype. It has been demonstrated that SPRED1 functions as a negative 
regulator of the Ras-ERK pathway and interacts with neurofibromin, the NF1 gene 
product. However, the molecular details of this interaction and the effects of 
the mutations identified in Legius syndrome and NF1 on this interaction have not 
yet been investigated. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid system and an 
immunoprecipitation assay in HEK293 cells, we found that the SPRED1 EVH1 domain 
interacts with the N-terminal 16 amino acids and the C-terminal 20 amino acids 
of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) of neurofibromin, 
which form two crossing α-helix coils outside the GAP domain. These regions have 
been shown to be dispensable for GAP activity and are not present in p120(GAP). 
Several mutations in these N- and C-terminal regions of the GRD in NF1 patients 
and pathogenic missense mutations in the EVH1 domain of SPRED1 in Legius 
syndrome reduced the binding affinity between the EVH1 domain and the GRD. EVH1 
domain mutations with reduced binding to the GRD also disrupted the ERK 
suppression activity of SPRED1. These data clearly demonstrate that SPRED1 
inhibits the Ras-ERK pathway by recruiting neurofibromin to Ras through the 
EVH1-GRD interaction, and this study also provides molecular basis for the 
pathogenic mutations of NF1 and Legius syndrome.

Abstract

Constitutional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the SPRED1 gene cause a phenotype known as Legius syndrome, which consists of symptoms of multiple café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, learning disabilities, and macrocephaly. Legius syndrome resembles a mild neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) phenotype. It has been demonstrated that SPRED1 functions as a negative regulator of the Ras-ERK pathway and interacts with neurofibromin, the NF1 gene product. However, the molecular details of this interaction and the effects of the mutations identified in Legius syndrome and NF1 on this interaction have not yet been investigated. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid system and an immunoprecipitation assay in HEK293 cells, we found that the SPRED1 EVH1 domain interacts with the N-terminal 16 amino acids and the C-terminal 20 amino acids of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) of neurofibromin, which form two crossing α-helix coils outside the GAP domain. These regions have been shown to be dispensable for GAP activity and are not present in p120 GAP . Several mutations in these N- and C-terminal regions of the GRD in NF1 patients and pathogenic missense mutations in the EVH1 domain of SPRED1 in Legius syndrome reduced the binding affinity between the EVH1 domain and the GRD. EVH1 domain mutations with reduced binding to the GRD also disrupted the ERK suppression activity of SPRED1. These data clearly demonstrate that SPRED1 inhibits the Ras-ERK pathway by recruiting neurofibromin to Ras through the EVH1-GRD interaction, and this study also provides molecular basis for the pathogenic mutations of NF1 and Legius syndrome.

Introduction

Spred (Sprouty-related protein with an EVH1 domain) family proteins, initially discovered as c-Kit- and c-Fms-binding proteins, have been shown to suppress the Ras-ERK pathway. Spreds form a subfamily of the Sprouty/Spred family, which is characterized by the Sprouty-related C-terminal cysteine-rich (SPR) 3 domain. In mammals, four Sprouty homologues and three members of the Spred family of proteins, Spred1, Spred2, and Spred3, have been discovered. Mammalian Spreds can negatively regulate the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway ( 1 , 2 ); however, compared with Spred1 and Spred2, Spred3 has much weaker ERK suppression activity ( 3 ). The SPR domain has been shown to be palmitoylated, causing Sprouty and Spred to localize in the membrane fraction ( 4 , 5 ). Spred1 and Spred2 are composed of an N-terminal enabled/vasodilator-stimulated protein homology 1 (EVH1) domain, a central c-Kit-binding domain, and a cysteine-rich C-terminal SPR domain, whereas Spred3 lacks a functional c-Kit-binding domain.

Germline loss-of-function mutations in the SPRED1 gene have been identified in patients fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria from the National Institutes of Health for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) where no NF1 mutation could be identified. SPRED1 mutations account for at least 2% of the pathogenic mutations in patients clinically diagnosed with NF1 ( 6 – 11 ). The phenotype exhibited by such patients is known as NF1-like syndrome or Legius syndrome (OMIM 611431) and consists of multiple café-au-lait macules (CALM), axillary freckling, macrocephaly, and sometimes mild neurocognitive impairment, as well as a lack of certain features that are common in NF1, such as neurofibromas, iris Lisch nodules, and NF1-related malignancies ( 11 ). However, there might be an increased risk for leukemia in children with Legius syndrome ( 12 ). The similarities between NF1 and Legius syndrome, as well as that between the biochemical functions of neurofibromin and those of SPRED1, suggest that these two syndromes both result in part from hyperactive Ras-ERK signaling, as are Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with lentigines (previous LEOPARD syndrome), cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Costello syndrome ( 13 ). Furthermore, Spreds are putative tumor suppressors. It has been reported that SPRED1 and SPRED2 expression is reduced in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( 14 ), and SPRED1 mutation and reduced expression are also found in acute myeloblastic leukemia ( 12 ). Overexpression of SPRD1 in tumor cells resulted in reduced tumorigenicity in nude mice ( 15 ). Moreover, the bi-allelic inactivation of SPRED1 has been demonstrated in melanocytes cultured from a café-au-lait macule in a patient with Legius syndrome ( 8 ).

It was revealed that the C-terminal deletion mutant of Spred1 functions as a dominant negative form against endogenous Spred1 and augments serum and nerve growth factor-induced ERK activation, suggesting that the EVH1 domain binds to a factor necessary for Ras inhibition ( 16 , 17 ). However, despite lengthy and extensive screening, no binding partner of the EVH1 domain has been found so far. Recently, a molecular link between neurofibromin and SPRED1 was discovered. Stowe et al. ( 18 ) demonstrated that the SPRED1 protein binds to neurofibromin, the NF1 gene product, resulting in the plasma membrane localization of neurofibromin, which subsequently down-regulates Ras-GTP levels. This model explains why Legius syndrome resembles NF1 and how SPREDs suppress the Ras-ERK pathway. However, the molecular details of the Spred-neurofibromin interaction and the effects of mutations in SPRED1 and NF1 remain to be clarified. In this study, we found that the SPRED1 EVH1 domain interacts with the N- and C-terminal extended region of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) of neurofibromin. Some mutations in these N- and C-terminal regions of the GRD identified in NF1 patients reduced the binding of the GRD to the EVH1 domain. Furthermore, SPRED1 EVH1 mutations lost the ability to bind to the GRD, leading to reduced ERK suppression activity. Our data provide molecular details on the function of the EVH1 domain and the GRD, which contributes to the pathogenesis of NF1 and Legius syndrome features and the potential development of Ras pathway inhibitors for cancer therapy.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that the SPRED EVH1 domain interacts with the N- and C-terminal extended regions of the GRD of neurofibromin, which is essential for the function of SPREDs as well as neurofibromin. Most pathogenic and likely pathogenic missense mutations in EVH1 found in Legius syndrome and some NF1 GRD pathogenic missense mutations from NF1 patients severely disrupt this interaction and reduce suppression activity against the Ras-ERK pathway. Using the data on the severely reduced EVH1-GRD binding in this work, we could potentially “upgrade” the classification of three NF1 missense mutations of uncertain significance to likely pathogenic mutations (p.Arg1204Leu, p.Arg1204Trp, and p.Leu1208Trp) and of three likely pathogenic mutations to pathogenic mutations (p.Met1215del, p.Asp1217Gly, and p.Leu1511Pro).

Overall, there is a strong correlation among pathogenic mutations, disruption of the EVH1-GRD interaction, and ERK suppression activity. The likely pathogenic SPRED1 missense mutations G30R, W31L, G62R, T88K, W92R, G100D, T102R, and T102K in the EVH1 domain showed a severely reduced binding affinity to the GRD, whereas the three benign mutations and one mutation of uncertain significance (D9V, N10K, V42I, and C74F) did not affect binding to the GRD. Thus, the effect of the EVH1 missense mutations on the EVH1-GRD interaction explains the pathogenetic mechanism. However, some SPRED1 mutations (R24Q, L80R, and T102M), especially R24Q, have only a modest effect on the GRD interaction, but they clearly are associated with a Legius syndrome phenotype with café-au-lait macules in three generations. In addition, we cannot explain at the moment why variant of uncertain significance I116N has a low EVH1-GRD interaction index but a relatively high ERK suppression index. Further study is necessary to define the pathogenetic mechanism of these mutations.

The overlapping phenotypes between NF1 and Legius syndrome are explained by the model proposed by Stowe et al. ( 18 ), i.e. SPREDs recruit neurofibromin to the Ras-enriched cell membrane. Because there are three functionally overlapping SPREDs in humans, the relatively benign phenotype of Legius syndrome can be explained by SPRED2/3 activity compensating for SPRED1 mutations in most cell types. It is notable that the EVH1 domains of mSpred1 and mSpred2 have similar GRD binding affinity and similar ERK suppression activity. Physiological redundancy of Spred1 and Spred2 was confirmed by gene-disruption studies in which Spred1/2 double KO mice were embryonically lethal, and Spred1 and Spred2 single KO mice were viable ( 15 ).

In conclusion, pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations in the EVH1 domain of SPRED1 cause loss of binding affinity to neurofibromin GRD, and our yeast two-hybrid assay correlates excellently with the Ras-ERK suppression activity of SPRED1. The information obtained in this study will be helpful for the classification of missense mutations in Legius syndrome and NF1. This unique EVH1-GRD interaction may also be useful in the development of agents that could induce Ras inactivation in cancer.
