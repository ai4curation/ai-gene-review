The nervous system-specific leucine-rich repeat Ig-containing protein LINGO-1 is 
associated with the Nogo-66 receptor complex and is endowed with a canonical EGF

LINGO-1 expression is elevated in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease 
(PD) patients compared with age-matched controls and in animal models of PD 
after neurotoxic lesions. LINGO-1 expression is present in midbrain dopaminergic 
(DA) neurons in the human and rodent brain. Therefore, the role of LINGO-1 in 
cell damage responses of DA neurons was examined in vitro and in experimental

(N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) toxicity. In LINGO-1 knockout 
mice, DA neuron survival was increased and behavioral abnormalities were reduced 
compared with WT. This neuroprotection was accompanied by increased Akt 
phosphorylation (p-Akt). Similar neuroprotective in vivo effects on midbrain DA 
neurons were obtained in WT mice by blocking LINGO-1 activity using LINGO-1-Fc 
protein. Neuroprotection and enhanced neurite growth were also demonstrated for 
midbrain DA neurons in vitro. LINGO-1 antagonists (LINGO-1-Fc, dominant negative 
LINGO-1, and anti-LINGO-1 antibody) improved DA neuron survival in response to 
MPP+ in part by mechanisms that involve activation of the EGFR/Akt signaling 
pathway through a direct inhibition of LINGO-1's binding to EGFR. These results 
show that inhibitory agents of LINGO-1 activity can protect DA neurons against 
degeneration and indicate a role for the leucine-rich repeat protein LINGO-1 and 
related classes of proteins in the pathophysiological responses of midbrain DA 
neurons in PD.

Abstract

The nervous system-specific leucine-rich repeat Ig-containing protein LINGO-1 is associated with the Nogo-66 receptor complex and is endowed with a canonical EGF receptor (EGFR)-like tyrosine phosphorylation site. Our studies indicate that LINGO-1 expression is elevated in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients compared with age-matched controls and in animal models of PD after neurotoxic lesions. LINGO-1 expression is present in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the human and rodent brain. Therefore, the role of LINGO-1 in cell damage responses of DA neurons was examined in vitro and in experimental models of PD induced by either oxidative (6-hydroxydopamine) or mitochondrial ( N -methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) toxicity. In LINGO-1 knockout mice, DA neuron survival was increased and behavioral abnormalities were reduced compared with WT. This neuroprotection was accompanied by increased Akt phosphorylation ( p -Akt). Similar neuroprotective in vivo effects on midbrain DA neurons were obtained in WT mice by blocking LINGO-1 activity using LINGO-1-Fc protein. Neuroprotection and enhanced neurite growth were also demonstrated for midbrain DA neurons in vitro . LINGO-1 antagonists (LINGO-1-Fc, dominant negative LINGO-1, and anti-LINGO-1 antibody) improved DA neuron survival in response to MPP + in part by mechanisms that involve activation of the EGFR/Akt signaling pathway through a direct inhibition of LINGO-1's binding to EGFR. These results show that inhibitory agents of LINGO-1 activity can protect DA neurons against degeneration and indicate a role for the leucine-rich repeat protein LINGO-1 and related classes of proteins in the pathophysiological responses of midbrain DA neurons in PD.

Discussion

These results demonstrate that midbrain DA neurons can be protected in vivo and in vitro against parkinsonism-inducing agents by independent methods of inhibiting endogenous brain LINGO-1, including ( i ) an antibody against LINGO-1, ( ii ) LINGO-1 KO mice, ( iii ) DN-LINGO-1 transduction, or ( iv ) the addition of LINGO-1-Fc protein. The experiments also demonstrate that the endogenous LINGO-1 effects involve the activation of the EGFR/Akt intracellular signaling pathways. Finally, we believe that our findings may be particularly relevant, because another protein in the LRR family, LRRK2, has recently been genetically linked to PD ( 11 , 12 ). Endogenous LRRK2, like LINGO-1, appears to function as a growth inhibitor of neurites and to be involved in the structural plasticity and integrity of the DA neurons ( 13 ).

How does LINGO-1 regulate DA neurite outgrowth? LINGO-1 is a coreceptor of NogoR1 and p75NTR or TROY and can inhibit neurite growth in dorsal root ganglion and cerebellar granular neurons in the presence of myelin-associated inhibitor(s) ( 9 , 10 ). In such neurons, LINGO-1 normally inhibits process elongation and axonal growth. LINGO-1-Fc reverses the inhibitory properties of endogenous LINGO-1, and LINGO-1-Fc promotes axonal outgrowth by antagonizing the Nogo-R signaling pathway ( 9 , 10 ). Interestingly, our studies of LINGO-1-mediated intracellular signaling demonstrated that inhibiting LINGO-1 activities increased EGFR and p -Akt levels in the absence of myelin-associated inhibitor(s). Such data show that LINGO-1 can reduce EGFR expression, indicating that endogenous LINGO-1 may be a negative regulator of the EGFR/Akt signaling pathways. However, it is not clear how LINGO-1 inhibits EGFR expression and function. We propose that LINGO-1 may regulate EGFR signaling pathways by accelerating EGFR internalization and degradation, thus decreasing the availability of EGFR, or that LINGO-1 directly inhibits EGFR phosphorylation and thereby reduces PI3-K/Akt signaling activity (see SI Fig. 10 ). Previous ( 9 ) and present data demonstrate that LINGO-1 is up-regulated after neuronal damage or cell death in vivo , suggesting that LINGO-1 participates in pathophysiological responses. EGFR has multiple ligands including EGF, TGF-α, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, and amphiregulin ( 25 ). Significantly, TGF-α mutant mice exhibit significant reductions in SNc DA neurons ( 19 ). Furthermore, EGF and EGFR protein levels are significantly decreased in the striatum of PD patients ( 2 ), and EGF treatment has been shown to protect DA neurons in primary VM cultures and animal models of PD ( 2 , 4 , 26 – 28 ). Familial PD can be caused by mutant dysfunctional parkin (PARK2 in PD gene classification), and normal parkin ( 29 , 30 ) can delay EGFR internalization and degradation and promote PI3-K/Akt signaling ( 31 ). Intracellular signaling of EGFR is mediated by the PI3-K pathway ( 21 ), which increases phosphorylation and activation of Akt ( p -Akt) ( 24 ). Growth factor-activated PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways have been previously documented to enhance neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. The mechanisms are complex and involve regulation of cytoplasmic cell death machinery, genes in cell death and survival, and metabolic pathways associated with cell survival ( 1 , 22 , 23 , 32 ). Furthermore, overexpression of p -Akt in the SNc DA neurons provides potent protection against 6-OHDA-induced cellular damages and function of DA neurons ( 23 ), consistent with our neuroprotection data. In addition to EGFR, inhibition of LINGO-1 may reduce p75 NTR activity that has been linked to cell death ( 33 ). Because LINGO-1 is also expressed by non-DA cells, those cells may also have positive influences on the DA neuronal function when LINGO-1 activity is inhibited. It has also been shown that LINGO-1 activates RhoA-GTP. Such RhoA activation can by itself cause cell death ( 34 ), thus providing another alternative mechanism for LINGO-1-associated cellular demise and dysfunction, because LINGO-1 antagonists can reduce RhoA ( 9 , 18 ). The current experiments revealed that inhibition of endogenous LINGO-1 (by DN-LINGO-1 or LINGO-Fc protein) stimulated neurite extension of DA neurons cultured in vitro in the absence of myelin inhibitors. Given that FL-LINGO-1 overexpression did not by itself inhibit neurite growth, this indicates that the LINGO-1 inhibitory system is saturated at baseline or that other molecular partners are required to further block neurite growth.

It is of utmost importance to find treatments that reduce neuronal degeneration and maintain neuronal pathways and physiological circuits in PD. Using in vivo and in vitro PD models, this work demonstrates that LINGO-1 can be part of the injury response of DA neurons. Inhibition of endogenous LINGO-1 exerted neuroprotective and neurite growth-stimulating effects on the DA neurons that typically degenerate in PD. In a PD lesion animal model, LINGO-1 was also regionally elevated after 6-OHDA induced DA neuronal degeneration. Preliminary data also indicate that LINGO-1 is up-regulated in the brains of human PD cases. These LINGO-1 findings, combined with recent data showing the related LRRK2 protein's physiological role ( 13 ) and genetic link to PD ( 11 , 12 ), demonstrate that LRR protein family members can play critical roles in the structural and functional integrity of neurons involved in neurodegenerative diseases. LINGO-1 and related functional proteins may therefore become useful targets for developing new treatments.
