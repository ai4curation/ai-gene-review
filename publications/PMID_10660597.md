Beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs), like other G-protein-coupled receptors, 
can undergo post-transciptional regulation at the level of mRNA stability. In 
particular, the human beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs and the hamster beta(2)-AR mRNA 
undergo beta-agonist-mediated destabilization. By UV cross-linking, we have 
previously described an approximately M(r) 36,000 mRNA-binding protein, betaARB, 
that binds to A/C+U-rich nucleotide regions within 3'-untranslated regions. 
Further, we have demonstrated previously that betaARB is immunologically 
distinct from AUF1/heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) D, another 
mRNA-binding protein associated with destabilization of A+U-rich mRNAs (Pende, 
A., Tremmel, K. D., DeMaria, C. T., Blaxall, B. C., Minobe, W., Sherman, J. A., 
Bisognano, J., Bristow, M. R., Brewer, G., and Port, J. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 
271, 8493-8501). In this report, we describe the peptide composition of betaARB. 
Mass spectrometric analysis of an approximately M(r) 36,000 band isolated from 
ribosomal salt wash proteins revealed the presence of two mRNA-binding proteins, 
hnRNP A1, and the elav-like protein, HuR, both of which are known to bind to 
A+U-rich nucleotide regions. By immunoprecipitation, HuR appears to be the 
biologically dominant RNA binding component of betaARB. Although hnRNP A1 and 
HuR can both be immunoprecipitated from ribosomal salt wash proteins, the 
composition of betaARB (HuR alone versus HuR and hnRNP A1) appears to be 
dependent on the mRNA probe used. The exact role of HuR and hnRNP A1 in the 
regulation of beta-AR mRNA stability remains to be determined.
