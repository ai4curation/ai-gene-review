A variety of cellular stresses activate the stress-responsive mitogen-activated 
protein (MAP) kinases p38 and JNK. In this study, we studied the activation 
mechanism of a human MAP kinase kinase kinase, MTK1 (also known as MEKK4), which 
mediates activation of both p38 and JNK. MTK1 has an extensive N-terminal 
noncatalytic domain composed of approximately 1,300 amino acids. Full-length or 
near full-length MTK1 is catalytically inactive when expressed in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae cells, as it is in mammalian cells. Deletion of a segment including 
positions 253 to 553 activates kinase, indicating that this segment contains the 
autoinhibitory domain. In the autoinhibited conformation, the MTK1 kinase domain 
cannot interact with its substrate, MKK6. By a functional complementation 
screening with yeast cells, GADD45 proteins (GADD45alpha, beta, and gamma) were 
identified as MTK1 activators. GADD45 proteins bind a site in MTK1 near the 
inhibitory domain and relieve autoinhibition. Mutants of full-length MTK1 were 
isolated that can interact with MKK6 in the absence of the activator GADD45 
proteins. These MTK1 mutants are constitutively active, in both yeast and 
mammalian cells. A model of MTK1 autoinhibition by the N-terminal inhibitory 
domain and activation by GADD45 binding is presented.

Abstract

A variety of cellular stresses activate the stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases p38 and JNK. In this study, we studied the activation mechanism of a human MAP kinase kinase kinase, MTK1 (also known as MEKK4), which mediates activation of both p38 and JNK. MTK1 has an extensive N-terminal noncatalytic domain composed of ∼1,300 amino acids. Full-length or near full-length MTK1 is catalytically inactive when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, as it is in mammalian cells. Deletion of a segment including positions 253 to 553 activates kinase, indicating that this segment contains the autoinhibitory domain. In the autoinhibited conformation, the MTK1 kinase domain cannot interact with its substrate, MKK6. By a functional complementation screening with yeast cells, GADD45 proteins (GADD45α, β, and γ) were identified as MTK1 activators. GADD45 proteins bind a site in MTK1 near the inhibitory domain and relieve autoinhibition. Mutants of full-length MTK1 were isolated that can interact with MKK6 in the absence of the activator GADD45 proteins. These MTK1 mutants are constitutively active, in both yeast and mammalian cells. A model of MTK1 autoinhibition by the N-terminal inhibitory domain and activation by GADD45 binding is presented.

DISCUSSION

In this paper, we characterized the regulatory mechanism of the MTK1 MAPKKK. The main conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows: (i) the MTK1 N-terminal region contains an autoinhibitory domain that interacts with the C-terminal kinase domain, inhibits kinase activity, and prevents interaction with its substrate, MKK6, (ii) GADD45 proteins are MTK1 activators, and (iii) the binding of GADD45 to the N-terminal region of MTK1 eliminates inhibition of the kinase domain by the autoinhibitory domain. The isolation of constitutively active MTK1 mutants, many of which are located in the noncatalytic domain, further supports these conclusions. A speculative model of MTK1 activation by the GADD45 protein, based on these observations, is depicted in Fig. 10 .

GADD45 proteins (GADD45α, β, and γ) were previously identified as MTK1 activators by using the two-hybrid screening strategy ( 37 ). It was also shown that GADD45 proteins bound and activated the full-length MTK1 in transfected mammalian cells as well as in an in vitro assay system ( 37 ). In this study, we added another line of evidence that GADD45 proteins are specific activators of MTK1. The function-based screening strategy employed in this study is entirely different, and more stringent, than the two-hybrid screening used in the earlier study; the functional screening method requires not only the protein-protein interaction but also the activation of the MTK1 kinase. The fact that we did not find any genes other than GADD45 in our functional screening may attest to its specificity. These results, however, do not preclude the presence of an alternative MTK1 activation mechanism(s). It is possible, for example, that GADD45 may simply be the most abundant activator in HeLa and Jurkat cells.

GADD45α was initially identified as a gene whose mRNA is rapidly induced by agents that cause DNA damage (UV, N -acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, methyl methanesulfonate, and H 2 O 2 ) ( 13 , 14 , 27 ). GADD45β and GADD45γ mRNA expression is also induced by various stress stimuli as well as by cytokines ( 37 , 44 ). The role of the GADD45 proteins in the p38 and JNK pathways, however, was disputed by others based on several lines of evidence: unimpaired activation of p38 and JNK kinases in GADD45α-deficient mice, different time courses between p38/JNK activation and GADD45 expression, and the absence of an effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( 34 , 40 ). Beside the fact that these studies used mutant mice with only the GADD45α gene deleted, their objections seem to reflect a tacit assumption that there should be only one mechanism to activate JNK/p38 for each external stimulus. Considering the fact that there are more than 10 different MAPKKKs that act upstream of the p38 and JNK kinases, it is more likely that several MAPKKKs, activated by different molecular mechanisms, contribute to JNK/p38 responses. Furthermore, there is now more direct evidence that GADD45 proteins, especially GADD45β and GADD45γ, serve crucial roles in p38 activation in T lymphocytes. It was found, by using gene knockout mice, that gamma interferon production in T helper type 1 (Th1) cells is dependent on the induction of the GADD45β or GADD45γ gene and on the resulting activation of the p38 MAPK ( 21 , 44 ). Clearly, specific roles of individual MAPKKKs, as well as those of their activators, need to be studied further for a better understanding of their physiological significance.

Using a novel screening procedure, we isolated 11 MTK1 mutants that are constitutively active. These mutations are clustered in four regions, which are designated A1, A2, B1, and B2 (Fig. 6 ). Since no structural information is available for the N-terminal region of MTK1 or its homologs, it is premature to speculate on the structural consequences of the mutations in the regions A1, A2, and B1. Nonetheless, the presence of mutations in the N-terminal noncatalytic domain that influence the interactive properties of the C-terminal kinase domain compels us to conclude that a direct interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains must take place. In fact, our two-hybrid analyses (Fig. 9 ) indicated that an interaction between the MTK1 N- and C-terminal regions does occur. Interestingly, the mutations in regions A1 and B1 significantly weakened such an interaction, indicating that these regions have dominant roles in the N-C interaction. It is even possible that the A1 and B1 regions interact with each other, although there is no direct evidence. These regions, however, may not be directly involved in the kinase inhibition because mutants in these regions have relatively weak kinase activities (Fig. 8B ). As graphically suggested in Fig. 10B , the strong A1-B1 interaction may aid the weaker, but inhibitory, interaction between the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain and the C-terminal kinase domain.

Because the two mutations in region B2, I1360M and M1414I, are within the conserved kinase domain, their locations can be predicted by using the crystallographic structures of similar protein kinases. Thus, it is predicted that these sites are both exposed on the external surface of the kinase N lobe (Fig. 6B ). It is of interest that MTK1 Ile1360 is at the position corresponding to CDK4 Arg24, where mutations are known to exist that inhibit the binding of its inhibitor protein, p16 INK4a ( 10 , 41 ). By analogy, it is possible that the region B2 sites directly interact with the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. A binding of the GADD45 protein to the GADD45-binding site near the autoinhibitory domain will interfere in the autoinhibitory interaction between the MTK1 N and C termini, leading to MKK6 binding and its activation by phosphorylation (Fig. 10B ).
