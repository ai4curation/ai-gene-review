Adherens junction (AJ) is a specialized cell-cell junction structure that plays 
a role in mechanically connecting adjacent cells to resist strong contractile 
forces and to maintain tissue structure, particularly in the epithelium. AJ is 
mainly comprised of cell adhesion molecules cadherin and nectin and their 
associating cytoplasmic proteins including β-catenin, α-catenin, p120(ctn), and 
afadin. Our series of studies have revealed that nectin first forms cell-cell 
adhesion and then recruits cadherin to form AJ. The recruitment of cadherin by 
nectin is mediated by the binding of α-catenin and p120(ctn) to afadin. Recent 
studies showed that PLEKHA7 binds to p120(ctn), which is associated with 
E-cadherin, and maintains the integrity of AJ in epithelial cells. In this 
study, we showed that PLEKHA7 bound to afadin in addition to p120(ctn) and was 
recruited to the nectin-3α-based cell-cell adhesion site in a manner dependent 
on afadin, but not on p120(ctn). The binding of PLEKHA7 to afadin was required 
for the proper formation of AJ, but not for the formation of tight junction, in 
EpH4 mouse mammary gland epithelial cells. These results indicate that PLEKHA7 
plays a cooperative role with nectin and afadin in the proper formation of AJ in 
epithelial cells.
