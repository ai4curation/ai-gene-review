The tubby gene family consists of four members, TUB, TULP1, TULP2 and TULP3, 
with unknown function. However, a splice junction mutation within the mouse tub 
gene leads to retinal and cochlear degeneration, as well as maturity onset 
obesity and insulin resistance. Mutations within human TULP1 have also been 
shown to co-segregate in several cases of autosomal recessive retinitis 
pigmentosa (RP) and TULP1 deficiency in mice leads to retinal degeneration. The 
primary amino acid sequences of the tubby family members do not predict a likely 
biochemical function. As a first step in defining their function, we present a 
detailed characterization of the cellular and subcellular localization of the 
human (TUB) and mouse (tub) homologous gene products. We report the isolation of 
TUB splice variants which have different subcellular localizations (nuclear 
versus cytoplasmic) and which define a nuclear localization signal. In addition, 
using green fluorescent protein (GFP) tags, we observe a nuclear localization 
for TULP1, similar to TUB splicing forms TUB 561 and TUB 506. Finally, we report 
tubby expression in mouse brain by in situ hybridization and by 
immunohistochemistry with polyclonal antibodies. Protein was found in both the 
hypothalamic satiety centers and in a variety of other CNS structures including 
the cortex, cerebellum, olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Both nuclear and 
cytoplasmic signals were detected with a series of independently generated 
polyclonal antibodies, consistent with the presence of multiple alternatively 
spliced isoforms within the CNS.
