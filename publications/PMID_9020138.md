The Crk-associated substrate p130(Cas) (Cas) and the recently described human 
enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1) are two proteins with similar structure (64% 
amino acid homology), which are thought to act as "docking" molecules in 
intracellular signaling cascades. Both proteins contain an N-terminal Src 
homology (SH), three domain and a cluster of SH2 binding motifs. Here we show 
that ligation of either beta1 integrin or B cell antigen receptor (BCR) on human 
tonsillar B cells and B cell lines promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of HEF1. In 
contrast, Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in certain B cell lines but 
not in tonsillar B cells, indicating a more general role for HEF1 in B cell 
signaling. Interestingly, pretreatment of tonsillar B cells with cytochalasin B 
dramatically reduced both integrin- and BCR-induced HEF1 phosphorylation, 
suggesting that some component of the BCR-mediated signaling pathway is closely 
linked with a cytoskeletal reorganization. Both HEF1 and Cas were found to 
complex with the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), and when 
tyrosine phosphorylated, with the adapter molecule CrkL. In addition, the two 
molecules were detected in p53/56(Lyn) immunoprecipitates, and Lyn kinase was 
found to specifically bind the C-terminal proline-rich sequence of Cas in an in 
vitro binding assay. These associations implicate HEF1 and Cas as important 
components in a cytoskeleton-linked signaling pathway initiated by ligation of 
beta1 integrin or BCR on human B cells.
