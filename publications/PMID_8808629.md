The initiation of intracellular signaling events through the 55 kDa tumor 
necrosis factor-receptor (TNF-R55) appears to depend on protein intermediates 
that interact with specific cytoplasmic domains of TNF-R55. By combined use of 
the yeast interaction trap system and a peptide scanning library, the novel 
WD-repeat protein FAN has been identified, which specifically binds to a 
cytoplasmic nine amino acid binding motif of TNF-R55. This region has been 
previously recognized as a distinct functional domain that is both required and 
sufficient for the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase). 
Overexpression of full-length FAN enhanced N-SMase activity in TNF-treated 
cells, while truncated mutants of FAN produced dominant negative effects. The 
data suggest that FAN regulates ceramide production by N-SMase, which is a 
crucial step in TNF signaling.
