AIMS: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression 
at the post-transcriptional level by either degradation or translational 
repression of a target mRNA. Encoded in the genome of most eukaryotes, miRNAs 
have been proposed to regulate specifically up to 90% of human genes through a 
process known as miRNA-guided RNA silencing. For the first time, we sought to 
test how myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) changes miR expression.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Following 2 and 7 h of IR or sham operation, myocardial 
tissue was collected and subjected to miRNA expression profiling and 
quantification using a Bioarray system that screens for human-, mice-, rat-, and 
Ambi-miR. Data mining and differential analyses resulted in 13 miRs that were 
up-regulated on day 2, 9 miRs that were up-regulated on day 7, and 6 miRs that 
were down-regulated on day 7 post-IR. Results randomly selected from expression 
profiling were validated using real-time PCR. Tissue elements laser-captured 
from the infarct site showed marked induction of miR-21. In situ hybridization 
studies using locked nucleic acid miR-21-specific probe identified that 
IR-inducible miR-21 was specifically localized in the infarct region of the IR 
heart. Immunohistochemistry data show that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the 
major cell type in the infarct zone. Studies with isolated CFs demonstrated that 
phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is a direct target of miR-21. Modulation 
of miR-21 regulated expression of matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) via a PTEN 
pathway. Finally, we noted a marked decrease in PTEN expression in the infarct 
zone. This decrease was associated with increased MMP-2 expression in the 
infarct area.
CONCLUSION: This work constitutes the first report describing changes in miR 
expression in response to IR in the mouse heart, showing that miR-21 regulates 
MMP-2 expression in CFs of the infarct zone via a PTEN pathway.
