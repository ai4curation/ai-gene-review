Defects in complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are a rare cause of 
mitochondrial disorders. Underlying autosomal-recessive genetic defects are 
found in most of the 'SDHx' genes encoding complex II (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and 
SDHD) and its assembly factors. Interestingly, SDHx genes also function as tumor 
suppressor genes in hereditary paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, and 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In these cases, the affected patients are 
carrier of a heterozygeous SDHx germline mutation. Until now, mutations in SDHx 
associated with mitochondrial disease have not been reported in association with 
hereditary tumors and vice versa. Here, we characterize four patients with 
isolated complex II deficiency caused by mutations in SDHA presenting with 
multisystem mitochondrial disease including Leigh syndrome (LS) and/or 
leukodystrophy. Molecular genetic analysis revealed three novel mutations in 
SDHA. Two mutations (c.64-2A>G and c.1065-3C>A) affect mRNA splicing and result 
in loss of protein expression. These are the first mutations described affecting 
SDHA splicing. For the third new mutation, c.565T>G, we show that it severely 
affects enzyme activity. Its pathogenicity was confirmed by lentiviral 
complementation experiments on the fibroblasts of patients carrying this 
mutation. It is of special interest that one of our LS patients harbored the 
c.91C>T (p.Arg31*) mutation that was previously only reported in association 
with paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, tightening the gap between these two 
rare disorders. As tumor screening is recommended for SDHx mutation carriers, 
this should also be considered for patients with mitochondrial disorders and 
their family members.
