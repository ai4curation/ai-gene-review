Augmentation of superoxide levels has been linked to impaired relaxation in 
hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia. Purified endothelial nitric 
oxide synthase (eNOS) generates superoxide under limited availability of 
5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). Thus alterations in endothelial BH(4) 
levels have been postulated to stimulate superoxide production from eNOS. This 
possibility was examined by determining the concentration-dependent effects of 
BH(4), and its analogues, on superoxide formation by eNOS. Superoxide was 
quantified by EPR spin trapping, which is the only available technique to 
quantify superoxide from eNOS. Using 5-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-pyrroline 
N-oxide, we show that only fully reduced BH(4) diminished superoxide release 
from eNOS, with efficiency BH(4)>6-methyl-BH(4)>5-methyl-BH(4). In contrast, 
partially oxidized BH(4) analogues, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (7,8-BH(2)) and 
sepiapterin had no effect. Neither l-arginine nor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl 
ester (l-NAME) abolished superoxide formation. Together, BH(4) and l-arginine 
stimulated .NO production at maximal rates of 148 nmol/min per mg of protein. 
These results indicate that BH(4) acts as a "redox switch", decreasing 
superoxide release and enhancing .NO formation. This role was verified by adding 
7,8-BH(2) or sepiapterin to fully active eNOS. Both 7,8-BH(2) and sepiapterin 
enhanced superoxide release while inhibiting (.)NO formation. Collectively, 
these results indicate that the ratio between oxidized and reduced BH(4) 
metabolites tightly regulates superoxide formation from eNOS. The pathological 
significance of this scenario is discussed.

Abstract

Augmentation of superoxide levels has been linked to impaired relaxation in hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia. Purified endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) generates superoxide under limited availability of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)). Thus alterations in endothelial BH(4) levels have been postulated to stimulate superoxide production from eNOS. This possibility was examined by determining the concentration-dependent effects of BH(4), and its analogues, on superoxide formation by eNOS. Superoxide was quantified by EPR spin trapping, which is the only available technique to quantify superoxide from eNOS. Using 5-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-pyrroline N-oxide, we show that only fully reduced BH(4) diminished superoxide release from eNOS, with efficiency BH(4)>6-methyl-BH(4)>5-methyl-BH(4). In contrast, partially oxidized BH(4) analogues, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (7,8-BH(2)) and sepiapterin had no effect. Neither l-arginine nor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) abolished superoxide formation.
