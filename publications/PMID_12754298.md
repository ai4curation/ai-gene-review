We have identified a novel protein, apoptotic regulator in the membrane of the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ARMER), which protects HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells from 
apoptosis induced by various stimuli. We demonstrate that ARMER is an 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) integral membrane protein with four predicted 
transmembrane domains and a COOH-terminal KKXX ER retrieval motif. We used an 
inducible expression system (pIND) to study the effects of regulated ARMER 
overexpression. Cells in which ARMER was overexpressed exhibited protection from 
multiple apoptotic inducers including serum starvation, doxorubicin, UV 
irradiation, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and the ER stressors brefeldin A, 
tunicamycin, and thapsigargin. Analysis of the caspase proteolytic cascade 
reveals that ARMER inhibits proteolysis of the caspase-9-specific fluorogenic 
substrate LEHD-AFC as well as endogenous substrates downstream of caspase-9; 
however, it does not inhibit cytochrome c release or cleavage of caspase-9 
itself. Apoptotic stimuli cause endogenous levels of ARMER protein and RNA to 
decrease, leading to cell death; however, sustaining ARMER protein levels 
through exogenous expression inhibits apoptosis. These data suggest that ARMER 
is a novel ER integral membrane protein which protects cells by inhibiting 
caspase-9 activity and reveal a possible role for ARMER in cell survival.
