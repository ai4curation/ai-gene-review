Peroxiredoxins are known to interact with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and to 
participate in oxidant scavenging, redox signal transduction, and heat-shock 
responses. The two-cysteine peroxiredoxin Tpx1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe has 
been characterized as the H(2)O(2) sensor that transduces the redox signal to 
the transcription factor Pap1. Here, we show that Tpx1 is essential for aerobic, 
but not anaerobic, growth. We demonstrate that Tpx1 has an exquisite sensitivity 
for its substrate, which explains its participation in maintaining low 
steady-state levels of H(2)O(2). We also show in vitro and in vivo that 
inactivation of Tpx1 by oxidation of its catalytic cysteine to a sulfinic acid 
is always preceded by a sulfinic acid form in a covalently linked dimer, which 
may be important for understanding the kinetics of Tpx1 inactivation. 
Furthermore, we provide evidence that a strain expressing Tpx1.C169S, lacking 
the resolving cysteine, can sustain aerobic growth, and we show that small 
reductants can modulate the activity of the mutant protein in vitro, probably by 
supplying a thiol group to substitute for cysteine 169.
