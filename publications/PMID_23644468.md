The transition zone is a specialized compartment found at the base of cilia, 
adjacent to the centriole distal end, where axonemal microtubules are heavily 
crosslinked to the surrounding membrane to form a barrier that gates the ciliary 
compartment. A number of ciliopathy molecules have been found to associate with 
the transition zone, but factors that directly recognize axonemal microtubules 
to specify transition zone assembly at the cilia base remain unclear. Here, 
through quantitative centrosome proteomics, we identify an axoneme-associated 
protein, CEP162 (KIAA1009), tethered specifically at centriole distal ends to 
promote transition zone assembly. CEP162 interacts with core transition zone 
components, and mediates their association with microtubules. Loss of CEP162 
arrests ciliogenesis at the stage of transition zone assembly. Abolishing its 
centriolar tethering, however, allows CEP162 to stay on the growing end of the 
axoneme and ectopically assemble transition zone components at cilia tips. This 
generates extra-long cilia with strikingly swollen tips that actively release 
ciliary contents into the extracellular environment. CEP162 is thus an 
axoneme-recognition protein pre-tethered at centriole distal ends before 
ciliogenesis to promote and restrict transition zone formation specifically at 
the cilia base.
