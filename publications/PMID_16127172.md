The TRE17 (USP6/TRE-2) oncogene induces tumorigenesis in both humans and mice. 
However, little is known regarding its regulation or mechanism of 
transformation. TRE17 encodes a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16)/Rab GTPase-activating 
protein homology domain at its N terminus and a ubiquitin-specific protease at 
its C terminus. In the current study, we identified the ubiquitous calcium 
(Ca2+)-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) as a novel binding partner for TRE17. 
CaM bound directly to TRE17 in a Ca2+-dependent manner both in vitro and in 
vivo. The CaM-binding site was mapped to two hydrophobic motifs near the C 
terminus of the TBC domain. Point mutations within these motifs significantly 
reduced the interaction of TRE17 with CaM. We further found that TRE17 is 
monoubiquitinated and promotes its own deubiquitination in vivo. CaM 
binding-deficient mutants of TRE17 exhibited significantly reduced 
monoubiquitination, suggesting that binding of Ca2+/CaM to TRE17 promotes this 
modification. Consistent with this notion, treatment of cells with the CaM 
inhibitor W7 reduced levels of TRE17 monoubiquitination. Interestingly, the 
calcium ionophore A23187 induced accumulation of a polyubiquitinated TRE17 
species. The effect of A23187 was attenuated in CaM binding-deficient mutants of 
TRE17. Taken together, these studies indicate a role for Ca2+/CaM in regulating 
ubiquitination through direct interaction with TRE17.
