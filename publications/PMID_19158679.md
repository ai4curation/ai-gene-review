Cytoplasmic DNA triggers activation of the innate immune system. Although 
'downstream' signaling components have been characterized, the DNA-sensing 
components remain elusive. Here we present a systematic proteomics screen for 
proteins that associate with DNA, 'crossed' to a screen for transcripts induced 
by interferon-beta, which identified AIM2 as a candidate cytoplasmic DNA sensor. 
AIM2 showed specificity for double-stranded DNA. It also recruited the 
inflammasome adaptor ASC and localized to ASC 'speckles'. A decrease in AIM2 
expression produced by RNA-mediated interference impaired DNA-induced maturation 
of interleukin 1beta in THP-1 human monocytic cells, which indicated that 
endogenous AIM2 is required for DNA recognition. Reconstitution of unresponsive 
HEK293 cells with AIM2, ASC, caspase-1 and interleukin 1beta showed that AIM2 
was sufficient for inflammasome activation. Our data suggest that AIM2 is a 
cytoplasmic DNA sensor for the inflammasome.
