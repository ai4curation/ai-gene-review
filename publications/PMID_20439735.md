Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a class III histone deacetylase that deacetylates histone 
and nonhistone proteins to regulate gene transcription and protein function. 
Because SIRT1 regulates very diverse responses such as apoptosis, insulin 
sensitivity, autophagy, differentiation, and stem cell pluripotency, it has been 
a challenge to reconcile how it orchestrates such pleiotropic effects. Here we 
show that SIRT1 serves as an important regulator of Wnt signaling. We 
demonstrate that SIRT1 loss of function leads to a significant decrease in the 
levels of all three Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
SIRT1 and Dvl proteins complex in vivo and that inhibition of SIRT1 leads to 
changes in gene expression of Wnt target genes. Finally, we demonstrate that 
Wnt-stimulated cell migration is inhibited by a SIRT1 inhibitor. Because the 
three mammalian Dvl proteins serve as key messengers for as many as 19 Wnt 
ligands, SIRT1-mediated regulation of Dvl proteins may explain the diverse 
physiological responses observed in different cellular contexts. Previously, 
SIRT1 had only been shown to mediate the epigenetic silencing of Wnt 
antagonists. In contrast, here we report that SIRT1 regulates Dvl protein levels 
and Wnt signaling in several cellular contexts. These findings demonstrate that 
SIRT1 is a regulator of transient and constitutive Wnt signaling.
