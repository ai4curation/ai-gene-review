Molecular analysis of the cadherin-catenin complex elucidated the central role 
of beta-catenin in this adhesion complex, as it binds to the cytoplasmic domain 
of E-cadherin and to alpha-catenin. beta-Catenin may also function in signalling 
pathways, given its homology to the gene product of the Drosophila segment 
polarity gene armadillo, which is known to be involved in the wingless 
signalling cascade. To study the function of beta-catenin during mouse 
development, gene knock-out experiments were performed in embryonic stem cells 
and transgenic mice were generated. beta-Catenin null-mutant embryos formed 
blastocysts, implanted and developed into egg-cylinder-stage embryos. At day 7 
post coitum, the development of the embryonic ectoderm was affected in mutant 
embryos. Cells detached from the ectodermal cell layer and were dispersed into 
the proamniotic cavity. No mesoderm formation was observed in mutant embryos. 
The development of extraembryonic structures appeared less dramatically or not 
at all affected. Our results demonstrate that, although beta-catenin is 
expressed rather ubiquitously, it is specifically required in the ectodermal 
cell layer.
