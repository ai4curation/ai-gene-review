Protein-RNA interactions are fundamental to core biological processes, such as 
mRNA splicing, localization, degradation, and translation. We developed a 
photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced UV crosslinking and oligo(dT) purification 
approach to identify the mRNA-bound proteome using quantitative proteomics and 
to display the protein occupancy on mRNA transcripts by next-generation 
sequencing. Application to a human embryonic kidney cell line identified close 
to 800 proteins. To our knowledge, nearly one-third were not previously 
annotated as RNA binding, and about 15% were not predictable by computational 
methods to interact with RNA. Protein occupancy profiling provides a 
transcriptome-wide catalog of potential cis-regulatory regions on mammalian 
mRNAs and showed that large stretches in 3' UTRs can be contacted by the 
mRNA-bound proteome, with numerous putative binding sites in regions harboring 
disease-associated nucleotide polymorphisms. Our observations indicate the 
presence of a large number of mRNA binders with diverse molecular functions 
participating in combinatorial posttranscriptional gene-expression networks.
