Abstract

DNA damage response (DDR) acts as a tumorigenesis barrier, and any defects in the DDR machinery may lead to cancer. SOX4 expression is elevated in many types of tumors; however, its role in DDR is still largely unknown. Here, we show that SOX4, a new DNA damage sensor, is required for the activation of p53 tumor suppressor in response to DNA damage. Notably, SOX4 interacts with and stabilizes p53 protein by blocking Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, SOX4 enhances p53 acetylation by interacting with p300/CBP and facilitating p300/CBP/p53 complex formation. In concert with these results, SOX4 promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and it inhibits tumorigenesis in a p53-dependent manner. Therefore, these findings highlight SOX4 as a potential key factor in regulating DDR-associated cancer.

Discussion

We have identified SOX4 as a new DNA damage-induced protein that is crucial for p53 activation in response to genotoxic stress. Under normal conditions, p53 is tightly controlled by Mdm2, which acts as an E3 ligase to target p53 for ubiquitination and degradation ( 11 , 12 ). In response to DNA damage, p53 is rapidly accumulated, in part through the activation of ATM/ATR kinases, which directly or indirectly trigger the posttranslational modification cascade of p53, such as phosphorylation and acetylation ( 10 ). The stabilization of p53 upon DNA damage is largely dependent on these modifications. Several proteins have been identified to regulate p53 activity by affecting its stabilization, whereas each has a somewhat different detailed mechanism of action ( 31 ). In this study, we report that the increased p53 stabilization is achieved via abrogated p53–Mdm2 interaction by SOX4. This disruption is unlikely due to their competitive binding to p53, because SOX4 and Mdm2 bind separate regions of p53. It seems that SOX4 does not act as a cofactor of Mdm2, like p14 ARF ( 38 ), Rb ( 39 ), and YY1 ( 40 ); nor does SOX4 bind to Mdm2. Instead, we observed that SOX4 interacts with p300/CBP transacetylases and facilitates the formation of stable p53/p300 or p53/CBP complexes and consequently promotes p53 acetylation in residues Lys-373 and Lys-382. It is believed that the acetylation of p53 leads to less ubiquitination, because the 2 modifications compete for the same lysine residues and increased p53 activity by enhancing the DNA-binding ability of p53 ( 41 ). Moreover, it is recently reported that acetylation of p53 destabilizes the p53–Mdm2 complex formation ( 17 ). Thus, the augmentation of acetylation by SOX4 may be accountable for SOX4-mediated p53 stabilization and activation.

We demonstrate that SOX4 is induced in response to DNA damage in a p53-independent manner. The significance of the SOX4 induction in this event lies in the fact that loss of SOX4 impairs p53 activation and consequent tumor-suppressive functions, such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Based on the observation that SOX4 interacts with p53 in physiological conditions, it is possible that SOX4 is required for maintaining a basal level of p53 expression. However, when DNA damage occurs, SOX4 protein is rapidly induced to form a more stable complex with p53 to promote its stabilization. It is noteworthy that the induction of SOX4 upon DNA damage is dependent on ATM kinase, which is a key kinase involved in DDR. The ATM/ATR-regulated DDR machinery serves as an anticancer barrier in early tumorigenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest or cell death ( 2 ). It is believed that DDR is constitutively activated in many human cancer cell lines ( 1 ). Thus, the aberrant overexpression of SOX4 in many tumors, presumably induced by the constitutively activated DDR, may provide a stress signal in triggering p53 activation, which provides a safeguard against oncogenic proliferation. Mutations in DDR components are strongly associated with cancers ( 42 ). Indeed, SOX4 gene mutations have been reported in human lung cancers ( 43 ), and we found that these mutations of SOX4 in human lung cancer abolished the normal function of SOX4 in regulating p53 activity and, more importantly, some of these SOX4 mutants may even function as dominant-negative mutants by blocking p53 activity instead. These findings thus raise the possibility that SOX4 acts as a component of DDR in sustaining genomic integrity by enhancing p53 function.

The significance of tumor-suppressive function of SOX4 in tumorigenesis has been emphasized by clinical research revealing that higher SOX4 expression correlates with better survival in bladder tumor and medulloblastoma patients ( 29 , 44 ). Nevertheless, SOX4 was also reported to be an oncogene for human prostate cancer cells ( 45 ), and SOX4 knockdown promotes apoptosis in adenoid cystic carcinoma cells ( 46 ). Thus, whether SOX4 is a tumor suppressor or an oncogene is presumably context-dependent, which is worth further investigation.

In conclusion, we established SOX4 as an important p53 regulator that is up-regulated by DNA damage and exerts its inhibitory role on cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis through p53. Furthermore, SOX4 interacts with p53 to enhance its transcriptional activity by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Taken together, our findings shed light on the molecular mechanistic insight into the role of SOX4 in tumorigenesis, and drugs targeting SOX4 may be a potential anticancer therapeutic approach for future studies.
