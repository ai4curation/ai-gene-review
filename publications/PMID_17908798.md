In budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the periodic expression of the 
G2/M-specific gene CLB2 depends on a DNA binding complex that mediates its 
repression during G1 and activation from the S phase to the exit of mitosis. The 
switch from low to high expression levels depends on the transcriptional 
activator Ndd1. We show that the inactivation of the Sin3 histone deacetylase 
complex bypasses the essential role of Ndd1 in cell cycle progression. Sin3 and 
its catalytic subunit Rpd3 associate with the CLB2 promoter during the G1 phase 
of the cell cycle. Both proteins dissociate from the promoter at the onset of 
the S phase and reassociate during G2 phase. Sin3 removal coincides with a 
transient increase in histone H4 acetylation followed by the expulsion of at 
least one nucleosome from the promoter region. Whereas the first step depends on 
Cdc28/Cln1 activity, Ndd1 function is required for the second step. Since the 
removal of Sin3 is independent of Ndd1 recruitment and Cdc28/Clb activity it 
represents a unique regulatory step which is distinct from transcriptional 
activation.
