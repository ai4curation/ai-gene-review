Autophagy is the degradation of cellular organelles via the lysosomal pathway. 
The autophagic ubiquitin-like (Ubl) molecule Atg8 is activated by the E1-like 
enzyme Atg7. As this noncanonical E1 enzyme's domain organization is unique 
among Ubl-activating E1 enzymes, the structural basis for its interactions with 
Atg8 and partner E2 enzymes remains obscure. Here we present the structure of 
the N-terminal domain of Atg7, revealing a unique protein fold and interactions 
with both autophagic E2 enzymes Atg3 and Atg10. The structure of the C-terminal 
domain of Atg7 in complex with Atg8 shows the mode of dimerization and mechanism 
of recognition of Atg8. Notably, the catalytic cysteine residue in Atg7 is 
positioned close to the C-terminal glycine of Atg8, its target for thioester 
formation, potentially eliminating the need for large conformational 
rearrangements characteristic of other E1s.
