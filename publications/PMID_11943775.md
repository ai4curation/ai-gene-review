Cyclophilin A (CyPA), a ubiquitously distributed intracellular protein, is a 
peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase and the major target of the potent 
immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. Although expressed predominantly as an 
intracellular molecule, CyPA is secreted by cells in response to inflammatory 
stimuli and is a potent neutrophil and eosinophil chemoattractant in vitro and 
in vivo. The mechanisms underlying CyPA-mediated signaling and chemotaxis are 
unknown. Here, we identified CD147 as a cell surface receptor for CyPA and 
demonstrated that CD147 is an essential component in the CyPA-initiated 
signaling cascade that culminates in ERK activation. Both signaling and 
chemotactic activities of CyPA depended also on the presence of heparans, which 
served as primary binding sites for CyPA on target cells. The proline 180 and 
glycine 181 residues in the extracellular domain of CD147 were critical for 
signaling and chemotactic activities mediated by CD147. Also crucial were active 
site residues of CyPA, because rotamase-defective CyPA mutants failed to 
initiate signaling events. These results establish cyclophilins as natural 
ligands for CD147 and suggest an unusual, rotamase-dependent mechanism of 
signaling.
