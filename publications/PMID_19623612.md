During vertebrate lens development, the anterior, ectoderm-derived lens vesicle 
cells differentiate into a monolayer of epithelial cells that retain 
proliferative potential. Subsequently, they exit the cell cycle and give rise to 
posterior lens fiber cells that form the lens body. In the present study, we 
demonstrate that the transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed in the posterior 
lens fiber cells during embryogenesis, and that GATA-3 deficiency impairs lens 
development. Interestingly, expression of E-cadherin, a premature lens vesicle 
marker, is abnormally prolonged in the posterior region of Gata3 homozygous 
mutant lenses. Furthermore, expression of gamma-crystallin, a differentiation 
marker for fiber cells, is reduced. This suppressed differentiation is 
accompanied by an abnormal cellular proliferation, as well as with diminished 
levels of the cell-cycle inhibitors Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57 and increased 
Ccnd2/cyclin D2 abundance. Thus, these observations suggest that GATA-3 is 
essential for lens cells differentiation and proper cell cycle control.

Abstract

During vertebrate lens development, the anterior, ectoderm-derived lens vesicle cells differentiate into a monolayer of epithelial cells that retain proliferative potential. Subsequently, they exit the cell cycle and give rise to posterior lens fiber cells that form the lens body. In the present study, we demonstrate that the transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed in the posterior lens fiber cells during embryogenesis, and that GATA-3-deficiency impairs lens development. Interestingly, expression of E-cadherin, a premature lens vesicle marker, is abnormally prolonged in the posterior region of Gata3 homozygous mutant lenses. Furthermore, expression of γ-crystallin, a differentiation marker for fiber cells, is reduced. This suppressed differentiation is accompanied by an abnormal cellular proliferation, as well as with diminished levels of the cell-cycle inhibitors Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57 and increased Ccnd2/cyclin D2 abundance. Thus, these observations suggest that GATA-3 is essential for lens cells differentiation and proper cell cycle control.

Introduction

During vertebrate lens development, a group of head ectoderm cells thickens and forms the lens placode in response to inductive signals from the underlying optic vesicle at embryonic day (e) 9.5 of mouse embryogenesis ( Muthukkaruppan, 1965 ; McAvoy, 1980 ; Lovicu and McAvoy, 2005 ; Medina-Martinez and Jamerich, 2007 ). By e11.5, the lens placode, through invagination, develops into a lens vesicle in which the primary lens fiber cells in the posterior region eventually exit the cell cycle to elongate toward the anterior wall. Three days later, this elongation is complete, and the fully differentiated fiber cells come into contact with the monolayer of cuboidal lens epithelial cells at the anterior of the eye. Throughout most of life, cell proliferation occurs preferentially in a subset of the epithelial cells located near the equatorial zone. After undergoing cell division, they withdraw from the cell cycle and move posteriorly to differentiate into secondary lens fiber cells ( McAvoy, 1980 ; Piatigorsky, 1981 ; Lovicu and McAvoy, 2005 ; Medina-Martinez and Jamerich, 2007 ). As fiber cells differentiate, they rapidly increase in length and volume and accumulate high levels of crystallins, the proteins that account for the transparency and high refractive index of the lens ( Piatigorsky, 1981 ; Lovicu and McAvoy, 2005 ; Andley, 2007 ). After completing elongation, fiber cells partially fuse with their neighbors and degrade all membrane bound organelles, including the nuclei.

The cessation of cell proliferation requires the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CKIs). Two families of CKIs have been identified. The Cip/Kip family contains Cdkn1a/p21, Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57, which inhibit all kinases involved in the G1/S transition. The INK4a family, comprised of Cdkn2b/p15, Cdkn2a/p16, Cdkn2c/p18, and Cdkn2d/p19, specifically inhibit Cdk4 and Cdk6, blocking entry into the cell cycle ( Harper and Elledge, 1996 ; Sherr and Roberts, 1995 ; Nakayama and Nakayama, 1998 ). Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57 are co-expressed during murine lens development, especially in the equatorial zone of the fetal lens ( Zhang et al., 1998 ; Nagahama et al., 2001 ). The withdrawal of lens fiber cells from the cell cycle largely depends on the expression of Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57 because in mice that lack these genes, fiber cells continue to proliferate and cause incomplete lens fiber elongation. Eventually these fiber cells undergo apoptosis in Cdkn1b/p27 −/− and Cdkn1c/p57 +/−m (m, denoting maternal active Cdkn1c/p57 allele) compound mutant mice ( Zhang et al., 1998 ). The other cell cycle regulators involved in lens differentiation are the D-type cyclins. All three D-type cyclins are expressed during lens differentiation, with Ccnd2/Cyclin D2 being the most highly expressed cyclin in the posterior region ( Zhang et al., 1998 ). Down-regulation of Ccnd2/Cyclin D2 in the postmitotic lens fiber cell is required for the maintenance of the postmitotic state ( Gomez et al., 1999 ).

Several genes have been identified that play important roles in the development of the lens. Gata3 encodes a transcription factor containing two steroid hormone receptor-like zinc fingers that serve as a DNA binding domain, a motif which is highly conserved amongst all six members (GATA-1 to -6) ( Patient and McGhee, 2002 ). These zinc fingers bind most avidly to the consensus motif AGATCTTA( Ko and Engel, 1993 ). The physiological roles of GATA-3 has been revealed through the analysis of GATA-3 deficient ES cells or various germ line mutant mice: GATA-3 plays a critical role in the differentiation of T lymphocytes, hair follicles, mammary gland, renal and central nervous systems ( Pandolfi et al., 1995 ; Ting et al., 1996 ; Kurek et al., 2007 ; Kaufman et al., 2003 ; Hasegawa et al., 2007 ; van Doorninck et al., 1999 ; Grote et al., 2006 ; Kouros-Mehr et al., 2006 ; Asselin-Labat et al., 2007 ). Moreover, GATA-3 is prominently expressed in the primary sympathetic chain and persists during the development of all sympathoadrenal (SA) lineages, including sympathetic neurons, adrenal chromaffin cells and para-aortic chromaffin cells [the Zuckerkandl organ ( George et al., 1994 ; Lakshmanan et al., 1999 ; Lim et al., 2000 ; Moriguchi et al., 2006 ).

Gata3 null mutants die around e11 as a consequence of primary noradrenalin biosynthetic defect and secondary cardiac failure ( Gata3 −/− ; Pandolfi et al., 1995 ; Lim et al., 2000 ). But they can be rescued by feeding Gata3 heterozygous intercrossed dams with synthetic catecholamine intermediates, or by restoring GATA-3 function specifically in SA lineages using the human dopamine β-hydroxylase (hDBH) promoter to direct GATA-3 transgenic expression (Tg hDBH-G3 ; Lim et al., 2000 ; Moriguchi et al., 2006 ). We and others have previously reported that GATA-3 is expressed in lens fiber cells of murine embryos ( Oosterwegel et al., 1992 ; Lakshmanan et al., 1999 ), although the physiological significance of this observation is unknown. In the present study, we examined the consequences of a GATA-3 loss-of-function mutation in lens development of Tg hDBH-G3 -rescued Gata3 null mutants. We demonstrate that Gata3 inactivation led to abnormal development of the posterior lens fiber cells, which exhibit reduced levels of the differentiation marker γ-crystallin, sustained expression of lens vesicle marker E-cadherin and the increased signal of proliferation markers, i.e., BrdU incorporation and Ki67 immunoreactivity. The abnormal proliferation of the lens fiber cells in Tg hDBH-G3 -rescued Gata3 null mutant lenses correlates with reduced levels of Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57 CKIs as well as increased Ccnd2/Cyclin D2 abundance. Subsequently, these cells succumbed to apoptotic cell death. The molecular pathway that regulates lens differentiation is intimately intertwined with normal cell cycle control, and GATA-3 plays an important role in cellular differentiation of lens fiber cells by inducing cell cycle exit as a part of its regulatory functions.

Discussion

In the present study, we demonstrated that GATA-3 expression begins in the developing lens vesicle at mid-embryogenesis (around e11.5) and continues to be expressed in fiber cells throughout embryonic lens development. Its expression is specifically restricted to fiber cells during lens morphogenesis. Consistent with its spatiotemporal expression in the developing lens, the absence of GATA-3 led to interrupted differentiation of posterior lens fiber cells from e12.5 onward, as evidenced by the diminished γ-crystallin levels and prolonged E-cadherin expression in primary lens fiber cells. There was also an increase of mitotic (BrdU- or Ki67-immunopositive) and apoptotic fiber cells in the GATA-3-depleted lens.

Cell cycle regulation by GATA factors has been reported in a variety of different tissues. Recently, it was reported that Gata2 -deficient mouse embryonic neuroepithelial cells exhibited aberrant proliferation and that GATA-2 over-expression induced neural differentiation by inhibiting the proliferation of neuronal progenitors via activation of Cdkn1b/p27 expression ( El Wakil et al., 2006 ). In erythroid cell differentiation, GATA-1 was reported to induce erythro-megakaryotic differentiation by suppressing the active cell cycle of hematopoietic progenitor cells via induction of Cdkn2a/p16 expression ( Pan et al., 2005 ). Although it is still unclear if GATA-2 or GATA-1 directly regulates Cdkn1b/p27 or Cdkn2a/p16 expression, respectively, these reports as well as the present observations suggest that the potential cell cycle regulatory function for GATA factors in the normal differentiation process acts by activating expression of CKIs. GATA-3 has been reported to suppress abnormal proliferation of mesonephric cells as well as mammary epithelial cells, although the molecular basis for these phenomena remains elusive ( Grote et al., 2006 ; Kouros-Mehr et al., 2006 ). More recently, transcriptome analysis of GATA-3 conditional deletion in hair follicles indicated that multiple cell cycle regulatory genes were altered in expression ( Kurek et al., 2007 ). Further studies will be necessary to determine how GATA-3 functionally coordinates cell cycle regulation with normal differentiation in a variety of GATA-3-expressing tissues, including lens fiber cells.

Although the mechanistic details of how the loss of GATA-3 results in lens fiber differentiation failure remains to be elucidated, cell cycle regulators may be the potential key molecules underlying the abnormal increase of proliferating cells. In the wild type lens, the epithelial cells near the equatorial zone exit the cell cycle to give rise to fiber cells, and in the process, they initiate the expression of Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57. Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57 cooperatively control the cell cycle exit and the subsequent differentiation of lens fiber cells. Cdkn1b/p27 is normally dispensable for lens development due to its redundancy with Cdkn1c/p57, whereas Cdkn1b/p27 −/− and Cdkn1c/p57 +/−m , like the Gata3 -deficient mice, exhibit significant deficiencies in cell cycle withdrawal and in the subsequent differentiation of lens fiber cells ( Zhang et al., 1998 ; Nagahama et al., 2001 ). In the Gata3 -deficient lens, we demonstrated that Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57 immunoreactivities were dramatically suppressed in the equatorial zone, and that their mRNA abundance was reduced in lens, suggesting that GATA-3 deficiency results in the suppression of these two CKIs at the transcription level. However, we have been unable to identify conserved GATA consensus binding sites around the Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57 promoters or to observe GATA-3-dependent trans- activation of a reporter gene cis -linked to a 1.6 kbp Cdkn1b/p27 or a 2.0 kbp Cdkn1c/p57 promoter in several cell lines in co-transfection experiments (data not shown), suggesting that Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57 are either not direct target genes of GATA-3 or that GATA-3 regulates those genes through enhancers that lie outside of the promoter boundaries.

We examined Sox1, Foxe3, Prox1, c-Maf and Pax6 mRNA expression in e16.5 GATA-3-deficient lenses to examine potential genetic interactions between GATA-3 and each of those other known lens developmental regulators. Sox1 expression initiates in the lens vesicle at around e10 and continues to be expressed in lens fiber cells at e15.5 (Nishiguchi et al., 1999). Foxe3, Prox1 and c-Maf expression is first detected at around e9.0~e9.5 over the lens placode ( Medina-Marinez et al., 2005 ; Wigle et al., 1999 ; Kawauchi et al., 1999 ). Foxe3 expression later becomes restricted to the anterior lens epithelium, while Prox1 and c-Maf expression are maintained in the lens fiber cells ( Medina-Martinez et al., 2005 ; Wigle et al., 1999 ; Kawauchi et al., 1999 ). Pax6 expression is observed much earlier (in head neural ectoderm) including in the optic pit at e8.0, although from e13.5 onward Pax6 expression is down regulated in lens fiber cells ( Grindley et al., 1995 ; Donner et al., 2007 ). Given those spacio-temporal expression patterns and the similarities in lens deficiencies encountered in various mutant mice, we initially expected to establish a genetic regulatory relationship between GATA-3 and Sox1 or Prox1 expression in the developing lens fiber cells. However, all of those transcriptional regulators are in general only modestly, if at all, changed in the GATA-3 deficient lens. Given the later appearance of GATA-3 expression in the e10.5 lens vesicle as well as the relatively mild lens deficiency in Gata3 mutant mice, we assumed that GATA-3 might be located at a lower position in the hierarchy, but upstream of γ-crystallin and both CKIs (Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57) in the genetic program of lens development. Interestingly, GATA-3 expression is strongly activated in the remnants of the c-Maf deficient lens. This observation clearly demonstrates that GATA-3 expression is directly or indirectly negatively controlled by c-Maf in normal developing lens fiber cells, so that a c-Maf deficiency derepresses GATA-3 expression, possibly to compensate for the suppressed crystalin gene activation. Precise mapping of lens-specific Gata3 gene regulatory sequences, which are presumably located within a 2 kbp region lying 5′ to the gene ( George et al., 1994 ; Lieuw et al., 1997 ), will provide additional insight into the identities of upstream regulators of GATA-3 expression in lens fiber cells.

During differentiation, mature lens fiber cells produce abundant β- and γ-crystallins ( McAvoy, 1978 ). Of the crystalline subtypes, α-crystallins are normally expressed in both lens epithelial and fiber cells, and are first expressed at the lens vesicle stage ( McAvoy, 1978 ; Murer-Orland et al., 1987 ; Goring et al., 1992 ; Horwitz et al., 2003 ). β-crystallin expression, which begins at e11 in the mouse embryo, serves as an early marker of fiber cell differentiation, whereas γ-crystallin gene activation initiates around e12.5 ( Nishiguchi et al., 1998 ; Goring et al., 1992 ; Ring et al., 2000 ). We showed here that γA, γC and γD-crystallin expression, which are normally restricted in expression to terminally differentiated fiber cells, were more diminished than αA- and β1-crystallin in Gata3 −/− :Tg hDBH-G3 lenses. In the Gata3 mutant lens, the fiber cell differentiation failure is associated with aberrant accumulation of mitotic posterior cells. There are two possible explanations for this observation. One is that GATA-3 primarily promotes fiber cell differentiation, i.e., activation of γ-crystallin genes as well as suppression of E-cadherin expression, so that a GATA-3 deficiency would primarily induce a fiber cell deficiency which in turn would lead to the accumulation of premature epithelial cell-like posterior cells. The other possibility is that the GATA-3 deficiency primarily but indirectly leads to transcriptional suppression of Cdkn1b/p27 and Cdkn1c/p57, which then cause the failure of cell cycle cessation during epithelial to fiber cell transition. Consequently, the posterior lens fiber cells do not fully differentiate and eventually apoptose. Although these two explanations could both be partially correct, cell differentiation and cell cycle cessation are probably tightly interwoven. It will therefore be of great interest to further define how GATA-3 functions during induction of cell differentiation as well as how it regulates cell cycle suppression during lens development.

In conclusion, we demonstrated here that GATA-3 is essential for terminal differentiation of lens fiber cells. It will be intriguing to clarify the underlying mechanisms by which the expression of CKIs and CDKs are controlled by GATA factors, and to identify other cell cycle/apoptosis-related factors which might be responsible for the increased cell death observed in the Gata3- deficient lens fiber cells. We conclude, from the data presented here, that the Gata3 mutant mouse lens may serve as another useful model for elucidating the general principles of cell cycle regulation by GATA transcription factors.
