TAPA-1 is a transmembrane protein that has been shown to be involved in cell 
growth and cellular adhesion. Our studies were aimed at determining the 
mechanisms of the biologic phenomena mediated by TAPA-1, which include the 
identification of proteins that are associated with it on the surface of 
lymphocytes. We and others have previously shown that Leu-13, a leukocyte Ag, is 
one such molecule and that in B cells TAPA-1 is associated with the CD19 Ag. 
Herein we identify an additional molecule, HLA-DR, that is noncovalently 
associated on the surface of B cells with TAPA-1. This association was first 
detected by immunoprecipitation by anti-TAPA-1 and by anti-HLA-DR antibodies in 
the presence of mild detergents. The initial observation was confirmed by 
2-dimensional SDS-PAGE and by direct identification of TAPA-1 in anti-HLA-DR 
immunoprecipitates by Western blot analysis. The association of the two 
molecules on the surface of a human B cell line was shown by cocapping 
experiments. In addition, antibodies to both molecules can induce cellular 
adhesion and an antiproliferative effect. Because the tissue distribution of 
these two molecules only partially overlaps, with TAPA-1 being expressed on most 
cell types and MHC class II expressed on a more restricted group of tissue, it 
is possible that the TAPA-1 molecule provides a basic function that can augment 
a cell type specific activity. In B cells the association of TAPA-1 with CD19 
and HLA-DR may increase cellular interaction and play a supporting role in the 
transmission of specific signals.
