Unconventional myosin proteins of the MyTH-FERM superclass are involved in 
intrafilopodial trafficking, are thought to be mediators of 
membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, and are linked to several forms of deafness 
in mammals. Here we show that the Drosophila myosin XV homolog, Sisyphus, is 
expressed at high levels in leading edge cells and their cellular protrusions 
during the morphogenetic process of dorsal closure. Sisyphus is required for the 
correct alignment of cells on opposing sides of the fusing epithelial sheets, as 
well as for adhesion of the cells during the final zippering/fusion phase. We 
have identified several putative Sisyphus cargos, including DE-cadherin (also 
known as Shotgun) and the microtubule-linked proteins Katanin-60, EB1, Milton 
and aPKC. These cargos bind to the Sisyphus FERM domain, and their binding is in 
some cases mutually exclusive. Our data suggest a mechanism for Sisyphus in 
which it maintains a balance between actin and microtubule cytoskeleton 
components, thereby contributing to cytoskeletal cross-talk necessary for 
regulating filopodial dynamics during dorsal closure.
