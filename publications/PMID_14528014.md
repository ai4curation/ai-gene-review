Megalin is an endocytic receptor that binds multiple ligands and is essential 
for many physiological processes such as brain development and uptake of 
proteins by the kidney tubule, yolk sac, and thyroid. The cytoplasmic tail of 
megalin contains two FXNPXY motifs. Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia 
(ARH) is an adaptor protein that binds to the FXNPXY motif of the low-density 
lipoprotein receptor as well as clathrin and AP-2. We found that ARH also binds 
to the first FXNPXY motif of megalin in two-hybrid, pull-down and 
coimmunoprecipitation assays. ARH colocalizes with megalin in clathrin coated 
pits and in recycling endosomes in the Golgi region. When cells are treated with 
nocodazole, the recycling endosomes containing megalin and ARH disperse. On 
internalization of megalin, ARH and megalin are first seen in clathrin coated 
pits followed by sequential localization in early endosomes and tubular 
recycling endosomes in the pericentriolar region followed by their reappearance 
at the cell surface. Expression of ARH in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells 
expressing megalin mini-receptors enhances megalin-mediated uptake of 
125I-lactoferrin, a megalin ligand. These results show that ARH facilitates 
endocytosis of megalin, escorts megalin along its endocytic route and raise the 
possibility that transport through the endosomal system is selective and 
requires interaction with specific adaptor proteins.
