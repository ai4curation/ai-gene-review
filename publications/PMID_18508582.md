Except for Mad2 homologues of maize and wheat, no spindle checkpoint proteins 
which regulate the onset of anaphase during nuclear divisions have been reported 
for plants so far. We found three homologues of the spindle checkpoint protein 
Bub3 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Bub3.1 and Bub3.2 are 88 percent identical at the 
amino acid level, while Bub3.3 is more distantly related. Bub3.1 and Bub3.2 mRNA 
appeared preferentially in mitotically active tissues. Bub3.1 but not Bub3.2 
showed increased expression during mitosis. Nuclear but no centromeric 
localization was shown for EYFP-Bub3.1 and Bub3.1-ECFP fusion constructs. Three 
T-DNA insertion mutants each were identified for Bub3.1 and Bub3.2 encoding 
genes. One bub3.1 mutant survived only in heterozygous state and displayed 
defects in development of male and female gametophytes, while two other 
homozygous bub3.1 mutants revealed transcripts and are therefore no null 
mutants. In contrast, all three homozygous bub3.2 mutants appeared to be viable 
and fertile without generating full-length transcripts.
