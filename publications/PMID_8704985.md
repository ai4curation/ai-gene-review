A region on the Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 chromosome previously shown to 
complement a chemically induced mutant (PCT48) unable to convert acetyl-CoA into 
glyoxylate was characterized in detail in order to identify the gene(s) involved 
in the unknown pathway for acetyl-CoA oxidation. Six complete and two partial 
ORFs were identified by sequencing. Sequence comparisons suggested these might 
code for, respectively, a dehydrogenase of unknown specificity, a polypeptide of 
at least 15 kDa with unknown function, a coenzyme-B12-linked mutase, a catalase, 
an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) of unknown function, a polypeptide of 28 kDa, a 
ketol-acid reductoisomerase and a propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC). Insertion 
mutations were introduced into each ORF in order to determine their involvement 
in C1 and C2 metabolism. Mutations in three genes, encoding the mutase, ADH and 
PCC, resulted in a phenotype characteristic of mutants unable to oxidize 
acetyl-CoA, i.e. they were C1-and C2-negative and their growth on these 
compounds was restored by the addition of glycolate or glyoxylate. Mutants in 
the genes thought to encode catalase and PCC were found to be deficient in the 
corresponding enzyme activity, confirming the identity of these genes, while 
physiological substrates for the mutase and ADH remain unidentified. This work, 
in which three new genes necessary for conversion of acetyl-CoA into glyoxylate 
were identified, is an intermediary step on the way to the solution of the 
unknown pathway for acetyl-CoA oxidation in isocitrate-lyase-negative 
methylotrophs.
