SH3RF (SH3-domain-containing RING finger protein) family members, SH3RF1-3, are 
multidomain scaffold proteins involved in promoting cell survival and apoptosis. 
In this report, we show that SH3RF2 is an oncogene product that is overexpressed 
in human cancers and regulates p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) protein stability. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of 159 colon cancer tissues showed that SH3RF2 
expression levels are frequently elevated in cancer tissues and significantly 
correlate with poor prognostic indicators, including increased invasion, early 
recurrence and poor survival rates. We also demonstrated that PAK4 protein is 
degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that SH3RF2 inhibits PAK4 
ubiquitination via physical interaction-mediated steric hindrance, which results 
in the upregulation of PAK4 protein. Moreover, ablation of SH3RF2 expression 
attenuates TRADD (TNFR-associated death domain) recruitment to tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α) receptor 1 and hinders downstream signals, thereby inhibiting 
NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappaB) activity and enhancing caspase-8 activity, in the 
context of TNF-α treatment. Notably, ectopic expression of SH3RF2 effectively 
prevents apoptosis in cancer cells and enhances cell migration, colony formation 
and tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that SH3RF2 is an 
oncogene that may be a definitive regulator of PAK4. Therefore, SH3RF2 may 
represent an effective therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
