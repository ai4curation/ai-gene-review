Oocyte maturation and fertilization initiates a dynamic and tightly regulated 
process in which a non-dividing oocyte is transformed into a rapidly dividing 
embryo. We have shown previously that two C. elegans CCCH zinc finger proteins, 
OMA-1 and OMA-2, have an essential and redundant function in oocyte maturation. 
Both OMA-1 and OMA-2 are expressed only in oocytes and 1-cell embryos, and need 
to be degraded rapidly after the first mitotic division for embryogenesis to 
proceed normally. We report here a distinct redundant function for OMA-1 and 
OMA-2 in the 1-cell embryo. Depletion of both oma-1 and oma-2 in embryos leads 
to embryonic lethality. We also show that OMA-1 protein is directly 
phosphorylated at T239 by the DYRK kinase MBK-2, and that phosphorylation at 
T239 is required both for OMA-1 function in the 1-cell embryo and its 
degradation after the first mitosis. OMA-1 phosphorylated at T239 is only 
detected within a short developmental window of 1-cell embryos, beginning soon 
after the proposed activation of MBK-2. Phosphorylation at T239 facilitates 
subsequent phosphorylation of OMA-1 by another kinase, GSK-3, at T339 in vitro. 
Phosphorylation at both T239 and T339 are essential for correctly-timed OMA-1 
degradation in vivo. We propose that a series of precisely-timed phosphorylation 
events regulates both the activity and the timing of degradation for OMA 
proteins, thereby allowing restricted and distinct functions of OMA-1 and OMA-2 
in the maturing oocyte and 1-cell embryo, ensuring a normal oocyte-to-embryo 
transition in C. elegans.
