Airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells may contribute to asthma pathogenesis through 
their capacity to switch between a synthetic/proliferative and a contractile 
phenotype. The multimeric dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) spans the 
sarcolemma, linking the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. The DGC is 
expressed in smooth muscle tissue, but its functional role is not fully 
established. We tested whether contractile phenotype maturation of human ASM is 
associated with accumulation of DGC proteins. We compared subconfluent, 
serum-fed cultures and confluent cultures subjected to serum deprivation, which 
express a contractile phenotype. Western blotting confirmed that 
beta-dystroglycan, beta-, delta-, and epsilon-sarcoglycan, and dystrophin 
abundance increased six- to eightfold in association with smooth muscle myosin 
heavy chain (smMHC) and calponin accumulation during 4-day serum deprivation. 
Immunocytochemistry showed that the accumulation of DGC subunits was 
specifically localized to a subset of cells that exhibit robust staining for 
smMHC. Laminin competing peptide (YIGSR, 1 microM) and phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors (20 microM LY-294002 or 100 nM wortmannin) abrogated 
the accumulation of smMHC, calponin, and DGC proteins. These studies demonstrate 
that the accumulation of DGC is an integral feature for phenotype maturation of 
human ASM cells. This provides a strong rationale for future studies 
investigating the role of the DGC in ASM smooth muscle physiology in health and 
disease.
