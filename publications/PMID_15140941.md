Ca2+-binding protein-1 (CaBP1) is a Ca2+-binding protein that is closely related 
to calmodulin (CaM) and localized in somatodendritic regions of principal 
neurons throughout the brain, but how CaBP1 participates in postsynaptic Ca2+ 
signaling is not known. Here, we describe a novel role for CaBP1 in the 
regulation of Ca2+ influx through Ca(v)1.2 (L-type) Ca2+ channels. CaBP1 
interacts directly with the alpha1 subunit of Ca(v)1.2 at sites that also bind 
CaM. CaBP1 binding to one of these sites, the IQ domain, is Ca2+ dependent and 
competitive with CaM binding. The physiological significance of this interaction 
is supported by the association of Ca(v)1.2 and CaBP1 in postsynaptic density 
fractions purified from rat brain. Moreover, in double-label immunofluorescence 
experiments, CaBP1 and Ca(v)1.2 colocalize in numerous cell bodies and dendrites 
of neurons, particularly in pyramidal cells in the CA3 region of the hippocampus 
and in the dorsal cortex. In electrophysiological recordings of cells 
transfected with Ca(v)1.2, CaBP1 greatly prolonged Ca2+ currents, prevented 
Ca2+-dependent inactivation, and caused Ca2+-dependent facilitation of currents 
evoked by step depolarizations and repetitive stimuli. These effects contrast 
with those of CaM, which promoted strong Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Ca(v)1.2 
with these same voltage protocols. Our findings reveal how Ca2+-binding 
proteins, such as CaM and CaBP1, differentially adjust Ca2+ influx through 
Ca(v)1.2 channels, which may specify diverse modes of Ca2+ signaling in neurons.

Abstract

Ca 2+ -binding protein-1 (CaBP1) is a Ca 2+ -binding protein that is closely related to calmodulin (CaM) and localized in somatodendritic regions of principal neurons throughout the brain, but how CaBP1 participates in postsynaptic Ca 2+ signaling is not known. Here, we describe a novel role for CaBP1 in the regulation of Ca 2+ influx through Ca v 1.2 (L-type) Ca 2+ channels. CaBP1 interacts directly with the α 1 subunit of Ca v 1.2 at sites that also bind CaM. CaBP1 binding to one of these sites, the IQ domain, is Ca 2+ dependent and competitive with CaM binding. The physiological significance of this interaction is supported by the association of Ca v 1.2 and CaBP1 in postsynaptic density fractions purified from rat brain. Moreover, in double-label immunofluorescence experiments, CaBP1 and Ca v 1.2 colocalize in numerous cell bodies and dendrites of neurons, particularly in pyramidal cells in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and in the dorsal cortex. In electrophysiological recordings of cells transfected with Ca v 1.2, CaBP1 greatly prolonged Ca 2+ currents, prevented Ca 2+ -dependent inactivation, and caused Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation of currents evoked by step depolarizations and repetitive stimuli. These effects contrast with those of CaM, which promoted strong Ca 2+ -dependent inactivation of Ca v 1.2 with these same voltage protocols. Our findings reveal how Ca 2+ -binding proteins, such as CaM and CaBP1, differentially adjust Ca 2+ influx through Ca v 1.2 channels, which may specify diverse modes of Ca 2+ signaling in neurons.

Introduction

Voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels are major routes of Ca 2+ entry in neurons and are crucial for many forms of synaptic plasticity because they couple membrane depolarization to Ca 2+ -dependent signal transduction. In the postsynaptic membrane, Ca v 1.2 (L-type) Ca 2+ channels selectively trigger activity-dependent gene expression ( Murphy et al., 1991 ; Bading et al., 1993 ; Ginty et al., 1993 ; Dolmetsch et al., 2001 ; Weick et al., 2003 ), mRNA targeting into dendrites ( Tongiorgi et al., 1997 ), and depression of R-type Ca 2+ channels in dendritic spines ( Yasuda et al., 2003 ). The mechanism by which Ca 2+ influx through Ca v 1.2 channels specifically activates these pathways remains unclear but may depend on the interaction of these channels with postsynaptic proteins that regulate their function and/or proximity to key effectors ( Deisseroth et al., 1998 ; Davare et al., 2001 ).

Mounting experimental evidence supports a role for calmodulin (CaM) in regulating the signaling capability of postsynaptic Ca v 1.2 channels via two mechanisms. First, CaM limits excessive Ca 2+ entry through Ca v 1.2 in a process known as Ca 2+ -dependent inactivation, which is mediated by CaM binding directly to the main α 1 subunit of Ca v 1.2 ( Peterson et al., 1999 ; Qin et al., 1999 ; Zühlke et al., 1999 ). Second, physical coupling between CaM and Ca v 1.2 is important for translocation of CaM to the nucleus and activation of transcription factors such as cAMP response element-binding protein and MEF-2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2) ( Deisseroth et al., 1998 ; Dolmetsch et al., 2001 ). Such abilities of CaM to modulate and transduce Ca 2+ signals have led to its proposed role as a multifunctional Ca 2+ sensor ( Chin and Means, 2000 ).

However, CaM is but one member of a family of Ca 2+ -binding proteins, some of which are expressed primarily in neurons ( Burgoyne and Weiss, 2001 ; Haeseleer et al., 2002 ). Because of their structural similarity, CaM and these neuron-specific Ca 2+ -binding proteins (NCBPs) may interact with the same target molecules but mediate distinct forms of target regulation ( Yang et al., 2002 ; Haynes et al., 2004 ). One such NCBP, Ca 2+ -binding protein-1 (CaBP1), interacts with Ca v 2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca 2+ channels, which are also regulated directly by CaM. However, whereas CaM mediates Ca 2+ -dependent inactivation and facilitation of these channels (Lee et al., 1999 , 2000 ; DeMaria et al., 2001 ), CaBP1 strongly enhances inactivation independent of Ca 2+ ( Lee et al., 2002 ).

Although CaBP1 colocalizes with Ca v 2.1 (P/Q-type) channels in a subset of presynaptic nerve terminals ( Lee et al., 2002 ), antibodies recognizing CaBP1 and caldendrin, a splice variant of CaBP1, label primarily somatodendritic regions of neurons throughout the brain ( Seidenbecher et al., 1998 ; Laube et al., 2002 ), a pattern that more closely parallels that of Ca v 1.2 (L-type) channels ( Westenbroek et al., 1990 ; Hell et al., 1993 ). Therefore, we hypothesize that CaBP1 may play an important role in regulating postsynaptic Ca v 1.2 channels. We show that CaBP1 physically associates with Ca v 1.2 at the postsynaptic density (PSD) and competes with CaM for binding to the channel. However, compared with the inhibitory effects of CaM, CaBP1 greatly prolongs and facilitates Ca 2+ currents conducted by Ca v 1.2. These distinct regulatory effects of CaBP1 may contribute to the diverse properties of Ca v 1.2 channels in neurons and determine how Ca 2+ signals are encoded and decoded in the postsynaptic neuron.

Materials and Methods

Constructs and molecular biology. For electrophysiological and biochemical experiments, Ca v 1.2 subunits [α 1 1.2 (rbcII), β 2A , and α 2 δ ( Ellis et al., 1988 ; Snutch et al., 1991 ; Perez-Reyes et al., 1992 )] were expressed from the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For the FLAG-α 1 1.2 construct, a Kozak sequence and FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) were added to the N terminus of α 1 1.2 by PCR of nucleotides 4-1272 of rbcII with a forward primer containing the additional sequences and the resulting PCR product cloned into Hin dIII sites in the parent plasmid (rbcII/pcDNA3.1+). FLAG-α 1 1.2 IQ-AA and FLAG-α 1 1.2 IQ-EE were generated by quick-change mutagenesis with primers incorporating nucleotide changes to substitute alanine or glutamate residues for I1624 and Q1625. The cDNA corresponding to the entire coding region of the short isoform of human CaBP1 (GenBank accession number AF169148 ) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ or pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) ( Haeseleer et al., 2000 ). For binding assays, constructs encoding fusion proteins of the C-terminal domain of α 1 1.2 were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for glutathione S -transferase (GST)- or pTrcHisA (Invitrogen) for His-tagged proteins. The cDNA encoding neuronal Ca 2+ sensor-1 (NCS-1) was generated by PCR with specific primers from rat brain cDNA and subcloned into pcDNA3.1+.

Cell culture and transfection. Human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere under 7% CO 2 . Cells were grown to ∼70-80% confluence and transfected with Gene Porter reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to protocols of the manufacturer.

Binding assays. CaBP1 used for binding assays was obtained by transfecting HEK293T cells plated on 150 mm dishes with a total of 5 μg of CaBP1 subcloned into pcDNA3.1+. Two days later, cells were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 m m HEPES, 50 m m NaCl, 1 m m benzamidine, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and membrane proteins were solubilized by rotating at 4°C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used immediately or aliquotted and stored at -80°C. This procedure separated CaBP1, which is primarily membrane associated in HEK293T cells (data not shown), and CaM, which is cytoplasmic and endogenously expressed by these cells. The absence of CaM, which would have complicated binding analyses with transfected CaBP1, was confirmed by Western blot of these solubilized membrane preparations with anti-CaM antibodies.

Fusion proteins containing fragments of the α 1 1.2 C-terminal domain were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli by isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactopyranoside induction and immobilized on glutathione- or Ni 2+ -agarose beads for GST or His fusion proteins, respectively. Purified CaM (5 μg; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or lysates of cells transfected with CaBP1 were added to 50 μl of a 50% slurry of immobilized fusion protein and brought to a total volume of 1 ml with binding buffer ([Tris-buffered saline (TBS): 20 m m Tris, pH 7.3, and 150 m m NaCl], 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) containing either 2 m m CaCl 2 or 10 m m EGTA. Binding reactions were incubated at 4°C, rotating, for 1 hr. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Bound CaBP1, CaM, or NCS-1 was detected by Western blot with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against CaBP1 [UW72, 1:2000 ( Haeseleer et al., 2000 )], monoclonal anti-CaM antibodies (1:1000; Up-state Biotechnologies, Waltham, MA), or rabbit polyclonal anti-NCS-1 antibodies (1:1000; Zymed, San Francisco, CA). Blots were processed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG 1:4000, anti-mouse IgG 1:2000) and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For some experiments, His-tagged fusion proteins were detected by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-His antibodies (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

Coimmunoprecipitation assays. HEK293T cells were transfected with equimolar amounts of cDNAs encoding Ca v 1.2 subunits (FLAG-α 1 1.2, β 2A , and α 2 δ) with or without CaBP1. At least 48 hr later, cell lysates were prepared as described above and incubated with 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr, rotating at 4°C. After five washes with 1 ml of lysis buffer, proteins were eluted with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and coimmunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting with UW72 or monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (M2, 1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich), followed by secondary antibodies and ECL detection as described above.

For coimmunoprecipitation from rat brain, fractions containing the PSD were isolated by a modified method described previously ( Carlin et al., 1980 ). These procedures, as well as those described for Immunohistochemistry, were done in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . Freshly removed rat brains were homogenized in ice-cold buffer [homogenization buffer (HB): 4 m m HEPES, 1 m m EDTA, and 0.32 m sucrose, pH 7.4] with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 17 μg/ml PMSF, 8 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I, 8 μg/ml calpain inhibitor II, and 1 m m benzamidine). After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, the membrane pellet was resuspended in HB and layered onto a sucrose step gradient (0.8 and 1.2 m ), which was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 hr. Material at the interface of the gradient was removed, centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in HB containing 0.5% Triton X-100, incubated for 15 min, and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min. The final pellet containing the PSD fraction was resuspended in HB and stored at -80°C. Before an experiment, PSD fractions were pelleted and solubilized in HB containing 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4°C with continuous stirring, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The presence of PSD-95 in the resulting supernatant, which was detected by Western blotting with anti-PSD-95 antibodies (1:2000; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) was used to confirm that postsynaptic density proteins were solubilized by this procedure. For coimmunoprecipitations, the supernatant (1 ml) was incubated for 1.5 hr, rotating at 4°C with 10 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against α 1C (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) or purified rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) as a control. Immune complexes were isolated by incubating with 3-5 mg of preswollen Protein A-Sepharose for 2 hr at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immuno-precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting with α 1C (1:200) or UW72 antibodies as described above.

Double-label immunohistochemistry. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were anesthetized deeply (4% chloral hydrate, i.p.) and intracardially perfused with 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.3. The brains were removed and cryoprotected overnight at 4°C in 30% sucrose, 0.1 m PB. Tissue sections (30-40 μm) were cut on a freezing sliding microtome, rinsed in TBS, and blocked in TBS containing 5% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.025% Triton X-100 [blocking buffer (BB)]. All antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 2.5% NGS and 0.025% Triton X-100, and sections were rinsed three times for 20 min each after each step. Blocked brain sections were incubated with anti-α 1C antibodies (1:100; generously provided by Dr. Johannes Hell, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) overnight at 4°C and, after rinsing in TBS, with 1:400 rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Fab fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 60 min. Before double labeling, sections were again blocked at 37°C for 60 min with BB, 120 min with goat anti-rabbit Fab fragments (1:50; Jackson ImmunoResearch), 30 min in 2% avidin-TBS, and 30 min in 2% biotin-TBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C with UW72 (1:1000), the next day with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and subsequently with FITC-avidin D in TBS (1:1600; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The double-labeled sections were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) for viewing under a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM510 Meta confocal microscope.

Electrophysiological recordings. HEK293T cells plated on 35 mm dishes were transfected with a total of 5 μg of DNA including 0.3 μg of a pEGFP-N1 or CaBP1/pEGFPN1 for fluorescent detection of transfected cells. At least 48 hr after transfection, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of transfected cells were acquired with a HEKA Elektronik (Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier. Data acquisition and leak subtraction using a P/-4 protocol were done with Pulse software (HEKA Electronik). Extracellular recording solutions contained the following (in m m ): 150 Tris, 2 MgCl 2 , and 10 CaCl 2 or BaCl 2 . Intracellular solutions consisted of the following (in m m ): 140 N -methyl- d -glucamine, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl 2 , 2 Mg-ATP, and 5 EGTA. The pH of intracellular and extracellular recording solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid. Electrode resistances were typically 1-2MΩ in the bath solution, and series resistance was ∼2-4 MΩ, compensated up to 70%. In recordings of Ba 2+ currents, voltage protocols were adjusted by -10 mV to compensate for the corresponding shift in voltage dependence of activation with substitution of extracellular Ba 2+ for Ca 2+ . The time course of I Ca decay was fit by A slow [exp(- t /τ slow )] + A fast [exp(- t /τ fast )], where t is time, A slow and A fast are the amplitudes of the slow and fast exponentials, respectively, at t = 0, and τ slow and τ fast are the time constants of the decay of the two processes. Data were analyzed using Igor software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), and graphs and statistical analysis were done with Sigma Plot (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

Discussion

Our results provide new insights into the role of CaBP1 in the regulation of neuronal Ca 2+ signaling. CaBP1 binds to the same sites as CaM in the C-terminal domain of the α 1 subunit of Ca v 1.2 but has opposite effects on channel function. Whereas CaM enhances inactivation of Ca v 1.2 in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner, CaBP1 causes overt Ca 2+ -dependent facilitation and prolongs Ca 2+ currents by inhibiting inactivation. The association and colocalization of CaBP1 and Ca v 1.2 postsynaptically in neurons throughout the brain implicate Ca 2+ channel regulation by CaBP1 as an important determinant of voltage-gated Ca 2+ influx in neurons.
