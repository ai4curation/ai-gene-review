A novel cyclin, CCNY, was identified as a PFTK1 interacting protein in a yeast 
two-hybrid screen. The cyclin box in CCNY and the PFTAIRE motif in PFTK1 are 
both required for the interaction which was confirmed by in vivo and in vitro 
assays. Two transcripts (4 and 2kb), of CCNY were detected by Northern blot 
analysis and CCNY was enriched at the plasma membrane due to an N-terminal 
myristoylation signal. We propose that binding of CCNY to PFTK1 enhances PFTK1 
kinase activity and changes its intracellular location.
