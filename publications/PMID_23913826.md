Chromosomal translocations juxtaposing the androgen-responsive TMPRSS2 promoter 
with the ETS-family transcription factor ERG result in aberrant ERG upregulation 
in approximately 50% of prostate cancers. Studies to date have shown important 
roles of ERG in inducing oncogenic properties of prostate cancer. Its molecular 
mechanisms of action, however, are yet to be fully understood. Here, we report 
that ERG activates Wnt/LEF1 signaling cascade through multiple mechanisms. ERG 
bound to the promoters of various Wnt genes to directly increase ligand 
expression. Consequently, ERG overexpression increased active β-catenin level in 
the cells and enhanced TCF/LEF1 luciferase reporter activity, which could be 
partially blocked by WNT-3A inhibitor IWP-2. Most importantly, our data defined 
LEF1 as a direct target of ERG and that LEF1 inhibition fully abolished 
ERG-induced Wnt signaling and target gene expression. Furthermore, functional 
assays showed that Wnt/LEF1 activation phenocopied that of ERG in inducing cell 
growth, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and cell invasion, whereas 
blockade of Wnt signaling attenuated these effects. Concordantly, LEF1 
expression is significantly upregulated in ERG-high human prostate cancers. 
Overall, this study provides an important mechanism of activation of Wnt 
signaling in prostate cancer and nominates LEF1 as a critical mediator of 
ERG-induced tumorigenesis. Wnt/LEF1 pathway might provide novel targets for 
therapeutic management of patients with fusion-positive prostate cancer.
