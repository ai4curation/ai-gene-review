A genomic clone for the human heat shock protein (HSP) 70 gene located on 
chromosome 14 was isolated and sequenced. The gene, designated HSPA2, has a 
single open reading frame of 1917 bp that encodes a 639-amino acid protein with 
a predicted molecular weight of 70,030 Da. Analysis of the sequence indicates 
that HSPA2 is the human homologue of the murine Hsp70-2 gene with 91.7% identity 
in the nucleotide coding sequence and 98.2% in the corresponding amino acid 
sequence. HSPA2 has less amino acid homology to other members of the human HSP70 
gene family, 83.3% to the heat-inducible HSP70-1 gene and 86.1% with the human 
heat shock cognate gene HSC70. HSPA2 is constitutively expressed in most 
tissues, with very high levels in testis and skeletal muscle. Significant but 
lower levels are also expressed in ovary, small intestine, colon, brain, 
placenta, and kidney. A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone containing HSPA2 
(YAC741H4) that also contained the polymorphic marker D14S63 was identified. 
This 670-kb YAC was mapped to 14q24.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH). Subsequent two-color FISH and genetic mapping placed HSPA2/D14S63 
proximal to the markers D14S57 and D14S77.
