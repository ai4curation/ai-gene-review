The NIF3L1 protein is strongly conserved during evolution from bacteria to 
mammals and recently its function in neuronal differentiation has been 
demonstrated. In the present study we identified novel binding partners of human 
NIF3L1 by screening a HeLa cDNA-library using the yeast two-hybrid system. We 
could show that the NIF3L1 protein is interacting with itself and with the 
NIF3L1 binding protein 1 (NIF3L1 BP1), a novel protein of 23.67kDa bearing a 
putative leucine zipper domain. Furthermore, both interactions were confirmed 
using the mammalian two-hybrid system. Deletion analyses clearly demonstrated 
that a C-terminal region of 100 amino acids of the NIF3L1 BP1 is sufficient for 
the interaction with NIF3L1. The NIF3L1 BP1 is ubiquitously expressed and 
cotransfection experiments revealed that NIF3L1 and NIF3L1 BP1 interact in the 
cytoplasm of human LNCaP cells. This study provides novel insights into the 
cellular function of the NIF3L1 protein.
