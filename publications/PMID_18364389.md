An increasing number of neurodegenerative diseases are being linked to mutations 
in genes encoding proteins required for axonal transport and intracellular 
trafficking. A mutation in p150(Glued), a component of the cytoplasmic 
dynein/dynactin microtubule motor complex, results in the human 
neurodegenerative disease distal spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (dSBMA). We 
have developed a transgenic mouse model of dSBMA; these mice exhibit late-onset, 
slowly progressive muscle weakness but do not have a shortened lifespan, 
consistent with the human phenotype. Examination of motor neurons from the 
transgenic model reveals the proliferation of enlarged tertiary lysosomes and 
lipofuscin granules, indicating significant alterations in the cellular 
degradative pathway. In addition, we observe deficits in axonal caliber and 
neuromuscular junction (NMJ) integrity, indicating distal degeneration of motor 
neurons. However, sciatic nerve ligation studies reveal that inhibition of 
axonal transport is not evident in this model. Together, these data suggest that 
mutant p150(Glued) causes neurodegeneration in the absence of significant 
changes in axonal transport, and therefore other functions of dynein/dynactin, 
such as trafficking in the degradative pathway and stabilization of the NMJ are 
likely to be critical in maintaining the health of motor neurons.
