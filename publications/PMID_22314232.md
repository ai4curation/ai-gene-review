A third of the human genome encodes N-glycosylated proteins. These are 
co-translationally translocated into the lumen/membrane of the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) where they fold and assemble before they are transported to their 
final destination. Here, we show that calnexin, a major ER chaperone involved in 
glycoprotein folding is palmitoylated and that this modification is mediated by 
the ER palmitoyltransferase DHHC6. This modification leads to the preferential 
localization of calnexin to the perinuclear rough ER, at the expense of ER 
tubules. Moreover, palmitoylation mediates the association of calnexin with the 
ribosome-translocon complex (RTC) leading to the formation of a supercomplex 
that recruits the actin cytoskeleton, leading to further stabilization of the 
assembly. When formation of the calnexin-RTC supercomplex was affected by DHHC6 
silencing, mutation of calnexin palmitoylation sites or actin depolymerization, 
folding of glycoproteins was impaired. Our findings thus show that calnexin is a 
stable component of the RTC in a manner that is exquisitely dependent on its 
palmitoylation status. This association is essential for the chaperone to 
capture its client proteins as they emerge from the translocon, acquire their 
N-linked glycans and initiate folding.
