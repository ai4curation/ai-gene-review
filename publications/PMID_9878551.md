NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is an extremely complicated 
multiprotein complex located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Its main 
function is the transport of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which is 
accompanied by translocation of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the 
intermembrane space. Human complex I appears to consist of 41 subunits of which 
34 are encoded by nDNA. Here we report the cDNA sequences of the hitherto 
uncharacterized 8 nuclear encoded subunits, all located within the hydrophobic 
protein (HP) fraction of complex I. Now all currently known 41 proteins of human 
NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase have been characterized and reported in 
literature, which enables more complete mutational analysis studies of isolated 
complex I-deficient patients.
