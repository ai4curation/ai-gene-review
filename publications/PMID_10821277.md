Transcription factors carry functional domains, which are often physically 
distinct, for sequence-specific DNA binding, transcriptional activation and 
regulatory functions. The transcription factor ATF-2 is a DNA-binding protein 
that binds to cyclic AMP-response elements (CREs), forms a homodimer or 
heterodimer with c-Jun, and stimulates CRE-dependent transcription. Here we 
report that ATF-2 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), which specifically 
acetylates histones H2B and H4 in vitro. Motif A, which is located in the HAT 
domain, is responsible for the stimulation of CRE-dependent transcription; 
moreover, in response to ultraviolet irradiation, phosphorylation of ATF-2 is 
accompanied by enhanced HAT activity of ATF-2 and CRE-dependent transcription. 
These results indicate that phosphorylation of ATF-2 controls its intrinsic HAT 
activity and its action on CRE-dependent transcription. ATF-2 may represent a 
new class of sequence-specific factors, which are able to activate transcription 
by direct effects on chromatin components.
