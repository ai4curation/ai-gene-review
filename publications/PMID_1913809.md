Genes placed near telomeres in S. cerevisiae succumb to position-effect 
variegation. SIR2, SIR3, SIR4, NAT1, ARD1, and HHF2 (histone H4) were identified 
as modifiers of the position effect at telomeres, since transcriptional 
repression near telomeres was no longer observed when any of the modifier genes 
were mutated. These genes, in addition to SIR1, have previously been shown to 
repress transcription at the silent mating loci, HML and HMR. However, there 
were differences between transcriptional silencing at telomeres and the HM loci, 
as demonstrated by suppressor analysis and the lack of involvement of SIR1 in 
telomeric silencing. These findings provide insights into telomeric structure 
and function that are likely to apply to many eukaryotes. In addition, the 
distinctions between telomeres and the HM loci suggest a hierarchy of 
chromosomal silencing in S. cerevisiae.
