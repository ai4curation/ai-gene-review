DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are deleterious lesions that challenge genome 
integrity. To mitigate this threat, human cells rely on the activity of multiple 
DNA repair machineries that are tightly regulated throughout the cell cycle1. In 
interphase, DSBs are mainly repaired by non-homologous end joining and 
homologous recombination2. However, these pathways are completely inhibited in 
mitosis3-5, leaving the fate of mitotic DSBs unknown. Here we show that DNA 
polymerase theta6 (Polθ) repairs mitotic DSBs and thereby maintains genome 
integrity. In contrast to other DSB repair factors, Polθ function is activated 
in mitosis upon phosphorylation by Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Phosphorylated 
Polθ is recruited by a direct interaction with the BRCA1 C-terminal domains of 
TOPBP1 to mitotic DSBs, where it mediates joining of broken DNA ends. Loss of 
Polθ leads to defective repair of mitotic DSBs, resulting in a loss of genome 
integrity. This is further exacerbated in cells that are deficient in homologous 
recombination, where loss of mitotic DSB repair by Polθ results in cell death. 
Our results identify mitotic DSB repair as the underlying cause of synthetic 
lethality between Polθ and homologous recombination. Together, our findings 
reveal the critical importance of mitotic DSB repair in the maintenance of 
genome integrity.
