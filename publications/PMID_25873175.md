Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-α inhibitors have shown clinical activity in 
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of head and neck (H&N) bearing PIK3CA mutations 
or amplification. Studying models of therapeutic resistance, we have observed 
that SCC cells that become refractory to PI3Kα inhibition maintain 
PI3K-independent activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This 
persistent mTOR activation is mediated by the tyrosine kinase receptor AXL. AXL 
is overexpressed in resistant tumors from both laboratory models and patients 
treated with the PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719. AXL dimerizes with and phosphorylates 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in activation of 
phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)-protein kinase C (PKC), which, in turn, activates mTOR. 
Combined treatment with PI3Kα and either EGFR, AXL, or PKC inhibitors reverts 
this resistance.

Introduction

H&N and esophageal SCCs are among the most common types of cancer with an annual worldwide incidence rate of approximately 600,000 and 400,000, respectively ( Jemal et al., 2011 ). Despite the efforts to improve their outcome, the 5-year survival rate is only ∼50% in H&N and ∼10% in esophageal cancer ( Jemal et al., 2011 ; Kamangar et al., 2006 ). Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the EGFR, is currently the only approved targeted agent for the therapy of H&NSCC, with only a modest improvement in the overall survival of these patients ( Baselga et al., 2005 ; Bonner et al., 2006 ; Vermorken et al., 2008 ). No targeted therapy is currently available for esophageal SCC.

The PI3K pathway plays a key role in the regulation of multiple cellular events, including cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle progression, and survival ( Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002 ). The PI3K family of enzymes is divided into three main classes (classes I to III), with class I being the most often implicated in human cancer ( Engelman, 2009 ; Hennessy et al., 2005 ). Class I PI3K is comprised of a regulatory subunit (p85), which mediates binding to membrane growth factor receptors, and one of four catalytic subunits (p110α, β, γ or δ), which are responsible for the activity of the enzyme ( Engelman, 2009 ). Activating mutations of PI3KCA have been found in 6 to 20% of H&N and 4–10 % of esophageal SCC, with the hot spot E542K, E545K and H1047R substitutions being the most common ( Agrawal et al., 2011 ; Lui et al., 2013 ; Song et al., 2014 ; Stransky et al., 2011 ). Moreover, increase in PIK3CA copy number has been found in up to 30% of H&N and 40% of esophageal tumors and is associated with poor prognosis ( Agrawal et al., 2011 ; Akagi et al., 2009 ; Lin et al., 2014 ; Song et al., 2014 ; Stransky et al., 2011 ; Suda et al., 2012 ).

Tumors with activating alterations in PIK3CA are more responsive to therapy with specific PI3Kα inhibitors ( Elkabets et al., 2013 ; Fritsch et al., 2014 ; Furet et al., 2013 ). In the first-in-human clinical trial of the PI3Kα specific inhibitor BYL719 in solid tumors ( NCT01387321 ), we have recently reported that eight patients with H&N tumors harboring PI3KCA mutations had a clinical response to therapy (Juric et al., unpublished results). These are encouraging early results and support the clinical development of these agents in patients with H&N SCC tumors. Given the similarities between H&N and esophageal SCCs, this approach should also be explored in esophageal SCC. However, as with other targeted therapies, we can anticipate that their efficacy will be limited by the development of acquired resistance. In fact, all the responding patients in our clinical trial with BYL719 became eventually refractory to treatment. In this work we investigated the primary and acquired mechanisms of resistance to PI3Kα inhibitors in H&N and esophageal SCC tumors. Our ultimate goal was to design treatment strategies that could prevent or delay the appearance of resistance and that would be potentially applicable to the treatment of patients.

Discussion

In this work we show that H&N and esophageal SCCs escape the antitumor activity of PI3Kα inhibition via up-regulation of AXL and consequent increase in AXL-EGFR interaction that, subsequently, initiates the PLCγ-PKC signaling cascade. The activation of this pathway sustains mTOR activity in the presence of PI3K/AKT inhibition and is prevented by direct inhibition of either EGFR/AXL upstream or PKC downstream activity. We recently reported that residual mTOR activation upon PI3Kα inhibition is sufficient to limit its antitumor activity also in breast cancer ( Elkabets et al., 2013 ), suggesting that this may be a shared feature of PI3Kα resistance. However, we suspect that the mechanisms adopted by cancer cells to bypass PI3K/AKT inhibition and maintain mTOR activation are cancer lineage dependent. AXL is a ubiquitously expressed receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the TAM family of receptors (including also TYRO and MER)( Graham et al., 2014 ). When overexpressed, AXL is capable of transforming fibroblasts and promote xenograft growth of various human cancers ( Holland et al., 2005 ; Janssen et al., 1991 ). Moreover, expression of AXL has been shown to induce resistance to targeted agents such as the EGFR/HER2 inhibitors lapatinib, erlotinib and cetuximab by re-activating the AKT, ERK and NF-KB pathways in breast, lung and H&N cancers ( Brand et al., 2014a ; Giles et al., 2013 ; Liu et al., 2009 ; Zhang et al., 2012 ). Here we show that in cell lines, xenograft models and in tumors from SCC patients treated with BYL719, AXL is up-regulated in primary and acquired resistance states.

In our models AXL seems to induce a re-wiring of the EGFR signaling towards the PLCγ-PKC axis by receptor phosphorylation at tyrosine 1173. The specificity of this activation is underscored by the fact that either knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of AXL was sufficient to decrease phosphorylation of this residue in our models. This findings is in accordance with a recent report showing increased phosphorylation of this tyrosine residue in H&N cells with acquired resistance to cetuximab and overexpressing AXL (Brand et al., 2014b). Based on our findings, it is also tempting to speculate that other cancer types characterized by EGFR dependency, such as colon or lung, may adopt a similar mechanism to escape PI3Kα inhibition. Likewise, these tumors may be exquisitely sensitive to dual PI3Kα and EGFR suppression.

It remains to be elucidated whether upfront treatment with dual PI3K and EGFR inhibitors would avoid AXL overexpression and prevent or delay the emergence of resistance. The combination of BYL719 and cetuximab is currently being tested in head and neck cancer patients (Razak et al., unpublished results). Interim results from this pilot study were recently presented and a clinical benefit rate of 28% (4 partial responses and 5 stable diseases out of 32 patients) was reported. However, presence of PIK3CA alterations was not required for patient enrollment (unlike the first-in-man phase I clinical trial (Juric et al., unpublished results), and the status of AXL expression in these tumors has not been reported.

In summary, our study indicates that an AXL-EGFR interaction mediates resistance to PI3Kα inhibition by shifting EGFR signaling toward the PLCγ-PKC axis that maintain mTOR activity in a PI3K/AKT independent fashion. As a result, we propose simultaneous EGFR and PI3Kα blockade as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance to PI3Kα inhibitors in patients with SCC of head and neck and esophagus.
