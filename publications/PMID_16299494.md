One of the earliest marks of a double-strand break (DSB) in eukaryotes is serine 
phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX at the carboxy-terminal SQE motif to 
create gammaH2AX-containing nucleosomes. Budding-yeast histone H2A is 
phosphorylated in a similar manner by the checkpoint kinases Tel1 and Mec1 (ref. 
2; orthologous to mammalian ATM and ATR, respectively) over a 50-kilobase region 
surrounding the DSB. This modification is important for recruiting numerous 
DSB-recognition and repair factors to the break site, including DNA damage 
checkpoint proteins, chromatin remodellers and cohesins. Multiple mechanisms for 
eliminating gammaH2AX as DNA repair completes are possible, including removal by 
histone exchange followed potentially by degradation, or, alternatively, 
dephosphorylation. Here we describe a three-protein complex (HTP-C, for histone 
H2A phosphatase complex) containing the phosphatase Pph3 that regulates the 
phosphorylation status of gammaH2AX in vivo and efficiently dephosphorylates 
gammaH2AX in vitro. gammaH2AX is lost from chromatin surrounding a DSB 
independently of the HTP-C, indicating that the phosphatase targets gammaH2AX 
after its displacement from DNA. The dephosphorylation of gammaH2AX by the HTP-C 
is necessary for efficient recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint.
