The ability of histone chaperone Anti-silencing factor 1 (Asf1) to direct 
acetylation of lysine 56 of histone H3 (H3K56ac) represents an important 
regulatory step in genome replication and DNA repair. In Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, Asf1 interacts functionally with a second chaperone, Vps75, and the 
lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) Rtt109. Both Asf1 and Vps75 can increase the 
specificity of histone acetylation by Rtt109, but neither alter selectivity. 
However, changes in acetylation selectivity have been observed in histones 
extracted from cells, which contain a plethora of post-translational 
modifications. In the present study, we use a series of singly acetylated 
histones to test the hypothesis that histone pre-acetylation and histone 
chaperones function together to drive preferential acetylation of H3K56. We show 
that pre-acetylated H3K14ac/H4 functions with Asf1 to drive specific acetylation 
of H3K56 by Rtt109-Vps75. Additionally, we identified an exosite containing an 
acidic patch in Asf1 and show that mutations to this region alter Asf1-mediated 
crosstalk that changes Rtt109-Vps75 selectivity. Our proposed mechanism suggests 
that Gcn5 acetylates H3K14, recruiting remodeler complexes, allowing for the 
Asf1-H3K14ac/H4 complex to be acetylated at H3K56 by Rtt109-Vps75. This 
mechanism explains the conflicting biochemical data and the genetic links 
between Rtt109, Vps75, Gcn5 and Asf1 in the acetylation of H3K56.
