An orphan receptor of ligand-gated ion-channel type (L2, also termed ZAC 
according to the presence of zinc ion for channel activation) was identified by 
computer-assisted search programs on human genome database. The L2 protein 
shares partial homology with serotonin receptors 5HT3A and 5HT3B. We have cloned 
L2 cDNA derived from human caudate nucleus and characterized the exon-intron 
structure as follows: (1) The L2 protein has four transmembrane regions (M1-M4) 
and a long cytoplasmic loop between M3 and M4. (2) The sequence is conserved in 
species including chimpanzee, dog, cow, and opossum. (3) Nine exons form its 
protein-coding region and especially exon 5 corresponds to a disulfide bond 
region on the amino-terminal side. Our analysis using multiple tissue cDNA 
panels revealed that at least two splicing variants of L2 mRNA are present. The 
cDNA PCR amplification study revealed that L2 mRNA is expressed in tissues 
including brain, pancreas, liver, lung, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle while 
5HT3A mRNA could be detected in brain, heart, placenta, lung, kidney, pancreas, 
and skeletal muscle, and 5HT3B mRNA in brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle, 
suggesting different significance in tissue expression of these receptors. 
Regional expression of L2 mRNA and protein was examined in brain. The RT-PCR 
studies confirmed L2 mRNA expression in hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and 
thalamus in adult brain. The L2 protein was immunolocalized by using antipeptide 
antibodies. Immunostained tissue sections revealed that L2-like immunoreactivity 
was dominantly expressed in the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells and in the 
polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. We analyzed the expression of L2 protein 
in HEK293 cells using GFP fusion protein reporter system. Western blots revealed 
that L2 protein confers sugar chains on the extracellular side. In transfected 
HEK293 cells, cellular membranes and intracellular puncta were densely labeled 
with GFP, suggesting selective dispatch to the final destination.
