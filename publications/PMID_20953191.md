Hsp70-Hsp40-NEF and possibly Hsp100 are the only known molecular chaperones that 
can use the energy of ATP to convert stably pre-aggregated polypeptides into 
natively refolded proteins. However, the kinetic parameters and ATP costs have 
remained elusive because refolding reactions have only been successful with a 
molar excess of chaperones over their polypeptide substrates. Here we describe a 
stable, misfolded luciferase species that can be efficiently renatured by 
substoichiometric amounts of bacterial Hsp70-Hsp40-NEF. The reactivation rates 
increased with substrate concentration and followed saturation kinetics, thus 
allowing the determination of apparent V(max)' and K(m)' values for a 
chaperone-mediated renaturation reaction for the first time. Under the in vitro 
conditions used, one Hsp70 molecule consumed five ATPs to effectively unfold a 
single misfolded protein into an intermediate that, upon chaperone dissociation, 
spontaneously refolded to the native state, a process with an ATP cost a 
thousand times lower than expected for protein degradation and resynthesis.
