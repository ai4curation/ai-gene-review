Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a commonly inherited 
renal disorder caused by defects in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. ADPKD is associated 
with significant morbidity, and is a major underlying cause of end-stage renal 
failure (ESRF). Commonly, treatment options are limited to the management of 
hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, dialysis, and transplantation when 
ESRF develops, although several new pharmacotherapies, including rapamycin, have 
shown early promise in animal and human studies. Evidence implicates 
polycystin-1 (PC-1), the gene product of the PKD1 gene, in regulation of the 
mTOR pathway. Here we demonstrate a mechanism by which the intracellular, 
carboxy-terminal tail of polycystin-1 (CP1) regulates mTOR signaling by altering 
the subcellular localization of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) tumor 
suppressor, a gatekeeper for mTOR activity. Phosphorylation of TSC2 at S939 by 
AKT causes partitioning of TSC2 away from the membrane, its GAP target Rheb, and 
its activating partner TSC1 to the cytosol via 14-3-3 protein binding. We found 
that TSC2 and a C-terminal polycystin-1 peptide (CP1) directly interact and that 
a membrane-tethered CP1 protects TSC2 from AKT phosphorylation at S939, 
retaining TSC2 at the membrane to inhibit the mTOR pathway. CP1 decreased 
binding of 14-3-3 proteins to TSC2 and increased the interaction between TSC2 
and its activating partner TSC1. Interestingly, while membrane tethering of CP1 
was required to activate TSC2 and repress mTOR, the ability of CP1 to inhibit 
mTOR signaling did not require primary cilia and was independent of AMPK 
activation. These data identify a unique mechanism for modulation of TSC2 
repression of mTOR signaling via membrane retention of this tumor suppressor, 
and identify PC-1 as a regulator of this downstream component of the PI3K 
signaling cascade.
