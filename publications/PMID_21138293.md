Interfacial electron transfer has been shown to occur between sorbed Fe(II) and 
structural Fe(III) in Fe oxides, but it is unknown whether a similar reaction 
occurs between sorbed Fe(II) and Fe(III)-bearing clay minerals. Here, we used 
the isotopic specificity of (57)Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy to demonstrate 
electron transfer between sorbed Fe(II) and structural Fe(III) in an Fe-bearing 
smectite clay mineral (NAu-2, nontronite). Mössbauer spectra of NAu-2 reacted 
with aqueous (56)Fe(II) (which is invisible to (57)Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy) 
showed direct evidence for reduction of NAu-2 by sorbed Fe(II). Mössbauer 
spectra using aqueous (57)Fe(II) showed that sorbed Fe(II) is oxidized upon 
sorption to the clay and pXRD patterns indicate that the oxidation product is 
lepidocrocite. Spectra collected at different temperatures indicate that 
reduction of structural Fe(III) by sorbed Fe(II) induces electron delocalization 
in the clay structure. Our results also imply that interpretation of room 
temperature and 77 K Mössbauer spectra may significantly underestimate the 
amount of Fe(II) in Fe-bearing clays. These findings provide compelling evidence 
for abiotic reduction of Fe-bearing clay minerals by sorbed Fe(II), and require 
us to reframe our conceptual model for interpreting biological reduction of clay 
minerals, as well as contaminant reduction by reduced clays.
