The histone chaperone Vps75 presents the remarkable property of stimulating the 
Rtt109-dependent acetylation of several histone H3 lysine residues within 
(H3-H4)(2) tetramers. To investigate this activation mechanism, we determined 
x-ray structures of full-length Vps75 in complex with full-length Rtt109 in two 
crystal forms. Both structures show similar asymmetric assemblies of a Vps75 
dimer bound to an Rtt109 monomer. In the Vps75-Rtt109 complexes, the catalytic 
site of Rtt109 is confined to an enclosed space that can accommodate the 
N-terminal tail of histone H3 in (H3-H4)(2). Investigation of 
Vps75-Rtt109-(H3-H4)(2) and Vps75-(H3-H4)(2) complexes by NMR 
spectroscopy-probed hydrogen/deuterium exchange suggests that Vps75 guides 
histone H3 in the catalytic enclosure. These findings clarify the basis for the 
enhanced acetylation of histone H3 tail residues by Vps75-Rtt109.
