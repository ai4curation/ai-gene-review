B and T lymphocytes express receptors providing positive and negative 
co-stimulatory signals. We recently identified a novel co-stimulatory molecule, 
B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), which exerts inhibitory effects on B and T 
lymphocytes. The cytoplasmic domain of murine and human BTLA share three 
conserved tyrosine-based signaling motifs, a Grb-2 recognition consensus, and 
two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). Phosphorylation of 
the cytoplasmic domain of BTLA induced the association with the protein tyrosine 
phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. Association of SHP-1 and SHP-2 to other receptors 
can involve recruitment to either a single receptor ITIM or to two receptor 
ITIMs. Here, we analyzed the requirements of BTLA interaction with SHP-1 and 
SHP-2 in a series of murine and human BTLA mutants. For human BTLA, mutations of 
either Y257 or Y282, but not Y226, abrogated association with both SHP-1 and 
SHP-2. For murine BTLA, mutation of either Y274 or Y299, but not Y245, also 
abrogated association with both SHP-1 and SHP-2. These results indicate that for 
both murine and human BTLA, association with SHP-1 or SHP-2 requires both of 
conserved ITIM motifs and does not involve the conserved Grb-2 consensus. Thus, 
similar to the bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif (BTAM) by which the 
Grb-2 associated binder (Gab1), PDGF receptor, and PECAM-1 recruit SHP-2, BTLA 
also relies on dual ITIMs for its association with the phosphatases SHP-1 and 
SHP-2.
