Lysosomes are responsible for degradation and recycling of bulky cell material, 
including accumulated misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles. 
Increasing evidence implicates lysosomal dysfunction in several 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and related 
synucleinopathies, which are characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein 
(α-syn) in Lewy bodies. Studies of lysosomal proteins linked to 
neurodegenerative disorders present an opportunity to uncover specific molecular 
mechanisms and pathways that contribute to neurodegeneration. Loss-of-function 
mutations in a lysosomal protein, ATP13A2 (PARK9), cause Kufor-Rakeb syndrome 
that is characterized by early-onset parkinsonism, pyramidal degeneration and 
dementia. While loss of ATP13A2 function plays a role in α-syn misfolding and 
toxicity, the normal function of ATP13A2 in the brain remains largely unknown. 
Here, we performed a screen to identify ATP13A2 interacting partners, as a first 
step toward elucidating its function. Utilizing a split-ubiquitin membrane yeast 
two-hybrid system that was developed to identify interacting partners of 
full-length integral membrane proteins, we identified 43 novel interactors that 
primarily implicate ATP13A2 in cellular processes such as endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) translocation, ER-to-Golgi trafficking and vesicular transport and fusion. 
We showed that a subset of these interactors modified α-syn aggregation and 
α-syn-mediated degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans, 
further suggesting that ATP13A2 and α-syn are functionally linked in 
neurodegeneration. These results implicate ATP13A2 in vesicular trafficking and 
provide a platform for further studies of ATP13A2 in neurodegeneration.
