Little is known about the mechanism of mitochondrial division. We show here that 
mitochondria are disrupted by mutations in a C. elegans dynamin-related protein 
(DRP-1). Mutant DRP-1 causes the mitochondrial matrix to retract into large 
blebs that are both surrounded and connected by tubules of outer membrane. This 
indicates that scission of the mitochondrial outer membrane is inhibited, while 
scission of the inner membrane still occurs. Overexpressed wild-type DRP-1 
causes mitochondria to become excessively fragmented, consistent with an active 
role in mitochondrial scission. DRP-1 fused to GFP is observed in spots on 
mitochondria where scission eventually occurs. These data indicate that 
wild-type DRP-1 contributes to the final stages of mitochondrial division by 
controlling scission of the mitochondrial outer membrane.
