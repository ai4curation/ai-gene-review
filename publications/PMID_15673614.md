Adult myoblasts retain plasticity in developmental potential and can be induced 
to undergo myogenic, adipogenic, or osteoblastogenic differentiation in vitro. 
In this report, we show that the balance between myogenic and adipogenic 
potential in myoblasts is controlled by Wnt signaling. Furthermore, this balance 
is altered during aging such that aspects of both differentiation programs are 
coexpressed in myoblasts due to decreased Wnt10b abundance. Mimicking Wnt 
signaling in aged myoblasts through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase or 
through overexpression of Wnt10b resulted in inhibition of adipogenic gene 
expression and sustained or enhanced myogenic differentiation. On the other 
hand, myoblasts isolated from Wnt10b null mice showed increased adipogenic 
potential, likely contributing to excessive lipid accumulation in actively 
regenerating myofibers in vivo in Wnt10b-/- mice. Whereas Wnt10b deficiency 
contributed to increased adipogenic potential in myoblasts, the augmented 
myogenic differentiation potential observed is likely the result of a 
compensatory increase in Wnt7b during differentiation of Wnt10b-/- myoblasts. No 
such compensation was apparent in aged myoblasts and in fact, both Wnt5b and 
Wnt10b were down-regulated. Thus, alteration in Wnt signaling in myoblasts with 
age may contribute to impaired muscle regenerative capacity and to increased 
muscle adiposity, both characteristic of aged muscle.

Abstract

Adult myoblasts retain plasticity in developmental potential and can be induced to undergo myogenic, adipogenic, or osteoblastogenic differentiation in vitro. In this report, we show that the balance between myogenic and adipogenic potential in myoblasts is controlled by Wnt signaling. Furthermore, this balance is altered during aging such that aspects of both differentiation programs are coexpressed in myoblasts due to decreased Wnt10b abundance. Mimicking Wnt signaling in aged myoblasts through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase or through overexpression of Wnt10b resulted in inhibition of adipogenic gene expression and sustained or enhanced myogenic differentiation. On the other hand, myoblasts isolated from Wnt10b null mice showed increased adipogenic potential, likely contributing to excessive lipid accumulation in actively regenerating myofibers in vivo in Wnt10b-/- mice. Whereas Wnt10b deficiency contributed to increased adipogenic potential in myoblasts, the augmented myogenic differentiation potential observed is likely the result of a compensatory increase in Wnt7b during differentiation of Wnt10b-/- myoblasts. No such compensation was apparent in aged myoblasts and in fact, both Wnt5b and Wnt10b were down-regulated. Thus, alteration in Wnt signaling in myoblasts with age may contribute to impaired muscle regenerative capacity and to increased muscle adiposity, both characteristic of aged muscle.

INTRODUCTION

Adult skeletal muscle has remarkable regenerative capacity, largely mediated by satellite cells that reside between the sarcolemma and basal lamina of myofibers in postnatal muscle and remain throughout adult life ( Bischoff, 1994 ). After muscle injury, satellite cells give rise to myoblasts that proliferate, migrate to the site of injury, and fuse into myofibers, thereby regenerating damaged or degenerating myofibers ( Seale and Rudnicki, 2000 ). Deficits in the regenerative process occur as a function of age, some of which may be due to a decline in myoblast proliferative capacity ( Schultz and Lipton, 1982 ; Dodson and Allen, 1987 ; Johnson and Allen, 1993 ; Renault et al ., 2000 ) or to loss of factors required for satellite cell activity ( Barton-Davis et al ., 1998 ; Conboy et al ., 2003 ). Although these deficits in myoblast activity may contribute to loss of muscle mass with age, they do not account for other features of aged muscle, in particular, increased lipid content ( Goodpaster et al ., 2001 ). We previously showed that compared with myoblasts isolated from adult mice (8 mo), those isolated from the muscle of aged mice (23 mo) showed increased expression of genes normally restricted to the adipocyte lineage ( Taylor-Jones et al ., 2002 ). Although genes involved in lipid trafficking and storage were overexpressed, a fully differentiated adipocyte phenotype is not achieved ( Guan et al ., 2002 ). Alteration of the expression and/or activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), both activators of adipocyte-specific genes ( Tontonoz et al ., 1994 ; Mandrup and Lane, 1997 ; Hamm et al ., 2001 ), was apparent as a function of age in myoblasts, potentially contributing to the increased adipogenic potential observed ( Taylor-Jones et al ., 2002 ). This is consistent with the observation that the muscle cell line C2C12 is converted to adipocytes by overexpression of PPARγ and C/EBPα ( Hu et al ., 1995 ; Rosen et al ., 2000 ). Similarly, treatment with thiazolidinediones, potent activators of PPARγ, results in induction of genes involved in fatty acid uptake, storage, and metabolism ( Teboul et al ., 1995 ; Grimaldi et al ., 1997 ).

The Wnt family of genes, encoding at least 19 lipid-modified signaling proteins ( Willert et al ., 2003 ), has been implicated in regulating both adipogenic and myogenic differentiation through the canonical β-catenin and noncanonical pathways (for review, see Huelsken and Behrens, 2002 ). In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK), leading to rapid degradation ( Kikuchi, 2000 ). Wnt ligands bind to transmembrane receptors of the Frizzled family, leading to inactivation of GSK within the complex, thereby stabilizing β-catenin, allowing translocation to the nucleus where it regulates T-cell factor (TCF)/leukocyte enhancing factor-dependent gene transcription. In the developing embryo, Wnt family members have been shown to be essential for differentiation of epaxial muscles (for review, see Buckingham et al ., 2003 ). More recently, it has been shown that different Wnts have distinct effects during limb myogenic differentiation ( Anakwe et al ., 2003 ). Moreover, Wnt5a, 5b, 7a, and 7b promote myogenic commitment in adult muscle progenitor cells ( Polesskaya et al ., 2003 ). By contrast, Wnt signaling seems to inhibit adipogenic differentiation ( Ross et al ., 2000 ; Bennett et al ., 2002 ; Moldes et al ., 2003 ; Zhou et al ., 2004 ). Blocking β-catenin activity in C2C12 cells through expression of dominant negative TCF resulted in inhibition of myogenic differentiation and activation of adipogenic differentiation ( Ross et al ., 2000 ). In particular, Wnt10b has been demonstrated to inhibit adipogenic differentiation both in C2C12 myoblasts and preadipocytes ( Ross et al ., 2000 ; Bennett et al ., 2002 ). Because Wnt10b abundance decreases in muscle as a function of age ( Taylor-Jones et al ., 2002 ), the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that altered Wnt10b activity contributes to increased intramyocellular lipid accumulation that accompanies aging. Results suggest that Wnt10b specifically controls adipogenic potential in myoblasts and regenerating muscle, whereas other Wnt family members influence myogenic potential.

RESULTS

We reported previously that adipogenic potential increases as a function of age in isolated mouse myoblasts ( Taylor-Jones et al ., 2002 ). Analysis of gene expression in myoblasts from aged (24 mo) compared with adult (8 mo) mice demonstrated that genes normally associated with adipocyte differentiation are overexpressed, including C/EBPα and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4, previously known as ap2) ( Figure 1A ). Although no difference in PPARγ2 mRNA abundance was apparent, PPARγ2 phosphorylation decreased with age ( Figure 1B ), suggesting increased activity. On the other hand, Wnt10b gene expression, which inhibits adipogenic differentiation ( Ross et al ., 2000 ; Bennett et al ., 2002 ), was down-regulated with age ( Figure 1A ), potentially contributing to increased adipogenic potential. The relative abundance of myogenic and adipogenic gene products in aged myoblasts suggested that there was coexpression of these differentiation programs. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that FABP4 was highly expressed in fully differentiated myotubes derived from aged mice, but not in myotubes from young adult mice ( Figure 1C ), confirming that both differentiation programs operate within individual cells with age. Furthermore, clonal analysis demonstrated that of the 26 clones analyzed, all underwent myogenic differentiation in low serum-containing myogenic DM and when exposed to a cocktail that promotes adipocyte differentiation in preadipocytes (IBMX), 25 of 26 were induced to express adipogenic markers, including C/EBPα, FABP4, and lipoprotein lipase as well as to accumulate lipid visualized by Oil Red O staining (our unpublished data).

To determine whether Wnt10b controls gene expression in myoblasts with age, its expression was manipulated and the effect on differentiation potential was determined ( Figure 2 ). Retroviral-mediated gene transfer of Wnt10b into aged myoblasts resulted in approximately threefold overexpression, quantified by real-time RT-PCR ( Figure 2A ). This increase was associated with increased abundance of cytosolic β-catenin to levels comparable with those observed in adult myoblasts ( Figure 2B ). Furthermore, Wnt10b overexpression led to inhibition of adipogenic gene expression, evidenced by decreased C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4 mRNA abundance ( Figure 2A ), as well as decreased Oil Red O staining compared with empty vector-infected cells ( Figure 2C ). Myogenic differentiation was not significantly affected by Wnt10b overexpression, and fully differentiated myotubes expressing myosin heavy chain were apparent irrespective of Wnt10b abundance ( Figure 2C ). Treating aged myoblasts with LiCl, which inhibits activity of GSK, thereby stabilizing β-catenin, mimicked some aspects of Wnt10b overexpression. Western blot analysis demonstrated that daily treatment with LiCl for 4 h each day for 3 d ( Figure 3A ) resulted in increased cytosolic β-catenin, which was even more stabilized if cells were exposed to LiCl chronically for 3 d ( Figure 3A , 24-h LiCl). Quantification of FABP4, C/EBPα, and PPARγ mRNA by real-time RT-PCR after chronic treatment with LiCl demonstrated that LiCl treatment decreased adipogenic gene expression ( Figure 3B ). LiCl treatment had the opposite effect on myogenic gene expression, augmenting expression of genes such as myogenin that promote myogenic differentiation ( Figure 3B ). Thus, although the canonical Wnt signaling pathway seems to promote myogenic differentiation and inhibit adipogenic differentiation in primary myoblasts, Wnt10b seems specific to the latter.

Because Wnt10b clearly inhibits adipogenic gene expression in myoblasts, we hypothesized that knocking out its expression in primary myoblasts would cause them to express an “aged” phenotype, with increased expression of markers of adipogenic differentiation. To test this hypothesis, myoblasts were isolated from mice at 9 mo of age with a deletion of the Wnt10b open reading frame (Lane and Leder, unpublished data). The most striking feature of the Wnt10b-/- myoblasts was that myogenic differentiation was significantly accelerated compared with myoblasts obtained from wild-type mice ( Figure 4 ). Within 24 h of exposure to DM massive fusion of myoblasts into large myotubes expressing myosin heavy chain was observed from knockout mice ( Figure 4A ), whereas wild-type myoblasts were just initiating myogenic differentiation ( Figure 4A ). Increased fusion in Wnt10b-/- myoblasts was apparently not due to increased follistatin production ( Iezzi et al ., 2004 ), because follistatin mRNA was expressed at slightly higher levels in wild-type compared with Wnt10b-/- myoblasts (our unpublished data). The MyoD gene was overexpressed in Wnt10b-/- myoblasts 24 h after induction of differentiation ( Figure 4B ), which may account for the increased fusion potential ( Brennan et al ., 1990 ). Transcripts encoding the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ also were overexpressed in null compared with wild-type myoblasts at this early stage of differentiation. By 72 h in DM, no difference in transcription factor gene expression was apparent between Wnt10b-/- and wild-type myotubes (our unpublished data), however, at this stage, down-stream genes, such as FABP4, were differentially expressed ( Figure 4C ).

The distinct in vitro differentiation potential of myoblasts from Wnt10b-/- mice suggested that the muscle phenotype in vivo also would be altered. Analysis of cryostat sections demonstrated no difference in muscle size or morphology between wild-type Wnt10b+/+ ( Figure 5A ) and Wnt10b-/- null mice ( Figure 5C ). To examine muscle regenerative capacity, both freeze injury and cardiotoxin injection were used to induce either localized (freeze) or widespread (cardiotoxin) muscle fiber degeneration and satellite cell activation in the tibialis anterior. Muscle regeneration in wild-type muscle was typical ( Figure 5B ), characterized by satellite cell proliferation and fusion to regenerate muscle fibers, identified by their small size and central nuclei. Muscle regeneration also proceeded efficiently in Wnt10b-/- mice ( Figure 5D ); however, areas of regeneration accumulated large amounts of lipid as detected by Oil Red O staining, whereas adjacent nonregenerating areas showed no increased lipid content. Higher magnification analysis of Wnt10b-/- mice ( Figure 6 ) showed that lipid accumulation in regenerating muscle was heterogeneous with some regenerating fibers demonstrating no accumulation, some showing small lipid inclusions ( Figure 6A ), and others becoming completely filled with lipid ( Figure 6, A and B ). Although lipid clearly accumulated in regenerating muscle fibers, small cells surrounding the fibers also were Oil Red O positive ( Figure 6A ). The location and frequency of these cells suggested they were activated satellite cells or myoblasts, verified by nuclear accumulation of myogenin ( Dupont-Versteegden et al ., 1999 ) ( Figure 7A ). Myogenin was overexpressed in regenerating muscle from Wnt10b-/- mice ( Figure 7A ), compared with wild type ( Figure 7E ), confirming in vitro findings that myogenic potential was increased in the absence of Wnt10b. Myogenic cells in Wnt10b-/- mice ( Figure 7B ) but not Wnt10b+/+ mice ( Figure 7F ) coexpressed FABP4. The nearby lipid-filled fibers in Wnt10b-/- mice ( Figure 7C ) did not survive fixation with alcohol and manifested as void volumes upon hematoxylin and eosin staining ( Figure 7D ), and immunohistochemical analysis ( Figure 7, A and B ), whereas muscle integrity was maintained through processing in Wnt10b+/+ mice ( Figure 7, E–H ). Thus, myogenic and adipogenic gene programs are simultaneously expressed in regenerating muscle from Wnt10b-/- mice. This may have functional and metabolic consequences as the adipocity in muscle is apparent even 1 mo after injury in Wnt10b-/- mice ( Figure 8 ). It should be noted that the increased adipogenic potential of regenerating muscle in vivo is only observed in Wnt10-/- mice fed a high-fat diet. Muscle regeneration in Wnt10b-/- mice maintained on a low-fat diet (our unpublished data) was indistinguishable from that observed in wild-type mice ( Figure 5B ), suggesting that a stimulus to accumulate lipid also is required.

The observations that Wnt10b-/- muscle and isolated myoblasts undergo myogenic differentiation more efficiently than those from wild-type animals, even in the face of increased adipogenic gene expression, suggest two possibilities: 1) Wnt10b normally dampens myogenic differentiation, or 2) other Wnt family member(s) that are more myogenic may be compensating for Wnt10b deficiency. That overexpression of Wnt10b in myoblasts inhibits adipogenic potential with no obvious affect on myogenic differentiation ( Figure 2 ) argues against the first possibility. Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the Wnt7b gene is overexpressed in Wnt10b-/- compared with wild-type myoblasts during the first 24 h of differentiation ( Table 1 ). This suggests that the myogenic potential of these cells is increased, because Wnt7b gene expression has been shown to increase rapidly in regenerating muscle and to induce myogenic commitment in resident muscle stem cells ( Polesskaya et al ., 2003 ). No such compensation is apparent in aged myoblasts, and in fact, both Wnt5b and Wnt10b are down-regulated as a function of age ( Table 1 ), resulting in decreased cytosolic β-catenin with age ( Figure 2B ).

To test the hypothesis that Wnt7b contributes to increased myogenic potential, Wnt7b was overexpressed in aged myoblasts by retroviral-mediated gene transfer ( Figure 9 ). Whereas Wnt7b expression had no significant affect on the adipogenic genes FABP4 ( Figure 9 ), C/EBPα, or PPARγ (our unpublished data), myogenic gene expression was dramatically increased within 24 h of exposure to DM. Thus, the compensatory increase in Wnt7b in Wnt10b-/- myoblasts leads to more robust coexpression of myogenic and adipogenic gene programs than in aged myoblasts, where low levels of Wnt10b may be permissive for expression of adipogenic genes with no augmentation of myogenic gene expression.

DISCUSSION

The loss in muscle and bone mass with age is accompanied by an increase in fat mass ( Pahor and Kritchevsky, 1998 ). Thus, aging in muscle is characterized not only by a decrease in the total number of muscle fibers and a reduced fiber cross-sectional area but also by decreased muscle density associated with increased intra- and intermuscular fat ( Porter et al ., 1995 ; Goodpaster et al ., 2001 ). These changes in body composition and tissue remodeling contribute significantly to the decline in muscle strength and function. In fact, the increase in lipid content within muscle fibers that accompanies aging may account for the observation that older subjects are weaker than one would predict based on muscle mass alone ( Kallman et al ., 1990 ). Although mechanisms underlying increased muscle adiposity during aging are relatively undefined, a substantial literature exists examining lipid content within skeletal muscle and its link to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (for review, see Kelley and Goodpaster, 2001 ; McGarry, 2002 ; Unger, 2003 ). Defects in the pathways for fatty acid oxidation leading to diminished use of fatty acids and increased esterification and storage of lipid within skeletal muscle have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance ( Bays et al ., 2004 ). Changes in fatty acid oxidation with age have been less well studied; however, availability of free fatty acids increases with age, likely contributing to increased lipid content of muscle through increased storage. Our results demonstrate that adipocyte-specific regulatory genes as well as genes involved in fatty acid trafficking are overexpressed in myoblasts from aged mice, potentially exacerbating muscle lipid accumulation with age. Other muscle degenerative processes such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( Cullen and Mastaglia, 1980 ) and denervation ( Bacou et al ., 1982 ; Dulor et al ., 1998 ) also involve increased intramyocellular lipid accumulation. Thus, we hypothesize that changes in gene expression due to altered Wnt signaling in myogenic progenitors may contribute to muscle adiposity during aging and in other pathological conditions.

Wnts have been shown previously to initiate myogenesis during development ( Munsterberg et al ., 1995 ; Stern et al ., 1995 ; Hoppler et al ., 1996 ; Ikeya and Takada, 1998 ; Tajbakhsh et al ., 1998 ; Borello et al ., 1999 ; Cossu and Borello, 1999 ; Ridgeway et al ., 2000 ) and to inhibit adipogenic differentiation ( Ross et al ., 2000 ; Bennett et al ., 2002 ). Our results demonstrate that Wnt signaling promotes myogenic and inhibits adipogenic differentiation simultaneously within primary adult myoblasts. Analysis of Wnt10b null mice suggests that Wnt10b normally represses the aberrant expression of genes involved in lipid storage in adult muscle, but this function is only apparent during muscle regeneration. Thus, upon satellite cell activation leading to expression of the myogenic differentiation program, adipogenic genes were activated in Wnt10b-/- myoblasts, leading to excessive lipid accumulation within regenerating myofibers. However, lipid in regenerating fibers was diffuse and thus may not be properly associated with lipid droplet-associated proteins for efficient utilization. In aged muscle, satellite cell activation and regeneration are ongoing due to increased susceptibility to damage and denervation ( Brooks and Faulkner, 1994 ), suggesting that loss of Wnt10b that normally occurs during aging may contribute to increased muscle adipocity with age. This increase in adipogenic potential is likely mediated by C/EBPα and PPARγ.

Other Wnt family members, in particular Wnt7b, seem to contribute to enhanced myogenic potential in Wnt10b-/- myoblasts and when overexpressed in aged myoblasts. Using gain- and loss-of-function studies, it was recently shown that different Wnt family members have distinct effects on chick limb muscle development, controlling the number of terminally differentiated cells and fiber type distribution ( Anakwe et al ., 2003 ). Because both Wnt10b and Wnt7b seem to increase cytosolic β-catenin, the mechanism underlying the specificity in response is currently unknown, but it is consistent with the observation that stabilization of β-catenin promoted myogenic differentiation and inhibited adipogenic potential in aged myoblasts. Clearly, the regulation of differentiation potential in myoblasts by β-catenin is complex ( Goichberg et al ., 2001 ; Martin et al ., 2002 ), and we cannot rule out the possibility that Wnt10b and Wnt7b also differentially affect noncanonical signaling pathways ( Nelson and Nusse, 2004 ). This is supported by the observation that the abundance of cytosolic β-catenin was not consistently different between myoblasts from wild-type and null mice (our unpublished data). The compensatory increase in other Wnt family members in response to decreased Wnt10b did not occur in aged myoblasts, suggesting that alterations in Wnt signaling may contribute to both decreased regenerative potential and increased adiposity in muscle as a function of age.

That myoblasts can be induced to undergo adipogenic differentiation has been demonstrated in several different experimental paradigms in vitro. Enhancing PPARγ activity by treatment with thiazolidinediones, synthetic ligands for PPARγ, has been reported to convert C2C12 cells to adipocytes ( Teboul et al ., 1995 ; Grimaldi et al ., 1997 ). Thiazolidinediones alone did not enhance adipogenic potential in primary mouse myoblasts ( Taylor-Jones et al ., 2002 ), suggesting that additional events may be required, such as inhibition of the p38 pathway ( Yeow et al ., 2001 ), or decrease in Wnt10b abundance that occurs in myoblasts with age. Thus, in aged mice and high-fat–fed Wnt null mice, abundant free fatty acid derivatives may act as natural ligands for PPARγ enhancing the adipogenic potential of myoblasts in vivo. Moreover, aged muscle is a more oxidized environment with ongoing denervation, both of which have been shown to augment adipogenesis in isolated myoblasts and muscle ( Dulor et al ., 1998 ; Csete et al ., 2001 ). Together, these results suggest that during aging, altered Wnt signaling may combine with the effects of elevated circulating oxidized free fatty acids and ongoing denervation/regeneration to lead to the expression of genes that promote lipid storage in muscle.
