Trichosanthin is a ribosome-inactivating protein with multiple pharmacological 
properties. By a yeast two-hybrid system, ribosomal phosphoproteins P0 and P1 
and a putative mitotic checkpoint protein, MAD2B, were found to interact with an 
active-site mutated trichosanthin (TCS). The interactions were verified by an in 
vitro binding assay of recombinant wild-type TCS and target proteins. The 
interaction domain of P0 was mapped to amino acids 220-273, which had been 
previously reported to be involved in the interaction with P1 and P2 in yeast. 
Consistent with our previous finding that the last seven residues of TCS are not 
essential for an active conformation, the same deletion did not affect the 
interaction with P0. Our present study suggests that TCS may disrupt the binding 
of elongation factors to the P-complex, in addition to the well-known 
N-glycosidase activity for ribosome inactivation.
