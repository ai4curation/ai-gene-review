PDGF may be involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders including 
atherosclerosis and certain types of cancer. There is currently little 
understanding of the molecular structure of PDGF and of the critical amino acid 
residues involved in receptor binding and cell activation. Two such PDGF-B chain 
residues, arginine 27 and isoleucine 30, have been identified by a site-directed 
mutagenesis programme. Substitutions in these positions can lead to PDGF mutants 
defective in both receptor affinity and cell activation as judged by 
displacement of [125I]PDGF-BB, mitogenic assay and inositol lipid turnover. 
Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy show that such mutations do not 
disrupt the structure of PDGF.
