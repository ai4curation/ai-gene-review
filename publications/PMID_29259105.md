Multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) are evolutionarily 
conserved in eukaryotic organisms and may function as signaling molecules that 
mediate trafficking of other regulators. Although there are a large number of 
MCTPs found in the plant lineage, biological information on most plant MCTPs 
remains unknown. Here, we report systematic characterization of 16 members in 
the entire Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) MCTP family. Using GUS and GFP 
reporter assays, we reveal their distinct or overlapping patterns of gene 
expression and protein localization in developing Arabidopsis plants and 
Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells. We further analyze in vivo effects 
of three C2 domains on the regulatory role of MCTP1 (FTIP1) in flowering time 
control in Arabidopsis, demonstrating that these C2 domains may be cooperative 
to mediate FTIP1 function during the floral transition. Through examining all 
available T-DNA insertional mutants of Arabidopsis MCTPs, we further reveal that 
mctp6-1 significantly enhances the late-flowering phenotype of ftip1-1 possibly 
through affecting FLOWERING LOCUS T in different manners, exemplifying that 
different MCTPs additively regulate a specific plant developmental process. 
Taken together, our results suggest functional divergence or redundancy of MCTP 
members in Arabidopsis and provide a community resource for further 
understanding various MCTP functions in plant development.

Abstract

Multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotic organisms and may function as signaling molecules that mediate trafficking of other regulators. Although there are a large number of MCTPs found in the plant lineage, biological information on most plant MCTPs remains unknown. Here, we report systematic characterization of 16 members in the entire Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) MCTP family. Using GUS and GFP reporter assays, we reveal their distinct or overlapping patterns of gene expression and protein localization in developing Arabidopsis plants and Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells. We further analyze in vivo effects of three C2 domains on the regulatory role of MCTP1 (FTIP1) in flowering time control in Arabidopsis, demonstrating that these C2 domains may be cooperative to mediate FTIP1 function during the floral transition. Through examining all available T-DNA insertional mutants of Arabidopsis MCTPs , we further reveal that mctp6-1 significantly enhances the late-flowering phenotype of ftip1-1 possibly through affecting FLOWERING LOCUS T in different manners, exemplifying that different MCTPs additively regulate a specific plant developmental process. Taken together, our results suggest functional divergence or redundancy of MCTP members in Arabidopsis and provide a community resource for further understanding various MCTP functions in plant development.

DISCUSSION

Proteins containing multiple C2 domains and transmembrane region(s) are evolutionarily conserved and divided into four subgroups, including synaptotagmins, ferlins, tricalbins, and MCTPs, based on the number of C2 domains and the location of transmembrane region(s) ( Lek et al., 2012 ). Although there are only a limited number of MCTPs, each containing three to four C2 domains at the N terminus and one to four transmembrane regions at the C terminus, in unicellular ancestors and animals, the number of MCTPs is significantly increased in higher plants ( Fig. 2 ; Supplemental Fig. S5 ; Nalefski and Falke, 1996 ; Shin et al., 2005 ; Lek et al., 2012 ; Liu et al., 2013 ). This may cater to the requirement of more functionally specific MCTPs to mediate plant response to changing internal or environmental stimuli. Although a few plant MCTPs have been shown to be involved in membrane trafficking and fusion processes ( Fulton et al., 2009 ; Liu et al., 2012 , 2013 ; Vaddepalli et al., 2014 ; Song et al., 2017 ), biological information on most of plant MCTPs remains unknown.

In this study, we have systematically characterized 16 MCTPs in Arabidopsis, which are grouped into five clades based on the phylogenetic analysis ( Fig. 1 ). Examination of the GUS reporter lines driven by the 5′ upstream sequences of these MCTPs has revealed that none of the pMCTP:GUS reporter lines exhibit exactly the same GUS staining patterns at both vegetative and reproductive tissues. Notably, 5′ upstream sequences of MCTPs even in the same clades often drive GUS expression with distinct patterns in various tissues. For example, while MCTP1 ( FTIP1 ) and MCTP2 lines generally exhibit GUS staining in vascular tissues, their distribution patterns in vegetative or reproductive tissues are different. In the aerial part of vegetative seedlings, GUS activity is uniformly detected in vascular tissues of cotyledons and rosette leaves of the MCTP1 ( FTIP1 ) line ( Fig. 3A ), whereas GUS staining of the MCTP2 line is obvious in primary veins ( Fig. 3B ). In roots, although GUS activity is detectable in vascular tissues of both MCTP1 ( FTIP1 ) and MCTP2 lines, the MCTP1 ( FTIP1 ) line displays stronger GUS staining in the elongation zone than the MCTP2 line ( Fig. 4, A and B ). However, in the root meristematic zone, GUS staining completely disappears in the MCTP1 ( FTIP1 ) line but is obvious in the MCTP2 line ( Fig. 4, A and B ). These different expression patterns indicate that even MCTPs sharing high sequence similarity might be differentially regulated to play distinct roles in various tissues. This is further substantiated by distinct subcellular localization patterns of GFP-MCTPs revealed in N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells ( Fig. 7 ).

Despite differential GUS expression patterns driven by the 5′ upstream sequences of different MCTPs , some pMCTP:GUS reporter lines display overlapping GUS activity in specific tissues. For example, MCTP1 ( FTIP1 ), MCTP2 , MCTP3 , MCTP6 , MCTP15 ( QKY ), and MCTP16 lines all exhibit GUS activity in vascular tissues of vegetative seedlings, albeit to different extents ( Fig. 3, A–C, F, O, and P ), implying that some MCTPs may act redundantly or additively in specific tissues during Arabidopsis development. Similarly, comparable subcellular localization exhibited by some MCTPs also indicates that some of them may participate redundantly or additively in similar cellular processes ( Fig. 7 ). Thus, distinct or overlapping patterns of gene expression and subcellular localization revealed by our GUS and GFP reporter assays could be further investigated to explore functional divergence or redundancy of MCTP members in Arabidopsis.

The presence of multiple C2 domains at the N terminus is a signature feature of MCTPs, but their concrete functions in MCTPs remain unknown. Characterization of multiple C2 domains in MCTP1 (FTIP1) in this study has revealed specific roles of each C2 domain in FTIP1 ( Figs. 8 and 9 ). Deletion of each C2 domain in FTIP1 almost completely compromises FTIP1 role in promoting flowering, suggesting that all the three C2 domains are required for FTIP1 function in the control of flowering time in Arabidopsis. Notably, the third C2 domain is specifically required for FTIP1 interaction with FT, while the second C2 domain, together with the C-terminal transmembrane region, is essential for MCTP1 (FTIP1) localization into the ER network. Since C2 domain has been suggested to act as a docking module targeting proteins to specific intracellular membrane ( Nalefski and Falke, 1996 ), our findings suggest that multiple C2 domains in MCTPs may be cooperative to play an important role in mediating MCTP interaction with target protein(s), their subcellular localization, and subsequent biological effects.

Through examining the available T-DNA insertional lines for 15 Arabidopsis MCTPs , we have found that most of these lines do not display obvious defects under our growth conditions, implying possible functional redundancy among these MCTPs . Three T-DNA insertional lines, including mctp1-1 ( ftip1-1 ) ( Liu et al., 2012 ), mctp15 ( qky-14 ) ( Trehin et al., 2013 ), and mctp6-1 , show the late-flowering phenotype ( Fig. 10, A–D ), suggesting that FTIP1, QKY, and MCTP6 are individually required for promoting flowering. Several pieces of evidence indicate that FTIP1 and MCTP6 affect flowering time in different manners. First, their gene expression patterns in tissues are fundamentally different. FTIP1 is specifically expressed in vascular tissues of cotyledons and rosette leaves, but not in the shoot apex ( Liu et al., 2012 ; Fig. 3A ), whereas MCTP6 is expressed in the shoot apex and early detected in whole protruding young leaves ( Fig. 3F ). Second, MCTP6 expression shows an obvious circadian rhythm under long days ( Fig. 10E ), which is in contrast to the nonrhythmic pattern of FTIP1 ( Liu et al., 2012 ), indicating that they may respond differently to the photoperiod signal. Third, the subcellular localization patterns of FTIP1 and MCTP6 are also different. FTIP1 is associated with the ER network, whereas MCTP6 is mainly in intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane ( Fig. 7, A and F ). These observations suggest that FTIP1 and MCTP6 contribute to flowering time control in different ways at both cellular and tissue levels. Consistently, mctp6-1 significantly enhances the late-flowering phenotype of ftip1-1 under long days ( Fig. 10, C and D ). Despite these differences, FTIP1 and MCTP6 do share some common characteristics, such as interaction with FT, localization in plasmodesmata, and functioning in the photoperiod pathway. Thus, it will be interesting to further investigate their roles in the floral transition to understand whether these two MCTPs could play either simple additive or more complex cooperative roles in affecting FT.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our systematic analysis of 16 genes in the entire Arabidopsis MCTP family illustrates their complex gene expression and protein localization patterns in Arabidopsis. Through examining the roles of multiple C2 domains in FTIP1, we show that these signature domains in MCTPs may be cooperative to mediate MCTP function in plant development. In addition, various MCTPs, such as FTIP1 and MCTP6, could act in different manners to affect the same target to regulate a specific developmental process. Taken together, our findings reveal potential functional divergence or redundancy of MCTP members in Arabidopsis and establish a community resource for further mechanistic understanding MCTP function in plants.
