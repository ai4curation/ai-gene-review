As revealed by intracellular pools of nonactive Fas (Apo-1), export of Fas to 
the cell surface is often impaired in human tumors, thereby inactivating Fas 
ligand-mediated apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that association with 
Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (FAP-1) attenuates Fas export to the cell surface. 
Forced expression of FAP-1 reduces cell surface Fas levels and increases the 
intracellular pool of Fas within the cytoskeleton network. Conversely, 
expression of dominant-negative forms of FAP-1, or inhibition of FAP-1 
expression by short interfering RNA, efficiently up-regulates surface expression 
of Fas. Inhibition of Fas surface expression by FAP-1 depends on its association 
with the C terminus of Fas. Mutation within amino acid 275 results in decreased 
association with FAP-1 and greater export of Fas to the cell surface in 
melanomas, normal fibroblasts, or Fas null cells. Identifying the role of FAP-1 
in binding to, and consequently inhibition of, Fas export to the cell surface 
provides novel insight into the mechanism underlying the regulation of Fas 
trafficking, which is commonly impaired in advanced tumors with FAP-1 
overexpression.
