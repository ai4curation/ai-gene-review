The TAR DNA-binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43) has been identified as the main 
component of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cytoplasmic inclusions. The 
link between this proteinopathy and TDP-43's intrinsically disordered C-terminal 
domain is well known, but recently also, this domain has been shown to be 
involved in the formation of the membraneless organelles that mediate TDP-43's 
functions. The mechanisms that underpin the liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) of these membraneless organelles undergo remain elusive. Crucially 
though, these factors may be the key to understanding the delicate balance 
between TDP-43's physiological and pathological functions. In this study, we 
used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and optical methods to demonstrate 
that an α-helical component in the centre (residues 320-340) of the C-terminal 
domain is related to the protein's self-association and LLPS. Systematically 
analysing ALS-related TDP-43 mutants (G298S, M337V, and Q331K) in different 
buffer conditions at different temperatures, we prove that this phase separation 
is driven by hydrophobic interactions but is inhibited by electrostatic 
repulsion. Based on these findings, we rationally introduced a mutant, W334G, 
and demonstrate that this mutant disrupts LLPS without disturbing this α-helical 
propensity. This tryptophan may serve as a key residue in this protein's LLPS.
