RATIONALE: Arterial remodeling-a hallmark of many cardiovascular pathologies 
including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-is regulated by TGFβ1 
(transforming growth factor-β1)-TGFβ receptors and the antagonistic, 
vasoprotective BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2)-PPARγ (peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-γ) axis. However, it is unclear which factors 
drive detrimental TGFβ1 pathways in the hypertensive pulmonary vasculature.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 1) expression is decreased in PAH, leading to enhancement 
(disinhibition) of TGFβ1 signals and that the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone can 
restore vascular homeostasis and prevent PAH resulting from LRP1 deletion in 
vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Targeted deletion of LRP1 in vascular SMC (smLRP1-/-) in 
mice disinhibited TGFβ1-CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) signaling, 
leading to spontaneous PAH and distal pulmonary arterial muscularization as 
assessed by closed-chest cardiac catheterization and anti-αSMA staining. 
Pioglitazone inhibited the canonical TGFβ1-CTGF axis in human pulmonary artery 
SMC and smLRP1-/- main pulmonary artery (CTGF and NOX4) and reversed PAH in 
smLRP1-/- mice. TGFβ1 boosted pSmad3 in PASMC from smLRP1-/- mice versus 
controls. Pioglitazone-activated PPARγ binds to Smad3 in human pulmonary artery 
SMC (coimmunoprecipitation), thereby blocking its phosphorylation and overriding 
LRP1 deficiency. Finally, mRNA and protein expression of LRP1 was decreased in 
pulmonary plexiform lesions of patients with end-stage idiopathic PAH (laser 
capture microdissection, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry). Downregulation of LRP1 
protein was also demonstrated in explanted PASMC from patients with PAH and 
accompanied by enhanced TGFβ1-pSmad3-CTGF signaling and increased TGFβ1-induced 
PASMC proliferation that was prevented by pioglitazone.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identify LRP1 as an integrator of TGFβ1-mediated 
mechanisms that regulate vascular remodeling in mice and clinical PAH and PPARγ 
as a therapeutic target that controls canonical TGFβ1 pathways. Hence, 
pharmacologic PPARγ activation represents a promising new therapy for patients 
with PAH who lack the vasoprotective LRP1 in vascular SMC.
