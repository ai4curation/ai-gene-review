Sensory and signaling pathways are exquisitely organized in primary cilia. 
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) patients have compromised cilia and signaling. BBS 
proteins form the BBSome, which binds Rabin8, a guanine nucleotide exchange 
factor (GEF) activating the Rab8 GTPase, required for ciliary assembly. We now 
describe serum-regulated upstream vesicular transport events leading to 
centrosomal Rab8 activation and ciliary membrane formation. Using live 
microscopy imaging, we show that upon serum withdrawal Rab8 is observed to 
assemble the ciliary membrane in ∼100 min. Rab8-dependent ciliary assembly is 
initiated by the relocalization of Rabin8 to Rab11-positive vesicles that are 
transported to the centrosome. After ciliogenesis, Rab8 ciliary transport is 
strongly reduced, and this reduction appears to be associated with decreased 
Rabin8 centrosomal accumulation. Rab11-GTP associates with the Rabin8 
COOH-terminal region and is required for Rabin8 preciliary membrane trafficking 
to the centrosome and for ciliogenesis. Using zebrafish as a model organism, we 
show that Rabin8 and Rab11 are associated with the BBS pathway. Finally, using 
tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we determined that the 
transport protein particle (TRAPP) II complex associates with the Rabin8 
NH(2)-terminal domain and show that TRAPP II subunits colocalize with 
centrosomal Rabin8 and are required for Rabin8 preciliary targeting and 
ciliogenesis.
