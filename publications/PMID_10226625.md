SV40 and/or DNA sequences indistinguishable from SV40 have been detected in 
several types of human tumours. The oncoprotein of Simian virus 40, SV40 large 
T-antigen (Tag), is known to bind and inactivate tumour suppressor proteins, 
such as members of the retinoblastoma family and p53, thereby promoting cell 
transformation. In this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to 
investigate whether the Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T-antigen is able to 
interact with p73, a noval discovered putative tumour suppressor, that is 
homologous both structurally and functionally to p53. The yeast two-hybrid 
system is a genetic method to detect protein-protein-interactions in vivo. Our 
results suggest that the SV40 large T-antigen is not able to bind p73 in yeast 
although both proteins are expressed in the transformed yeast strain as was 
shown by western blot analysis.
