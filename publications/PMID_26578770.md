His37 as a selectivity filter. Here we report high-resolution (1.10 Å) cryogenic

Pore-lining carbonyl groups are well situated to stabilize hydronium via 
second-shell interactions involving bridging water molecules. In addition, room

directionality of proton flux as His37 is dynamically protonated and 
deprotonated in the conduction cycle.

Abstract

The matrix 2 (M2) protein from influenza A virus is a proton channel that uses His37 as a selectivity filter. Here we report high-resolution (1.10 Å) cryogenic crystallographic structures of the transmembrane domain of M2 at low and high pH. These structures reveal that waters within the pore form hydrogen-bonded networks or “water wires” spanning 17 Å from the channel entrance to His37. Pore-lining carbonyl groups are well situated to stabilize hydronium via second-shell interactions involving bridging water molecules. In addition, room temperature crystallographic structures indicate that water becomes increasingly fluid with increasing temperature and decreasing pH, despite the higher electrostatic field. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations reveal a collective switch of hydrogen bond orientations that can contribute to the directionality of proton flux as His37 is dynamically protonated and deprotonated in the conduction cycle.

Conclusions.

It is interesting to compare the present studies of the M2 channel with previous studies of the water channel ( 4 ) and ammonia channel ( 3 ), both structures that have been solved at moderate to high resolution and are responsible for diffusion of solvent molecules. In the case of the ammonia and water channels, the conduction pore allows for diffusion of single molecules of neutral H 2 O or NH 3 while excluding ammonium or hydronium ions. In contrast, the selectivity filter of the M2 channel is formed by a general acid/base, His37, which shuttles protons through the channel. The conduction path leading to this selectivity filter in M2 is markedly different from the ammonia and water channels in that it is broader and able to conduct protons through partially occupied water wires. Although there are only ∼16 water molecules at a given time in the path leading to His37, they are at partial occupancy at low temperature, giving rise to hundreds of potential paths conducive to proton conduction. The apparent fluid nature of the pore becomes even more apparent near room temperature, where the density suggests greater disorder, particularly at low pH. Moreover, examination of the structures and the predominant protonation state of His37 suggests that the overall collection of individual water molecules, although likely mobile, are on average highly polarized to favor hydrogen bond orientations that encourage entry of protons when the His37 residues are deprotonated; similarly, as His37 becomes more protonated, diffusion of protons into the channel might be encouraged. This dipolar switching might work in concert with rotameric switching to create the asymmetric proton conductance of the channel. Finally, the water molecules in the channel are surrounded by hydrogen bond-donating carbonyl groups, which should serve to stabilize hydronium through second-shell effects via bridging water molecules. It is encouraging that the present MD simulations in a crystal environment are consistent with experimental observations and add quantitative detail to these qualitative conclusions. Moreover, given the small size and biological relevance of the M2 channel, these structures should be ideally suited for more detailed simulations based on valence bond ( 15 , 35 ) quantum and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations ( 14 , 36 ) in which the formation and cleavage of covalent bonds associated with proton transfer can be examined in atomic detail.

Experimental Methods.

The peptide construct used in this study is M2(22-46) from influenza A/Udorn/307/1972. The sequence, the molecular weight of which is 2682.268 Da (average), is as follows: Ac-SSDPLVVAASIIGILHLILWILDRL-NH 3 . The peptide was synthesized manually at high temperature using Fmoc chemistry, cleaved from the resin and then purified using reverse-phase HPLC. The molecular weight of the desired product was confirmed using mass spectrometry, and the purity of the product was tested using analytical HPLC. The purified peptide was dissolved in ethanol and stored at −80 °C. The lipidic cubic phase was prepared with some modifications to the protocol described by Caffrey and Cherezov ( 38 ), and then crystallization conditions were screened in 96-well plastic sandwich plates. Square-shaped crystals belonging to space group I 4 formed after 2–4 wk of incubation at 10 °C. These conditions were optimized to grow 20- to 120-µm crystals. The crystals used for data collection at cryogenic conditions were grown in 96-well plates at 10 °C and then harvested into liquid nitrogen. The crystals used for room temperature data were grown in 96-well plates at 20 °C and then were transported to the beam line at ambient temperature for harvesting and data collection.

All crystallographic data were collected at the Advanced Light Source on beam 8.3.1. The beam size was 100 µm for all data sets; the detector used was a 3 × 3 CCD array (ADSC Q315r). Data from the two cryo condition crystals that diffracted to 1.1 Å were collected at a temperature of <100 K with a 13.0 keV beam and a detector-to-sample distance of 125 mm. The high-pH cryo condition crystal (PDB entry 4QK7) was exposed to the beam for 6 s per frame, and the low-pH cryo condition crystal (PDB entry 4QKC) was exposed for 4 s per frame; both crystals were oscillated 1° during data collection. The room temperature data were collected at 273 K using room temperature data collection techniques ( 38 ) with a 11.111-keV beam and an aluminum foil attenuator for both data sets. The crystals accumulated radiation damage faster under room temperature diffraction conditions, so larger crystals (50–120 µm) had to be used to obtain complete data sets.The low-pH room temperature condition crystal (PDB entry 4QKM) was exposed to the beam for 3 s per frame with a detector-to-sample distance of 125 mm; the high-pH room temperature condition crystal (PDB entry 4QKL) was exposed to the beam for 1 s per frame with a detector-to-sample distance of 150 mm; both crystals were oscillated 1° during data collection.

Data processing was done in iMosflm ( 39 ). Phasing was done by molecular replacement in the Phenix suite using Phaser MR ( 40 ) with chain A from PDB entry 3C9J ( 8 ) as a search model, and then refinement was carried out in Phenix Refine ( 17 ). Protein model manipulation and addition of water and ions were done in Coot ( 20 ), and monoolein molecules were manually fit into Fo-Fc density using both Coot and PyMol ( 41 ). Alternate conformers were predicted using the qFit web server ( 25 ) and Ringer ( 42 ) and were also manually added where positive Fo-Fc density indicated that they were present. See SI Appendix , Table S1 , for data processing and refinement statistics. Anisotropic B-factors were used for both cryo conditions (PDB entries 4QK7 and 4QKC) and the low-pH room temperature condition (PDB entry 4QKM) but not the high-pH room temperature condition (PDB entry 4QKL).
