In the human kinome, vaccinia-related kinase-1 (VRK1) is a new Ser-Thr kinase 
associated with proliferating tissues. VRK1 colocalizes with ATF2 in the nucleus 
and can form a stable complex. We have studied the phosphorylation of the 
transcription factor ATF2, which regulates gene expression by forming dimers 
with proteins with basic region-leucine zipper domains and recognizing 
cAMP-response element or AP1 sequences implicated in cellular responses to 
stress. VRK1 phosphorylates ATF2 mainly on Thr-73, stabilizing the ATF2 protein 
and increasing its intracellular level. Mutagenesis studies showed that Thr-73 
and Ser-62 are implicated in ATF2 transcriptional activation by VRK1 detected in 
a functional assay based on ATF2 dimerization. VRK1 can activate the collagenase 
gene promoter that is regulated by ATF2 in a dose-dependent manner. Loss of 
kinase activity (K179E mutant) or the T73A substitution in ATF2 prevents both 
its accumulation and activation of transcription. VRK1 and JNK, which 
phosphorylates ATF2 in Thr-69 and Thr-71, have an additive effect on 
ATF2-dependent transcription at suboptimal doses. Therefore, two groups of amino 
acids in the ATF2 amino-terminal region can integrate different cellular signals 
mediated by at least five different kinases. VRK1 is an element of a novel 
signaling pathway that regulates gene transcription.
