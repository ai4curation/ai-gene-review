We have shown previously that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
synthesized by the cellular constituents of small vessels per se, viz. 
endothelial cells and pericytes, participates in the hypoxia-driven 
proliferation of both cell types (Nomura, M., Yamagishi, S., Harada, S., 
Hayashi, Y., Yamashima, T., Yamashita, J., Yamamoto, H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 
270, 28316-28324; Yamagishi, S., Yonekura, H., Yamamoto, Y., Fujimori, H., 
Sakurai, S., Tanaka, N., and Yamamoto, H. (1999) Lab. Invest. 79, 501-509). In 
this study, we examined the expression of the recently isolated VEGF gene family 
members (placenta growth factor (PlGF), VEGF-B, and VEGF-C) in human dermal 
microvascular endothelial cells and bovine retinal pericytes cultured under 
various oxygen tensions. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction analyses demonstrated that the two cell types possess not only VEGF 
(VEGF-A) mRNA, but also VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and PlGF mRNAs. Among them, only VEGF-A 
mRNA was induced under hypoxia. Competitive reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction showed that, under normoxic conditions, the rank order of mRNA 
content in endothelial cells was PlGF > VEGF-B > VEGF-C > VEGF-A and that mRNA 
coding for PlGF was expressed at >100-fold higher levels than VEGF-A mRNA. In 
pericytes, the rank order was VEGF-C > VEGF-A > VEGF-B > PlGF, and approximately 
7-fold higher levels of VEGF-C mRNA compared with VEGF-A mRNA were noted in this 
cell type. Furthermore, antisense inhibition of PlGF protein production lowered 
the endothelial cell synthesis of DNA under hypoxic conditions. The results 
suggest that these VEGF family members may also take active parts in 
angiogenesis.
