A member of the p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) family, gamma-PAK has 
cytostatic properties and is activated by cellular stresses such as 
hyperosmolarity or DNA damage. We report herein that gamma-PAK is associated in 
vivo with the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl. gamma-PAK 
phosphorylates c-Abl on sites located in the kinase domain, in a region that is 
implicated in protein-protein interactions and in subcellular localization. 
Activation of gamma-PAK in human embryonic kidney 293T cells by cotransfection 
with constitutively active Cdc42 induces activation of c-Abl, resulting in 
increased phosphotyrosine levels. Cotransfection of c-Abl and gamma-PAK elicits 
phosphorylation of gamma-PAK on tyrosine and down-regulation of gamma-PAK 
activity, promoting accumulation of inactive gamma-PAK. gamma-PAK is also 
phosphorylated in vitro by c-Abl. gamma-PAK activity is regulated by 
ubiquitination and proteolysis in vivo, as shown by immunoblotting with an 
anti-ubiquitin antibody in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. In summary, we 
describe a functional interaction between gamma-PAK and c-Abl in which gamma-PAK 
stimulates c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity and c-Abl phosphorylates and 
down-regulates gamma-PAK, suggesting the existence of a negative feedback loop 
between c-Abl and gamma-PAK.
