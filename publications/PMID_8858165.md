Import of newly synthesized PTS1 proteins into the peroxisome requires the PTS1 
receptor (Pex5p), a predominantly cytoplasmic protein that cycles between the 
cytoplasm and peroxisome. We have identified Pex13p, a novel integral 
peroxisomal membrane from both yeast and humans that binds the PTS1 receptor via 
a cytoplasmically oriented SH3 domain. Although only a small amount of Pex5p is 
bound to peroxisomes at steady state (< 5%), loss of Pex13p further reduces the 
amount of peroxisome-associated Pex5p by approximately 40-fold. Furthermore, 
loss of Pex13p eliminates import of peroxisomal matrix proteins that contain 
either the type-1 or type-2 peroxisomal targeting signal but does not affect 
targeting and insertion of integral peroxisomal membrane proteins. We conclude 
that Pex13p functions as a docking factor for the predominantly cytoplasmic PTS1 
receptor.
