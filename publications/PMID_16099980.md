Flowering of Arabidopsis is regulated by several environmental and endogenous 
signals. An important integrator of these inputs is the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) 
gene, which encodes a small, possibly mobile protein. A primary response to 
floral induction is the activation of FT RNA expression in leaves. Because 
flowers form at a distant site, the shoot apex, these data suggest that FT 
primarily controls the timing of flowering. Integration of temporal and spatial 
information is mediated in part by the bZIP transcription factor FD, which is 
already expressed at the shoot apex before floral induction. A complex of FT and 
FD proteins in turn can activate floral identity genes such as APETALA1 (AP1).
