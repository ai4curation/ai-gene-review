Stem cell persistence into adulthood requires self-renewal from early 
developmental stages. In the developing mouse brain, only apical progenitors 
located at the ventricle are self-renewing, whereas basal progenitors gradually 
deplete. However, nothing is known about the mechanisms regulating the 
fundamental difference between these progenitors. Here we show that the 
conditional deletion of the small Rho-GTPase cdc42 at different stages of 
neurogenesis in mouse telencephalon results in an immediate increase in basal 
mitoses. Whereas cdc42-deficient progenitors have normal cell cycle length, 
orientation of cell division and basement membrane contact, the apical location 
of the Par complex and adherens junctions are gradually lost, leading to an 
increasing failure of apically directed interkinetic nuclear migration. These 
cells then undergo mitoses at basal positions and acquire the fate of basal 
progenitors. Thus, cdc42 has a crucial role at the apical pole of progenitors, 
thereby regulating the position of mitoses and cell fate.
