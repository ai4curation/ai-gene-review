Spore germination in Bacillus species represents an excellent model system with 
which to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the nutritional control of 
growth and development. Binding of specific chemical nutrients to their cognate 
receptors located in the spore inner membrane triggers the germination process 
that leads to a resumption of metabolism in spore outgrowth. Recent studies 
suggest that the inner membrane GerD lipoprotein plays a critical role in the 
receptor-mediated activation of downstream germination events. The 121-residue 
core polypeptide of GerD (GerD⁶⁰⁻¹⁸⁰) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus forms 
a stable α-helical trimer in aqueous solution. The 2.3-Å-resolution crystal 
structure of the trimer reveals a neatly twisted superhelical rope, with unusual 
supercoiling induced by parallel triple-helix interactions. The overall geometry 
comprises three interleaved hydrophobic screws of interacting helices linked by 
short turns that have not been seen before. Using complementation analysis in a 
series of Bacillus subtilis gerD mutants, we demonstrated that alterations in 
the GerD trimer structure have profound effects on nutrient germination. This 
important structure-function relationship of trimeric GerD is supported by our 
identification of a dominant negative gerD mutation in B. subtilis. These 
results and those of others lead us to propose that GerD mediates clustering of 
germination proteins in the inner membrane of dormant spores and thus promotes 
the rapid and cooperative germination response to nutrients.
