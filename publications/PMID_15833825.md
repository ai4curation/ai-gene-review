The biochemical pathways that are disrupted in the genesis of sporadic breast 
cancers remain unclear. Moreover, the present prognosticating markers used to 
determine the prognosis of node-negative patient leads to probabilistic results, 
and the eventual clinical course is far from certain. Here we identified the 
human TREX complex, a multiprotein complex that links transcription elongation 
to mRNA transport, as culprit of aggressive human breast cancers. We show that 
whereas p84N5 (called hTREX84) is expressed at very low levels in normal breast 
epithelial cells, it is highly expressed in breast tumors. Importantly, hTREX84 
expression correlates with tumor size and the metastatic state of the tumor 
progression. Reduction of hTREX84 levels in breast cancer cell lines by small 
interfering RNA result in inhibition of cellular proliferation and abrogation of 
mRNA export. These results not only identify hTREX84 as a prognosticator of 
breast cancer but also delineate human TREX complex as a target for therapeutic 
drugs against breast cancer.
