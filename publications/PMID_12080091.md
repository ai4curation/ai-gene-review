In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heterochromatin-like regions are found near 
telomeres and at the silent mating-type loci, where they can repress genes in an 
epigenetic manner. Several proteins are involved in telomeric heterochromatin 
structure including Rap1, Sir2, Sir3, Sir4, yKu70 (Hdf1), yKu80 (Hdf2), and the 
N termini of histones H3 and H4. By recognizing cis-acting DNA-binding sites, 
Rap1 is believed to recruit Sir and other silencing proteins and determine where 
heterochromatin forms. The integrity of heterochromatin also requires the 
binding of Sir proteins to histones that may form a scaffold for Sir protein 
interactions with chromatin. In this study we describe how the heterochromatin 
complex may form initially and how it differs from the complex that spreads 
along the chromosome. We found that close to the telomere end, Sir4 can bind 
Rap1 independently of Sir2, Sir3, yKu70/yKu80, and the intact H4 N terminus. In 
contrast, Sir4 binding requires all of the silencing factors further along 
telomeric heterochromatin. These data indicate that Sir4 binding to Rap1 
initiates the sequential association of Sir and other proteins, allowing the 
subsequent spreading of the heterochromatin proteins along the chromosome.
