The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes multiple homologues of the two 
major families of mammalian equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside 
transporters. As part of a programme aimed at understanding the biological 
rationale underlying the multiplicity of eukaryote nucleoside transporters, we 
have now demonstrated that the nematode genes ZK809.4 (ent-1) and K09A9.3 
(ent-2) encode equilibrative transporters, which we designate CeENT1 and CeENT2 
respectively. These transporters resemble their human counterparts hENT1 and 
hENT2 in exhibiting similar broad permeant specificities for nucleosides, while 
differing in their permeant selectivities for nucleobases. They are insensitive 
to the classic inhibitors of mammalian nucleoside transport, 
nitrobenzylthioinosine, dilazep and draflazine, but are inhibited by the 
vasoactive drug dipyridamole. Use of green fluorescent protein reporter 
constructs indicated that the transporters are present in a limited number of 
locations in the adult, including intestine and pharynx. Their potential roles 
in these tissues were explored by using RNA interference to disrupt gene 
expression. Although disruption of ent-1 or ent-2 expression alone had no 
effect, simultaneous disruption of both genes yielded pronounced developmental 
defects involving the intestine and vulva.
