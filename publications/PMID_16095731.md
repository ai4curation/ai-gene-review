There is growing evidence that anxiety disorders are associated with impairments 
of cellular plasticity and resilience. Paralleling these advances in our 
understanding of the neurobiologic underpinnings of anxiety disorders is the 
growing appreciation of the diverse functions that mitochondria play in 
regulating integrated CNS function. The emerging data suggest that mitochondrial 
Ca2+ sequestration has a key role in modulating the tone of synaptic plasticity 
in a variety of neuroanatomical regions, including those implicated in the 
pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. Furthermore, activation of peripheral 
mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors resulted in reduced anxiety in rats. One 
of the major modulators of mitochondrial function is Bcl-2 proteins imbedded in 
the inner mitochondrial membrane. Bcl-2 overexpression increases mitochondria 
Ca2+ uptake capacity and resistance to Ca2+-inhibition of respiration and 
upregulation of Bcl-2 increases maximal uptake capacity of mitochondria. We 
have, therefore, explored the significance of Bcl-2 in the association between 
mitochondrial function and affective disorders testing Bcl-2 heterozygote mice 
in models of affective and anxiety disorders. Mutant mice have reduced 
mitochondrial Bcl-2 levels, and although they have no gross behavioral 
abnormalities, they demonstrate a significant increase of anxiety-like 
behaviors. Bcl-2 heterozygote mice spent less time in the center of an open 
field, spent less time outside an enclosure in the "emergence test", were less 
likely to explore the transparent part of a black/white box or the open arms of 
an elevated plus maze compared with WT controls. Mutant mice did not differ from 
WT in measures of locomotion or in the forced swim test for depression-like 
behavior suggesting a specific effect on anxiety-like behaviors. Our study, 
therefore demonstrates that Bcl-2 may be a key factor in anxiety disorders and 
that its effects may possibly originate from its role in the mitochondria.
