General transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) is required for transcription by RNA 
polymerase II; it consists minimally of a heterodimer of RNA 
polymerase-associated proteins RAP30 and RAP74. According to solution and 
mutagenesis studies, the multiple domains of RAP30 and RAP74 bind PolII, TFIIB, 
TAF250 and DNA in interactions that are essential for transcription initiation 
and elongation. The X-ray structure of the RAP30/RAP74 interaction domains at 
1.7 A resolution reveals a novel "triple barrel" dimerization fold and suggests 
with mutant data that interactions with the transcription apparatus are mediated 
not only by this tripartite beta-barrel, but also via flexible loops and alpha 
and beta-structures extending from it.
