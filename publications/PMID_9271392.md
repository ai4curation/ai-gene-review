QSR1 is an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, which encodes a 60S 
ribosomal subunit protein required for joining of 40S and 60S subunits. 
Truncations of QSR1 predicted to encode C-terminally truncated forms of Qsr1p do 
not substitute for QSR1 but do act as dominant negative mutations, inhibiting 
the growth of yeast when expressed from an inducible promoter. The dominant 
negative mutants exhibit a polysome profile characterized by 'half-mer' 
polysomes, indicative of a subunit joining defect like that seen in other qsr1 
mutants (D. P. Eisinger, F. A. Dick, and B. L. Trumpower, Mol. Cell. Biol. 
17:5136-5145, 1997.) By screening a high-copy yeast genomic library, we isolated 
several clones containing overlapping inserts of a novel gene that rescues the 
slow-growth phenotype of the dominant negative qsr1 truncations. The suppressor 
of qsr1 truncation mutants, SQT1, is an essential gene, which encodes a 47.1-kDa 
protein containing multiple WD repeats and which interacts strongly with Qsr1p 
in a yeast two-hybrid system. SQT1 restores growth and the "half-mer" polysome 
profile of the dominant negative qsr1 mutants to normal, but it does not rescue 
temperature-sensitive qsr1 mutants or the original qsr1-1 missense allele. In 
yeast cell lysates, Sqt1p fractionates as part of an oligomeric protein complex 
that is loosely associated with ribosomes but is distinct from known eukaryotic 
initiation factor complexes. Loss of SQT1 function by down regulation from an 
inducible promoter results in formation of half-mer polyribosomes and decreased 
Qsr1p levels on free 60S subunits. Sqt1p thus appears to be involved in a late 
step of 60S subunit assembly or modification in the cytoplasm.
