Identification of all the protein components of the small subunit (28 S) of the 
mammalian mitochondrial ribosome has been achieved by carrying out proteolytic 
digestions of whole 28 S subunits followed by analysis of the resultant peptides 
by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Peptide 
sequence information was used to search the human EST data bases and complete 
coding sequences of the proteins were assembled. The human mitochondrial 
ribosome has 29 distinct proteins in the small subunit. Fourteen of this group 
of proteins are homologs of the Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal proteins S2, S5, 
S6, S7, S9, S10, S11, S12, S14, S15, S16, S17, S18, and S21. All of these 
proteins have homologs in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial ribosomes. Surprisingly, three variants 
of ribosomal protein S18 are found in the mammalian and D. melanogaster 
mitochondrial ribosomes while C. elegans has two S18 homologs. The S18 homologs 
tend to be more closely related to chloroplast S18s than to prokaryotic S18s. No 
mitochondrial homologs to prokaryotic ribosomal proteins S1, S3, S4, S8, S13, 
S19, and S20 could be found in the peptides obtained from the whole 28 S subunit 
digests or by analysis of the available data bases. The remaining 15 proteins 
present in mammalian mitochondrial 28 S subunits (MRP-S22 through MRP-S36) are 
specific to mitochondrial ribosomes. Proteins in this group have no apparent 
homologs in bacterial, chloroplast, archaebacterial, or cytosolic ribosomes. All 
but two of these proteins have a clear homolog in D. melanogaster while all but 
three can be found in the genome of C. elegans. Five of the mitochondrial 
specific ribosomal proteins have homologs in S. cerevisiae.
