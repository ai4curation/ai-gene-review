Abstract

Genome annotation is a synthesis of computational prediction and experimental evidence. Small genes are notoriously difficult to detect because the patterns used to identify them are often indistinguishable from chance occurrences, leading to an arbitrary cutoff threshold for the length of a protein-coding gene identified solely by in silico analysis. We report a systematic reappraisal of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome that ignores thresholds. A complete six-frame translation was compared to a proteome data set, the Pfam domain database, and the genomes of six other fungi. Thirty-nine novel loci were identified. RT-PCR and RNA-Seq confirmed transcription at 38 loci; 33 novel gene structures were delineated by 5′ and 3′ RACE. Expression levels of 14 transcripts fluctuated during meiosis. Translational evidence for 10 genes, evolutionary conservation data supporting 35 predictions, and distinct phenotypes upon ORF deletion (one essential, four slow-growth, two delayed-division phenotypes) suggest that all 39 predictions encode functional proteins. The popularity of S. pombe as a model organism suggests that this augmented annotation will be of interest in diverse areas of molecular and cellular biology, while the generality of the approach suggests widespread applicability to other genomes.

RESULTS

The search for novel proteins was conducted using a modified version of a pipeline that we have previously used to search for novel human protein-coding genes ( B itton et al. 2010 ). The entire S. pombe genome was translated in all six reading frames and partitioned at stop codons to create a database containing 783,342 candidate sequences. To provide a coverage of the overall proteome that was as comprehensive as possible, we assessed the proteomic profiles of vegetatively growing wild-type haploid cells ( 972 h − ) and cultures representing all stages of sexual differentiation. These differentiating cultures were generated by manipulation of the pat1.114 mutant. pat1 + encodes a protein kinase whose activity toward the meiotic inducer Mei2 during vegetative growth blocks commitment to sexual differentiation ( W atanabe et al. 1997 ). Relief of Pat1 kinase inhibition of Mei2 is sufficient to induce sexual differentiation. Under normal circumstances, Pat1 activity is downregulated by the production of a pseudosubstrate called Mei3 ( M c L eod and B each 1988 ; L i and M c L eod 1996 ). However, temperature-dependent inactivation of the product of the pat1.114 gene offers an equally effective route to relieve Mei2 inhibition ( I ino and Y amamoto 1985 ; N urse 1985 ). A key feature of this temperature-dependent inactivation of Pat1.114 is the immediate induction of sexual differentiation of all cells within the culture, irrespective of factors that normally determine the potential to differentiate (cell cycle or mating-type status, nutrient level, and pheromone signaling). As progress through the different stages of sexual differentiation occurs at similar rates within each cell within these pat1.114 -shifted cultures, differentiation proceeds in a largely synchronous fashion throughout the culture. The molecular changes that accompany sexual differentiation within such bulk cultures can therefore be taken as representative of the differentiation steps taken within the individual cells within the culture ( M ata et al. 2002 ).

Samples from the pat1.114 culture were taken immediately before the temperature shift to 32° to induce meiosis (0 hr) and at 3, 5, and 10 hr after. These were then pooled to give a single pat1.114 meiotic sample for proteomic analysis. In total, 199,788 (wild type) and 265,234 ( pat1.114 ) spectra were identified and searched against both the S. pombe protein data set ( W ood et al. 2002 ; H ertz -F owler et al. 2004 ) and the six-frame translation database. Overall, 167 novel peptides were identified at an FDR < 2% ( Table S1 ). These peptides were mapped onto the existing genome annotation ( W ood et al. 2002 ) and subjected to manual curation; canonical gene structures not contained within an alternative ORF of a known gene were defined. We also set the criterion that gene structures should include a methionine initiation codon either within the predicted ORF or, by extension, to include a canonical splice site. Using these criteria, we predicted nine novel genes ( Table 1 and Table S2 ) and corrected the annotation at another 14 loci, including one status change from pseudogene to coding ( Table 2 and Table S3 ). Five additional peptides provided experimental confirmation for novel protein predictions independently submitted to GeneDB over the course of this study. The remaining 133 peptides, which lacked the necessary up- and downstream signals of gene structure, were considered to be false positives (in correspondence with the estimated FDR), since they cannot physically be extended to create valid gene structures. This means that these peptides have an immediate upstream stop codon that has no intervening methionine or no acceptor that could provide the 3′ of an intron to negotiate the stop codon, or they are in a different/reverse frame of a known coding gene. Thus, the rejected fragments must be true false positives on the basis of our current knowledge of the biological mechanisms that make a functional protein.

All other peptides that could be extended to make a protein structure (regardless of other criteria) were included. Those that were unsupported by homology, or other methods, were designated as “dubious,” pending further investigation.

To ensure that the 133 rejected loci were indeed false predictions, we also sought transcriptional evidence at these loci, using an RNA sequencing data set (AB SOLiD v3+) produced from asynchronous wild type ( 972 h − ) and pat1.114 cultures immediately before temperature shift to 32° (0 hr) and at 3, 5, and 10 hr after temperature shift, as before (two biological replicates were processed; D. B itton , A. G rallert , J. B radford , Y. L i , T. Y ates , P. S cutt , Y. H ey , S. P epper , I. H agan , and C. M iller , unpublished results). As expected, at the majority of these loci (89), no 50mer sequence reads aligned perfectly to the genome (in any sample), while at the remaining 44 loci some transcriptional activity was observed in at least one of the 10 samples tested. Nevertheless, in most cases, the predicted peptide was in an alternate reading frame to that of a known protein (29 loci), making it impossible to distinguish between transcription that would result in the novel peptide and transcription that would result in the known protein being expressed. An additional set of loci was on the complementary strand to a known protein (8 loci) or positioned within untranslated regions (UTRs) (2 loci), in line with their initial classification as false positives ( Table S4 ). The remaining 5 loci were located in intergenic regions and displayed low transcriptional activity, but the lack of conventional signals of gene structure precluded prediction of the complete architecture of these genes.

The relationship between S. pombe and other fungi was then assessed using comparative genomics. We extended the InParanoid algorithm ( R emm et al. 2001 ) to make use of a complete, unbiased, six-frame translation of the S. pombe genome. We compared this data set to six other fungi ( S. japonicus , S. octosporus , S. cryophilus , S. cerevisiae , A. fumigatus , and N. crassa ) via their six-frame protein translations. To estimate the FDR, searches were also performed against databases produced by random permutation of the original data. The resultant ortholog sets were compared ( Table S5 ) to produce a list of all conserved loci in S. pombe (44,900; FDR 0%; no matches in the permuted data set). These were then mapped onto an existing annotation. The vast majority of conserved sequences (99.9%) were found to be within existing genes. However, an additional 59 hits to six frame translations of the genomes of the most recently diverged species ( S. japonicus , S. cryophilus , and S. octosporus ; Figure 1 ) were identified in the fission yeast intergenic regions. These were then subjected to the same manual curation criteria used to filter the MS/MS data above. A further 35 novel genes, six gene extensions, and one protein-coding gene, previously annotated as a pseudogene, were identified. Five of these 35 genes overlapped with those found by proteogenomics.

A major challenge with any prediction algorithm is to find the right balance between true and false positives. Typically, parameter settings are chosen to err on the side of caution; underprediction is generally preferred instead of populating the databases with incorrectly identified genes. Since we were able to predict homology to S. cerevisiae for 16 of these novel loci using PSI-Blast ( A ltschul et al. 1997 ), we believe that the settings used here were similarly stringent. Importantly, since no matches were found to be significant with the permuted data, it remains likely that more protein-coding genes may remain.

We then scanned gene-free regions of the fission yeast six-frame translation for matches to Pfam protein domains ( F inn et al. 2010 ). Six additional protein-coding domains were identified outside the known protein-coding regions ( P -value < 3.9 × 10 −07 ). Three of these genes had been identified within the comparative genomics work flow, and one also matched the peptide data. One domain led to the discovery of a novel protein-coding gene, not identified by the other methods, and one a gene that had been previously annotated as a pseudogene. Two domains were found to extend a known human MAWBP homolog (SPAC186.06). However, this domain extension introduces two frameshifts, making it unlikely that this gene is correctly translated or that there are errors in the genomic sequence.

We next sought to confirm transcription at these loci by RT-PCR and RNA sequencing. Transcription was confirmed at 38/40 of the loci in either the asynchronous wild-type or pat1.114 -induced meiotic cultures ( Table 1 , Table S2 ; Figure S1 , Figure S2 ). The inherent synchrony of sexual differentiation that is induced by a shift of a pat1.114 diploid strain to 32° enabled us to qualitatively assess whether the level of transcription for any of the new genes fluctuated with progression through the meiotic differentiation program. Fourteen transcripts were differentially expressed during meiosis. Using 5′ and 3′ RACE assays, we established the complete gene architecture of 33 predicted genes and 2 gene extensions, including the 5′ and/or 3′ UTRs. For 9 loci, data sets generated in the mass spectrometric analysis supported the existence of a bona fide protein-coding gene. Epitope “tags” were fused, in frame, to the 3′ end of the ORFs of two genes using standard PCR cassette-mediated tagging ( B ahler et al. 1998 ). Western blot analysis confirmed that both genes were translated into proteins ( Figure S3 ).

We refer to the novel protein-coding genes with no apparent induction in meiosis as new1–new25 , and the 14 genes with t ranscripts a ltered in m eiosis as tam1–tam14 . A recent study conducted by H utchins et al. (2010) identified tam4 as encoding the S. pombe counterpart of a novel component of the microtubule-nucleating γ-tubulin ring complex called Mozart (although the H utchins et al . study prediction uses an initiator methionine that is 5′ of the ORF that we propose).

Next, three criteria were used to select seven genes ( tam2 , new1 , new5 , tam7 , new8 , tam11 , and new21 ) for functional assessment by one-step PCR-mediated destruction ( B ahler et al. 1998 ): evidence of transcription, the absence of close neighbors, and the prediction of a phenotype based on predictions arising from deletion of the S. cerevisiae homolog. While tam2 .Δ was viable, new21 was not ( Figure 2 ); it has human (TMEM167A) and S. cerevisiae (YNL024C-A) orthologs whose functions are suggested to lie within the secretory pathway ( W endler et al. 2009 ). new5 .Δ and tam11 .Δ displayed an elongated cellular morphology at division, typical of cells in which commitment to mitosis is delayed ( Figure 3 ; Figure 4, B and C ; Figure 5 ). Both new8 .Δ and tam7 .Δ cells grew extremely slowly at all temperatures tested (25°, 30°, 32°, and 36°; Figure 2 and Figure 3 ). tam7 .Δ cells were also delayed in mitotic commitment ( Figure 4D ). The new1 .Δ strain exhibited slow growth at 25° but was inviable at 32° ( Figure 2 and Figure 3 ). Cell division was severely perturbed by the loss of this putative histone-like transcription factor ( Table 1 and Table S2 ). Aberrant cell-wall deposits accumulated during septation ( Figure 4E ) alongside a range of mitotic defects including errors in chromosome segregation (cell type 1; Figure 4F ; Figure S4 ; Figure S5 ) and spindle formation (cell type 2; Figure 4F ; Figure S4 ; Figure S5 ).

Complementation analysis was used to address whether the phenotypes observed in the “deletion” strains genuinely arose from the loss of the protein corresponding to the ORF from the proteome or from some other consequence of the alteration to the genomic sequence. The new1 + , new5 + , new8 + , new21 + , and tam7 + ORFs were cloned into versions of the pREP1, pREP41, and pREP81 vectors in which the LEU2 + gene had been replaced with hyg R (pREPH pREP4H and pREP8H, respectively; A. G rallert and I. M. H agan , unpublished results) and transformed into the appropriate heterozygous deletion/wild-type ORF diploids. Haploid deletion strains harboring the plasmids were subsequently isolated and subjected to spot-test analysis at 25°. In each case, a strain harboring the empty pREP8H vector served as a control to define the basal level of growth of the deletion strain. The provision of the corresponding ORF complemented the slow-growth phenotype of new1∷nat , new5∷nat , new8∷nat , and tam7∷nat ( Figure 5 ). Transformation of the new21∷nat / new21 + heterozygous diploid strain with any pREP or its derivative failed repeatedly. We assume that this is due to the poor growth of this diploid, which would be consistent with a requirement for two copies of new21 + for healthy growth of diploid S. pombe cells.

DISCUSSION

The systematic pipeline developed here ( Figure 6 ) has expanded the gene repertoire of the fission yeast S. pombe with the identification of 39 new genes and one rRNA gene (equivalent to an ∼0.8% increase to the proteome) ( Table 1 and Table S2 ). We have also refined the sequence coordinates that define 21 more loci ( Table 2 ; Table S3 ; Figure 7A ). The verification of the majority of the genes by RT-PCR, RNA sequencing, and RACE, the supporting evidence at the protein level for 10 genes, and the association of a deletion phenotype for six of seven candidates tested strongly suggest that all are bona fide genes. However, our appraisal of the new11 locus illustrates the challenge in setting a threshold for the definition of a gene. Despite substantial evidence, including MS/MS data, transcriptional support, and most of the signals of conventional gene structure, our inability to locate a suitable 5′ “ATG” leads us to annotate this “gene” as a “pseudogene.” In other words, considerable potential remains for extending the catalog of protein-coding genes in S. pombe still further as new technologies emerge and our understanding of gene structure advances.

Comparisons with S. cerevisiae databases predict localization for 18 genes and an inferred function for 13. For example, new10 ( Figure 7B ), which was identified solely by comparative genomics, is broadly conserved from humans to protozoa. The gene encodes enhancer of rudimentary homolog, a putative transcriptional repressor implicated in cell cycle regulation and significantly upregulated in malignant breast and ovarian cancer cells ( Z afrakas et al. 2008 ).

The length of the majority of the novel protein-coding genes was below the 100-amino-acid cutoff set for the original annotation pipeline ( W ood et al. 2002 ). Since similar size criteria have been used for other organisms, it is reasonable to expect that the application of similar direct pipelines to interrogate genome annotation in other model organisms should provide similar refinements to their gene complement and bring us closer to the desired catalog of protein-coding genes.
