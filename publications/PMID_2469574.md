In order to examine the consequences of a transient increase or decrease in 
intracellular calmodulin (CaM) levels, two bovine-papilloma-virus (BPV)-based 
expression vectors capable of inducibly synthesizing CaM sense (BPV-MCM) or 
anti-sense (BPV-CaMAS) RNA have been constructed and used to stably transform 
mouse C127 cells. Upon addition of Zn2+, cells containing the BPV-MCM vector 
have transiently increased CaM mRNA and protein levels. Cells carrying the 
BPV-CaMAS vector transiently produce CaM anti-sense RNA resulting in a 
significant decrease in intracellular CaM concentration. Increased CaM caused a 
transient acceleration of proliferation, while the anti-sense RNA induced 
decrease in CaM caused a transient cell cycle arrest. Flow cytometric analysis 
showed that progression through G1 and mitosis was affected by changes in CaM 
levels. These data indicate that CaM levels may limit the rate of cell-cycle 
progression under normal conditions of growth.
