Cell morphogenesis, which requires rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, is 
essential to coordinate the development of tissues such as the musculature and 
nervous system during normal embryonic development. One class of signaling 
proteins that regulate actin cytoskeletal rearrangement is the evolutionarily 
conserved CDM (C. elegansCed-5, human DOCK180, DrosophilaMyoblast city, or Mbc) 
family of proteins, which function as unconventional guanine nucleotide exchange 
factors for the small GTPase Rac. This CDM-Rac protein complex is sufficient for 
Rac activation, but is enhanced upon the association of CDM proteins with the 
ELMO/Ced-12 family of proteins. We identified and characterized the role of 
Drosophila Sponge (Spg), the vertebrate DOCK3/DOCK4 counterpart as an 
ELMO-interacting protein. Our analysis shows Spg mRNA and protein is expressed 
in the visceral musculature and developing nervous system, suggesting a role for 
Spg in later embryogenesis. As maternal null mutants of spg die early in 
development, we utilized genetic interaction analysis to uncover the role of Spg 
in central nervous system (CNS) development. Consistent with its role in 
ELMO-dependent pathways, we found genetic interactions with spg and elmo mutants 
exhibited aberrant axonal defects. In addition, our data suggests Ncad may be 
responsible for recruiting Spg to the membrane, possibly in CNS development. Our 
findings not only characterize the role of a new DOCK family member, but help to 
further understand the role of signaling downstream of N-cadherin in neuronal 
development.

IntroductionThe formation of embryonic tissues is a key feature in generating diversity in animal
development. After cell fate is established, cell-cell signaling and intracellular
signal transduction pathways instruct cells to undergo cell shape changes. These
cell shape changes are necessary for cell movement, a basic process that underlies
embryonic development and is largely accomplished by regulation of the actin
cytoskeleton. Actin dynamics is required for the migration of individual groups of
cells, as in border cell migration in the Drosophila ovary, or
large groups of cells, such as those involved in gastrulation in the developing fly
embryo [1], [2]. One common
feature of cell rearrangements via the actin cytoskeleton is the involvement of the
Rho family of GTPases [3], [4].Widely conserved across species and involved in seemingly diverse developmental
processes including cell migration, phagocytosis, and myoblast fusion, the Rho
GTPases are key signaling molecules that impinge upon actin cytoskeletal
reorganization [5].
Several classes of GTPase regulatory proteins have been identified, including the
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and
guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) [6], [7]. In particular, the GEFs
regulate GTPase activity by exchanging the inactive, GDP-bound Rac to the active,
GTP-bound state. It is thought that GEFs are a crucial intermediate that signal from
upstream cell surface receptors to mediate GTPase activation. Some GEFs directly
associate with membrane receptors, while others are associated via an intermediate
complex. In flies, two neuronally expressed Rac GEFs have been identified that
exemplify this in development of the central nervous system. Trio physically
interacts with the Netrin receptor Frazzled to regulate chemoattraction [8], [9], while Son of
sevenless (Sos) associates with the Roundabout (Robo) receptor through the SH2-SH3
adaptor protein Dreadlocks (DOCK) to control axon repulsion [9].Recent studies have identified a class of non-canonical GEFS that are members of the
CDM (C. elegans
Ced-5, human DOCK180,
Drosophila
Myoblast city) family of proteins [5], [10]. Evolutionarily conserved,
Mbc/DOCK180/Ced-5 proteins contain an N-terminal Src-homology-3 domain (SH3), two
internal DOCK-homology regions (DHR-1 and DHR-2), and a C-terminal
proline–rich region. The DHR1 regions of both DOCK180 and Mbc bind to
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] [11], [12]. Vertebrate cell
culture studies show this region is required for membrane localization [12]. In flies, the
DHR1 domain is not essential for recruitment to the membrane, but is essential for
myoblast fusion as deletion of the DHR1 domain fails to rescue mbc
mutant embryos in functional rescue assays [11]. Although the SH3-domain
containing protein Crk is capable of binding the C-terminal proline-rich region of
both DOCK180 and Mbc, it is not always essential in vivo. A direct
interaction between vertebrate DOCK180 and CrkII is not required for apoptotic cell
removal [13]. Furthermore, deletion of the Ced-2/Crk binding sites in
C. elegans Ced-5/DOCK180 does not affect cell engulfment or
migration [13]. Consistent with this, while Drosophila
Crk binds Mbc, it is dispensable for myoblast fusion [11]. Whereas canonical GEFs
contain both typical Dbl-homology domain (DH) and Pleckstrin-homology domains (PH)
that are involved in activation of the Rho GTPases, these domains are absent in CDM
family members [10], [12]. Conventional GEFs bind nucleotide-free Rac via their DH
domain, while the CDM proteins use the DHR2 region. Deletion or mutation of this
domain results in a loss of Rac binding and activation [14], [15]. A DOCK-Rac protein complex is
sufficient for Rac activation [12], [16], but may be enhanced by DOCK180 bound to ELMO [14], [17], [18].ELMO/Ced-12 (hereafter referred to as ELMO) was originally identified in C.
elegans as an upstream regulator of Rac in apoptotic cell engulfment
and cell migration [19], [20], [21]. Studies using mammalian ELMO1 subsequently showed that
the DOCK180-ELMO complex is required for Rac-mediated cell migration and
phagocytosis [14], [17], [18], [22], [23]. The PH domain, which in conventional GEFs targets
protein to the membrane through its interactions with phosphatidylinositol lipids or
other protein-protein interactions, is provided by the ELMO protein in the DOCK-ELMO
complex [14],
[16]. The
N-terminal SH3 domain of CDM family members associates with the C-terminal region of
the ELMO family of proteins [24]. While the molecular function of ELMO in the
DOCK→Rac signaling pathway still needs to be clarified, it is worth noting that
ELMO has functions independent of the DOCK proteins.Importantly, studies in Drosophila have provided additional insight
into role of the Mbc-ELMO→Rac signaling pathway in multiple tissues. Mutations
in mbc and elmo result in border cell migration
defects in the ovary and myoblast fusion defects in the embryo [25], [26], [27]. Decreased Mbc and ELMO
function exhibit abnormal ommatididal organization in the eye and thorax closure
defects in the adult [27], [28]. In addition, loss-of-function studies have demonstrated
that the Rac genes are required redundantly in a variety of
developmental processes, including border cell migration, myoblast fusion, and axon
guidance in the developing nervous system [27], [29], [30], [31]. Last, genetic interactions exist
between the atypical GEF Mbc-ELMO complex and their target GTPase Rac. A genetic
screen in the eye uncovered an allele of mbc that suppresses the
Rac1 overexpression phenotype [32]. In support of this, removal of one copy of both
Rac1 and Rac2 are capable of ameliorating the
“activated-Rac” phenotype exhibited by co-expression of both Mbc and
ELMO in the eye [27].Although the work cited above provides convincing evidence that the DOCK180/Mbc-ELMO
complex is essential in development, the mechanism by which at least five
Rac-specific DOCK proteins bind to one or more ELMO proteins in vertebrates to
modulate actin regulation in a tissue-specific manner is not clear. DOCK180, DOCK4,
and DOCK5 are broadly expressed in many tissues, including the brain and nervous
system [33]. In
contrast, DOCK2 is expressed specifically in hematopoietic cells, while DOCK3
expression is primarily restricted to the brain and spinal cord [34], [35], [36]. In addition
to their complex expression patterns, DOCK family members exhibit pleiotropic
functions in development. DOCK180 has recently been shown to be required for
Rac-mediated axon outgrowth in cortical neurons in response to netrin-1, neurite
outgrowth as mediated by nerve growth factor, and axon pruning via ephrin-B3 [17], [37], [38]. Mouse knock-outs
show DOCK180 is required in concert with DOCK5 in muscle fusion [39]. DOCK3 (or
modifier of cell adhesion, MOCA) colocalizes with N-cadherin and actin in neuronal
differentiation [36], [40]. MOCA is also linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD),
where it accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles and modulates beta-amyloid (APP)
precursor processing [41], [42], [43]. Consistent with this, mice lacking DOCK3 exhibit axonal
degeneration [44]. Finally, knockdown of DOCK4 results in reduced dendritic
growth and branching in hippocampal neurons [45]. Drosophila
provides an excellent system to characterize this conserved pathway with a single
ELMO ortholog. Using proteomics approaches for identifying new players in the
ELMO-mediated pathway in the developing embryo, we have uncovered Spg, the
Drosophila ortholog of human DOCK3/4, as an ELMO-interacting
protein. In contrast to the well-established role of Mbc in myoblast fusion, Spg is
not required with ELMO in somatic muscle development. However, the two
Drosophila DOCK family members Mbc and Spg are required in the
developing nerve cord. Moreover, Spg can be recruited to the membrane by N-cadherin
in S2 cells, providing a mechanism for Spg localization that may function to mediate
the development of axonal pathways.

Importantly, studies in Drosophila have provided additional insight
into role of the Mbc-ELMO→Rac signaling pathway in multiple tissues. Mutations

Drosophila DOCK family members Mbc and Spg are required in the
developing nerve cord. Moreover, Spg can be recruited to the membrane by N-cadherin
in S2 cells, providing a mechanism for Spg localization that may function to mediate
the development of axonal pathways.

ResultsIdentification of the DOCK3 and DOCK4 ortholog CG31048/Sponge as an
ELMO-interacting proteinTo identify proteins that may interact with ELMO in the developing embryonic
musculature, tissue-specific immunoprecipitations (IPs) were carried out as
described in Geisbrecht, et al [27]. In brief, either
HA-tagged or untagged ELMO, both of which rescue elmo mutants,
were expressed using the muscle-specific
mef2-GAL4 driver. ELMO-specific complexes
were isolated from embryonic lysates with anti-HA resin, digested with trypsin,
and analyzed by Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) mass
spectrometry [46]. In an average of 5 independent experiments, the
percent peptide coverage of ELMO ranged from 43–73% (Figure 1A), while the most
abundant associated protein was Mbc [27]. Peptides corresponding
to the protein CG31048 were detected in lysates immunoprecipitated with tagged
ELMO, but not untagged ELMO. After Mbc, CG31048 was the second most abundant
protein detected, where the percentage of peptide coverage that corresponded to
CG30148 ranged from 2–30%. While the CG31048 cDNA
had not yet been cloned, an abstract from the 2005 fly meeting by Eyal Schejter,
et al., linked this locus to a maternal effect mutant called
sponge (spg), whose name we will use
hereafter. An allele of spg was originally identified by Rice
and Garen [47],
while more alleles emerged from screens in the laboratory of C.
Nusslein-Volhard. Postner, et al., examined the role of Spg in early actin cap
and metaphase furrow formation in early embryonic development [48]. In
addition, the Rorth lab determined that both Mbc and Spg function redundantly in
border cell migration downstream of the receptor PVR [49]. However, the role of Spg
in later embryonic processes has not been examined.10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g001Figure 1Identification of CG31048/Spg as an ELMO-binding protein.(A) Table showing peptide coverage of HA-tagged ELMO in 5 independent
mass spectrometry experiments compared to 3 untagged ELMO control
experiments. Aside from ELMO itself, the most abundant associated
protein detected was Mbc, followed by CG31048. (B) Protein schematic of
Spg and related proteins. Spg is the most similar to vertebrate DOCK3
and DOCK4. The most closely related fly protein is Mbc. SH3
(Src-homology domain-3); DHR-1 (DOCK Homology Region-1); DHR-2 (DOCK
Homology Region-2); PxxP (Proline-rich region). (C) Both tagged and
untagged ELMO are expressed under control of the muscle-specific
mef2-GAL4 driver. Embryonic lysates are
immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and immunoblotted with antisera against
Spg (top panel). Inputs show loading of total ELMO protein (middle
panel) and HA-tagged protein (bottom panel).Spg is most closely related to both mammalian DOCK3/MOCA and DOCK4 and is a CDM
family member whose domain structure is highly similar to Mbc (Figure 1B). All of these
related proteins contain an N-terminal Src-homology 3 domain (SH3), and internal
DOCK homology region-1 (DHR-1) and DOCK homology region-2 (DHR-2) domains. Spg
shares greater amino acid sequence identity to vertebrate DOCK3 and DOCK 4
(42% and 40%, respectively) than Mbc (33%). This primary
amino acid identity/similarity (33%/52%) between Spg and Mbc
decreases to 16% amino acid identity and 21% amino acid in the
C-terminal proline-rich region. Notably, the C-terminal region of Spg contains 7
predicted proline rich sites not present in Mbc. This is similar to vertebrate
analyses of DOCK family members, where the number of proline-rich sites in the
C-terminal region of DOCK3 and DOCK4 is greater than that found in DOCK180 alone
[50]. It is
hypothesized that this region may confer differential properties of DOCK family
function.To confirm a potential physical interaction between ELMO and CG31048, we
generated antisera to the C-terminal region of Spg that is the most divergent
from Mbc. Similar to the MS experiments in which Spg was identified, both
HA-tagged ELMO and untagged ELMO were expressed in the developing musculature
with mef2-GAL4. After preparing embryonic lysates, anti-HA
beads were used to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged and untagged ELMO. Consistent
with results that show both vertebrate DOCK3 and DOCK4 are associated with ELMO
[23],
[51],
Spg could be visualized in an ELMO-associated complex by immunoblotting with
anti-Spg (Figure 1C).Spg mRNA and protein is strongly expressed in the developing nervous
systemPortions of the spg transcript were identified in a screen for
neural precursor genes [52]. We confirmed this using in situ
hybridization analysis that revealed spg mRNA is expressed
strongly in the developing nervous system throughout embryonic development.
In situs showed spg mRNA is detected in
the nervous system primordia and sensory neurons in stage 11 and stage 13
embryos (Figure 2A, B). This
strong expression persisted in the ventral nerve cord until the end of
embryogenesis (Figure 2E,
F). Staining in the visceral mesoderm in stage 13 embryos (Figure 2C, arrowheads)
confirmed the identification of Spg from our muscle-specific MS analysis as the
mef2-GAL4 driver is expressed in both the visceral and
somatic musculature. Similar to mbc
[26],
spg mRNA expression was also apparent in the dorsal vessel
(Figure 2D, E, arrows).
While mbc is also expressed abundantly in the developing
somatic, or body wall musculature [26], spg
expression is low or undetectable in this tissue (Figure 2C, solid lines). Thus,
spg and mbc exhibit overlapping RNA
expression patterns in the developing visceral musculature and dorsal vessel
[26],
while they are uniquely expressed in others. Mbc is strong in the somatic
musculature, while Spg expression is predominant in the developing nervous
system.10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g002Figure 2Spatial expression of Spg in the developing embryo.(A–F) In situ hybridizations of wild-type embryos

ventral midline glial cells (L-L″). Anterior is left and dorsal is
up in A, B, E, G, H. Scale bar = 50 µm.To confirm and extend our mRNA expression analysis, we examined the distribution
of Spg protein using antisera generated against the C-terminal region of Spg.
Consistent with spg mRNA expression, Spg protein was detected
in the ventral nerve cord and visceral mesoderm (Figure 2G, H). A ventral view also revealed
expression in the peripheral neurons (Figure 2I, arrows). In addition, Spg
immunoreactivity was apparent in all longitudinal and commissural neurons (Figures 2J-J″). Spg was
not detected in the general population of glial cells by co-staining with the
glial cell marker Repo at stage 13 (Figure 2K-K″) or the midline glial cell marker Slit at stage
16 (Figure 2L-L″).Spg and ELMO are required for development of the central nervous
systemAll alleles of spg isolated in the laboratory of Christian
Nüsslein-Volhard and analyzed by the Weischaus lab were homozygous viable
and female sterile [48]. Although many of the original alleles were not
available for these studies, a stop codon was identified by sequencing the
spg242 (previously called
spg2) allele (W487*). Consistent with
Postner, et al. [48], we found that eggs produced from
spg242 homozygous mothers with a mutant
paternal allele of spg die early in embryonic development. To
confirm that the lethality of spg is due to the
spg locus, we were able to rescue this lethality by driving
a UAS-spg cDNA with the early nanos-GAL4
driver (n = 208). As maternal spg mutants
die early and could not be examined for defects in later developmental
processes, we examined embryos zygotically mutant for
spg242/spg242 for defects in
nervous system development.For proper innervation of muscles in development, neurons send out actin-rich
growth cones (outgrowth), bundle and unbundle when appropriate (fasciculation),
and make decisions to cross the ventral nerve cord (axon guidance). For all
experiments that include analysis of axon outgrowth and guidance, Fasciclin II
(FasII) was utilized to label three tracts of longitudinal fascicles that run
parallel to the nerve cord. A WT embryo labeled with FasII is shown in Figure 3A. Breaks in the
longitudinal fascicles indicate axon stalling or outgrowth defects, while axons
that cross the ventral midline are misguided. The global neuropile marker BP102
labels all longitudinal and commissural axons, resulting in a ladder-like
appearance of the axonal projections (Figure 3F). Consistent with a maternal
contribution of Spg mRNA and protein, embryos homozygous mutant for the
spg242 allele exhibited minor defects in the
axonal patterns. Labeling with FasII revealed infrequent breaks in the outer
longitudinal tract, while occasional thinning of these tracks were observed with
BP102 (Figures 3B, G; Table 1). We could not
address whether protein was reduced in spg242
animals as the stop codon at AA487 truncates the protein before the region
against which the Spg antibody was produced. Thus, we chose to analyze
spg242 over the deficiency line Df(3R)3450,
which removes the spg locus [53]. In embryos of the
genotype spg242/Df(3R)3450, we observed a similar
percentage of gaps in the outer longtudinal fascicles to that of
spg242/ spg242 (Table 1). Furthermore, the
frequency of outgrowth defects observed in
spg805/Df(3R)3450 and spg242/
spg805 alleleic combinations were consistent (Table 1, Figure S1).
To see if we could observe increased defects via neuronal-specific knockdown of
Spg, we expressed UAS-spg RNAi using the pan-neuronal driver
C155-GAL4. In addition to increased axon outgrowth defects
(Table 1), we observed
occasional bifurcated bundles, indicative of fasisculation or abnormal fusion
defects (Figure
S1E). The localization of spg expression in the
developing nerve cord and Spg-ELMO complex based upon mass spectrometry results
led us to examine the role of elmo genetically in development
of the CNS. As predicted based upon the maternal contribution of ELMO mRNA and
protein, embryos homozygous mutant for
elmo19F3exhibited minor defects in axonal
patterning. FasII labeling revealed a nearly wild-type pattern of all
longitudinal fascicles, while occasional thinning of these tracks and increased
length of adjacent segments were observed with BP102 (Figures 3C, H; Table 1). As described in Geisbrecht et al.,
this allele contains a stop codon at amino acid 393 and appears to be null as
removal of both the maternal and zygotic contribution of elmo
by germline clone analysis (GLC) resulted in early embryonic lethality [27].
Consistent with this, FasII staining in embryos homozygous for the deletion
allele elmoko
[49] appeared
normal (Table 2) and also
resulted in early embryonic lethality when analyzed by GLC analysis. To reduce
elmo function, yet allow animals to survive until the later
stages of embryogensis when CNS development occurs, we used a hypomorphic
elmo allele for GLC analysis [27]. In representative
embryos maternally and zygotically mutant for
elmoPB[c06760], a dramatic
increase in axonal patterning defects were observed. In addition to an increased
number of outer fascicle gaps, we saw aberrant midline crossing of longitudinal
axons, and misrouting of outer longitudinal axons (Figures 3D, I; Table 2). This suggests that
elmo functions in CNS development in addition to its role
in myoblast fusion and border cell migration [27], [49].10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g003Figure 3Embryos with loss of both zygotic elmo and

contribution.**indicates p<0.05 using student T-test compared to single
mutants alone.ND = not determined.If two genes act in the same pathway, transheterozygosity for the two genes of
interest may result in a phenotype stronger than the single mutants alone. This
type of experiment is complicated in the case of elmo and
spg, which are both contributed maternally. To examine if
loss-of-function phenotypes could be exacerbated by removal of genes that
function in the same pathway, zygotic embryos of the genotype
elmo19F3/elmo19F3;
spg242/spg242 were analyzed.
Compared to elmo/elmo (0.0%;
n = 133) or spg/spg (10.0%;
n = 100) single mutants, a consistent increase in
longitudinal axon defects were observed in the double mutants (37.7%;
n = 106; Table 2). In addition, we observed an increase in axons that
inappropriately cross the midline (Table 2). A representative example is shown
in Figure 3E and quantified
in Figure 3K. By BP102
staining, abnormalities in the spacing between adjacent segments was also
enhanced (Figure 3J). There
are two possibilities to explain this result: (1) the double mutant is
phenotypically stronger than either single mutant as the residual maternal
products are compromised; or (2) the stronger phenotypes observed in the double
mutant combination are a result of two pathways being affected. The two
possibilities are not mutually exclusive. We favor the first hypothesis as we
know Elmo-Spg are found in a complex based upon our MS and IP results.
Furthermore, we do not observe genetic interactions with other candidates that
may function with elmo.No muscle patterning defects are observed in mutants lacking SpgBased upon the complementary expression patterns for mbc and
spg in the somatic musculature and developing CNS,
respectively, an attractive notion would be that ELMO binds to and functions
with Mbc and Spg in a tissue-specific manner. To explore this, we examined
phenotypes of single and/or double mutants in both muscle and nervous system
development. Consistent with our above results that removal of zygotic
spg exhibited almost wild-type axonal patterning, no
myoblast fusion defects were observed in zygotic
spg242/spg242 mutant embryos
(Figure 4A). In
addition, we did not observe unfused myoblasts just under the somatic muscle
layer (data not shown). In contrast to defects observed in the CNS in
elmo; spg double mutants, analysis of the
final muscle pattern in these embryos appeared wild-type (Figure 4B). As previously reported,
loss-of-function mutations in mbc resulted in strong myoblast
fusion defects in the developing embryo [11], [26]. In homozygous embryos
mutant for mbcD11.2, the myoblasts were competent to
migrate to the founder cells where fusion normally takes place, while fusion did
not occur (Figure 4C). To
examine if spg may be functioning redundantly with
mbc in myoblast migration, the distribution of myoblasts
was examined in mbcD11.2,
spg242/mbcD11.2,
spg242 double mutants. While the myoblasts
fail to fuse as in mbc mutants, they were still capable of
clustering around the founder cells, suggesting that myoblast migration was not
affected (Figure 4D).10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g004Figure 4Loss of zygotic spg is not sufficient to reveal
myoblast fusion defects.(A–D) Lateral views of stage 16 embryos stained with anti-MHC to

Myoblasts fail to fuse but cluster around founder cells (arrows) in
mbc mutants (C) and spg,

bar = 10 µm.Both Spg and Mbc are required for axonal patterningThe experiments above indicate Spg is not required in embryonic muscle
development. To further examine if Spg is the only DOCK family member required
for axonal patterning, we examined the potential contribution of Mbc in the
developing nervous system. Similar to defects already observed in
spg mutants, embryos homozygous mutant for
mbcD11.2 exhibited breaks in the outer
longitudinal fascicles (Figure
5A; Table 2).
In addition, we observed collapse of axons onto the MP1 fascicle tracts (data
not shown). This extends and supports observations by Nolan, et al., where it
was determined that embryos transheterozygous for
mbc1.63/mbc4.25
exhibited ventral nerve cord defects upon examination with BP102 [32]. Our
analysis using BP102 phenocopies their results, where we observed thinning of
the longitudinal axon tracts and abnormal spacing between segments (Figure 5C). This suggests that
low expression of mbc, possibly undetected in the CNS due to
high expression in the muscle, contributes to nervous system formation.10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g005Figure 5CNS defects are enhanced in embryos missing both spg
and mbc.Late stage 16 or stage 17 embryos stained with anti-FasII (A, B, E, F)

mbc mutants have more discontinuities in the
outermost fascicles (A, arrowhead) and thinner longitudinal axons (C,
arrowheads). (B, D) Mutants missing both spg and

longitudinal fascicles (arrowhead) and abnormal crossovers (arrows).
BP102 staining (D) shows a severe thinning of axons (arrowhead) and

segments denoted by line in panels C and D). (E, F) Lateral views of
stage 16 embryos stained with anti-FasII show abnormal positioning of
the ventral nerve cord in spg, mbc
mutants (F, arrow) compared to mbc mutants alone (E).
Anterior is up in panels A–D. Anterior is left and dorsal is up in
panels E, F.As Spg and Mbc are the two DOCK family members predicted to be specific for Rac
and mutations in either one exhibit defects in the nervous system, we sought to
examine if embryos mutant for both mbc and spg
resulted in enhanced nervous system defects. We did not observe a significant
increase in broken fascicles or the collapse of the outer longitudinal tracts in
mbc, spg double mutants over
mbc mutants alone (Figure 5B, Table 2). However, we did observe an increase
in midline fascicle crossing in these double mutants (Figure 5B, arrows, Table 1). There was also an increase in
abnormal positioning of the ventral nerve cord in mbc,
spg double mutants, where 48.2% of mutant embryos
(n = 56) exhibited abnormal swerving of the nerve cord seen
on the ventral side (Figure 5B,
5D) or abnormal bends in lateral views (Figure 5F compared to Figure 5E), which was rare in single mutants
of spg (0.0%; n = 23) or
mbc mutants (0.8%; n = 22). The
above data suggests Mbc may be the primary DOCK family member in tissues like
the muscle, while both Spg and Mbc may function in other tissues, such as CNS
development and border cell migration.Expression of N-cadherin is sufficient to recruit Spg to the membrane in S2
cellsScanning through our list of potential MS candidates, N-cadherin (Ncad) emerged
as a possible upstream receptor to mediate signaling via DOCK-ELMO complexes,
albeit at low levels. Furthermore, Ncad is expressed in the embryonic fly
nervous system and vertebrate MOCA/DOCK3 colocalizes with Ncad in regions of
cell-cell contact in the nerve cell line PC12 [40], [54]. Thus, Ncad seemed a
reasonable candidate to examine it's involvement with DOCK-ELMO complexes
in CNS development. To gain insight into a potential Ncad-Spg interaction, we
examined the subcellular distribution of Spg and Ncad protein in
Drosophila S2 cells. RT-PCR results show that
spg is endogenously expressed in S2 cells (data not shown).
Furthermore, staining with anti-Spg antibody reveals a cytoplasmic localization
of the protein (Figure 6A).
As S2 cells do not endogenously express Ncad, cells transfected
with full-length Ncad were stained for Ncad and Spg protein. In transfected
cells, Ncad was detected at the membrane and was capable of aggregating with
other Ncad(+) cells (Figure
6B′), a hallmark of the homotypic cell adhesion properties of
the Cadherin family of proteins [54]. The subcellular distribution of Spg was cytoplasmic
in Ncad(−) cells (Figure 6A,
6A″, 6B, 6B″), but became membrane localized upon
expression of Ncad (Figure
6A′, 6A″). In Ncad(+) cells that formed clusters,
Spg localization was enriched at the membrane between adjacent cells (Figure 6B′, 6B″).
To quantify these observations, we acquired confocal images of S2 cells both
with and without Ncad expression. As shown in Fig. 6, we observed membrane-enriched Spg in
89.2% of cells (n = 102) of Ncad (+) cells
compared to 0.04% of S2 cells that do not express Ncad
(n = 210).10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g006Figure 6Expression of N-cadherin is sufficient to recruit Spg to the

staining (closed arrowhead), most notably at sites of cell-cell contact

percentage of S2 cells were scored for either membrane or cytoplasmic

Ncad in S2 cells, we wondered if removal of Ncad could increase the severity of
spg242/spg242 axonal phenotypes.
As previously reported for other Ncad alleles, mutants for
Ncad405/Ncad405(Ncad) alone show
mild CNS defects (Figure 7A;
Table 2) [54]. The
Clandinin lab created mutants that remove both Ncad and the
recently characterized N-cadherin2 (Ncad,
Ncad2 double mutant, hereafter called
NcadΔ14) [55]. Thus, we examined
NcadΔ14mutants to determine if these
proteins may function redundantly in CNS development. It appears the
contribution of Ncad2 is minor or negligible as our results do
not show quantifiable differences between Ncad mutants alone or
NcadΔ14/NcadΔ14
double mutants (Table 2).
Removal of one copy of NcadΔ14 in a
spg242/spg242 homozygous mutant
background increased the occurance of axon outgrowth defects over
spg242 mutants alone (Table 2). To examine this further, we also
quantitated embryos double mutant for both
NcadΔ14 and
spg242. We observed a modest, although
significant increase in axon outgrowth phenotypes over
NcadΔ14 mutants alone (Figure 7C, Table 2). Consistent with
this, NcadΔ14,
elmo19F3 double mutants exhibited a consistent
enhancement of axonal breaks (Figure 7D, Table
2), although no increase in midline guidance errors. However, in both
double mutant combinations, we also observed qualitatively different and/or
stronger phenotypes than that observed in the single mutants alone. For example,
we also observed a greater than additive increase in ectopic midline crossing in
NcadΔ14;
spg242 double mutants (23.0%) over
NcadΔ14 (3.0%) or
spg242 (0.0%) mutants alone. In
NcadΔ14,
elmo19F3 double mutants, the embryos showed an
increase in collapsed outer longitudinal axon tracts onto the MP1 fascicle
(Figure 7D, asterisks),
a phenotype not observed in NcadΔ14 or
elmo19F3 mutants alone. These data taken
together suggest that the maternal load of spg or
elmo may be masking phenotypes until the levels of an
upstream component is compromised. An alternative explanation is that Ncad, Spg
or Elmo may also have functions independent of one another in CNS development.
Although mbc is required for axon outgrowth (Figure 5A), we did not observe
an increase in axonal outgrowth or guidance defects upon removal of Ncad (Figure 7E), suggesting that
Mbc may function independently.10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g007Figure 7Genetic interactions between Ncadherin,

double mutants versus the NcadΔ14 or

double mutants of NcadΔ14;
mbc do not show a significant increase in axonal
defects over the single mutants alone.

Identification of the DOCK3 and DOCK4 ortholog CG31048/Sponge as an
ELMO-interacting proteinTo identify proteins that may interact with ELMO in the developing embryonic
musculature, tissue-specific immunoprecipitations (IPs) were carried out as
described in Geisbrecht, et al [27]. In brief, either
HA-tagged or untagged ELMO, both of which rescue elmo mutants,
were expressed using the muscle-specific
mef2-GAL4 driver. ELMO-specific complexes
were isolated from embryonic lysates with anti-HA resin, digested with trypsin,
and analyzed by Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) mass
spectrometry [46]. In an average of 5 independent experiments, the
percent peptide coverage of ELMO ranged from 43–73% (Figure 1A), while the most
abundant associated protein was Mbc [27]. Peptides corresponding
to the protein CG31048 were detected in lysates immunoprecipitated with tagged
ELMO, but not untagged ELMO. After Mbc, CG31048 was the second most abundant
protein detected, where the percentage of peptide coverage that corresponded to
CG30148 ranged from 2–30%. While the CG31048 cDNA
had not yet been cloned, an abstract from the 2005 fly meeting by Eyal Schejter,
et al., linked this locus to a maternal effect mutant called
sponge (spg), whose name we will use
hereafter. An allele of spg was originally identified by Rice
and Garen [47],
while more alleles emerged from screens in the laboratory of C.
Nusslein-Volhard. Postner, et al., examined the role of Spg in early actin cap
and metaphase furrow formation in early embryonic development [48]. In
addition, the Rorth lab determined that both Mbc and Spg function redundantly in
border cell migration downstream of the receptor PVR [49]. However, the role of Spg
in later embryonic processes has not been examined.10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g001Figure 1Identification of CG31048/Spg as an ELMO-binding protein.(A) Table showing peptide coverage of HA-tagged ELMO in 5 independent

family member whose domain structure is highly similar to Mbc (Figure 1B). All of these
related proteins contain an N-terminal Src-homology 3 domain (SH3), and internal
DOCK homology region-1 (DHR-1) and DOCK homology region-2 (DHR-2) domains. Spg
shares greater amino acid sequence identity to vertebrate DOCK3 and DOCK 4
(42% and 40%, respectively) than Mbc (33%). This primary
amino acid identity/similarity (33%/52%) between Spg and Mbc
decreases to 16% amino acid identity and 21% amino acid in the
C-terminal proline-rich region. Notably, the C-terminal region of Spg contains 7
predicted proline rich sites not present in Mbc. This is similar to vertebrate
analyses of DOCK family members, where the number of proline-rich sites in the
C-terminal region of DOCK3 and DOCK4 is greater than that found in DOCK180 alone
[50]. It is
hypothesized that this region may confer differential properties of DOCK family
function.To confirm a potential physical interaction between ELMO and CG31048, we
generated antisera to the C-terminal region of Spg that is the most divergent
from Mbc. Similar to the MS experiments in which Spg was identified, both
HA-tagged ELMO and untagged ELMO were expressed in the developing musculature
with mef2-GAL4. After preparing embryonic lysates, anti-HA
beads were used to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged and untagged ELMO. Consistent
with results that show both vertebrate DOCK3 and DOCK4 are associated with ELMO
[23],
[51],
Spg could be visualized in an ELMO-associated complex by immunoblotting with
anti-Spg (Figure 1C).

Spg and ELMO are required for development of the central nervous
systemAll alleles of spg isolated in the laboratory of Christian
Nüsslein-Volhard and analyzed by the Weischaus lab were homozygous viable
and female sterile [48]. Although many of the original alleles were not
available for these studies, a stop codon was identified by sequencing the
spg242 (previously called
spg2) allele (W487*). Consistent with
Postner, et al. [48], we found that eggs produced from
spg242 homozygous mothers with a mutant
paternal allele of spg die early in embryonic development. To
confirm that the lethality of spg is due to the
spg locus, we were able to rescue this lethality by driving
a UAS-spg cDNA with the early nanos-GAL4
driver (n = 208). As maternal spg mutants
die early and could not be examined for defects in later developmental
processes, we examined embryos zygotically mutant for
spg242/spg242 for defects in
nervous system development.For proper innervation of muscles in development, neurons send out actin-rich
growth cones (outgrowth), bundle and unbundle when appropriate (fasciculation),
and make decisions to cross the ventral nerve cord (axon guidance). For all
experiments that include analysis of axon outgrowth and guidance, Fasciclin II
(FasII) was utilized to label three tracts of longitudinal fascicles that run
parallel to the nerve cord. A WT embryo labeled with FasII is shown in Figure 3A. Breaks in the
longitudinal fascicles indicate axon stalling or outgrowth defects, while axons
that cross the ventral midline are misguided. The global neuropile marker BP102
labels all longitudinal and commissural axons, resulting in a ladder-like
appearance of the axonal projections (Figure 3F). Consistent with a maternal
contribution of Spg mRNA and protein, embryos homozygous mutant for the
spg242 allele exhibited minor defects in the
axonal patterns. Labeling with FasII revealed infrequent breaks in the outer
longitudinal tract, while occasional thinning of these tracks were observed with
BP102 (Figures 3B, G; Table 1). We could not
address whether protein was reduced in spg242
animals as the stop codon at AA487 truncates the protein before the region
against which the Spg antibody was produced. Thus, we chose to analyze
spg242 over the deficiency line Df(3R)3450,
which removes the spg locus [53]. In embryos of the
genotype spg242/Df(3R)3450, we observed a similar
percentage of gaps in the outer longtudinal fascicles to that of
spg242/ spg242 (Table 1). Furthermore, the
frequency of outgrowth defects observed in
spg805/Df(3R)3450 and spg242/
spg805 alleleic combinations were consistent (Table 1, Figure S1).
To see if we could observe increased defects via neuronal-specific knockdown of
Spg, we expressed UAS-spg RNAi using the pan-neuronal driver
C155-GAL4. In addition to increased axon outgrowth defects
(Table 1), we observed
occasional bifurcated bundles, indicative of fasisculation or abnormal fusion
defects (Figure
S1E). The localization of spg expression in the
developing nerve cord and Spg-ELMO complex based upon mass spectrometry results
led us to examine the role of elmo genetically in development
of the CNS. As predicted based upon the maternal contribution of ELMO mRNA and
protein, embryos homozygous mutant for
elmo19F3exhibited minor defects in axonal
patterning. FasII labeling revealed a nearly wild-type pattern of all
longitudinal fascicles, while occasional thinning of these tracks and increased
length of adjacent segments were observed with BP102 (Figures 3C, H; Table 1). As described in Geisbrecht et al.,
this allele contains a stop codon at amino acid 393 and appears to be null as
removal of both the maternal and zygotic contribution of elmo
by germline clone analysis (GLC) resulted in early embryonic lethality [27].
Consistent with this, FasII staining in embryos homozygous for the deletion
allele elmoko
[49] appeared
normal (Table 2) and also
resulted in early embryonic lethality when analyzed by GLC analysis. To reduce
elmo function, yet allow animals to survive until the later
stages of embryogensis when CNS development occurs, we used a hypomorphic
elmo allele for GLC analysis [27]. In representative
embryos maternally and zygotically mutant for
elmoPB[c06760], a dramatic
increase in axonal patterning defects were observed. In addition to an increased
number of outer fascicle gaps, we saw aberrant midline crossing of longitudinal
axons, and misrouting of outer longitudinal axons (Figures 3D, I; Table 2). This suggests that
elmo functions in CNS development in addition to its role
in myoblast fusion and border cell migration [27], [49].10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g003Figure 3Embryos with loss of both zygotic elmo and

type of experiment is complicated in the case of elmo and

loss-of-function phenotypes could be exacerbated by removal of genes that
function in the same pathway, zygotic embryos of the genotype
elmo19F3/elmo19F3;
spg242/spg242 were analyzed.
Compared to elmo/elmo (0.0%;
n = 133) or spg/spg (10.0%;
n = 100) single mutants, a consistent increase in
longitudinal axon defects were observed in the double mutants (37.7%;
n = 106; Table 2). In addition, we observed an increase in axons that
inappropriately cross the midline (Table 2). A representative example is shown
in Figure 3E and quantified
in Figure 3K. By BP102
staining, abnormalities in the spacing between adjacent segments was also
enhanced (Figure 3J). There
are two possibilities to explain this result: (1) the double mutant is
phenotypically stronger than either single mutant as the residual maternal
products are compromised; or (2) the stronger phenotypes observed in the double
mutant combination are a result of two pathways being affected. The two
possibilities are not mutually exclusive. We favor the first hypothesis as we
know Elmo-Spg are found in a complex based upon our MS and IP results.
Furthermore, we do not observe genetic interactions with other candidates that
may function with elmo.

If two genes act in the same pathway, transheterozygosity for the two genes of
interest may result in a phenotype stronger than the single mutants alone. This
type of experiment is complicated in the case of elmo and
spg, which are both contributed maternally. To examine if
loss-of-function phenotypes could be exacerbated by removal of genes that
function in the same pathway, zygotic embryos of the genotype
elmo19F3/elmo19F3;
spg242/spg242 were analyzed.
Compared to elmo/elmo (0.0%;
n = 133) or spg/spg (10.0%;
n = 100) single mutants, a consistent increase in
longitudinal axon defects were observed in the double mutants (37.7%;

inappropriately cross the midline (Table 2). A representative example is shown
in Figure 3E and quantified

staining, abnormalities in the spacing between adjacent segments was also
enhanced (Figure 3J). There
are two possibilities to explain this result: (1) the double mutant is
phenotypically stronger than either single mutant as the residual maternal

mutant combination are a result of two pathways being affected. The two
possibilities are not mutually exclusive. We favor the first hypothesis as we
know Elmo-Spg are found in a complex based upon our MS and IP results.
Furthermore, we do not observe genetic interactions with other candidates that
may function with elmo.

No muscle patterning defects are observed in mutants lacking SpgBased upon the complementary expression patterns for mbc and
spg in the somatic musculature and developing CNS,
respectively, an attractive notion would be that ELMO binds to and functions
with Mbc and Spg in a tissue-specific manner. To explore this, we examined
phenotypes of single and/or double mutants in both muscle and nervous system
development. Consistent with our above results that removal of zygotic
spg exhibited almost wild-type axonal patterning, no
myoblast fusion defects were observed in zygotic
spg242/spg242 mutant embryos
(Figure 4A). In
addition, we did not observe unfused myoblasts just under the somatic muscle
layer (data not shown). In contrast to defects observed in the CNS in
elmo; spg double mutants, analysis of the
final muscle pattern in these embryos appeared wild-type (Figure 4B). As previously reported,
loss-of-function mutations in mbc resulted in strong myoblast
fusion defects in the developing embryo [11], [26]. In homozygous embryos
mutant for mbcD11.2, the myoblasts were competent to
migrate to the founder cells where fusion normally takes place, while fusion did
not occur (Figure 4C). To
examine if spg may be functioning redundantly with
mbc in myoblast migration, the distribution of myoblasts
was examined in mbcD11.2,
spg242/mbcD11.2,
spg242 double mutants. While the myoblasts
fail to fuse as in mbc mutants, they were still capable of
clustering around the founder cells, suggesting that myoblast migration was not
affected (Figure 4D).10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g004Figure 4Loss of zygotic spg is not sufficient to reveal

respectively, an attractive notion would be that ELMO binds to and functions
with Mbc and Spg in a tissue-specific manner. To explore this, we examined
phenotypes of single and/or double mutants in both muscle and nervous system
development. Consistent with our above results that removal of zygotic
spg exhibited almost wild-type axonal patterning, no
myoblast fusion defects were observed in zygotic
spg242/spg242 mutant embryos
(Figure 4A). In
addition, we did not observe unfused myoblasts just under the somatic muscle
layer (data not shown). In contrast to defects observed in the CNS in
elmo; spg double mutants, analysis of the
final muscle pattern in these embryos appeared wild-type (Figure 4B). As previously reported,
loss-of-function mutations in mbc resulted in strong myoblast
fusion defects in the developing embryo [11], [26]. In homozygous embryos
mutant for mbcD11.2, the myoblasts were competent to
migrate to the founder cells where fusion normally takes place, while fusion did
not occur (Figure 4C). To
examine if spg may be functioning redundantly with
mbc in myoblast migration, the distribution of myoblasts
was examined in mbcD11.2,
spg242/mbcD11.2,
spg242 double mutants. While the myoblasts
fail to fuse as in mbc mutants, they were still capable of
clustering around the founder cells, suggesting that myoblast migration was not
affected (Figure 4D).

Loss of zygotic spg is not sufficient to reveal
myoblast fusion defects.

Both Spg and Mbc are required for axonal patterningThe experiments above indicate Spg is not required in embryonic muscle
development. To further examine if Spg is the only DOCK family member required
for axonal patterning, we examined the potential contribution of Mbc in the
developing nervous system. Similar to defects already observed in
spg mutants, embryos homozygous mutant for
mbcD11.2 exhibited breaks in the outer
longitudinal fascicles (Figure
5A; Table 2).
In addition, we observed collapse of axons onto the MP1 fascicle tracts (data
not shown). This extends and supports observations by Nolan, et al., where it
was determined that embryos transheterozygous for
mbc1.63/mbc4.25
exhibited ventral nerve cord defects upon examination with BP102 [32]. Our
analysis using BP102 phenocopies their results, where we observed thinning of
the longitudinal axon tracts and abnormal spacing between segments (Figure 5C). This suggests that
low expression of mbc, possibly undetected in the CNS due to
high expression in the muscle, contributes to nervous system formation.10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g005Figure 5CNS defects are enhanced in embryos missing both spg

resulted in enhanced nervous system defects. We did not observe a significant
increase in broken fascicles or the collapse of the outer longitudinal tracts in
mbc, spg double mutants over
mbc mutants alone (Figure 5B, Table 2). However, we did observe an increase
in midline fascicle crossing in these double mutants (Figure 5B, arrows, Table 1). There was also an increase in
abnormal positioning of the ventral nerve cord in mbc,
spg double mutants, where 48.2% of mutant embryos
(n = 56) exhibited abnormal swerving of the nerve cord seen
on the ventral side (Figure 5B,
5D) or abnormal bends in lateral views (Figure 5F compared to Figure 5E), which was rare in single mutants
of spg (0.0%; n = 23) or
mbc mutants (0.8%; n = 22). The
above data suggests Mbc may be the primary DOCK family member in tissues like
the muscle, while both Spg and Mbc may function in other tissues, such as CNS
development and border cell migration.

Expression of N-cadherin is sufficient to recruit Spg to the membrane in S2
cellsScanning through our list of potential MS candidates, N-cadherin (Ncad) emerged
as a possible upstream receptor to mediate signaling via DOCK-ELMO complexes,
albeit at low levels. Furthermore, Ncad is expressed in the embryonic fly
nervous system and vertebrate MOCA/DOCK3 colocalizes with Ncad in regions of
cell-cell contact in the nerve cell line PC12 [40], [54]. Thus, Ncad seemed a
reasonable candidate to examine it's involvement with DOCK-ELMO complexes
in CNS development. To gain insight into a potential Ncad-Spg interaction, we
examined the subcellular distribution of Spg and Ncad protein in
Drosophila S2 cells. RT-PCR results show that
spg is endogenously expressed in S2 cells (data not shown).
Furthermore, staining with anti-Spg antibody reveals a cytoplasmic localization
of the protein (Figure 6A).
As S2 cells do not endogenously express Ncad, cells transfected
with full-length Ncad were stained for Ncad and Spg protein. In transfected
cells, Ncad was detected at the membrane and was capable of aggregating with
other Ncad(+) cells (Figure
6B′), a hallmark of the homotypic cell adhesion properties of
the Cadherin family of proteins [54]. The subcellular distribution of Spg was cytoplasmic
in Ncad(−) cells (Figure 6A,
6A″, 6B, 6B″), but became membrane localized upon
expression of Ncad (Figure
6A′, 6A″). In Ncad(+) cells that formed clusters,
Spg localization was enriched at the membrane between adjacent cells (Figure 6B′, 6B″).
To quantify these observations, we acquired confocal images of S2 cells both
with and without Ncad expression. As shown in Fig. 6, we observed membrane-enriched Spg in
89.2% of cells (n = 102) of Ncad (+) cells
compared to 0.04% of S2 cells that do not express Ncad
(n = 210).10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g006Figure 6Expression of N-cadherin is sufficient to recruit Spg to the

Genetic analysis of Ncad-Spg mutantsBased upon the results that Spg is enriched at the membrane upon expression of
Ncad in S2 cells, we wondered if removal of Ncad could increase the severity of
spg242/spg242 axonal phenotypes.
As previously reported for other Ncad alleles, mutants for
Ncad405/Ncad405(Ncad) alone show
mild CNS defects (Figure 7A;
Table 2) [54]. The
Clandinin lab created mutants that remove both Ncad and the
recently characterized N-cadherin2 (Ncad,
Ncad2 double mutant, hereafter called
NcadΔ14) [55]. Thus, we examined
NcadΔ14mutants to determine if these
proteins may function redundantly in CNS development. It appears the
contribution of Ncad2 is minor or negligible as our results do
not show quantifiable differences between Ncad mutants alone or
NcadΔ14/NcadΔ14
double mutants (Table 2).
Removal of one copy of NcadΔ14 in a
spg242/spg242 homozygous mutant
background increased the occurance of axon outgrowth defects over
spg242 mutants alone (Table 2). To examine this further, we also
quantitated embryos double mutant for both
NcadΔ14 and
spg242. We observed a modest, although
significant increase in axon outgrowth phenotypes over
NcadΔ14 mutants alone (Figure 7C, Table 2). Consistent with
this, NcadΔ14,
elmo19F3 double mutants exhibited a consistent
enhancement of axonal breaks (Figure 7D, Table
2), although no increase in midline guidance errors. However, in both
double mutant combinations, we also observed qualitatively different and/or
stronger phenotypes than that observed in the single mutants alone. For example,
we also observed a greater than additive increase in ectopic midline crossing in
NcadΔ14;
spg242 double mutants (23.0%) over
NcadΔ14 (3.0%) or
spg242 (0.0%) mutants alone. In
NcadΔ14,
elmo19F3 double mutants, the embryos showed an
increase in collapsed outer longitudinal axon tracts onto the MP1 fascicle
(Figure 7D, asterisks),
a phenotype not observed in NcadΔ14 or
elmo19F3 mutants alone. These data taken
together suggest that the maternal load of spg or
elmo may be masking phenotypes until the levels of an
upstream component is compromised. An alternative explanation is that Ncad, Spg
or Elmo may also have functions independent of one another in CNS development.
Although mbc is required for axon outgrowth (Figure 5A), we did not observe
an increase in axonal outgrowth or guidance defects upon removal of Ncad (Figure 7E), suggesting that
Mbc may function independently.10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g007Figure 7Genetic interactions between Ncadherin,

Based upon the results that Spg is enriched at the membrane upon expression of
Ncad in S2 cells, we wondered if removal of Ncad could increase the severity of
spg242/spg242 axonal phenotypes.

DiscussionRecent investigations of vertebrate DOCK family proteins demonstrate that DOCK-ELMO
complexes function together to regulate downstream GTPases, namely Rac. In this
study, we uncover the Drosophila DOCK family member Spg, and find
that mutations in elmo, spg, or
mbc exhibit abnormal axonal patterning in the embryonic CNS.
Ncad is capable of relocating cytosolic Spg to the membrane in S2 cells.
Furthermore, we found that mutations in Ncad dominantly enhance the
axonal outgrowth phenotypes of spg mutants and that
Ncad; spg and Ncad,
elmo double mutants have more severe CNS phenotypes. Taken
together, these data indicate (1) that Ncad, Spg, and Elmo may function together
during axonal outgrowth, (2) that the severe double mutant phenotypes reflect a
decrease in the function of maternally loaded components that were masked in single
mutants, and/or (3) the double mutant defects represent a disruption of multiple
signaling pathways.Identification and characterization of Spg, a DOCK family memberWe identified peptides corresponding to the uncharacterized protein CG31048 in an
in vivo mass spectrometry approach to identify ELMO-binding
partners. The CG31048 locus, which encodes for Sponge, is a
member of the growing family of Drosophila DOCK family
proteins. This report is the second identification of a DOCK family member in
flies since the role of Mbc was uncovered in 1997 [26]. The 11 vertebrate DOCK
proteins identified thus far can be divided into subgroups based upon primary
sequence analysis and GTPase target specificity for either Rac or Cdc42 [5], [10], [50]. In the
first group, the DOCK-A family consists of DOCK180, DOCK2, and DOCK 5, while the
DOCK-B subfamily is comprised of DOCK3 and DOCK4. In flies, this redundancy is
simplified with the 2 DOCK family members, Mbc and Spg, whom are members of the
DOCK-A and DOCK-B groups, respectively. All of the above family members contain
an N-terminal SH3 domain, 2 internal DHR (CZH) domains and a variable C-terminal
proline-rich region. Furthermore, they function as unconventional guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the GTPase Rac. Members of the DOCK-C
(DOCK 6, DOCK7, DOCK8) subfamily and DOCK-D (DOCK9, DOCK10, DOCK11) subfamily
bind to the GTPase Cdc42. The 2 orthologous Drosophila proteins, CG42533/Dm ziz
(DOCK-C) and CG11376/Dm zir (DOCK-D) have not yet been characterized in
flies.Alleles of spg were originally identified in a maternal effect
screen and later characterized for their role in actin-dependent events in early
Drosophila embryogenesis [47], [48]. Our mRNA and protein
expression analysis suggested Spg may be required after cellularization due to
strong expression in the visceral mesoderm, dorsal vessel, and developing
ventral nerve cord. As removal of the maternal contribution of
spg null alleles results in early embryonic lethality, the
role for spg in later developmental processes had not been
examined. However, the identification of Spg as an ELMO-interacting protein gave
us insight into how to examine the role of Spg in late embryogenesis using
double mutant analysis. While zygotic single mutants of spg and
elmo appeared essentially wild-type, removal of both the
zygotic contribution of both spg and elmo
resulted in axonal patterning defects. We favor the hypothesis that the maternal
contribution of both Elmo and Spg mask any embryonic phenotypes until the levels
of both proteins are compromised. Alternatively, though not mutually exclusive,
is the possibility that Elmo and Spg function in parallel pathways and our
observed phenotypes are a result of these additive effects. As mentioned above,
removal of either spg or elmo maternal
contribution results in early embryonic lethality [27]. As
spg has shown to be required for early actin cap and
metaphase furrow formation, it is fair to hypothesize that that these two genes
may function in concert in early embryo development, where Mbc is not
required.Downstream GTPase of the DOCK-ELMO complexesVertebrate DOCK 4 was originally identified as a CDM family member capable of
activating the small GTPase Rap1 in GTPase pull-down assays [56].
Functionally, a deletion of endogenous DOCK4 in osteosarcoma cells was shown to
rescue the formation of adherens junctions and could be suppressed by
co-expression of dominant-negative Rap1 [56]. Recent studies have
demonstrated that DOCK 4 is also capable of activating the GTPase Rac1 [45], [51], [57]. This data
suggests that GTPase activation of either Rac and/or Rap1 by the Spg-ELMO
complex is context and/or tissue-dependent. Our current model for DOCK-ELMO
function in embryogenesis is shown in Figure 8. Only the Mbc-ELMO complex functions
in the developing musculature to activate the GTPase Rac. While it is clear that
regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is downstream of the Mbc-ELMO→Rac
signaling pathway, the upstream receptors that mediate this signaling are
unknown. Our data suggests that both Mbc and Spg function in the
Drosophila developing nervous system. All literature thus
far supports a model whereby the Mbc-ELMO complex activates Rac. Alternatively,
the Spg-ELMO complex may regulate Rac and/or Rap1 activity. If both the Mbc-ELMO
and Spg-ELMO protein complexes function upstream of Rac, they may be acting
redundantly to regulate Rac-dependent actin cytoskeletal changes. Alternatively,
the downstream effector functions of Rac activity may lead to changes in
cell-cell adhesion or may be mediated through the GTPase Rap1. We hypothesize
that differences in the C-terminal proline-rich regions of Mbc and Spg may be
responsible for their differential activities. In myoblast fusion, the
proline-rich region of Mbc is not required [11]. However, Spg and
vertebrate DOCK3/4 contain additional proline-rich sites not present in
Mbc/DOCK180. Further experiments will be necessary to define the cellular and
molecular mechanisms necessary to carry out DOCK-ELMO functions in the
developing CNS.10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g008Figure 8Model of CDM-Elmo pathway.In the muscle, Mbc is the sole CDM family member that functions with Elmo
to mediate cytoskeletal modifications through the GTPase Rac (left
panel). In a neuronal cell (right panel), both Mbc and Spg contribute to
nervous system formation. In this model, the Mbc-Elmo complex is
downstream of yet unidentified proteins and presumably signals through
Rac. In contrast, our data suggests Spg-Elmo may function downstream of
Ncad. The target of the Spg-Elmo complex, whether it be Rac and/or Rap
is unclear.Regulation of GEF activityELMO expression is ubiquitous throughout fly development, while Mbc and Spg
expression is predominant in the muscle and nervous system, respectively. Based
upon the tissue-specific expression patterns of Mbc and Spg, we originally
hypothesized that complementary expression patterns may be one mechanism for the
tissue-specific regulation of Rac activation through the DOCK-ELMO complexes.
However, our results indicate that the role of Mbc-ELMO and Spg-ELMO is more
complicated. While the Mbc-ELMO complex seems to be the primary GEF complex for
Rac activation in the musculature, both the Mbc-ELMO and Spg-ELMO complexes may
both be necessary to correctly pattern axons in the developing central nervous
system. In support of the idea that both complexes are required in certain
developmental situations, the Rorth lab found that both Spg and Mbc are required
in border cell migration [49]. Removal of both Spg and Mbc function in the border
cells phenocopies loss of ELMO, suggesting that these 2 genes function in
concert with ELMO to guide migration. Further experiments are required to
determine if the observed CNS defects in spg and
mbc mutants are autonomous in the nervous system.
Alternatively, axonal patterning defects observed in mbc
mutants may be a secondary consequence due to a requirement for Mbc in the
musculature.In the musculature, the only known GEF shown to be required for Rac activation is
the Mbc-ELMO complex. However, in the developing nervous system, in addition to
the unconventional DOCK-ELMO complexes, the conventional GEFs Trio and Sos are
required [9],
[58],
[59],
[60], [61]. It is not
clear how these multiple GEFs are regulated throughout CNS development. Possible
mechanisms include the: (1) regulation of GEF expression either in subsets of
specific neurons or precise subcellular localization within the same neuron; (2)
unique physical associations between GEFs and receptors specific for distinct
steps in axonal patterning; and (3) regulation of GEF activity via
post-translational modifications including phosphorylation or ubiquitination.
While these ideas have not been examined in detail for all known GEFs, what is
known is discussed below.First, it is possible mechanisms exist within the cell or tissue to
compartmentalize GEF function as the spatial expression patterns of all GEFs in
the developing ventral nerve cord seems to be fairly broad. Mbc is expressed at
low or undetectable levels with reagents currently available, while Spg is
expressed in all commissural and longitudinal axons, but not glial cells.
Likewise, Sos protein is broadly expressed in many cell types around stage 12
and becomes enriched in CNS axons [9]. While Trio is expressed in axons that run on
longitudinal tracts and those that cross the midline, enrichment of this protein
is evident in the longitudinal fascicles [58]. Trio is largely localized
near the membrane [62], while cytoplasmic Spg and Sos can be recruited to
the membrane by their association with N-cadherin and Robo, respectively [9]. It is not yet
clear if membrane recruitment is sufficient to promote Rac activation, or if
conserved mechanisms exist to activate GEFs where their activity may be needed.
For example, by binding to RhoG, ELMO can target DOCK180 to the membrane [17]. In
addition, ELMO binding to DOCK180 relieves a steric inhibition by exposing the
DHR-2 domain of DOCK180 that binds Rac [16]. This remains to be shown for
other DOCK family members.Next, it is possible that each distinct step of neuronal pathfinding requires a
unique set of proteins that allow upstream receptors to signal to downstream
proteins for a specific biological output. For example, Trio cooperates with the
Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) to promote Rac-dependent actin cytoskeletal
dynamics in Frazzled-mediated commissure formation [8]. In the separate
process of longitudinal fascicle formation, a trimeric complex of Robo-DOCK-Sos
activates Rac to promote axon repulsion [9]. Separately, N-cadherin is
suggested to be required for fasciculation and directional growth cone migration
[54]. Thus,
the Ncad-DOCK-ELMO complex may be responsible for this latter aspect of axonal
pathfinding, while other steps may be mediated by individual receptor-GEF
complexes. However, additional evidence suggests this regulation may be more
complex. Preliminary data from our laboratory demonstrates that Ncad may
genetically interact with other Rac GEFs to affect earlier CNS development
Ncad mutants cannot be rescued by expression of RacWT alone
in the CNS (Biersmith, B. and Geisbrecht, E.; unpublished data). DOCK180 binds
the vertebrate receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) (similar to the
Netrin receptor Fra in flies) [63]. In addition, inhibition of DOCK180 activity
decreased the activation of Rac1 by Netrin [37]. Another study suggests that
Robo is required for multiple, parallel pathways in axon guidance and activated
Robo function inactivates N-cadherin-mediated adhesion [63]. Current models suggest
activated Robo binds to Abl and N-cadherin, thus providing a mechanism to weaken
adhesive interactions during fasciculation to allow for mediolateral positioning
of axons along the ventral nerve cord. The association of either Mbc or Spg
proteins in the Netrin signaling pathway has not been examined. So far, we have
not observed significant differences in genetic combinations that remove either
robo or slit in elmo
mutants (Lui, Z. and Geisbrecht, E.; unpublished data). Furthermore, no
significant increases in midline guidance errors were observed in
Ncad, elmo mutants, suggesting that Ncad
and Spg may function in this process independent of ELMO function. It is clear
that additional analysis of Robo and N-Cadherin dynamics are needed in the
well-established CNS fly model to determine their in vivo
relevance.Finally, the physical interactions of GEF proteins with specific membrane
receptors may allow the GEFs to be in a unique subcellular localization for
post-translational modifications that regulate activity. As mentioned above,
DOCK180 is capable of binding and activating Rac when sterically relieved upon
ELMO binding [16].
In addition, the presence of ELMO1 inhibits the ubiquitination of DOCK180, thus
stabilizing the amount of GEF available to activate Rac [64]. Finally, although the
significance is unclear, DOCK180 is phosphorylated upon Integrin binding to the
extracellular matrix [65]. Trio has also been shown to be tyrosine
phosphorylated upon co-expression with Abl [8], suggesting this may be
a common mechanism for GEF regulation. ELMO is also phosphorylated on tyrosine
residues [66], providing another level of GEF regulation. Further
experimentation must be done to determine whether these modifications of GEFs
also lead to regulation of Rac activity.

Recent investigations of vertebrate DOCK family proteins demonstrate that DOCK-ELMO
complexes function together to regulate downstream GTPases, namely Rac. In this
study, we uncover the Drosophila DOCK family member Spg, and find
that mutations in elmo, spg, or
mbc exhibit abnormal axonal patterning in the embryonic CNS.
Ncad is capable of relocating cytosolic Spg to the membrane in S2 cells.
Furthermore, we found that mutations in Ncad dominantly enhance the
axonal outgrowth phenotypes of spg mutants and that
Ncad; spg and Ncad,
elmo double mutants have more severe CNS phenotypes. Taken
together, these data indicate (1) that Ncad, Spg, and Elmo may function together
during axonal outgrowth, (2) that the severe double mutant phenotypes reflect a
decrease in the function of maternally loaded components that were masked in single
mutants, and/or (3) the double mutant defects represent a disruption of multiple
signaling pathways.

Identification and characterization of Spg, a DOCK family memberWe identified peptides corresponding to the uncharacterized protein CG31048 in an
in vivo mass spectrometry approach to identify ELMO-binding
partners. The CG31048 locus, which encodes for Sponge, is a
member of the growing family of Drosophila DOCK family
proteins. This report is the second identification of a DOCK family member in
flies since the role of Mbc was uncovered in 1997 [26]. The 11 vertebrate DOCK
proteins identified thus far can be divided into subgroups based upon primary
sequence analysis and GTPase target specificity for either Rac or Cdc42 [5], [10], [50]. In the
first group, the DOCK-A family consists of DOCK180, DOCK2, and DOCK 5, while the
DOCK-B subfamily is comprised of DOCK3 and DOCK4. In flies, this redundancy is
simplified with the 2 DOCK family members, Mbc and Spg, whom are members of the
DOCK-A and DOCK-B groups, respectively. All of the above family members contain
an N-terminal SH3 domain, 2 internal DHR (CZH) domains and a variable C-terminal
proline-rich region. Furthermore, they function as unconventional guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the GTPase Rac. Members of the DOCK-C
(DOCK 6, DOCK7, DOCK8) subfamily and DOCK-D (DOCK9, DOCK10, DOCK11) subfamily
bind to the GTPase Cdc42. The 2 orthologous Drosophila proteins, CG42533/Dm ziz
(DOCK-C) and CG11376/Dm zir (DOCK-D) have not yet been characterized in
flies.Alleles of spg were originally identified in a maternal effect
screen and later characterized for their role in actin-dependent events in early
Drosophila embryogenesis [47], [48]. Our mRNA and protein
expression analysis suggested Spg may be required after cellularization due to
strong expression in the visceral mesoderm, dorsal vessel, and developing
ventral nerve cord. As removal of the maternal contribution of
spg null alleles results in early embryonic lethality, the
role for spg in later developmental processes had not been
examined. However, the identification of Spg as an ELMO-interacting protein gave
us insight into how to examine the role of Spg in late embryogenesis using
double mutant analysis. While zygotic single mutants of spg and
elmo appeared essentially wild-type, removal of both the
zygotic contribution of both spg and elmo
resulted in axonal patterning defects. We favor the hypothesis that the maternal
contribution of both Elmo and Spg mask any embryonic phenotypes until the levels
of both proteins are compromised. Alternatively, though not mutually exclusive,
is the possibility that Elmo and Spg function in parallel pathways and our
observed phenotypes are a result of these additive effects. As mentioned above,
removal of either spg or elmo maternal
contribution results in early embryonic lethality [27]. As
spg has shown to be required for early actin cap and
metaphase furrow formation, it is fair to hypothesize that that these two genes
may function in concert in early embryo development, where Mbc is not
required.

We identified peptides corresponding to the uncharacterized protein CG31048 in an

bind to the GTPase Cdc42. The 2 orthologous Drosophila proteins, CG42533/Dm ziz
(DOCK-C) and CG11376/Dm zir (DOCK-D) have not yet been characterized in

Downstream GTPase of the DOCK-ELMO complexesVertebrate DOCK 4 was originally identified as a CDM family member capable of
activating the small GTPase Rap1 in GTPase pull-down assays [56].
Functionally, a deletion of endogenous DOCK4 in osteosarcoma cells was shown to
rescue the formation of adherens junctions and could be suppressed by
co-expression of dominant-negative Rap1 [56]. Recent studies have
demonstrated that DOCK 4 is also capable of activating the GTPase Rac1 [45], [51], [57]. This data
suggests that GTPase activation of either Rac and/or Rap1 by the Spg-ELMO
complex is context and/or tissue-dependent. Our current model for DOCK-ELMO
function in embryogenesis is shown in Figure 8. Only the Mbc-ELMO complex functions
in the developing musculature to activate the GTPase Rac. While it is clear that
regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is downstream of the Mbc-ELMO→Rac
signaling pathway, the upstream receptors that mediate this signaling are
unknown. Our data suggests that both Mbc and Spg function in the
Drosophila developing nervous system. All literature thus
far supports a model whereby the Mbc-ELMO complex activates Rac. Alternatively,
the Spg-ELMO complex may regulate Rac and/or Rap1 activity. If both the Mbc-ELMO
and Spg-ELMO protein complexes function upstream of Rac, they may be acting
redundantly to regulate Rac-dependent actin cytoskeletal changes. Alternatively,
the downstream effector functions of Rac activity may lead to changes in
cell-cell adhesion or may be mediated through the GTPase Rap1. We hypothesize
that differences in the C-terminal proline-rich regions of Mbc and Spg may be
responsible for their differential activities. In myoblast fusion, the
proline-rich region of Mbc is not required [11]. However, Spg and
vertebrate DOCK3/4 contain additional proline-rich sites not present in
Mbc/DOCK180. Further experiments will be necessary to define the cellular and
molecular mechanisms necessary to carry out DOCK-ELMO functions in the
developing CNS.10.1371/journal.pone.0016120.g008Figure 8Model of CDM-Elmo pathway.In the muscle, Mbc is the sole CDM family member that functions with Elmo
to mediate cytoskeletal modifications through the GTPase Rac (left
panel). In a neuronal cell (right panel), both Mbc and Spg contribute to
nervous system formation. In this model, the Mbc-Elmo complex is
downstream of yet unidentified proteins and presumably signals through
Rac. In contrast, our data suggests Spg-Elmo may function downstream of
Ncad. The target of the Spg-Elmo complex, whether it be Rac and/or Rap
is unclear.

nervous system formation. In this model, the Mbc-Elmo complex is

Regulation of GEF activityELMO expression is ubiquitous throughout fly development, while Mbc and Spg
expression is predominant in the muscle and nervous system, respectively. Based
upon the tissue-specific expression patterns of Mbc and Spg, we originally
hypothesized that complementary expression patterns may be one mechanism for the
tissue-specific regulation of Rac activation through the DOCK-ELMO complexes.
However, our results indicate that the role of Mbc-ELMO and Spg-ELMO is more
complicated. While the Mbc-ELMO complex seems to be the primary GEF complex for
Rac activation in the musculature, both the Mbc-ELMO and Spg-ELMO complexes may
both be necessary to correctly pattern axons in the developing central nervous
system. In support of the idea that both complexes are required in certain
developmental situations, the Rorth lab found that both Spg and Mbc are required
in border cell migration [49]. Removal of both Spg and Mbc function in the border
cells phenocopies loss of ELMO, suggesting that these 2 genes function in
concert with ELMO to guide migration. Further experiments are required to
determine if the observed CNS defects in spg and
mbc mutants are autonomous in the nervous system.
Alternatively, axonal patterning defects observed in mbc
mutants may be a secondary consequence due to a requirement for Mbc in the
musculature.In the musculature, the only known GEF shown to be required for Rac activation is
the Mbc-ELMO complex. However, in the developing nervous system, in addition to
the unconventional DOCK-ELMO complexes, the conventional GEFs Trio and Sos are
required [9],
[58],
[59],
[60], [61]. It is not
clear how these multiple GEFs are regulated throughout CNS development. Possible
mechanisms include the: (1) regulation of GEF expression either in subsets of
specific neurons or precise subcellular localization within the same neuron; (2)
unique physical associations between GEFs and receptors specific for distinct
steps in axonal patterning; and (3) regulation of GEF activity via
post-translational modifications including phosphorylation or ubiquitination.
While these ideas have not been examined in detail for all known GEFs, what is
known is discussed below.First, it is possible mechanisms exist within the cell or tissue to
compartmentalize GEF function as the spatial expression patterns of all GEFs in

the vertebrate receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) (similar to the
Netrin receptor Fra in flies) [63]. In addition, inhibition of DOCK180 activity
decreased the activation of Rac1 by Netrin [37]. Another study suggests that
Robo is required for multiple, parallel pathways in axon guidance and activated
Robo function inactivates N-cadherin-mediated adhesion [63]. Current models suggest
activated Robo binds to Abl and N-cadherin, thus providing a mechanism to weaken
adhesive interactions during fasciculation to allow for mediolateral positioning
of axons along the ventral nerve cord. The association of either Mbc or Spg
proteins in the Netrin signaling pathway has not been examined. So far, we have
not observed significant differences in genetic combinations that remove either
robo or slit in elmo
mutants (Lui, Z. and Geisbrecht, E.; unpublished data). Furthermore, no
significant increases in midline guidance errors were observed in
Ncad, elmo mutants, suggesting that Ncad
and Spg may function in this process independent of ELMO function. It is clear
that additional analysis of Robo and N-Cadherin dynamics are needed in the
well-established CNS fly model to determine their in vivo
relevance.Finally, the physical interactions of GEF proteins with specific membrane

signal for immunofluorescent stainings (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA).Mass spectrometry identification and immunoprecipiationsMass spectrometry experiments were described previously [27]. For
immunoprecipitations, ELMO-HA-tagged and untagged transgenic flies were crossed
to mef2-GAL4 females and 6–18h embryos were collected on
agar-apple juice plates at 25°C. Embryos were dechorionated and homogenized
in lysis buffer [60mM Tris (pH 7.5), 80mM NaCl, 6mM EDTA (pH 8.0),
2% Triton X-100, 1mM Na3VO4, 5mM 1-Naphthyl
phosphate potassium salt, 2mM PMSF, 2 ug/ml Leupeptin, 2 ug/ml Pepstatin].
The NaCl concentration was increased to 300mM and resulting lysate mixed with
anti-HA resin overnight at 4°C. The resin was washed 3 times with wash
buffer plus protease inhibitors, boiled in 6× sample buffer and submitted
to SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. The following primary antibodies
were used for immunoblotting: anti-Spg (1∶1000, this paper), anti-ELMO
(1∶1000) and anti-HA-HRP (1∶2000, Roche). After incubation with goat
anti-guinea pig-HRP (Jackson), proteins were visualized with ECL Plus
(Amersham).Constructs and Spg antibody productionA full length spg cDNA sequence was generated by analyzing
multiple, overlapping fragments generated by RT-PCR using S2 cells and 0–6
h embryos as a reference source. A full length cDNA was generated by Epoch
Biolabs and cloned into pUAST. Transgenic flies were produced by Genetic
Services, Inc. using standard techniques. By standard RT-PCR techniques,
gene-specific primers were used to amplify the region of spg
corresponding to AA 1669–2023. The forward and reverse primers were
engineered to contain SalI and NotI restriction sites, respectively. This cDNA
fragment was cloned into the pT7MHT expression vector and soluble protein was
purified as described [67]. This soluble protein was sent to Pocono Rabbit Farm
and Laboratory Inc. for injection into guinea pigs. The resulting antisera was
used at 1∶500.S2 cell transfectionsTransient calcium phosphate transfections of pRmHA3_N-cadherin were carried out
with 1.2×106 cells/ml and 7–15 ug DNA as needed. Cells
were induced 24 hours after transfection with 0.7 µM CuSO4.
After 48 hrs, cells were resuspended at a concentration of
1.2×106 cells/ml in 2 mls of BBS buffer (10mM HEPES, 55 mM
NaCl, 40mM KCl, 15 mM MgSO4, 20 mM glucose, 50 mM sucrose, and 10 mM
CaCl2). The cells were agitated in a 35 mm dish at 100 rpm for 1
hr. The cells were plated on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips and fixed for 10
minutes in 4% PFA in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free
(CMF) C & GBS (55 mM NaCl, 40 mM KCl, 10 mM Tricine
(pH = 6.9), 20 mM glucose, 50 mM sucrose)+1 mM
CaCl2. Standard immunofluorescent protocols were followed using
rat anti-Ncad (1∶20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of
Iowa) and gp anti-Spg (1∶500). Secondary antibodies used were Fluor 488
goat anti-rat IgG and Fluor 546 goat anti-guinea pig at 1∶400 (Molecular
Probes, Carlsbad, CA).

Materials and Methods

elmoPB.mat mutants were created as
previously described (Geisbrecht, et al, 2008). The following stocks were
generated by standard meiotic recombination and isolated on the basis of their
failure to complement other alleles and/or sequencing to verify the molecular
lesion: NcadΔ14;
