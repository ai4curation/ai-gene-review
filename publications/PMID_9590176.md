Synaptic vesicles can be coated in vitro in a reaction that is ARF-, ATP-, and 
temperature-dependent and requires synaptic vesicle membrane proteins. The coat 
is largely made up of the heterotetrameric complex, adaptor protein 3, recently 
implicated in Golgi-to-vacuole traffic in yeast. Depletion of AP3 from brain 
cytosol inhibits small vesicle formation from PC12 endosomes in vitro. Budding 
from washed membranes can be reconstituted with purified AP3 and recombinant 
ARF1. We conclude that AP3 coating is involved in at least one pathway of small 
vesicle formation from endosomes.
