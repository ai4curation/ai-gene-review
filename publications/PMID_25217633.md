STAT3 is a pleiotropic transcription factor that is activated by the 
phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 in response to many cytokines and growth 
factors. STAT3 without Tyr-705 phosphorylation (U-STAT3) is also a potent 
transcription factor, and its concentration in cells increases greatly in 
response to STAT3 activation because the STAT3 gene can be driven by 
phosphorylated STAT3 dimers. We have now searched for post-translational 
modifications of U-STAT3 that might have a critical role in its function. An 
analysis by mass spectroscopy indicated that U-STAT3 is acetylated on Lys-685, 
and the integrity of Lys-685 is required for the expression of most 
U-STAT3-dependent genes. In contrast, we found only a very minor role for 
Lys-685 in gene expression induced in response to tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. 
U-STAT3 plays an important role in angiotensin II-induced gene expression and in 
the consequent development of cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. Mutation of 
Lys-685 inhibits this function of STAT3, providing new information on the role 
of U-STAT3 in augmenting the development of heart failure.
