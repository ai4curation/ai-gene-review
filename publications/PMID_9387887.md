Studies in rodents suggest the presence of a dopaminergic system that influences 
the function of a biological clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei 
(SCN). To provide insights into mechanisms of dopamine action in the SCN, we 
studied transgenic mice that had either one allele (+¿-) or both alleles (-/-) 
of the D1 dopamine receptor gene deleted, along with normal (+/+) littermates. 
As expected, receptor labelling autoradiography studies using [125I]SCH 23982 
showed a complete absence of D1 dopamine receptor binding sites in the SCN of 
-/- animals. When pregnant mice from +¿- x +¿- matings were injected with the D1 
receptor agonist SKF 38393, or the dopamine reuptake blocker GBR 12909 at day 19 
of gestation, c-fos mRNA expression was observed in the SCN of +/+ fetuses. In 
contrast, c-fos mRNA induction was not seen in -/- or +¿- litter mates. 
Injection of cocaine into pregnant dams also resulted in robust SCN c-fos mRNA 
expression in +/+ mice. Increases in SCN c-fos mRNA expression were also seen in 
+¿- and -/- mice suggesting that cocaine action in the SCN involves both D1 
receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Collectively, our studies of 
transgenic mice deficient in D1 receptors support the presence of a functional 
dopaminergic system in the fetal SCN. We also identify D1 receptors as the 
prominent transducer of dopamine action in the fetal SCN.
