ATF5 transcription factor plays an essential role in hematopoietic and glioma 
cell survival and neuronal cell differentiation. Here, we report for the first 
time the pro-apoptosis role of ATF5 and identify Cyclin D3 as an ATF5-targeted 
apoptosis-related gene. The ectopic expression of ATF5 in HeLa cells could 
markedly increase cisplatin-induced apoptosis and the cleavage of Caspase-3, and 
induce Cyclin D3 mRNA expression via cooperation with E2F1 transcription factor. 
Moreover, the interference of Cyclin D3 expression by transfection with Cyclin 
D3 RNAi could protect cells from ATF5-mediated apoptosis induced by cisplatin, 
indicating the contribution of Cyclin D3 in ATF5-mediated apoptosis. Taken 
together, these results suggest that ATF5 increases cisplatin-induced apoptosis 
through up-regulation of Cyclin D3 transcription, which elicits survival signals 
in HeLa cells.
