OBJECTIVE: Although a novel IFN-zeta/limitin uses IFN-alpha/beta receptor, it 
lacks some common activities of type I IFNs. We compared effects on 
megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation as well as signals for their 
biological activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recombinant IFN-zeta/limitin and IFN-alpha titrated with 
a cytopathic effect dye binding assay, were used in this study. Colony assays 
and serum-free suspension cultures for megakaryocytes were performed to compare 
their growth inhibitory effects. To analyze signals, megakaryocytes cultured in 
serum-free suspension cultures were stimulated and Western blotted with the 
indicated antibody.
RESULTS: Both IFN-zeta/limitin and IFN-alpha suppressed the proliferation of 
megakaryocyte progenitors without influencing their differentiation. However, 
much higher concentrations of IFN-zeta/limitin were required for the growth 
inhibition than IFN-alpha. The growth inhibition by IFN-zeta/limitin and 
IFN-alpha was significantly reduced when either Tyk2 or STAT1 was disrupted. In 
addition, the antisense oligonucleotides against Crk and Daxx, downstream 
molecules of Tyk2, greatly rescued the IFN-zeta/limitin- and IFN-alpha-induced 
reduction of megakaryocyte colony numbers. In cultured megakaryocytes, 
IFN-zeta/limitin induced the expression of SOCS-1 as strongly as IFN-alpha. 
However, IFN-zeta/limitin induced weaker phosphorylation of Crk and lower 
induction of Daxx than IFN-alpha.
CONCLUSIONS: Weaker signals for Crk and Daxx may participate in less 
megakaryocyte suppressive activity of IFN-zeta/limitin and may distinguish 
IFN-zeta/limitin from IFN-alpha in megakaryocytes. Our results extend the 
understanding about thrombocytopenia in patients with IFN-alpha treatment as 
well as the possibility for the clinical application of human homologue of 
IFN-zeta/limitin or an engineered cytokine with useful features of the 
IFN-zeta/limitin structure.
