We have cloned and expressed in vaccinia virus a cDNA encoding an ubiquitous 
501-amino-acid (aa) phosphoprotein that corresponds to protein IEF SSP 9502 
(79,400 Da, pI 4.5) in the master 2-D-gel keratinocyte protein database [Celis 
et al., Electrophoresis 14 (1993) 1091-1198]. The deduced aa sequence contains 9 
Trp residues, some of which are localized in repeats and that characterise the 
protein as a member of the WD-40 family, a group of proteins having 40-aa 
repeats containing Trp and Asp [Duronio et al., Proteins 13 (1992) 41-56; Van 
der Voorn and Ploegh, FEBS Lett. 307 (1992) 131-134]. The protein contains a 
nuclear targeting signal (KKKGK), and fractionation of transformed human amnion 
cells (AMA) in karyoplasts and cytoplasts confirmed that it is predominantly 
localized in the nucleus. Database searching indicated that IEF SSP 9502 is a 
putative human homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae periodic Trp protein, 
PWP1, a polypeptide that may play a regulatory role in cell growth and/or 
transcription.
