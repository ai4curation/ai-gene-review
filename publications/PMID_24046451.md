Establishment and maintenance of stable muscle attachments is essential for 
coordinated body movement. Studies in Drosophila have pioneered a molecular 
understanding of the morphological events in the conserved process of muscle 
attachment formation, including myofiber migration, muscle-tendon signaling, and 
stable junctional adhesion between muscle cells and their corresponding target 
insertion sites. In both Drosophila and vertebrate models, integrin complexes 
play a key role in the biogenesis and stability of muscle attachments through 
the interactions of integrins with extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands. We show 
that Drosophila importin-7 (Dim7) is an upstream regulator of the conserved 
Elmo-Mbc→Rac signaling pathway in the formation of embryonic muscle attachment 
sites (MASs). Dim7 is encoded by the moleskin (msk) locus and was identified as 
an Elmo-interacting protein. Both Dim7 and Elmo localize to the ends of 
myofibers coincident with the timing of muscle-tendon attachment in late 
myogenesis. Phenotypic analysis of elmo mutants reveal muscle attachment defects 
similar to those previously described for integrin mutants. Furthermore, Elmo 
and Dim7 interact both biochemically and genetically in the developing 
musculature. The muscle detachment phenotype resulting from mutations in the msk 
locus can be rescued by components in the Elmo signaling pathway, including the 
Elmo-Mbc complex, an activated Elmo variant, or a constitutively active form of 
Rac. In larval muscles, the localization of Dim7 and activated Elmo to the sites 
of muscle attachment is attenuated upon RNAi knockdown of integrin heterodimer 
complex components. Our results show that integrins function as upstream signals 
to mediate Dim7-Elmo enrichment to the MASs.
