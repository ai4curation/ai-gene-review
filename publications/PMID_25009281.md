p120-catenin (p120) modulates adherens junction (AJ) dynamics by controlling the 
stability of classical cadherins. Among all p120 isoforms, p120-3A and p120-1A 
are the most prevalent. Both stabilize cadherins, but p120-3A is preferred in 
epithelia, whereas p120-1A takes precedence in neurons, fibroblasts, and 
macrophages. During epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, E- to N-cadherin 
switching coincides with p120-3A to -1A alternative splicing. These isoforms 
differ by a 101-amino acid "head domain" comprising the p120-1A N-terminus. 
Although its exact role is unknown, the head domain likely mediates 
developmental and cancer-associated events linked to p120-1A expression (e.g., 
motility, invasion, metastasis). Here we identified delta-interacting protein A 
(DIPA) as the first head domain-specific binding partner and candidate mediator 
of isoform 1A activity. DIPA colocalizes with AJs in a p120-1A- but not 
3A-dependent manner. Moreover, all DIPA family members (Ccdc85a, Ccdc85b/DIPA, 
and Ccdc85c) interact reciprocally with p120 family members (p120, δ-catenin, 
p0071, and ARVCF), suggesting significant functional overlap. During zebrafish 
neural tube development, both knockdown and overexpression of DIPA phenocopy 
N-cadherin mutations, an effect bearing functional ties to a reported mouse 
hydrocephalus phenotype associated with Ccdc85c. These studies identify a novel, 
highly conserved interaction between two protein families that may participate 
either individually or collectively in N-cadherin-mediated development.
