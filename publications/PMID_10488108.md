The constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) protein of Arabidopsis functions as a 
molecular switch for the seedling developmental fates: photomorphogenesis under 
light conditions and skotomorphogenesis in darkness. The COP1 protein contains a 
cysteine-rich zinc-binding RING finger motif found in diverse groups of 
regulatory proteins. To understand the role of the COP1 RING finger in mediating 
protein-protein interaction, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and 
isolated a novel protein with a RING-H2 motif, a variant type of the RING 
finger. This protein, designated COP1 Interacting Protein 8 (CIP8), is encoded 
by a single copy gene and localized to cytosol in a transient assay. In addition 
to the RING-H2 motif, the predicted protein has a C4 zinc finger, an acidic 
region, a glycine-rich cluster, and a serine-rich cluster. The COP1 RING finger 
and the CIP8 RING-H2 domains are sufficient for their interaction with each 
other both in vitro and in yeast, whereas neither motif displayed significant 
self-association. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that 
the expected zinc-binding ligands of the RING finger and RING-H2 fingers are 
essential for their interaction. Our findings indicate that the RING finger 
motif, in this case, serves as autonomous protein-protein interaction domain. 
The allele specific effect of cop1 mutations on the CIP8 protein accumulation in 
seedlings indicates that its stability in vivo is dependent on the COP1 protein.
