Overexpression of the oncoprotein mortalin in cancer cells and its protein 
partners enables mortalin to promote multiple oncogenic signaling pathways and 
effectively antagonize chemotherapy-induced cell death. A UBX-domain-containing 
protein, UBXN2A, acts as a potential mortalin inhibitor. This current study 
determines whether UBXN2A effectively binds to and occupies mortalin's binding 
pocket, resulting in a direct improvement in the tumor's sensitivity to 
chemotherapy. Molecular modeling of human mortalin's binding pocket and its 
binding to the SEP domain of UBXN2A followed by yeast two-hybrid and His-tag 
pull-down assays revealed that three amino acids (PRO442, ILE558, and LYS555) 
within the substrate-binding domain of mortalin are crucial for UBXN2A binding 
to mortalin. As revealed by chase experiments in the presence of cycloheximide, 
overexpression of UBXN2A seems to interfere with the mortalin-CHIP E3 ubiquitin 
ligase and consequently suppresses the C-terminus of the HSC70-interacting 
protein (CHIP)-mediated destabilization of p53, resulting in its stabilization 
in the cytoplasm and upregulation in the nucleus. Overexpression of UBXN2A 
causes a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and the migration of colon 
cancer cells. We silenced UBXN2A in the human osteosarcoma U2OS cell line, an 
enriched mortalin cancer cell, followed by a clinical dosage of the 
chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The UBXN2A knockout U2OS cells 
revealed that UBXNA is essential for the cytotoxic effect achieved by 5-FU. 
UBXN2A overexpression markedly increased the apoptotic response of U2OS cells to 
the 5-FU. In addition, silencing of UBXN2A protein suppresses apoptosis enhanced 
by UBXN2A overexpression in U2OS. The knowledge gained from this study provides 
insights into the mechanistic role of UBXN2A as a potent mortalin inhibitor and 
as a potential chemotherapy sensitizer for clinical application.

A UBX-domain-containing protein, UBXN2A, acts as a potential mortalin inhibitor. This current study determines whether UBXN2A effectively binds to and occupies mortalin’s binding pocket, resulting in a direct improvement in the tumor’s sensitivity to chemotherapy.

As revealed by chase experiments in the presence of cycloheximide, overexpression of UBXN2A seems to interfere with the mortalin-CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase and consequently suppresses the C‐terminus of the HSC70‐interacting protein (CHIP)-mediated destabilization of p53, resulting in its stabilization in the cytoplasm and upregulation in the nucleus. Overexpression of UBXN2A causes a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and the migration of colon cancer cells. We silenced UBXN2A in the human osteosarcoma U2OS cell line, an enriched mortalin cancer cell, followed by a clinical dosage of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The UBXN2A knockout U2OS cells revealed that UBXNA is essential for the cytotoxic effect achieved by 5-FU. UBXN2A overexpression markedly increased the apoptotic response of U2OS cells to the 5-FU. In addition, silencing of UBXN2A protein suppresses apoptosis enhanced by UBXN2A overexpression in U2OS. The knowledge gained from this study provides insights into the mechanistic role of UBXN2A as a potent mortalin inhibitor and as a potential chemotherapy sensitizer for clinical application.

Introduction

Mortalin-2/Grp75/HSPA9B/mot-2 (mortalin) is a member of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family (Wadhwa et al. 1993b ). Mortalin does not quite fit with other members of the HSP70 family due to its non-inducibility to heat shocks (Kaul et al. 2007 ). Besides inactivation of p53 during the progression of cancer (Lu et al. 2011 ; Sane et al. 2014 ). mortalin enhances cancer proliferation and metastasis through other pathways as follows: (i) Mortalin negatively regulates the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which triggers innate tumor-suppressive mechanisms. In fact, inhibition of mortalin increases p21 CIP1 transcription and MEK/ERK activity, which leads to cell death and growth arrest in MEK/ERK-activated cancer cell lines (Wu et al. 2013 ). (ii) Mortalin inhibits the pro-apoptotic Bax protein in both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners (Lu et al. 2011 ; Yang et al. 2011 ). (iii) In addition to its cytoplasmic sequestration and inactivation of p53, a recent report indicated that in cancer cells mortalin localizes in the nucleus and inactivates p53-mediated control of centrosome duplication, causing genomic instability. In addition, mortalin nuclear localization leads to the activation of hTERT (a telomere-maintaining enzyme) and hnRNP-K (a multifunctional chromatin-remodeling protein). The hTERT and hnRNP-K promote carcinogenesis (Ryu et al. 2014 ). (iv) Current evidence indicates mortalin contributes to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a crucial step in tumor invasion and metastasis (Chen et al. 2014 ). as well as angiogenesis (Yoo et al. 2010 ) during the progression of a tumor. (v) Finally, there is evidence that mortalin associates with DJ-1 protein and they coordinately maintain cancer stem cells through the control of oxidative stress (Conte et al. 2009 ; Tai-Nagara et al. 2014 ). Taken together, the above evidence illustrates that mortalin plays an important and distinct role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in several cancers, including colon, brain, and osteosarcoma cancers (Kaul et al. 2007 ; Wadhwa et al. 2006 ). Therefore, mortalin is a potential therapeutic target for a subset of cancers possessing upregulated mortalin.

We discovered UBXN2A binds to and inactivates mortalin. By binding to mortalin, UBXN2A reactivates wild-type (WT)-p53 tumor suppressor protein (Sane et al. 2014 ) and induces apoptosis at the cellular level and in tumor xenografts (Abdullah et al. 2015b ). In addition, we discovered that induction of UBXN2A by its enhancer (Abdullah et al. 2015a ). Veratridine, can synergistically enhance the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), particularly in well-differentiated colon cancer cells.

In this current study, we first employed a combination of computational structural approaches and protein-protein docking studies followed by genetic and biochemical approaches to further determine the molecular mechanism of UBXN2A-mortalin interaction. These experiments revealed that the SEP ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Drosophila melanogaster eyes closed gene, and vertebrate 47) domain (Soukenik et al. 2004 ) of UBXN2A binds partially to mortalin’s binding pocket located within the SBD (substrate-binding domain), and three amino acids (PRO442, ILE558, and LYS555) could be essential for this interaction. A series of cell-based assays verified UBXN2A expression, and its consequent binding to mortalin can reverse cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and migration promoted by the cytoplasmic mortalin in the colon and U2OS cancer cell lines. Gain- and loss-of-UBXN2A experiments showed UBXN2A positively mediates apoptosis events in cancer cells, and its presence is essential for the induced cytotoxic effect of 5-FU.

Discussion

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone cancer in children and adolescents. Particularly, osteosarcoma is aggressive in children despite surgery and chemotherapy and is prone to relapse (Marina et al. 2004 ). A recent improvement in chemotherapeutic regimens has increased the long-term survival rate (Kim et al. 2010 ; Tang et al. 2011 ). However, these patients still have a poor response to chemotherapy, which is usually associated with a poor prognosis (Basu-Roy et al. 2013 ). Therefore, there is an emerging demand for novel therapeutic approaches for patients with osteosarcoma (Hattinger et al. 2010 ; Kim and Helman 2009 ). This current study introduces the identification of a novel anti-cancer pathway that can improve the responses of tumorigenic cells to classic chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma.

A set of molecular modeling and protein-protein docking studies clearly demonstrate that mortalin’s binding pocket, located in the SBD domain of the protein, is able to accommodate the SEP domain of UBXN2A. In addition, this computational study suggested the essential presence of PRO442, LYS555, and ILE558 within mortalin’s binding pocket and their relation with the SEP domain of UBXN2A protein. While further studies such as a protein crystallization technique are necessary to determine UBXN2A-mortalin protein complexes at atomic resolution, this simulation reveals a dynamic and stable binding pocket within the SBD domain of mortalin in which the SEP domain of UBXN2A can bind. We believe the initial binding of the SEP domain leads to the formation of further affinity- and specificity-increasing interactions between the additional domain of UBXN2A and mortalin’s binding pocket. More importantly, this current structure study suggests a section of the p53 binding site on mortalin protein structurally is the matching pocket for the SEP domain of UBXN2A.

It has been shown that mutation in specific residues within the binding pocket of HSP70 protein can disable HSP70 from binding to a selective substrate (Rohrer et al. 2014 ). Completion of Y2H and IP experiments confirmed PRO442, LYS555, and ILE558 are essential residues in the mortalin pocket when the SEP domain binds to the SBD domain of mortalin. In previous Y2H experiments (Sane et al. 2014 ). truncated forms of mortalin suggested a section of the SBD domain between 438 and 506 residues is essential for UBXN2A binding. However, in those truncated forms, we kept ATP at the N-terminus of truncated SBD. In this current study, we eliminated the ATP domain to better understand how SBD’s pocket meditates UBXN2A-mortalin interactions.

It has been previously reported that the N-terminal of mortalin (253–282) is important for p53 binding (Kaul et al. 2001 ; Wadhwa et al. 2000 ). However, another set of studies showed p53 binds to the substrate-binding site located at the C-terminus of mortalin (Iosefson and Azem 2010 ; Utomo et al. 2012 ). The differences between the above results are certainly explained by possible modification or additional interacting partners observed in the in vitro and in vivo systems utilized in the above reports.

Our structural studies (Fig. 1 ) as well as the Y2H and pull-down experiments (Figs. 2 and 3 ) presented in this current study combined with our previous results (Sane et al. 2014 ) suggest both the N-terminus and C-terminus of mortalin contribute to UBXN2A interaction, similar to p53 and MKT-077 binding to mortalin (Grover et al. 2012 ; Wadhwa et al. 2000 ). These current results suggest the following facts: (1) UBXN2A binds to mortalin’s substrate pocket located in the C-terminus, and this binding can be affected by the absence of PRO442, LYS555, and ILE558 amino acids as well as the presence of the N-terminus of mortalin (1–506 aa) (Sane et al. 2014 ). (2) Binding of UBXN2A to the substrate-binding pocket masks a part of the p53 binding site within the substrate-binding domain of mortalin (THR433, VAL435, LEU436, LEU437, PRO442, ILE558, LYS555) (Utomo et al. 2012 ). (3) UBXN2A’s binding to the substrate-binding pocket may lead to conformational changes (Sharma and Masison 2009 ; Zhuravleva and Gierasch 2015 ) in the N-terminus (ATPase domain) of mortalin, which is also critical for p53’s binding to mortalin (Kaul et al. 2001 ). (4) Other sections of mortalin domain such as the ATP and lid domains can be used as the second site of interaction with UBXN2A. Similar multi-interaction sites were described for UBXD1 protein when it binds to p97 protein platform (Kern et al. 2009 ). Together, the above results confirmed UBXN2A is a regulatory partner of mortalin and UBXN2A uses the SEP domain to fit and bind to the SBD conserved pocket.

This current study suggests UBXN2A binds to mortalin’s protein binding pocket and interferes with mortalin’s binding partners (Dundas et al. 2005 ; Gestl and Anne Bottger 2012 ; Guo et al. 2014 ; Sadekova et al. 1997 ) resulting in inactivation of mortalin oncoprotein in cancer cells. Part of the apoptotic resistance of cancer cells is mediated by activation of WT-mortalin in cancer cells, including osteosarcoma (Wadhwa et al. 2015 ). therefore, inhibition of this mortalin-induced survival response by UBXN2A may be an important adjunct to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy. Further studies are required to dissect the various mechanisms underlying UBXN2A anti-cancer functions upon its binding to mortalin and how UBXN2A-dependent inhibition of the mortalin oncoprotein pathway can alter the apoptotic efficacy of chemotherapy (Fig. 6g ). The tumor cells use several molecular mechanisms to suppress apoptosis and acquire resistance to classic chemotherapies. An increasing number of studies have clearly established that mortalin is a dominant oncoprotein in several solid tumors affecting both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins (Deocaris et al. 2013 ; Yoo et al. 2010 ). Completion of this study showed UBXN2A can bind and inhibit mortalin oncoprotein, resulting in induction of the apoptosis pathway in the presence of 5-FU. Therefore, UBXN2A can be targeted to stimulate apoptosis in solid tumors with high levels of mortalin.

In summary, the additive effect of a pro-apoptotic UBXN2A and the cytotoxic anti-cancer function of 5-FU could be an effective treatment strategy, particularly for those mortalin-enriched tumors such as osteosarcoma. Induced UBXN2A (Abdullah et al. 2015a ) can inhibit mortalin oncoprotein, which is required for the development of osteosarcoma tumors. This approach may improve the efficacy of classic chemotherapies and lead to better management of patient survivors.
