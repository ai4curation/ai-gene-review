SIRT1 is a NAD+ -dependent deacetylase that controls key metabolic and signaling 
pathways, including inactivating the p53 tumor suppressor. However, the 
mechanisms controlling SIRT1 enzymatic activity in the context of cancer are 
unclear. Here, we show that the previously undescribed CSAG2 protein is a direct 
activator of SIRT1. CSAG2 is normally restricted to expression in the male 
germline but is frequently re-activated in cancers. CSAG2 is necessary for 
cancer cell proliferation and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo. Biochemical 
studies revealed that CSAG2 directly binds to and stimulates SIRT1 activity 
toward multiple substrates. Importantly, CSAG2 enhances SIRT1-mediated 
deacetylation of p53, inhibits p53 transcriptional activity, and improves cell 
survival in response to genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, CSAG2 binds SIRT1 
catalytic domain and promotes activity independent of altering substrate 
affinity. Together, our results identify a previously undescribed mechanism for 
SIRT1 activation in cancer cells and highlight unanticipated approaches to 
therapeutically modulate SIRT1.
