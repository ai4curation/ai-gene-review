Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder with a 
gene-dosage effect that is usually caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene 
that disrupt normal clearance of LDL. In the homozygous form, it results in a 
distinctive clinical phenotype, characterized by inherited hypercholesterolemia, 
cholesterol deposition in tendons, and severe premature coronary disease. We 
described previously two families with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia 
that is not due to mutations in the LDL receptor gene but is characterized by 
defective LDL receptor-dependent internalization and degradation of LDL by 
transformed lymphocytes from the patients. We mapped the defective gene to 
chromosome 1p36 and now show that the disorder in these and a third English 
family is due to novel mutations in ARH1, a newly identified gene encoding an 
adaptor-like protein. Cultured skin fibroblasts from affected individuals 
exhibit normal LDL receptor activity, but their monocyte-derived macrophages are 
similar to transformed lymphocytes, being unable to internalize and degrade LDL. 
Retroviral expression of normal human ARH1 restores LDL receptor internalization 
in transformed lymphocytes from an affected individual, as demonstrated by 
uptake and degradation of (125)I-labeled LDL and confocal microscopy of cells 
labeled with anti-LDL-receptor Ab.
