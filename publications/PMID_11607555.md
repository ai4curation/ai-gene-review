Plants possess multiple resistance mechanisms that guard against pathogen 
attack. Among these are inducible systems such as systemic acquired resistance 
(SAR). SAR is activated by pathogen exposure and leads to an increase in 
salicylic acid (SA), high-level expression of SAR-related genes, and resistance 
to a spectrum of pathogens. To identify components of the signal transduction 
pathways regulating SAR, a mutant screen was developed that uses 
2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid as an activator of SAR gene expression and 
pathogen resistance, followed by assays for resistance to the fungal pathogen 
Peronospora parasitica. Mutants from this screen were subsequently examined to 
assess their defense responses. We describe here a recessive mutation that 
causes a phenotype of insensitivity to chemical and biological inducers of SAR 
genes and resistance. These data indicate the existence of a common signaling 
pathway that couples these diverse stimuli to induction of SAR genes and 
resistance. Because of its non-inducible immunity phenotype, we call this mutant 
nim1. Although nim1 plants fail to respond to SA, they retain the ability to 
accumulate wild-type levels of SA, a probable endogenous signal for SAR. 
Further, the ability of nim1 plants to support growth of normally incompatible 
races of a fungal pathogen indicates a role for this pathway in expression of 
genetically determined resistance, consistent with earlier findings for 
transgenic plants engineered to break down SA. These results suggest that the 
wild-type NIM1 gene product functions in a pathway regulating acquired 
resistance, at a position downstream of SA accumulation and upstream of SAR gene 
induction and expression of resistance.
