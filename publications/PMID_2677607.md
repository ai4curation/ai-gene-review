The beta-lactamase fusion vector, pJBS633, has been used to analyse the 
organization of penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3) in the cytoplasmic membrane 
of Escherichia coli. The fusion junctions in 84 in-frame fusions of the coding 
region of mature TEM beta-lactamase to random positions within the PBP3 gene 
were determined. Fusions of beta-lactamase to 61 different positions in PBP3 
were obtained. Fusions to positions within the first 31 residues of PBP3 
resulted in enzymatically active fusion proteins which could not protect single 
cells of E. coli from killing by ampicillin, indicating that the beta-lactamase 
moieties of these fusion proteins were not translocated to the periplasm. 
However, all fusions that contained greater than or equal to 36 residues of PBP3 
provided single cells of E. coli with substantial levels of resistance to 
ampicillin, indicating that the beta-lactamase moieties of these fusion proteins 
were translocated to the periplasm. PBP3 therefore appeared to have a simple 
membrane topology with residues 36 to the carboxy-terminus exposed on the 
periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane. This topology was confirmed by 
showing that PBP3 was protected from proteolytic digestion at the cytoplasmic 
side of the inner membrane but was completely digested by proteolytic attack 
from the periplasmic side. PBP3 was only inserted in the cytoplasmic membrane at 
its amino terminus since replacement of its putative lipoprotein signal peptide 
with a normal signal peptide resulted in a water-soluble, periplasmic form of 
the enzyme. The periplasmic form of PBP3 retained its penicillin-binding 
activity and appeared to be truly water-soluble since it fractionated, in the 
absence of detergents, with the expected molecular weight on Sephadex G-100 and 
was not retarded by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on Phenyl-Superose.
