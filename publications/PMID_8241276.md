We have determined the cDNA sequence of a human B cell specific, immediate early 
gene, designated 1R20, which is inducible in response to several B cell 
activation signals. The cDNA sequence predicts a 196 amino acid open reading 
frame comprising numerous highly basic residues and the predicted structure 
contains several potential alpha helical domains together with eight consensus 
protein phosphorylation sites. The 1R20 gene has been localised by fluorescence 
in situ hybridisation to chromosome band 1q31, a region known to be implicated 
in the pathogenesis of haemopoietic malignancies.
