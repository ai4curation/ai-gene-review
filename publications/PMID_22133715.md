The eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin CCT (chaperonin-containing TCP-1) assists 
folding of newly synthesized polypeptides. The fully functional CCT is built 
from two identical rings, each composed of single copies of eight distinct 
subunits. To study the structure and function of the CCT complex and the role of 
each subunit, a rapid and efficient method for preparing a recombinant CCT 
complex is needed. In this work, we established an efficient expression and 
purification method to obtain human recombinant CCT. BHK-21 cells were infected 
with a vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase and transfected with eight 
plasmids, each encoding any one of the eight CCT subunits in the T7 RNA 
polymerase promoter/terminator unit. The CCT1 subunit was engineered to carry a 
hexa-histidine tag or FLAG tag in the internal loop region. Three days later, 
cells were harvested for purification of the CCT complex through tag-dependent 
affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The purified recombinant CCT 
complexes were indistinguishable from the endogenous CCT purified from HeLa 
cells in terms of morphology and function. In conclusion, the co-expression 
system established in this study should be a simple and powerful tool for 
reconstitution of a large multi-subunit complex.
