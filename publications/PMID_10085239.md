Transcription of the asparagine synthetase (AS) gene is induced by amino acid 
deprivation. The present data illustrate that this gene is also under 
transcriptional control by carbohydrate availability. Incubation of human HepG2 
hepatoma cells in glucose-free medium resulted in an increased AS mRNA content, 
reaching a maximum of about 14-fold over control cells after approx. 12 h. 
Extracellular glucose caused the repression of the content of AS mRNA in a 
concentration-dependent manner, with a k1/2 (concentration causing a 
half-maximal repression) of 1 mM. Fructose, galactose, mannose, 2-deoxyglucose 
and xylitol were found to maintain the mRNA content of both AS and the 
glucose-regulated protein GRP78 in a state of repression, whereas 
3-O-methylglucose did not. Incubation in either histidine-free or glucose-free 
medium also resulted in adaptive regulation of the AS gene in BNL-CL.2 mouse 
hepatocytes, rat C6 glioma cells and human MOLT4 lymphocytes, in addition to 
HepG2 cells. In contrast, the steady-state mRNA content of GRP78 was unaffected 
by amino acid availability. Transient transfection assays using a reporter gene 
construct documented that glucose deprivation increases AS gene transcription 
via elements within the proximal 3 kbp of the AS promoter. These results 
illustrate that human AS gene transcription is induced following glucose 
limitation of the cells.

Abstract

Transcription of the asparagine synthetase (AS) gene is induced by amino acid deprivation. The present data illustrate that this gene is also under transcriptional control by carbohydrate availability. Incubation of human HepG2 hepatoma cells in glucose-free medium resulted in an increased AS mRNA content, reaching a maximum of about 14-fold over control cells after approx. 12 h. Extracellular glucose caused the repression of the content of AS mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner, with a k1/2 (concentration causing a half-maximal repression) of 1 mM. Fructose, galactose, mannose, 2-deoxyglucose and xylitol were found to maintain the mRNA content of both AS and the glucose-regulated protein GRP78 in a state of repression, whereas 3-O-methylglucose did not. Incubation in either histidine-free or glucose-free medium also resulted in adaptive regulation of the AS gene in BNL-CL.2 mouse hepatocytes, rat C6 glioma cells and human MOLT4 lymphocytes, in addition to HepG2 cells. In contrast, the steady-state mRNA content of GRP78 was unaffected by amino acid availability. Transient transfection assays using a reporter gene construct documented that glucose deprivation increases AS gene transcription via elements within the proximal 3 kbp of the AS promoter. These results illustrate that human AS gene transcription is induced following glucose limitation of the cells.
