Oxidative stress damage to the lens is a key factor in most cataracts. Forkhead 
box O 4 (FOXO4), a member of the forkhead box O family, plays a pivotal role in 
oxidative stress. FOXO4 is upregulated in lens of age-related cataract patients, 
but its role in cataract has not been elucidated. Herein, we investigated the 
role and mechanism of FOXO4 during oxidative stress damage in lens epithelial 
cells. H2O2 treatment enhanced FOXO4 expression in HLEpiC cells. Short hairpin 
RNAs mediated FOXO4 silence aggravated H2O2-induced cell apoptosis. In addition, 
upon H2O2 exposure, silencing of FOXO4 reduced SOD and CAT activities, as well 
as increased intracellular MDA and ROS levels. FOXO4 silencing also inhibited 
Nrf2 nuclear translocation, followed by reducing the expressions of 
Nrf2-governed antioxidant genes HO-1 and NOQ-1. Exogenous overexpression of 
FOXO4 was also involved in this study and exhibited opposite effects of 
FOXO4-silencing. Mechanistically, FOXO4 directly bound the promoter of TRIM25 
and regulated its transcription, thereby activating the Nrf2 signaling. Taken 
together, in the condition of oxidative stress, the expression of FOXO4 showed a 
compensatory upregulation and it exhibited an anti-oxidative effect by 
modulating the transcription of TRIM25, thus activating the Nrf2 signaling. The 
FOXO4/TRIM25/Nrf2 axis may be associated with the pathological mechanisms of 
cataract.
