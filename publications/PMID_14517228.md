Productive cis folding by the chaperonin GroEL is triggered by the binding of 
ATP but not ADP, along with cochaperonin GroES, to the same ring as non-native 
polypeptide, ejecting polypeptide into an encapsulated hydrophilic chamber. We 
examined the specific contribution of the gamma-phosphate of ATP to this 
activation process using complexes of ADP and aluminium or beryllium fluoride. 
These ATP analogues supported productive cis folding of the substrate protein, 
rhodanese, even when added to already-formed, folding-inactive cis ADP ternary 
complexes, essentially introducing the gamma-phosphate of ATP in an independent 
step. Aluminium fluoride was observed to stabilize the association of GroES with 
GroEL, with a substantial release of free energy (-46 kcal/mol). To understand 
the basis of such activation and stabilization, a crystal structure of 
GroEL-GroES-ADP.AlF3 was determined at 2.8 A. A trigonal AlF3 metal complex was 
observed in the gamma-phosphate position of the nucleotide pocket of the cis 
ring. Surprisingly, when this structure was compared with that of the previously 
determined GroEL-GroES-ADP complex, no other differences were observed. We 
discuss the likely basis of the ability of gamma-phosphate binding to convert 
preformed GroEL-GroES-ADP-polypeptide complexes into the folding-active state.
