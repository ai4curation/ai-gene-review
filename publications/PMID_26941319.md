Genome replication introduces a stepwise increase in the DNA template available 
for transcription. Genes replicated early in S phase experience this increase 
before late-replicating genes, raising the question of how expression levels are 
affected by DNA replication. We show that in budding yeast, messenger RNA (mRNA) 
synthesis rate is buffered against changes in gene dosage during S phase. This 
expression homeostasis depends on acetylation of H3 on its internal K56 site by 
Rtt109/Asf1. Deleting these factors, mutating H3K56 or up-regulating its 
deacetylation, increases gene expression in S phase in proportion to gene 
replication timing. Therefore, H3K56 acetylation on newly deposited histones 
reduces transcription efficiency from replicated DNA, complementing its role in 
guarding genome stability. Our study provides molecular insight into the 
mechanism maintaining expression homeostasis during DNA replication.
