TRAF6 is a signal transducer that activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) and Jun 
amino-terminal kinase (JNK) in response to pro-inflammatory mediators such as 
interleukin-1 (IL-1) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). IKK activation by TRAF6 
requires two intermediary factors, TRAF6-regulated IKK activator 1 (TRIKA1) and 
TRIKA2 (ref. 5). TRIKA1 is a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex 
composed of Ubc13 and Uev1A (or the functionally equivalent Mms2). This Ubc 
complex, together with TRAF6, catalyses the formation of a Lys 63 (K63)-linked 
polyubiquitin chain that mediates IKK activation through a unique 
proteasome-independent mechanism. Here we report the purification and 
identification of TRIKA2, which is composed of TAK1, TAB1 and TAB2, a protein 
kinase complex previously implicated in IKK activation through an unknown 
mechanism. We find that the TAK1 kinase complex phosphorylates and activates IKK 
in a manner that depends on TRAF6 and Ubc13-Uev1A. Moreover, the activity of 
TAK1 to phosphorylate MKK6, which activates the JNK-p38 kinase pathway, is 
directly regulated by K63-linked polyubiquitination. We also provide evidence 
that TRAF6 is conjugated by the K63 polyubiquitin chains. These results indicate 
that ubiquitination has an important regulatory role in stress response 
pathways, including those of IKK and JNK.
