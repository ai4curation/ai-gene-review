The SWI1/ADR6, SWI2/SNF2, SWI3, SNF5, and SNF6 gene products are all required 
for proper transcriptional control of many genes in the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Genetic studies indicated that these gene products might form a 
multiprotein SWI/SNF complex important for chromatin transitions preceding 
transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters. Biochemical studies identified a 
SWI/SNF complex containing these and at least six additional polypeptides. Here 
we show that the 29-kDa component of the SWI/SNF complex is identical to 
TFG3/TAF30/ANC1. Thus, a component of the SWI/SNF complex is also a member of 
the TFIIF and TFIID transcription complexes. TFG3 interacted with the SNF5 
component of the SWI/SNF complex in protein interaction blots. TFG3 is 
significantly similar to ENL and AF-9, two proteins implicated in human acute 
leukemia. These results suggest that ENL and AF-9 proteins interact with the 
SNF5 component of the human SWI/SNF complex and raise the possibility that the 
SWI/SNF complex is involved in acute leukemia.
