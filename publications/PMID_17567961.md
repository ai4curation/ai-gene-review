Eppin (SPINLW1; serine peptidase inhibitor-like with Kunitz and WAP domains 1 
(eppin); epididymal protease inhibitor) coats the surface of human ejaculate 
spermatozoa and originates from Sertoli and epididymal epithelial cells. In this 
study, we have isolated native eppin from ejaculate supernatants (seminal 
plasma) and washed ejaculate spermatozoa using column chromatography and 
two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and identified by mass spectrometry and Western blots 
an eppin protein complex (EPC) containing lactotransferrin (LTF; also known as 
lactoferrin), clusterin (CLU), and semenogelin (SEMG1). To confirm the 
association of eppin with LTF, CLU, and SEMG1, antibodies to CLU and LTF were 
used to immunoprecipitate CLU and LTF from human sperm lysates. In both cases 
identical results were obtained, namely, the immunoprecipitate of the EPC. 
Additionally, we localized eppin, LTF, and CLU in human Sertoli cells and on 
human testicular and ejaculate spermatozoa, implying that the EPC is present on 
spermatozoa from the time they leave the seminiferous tubule. On ejaculate 
spermatozoa eppin, LTF, and CLU colocalize on the tail. The identification of 
the EPC components suggests that LTF, CLU, and/or eppin receptors may function 
as sperm plasma membrane receptors for the EPC, implicating the complex as a 
central player in a network of protein-protein interactions on the human sperm 
surface. The EPC may provide a surface network with microbicidal properties that 
protects spermatozoa as well as regulates the sperm's transition to a motile, 
capacitated sperm.
