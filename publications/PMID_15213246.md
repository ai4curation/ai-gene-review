Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital muscular dystrophy 1C 
are congenital muscular dystrophies that commonly display reduced levels of 
glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in skeletal muscle. The genes responsible 
for these disorders are fukutin and fukutin-related protein (FKRP), 
respectively. Both gene products are thought to be glycosyltransferases, but 
their functions have not been established. In this study, we determined their 
subcellular localizations in cultured skeletal myocytes. FKRP localizes in rough 
endoplasmic reticulum, while fukutin localizes in the cis-Golgi compartment. 
FKRP was also localized in rough endoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle biopsy 
sample. Our data suggest that fukutin and FKRP may be involved at different 
steps in O-mannosylglycan synthesis of alpha-dystroglycan, and FKRP is most 
likely involved in the initial step in this synthesis.
