Carnitine is a zwitterion essential for the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. We 
report novel localization of the organic cation/carnitine transporter, OCTN1, to 
mitochondria. We made GFP- and RFP-human OCTN1 cDNA constructs and showed 
expression of hOCTN1 in several transfected mammalian cell lines. Immunostaining 
of GFP-hOCTN1 transfected cells with different intracellular markers and 
confocal fluorescent microscopy demonstrated mitochondrial expression of OCTN1. 
There was striking co-localization of an RFP-hOCTN1 fusion protein and a 
mitochondrial-GFP marker construct in transfected MEF-3T3 and no co-localization 
of GFP-hOCTN1 in transfected human skin fibroblasts with other intracellular 
markers. L-[(3)H]Carnitine uptake in freshly isolated mitochondria of GFP-hOCTN1 
transfected HepG2 demonstrated a K(m) of 422 microM and Western blot with an 
anti-GFP antibody identified the expected GFP-hOCTN1 fusion protein (90 kDa). We 
showed endogenous expression of native OCTN1 in HepG2 mitochondria with 
anti-GST-hOCTN1 antibody. Further, we definitively confirmed intact 
L-[(3)H]carnitine uptake (K(m) 1324 microM), solely attributable to OCTN1, in 
isolated mitochondria of mutant human skin fibroblasts having <1% of carnitine 
acylcarnitine translocase activity (alternate mitochondrial carnitine 
transporter). This mitochondrial localization was confirmed by TEM of murine 
heart incubated with highly specific rabbit anti-GST-hOCTN1 antibody and 
immunogold labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. This suggests an important yet 
different role for OCTN1 from other OCTN family members in intracellular 
carnitine homeostasis.
