Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a family of large and dynamic oligomers 
highly expressed in long-lived cells of muscle, lens and brain. Several family 
members are upregulated during stress, and some are strongly cytoprotective. 
Their polydispersity has hindered high-resolution structure analyses, 
particularly for vertebrate sHsps. Here, crystal structures of excised 
alpha-crystallin domain from rat Hsp20 and that from human alphaB-crystallin 
show that they form homodimers with a shared groove at the interface by 
extending a beta sheet. However, the two dimers differ in the register of their 
interfaces. The dimers have empty pockets that in large assemblies will likely 
be filled by hydrophobic sequence motifs from partner chains. In the Hsp20 
dimer, the shared groove is partially filled by peptide in polyproline II 
conformation. Structural homology with other sHsp crystal structures indicates 
that in full-length chains the groove is likely filled by an N-terminal 
extension. Inside the groove is a symmetry-related functionally important 
arginine that is mutated, or its equivalent, in family members in a range of 
neuromuscular diseases and cataract. Analyses of residues within the groove of 
the alphaB-crystallin interface show that it has a high density of positive 
charges. The disease mutant R120G alpha-crystallin domain dimer was found to be 
more stable at acidic pH, suggesting that the mutation affects the normal 
dynamics of sHsp assembly. The structures provide a starting point for modelling 
higher assembly by defining the spatial locations of grooves and pockets in a 
basic dimeric assembly unit. The structures provide a high-resolution view of a 
candidate functional state of an sHsp that could bind non-native client proteins 
or specific components from cytoprotective pathways. The empty pockets and 
groove provide a starting model for designing drugs to inhibit those sHsps that 
have a negative effect on cancer treatment.
