Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a clinically recognizable multiple congenital 
anomaly/mental retardation syndrome associated with deletion of chromosome 
17p11.2. Here we report the identification of a novel gene encoding a human 
microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MFAP4), which has been mapped to the SMS 
region. A full-length cDNA corresponding to this gene has been sequenced, and 
reveals a coding region of 255 amino acids. MFAP4 has a fibrinogen-like domain 
and shares a high level of sequence homology to a fragment of a bovine 36 kDa 
microfibril-associated glycoprotein. The N-terminus of the protein bears an 
Arg-Gly-Asp sequence that serves as the ligand motif for cell surface receptor 
integrin. These structural features of MFAP4 suggest that it is an extracellular 
matrix protein involved in cell adhesion or intercellular interactions. Deletion 
analysis has been conducted on 31 SMS patients by polymerase chain reaction and 
Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids retaining the del(17)(p11.2) 
chromosome or by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The MFAP4 locus is deleted 
in 30 of 31 SMS patients. Thus, the function of this gene must be considered in 
the pathogenesis of SMS. Given our previous hypothesis that SMS is a contiguous 
gene syndrome, complete and exhaustive definition of the critical deletion 
interval and a thorough phenotype-genotype correlation is required to 
demonstrate the role and importance of the MFAP4 gene in SMS.
