Werner syndrome is a hereditary disorder characterized by the early onset of 
age-related symptoms, including cancer. The absence of a p53-WRN helicase 
interaction may disrupt the signal to direct S-phase cells into apoptosis for 
programmed cell death and contribute to the pronounced genomic instability and 
cancer predisposition in Werner syndrome cells. Results from 
coimmunoprecipitation studies indicate that WRN is associated with replication 
protein A (RPA) and p53 in vivo before and after treatment with the replication 
inhibitor hydroxyurea or gamma-irradiation that introduces DNA strand breaks. 
Analysis of the protein interactions among purified recombinant WRN, RPA, and 
p53 proteins indicate that all three protein pairs bind with similar affinity in 
the low nanomolar range. In vitro studies show that p53 inhibits RPA-stimulated 
WRN helicase activity on an 849-bp M13 partial duplex substrate. p53 also 
inhibited WRN unwinding of a short (19-bp) forked duplex substrate in the 
absence of RPA. WRN unwinding of the forked duplex substrate was specific, 
because helicase inhibition mediated by p53 was retained in the presence of 
excess competitor DNA and was significantly reduced or absent in helicase 
reactions catalyzed by a WRN helicase domain fragment lacking the p53 binding 
site or the human RECQ1 DNA helicase, respectively. p53 effectively inhibited 
WRN helicase activity on model DNA substrate intermediates of 
replication/repair, a 5' ssDNA flap structure and a synthetic replication fork. 
Regulation of WRN helicase activity by p53 is likely to play an important role 
in genomic integrity surveillance, a vital function in the prevention of tumor 
progression.
