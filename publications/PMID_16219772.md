ATF4 plays a crucial role in the cellular response to stress and multiple stress 
responses pathways converge to the translational up-regulation of ATF4. ATF4 is 
a substrate of the SCF(betaTrCP) ubiquitin ligase that binds to betaTrCP through 
phosphorylation on a DSGXXXS motif. We show here that ATF4 stability is also 
modulated by the histone acetyltransferase p300, which induces ATF4 
stabilization by inhibiting its ubiquitination. Despite p300 acetylates ATF4, we 
found that p300-mediated ATF4 stabilization is independent of p300 catalytic 
activity, using either the inactive form of p300 or the acetylation mutant 
ATF4-K311R. ATF4 deleted of its p300 binding domain is no more stabilized by 
p300 nor recruited into nuclear speckles. In consequence of ATF4 stabilization, 
both p300 and the catalytically inactive enzyme increase ATF4 transcriptional 
activity.
