Escherichia coli spheroplast protein y (EcSpy) is a small periplasmic protein 
that is homologous with CpxP, an inhibitor of the extracytoplasmic stress 
response. Stress conditions such as spheroplast formation induce the expression 
of Spy via the Cpx or the Bae two-component systems in E. coli, though the 
function of Spy is unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of EcSpy, 
which reveals a long kinked hairpin-like structure of four α-helices that form 
an antiparallel dimer. The dimer contains a curved oval shape with a highly 
positively charged concave surface that may function as a ligand binding site. 
Sequence analysis reveals that Spy is highly conserved over the 
Enterobacteriaceae family. Notably, three conserved regions that contain 
identical residues and two LTxxQ motifs are placed at the horizontal end of the 
dimer structure, stabilizing the overall fold. CpxP also contains the conserved 
sequence motifs and has a predicted secondary structure similar to Spy, 
suggesting that Spy and CpxP likely share the same fold.
