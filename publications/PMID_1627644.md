cDNA encoding the human homologue of mouse APEX nuclease was isolated from a 
human bone-marrow cDNA library by screening with cDNA for mouse APEX nuclease. 
The mouse enzyme has been shown to possess four enzymatic activities, i.e., 
apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, 3'-5' exonuclease, DNA 3'-phosphatase and 
DNA 3' repair diesterase activities. The cDNA for human APEX nuclease was 1420 
nucleotides long, consisting of a 5' terminal untranslated region of 205 
nucleotide long, a coding region of 954 nucleotide long encoding 318 amino acid 
residues, a 3' terminal untranslated region of 261 nucleotide long, and a 
poly(A) tail. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of APEX 
nuclease purified from HeLa cells showed that the mature enzyme lacks the 
N-terminal methionine. The amino acid sequence of human APEX nuclease has 94% 
sequence identity with that of mouse APEX nuclease, and shows significant 
homologies to those of Escherichia coli exonuclease III and Streptococcus 
pneumoniae ExoA protein. The coding sequence of human APEX nuclease was cloned 
into the pUC18 SmaI site in the control frame of the lacZ promoter. The 
construct was introduced into BW2001 (xth-11, nfo-2) strain and BW9109 (delta 
xth) strain cells of E. coli. The transformed cells expressed a 36.4 kDa 
polypeptide (the 317 amino acid sequence of APEX nuclease headed by the 
N-terminal decapeptide derived from the part of pUC18 sequence), and were less 
sensitive to methylmethanesulfonate and tert-butyl-hydroperoxide than the parent 
cells. The N-terminal regions of the constructed protein and APEX nuclease were 
cleaved frequently during the extraction and purification processes of protein 
to produce the 31, 33 and 35 kDa C-terminal fragments showing priming activities 
for DNA polymerase on acid-depurinated DNA and bleomycin-damaged DNA. Formation 
of such enzymatically active fragments of APEX nuclease may be a cause of 
heterogeneity of purified preparations of mammalian AP endonucleases. Based on 
analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence and the active fragments of APEX 
nuclease, it is suggested that the enzyme is organized into two domains, a 6 kDa 
N-terminal domain having nuclear location signals and 29 kDa C-terminal, 
catalytic domain.
