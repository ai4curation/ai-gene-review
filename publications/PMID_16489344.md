The mammalian Golgi apparatus exists as stacks of cisternae that are laterally 
linked to form a continuous membrane ribbon, but neither the molecular 
requirements for, nor the purpose of, Golgi ribbon formation are known. Here, we 
demonstrate that ribbon formation is mediated by specific membrane-fusion events 
that occur during Golgi assembly, and require the Golgi proteins GM130 and 
GRASP65. Furthermore, these GM130 and GRASP65-dependent lateral cisternal-fusion 
reactions are necessary to achieve uniform distribution of enzymes in the Golgi 
ribbon. The membrane continuity created by ribbon formation facilitates optimal 
processing conditions in the biosynthetic pathway.
