The concave surface of the crescent-shaped Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain is 
postulated to bind to the cell membrane to induce membrane deformation of a 
specific curvature. The Rac binding (RCB) domain/IRSp53-MIM homology domain 
(IMD) has a dimeric structure that is similar to the structure of the BAR 
domain; however, the RCB domain/IMD has a "zeppelin-shaped" dimer. 
Interestingly, the RCB domain/IMD of IRSp53 possesses Rac binding, membrane 
binding, and actin filament binding abilities. Here we report that the RCB 
domain/IMD of IRSp53 induces membrane deformation independent of the actin 
filaments in a Rac-dependent manner. In contrast to the BAR domain, the RCB 
domain/IMD did not cause long tubulation of the artificial liposomes; however, 
the Rac binding domain caused the formation of small buds on the liposomal 
surface. When expressed in cells, the Rac binding domain induced outward 
protrusion of the plasma membrane in a direction opposite to that induced by the 
BAR domain. Mapping of the amino acids responsible for membrane deformation 
suggests that the convex surface of the Rac binding domain binds to the membrane 
in a Rac-dependent manner, which may explain the mechanism of the membrane 
deformation induced by the RCB domain/IMD.
