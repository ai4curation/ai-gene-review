Bacterial cell division typically requires assembly of the cytoskeletal protein 
FtsZ into a ring (Z-ring) at the nascent division site that serves as a 
foundation for assembly of the division apparatus. High resolution imaging 
suggests that the Z-ring consists of short, single-stranded polymers held 
together by lateral interactions. Several proteins implicated in stabilizing the 
Z-ring enhance lateral interactions between FtsZ polymers in vitro. Here we 
report that residues at the C terminus of Bacillus subtilis FtsZ (C-terminal 
variable region (CTV)) are both necessary and sufficient for stimulating lateral 
interactions in vitro in the absence of modulatory proteins. Swapping the 
6-residue CTV from B. subtilis FtsZ with the 4-residue CTV from Escherichia coli 
FtsZ completely abolished lateral interactions between chimeric B. subtilis FtsZ 
polymers. The E. coli FtsZ chimera readily formed higher order structures 
normally seen only in the presence of molecular crowding agents. CTV-mediated 
lateral interactions are important for the integrity of the Z-ring because B. 
subtilis cells expressing the B. subtilis FtsZ chimera had a low frequency of 
FtsZ ring formation and a high degree of filamentation relative to wild-type 
cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of the B. subtilis CTV suggests that 
electrostatic forces are an important determinant of lateral interaction 
potential.
