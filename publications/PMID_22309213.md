SIRT3 (sirtuin 3) modulates respiration via the deacetylation of lysine residues 
in electron transport chain proteins. Whether mitochondrial protein acetylation 
is controlled by a counter-regulatory program has remained elusive. In the 
present study we identify an essential component of this previously undefined 
mitochondrial acetyltransferase system. We show that GCN5L1 [GCN5 (general 
control of amino acid synthesis 5)-like 1; also known as Bloc1s1] counters the 
acetylation and respiratory effects of SIRT3. GCN5L1 is mitochondrial-enriched 
and displays significant homology with a prokaryotic acetyltransferase. Genetic 
knockdown of GCN5L1 blunts mitochondrial protein acetylation, and its 
reconstitution in intact mitochondria restores protein acetylation. GCN5L1 
interacts with and promotes acetylation of SIRT3 respiratory chain targets and 
reverses global SIRT3 effects on mitochondrial protein acetylation, respiration 
and bioenergetics. The results of the present study identify GCN5L1 as a 
critical prokaryote-derived component of the mitochondrial acetyltransferase 
programme.
