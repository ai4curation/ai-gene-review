BACKGROUND: Myhre syndrome is an exceedingly rare yet increasingly diagnosed 
genetic disorder arising from germline variants in the SMAD4 gene. Its core 
manifestation is the progression of stiffness and fibrosis across multiple 
organs. Individuals with Myhre syndrome exhibit a propensity for upper 
respiratory tract remodeling and infections. The molecular and cellular 
mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate how SMAD4 pathogenic variants associated 
with Myhre syndrome affect SMAD4 protein levels, activation, and physiological 
functions in patient-derived nasal epithelial cells.
METHODS: Clinical observations were conducted on a cohort of 47 patients 
recruited at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2016 to 2023. Nasal epithelial 
basal cells were isolated and cultured from inferior turbinate brushings of 
healthy subjects (n = 8) and patients with Myhre syndrome (n = 3; 
SMAD4-Ile500Val, Arg496Cys, and Ile500Thr). Transcriptomic analysis and 
functional assays were performed to assess SMAD4 levels, transcriptional 
activity, and epithelial cell host defense functions, including cell 
proliferation, mucociliary differentiation, and bacterial elimination.
RESULTS: Clinical observations revealed a prevalent history of otitis media and 
sinusitis among most individuals with Myhre syndrome. Analyses of nasal 
epithelial cells indicated that SMAD4 mutations do not alter SMAD4 protein 
stability or upstream regulatory SMAD phosphorylation but enhance signaling 
transcriptional activity, supporting a gain-of-function mechanism, likely 
attributable to increased protein-protein interaction of the SMAD complex. 
Consequently, Myhre syndrome nasal basal cells exhibit reduced potential in cell 
proliferation and mucociliary differentiation. Furthermore, Myhre syndrome nasal 
epithelia are impaired in bacterial killing.
CONCLUSIONS: Compromised innate immunity originating from epithelial cells in 
Myhre syndrome may contribute to increased susceptibility to upper respiratory 
tract infections.
