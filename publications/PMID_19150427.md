Triacylglycerols (TGs) serve essential cellular functions as reservoirs for 
energy substrates (fatty acids) and membrane lipid precursors (diacylglycerols 
and fatty acids). Here we show that the major yeast TG lipase Tgl4, the 
functional ortholog of murine adipose TG lipase ATGL, is phosphorylated and 
activated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1/Cdc28). Phospho-Tgl4-catalyzed 
lipolysis contributes to early bud formation in late G1 phase of the cell cycle. 
Conversely, lack of lipolysis delays bud formation and cell-cycle progression. 
In the absence of beta-oxidation, lipolysis-derived metabolites are thus 
required to support cellular growth. TG homeostasis is the only metabolic 
process identified as yet that is directly regulated by Cdk1/Cdc28-dependent 
phosphorylation of key anabolic and catabolic enzymes, highlighting the 
importance of FA storage and mobilization during the cell cycle. Our data 
provide evidence for a direct link between cell-cycle-regulatory kinases and TG 
degradation and suggest a general mechanism for coordinating membrane synthesis 
with cell-cycle progression.
