The 12-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism in platelets and 
other cells is bifurcated into a reduction route yielding 
12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and an isomerization route forming 
hepoxilins. Here we show for the first time the presence of phospholipid 
hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) protein and its activity in 
platelets. The ratio of the activity of PHGPx to that of cytosolic glutathione 
peroxidase (GPx-1) was consistently found to be approx. 1:60 in platelets and 
UT7 megakaryoblasts. Moreover, short-lived PHGPx mRNA was detected in 
megakaryocytes but not in platelets. Carboxymethylation of selenium-containing 
glutathione peroxidases by iodoacetate, which results in the inactivation of 
PHGPx and GPx-1 without inhibition of 12-lipoxygenase, markedly altered the 
pattern of arachidonic acid metabolism in human platelets. Whereas the formation 
of 12-HETE was inhibited by 80%, a concomitant accumulation of 
12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HpETE) by two orders of magnitude as 
well as the formation of hepoxilins A(3) and B(3) were observed. The formation 
of hepoxilins also occurred when 12-HpETE was added to untreated platelets. In 
selenium-deficient UT7 cells, which were devoid of GPx-1 but not of PHGPx, the 
reduction of 12-HPETE was retained, albeit with a lower rate than in control 
cells containing GPx-1. We therefore believe that both GPx-1 and PHGPx are 
involved in the regulatory network of the 12-lipoxygenase pathway in platelets 
and other mammalian cells. Moreover, the diminution of hydroperoxide tone in 
platelets incubated with arachidonic acid leads primarily to the formation of 
12-HETE, whereas the increase in hydroperoxide tone (a situation found under 
oxidative stress or selenium deficiency or on incubation with 12-HPETE) partly 
diverts the 12-lipoxygenase pathway from the reduction route to the 
isomerization route, thus resulting in the formation of hepoxilins.
