PURPOSE: Distributions for the constitutive and inducible 70-kDa heat shock 
proteins, Hsc70 and Hsp70, in different parts of the rat eye are likely to be 
related to the metabolic demands required for absorption and detection of light. 
This study was conducted to better understand the functions of Hsc70 and Hsp70 
in these tissues and to provide a basis for elucidating their contributions to 
the maintenance and repair of ocular structures subsequent to tissue injury or 
cellular degeneration.
METHODS: Eyes from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) were fixed in methacarn 
and embedded in paraffin. Sagittal sections (10 microm) through the optic nerve 
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or incubated with heat shock protein 
antibody or control IgG. Bound antibody was visualized using an avidin- biotin- 
horseradish peroxidase detection system.
RESULTS: Hsc70 immunoreactivity was detected in all layers of the retina, except 
the outer segments. In the retinal pigment epithelium, staining was restricted 
to cells near the optic nerve-retina junction. Intense staining was also 
observed in glial nuclei of the optic nerve, whereas weaker staining was 
observed in the basal and wing cells of the limbal and corneal epithelia. In 
contrast, Hsp70 immunoreactivity was restricted to the outer nuclear layer and 
inner segments of the retina. Hsp70 staining was also prominent in basal and 
wing cells of the limbal cornea and to a lesser extent in the central corneal 
epithelium. The optic nerve was Hsp70 negative.
CONCLUSIONS: Hsc70 and Hsp70 have distinct distributions in the normal rat eye, 
which imply regional and cell-specific functions.
