PDI1 is the essential gene encoding protein disulfide isomerase in yeast. The 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, however, contains four other nonessential genes 
with homology to PDI1: MPD1, MPD2, EUG1, and EPS1. We have investigated the 
effects of simultaneous deletions of these genes. In several cases, we found 
that the ability of the PDI1 homologues to restore viability to a pdi1-deleted 
strain when overexpressed was dependent on the presence of low endogenous levels 
of one or more of the other homologues. This shows that the homologues are not 
functionally interchangeable. In fact, Mpd1p was the only homologue capable of 
carrying out all the essential functions of Pdi1p. Furthermore, the presence of 
endogenous homologues with a CXXC motif in the thioredoxin-like domain is 
required for suppression of a pdi1 deletion by EUG1 (which contains two CXXS 
active site motifs). This underlines the essentiality of protein disulfide 
isomerase-catalyzed oxidation. Most mutant combinations show defects in 
carboxypeptidase Y folding as well as in glycan modification. There are, 
however, no significant effects on ER-associated protein degradation in the 
various protein disulfide isomerase-deleted strains.
