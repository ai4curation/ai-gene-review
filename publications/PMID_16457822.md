Searching for CCN family protein 2/connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) 
interactive proteins by yeast-two-hybrid screening, we identified fibronectin 1 
gene product as a major binding partner of CCN2/CTGF in the 
chondrosarcoma-derived chondrocytic cell line HCS-2/8. Only the CT domain of 
CCN2/CTGF bound directly to fibronectin (FN). CCN2/CTGF and its CT domain 
enhanced the adhesion of HCS-2/8 cells to FN in a dose-dependent manner. The 
CCN2/CTGF-enhancing effect on cell adhesion to FN was abolished by a blocking 
antibody against alpha5beta1 integrin (alpha5beta1), but not by one against 
anti-alphavbeta3 integrin. These findings suggest for the first time that 
CCN2/CTGF enhances chondrocyte adhesion to FN through direct interaction of its 
C-terminal CT domain with FN, and that alpha5beta1 is involved in this adhesion.
