The telomere DNA polymerase (telomerase) and the tumor suppressor protein p53 
are frequently associated with human cancers, and activation of telomerase and 
inactivation of p53 involved in cancer cell immortalization. In this report, we 
demonstrate a direct interaction of telomerase with p53 in the nuclear lysates 
of human breast cancer cells, and with recombinant human p53, by affinity 
chromatography and immunoprecipitation. On activity criteria, the interaction is 
between the carboxyl-terminal region of p53 and a region close to the 
amino-terminus of human telomerase-associated protein 1 (hTEP1). Incubation of 
recombinant p53 with nuclear telomerase extracts results in inhibition of 
telomerase activity, with the C-terminal region of p53 being essential for 
inhibition. This effect is not mediated by binding to telomerase substrate DNA, 
but requires the region near the N-terminus of hTEP1, in that a synthetic 
peptide derived from this region of hTEP1 similarly inhibits telomerase 
activity. Together, these in vitro interactions between telomerase and p53 
suggest that the activity of telomerase may be regulated by p53, down-regulation 
of which in turn would favor up-regulation of telomerase activity in cancer cell 
development.
