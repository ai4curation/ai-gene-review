Most cancer cells activate telomerase to elongate telomeres and achieve 
unlimited replicative potential. Some cancer cells cannot activate telomerase 
and use telomere homologous recombination (HR) to elongate telomeres, a 
mechanism termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). A hallmark of ALT 
cells is the recruitment of telomeres to PML bodies (termed APBs). Here, we show 
that the SMC5/6 complex localizes to APBs in ALT cells and is required for 
targeting telomeres to APBs. The MMS21 SUMO ligase of the SMC5/6 complex 
SUMOylates multiple telomere-binding proteins, including TRF1 and TRF2. 
Inhibition of TRF1 or TRF2 SUMOylation prevents APB formation. Depletion of 
SMC5/6 subunits by RNA interference inhibits telomere HR, causing telomere 
shortening and senescence in ALT cells. Thus, the SMC5/6 complex facilitates 
telomere HR and elongation in ALT cells by promoting APB formation through 
SUMOylation of telomere-binding proteins.
