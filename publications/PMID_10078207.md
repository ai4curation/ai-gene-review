Protein complexes of the SWI/SNF family remodel nucleosome structure in an 
ATP-dependent manner. Each complex contains between 8 and 15 subunits, several 
of which are highly conserved between yeast, Drosophila, and humans. We have 
reconstituted an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex using a subset of 
conserved subunits. Unexpectedly, both BRG1 and hBRM, the ATPase subunits of 
human SWI/SNF complexes, are capable of remodeling mono-nucleosomes and 
nucleosomal arrays as purified proteins. The addition of INI1, BAF155, and 
BAF170 to BRG1 increases remodeling activity to a level comparable to that of 
the whole hSWI/SNF complex. These data define the functional core of the 
hSWI/SNF complex.
