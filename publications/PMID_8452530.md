Hybrid insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors have previously 
been described in human placenta, but it has not been possible to study their 
properties in the presence of classical insulin receptors and type I IGF 
receptors. To facilitate the purification of hybrids, we produced an 
anti-peptide monoclonal antibody IGFR 1-2, directed against the C-terminal 
peptide of the type I IGF receptor beta-subunit. The antibody bound native human 
and rat type I IGF receptors, and reacted specifically with the beta-subunit on 
immunoblots. Solubilized placental microsomal membranes were depleted of 
classical type I IGF receptors by incubation with an immobilized monoclonal 
antibody IGFR 24-55, which reacts well with type I receptors but very poorly 
with hybrid receptors. Residual hybrid receptors were then isolated by 
incubation with immobilized antibody IGFR 1-2, and recovered by elution with 
excess of synthetic peptide antigen. Binding properties of hybrids were compared 
with those of immuno-affinity-purified insulin receptors and type I IGF 
receptors, by using the radioligands 125I-IGF-I and 125I-insulin. Hybrids bound 
approx. 20 times as much 125I-IGF-I as 125I-insulin at tracer concentrations 
(approx. 0.1 nM). The binding of 125I-insulin, but not 125I-IGF-I, to hybrids 
increased after treatment with dithiothreitol to reduce disulphide bonds between 
the alpha-subunits. Hybrids behaved very similarly to type I receptors with 
respect to the inhibition of 125I-IGF-I binding by unlabelled IGF-I and insulin. 
By contrast, the affinity of hybrids for insulin was approx. 10-fold lower than 
that of classical insulin receptors, as assessed by inhibition of 125I-insulin 
binding by unlabelled hormone. It is concluded that the properties of insulin 
receptors, but not IGF receptors, are markedly affected by assembly as hybrid 
compared with classical structures, and that hybrids are more likely to be 
responsive to IGF-I than insulin under physiological conditions.
