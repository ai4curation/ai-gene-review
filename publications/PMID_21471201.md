DNA-damaging agents can induce premature senescence in cancer cells, which 
contributes to the static effects of cancer. However, senescent cancer cells may 
re-enter the cell cycle and lead to tumor relapse. Understanding the mechanisms 
that control the viability of senescent cells may be helpful in eliminating 
these cells before they can regrow. Treating human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
cells with the anti-cancer compounds, resveratrol and doxorubicin, triggered 
p53-independent premature senescence by invoking oxidative stress-mediated DNA 
damage. This process involved the mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT1 at 
serine 47, resulting in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1. 
SIRT1 phosphorylation caused concomitant increases in p65/RelA NF-κB acetylation 
and the expression of an anti-apoptotic Bfl-1/A1. SIRT1 physically interacts 
with the mTOR-Raptor complex, and a single amino acid substitution in the TOS 
(TOR signaling) motif in the SIRT1 prevented Ser-47 phosphorylation and Bfl-1/A1 
induction. The pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of mTOR, unphosphorylatable 
S47A, or F474A TOS mutants restored SIRT1 deacetylase activity, blocked Bfl-1/A1 
induction, and sensitized prematurely senescent SCC cells for apoptosis. We 
further show that the treatment of UVB-induced SCCs with doxorubicin transiently 
stabilized tumor growth but was followed by tumor regrowth upon drug removal in 
p53(+/-)/SKH-1 mice. The subsequent treatment of stabilized SCCs with rapamycin 
decreased tumor size and induced caspase-3 activation. These results demonstrate 
that the inhibition of SIRT1 by mTOR fosters survival of DNA damage-induced 
prematurely senescent SCC cells via Bfl-1/A1 in the absence of functional p53.
