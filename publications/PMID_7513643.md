Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (ITI) is a tight complex of three different 
proteins: bikunin and two heavy chains H1 and H2. In order to demonstrate that 
the three chains are covalently linked by a chondroitin sulphate chain as 
previously proposed [Enghild, J. J., Salvesen, G., Hefta, S. A., Thogersen, I. 
B., Rutherford, S. and Pizzo, S. V. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 747-751], ITI was 
extensively digested with thermolysin and the glycosaminoglycan-containing 
fragment was isolated from the digest by ion-exchange chromatography. Its 
peptide structural determination and mass spectrometry analysis both provide 
evidence that the different peptide chains constituting ITI are associated by 
the new cross-link described as the protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein 
cross-link.
