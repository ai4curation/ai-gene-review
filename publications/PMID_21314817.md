Fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP) is a cell surface-expressed and soluble 
enzyme of the prolyl oligopeptidase family, which includes dipeptidyl peptidase 
4 (DPP4). FAP is not generally expressed in normal adult tissues, but is found 
at high levels in activated myofibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells in 
fibrosis and in stromal fibroblasts of epithelial tumours. FAP possesses a rare 
catalytic activity, hydrolysis of the post-proline bond two or more residues 
from the N-terminus of target substrates. α(2)-antiplasmin is an important 
physiological substrate of FAP endopeptidase activity. This study reports the 
first natural substrates of FAP dipeptidyl peptidase activity. Neuropeptide Y, 
B-type natriuretic peptide, substance P and peptide YY were the most efficiently 
hydrolysed substrates and the first hormone substrates of FAP to be identified. 
In addition, FAP slowly hydrolysed other hormone peptides, such as the incretins 
glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, which are 
efficient DPP4 substrates. FAP showed negligible or no hydrolysis of eight 
chemokines that are readily hydrolysed by DPP4. This novel identification of FAP 
substrates furthers our understanding of this unique protease by indicating 
potential roles in cardiac function and neurobiology.
