Core I protein is a nuclear-encoded component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c 
reductase complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. We have located the 
gene for the human core I protein in the p21 region of chromosome 3, just 
upstream of the COL7A1 gene which encodes type VII collagen. The core I gene, 
which has been sequenced in its entirety, is comprised of 10,417 base pairs, 
from the major transcription start site to the polyadenylation signal, and 
contains 13 exons. The predicted polypeptide contains 480 amino acids, of which 
the first 34 are predicted to constitute a typical mitochondrial leader peptide 
containing 6 positively charged arginine residues. The predicted human protein 
shows significant homology with core I protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
rather high homology (64% similarity, 46% identity) with the processing 
enhancing protein, which functions as core I protein in Neurospora crassa, and, 
surprisingly, highest homology with the small subunit of the mitochondrial 
processing peptidase of rat (74% similarity, 55% identity). The predicted human 
sequence is 87% identical to the reported bovine core I sequence predicted from 
cDNA cloning, up to residue 298, but the two predicted sequences are widely 
divergent after that point.
