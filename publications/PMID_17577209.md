HiNF-P is a recently identified histone H4 subtype specific transcriptional 
regulator that associates with the conserved cell cycle control element in the 
proximal promoter regions of histone H4 genes. HiNF-P interacts with the global 
histone gene regulator and direct cyclin E/CDK2 substrate p220(NPAT) to potently 
upregulate histone H4 gene transcription at the G1/S phase transition in 
response to cyclin E/CDK2 signaling. To gain insight into the function of HiNF-P 
in a broader cellular context, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to 
identify its novel interacting proteins. In this study, we detected 67 candidate 
HiNF-P interacting proteins of varying cellular functions. We have identified 
multiple RNA associated proteins, including the splicing co-factor SRm300. 
HiNF-P and SRm300 interact in yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and 
co-immunofluorescence assays. Our screen also identified several gene regulators 
that associate with HiNF-P including THAP7. HiNF-P and THAP7 interact in 
mammalian cells and THAP7 abrogates HiNF-P/p220 mediated activation of histone 
H4 gene transcription, consistent with its known role as a transcriptional 
repressor. Finally, we identified several proliferation related proteins 
including Ki-67 and X transactivated protein 2 (XTP2) which may be functioning 
with HiNF-P in cell cycle regulation. The HiNF-P interactome indicates that 
HiNF-P is a multifunctional gene regulator with a large functional network and 
roles beyond cell cycle-dependent histone gene regulation.
