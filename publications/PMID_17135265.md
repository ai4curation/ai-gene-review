The Ikaros gene is alternately spliced to generate multiple zinc finger proteins 
involved in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. Whereas murine studies 
have provided important information regarding the role of Ikaros in the mouse, 
little is known of Ikaros function in human. We report functional analyses of 
the two largest human Ikaros (hIK) isoforms, hIK-VI and hIK-H, in T cells. 
Abundant expression of hIK-H, the largest described isoform, is restricted to 
human hematopoietic cells. We find that the DNA binding affinity of hIK-H 
differs from that of hIK-VI. Co-expression of hIk-H with hIk-VI alters the 
ability of Ikaros complexes to bind DNA motifs found in pericentromeric 
heterochromatin (PC-HC). In the nucleus, hIK-VI is localized solely in PC-HC, 
whereas the hIK-H protein exhibits dual centromeric and non-centromeric 
localization. Mutational analysis defined the amino acids responsible for the 
distinct DNA binding ability of hIK-H, as well as the sequence required for the 
specific subcellular localization of this isoform. In proliferating cells, the 
binding of hIK-H to the upstream regulatory region of known Ikaros target genes 
correlates with their positive regulation by Ikaros. Results suggest that 
expression of hIK-H protein restricts affinity of Ikaros protein complexes 
toward specific PC-HC repeats. We propose a model, whereby the binding of 
hIK-H-deficient Ikaros complexes to the regulatory sequence of target genes 
would recruit these genes to the restrictive pericentromeric compartment, 
resulting in their repression. The presence of hIK-H in the Ikaros complex would 
alter its affinity for PC-HC, leading to chromatin remodeling and activation of 
target genes.
