BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is a critical component of many pathological 
conditions, and microRNAs (miRNAs) are indispensable in angiogenesis. It is 
unclear whether miRNAs regulate angiogenesis in the presence of high 
concentrations of uric acid (HUA), and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: It was found that HUA inhibited the angiogenic ability of 
endothelial cells. miRNA expression profiling was conducted using microarray 
assays in HUA-stimulated endothelial cells. Eighteen differentially expressed 
miRNAs were subjected to bioinformatic analyses. The results indicated that 
miR-92a was negatively regulated and was closely related to angiogenesis. 
Furthermore, the effects of miR-92a on HUA-stimulated endothelial cell 
angiogenesis and the underlying mechanisms were investigated in dual-luciferase 
reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoblot assays, and 
tube formation assays. It was determined that Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is a 
target gene of miR-92a, and KLF2 binds the vascular endothelial growth factor-A 
(VEGFA) promoter to inhibit its expression. miR-92a and VEGFA overexpression or 
KLF2 downregulation alleviates the HUA-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis in 
endothelial cells in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reported that there is a novel pathway regulating 
angiogenesis under HUA conditions. In the presence of HUA, miR-92a 
downregulation increased KLF2 expression, subsequently inhibiting VEGFA, which 
resulted in decreased angiogenesis. Thus, this study reports a possible 
mechanism for cardiovascular injury caused by hyperuricemia and suggests that 
the miR-92a-KLF2-VEGFA axis may be a target for hyperuricemia treatment.
