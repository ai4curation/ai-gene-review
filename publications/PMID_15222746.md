Bacteria isolated from organic mercury-contaminated sites have developed a 
system of two enzymes that allows them to efficiently convert both ionic and 
organic mercury compounds to the less toxic elemental mercury. Both enzymes are 
encoded on the mer operon and require sulfhydryl-bound substrates. The first 
enzyme is an organomercurial lyase (MerB), and the second enzyme is a mercuric 
ion reductase (MerA). MerB catalyzes the protonolysis of the carbon-mercury 
bond, resulting in the formation of a reduced carbon compound and inorganic 
ionic mercury. Of several mercury-containing MerB complexes that we attempted to 
prepare, the most stable was a complex consisting of the organomercurial lyase 
(MerB), a mercuric ion, and a molecule of the MerB inhibitor dithiothreitol 
(DTT). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and extended X-ray 
absorption fine structure spectroscopy of the MerB/Hg/DTT complex have shown 
that the ligands to the mercuric ion in the complex consist of both sulfurs from 
the DTT molecule and one cysteine ligand, C96, from the protein. The stability 
of the MerB/Hg/DTT complex, even in the presence of a large excess of competing 
cysteine, has been demonstrated by NMR and dialysis. We used an enzyme buffering 
test to determine that the MerB/Hg/DTT complex acts as a substrate for the 
mercuric reductase MerA. The observed MerA activity is higher than the expected 
activity assuming free diffusion of the mercuric ion from MerB to MerA. This 
suggests that the mercuric ion can be transferred between the two enzymes by a 
direct transfer mechanism.
