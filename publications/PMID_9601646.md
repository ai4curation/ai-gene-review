The decision between survival and death is an important aspect of cellular 
regulation during development and malignancy. Central to this regulation is the 
process of apoptosis, which is conserved in multicellular organisms [1]. A 
variety of signalling cascades have been implicated in modulation of apoptosis, 
including the phosphatidylinositol (Pl) 3-kinase pathway. Activation of Pl 
3-kinase is protective, and inhibition of this lipid kinase enhances cell death 
under several conditions including deregulated expression of c-Myc, neurotrophin 
withdrawal and anoikis [2-7]. Recently, the protective effects of Pl 3-kinase 
have been linked to its activation of the pleckstrin homology 
(PH)-domain-containing protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) [8]. PKB/AKT was identified 
from an oncogene, v-akt, found in a rodent T-cell lymphoma [9]. To initiate a 
genetic analysis of PKB, we have isolated and characterized a Drosophila PKB/AKT 
mutant (termed Dakt1) that exhibits ectopic apoptosis during embryogenesis as 
judged by induction of membrane blebbing, DNA fragmentation and macrophage 
infiltration. Apoptosis caused by loss of Dakt function is rescued by caspase 
suppression but is distinct from the previously described reaper/grim/hid 
functions. These data implicate Dakt1 as a cell survival gene in Drosophila, 
consistent with cell protection studies in mammals.
