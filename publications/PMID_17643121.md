Breast cancer-1 (BRCA1) participates in the DNA damage response. However, the 
mechanism by which BRCA1 is recruited to DNA damage sites remains elusive. 
Recently, we have demonstrated that a ubiquitin-binding protein, RAP80, is 
required for DNA damage-induced BRCA1 translocation. Here we identify another 
component, CCDC98, in the BRCA1-RAP80 complex. CCDC98 mediates BRCA1's 
association with RAP80. Moreover, CCDC98 controls both DNA damage-induced 
formation of BRCA1 foci and BRCA1-dependent G2/M checkpoint activation. 
Together, our results demonstrate that CCDC98 is a BRCA1 binding partner that 
mediates BRCA1 function in response to DNA damage.
