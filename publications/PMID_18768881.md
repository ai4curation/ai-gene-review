Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, also called efferocytosis, is an essential 
feature of immune responses and critical to resolution of inflammation. Impaired 
efferocytosis is associated with an unfavorable outcome from inflammatory 
diseases, including acute lung injury and pulmonary manifestations of cystic 
fibrosis. High mobility group protein-1 (HMGB1), a nuclear nonhistone 
DNA-binding protein, has recently been found to be secreted by immune cells upon 
stimulation with LPS and cytokines. Plasma and tissue levels of HMGB1 are 
elevated for prolonged periods in chronic and acute inflammatory conditions, 
including sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute lung injury, burns, and 
hemorrhage. In this study, we found that HMGB1 inhibits phagocytosis of 
apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages in vivo and in vitro. Phosphatidylserine 
(PS) is directly involved in the inhibition of phagocytosis by HMGB1, as 
blockade of HMGB1 by PS eliminates the effects of HMGB1 on efferocytosis. 
Confocal and fluorescence resonance energy transfer demonstrate that HMGB1 
interacts with PS on the neutrophil surface. However, HMGB1 does not inhibit 
PS-independent phagocytosis of viable neutrophils. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
from Scnn(+) mice, a murine model of cystic fibrosis lung disease which contains 
elevated concentrations of HMGB1, inhibits neutrophil efferocytosis. Anti-HMGB1 
Abs reverse the inhibitory effect of Scnn(+) bronchoalveolar lavage on 
efferocytosis, showing that this effect is due to HMGB1. These findings 
demonstrate that HMGB1 can modulate phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils and 
suggest an alternative mechanism by which HMGB1 is involved in enhancing 
inflammatory responses.
