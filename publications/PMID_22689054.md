Expression of clusterin (CLU) closely correlates with the regulation of 
apoptosis in cancer. Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced 
upregulation and retrotranslocation of cytoplasmic CLU (presecretory (psCLU) and 
secreted (sCLU) forms) has been linked to its anti-apoptotic properties, 
mechanisms mediating these processes remain undefined. Here, we show using human 
prostate cancer cells that GRP78 (Bip) associates with CLU under ER stress 
conditions to facilitate its retrotranslocation and redistribution to the 
mitochondria. Many ER stress inducers, including thapsigargin, MG132 or 
paclitaxel, increased expression levels of GRP78 and CLU, as well as 
post-translationally modified hypoglycosylated CLU forms. ER stress increased 
association between GRP78 and CLU, which led to increased cytoplasmic CLU 
levels, while reducing sCLU levels secreted into the culture media. GRP78 
stabilized CLU protein and its hypoglycosylated forms, in particular after 
paclitaxel treatment. Moreover, subcellular fractionation and confocal 
microscopy with CLUGFP indicated that GRP78 increased stress-induced CLU 
retrotranslocation from the ER with co-localized redistribution to the 
mitochondria, thereby reducing stress-induced apoptosis by cooperatively 
stabilizing mitochondrial membrane integrity. GRP78 silencing reduced CLU 
protein, but not mRNA levels, and enhanced paclitaxel-induced cell apoptosis. 
Taken together, these findings reveal novel dynamic interactions between GRP78 
and CLU under ER stress conditions that govern CLU trafficking and 
redistribution to the mitochondria, elucidating how GRP78 and CLU cooperatively 
promote survival during treatment stress in prostate cancer.
