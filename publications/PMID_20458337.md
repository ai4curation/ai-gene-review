Professional antigen-presenting cells secrete major histocompatibility complex 
class II (MHC II) carrying exosomes with unclear physiological function(s). 
Exosomes are first generated as the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of a specific 
type of multivesicular body, and are then secreted by fusion of this compartment 
with the plasma membrane. We have previously shown that in contrast to the 
sorting of MHC II at lysosomally targeted multivesicular bodies, sorting of MHC 
II into exosomes does not rely on MHC II ubiquitination. In search for proteins 
that drive the incorporation of MHC II into exosomes or functionally 
discriminate exosomal from plasma membrane MHC II, we first analyzed the total 
proteome of highly purified B cell-derived exosomes using sensitive and accurate 
mass spectrometry (MS), and identified 539 proteins, including known and not 
previously identified constituents. Using quantitative MS, we then identified a 
small subset of proteins that were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with MHC 
II from detergent-solubilized exosomes. These include HSC71, HSP90, 14-3-3É›, 
CD20 and pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2), and we speculate on the functionality 
of their interaction with exosomal MHC II.
