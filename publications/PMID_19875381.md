Structural studies of the chaperone HSP90 have revealed that nucleotide and drug 
ligands induce several distinct conformational states; however, little is known 
how these conformations affect interactions with co-chaperones and client 
proteins. Here we use tandem affinity purification and LC-MS/MS to investigate 
the proteome-wide effects of ATP, ADP, and geldanamycin on the constituents of 
the human HSP90 interactome. We identified 52 known and novel components of 
HSP90 complexes that are regulated by these ligands, including several 
co-chaperones. Interestingly, our results also show that geldanamycin treatment 
causes HSP90 complexes to become significantly enriched for core transcription 
machinery, suggesting that HSP90 inhibition may have broad based effects on 
transcription and RNA processing. We further characterized a novel ADP-dependent 
HSP90 interaction with the cysteine- and histidine-rich domain 
(CHORD)-containing protein CHORDC1. We show that this interaction is stimulated 
by high ADP:ATP ratios in cell lysates and in vitro with purified recombinant 
proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this interaction is dependent upon 
the ability of HSP90 to bind nucleotides and requires the presence of a linker 
region between the CHORD domains in CHORDC1. Together these findings suggest 
that the HSP90 interactome is dynamic with respect to nucleotide and drug 
ligands and that pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 may stimulate the formation 
of specific complexes.
