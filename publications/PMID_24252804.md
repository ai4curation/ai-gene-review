Oxidative stress plays an important role in the degeneration of dopaminergic 
neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Disruptions in the physiologic maintenance 
of the redox potential in neurons interfere with several biological processes, 
ultimately leading to cell death. Evidence has been developed for oxidative and 
nitrative damage to key cellular components in the PD substantia nigra. A number 
of sources and mechanisms for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
are recognized including the metabolism of dopamine itself, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, iron, neuroinflammatory cells, calcium, and aging. PD causing gene 
products including DJ-1, PINK1, parkin, alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 also impact in 
complex ways mitochondrial function leading to exacerbation of ROS generation 
and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Additionally, cellular homeostatic 
processes including the ubiquitin-proteasome system and mitophagy are impacted 
by oxidative stress. It is apparent that the interplay between these various 
mechanisms contributes to neurodegeneration in PD as a feed forward scenario 
where primary insults lead to oxidative stress, which damages key cellular 
pathogenetic proteins that in turn cause more ROS production. Animal models of 
PD have yielded some insights into the molecular pathways of neuronal 
degeneration and highlighted previously unknown mechanisms by which oxidative 
stress contributes to PD. However, therapeutic attempts to target the general 
state of oxidative stress in clinical trials have failed to demonstrate an 
impact on disease progression. Recent knowledge gained about the specific 
mechanisms related to PD gene products that modulate ROS production and the 
response of neurons to stress may provide targeted new approaches towards 
neuroprotection.
