The ADAM family consists of a number of transmembrane proteins that contain 
disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase-like domains. Therefore, ADAMs 
potentially have cell adhesion and protease activities. 14-3-3 proteins are a 
highly conserved family of cytoplasmic proteins that associate with several 
intracellular signaling molecules in the regulation of various cellular 
functions. Here we report the identification of a novel interaction between the 
ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail and the 14-3-3zeta isoform by a yeast two-hybrid 
screen. The interaction between the ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail and 14-3-3zeta was 
confirmed by an in vitro protein pull-down assay as well as by 
co-immunoprecipitation, and the binding sites were mapped to the 28 amino acid 
residues of the C-terminus of the ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail. Furthermore, we 
found that overexpression of the ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail in human SGH44 cells 
inhibited cell adhesion and spreading and that deletion or mutation of the 
binding site for 14-3-3zeta within the ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail abolished the 
ability of the overexpressed cytoplasmic tail to alter cell adhesion and 
spreading. Taken together, these results for the first time demonstrate an 
association between ADAM 22 and a 14-3-3 protein and suggest a potential role 
for the 14-3-3zeta/ADAM 22 association in the regulation of cell adhesion and 
related signaling events.
