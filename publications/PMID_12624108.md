Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of apoptosis. They can be 
pro-apoptotic (e.g. Bid, Bax, and Bak) or anti-apoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2 and 
Bcl-x(L)). The current study examined Bid-induced apoptosis and its inhibition 
by Bcl-2. Transfection of Bid led to apoptosis in HeLa cells. In these cells, 
Bid was processed into active forms of truncated Bid or tBid. Following 
processing, tBid translocated to the membrane-bound organellar fraction. Bcl-2 
co-transfection inhibited Bid-induced apoptosis but did not prevent Bid 
processing or tBid translocation. On the other hand, Bcl-2 blocked the release 
of mitochondrial cytochrome c in Bid-transfected cells, suggesting actions at 
the mitochondrial level. Alkaline treatment stripped off tBid from the 
membrane-bound organellar fraction of Bid plus Bcl-2-co-transfected cells, but 
not from cells transfected with only Bid, suggesting inhibition of tBid 
insertion into mitochondrial membranes by Bcl-2. Bcl-2 also prevented 
Bid-induced Bax translocation from cytosol to the membrane-bound organellar 
fraction. Finally, Bcl-2 diminished Bid-induced oligomerization of Bax and Bak 
within the membrane-bound organellar fraction, shown by cross-linking 
experiments. In conclusion, Bcl-2 inhibited Bid-induced apoptosis at the 
mitochondrial level by blocking cytochrome c release, without suppressing Bid 
processing or activation. Critical steps blocked by Bcl-2 included tBid 
insertion, Bax translocation, and Bax/Bak oligomerization in the mitochondrial 
membranes.
