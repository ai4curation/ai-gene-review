Abstract

A variety of chromatin remodeling complexes are thought to assist sequence-specific transcription factors. The complexes described to date are expressed ubiquitously, suggesting that they have general transcriptional functions. We show that vertebrate neurons have a specialized chromatin remodeling complex, bBAF, specifically containing the actin-related protein, BAF53b, which is first expressed in postmitotic neurons at about murine embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5). BAF53b is combinatorially assembled into polymorphic complexes with ubiquitous subunits including the two ATPases BRG1 and BRM. We speculate that bBAF complexes create neuronal-specific patterns of chromatin accessibility, thereby imparting new regulatory characteristics to ubiquitous sequence-specific transcription factors in neurons.

Discussion

We have shown that murine neurons have a specific chromatin remodeling complex (bBAF) based on the neuron-specific expression of BAF53b. bBAF is assembled with either BRG1 or BRM (which are expressed in all cell types) as the ATPase (Fig. 3 B). Since BAF60a, b, and c as well as BAF250a and b are present in neurons, we assume that the complex is combinatorially assembled with respect to the other subunits, as well. However, definitive demonstration of polymorphism for these other subunits may be very difficult because of the cellular heterogeneity of neurons. Combinatorial assembly appears to be unique to vertebrates, because Drosophila and C. elegans have only one gene encoding each subunit including BAF53 (Fig. 1 ), and Tamkun et al. found no evidence of combinatorial assembly of the Drosophila complex ( Papoulas et al. 1998 ). Analyses of the subunits present in bBAF suggest that these complexes are unique, distinguishing themselves from other mammalian SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complexes studied to date. The exclusive presence of BAF53b but not BAF53a (Fig. 2 B,C), substoichiometric levels of BAF155 (Figs. 2 C, 3 A), and the presence of two new putative subunits, p160 and p180, that are different from the polybromo BAF180 present in PBAF (Figs. 2 C, 3 C) support this notion.

Our studies indicate that BAF53b protein is first expressed in neuronal precursor cells that have become postmitotic (Fig. 5 ). Thus, BAF53b expression appears after the determination of the neuronal lineage, but close to the time when neurons become functionally distinct. Studies of neuron cell lineage specification in the vertebrate spinal cord have indicated that homeodomain and bHLH transcription factors play critical roles ( Tsuchida et al. 1994 ; Pfaff et al. 1996 ; Briscoe et al. 2000 ; for review, see Marquardt and Pfaff 2001 ). Although some of these transcription factors are expressed before the last cell cycle division of neurons (hence before BAF53b), others, such as the motor neuron specification transcription factor Islet-1, are expressed postmitotically ( Pfaff et al. 1996 ). The polymorphic bBAF complexes present in postmitotic vertebrate neurons (Fig. 5 C–G) have the capacity to remodel chromatin in vitro (Fig. 2 D) and may functionally cooperate in vivo with such postmitotic lineage specification transcription factors in accessing their regulatory targets.

The remarkable neuron-specific expression of BAF53b (Figs. 4 , 5 ), and therefore bBAF complexes, contrast with the expression patterns found for other proteins/complexes involved in chromatin regulation to date. The murine acetyltransferase Querkopf and its human homolog, MORF ( Champagne et al. 1999 ) have a wide pattern of expression during development. Consistent with this, Querkopf mutant mice show defects not only in neural but also in skeletal development ( Thomas et al. 2000 ). The histone deacetylase RPD3 is highly expressed in the Drosophila nervous system but widespread defects are seen in rpd3 mutant flies, consistent with its expression in other tissues ( De Rubertis et al. 1996 ; Chen et al. 1999 ; Mannervik and Levine 1999 ).

Certain subunits of the general transcription factor TFIID seem to have specialized functions, apparently arising from their restricted patterns of expression. For example, specific TBP-associated factors [TAF(II)s] have been found in B cells ( Dikstein et al. 1996 ), granulosa cells of the murine ovarian follicle ( Freiman et al. 2001 ), and in the male primary spermatocytes of Drosophila ( Hiller et al. 2001 ).

In the course of purifying and cloning the subunits of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes ( Khavari et al. 1993 ; Wang et al. 1996a , b ; Zhao et al. 1998 ), we searched extensively for tissue-specific subunits, and to date BAF53b is the only one that we and others have identified, raising the question of why neurons should have a dedicated chromatin remodeling complex. At least two possible answers can be suggested. The first is simply that bBAF is dedicated to the transcription of genes that distinguish neurons from other cell types, that is, those involved in processes such as axonal guidance and electrical excitability. A second possibility has to do with the very large number of cell types in the vertebrate nervous system, which may be equivalent to or exceed the number of all the other nonneuronal cell types ( Stevens 1998 ). Production of neural-specific chromatin remodeling complexes based on BAF53b rather than BAF53a could aid in establishing neural-specific chromatin structures, thereby broadly changing the genomic regulatory regions accessible to ubiquitous transcriptional factors in neurons. Such a restructuring of chromatin could impart neural patterns of expression to genes used both in neurons and nonneurons. Further diversification of bBAF complexes by combinatorial assembly could allow any single gene to gain new patterns of expression, thereby increasing the potential to generate new cell types within the neuronal lineage. Analysis of neuronal development in mice with disruptions of the BAF53b gene will be necessary to test these speculative models of bBAF chromatin remodeling complexes.
