The synaptic localization of molecular chaperones, heat shock cognate protein 70 
(Hsc70) and Hsp40, was investigated immunohistochemically in the normal rat 
brain. Postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions contained a constitutive form of 
HSP70, heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70 or p73) but not inducible form of 
HSP70 (p72). The immunoreactivities of Hsc70 (p73) were distributed throughout 
the rat brain, in neuronal somata, dendrites and axons. Their immunoreactivity 
in neurons was localized in the cytoplasmic matrix, dendrites, and spines at the 
electron microscopic level. Presynaptic terminals, but less frequently than 
postsynaptic staining, were also reactive. Postsynaptic areas immediately 
beneath the synaptic contact or PSDs were immunoreactive for Hsc70. The Hsp40 
was highly concentrated in PSD fractions. The staining of Hsp40 immunoreactivity 
was punctate and distributed widely in the brain. Hsp40 immunoreactivity was 
localized in dendritic spines, especially in the subsynaptic web, with weak 
staining of PSDs at the electron microscopic level. Double immunofluorescent 
staining and confocal microscopy revealed that Hsc70 and Hsp40 were co-localized 
on somata and neuronal processes of cultured cerebral neurons, on which 
synaptophysin immunoreactive spots were scattered. These results suggest that 
Hsp40 and Hsc70 are co-localized at postsynaptic sites and postsynaptic 
chaperone activity may be mediated by these two heat shock proteins.
