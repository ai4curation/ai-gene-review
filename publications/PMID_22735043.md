CDC-48/p97 is a AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) 
chaperone involved in protein conformational changes such as the disassembly of 
protein complexes. We previously reported that Caenorhabditis elegans CDC-48.1 
and CDC-48.2 (CDC-48s) are essential for the progression of meiosis I metaphase. 
Here, we report that CDC-48s are required for proper chromosome segregation 
during meiosis in C. elegans. In wild-type worms, at the diakinesis phase, 
phosphorylation of histone H3, one of the known substrates of aurora B kinase 
(AIR-2), on meiosis I chromatids correlated with AIR-2 localization at the 
cohesion sites of homologous chromatids. Conversely, depletion of CDC-48s 
resulted in a significant expansion of signals for AIR-2 and phosphorylated 
histone H3 over the entire length of meiotic chromosomes, leading to defective 
chromosome segregation, while the total amount of AIR-2 in lysates was not 
changed by the depletion of CDC-48s. The defective segregation of meiotic 
chromosomes caused by the depletion of CDC-48s was suppressed by the 
simultaneous depletion of AIR-2 and is similar to that observed following the 
depletion of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) phosphatases. However, the amount and 
localization of PP1 were not changed by the depletion of CDC-48s. These results 
suggest that CDC-48s control the restricted localization of AIR-2 to the 
cohesion sites of homologous chromatids in meiosis I.
