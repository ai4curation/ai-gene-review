Despite different embryological origins, islet beta-cells and neurons share the 
expression of many genes and display multiple functional similarities. One 
shared gene product, vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2, also known 
as SLC18A2), is highly expressed in human beta-cells relative to other cells in 
the endocrine and exocrine pancreas. Recent reports suggest that the monoamine 
dopamine is an important paracrine and/or autocrine regulator of insulin release 
by beta-cells. Given the important role of VMAT2 in the economy of monoamines 
such as dopamine, we investigated the possible role of VMAT2 in insulin 
secretion and glucose metabolism. Using a VMAT2-specific antagonist, 
tetrabenazine (TBZ), we studied glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion both in 
vivo and ex vivo in cultures of purified rodent islets. During intraperitoneal 
glucose tolerance tests, control rats showed increased serum insulin 
concentrations and smaller glucose excursions relative to controls after a 
single intravenous dose of TBZ. One hour following TBZ administration we 
observed a significant depletion of total pancreas dopamine. Correspondingly, 
exogenous L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine reversed the effects of TBZ on glucose 
clearance in vivo. In in vitro studies of rat islets, a significantly enhanced 
glucose-dependent insulin secretion was observed in the presence of 
dihydrotetrabenazine, the active metabolite of TBZ. Together, these data suggest 
that VMAT2 regulates in vivo glucose homeostasis and insulin production, most 
likely via its role in vesicular transport and storage of monoamines in 
beta-cells.
