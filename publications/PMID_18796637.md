B-box containing proteins play an important role in light signaling in plants. 
Here, we identify LIGHT-REGULATED ZINC FINGER1/SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG3 (STH3), a

signaling, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1). 
STH3 physically interacts with HY5 in vivo and shows a COP1-dependent

T-DNA insertion mutant, sth3, is hyposensitive to high fluence blue, red, and 
far-red light and has elongated hypocotyls under short days. Analyses of double 
mutants between sth3, sth2, and hy5 suggest that they have partially overlapping 
functions. Interestingly, functional assays in protoplasts suggest that STH3 can 
activate transcription both independently and together with STH2 through the 
G-box promoter element. Furthermore, sth3 suppresses the cop1 hypocotyl 
phenotype in the dark as well as the anthocyanin accumulation in the light. 
Finally, COP1 ubiquitinates STH3 in vitro, suggesting that STH3 is regulated by 
COP1. In conclusion, we have identified STH3 as a positive regulator of 
photomorphogenesis acting in concert with STH2 and HY5, while also being a

Abstract

B-box containing proteins play an important role in light signaling in plants. Here, we identify LIGHT-REGULATED ZINC FINGER1 / SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG3 ( STH3 ), a B-box encoding gene that genetically interacts with two key regulators of light signaling, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1). STH3 physically interacts with HY5 in vivo and shows a COP1-dependent localization to nuclear speckles when coexpressed with COP1 in plant cells. A T-DNA insertion mutant, sth3 , is hyposensitive to high fluence blue, red, and far-red light and has elongated hypocotyls under short days. Analyses of double mutants between sth3 , sth2 , and hy5 suggest that they have partially overlapping functions. Interestingly, functional assays in protoplasts suggest that STH3 can activate transcription both independently and together with STH2 through the G-box promoter element. Furthermore, sth3 suppresses the cop1 hypocotyl phenotype in the dark as well as the anthocyanin accumulation in the light. Finally, COP1 ubiquitinates STH3 in vitro, suggesting that STH3 is regulated by COP1. In conclusion, we have identified STH3 as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis acting in concert with STH2 and HY5, while also being a target of COP1-mediated ubiquitination.

INTRODUCTION

Besides providing the ultimate source of biological energy, light regulates key developmental processes throughout the plant life cycle. Photomorphogenesis is a developmental transition preceding and initiating adult development, when a seedling acquires photosynthetic capacity. Light perceived mainly by phytochromes (phyA and phyB) and cryptochromes (cry1 and cry2) regulates photomorphogenesis by inducing dramatic changes in the transcriptome of the seedling ( Ma et al., 2001 ; Jiao et al., 2007 ). It has been proposed that the photoreceptors initiate a transcriptional cascade by regulating a set of master transcription factors that in turn control the expression of multiple downstream genes ( Jiao et al., 2007 ).

Recent studies have shown that regulated proteolysis plays a pivotal role in light signaling. The CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC/DEETIOLATED/FUSCA (COP/DET/FUS) proteins act in a proteolytic pathway aimed at degrading photomorphogenesis promoting factors in the absence of light ( Osterlund et al., 2000a , 2000b ). Specifically, COP1 acts as a RING motifâ€“containing E3 ligase that ubiquitinates positive factors and targets them for degradation via the 26S proteosomal pathway ( Osterlund et al., 2000a , 2000b ; Holm et al., 2002 ; Seo et al., 2003 ; Yang et al., 2005 ). COP1 was also found to interact with several photoreceptors, such as phyA, cry1, and cry2 ( Wang et al., 2001 ; Yang et al., 2001 ; Shalitin et al., 2002 ; Seo et al., 2004 ), and can even target one of them for degradation, as in the case of phyA ( Seo et al., 2004 ), or regulate its abundance, as in cry2 ( Shalitin et al., 2002 ).

Molecular genetic approaches have identified several transcription factors acting downstream of the photoreceptors and/or being targets for the COP1 degradation. These transcription factors act downstream to a single or a combination of photoreceptors forming a light-regulated transcriptional network. However, some of these factors receive inputs also from circadian, stress, and/or hormonal signals, thus creating signal integration points for a complex set of regulatory circuits. Photomorphogenesis involves transcription factors belonging to a range of families. Members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family play a central role in phytochrome-mediated signal transduction ( Duek and Fankhauser, 2005 ). PIF3 (for Phytochrome Interacting Factor 3) was the first member of the bHLH family interacting specifically with activated phyA and phyB ( Ni et al., 1999 ). Interestingly, while PIF3 undergoes phytochrome-mediated phosphorylation followed by ubiquitin-mediated degradation, it can in turn regulate PhyB protein abundance during long-term continuous red (Rc) irradiation, suggesting reciprocal interactions between photoreceptors and transcriptional regulators ( Park et al., 2004 ; Al-Sady et al., 2006 , 2008 ). Other bHLH proteins, PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7, act as negative regulators of PhyB signaling under prolonged Rc, while PIF1 negatively regulates seed germination and chlorophyll synthesis ( Huq and Quail, 2002 ; Fujimori et al., 2004 ; Huq et al., 2004 ; Leivar et al., 2008 ). LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1) is an atypical member of this family playing a positive role in both phyA and cryptocrome-mediated signaling as indicated by the hyposensitive phenotype of the hfr1 mutant under far-red and blue light ( Fairchild et al., 2000 ; Duek and Fankhauser, 2003 ). On the other hand, MYC2 acts as a repressor of blue and far-red light-mediated deetiolation ( Yadav et al., 2005 ). Members of other transcription factors families involved in this network include LAF1, belonging to the R2R3-MYB family ( Ballesteros et al., 2001 ), the Dof family transcription factors COG1 and OBP3, and several members of the bZIP transcription factor family, such as ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), HYH, and GBF1 ( Oyama et al., 1997 ; Holm et al., 2002 ; Park et al., 2003 ; Ward et al., 2005 ; Mallappa et al., 2006 ).

HY5 was the first protein shown to be a target of COP1 regulation. The fact that the hy5 mutant has elongated hypocotyls under all light conditions suggests that HY5 acts downstream to all the photoreceptors ( Lee et al., 2007 ). Recently, a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation technique where DNA chip hybridization on a microarray was used to detect precipitated DNA revealed >3000 in vivo HY5 targets in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. The class of HY5 binding targets was enriched in light-responsive genes and transcription factor genes ( Lee et al., 2007 ), suggesting that HY5 is a high hierarchical regulator of the transcriptional cascades for photomorphogenesis. Mutation in the HY5 gene also causes defects in lateral root formation, secondary thickening in roots, and chlorophyll and anthocyanin accumulation ( Oyama et al., 1997 ; Holm et al., 2002 ). In addition, recent studies showed the involvement of HY5 in both auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways ( Cluis et al., 2004 ; Sibout et al., 2006 ; Vandenbussche et al., 2007 ), suggesting that HY5 might be a common intermediate in light and hormone signaling pathways. However, while HY5 was found to bind to a large number of promoters, this binding is not sufficient for transcriptional activation, suggesting that HY5 requires additional cofactors for regulation ( Lee et al., 2007 ).

In addition, several proteins containing N-terminal zinc binding B-boxes have been shown to act as transcriptional regulators in response to light and circadian cues. These include CONSTANS (CO), which regulates the expression of the flowering time gene FT , CONSTANS-LIKE3 (COL3), and SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG2 (STH2) ( Putterill et al., 1995 ; Datta et al., 2006 , 2007 ). All three of these genes also interact genetically with COP1 . While co-10 can suppress the early flowering of cop1-4 in both long- and short-day conditions ( Jang et al., 2008 ), col3 and sth2 can suppress the hypocotyl phenotype in dark-grown cop1 seedlings ( Datta et al., 2006 , 2007 ). Interestingly, COP1 was recently shown to degrade CO in the dark, thus shaping the temporal pattern of CO accumulation and its effect on photoperiodic flowering ( Jang et al., 2008 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). Both CO and COL3 also contain a C-terminal CCT (for CO, CO-LIKE, TOC) domain that shows similarity to the HAP2 subunit of the CCAAT box binding complex, suggesting that they might bind to DNA directly ( Wenkel et al., 2006 ). STH2 lacks a CCT domain and has the tandem repeated B-boxes as its only discernable conserved domains. The B-boxes in STH2 are required both for the ability of STH2 to activate transcription and for its ability to physically interact with HY5, whereas the B-boxes in COL3 were found to be important for localization of the protein into nuclear speckles ( Datta et al., 2006 , 2007 ).

Recently, a homolog of STH2, LIGHT-REGULATED ZINC FINGER1 (LZF1)/STH3, was identified as a gene transcriptionally regulated by HY5 ( Chang et al., 2008 ). LZF1/STH3 was found to act as a positive regulator of deetiolation affecting both anthocyanin accumulation and chloroplast biogenesis ( Chang et al., 2008 ). Here, we further examine the function of STH3 and report that LZF1/STH3 can physically interact with HY5. Furthermore, STH3 genetically interacts with both HY5 and COP1 . Characterization of an sth3 mutant indicates that STH3 positively regulates light-mediated development primarily independently of HY5 . Genetic and functional data suggest that STH3 and STH2 function synergistically to activate transcription and regulate light-dependent development. In vitro ubiquitination data suggest that STH3 is ubiquitinated by COP1. In summary, the B-box protein STH3 positively regulates photomorphogenesis both independently and in concert with HY5 and STH2, while at the same time is targeted for proteolysis by the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1.

DISCUSSION

This study identifies STH3/LZF1 as a protein that acts in close proximity to STH2 and HY5 to regulate light-dependent development in Arabidopsis . We found that STH3 localizes to nuclear speckles in a COP1-dependent manner, that sth3 acts as a genetic suppressor of cop1 , and that COP1 can ubiquitinate STH3 in vitro. These results strongly suggest that STH3 acts in the same regulatory pathway as COP1, HY5, and STH2. However, the subtle phenotypes in the sth3 single mutant coupled with the finding that sth3 enhanced the phenotypes in both hy5 and sth2 mutants suggest that STH3 plays an overlapping and partially independent role compared with HY5 and STH2.

Yeast Two-Hybrid Methods and FRET Experiments

The yeast strain Y187 was used for the two-hybrid assays, and the Î²-galactosidase assays were performed as described by Holm et al. (2001) . For the FRET acceptor photobleaching experiments, the pAM-PAT-35SS-YFP-HY5, pAM-PAT-35SS-CFP-STH3, and the pRTL2-COP1 overexpression constructs were introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment and incubated, and live cell images were acquired using an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with an LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss). Cells were visualized 20 h after particle bombardment using the confocal microscope through a Plan-Neofluor 403/1.3 oil (differential interference contrast) objective. The multitracking mode was used to eliminate spillover between fluorescence channels. The CFP was excited by a laser diode 405 laser and the YFP by an argon-ion laser, both at low intensities. Regions of interest were selected and bleached with 100 iterations using the argon-ion laser at 100%.
