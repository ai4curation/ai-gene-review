Mutations in the SFTPC gene associated with interstitial lung disease in human 
patients result in misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention, and

were significantly elevated and exhibited prolonged and specific association 
with the misfolded proprotein; in contrast, ERdj3 interacted with BiP, but it 
did not associate with either wild-type or mutant SP-C. Misfolded SP-C, ERdj4, 
and ERdj5 coprecipitated with p97/VCP indicating that the cochaperones remain 
associated with the misfolded proprotein until it is dislocated to the cytosol. 
Knockdown of ERdj4 and ERdj5 expression increased ER retention and inhibited 
degradation of misfolded SP-C, but it had little effect on the wild-type 
protein. Transient expression of ERdj4 and ERdj5 in X-box binding protein 1(-/-) 
mouse embryonic fibroblasts substantially restored rapid degradation of mutant 
SP-C proprotein, whereas transfection of HPD mutants failed to rescue SP-C 
endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. ERdj4 and ERdj5 promote 
turnover of misfolded SP-C and this activity is dependent on their ability to 
stimulate BiP ATPase activity.

Abstract

Mutations in the SFTPC gene associated with interstitial lung disease in human patients result in misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention, and degradation of the encoded surfactant protein C (SP-C) proprotein. In this study, genes specifically induced in response to transient expression of two disease-associated mutations were identified by microarray analyses. Immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) and two heat shock protein 40 family members, endoplasmic reticulum-localized DnaJ homologues ERdj4 and ERdj5, were significantly elevated and exhibited prolonged and specific association with the misfolded proprotein; in contrast, ERdj3 interacted with BiP, but it did not associate with either wild-type or mutant SP-C. Misfolded SP-C, ERdj4, and ERdj5 coprecipitated with p97/VCP indicating that the cochaperones remain associated with the misfolded proprotein until it is dislocated to the cytosol. Knockdown of ERdj4 and ERdj5 expression increased ER retention and inhibited degradation of misfolded SP-C, but it had little effect on the wild-type protein. Transient expression of ERdj4 and ERdj5 in X-box binding protein 1 −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts substantially restored rapid degradation of mutant SP-C proprotein, whereas transfection of HPD mutants failed to rescue SP-C endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. ERdj4 and ERdj5 promote turnover of misfolded SP-C and this activity is dependent on their ability to stimulate BiP ATPase activity.

INTRODUCTION

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a highly dynamic molecular pathway that rapidly adjusts protein synthesis, chaperone-mediated protein folding, and degradation of misfolded protein clients in response to stress. Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is monitored by three membrane proteins, PERK, activating transcription factor (ATF)-6, and IRE-1, that transduce signals to the cytosolic and nuclear compartments to relieve ER stress ( Zhang and Kaufman, 2004 ; Schroder and Kaufman, 2005 ). The cytosolic domain of PERK is a kinase that, when activated, phosphorylates the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, leading to a general, transient translational arrest, thereby preventing further accumulation of protein in the ER. Activation of ATF-6 results in cleavage of the cytosolic domain that encodes a leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-6n; nuclear translocation of ATF-6n leads to increased expression of chaperones that enhance the folding capacity of the ER. The activated cytosolic domain of IRE-1 encodes a ribonuclease activity that removes an unspliced intron from the mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP-1. Translation of active XBP-1 results in further up-regulation of chaperone expression and components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery and secretory pathway. Failure to reestablish ER homeostasis results in selective translation of ATF4, leading to apoptosis.

ERAD in yeast involves multiple pathways that monitor folding of protein domains in the ER lumen (ERAD-L), membrane (ERAD-M), and cytosol (ERAD-C) ( Meusser et al. , 2005 ; Sayeed and Ng, 2005 ; Bukau et al. , 2006 ). Terminally misfolded proteins are identified and targeted for dislocation to the cytosol and degradation by the proteasome. A major challenge for the quality-control machinery is discrimination between unfolded proteins that will eventually fold correctly and terminally misfolded proteins that are potentially cytotoxic and must be rapidly degraded. The quality-control checkpoints encountered by a newly synthesized protein depend upon the topology of substrate with respect to the ER membrane. The membrane protein CFTR has relatively large cytosolic domains that are monitored by at least two checkpoints located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane ( Younger et al. , 2006 ). Lumenal proteins and membrane proteins with relatively large lumenal domains are monitored by quality-control machinery located in the ER lumen ( Huyer et al. , 2004 ; Vashist and Ng, 2004 ). The glycosylation status of these proteins provides cues as to the progression of folding ( Molinari et al. , 2003 ; Oda et al. , 2003 ; Bhamidipati et al. , 2005 ; Szathmary et al. , 2005 ). ER-degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase like protein (EDEM), an XBP-1 target gene encoding a lectin, detects inappropriately trimmed glycans and redirects the misfolded glycoprotein from the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle to the degradation pathway. In yeast, the lectin Yos9p, Kar2p (immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein [BiP]) and Hrd3p form a complex that identifies misfolded lumenal glycoproteins leading to ubiquitination by Hrd1p ( Carvalho et al. , 2006 ; Denic et al. , 2006 ). A similar pathway was recently described for mammalian ERAD in which sel-1 suppressor of lin-12-like (SEL1L)/Hrd3-mediated interaction of OS9 and its glycosylated substrate with Hrd1 ( Christianson et al. , 2008 ).

Molecular mechanisms governing quality control of nonglycosylated proteins, particularly mammalian substrates, is less well understood. Nonglycosylated variants of CFTR and α1-antitrypsin were degraded considerably faster than the corresponding glycosylated forms ( Farinha and Amaral, 2005 ; Mast et al. , 2005 ); similarly, disruption of glucose trimming of tyrosinase, leading to formation of a triglycosylated form that could not interact with calnexin, resulted in rapid degradation ( Svedine et al. , 2004 ). Importantly, several nonglycosylated, soluble ERAD client proteins were recently shown to be degraded by a pathway with a molecular signature distinct from that of glycosylated substrates ( Okuda-Shimizu and Hendershot, 2007 ). The present study was undertaken to assess quality control of a nonglycosylated, disease-associated, integral membrane protein, surfactant protein C (SP-C).

Human SP-C is synthesized as a proprotein with a single membrane-spanning domain, a 35 amino acid cytosolic domain and a lumenal domain of 133 or 139 amino acids, depending on which allele is expressed ( Nogee, 2004 ). Proteolytic processing of the proprotein within the late endosome/multivesicular body generates the 35 amino acid mature form of SP-C, consisting of the transmembrane domain and 12 amino acids of the cytosolic domain, that is secreted into the alveolar airspaces with surfactant membranes ( Johansson et al. , 2004 ). Mutations in one allele of the SP-C gene ( SFTPC ) have been associated with the occurrence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in human patients ( Nogee et al. , 2001 , 2002 ). To determine whether SFTPC mutations caused lung disease, a mutation associated with ILD in human patients was expressed in type II epithelial cells of transgenic mice ( Bridges et al. , 2003 ). Elevated transgene expression was associated with dose-dependent epithelial cell death and disruption of epithelial-mesenchymal cell signaling, leading to hypoplastic lungs and neonatal death. Dysmorphogenesis occurred in the presence of two wild-type mouse Sftpc alleles, consistent with a dominant, cytotoxic effect of the transgene. Transient expression of SP-C Δexon4 in A549, human embryonic kidney (HEK)293, or MLE-15 cells resulted in retention of misfolded SP-C proprotein in the ER and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptosis pathways ( Bridges et al. , 2003 ; Wang et al. , 2003 ; Mulugeta et al. , 2005 , 2007 ). Inhibition of proteasome resulted in accumulation of proprotein in the ER, indicating that misfolded SP-C was a substrate for the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.

All but one of the SFTPC mutations associated with ILD occur in the region encoding the lumenal domain, implicating lumenal chaperones in the recognition and degradation of misfolded SP-C proprotein. Using microarray analyses, we identified genes specifically induced in response to expression of two terminally misfolded variants of SP-C. We show that two BiP cochaperones, endoplasmic reticulum-localized DnaJ homologues ERdj4 and ERdj5, play an essential role in ERAD of this nonglycosylated substrate.

DISCUSSION

In the current study, a surprisingly large number of genes (7.8%; Supplemental Figure S1A) were significantly induced in response to transient expression of two different SP-C mutants associated with interstitial lung disease; in contrast, expression of only 11 genes was suppressed. This finding is remarkably similar to the results of a study in yeast, in which tunicamycin- or DTT-induced ER stress increased expression of ∼6% of the yeast genome with very little gene repression ( Travers et al. , 2000 ), and a recent study in which XBP-1 was reported to be an activator of expression ( Acosta-Alvear et al. , 2007 ). To identify genes specifically involved in the recognition and degradation of misfolded SP-C, we searched for potential XBP-1 target genes, because this transcription factor modulates expression of several key genes in the ERAD pathway. Analysis of the 5′-flanking sequence of genes induced by mutant SP-C identified >1000 genes with at least one TGACGTGR motif (UPRE) associated with XBP-1 binding ( Clauss et al. , 1996 ; Yoshida et al. , 2001 ; Kanemoto et al. , 2005 ; Acosta-Alvear et al. , 2007 ; Shen and Hendershot, 2007 ); interrogation with other recently identified XBP-1 binding motifs would likely increase this pool ( Acosta-Alvear et al. , 2007 ). Genes encoding ER proteins were identified by database annotation, and the number of candidate genes was subsequently increased by literature search and use of algorithms predicting ER localization. This approach identified several genes that were previously shown to encode XBP-1 targets, including p58 IPK /DNAJC3, ERdj4/DNAJB9, ERdj5/DNAJC10, ERdj3/HEDJ, EDEM, PDIA4/ERP70, PDIA6/PDI-P5, PDIR, and RAMP4/SERP1 ( Lee et al. , 2003 ; Shaffer et al. , 2004 ). Thus, ectopic expression of a lung-specific, mutant, nonglycosylated, membrane protein (SP-C Δexon4 or SP-C L188Q ) in embryonic kidney cells induced a subset of genes that was also associated with ER stress induced by tunicamycin or DTT.

Among ER-localized HSP40 family members, ERdj4 and ERdj5 were increased to the greatest extent in response to mutant SP-C expression. Interestingly, p58 IPK , a DnaJ protein recently reported to be localized to the ER lumen ( Rutkowski et al. , 2007 ), was also robustly increased in cells expressing mutant SP-C ( Table 1 ), suggesting that it may also be involved in ERAD of SP-C. BiP, ERdj4, and ERdj5 coprecipitated with misfolded SP-C and remained associated with the substrate until it was retrotranslocated to the cytosol. Inhibition of ERdj4 and ERdj5 expression resulted in ER retention and accumulation of misfolded SP-C. Inhibition of ERdj4 and ERdj5 did produce a minor increase in the amount of wild-type proprotein; however, this effect is consistent with ERAD-mediated turnover of a small amount of unfolded/misfolded wild-type protein, as reported for many newly synthesized proteins ( Schubert et al. , 2000 ; Rutkowski et al. , 2006 ). Furthermore, in pulse-chase experiments, ERdj4 immunoprecipitated with mutant SP-C but not the wild-type proprotein. Expression of another ER-localized DnaJ homologue, ERdj3, was also modestly increased (1.9×) in cells expressing mutant SP-C ( Table 1 ). ERdj3 was shown previously to be robustly increased in response to treatment with the ER stress-inducing agents tunicamycin or thapsigargin, associated with both unfolded and mutant protein substrates ( Shen and Hendershot, 2005 ), and it was identified as a direct target of spliced XBP-1 ( Kanemoto et al. , 2005 ; Shen and Hendershot, 2007 ). However, ERdj3 did not associate with either WT or mutant SP-C (Supplemental Figure S5). Together, these results suggest that BiP and its cochaperones, ERdj4 and ERdj5, are part of a quality control complex that selectively detects and targets misfolded SP-C for elimination via ERAD. The observation that ERdj4 and ERdj5 associated with BiP and p97 independently of misfolded SP-C suggests that this complex may be “primed” for rapid association with misfolded/unfolded substrates; alternatively, Bip/ERdj/p97 association may be driven in part by ER stress arising from transient overexpression of ERdj4 and ERdj5 (Supplemental Figure S3E).

ERdj4 is type II DnaJ protein that contains a short cytosolic domain, a single membrane spanning domain and a lumenal juxtamembrane J domain followed by a C-terminal glycine/phenylalanine-rich region ( Shen et al. , 2002 ). In the present study, deletion of the J domain abrogated interaction of ERdj4 with BiP but not with misfolded SP-C; in fact, interaction of misfolded SP-C with ERdj4 was consistently enhanced by deletion of the J domain or mutation of the HPD motif. This finding is similar to that reported for interaction of ERdj3 with unfolded substrates ( Shen and Hendershot, 2005 ) and suggests that the C-terminal domain containing the Gly/Phe-rich region may bind unfolded/misfolded substrate directly. This hypothesis is also supported by the observation that yeast Sis1p directly binds substrate through its C-terminal domain and suggests that type II DnaJ proteins may have chaperone activity independently of BiP ( Lu and Cyr, 1998 ). Although ERdj3 was also increased in cells expressing mutant SP-C, knockdown of ERdj4 resulted in accumulation of misfolded protein, indicating that endogenous ERdj3 could not compensate for loss of ERdj4.

ERdj5 (DNAJC10/JPDI) is an ER-resident lumenal protein with a canonical C-terminal KDEL retrieval motif, a J domain, and four thioredoxin-like domains ( Cunnea et al. , 2003 ; Hosoda et al. , 2003 ). Deletion of the J domain prevented interaction of ERdj5 with both BiP and misfolded SP-C, suggesting that association of ERdj5 with substrate was mediated by BiP. Surprisingly, mutation of the HPD motif significantly enhanced association of ERdj5 with misfolded SP-C (Supplemental Figure S2A). Further analyses revealed that, in contrast to results of a previous study ( Hosoda et al. , 2003 ), the HPD mutation did not alter association of ERdj5 (or ERdj4) with BiP (Supplemental Figure S2C). Therefore, stable complexes of misfolded SP-C, BiP, and ERdj5 formed in the absence of the catalytic activity of ERdj5. Complex formation would presumably bring the thioredoxin-like domains of ERdj5 into contact with misfolded SP-C. In this context ERdj5 may function similarly to PDI, promoting the formation, reduction or isomerization of disulfide bonds. PDI was reported to play an important role in disulfide bond reduction (unfoldase activity) before dislocation of misfolded protein ( Tsai et al. , 2001 ). The failure of two previous studies to detect ERdj5 oxidoreductase activity in vitro ( Cunnea et al. , 2003 ; Hosoda et al. , 2003 ) may reflect the substrate specificity of ERdj5 or the requirement of a partner protein(s), such as BiP, for unfoldase activity. Alternatively, ERdj5 may act as a redox sensor to identify proteins with unpaired/mispaired cysteines and target them for elimination via ERAD.

In addition to mutant SP-C, another disease-linked mutant protein, insulin 2 C96Y , formed complexes with ERdj4, ERdj5, and p97. Unexpectedly, ERdj4 and ERdj5 also formed a complex with WT insulin 2 and p97. Knockdown of ERdj4 and ERdj5 slowed degradation of both WT and mutant insulin 2. Thus, ERdj4 and ERdj5 are likely part of a larger lumenal quality control complex that targets unstable/misfolded proteins for dislocation and degradation by proteasome.

Okuda-Shimizu and Hendershot (2007) recently showed that three separate BiP-bound, nonglycosylated ERAD substrates coprecipitated with derlin-1, Herp, Hrdl, and p97. Herp played an important role in facilitating retrotranslocation and degradation of these proteins; in contrast, Herp was not required for ERAD of misfolded α1-antitrypsin, consistent with separate retrotranslocation pathways for the glycosylated and nonglycosylated ERAD substrates used in this study. Interestingly, expression of Herp was elevated 3.3- and 3.4-fold in cells expressing SP-C Δexon4 and SP-C L188Q , respectively ( Table 1 ). Although it is not yet clear whether Herp is required for retrotranslocation of SP-C, degradation was clearly dependent on association with ERdj4 and ERdj5. A similar requirement for DnaJ association was described previously for BiP-bound ERAD substrates ( Nishikawa et al. , 2001 ). It is possible that the major function of ERdj4 and ERdj5 is simply to facilitate solubility of misfolded proteins by modulating the activity of BiP. However, the apparent direct interaction of ERdj4 with misfolded SP-C and the presence of multiple thioredoxin-like domains in ERdj5 suggest a larger role in quality control that could include recognition and/or targeting of misfolded SP-C to the retrotranslocation apparatus.
