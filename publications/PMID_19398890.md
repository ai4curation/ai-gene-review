Autophagy is a highly conserved degradation pathway for intracellular 
macromolecules and organelles. Among those characterized autophagy regulators, 
the ubiquitin-like protein Atg8 is found to be a membrane modifier that both 
regulates biogenesis of transport vesicles and interacts with the cargo receptor 
Atg19 for selective autophagic transport of the vacuolar enzyme prApe1 in 
budding yeast. The role of Atg8 in the enlargement of vesicle membrane during 
autophagosome biogenesis has been well documented,but how Atg8 coordinates 
vesicle formation and sorting of selective cargo is largely unknown. 
Identification of the cargo-receptor binding site of Atg8 would provide 
information to solve this issue.Here we characterized Atg8 mutants that were 
defective in interaction with the prApe1 receptor Atg19 and found that the 
vesicle formation function of these Atg8 mutants was also compromised to 
different extents. Atg8 mutants with single-residue substitution at the 
Atg19-binding site were defective in lipid conjugation and/or subcellular 
localization. Additional Atg8 mutants were found defective in autophagosome 
formation without affecting their interaction with Atg19, suggesting partially 
overlapping of the cargo-sorting site and its domains critical for autophagy 
control. Our observation paves the road for a more comprehensive understanding 
on how Atg8 coordinates cargo sorting and vesicle formation in selective 
autophagic pathways.
