The early emergence of macrophages and their large pattern of tissue 
distribution during development suggest that they may play a critical role in 
the initial steps of embryogenesis. In the present study, we show that monocytic 
cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and from fetal liver 
follow a differentiation pathway different to that of adult cells, leading to 
specific functions. Embryonic and fetal monocytic cells differentiated from a 
CD14(low)CD16(-) precursor to form CD14(high)CD16(+) cells without producing the 
CD14(high)CD16(-) cell population that predominates in adult peripheral blood. 
Both demonstrated an enhanced expression of genes encoding tissue-degrading 
enzymes, chemokines, and scavenger receptors, as was previously reported for M2 
macrophages. Compared with adult blood monocytes, embryonic and fetal monocytic 
cells secreted high amounts of proteins acting on tissue remodeling and 
angiogenesis, and most of them expressed the Tie2 receptor. Furthermore, they 
promoted vascular remodeling in xenotransplanted human tumors. These findings 
suggest that the regulation of human fetal and embryonic monocytic cell 
differentiation leads to the generation of cells endowed mainly with 
anti-inflammatory and remodeling functions. Trophic and immunosuppressive 
functions of M2-polarized macrophages link fetus and tumor development, and 
hESCs offer a valuable experimental model for in vitro studies of mechanisms 
sustaining these processes.
