The existence and function of actin in the nucleus has been hotly debated for 
forty years. Recently, beta-actin was found to be a component of mammalian 
SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin remodeling complexes and still more recently other 
SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complexes in yeast, flies, and man. 
Although the function of actin in these chromatin remodeling complexes is only 
starting to be explored, the fact that actin is one of the most regulated 
proteins in the cell suggests that control of nuclear actin may be a critical 
regulatory point in the control of chromatin remodeling. Actin rapidly shuttles 
between the nucleus and the cytoplasm offering additional sites and modes of 
regulation. In addition, actin-related proteins (Arps) are also components of 
these chromatin remodeling complexes and have been implicated in transcriptional 
control in yeast. The observation that the BAF chromatin remodeling complex in 
which actin was originally identified, is also a human tumor suppressor complex 
necessary for the actions of the retinoblastoma protein indicates that the study 
of nuclear actin is likely to contribute to understanding cell growth control.
