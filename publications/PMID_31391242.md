The muscle-specific RING-finger protein MuRF1 (also known as TRIM63) constitutes 
a bona fide ubiquitin ligase that routes proteins like several different myosin 
heavy chain proteins (MyHC) to proteasomal degradation during muscle atrophy. In 
two unbiased screens, we identified DCAF8 as a new MuRF1-binding partner. MuRF1 
physically interacts with DCAF8 and both proteins localize to overlapping 
structures in muscle cells. Importantly, similar to what is seen for MuRF1, 
DCAF8 levels increase during atrophy, and the downregulation of either protein 
substantially impedes muscle wasting and MyHC degradation in C2C12 myotubes, a 
model system for muscle differentiation and atrophy. DCAF proteins typically 
serve as substrate receptors for cullin 4-type (Cul4) ubiquitin ligases (CRL), 
and we demonstrate that DCAF8 and MuRF1 associate with the subunits of such a 
protein complex. Because genetic downregulation of DCAF8 and inhibition of 
cullin activity also impair myotube atrophy in C2C12 cells, our data imply that 
the DCAF8 promotes muscle wasting by targeting proteins like MyHC as an integral 
substrate receptor of a Cul4A-containing ring ubiquitin ligase complex 
(CRL4A).This article has an associated First Person interview with the first 
author of the paper.
