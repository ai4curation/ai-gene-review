The G protein beta gamma-dimer is required for receptor interaction and effector 
regulation. However, previous approaches have not identified the physiologic 
roles of individual subtypes in these processes. We used a gene knockout 
approach to demonstrate a unique role for the G protein gamma(7)-subunit in 
mice. Notably, deletion of Gng7 caused behavioral changes that were associated 
with reductions in the alpha(olf)-subunit content and adenylyl cyclase activity 
of the striatum. These data demonstrate that an individual gamma-subunit 
contributes to the specificity of a given signaling pathway and controls the 
formation or stability of a particular G protein heterotrimer.
