Here we studied the cellular mechanisms of ursolic acid's anti-bladder cancer 
ability by focusing on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) signaling. We 
show that ursolic acid induces a significant ER stress response in cultured 
human bladder cancer T24 cells. ER stress inhibitor salubrinal, or PERK 
silencing, diminishes ursolic acid-induced anti-T24 cell effects. Salubrinal 
inhibits ursolic acid-induced CHOP expression, Bim ER accumulation and caspase-3 
activation in T24 cells. Ursolic acid induces IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 signaling complex 
formation to activate pro-apoptotic ASK1-JNK signaling. We suggest that ER 
stress contributes to ursolic acid's effects against bladder cancer cells.
