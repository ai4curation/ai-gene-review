A significant amount of nuclear p53 is found associated with the nuclear matrix 
in cells that were exposed to genotoxic stress. In this study we identified 
Scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1), a nuclear matrix-associated protein that 
binds the scaffold or matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) of genomic DNA, as a 
novel p53-interacting protein. SAFB1 was able to associate with p53 through its 
C-terminal domain, while significant co-localization of the two proteins was 
observed in cells treated with 5-fluorouracil or mithramycin. Binding of p53 to 
SAFB1 had a significant functional outcome, since SAFB1 was shown to suppress 
p53-mediated reporter gene expression. These data suggest that nuclear 
matrix-associated proteins may play a critical role in regulating p53 
localization and activity.
