Abelson (Abl) family tyrosine kinases have been implicated in cell 
morphogenesis, adhesion, motility, and oncogenesis. Using a candidate approach 
for genes involved in planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, we identified 
Drosophila Abl (dAbl) as a modulator of Frizzled(Fz)/PCP signaling. We 
demonstrate that dAbl positively regulates the Fz/Dishevelled (Dsh) PCP pathway 
without affecting canonical Wnt/Wg-Fz signaling. Genetic dissection suggests 
that Abl functions via Fz/Dsh signaling in photoreceptor R3 specification, a 
well-established Fz-PCP signaling readout. Molecular analysis shows that dAbl 
binds and phosphorylates Dsh on Tyr473 within the DEP domain. This 
phosphorylation event on Dsh is functionally critical, as the equivalent 
DshY473F mutant is nonfunctional in PCP signaling and stable membrane 
association, although it rescues canonical Wnt signaling. Strikingly, mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for Abl1 and Abl2/Arg genes also show 
reduced Dvl2 phosphorylation as compared with control MEFs, and this correlates 
with a change in subcellular localization of endogenous Dvl2. As in Drosophila, 
such Abl-deficient MEFs show no change in canonical Wnt signaling. Taken 
together, our results argue for a conserved role of Abl family members in the 
positive regulation of Dsh activity toward Fz-Dsh/PCP signaling by Dsh 
phosphorylation.

Abstract

Abelson (Abl) family tyrosine kinases have been implicated in cell morphogenesis, adhesion, motility, and oncogenesis. Using a candidate approach for genes involved in planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, we identified Drosophila Abl (dAbl) as a modulator of Frizzled(Fz)/PCP signaling. We demonstrate that dAbl positively regulates the Fz/Dishevelled (Dsh) PCP pathway without affecting canonical Wnt/Wg–Fz signaling. Genetic dissection suggests that Abl functions via Fz/Dsh signaling in photoreceptor R3 specification, a well-established Fz–PCP signaling readout. Molecular analysis shows that dAbl binds and phosphorylates Dsh on Tyr473 within the DEP domain. This phosphorylation event on Dsh is functionally critical, as the equivalent DshY473F mutant is nonfunctional in PCP signaling and stable membrane association, although it rescues canonical Wnt signaling. Strikingly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for Abl1 and Abl2/Arg genes also show reduced Dvl2 phosphorylation as compared with control MEFs, and this correlates with a change in subcellular localization of endogenous Dvl2. As in Drosophila , such Abl-deficient MEFs show no change in canonical Wnt signaling. Taken together, our results argue for a conserved role of Abl family members in the positive regulation of Dsh activity toward Fz–Dsh/PCP signaling by Dsh phosphorylation.

Discussion

We provide evidence for a specific role of tyrosine phosphorylation of Dsh by Abl family kinases in Fz/Dsh–PCP signaling. We demonstrate that dAbl is required for R3/R4 fate specification. dAbl interacts with fz and dsh genetically in PCP signaling. Biochemical experiments indicate that dAbl binds Dsh and phosphorylates it on Tyr473 within the DEP domain, which has been specifically implicated in PCP signaling and is largely dispensable for canonical Wnt/Wg signaling ( Boutros and Mlodzik 1999 ; Wallingford and Habas 2005 ). Our data further show that Abl kinases do not affect canonical Wnt signaling in either Drosophila or MEFs. Taken together, our data indicate that Abl family kinases positively regulate PCP signaling by affecting Dsh/Dvl family members via phosphorylation of Tyr473. Abl family kinases appear to provide a molecular gating mechanism to increase the capability of Dsh/Dvl proteins to signal via the Fz/Dsh–PCP pathway ( Fig. 7G , see model). Our data suggest the possibility that this function of Abl family kinases might be conserved from flies to mammals, as similar effects were observed with mammalian Abl and Dvl family members.
