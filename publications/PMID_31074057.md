BACKGROUND: DNA methylation has been suggested as one of the epigenetic changes 
promoting carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate 
the methylation status of CADM 1, MAL and hsa-miR-124 genes in high-grade 
squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples with 
a histological correlation.
METHODS: Seventy histologically confirmed cases of HSIL paired with prior 
screening LBC diagnosis of HSIL within a 3-month interval were selected. 
Histologically, the lesions were reviewed and assessed including: (a) number of 
blocks harbouring dysplastic squamous epithelium; (b) number of blocks 
containing glandular extension of dysplastic epithelium; and (c) the depth of 
glandular extension (which was assessed semi-quantitatively as graded 1-3). 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) subtyping was performed from residual LBC materials 
using the LINEAR ARRAY HPV Genotyping Test and in-house polymerase chain 
reaction targeting the HPV E1 gene. The detection of methylation silencing of 
tumour suppressor genes CADM1, MAL and hsa-miR-124 was performed by multiplex 
methylation-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: A positive methylation status was detected in 41 cases (58.6%). The 
number of blocks with HSIL varied from one to 13. Glandular extension was seen 
in 44 cases with the number of blocks involved ranging from one to 10. The depth 
of HSIL glandular extension varied.
CONCLUSION: The DNA methylation test allows HSIL lesions to be divided into two 
distinct groups of methylated HSIL in significantly older patients and 
unmethylated HSIL in younger patients. This study was not able to prove that 
methylation status in cervical HSIL correlates with the size of the lesion 
(measured by the number of blocks involved) or with HSIL propensity for 
endocervical glandular extension, nor with HPV type or multi-infection.
