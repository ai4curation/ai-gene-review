p38 is associated with a macromolecular tRNA synthetase complex. It has an 
essential role as a scaffold for the complex, and genetic disruption of p38 in 
mice causes neonatal lethality. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms 
underlying lethality of p38-mutant mice. p38-deficient mice showed defects in 
lung differentiation and respiratory distress syndrome. p38 was found to 
interact with FUSE-binding protein (FBP), a transcriptional activator of c-myc. 
Binding of p38 stimulated ubiquitination and degradation of FBP, leading to 
downregulation of c-myc, which is required for differentiation of functional 
alveolar type II cells. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induced p38 
expression and promoted its translocation to nuclei for the regulation of FBP 
and c-myc. Thus, this work identified a new activity of p38 as a mediator of 
TGF-beta signaling and its functional importance in the control of c-myc during 
lung differentiation.
