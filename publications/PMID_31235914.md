The DNA and RNA processing protein TDP-43 undergoes both functional and 
pathogenic aggregation. Functional TDP-43 aggregates form reversible, transient 
species such as nuclear bodies, stress granules, and myo-granules. Pathogenic, 
irreversible TDP-43 aggregates form in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other 
neurodegenerative conditions. Here we find the features of TDP-43 fibrils that 
confer both reversibility and irreversibility by determining structures of two 
segments reported to be the pathogenic cores of human TDP-43 aggregation: SegA 
(residues 311-360), which forms three polymorphs, all with dagger-shaped folds; 
and SegB A315E (residues 286-331 containing the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
hereditary mutation A315E), which forms R-shaped folds. Energetic analysis 
suggests that the dagger-shaped polymorphs represent irreversible fibril 
structures, whereas the SegB polymorph may participate in both reversible and 
irreversible fibrils. Our structures reveal the polymorphic nature of TDP-43 and 
suggest how the A315E mutation converts the R-shaped polymorph to an 
irreversible form that enhances pathology.
