Eps15 and its related protein Eps15R are key components of the clathrin-mediated 
endocytic pathway. We searched for new binding partners of Eps15 using a yeast 
two-hybrid screen. We report here that ubiquilin (hPLIC1), a type-2 
ubiquitin-like protein containing a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) and a 
ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA), interacts with both Eps15 and Eps15R. Using 
glutathione-S-transferase pull-down experiments, we show that the first 
ubiquitin-interacting motif of Eps15 (UIM1) interacts directly with the UBL 
domain of ubiquilin, whereas it does not bind to ubiquitinated proteins. The 
second UIM of Eps15 (UIM2) binds poorly to the UBL domain but does bind to 
ubiquitinated proteins. Two other UIM-containing endocytic proteins, Hrs and 
Hbp, also interact with ubiquilin in a UIM-dependent manner, whereas epsin does 
not. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that endogenous Eps15 and Hrs, but not 
epsin, colocalize with green-fluorescent-protein-fused ubiquilin in cytoplasmic 
aggregates that are not endocytic compartments. We have characterized these 
green-fluorescent-protein-fused-ubiquilin aggregates as ubiquitin-rich 
intracytoplasmic inclusions that are recruited to aggresomes upon proteasome 
inhibition. Moreover, we show that endogenous Eps15 and endogenous ubiquilin 
colocalize to cytoplasmic aggregates and aggresomes. Finally, we show that the 
recruitment of Eps15 into ubiquilin-positive aggregates is UIM dependent. 
Altogether, our data identify ubiquilin as the first common UIM-binding partner 
of a subset of UIM-containing endocytic proteins. We propose that this 
UIM/UBL-based interaction is responsible for the sequestration of certain 
UIM-containing endocytic proteins into cytoplasmic ubiquitin-rich protein 
aggregates.
