An asymmetrical network of cortically localized PAR proteins forms shortly after 
fertilization of the C. elegans egg. This network is required for subsequent 
asymmetries in the expression patterns of several proteins that are encoded by 
nonlocalized, maternally expressed mRNAs. We provide evidence that two nearly 
identical genes, mex-5 and mex-6, link PAR asymmetry to those subsequent protein 
asymmetries. MEX-5 is a novel, cytoplasmic protein that is localized through PAR 
activities to the anterior pole of the 1-cell stage embryo. MEX-5 localization 
is reciprocal to that of a group of posterior-localized proteins called germline 
proteins. Ectopic expression of MEX-5 is sufficient to inhibit the expression of 
germline proteins, suggesting that MEX-5 functions to inhibit anterior 
expression of the germline proteins.
