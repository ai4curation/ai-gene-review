We have recently reported that keratin 14-promoter-driven vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF)-E(NZ-7) transgenic mice have a significant number of 
capillary vessels in subcutaneous tissue. However, these vessels are generated 
in a layer some distance from the epithelial basal cells that express 
VEGF-E(NZ-7), suggesting that one or more antiangiogenenic molecules may exist 
very near the basal cell layer. By screening keratinocyte-conditioned medium, we 
found that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is produced from keratinocytes and 
suppresses human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) growth as well as 
tubular formation in a HUVEC-fibroblast coculture system. Different to the known 
mechanism of CD36-dependent endothelial cell apoptosis, the HUVEC we used did 
not express CD36 at detectable levels, indicating a new mechanism for 
TSP-1-induced antiangiogenesis. We found that TSP-1 induces little apoptosis of 
endothelial cells but causes cell-cycle arrest, increasing the amounts of 
p21(CIP/WAF-1) and unphosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) in HUVEC. CD36-binding 
peptide in TSP-1 and CD36-neutralizing antibody did not block the TSP-1-induced 
cell-cycle arrest. Our results strongly suggest that TSP-1 utilizes a novel 
pathway for its antiangiogenic effect independent of CD36, and suppresses the 
cell cycle.

Abstract

We have recently reported that keratin 14‐promoter‐driven vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)‐E NZ‐7 transgenic mice have a significant number of capillary vessels in subcutaneous tissue. However, these vessels are generated in a layer some distance from the epithelial basal cells that express VEGF‐E NZ‐7 , suggesting that one or more antiangiogenenic molecules may exist very near the basal cell layer. By screening keratinocyte‐conditioned medium, we found that thrombospondin‐1 (TSP‐1) is produced from keratinocytes and suppresses human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) growth as well as tubular formation in a HUVEC–fibroblast coculture system. Different to the known mechanism of CD36‐dependent endothelial cell apoptosis, the HUVEC we used did not express CD36 at detectable levels, indicating a new mechanism for TSP‐1‐induced antiangiogenesis. We found that TSP‐1 induces little apoptosis of endothelial cells but causes cell‐cycle arrest, increasing the amounts of p21 CIP/WAF‐1 and unphosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) in HUVEC. CD36‐binding peptide in TSP‐1 and CD36‐neutralizing antibody did not block the TSP‐1‐induced cell‐cycle arrest. Our results strongly suggest that TSP‐1 utilizes a novel pathway for its antiangiogenic effect independent of CD36, and suppresses the cell cycle. ( Cancer Sci 2007; 98: 1491–1497)

Materials and Methods

Materials. Recombinant human VEGF 165 and hepatic growth factor (HGF) were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA, USA). Angiopoietin‐1 (Ang‐1) was kindly provided by Dr D. G. Yancopoulos (Regeneration Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Purified human TSP‐1 was purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany).

Results

TSP‐1 is a major antiangiogenic factor secreted from keratinocytes. To examine the possible antiangiogenic factors near the basal epidermal layer in the skin of K14‐VEGF‐E NZ‐7 transgenic mice, we tested whether the CM of keratinocytes had antiangiogenic activity or not. An antiangiogenic effect was clearly detected in both HK CM and MK CM ( Fig. 1A , and Supplementary Fig. 1A ) by using a tubular formation assay in cocultures of HUVEC and human fibroblasts that mimic angiogenesis in vivo . ( 12 ) To reveal which factor has antiangiogenic activity, we tested the angiogenesis‐inhibitory activity of each fraction of HK CM separated by gel chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1B , fractions 9 and 10 inhibited both the tubular formation and growth of HUVEC. Next, we attempted to identify the antiangiogenic factors in these fractions. The specific protein band at ~180 kDa in HK CM ( Fig. 1C left panel) was analyzed by LC‐MALDI‐TOF‐TOF‐MS and found to consist of TSP‐1. We confirmed the presence of TSP‐1 at the 180‐kDa position in HK CM by western blotting using anti‐TSP‐1 Ab ( Fig. 1C right panel). As expected, TSP‐1 bands were clearly detected in fractions 9 and 10 (Supplementary Fig. 1B ). Furthermore, TSP‐1 inhibited the tubular formation and proliferation of HUVEC ( Fig. 1D,E ) in vitro in a dose‐dependent manner. However, TSP‐1 did not interfere with the proliferation of human fibroblasts (data not shown). These results indicate that keratinocytes secrete TSP‐1 as a major antiangiogenic factor.

Discussion

In the present study, we found that keratinocytes secrete TSP‐1, and the TSP‐1 suppresses the proliferation and tubular formation of HUVEC in vitro . Very little, if any, CD36‐dependent apoptosis was detected under these conditions. Cell‐cycle arrest of HUVEC accompanies an upregulation of p21 CIP/WAF‐1 expression, phosphorylation of p53 and dephosphorylation of Rb ( Fig. 5 ).

Using immunostaining, Yano et al . found that TSP‐1 is expressed in the epidermal layer, including basal cells. ( 21 ) Our results showed a similar staining pattern both in wild‐type and VEGF‐E NZ‐7 transgenic mice (data not shown). The structure of the epithelial layer as well as basal cells in K14‐promoter‐driven VEGF‐E NZ‐7 transgenic mice was well maintained compared with those in the wild‐type mice. ( 4 ) We therefore suggest that the level of TSP‐1 in the keratinocytes of the transgenic mice was not significantly different from that in the wild‐type mice.

Previously, Streit et al . ( 22 ) reported that K14‐promoter‐driven overexpression of TSP‐1 in keratinocytes suppresses wound healing and granulation tissue formation. Thus, exogenous TSP‐1 in the skin functions as an angiogenic inhibitor in such a pathological condition. Consistent with their results, our results suggest that endogenous TSP‐1 could also suppress angiogenesis and make a thin avascular area below the epidermal basal cell layer.

A major question is whether the cell‐cycle arrest of HUVEC with TSP‐1 was totally unrelated to CD36. In the blood coagulation system, TSP‐1 interacts with CD36, which is expressed in monocytes, macrophages and other types of cells and regulates coagulation, thrombosis and inflammation. We confirmed that CD36 is well expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, using the same procedure, we could not detect the expression of CD36 in HUVEC or HAEC, which showed cell‐cycle arrest similar to HUVEC in the presence of TSP‐1 ( Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). In addition, neither anti‐TSP‐1 neutralizing Ab (Ab‐1), which blocks the binding of TSP‐1 to CD36, nor anti‐CD36 neutralizing Ab suppressed the antiangiogenic effects of TSP‐1 on HUVEC. Moreover, phosphorylation of either p38 or JNK was not induced by TSP‐1, different from CD36‐expressing endothelial cells. It might be that in vivo , capillary endothelial cells upregulate CD36 expression and this CD36 facilitates the antiangiogenic effect of TSP‐1. Although this possibility cannot be completely ruled out at the moment, we did not observe a strong apoptotic response in the skin of K14‐driven VEGF‐E NZ‐7 transgenic mice. CD36 −/– mice were generated by Febbraio et al . but did not show a clear increase in capillary density in subcutaneous tissues, ( 16 , 23 ) suggesting that the CD36‐dependent pathway is not a major regulator of the vascular network in the skin. The expression of CD36 in vascular endothelial cells of tumor tissues has been reported by several research groups. ( 24 , 25 , 26 ) Because the levels of CD36 in vascular endothelial cells in the pathological angiogenesis is not even (i.e. some endothelial cells appear positive but others are very low or undetectable), we suggest that both mechanisms, CD36‐dependent apoptosis and CD36‐independent cell‐cycle arrest, may exist in the tumor tissues treated with TSP‐1.

Tumor cells derived from Li Fraumeni syndrome in humans have been reported to have decreased TSP‐1 levels. ( 27 ) Although this correlation is not seen consistently in all human tumors, wild‐type p53 appears to increase TSP‐1 expression in some tumor types, contributing to the suppression of tumor growth. Our results indicate that another type of relationship between p53 and TSP‐1 may exist in vascular endothelial cells, where TSP‐1 upregulates the p53–p21 pathway. Thus, we suggest that both directions between p53 and TSP‐1 are present in vivo , depending on the cell type.

Also of interest are the characteristics of the putative TSP‐1 receptor other than CD36 on HUVEC. We showed that TSP‐1 did not block a specific angiogenic ligand such as VEGF, bFGF, HGF or Ang‐1. Therefore, this putative receptor may not be associated with a specific receptor such as VEGFR‐2 (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Approximately 50% inhibition of HUVEC growth and tubular formation was achieved with 20–50 nM TSP‐1. We therefore suggest that the interaction between TSP‐1 and the putative receptor on endothelial cells is rather weak, not like that of the growth factor–receptor interaction for which the 50% inhibitory concentration is in the order of 10–100 pM.

It is of interest to know which region of TSP‐1 plays an important role in inducing cell‐cycle arrest of HUVEC. The type‐Ι repeat domain of TSP‐1 was reported to be important for antiangiogenic activity. ( 28 , 29 ) This domain includes the CD36‐binding region. However, as we have shown in Fig. 2B,C , a CD36‐binding peptide (peptide A) did not inhibit the growth or tubular formation of HUVEC. Another peptide within the type‐Ι repeat, GGWSHWSPWSS, was also reported to inhibit angiogenesis. ( 20 ) Studies by Crawford et al . ( 14 ) and Murphy‐Ullrich and Poczatek ( 30 ) reported that the KRFK sequence activates TGF‐β1. However, the proliferation and tubular formation of HUVEC was not inhibited by either a synthetic peptide (peptide B: KRFKQGGWSHWSPWSSC), which includes the above two sequences, or TGF‐β1‐neutralizing Ab (Supplementary Fig. 4A,B ). Furthermore, a mixture of peptides A and B did not inhibit the tubular formation or proliferation either (Supplementary Fig. 4C and data not shown). No obvious competitive or additive effect was detected using this mixture of peptides in the presence of TSP‐1 (Supplementary Fig. 4D,E ). Also, our preliminary results suggest that the interaction between CD47 and TSP‐1 and that between integrin β1 and TSP‐1 do not contribute to the suppressive effect as no obvious effect was observed in the presence of anti‐CD47 or anti‐integrin β1‐blocking antibody (data not shown). These results suggest that TSP‐1 inhibits angiogenesis caused by TSP‐1 in the HUVEC system, independent of known sequences.

Taken together, our results indicate that TSP‐1 induces a unique response in certain types of vascular endothelial cells, blocks the cell cycle, and suppresses angiogenesis in vivo .
