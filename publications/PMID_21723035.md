Apoptosis is a highly conserved genetic process leading to death in mammalian 
cells. A critical step in apoptosis is mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, 
which results in the release of proteins critical to downstream events. 
Transmembrane protein 14A (TMEM14A) was identified as a novel suppressor of Bax 
using yeast-based functional screening. TMEM14A is a novel 
mitochondria-associated membrane protein containing a putative transmembrane 
domain. Over-expression of TMEM14A in U87MG cells inhibited 
N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR)-induced apoptosis. TMEM14A prevented 
4-HPR-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), the release of 
cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase-3, but not the generation of 
reactive oxygen species, suggesting that TMEM14A regulates mitochondrial 
membrane potential in a ROS-independent manner. As expected, cyclosporin A, an 
inhibitor of membrane potential transition, inhibited 4-HPR-induced loss of MMP 
and apoptosis in U87MG cells, indicating that loss of MMP plays a pivotal role 
in 4-HPR-induced apoptosis. Suppression of TMEM14A expression using shRNA 
significantly increased apoptosis and MMP loss in untreated and 4-HPR-treated 
cells. These findings show for the first time that TMEM14A inhibits apoptosis by 
blocking the mitochondrial permeability transition and stabilizing mitochondrial 
membrane potential.
