Zhangfei (ZF) is a basic region-leucine zipper protein that has been implicated 
in herpesvirus infection cycle and related cellular processes. Here we show both 
in vivo and in vitro data demonstrating that ZF is a novel cellular binding 
partner of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (or CREB2). We found that ZF 
competed with ATF4 to form ATF4-ZF heterodimeric complexes through the bZIP 
regions. ZF enhanced ATF4 binding to the cAMP response element (CRE), and 
augmented activation of a CRE reporter by ATF4, in response to MEK1 activation. 
These results suggest an important role of ZF in the MEK1-ATF4 signaling 
pathway.
