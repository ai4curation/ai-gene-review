The final outcome of protein polyubiquitylation is often proteasome-mediated 
proteolysis, meaning that "proofreading" of ubiquitylation by ubiquitin 
proteases (UBPs) is crucial. Transcriptional arrest can trigger 
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) so a UBP reversing 
RNAPII ubiquitylation might be expected. Here, we show that Ubp3 deubiquitylates 
RNAPII in yeast. Genetic characterization of ubp3 cells is consistent with a 
role in elongation, and Ubp3 can be purified with RNAPII, Def1, and the 
elongation factors Spt5 and TFIIF. This Ubp3 complex deubiquitylates both mono- 
and polyubiquitylated RNAPII in vitro, and ubp3 cells have elevated levels of 
ubiquitylated RNAPII in vivo. Moreover, RNAPII is degraded faster in a ubp3 
mutant after UV irradiation. Problems posed by damage-arrested RNAPII are 
thought to be resolved either by removing the damage or degrading the 
polymerase. In agreement with this, cells with compromised DNA repair are better 
equipped to survive UV damage when UPB3 is deleted.
