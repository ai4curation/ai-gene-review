Individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) develop low-grade astrocytomas at an 
increased frequency. To gain insight into the function of the Nf1 gene product 
as a growth regulator for astrocytes, we examined mice heterozygous for a 
targeted Nf1 mutation. In our previous studies, we demonstrated increased 
numbers of proliferating astrocytes in Nf1 heterozygote (Nf1+/-) mice in vivo. 
We now show that cultured Nf1+/- astrocytes exhibit a cell-autonomous growth 
advantage in vitro associated with increased p21-ras pathway activation. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate that Nf1+/-;wild-type N-ras mice have a similar 
astrocyte growth advantage in vitro and in vivo as either oncogenic N-ras or 
Nf1+/-; oncogenic N-ras mice. Lastly, mice heterozygous for targeted defects in 
both Nf1 and p53 as well as Nf1 and Rb exhibit 3- and 2.5-fold increases in 
astrocyte proliferation in vivo, respectively, suggesting that abnormalities in 
Nf1- and p53/Rb-regulated pathways cooperate in the heterozygous state to confer 
a growth advantage for brain astrocytes. Collectively, these results provide 
evidence for a cell-autonomous growth advantage in Nf1+/- astrocytes and suggest 
that some of the brain pathology in individuals with NF1 might result from 
reduced, but not absent, NF1 gene function.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Noonan syndrome (NS) are neurogenetic syndromes caused by pathogenetic variants encoding components of the Ras-ERK-MAPK signaling pathway (Ras pathway). NF1 and NS are associated with differences in social communication and related neuropsychiatric risks. During the last decade, there has been growing interest in Ras-linked syndromes as models to understand social communication deficits and autism spectrum disorders. We systematically review the literature between 2010â€“2023 focusing on the social communication construct of the RDoC framework. We provide an integrative summary of the research on facial and non-facial social communication processes in NF1 and NS across molecular, cellular, neural circuitry, and behavioral domains. At the molecular and cellular levels, dysregulation in the Ras pathway is intricately tied to variations in social communication through changes in GABAergic, glutamatergic, and serotonergic transmission, as well as inhibitory/excitatory imbalance. Neural circuitry typically associated with learning, attention, and memory in NF1 and NS (e.g., cortico-striatal connectivity), is also implicated in social communication. We highlight less researched, potential mechanisms for social communication, such as white matter connectivity and the default mode network. Finally, key gaps in NF1 and NS literature are identified and a roadmap for future research is provided. By leveraging genetic syndromes research, we can understand the mechanisms associated with behaviors and psychiatric disorders.
