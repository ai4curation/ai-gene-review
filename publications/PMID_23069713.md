Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are an attractive 
candidate for cell therapy in heart disease. Low survival and incomplete 
electromechanical integration between resident cardiomyocytes and transplanted 
hMSCs remain unsolved. In order for an infarcted heart to tolerate 
transplantation, differentiation capacity in stem cells must be reinforced. In 
this study, we found that compound 56, an epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) inhibitor, promotes cardiogenic differentiation of hMSCs and the 
transplantation of hMSCs treated with compound 56 resulted in enhancement of 
heart functions. Furthermore, hMSCs transfected with microRNA-133a (miR-133a), 
which targets EGFR, were observed to express cardiac-specific markers. We also 
discovered that luciferase activity is exclusively decreased by targeting EGFR 
in hMSCs transfected with miR-133a mimic. These results suggest that EGFR plays 
a key role in the regulation of cardiogenic differentiation in hMSCs.
