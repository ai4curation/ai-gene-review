Using a three-hybrid strategy in yeast, we have cloned a new splice variant of 
Siglec-10, called Siglec-10 Sv3. This splice variant lacks part of exon 3, but 
keeps the reading frame, as well as the crucial regions for interaction with 
Sias and the motifs for intracellular signaling. The expression of Siglec-10 Sv3 
in T- and B-cells was detected by RT-PCR. Moreover, cDNA of another new splicing 
form of Siglec-10, named Siglec-10 Sv4, was identified by RT-PCR. One common 
characteristic of all Siglec-10 splice forms (except for Siglec-10 Sv2) is their 
cytoplasmic tail with two ITIMs and one CD150-like sequence. We confirmed the 
recruitment of SHP-1 to the Siglec-10 cytoplasmic tail by Western blot analysis 
and demonstrated that this interaction depends on tyrosine phosphorylation. 
Mutational analyses showed that ITIM Y609 of Siglec-10 and the N-terminal SH2 
domain of SHP-1 play a pivotal role in the interaction between Siglec-10 and 
SHP-1. Finally, we demonstrated that Siglec-10 was not able to bind SAP/SH2d1A, 
indicating that the so-called CD150-like motif in Siglec-10 might be a docking 
site for other signal transduction mediators.
