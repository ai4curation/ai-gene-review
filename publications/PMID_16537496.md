DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) is a putative tumor suppressor gene whose 
expression is lost in numerous cancers. DCC also encodes the main receptor for 
the neuronal navigation cue netrin-1. It has been shown that DCC belongs to the 
so-called family of dependence receptors. Such receptors induce apoptosis when 
their ligand is absent, thus conferring a state of cellular dependence on ligand 
availability. We recently proposed that DCC is a tumor suppressor because it 
induces the death of tumor cells that grow in settings of ligand unavailability. 
Moreover, it seems that the DCC/netrin-1 pair may also regulate neuron survival 
during nervous system development. However, the mechanisms by which DCC triggers 
cell death are still unknown. We show here that the localization of DCC to lipid 
rafts is a prerequisite for its proapoptotic activity, both in immortalized 
cells and in primary neurons. The presence of DCC in lipid rafts probably allows 
the formation of an adequate submembrane complex, because the interaction of 
caspase-9 with DCC is inhibited by the disorganization of lipid rafts. Thus, 
dependence receptors may require lipid raft localization for cell death 
signaling.
