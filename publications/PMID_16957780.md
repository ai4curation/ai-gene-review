Oncogenic viruses frequently target the pathways controlled by tumor suppressor 
genes, suggesting an extra function for these proteins as antiviral factors. The 
control exerted by the tumor suppressor Arf on cellular proliferation is crucial 
to restrict tumor development; however, a potential contribution of Arf to 
prevent viral infectivity has remained unexplored. In the present study, we 
investigated the consequences of loss or increased expression of Arf on viral 
infection. Our results reveal that ARF expression is induced by interferon and 
after viral infection. Furthermore, we show that ARF protects against viral 
infection in a gene dosage-dependent manner, and that this antiviral action is 
mediated in part by PKR through a mechanism that involves ARF-induced release of 
PKR from nucleophosmin complexes. Finally, Arf-null mice were hypersensitive to 
viral infection compared to wild-type mice. Together, our results reveal a novel 
and unexpected role for the tumor suppressor ARF in viral infection 
surveillance.
