Cytolysis of target cells by natural killer (NK) cells and by some cytotoxic T 
cells occurs unless prevented by inhibitory receptors that recognize MHC class I 
on target cells. Human NK cells express a p58 inhibitory receptor specific for 
HLA-C. We report association of the tyrosine phosphatase HCP with the p58 
receptor in NK cells. HCP association was dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation 
of p58. Phosphotyrosyl peptides corresponding to the p58 tail bound and 
activated HCP in vitro. Furthermore, introduction of an inactive mutant HCP into 
an NK cell line prevented the p58-mediated inhibition of target cell lysis. 
These data imply that the inhibitory function of p58 is dependent on its 
tyrosine phosphorylation and on recruitment and activation of HCP.
