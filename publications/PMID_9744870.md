The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase Rim15p was identified previously as 
a stimulator of meiotic gene expression. Here, we show that loss of Rim15p 
causes an additional pleiotropic phenotype in cells grown to stationary phase on 
rich medium; this phenotype includes defects in trehalose and glycogen 
accumulation, in transcriptional derepression of HSP12, HSP26, and SSA3, in 
induction of thermotolerance and starvation resistance, and in proper G1 arrest. 
These phenotypes are commonly associated with hyperactivity of the Ras/cAMP 
pathway. Tests of epistasis suggest that Rim15p may act in this pathway 
downstream of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK). Accordingly, deletion of 
RIM15 suppresses the growth defect of a temperature-sensitive adenylate-cyclase 
mutant and, most importantly, renders cells independent of cAPK activity. 
Conversely, overexpression of RIM15 suppresses phenotypes associated with a 
mutation in the regulatory subunit of cAPK, exacerbates the growth defect of 
strains compromised for cAPK activity, and partially induces a starvation 
response in logarithmically growing wild-type cells. Biochemical analyses reveal 
that cAPK-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of Rim15p strongly inhibits its 
kinase activity. Taken together, these results place Rim15p immediately 
downstream and under negative control of cAPK and define a positive regulatory 
role of Rim15p for entry into both meiosis and stationary phase.
