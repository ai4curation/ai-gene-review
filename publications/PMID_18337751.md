The calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates 
eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2 kinase; eEF2K) is subject to multisite 
phosphorylation, which regulates its activity. Phosphorylation at Ser359 
inhibits eEF2K activity even at high calcium concentrations. To identify the 
kinase that phosphorylates Ser359 in eEF2K, we developed an extensive 
purification protocol. Tryptic mass fingerprint analysis identified it as cdc2 
(cyclin-dependent kinase 1). cdc2 co-purifies with Ser359 kinase activity and 
cdc2-cyclin B complexes phosphorylate eEF2K at Ser359. We demonstrate that cdc2 
contributes to controlling eEF2 phosphorylation in cells. cdc2 is activated 
early in mitosis. Kinase activity against Ser359 in eEF2K also peaks at this 
stage of the cell cycle and eEF2 phosphorylation is low in mitotic cells. 
Inactivation of eEF2K by cdc2 may serve to keep eEF2 active during mitosis 
(where calcium levels rise) and thereby permit protein synthesis to proceed in 
mitotic cells. Amino-acid starvation decreases cdc2's activity against eEF2K, 
whereas loss of TSC2 (a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin 
complex 1(mTORC1)) increases it. These data closely match the control of Ser359 
phosphorylation and indicate that cdc2 may be regulated by mTORC1.
