BACKGROUND: Multinucleation is a hallmark of osteoclast formation and has a 
unique ability to resorb bone matrix. During osteoclast differentiation, the 
cytoskeleton reorganization results in the generation of actin belts and 
eventual bone resorption. Tetraspanins are involved in adhesion, migration and 
fusion in various cells. However, its function in osteoclast is still unclear. 
In this study, we identified Tm4sf19, a member of the tetraspanin family, as a 
regulator of osteoclast function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigate the effect of Tm4sf19 deficiency on 
osteoclast differentiation using bone marrow-derived macrophages obtained from 
wild type (WT), Tm4sf19 knockout (KO) and Tm4sf19 LELΔ mice lacking the large 
extracellular loop (LEL). We analyzed bone mass of young and aged WT, KO and 
LELΔ mice by μCT analysis. The effects of Tm4sf19 LEL-Fc fusion protein were 
accessed in osteoclast differentiation and osteoporosis animal model.
RESULTS: We found that deficiency of Tm4sf19 inhibited osteoclast function and 
LEL of Tm4sf19 was responsible for its function in osteoclasts in vitro. KO and 
LELΔ mice exhibited higher trabecular bone mass compared to WT mice. We found 
that Tm4sf19 interacts with integrin αvβ3 through LEL, and that this binding is 
important for cytoskeletal rearrangements in osteoclast by regulating signaling 
downstream of integrin αvβ3. Treatment with LEL-Fc fusion protein inhibited 
osteoclast function in vitro and administration of LEL-Fc prevented bone loss in 
an osteoporosis mouse model in vivo.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that Tm4sf19 regulates osteoclast function and that 
LEL-Fc may be a promising drug to target bone destructive diseases caused by 
osteoclast hyper-differentiation.
