Axon injury in response to trauma or disease stimulates a self-destruction 
program that promotes the localized clearance of damaged axon segments. Sterile 
alpha and Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR) motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1) is 
an evolutionarily conserved executioner of this degeneration cascade, also known 
as Wallerian degeneration; however, the mechanism of SARM1-dependent neuronal 
destruction is still obscure. SARM1 possesses a TIR domain that is necessary for 
SARM1 activity. In other proteins, dimerized TIR domains serve as scaffolds for 
innate immune signaling. In contrast, dimerization of the SARM1 TIR domain 
promotes consumption of the essential metabolite NAD+ and induces neuronal 
destruction. This activity is unique to the SARM1 TIR domain, yet the structural 
elements that enable this activity are unknown. In this study, we identify 
fundamental properties of the SARM1 TIR domain that promote NAD+ loss and axon 
degeneration. Dimerization of the TIR domain from the Caenorhabditis elegans 
SARM1 ortholog TIR-1 leads to NAD+ loss and neuronal death, indicating these 
activities are an evolutionarily conserved feature of SARM1 function. Detailed 
analysis of sequence homology identifies canonical TIR motifs as well as a 
SARM1-specific (SS) loop that are required for NAD+ loss and axon degeneration. 
Furthermore, we identify a residue in the SARM1 BB loop that is dispensable for 
TIR activity yet required for injury-induced activation of full-length SARM1, 
suggesting that SARM1 function requires multidomain interactions. Indeed, we 
identify a physical interaction between the autoinhibitory N terminus and the 
TIR domain of SARM1, revealing a previously unrecognized direct connection 
between these domains that we propose mediates autoinhibition and activation 
upon injury.
