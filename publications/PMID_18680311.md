CIN85 is an adaptor protein linking the ubiquitin ligase Cbl and 
clathrin-binding proteins in clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. The SH3 
domains of CIN85 bind to a proline-rich region of Cbl. Here we show that all 
three SH3 domains of CIN85 bind to ubiquitin. We also present a data-based 
structural model of the CIN85 SH3-C domain in complex with ubiquitin. In this 
complex, ubiquitin binds to the canonical interaction surface of the SH3 domain 
for proline-rich ligands and mimics the PPII helix, and we provide evidence that 
ubiquitin competes with these ligands for binding. We demonstrate that 
disruption of ubiquitin binding results in constitutive ubiquitination of CIN85 
and an increased level of ubiquitination of EGFR in the absence of EGF 
stimulation. These results suggest that competition between Cbl and ubiquitin 
binding to CIN85 regulates Cbl function and EGFR endocytosis.
