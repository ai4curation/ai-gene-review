The reciprocal coordination between cholesterol absorption in the intestine and 
de novo cholesterol synthesis in the liver is essential for maintaining 
cholesterol homeostasis, yet the mechanisms governing the opposing regulation of 
these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a hormone, Cholesin, 
which is capable of inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver, leading to a 
reduction in circulating cholesterol levels. Cholesin is encoded by a gene with 
a previously unknown function (C7orf50 in humans; 3110082I17Rik in mice). It is 
secreted from the intestine in response to cholesterol absorption and binds to 
GPR146, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, exerting antagonistic downstream 
effects by inhibiting PKA signaling and thereby suppressing SREBP2-controlled 
cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the 
Cholesin-GPR146 axis mediates the inhibitory effect of intestinal cholesterol 
absorption on hepatic cholesterol synthesis. This discovered hormone, Cholesin, 
holds promise as an effective agent in combating hypercholesterolemia and 
atherosclerosis.
