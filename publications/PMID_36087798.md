CTP synthase (CTPS), a metabolic enzyme responsible for the de novo synthesis of 
CTP, can form filamentous structures termed cytoophidia, which are 
evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans. Here we used 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe to study the cytoophidium assembly regulation by 
ubiquitination. We tested the CTP synthase's capacity to be post-translationally 
modified by ubiquitin or be affected by the ubiquitination state of the cell and 
showed that ubiquitination is important for the maintenance of the CTPS 
filamentous structure in fission yeast. We have identified proteins which are in 
complex with CTPS, including specific ubiquitination regulators which 
significantly affect CTPS filamentation, and mapped probable ubiquitination 
targets on CTPS. Furthermore, we discovered that a cohort of deubiquitinating 
enzymes is important for the regulation of cytoophidium's filamentous 
morphology. Our study provides a framework for the analysis of the effects that 
ubiquitination and deubiquitination have on the formation of cytoophidia.
