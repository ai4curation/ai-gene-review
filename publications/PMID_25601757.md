The TET2 DNA dioxygenase regulates cell identity and suppresses tumorigenesis by 
modulating DNA methylation and expression of a large number of genes. How TET2, 
like most other chromatin-modifying enzymes, is recruited to specific genomic 
sites is unknown. Here we report that WT1, a sequence-specific transcription 
factor, is mutated in a mutually exclusive manner with TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 in 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML). WT1 physically interacts with and recruits TET2 to 
its target genes to activate their expression. The interaction between WT1 and 
TET2 is disrupted by multiple AML-derived TET2 mutations. TET2 suppresses 
leukemia cell proliferation and colony formation in a manner dependent on WT1. 
These results provide a mechanism for targeting TET2 to a specific DNA sequence 
in the genome. Our results also provide an explanation for the mutual 
exclusivity of WT1 and TET2 mutations in AML, and suggest an IDH1/2-TET2-WT1 
pathway in suppressing AML.
