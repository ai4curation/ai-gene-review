A zinc finger protein, ZPR9, has been identified as a physiological substrate of 
murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various 
cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, 
and oncogenesis. Here, ZPR9 was found to physically interact with apoptosis 
signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) through a disulfide linkage involving 
Cys(1351) and Cys(1360) of ASK1 and Cys(305) and Cys(308) of ZPR9. ASK1 directly 
phosphorylated ZPR9 at Ser(314) and Thr(318), suggesting that ZPR9 can act as an 
ASK1 substrate. Ectopic expression of wild-type ZPR9, but not an S314A/T318A 
mutant, stimulated ASK1 kinase activity and positively regulated ASK1-mediated 
signaling to both JNK and p38 kinases by destabilizing complex formation between 
ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3, or by increasing complex 
formation between ASK1 and its substrate MKK3. ZPR9 functionally stimulated 
ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity as well as H(2)O(2)-mediated 
apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. ASK1-mediated phosphorylation 
of ZPR9 at Ser(314) and Thr(318) was also responsible for ZPR9-induced 
apoptosis. Moreover, ZPR9 inhibited PDK1-mediated signaling through ASK1 
activation. These results suggest that ZPR9 functions as a novel positive 
regulator of ASK1.
