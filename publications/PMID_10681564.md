Atp11p is a protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae required for the assembly of the 
F(1) component of the mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase. This study presents 
evidence that Atp11p binds selectively to the beta-subunit of F(1). Under 
conditions in which avidin-Sepharose beads specifically adsorbed biotinylated 
Atp11p from yeast mitochondrial extracts, the F(1) beta-subunit coprecipitated 
with the tagged Atp11p protein. Binding interactions between Atp11p and the 
entire beta-subunit of F(1) or fragments of the beta-subunit were also revealed 
by a yeast two-hybrid screen: Atp11p bound to a region of the nucleotide-binding 
domain of the beta-subunit located between Gly(114) and Leu(318). Certain 
elements of this sequence that would be accessible to Atp11p in the free 
beta-subunit make contact with adjacent alpha-subunits in the assembled enzyme. 
This observation suggests that the alpha-subunits may exchange for bound Atp11p 
during the process of F(1) assembly.
