Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is critical for 
mediating Toll-like receptor (TLR)-interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling and 
subsequent activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1, transcriptional activators of 
innate immunity. Here we show that beta-arrestins, a family of multifunctional 
proteins, directly interacted with TRAF6 after TLR-IL-1R activation. Formation 
of the beta-arrestin-TRAF6 complex prevented autoubiquitination of TRAF6 and 
activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1. Endotoxin-treated beta-arrestin 2-deficient 
mice had higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and were more 
susceptible to endotoxic shock. Thus, beta-arrestins are essential negative 
regulators of innate immune activation via TLR-IL-1R signaling.
