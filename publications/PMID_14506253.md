The Escherichia coli SurA protein is a periplasmic molecular chaperone that 
facilitates correct folding of outer membrane porins. The peptide binding 
specificity of SurA has been characterized using phage display of heptameric 
peptides of random sequence. The consensus binding pattern of 
aromatic-polar-aromatic-nonpolar-proline amino acids emerges for both SurA and a 
SurA "core domain," which remains after deletion of a peripheral 
peptidyl-proline isomerase domain. Isothermal titration calorimetry with a high 
affinity heptameric peptide of sequence WEYIPNV yields peptide affinities in the 
range of 1-14 microm for both SurA and its core domain. Although the peptide 
consensus aromatic-polar-aromatic-nonpolar-proline occurs infrequently in E. 
coli proteins, the less restrictive tripeptide motif aromatic-random-aromatic 
appears with greater-than-random frequency in outer membrane proteins and is 
prevalent in the "aromatic bands" of the porin beta barrel structures. Thus, 
SurA recognizes a peptide motif that is characteristic of integral outer 
membrane proteins.
