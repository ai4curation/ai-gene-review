Incorporation of thrombospondin into fibrin clots.

Bale MD, Westrick LG, Mosher DF.

Thrombospondin is a major platelet glycoprotein which is released from platelets 
during blood coagulation. We examined the interaction of thrombospondin with 
polymerizing fibrin. Thrombospondin, purified from human platelets and labeled 
with 125I, became incorporated into clots formed from both plasma and purified 
fibrinogen. Plasma clots contained somewhat less thrombospondin than clots 
formed from equivalent concentrations of fibrinogen. In plasma clots and fibrin 
clots formed in the presence of factor XIII, thrombospondin was cross-linked in 
the clot; thrombospondin in the supernatant remained largely monomeric. 
Cross-linking of thrombospondin by factor XIII, however, only slightly increased 
the amount of thrombospondin which was incorporated into the clot. In contrast, 
incorporation of 125I-fibronectin into clots was dependent upon cross-linking. 
Most of the incorporation of 125I-thrombospondin occurred during fibrin 
polymerization as judged by parallel studies of the incorporation of 
125I-fibrinogen. The amount of thrombospondin incorporated into a clot was 
directly related to thrombospondin concentration and was only weakly dependent 
on fibrinogen concentration. Incorporation was not saturated at 
thrombospondin:fibrin (mol/mol) ratios as high as 2/1. Thrombospondin, however, 
modified the final structure of fibrin clots in a concentration-dependent manner 
as monitored by opacity. When tryptic digests of 125I-thrombospondin were 
studied, the 270-kilodalton core became incorporated into fibrin whereas the 
30-kilodalton heparin binding fragment was excluded. These results indicate that 
thrombospondin specifically co-polymerizes with fibrin during blood coagulation 
and may be an important modulator of clot structure.
