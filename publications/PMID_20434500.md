The p53 tumor suppressor coordinates a multitude of cellular and organismal 
processes and exerts its activities mainly by activation of gene transcription. 
Here we describe the transcriptional activation of ectodysplasin A2 receptor 
(EDA2R) by p53 in a variety of cell types and tissues. We demonstrate that 
treatment of cancer cells with the ligand EDA-A2, known to specifically activate 
EDA2R, results in p53-dependent cell death. Moreover, we show that EDA2R is 
transactivated by p53 during chemotherapy-induced hair-loss, although its 
presence is not necessary for this process. These data shed new light on the 
role of EDA2R in exerting p53 function.
