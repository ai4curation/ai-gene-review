The role of the mitochondrial Hsp70 system in the prevention of heat-induced 
protein aggregation was studied in isolated mitochondria from Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Firefly luciferase was employed as a thermolabile tester protein. 
After shift to 40 degrees Celsius transient increase of mt-Hsp70/luciferase 
complex was observed, which required functional Mdj1p and Mge1p, the 
mitochondrial homologues of DnaJ and GrpE. The kinetics of luciferase 
aggregation, however, were not influenced by mutations in either mt-Hsp70 or 
Mge1p. Only the absence of Mdj1p led to enhanced protein aggregation. Thus, a 
central role in the transient protection against heat stress is attributed to 
this mitochondrial DnaJ homologue.
