We previously identified a 10-amino acid region from the Y domain of 
phospholipase Cbeta2 (PLCbeta2) that associates with G-protein betagamma 
subunits (Sankaran, B., Osterhout, J., Wu, D., and Smrcka, A. V. (1998) J. Biol. 
Chem. 273, 7148-7154). We mapped the site for cross-linking of a synthetic 
peptide (N20K) corresponding to this Y domain region to Cys(25) within the 
amino-terminal coiled-coil domain of Gbetagamma (Yoshikawa, D. M., Bresciano, 
K., Hatwar, M., and Smrcka, A. V. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11246-11251). Here, 
further experiments with a series of variable length cross-linking agents 
refined the site of N20K binding to within 4.4-6.7 angstroms of Cys(25). A 
mutant within the amino terminus of the Gbeta subunit, Gbeta(1)(23-27)gamma(2), 
activated PLCbeta2 more effectively than wild type, with no significant change 
in the EC(50), indicating that this region is directly involved in the catalytic 
regulation of PLCbeta2. This mutant was deficient in cross-linking to N20K, 
suggesting that a binding site for the peptide had been eliminated. 
Surprisingly, N20K could still inhibit Gbeta(1)(23-27)gamma(2)-dependent 
activation of PLC, suggesting a second N20K binding site. Competition analysis 
with a peptide that binds to the Galpha subunit switch II binding surface of 
Gbetagamma indicates a second N20K binding site at this surface. Furthermore, 
mutations to the N20K region within the Y-domain of full-length PLCbeta2 
inhibited Gbetagamma-dependent regulation of the enzyme, providing further 
evidence for aGbetagamma binding site within the catalytic domain of PLCbeta2. 
The data support a model with two modes of PLC binding to Gbetagamma through the 
catalytic domain, where interactions with the amino-terminal coiled-coil domain 
are inhibitory, and interactions with the Galpha subunit switch II binding 
surface are stimulatory.
