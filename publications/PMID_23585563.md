The emerging link between iron metabolism and genome integrity is increasingly 
clear. Recent studies have revealed that MMS19 and cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster 
assembly (CIA) factors form a complex and have central roles in CIA pathway. 
However, the composition of the CIA complex, particularly the involvement of the 
Fe-S protein IOP1, is still unclear. The roles of each component are also 
largely unknown. Here, we show that MMS19, MIP18, and CIAO1 form a tight "core" 
complex and that IOP1 is an "external" component of this complex. Although IOP1 
and the core complex form a complex both in vivo and in vitro, IOP1 behaves 
differently in vivo. A deficiency in any core component leads to down-regulation 
of all of the components. In contrast, IOP1 knockdown does not affect the level 
of any core component. In MMS19-overproducing cells, other core components are 
also up-regulated, but the protein level of IOP1 remains unchanged. IOP1 behaves 
like a target protein in the CIA reaction, like other Fe-S helicases, and the 
core complex may participate in the maturation process of IOP1. Alternatively, 
the core complex may catch and hold IOP1 when it becomes mature to prevent its 
degradation. In any case, IOP1 functions in the MMS19-dependent CIA pathway. We 
also reveal that MMS19 interacts with target proteins. MIP18 has a role to 
bridge MMS19 and CIAO1. CIAO1 also binds IOP1. Based on our in vivo and in vitro 
data, new models of the CIA machinery are proposed.
