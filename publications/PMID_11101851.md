co-activator for NOTCH receptors.

Notch receptors are involved in cell-fate determination in organisms as diverse 
as flies, frogs and humans. In Drosophila melanogaster , loss-of-function 
mutations of Notch produce a 'neurogenic' phenotype in which cells destined to 
become epidermis switch fate and differentiate to neural cells. Upon ligand 
activation, the intracellular domain of Notch (ICN) translocates to the nucleus, 
and interacts directly with the DNA-binding protein Suppressor of hairless 
(Su(H)) in flies, or recombination signal binding protein Jkappa (RBP-Jkappa) in 
mammals, to activate gene transcription. But the precise mechanisms of 
Notch-induced gene expression are not completely understood. The gene mastermind 
has been identified in multiple genetic screens for modifiers of Notch mutations 
in Drosophila. Here we clone MAML1, a human homologue of the Drosophila gene 
Mastermind, and show that it encodes a protein of 130 kD localizing to nuclear 
bodies. MAML1 binds to the ankyrin repeat domain of all four mammalian NOTCH 
receptors, forms a DNA-binding complex with ICN and RBP-Jkappa, and amplifies 
NOTCH-induced transcription of HES1. These studies provide a molecular mechanism 
to explain the genetic links between mastermind and Notch in Drosophila and 
indicate that MAML1 functions as a transcriptional co-activator for NOTCH 
signalling.
