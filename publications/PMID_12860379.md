RPB3 is a core subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) that, together with the 
RPB11 subunit, forms the heterodimer considered as a functional counterpart of 
the bacterial alpha subunit homodimer involved in promoter recognition. We 
previously employed the yeast two-hybrid system and identified an interaction 
between RPB3 and the myogenic transcription factor myogenin, demonstrating an 
involvement of this subunit in muscle differentiation. In this paper we report 
the interaction between RPB3 and another known transcription factor, ATF4. We 
found that the intensity of the interaction between RPB3 and ATF4 is similar to 
the one between RPB3 and myogenin. This interaction involves an RPB3 specific 
region not homologous to the prokaryotic alpha subunit. We demonstrated that 
RBP3 is able to enhance ATF4 transactivation, whereas the region of RPB3 (Sud) 
that contacts ATF4, when used as a dominant negative, markedly inhibits ATF4 
transactivation activity. Interestingly, ATF4 protein level, as reported for its 
partner RPB3, increases during C2C7 cell line muscle differentiation.
