We have isolated a cDNA clone from a human skeletal muscle library which 
contains the complete protein-coding sequence of a skeletal muscle 
alpha-tropomyosin. This cDNA sequence defines a fourth human tropomyosin gene, 
the hTM alpha gene, which is distinct from the hTMnm gene encoding a closely 
related isoform of skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin. In cultured human 
fibroblasts, the hTM alpha gene encodes both skeletal-muscle- and 
smooth-muscle-type alpha-tropomyosins by using an alternative mRNA-splicing 
mechanism.
