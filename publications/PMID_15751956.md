Cryptochromes are blue-light photoreceptors that regulate a variety of responses 
such as growth and circadian rhythms in organisms ranging from bacteria to 
humans. Cryptochromes share a high level of sequence identity with the 
light-activated DNA repair enzyme photolyase. Photolyase uses energy from blue 
light to repair UV-induced photoproducts in DNA through cyclic electron transfer 
between the catalytic flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor and the damaged DNA. 
Cryptochromes lack DNA repair activity, and their mechanism of signal 
transduction is not known. It is hypothesized that a light-dependent signaling 
state in cryptochromes is created as a result of an intramolecular redox 
reaction, resulting in conformational rearrangement and effector binding. Plant 
and animal cryptochromes possess 30-250 amino acid carboxy-terminal extensions 
beyond the photolyase-homology region that have been shown to mediate 
phototransduction. We analyzed the structures of C-terminal domains from an 
animal and a plant cryptochrome by computational, biophysical, and biochemical 
methods and found these domains to be intrinsically unstructured. We show that 
the photolyase-homology region interacts with the C-terminal domain, inducing 
stable tertiary structure in the C-terminal domain. Importantly, we demonstrate 
a light-dependent conformational change in the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis 
Cry1. Collectively, these findings provide the first biochemical evidence for 
the proposed conformational rearrangement of cryptochromes upon light exposure.
