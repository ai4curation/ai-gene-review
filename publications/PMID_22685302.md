In the developing nervous system, neuronal growth cones explore the 
extracellular environment for guidance cues, which can guide them along specific 
trajectories toward their targets. Netrin-1, a bifunctional guidance cue, binds 
to deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and DSCAM mediating axon attraction, and 
UNC5 mediating axon repulsion. Here, we show that DSCAM interacts with UNC5C and 
this interaction is stimulated by netrin-1 in primary cortical neurons and 
postnatal cerebellar granule cells. DSCAM partially co-localized with UNC5C in 
primary neurons and brain tissues. Netrin-1 induces axon growth cone collapse of 
mouse cerebellum external granule layer (EGL) cells, and the knockdown of DSCAM 
or UNC5C by specific shRNAs or blocking their signaling by overexpressing 
dominant negative mutants suppresses netrin-1-induced growth cone collapse. 
Similarly, the simultaneous knockdown of DSCAM and UNC5C also blocks 
netrin-1-induced growth cone collapse in EGL cells. Netrin-1 increases tyrosine 
phosphorylation of endogenous DSCAM, UNC5C, FAK, Fyn, and PAK1, and promotes 
complex formation of DSCAM with these signaling molecules in primary postnatal 
cerebellar neurons. Inhibition of Src family kinases efficiently reduces the 
interaction of DSCAM with UNC5C, FAK, Fyn, and PAK1 and tyrosine phosphorylation 
of these proteins as well as growth cone collapse of mouse EGL cells induced by 
netrin-1. The knockdown of DSCAM inhibits netrin-induced tyrosine 
phosphorylation of UNC5C and Fyn as well as the interaction of UNC5C with Fyn. 
The double knockdown of both receptors abolishes the induction of Fyn tyrosine 
phosphorylation by netrin-1. Our study reveals the first evidence that DSCAM 
coordinates with UNC5C in netrin-1 repulsion.
