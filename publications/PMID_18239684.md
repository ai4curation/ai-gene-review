The p27(Kip1) ubiquitin ligase receptor Skp2 is often overexpressed in human 
tumours and displays oncogenic properties. The activity of SCF(Skp2) is 
regulated by the APC(Cdh1), which targets Skp2 for degradation. Here we show 
that Skp2 phosphorylation on Ser64/Ser72 positively regulates its function in 
vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser64, and to a lesser extent Ser72, stabilizes Skp2 by 
interfering with its association with Cdh1, without affecting intrinsic ligase 
activity. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2-mediated phosphorylation of Skp2 on 
Ser64 allows its expression in mid-G1 phase, even in the presence of active 
APC(Cdh1). Reciprocally, dephosphorylation of Skp2 by the mitotic phosphatase 
Cdc14B at the M --> G1 transition promotes its degradation by APC(Cdh1). 
Importantly, lowering the levels of Cdc14B accelerates cell cycle progression 
from mitosis to S phase in an Skp2-dependent manner, demonstrating epistatic 
relationship of Cdc14B and Skp2 in the regulation of G1 length. Thus, our 
results reveal that reversible phosphorylation plays a key role in the timing of 
Skp2 expression in the cell cycle.
