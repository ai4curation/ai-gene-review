The effect of Bcl-xL upon the developmental death of T cells was assessed by 
generating transgenic mice that expressed Bcl-xL within all thymocyte subsets. 
Bcl-xL protected thymocytes from a variety of apoptotic stimuli, including gamma 
irradiation, glucocorticoids, and anti-CD3 treatment. Bcl-xL altered thymocyte 
maturation, resulting in increased numbers of CD3int/hi and CD4-8+ thymocytes. 
Overall, the phenotype of Bcl-xL transgenics was essentially indistinguishable 
from a Bcl-2 transgenic model. Overexpression of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 resulted in the 
down-regulation of the other molecule, providing further evidence of their 
reciprocal regulation. In a genetic test of redundancy, the Bcl-xL transgene 
rescued mature T cells in Bcl-2 null mice. Immunoprecipitation indicated that 
Bcl-xL, like Bcl-2, heterodimerized with the death-promoting molecule Bax in 
thymocytes. This in vivo model argues that Bcl-xL, like Bcl-2, functions in a 
common pathway to repress cell death.
