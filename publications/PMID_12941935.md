All type I DnaJ (Hsp40) homologues share the presence of two highly conserved 
zinc centers. To elucidate their function, we constructed DnaJ mutants that 
separately replaced cysteines of either zinc center I or zinc center II with 
serine residues. We found that in the absence of zinc center I, the autonomous, 
DnaK-independent chaperone activity of DnaJ is dramatically reduced. 
Surprisingly, this only slightly impaired the in vivo function of DnaJ, and its 
ability to function as a co-chaperone in the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE foldase machine. The 
DnaJ zinc center II, on the other hand, was found to be absolutely essential for 
the in vivo and in vitro function of DnaJ. This did not seem to be caused by a 
lack of substrate binding affinity or an inability to work as an 
ATPase-stimulating factor. Rather it appears that zinc center II mutant proteins 
lack a necessary additional interaction site with DnaK, which seems to be 
crucial for locking-in substrate proteins onto DnaK. These findings led us to a 
model in which ATP hydrolysis in DnaK is only the first step in converting DnaK 
into its high affinity binding state. Additional interactions between DnaK and 
DnaJ are required to make the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE foldase machinery catalytically 
active.
