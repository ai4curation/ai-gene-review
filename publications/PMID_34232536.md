Host-virus protein-protein interactions play key roles in the life cycle of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We conducted a 
comprehensive interactome study between the virus and host cells using tandem 
affinity purification and proximity-labeling strategies and identified 437 human 
proteins as the high-confidence interacting proteins. Further characterization 
of these interactions and comparison to other large-scale study of cellular 
responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection elucidated how distinct SARS-CoV-2 viral 
proteins participate in its life cycle. With these data mining, we discovered 
potential drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19. The interactomes of two 
key SARS-CoV-2-encoded viral proteins, NSP1 and N, were compared with the 
interactomes of their counterparts in other human coronaviruses. These 
comparisons not only revealed common host pathways these viruses manipulate for 
their survival, but also showed divergent protein-protein interactions that may 
explain differences in disease pathology. This comprehensive interactome of 
SARS-CoV-2 provides valuable resources for the understanding and treating of 
this disease.
