Although genetic variations in several genes encoding for synaptic adhesion 
proteins have been found to be associated with autism spectrum disorders, one of 
the most consistently replicated genes has been CNTNAP2, encoding for 
contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2), a multidomain transmembrane 
protein of the neurexin superfamily. Using immunofluorescence confocal 
microscopy and complementary biochemical techniques, we compared wild-type 
CASPR2 to 12 point mutations identified in individuals with autism. In contrast 
to the wild-type protein, localized to the cell surface, some of the mutants 
show altered cellular disposition. In particular, CASPR2-D1129H is largely 
retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in HEK-293 cells and in hippocampal 
neurons. BiP/Grp78, Calnexin and ERp57, key ER chaperones, appear to be 
responsible for retention of this mutant and activation of one signaling pathway 
of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The presence of this mutation also 
lowers expression and activates proteosomal degradation. A frame-shift mutation 
that causes a form of syndromic epilepsy (CASPR2-1253*), results in a secreted 
protein with seemingly normal folding and oligomerization. Taken together, these 
data indicate that CASPR2-D1129H has severe trafficking abnormalities and 
CASPR2-1253* is a secreted soluble protein, suggesting that the structural or 
signaling functions of the membrane tethered form are lost. Our data support a 
complex genetic architecture in which multiple distinct risk factors interact 
with others to shape autism risk and presentation.

INTRODUCTION

The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), commonly called autism, are neurodevelopmental conditions that may affect as much as 1% of the population ( 1 , 2 ). Despite an important role of hereditary factors ( 3 ), the genetics of the ASDs is complex ( 4 ), making the identification of susceptibility genes challenging. Based on recent molecular and genetic studies, one of the candidate genes most frequently linked to autism is contactin-associated protein-like 2 ( CNTNAP2 ) ( 5 ). Rare variations at this locus have been implicated in both the ASDs ( 6 – 10 ) and intellectual disability with epilepsy ( 11 – 15 ), as well as Tourette syndrome ( 16 ), Schizophrenia ( 17 ) and ADHD ( 18 ). Similarly, a common variation in this gene has been associated with ASD diagnosis ( 19 ), language performance in both typically developing individuals ( 20 ) and others with language-related disorders ( 21 , 22 ), and aberrations of brain structure and function ( 23 – 25 ).

CASPR2 is a neuronal cell adhesion molecule known in rodents to be necessary in the clustering of the Kv1 potassium channels at juxtaparanodes ( 26 ). In myelinated nerves, CASPR2 is confined to the juxtaparanodal region of the axon where it associates with the immunoglobulin domains of TAG-1 to form a scaffold which clusters the potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 ( 27 – 29 ). Data on the distribution of CASPR2 in pyramidal cells in the human temporal neocortex indicate that CASPR2 is localized at the axon initial segment, a region that is characterized by a high concentration of K + channels ( 30 , 31 ). In rat hippocampal neurons, CASPR2 appears to be predominantly localized in post-synaptic compartments such as cell bodies and dendrites ( 26 ), and it was found in synaptic plasma membranes to be associated with TAG-1 ( 8 ). Yet, work in rat-dissociated hippocampal cultures ( 32 ) and Drosophila points to a presynaptic localization ( 12 ), a finding consistent with its association within the Neurexin superfamily. No information is thus far available on CASPR2 structure, the subtype of synapse to which it localizes or its synaptic function.

In ASD patients, Bakkaloglu et al . ( 8 ) found 11 rare variants, eight of which were predicted to be deleterious because they occurred in evolutionarily conserved regions of the gene (Fig. 1 A). In particular, CASPR2-D1129H was present in monozygotic twins, both affected with autism. Their father, carrying the same mutation, did not have an autism diagnosis. Other studies ( 6 , 11 ) found that individuals homozygous for a rare frame-shift mutation (single-base G deletion at nucleotide 3709 in exon 22) presented cortical dysplasia, focal epilepsy and ASD with language regression. As above, this variant was inherited. A surgical biopsy of the anterior temporal lobe of two children carrying the mutation revealed cortical dysplasia including evidence of abnormalities of neuronal migration, structure and widespread astrogliosis. No information is currently available on the molecular and cellular defects resulting from any of these mutations.

To ascertain whether the reported autism-related mutations ( 6 , 8 , 11 ) are benign polymorphisms or may affect the structure and expression of the protein, we studied the glycosylation processing and subcellular localization of the wild type and mutants. We also measured their rates of degradation and ascertained that the unfolded protein response (UPR) was activated through ATF6. We found that CASPR2-D1129H is arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and found associated with chaperons BiP, Calnexin and ERp57, leading to stimulation of the UPR and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In contrast, CASPR2-1253* folds properly, but is secreted in the extracellular space. Our results support a disease model in which multiple distinct factors, genetic and environmental, may be critical contributors to the disease outcome and as such must be considered in looking forward towards treatment.

DISCUSSION

Homozygous mutations in CNTNAP2 give rise to severe neurodevelopmental disorders that include cortico-dysplasia-focal epilepsy ( 6 ) and Pitt–Hopkins Syndrome ( 12 ). Surprisingly, striking parallels exist between behavioral and neuropathological features in humans and mice ( 43 ) homozygous for disruptive mutations in CNTNAP2 . We sought here to explore whether candidate human mutations might have distinctive phenotypes at the molecular and cellular levels. We characterized the subcellular localization of all of the point mutations observed in patients to date, and present a detailed analysis of two of these.

We find that D1129H causes significantly lower protein expression of CASPR2 and retention of the protein in the ER with an accompanying loss of mature glycosylation processing (Figs 1 and 2 ), indicating a folding impairment in the LNS4 domains of CASPR2. Three transmembrane ER proteins, PERK (PKR-like ER kinase), IRE1 (inositol-requiring kinase 1) and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6), sense protein misfolding and initiate an ER-to-nucleus signaling cascade known as the UPR. This signaling pathway tries to reestablish folding homeostasis by inducing the expression of chaperones that enhance protein folding. At the same time, global protein translation is attenuated to reduce the folding load in the ER, while the proteosomal degradation rate is increased ( 44 ). We show here that CASPR2-D1129H, but not wild type, causes a significant activation of ATF6, indicating that overexpression of the mutant protein promotes activation of a protective cellular response (Fig. 5 C) possibly through binding with BiP, Calnexin and ERp57 (Fig. 5 A). In addition to its role as a folding chaperone, BiP also functions as an ER stress regulator: normally BiP is bound to PERK, ATF6 and IRE1, thus blocking their activation. However, in the presence of misfolded proteins, BiP remains associated with them allowing the three branches of UPR (PERK, TF6 and IRE1) to be activated (extensively reviewed in ( 44 )). Importantly, prolonged activation of the UPR caused by unmitigated ER stress may lead to profound alterations of neuronal function or even cell death ( 45 ). Interestingly, a link between UPR and ASD has been recently described for mutations in the synaptic cell adhesion molecule-1, a membrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ( 46 ). Our data provide a first link between CASPR2 mutations and the UPR. Since only one signaling pathway of considerable complexity has been investigated, other studies warrant consideration. The surprisingly short half-life of CASPR2, alone or in combination with TAG1, suggests that these adhesion proteins are rapidly inserted in the cell membrane and internalized for degradation. Compared with the relatively long half-life of synaptic NLGN4 (Fig. 4 C) or NLGN3 ( 35 ), CASPR2 and TAG1 may participate in more rapid turnover processes in the central nervous system. As hypothesized above, our results are consistent with the notion that the CASPR2-WT protein may be a modulator of structural reorganization of the synapse, as observed for other neurexin superfamily members ( 41 , 42 ).

Because a high-resolution crystal structure of CASPR2 is not available, we built homology models of the LNS4 domain, and to improve the robustness of the predictions, we used four different structural templates (see the materials and Methods section). These models enabled us to inspect the structure of LNS4 of CASPR2 and the three-dimensional environment where D1129 is located. In all models examined, D1129 is in a basic environment closely surrounded by two histidines (H1113 and H1130), R1105 and the backbone nitrogen of S1114 with which the terminal carboxylic group of D1129 side chain may form an electrostatic interaction or hydrogen-bonding network to tighten interactions between β-strands (Fig. 6 ). In particular, whereas H1130 assumes slightly different orientations depending on the modeling template (not shown), D1129 and H1113 are always in the same reciprocal orientation as shown in Figure 6 . The in silico mutagenesis function in Pymol ( 47 ) enabled us to compare these structural models with our experimental results. In all models tested, and consistent with our experimental findings, Asp to His substitution causes a major clash with the H1113 ring, as exemplified by the red disks between the two side chains. Because maintaining this orientation seems to be forbidden, we predict that H1129 assumes other poses that may be incompatible with the local folding of this loop. The same holds true for D1129E that shows significant steric hindrance with H1113. The Asn substitution is the most benign (little to no steric clash, distances similar to Asp side chain and the possibility to form hydrogen bonds, are all conserved features). Although D1129A substitution does not seem to be sterically prohibited, the mutated protein shows severe trafficking abnormalities. As visible in the model (lower right panel), this variant probably lacks the ability to make an electrostatic interaction or form a hydrogen bond with its surroundings, eventually resulting in loop instability. Thus, substitution of the Asp with the introduction of a His or other amino acids may disrupt an established charge relationship or hydrogen bonding, likely affecting local protein folding, giving rise to the processing defects described here.

Taken together, these results highlight the following overall mechanism underlying the fate of Caspr2-D1129H: the amino acid substitution causes a local misfolding in LNS4. BiP and other ER chaperones remain bound to the mutant (Fig. 5 A) causing the protein to remain in the ER (Figs 1 – 3 ). As BiP is not available to suppress ATF6 and other UPR activators, the UPR is triggered (Fig. 5 C) and the protein is eventually degraded by the proteosomal pathway (Fig. 5 B).

A second mutation, a 3709delG in exon 22 of CNTNAP2 gene that results in a premature stop codon at position 1253, was described independently by Strauss et al . ( 6 ) and Jackman et al . ( 11 ) in the Old Amish population. Although we cannot test whether this mutation targets the mRNA for the nonsense-mediated decay in vivo ( 37 , 38 ), our experiments indicate that the disease-associated 3709delG mutant is not prematurely degraded by the ERAD ( 39 ) because it is rapidly secreted (Figs 1 B, C and 3 B). This also shows that the premature stop codon does not interfere with proper domain folding as is the case for other proteins such as neuroligin-4 ( 48 ). Biophysical characterization of α-neurexin 1 (αNRXN1) ( 49 , 50 ), another member of the neurexin superfamily to which CASPR2 belongs, indicates that the extracellular domain of αNRXN1 is monomeric in solution with an elongated shape. Gel filtration profiles of αNRXN1 ( 49 ) and the two CASPR2 constructs shown here, developed in the same laboratory, indicate that their extracellular domains are likely monomeric, despite the sequence of 16 C-terminal residues that differ in CASPR2-1253* from the wild-type protein. Furthermore, although the immunofluorescence data show that CASPR2-1253* is largely localized in the ER, the kinetic data indicate that the bulk of CASPR2-1253* is not retained in this compartment but is readily secreted. Thus, recycling and degradation machineries that would trigger the UPR are likely not impacted by this mutation.

Based on Endo-H and immunofluorescence data for an additional ten variants examined, we find that each mutation affects CASPR2 subcellular localization to different degrees. Analogous amino acid changes (I869T, I1253T and I1278T) do not result in a common biochemical phenotype, but this is not surprising, given that phenotypic consequences are dependent on the immediate three-dimensional surrounding of the amino acid side chain rather than on the chemical properties of the amino acid. For example, whereas I869 is in one of the predicted LNS domains, I1253 is in a predicted unstructured domain and I1278 is buried in the transmembrane domain. Moreover, because only a subset of the variants we analyzed appear to impact trafficking, it remains possible that some will influence association with protein partners like TAG1 or other ligands molecules yet to be discovered.

The CNTNAP2 gene contains an extensive number of mutations associated with ASD ( 6 , 8 , 11 ), and to our knowledge, these are the first mutants that have been linked to aberrations in protein trafficking. Compared with some of the known neuroligin mutations ( 40 , 35 , 51 ) CASPR2-D1129H seems to have several common features. These mutant proteins appear to have reduced glycosylation processing accompanied by ER retention and abnormal subcellular localization in both HEK-293 cells and neurons. Although a wealth of information is available on the phenotype with a complete lack of CASPR2 ( CNTANP2 −/− mouse) ( 27 , 43 ), it would be interesting to ascertain whether the presence of a soluble CASPR2 can affect neuronal maturation and migration by competitive antagonism of the membrane-associated orthologous protein. The processing and trafficking assays we have employed cannot speak to how individual variants impact behavior, but do serve as a means of assessing whether such candidate mutations have biochemical consequences. We show here that CNTNAP2 inherited variants perturb CASPR2 trafficking and activate an ER stress response. Incomplete penetrance was observed for all CASPR2 variants studied here, with presentation in heterozygous carriers ranging from severe to apparently unaffected ( 6 , 8 ). Although patients homozygous for the CASPR2-1253 all function at a very low level ( 6 ), individuals homozygous for the other variants we evaluated have yet to be identified. As such, the cellular readouts presented here provide important insights into the potential consequences of individual variants, information that cannot currently be inferred from work in humans. Our data highlight an imperfect relationship between genetic variation, cellular consequences, and clinical outcomes and require a model in which multiple distinct factors, genetic and environmental, converge to shape risk and presentation.
