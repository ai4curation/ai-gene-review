EIN2, the central regulator of ethylene signalling, is localized at the ER 
membrane where it interacts with the ethylene receptor ETR1.

Genetic studies have identified the membrane protein EIN2 (ethylene insensitive 
2) as a central component of ethylene signalling in Arabidopsis. In addition, 
EIN2 might take part in multiple hormone signalling pathways and in response to 
pathogens as demonstrated by recent genetic and biochemical studies. Here we 
show, by an integrated approach using in vivo and in vitro fluorescence 
techniques, that EIN2 is localized at the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) membrane 
where it shows specific interaction with the ethylene receptor protein ETR1.
