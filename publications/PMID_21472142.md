Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor, arising from 
aberrant cerebellar precursors' development, a process mainly controlled by 
Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Histone deacetylase HDAC1 has been recently 
shown to modulate Hh signaling, deacetylating its effectors Gli1/2 and enhancing 
their transcriptional activity. Therefore, HDAC may represent a potential 
therapeutic target for Hh-dependent tumors, but still little information is 
available on the physiological mechanisms of HDAC regulation. The putative tumor 
suppressor REN(KCTD11) acts through ubiquitination-dependent degradation of 
HDAC1, thereby affecting Hh activity and medulloblastoma growth. We identify and 
characterize here two REN(KCTD11) homologues, defining a new family of proteins 
named KCASH, as "KCTD containing, Cullin3 adaptor, suppressor of Hedgehog." 
Indeed, the novel genes (KCASH2(KCTD21) and KCASH3(KCTD6)) share with 
REN(KCTD11) a number of features, such as a BTB domain required for the 
formation of a Cullin3 ubiquitin ligase complex and HDAC1 ubiquitination and 
degradation capability, suppressing the acetylation-dependent Hh/Gli signaling. 
Expression of KCASH2 and -3 is observed in cerebellum, whereas epigenetic 
silencing and allelic deletion are observed in human medulloblastoma. Rescuing 
KCASHs expression reduces the Hedgehog-dependent medulloblastoma growth, 
suggesting that loss of members of this novel family of native HDAC inhibitors 
is crucial in sustaining Hh pathway-mediated tumorigenesis. Accordingly, they 
might represent a promising class of endogenous "agents" through which this 
pathway may be targeted.
