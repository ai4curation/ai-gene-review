The gut epithelium self-renews every several days, providing an important innate 
defense system that limits bacterial colonization. Nevertheless, many bacterial 
pathogens, including Shigella, efficiently colonize the intestinal epithelium. 
Here, we show that the Shigella effector IpaB, when delivered into epithelial 
cells, causes cell-cycle arrest by targeting Mad2L2, an anaphase-promoting 
complex/cyclosome (APC) inhibitor. Cyclin B1 ubiquitination assays revealed that 
APC undergoes unscheduled activation due to IpaB interaction with the APC 
inhibitor Mad2L2. Synchronized HeLa cells infected with Shigella failed to 
accumulate Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1, causing cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M 
phase in an IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent manner. IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent cell-cycle 
arrest by Shigella infection was also demonstrated in rabbit intestinal crypt 
progenitors, and the IpaB-mediated arrest contributed to efficient colonization 
of the host cells. These results strongly indicate that Shigella employ special 
tactics to influence epithelial renewal in order to promote bacterial 
colonization of intestinal epithelium.
