The crystal structure of the DNA complex of a STAT-1 homodimer has been 
determined at 2.9 A resolution. STAT-1 utilizes a DNA-binding domain with an 
immunoglobulin fold, similar to that of NFkappaB and the p53 tumor suppressor 
protein. The STAT-1 dimer forms a contiguous C-shaped clamp around DNA that is 
stabilized by reciprocal and highly specific interactions between the SH2 domain 
of one monomer and the C-terminal segment, phosphorylated on tyrosine, of the 
other. The phosphotyrosine-binding site of the SH2 domain in each monomer is 
coupled structurally to the DNA-binding domain, suggesting a potential role for 
the SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction in the stabilization of DNA interacting 
elements.
