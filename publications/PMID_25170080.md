HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, in 
part due to an altered high density lipoprotein profile exacerbated by 
down-modulation and impairment of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) 
activity by the HIV-1 protein Nef. However, the mechanisms of this Nef effect 
remain unknown. Here, we show that Nef interacts with an endoplasmic reticulum 
chaperone calnexin, which regulates folding and maturation of glycosylated 
proteins. Nef disrupted interaction between calnexin and ABCA1 but increased 
affinity and enhanced interaction of calnexin with HIV-1 gp160. The Nef mutant 
that did not bind to calnexin did not affect the calnexin-ABCA1 interaction. 
Interaction with calnexin was essential for functionality of ABCA1, as knockdown 
of calnexin blocked the ABCA1 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, reduced ABCA1 
abundance, and inhibited cholesterol efflux; the same effects were observed 
after Nef overexpression. However, the effects of calnexin knockdown and Nef on 
cholesterol efflux were not additive; in fact, the combined effect of these two 
factors together did not differ significantly from the effect of calnexin 
knockdown alone. Interestingly, gp160 and ABCA1 interacted with calnexin 
differently; although gp160 binding to calnexin was dependent on glycosylation, 
glycosylation was of little importance for the interaction between ABCA1 and 
calnexin. Thus, Nef regulates the activity of calnexin to stimulate its 
interaction with gp160 at the expense of ABCA1. This study identifies a 
mechanism for Nef-dependent inactivation of ABCA1 and dysregulation of 
cholesterol metabolism.

HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, in part due to an altered high density lipoprotein profile exacerbated by down-modulation and impairment of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) activity by the HIV-1 protein Nef. However, the mechanisms of this Nef effect remain unknown.

Thus, Nef regulates the activity of calnexin to stimulate its interaction with gp160 at the expense of ABCA1. This study identifies a mechanism for Nef-dependent inactivation of ABCA1 and dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism.

Introduction

HIV-1 infection is associated with a high risk of developing atherosclerosis ( 1 ), and studies in animal models and in vitro demonstrated that Nef-mediated impairment of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) 3 function may contribute to this side effect of HIV infection ( 2 – 4 ). ABCA1 mediates transport of cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which is the initial step in the process of reverse cholesterol transport and HDL formation ( 5 ). Nef-mediated inactivation of ABCA1 causes accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages, increases the abundance of lipid rafts (sites of HIV assembly), and elevates cholesterol content of viral membranes, thus increasing HIV production and infectivity ( 2 , 6 – 8 ). Another consequence of this activity is impairment of HDL maturation ( 3 ), which may be responsible for low HDL levels, an established risk factor for atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients ( 9 ).

Nef down-modulates a number of cell surface transmembrane proteins, such as CD4, MHC-I, MHC-II, transferrin receptor, mannose receptor, CD80, CD86, CD8, and CCR5, by modifying their intracellular trafficking and targeting them to various degradation pathways ( 10 , 11 ). The common mechanism behind this activity of Nef is binding to the target protein and connecting it to adaptor proteins, which direct the complex to degradation pathways. Nef has been shown to interact with ABCA1 ( 2 , 12 ); however, this interaction was dispensable for Nef-mediated ABCA1 down-modulation and functional impairment ( 13 ), suggesting that an alternative mechanism is responsible for target protein inactivation in this case. In this study, we demonstrate that Nef affects ABCA1 activity by disrupting its interaction with calnexin.

Calnexin is an integral ER membrane calcium-binding lectin-like chaperone that binds immature glycoproteins destined for the plasma membrane, and supports folding and maturation of these proteins. Calnexin and calreticulin function as partner chaperones in the ER protein production, stabilization, and folding cycle ( 14 ). Calnexin is membrane-bound and chaperones predominantly membrane glycoproteins, whereas calreticulin is soluble and chaperones soluble proteins, although association between calreticulin and HIV-1 gp160 (a transmembrane protein) has been reported ( 15 ). It has been suggested that calnexin may stabilize glycoproteins through a dual-binding mode involving glycan and peptide binding or through either single binding mode (glycan residue or peptide binding) independently ( 16 , 17 ). Although interaction between ABCA1 and calnexin has not been characterized, and the role of calnexin in ABCA1 functionality remains unknown, members of nearly every other subclass of ABC transporters, including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, MDR1), ABCB2 (TAP1), ABCB3 (TAP2), ABCC2, ABCC7 (CFTR), and ABCG5/G8, have been demonstrated to interact with calnexin, and among these are examples of glycan-dependent and -independent interactions ( 18 – 23 ). Importantly, calnexin was shown to contribute to the functionality of ABC transporters, as exemplified by CFTR and P-glycoproteins, which lost their functional activity when interaction with calnexin was impaired by mutations ( 24 , 25 ).

Calnexin has also been shown to interact with HIV-1 gp160 ( 15 , 26 , 27 ). Interaction between gp160 and calnexin was found to be dependent on N -linked glycosylation of gp160 and was inhibited by tunicamycin ( 26 ). By analogy with its role in maturation of other glycosylated proteins in the ER, calnexin is assumed to assist folding of gp160 ( 28 ), although a direct effect of calnexin on gp160 functionality has not been demonstrated.

Here, we provide evidence that functionality of ABCA1 depends on calnexin. Nef binds calnexin and disrupts its interaction with ABCA1. This novel mechanism of action contributes to the effect of Nef on cellular cholesterol efflux.

DISCUSSION

In this report, we describe a novel mechanism by which Nef interferes with activity of a host cell protein ABCA1, which is essential for the first step of reverse cholesterol transport, cholesterol efflux. We demonstrate that Nef binds to endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin and disrupts its interaction with ABCA1, leading to retention of this transporter in the ER and its eventual degradation. Importantly, Nef does not indiscriminately disrupt all calnexin interactions, as interaction between calnexin and HIV-1 Env, which is critical for proper Env maturation and functionality ( 28 ), was actually stimulated by Nef.

This study provides the first characterization of the ABCA1-calnexin interaction. In fact, nothing is known about the role of calnexin in maturation of ABCA family members. Our data suggest that the interaction between ABCA1 and calnexin is glycan-independent and likely involves a peptide-binding mechanism of calnexin interaction with target proteins. In fact, it appears that calnexin interaction with nonglycosylated ABCA1 is stronger than with glycosylated protein ( Fig. 1 C ), suggesting that affinity of calnexin-ABCA1 interaction is reduced by glycosylation. Glycan-independent interaction with calnexin is not unique to ABCA1, as another ABC transporter, ABCB1/P-glycoprotein, has been reported to interact with calnexin via a lectin-independent mechanism that involves the transmembrane regions of P-glycoprotein ( 18 , 25 ). It is possible that the ABCA1-calnexin interaction also involves transmembrane regions of ABCA1. In contrast, interaction of calnexin with gp160 depends on glycosylation (this study and Ref. 26 ), suggesting that Nef binding to calnexin may induce a conformational change that promotes calnexin interaction with glycans but inhibits peptide recognition. Alternatively, Nef may compete with ABCA1 for binding to calnexin, although this mechanism appears less likely given that Nef has not been reported to enter the lumen of the ER, where calnexin N- and P-domains responsible for most of interactions of this protein are located ( 41 ). The extensive list of ABC transporters interacting with calnexin, some via a glycan-independent mechanism, indicates that calnexin functions as a prototypical chaperone for membrane glycoproteins of the ABC superfamily and suggests that these proteins may represent heretofore unappreciated targets of HIV-1 Nef.

Calnexin knockdown or Nef expression increased ABCA1 association with ER, reduced ABCA1 abundance, and inhibited ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux. This result suggests that calnexin functions as an ABCA1 quality-control chaperone that increases ABCA1 cholesterol efflux activity. Interestingly, similar retention of ABCA1 in the ER was described for one of the ABCA1 mutants responsible for Tangier disease ( 33 , 42 ). HIV-1 Nef exploits this requirement for ABCA1 interaction with calnexin to reduce ABCA1 function. The essential role of Nef-mediated disruption of calnexin-ABCA1 interaction in the overall effect of Nef on cholesterol efflux is demonstrated by the lack of significant difference between the effects of Nef and Nef + siRNA CNX , whereas the individual effects of both Nef and siRNA CNX were highly significant ( Fig. 6 , B and C ). The overall effect of Nef is to retain ABCA1 in the ER with subsequent delivery to proteasomes ( 13 ).

Intriguingly, while disrupting calnexin interaction with ABCA1, Nef stimulates the calnexin-gp160 interaction. Functional relevance of this effect of calnexin for HIV-1 replication remains to be determined, but previous reports indicate that calnexin is essential for gp160 maturation ( 28 ). We propose the following model for calnexin-related effects of Nef ( Fig. 7 ). In uninfected cells, calnexin can interact with proteins undergoing post-translational modifications within the ER, either through peptide-dependent binding or through glycan recognition. Newly synthesized ABCA1 interacts with calnexin via a peptide-dependent mechanism. Calnexin exerts a rigorous quality control facilitating folding of a functional ABCA1, which is directed to the plasma membrane. Dysfunctional ABCA1 (misfolded or improperly glycosylated molecules) is directed to degradation in proteasomes ( 43 ). In HIV-infected cells, Nef binds to calnexin and changes its interaction affinities, promoting interaction with gp160 while impairing interaction with ABCA1. This prevents calnexin from exercising its chaperone function on ABCA1 but enhances its activity on gp160. As a result, Env maturation may be optimized while that of ABCA1 is impaired, leading to retention of ABCA1 in the ER and its subsequent degradation. Nef may also stimulate internalization and lysosomal degradation of cell surface ABCA1 ( 7 ). The proposed model is in part speculative, as not all of its elements have been proven; however, it is consistent with our findings and those of others.

A possible mechanism for such a differential effect of Nef on calnexin interactions is a conformational change in calnexin, which stimulates recognition of glycans but inhibits peptide recognition. Ongoing structural studies will test this hypothesis. Calnexin is a particularly good target for Nef because interfering with the function of this chaperone would allow Nef to modulate membrane expression of a variety of host cell proteins. This effect of Nef on calnexin interactions with cellular proteins may be part of the viral strategy to ensure the availability of calnexin and to optimize its function to assist in the maturation and folding of viral Env proteins.

In summary, the results presented in this report demonstrate that Nef stimulates interaction between calnexin and gp160 at the expense of the physiological target of calnexin, ABCA1, and identify a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 Nef influences activity of viral and host cell proteins by modulating their interaction with calnexin. The effect of Nef on calnexin provides a mechanism for the previously described Nef-mediated impairment of cellular cholesterol efflux, which leads to disruption of HDL maturation, retention of cellular cholesterol, increased abundance of lipid rafts, and enhanced virus production and fusion capacity of the virions.
