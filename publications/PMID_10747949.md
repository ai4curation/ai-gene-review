We have isolated and characterized a novel iron-regulated gene that is 
homologous to the divalent metal transporter 1 family of metal transporters. 
This gene, termed metal transporter protein (mtp1), is expressed in tissues 
involved in body iron homeostasis including the developing and mature 
reticuloendothelial system, the duodenum, and the pregnant uterus. MTP1 is also 
expressed in muscle and central nervous system cells in the embryo. At the 
subcellular level, MTP1 is localized to the basolateral membrane of the duodenal 
epithelial cell and a cytoplasmic compartment of reticuloendothelial system 
cells. Overexpression of MTP1 in tissue culture cells results in intracellular 
iron depletion. In the adult mouse, MTP1 expression in the liver and duodenum 
are reciprocally regulated. Iron deficiency induces MTP1 expression in the 
duodenum but down-regulates expression in the liver. These data indicate that 
MTP1 is an iron-regulated membrane-spanning protein that is involved in 
intracellular iron metabolism.
