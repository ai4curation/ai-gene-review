NM23/NDP kinases play an important role in development and cancer but their 
biological function is unknown, despite an intriguing collection of biochemical 
properties including nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase), DNA binding and 
transcription, a mutator function, and cleavage of unusually structured DNA by 
means of a covalent enzyme-DNA complex. To assess the role of the nuclease in 
human NM23-H2, we sought to identify the amino acid responsible for covalent 
catalysis. By sequencing a DNA-linked peptide and by site-directed mutagenesis, 
we identified lysine-12, a phylogenetically conserved residue, as the amino acid 
forming the covalent complex with DNA. In particular, the epsilon-amino group 
acts as the critical nucleophile, because substitution with glutamine but not 
arginine completely abrogated covalent adduct formation and DNA cleavage, 
whereas the DNA-binding properties remained intact. These findings and chemical 
modification data suggest that phosphodiester-bond cleavage occurs by a DNA 
glycosylase/lyase-like mechanism known as the signature of base excision DNA 
repair nucleases. Involvement of NM23/NDP kinase in a DNA repair pathway would 
be consistent with its role in normal and tumor cell development. Additionally, 
lysine-12, which is known in the x-ray crystallographic structure to lie in the 
catalytic pocket involved in the NDP kinase phosphorylation reaction, was found 
essential also for the NDP kinase activity of NM23-H2, suggesting that the two 
catalytic activities of NM23-H2 are fundamentally connected.
