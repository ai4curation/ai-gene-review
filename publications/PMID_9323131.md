The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) communicates with the nucleus through the 
unfolded protein response (UPR), which senses accumulation of unfolded proteins 
in the ER lumen and leads to increased transcription of genes encoding 
ER-resident chaperones. As a key regulatory step in this signaling pathway, the 
mRNA encoding the UPR-specific transcription factor Hac1p becomes spliced by a 
unique mechanism that requires tRNA ligase but not the spliceosome. Splicing is 
initiated upon activation of Ire1p, a transmembrane kinase that lies in the ER 
and/or inner nuclear membrane. We show that Ire1p is a bifunctional enzyme: in 
addition to being a kinase, it is a site-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves 
HAC1 mRNA specifically at both splice junctions. The addition of purified tRNA 
ligase completes splicing; we therefore have reconstituted HAC1 mRNA splicing in 
vitro from purified components.
