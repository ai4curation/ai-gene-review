An activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site (consensus sequence 
5'-GTGACGTACAG-3') is a promoter element present in a wide variety of viral and 
cellular genes. The two best-characterized classes of genes that contain ATF 
sites are E1A-inducible adenoviral genes and cAMP-inducible cellular genes. 
Here, we report the isolation of eight ATF cDNA clones, each of which is derived 
from a separate gene. All ATF cDNA clones examined contain a leucine zipper 
motif and are significantly similar to one another only within this region. The 
leucine zipper region of ATF proteins is also similar to that of the AP-1/c-jun 
family of transcription factors, whose DNA-binding site differs from the 
ATF-binding site at a single position. DNA binding studies reveal two mechanisms 
for generating further diversity from the ATF proteins. First, some, but not 
all, combinations of ATF proteins form heterodimers that efficiently bind to 
DNA. Second, although all ATF proteins bind to the ATF site, their precise 
interactions with DNA differ from one another, as evidenced by methylation 
interference analysis. Our results help to explain how a single promoter 
element, an ATF site, can be present in a wide variety of promoters.
