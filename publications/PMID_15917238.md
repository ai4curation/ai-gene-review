Fas (CD95) mediates apoptosis of many cell types, but the susceptibility of 
cells to killing by Fas ligand and anti-Fas antibodies is highly variable. 
Jurkat T cells lacking CD47 (integrin-associated protein) are relatively 
resistant to Fas-mediated death but are efficiently killed by Fas ligand or 
anti-Fas IgM (CH11) upon expression of CD47. Lack of CD47 impairs events 
downstream of Fas activation including caspase activation, poly-(ADP-ribose) 
polymerase cleavage, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, loss of 
mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA cleavage. Neither CD47 signaling nor 
raft association of CD47 is required to enable Fas apoptosis. CH11 induces 
association of Fas and CD47. Primary T cells from CD47-null mice are also 
protected from Fas-mediated killing relative to wild type T cells. Thus CD47 
associates with Fas upon its activation and augments Fas-mediated apoptosis.
