A region in the C-terminus of adenovirus 2/5 E1a protein is required for 
association with a cellular phosphoprotein and important for the negative 
modulation of T24-ras mediated transformation, tumorigenesis and metastasis.

We have examined a series of small deletion mutants within exon 2 of the 
adenovirus 2/5 E1A oncogene product, the 243R protein, for immortalization, ras 
cooperative transformation, tumorigenesis and metastasis. Compared with 
wild-type 243R, various deletion mutants located between residues 193 and 243 
cooperated more efficiently with ras to induce large transformed foci of less 
adherent cells that were tumorigenic and metastatic. However, the greatest 
enhancement of transformation (comparable to that obtained with a deletion of 
the C-terminal 67 amino acids) was observed with a mutant carrying a deletion of 
residues 225-238. This mutant was also more defective in immortalization. These 
results suggest that this 14 amino acid region may contain a function that is 
important for immortalization and negative modulation of tumorigenesis and 
metastasis. To identify cellular proteins that may associate with the exon 
2-coded region of E1A (C-terminal half) and modulate its transformation 
potential, we constructed a chimeric gene coding for the C-terminal 68 amino 
acids of E1a fused to bacterial glutathione-S-transferase (GST). This fusion 
protein was used to purify cellular proteins that bind to the C-terminal region 
of E1a. A 48 kDa cellular protein doublet (designated CtBP) was found to bind 
specifically to the GST-E1a C-terminal fusion protein as well as to bacterially 
expressed full-length E1a (243R) protein. It also co-immunoprecipitated 
specifically with E1a. Analysis of a panel of GST-E1a C-terminal mutant proteins 
indicates that residues 225-238 are required for the association of E1a and 
CtBP, suggesting a correlation between the association of CtBP and the 
immortalization and transformation modulating activities of exon 2. CtBP is a 
phosphoprotein and the level of phosphorylation of CtBP appears to be regulated 
during the cell cycle, suggesting that it may play an important role during 
cellular proliferation.
