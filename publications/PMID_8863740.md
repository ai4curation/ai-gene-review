The zincins are a superfamily of structurally-related Zn(2+)-binding 
metallopeptidases which play a major role in a wide range of biological 
processes including pattern formation, growth factor activation and 
extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation. In this paper we report the 
identification and complete primary structure of a novel 33 kDa protein which 
contains the zinc-binding HEXXH motif found in the zincin superfamily. We have 
named this novel protein PRSM1 (PRoteaSe, Metallo, number 1). The gene was 
identified by the immunoscreening of a human placental cDNA library using 
polyclonal antibodies raised to the 70 kDa human matrix metalloendopeptidase, 
type III procollagen N-proteinase [Halila, R. and Peltonen, L. (1986) 
Purification of human procollagen type III N-proteinase from placenta and 
preparation of antiserum. Biochem. J. 239, 47-52]. The protein is found in 
placenta and cultured osteosarcoma cells. PRSM1 could share sequence homology 
with the type III procollagen N-proteinase. The prsm1 gene is represented once 
in the human genome and is localized on chromosome 16 (q24.3).
