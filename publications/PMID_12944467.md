The Werner syndrome protein (WRN) is a caretaker of the human genome, and the 
Abl kinase is a regulator of the DNA damage response. Aberrant DNA repair has 
been linked to the development of cancer. Here, we have identified a direct 
binding between WRN and c-Abl in vitro via the N-terminal and central regions of 
WRN and the Src homology domain 3 of c-Abl. After bleomycin treatment in 
culture, WRN and c-Abl are dissociated and followed by an Abl kinase-dependent 
WRN relocalization to the nucleoplasm. WRN is a substrate of c-Abl in vitro and 
in vivo. WRN is tyrosine phosphorylated either transiently by treatment of HeLa 
cells with bleomycin or constitutively in cells from chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) patients, and these phosphorylations are prevented by treatment with the 
Abl kinase inhibitor STI-571. Tyrosine phosphorylation of WRN results in 
inhibition of both WRN exonuclease and helicase activities. Furthermore, 
anti-WRN immunoprecipitates from CML cells treated with STI-571 show increased 
3'-->5' exonuclease activity. These findings suggest a novel signaling pathway 
by which c-Abl mediates WRN nuclear localization and catalytic activities in 
response to DNA damage.
