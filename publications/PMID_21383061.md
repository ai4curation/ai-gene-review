Wnt proteins control multiple cell behaviors during development and tissue 
homeostasis. However, pathological activation of Wnt signaling is the underlying 
cause of various human diseases. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays important 
regulatory functions within the Wnt pathway by regulating the activity of 
several of its core components. Hence, multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases have been 
implicated in its regulation. Less is known, however, about the role of 
ubiquitin-specific proteases in Wnt signaling. Analysis of purified 
axin-containing protein complexes by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry revealed the presence of the ubiquitin protease USP34. Our results 
indicate that USP34 functions downstream of the β-catenin destruction complex to 
control the stability of axin and opposes its tankyrase-dependent 
ubiquitination. Reflecting on the requirement for tight control of axin 
homeostasis during Wnt signaling, interfering with USP34 function by RNA 
interference leads to the degradation of axin and to the inhibition of 
β-catenin-mediated transcription. Given the numerous human diseases exhibiting 
spurious Wnt pathway activation, the development of USP34 inhibitors may offer a 
novel therapeutic opportunity.
