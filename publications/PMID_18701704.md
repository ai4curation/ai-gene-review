Autophagy is a diverse family of processes that transport cytoplasm and 
organelles into the lysosome/vacuole lumen for degradation. During 
macroautophagy cargo is packaged in autophagosomes that fuse with the 
lysosome/vacuole. During microautophagy cargo is directly engulfed by the 
lysosome/vacuole membrane. Piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus (PMN) occurs 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at nucleus-vacuole (NV) junctions and results in the 
pinching-off and release into the vacuole of nonessential portions of the 
nucleus. Previous studies concluded macroautophagy ATG genes are not absolutely 
required for PMN. Here we report using two biochemical assays that PMN is 
efficiently inhibited in atg mutant cells: PMN blebs are produced, but vesicles 
are rarely released into the vacuole lumen. Electron microscopy of arrested PMN 
structures in atg7, atg8, and atg9 mutant cells suggests that 
NV-junction-associated micronuclei may normally be released from the nucleus 
before their complete enclosure by the vacuole membrane. In this regard PMN is 
similar to the microautophagy of peroxisomes (micropexophagy), where the side of 
the peroxisome opposite the engulfing vacuole is capped by a structure called 
the "micropexophagy-specific membrane apparatus" (MIPA). The MIPA contains Atg 
proteins and facilitates terminal enclosure and fusion steps. PMN does not 
require the complete vacuole homotypic fusion genes. We conclude that a spectrum 
of ATG genes is required for the terminal vacuole enclosure and fusion stages of 
PMN.
