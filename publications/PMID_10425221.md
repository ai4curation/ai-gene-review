In this study, we identified a novel splice variant of 70-kDa heat shock cognate 
protein (HSC70), while screening differentially expressed molecules in rat brain 
after chronic antidepressant treatment. This clone, named HSC49, lacked 470 bp 
of nucleotides of rat HSC70. HSC49 encoded 442 amino acid residues with a 
calculated molecular mass of 48.6 kDa. DNA sequence analysis revealed that HSC49 
lacked the entire Exon 7 and Exon 8 of the HSC70 gene. Chronic treatment with 
antidepressant, imipramine or sertraline, induced a 38.5 or 22.5% increase in 
mRNA levels in rat frontal cortex, respectively, when compared to controls. 
Western blot analysis also revealed that the protein expression of HSC49 was 
increased after antidepressant treatment. Our data suggest that HSC49 may be one 
of the common molecules induced after chronic antidepressant treatment.
