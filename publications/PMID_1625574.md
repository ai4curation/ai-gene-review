A novel gene, IRE1, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned through genetic 
complementation of a myoinositol auxotrophic mutant. The predicted amino acid 
sequence indicated that IRE1 encodes a protein of 126983 Da with two highly 
hydrophobic regions, probably a signal sequence and a membrane-spanning region. 
The carboxy-terminal region of IRE1 showed close sequence similarity to the 
catalytic domains of protein kinases. Disruption of the IRE1 locus caused 
myo-inositol auxotrophy. The IRE1 product is very likely a protein kinase 
required for myo-inositol synthesis.
