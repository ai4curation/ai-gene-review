The activation of the tumor suppressor p53 facilitates the cellular response to 
genotoxic stress; however, the p53 response can only be executed if its 
interaction with its inhibitor Mdm2 is abolished. There have been conflicting 
reports on the question of whether p53 posttranslational modifications, such as 
phosphorylation or acetylation, are essential or only play a subtle, fine-tuning 
role in the p53 response. Thus, it remains unclear whether p53 modification is 
absolutely required for its activation. We have now identified all major 
acetylation sites of p53. Although unacetylated p53 retains its ability to 
induce the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop, loss of acetylation completely abolishes 
p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis. Notably, acetylation of p53 abrogates 
Mdm2-mediated repression by blocking the recruitment of Mdm2 to p53-responsive 
promoters, which leads to p53 activation independent of its phosphorylation 
status. Our study identifies p53 acetylation as an indispensable event that 
destabilizes the p53-Mdm2 interaction and enables the p53-mediated stress 
response.

INTRODUCTION

The p53 tumor suppressor is a key component of a regulatory circuit that monitors signaling pathways from diverse sources, including DNA damage responses, abnormal oncogenic events, and everyday normal cellular processes ( Vogelstein et al., 2000 ; Prives and Hall, 1999 ). p53 is tightly regulated, such that its protein product usually exists in a latent form, and at low levels, in unstressed cells. However, the steady-state levels and transcriptional activity of p53 increase dramatically in cells that sustain various types of stress. While the precise mechanisms of p53 activation are not fully understood, they are generally thought to entail posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation, of the p53 polypeptide ( Brooks and Gu, 2003 ; Vousden and Lane, 2007 ).

The functions of p53 are downregulated by the Mdm2 onco-protein and a related protein Mdmx (also called Mdm4), at least in part by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis ( Brooks and Gu, 2006 ; Michael and Oren, 2003 ; Marine and Jochemsen, 2005 ). The central role of Mdm2 in this process is best illustrated by studies carried out in mice where inactivation of p53 was shown to completely rescue the embryonic lethality caused by loss of Mdm2 function ( Jones et al., 1995 ; Montes de Oca Luna et al., 1995 ). Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms by which p53 activity is controlled are complex. Although Mdm2, a really interesting new gene (RING) oncoprotein, was once thought to be the sole E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53, recent studies have shown that p53 is degraded in the tissues of Mdm2 null mice ( Ringshausen et al., 2006 ) and that other E3 ligases can also induce p53 ubiq-uitination, such as ARF-BP1, COP1, and Pirh2 ( Leng et al., 2003 ; Dornan et al., 2004 ; Chen et al., 2005 ). In contrast, Mdmx does not have intrinsic E3 ligase activity but Mdmx knockout mice die despite having functional Mdm2, and this lethality is also rescued by inactivation of p53 ( Marine and Jochemsen, 2005 ). Thus, the role of Mdmx in repressing p53 function is as critical as that of Mdm2. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that degradation-independent mechanisms are crucial for both Mdm2 and Mdmx in controlling p53 activities. Recent studies suggest that Mdm2 mediates transcriptional repression by forming a protein complex with p53 on the promoters of specific p53-responsive genes ( Minsky and Oren, 2004 ; Arva et al., 2005 ; Ohkubo et al., 2006 ). Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether similar mechanisms are also used for Mdmx-mediated transcription repression.

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) represent an important layer of p53 regulation, particularly in transcription ( Brooks and Gu, 2003 ). The covalent linkage of an acetyl group to lysine, the enzymatic process of acetylation, was first discovered on histones, and the significance of histone acetylation in transcriptional regulation is well accepted ( Jenuwein and Allis, 2001 ; Berger, 2007 ). However, histones are not the only proteins that can be acetylated. p53 was the first nonhistone protein known to be regulated by acetylation and deacetylation ( Gu and Roeder, 1997 ; Luo et al., 2000 ). The acetylation levels of p53 are significantly enhanced in response to stress and correlate well with p53 activation and stabilization ( Luo et al., 2000 , 2001 ; Vaziri et al., 2001 ; Ito et al., 2001 ; Barlev et al., 2001 ; Knights et al., 2006 ; Li et al., 2007 ; Zhao et al., 2008 ; Kim et al., 2008 ). Recently, an acetylation-deficient missense mutant (p53-6KR) was successfully introduced into the endogenous p53 gene by a knockin approach. Although p53-mediated transcriptional activation upon DNA damage is partially impaired in the ESCs and thymocytes of these mice, loss of p53 acetylation at its C terminus by CBP/p300 is apparently not as essential as originally anticipated ( Feng et al., 2005 ; Krummel et al., 2005 ). Thus, it is possible that other coactivators or additional acetylation sites of p53 may compensate for the loss of p53 acetylation at its C terminus. Indeed, we and others have shown that the Tip60/hMOF protein induces p53 acetylation at lysine 120 (K120) within the DNA-binding domain, and that Tip60/hMOF, which shares no homology with the CBP/p300 or PCAF acetyltransferases, is required for p53-mediated transcriptional activation ( Tang et al., 2006 ; Sykes et al., 2006 ; Berns et al., 2004 ). Interestingly, K120 is a recurrent site for p53 mutation in human cancer and Tip60/MOF-dependent acetylation at K120 is important for p53-mediated apoptosis. Nevertheless, loss of K120 acetylation has no effect on p53-mediated activation of p21, and the tumor-derived mutant p53-K120R retains its ability to induce cell growth arrest ( Tang et al., 2006 ; Sykes et al., 2006 ).

Although numerous studies validate the crucial role of p21 in p53-mediated tumor suppression ( el-Deiry et al., 1993 ; Vogel-stein et al., 2000 ), the molecular mechanism by which p53 induces p21 expression is not well understood. Here we have identified K164 as a new site for in vivo acetylation of p53 by CBP/p300 and evaluated its function in these processes. Although acetylation defects at each individual site (K164, K120, and C terminus) can be compensated by the modification of other sites, loss of acetylation at all these major sites completely abolishes its ability to activate p21 and suppress cell growth. Moreover, acetylation blocks the interaction of p53 with its cognate repressors (Mdm2 and Mdmx) on DNA, and this event directly results in p53 activation regardless of its phosphorylation status. Notably, the transcriptional functions of unacetylated p53 can be restored by inactivation of Mdm2 and Mdmx. These data have significant implications regarding an essential role of acetylation in p53 regulation.

DISCUSSION

p53 is regulated by a variety of posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation , and neddylation ( Vousden and Lane, 2007 ; Brooks and Gu, 2006 ; Berger, 2007 ). While ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation is well accepted as a key mechanism for controlling p53 levels, it remains controversial how p53 is activated. Indeed, numerous studies indicate potential roles for phosphorylation and acetylation in p53 regulation; nevertheless, it was under debate whether protein modification is absolutely required for p53 activation. Following our early findings of C terminus p53 acetylation, we and others recently showed that p53 is also acetylated by Tip60/hMOF at residue K120 within the DNA-binding domain ( Tang et al., 2006 ; Sykes et al., 2006 ). K120 acetylation is crucial for p53-mediated apoptosis but has no obvious effect on p21 expression, an essential target of p53-mediated growth arrest ( el-Deiry et al., 1993 ). Although the molecular mechanism of p21 transactivation is not well understood, the p21 gene is induced by p53 in almost all cell types by a variety of stresses, suggesting that multiple pathways can promote its activation. Consistent with this notion, while loss of acetylation at each individual site can be compensated by the modification of other sites, loss of acetylation at all sites completely abolishes p53-mediated transactivation of p21. Thus, although expression of p21 likely is redundantly regulated by p53 through modifications of multiple modification sites, our data demonstrate that acetylation is an indispensable event for p53-mediated activation of p21 and subsequent growth arrest.

Earlier studies from us and others showed that acetylation modulates p53 function through multiple mechanisms, including DNA binding, stability control, and coactivator recruitment ( Brooks and Gu, 2003 ). Although we indeed observed these acetylation-mediated effects contribute, in part, to overall p53 activation ( Figures 4A, 4B , and 5C ), the dramatic loss of p53 functions in both growth arrest and apoptosis (but not in Mdm2 induction) with acetylation-defective p53 suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms. Recent studies have established crucial roles for both Mdm2 and Mdmx in controlling p53 activity in vivo ( Michael and Oren, 2003 ; Marine and Jochemsen, 2005 ). Since Mdm2 can induce p53 degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and downregulate p53 function by repressing p53-mediated transactivation, both ubiquiti-nation-dependent and ubiquitination-independent mechanisms have been proposed for Mdm2-mediated regulation of p53. In contrast, the molecular mechanism by which Mdmx, which is enzymatically inactive as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, downregulates p53 is unclear. Here we show that Mdmx, in a manner similar to Mdm2, can be recruited to p53 target promoters to serve as a transcriptional repressor. Importantly, acetylation prevents downregulation of p53 function by blocking the recruitment of both Mdm2 and Mdmx to p53 responsive promoters.

Inhibition of the p53-Mdm2 interaction is well accepted as a central event for p53 activation during the stress response. Several earlier reports indicated that phosphorylation of the N terminus is essential for p53 activation as the phosphorylation sites lie in or close to the MDM2 binding site on p53; however, a number of other studies have recently shown that p53 can be activated regardless of its phosphorylation status ( Ashcroft et al., 1999 , 2000 ; Dumaz and Meek, 1999 ; Blattner et al., 1999 ; Wu et al., 2002 ; Thompson et al., 2004 ; Prives and Hall., 1999 ). Thus, it remains a major issue regarding how p53 is activated without inducing its phosphorylation. Our study demonstrates that acetylation of p53 is sufficient for abrogating Mdm2-mediated repression during the stress response in the absence of phosphorylation. The antirepression mechanism described here explains why the function of unacetylated p53 can be restored in human cells by the loss of the p53 repressors (Mdm2 and Mdmx). Other lines of evidence also support this mechanism. For example, the unexpected activity of unacety-lated p53 in reconstituted in vitro transcription reactions with purified components can now be explained by the absence of Mdm2 and Mdmx in this system ( An et al., 2004 ; Espinosa and Emerson, 2001 ). Moreover, the mechanism presented here is also consistent with recent studies showing that p53 is spontaneously activated in Mdm2 null mice ( Ringshausen et al., 2006 ).

Notably, in addition to the N-terminal domain, the DNA-binding domain of p53 was recently identified as a second binding site for Mdm2 interaction ( Yu et al., 2006 ; Kulikov et al., 2006 ). Surprisingly, we found that all three major domains of p53 (N terminus, core region, and C terminus) show similar binding affini-ties for Mdm2, which raised the possibility that multiple contacting sites are involved in the stable interaction between p53 and Mdm2. The relationship among phosphorylation, acetylation, and other modifications in p53 regulation warrants further investigations. It is very likely that phosphorylation (e.g., the N terminus) and acetylation of p53 have synergistic effects on inhibiting the p53-Mdm2 interaction, the most crucial step for p53 activation. Indeed, agents that block this interaction, including Nutlin-3, a small molecule antagonist of Mdm2, attract huge interests for their potentials in cancer therapy ( Vassilev, 2007 ). However, blocking the p53-Mdm2 interaction is apparently not sufficient to turn on all p53-responsive promoters. Recent studies showed that the treatment of Nutlin-3 strongly induces p53-dependent growth arrest in cancer cells but has a much-reduced ability to activate proapoptotic targets of p53 ( Tovar et al., 2006 ).

Thus, p53 acetylation may have additional functions besides destabilizing the p53-Mdm2 interaction. Since two key acetylation sites (K120 and K164), in addition to a cluster of acetylation sites at the C terminus reside in the DNA-binding core domain of p53, it will be interesting to know whether acetylation of these sites changes the conformation of p53 in a manner that attracts other promoter-specific regulators. For example, there is accumulating evidence showing that the core domain and the C terminus may be the docking sites for several important p53 coactivators such as ASPPs, 53BP1, Tip60/hMOF, hCAS/CSE1L, and HZF, which are all critically involved in the induction of different targets by p53 ( Sullivan and Lu, 2007 ; Das et al., 2007 ; Tanaka et al., 2007 ; Li et al., 2007 ; Tang et al., 2006 ; Sykes et al., 2006 ; Joo et al., 2002 ). The interactions between p53 and these factors may be modulated by acetylation. Moreover, the differential effect of p53 acetylation on Mdm2/Mdmx recruitment to p53 target promoters needs further elucidation. We failed to detect a significant effect on the Mdm2 promoter by p53 acetylation, which is consistent with normal Mdm2 induction by the acetylation-defective p53 mutant. Thus, the consequences of p53 acetylation are promoter specific and different architectures of the p53-DNA complexes at various p53 target sequences may also contribute to such specificities.
