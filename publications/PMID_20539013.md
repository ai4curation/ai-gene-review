The overproduction of mucus is a key pathology associated with respiratory 
diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These 
conditions are characterized by an increase in the number of mucus-producing 
goblet cells in the airways. We have studied the cellular origins of goblet 
cells using primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), which can be 
differentiated to form a stratified epithelium containing ciliated, basal and 
goblet cells. Treatment of differentiated HBEC cultures with the cytokine IL-13, 
an important mediator in asthma, increased the numbers of goblet cells and 
decreased the numbers of ciliated cells. To determine whether ciliated cells act 
as goblet cell progenitors, ciliated cells in HBEC cultures were hereditably 
labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) using two lentiviral 
vectors, one which contained Cre recombinase under the control of a FOXJ1 
promoter and a second Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-floxed-EGFP construct. The fate of 
the EGFP-labeled ciliated cells was tracked in HBEC cultures. Treatment with 
IL-13 reduced the numbers of EGFP-labeled ciliated cells compared with untreated 
cultures. In contrast, IL-13 treatment significantly increased the numbers of 
EGFP-labeled goblet cells. This study demonstrates that goblet cells formed in 
response to IL-13 treatment are in part or wholly derived from progenitors that 
express the ciliated cell marker, FOXJ1.
