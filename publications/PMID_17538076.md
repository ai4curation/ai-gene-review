17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD17B2) oxidizes estradiol to 
estrone, testosterone to androstenedione, and 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone to 
progesterone. HSD17B2 is highly expressed in human placental tissue where it is 
localized to placental endothelial cells lining the fetal compartment. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the effects of potential regulatory factors 
including progesterone, estradiol, and retinoic acid (RA) onHSD17B2 expression 
in primary human placental endothelial cells in culture.HSD17B2 mRNA expression 
was not regulated by progesterone, the progesterone agonist R5020, or estradiol 
treatment. RA significantly induced HSD17B2 mRNA levels and enzyme activity in a 
dose- and time-dependent manner. Maximal stimulation occurred at Hour 48 at an 
RA concentration of 10(-6) M. Both retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) and 
retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA) were readily detected by immunoblotting in 
isolated placental endothelial cells. RNA interference directed against RARA or 
RXRA led to reduced basal levels of HSD17B2 mRNA levels and significantly 
abolished RA-stimulated HSD17B2 expression. Together, these data indicate that 
regulation of HSD17B2 mRNA levels and enzymatic activity by RA in the placenta 
is mediated by RARA and RXRA.
