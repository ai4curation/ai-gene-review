Protein B23 is an abundant, multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein whose 
activities are proposed to play a role in ribosome assembly. Szebeni et al. 
(1997) showed stimulation of nuclear import in vitro by protein B23 and 
suggested that this effect was due to a molecular chaperone-like activity. 
Protein B23 was tested for chaperone activities using several protein 
substrates. The temperature-dependent and -independent aggregation of the HIV-1 
Rev protein was measured using a zero angle light scattering (turbidity) assay. 
Protein B23 inhibited the aggregation of the Rev protein, with the amount of 
inhibition proportional to the concentration of B23 added. This activity was 
saturable with nearly complete inhibition when the molar ratio of B23:Rev was 
slightly above one. Protein B23 also protected liver alcohol dehydrogenase 
(LADH), carboxypeptidase A, citrate synthase, and rhodanese from aggregation 
during thermal denaturation and preserved the enzyme activity of LADH under 
these conditions. In addition, protein B23 was able to promote the restoration 
of activity of LADH previously denatured with guanidine-HCl. Protein B23 
preferentially bound denatured substrates and exposed hydrophobic regions when 
complexed with denatured proteins. Thus, by several criteria, protein B23 
behaves like a molecular chaperone; these activities may be related to its role 
in ribosome biogenesis.
