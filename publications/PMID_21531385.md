BACKGROUND: A genome scan of Taiwanese schizophrenia families suggested linkage 
to chromosome 10q22.3. We aimed to find the candidate genes in this region.
METHODS: A total of 476 schizophrenia families were included. Hierarchical 
clustering method was used for clustering families to homogeneous subgroups 
according to their performances of sustained attention and executive function. 
Association analysis was performed using family-based association testing and 
TRANSMIT. Candidate associated regions were identified using the longest 
significance run method. The relative messenger RNA expression level was 
determined using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: First, we genotyped 18 microsatellite markers between D10S1432 and 
D10S1239. The maximum nonparametric linkage score was 2.79 on D10S195. Through 
family clustering, we found the maximum nonparametric linkage score was 3.70 on 
D10S195 in the family cluster with deficits in attention and executive function. 
Second, we genotyped 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms between D10S1432 and 
D10S580 in 90 attention deficit and execution deficit families. Association 
analysis indicated significant transmission distortion for nine single 
nucleotide polymorphisms. Using the longest significance run method, we 
identified a 427-kilobase region as a significant candidate region, which 
encompasses nine genes. Third, we studied messenger RNA expression of these nine 
genes in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastic cells. In schizophrenic 
patients, there was significantly lower expression of ANXA7, PPP3CB, and DNAJC9 
and significantly higher expression of ZMYND17.
CONCLUSIONS: ANXA7, PPP3CB, DNAJC9, and ZMYND17 genes are potential candidate 
genes for schizophrenia, especially in patients with deficits in sustained 
attention and executive function. The responsible functional variants remained 
to be clarified.
