The leukocyte response to chemoattractants is transduced by the interaction of 
transmembrane receptors with GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins). RGS1 
is a member of a protein family constituting a newly appreciated and large group 
of proteins that act as deactivators of G-protein signaling pathways by 
accelerating the GTPase activity of G-protein alpha subunits. We demonstrate 
here that RGS1 is expressed in human monocytes; by immunofluorescence and 
subcellular fractionation RGS1 was localized to the plasma membrane. By using a 
mixture of RGS1 and plasma membranes, we were able to demonstrate GAP activity 
of RGS1 on receptor-activated G-proteins; RGS1 did not affect ligand-stimulated 
GDP-GTP exchange. We found that RGS1 desensitizes a variety of chemotactic 
receptors including receptors for N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, 
leukotriene B4, and C5a. Interaction of RGS proteins and ligand-induced 
G-protein signaling can be demonstrated by determining GTPase activity using 
purified RGS proteins and plasma membranes.
