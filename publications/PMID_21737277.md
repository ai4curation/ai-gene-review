Stomatal pores surrounded by a pair of guard cells in the plant epidermis 
control gas exchange for photosynthesis in response to light, CO(2), and 
phytohormone abscisic acid. Phototropins (phot1 and phot2) are plant blue-light 
receptor kinases and mediate stomatal opening via activation of the plasma 
membrane H(+)-ATPase. However, the signaling mechanism from phototropins to the 
H(+)-ATPase has yet to be determined. Here, we show that FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) 
is expressed in guard cells and regulates stomatal opening. We isolated an scs 
(suppressor of closed-stomata phenotype in phot1 phot2) 1-1 mutant of 
Arabidopsis thaliana and showed that scs1-1 carries a novel null early flowering 
3 (elf3) allele in a phot1 phot2 background. scs1-1 (elf3 phot1 phot2 triple 
mutant) had an open-stomata phenotype with high H(+)-ATPase activity and showed 
increased levels of FT mRNA in guard cells. Transgenic plants overexpressing FT 
in guard cells showed open stomata, whereas a loss-of-function FT allele, ft-1, 
exhibited closed stomata and failed to activate the H(+)-ATPase in response to 
blue light. Our results define a new cell-autonomous role for FT and demonstrate 
that the flowering time genes ELF3 and FT are involved in the regulation of 
H(+)-ATPase by blue light in guard cells.
