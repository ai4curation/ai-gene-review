In hormone perception, varying the concentrations of hormone, receptor, or 
downstream signaling elements can modulate signal transduction. Previous 
research has demonstrated that ethylene biosynthesis in plants is regulated by 
abiotic factors. Here we report that exposure of Arabidopsis plants to NaCl 
reduced expression of the ethylene receptor ETR1. The change in gene expression 
was reflected at the protein level based on immunoblot analysis. Further 
analysis supports a general effect of osmotic stress upon the expression level 
of ETR1. The reduction in ETR1 levels should cause increased sensitivity of the 
plant to ethylene. These results suggest that plant responses to abiotic stress 
are modulated by changes in the expression level of ethylene receptors.
