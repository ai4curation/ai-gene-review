The chaperonin GroEL is a double-ring structure with a central cavity in each 
ring that provides an environment for the efficient folding of proteins when 
capped by the co-chaperone GroES in the presence of adenine nucleotides. 
Productive folding of the substrate rhodanese has been observed in cis ternary 
complexes, where GroES and polypeptide are bound to the same ring, formed with 
either ATP, ADP or non-hydrolysable ATP analogues, suggesting that the specific 
requirement for ATP is confined to an action in the trans ring that evicts GroES 
and polypeptide from the cis side. We show here, however, that for the folding 
of malate dehydrogenase and Rubisco there is also an absolute requirement for 
ATP in the cis ring, as ADP and AMP-PNP are unable to promote folding. We 
investigated the specific roles of binding and hydrolysis of ATP in the cis and 
trans rings using mutant forms of GroEL that bind ATP but are defective in its 
hydrolysis. Binding of ATP and GroES in cis initiated productive folding inside 
a highly stable GroEL-ATP-GroES complex. To discharge GroES and polypeptide, ATP 
hydrolysis in the cis ring was required to form a GroEL-ADP-GroES complex with 
decreased stability, priming the cis complex for release by ATP binding (without 
hydrolysis) in the trans ring. These observations offer an explanation of why 
GroEL functions as a double-ring complex.
