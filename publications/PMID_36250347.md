Neurite outgrowth is a fundamental process in neurons that produces extensions 
and, consequently, neural connectivity. Neurite damage and atrophy are observed 
in various brain injuries and disorders. Understanding the intrinsic pathways of 
neurite outgrowth is essential for developing strategies to stimulate neurite 
regeneration. Insulin is a pivotal hormone in the regulation of glucose 
homeostasis. There is increasing evidence for the neurotrophic functions of 
insulin, including the induction of neurite outgrowth. However, the associated 
mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that insulin potentiates neurite 
outgrowth mediated by the small GTPases ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and 
Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) through the neuronal adaptor 
FE65. Moreover, insulin enhances atypical protein kinase Cι/λ (PKCι/λ) 
activation and FE65 phosphorylation at serine 459 (S459) in neurons and mouse 
brains. In vitro and cellular assays show that PKCι/λ phosphorylated FE65 at 
S459. Consistently, insulin potentiates FE65 S459 phosphorylation only in the 
presence of PKCι/λ. Phosphomimetic studies show that an FE65 S459E mutant 
potently activates ARF6, Rac1, and neurite outgrowth. Notably, this 
phosphomimetic mutation enhances the FE65-ARF6 interaction, a process that 
promotes ARF6-Rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth. Likewise, insulin treatment and 
PKCι/λ overexpression potentiate the FE65-ARF6 interaction. Conversely, PKCι/λ 
knockdown suppresses the stimulatory effect of FE65 on ARF6-Rac1-mediated 
neurite outgrowth. The effect of insulin on neurite outgrowth is also markedly 
attenuated in PKCι/λ knockdown neurons, in the presence and absence of FE65. Our 
findings reveal a novel mechanism linking insulin with ARF6-Rac1-dependent 
neurite extension through the PKCι/λ-mediated phosphorylation of FE65.
