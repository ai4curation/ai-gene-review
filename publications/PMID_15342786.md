Aberrant secreted proteins can be destroyed by ER-associated protein degradation 
(ERAD), and a prominent, medically relevant ERAD substrate is the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). To better define the 
chaperone requirements during CFTR maturation, the protein was expressed in 
yeast. Because Hsp70 function impacts CFTR biogenesis in yeast and mammals, we 
first sought ER-associated Hsp40 cochaperones involved in CFTR maturation. Ydj1p 
and Hlj1p enhanced Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis but CFTR degradation was slowed only in 
yeast mutated for both YDJ1 and HLJ1, suggesting functional redundancy. In 
contrast, CFTR degradation was accelerated in an Hsp90 mutant strain, suggesting 
that Hsp90 preserves CFTR in a folded state, and consistent with this 
hypothesis, Hsp90 maintained the solubility of an aggregation-prone domain 
(NBD1) in CFTR. Soluble ERAD substrate degradation was unaffected in the Hsp90 
or the Ydj1p/Hlj1p mutants, and surprisingly CFTR degradation was unaffected in 
yeast mutated for Hsp90 cochaperones. These results indicate that Hsp90, but not 
the Hsp90 complex, maintains CFTR structural integrity, whereas Ydj1p/Hlj1p 
catalyze CFTR degradation.
