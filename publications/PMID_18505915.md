Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is thought to play a role in the 
pathobiological progression of ovarian cancer because this peptide hormone is 
overexpressed in cancer tissue, plasma, and peritoneal fluid. In the current 
study, we investigated the role of the TGF-beta/Smad3 pathway in ovarian cancer 
metastasis by regulation of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. When cancer 
cells were cultured on plastic, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGF-beta3 induced 
pro-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion, loss of cell-cell junctions, 
down-regulation of E-cadherin, up-regulation of N-cadherin, and acquisition of a 
fibroblastoid phenotype, consistent with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition. Furthermore, Smad3 small interfering RNA transfection inhibited 
TGF-beta-mediated changes to a fibroblastic morphology, but not MMP secretion. 
When cancer cells were cultured on a three-dimensional collagen matrix, 
TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGF-beta3 stimulated both pro-MMP and active MMP 
secretion and invasion. Smad3 small interfering RNA transfection of cells 
cultured on a collagen matrix abrogated TGF-beta-stimulated invasion and MMP 
secretion. Analysis of Smad3 nuclear expression in microarrays of serous benign 
tumors, borderline tumors, and cystadenocarcinoma revealed that Smad3 expression 
could be used to distinguish benign and borderline tumors from carcinoma (P = 
0.006). Higher Smad3 expression also correlated with poor survival (P = 0.031). 
Furthermore, a direct relationship exists between Smad3 nuclear expression and 
expression of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin in cancer patients (P = 0.0057). 
Collectively, these results implicate an important role for the TGF-beta/Smad3 
pathway in mediating ovarian oncogenesis by enhancing metastatic potential.
