The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a conserved protein complex known to be involved 
in developmental processes of eukaryotic organisms. Genetic disruption of a CSN 
gene causes arrest during early embryonic development in mice. The Csn8 subunit 
is the smallest and the least conserved subunit, being absent from the CSN 
complex of several fungal species. Nevertheless, Csn8 is an integral component 
of the CSN complex in higher eukaryotes, where it is essential for life. By 
characterizing the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that express Csn8 at a low 
level, we found that Csn8 plays an important role in maintaining the proper 
duration of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A decreased level of Csn8, either in 
Csn8 hypomorphic MEFs or following siRNA-mediated knockdown in HeLa cells, 
accelerated cell growth rate. Csn8 hypomorphic MEFs exhibited a shortened G1 
duration and affected expression of G1 regulators. In contrast to Csn8, 
down-regulation of Csn5 impaired cell proliferation. Csn5 proteins were found 
both as a component of the CSN complex and outside of CSN (Csn5-f), and the 
amount of Csn5-f relative to CSN was increased in the Csn8 hypomorphic cells. We 
conclude that CSN harbors both positive and negative regulators of the cell 
cycle and therefore is poised to influence the fate of a cell at the crossroad 
of cell division, differentiation, and senescence.
