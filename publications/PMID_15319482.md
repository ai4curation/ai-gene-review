BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) is a Leu-rich-repeat (LRR) receptor kinase 
that functions as a critical component of a transmembrane brassinosteroid (BR) 
receptor. It is believed that BRI1 becomes activated through heterodimerization 
with BAK1, a similar LRR receptor kinase, in response to BR signal. A yeast 
two-hybrid screen using the kinase domain of BRI1 identified an Arabidopsis 
thaliana Transthyretin-Like protein (TTL) as a potential BRI1 substrate. TTL 
interacts with BRI1 in a kinase-dependent manner in yeast and is phosphorylated 
by BRI1 in vitro. TTL displays a similar expression pattern with BRI1 and is 
associated with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of the TTL gene results in a 
phenotype that was observed in weak bri1 mutants and null bak1 mutants. By 
contrast, two T-DNA insertional mutations in the TTL gene promote plant growth 
and enhance BR sensitivity. We hypothesized that TTL might directly regulate 
certain biochemical activities near the plasma membrane to control plant growth.

It is believed that BRI1 becomes activated through heterodimerization with BAK1, a similar LRR receptor kinase, in response to BR signal. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the kinase domain of BRI1 identified an Arabidopsis thaliana Transthyretin-Like protein (TTL) as a potential BRI1 substrate. TTL interacts with BRI1 in a kinase-dependent manner in yeast and is phosphorylated by BRI1 in vitro. TTL displays a similar expression pattern with BRI1 and is associated with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of the TTL gene results in a phenotype that was observed in weak bri1 mutants and null bak1 mutants. By contrast, two T-DNA insertional mutations in the TTL gene promote plant growth and enhance BR sensitivity. We hypothesized that TTL might directly regulate certain biochemical activities near the plasma membrane to control plant growth.

INTRODUCTION

Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a special class of plant polyhydroxysteroids that are structurally similar to the well-studied animal steroid hormones and play important roles throughout the plant development. Like animal steroids, BR can elicit both genomic responses that depend on gene expression and nongenomic effects that are independent of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. In animals, steroids use intracellular steroid receptors that are ligand dependent transcriptional factors to control gene expression in the nucleus ( Aranda and Pascual, 2001 ) but rely on membrane steroid receptors to induce rapid nongenomic effects at the cell membrane or in the cytosol ( Cato et al., 2002 ). By contrast, the plant steroids are mainly, if not exclusively, perceived by transmembrane steroid receptors to initiate signaling pathways that could control both genomic and nongenomic processes ( Clouse 2002a , 2002b ; Thummel and Chory, 2002 ; Peng and Li, 2003 ).

For the past several years, three different approaches have been successfully used to identify potential BR signaling components that transduce the plant steroid signals from the cell surface into the nucleus. The first approach, direct screening for BR-insensitive mutants, led to the identification of two BR-insensitive genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 ( BRI1 ) encoding a Leu-rich-repeat (LRR) receptor-like kinase that functions as a key component of a membrane BR receptor ( Clouse et al., 1996 ; Kauschmann et al., 1996 ; Li and Chory, 1997 ; Noguchi et al., 1999 ; He et al., 2000 ; Wang et al., 2001 ), and BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2 ( BIN2 ), encoding a highly conserved GSK3 kinase that negatively regulates BR signaling ( Choe et al., 2002 ; Li and Nam, 2002 ; Perez-Perez et al., 2002 ). The second approach, screening for extragenic mutations that suppress weak bri1 phenotypes or are resistant to a specific BR-biosynthesis inhibitor, resulted in the identification of a putative Ser carboxypeptidase (BRS1) that was hypothesized to regulate an early BR signaling event upstream of BR perception ( Li et al., 2001a ), a BRI1-associated receptor kinase (BAK1) thought to heterodimerize with BRI1 in initiating BR signaling at the cell surface ( Li et al., 2002 ), two putative transcriptional factors (BES1 and BZR1) critical for regulating the expression of many BR-responsive genes ( Wang et al., 2002 ; Yin et al., 2002 ), and a nuclear phosphatase (BSU1) that counteracts the BIN2 action ( Mora-Garcia et al., 2004 ). The third approach, yeast two-hybrid screening, was successfully used in our laboratory to independently identify BAK1 as a potential coreceptor for BRI1 ( Nam and Li, 2002 ) and to discover BES1 and BZR1 as two potential substrates for the BIN2 GSK3 kinase ( Zhao et al., 2002 ).

A working model for BR signaling emerges from the biochemical and genetic studies of the discovered BR signaling proteins ( Peng and Li, 2003 ). In the absence of BR, both BRI1 and BAK1 are inactive, but BIN2 is a constitutively active kinase that phosphorylates BES1 and BZR1 to target them for a proteasome-mediated protein degradation process ( He et al., 2002 ), thus blocking the transduction of BR signals into the nucleus. In the presence of BR, BRI1 and BAK1 are activated, most likely through receptor heterodimerization and the resulting transphosphorylation, which can then inhibit BIN2 via a yet unknown mechanism, resulting in increased protein stability and subsequent accumulation of both BES1 and BZR1 in the nucleus where they regulate gene activities to influence many cellular processes.

In contrast with the rapid progress in understanding how the plant steroid signals reach the nucleus to regulate gene activities, little is known about how BRs induce nongenomic responses at the cell membrane or in the cytosol. Two competing models were proposed to explain how the plant steroid signaling is initiated at the cell surface and transmitted into the plant cell. Based on studies using the Escherichia coli â€“expressed recombinant proteins of the cytoplasmic domains of BRI1 and BAK1, Li et al. (2002) proposed a two-step activation model involving sequential phosphorylation of BRI1 and BAK1. BR binds and activates BRI1, which can then phosphorylate and activate BAK1, and the activated BAK1 is responsible for transmitting BR signal into the cytosol by phosphorylating cytoplasmic BR signaling components. We proposed a transphosphorylation model based on our biochemical studies of the two full-length receptor kinases expressed in yeast cells ( Nam and Li, 2002 ). BRI1 and BAK1, existing mainly as inactive monomers, are in equilibrium with a small pool of BRI1/BAK1 heterodimers. BR binding stabilizes the BRI1-BAK1 heterodimer, shifting the equilibrium toward the BRI1-BAK1 dimer formation. Such a BR-stimulated BRI1-BAK1 dimerization would activate both receptor kinases through transphosphorylation, which can then phosphorylate a multitude of cytoplasmic substrates to transduce the BR signal into the cytosol or directly regulate the membrane activities that are important for plant growth. In this article, we report the identification of a novel Arabidopsis protein, TTL (for Transthyretin-Like), by a yeast two-hybrid library screening as a potential substrate of BRI1. Our genetic studies suggest that TTL is a negative regulator in BR-mediated plant growth.

DISCUSSION

Despite the rapid progress in recent years in identifying several BR signaling components and BR-regulated genes, no substrate has been identified for BRI1, a key component of a membrane BR receptor. In this report, we describe the identification of an Arabidopsis TTL protein as a potential BRI1 substrate and provide both genetic and transgenic results to implicate a negative role of TTL in BR-mediated plant growth.

In yeast, TTL interacts specifically with BRI1 but lacks interaction with three nonrelevant proteins, including CLV1, a similar LRR receptor-like kinase involved in meristem development, indicating a specific interaction between TTL and BRI1. The dependence of the BRI1-TTL interaction on the BRI1 kinase activity in yeast and the demonstration of TTL phosphorylation by BRI1 in vitro strongly suggest that TTL is a potential substrate for BRI1. BRI1 and TTL share similar gene expression patterns as revealed by both RNA gel blot and histochemical analyses of a GUS reporter gene. Confocal microscopic examination and cellular fractionation analysis of TTL:GFP transgenic plants suggested that TTL is loosely associated with membrane where BRI1 is localized, suggesting that TTL can potentially interact with BRI1. However, repeated coimmunoprecipitation experiments failed to show a direct physical interaction between the two proteins, most likely because of the transient nature of the kinase/substrate interaction. The biological function of TTL in modulating plant growth was revealed by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. Overexpression of the TTL gene inhibited plant growth and resulted in a reduced BR sensitivity as revealed by the root growth inhibition assay. By contrast, the T-DNA insertional mutations of the TTL gene promoted plant growth, enhanced BR sensitivity, and increased brassinazole resistance, suggesting that TTL functions as a negative regulator in BR-mediated plant growth.

A database search indicated that TTL is a member of a growing family of TRPs, which share significant sequence identity with the vertebrate transthyretin, an extracellular thyroid hormone carrier protein, whose mutations in human are often associated with two clinical forms of amyloidosis ( Benson and Uemichi, 1996 ). So far, at least 49 TRP sequences have been identified from 47 species, including E. coli , yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans , human, and many plant species ( Eneqvist et al., 2003 ). Almost all of them contain a characteristic four amino acid motif Tyr-Arg-Gly-Ser at their C-terminal ends, which distinguishes the TRPs from vertebrate transthyretins and other transthyretin-like sequences in databases. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of all 49 TRP sequences and the known vertebrate transthyretins indicated that TRPs might represent the ancestor of the vertebrate thyroid hormone carriers and have evolved independently to perform one or more different biochemical functions ( Eneqvist et al., 2003 ). A recent study has shown that the E. coli TRP, which exhibits 35% sequence identity and displays a similar three-dimensional structure to the human transthyretin, does not bind thyroid hormones but contains a distinct binding motif shared by all known TRPs for unknown ligands ( Eneqvist et al., 2003 ).

Sequence comparison among the known TRP sequences also reveals a unique feature for the plant TTLs. Whereas most TRPs of bacteria and animals are 120 to 130 amino acids long, the plant TTLs contain 320 to 340 amino acids with a long N-terminal extension of 200 to 210 amino acids, which is found in a variety of hypothetical bacterial proteins ( Eneqvist et al., 2003 ) and a hypothetic mouse protein (encoded by a mouse EST sequence BI328404 ). Interestingly, in some bacteria genomes, the ORF encoding an âˆ¼200â€“amino acid polypeptide similar to the TTL N-terminal domain overlaps with the TRP ORF, suggesting that plant TTLs are created by an ancient gene fusion event. For example, in the Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) genome ( NC_003888 ), the TG A stop codon of the SC2G5.30 ORF encoding a hypothetic protein similar to the N-terminal domain of TTL overlaps with the A TG start codon of the downstream TRP ORF. The occurrence of this domain in many unrelated proteins and the fact that this domain seems to be critical for interacting with BRI1 suggest that it might have a regulatory function to control the activity of TTLs in the plants.

A potential role for TRPs in purine catabolism was suggested by the demonstration that the Bacillus subtilis TRP is essential for a uricase activity ( Ashultz et al., 2001 ), which catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin by reduction of O 2 to H 2 O 2 . However, TTL seems unlikely to participate in this process for the following two reasons. First, uricases were identified in many different plant species, including Arabidopsis, and many were known to be involved in purine catabolism; however, none of them show any detectable sequence similarity to TTL, although weak homology was detected between the N-terminal half of TTL and the N-terminal 170 amino acids of a uricase precursor from Bacillus sp TB-90 ( Yamamoto et al., 1996 ). Second, it is well known that purine catabolism takes place inside peroxisomes that contain high uricase activity, and the only alleged uricase of Arabidopsis (At2g26230) does have a conserved Ser-Lys-Leu peroxisomal targeting signal at its C-terminal end. By contrast, TTL lacks such a peroxisomal targeting signal and is associated instead with the plasma membrane, as revealed by our confocal microscopic analysis of TTL:GFP transgenic plants. Our conclusion that TTL is not involved in purine catabolism is consistent with the existence of an expressed TRP gene ( BC044232 ) in human known to lack uricase ( Wu et al., 1992 ). Despite the facts that TRPs are evolutionarily conserved proteins and that TTL is a single copy gene in the Arabidopsis genome, the two T-DNA insertional ttl mutants exhibit a relatively weak morphological phenotype under normal growth conditions, suggesting that TRP is not an essential component of a fundamental biological process. However, the possibility that TTL might function redundantly with certain proteins of dissimilar sequences in a critical cellular process could not be ruled out.

Although the exact function of TTL awaits further investigation, its membrane association and its effects on BR-mediated growth responses suggest that this protein might interact with membrane proteins or activities previously implicated in BR-stimulated cell elongation, such as cell wall biosynthesis/reorganization of cortical microtubule ( Mayumi and Shibaoka, 1995 ; Yamamuro et al., 2000 ; Catterou et al., 2001 ), the plasma membrane ATPases ( Katsumi, 1991 ), and aquaporins ( Morillon et al., 2001 ). Plant growth and morphogenesis are largely contributed by cell elongation/expansion, which depends on the de novo biosynthesis and modification of cell wall (activated mainly by gene expression), the deposit orientation of nascent cellulose microfibrils (determined by cortical microtubules), and the internal turgor pressure (generated by water uptake). Both cellulose biosynthesis and reorganization of cortical microtubule were known to be important for BR-induced plant growth and it was thought that protein phosphorylation and microtubule-membrane interaction were involved in the process ( Mayumi and Shibaoka, 1995 ). Recent studies using BR-deficient ( Catterou et al., 2001 ) and BR-insensitive mutants ( Yamamuro et al., 2000 ) confirmed the effect of BR on cortical microtubule in cell elongation and suggested the existence of a BR-signaling pathway for regulating microtubule reorganization independently of tubulin gene expression. Both ATPases and aquaporins could regulate turgor pressure to generate the driving force for cell elongation. It was reported that plasma membrane ATPases were involved in BR-induced plant growth. BR-treatment resulted in increased proton extrusion in treated root tissues ( Mandava, 1988 ), and an inhibitor of the plasma membrane ATPase prevented BR-stimulated cell elongation ( Katsumi, 1991 ). A recent study also suggested that BR could control aquaporin activities. Correlations were observed between the hypocotyl length and water permeability of protoplasts isolated from both non-treated or BR-treated dwarf mutants deficient in BR biosynthesis ( Morillon et al., 2001 ).

We hypothesize that TTL might function as a negative regulator for one of the above-mentioned growth-promoting biochemical activities near the plasma membrane. In the absence of BR signaling, TTL is constitutively active in inhibiting such a growth-promoting activity by a yet unknown mechanism. In the presence of BR, BRI1 is activated, most likely through heterodimerization with BAK1 at the cell surface, which can then phosphorylate TTL and relieve its inhibitory effect on plant growth. It remains to be investigated whether the phosphorylation level of TTL is influenced by the plant steroid hormones and if the phosphorylation of TTL regulates its biological activity. More importantly, additional studies are needed to reveal its true biochemical function in modulating plant growth and provide useful information to study TRPs of other organisms.
