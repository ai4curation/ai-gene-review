The origin recognition complex (ORC) is essential for initiation of eukaryotic 
chromosome replication as it loads the replicative helicase-the minichromosome 
maintenance (MCM) complex-at replication origins1. Replication origins display a 
stereotypic nucleosome organization with nucleosome depletion at ORC-binding 
sites and flanking arrays of regularly spaced nucleosomes2-4. However, how this 
nucleosome organization is established and whether this organization is required 
for replication remain unknown. Here, using genome-scale biochemical 
reconstitution with approximately 300 replication origins, we screened 17 
purified chromatin factors from budding yeast and found that the ORC established 
nucleosome depletion over replication origins and flanking nucleosome arrays by 
orchestrating the chromatin remodellers INO80, ISW1a, ISW2 and Chd1. The 
functional importance of the nucleosome-organizing activity of the ORC was 
demonstrated by orc1 mutations that maintained classical MCM-loader activity but 
abrogated the array-generation activity of ORC. These mutations impaired 
replication through chromatin in vitro and were lethal in vivo. Our results 
establish that ORC, in addition to its canonical role as the MCM loader, has a 
second crucial function as a master regulator of nucleosome organization at the 
replication origin, a crucial prerequisite for efficient chromosome replication.
