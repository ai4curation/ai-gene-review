The collecting duct (CD) endothelin (ET) system regulates blood pressure (BP) 
and Na excretion. CD-specific knockout (KO) of ET-1 causes hypertension, 
CD-specific KO of the ETA receptor does not alter BP, while CD-specific KO of 
the ETB receptor increases BP to a lesser extent than CD ET-1 KO. These findings 
suggest a paracrine role for CD-derived ET-1; however, they do not exclude 
compensation for the loss of one ET receptor by the other. To examine this, mice 
with CD-specific KO of both ETA and ETB receptors were generated (CD ETA/B KO). 
CD ETA/B KO mice excreted less urinary Na than controls during acute or chronic 
Na loading. Urinary aldosterone excretion and plasma renin concentration were 
similar during Na intake and both fell comparably during Na loading. On a normal 
sodium diet, CD ETA/B KO mice had increased BP, which increased further with 
high salt intake. The degree of BP elevation during normal Na intake was similar 
to CD ET-1 KO mice and higher than CD ETB KO animals. During 1 wk of Na loading, 
CD ETA/B KO mice had higher BPs than CD ETB KO, while BP was less than CD ET-1 
KOs until the latter days of Na loading. These studies suggest that 1) CD ETA/B 
deficiency causes salt-sensitive hypertension, 2) CD ETA/B KO-associated Na 
retention is associated with failure to suppress the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and 3) CD ETA and ETB receptors exerts a 
combined hypotensive effect that exceeds that of either receptor alone.
