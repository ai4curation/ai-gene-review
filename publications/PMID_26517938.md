Brassinosteroid (BR) binding activates the receptor kinase BRI1 by inducing 
heterodimerization with its co-receptor kinase BAK1; however, the mechanisms 
that reversibly inactivate BRI1 remain unclear. Here we show that 
cytoplasm-localized protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) B' regulatory subunits 
interact with BRI1 to mediate its dephosphorylation and inactivation. 
Loss-of-function and overexpression experiments showed that a group of PP2A 
B' regulatory subunits, represented by B'η, negatively regulate BR signaling by 
decreasing BRI1 phosphorylation. BR increases the expression levels of these 
B' subunits, and B'η interacts preferentially with phosphorylated BRI1, 
suggesting that the dynamics of BR signaling are modulated by the PP2A-mediated 
feedback inactivation of BRI1. Compared with PP2A B'α and B'β, which promote BR 
responses by dephosphorylating the downstream transcription factor BZR1, the 
BRI1-inactivating B' subunits showed similar binding to BRI1 and BZR1 but 
distinct subcellular localization. Alteration of the nuclear/cytoplasmic 
localization of the B' subunits revealed that cytoplasmic PP2A dephosphorylates 
BRI1 and inhibits the BR response, whereas nuclear PP2A dephosphorylates BZR1 
and activates the BR response. Our findings not only identify the PP2A 
regulatory B subunits that mediate the binding and dephosphorylation of BRI1, 
but also demonstrate that the subcellular localization of PP2A specifies its 
substrate selection and distinct effects on BR signaling.
