Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a secondary complication of diabetes with an unclear 
etiology. Based on a functional genomic evaluation of obesity-associated cardiac 
gene expression, we previously identified and cloned the gene encoding 
apolipoprotein O (APOO), which is overexpressed in hearts from diabetic 
patients. Here, we generated APOO-Tg mice, transgenic mouse lines that expresses 
physiological levels of human APOO in heart tissue. APOO-Tg mice fed a high-fat 
diet exhibited depressed ventricular function with reduced fractional shortening 
and ejection fraction, and myocardial sections from APOO-Tg mice revealed 
mitochondrial degenerative changes. In vivo fluorescent labeling and subcellular 
fractionation revealed that APOO localizes with mitochondria. Furthermore, APOO 
enhanced mitochondrial uncoupling and respiration, both of which were reduced by 
deletion of the N-terminus and by targeted knockdown of APOO. Consequently, 
fatty acid metabolism and ROS production were enhanced, leading to increased 
AMPK phosphorylation and Ppara and Pgc1a expression. Finally, we demonstrated 
that the APOO-induced cascade of events generates a mitochondrial metabolic sink 
whereby accumulation of lipotoxic byproducts leads to lipoapoptosis, loss of 
cardiac cells, and cardiomyopathy, mimicking the diabetic heart-associated 
metabolic phenotypes. Our data suggest that APOO represents a link between 
impaired mitochondrial function and cardiomyopathy onset, and targeting 
APOO-dependent metabolic remodeling has potential as a strategy to adjust heart 
metabolism and protect the myocardium from impaired contractility.
