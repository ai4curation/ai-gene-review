Mutations in the X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 2 gene cause progressive 
degeneration of photoreceptor cells. The retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein (RP2) is 
similar in sequence to the tubulin-specific chaperone cofactor C. Together with 
cofactors D and E, cofactor C stimulates the GTPase activity of native tubulin, 
a reaction regulated by ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 protein. Here we show 
that in the presence of cofactor D, RP2 protein also stimulates the GTPase 
activity of tubulin. We find that this function is abolished by mutation in an 
arginine residue that is conserved in both cofactor C and RP2. Notably, 
mutations that alter this arginine codon cause familial retinitis pigmentosa. 
Our data imply that this residue acts as an "arginine finger" to trigger the 
tubulin GTPase activity and suggest that loss of this function in RP2 
contributes to retinal degeneration. We also show that in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, both cofactor C and RP2 partially complement the microtubule 
phenotype resulting from deletion of the cofactor C homolog, demonstrating their 
functional overlap in vivo. Finally, we find that RP2 interacts with GTP-bound 
ADP ribosylation factor-like 3 protein, providing a link between RP2 and several 
retinal-specific proteins, mutations in which also cause retinitis pigmentosa.
