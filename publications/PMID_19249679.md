Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease characterized by late diagnosis and 
resistance to therapy. Much progress has been made in defining gene defects in 
pancreatic cancer, but a full accounting of its molecular pathogenesis remains 
to be provided. Here, we show that expression of the ataxia-telangiectasia group 
D complementing gene (ATDC), also called TRIM29, is elevated in most invasive 
pancreatic cancers and pancreatic cancer precursor lesions. ATDC promoted cancer 
cell proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. 
ATDC expression correlated with elevated beta-catenin levels in pancreatic 
cancer, and beta-catenin function was required for ATDC's oncogenic effects. 
ATDC was found to stabilize beta-catenin via ATDC-induced effects on the 
Disheveled-2 protein, a negative regulator of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta in 
the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
