EVI1 (Ecotropic Viral Integration site I), which was originally identified as a 
site of viral integration in murine myeloid tumors, encodes a complex protein 
required for embryogenesis. The gene is known to express inappropriately in many 
types of human myeloid leukemias and solid tumors. Forced expression of EVI1 in 
murine hematopoietic precursor cells lead to abnormal differentiation and 
increased proliferation. EVI1 encodes two sets of zinc finger domains due to 
which it behaves as a transcriptional factor. However, except a few, the targets 
of EVI1 are not well understood and hence also the mechanism by which it 
initiates oncogenesis is not very clear. In this report, we show that SIRT1, a 
histone deacetylase is a direct target of EVI1. In vivo chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assay revealed that EVI1 binds to the promoter region of 
SIRT1 approximately 1kb upstream of the transcription start site. The 
functionality of the site was deduced by luciferase assay which showed that EVI1 
significantly increases the SIRT1 promoter activity. SIRT1 was also found to be 
up regulated in cell lines and in chronic myeloid leukemia patient samples where 
EVI1 was detected. Over expression of SIRT1 in cells shows that it interacts 
with EVI1 and this interaction lead to the deacetylation of the protein. Upon 
deacetylation the stability of EVI1 was found to be affected which was 
negatively regulated by nicotinamide (NAM). Our results thus identify an 
EVI1-SIRT1 axis in the regulation of EVI1 activity suggesting a possible role of 
SIRT1 in EVI1 positive neoplasms.
