Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated Cl(-) 
secretion across fluid-transporting epithelia is regulated, in part, by 
modulating the number of CFTR Cl(-) channels in the plasma membrane by adjusting 
CFTR endocytosis and recycling. However, the mechanisms that regulate CFTR 
recycling in airway epithelial cells remain unknown, at least in part, because 
the recycling itineraries of CFTR in these cells are incompletely understood. In 
a previous study, we demonstrated that CFTR undergoes trafficking in 
Rab11a-specific apical recycling endosomes in human airway epithelial cells. 
Myosin Vb is a plus-end-directed, actin-based mechanoenzyme that facilitates 
protein trafficking in Rab11a-specific recycling vesicles in several cell model 
systems. There are no published studies examining the role of myosin Vb in 
airway epithelial cells. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether 
myosin Vb facilitates CFTR recycling in polarized human airway epithelial cells. 
Endogenous CFTR formed a complex with endogenous myosin Vb and Rab11a. Silencing 
myosin Vb by RNA-mediated interference decreased the expression of wild-type 
CFTR and DeltaF508-CFTR in the apical membrane and decreased CFTR-mediated Cl(-) 
secretion across polarized human airway epithelial cells. A recombinant tail 
domain fragment of myosin Vb attenuated the plasma membrane expression of CFTR 
by arresting CFTR recycling. The dominant-negative effect was dependent on the 
ability of the myosin Vb tail fragment to interact with Rab11a. Taken together, 
these data indicate that myosin Vb is required for CFTR recycling in 
Rab11a-specific apical recycling endosomes in polarized human airway epithelial 
cells.
