The neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene shows significant homology to mammalian GAP and 
is an important regulator of the ras signal transduction pathway. To study the 
function of NF1 in normal development and to try and develop a mouse model of 
NF1 disease, we have used gene targeting in ES cells to generate mice carrying a 
null mutation at the mouse Nf1 locus. Although heterozygous mutant mice, aged up 
to 10 months, likely attributable to a severe malformation of the heart. 
Interestingly, mutant embryos also display hyperplasia of neural crest-derived 
sympathetic ganglia. These results identify new roles for NF1 in development and 
indicate that some of the abnormal growth phenomena observed in NF1 patients can 
be recapitulated in neurofibromin-deficient mice.
