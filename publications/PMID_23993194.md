Whole-exome sequencing and autozygosity mapping studies, independently performed 
in subjects with defective combined mitochondrial OXPHOS-enzyme deficiencies, 
identified a total of nine disease-segregating FBXL4 mutations in seven 
unrelated mitochondrial disease families, composed of six singletons and three 
siblings. All subjects manifested early-onset lactic acidemia, hypotonia, and 
developmental delay caused by severe encephalomyopathy consistently associated 
with progressive cerebral atrophy and variable involvement of the white matter, 
deep gray nuclei, and brainstem structures. A wide range of other multisystem 
features were variably seen, including dysmorphism, skeletal abnormalities, poor 
growth, gastrointestinal dysmotility, renal tubular acidosis, seizures, and 
episodic metabolic failure. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency was 
present in muscle or fibroblasts of all tested individuals, together with 
markedly reduced oxygen consumption rate and hyperfragmentation of the 
mitochondrial network in cultured cells. In muscle and fibroblasts from several 
subjects, substantially decreased mtDNA content was observed. FBXL4 is a member 
of the F-box family of proteins, some of which are involved in 
phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and/or G protein receptor coupling. We 
also demonstrate that FBXL4 is targeted to mitochondria and localizes in the 
intermembrane space, where it participates in an approximately 400 kDa protein 
complex. These data strongly support a role for FBXL4 in controlling 
bioenergetic homeostasis and mtDNA maintenance. FBXL4 mutations are a recurrent 
cause of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy onset in early infancy.
