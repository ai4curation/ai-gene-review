TRAF1 and TRAF2 form an oligomeric complex that associates with the cytoplasmic 
domains of various members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 
superfamily. TRAF2 action is required for activation of the transcription factor 
NF-kappaB triggered by TNF and the CD40 ligand. Here we show that TRAF1 and 
TRAF2 interact with A20, a zinc finger protein, whose expression is induced by 
agents that activate NF-kappaB. Mutational analysis revealed that the N-terminal 
half of A20 interacts with the conserved C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF1 and 
TRAF2. In cotransfection experiments, A20 blocked TRAF2-mediated NF-kappaB 
activation. A20 also inhibited TNF and IL-1-induced NF-kappaB activation, 
suggesting that it may inhibit NF-kappaB activation signaled by diverse stimuli. 
The ability of A20 to block NF-kappaB activation was mapped to its C-terminal 
zinc finger domain. Thus, A20 is composed of two functionally distinct domains, 
an N-terminal TRAF binding domain that recruits A20 to the TRAF2-TRAF1 complex 
and a C-terminal domain that mediates inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Our 
findings suggest a possible molecular mechanism that could explain A20's ability 
to negatively regulate its own TNF-inducible expression.
