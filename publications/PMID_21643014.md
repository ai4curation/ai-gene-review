Ovarian cancers migrate and metastasize over the surface of the peritoneal 
cavity. Consequently, dysregulation of mechanisms that limit cell migration may 
be particularly important in the pathogenesis of the disease. ARHI is an 
imprinted tumor-suppressor gene that is downregulated in >60% of ovarian 
cancers, and its loss is associated with decreased progression-free survival. 
ARHI encodes a 26-kDa GTPase with homology to Ras. In contrast to Ras, ARHI 
inhibits cell growth, but whether it also regulates cell motility has not been 
studied previously. Here we report that re-expression of ARHI decreases the 
motility of IL-6- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated SKOv3 and Hey 
ovarian cancer cells, inhibiting both chemotaxis and haptotaxis. ARHI binds to 
and sequesters Stat3 in the cytoplasm, preventing its translocation to the 
nucleus and localization in focal adhesion complexes. Stat3 siRNA or the JAK2 
inhibitor AG490 produced similar inhibition of motility. However, the 
combination of ARHI expression with Stat3 knockdown or inhibition produced 
greatest inhibition in ovarian cancer cell migration, consistent with 
Stat3-dependent and Stat3-independent mechanisms. Consistent with two distinct 
signaling pathways, knockdown of Stat3 selectively inhibited IL-6-stimulated 
migration, whereas knockdown of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) preferentially 
inhibited EGF-stimulated migration. In EGF-stimulated ovarian cancer cells, 
re-expression of ARHI inhibited FAK(Y397) and Src(Y416) phosphorylation, 
disrupted focal adhesions, and blocked FAK-mediated RhoA signaling, resulting in 
decreased levels of GTP-RhoA. Re-expression of ARHI also disrupted the formation 
of actin stress fibers in a FAK- and RhoA-dependent manner. Thus, ARHI has a 
critical and previously uncharacterized role in the regulation of ovarian cancer 
cell migration, exerting inhibitory effects on two distinct signaling pathways.
