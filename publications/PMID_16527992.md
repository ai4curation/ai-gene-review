Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis 
in part by promoting vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth. Previously we 
demonstrated that cyclophilin A (CyPA) is a secreted oxidative stress-induced 
factor (SOXF) that promotes inflammation, VSMC growth, and endothelial cell 
apoptosis. However, the mechanisms that regulate CyPA secretion are unknown. In 
this study, we hypothesized that ROS-induced CyPA secretion from VSMC requires a 
highly regulated process of vesicle transport, docking, and fusion at the plasma 
membrane. Conditioned medium and plasma membrane sheets were prepared by 
exposing VSMC to 1 micromol/L LY83583, which generates intracellular superoxide. 
A vesicular transport mechanism was confirmed by colocalization at the plasma 
membrane with vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP). CyPA transport to the 
plasma membrane and secretion were significantly increased by LY83583. Reduction 
of VAMP-2 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited LY83583-induced CyPA 
secretion. Pretreatment with 3 micromol/L cytochalasin D, an actin 
depolymerizing agent, abrogated CyPA secretion. Infection with dominant-negative 
RhoA and Cdc42 adenovirus inhibited CyPA secretion by 72% and 63%, respectively, 
whereas dominant-negative Rac1 had a small effect (11%). Pretreatment with the 
Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (3 to 30 micromol/L) and myosin II inhibitor 
blebbistatin (1 to 10 micromol/L) inhibited CyPA secretion in a dose-dependent 
manner. Simvastatin (3 to 30 micromol/L) also dose-dependently inhibited 
LY83583-induced CyPA secretion likely via decreased isoprenylation of small 
GTPases. Our findings define a novel VSMC vesicular secretory pathway for CyPA 
that involves actin remodeling and myosin II activation via RhoA-, Cdc42-, and 
Rho kinase-dependent signaling events.
