Caenorhabditis elegans daf-11 and daf-21 mutants share defects in specific 
chemosensory responses mediated by several classes of sensory neurons, 
indicating that these two genes have closely related functions in an assortment 
of chemosensory pathways. We report that daf-11 encodes one of a large family of 
C. elegans transmembrane guanylyl cyclases (TM-GCs). The cyclic GMP analogue 
8-bromo-cGMP rescues a sensory defect in both daf-11 and daf-21 mutants, 
supporting a role for DAF-11 guanylyl cyclase activity in this process and 
further suggesting that daf-21 acts at a similar step. daf-11::gfp fusions are 
expressed in five identified pairs of chemosensory neurons in a pattern 
consistent with most daf-11 mutant phenotypes. We also show that daf-21 encodes 
the heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a chaperone with numerous specific protein 
targets. We show that the viable chemosensory-deficient daf-21 mutation is an 
unusual allele resulting from a single amino acid substitution and that the 
daf-21 null phenotype is early larval lethality. These results demonstrate that 
cGMP is a prominent second messenger in C. elegans chemosensory transduction and 
suggest a previously unknown role for Hsp90 in regulating cGMP levels.
