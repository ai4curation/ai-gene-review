Following DNA damage, p53 translocates to the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where 
it triggers transcription-independent apoptosis by binding to Bcl-2 family 
proteins. However, little is known about how this exonuclear function of p53 is 
regulated. Here, we identify and characterize a p53-interacting protein called 
Hades, an E3 ligase that interacts with p53 in the mitochondria. Hades reduces 
p53 stability via a mechanism that requires its RING-finger domain with 
ubiquitin ligase activity. Hades polyubiquitinates p53 in vitro independent of 
Mdm2 and targets a critical lysine residue in p53 (lysine 24) distinct from 
those targeted by Mdm2. Hades inhibits a p53-dependent mitochondrial cell death 
pathway by inhibiting p53 and Bcl-2 interactions. These findings show that 
Hades-mediated p53 ubiquitination is a novel mechanism for negatively regulating 
the exonuclear function of p53.

Abstract

Following DNA damage, p53 translocates to the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it triggers transcription-independent apoptosis by binding to Bcl-2 family proteins. However, little is known about how this exonuclear function of p53 is regulated. Here, we identify and characterize a p53-interacting protein called Hades, an E3 ligase that interacts with p53 in the mitochondria. Hades reduces p53 stability via a mechanism that requires its RING-finger domain with ubiquitin ligase activity. Hades polyubiquitinates p53 in vitro independent of Mdm2 and targets a critical lysine residue in p53 (lysine 24) distinct from those targeted by Mdm2. Hades inhibits a p53-dependent mitochondrial cell death pathway by inhibiting p53 and Bcl-2 interactions. These findings show that Hades-mediated p53 ubiquitination is a novel mechanism for negatively regulating the exonuclear function of p53.

Discussion

Here, we have identified Hades (UniProtKB accession number Q969V5 ) as a p53-interacting protein that acts as an E3 ligase for exonuclear p53 and degrades it through the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Although our study has focused on the functional communications between Hades and p53, other groups have identified Hades as MULAN/MAPL, a mitochondrial protein with a RING-finger domain ( Figure 1c ) that SUMOylates dynamin-related protein 1 to regulate mitochondrial dynamics. 27 , 28 , 29 As the ubiquitin ligase activity of Hades is critical for its own stability, the ectopic expression of wild-type Hades was lower than that of Hades RING mutant ( Figure 2b ). The RING domain-deleted mutant form of MULAN was shown to have robust expression in mitochondria, also supporting our observations. 27

Our study demonstrates that Hades has a novel function in modulating p53. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Hades is colocalized with p53 outside of the nucleus ( Figure 1g ). Furthermore, we showed that ectopic expression of Hades causes degradation of cytoplasmic p53 ( Figure 5c , lower panel). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that ubiquitination of cytoplasmic p53 by Hades is responsible for reducing the p53 level in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments.

Interestingly, we observed that mutant Hades lacking the signal peptide and TM domain (GFP-ΔSP-TM Hades) still induces the p53 degradation in 293T cells ( Supplementary Figure 6a ). Also, we showed that the RING-finger domain (RP) of Hades can bind to wild-type p53 as well as ubiquitinate it in vitro ( Figures 3d and g , and Supplementary Figures 3b and c ). These observations suggest that the subcellular localization of Hades is not critical for the degradation of p53.

Although several E3 ligases, including Mdm2, have been reported to target p53, 22 , 23 , 30 we believe that Hades and Mdm2 use distinct mechanisms for the following reasons. First, Mdm2 reduces the nuclear p53 level, 31 whereas Hades reduces the cytoplasmic p53 level ( Figure 5c , lower panel) and ubiquitinates this tumor suppressor in an Mdm2-independent manner ( Figure 3e ). Also, Hades inhibits p53 function in Mdm2 null cells ( Supplementary Figures 4c and b ). Second, ubiquitination by Hades, but not Mdm2, is dependent on lysine 24 residue in p53 ( Figure 3g and Supplementary Figure 3e ). Third, Hades does not participate in a negative feedback loop. More specifically, neither H 2 O 2 treatment nor ectopic expression of p53 affected the transcriptional expression of Hades ( Supplementary Figures 6b and c ). It is important to mention that several candidate E3 ligases that target p53, including ARF-bp1 and p300, 32 , 33 have been reported to be E3 ligases under normal conditions. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the other E3 ligase pathways may also contribute to Hades-mediated p53 modulation.

Therefore, our data point to a role for Hades in regulating the exonuclear function of p53. Hades inhibited the tumour suppressor function of mitochondrial p53 and interfered with the interaction between p53 and Bcl-2 ( Figure 5b ). Our data indicate that Hades attenuates CPT-induced accumulation of p53 ( Figure 5c ) and the interaction between p53 and Bcl-2 ( Figure 5d ). A previous report has shown that the interaction of p53 with Bcl-2 protein and the subsequent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential are hallmarks of the transcription-independent cell death activated by p53. 14 We found that Hades knockdown resulted in mitochondrial cytochrome c release upon CPT exposure ( Figure 5e ) as well as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in HCT116 p53 +/+ cells, but not in HCT116 p53 −/− cells ( Figure 5g ). Consistent with these findings, CPT treatment led to a greater increase in apoptotic cells in stable Hades knockdown MCF7 cells than in control cells ( Figure 5f ). Although the defined biochemical pathway underlying p53-induced, transcription-independent cell death remains elusive, our data indicate that Hades can prevent CPT-induced cell death by inducing ubiquitin-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation of p53. This result supports the idea that Hades negatively regulates the exonuclear function of p53.

In conclusion, our study suggests that Hades is an E3 ligase that acts on the tumour suppressor p53. This is the first evidence of Hades-mediated regulation of cytoplasmic and exonuclear p53 function. Hades has a unique role in the exonuclear p53 pathway, acting as a novel regulator of p53-dependent mitochondrial cell death. Thus, the physiological significance of Hades warrants further investigation.
