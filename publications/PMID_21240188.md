Bloom's syndrome (BS) and Fanconi anemia (FA) are autosomal recessive disorders 
characterized by cancer and chromosomal instability. BS and FA group J arise 
from mutations in the BLM and FANCJ genes, respectively, which encode DNA 
helicases. In this work, FANCJ and BLM were found to interact physically and 
functionally in human cells and co-localize to nuclear foci in response to 
replication stress. The cellular level of BLM is strongly dependent upon FANCJ, 
and BLM is degraded by a proteasome-mediated pathway when FANCJ is depleted. 
FANCJ-deficient cells display increased sister chromatid exchange and 
sensitivity to replication stress. Expression of a FANCJ C-terminal fragment 
that interacts with BLM exerted a dominant negative effect on hydroxyurea 
resistance by interfering with the FANCJ-BLM interaction. FANCJ and BLM 
synergistically unwound a DNA duplex substrate with sugar phosphate backbone 
discontinuity, but not an 'undamaged' duplex. Collectively, the results suggest 
that FANCJ catalytic activity and its effect on BLM protein stability contribute 
to preservation of genomic stability and a normal response to replication 
stress.

DNA helicases are important players in ensuring genome integrity, with mutations in their genes underlying various chromosomal instability disorders. Direct cross-talk between human FANCJ and BLM helicases further interconnects the intricate network of genome maintenance pathways.

Bloom's syndrome (BS) and Fanconi anemia (FA) are autosomal recessive disorders characterized by cancer and chromosomal instability. BS and FA group J arise from mutations in the BLM and FANCJ genes, respectively, which encode DNA helicases. In this work, FANCJ and BLM were found to interact physically and functionally in human cells and co-localize to nuclear foci in response to replication stress. The cellular level of BLM is strongly dependent upon FANCJ, and BLM is degraded by a proteasome-mediated pathway when FANCJ is depleted. FANCJ-deficient cells display increased sister chromatid exchange and sensitivity to replication stress. Expression of a FANCJ C-terminal fragment that interacts with BLM exerted a dominant negative effect on hydroxyurea resistance by interfering with the FANCJ–BLM interaction. FANCJ and BLM synergistically unwound a DNA duplex substrate with sugar phosphate backbone discontinuity, but not an ‘undamaged' duplex. Collectively, the results suggest that FANCJ catalytic activity and its effect on BLM protein stability contribute to preservation of genomic stability and a normal response to replication stress.
