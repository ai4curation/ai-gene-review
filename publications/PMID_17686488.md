The neuronal protein FE65 functions in brain development and amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) signaling through its interaction with the mammalian enabled 
(Mena) protein and APP, respectively. The recognition of short polyproline 
sequences in Mena by the FE65 WW domain has a central role in axon guidance and 
neuronal positioning in the developing brain. We have determined the crystal 
structures of the human FE65 WW domain (residues 253-289) in the apo form and 
bound to the peptides PPPPPPLPP and PPPPPPPPPL, which correspond to human Mena 
residues 313-321 and 347-356, respectively. The FE65 WW domain contains two 
parallel ligand-binding grooves, XP (formed by residues Y269 and W280) and XP2 
(formed by Y269 and W271). Both Mena peptides adopt a polyproline helical II 
conformation and bind to the WW domain in a forward (N-C) orientation through 
selection of the PPPPP motif by the XP and XP2 grooves. This mode of ligand 
recognition is strikingly similar to polyproline interaction with SH3 domains. 
Importantly, comparison of the FE65 WW structures in the apo and liganded forms 
shows that the XP2 groove is formed by an induced-fit mechanism that involves 
movements of the W271 and Y269 side-chains upon ligand binding. These structures 
elucidate the molecular determinants underlying polyproline ligand selection by 
the FE65 WW domain and provide a framework for the design of small molecules 
that would interfere with FE65 WW-ligand interaction and modulate neuronal 
development and APP signaling.
