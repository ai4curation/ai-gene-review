The mitochondrial matrix ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities 
(m-AAA) protease spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7) has been recently implicated as 
either a negative or positive regulatory component of the mitochondrial 
permeability transition pore (mPTP) by two research groups. To address this

resistance to Ca2+-induced mPTP opening. However, this occurs independently of 
cyclophilin D (cyclosporine A insensitive) rather it is through decreased 
mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations and subsequent adaptations mediated by 
impaired formation of functional mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complexes. We 
found that SPG7 directs the m-AAA complex to favor association with the 
mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and MCU processing regulates higher order 
MCU-complex formation. The results suggest that SPG7 does not constitute a core 
component of the mPTP but can modulate mPTP through regulation of the basal 
mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration.

Abstract

The mitochondrial matrix ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities (m-AAA) protease spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7) has been recently implicated as either a negative or positive regulatory component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by two research groups. To address this controversy, we investigated possible mechanisms that explain the discrepancies between these two studies. We found that loss of the SPG7 gene increased resistance to Ca 2+ -induced mPTP opening. However, this occurs independently of cyclophilin D (cyclosporine A insensitive) rather it is through decreased mitochondrial Ca 2+ concentrations and subsequent adaptations mediated by impaired formation of functional mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter complexes. We found that SPG7 directs the m-AAA complex to favor association with the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (MCU) and MCU processing regulates higher order MCU-complex formation. The results suggest that SPG7 does not constitute a core component of the mPTP but can modulate mPTP through regulation of the basal mitochondrial Ca 2+ concentration.

Introduction

The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) 2 is a Ca 2+ - and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive nonselective channel of unknown identity that is involved in many pathologies including ischemia reperfusion injury, Alzheimer's disease, amyloid lateral sclerosis, and diabetes ( 1 – 5 ). Over the past 40 years many models of the mPTP have been hypothesized; often these models rely on the idea that the core pore forming proteins bind to cyclophilin D (CypD) in a cyclosporine A (CsA)-sensitive manner. This is from the discovery that the immunosuppressant CsA could dramatically increase the threshold to mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload-mediated pore opening ( 6 , 7 ). Currently, one of the strongest candidates for the pore forming unit is the F 0 F 1 -ATP synthase, either as dimers or a dissociation between the F 0 and F 1 subunits ( 8 , 9 ). The ATP synthase binds to CypD through the oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein in a CsA-sensitive manner; displaying conductance states similar to those observed in the mPTP, has a Mg 2+ competitive Ca 2+ -binding site, pH sensitivity, and displays sensitivity to other pharmacological regulators of the pore, most notably benzodiazepines ( 10 – 12 ).

In contrast to this model there has recently been a report suggesting that the m-AAA protease spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7) is an essential part of the mPTP ( 13 ). Shanmughapriya et al. ( 13 ) used an unbiased RNAi screen to identify candidates that when lost increase the calcium retention capacity (CRC) of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells independent of ROS. Additionally, using a yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation technique, Shanmughapriya et al. ( 13 ) demonstrated that the C-terminal portion of SPG7, amino acids 700–795, was required for binding to CypD. Concerns have already been brought forth regarding how loss of the mPTP could lead to the clinical presentation of spastic paraplegia, as well as some broader concerns related to interpretation of the data presented ( 14 ). Our main concern was a lack of direct evidence linking SPG7 as a regulator of the mPTP through CypD. Shanmughapriya et al. ( 13 ) using human cell lines, created a CypD mutant that was insensitive to CsA and unable to bind to SPG7. Expression of this mutant failed to restore the phenotype of the SPG7 knockdown cells. Unfortunately, one of the sites they changed, R97G, is the same mutation used to render CypD isomerase deficient and unable to have any effect on the mPTP regardless of its binding partner ( 15 ). Additionally, in contrast to the report by Shanmughapriya et al. ( 13 ), it was recently shown that m-AAA–deficient mitochondria exhibited significantly reduced CRC and facilitated mPTP opening ( 16 ). These authors also show, using a knockout mouse model, that the loss of the m-AAA protease AFG3L2, the obligate binding partner of SPG7, increases mitochondrial Ca 2+ through regulation of essential MCU regulator (EMRE) processing and formation of ungated mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (MCU) complexes (MCUc) ( 16 , 17 ). In light of these discrepancies, we tested the ability of SPG7 to regulate the mPTP in a CypD-dependent manner and found that SPG7 does not constitute a core component of the mPTP, but instead regulates mPTP activity by lowering the basal mitochondrial Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] mt ) levels via regulation of MCU regulator 1 (MCUR1) and MCUc assembly.

Discussion

The current discrepancy between reports of SPG7 acting as either a positive or negative regulator of the mPTP led us to investigate the mechanism of mPTP regulation by SPG7 in HEK 293T cell lines with a loss of and subsequent rescue of SPG7. Using this experimental model we found that the CRC in SPG7 KO cells was still significantly increased by CsA, which suggests that CypD is binding to another complex and not mediating its effects through SPG7. Moreover, rescue of the SPG7 KO with a mutant of SPG7 that is unable to bind to CypD, could reverse the increases of CRC by SPG7 KO as well as maintain the sensitivity to CsA, which further confirmed CypD is binding to a protein other than SPG7 to regulate the mPTP. Strikingly, rather than failing to rescue the KO, rescue with a DN SPG7 restored the cells mPTP sensitivity, and reduced the maximum capacity when treated with CsA; phenotypically identical to loss of AFG3L2. We then investigated the potential mechanisms of how physical loss of SPG7 (KO) can lead to an increase in CRC, whereas functional loss (DN) can restore CRC. Using both a direct [Ca 2+ ] mt release assay and the P-Ser 293 PDH/total PDH ratio as a “bio-sensor,” we found that the loss of SPG7 led to lower basal levels of [Ca 2+ ] mt , whereas expression of DN SPG7 increased the levels, which closely mirrors the trend of the CRC data. It is important to note there is a large discrepancy between the values in Ca 2+ taken up by the CRC assay and those determined by the Ca 2+ release assay. Although the SPG7 KO could take up 40 nmol of additional Ca 2+ /3.75 × 10 6 cells versus HEK 293T cells before mPTP opening, yet there was only a difference of 0.4412 nmol of Ca 2+ released between SPG7 KO and HEK 293T cells in the Ca 2+ -release assay. One possible mechanism could be how the cells adapt to loss of SPG7 and the resulting sustained lower [Ca 2+ ] mt . It was recently shown that mice lacking MCU from birth compensated to the lower basal [Ca 2+ ] mt by sensitizing the mPTP threshold via phosphorylation on CypD ( 24 ). The authors hypothesize that the reduced [Ca 2+ ] mt lowers the activity of the Ca 2+ -dependent phosphatases present, thus raising the basal level of phospho-CypD/total CypD, and thus its affinity to regulate the mPTP. It is possible a similar mechanism may be at play in the SPG7 KO cells; after ∼20 passages in culture the cells CRC began to normalize toward a similar capacity as WT cells. However, there was also a corresponding increase in AFG3L2 expression (data not shown).

Two recent reports suggested that the m-AAA proteases, of which SPG7 and AFG3L2 are members, can regulate [Ca 2+ ] mt through the processing of EMRE ( 16 , 17 ). However, both of these studies focused on the protein AFG3L2, which can form a homo-oligomer or hetero-oligomer with SPG7. Because SPG7 does not form functional homo-oligomers, we reasoned it may be responsible for targeting the m-AAA protease to a different substrate of the mitochondrial Ca 2+ import machinery than the AFG3L2 homo-oligomers. This role was previously reported for SPG7's ability to target the m-AAA complex to process complex 1 of the electron transport chain independent of SPG7 proteolytic activity ( 26 ). Therefore, we measured the relative protein expression for the MCU complex components for [Ca 2+ ] mt influx and NCLX to see if [Ca 2+ ] mt efflux was altered. The loss of SPG7 significantly affected MCU, EMRE, MICU1, and MCUR1 levels, suggesting there may be alterations in functional MCU complex assembly.

To explore this, we immunoprecipitated HA-tagged MCU and looked at higher order complex assembly. To our surprise, we saw a difference in the bands identified by the anti-HA and anti-MCU antibodies. The HA antibody does not recognize proteins lower than 34 kDa. 34 kDa is the predicted molecular mass for MCU after processing by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, which is largely responsible for removing positively charged N-terminal mitochondrial targeting pre-sequences ( 27 ). MCU is predicted to lose the first 50–55 amino acids reducing the total molecular mass from 40 to 34 kDa ( 28 , 29 ). Furthermore, the appearance of multiple bands between 34 and 30 kDa only recognized by the MCU antibody suggests MCU is being cleaved C terminally in a processive fashion, one of the key hallmarks of AAA-proteases, rather than a site-specific peptidase ( 30 ). Another striking difference between the DN and SPG7 KO was the presence of a 45-kDa band greatly increased in the DN SPG7 KO. We hypothesize that this is the ungated MCU:EMRE complex described in previous studies on AFG3L2-mediated regulation of MCU ( 16 , 17 ). 45-kDa is the size one would expect of unprocessed EMRE (11 kDa) bound to the 34-kDa MTS-processed MCU. We believe the change in this complex is largely responsible for the disparity between the SPG7 KO, which preferentially targets the m-AAA hexamer to process MCU, and DN SPG7, which affects MCU processing and EMRE processing through its inhibition of AFG3L2. We observed that SPG7 KO has a minimal effect on the processing from FL MCU to MTS MCU yet the DN SPG7 has a profound effect on this process. It is likely that the available pool of functional AFG3L2 homo-oligomers is reduced through overexpression of DN-SPG7, which integrates into the AFG3L2 complex. The remaining pool of functional AFG3L2 homohexamers is likely overwhelmed with substrate and the resulting backup of mitochondrial protein turnover leads to loss of protein homeostasis and degradation. This ultimately results in an accumulation of intermediate forms of all m-AAA protease substrates; whereas loss of SPG7 affects a select subset of substrates leaving the majority of mitochondrial proteins available to turnover at a level the cell can compensate.

One open question we did not extensively explore is if SPG7 is directly regulating MCUR1 or if the change in expression we observed was due to lack of fully processed MCU to aid with stabilizing the MCUR1 protein scaffold. Overexpression of MCUR1 in SPG7 KO and HEK 293T cells displayed reduced 25-kDa processed MCUR1 in the KO, but unlike with MCU overexpression, no increased appearance of the 37-kDa form. However, in DN SPG7 cells, overexpression of MCUR1 resulted in an increase in the full-length MCUR1 at 37 kDa as well as more 25-kDa MCUR1, suggesting that AFG3L2 may be responsible for clearance and turnover of MCUR1 (data not shown). The MCU residues identified as essential to binding to MCUR1 were amino acids 150–220 in the N-terminal domain region and to a lesser extent amino acids 291–320 ( 31 ). Based on the observed 30-kDa size of MCU we would expect the m-AAA protease to remove the C-terminal amino acids up to approximately amino 314–320 leaving the MCUR1-binding regions largely intact. The loss of MCUR1 itself has a significant impact on Ca 2+ sensitivity and threshold for opening of the mPTP ( 32 ). MCUR1 may act as a link between the MCU complex and the mPTP, thus less MCUR1 would keep Ca 2+ influx, and the high Ca 2+ nanodomains present at the MCU complex, separate from the mPTP; an idea affirmed by the observation that mitochondria can handle more Ca 2+ with a steady slow infusion of Ca 2+ versus a large bolus where rapid influx results in temporary nanodomains of high Ca 2+ due to the slower kinetics of the phosphate buffering ( 17 ). Indeed, loss of the C-terminal amino acids on MCU may be essential to exposing the MCUR1-binding site for efficient complex assembly.

When König et al. ( 16 ) knocked out SPG7 in their model they observed no change in CRC capacity, in contrast to both Shanmughapriya et al. ( 13 ) and our data. We believe the key difference is that they used a murine model, which also expresses the m-AAA protease AFG3L1 and was lost as a pseudogene in humans ( 20 ). Because AFG3L1 can form functional homohexamers as well as heterohexamers with AFG3L2 and SPG7 it is likely the loss of SPG7 alone can be compensated for as one of these murine-specific complexes may be able to efficiently target MCU. Indeed, the major differences between AFG3L1 and AFG3L2 reside in the N-terminal region, which is suggested as a domain that contributes to substrate recognition ( 30 ). Even though SPG7 is different from both AFG3L1 and AFG3L2 at the N terminus, rescuing the SPG7 KO cells with AFG3L1 restored the CRC phenotype back to WT as well as the basal Ca 2+ as assessed by Mt GCamp6f fluorescence. It is possible that rather than revealing a novel targeting motif the AFG3L1 and SPG7 subunits mask the AFG3L2-targeting site, which excludes substrates; a hypothesis we cannot rule out especially because SPG7 and AFG3L1 are quite different in the N-terminal motifs.

Whether SPG7 is acting solely through substrates of the MCU complex and we are observing an epistatic effect on mPTP regulation cannot be ruled out; the evidence there were no changes in ROS sensitivity of the mPTP in SPG7 KO, no changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, and that DN SPG7 expression did not alter the Ca 2+ levels in MCU KO cells leads us to conclude that changes in MCUc formation are likely the primary mechanism of action ( Fig. 8 , Fig. S1 ).

Our study investigated possible mechanisms for how m-AAA proteases could be both a positive and negative regulator of the mPTP. We conclude that SPG7 is not an essential component of the mPTP through its interaction with CypD, but rather a key regulator of the assembly of the mitochondrial Ca 2+ influx mechanism. Loss of SPG7 reduces MCU processing as well as MCUR1 levels, whereas inhibition of all m-AAA protease activity has the opposite effect. Loss of SPG7 reduces the capacity for mitochondria to uptake Ca 2+ at lower concentrations of Ca 2+ as well as decreasing the basal resting state of [Ca 2+ ] mt by reducing the number of fully functional MCU complexes. A chronic decrease in basal [Ca 2+ ] mt ultimately leads to compensatory effects in the mitochondria that alter the mPTP threshold and Ca 2+ sensitivity. Expression of DN-SPG7/loss of AFG3L2 further reduces the total pool of functional m-AAA proteases resulting in loss of mitochondrial protein homeostasis, formation of ungated MCU:EMRE channels, and increased levels of MCUR1. This ultimately leads to an increased basal [Ca 2+ ] mt and mPTP sensitivity.
