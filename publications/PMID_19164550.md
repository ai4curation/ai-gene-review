gC1qR is one of the C1q receptors implicated in the regulation of innate and 
adaptive immunity. We found that gC1qR inhibits RIG-I and MDA5-dependent 
antiviral signaling. Double stranded RNA and virus trigger the translocation of 
gC1qR to the mitochondrial outer membrane leading to the interaction of gC1qR 
with the RIG-I and MDA5 adaptor, VISA/MAVS/IPS-1/Cardif. The interaction of 
gC1qR with VISA/MAVS/IPS-1/Cardif at mitochondria results in the disruption of 
RIG-I and MDA5 signaling and the promotion of virus replication. Knockdown of 
endogenous gC1qR enhances RIG-I-dependent antiviral signaling, and augments the 
inhibition of virus proliferation. Therefore, gC1qR is a physiological inhibitor 
of the RIG-I and MDA5-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. These data uncover a 
new viral mechanism used to negatively control antiviral signaling in host 
cells.
