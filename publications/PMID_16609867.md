We have investigated the sequences and the expression patterns of different 
members of the Xenopus laevis FoxP gene subfamily during embryogenesis. Low 
stringency hybridisation of a tadpole cDNA library with an xlFoxP2 fragment led 
to the isolation of several splice variants of xlFoxP1, xlFoxP2 and xlFoxP4. 
These variants do not only differ by utilisation of different leader exons, but 
also by alternative usage of coding exons thereby leading to functional 
alterations. For xlFoxP1b, we show that insertion of an additional exon disrupts 
binding to the co-repressor C-terminal binding protein1. Temporal and spatial 
expression patterns of xlFoxP2 and xlFoxP4 were analysed by RT-PCR and by whole 
mount in situ hybridisation. xlFoxP2 transcripts are detected from mid-gastrula 
to late tadpole stages and are found to be localised to pronephros, branchial 
arches and distinct structures of the hind-, mid- and forebrain, including the 
ciliary marginal zone of the retina. xlFoxP4 RNA is already present in early 
cleavage stage embryos and accumulates from midblastula until the end of 
embryogenesis. Localised expression is found within the anterior neural fold, in 
the mid- and hindbrain, in the branchial arches as well as in the pancreas.
