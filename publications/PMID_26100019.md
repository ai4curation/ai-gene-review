DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicases play essential roles in numerous RNA metabolic 
processes, such as mRNA translation, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and 
double-stranded RNA sensing. Herein we show that a recently characterized 
DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicase, DHX33, promotes mRNA translation initiation. We 
isolated intact DHX33 protein/RNA complexes in cells and identified several 
ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and mRNAs. Reduction of DHX33 protein 
levels markedly reduced polyribosome formation and caused the global inhibition 
of mRNA translation that was rescued with wild-type DHX33 but not 
helicase-defective DHX33. Moreover, we observed an accumulation of mRNA 
complexes with the 80S ribosome in the absence of functional DHX33, consistent 
with a stalling in initiation, and DHX33 more preferentially promoted structured 
mRNA translation. We conclude that DHX33 functions to promote 
elongation-competent 80S ribosome assembly at the late stage of mRNA translation 
initiation. Our results reveal a newly recognized function of DHX33 in mRNA 
translation initiation, further solidifying its central role in promoting cell 
growth and proliferation.
