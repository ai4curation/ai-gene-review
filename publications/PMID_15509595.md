The maturation of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins in eukaryotes has been intensively 
studied in yeast. Hardly anything is known so far about the process in higher 
eukaryotes, even though the high conservation of the yeast maturation components 
in most Eukarya suggests similar mechanisms. Here, we developed a cell culture 
model in which the RNA interference (RNAi) technology was used to deplete a 
potential component of Fe/S protein maturation, frataxin, in human HeLa cells. 
This protein is lowered in humans with the neuromuscular disorder Friedreich's 
ataxia (FRDA). Upon frataxin depletion by RNAi, the enzyme activities of the 
mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, were 
decreased, while the activities of non-Fe/S proteins remained constant. 
Moreover, Fe/S cluster association with the cytosolic iron-regulatory protein 1 
was diminished. In contrast, no alterations in cellular iron uptake, iron 
content and heme formation were found, and no mitochondrial iron deposits were 
observed upon frataxin depletion. Hence, iron accumulation in FRDA mitochondria 
appears to be a late consequence of frataxin deficiency. These results 
demonstrate (i) that frataxin is a component of the human Fe/S cluster assembly 
machinery and (ii) that it plays a role in the maturation of both mitochondrial 
and cytosolic Fe/S proteins.
