The effect of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutation I2020T on its kinase 
activity has been controversial, with both increased and decreased effects being 
reported. We conducted steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic studies on 
LRRKtide and its analog LRRKtide(S). Their phosphorylation differs by the 
rate-limiting steps: product release is rate-limiting for LRRKtide and 
phosphoryl transfer is rate-limiting for LRRKtide(S). As a result, we observed 
that the I2020T mutant is more active than wild type (WT) LRRK2 for LRRKtide(S) 
phosphorylation, whereas it is less active than WT for LRRKtide phosphorylation. 
Our pre-steady-state kinetic data suggest that (i) the I2020T mutant accelerates 
the rates of phosphoryl transfer of both reactions by 3-7-fold; (ii) this 
increase is masked by a rate-limiting product release step for LRRKtide 
phosphorylation; and (iii) the observed lower activity of the mutant for 
LRRKtide phosphorylation is a consequence of its instability: the concentration 
of the active form of the mutant is 3-fold lower than WT. The I2020T mutant has 
a dramatically low KATP and therefore leads to resistance to ATP competitive 
inhibitors. Two well known DFG-out or type II inhibitors are also weaker toward 
the mutant because they inhibit the mutant in an unexpected ATP competitive 
mechanism. The I2020 residue lies next to the DYG motif of the activation loop 
of the LRRK2 kinase domain. Our modeling and metadynamic simulations suggest 
that the I2020T mutant stabilizes the DYG-in active conformation and creates an 
unusual allosteric pocket that can bind type II inhibitors but in an ATP 
competitive fashion.
