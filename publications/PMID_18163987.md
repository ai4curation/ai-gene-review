Members of the CDM (CED-5, Dock180, Myoblast city) superfamily of guanine 
nucleotide exchange factors function in diverse processes that include cell 
migration and myoblast fusion. Previous studies have shown that the SH3, DHR1 
and DHR2 domains of Myoblast city (MBC) are essential for it to direct myoblast 
fusion in the Drosophila embryo, while the conserved DCrk-binding proline rich 
region is expendable. Herein, we describe the isolation of Drosophila 
ELMO/CED-12, an approximately 82 kDa protein with a pleckstrin homology (PH) and 
proline-rich domain, by interaction with the MBC SH3 domain. Mass spectrometry 
confirms the presence of an MBC/ELMO complex within the embryonic musculature at 
the time of myoblast fusion and embryos maternally and/or zygotically mutant for 
elmo exhibit defects in myoblast fusion. Overexpression of MBC and ELMO in the 
embryonic mesoderm causes defects in myoblast fusion reminiscent of those seen 
with constitutively-activated Rac1, supporting the previous finding that both 
the absence of and an excess of Rac activity are deleterious to myoblast fusion. 
Overexpression of MBC and ELMO/CED-12 in the eye causes perturbations in 
ommatidial organization that are suppressed by mutations in Rac1 and Rac2, 
demonstrating genetically that MBC and ELMO/CED-12 cooperate to activate these 
small GTPases in Drosophila.
