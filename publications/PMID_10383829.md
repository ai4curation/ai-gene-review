Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase kappa (RPTPkappa) is expressed in the 
nervous system in a manner consistent with a role in axonal growth and guidance. 
The extracellular domain of RPTPkappa shares structural features with cell 
adhesion molecules and can support homophilic adhesion. In the present study we 
produced a soluble Fc-chimeric protein containing the full extracellular domain 
of RPTPkappa. Following affinity capture, the RPTPkappa-Fc was shown to promote 
the aggregation of Covasphere beads, confirming its homophilic binding activity. 
When added to cultures of cerebellar neurons as a soluble molecule, the 
RPTPkappa chimera stimulated neurite outgrowth. The neurite outgrowth response 
was substantially inhibited by a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of Grb2 and by 
PD 098059, a drug that has been used to inhibit MEK1 activation in a wide range 
of cell types. These results demonstrate that RPTPkappa can stimulate neurite 
outgrowth and provide evidence that this might involve the coupling of Grb2 to a 
MAPK signal transduction cascade.
