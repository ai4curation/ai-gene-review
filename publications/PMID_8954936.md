We have isolated a cDNA clone from a human placental choriocarcinoma cell (JAR) 
cDNA library which codes for a functional type 1 sigma receptor. An RT-PCR 
product obtained from guinea pig kidney mRNA using primers specific for the 
guinea pig sigma receptor cDNA was used to screen the cDNA library. The hSigmaR1 
cDNA predicts a protein of 223 amino acids with a single putative transmembrane 
domain. The amino acid sequence exhibits 93% identity with the guinea pig sigma 
receptor. When functionally expressed in HeLa cells, the hSigmaR1 cDNA enhances 
the binding of [3H]-haloperidol, a sigma receptor ligand, to the HeLa cell 
membranes. The inhibitor specificity of the cloned hSigmaR1 indicates that it is 
the type 1 sigma receptor. Several human tissues, including placenta, liver, and 
brain, and several human cell lines express the SigmaR1 mRNA (1.7 kb) to a 
variable extent.
