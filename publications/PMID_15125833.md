The CARD domain protein BCL10 and paracaspase MALT1 are essential for the 
activation of IkappaB kinase (IKK) and NF-kappaB in response to T cell receptor 
(TCR) stimulation. Here we present evidence that TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase and TAK1 
protein kinase mediate IKK activation by BCL10 and MALT1. RNAi-mediated 
silencing of MALT1, TAK1, TRAF6, and TRAF2 suppressed TCR-dependent IKK 
activation and interleukin-2 production in T cells. Furthermore, we have 
reconstituted the pathway from BCL10 to IKK activation in vitro with purified 
proteins of MALT1, TRAF6, TAK1, and ubiquitination enzymes including 
Ubc13/Uev1A. We find that a small fraction of BCL10 and MALT1 proteins form high 
molecular weight oligomers. Strikingly, only these oligomeric forms of BCL10 and 
MALT1 can activate IKK in vitro. The MALT1 oligomers bind to TRAF6, induce TRAF6 
oligomerization, and activate the ligase activity of TRAF6 to polyubiquitinate 
NEMO. These results reveal an oligomerization --> ubiquitination --> 
phosphorylation cascade that culminates in NF-kappaB activation in T 
lymphocytes.
