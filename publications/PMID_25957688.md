Macromolecular machines, such as the ribosome, undergo large-scale 
conformational changes during their functional cycles. Although their mode of 
action is often compared to that of mechanical machines, a crucial difference is 
that, at the molecular dimension, thermodynamic effects dominate functional 
cycles, with proteins fluctuating stochastically between functional states 
defined by energetic minima on an energy landscape. Here, we have used 
cryo-electron microscopy to image ex-vivo-derived human polysomes as a source of 
actively translating ribosomes. Multiparticle refinement and 3D variability 
analysis allowed us to visualize a variety of native translation intermediates. 
Significantly populated states include not only elongation cycle intermediates 
in pre- and post-translocational states, but also eEF1A-containing decoding and 
termination/recycling complexes. Focusing on the post-translocational state, we 
extended this assessment to the single-residue level, uncovering striking 
details of ribosome-ligand interactions and identifying both static and 
functionally important dynamic elements.

Introduction

At the heart of many biological processes are complex and dynamic macromolecular machines. Different from macroscopic machines, these operate intermittently rather than continuously. Because inertia is irrelevant at the nanometer scale, conformational changes are dominated by thermal forces ( Frauenfelder et al, 1991 ; Purcell, 1977 ). Consequently, macromolecular machines randomly sample all conformational states available to them at a given temperature, instead of passing smoothly from one functional state to the other ( Frauenfelder et al., 1991 ). Functional states represent local minima in their energy landscape, defined by energetically costly conformational changes required to transit to neighbouring minima.

The ribosome is an archetypical molecular machine, synthesizing proteins based on the primary sequence information encoded in messenger RNA (mRNA) templates ( Frank and Spahn, 2006 ; Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013 ). The ribosome consists of a large subunit (LSU; 60S in eukaryotes) containing the peptidyl transferase centre (PTC), and a small subunit (SSU; 40S in eukaryotes) containing the mRNA decoding centre (DC). Together, both subunits define three distinct transfer RNA-(tRNA-)binding sites in their intersubunit space, referred to as the aminoacyl-(A-)site responsible for binding and decoding incoming aminoacylated tRNAs, the peptidyl-(P-)site responsible for orienting the polypeptide-bearing P-site tRNA for efficient transamidation, and the exit-(E-)site responsible for subsequent release of deacylated tRNA.

Protein synthesis can be divided into the four phases initiation, elongation, termination and recycling ( Melnikov et al., 2012 ). Each phase comprises numerous distinct functional states, and multiple large-scale intra- and inter-subunit rearrangements of the ribosome and its ligands drive the functional cycle ( Dunkle and Cate, 2010 ; Korostelev et al., 2008 ). Dynamic single-molecule distance measurements show that these rearrangements are governed by a rugged energy landscape that is shaped by translation factors ( Munro et al., 2009 ; Petrov et al., 2011 ). Many functional intermediates of translation have been structurally analysed employing both X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) ( Moore, 2012 ; Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013 ). The focus of these studies has been on bacterial complexes, while considerably less is known about the structures of functional states sampled by ribosomes from higher eukaryotes. Traditionally, such structural studies rely on in vitro assembled complexes and on the use of antibiotics, tRNA mimics, non-hydrolysable nucleotide analogues or genetic modifications in order to stall ribosomes in defined states. It is still largely unknown if or how in vitro assemblies differ from their in vivo counterparts that are assembled in the complex context of the living cell. Only by investigating samples in a native(-like) setting can these issues be addressed. While cryo-electron tomography allows the visualization of individual, active molecular machines inside cells ( Brandt et al., 2010 ; Myasnikov et al., 2014 ), its resolution is limited.

Recognizing that in vitro systems are not able to account for the full complexity of in vivo environments, we considered studying native translation intermediates by imaging ex vivo -derived non-stalled and unmodified polysomes from human cell extracts using multiparticle cryo-EM. Polysomes are formed by actively translating ribosomes and are therefore expected to constitute a mixture of ribosomes in elongation states ( Rich et al., 1963 ). Thus, polysomes bear the potential to study the process of translation using one single specimen and to obtain not only multiple structural snapshots of functional states from the same sample, but also to determine the native distribution of states to approximate the positions of minima on the energy landscape, if conformational and compositional heterogeneity can be overcome by particle image sorting procedures ( Spahn and Penczek, 2009 ).

To further structural insights into the process of protein synthesis inside the living cell, we report here the structural analysis of ex vivo -derived human polysomes using multiparticle cryo-EM. We show that a variety of functional states are significantly populated, providing critical structural insights into minima of the energy landscape of the ribosomal elongation cycle and the rate-limiting steps close to the in vivo situation. We also demonstrate that subunit rolling ( Budkevich et al., 2014 ) indeed constitutes a degree of freedom sampled in vivo . Focussing on a larger subset of particle images, we solve the structure of the human 80S ribosome in the post-translocational state at near-atomic resolution despite conformational and compositional heterogeneity. The high-resolution cryo-EM map shows details of native interactions of the ribosome with its ligands, revealing a striking difference in the binding mode between P- and E-site tRNA binding in the unrotated state, and allows identifying both static and functionally important dynamic elements.

Conclusions

Our study and others have recently demonstrated that cryo-EM has opened up the way to study the structure of the ribosome at high resolution unconstrained by a crystal lattice. Furthermore, by relying on thorough in silico classification, we have demonstrated that defined structures corresponding to known and hitherto unknown intermediate states of translation can be obtained from ex vivo -derived elongating polysomes. Different from traditional “arrest and isolate” strategies, our approach has shed light on the preferred states of the human ribosome. This uncovered that while eEF2-mediated head rotation is paramount for translocation, corresponding functional states are only sparsely populated precluding visualization, corroborating the assumed short-lived nature of the translocation state. Analysing the full spectrum of significantly populated states of elongation has not only addressed the specific point of E-site tRNA release, but also uncovered that proofreading states of tRNA selection, after codon recognition and GTP hydrolysis, can be significantly populated, implying that tRNA accommodation is indeed a slower step. Importantly, despite the high degree of complexity of a native-like polysomal sample, we were able to overcome heterogeneity using a data-driven sorting scheme. This allowed us to resolve the native POST state to near-atomic resolution and thus highlight the divergent properties of P- and E-site and uncover dynamic elements in the ribosome, such as the decoding bases.
