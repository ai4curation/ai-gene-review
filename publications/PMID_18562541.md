The hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication complex (RC), which is composed of 
viral nonstructural (NS) proteins and host cellular proteins, replicates the 
viral RNA genome in association with intracellular membranes. Two viral NS 
proteins, NS3 and NS5A, are essential elements of the RC. Here, by using 
immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays, we 
demonstrated that NS3 and NS5A interact with tubulin and actin. Furthermore, 
immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy revealed that HCV RCs were 
aligned along microtubules and actin filaments in both HCV replicon cells and 
HCV-infected cells. In addition, the movement of RCs was inhibited when 
microtubules or actin filaments were depolymerized by colchicine and 
cytochalasin B, respectively. Based on our observations, we propose that 
microtubules and actin filaments provide the tracks for the movement of HCV RCs 
to other regions in the cell, and the molecular interactions between RCs and 
microtubules, or RCs and actin filaments, are mediated by NS3 and NS5A.

Abstract

The hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication complex (RC), which is composed of viral nonstructural (NS) proteins and host cellular proteins, replicates the viral RNA genome in association with intracellular membranes. Two viral NS proteins, NS3 and NS5A, are essential elements of the RC. Here, by using immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays, we demonstrated that NS3 and NS5A interact with tubulin and actin. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy revealed that HCV RCs were aligned along microtubules and actin filaments in both HCV replicon cells and HCV-infected cells. In addition, the movement of RCs was inhibited when microtubules or actin filaments were depolymerized by colchicine and cytochalasin B, respectively. Based on our observations, we propose that microtubules and actin filaments provide the tracks for the movement of HCV RCs to other regions in the cell, and the molecular interactions between RCs and microtubules, or RCs and actin filaments, are mediated by NS3 and NS5A.

DISCUSSION

In this study, by performing in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we showed that both NS3/NS4A and NS5A closely interacted with tubulin and actin (Fig. 3 ). This interaction was confirmed by FRET analysis; a specific FRET signal was detected between NS3 or NS5A and tubulin in HCV replicon cells. Significantly, the numbers of ROI with >20% FRET efficiency in both NS3-tubulin and NS5A-tubulin interactions were very similar, i.e., 39 ROIs or 43 ROIs, respectively (Fig. 5D ). We speculate that NS3 and NS5A first form an RC, which, acting as a whole, become associated with microtubules, resulting in similar FRET efficiencies. However, there were some ROIs with <10% FRET efficiency in either NS3-tubulin or NS5A-tubulin. The lower FRET efficiency may have come from cells with lower RNA replication activity.

As shown in Fig. 2 and 8 , immunofluorescence analysis using Abs against NS3, NS5A, or NS5 (a mixture of NS5A and NS5B) showed heterogeneously sized speckles tethered or docked with both microtubules and actin filaments in either replicon cells or HCV-infected cells. However, either NS3 or NS5A expressed alone did not show the speckle-like structure (data not shown) ( 29 ). These speckles contain BrUTP-labeled RNA (Fig. 4 ) ( 13 , 47 ). Therefore, these speckles most likely represent HCV RCs. Previous studies showed that HCV RNA replication takes place on the membranous web derived from the ER or other membranes ( 12 , 16 , 39 ) or detergent-resistant membrane structures, most likely a lipid raft membrane structure ( 2 , 47 ). The morphogenesis of the membranous web is still unknown, but the ER is a dynamic network of interconnected membrane tubules that pervades almost the entire cytoplasm. Microtubules are required for the maintenance of the ER ( 54 ) and probably membranous webs as well. Lipid rafts have a highly dynamic nature and are involved in vesicle membrane trafficking ( 7 ). In addition, microtubules and actin filaments are required for the morphogenesis of the lipid raft ( 22 ). The inhibition of actin and/or microtubules reduced levels of HCV replicon RNA ( 6 ). In addition, after the treatment of HCV replicon cells with either colchicine or cytochalasin B, no NS5A-containing speckle-like structure was observed, and all NS5A clustered in the perinuclear region (Fig. 7 ). We therefore hypothesize that microtubules and actin filaments are major determinants for the assembly and functioning of the HCV RC and also for their characteristic subcellular distribution. The transport of HCV RC along microtubules and actin filaments is likely important for the translation and replication of HCV RNA and also for the assembly of virus particles.

How NS3 or NS5A can interact with both microtubules and actin at the same time is an interesting question. By comparison, murine sarcoma virus-associated protein kinase also possesses the ability to interact with both actin and tubulin ( 45 ). A variety of cellular proteins such as microtubule-associated protein 2c ( 11 ) that mediate the interaction between microtubule and actin filaments have been identified. Our preliminary results suggest that NS3 and NS5A contain both actin- and microtubule-binding sites.

The association of HCV RCs with microtubules and actin filaments was demonstrated not only in HCV replicon cells but also in HCV-infected cells. More recently, Miyanari et al. demonstrated that HCV assembly occurs in close proximity to the lipid droplet ( 38 ). The lipid droplet is derived from discrete regions of the ER and is associated with microtubules ( 19 , 37 ). Future work will be necessary to confirm that both microtubules and actin filaments provide tracks for the transport of HCV RCs to reach the lipid droplet, where virus assembly occurs.
