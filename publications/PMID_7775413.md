A human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity, called AP endonuclease I, 
is missing from or altered specifically in cells cultured from Xeroderma 
pigmentosum group-D individuals (XP-D cells) (Kuhnlein, U., Lee, B., Penhoet, E. 
E., and Linn, S. (1978) Nucleic Acids Res. 5,951-960). We have now observed that 
another nuclease activity, UV endonuclease III, is similarly not detected in 
XP-D cells and is inseparable from the AP endonuclease I activity. This activity 
preferentially cleaves the phosphodiester backbone of heavily 
ultraviolet-irradiated DNA at unknown lesions as well as at one of the 
phosphodiester bonds within a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer. The nuclease 
activities have been purified from mouse cells to yield a peptide of M(r) = 
32,000, whose sequence indicates identity with ribosomal protein S3. The 
nuclease activities all cross-react with immunopurified antibody directed 
against authentic rat ribosomal protein S3, and, upon expression in Escherichia 
coli of a cloned rat cDNA for ribosomal protein S3, each of the activities was 
recovered and was indistinguishable from those of the mammalian UV endonuclease 
III. Moreover, the protein expressed in E. coli and its activities cross-react 
with the rat protein antibody. Ribosomal protein S3 contains a potential nuclear 
localization signal, and the protein isolated as a nuclease also has a 
glycosylation pattern consistent with a nuclear localization as determined by 
lectin binding. The unexpected role of a ribosomal protein in DNA damage 
processing and the unexplained inability to detect the nuclease activities in 
extracts from XP-D cells are discussed.
