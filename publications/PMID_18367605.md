Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized 
by bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor, is the most common 
neurodegenerative movement disorder. Although the majority of PD cases are 
sporadic, some are inherited, including those caused by leucine-rich repeat 
kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations. The substitution of serine for glycine at position 
2019 (G2019S) in the kinase domain of LRRK2 represents the most prevalent 
genetic mutation in both familial and apparently sporadic cases of PD. Because 
mutations in LRRK2 are likely associated with a toxic gain of function, 
destabilization of LRRK2 may be a novel way to limit its detrimental effects. 
Here we show that LRRK2 forms a complex with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in 
vivo and that inhibition of Hsp90 disrupts the association of Hsp90 with LRRK2 
and leads to proteasomal degradation of LRRK2. Hsp90 inhibitors may therefore 
limit the mutant LRRK2-elicited toxicity to neurons. As a proof of principle, we 
show that Hsp90 inhibitors rescue the axon growth retardation caused by 
overexpression of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation in neurons. Therefore, inhibition of 
LRRK2 kinase activity can be achieved by blocking Hsp90-mediated chaperone 
activity and Hsp90 inhibitors may serve as potential anti-PD drugs.
