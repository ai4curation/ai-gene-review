Hsp90 is an abundant molecular chaperone involved in a variety of cellular 
processes ranging from signal transduction to viral replication. The function of 
Hsp90 has been shown to be dependent on its ability to hydrolyze ATP, and in 
vitro studies suggest that the dimeric nature of Hsp90 is critical for this 
activity. ATP binding occurs at the N-terminal domains of the Hsp90 dimer, 
whereas the main dimerization site resides in the very C-terminal domain. ATP 
hydrolysis is performed in a series of conformational changes. These include the 
association of the two N-terminal domains, which has been shown to stimulate the 
hydrolysis reaction. In this study, we set out to identify regions in the 
N-terminal domain that are important for this interaction. We show that 
N-terminal deletion variants of Hsp90 are severely impaired in their ability to 
hydrolyze ATP. However, nucleotide binding of these constructs is similar to 
that of the wild type protein. Heterodimers of the Hsp90 deletion mutants with 
wild type protein showed that the first 24 amino acids play a crucial role 
during the ATPase reaction, because their deletion abolishes the 
trans-activation between the two N-terminal domains. We propose that the 
turnover rate of Hsp90 is decisively controlled by intermolecular interactions 
between the N-terminal domains.
