IL-7 is a cytokine produced by stromal cells, which binds to IL-7Rα and plays an 
important role for homeostasis of T lymphocytes. Excessive activities of 
IL-7-triggered signaling pathways causes autoimmune diseases. How IL-7-triggered 
signaling and immune effects are regulated is not fully understood. In this 
study, we show that the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) E3 ligase family 
member MARCH8 mediates K27-linked polyubiquitination of IL-7Rα, leading to its 
lysosomal degradation. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that MARCH8 meditates 
polyubiquitination of IL-7Rα at K265/K266, and mutation of these residues 
renders IL-7Rα resistance to MARCH8-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation. 
MARCH8 deficiency increases IL-7-triggered activation of the downstream 
transcription factor STAT5 and transcriptional induction of the effector genes 
in human T lymphoma cells. MARCH8 deficiency also promotes IL-7-triggered T cell 
proliferation and splenic memory CD8+ T cell differentiation in mice. Our 
findings suggest that MARCH8 negatively regulates IL-7-triggered signaling by 
mediating K27-linked polyubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of IL-7Rα, 
which reveals a negative regulatory mechanism of IL-7-triggered T cell 
homeostasis.
