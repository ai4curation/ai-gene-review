Signaling diversity and subsequent complexity in higher eukaryotes is partially 
explained by one gene encoding a polypeptide with multiple biochemical functions 
in different cellular contexts. For example, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) is 
functionally characterized as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, yet this 
dual classification confounds the cell biology and clinical literatures. 
Identified via complementary biochemical, organellar, and cellular approaches, 
we report that MDM2 negatively regulates NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa 
Fe-S protein 1 (NDUFS1), leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration, marked 
oxidative stress, and commitment to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. MDM2 
directly binds and sequesters NDUFS1, preventing its mitochondrial localization 
and ultimately causing complex I and supercomplex destabilization and 
inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The MDM2 amino-terminal region is 
sufficient to bind NDUFS1, alter supercomplex assembly, and induce apoptosis. 
Finally, this pathway is independent of p53, and several mitochondrial 
phenotypes are observed in Drosophila and murine models expressing transgenic 
Mdm2.
