Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a serine/threonine kinase that displays kinase 
activity predominantly in neurons, is activated by two non-cyclin activators, 
p35 or p39. Here, we report a physical and functional interaction between the 
Cdk5/p35 complex and mouse Sds3 (mSds3), an essential component of mSin3-histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) co-repressor complex. mSds3 binds to p35 both in vitro and in 
vivo, enabling active Cdk5 to phosphorylate mSds3 at serine 228. A mSds3 S228A 
mutant retained mSin3 binding activity, but its dimerization was not greatly 
enhanced by p35 when compared with wild type. Notably, p35 overexpression 
augmented mSds3-mediated transcriptional repression in vitro. Interestingly, 
mutational studies revealed that the ability of exogenous mSds3 to rescue cell 
growth and viability in mSds3 null cells correlates with its ability to be 
phosphorylated by Cdk5. The identification of mSds3 as a substrate of the 
Cdk5/p35 complex reveals a new regulatory mechanism in controlling the 
mSin3-HDAC transcriptional repressor activity and provides a new potential 
therapeutic means to inhibit specific HDAC activities in disease.
