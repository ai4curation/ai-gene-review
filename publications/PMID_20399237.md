Transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5) causes epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) for aberrant cell proliferation. However, the effects of TM4SF5 
expression on cell cycle are unknown so far. In this study, using hepatocytes 
that either ectopically or endogenously express TM4SF5 and human hepatocarcinoma 
tissues, the role of TM4SF5 in G1/S phase progression was examined. We found 
that TM4SF5 expression accelerated G1/S phase progression with facilitated 
cyclin D1 and E expression and Rb phosphorylation. Furthermore, TM4SF5 enhanced 
trafficking of CDK4 and cyclin D1 into the nucleus and induced complex formation 
between them. However, TM4SF5-facilitated G1/S phase progression was blocked by 
silencing of p27Kip1 using siRNA or by infection of active RhoA. Pharmacological 
inhibition of ROCK accelerated the G1/S phase progression of control 
TM4SF5-unexpressing cells. Altogether, these observations suggest that TM4SF5 
accelerates G1/S phase progression with facilitated CDK4/cyclin D1 entry into 
the nucleus, which might be supported by TM4SF5-mediated actin reorganization 
through cytosolic p27Kip1 expression and Rho GTPase activity.
