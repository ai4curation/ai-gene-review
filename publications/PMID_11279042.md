The 70-kDa heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones that participate in a 
variety of cellular functions. This chaperone function is stimulated by 
interaction with hsp40 proteins. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding the 
essential hsp40 homologue, SIS1, appears to function in translation initiation. 
Mutations in ribosomal protein L39 (rpl39) complement loss-of-function mutations 
in SIS1 as well as PAB1 (poly(A)-binding protein), suggesting a functional 
interaction between these proteins. However, while a direct interaction between 
Sis1 and Pab1 is not detectable, both of these proteins physically interact with 
the essential Ssa (and not Ssb) family of hsp70 proteins. This interaction is 
mediated by the variable C-terminal domain of Ssa. Subcellular fractionations 
demonstrate that the binding of Ssa to ribosomes is dependent upon its C 
terminus and that its interaction with Sis1 and Pab1 occurs preferentially on 
translating ribosomes. Consistent with a function in translation, depletion of 
Ssa protein produces a general translational defect that appears similar to loss 
of Sis1 and Pab1 function. This translational effect of Ssa appears mediated, at 
least in part, by its affect on the interaction of Pab1 with the translation 
initiation factor, eIF4G, which is dramatically reduced in the absence of 
functional Ssa protein.
