Keratin 8 and 18 (K8/18) are the major components of intermediate filament (IF) 
proteins of simple or single-layered epithelia. Recent data show that normal and 
malignant epithelial cells deficient in K8/18 are nearly 100 times more 
sensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell death. We have now 
identified human TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain protein 
(TRADD) to be the K18-interacting protein. Among IF proteins tested in 
two-hybrid systems, TRADD specifically bound K18 and K14, type I (acidic) 
keratins. The COOH-terminal region of TRADD interacted with the coil Ia of the 
rod domain of K18. Endogenous TRADD coimmunoprecipitated with K18, and 
colocalized with K8/18 filaments in human mammary epithelial cells. 
Overexpression of the NH2 terminus (amino acids 1-270) of K18 containing the 
TRADD-binding domain as well as overexpression of K8/18 in SW13 cells, which are 
devoid of keratins, rendered the cells more resistant to killing by TNF. We also 
showed that overexpressed NH2 termini of K18 and K8/18 were associated with 
endogenous TRADD in SW13 cells, resulting in the inhibition of caspase-8 
activation. These results indicate that K18 may sequester TRADD to attenuate 
interactions between TRADD and activated TNFR1 and moderate TNF-induced 
apoptosis in simple epithelial cells.
