HFE is an MHC-related protein that is mutated in the iron-overload disease 
hereditary hemochromatosis. HFE binds to transferrin receptor (TfR) and reduces 
its affinity for iron-loaded transferrin, implicating HFE in iron metabolism. 
The 2.6 A crystal structure of HFE reveals the locations of hemochromatosis 
mutations and a patch of histidines that could be involved in pH-dependent 
interactions. We also demonstrate that soluble TfR and HFE bind tightly at the 
basic pH of the cell surface, but not at the acidic pH of intracellular 
vesicles. TfR:HFE stoichiometry (2:1) differs from TfR:transferrin stoichiometry 
(2:2), implying a different mode of binding for HFE and transferrin to TfR, 
consistent with our demonstration that HFE, transferrin, and TfR form a ternary 
complex.
