Protein-protein complexes remain enticing, but extremely challenging, targets 
for small-molecule drug discovery. In a rare example described earlier, a 
high-affinity small molecule, SP4206 (Kd approximately 70 nM), was found to 
block binding of the IL-2alpha receptor (IL-2Ralpha) to IL-2 (Kd approximately 
10 nM). Recently, the structure of the IL-2/IL-2Ralpha complex was solved 
[Rickert, M., Wang, X., Boulanger, M. J., Goriatcheva, N., Garcia, K. C. (2005) 
Science 308:1477-1480]. Using structural and functional analysis, we compare how 
SP4206 mimics the 83-fold larger IL-2Ralpha in binding IL-2. The binding free 
energy per contact atom (ligand efficiency) for SP4206 is about twice that of 
the receptor because of a smaller, but overlapping, contact epitope that 
insinuates into grooves and cavities not accessed by the receptor. Despite its 
independent design, the small molecule has a similar, but more localized, charge 
distribution compared with IL-2Ralpha. Mutational studies show that SP4206 
targets virtually the same critical "hot-spot" residues on IL-2 that drive 
binding of IL-2Ralpha. Moreover, a mutation that enhances binding to the 
IL-2Ralpha near these hot spots also enhances binding to SP4206. Although the 
protein and small molecule do bind the same hot spot, they trap very different 
conformations of IL-2 because of its flexible nature. Our studies suggest that 
precise structural mimics of receptors are not required for high-affinity 
binding of small molecules, and they show that there are multiple solutions to 
tight binding at shared and adaptive hot spots.
