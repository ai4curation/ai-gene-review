We have identified a novel low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family member, 
termed LDL receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3), which is expressed in 
neurons. The LRAD3 gene encodes an ∼50 kDa type I transmembrane receptor with an 
ectodomain containing three LDLa repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a 
cytoplasmic domain containing a conserved dileucine internalization motif and 
two polyproline motifs with potential to interact with WW-domain-containing 
proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse brain reveals LRAD3 expression 
in the cortex and hippocampus. In the mouse hippocampal-derived cell line HT22, 
LRAD3 partially colocalizes with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and interacts 
with APP as revealed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. To identify the 
portion of APP that interacts with LRAD3, we used solid-phase binding assays 
that demonstrated that LRAD3 failed to bind to a soluble APP fragment (sAPPα) 
released after α-secretase cleavage. In contrast, C99, the β-secretase product 
that remains cell associated, coprecipitated with LRAD3, confirming that regions 
within this portion of APP are important for associating with LRAD3. The 
association of LRAD3 with APP increases the amyloidogenic pathway of APP 
processing, resulting in a decrease in sAPPα production and increased Aβ peptide 
production. Pulse-chase experiments confirm that LRAD3 expression significantly 
decreases the cellular half-life of mature APP. These results reveal that LRAD3 
influences APP processing and raises the possibility that LRAD3 alters APP 
function in neurons, including its downstream signaling.
