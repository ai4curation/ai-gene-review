The protein insertion complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane is crucial for 
import of the numerous multitopic membrane proteins with internal targeting 
signals. Little is known about the molecular mechanism of this complex, 
including whether it forms a real channel or merely acts as scaffold for protein 
insertion. We report the unexpected observation that Tim22 is the only essential 
membrane-integrated subunit of the complex. Reconstituted Tim22 forms a 
hydrophilic, high-conductance channel with distinct opening states and pore 
diameters. The channel is voltage-activated and specifically responds to an 
internal targeting signal, but not to presequences. Thus, a protein insertion 
complex can combine three essential functions, signal recognition, channel 
formation, and energy transduction, in one central component.
