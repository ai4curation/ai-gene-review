Lysosomes maintain an acidic pH of 4.5-5.0, optimal for macromolecular 
degradation. Whereas proton influx is produced by a V-type H+ ATPase, proton 
efflux is mediated by a fast H+ leak through TMEM175 channels, as well as an 
unidentified slow pathway. A candidate screen on an orphan lysosome membrane 
protein (OLMP) library enabled us to discover that SLC7A11, the protein target 
of the ferroptosis-inducing compound erastin, mediates a slow lysosomal H+ leak 
through downward flux of cystine and glutamate, two H+ equivalents with uniquely 
large but opposite concentration gradients across lysosomal membranes. SLC7A11 
deficiency or inhibition caused lysosomal over-acidification, reduced 
degradation, accumulation of storage materials, and ferroptosis, as well as 
facilitated α-synuclein aggregation in neurons. Correction of abnormal lysosomal 
acidity restored lysosome homeostasis and prevented ferroptosis. These studies 
have revealed an unconventional H+ transport conduit that is integral to 
lysosomal flux of protonatable metabolites to regulate lysosome function, 
ferroptosis, and Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology.
