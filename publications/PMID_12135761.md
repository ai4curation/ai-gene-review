The p53 tumor suppressor protein induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in 
response to cellular stresses. We have identified PRG3 (p53-responsive gene 3), 
which is induced specifically under p53-dependent apoptotic conditions in human 
colon cancer cells, and encodes a novel polypeptide of 373 amino acids with a 
predicted molecular mass of 40.5 kDa. PRG3 has significant homology to bacterial 
oxidoreductases and the apoptosis-inducing factor, AIF, and the gene was 
assigned to chromosome 10q21.3-q22.1. Expression of PRG3 was induced by the 
activation of endogenous p53 and it contains a p53-responsive element. Unlike 
AIF, PRG3 localizes in the cytoplasm and its ectopic expression induces 
apoptosis. An amino-terminal deletion mutant of PRG3 that lacks a putative 
oxidoreductase activity retains its apoptotic activity, suggesting that the 
oxidoreductase activity is dispensable for the apoptotic function of PRG3. The 
PRG3 gene is thus a novel p53 target gene in a p53-dependent apoptosis pathway.
