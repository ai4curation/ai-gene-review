UL16-binding proteins [ULBPs, also termed as retinoic acid early transcripts 
(RAET1) molecules] are frequently expressed by malignant transformed cells and 
stimulate anti-tumor immune responses mediated by NKG2D-positive NK cells, 
CD8(+) alphabeta T cells and gammadelta T cells in vitro and in vivo. In this 
study, we identified four novel functional splice variants of ULBPs including 
ULBP4-I, ULBP4-II, ULBP4-III and RAET1G3 in HepG2 liver carcinoma cells, WISH 
human amnion cells, Hep-2 larynx carcinoma cells and K562 leukemia cells, 
respectively, by reverse transcription-PCR and T vector cloning strategy. 
Analysis of alignments of amino acid sequences of the splice variants 
illustrated that there were important modifications between splice variants and 
their individual parental ULBP. All ULBP4 splice variants (ULBP4-I, ULBP4-II and 
ULBP4-III) were type 1 membrane-spanning molecules and had the ability to bind 
with human NKG2D receptor in vitro. Ectopic expressions of ULBP4 and ULBP4 
splice variants resulted in the enhanced cytotoxic sensitivity of target cells 
against NK cells, which could be blocked by anti-NKG2D mAb. Moreover, 
co-culture-free soluble forms of ULBP4 splice variants (their alpha1 + alpha2 
ectodomains) and RAET1G3 (soluble splice variant of RAET1G2) with NK cells 
down-regulated the cell surface expression of NKG2D. Finally, immobilized in a 
plate-bound form of RAET1G3 stimulated NK cells to secrete IFN-gamma. Taken 
together, all the identified functional splice variants will help to advance our 
knowledge regarding the overall functions of ULBP gene family.
