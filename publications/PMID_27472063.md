Programmed cell death is an essential aspect of animal development. Mutations in 
vertebrate genes that mediate apoptosis only mildly perturb development, 
suggesting that other cell death modes likely have important roles. Linker 
cell-type death (LCD) is a morphologically conserved cell death form operating 
during the development of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrates. We recently 
described a molecular network governing LCD in C. elegans, delineating a key 
role for the transcription factor heat-shock factor 1 (HSF-1). Although HSF-1 
functions to protect cells from stress in many settings by inducing expression 
of protein folding chaperones, it promotes LCD by inducing expression of the 
conserved E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme LET-70/UBE2D2, which is not induced by 
stress. Following whole-genome RNA interference and candidate gene screens, we 
identified and characterized four conserved regulators required for LCD. Here we 
show that two of these, NOB-1/Hox and EOR-1/PLZF, act upstream of HSF-1, in the 
context of Wnt signaling. A third protein, NHR-67/TLX/NR2E1, also functions 
upstream of HSF-1, and has a separate activity that prevents precocious 
expression of HSF-1 transcriptional targets. We demonstrate that the 
SET-16/mixed lineage leukemia 3/4 (MLL3/4) chromatin regulation complex 
functions at the same step or downstream of HSF-1 to control LET-70/UBE2D2 
expression. Our results identify conserved proteins governing LCD, and 
demonstrate that transcriptional regulators influence this process at multiple 
levels.
