During anther development a series of cell specification events establishes the 
male gametophyte and the surrounding sporophytic structure. Here we show that 
the homeobox gene WUSCHEL, originally identified as a central regulator of stem 
cell maintenance, plays an important role in cell type specification during male 
organogenesis. WUS expression is initiated very early during anther development 
in the precursor cells of the stomium and terminates just before the stomium 
cells enter terminal differentiation. At this stage the stomium cells and the 
neighboring septum cells that separate the pollen sacs undergo typical cell wall 
thickening and degenerate which leads to rupture of the anther and pollen 
release. In wus mutants, neither stomium cells nor septum cells differentiate or 
undergo cell death and degenerate. As a consequence, the anther stays intact and 
pollen is not released. CLAVATA3 which is activated by WUS in stem cell 
maintenance, is not activated in anthers indicating a novel pathway regulated by 
WUS. Comparing WUS function in stem cell maintenance and sexual organ 
development suggests that WUS expressing cells represent a conserved signaling 
module that regulates behavior and communication of undifferentiated cells.
