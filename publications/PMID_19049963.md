Mammalian 14-3-3 proteins play a crucial role in the activation process of RAF 
kinases. However, little is known about the selectivity of the mammalian 14-3-3 
isoforms with respect to RAF association and activation. Using mass 
spectrometry, we analyzed the composition of the 14-3-3 isoforms attached to RAF 
kinases and found that B-RAF associates in vivo with 14-3-3 at much higher 
diversity than A- and C-RAF. We also examined in vitro binding of purified 
mammalian 14-3-3 proteins to RAF kinases using surface plasmon resonance 
techniques. While B- and C-RAF exhibited binding to all seven 14-3-3 isoforms, 
A-RAF bound with considerably lower affinities to epsilon, tau, and sigma 
14-3-3. These findings indicate that 14-3-3 proteins associate with RAF isoforms 
in a pronounced isoform-specific manner. Because 14-3-3 proteins appear in 
dimeric forms, we addressed the question of whether both homo- and heterodimeric 
forms of 14-3-3 proteins participate in RAF signaling. For that purpose, the 
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, possessing only two 14-3-3 isoforms 
(BMH1 and BMH2), served as testing system. By deletion of the single BMH2 gene, 
we found that both homo- and heterodimeric forms of 14-3-3 can participate in 
RAF activation. Furthermore, we show that A-, B-, and C-RAF activity is 
differentially regulated by its C-terminal and internal 14-3-3 binding domain. 
Finally, prohibitin, a scaffold protein that affects C-RAF activation in a 
stimulatory manner, proved to interfere with the internal 14-3-3 binding site in 
C-RAF. Together, our results shed more light on the complex mechanism of RAF 
activation, particularly with respect to activation steps that are mediated by 
14-3-3 proteins and prohibitin.
