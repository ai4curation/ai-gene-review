The CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) gene encodes a MYB-related transcription 
factor involved in the phytochrome induction of a light-harvesting chlorophyll 
a/b-protein (Lhcb) gene. Expression of the CCA1 gene is transiently induced by 
phytochrome and oscillates with a circadian rhythm. Constitutive expression of 
CCA1 protein in transgenic plants abolished the circadian rhythm of several 
genes with dramatically different phases. These plants also had longer 
hypocotyls and delayed flowering, developmental processes regulated by light and 
the circadian clock. Furthermore, the expression of both endogenous CCA1 and the 
related LHY gene was suppressed. Our results suggest that CCA1 is a part of a 
feedback loop that is closely associated with the circadian clock in 
Arabidopsis.
