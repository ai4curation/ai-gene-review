PALB2 physically and functionally connects the proteins encoded by the BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 breast and ovarian cancer genes into a DNA-damage-response network. 
However, it remains unclear how these proteins associate with chromatin that 
contains damaged DNA. We show here that PALB2 binds directly to a conserved 
chromodomain protein, MRG15, which is a component of histone 
acetyltransferase-deacetylase complexes. This interaction was identified by 
analysis of purified MRG15- and PALB2-containing protein complexes. Furthermore, 
MRG15 interacts with the entire BRCA complex, which contains BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA2 
and RAD51. Interestingly, MRG15-deficient cells, similarly to cells deficient in 
PALB2 or BRCA2, showed reduced efficiency for homology-directed DNA repair and 
hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. Additionally, knockdown 
of MRG15 diminished the recruitment of PALB2, BRCA2 and RAD51 to sites of DNA 
damage and reduced chromatin loading of PALB2 and BRCA2. These results suggest 
that MRG15 mediates DNA-damage-response functions of the BRCA complex in 
chromatin.
