Members of the lysine (K)-specific demethylase 4 (KDM4) A-D family of histone 
demethylases are dysregulated in several types of cancer. Here, we reveal a 
previously unrecognized role of KDM4D in the DNA damage response (DDR). We show 
that the C-terminal region of KDM4D mediates its rapid recruitment to DNA damage 
sites. Interestingly, this recruitment is independent of the DDR sensor ataxia 
telangiectasia mutated (ATM), but dependent on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 
(PARP1), which ADP ribosylates KDM4D after damage. We demonstrate that KDM4D is 
required for efficient phosphorylation of a subset of ATM substrates. We note 
that KDM4D depletion impairs the DNA damage-induced association of ATM with 
chromatin, explaining its effect on ATM substrate phosphorylation. Consistent 
with an upstream role in DDR, KDM4D knockdown disrupts the damage-induced 
recombinase Rad51 and tumor protein P53 binding protein foci formation. 
Consequently, the integrity of homology-directed repair and nonhomologous end 
joining of DNA breaks is impaired in KDM4D-deficient cells. Altogether, our 
findings implicate KDM4D in DDR, furthering the links between the 
cancer-relevant networks of epigenetic regulation and genome stability.

Abstract

Members of the lysine (K)-specific demethylase 4 (KDM4) A–D family of histone demethylases are dysregulated in several types of cancer. Here, we reveal a previously unrecognized role of KDM4D in the DNA damage response (DDR). We show that the C-terminal region of KDM4D mediates its rapid recruitment to DNA damage sites. Interestingly, this recruitment is independent of the DDR sensor ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), but dependent on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), which ADP ribosylates KDM4D after damage. We demonstrate that KDM4D is required for efficient phosphorylation of a subset of ATM substrates. We note that KDM4D depletion impairs the DNA damage-induced association of ATM with chromatin, explaining its effect on ATM substrate phosphorylation. Consistent with an upstream role in DDR, KDM4D knockdown disrupts the damage-induced recombinase Rad51 and tumor protein P53 binding protein foci formation. Consequently, the integrity of homology-directed repair and nonhomologous end joining of DNA breaks is impaired in KDM4D-deficient cells. Altogether, our findings implicate KDM4D in DDR, furthering the links between the cancer-relevant networks of epigenetic regulation and genome stability.

Discussion

KDM4D belongs to the KDM4 family that demethylates H3K9me2/me3 marks and consists of evolutionarily conserved JmjN and JmjC domains at its N terminus whereas the overall sequence of C-terminal region contains no obvious characterized domains ( 16 ). This study revealed that KDM4D is swiftly recruited to sites of damage in a PARP1-dependent manner. Moreover, we show that KDM4D promotes the phosphorylation of early DNA damage markers and also facilitates the formation of Rad51 and 53BP1 foci. Consequently, KDM4D depletion affects the integrity of HDR and NHEJ of DSBs. These results uncover an unprecedented role of KDM4D lysine demethylase in DNA damage repair of DSBs.

Our data implicate KDM4D in the early events of DDR, as it promotes the phosphorylation H2AX, the earliest known marker of DNA damage ( Figs. 6 D and 7 A ). How does KDM4D influence H2AX phosphorylation? ATM levels at chromatin are known to increase in response to DNA damage ( 38 ). Here, we show that KDM4D inhibits the DNA damage-dependent increase in ATM at chromatin ( Fig. 6 F ), thereby impeding the accessibility of ATM kinase to its chromatin substrates, providing a possible explanation for the impairment of H2AX phosphorylation. Subsequently, the reduction in KAP1 and Chk2 phosphorylation and the impairment of Rad51 and 53BP1 foci formation in KDM4D-depleted cells can be a consequence of the inefficient phosphorylation of H2AX. Alternatively, KDM4D activity can directly promote the phosphorylation and the foci formation of these downstream targets of DNA damage.

A key question is how KDM4D facilitates the localization of ATM at chromatin. One possibility is that KDM4D-dependent demethylation of ATM is involved in its retention at chromatin. Second is that KDM4D might serve as a scaffold protein for recruiting ATM to chromatin. However, immunoprecipitation experiments show that KDM4D does not interact with ATM kinase, indicating that the alleged ATM–KDM4D interaction is either weak or transient and is likely lost during pull-down assays. Third is that the demethylase activity of KDM4D facilitates the accessibility of ATM kinase to its substrates, which can be achieved by relaxing the chromatin structure through local demethylation of H3K9me2/me3 surrounding the DNA damage sites. Indeed, it was shown that the levels of H3K9me2/3 in γH2AX-positive regions decrease after damage ( 29 , 45 ).

Our results show that PARP1 regulates KDM4D recruitment to sites of DNA damage ( Figs. 3 – 5 ), suggesting that both proteins might act in the same pathway of DDR. However, whereas KDM4D depletion reduces HDR of DSB, PARP1 inhibition results in hyper recombination ( 46 ). These apparently controversial observations can be due to the fact that KDM4D and PARP1 have distinct functions that are independent of each other. Therefore, we do not necessarily anticipate that PARP1 depletion phenotype phenocopies the phenotype of KDM4D depletion. Indeed, PARP1 depletion does not phenocopy depletion of meiotic recombination 11 homolog (MRE11), another protein in the DNA damage response that depends on PARylation for recruitment ( 47 ). Interestingly, our results are consistent with recent evidence showing that the depletion of MRE11, Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1, and chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) proteins, whose recruitment to sites of DNA damage is regulated by PARP1, disrupts the HDR of DSB ( 47 – 49 ). Moreover, the rapid and transient recruitment of KDM4D to sites of DNA damage is in line with the increasing numbers of DDR proteins that show transient recruitment, but long lasting effect on repair and/or DNA damage-induced foci formation ( 49 – 55 ).

PARP1 is known to modulate chromatin structure at DNA damage sites by PARylating histones ( 56 ) and nonhistone proteins ( 57 – 60 ). Here, we suggest that PARP1 modifies chromatin structure also through recruiting KDM4D histone demethylase to sites of DNA damage. Similarly, it was recently shown that PARP1 and Really Interesting New Gene finger protein (RNF)8 ubiquitin ligase regulate the recruitment of the catalytic subunit of the NuRD repressor complex, CHD4, to DNA-breakage sites ( 49 , 61 ). CHD4 recruitment to sites of DNA damage is much slower (5 min) compared with KDM4D recruitment (15 s), suggesting that KDM4D may function upstream of CHD4.

Many of the DNA damage repair proteins form immunofluorescence-detectable foci in response to DNA damage. Interestingly, no such foci of KDM4D were formed in response to IR or after exposing cells to genotoxic agents. This observation is similar to the behavior of other known DDR proteins, such as CHD4 ( 49 ), Lupus Ku autoantigen protein P70 (Ku70), Lupus Ku autoantigen protein P86 (Ku86) ( 62 ), RNF4 ( 63 ), and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) ( 5 , 64 ), that remain diffuse throughout the nucleus in response to IR. Nevertheless, we were able to convincingly show KDM4D recruitment to a single double strand break generated by I-Sce-I endonuclease.

Many of the DNA damage repair proteins form immunofluorescence-detectable foci in response to DNA damage. Interestingly, no such foci of KDM4D were formed in response to IR or after exposing cells to genotoxic agents, such as etoposide. Nevertheless, we were able to convincingly show that KDM4D accumulates at etoposide-damaged chromatin ( Fig. 1 F ) and is recruited to DSBs generated by I-Sce-I endonuclease ( Fig. 1 G ). This behavior is similar to other known DDR proteins, such as CHD4 ( 49 ), Ku70, Ku86 ( 62 ), RNF4 ( 63 ), and HP1 ( 5 , 64 ), that remain diffuse throughout the nucleus in response to IR or genotoxic treatments but show accumulation at damaged chromatin ( 49 , 65 , 66 ) and are recruited to I-Sce-I–induced DSBs ( 67 ). The inability to visualize DNA damage-induced foci by conventional immunofluorescence could be therefore due to technical obstacles rather than lack of recruitment to damaged chromatin.

How does KDM4D facilitate DSBs repair? Our data suggest that the defective HDR and NHEJ in KDM4D-depleted cells is likely to be caused by the inefficient formation of Rad51 and 53BP1 foci. In support of this suggestion, several published reports show that inhibition of Rad51 foci formation disrupts the HDR integrity of DSB ( 68 – 70 ) and that knockdown of 53BP1 impairs NHEJ ( 42 , 43 ).

In summary, here, we present previously unidentified evidence linking KDM4D histone demethylase to the initiation of the DNA damage-signaling cascade and to the repair of DSBs. Importantly, we demonstrate that KDM4D is critical for the association of ATM with chromatin, thus providing a possible explanation for the impaired phosphorylation of ATM substrates. Identifying KDM4D histone demethylase as an additional player in DSB repair will help us to better understand the molecular mechanisms that ensure efficient repair of DNA lesions to maintain genomic stability.
