Meiotic chromosome segregation requires homologous pairing, synapsis and 
crossover recombination during meiotic prophase. The checkpoint kinase ATR has 
been proposed to be involved in the quality surveillance of these processes, 
although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In our present study, 
we generated mice lacking HORMAD2, a protein that localizes to unsynapsed 
meiotic chromosomes. We show that this Hormad2 deficiency hampers the proper 
recruitment of ATR activity to unsynapsed chromosomes. Male Hormad2-deficient 
mice are infertile due to spermatocyte loss as a result of characteristic 
impairment of sex body formation; an ATR- and γH2AX-enriched repressive 
chromatin domain is formed, but is partially dissociated from the elongated sex 
chromosome axes. In contrast to males, Hormad2-deficient females are fertile. 
However, our analysis of Hormad2/Spo11 double-mutant females shows that the 
oocyte number is negatively correlated with the frequency of pseudo-sex body 
formation in a Hormad2 gene dosage-dependent manner. This result suggests that 
the elimination of Spo11-deficient asynaptic oocytes is associated with the 
HORMAD2-dependent pseudo-sex body formation that is likely initiated by local 
concentration of ATR activity in the absence of double-strand breaks. Our 
results thus show a HORMAD2-dependent quality control mechanism that recognizes 
unsynapsis and recruits ATR activity during mammalian meiosis.
