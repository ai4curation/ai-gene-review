Tight regulation of the balance between apoptosis and survival is essential in 
angiogenesis. The ETS transcription factor Erg is required for endothelial tube 
formation in vitro. Inhibition of Erg expression in human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs), using antisense oligonucleotides, resulted in 
detachment of cell-cell contacts and increased cell death. Inhibition of Erg 
expression by antisense in HUVECs also lowered expression of the adhesion 
molecule vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, a key regulator of endothelial 
intercellular junctions and survival. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we 
showed that Erg binds to the VE-cadherin promoter. Furthermore, Erg was found to 
enhance VE-cadherin promoter activity in a transactivation assay. Apoptosis 
induced by inhibition of Erg was partly rescued by overexpression of 
VE-cadherin-GFP, suggesting that VE-cadherin is involved in the Erg-dependent 
survival signals. To show the role of Erg in angiogenesis in vivo, we used siRNA 
against Erg in a Matrigel plug model. Erg inhibition resulted in a significant 
decrease in vascularization, with increase in caspase-positive endothelial cells 
(ECs). These results identify a new pathway regulating angiogenesis and 
endothelial survival, via the transcription factor Erg and the adhesion molecule 
VE-cadherin.
