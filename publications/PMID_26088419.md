The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in adult forebrain is a heterotetramer 
mainly composed of two GluN1 subunits and two GluN2A and/or GluN2B subunits. The 
synaptic expression and relative numbers of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs 
play critical roles in controlling Ca(2+)-dependent signaling and synaptic 
plasticity. Previous studies have suggested that the synaptic trafficking of 
NMDAR subtypes is differentially regulated, but the precise molecular mechanism 
is not yet clear. In this study, we demonstrated that Bip, an endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) chaperone, selectively interacted with GluN2A and mediated the 
neuronal activity-induced assembly and synaptic incorporation of the 
GluN2A-containing NMDAR from dendritic ER. Furthermore, the GluN2A-specific 
synaptic trafficking was effectively disrupted by peptides interrupting the 
interaction between Bip and GluN2A. Interestingly, fear conditioning in mice was 
disrupted by intraperitoneal injection of the interfering peptide before 
training. In summary, we have uncovered a novel mechanism for the 
activity-dependent supply of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs, and demonstrated 
its relevance to memory formation.
