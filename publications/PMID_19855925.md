Myelin basic protein (MBP) is present between the cytoplasmic leaflets of the 
compact myelin membrane in both the peripheral and central nervous systems, and 
characterized to be intrinsically disordered in solution. One of the 
best-characterized protein ligands for MBP is calmodulin (CaM), a highly acidic 
calcium sensor. We pulled down MBP from human brain white matter as the major 
calcium-dependent CaM-binding protein. We then used full-length brain MBP, and a 
peptide from rodent MBP, to structurally characterize the MBP-CaM complex in 
solution by small-angle X-ray scattering, NMR spectroscopy, synchrotron 
radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography. We 
determined 3D structures for the full-length protein-protein complex at 
different stoichiometries and detect ligand-induced folding of MBP. We also 
obtained thermodynamic data for the two CaM-binding sites of MBP, indicating 
that CaM does not collapse upon binding to MBP, and show that CaM and MBP 
colocalize in myelin sheaths. In addition, we analyzed the post-translational 
modifications of rat brain MBP, identifying a novel MBP modification, 
glucosylation. Our results provide a detailed picture of the MBP-CaM 
interaction, including a 3D model of the complex between full-length proteins.
