Selectin-dependent cell adhesion mediates inflammatory extravasation and routine 
homing of lymphocytes. Most resting peripheral T lymphocytes lack expression of 
sialyl Lewis X, the carbohydrate ligand for selectins, and are induced to 
strongly express it upon activation. T helper 1 (Th1) cells are known to more 
preferentially express sialyl Lewis X as compared with T helper 2 (Th2) cells 
upon activation. The molecular basis for this preferential expression, however, 
has not been elucidated to date. Here we show that the gene for 
fucosyltransferase VII (FUT7), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl Lewis X 
synthesis, is a unique example of the human genes with binding sites for both 
GATA-3 and T-bet, two opposing factors for Th1 and Th2 development, and is 
regulated transcriptionally by a balance of the two interacting transcription 
factors. T-bet promotes and GATA-3 represses FUT7 transcription. Our results 
indicated that T-bet interferes with the binding of GATA-3 to its target DNA, 
and also that GATA-3 significantly interferes with the binding of T-bet to the 
FUT7 promoter. T-bet has a binding ability to GATA-3, CBP/P300, and Sp1 to form 
a transcription factor complex, and GATA-3 regulates FUT7 transcription by 
phosphorylation-dependently recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC)-3/HDAC-5 and 
by competing with CBP/P300 in binding to the N terminus of T-bet. Suppression of 
GATA-3 activity by dominant-negative GATA-3 or repressor of GATA (ROG) was 
necessary to attain a maximum expression of FUT7 and sialyl Lewis X in human T 
lymphoid cells. These results indicate that the GATA-3/T-bet transcription 
factor complex regulates the cell-lineage-specific expression of the lymphocyte 
homing receptors.

Abstract

Selectin-dependent cell adhesion mediates inflammatory extravasation and routine homing of lymphocytes. Most resting peripheral T lymphocytes lack expression of sialyl Lewis X, the carbohydrate ligand for selectins, and are induced to strongly express it upon activation. T helper 1 (Th1) cells are known to more preferentially express sialyl Lewis X as compared with T helper 2 (Th2) cells upon activation. The molecular basis for this preferential expression, however, has not been elucidated to date. Here we show that the gene for fucosyltransferase VII ( FUT7 ), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl Lewis X synthesis, is a unique example of the human genes with binding sites for both GATA-3 and T-bet, two opposing factors for Th1 and Th2 development, and is regulated transcriptionally by a balance of the two interacting transcription factors. T-bet promotes and GATA-3 represses FUT7 transcription. Our results indicated that T-bet interferes with the binding of GATA-3 to its target DNA, and also that GATA-3 significantly interferes with the binding of T-bet to the FUT7 promoter. T-bet has a binding ability to GATA-3, CBP/P300, and Sp1 to form a transcription factor complex, and GATA-3 regulates FUT7 transcription by phosphorylation-dependently recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC)-3/HDAC-5 and by competing with CBP/P300 in binding to the N terminus of T-bet. Suppression of GATA-3 activity by dominant-negative GATA-3 or repressor of GATA (ROG) was necessary to attain a maximum expression of FUT7 and sialyl Lewis X in human T lymphoid cells. These results indicate that the GATA-3/T-bet transcription factor complex regulates the cell-lineage-specific expression of the lymphocyte homing receptors.

Discussion

Selectin-mediated cell adhesion mediates extravasation of leukocytes in inflammatory diseases as well as in routine homing of lymphocytes, and it is regulated by expression levels of selectins and their carbohydrate ligand, sialyl Lewis X. Most resting peripheral T lymphocytes lack sialyl Lewis X expression but are induced to strongly express it upon activation. The induction of sialyl Lewis X depends on transcriptional activation of fucosyltransferase VII gene ( FUT7 ), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl Lewis X synthesis ( 8 , 10 â€“ 15 ). Th1 cells are known to more preferentially express sialyl Lewis X as compared with Th2 cells upon activation ( 9 ). The molecular basis for this expression, however, has not been elucidated to date. Here we showed that FUT7 is unique in having binding sites in its promoter region for both GATA-3 and T-bet, two opposing factors for Th1 and Th2 development ( 31 , 32 ), and is transcriptionally regulated by a balance of the interacting two transcription factors. GATA-3 represses FUT7 transcription through phosphorylation-dependent interaction with HDAC-3 and HDAC-5, whereas T-bet promotes its transcription through recruiting CBP/P-300. These factors form a transcription factor complex on FUT7 promoter, and the GATA-3/HDAC-3, GATA-3/HDAC-5, T-bet/CBP/P300, and T-bet/Sp1 interactions described here, as well as recently described T-bet/GATA-3 interaction ( 24 ), dynamically regulate composition of the transcriptional complex on the FUT7 promoter. T-bet interferes with binding of GATA-3, which in turn interferes with binding of T-bet to the FUT7 promoter as evidenced by ChIP assays. Suppression of GATA-3 activity by dominant-negative GATA-3 or ROG, in addition to T-bet, was necessary to attain full activation of FUT7 transcription and maximum sialyl Lewis X expression in human T lymphoid cells. Regulation of FUT7 transcription by GATA-3/T-bet interaction well explains the lineage-specific expression of sialyl Lewis X among lymphocyte subsets.

These findings indicate that not only T-bet but also GATA-3 figures heavily in regulating FUT7 transcription, and that a balance of the two interacting transcription factors, GATA-3 and T-bet, regulates FUT7 transcription, which well explains Th1-dominant expression of sialyl Lewis X ( 9 ) among T lymphocytes (Fig. 9, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Another subset of lymphocytes that significantly express sialyl Lewis X is NK cells, and T-bet is known to be active in NK cells ( 33 , 34 ). We propose that transcriptional regulation of FUT7 plays important roles in lineage-specific expression of selectin ligands among lymphocyte subpopulations.

Proteins and nucleic acids generally are believed to be indispensable functional molecules, but the role of glycoconjugates as the third type of biofunctional molecules has long remained obscure. Most genes for cell-surface carbohydrate synthesis have been regarded as housekeeping genes, and dynamic and multifarious regulation at their transcription levels has not been expected. Here we show that a gene for glycosyltransferase responsible for synthesis of a carbohydrate lymphocyte homing receptor is elegantly and exquisitely regulated by a complex of intriguing transcription factors, including T-bet and GATA-3, to attain cell lineage-specific expression in lymphocyte subsets such as Th1 and Th2 cells. This is an outstanding example of the most sophisticatedly regulated glycogenes, and the expression of cell-surface glycoconjugates coordinated with other cell lineage-specific proteins may usher in an altogether new concept in functional glycomics.
