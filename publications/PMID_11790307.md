The evolutionarily conserved Hus1 proteins function in DNA damage response 
pathways that serve to maintain genomic stability. Cells lacking mouse Hus1 are 
hypersensitive to certain genotoxins, and we have explored the molecular basis 
for this defect by examining how Hus1 inactivation affects genotoxin-induced 
signaling events. p53 accumulation and activation in response to DNA damage 
appeared normal in Hus1 null cells. Likewise, Hus1 was dispensable for 
genotoxin-induced Chk2 phosphorylation. In contrast, Chk1 phosphorylation after 
genotoxic stress was greatly reduced in the absence of Hus1, but was restored in 
Hus1 null fibroblasts complemented by infection with a Hus1-expressing 
retrovirus. These results demonstrate that mouse Hus1 is required for a specific 
subset of DNA damage signaling events and functions to promote genotoxin-induced 
Chk1 phosphorylation.
