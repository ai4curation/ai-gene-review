Endothelin (ET) 1 is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced by vascular 
endothelial cells and implicated in various pathophysiologic states involving 
abnormal vascular tone. Homozygous ET-1 null mice have craniofacial and cardiac 
malformations that lead to neonatal death. To study the role of ET-1 in adult 
vascular physiology, we generated a mouse strain (ET-1(flox/flox);Tie2-Cre mice) 
in which ET-1 is disrupted specifically in endothelial cells. ET-1 peptide 
levels in plasma, heart, lung, kidney, and brain homogenates were reduced by 65% 
to 80% in these mice. mRNA levels for ET receptors were unaltered except that 
the ET(A) receptor mRNA was upregulated in the heart. ET-1(flox/flox);Tie2-Cre 
mice had mean blood pressures 10 to 12 mm Hg lower than genetic controls. In 
contrast, the blood pressure of mice systemically heterozygous for the ET-1 null 
allele (ET-1(dlox/+) mice) was unchanged compared with wild-type littermates. 
Despite the lower basal blood pressure, acute pharmacological responses to 
angiotensin II, captopril, phenylephrine, bradykinin, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine 
methyl ester, and exogenous ET-1 were normal in ET-1(flox/flox);Tie2-Cre mice. 
These results support an essential role of endothelial-derived ET-1 in the 
maintenance of basal vascular tone and blood pressure. Normal pharmacological 
responses of ET-1(flox/flox);Tie2-Cre mice suggest that the renin-angiotensin 
system, the adrenergic system, and NO are not significantly altered by 
endothelial ET-1. Taken in conjunction with other lines of genetically altered 
mice, our results provide evidence for a paracrine vasoregulatory pathway 
mediated by endothelial cell-derived ET-1 acting on the vascular smooth muscle 
ET(A) receptor.
