Cell cycle withdrawal limits proliferation of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes. 
Therefore, the concept of stimulating myocyte mitotic divisions has dramatic 
implications for cardiomyocyte regeneration and hence, cardiovascular disease. 
Previous reports describing manipulation of cell cycle proteins have not shown 
induction of cardiomyocyte mitosis after birth. We now report that cyclin A2, 
normally silenced in the postnatal heart, induces cardiac enlargement because of 
cardiomyocyte hyperplasia when constitutively expressed from embryonic day 8 
into adulthood. Cardiomyocyte hyperplasia during adulthood was coupled with an 
increase in cardiomyocyte mitosis, noted in transgenic hearts at all time points 
examined, particularly during postnatal development. Several stages of mitosis 
were observed within cardiomyocytes and correlated with the nuclear localization 
of cyclin A2. Magnetic resonance analysis confirmed cardiac enlargement. These 
results reveal a previously unrecognized critical role for cyclin A2 in 
mediating cardiomyocyte mitosis, a role that may significantly impact upon 
clinical treatment of damaged myocardium.
