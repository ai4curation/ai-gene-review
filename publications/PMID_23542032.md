The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) operates in adaptive responses to various 
stresses, dictating cell fate. Here we show that knockdown of the ER protein 
mitsugumin23 (MG23) enhances cell death induced by ultraviolet C (UVC), which 
causes DNA damage. The small heat shock protein αB-crystallin (αBC) is 
identified as a MG23 binding molecule and its knockdown facilitates death of 
UVC-exposed cells. Conversely, αBC lowered UVC sensitivity when expressed as an 
ER-anchored form. Taken together, the results suggest that MG23 plays a 
protective role against UVC by accumulating αBC in the close vicinity of the ER.
