The proteasome, the major protein-degradation machine in cells, regulates 
neuronal synapses and long-term information storage. Here, using 
super-resolution microscopy, we found that the two essential subcomplexes of the 
proteasome, the regulatory (19S) and catalytic (20S) particles, are 
differentially distributed within individual rat cortical neurons. We discovered 
an unexpected abundance of free 19S particles near synapses. The free neuronal 
19S particles bind and deubiquitylate lysine 63-ubiquitin (Lys63-ub), a 
non-proteasome-targeting ubiquitin linkage. Pull-down assays revealed a 
significant overrepresentation of synaptic molecules as Lys63-ub interactors. 
Inhibition of the 19S deubiquitylase activity significantly altered excitatory 
synaptic transmission and reduced the synaptic availability of AMPA receptors at 
multiple trafficking points in a proteasome-independent manner. Together, these 
results reveal a moonlighting function of the regulatory proteasomal subcomplex 
near synapses.
