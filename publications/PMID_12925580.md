Mice lacking the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) develop epithelial 
defects and a neurodegenerative disease and die within the first month of birth. 
By employing a conditional knock-in approach using the human EGFR cDNA mice 
humanised for EGFR (hEGFRKI/KI) were generated. Homozygous hEGFRKI/KI mice are 
viable and live up to six months. However, these mice are growth retarded and 
show skin and hair defects similar to Egfr-/- mutants. Interestingly, the 
neurodegeneration is fully rescued in hEGFRKI/KI mice, however, they develop a 
severe heart hypertrophy with semilunar valve abnormalities. Moreover, 
hEGFRKI/KI mice display accelerated chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation, 
a phenotype that is also present in Egfr-/- mice and has not been previously 
described. The severity of the phenotypes correlates with the expression levels 
of the hEGFRKI allele, which is not efficiently expressed in epithelial and bone 
cells, but is expressed at similar and even higher levels as the endogenous Egfr 
in brain and heart. These results demonstrate that mice humanised for EGFR 
display tissue-specific hypomorphic phenotypes and describe a novel function for 
EGFR in bone development.
