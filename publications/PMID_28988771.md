Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates many crucial cellular 
programs, with seven different activating ligands shaping cell signaling in 
distinct ways. Using crystallography and other approaches, we show how the EGFR 
ligands epiregulin (EREG) and epigen (EPGN) stabilize different dimeric 
conformations of the EGFR extracellular region. As a consequence, EREG or EPGN 
induce less stable EGFR dimers than EGF-making them partial agonists of EGFR 
dimerization. Unexpectedly, this weakened dimerization elicits more sustained 
EGFR signaling than seen with EGF, provoking responses in breast cancer cells 
associated with differentiation rather than proliferation. Our results reveal 
how responses to different EGFR ligands are defined by receptor dimerization 
strength and signaling dynamics. These findings have broad implications for 
understanding receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling specificity. Our results 
also suggest parallels between partial and/or biased agonism in RTKs and 
G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as new therapeutic opportunities for 
correcting RTK signaling output.

Introduction

Structural understanding of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation has
advanced greatly in recent years ( Lemmon and
Schlessinger, 2010 ), with the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR/ErbB1) being among the most intensely studied ( Kovacs et al., 2015 ). A primary focus has been to understand how ligand
binding drives RTKs from their inactive to active forms, assuming that a single
ligand-induced dimeric species represents the active state. Although this assumption
may be reasonable for RTKs with only one activating ligand, it breaks down when
trying to explain how EGFR family RTKs signal differently in response to their
multiple cognate ligands ( Sweeney and Carraway,
2000 ; Wilson et al., 2009 ).

EGFR is activated by seven different growth factors ( Harris et al., 2003 ), which fall into two groups based on
receptor-binding affinity. The high-affinity ligands are EGF, transforming growth
factor-α (TGFα), betacellulin (BTC), and heparin binding EGF-like
growth factor (HB-EGF), which bind cell surface EGFR with apparent K d s of 0.1-1 nM. The low-affinity ligands are
epiregulin (EREG), epigen (EPGN), and amphiregulin (AREG), which bind 10-100 fold
more weakly. Numerous studies report distinct EGFR-dependent cellular responses to
the different ligands ( Wilson et al., 2009 ),
with a given cell line responding differently to individual EGFR ligands in terms of
cell proliferation ( Wilson et al., 2012 ),
differentiation ( Kochupurakkal et al., 2005 ; Rizzi et al., 2013 ), and/or motility
( Willmarth and Ethier, 2006 ). Individual
EGFR ligands also induce qualitatively and quantitatively different downstream
signals ( Knudsen et al., 2014 ; Ronan et al., 2016 ; Wilson et al., 2012 ), and are linked to unique phenotypes in vivo ( Wilson et al.,
2009 ).

It remains unclear from current mechanistic understanding how different
ligands could promote distinct cellular signaling responses through the same RTK.
Crystal structures have described how EGF or TGFα induce formation of
activated EGFR dimers ( Ferguson et al., 2003 ; Garrett et al., 2002 ; Kovacs et al., 2015 ; Ogiso et al., 2002 ). Our more recent work ( Bessman et al., 2014 ), however, has argued that
relationships between extracellular ligand binding and receptor dimerization are
more complex than suggested by these models – allowing the possibility that
different EGFR ligands induce distinct dimers ( Wilson et al., 2009 ). Here, we describe crystallographic and cellular
studies that reveal how two EGFR ligands, epiregulin and epigen, do indeed drive the
EGFR extracellular region into dimers with different structures. We show that the
resulting ligand-induced dimers are weaker and more short-lived than those induced
by EGF, altering signaling kinetics in a way that profoundly influences cellular
outcome. Our findings suggest unexpected parallels with the biased agonism observed
for some G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands ( Lane et al., 2017 ; Wacker et al.,
2017 ), and further suggest that kinetic proofreading might play an
important role in controlling ligand discrimination and RTK signaling specificity
( Swain and Siggia, 2002 ).

Conclusions

Our studies reveal that EGFR dimers induced by epiregulin and epigen differ
structurally from those induced by EGF or TGFα. If the observed
conformational differences could be communicated to the intracellular region of the
receptor as suggested ( Doerner et al., 2015 ),
this might contribute to biased agonism. In addition (or instead), however, our
results suggest that altered structural dynamics of the activated receptor dimer
help define signaling specificity. This possibility was recently explored for GPCRs
( Manglik et al., 2015 ; Nygaard et al., 2013 ), and our results argue that the
time evolution of receptor activation (rather than receptor structure per se) may
likewise be one of the key parameters altered when EGFR is stimulated with
epiregulin or epigen rather than EGF. The conformational ensemble explored by the
activated receptor might be different for each ligand, which could in turn alter the
way in which (and for how long) the receptor couples to downstream effectors, as
recently suggested for biased agonism of GPCRs ( Furness et al., 2016 ; Klein Herenbrink
et al., 2016 ; Lane et al., 2017 ; Wacker et al., 2017 ).

In terms of EGFR signaling, it seems paradoxical at first thought that
reduced EGFR dimer strength and lifetime seen with epiregulin and epigen causes more
sustained (rather than more transient) activation of EGFR – leading to
sustained Erk activation and induction of MCF-7 cell differentiation rather than
proliferation. Thus, partial agonism at the level of receptor dimerization (but not
receptor phosphorylation) is manifest as apparent biased agonism with respect to
cell fate. How might more sustained EGFR autophosphosphorylation (and Erk
activation) arise from weaker, shorter-lived, EGFR dimers? One possibility is a form
of kinetic proofreading ( McKeithan, 1995 ), as
has been discussed extensively for T cell receptor signaling. RTKs such as EGFR
require multiple phosphorylation events for complete activation and, as pointed out
previously ( Swain and Siggia, 2002 ), it is
easy to see how short-lived dimers might not reach the end of a progressive
multi-site phosphorylation ‘program’ – and might thus fail
to elicit all possible signals. If the short-lived EGFR dimers induced by epiregulin
or epigen do not complete the full complement of phosphorylation events and
therefore fail to engage a key (late) negative feedback signal, this would result in
loss of the transient nature of the signal seen with EGF ( Lemmon et al., 2016 ). Loss of such a negative feedback
event would promote the more sustained signaling seen in our steady state
studies.

Putative negative feedback(s) normally responsible for the transient nature
of EGF-induced EGFR activation, but lost or impaired with epiregulin and epigen,
might include receptor internalization and receptor dephosphorylation. All EGFR
agonists induce receptor internalization, but alterations in receptor
ubiquitinylation, recycling, or degradation of endocytosed receptors may be
important. Indeed, differences in all of these activities have been reported across
EGFR ligands ( Francavilla et al., 2016 ; Roepstorff et al., 2009 ). The issue is not
simply one of receptor recycling versus degradation, however; EGFR activated by
either TGFα or epiregulin is internalized and recycled ( Roepstorff et al., 2009 ), yet TGFα resembles EGF
rather than epiregulin in its signaling kinetics ( Figure 7C ). Reduced recruitment of one or more tyrosine phosphatases
following receptor activation by epiregulin or epigen is another important
possibility. Indeed, depleting PTP1B by siRNA, for example, has been shown to cause
normally transient EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation to become sustained ( Eden et al., 2010 ). Along similar lines,
feedback that modulates the ability of adaptor molecules such as Shc to protect
phosphotyrosines in EGFR from dephosphorylation could determine the extent to which
signals are transient or sustained ( Kholodenko et
al., 1999 ).

Other recent studies have also described functional selectivity or biased
signaling through receptors with a single TM domain. In one example, biased
signaling by c-Kit was achieved by engineered stem cell factor variants with altered
dimerization ( Ho et al., 2017 ). In another
case, erythropoietin (EPO) harboring a pathogenic mutation was found to signal
aberrantly because of altered binding kinetics rather than strength ( Kim et al., 2017 ). Our results show how biased agonism or
functional selectivity can occur with EGFR and its natural human ligands. We explain
the structural basis of this, but our findings argue that it is not the structure of
the receptor dimer itself that alters the signaling outcome. Instead, the strength
and lifetime of the activated receptor dimer – which result from the
structural alterations – appear to play an important role. This has
important implications for understanding how different RTKs (and other receptors)
can be harnessed to promote diverse signaling outcomes, and for considering how to
modulate them therapeutically. For example, our results suggest the possibility of
using well-defined biologics to modulate or bias aberrant EGFR signaling rather than
simply blocking activity.
