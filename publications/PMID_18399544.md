Cryptochrome (CRY) is intimately associated with the circadian clock of many 
organisms. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, CRY seems to be involved in 
photoreception as well as in the core clockwork. In spite of the critical role 
of CRY for the clock of Drosophila, it was not quite clear whether CRY is 
expressed in every clock cell. With the help of a new antibody and a mutant that 
lacks CRY, we show here that CRY is expressed in specific subsets of 
Drosophila's pacemaker neurons and in the photoreceptor cells of the compound 
eyes. In the pacemaker neurons, CRY levels and kinetics under light-dark cycles 
are quite different from each other. High-amplitude oscillations are observed in 
only three groups of clock neurons, suggesting that these three groups are 
strongly receptive to light. The different CRY kinetics may account for phase 
differences in oscillations of the clock proteins observed in these three groups 
in earlier studies. The molecular clock of the neurons that contain lower CRY 
levels or are completely CRY negative can still be synchronized by light, 
probably via intercellular communication with the CRY-positive neurons as well 
as via external photoreceptors.
