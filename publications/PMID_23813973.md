LRRK2 G2019S mutation is the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease 
(PD). Cellular pathology caused by this mutant is associated with mitochondrial 
dysfunction and augmented autophagy. However, the underlying mechanism is not 
known. In this study, we determined whether blocking excessive mitochondrial 
fission could reduce cellular damage and neurodegeneration induced by the G2019S 
mutation. In both LRRK2 G2019S-expressing cells and PD patient fibroblasts 
carrying this specific mutant, treatment with P110, a selective peptide 
inhibitor of fission dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) recently developed in our 
lab, reduced mitochondrial fragmentation and damage, and corrected excessive 
autophagy. LRRK2 G2019S directly bound to and phosphorylated Drp1 at 
Threonine595, whereas P110 treatment abolished this phosphorylation. A 
site-directed mutant, Drp1(T595A), corrected mitochondrial fragmentation, 
improved mitochondrial mass and suppressed excessive autophagy in both cells 
expressing LRRK2 G2019S and PD patient fibroblasts carrying the mutant. Further, 
in dopaminergic neurons derived from LRRK2 G2019S PD patient-induced pluripotent 
stem cells, we demonstrated that either P110 treatment or expression of 
Drp1(T595A) reduced mitochondrial impairment, lysosomal hyperactivity and 
neurite shortening. Together, we propose that inhibition of Drp1-mediated 
excessive mitochondrial fission might be a strategy for treatment of PD relevant 
to LRRK2 G2019S mutation.
