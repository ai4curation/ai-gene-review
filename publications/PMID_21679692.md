Recent evidence points to a multifunctional role of ZO-2, the tight junction 
protein of the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like) family. Though 
ZO-2 has been found in cell types lacking tight junction structures, such as 
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), little is known about ZO-2 function in 
these cells. We provide evidence that ZO-2 mediates specific homotypic 
cell-to-cell contacts between VSMC. Using mass spectrometry we found that ZO-2 
is associated with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Jak1. By generating specific 
ZO-2 constructs we further found that the N-terminal fragment of ZO-2 molecule 
is responsible for this interaction. Adenovirus-based expression of Jak1 
inactive mutant demonstrated that Jak1 mediates ZO-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. 
By means of RNA silencing, expression of Jak1 mutant form and fluorescently 
labeled ZO-2 fusion protein we further specified that active Jak1, but not Jak1 
inactive mutant, mediates ZO-2 localization to the sites of intercellular 
contacts. We identified the urokinase receptor uPAR as a pre-requisite for these 
cellular events. Functional requirement of the revealed signaling complex for 
VSMC network formation was confirmed in experiments using Matrigel and in 
contraction assay. Our findings imply involvement of the ZO-2 tight junction 
independent signaling complex containing Jak1 and uPAR in VSMC intercellular 
communications. This mechanism may contribute to vascular remodeling in 
occlusive cardiovascular diseases and in arteriogenesis.
