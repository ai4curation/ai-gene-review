Mitochondria maintain tight regulation of inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) 
permeability to sustain ATP production. Stressful events cause cellular calcium 
(Ca(2+)) dysregulation followed by rapid loss of IMM potential known as 
permeability transition (PT), which produces osmotic shifts, metabolic 
dysfunction, and cell death. The molecular identity of the mitochondrial PT pore 
(mPTP) was previously unknown. We show that the purified reconstituted c-subunit 
ring of the FO of the F1FO ATP synthase forms a voltage-sensitive channel, the 
persistent opening of which leads to rapid and uncontrolled depolarization of 
the IMM in cells. Prolonged high matrix Ca(2+) enlarges the c-subunit ring and 
unhooks it from cyclophilin D/cyclosporine A binding sites in the ATP synthase 
F1, providing a mechanism for mPTP opening. In contrast, recombinant F1 
beta-subunit applied exogenously to the purified c-subunit enhances the 
probability of pore closure. Depletion of the c-subunit attenuates 
Ca(2+)-induced IMM depolarization and inhibits Ca(2+) and reactive oxygen 
species-induced cell death whereas increasing the expression or single-channel 
conductance of the c-subunit sensitizes to death. We conclude that a highly 
regulated c-subunit leak channel is a candidate for the mPTP. Beyond cell death, 
these findings also imply that increasing the probability of c-subunit channel 
closure in a healthy cell will enhance IMM coupling and increase cellular 
metabolic efficiency.
