Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune thrombophilia characterized by 
arterial/venous thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity in the presence of 
antiphospholipid antibodies that mainly recognize beta2 glycoprotein I 
(beta2GPI). To investigate potential platelet ligands of beta2GPI, platelet 
membrane proteins from healthy persons and patients with APS were passed through 
a beta2GPI-affinity column. By using mass spectrometry, platelet factor 4 (PF4) 
appeared as the dominant beta2GPI binding protein. PF4 could bind in vitro, with 
high-affinity, recombinant beta2GPI, and the binding was abrogated by soluble 
beta2GPI. Coprecipitation experiments further confirmed this interaction. In 
silico molecular docking showed that PF4 tetramers can bind 2 beta2GPI molecules 
simultaneously. Size exclusion chromatography confirmed that anti-beta2GPI 
antibodies selectively interact with complexes composed of 
(beta2GPI)(2)-(PF4)(4). In addition, as shown by the beta2GPI antigenicity 
evaluation, the reactivity of APS sera was higher against PF4-beta2GPI complex 
than against beta2GPI alone. On complex formation, anti-beta2GPI-beta2GPI-PF4 
significantly induced platelet p38MAPK phosphorylation and TXB2 production, 
mainly through F(ab')(2) fragments of antibodies. In summary, this study makes 
evident that beta2GPI forms stable complexes with PF4, leading to the 
stabilization of beta2GPI dimeric structure that facilitates the antibody 
recognition. This interaction can probably be involved in the procoagulant 
tendency of APS.
