Apert syndrome, acrocephalosyndactyly Type I, is an autosomal dominant 
craniosynostosis comprising acrocephaly, facial dysmorphism and severe 
syndactyly of the hands and feet. Missense mutations at codons 252 and 253 at 
5'-end on exon 7 of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 have been 
identified in a large number of patients with Apert syndrome. In this study, 
nucleotide sequences on the intron 6 were determined by vector ligation-PCR and 
direct sequencing. Five DNA samples from sporadic Apert syndrome were examined 
by non-RI SSCP and direct sequencing using a primer pair of intron 6 and exon 7. 
All cases of the syndrome showed abnormal banding pattern in the SSCP and 
missense mutations from Ser to Trp at codon 252 of the FGFR2 gene. The non-RI 
SSCP and direct sequencing of the FGFR2 exon 7 from genomic DNAs may be a useful 
and rapid molecular means for clinical diagnosis of Apert syndrome.
