Hamartomatous brain lesions are a hallmark of brain pathology of tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC). To elucidate the mechanism of tumor development in the 
brain of TSC, we identified NADE (p75NTR-associated cell death executor) as an 
interactor for TSC1 gene product hamartin using a yeast two-hybrid system. In a 
pull-down assay, endogenous NADE was purified with the immobilized coiled-coil 
domain (CCD) of hamartin from the PC12h cell lysate. Immunofluorescence and 
immunoprecipitation confirmed the interaction of hamartin and NADE in cultured 
neurons and mouse brain lysate. Hamartin constitutively associated with NADE to 
prevent its proteasomal degradation. Suppression of hamartin with TSC1 small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) caused reduction of NADE and failed to lead to 
NGF-induced apoptosis in PC12h cells. These results indicate that hamartin binds 
to NADE to regulate neuronal cell function and loss of this association is 
likely to contribute to the brain pathology in TSC.
