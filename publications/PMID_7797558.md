The gene encoding the urea transporter of human erythrocytes (HUT11 clone) has 
been cloned recently (Olives, B., Neau, P., Bailly, P., Hediger, M. A., 
Rousselet, G., Cartron, J. P., and Ripoche, P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 
31649-31652). Now, this gene has been assigned to chromosome 18q12-q21 by in 
situ hybridization, as also found for the Kidd (Jk) blood group locus. In 
coupled transcription-translation assays, the HUT11 cDNA directed the synthesis 
of a 36-kDa protein which was immunoprecipitated by a human anti-Jk3 antibody 
produced by immunized Jk(a-b-) donors whose red cells lack Kidd antigens. The 
anti-Jk3 antibody also immunoprecipitated a protein material of 46-60 kDa from 
all red cell membranes, except those from Jk(a-b-) cells. After N-glycanase 
digestion the 46-60-kDa component was reduced to 36 kDa. A rabbit antibody 
raised against the predicted NH2-terminal amino-acids of the HUT11 protein 
reacted on immunoblots with a 46-60-kDa component present in all human 
erythrocytes except those from Jk(a-b-) individuals. Jk(a-b-) red cells lack the 
Kidd/urea transport protein and have a selective defect of the urea transport 
capacity, but a normal water permeability and aquaporin-associated Colton blood 
group antigens. These findings indicate that the erythrocyte urea transporter is 
encoded by the Kidd locus and may have implications for the biology of urea 
transporters and their tissue-specific regulation.
