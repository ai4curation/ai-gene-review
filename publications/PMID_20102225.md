Basic-region leucine-zipper transcription factors (bZIPs) contain a segment rich 
in basic amino acids that can bind DNA, followed by a leucine zipper that can 
interact with other leucine zippers to form coiled-coil homo- or heterodimers. 
Several viruses encode proteins containing bZIP domains, including four that 
encode bZIPs lacking significant homology to any human protein. We investigated 
the interaction specificity of these four viral bZIPs by using coiled-coil 
arrays to assess self-associations as well as heterointeractions with 33 
representative human bZIPs. The arrays recapitulated reported viral-human 
interactions and also uncovered new associations. MEQ and HBZ interacted with 
multiple human partners and had unique interaction profiles compared to any 
human bZIPs, whereas K-bZIP and BZLF1 displayed homospecificity. New 
interactions detected included HBZ with MAFB, MAFG, ATF2, CEBPG, and CREBZF and 
MEQ with NFIL3. These were confirmed in solution using circular dichroism. HBZ 
can heteroassociate with MAFB and MAFG in the presence of MARE-site DNA, and 
this interaction is dependent on the basic region of HBZ. NFIL3 and MEQ have 
different yet overlapping DNA-binding specificities and can form a heterocomplex 
with DNA. Computational design considering both affinity for MEQ and specificity 
with respect to other undesired bZIP-type interactions was used to generate a 
MEQ dimerization inhibitor. This peptide, anti-MEQ, bound MEQ both stably and 
specifically, as assayed using coiled-coil arrays and circular dichroism in 
solution. Anti-MEQ also inhibited MEQ binding to DNA. These studies can guide 
further investigation of the function of viral and human bZIP complexes.
