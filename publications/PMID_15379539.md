HMGB1 (high mobility group B1) is a conserved chromosomal protein composed of 
two similar DNA binding domains (HMG box A and box B) linked by a short basic 
stretch to an acidic C-terminal tail of 30 residues. The acidic tail modulates 
the DNA binding properties of HMGB1, and its length differentiates the various 
HMGB family members. We synthesized a peptide that corresponds to the acidic 
tail in HMGB1 (T-peptide) and studied its binding to the single boxes and to the 
fragment corresponding to tailless HMGB1 (designated as AB(bt) fragment). CD 
spectroscopy showed that T-peptide stabilizes significantly the AB(bt) fragment 
and that the complex has an identical thermal stability as full-length HMGB1. 
Calorimetric and NMR data showed that T-peptide binds with a dissociation 
constant of 9 microM to box A and much more weakly to box B. (1)H-(15)N HSQC 
spectra of full-length HMGB1 and of the AB(bt) fragment are very similar; the 
small chemical shift differences that exist correspond to those residues of the 
AB(bt) fragment that were affected by the addition of the T-peptide. We conclude 
that the T-peptide mimics closely the acidic tail and that the basic stretch and 
the acidic tail form an extended and flexible segment. The tail interacts with 
specific residues in the boxes and shields them from other interactions.
