OBJECTIVE: The WFS1 gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-embedded 
protein. Homozygous WFS1 gene mutations cause Wolfram syndrome, characterized by 
insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus and optic atropy. Pancreatic beta-cells are 
selectively lost from the patient's islets. ER localization suggests that WFS1 
protein has physiological functions in membrane trafficking, secretion, 
processing and/or regulation of ER calcium homeostasis. Disturbances or 
overloading of these functions induces ER stress responses, including apoptosis. 
We speculated that WFS1 protein might be involved in these ER stress responses.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Islet expression of the Wfs1 protein was analyzed 
immunohistochemically. Induction of Wfs1 upon ER stress was examined by Northern 
and Western blot analyses using three different models: human skin fibroblasts, 
mouse pancreatic beta-cell-derived MIN6 cells, and Akita mouse-derived Ins2 
(96Y/Y) insulinoma cells. The human WFS1 gene promoter-luciferase reporter 
analysis was also conducted.
RESULT: Islet beta-cells were the major site of Wfs1 expression. This expression 
was also found in delta-cells, but not in alpha-cells. WFS1 expression was 
transcriptionally up-regulated by ER stress-inducing chemical insults. Treatment 
of fibroblasts and MIN6 cells with thapsigargin or tunicamycin increased WFS1 
mRNA. WFS1 protein also increased in response to thapsigargin treatment in these 
cells. WFS1 gene expression was also increased in Ins2 (96Y/Y) insulinoma cells. 
In these cells, ER stress was intrinsically induced by mutant insulin 
expression. The WFS1 gene promoter-luciferase reporter system revealed that the 
human WFS1 promoter was activated by chemically induced ER stress in MIN6 cells, 
and that the promoter was more active in Ins2 (96Y/Y) cells than Ins2 
(wild/wild) cells.
CONCLUSION: Wfs1 expression, which is localized to beta- and delta-cells in 
pancreatic islets, increases in response to ER stress, suggesting a functional 
link between Wfs1 and ER stress.
