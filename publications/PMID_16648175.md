AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in modulating cellular 
metabolic processes. AMPK, a serine-threonine kinase, is a heterotrimeric 
complex of catalytic alpha-subunits and regulatory beta- and gamma-subunits with 
multiple isoforms. Mutations in the cardiac gamma(2)-isoform have been 
associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and pre-excitation syndromes. 
However, physiological regulation of AMPK complexes containing different subunit 
isoforms is not well defined and is important for an understanding of the 
function of this signaling pathway in the intact heart. We evaluated the kinase 
activity associated with heart AMPK complexes containing specific alpha- and 
gamma-subunit isoforms of AMPK in an in vivo rat model of regional ischemia. 
Left coronary artery occlusion activated the immunoprecipitated alpha(1)-isoform 
(6-fold, P < 0.01) and alpha(2)-isoform (9-fold, P < 0.01) in the ischemic left 
ventricle compared with sham controls. The degree of alpha-subunit activation 
depended on the extent of ischemia and paralleled echocardiographic contractile 
dysfunction. The regulatory gamma(1)- and gamma(2)-isoforms were expressed in 
the heart. The gamma(1)- and gamma(2)-isoforms coimmunoprecipitated with 
alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-isoforms in proportion to alpha-subunit content. 
gamma(1)-Isoform immunocomplexes accounted for 70% of AMPK activity and AMPK 
phosphorylation (Thr(172)) in hearts. Ischemia similarly increased AMPK activity 
associated with the gamma(1)- and gamma(2)-isoform complexes threefold (P < 0.01 
for each). Thus AMPK catalytic alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-isoforms are activated by 
regional ischemia in vivo in the heart, irrespective of the regulatory gamma(1)- 
or gamma(2)-isoforms to which they are complexed. Despite the pathophysiological 
importance of gamma(2)-isoform mutations, gamma(1)-isoform complexes account for 
most of the AMPK activity in the ischemic heart.
