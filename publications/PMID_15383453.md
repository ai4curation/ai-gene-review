Signal-regulatory proteins (SIRPs) are transmembrane glycoproteins belonging to 
the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that are expressed in the immune and central 
nervous systems. SIRPalpha binds CD47 and inhibits the function of macrophages, 
dendritic cells, and granulocytes, whereas SIRPbeta1 is an orphan receptor that 
activates the same cell types. A recently identified third member of the SIRP 
family, SIRPbeta2, is as yet uncharacterized in terms of expression, 
specificity, and function. Here, we show that SIRPbeta2 is expressed on T cells 
and activated natural killer (NK) cells and, like SIRPalpha, binds CD47, 
mediating cell-cell adhesion. Consequently, engagement of SIRPbeta2 on T cells 
by CD47 on antigen-presenting cells results in enhanced antigen-specific T-cell 
proliferation.
