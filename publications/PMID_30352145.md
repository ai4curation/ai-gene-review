Lanmodulin (LanM) is a high-affinity lanthanide (Ln)-binding protein recently 
identified in Methylobacterium extorquens, a bacterium that requires Lns for the 
function of at least two enzymes. LanM possesses four EF-hands, metal 
coordination motifs generally associated with CaII binding, but it undergoes a 
metal-dependent conformational change with a 100 million-fold selectivity for 
LnIIIs and YIII over CaII. Here we present the nuclear magnetic resonance 
solution structure of LanM complexed with YIII. This structure reveals that LanM 
features an unusual fusion of adjacent EF-hands, resulting in a compact fold to 
the best of our knowledge unique among EF-hand-containing proteins. It also 
supports the importance of an additional carboxylate ligand in contributing to 
the protein's picomolar affinity for LnIIIs, and it suggests a role of unusual N 
i+1-H···N i hydrogen bonds, in which LanM's unique EF-hand proline residues are 
engaged, in selective LnIII recognition. This work sets the stage for a detailed 
mechanistic understanding of LanM's Ln selectivity, which may inspire new 
strategies for binding, detecting, and sequestering these technologically 
important metals.
