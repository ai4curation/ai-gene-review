The dual specificity phosphatase CDC25B positively controls the G2-M transition 
by activating CDK1/cyclin B. The binding of 14-3-3 to CDC25B has been shown to 
regulate the subcellular redistribution of CDC25B from the nucleus to the 
cytoplasm and may be correlated with the G2 checkpoint. We used a FLAG-tagged 
version of CDC25B to study the differences among the binding sites for the 
14-3-3 subtypes, 14-3-3beta, 14-3-3epsilon and 14-3-3sigma, and the relationship 
between subtype binding and the subcellular localization of CDC25B. All three 
subtypes were found to bind to CDC25B. Site-directed mutagenesis studies 
revealed that 14-3-3beta bound exclusively near serine-309 of CDC25B1, which is 
within a potential consensus motif for 14-3-3 binding. By contrast, 14-3-3sigma 
bound preferentially to a site around serine-216, and the presence of serine-137 
and -309 enhanced the binding. In addition to these binding-site differences, we 
found that the binding of 14-3-3beta drove CDC25B to the cytoplasm and that 
mutation of serine-309 to alanine completely abolished the cytoplasmic 
localization of CDC25B. However, co-expression of 14-3-3sigma and CDC25B did not 
affect the subcellular localization of CDC25B. Furthermore, serine-309 of CDC25B 
was sufficient to produce its cytoplasmic distribution with co-expression of 
14-3-3beta, even when other putative 14-3-3 binding sites were mutated. 
14-3-3epsilon resembled 14-3-3beta with regard to its binding to CDC25B and the 
control of CDC25B subcellular localization. The results of the present study 
indicate that two 14-3-3 subtypes can control the subcellular localization of 
CDC25B by binding to a specific site and that 14-3-3sigma has effects on CDC25B 
other than the control of its subcellular localization.
