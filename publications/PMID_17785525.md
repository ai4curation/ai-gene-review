A cellular defense mechanism counteracts the deleterious effects of misfolded 
protein accumulation by eliciting a stress response. The cytoplasmic deacetylase 
HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) was previously shown to be a key element in this 
response by coordinating the clearance of protein aggregates through aggresome 
formation and their autophagic degradation. Here, for the first time, we 
demonstrate that HDAC6 is involved in another crucial cell response to the 
accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, and unravel its molecular 
basis. Indeed, our data show that HDAC6 senses ubiquitinated cellular aggregates 
and consequently induces the expression of major cellular chaperones by 
triggering the dissociation of a repressive HDAC6/HSF1 (heat-shock factor 
1)/HSP90 (heat-shock protein 90) complex and a subsequent HSF1 activation. HDAC6 
therefore appears as a master regulator of the cell protective response to 
cytotoxic protein aggregate formation.
