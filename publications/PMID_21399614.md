Centrosomes in animal cells are dynamic organelles with a proteinaceous matrix 
of pericentriolar material assembled around a pair of centrioles. They organize 
the microtubule cytoskeleton and the mitotic spindle apparatus. Mature 
centrioles are essential for biogenesis of primary cilia that mediate key 
signalling events. Despite recent advances, the molecular basis for the plethora 
of processes coordinated by centrosomes is not fully understood. We have 
combined protein identification and localization, using PCP-SILAC mass 
spectrometry, BAC transgeneOmics, and antibodies to define the constituents of 
human centrosomes. From a background of non-specific proteins, we distinguished 
126 known and 40 candidate centrosomal proteins, of which 22 were confirmed as 
novel components. An antibody screen covering 4000 genes revealed an additional 
113 candidates. We illustrate the power of our methods by identifying a novel 
set of five proteins preferentially associated with mother or daughter 
centrioles, comprising genes implicated in cell polarity. Pulsed labelling 
demonstrates a remarkable variation in the stability of centrosomal protein 
complexes. These spatiotemporal proteomics data provide leads to the further 
functional characterization of centrosomal proteins.
