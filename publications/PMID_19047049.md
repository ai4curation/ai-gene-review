In this study we have investigated hyaluronan (HA)-mediated CD44 (an HA 
receptor) interactions with p300 (a histone acetyltransferase) and SIRT1 (a 
histone deacetylase) in human breast tumor cells (MCF-7 cells). Specifically, 
our results indicate that HA binding to CD44 up-regulates p300 expression and 
its acetyltransferase activity that, in turn, promotes acetylation of 
beta-catenin and NFkappaB-p65 leading to activation of beta-catenin-associated 
T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor transcriptional co-activation and 
NFkappaB-specific transcriptional up-regulation, respectively. These changes 
then cause the expression of the MDR1 (P-glycoprotein/P-gp) gene and the 
anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-x(L) resulting in chemoresistance in MCF-7 cells. Our 
data also show that down-regulation of p300, beta-catenin, or NFkappaB-p65 in 
MCF-7 cells (by transfecting cells with p300-, beta-catenin-, or 
NFkappaB-p65-specific small interfering RNA) inhibits the HA/CD44-mediated 
beta-catenin/NFkappaB-p65 acetylation and abrogates the aforementioned 
transcriptional activities. Subsequently, there is a significant decrease in 
both MDR1 and Bcl-x(L) gene expression and an enhancement in caspase-3 activity 
and chemosensitivity in the breast tumor cells. Further analyses indicate that 
activation of SIRT1 (deacetylase) by resveratrol (a natural antioxidant) induces 
SIRT1-p300 association and acetyltransferase inactivation, leading to 
deacetylation of HA/CD44-induced beta-catenin and NFkappaB-p65, inhibition of 
beta-catenin-T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor and NFkappaB-specific 
transcriptional activation, and the impairment of MDR1 and Bcl-x(L) gene 
expression. All these multiple effects lead to an activation of caspase-3 and a 
reduction of chemoresistance. Together, these findings suggest that the 
interactions between HA/CD44-stimulated p300 (acetyltransferase) and 
resveratrol-activated SIRT1 (deacetylase) play pivotal roles in regulating the 
balance between cell survival versus apoptosis, and multidrug resistance versus 
sensitivity in breast tumor cells.
