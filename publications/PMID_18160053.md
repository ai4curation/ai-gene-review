Frataxin is a ubiquitous mitochondrial iron-binding protein involved in the 
biosynthesis of Fe/S clusters and heme. Its deficiency causes Friedreich's 
ataxia, a severe neurodegenerative disease. Mitochondrial ferritin is another 
major iron-binding protein, abundant in the testis and in sideroblasts from 
patients with sideroblastic anemia. We previously showed that its expression 
rescued the defects caused by frataxin deficiency in the yeast. To verify if 
this occurs also in mammals, we silenced frataxin in HeLa cells. This caused a 
reduction of growth, inhibition of the activity of aconitase and superoxide 
dismutase-2 and reduction of cytosolic ferritins without alteration of 
mitochondrial iron content. None of these effects were evident when silencing 
was done in cells expressing mitochondrial ferritin. These data indicate that 
frataxin has some roles in controlling the balance between different 
mitochondrial iron pools that are partially in common with those of 
mitochondrial ferritin.
