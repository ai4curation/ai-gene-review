Patients carrying mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes have shown 
to have high risk in developing breast and ovarian cancers. Two potential 
functions of BRCA2 were proposed which includes role in the regulation of 
transcription and also in DNA repair. Forty-five-amino acid region encoded by 
exon 3 of BRCA2 was shown to have transcriptional activation function. Recent 
studies of the several enzymes involved in acetylation and deacetylation of 
histone residues have revealed a possible relationship between gene 
transcriptional activation and histone acetylation. Since BRCA2 appear to 
function as a transcriptional factor, we have tested for Histone acetyl 
transferase (HAT) activity of BRCA2. Here, we present evidence that BRCA2 has 
intrinsic HAT activity, which maps to the amino-terminal region of BRCA2. Our 
results demonstrate that BRCA2 proteins acetylate primarily H3 and H4 of free 
histones. These observations suggest that HAT activity of BRCA2 may play an 
important role in the regulation of transcription and tumor suppressor function.

Individuals with a single functional copy of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor have elevated risks for breast, ovarian, and other solid tumor malignancies. The exact mechanisms of carcinogenesis due to BRCA2 haploinsufficiency remain unclear, but one possibility is that at-risk cells are subject to acute periods of decreased BRCA2 availability and function (“BRCA2-crisis”), which may contribute to disease. Here, we establish an in vitro model for BRCA2-crisis that demonstrates chromatin remodeling and activation of an NF-κB survival pathway in response to transient BRCA2 depletion. Mechanistically, we identify BRCA2 chromatin binding, histone acetylation, and associated transcriptional activity as critical determinants of the epigenetic response to BRCA2-crisis. These chromatin alterations are reflected in transcriptional profiles of pre-malignant tissues from BRCA2 carriers and, therefore, may reflect natural steps in human disease. By modeling BRCA2-crisis in vitro, we have derived insights into pre-neoplastic molecular alterations that may enhance the development of preventative therapies.

Gruber et al. identify EGF-independent proliferation in mammary cells following transient BRCA2 depletion (“BRCA2-crisis”). In the absence of recurrent genomic mutations, chromatin remodeling mediated by NF-κB signaling drives gene expression changes. This in vitro model shares molecular commonalities observed in BRCA2+/− carriers.
