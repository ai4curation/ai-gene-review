Patients carrying mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes have shown 
to have high risk in developing breast and ovarian cancers. Two potential 
functions of BRCA2 were proposed which includes role in the regulation of 
transcription and also in DNA repair. Forty-five-amino acid region encoded by 
exon 3 of BRCA2 was shown to have transcriptional activation function. Recent 
studies of the several enzymes involved in acetylation and deacetylation of 
histone residues have revealed a possible relationship between gene 
transcriptional activation and histone acetylation. Since BRCA2 appear to 
function as a transcriptional factor, we have tested for Histone acetyl 
transferase (HAT) activity of BRCA2. Here, we present evidence that BRCA2 has 
intrinsic HAT activity, which maps to the amino-terminal region of BRCA2. Our 
results demonstrate that BRCA2 proteins acetylate primarily H3 and H4 of free 
histones. These observations suggest that HAT activity of BRCA2 may play an 
important role in the regulation of transcription and tumor suppressor function.
