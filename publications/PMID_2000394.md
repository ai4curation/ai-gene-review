We report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a second human 
cyclosporin A-binding protein (hCyPB). Homology analyses reveal that hCyPB is a 
member of the cyclophilin B (CyPB) family, which includes yeast CyPB, Drosophila 
nina A, and rat cyclophilin-like protein. This family is distinguished from the 
cyclophilin A (CyPA) family by the presence of endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER)-directed signal sequences. hCyPB has a hydrophobic leader sequence not 
found in hCyPA, and its first 25 amino acids are removed upon expression in 
Escherichia coli. Moreover, we show that hCyPB is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans 
isomerase which can be inhibited by cyclosporin A. These observations suggest 
that other members of the CyPB family will have similar enzymatic properties. 
Sequence comparisons of the CyPB proteins show a central, 165-amino acid 
peptidyl-prolyl isomerase and cyclosporin A-binding domain, flanked by variable 
N-terminal and C-terminal domains. These two variable regions may impart 
compartmental specificity and regulation to this family of cyclophilin proteins 
containing the conserved core domain. Northern blot analyses show that hCyPB 
mRNA is expressed in the Jurkat T-cell line, consistent with its possible target 
role in cyclosporin A-mediated immunosuppression.
