alpha-Crystallin consists of two subunits, alphaA and alphaB, and each can form 
an oligomer by itself or with the other. The aggregation arises from interdomain 
interactions. However, it is not known whether such interactions also exist 
among alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallins. This heterogeneous crystallin 
interaction is far weaker than the homogeneous crystallin interaction and is 
difficult to detect by conventional spectroscopic measurements. We used a 
mammalian two-hybrid system in this study. The major crystallin components, 
alphaA-, alphaB-, betaB2-, and gammaC-crystallin genes, were subcloned into the 
DNA binding domain and transcription activation domain vectors of the two-hybrid 
system, and they were cotransfected along with a chloramphenicol 
acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector into HeLa cells. Chloramphenicol 
acetyltransferase activity indicated that there were interactions between 
alphaA- (or alphaB-) and betaB2- or gammaC-crystallins but with an intensity of 
one-third that of alphaA-alphaB interactions. Hsp27, a member of the family of 
the small heat-shock proteins, showed a similar interaction property with 
alphaB-crystallin. Using the N- and C-terminal domain-truncated mutants, we 
demonstrated that both domains were important in the alphaA-crystallin 
self-interaction, but that only the C-terminal domain was important in the 
alphaB-crystallin self-interaction. These results show that the two-hybrid 
system can detect interactions among various crystallins and may be used in 
mapping interaction domains.
