and in vivo.

The p53 tumor suppressor gene product can induce apoptotic cell death through an 
unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that a temperature-sensitive p53 induces 
temperature-dependent decreases in the expression of the apoptosis-suppressing 
gene bcl-2 in the murine leukemia cell M1, while simultaneously stimulating 
increases in the expression of bax, a gene which encodes a dominant-inhibitor of 
the Bcl-2 protein. Mice deficient in p53 exhibit increases in Bcl-2 and 
decreases in Bax protein levels in several tissues as determined by 
immunohistochemical and immunoblot methods. The findings suggest a potential 
mechanism by which p53 regulates apoptosis, as well as responses to radiation 
and chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer.
