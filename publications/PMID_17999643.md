Ethylene is an important plant growth regulator perceived by membrane-bound 
ethylene receptors. The ETR1 ethylene receptor is positively regulated by a 
predicted membrane protein, RTE1, based on genetic studies in Arabidopsis. RTE1 
homologs exist in plants, animals and protists, but the molecular function of 
RTE1 is unknown. Here, we examine RTE1 expression and subcellular protein 
localization in order to gain a better understanding of RTE1 and its function in 
relation to ETR1. Arabidopsis plants transformed with the RTE1 promoter fused to 
the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene revealed that RTE1 expression partly 
correlates with previously described sites of ETR1 expression or sites of 
ethylene response, such as the seedling root, root hairs and apical hook. RTE1 
transcript levels are also enhanced by ethylene treatment, and reduced by the 
inhibition of ethylene signaling. For subcellular localization of RTE1, a 
functional RTE1 fusion to red fluorescent protein (RFP) was expressed under the 
control of the native RTE1 promoter. Using fluorescence microscopy, RTE1 was 
observed primarily at the Golgi apparatus and partially at the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) in stably transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts, roots and root 
hairs. Next, a functional ETR1 fusion to a 5xMyc epitope tag was expressed under 
the control of the native ETR1 promoter. Immunohistochemistry of root hairs not 
only showed ETR1 residing at the ER as previously reported, but revealed 
substantial localization of ETR1 at the Golgi apparatus. Lastly, we demonstrated 
the subcellular co-localization of RTE1 and ETR1. These findings support and 
enhance the genetic model that RTE1 plays a role in regulating ETR1.

Introduction

Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone that plays an important role in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses ( Abeles et al. , 1992 ). Responses to ethylene include promotion of fruit ripening, seed germination, root hair formation, flowering, abscission and senescence. At the cellular level, the ethylene-response pathway is initiated by a family of ethylene receptors, which have similarity to the two-component histidine protein kinase family, and which signal through a series of proteins that lead to changes in gene expression ( Chen et al. , 2005 ; Li and Guo, 2007 ).

Arabidopsis has five ethylene receptors (ETR1, ERS1, EIN4, ETR2 and ERS2) ( Chang et al. , 1993 ; Hua et al. , 1995 , 1998 ; Sakai et al. , 1998 ), which are negative regulators of ethylene responses ( Hall and Bleecker, 2003 ; Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998 ; Qu et al. , 2007 ). The receptors consist of an N-terminal membrane-bound region containing the ethylene-binding pocket, followed by a GAF-like domain and a histidine protein kinase-like domain. ETR1, EIN4 and ETR2 also carry a C-terminal receiver domain. The receptors fall into two subfamilies based on structural similarities ( Chen et al. , 2005 ). ETR1 and ERS1 comprise subfamily I, with three transmembrane domains followed by a highly conserved histidine kinase domain. EIN4, ETR2 and ERS2 comprise subfamily II, with four N-terminal transmembrane domains and a degenerate histidine kinase domain. Although the five receptors have functional redundancy, subfamily I has a stronger effect than subfamily II in ethylene signaling ( Hall and Bleecker, 2003 ; Qu et al. , 2007 ).

According to the current model for ethylene receptor action, the receptors repress responses when ethylene is not bound, and are turned off when ethylene is bound, resulting in the activation of responses ( Chen et al. , 2005 ). The receptors have been shown to bind ethylene ( O’Malley et al. , 2005 ; Schaller and Bleecker, 1995 ) with the help of a copper co-factor Cu(I) ( Rodriguez et al. , 1999 ), which requires RAN1, a homolog of the Golgi-bound Menkes/Wilson P-type ATPase copper transporter in mammals ( Hirayama et al. , 1999 ; Woeste and Kieber, 2000 ). The mechanism of ethylene receptor signaling is unknown. ETR1 and ERS1 display histidine autokinase activity ( Gamble et al. , 1998 ; Moussatche and Klee, 2004 ), while the subfamily II receptors, plus ERS1, exhibit autophosphorylation on serine residues ( Moussatche and Klee, 2004 ). However, kinase activity does not appear to play a significant role in ethylene receptor signaling ( Gamble et al. , 2002 ; Wang et al. , 2003 ).

The REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY1 ( RTE1 ) gene was recently identified as a positive regulator of ETR1 signal transmission ( Resnick et al. , 2006 ). RTE1 encodes a novel predicted membrane protein with no sequence similarity to proteins of known function. RTE1 homologs are found in plants, animals and protists, but currently the only ascribed function for RTE1 is in ethylene signaling in plants ( Barry and Giovannoni, 2006 ; Resnick et al. , 2006 ). Mutants of rte1 were isolated based on their ability to suppress the ethylene insensitivity of the gain-of-function mutant etr1–2. rte1 does not suppress the gain-of-function allele etr1–1 , nor does it suppress gain-of-function alleles of the four other ethylene receptor genes, suggesting that RTE1 regulation is specific for the ETR1 receptor and is likely to occur at the protein level ( Resnick et al. , 2006 ). The rte1 null mutant displays ethylene hypersensitivity that phenocopies the etr1–7 null mutant, and RTE1 is thought to act in the same pathway as ETR1 , as the etr1–7 rte1–2 double mutant is indistinguishable from the etr1–7 and rte1–2 single mutants ( Resnick et al. , 2006 ). Over-expression of RTE1 confers reduced ethylene sensitivity that is largely dependent on the ETR1 locus ( Resnick et al. , 2006 ; Zhou et al. , 2007 ). Similarly, over-expression of the tomato RTE1 homolog, GREEN-RIPE ( GR ), confers ethylene insensitivity in tomato ( Barry and Giovannoni, 2006 ).

Less is known about ethylene signaling at the cell biological level. Membrane fractionation studies have placed the ETR1 receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ( Chen et al. , 2002 ). The Raf-like kinase CTR1, which is the next downstream component in the ethylene-response pathway ( Clark et al. , 1998 ; Kieber et al. , 1993 ), is recruited to the ER through physical interaction with the ethylene receptors ( Gao et al. , 2003 ). RTE1, on the other hand, has been co-localized with a marker at the Golgi apparatus (in onion epidermal cells) ( Zhou et al. , 2007 ). Sequence analyses predict that Arabidopsis RTE1 is an integral membrane protein carrying between two and four transmembrane domains (aramemnon plant membrane protein database: http://aramemnon.botanik.uni-koeln.de/index.ep ). Both RTE1 and ETR1 lack an obvious signal sequence for the secretory pathway, and there are no clear predictions of subcellular location for RTE1, RTE1 homologs or ETR1.

In order to gain a better understanding of RTE1 and its function in relation to the ETR1 receptor, we analyzed the gene expression pattern of RTE1 and determined the subcellular localization of the RTE1 protein in Arabidopsis. We show here that RTE1 expression is generally correlated with sites of ETR1 expression and ethylene response. We also demonstrate that the RTE1 protein is localized primarily at the Golgi apparatus and partially at the ER. In the course of this study, we found that the ETR1 receptor localizes not only at the ER as previously reported, but also at the Golgi. By examining RTE1 and ETR1 simultaneously, we show that they exhibit subcellular co-localization. These findings provide cell biological data in support of the model that RTE1 plays a role in regulating ETR1 ethylene signaling.

Discussion

Previous genetic analyses have indicated that Arabidopsis RTE1 is a positive regulator of ETR1 ethylene receptor function ( Resnick et al. , 2006 ; Zhou et al. , 2007 ). In this paper, we advance the understanding of RTE1 and ETR1 function at the cell biological level, providing data that support and enhance the genetic model.

GUS reporter analysis of the RTE1 promoter revealed that RTE1 has discrete and specific expression patterns, some of which can be correlated with sites of ETR1 expression and ethylene response. RTE1 is strongly expressed in the seedling apical hook, root tip and root hairs – all cells that are linked to ethylene-inducible rapid cell division and/or cell elongation ( Dolan, 2001 ; Ortega-Martínez et al. , 2007 ; Raz and Koornneef, 2001 ). While RTE1 shows little or no expression in the hypocotyl, the hypocotyl is derived from cells that have passed through the apical hook ( Raz and Ecker, 1999 ) where RTE1 expression is high. RTE1 is also expressed in developing leaves, young cotyledons, stems, rachis and style. The RTE1 expression pattern partly overlaps with the pattern of expression of the ETR1 receptor gene, as detected by in situ hybridization in etiolated seedlings ( Hua et al. , 1998 ; Raz and Ecker, 1999 ), although ETR1 expression is higher in the hypocotyl and weaker in the apical hook in 2- and 3-day-old seedlings ( Raz and Ecker, 1999 ). ETR1 is also expressed in stems and leaves, and in the locules of anthers, developing carpels and ovules ( Hua et al. , 1998 ). Unlike ETR1 expression, which is not ethyleneinduced ( Hua et al. , 1998 ), RTE1 expression is enhanced upon ethylene treatment and reduced when ethylene signaling is blocked, suggesting a mechanism of negative feedback on the response pathway. The ethylene-enhanced expression that we observed is consistent with array data indicating that exposure to ethylene results in a fourfold increase in RTE1 transcript levels ( Alonso et al. , 2003 ), as also seen in RNA blots ( Resnick et al. , 2006 ). These findings, showing that RTE1 is expressed preferentially at several important sites for ethylene response, and that expression is responsive to ethylene, are consistent with RTE1 having a regulatory role in ethylene signaling.

The RTE1 protein was visualized in living Arabidopsis cells (protoplasts, root cells and root hair cells) using the RTE1 native promoter and a red fluorescent protein tag. We found that RTE1 is localized predominantly at the Golgi apparatus and partially at the ER. We do not rule out the possibility of a small amount of RTE1 localization at the vacuole, based on the examination of protoplasts co-expressing RFP-RTE1 and a vacuole marker. The ER is one of the major components of the endomembrane system, closely connected with the Golgi apparatus and vacuoles ( Hawes and Satiat-Jeunemaitre, 2005 ). There was no obvious localization of RTE1 at the plasma membrane, peroxisome, mitochondrion or plastid organelles. In addition, we did not detect any alteration in the subcellular localization of RTE1 when the seedlings were treated with ethylene, consistent with the findings of Zhou et al. 2007 , who showed that a CaMV 35S-driven GFPtagged RTE1 fusion was localized at the Golgi apparatus in onion epidermal cells.

Interestingly, we found that the ETR1 receptor is localized primarily at the Golgi apparatus and partially at the ER in Arabidopsis root hair cells. Chen et al. 2002 previously reported localization of ETR1 at the ER, but did not rule out the possibility of Golgi localization; ER localization was based on the co-fractionation of ETR1 and an ER marker by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, in which the Golgicontaining fractions showed a similar, but slightly broader distribution, than that of the ER fractions ( Chen et al. , 2002 , 2007 ). The ER and Golgi fractions exhibited the same shift from higher to lower density in the absence of Mg 2+ , indicating that the ER and Golgi apparatus are not easily resolved by this method ( Chen et al. , 2002 , 2007 ). There are known structural and functional links between the ER and Golgi apparatus, and, in fact, a continuum between the ER and Golgi apparatus has been proposed by Hawes and Satiat-Jeunemaitre (2005) . Conceivably, ETR1 is differentially localized depending on the stage or type of cell, thus yielding different results depending on the cell types examined. For the previously published sucrose density gradient centrifugation, protein was extracted from plants grown in liquid culture, containing predominantly green tissue. Additionally, leaf cells were examined by immunoelectron microscopy, which again did not rule out the possibility of ETR1 localized at the Golgi apparatus ( Chen et al. , 2002 ). In the study presented here, the ETR1–5xMyc fusion was localized by immunohistochemistry of intact root hair cells. Although the 5xMyc epitope tag could potentially lead to artifacts, the ETR1–5xMyc construct was able to rescue an etr1 null mutation, and the ETR1–5xMyc fusion protein was seen in Western blots as an intact band of the expected molecular weight. There was no distinct background signal detected by immunofluorescence microscopy of root hair cells, even though a single faint band was occasionally detected in Western blots whether or not the plants carried the ETR1–5xMyc construct.

Localization of ETR1 at the Golgi apparatus presents an interesting modification to our current understanding of ethylene receptor signaling, but is consistent with the overall model of ethylene signaling. Due to the solubility of ethylene in aqueous and lipid environments, ethylene should be readily perceived by receptors residing at either organelle ( Abeles et al. , 1992 ). The receptors require a copper co-factor in order to bind ethylene ( Rodriguez et al. , 1999 ), and it is believed that this copper is delivered by RAN1 ( Hirayama et al. , 1999 ; Woeste and Kieber, 2000 ). RAN1 is a homolog of the mammalian Menkes/Wilson P-type ATPase copper transporter, which has been localized (in mammals) at the Golgi membrane and delivers copper to the lumen ( Petris et al. , 1996 ). If RAN1 is similarly localized at the Golgi apparatus in plants, then copper could be directly supplied to the Golgi-associated ETR1 receptor, providing a cell biological link between RAN1 and ethylene receptor signaling. Another possible connection is the fact that certain ethylene-induced responses require Golgi-specific functions, thereby associating ETR1 and RTE1 with a site of ethylene response. For example, cell-wall synthesis is required for the processes of cell elongation and expansion, which occur in certain responses to ethylene, such as at the apical hook and in root hair elongation. The components for cell-wall synthesis are produced at the Golgi apparatus ( Lerouxel et al. , 2006 ), and thus the regulation of these processes by ethylene could involve co-localization of ETR1 and RTE1 with components in the Golgi apparatus, in a manner similar to that proposed by Chen et al. 2005 for ERlocalized ethylene receptors. Not all ethylene receptors may be localized at the ER or Golgi apparatus. ETR2 ( Chen et al. , 2007 ) and the melon ethylene receptor CmERS1 (subfamily I) have been localized to the ER using sucrose density gradient fractionation ( Ma et al. , 2006 ), but tobacco NTHK1 (subfamily II) appears to localize at the plasma membrane (PM) ( Xie et al. , 2003 ), and unpublished work by Klee and Tieman (University of Florida) suggests that tomato NEVERRIPE (subfamily I) may also be localized at the PM.

The subcellular co-localization of RTE1 and ETR1 supports the possibility that RTE1 promotes ETR1 signaling through physical interaction with ETR1. Whether a physical interaction occurs between these proteins is currently under investigation. If RTE1 acts directly on ETR1, then RTE1 might serve as a molecular chaperone or co-factor for ETR1, or affect the membrane trafficking or stability of ETR1. Alternatively, RTE1 could exert an indirect effect, such as altering the conformation of ETR1 via changes to the membrane or other proteins, or changes in the status of copper. If the other ethylene receptors in Arabidopsis prove to be localized primarily to other tissues or membranes relative to RTE1, then co-localization with ETR1 might be an underlying basis for the specificity of RTE1 for ETR1. Differential tissue localization of ethylene receptors has been postulated for the non-global ethylene effects of GR over-expression in tomato ( Barry and Giovannoni, 2007 ). Further insight into the connections between RTE1 and ETR1 should advance our understanding of the basis for RTE1’s regulation of, and specificity for, the ETR1 receptor in ethylene signaling.
