Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a homodimeric peptide growth factor 
which binds to two structurally related tyrosine kinase receptors denoted Flt1 
and KDR. In order to compare the signal transduction via these two receptors, 
the human Flt1 and KDR proteins were stably expressed in porcine aortic 
endothelial cells. Binding analyses using 125I-VEGF revealed Kd values of 16 pM 
for Flt1 and 760 pM for KDR. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) 
cells were found to express two distinct populations of binding sites with 
affinities similar to those for Flt1 and KDR, respectively. The KDR expressing 
cells showed striking changes in cell morphology, actin reorganization and 
membrane ruffling, chemotaxis and mitogenicity upon VEGF stimulation, whereas 
Flt1 expressing cells lacked such responses. KDR was found to undergo 
ligand-induced autophosphorylation in intact cells, and both Flt1 and KDR were 
phosphorylated in vitro in response to VEGF, however, KDR much more efficiently 
than Flt1. Neither the receptor-associated activity of phosphatidylinositol 
3'-kinase nor tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma were affected by 
stimulation of Flt1 or KDR expressing cells, and phosphorylation of GTPase 
activating protein was only slightly increased. Members of the Src family such 
as Fyn and Yes showed an increased level of phosphorylation upon VEGF 
stimulation of cells expressing Flt1 but not in cells expressing KDR. The 
maximal responses in KDR expressing porcine aortic endothelial cells were 
obtained at higher VEGF concentrations as compared to HUVE cells, i.e. in the 
presence of Flt1. This difference could possibly be explained by the formation 
of heterodimeric complexes between KDR and Flt1, or other molecules, in HUVE 
cells.
