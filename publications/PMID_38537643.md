Endolysosomal exonucleases PLD3 and PLD4 (phospholipases D3 and D4) are 
associated with autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We report structures 
of these enzymes, and the molecular basis of their catalysis. The structures 
reveal an intra-chain dimer topology forming a basic active site at the 
interface. Like other PLD superfamily members, PLD3 and PLD4 carry HxKxxxxD/E 
motifs and participate in phosphodiester-bond cleavage. The enzymes digest ssDNA 
and ssRNA in a 5'-to-3' manner and are blocked by 5'-phosphorylation. We 
captured structures in apo, intermediate, and product states and revealed a 
"link-and-release" two-step catalysis. We also unexpectedly demonstrated 
phosphatase activity via a covalent 3-phosphohistidine intermediate. PLD4 
contains an extra hydrophobic clamp that stabilizes substrate and could affect 
oligonucleotide substrate preference and product release. Biochemical and 
structural analysis of disease-associated mutants of PLD3/4 demonstrated reduced 
enzyme activity or thermostability and the possible basis for disease 
association. Furthermore, these findings provide insight into therapeutic 
design.
