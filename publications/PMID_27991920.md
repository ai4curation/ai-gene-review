Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members play pivotal roles in 
cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Overexpression and mutations 
of EGFRs, or aberrant EGFR signaling are commonly associated with the 
development of various cancers, where constitutive NF-κB activation is often 
found to promote the expression of various proteins involved in the 
proliferation, survival, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of 
cancer cells. However, the mechanism of EGFR-induced NF-κB activation is not 
fully defined. Here, we used a Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation-based 
functional genomics method to perform a high throughput screening and identified 
TMEM43/LUMA as a critical component in EGFR signaling network, mediating 
EGFR-induced NF-κB activation. Our data show that EGFR recruits TMEM43 following 
EGF stimulation. TMEM43 interacts with the scaffold protein CARMA3 and its 
associating complex to induce downstream NF-κB activation, and plays a critical 
role in controlling cell survival. TMEM43 deficiency significantly affects 
colony formation, survival of anoikis-induced cell death, migration and invasion 
of cancer cells in vitro, as well as tumor progression in vivo. Importantly, 
higher expression of TMEM43 closely correlates with brain tumor malignancy, and 
suppression of TMEM43 expression in brain tumor cells inhibited their growth 
both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our studies reveal a crucial link of EGF 
receptor to NF-κB activation and tumor progression.
