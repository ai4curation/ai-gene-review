EGFRvIII, a frequently occurring mutation in primary glioblastoma, results in a 
protein product that cannot bind ligand, but signals constitutively. Deducing 
how EGFRvIII causes transformation has been difficult because of autocrine and 
paracrine loops triggered by EGFRvIII alone or in heterodimers with wild-type 
EGFR. Here, we document coexpression of EGFR and EGFRvIII in primary human 
glioblastoma that drives transformation and tumorigenesis in a cell-intrinsic 
manner. We demonstrate enhancement of downstream STAT signaling triggered by 
EGFR-catalyzed phosphorylation of EGFRvIII, implicating EGFRvIII as a substrate 
for EGFR. Subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3 requires nuclear entry of EGFRvIII 
and formation of an EGFRvIII-STAT3 nuclear complex. Our findings clarify 
specific oncogenic signaling relationships between EGFR and EGFRvIII in 
glioblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a prominent role in many tumors including glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor. Amplification and over-expression is observed in >50% of glioblastoma. Half of EGFR amplified tumors in-turn harbor the EGFRvIII mutant, an intragenic rearrangement generated by in-frame deletion of exons 2-7 from this receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), which consequently signals constitutively in the absence of ligand ( Huang et al., 1997 ; Sugawa et al., 1990 ; Wong et al., 1992 ). A number of studies noted that amplification and over-expression of both EGFR and EGFRvIII conferred a worse prognosis in glioma patients ( Heimberger et al., 2005 ; Shinojima et al., 2003 ), with a clinical trial suggesting vaccination against EGFRvIII as a promising immunotherapy ( Sampson et al., 2010 ). In contrast, a recent report failed to associate amplification of EGFR with outcome ( Weller et al., 2009 ). Expression of EGFRvIII in glioblastoma is heterogeneous and is usually observed in a subpopulation of neoplastic cells ( Nishikawa et al., 2004 ). Most antibodies against EGFR and EGFRvIII cross-react, complicating efforts to examine specific co-expression of EGFR or EGFRvIII in individual tumor cells within a glioblastoma.

Does cross-talk occur between EGFR and EGFRvIII signaling? EGFRvIII induces heparin binding EGF (HB-EGF) in glioma cells. A neutralizing antibody to HB-EGF blocked EGFRvIII-induced proliferation, raising the possibility of a EGFRvIII-HB-EGF-EGFR autocrine loop in glioblastoma ( Inda et al., 2010 ; Ramnarain et al., 2006 ). Expression of EGFRvIII also induces secretion of interleukin 6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. These cytokines activate gp130, generating a paracrine loop that promotes activation of EGFR in neighboring cells ( Inda et al., 2010 ). Physical interaction of EGFRvIII with EGFR has additionally been proposed, associated with phosphorylation of both EGFRvIII and EGFR ( Luwor et al., 2004 ). Collectively, these studies suggest paracrine interactions between cells expressing EGFR or EGFRvIII, as well as physical interactions between EGFRvIII and EGFR within individual cells, as contributors to progression in glioma. Here, we analyze co-expression of EGFR and EGFRvIII in primary glioblastoma tumor cells from patients, and elucidate functional implications of these findings.

DISCUSSION

Amplification and over-expression of EGFR represent striking features of primary glioblastoma, with frequent co-amplification of EGFR and its deletion mutant, EGFRvIII ( Huang et al., 1997 ; Sugawa et al., 1990 ; Wong et al., 1992 ). Using immunofluorescence double staining with EGFR-and EGFRvIII-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that EGFR and EGFRvIII co-localize within individual tumor cells in glioblastoma. We further highlight cooperation between EGFR and EGFRvIII in transformation in vivo , with cell-based experiments showing that EGF treatment of cells expressing both EGFR and EGFRvIII resulted in phosphorylation of both kinases. This result was unexpected, as EGFRvIII is unable to bind or be activated in response to EGF. Using chemical genetic approaches, we found that EGFR promoted unidirectional EGFRvIII signaling in glioblastoma cells, driving further phosphorylation of STAT proteins, and enhanced malignancy. It is intriguing that enhanced STAT signaling is so selectively affected by EGFR/EGFRvIII cross talk, while signaling through PI3K and MAPK is less prominently affected. In addition, STAT signaling has been suggested to feature prominently in glioma stem cells ( Dubuc et al., 2013 ). That rare cells within GBM tumors co-amplify EGFR and EGFRvIII, and phosphorylate STAT3 could be consistent with a role for STAT3 activation within the stem cell compartment of GBM.

How does EGFR activate EGFRvIII? While others have demonstrated physical binding of these two kinases, our co-immunoprecipitation experiments failed to demonstrate this interaction. We were similarly unable to reconstitute signaling in a heterodimeric complex where EGFR was an obligate allosteric activator, and EGFRvIII an obligate receiver. Kinase dead EGFRvIII was readily phosphorylated by EGFR, suggesting EGFRvIII as a substrate of EGFR. Phosphorylation of both EGFR and EGFRvIII were required to fully phosphorylate STAT proteins. EGFR, when expressed alone, led to lower level and shorter duration of STAT phosphorylation, as compared to levels and duration observed in cells co-expressing both EGFR and EGFRvIII. Further, co-expression of EGFR with EGFRvIII DY5 , a mutant in which tyrosines in the tail of EGFRvIII were replaced with phenylalanines, blunted phosphorylation of STAT3 protein.

Analysis of human glioblastoma tumors demonstrated alignment among EGFR, EGFRvIII and STAT signaling in tumors, supporting a model in which EGFR activation of EGFRvIII leads to transphosphorylation of both kinases, converging on STAT signaling. Using subcellular fractionation, we further demonstrated that EGFR phosphorylation of EGFRvIII led to nuclear transport of EGFRvIII, and enhanced the formation of a complex between EGFRvIII and STAT3 in the nucleus. These data suggest that EGFR and EGFRvIII coordinately drive enhanced and prolonged STAT activity in the nucleus. It remains possible however, that very high levels of EGFR could subserve this role even in the absence of EGFRvIII.

In this study, we identify an EGFR-EGFRvIII-STAT signaling axis in a subset of glioblastomas that co-amplify EGFR and EGFRvIII within individual tumor cells. Given that coexpressed EGFR and EGFRvIII, and high levels of STAT signaling may confer both more aggressive behavior in glioblastoma ( Abou-Ghazal et al., 2008 ; Birner et al., 2010 ; Shinojima et al., 2003 ), our findings suggest targeting EGFR in conjunction with STAT signaling as a therapeutic strategy for patients with EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma.
