Autophagy is triggered when organisms sense radical environmental changes, 
including nutritional starvation. During autophagy, cytoplasmic components, 
including organelles, are enclosed within autophagosomes and are degraded upon 
lysosome-vacuole fusion. In this study, we show that processing of GFP-tagged 
Atg8 can serve as a marker for autophagy in the fission yeast 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using this marker, 13 Atg homologues were also found 
to be required for autophagy in fission yeast. In budding yeast, 
autophagy-deficient mutants are known to be sterile, whereas in fission yeast we 
found that up to 30 % of autophagy-defective cells with amino acid auxotrophy 
were able to recover sporulation when an excess of required amino acids was 
supplied. Furthermore, we found that approximately 15 % of the 
autophagy-defective cells were also able to sporulate when a prototrophic strain 
was subjected to nitrogen starvation, which suggested that fission yeast may 
store sufficient intracellular nitrogen to allow partial sporulation under 
nitrogen-limiting conditions, although the majority of the nitrogen source is 
supplied by autophagy. Monitoring of the sporulation process revealed that the 
process was blocked non-specifically at various stages in the atg1Delta and 
atg12Delta mutants, possibly due to a shortage of amino acids. Taking advantage 
of this partial sporulation ability of fission yeast, we sought evidence for the 
existence of a recycling system for nitrogen sources during starvation.
