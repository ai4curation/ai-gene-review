A set of 3907 single-gene knockout (Keio collection) strains of Escherichia coli 
K-12 was examined for strains with increased susceptibility to killing by X- or 
UV-radiation. After screening with a high-throughput resazurin-based assay and 
determining radiation survival with triplicate clonogenic assays, we identified 
76 strains (and associated deleted genes) showing statistically-significant 
increased radiation sensitivity compared to a control strain. To determine gene 
novelty, we constructed a reference database comprised of genes found in nine 
similar studies including ours. This database contains 455 genes comprised of 
103 common genes (found 2-7 times), and 352 uncommon genes (found once). Our 76 
genes includes 43 common genes and 33 uncommon (potentially novel) genes, i.e., 
appY, atoS, betB, bglJ, clpP, cpxA, cysB, cysE, ddlA, dgkA, dppF, dusB, elfG, 
eutK, fadD, glnA, groL, guaB, intF, prpR, queA, rplY, seqA, sufC,yadG, yagJ, 
yahD, yahO, ybaK, ybfA, yfaL, yhjV, and yiaL. Of our 33 uncommon gene mutants, 4 
(12%) were sensitive only to UV-radiation, 10 (30%) only to X-radiation, and 19 
(58%) to both radiations. Our uncommon mutants vs. our common mutants showed 
more radiation specificity, i.e., 12% vs. 9% (sensitive only to UV-); 30% vs. 
16% (X-) and 58% vs. 74% (both radiations). Considering just our 
radiation-sensitive mutants, the median UV-radiation survival (75Jm-2) for 23 
uncommon mutants was 6.84E-3 compared to 1.85E-3 for 36 common mutants 
(P=0.025). Similarly, the average X-radiation survival for 29 uncommon mutants 
was 1.08E-2, compared to 6.19E-3 for 39 common mutants (P=0.010). Comparing gene 
functions using MultiFun terms, uncommon genes tended to show less involvement 
in DNA repair-relevant categories (information transfer and cell processes), but 
greater involvement in seven other categories. Our analysis of 455 genes 
suggests cell survival and DNA repair processes are more complex than previously 
understood, and may be compromised by deficiencies in other processes.
