The reactivity of human thioredoxin (HTR) was tested in several reactions. HTR 
was as efficient as E. coli or plant and algal thioredoxins when assayed with E. 
coli ribonucleotide reductase or for the reduction of insulin. On the other 
hand, HTR was poorly reduced by NADPH and the E. coli flavoenzyme NADPH 
thioredoxin reductase as monitored in the DTNB reduction test. When reduced with 
dithiothreitol (DTT), HTR was much less efficient than thioredoxin m and 
thioredoxin f, the respective specific thioredoxins for the chloroplast enzymes 
NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) and fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase (FBPase). 
Finally, HTR could be used in the photoactivation of NADP-MDH although less 
efficiently than thioredoxin m, proving nevertheless that it can be reduced by 
the iron sulfur enzyme ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase in the presence of 
photoreduced ferredoxin. Based on sequence comparisons, it was expected that HTR 
would display a reactivity similar to chloroplast thioredoxin f rather than to 
thioredoxin m. However the observed behavior of FTR did not exactly fit this 
prediction. The results are discussed in relation to the structural data 
available for the proteins.
