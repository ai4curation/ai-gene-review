Cellular responsiveness to retinoic acid and its metabolites is conferred 
through two structurally and pharmacologically distinct families of receptors: 
the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and the retinoid X receptors (RXR). Here we 
report that the transcriptional activity of RAR and RXR can be reciprocally 
modulated by direct interactions between the two proteins. RAR and RXR have a 
high degree of cooperativity in binding to target DNA, consistent with previous 
reports indicating that the binding of either RAR or RXR to their cognate 
response elements is enhanced by factors present in nuclear extracts. RXR also 
interacts directly with and enhances the binding of nuclear receptors conferring 
responsiveness to vitamin D3 and thyroid hormone T3; the DNA-binding activities 
of these receptors are also stimulated by the presence of nuclear extracts. 
Together these data indicate that RXR has a central role in multiple hormonal 
signalling pathways.
