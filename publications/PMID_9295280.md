Translation initiation factor eIF3 is a large, multisubunit protein complex that 
plays a central role in the pathway of initiation by promoting the binding of 
both methionyl-tRNAi and mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit. As part of a broad 
effort to elucidate the structure of eIF3, we have cloned and sequenced the 
human cDNA encoding the 48-kDa subunit, eIF3-p48. The recombinant protein 
comigrates with the authentic p48 subunit in purified eIF3 and coprecipitates 
with affinity-purified antibodies to the p170 subunit of eIF3. A search of the 
data base indicates that the mouse gene encoding eIF3-p48 had previously been 
identified and characterized by others as int-6. The int-6 gene is the site of 
frequent integration of mouse mammary tumor virus DNA into chromosomes, 
implicating the gene in the regulation of cell proliferation. In addition, it 
was shown elsewhere that the homologous human int-6 gene product binds to the 
human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein, leading to the translocation of 
Int-6 to the cytoplasm. We discuss how the cytosolic function of eIF3-p48 
(Int-6) in protein synthesis may account for oncogenesis caused by these two 
viruses.
