BACKGROUND: The immune response is regulated through a tightly controlled 
cytokine network. The counteracting balance between protein tyrosine kinase 
(PTK) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity regulates intracellular 
signaling in the immune system initiated by these extracellular polypeptides. 
Mice deficient for the T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) display gross 
defects in the hematopoietic compartment, indicating a critical role for TCPTP 
in the regulation of immune homeostasis. To date, the molecular basis underlying 
this phenotype has not been reported.
RESULTS: We have identified two members of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases 
(JAKs), JAK1 and JAK3, as bona fide substrates of TCPTP. Inherent substrate 
specificity in the TCPTP-JAK interaction is demonstrated by the inability of 
other closely related PTP family members to form an in vivo interaction with the 
JAKs in hematopoietic cells. In keeping with a negative regulatory role for 
TCPTP in cytokine signaling, expression of TCPTP in T cells abrogated 
phosphorylation of STAT5 following interleukin (IL)-2 stimulation. 
TCPTP-deficient lymphocytes treated with IL-2 had increased levels of 
tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5, and thymocytes treated with interferon 
(IFN)-alpha or IFN-gamma had increased tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1. 
Hyperphosphorylation of JAK1 and elevated expression of iNOS was observed in 
IFN-gamma-treated, TCPTP-deficient, bone marrow-derived macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified JAK1 and JAK3 as physiological substrates of 
TCPTP. These results indicate a negative regulatory role for TCPTP in cytokine 
signaling and provide insight into the molecular defect underlying the phenotype 
of TCPTP-deficient animals.
