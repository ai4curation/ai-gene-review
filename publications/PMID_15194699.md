Employing a yeast two-hybrid screen with the COOH terminus of polycystin-2, one 
of the proteins mutated in patients with polycystic kidney disease, we were able 
to isolate a novel protein that we call PIGEA-14 (polycystin-2 interactor, 
Golgi- and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein with a molecular mass of 14 
kDa). Molecular modeling only predicts a coiled-coil motif, but no other 
functional domains, in PIGEA-14. In a subsequent two-hybrid screen using 
PIGEA-14 as a bait, we found GM130, a component of the cis-compartment of the 
Golgi apparatus. Co-expression of the PIGEA-14 and PKD2 cDNAs in LLC-PK(1) and 
HeLa cells resulted in a redistribution of PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2 to the 
trans-Golgi network, which suggests that PIGEA-14 plays an important role in 
regulating the intracellular location of polycystin-2 and possibly other 
intracellular proteins. Our results also indicate that the intracellular 
trafficking of polycystin-2 is regulated both at the level of the endo-plasmic 
reticulum and that of the trans-Golgi network.
