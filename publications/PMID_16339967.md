The LEM (lamina-associated polypeptide-emerin-MAN1) domain is a motif shared by 
a group of lamin-interacting proteins in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and in 
the nucleoplasm. The LEM domain mediates binding to a DNA-crosslinking protein, 
barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). We describe a novel, ubiquitously 
expressed LEM domain protein, LEM2, which is structurally related to MAN1. LEM2 
contains an N-terminal LEM motif, two predicted transmembrane domains and a 
MAN1-Src1p C-terminal (MSC) domain highly homologous to MAN1, but lacks the 
MAN1-specific C-terminal RNA-recognition motif. Immunofluorescence microscopy of 
digitonin-treated cells and subcellular fractionation identified LEM2 as a 
lamina-associated protein residing in the INM. LEM2 binds to the lamin C tail in 
vitro. Targeting of LEM2 to the nuclear envelope requires A-type lamins and is 
mediated by the N-terminal and transmembrane domains. Highly overexpressed LEM2 
accumulates in patches at the nuclear envelope and forms membrane bridges 
between nuclei of adjacent cells. LEM2 structures recruit A-type lamins, emerin, 
MAN1 and BAF, whereas lamin B and lamin B receptor are excluded. Our data 
identify LEM2 as a novel A-type-lamin-associated INM protein involved in nuclear 
structure organization.
