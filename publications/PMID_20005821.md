Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Previous studies suggest that the effect of apoE on amyloid-beta 
(A beta) accumulation plays a major role in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, 
understanding proteins that control apoE metabolism may provide new targets for 
regulating A beta levels. LDLR, a member of the LDL receptor family, binds to 
apoE, yet its potential role in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. We hypothesized 
that LDLR overexpression in the brain would decrease apoE levels, enhance A beta 
clearance, and decrease A beta deposition. To test our hypothesis, we created 
several transgenic mice that overexpress LDLR in the brain and found that apoE 
levels in these mice decreased by 50%-90%. Furthermore, LDLR overexpression 
dramatically reduced A beta aggregation and enhanced A beta clearance from the 
brain extracellular space. Plaque-associated neuroinflammatory responses were 
attenuated in LDLR transgenic mice. These findings suggest that increasing LDLR 
levels may represent a novel AD treatment strategy.
