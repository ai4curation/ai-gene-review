p53 is the most frequent known target for mutation in human cancer. Evidence 
suggests that p53 protein may be involved variously in transcription and cell 
cycle control, in DNA replication and in G1 checkpoint control following the 
cellular response to radiation induced DNA damage. p53 blocks DNA replication of 
the small DNA tumour virus, simian virus 40, by inhibiting unwinding of the 
viral origin of replication by the DNA helicase activity of the virally encoded 
large T antigen protein. Here we report the novel observation that human p53 
protein can bind ATP and exhibits an intrinsic ATP stimulated DNA strand 
reassociation activity. Both activities map to the carboxyl terminal 128 amino 
acids of p53. Thus, in addition to any role in transcription, our results 
indicate that p53 is potentially capable of inhibiting mammalian replicative DNA 
synthesis by blocking the DNA strand separation step during replication origin 
recruitment. However, the ability of p53 to modulate the topological 
relationship between complementary nucleotide strands is also compatible with a 
direct role for p53 in other aspects of DNA synthesis, recombination or repair.
