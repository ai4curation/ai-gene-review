Contrary to expectations based on the visible phenotypic behavior of seedlings 
undergoing de-etiolation in response to continuous red light (Rc), previous gene 
expression profiling showed that one or more of the five-membered phytochrome 
(phy) family of Arabidopsis, other than phyB, is predominantly responsible for 
transducing the Rc signals to light-responsive genes. To begin to identify which 
phys are involved, and to define potential primary targets of phy signaling, we 
have examined the genome-wide expression profiles of genes responding to Rc 
within 1 h (early response genes) of initial exposure of dark-grown wild-type, 
phyA, phyB and phyAphyB double mutant seedlings to the light signal. The data 
show that phyA has a quantitatively dominant role in Rc-induced expression of 
these early response genes, that phyB has minimal detectable regulatory activity 
in the presence of phyA, but assumes a quantitatively larger role in its 
absence, and that phyA and phyB combined are responsible for the full extent of 
Rc responsiveness of 96% of these genes. No evidence was obtained of a 
significant role for the remaining family members, phyC, phyD or phyE, in this 
process. In striking contrast, Rc-imposed repression of early response gene 
expression remains quantitatively strong in the phyAphyB double mutant, as well 
as the monogenic mutants, suggesting a significant role for one or more of the 
other three phys in this response. Examination of the established or predicted 
functional roles of the early response genes indicates that genes encoding 
transcription factors represent the largest single category, at a frequency 
three times their prevalence genome-wide. This dominance is particularly 
striking among those genes responding most robustly to the Rc signal, where >50% 
are classified as involved in transcriptional regulation, suggesting that these 
may have potentially primary regulatory roles at the interface between phy 
signaling and the light-responsive transcriptional network. Integration of the 
present data with those of a previous genome-scale transcriptional analysis of a 
pif3 mutant, suggests a complex network involving perception and transduction of 
inductive Rc signals by both phyA and phyB through both PIF3 and other undefined 
signaling partners to early response genes.
