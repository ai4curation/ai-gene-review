ATG7 is an autophagy-related E1-like enzyme that is essential for two 
ubiquitination-like reactions, ATG12-conjugation and LC3-lipidation. The 
existence of functional sequences at the amino-terminal region of human ATG7 
remains uncertain. Mutational analyses of ATG7 revealed that both mutant 
ATG7ΔFAP lacking the FAP motif and ATG7FAPtoDDD, in which the Phe15-Ala16-Pro17 
sequence was changed to Asp-Asp-Asp, could not complement defects in endogenous 
ATG12-conjugation and LC3-lipidation when expressed in Atg7-deficient mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). However, wild-type ATG7 complemented the defects 
in these cells. Overexpression of GFP-ATG10 and GFP-ATG12 rescued a defect in 
ATG12-conjugation in Atg7-deficient MEFs expressing mutant ATG7ΔFAP and 
ATG7FAPtoDDD, whereas overexpression of all ATG proteins related to 
ATG12-conjugation and LC3-lipidation could not rescue a defect in LC3-lipidation 
in Atg7-deficient MEFs expressing these ATG7 mutants. Both ATG7ΔFAP and 
ATG7FAPtoDDD mutants showed severe defects in the formation of an E2-substrate 
intermediate of ATG3 with LC3 in LC3-lipidation, but were able to form an 
E1-substrate intermediate of ATG7 with LC3 and the E1- and E2-substrate 
intermediates in ATG12-conjugation with reduced efficiency. These ATG7 mutants 
could also form the ATG12-ATG3 conjugate. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments 
revealed that the FAP motif of ATG7 is essential for the interaction of ATG7 
with ATG3, but not for ATG7-homodimerization. These results indicated that the 
FAP motif of ATG7 is indispensable for formation of the ATG3-LC3 E2-substrate 
intermediate through the interaction of ATG7 with ATG3.
