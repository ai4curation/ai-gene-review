Thalidomide and its derivatives, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are immune 
modulatory drugs (IMiDs) used in the treatment of haematologic malignancies. 
IMiDs bind CRBN, the substrate receptor of the CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (also known 
as CRL4(CRBN)) E3 ubiquitin ligase, and inhibit ubiquitination of endogenous 
CRL4(CRBN) substrates. Unexpectedly, IMiDs also repurpose the ligase to target 
new proteins for degradation. Lenalidomide induces degradation of the lymphoid 
transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos (also known as IKZF1 and IKZF3), and 
casein kinase 1α (CK1α), which contributes to its clinical efficacy in the 
treatment of multiple myeloma and 5q-deletion associated myelodysplastic 
syndrome (del(5q) MDS), respectively. How lenalidomide alters the specificity of 
the ligase to degrade these proteins remains elusive. Here we present the 2.45 Å 
crystal structure of DDB1-CRBN bound to lenalidomide and CK1α. CRBN and 
lenalidomide jointly provide the binding interface for a CK1α β-hairpin-loop 
located in the kinase N-lobe. We show that CK1α binding to CRL4(CRBN) is 
strictly dependent on the presence of an IMiD. Binding of IKZF1 to CRBN 
similarly requires the compound and both, IKZF1 and CK1α, use a related binding 
mode. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the selective efficacy of 
lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS therapy. We anticipate that high-affinity 
protein-protein interactions induced by small molecules will provide 
opportunities for drug development, particularly for targeted protein 
degradation.
