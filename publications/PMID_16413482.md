Protein disulfide isomerase plays a key role in catalyzing the folding of 
secretory proteins. It features two catalytically inactive thioredoxin domains 
inserted between two catalytically active thioredoxin domains and an acidic 
C-terminal tail. The crystal structure of yeast PDI reveals that the four 
thioredoxin domains are arranged in the shape of a twisted "U" with the active 
sites facing each other across the long sides of the "U." The inside surface of 
the "U" is enriched in hydrophobic residues, thereby facilitating interactions 
with misfolded proteins. The domain arrangement, active site location, and 
surface features strikingly resemble the Escherichia coli DsbC and DsbG protein 
disulfide isomerases. Biochemical studies demonstrate that all domains of PDI, 
including the C-terminal tail, are required for full catalytic activity. The 
structure defines a framework for rationalizing the differences between the two 
active sites and their respective roles in catalyzing the formation and 
rearrangement of disulfide bonds.
