Import of carrier proteins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial inner 
membrane of yeast is mediated by a distinct system consisting of two soluble 
70-kDa protein complexes in the intermembrane space and a 300-kDa complex in the 
inner membrane, the TIM22 complex. The TIM22 complex contains the peripheral 
subunits Tim9p, Tim10p, and Tim12p and the integral membrane subunits Tim22p and 
Tim54p. We identify here an additional subunit, an 18-kDa integral membrane 
protein termed Tim18p. This protein is made as a 21.9-kDa precursor which is 
imported into mitochondria and processed to its mature form. When mitochondria 
are gently solubilized, Tim18p comigrates with the other subunits of the TIM22 
complex on nondenaturing gels and is coimmunoprecipitated with Tim54p and 
Tim12p. Tim18p does not cofractionate with the TIM23 complex upon 
immunoprecipitation or nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Deletion of Tim18p 
decreases the growth rate of yeast cells by a factor of two and is synthetically 
lethal with temperature-sensitive mutations in Tim9p or Tim10p. It also impairs 
the import of several precursor proteins into isolated mitochondria, and lowers 
the apparent mass of the TIM22 complex. We suggest that Tim18p functions in the 
assembly and stabilization of the TIM22 complex but does not directly 
participate in protein insertion into the inner membrane.
