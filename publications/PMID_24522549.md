Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative movement 
disorder; however, its etiology remains elusive. Nevertheless, in vivo 
observations have concluded that oxidative stress is one of the most common 
causes in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. It is known that mitochondria 
play a crucial role in reactive oxygen species-mediated pathways, and several 
gene products that associate with mitochondrial function are the subject of 
Parkinson's disease research. The PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) protects cells 
from mitochondrial dysfunction and is linked to the autosomal recessive familial 
form of the disease. PINK1 is a key player in many signaling pathways engaged in 
mitophagy, apoptosis, or microglial inflammatory response and is induced by 
oxidative stress. Several proteins participate in mitochondrial networks, and 
they are associated with PINK1. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, the protease 
presenilin-associated rhomboid-like serine protease, the tyrosine kinase c-Abl, 
the protein kinase MARK2, the protease HtrA2, and the tumor necrosis factor 
receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) provide different steps of control in 
protection against oxidative stress. Furthermore, environmental toxins, such as 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, have been identified as 
contributors to parkinsonism by increasing oxidative stress in dopaminergic 
neurons. The present review discusses the mechanisms and effects of oxidative 
stress, the emerging concept of the impact of environmental toxins, and a 
possible neuroprotective role of the antioxidant astaxanthin in various 
neurodegenerative disorders with particular emphasis in Parkinson's disease.
