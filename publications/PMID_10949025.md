Bcl-x(L), an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, is postulated to function at 
multiple stages in the cell death pathway. The possibility that Bcl-x(L) 
inhibits cell death at a late (postmitochondrial) step in the death pathway is 
supported by this report of a novel apoptosis inhibitor, Aven, which binds to 
both Bcl-x(L) and the caspase regulator, Apaf-1. Identified in a yeast 
two-hybrid screen, Aven is broadly expressed and is conserved in other mammalian 
species. Only those mutants of Bcl-x(L)that retain their antiapoptotic activity 
are capable of binding Aven. Aven interferes with the ability of Apaf-1 to 
self-associate, suggesting that Aven impairs Apaf-1-mediated activation of 
caspases. Consistent with this idea, Aven inhibited the proteolytic activation 
of caspases in a cell-free extract and suppressed apoptosis induced by Apaf-1 
plus caspase-9. Thus, Aven represents a new class of cell death regulator.
