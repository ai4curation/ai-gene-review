Protein synthesis in all cells is carried out by macromolecular machines called 
ribosomes. Although the structures of prokaryotic, yeast and protist ribosomes 
have been determined, the more complex molecular architecture of metazoan 80S 
ribosomes has so far remained elusive. Here we present structures of Drosophila 
melanogaster and Homo sapiens 80S ribosomes in complex with the translation 
factor eEF2, E-site transfer RNA and Stm1-like proteins, based on 
high-resolution cryo-electron-microscopy density maps. These structures not only 
illustrate the co-evolution of metazoan-specific ribosomal RNA with ribosomal 
proteins but also reveal the presence of two additional structural layers in 
metazoan ribosomes, a well-ordered inner layer covered by a flexible RNA outer 
layer. The human and Drosophila ribosome structures will provide the basis for 
more detailed structural, biochemical and genetic experiments.
