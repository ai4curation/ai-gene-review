Arabidopsis thaliana contains 18 genes encoding Hsp70s. This heat shock protein 
superfamily is divided into two sub-families: DnaK and Hsp110/SSE. In order to 
functionally characterize members of the Hsp70 superfamily, loss-of-function 
mutants with reduced cytosolic Hsp70 expression were studied. AtHsp70-1 and 
AtHsp70-2 are constitutively expressed and represent the major cytosolic Hsp70 
isoforms under ambient conditions. Analysis of single and double mutants did not 
reveal any difference compared to wild-type controls. In yeast, SSE protein has 
been shown to act as a nucleotide exchange factor, essential for Hsp70 function. 
To test whether members of the Hsp110/SSE sub-family serve essential functions 
in plants, two members of the sub-family, AtHsp70-14 and AtHsp70-15, were 
analysed. Both genes are highly homologous and constitutively expressed. 
Deficiency of AtHsp70-15 but not of AtHsp70-14 led to severe growth retardation. 
AtHsp70-15-deficient plants were smaller than wild-type and exhibited a slightly 
different leaf shape. Stomatal closure under ambient conditions and in response 
to ABA was impaired in the AtHsp70-15 transgenic plants, but ABA-dependent 
inhibition of germination was not affected. Heat treatment of 
AtHsp70-15-deficient plants resulted in drastically increased mortality, 
indicating that AtHsp70-15 plays an essential role during normal growth and in 
the heat response of Arabidopsis plants. AtHsp70-15-deficient plants are more 
tolerant to infection by turnip mosaic virus. Comparative transcriptome analysis 
revealed that AtHsp70-15-deficient plants display a constitutive stress response 
similar to the cytosolic protein response. Based on these results, AtHsp70-15 is 
likely to be a key factor in proper folding of cytosolic proteins, and may 
function as nucleotide exchange factor as proposed for yeast.
