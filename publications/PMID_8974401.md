Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades are activated in response to 
various extracellular stimuli, including growth factors and environmental 
stresses. A MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), termed ASK1, was identified that 
activated two different subgroups of MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK), SEK1 (or MKK4) 
and MKK3/MAPKK6 (or MKK6), which in turn activated stress-activated protein 
kinase (SAPK, also known as JNK; c-Jun amino-terminal kinase) and p38 subgroups 
of MAP kinases, respectively. Overexpression of ASK1 induced apoptotic cell 
death, and ASK1 was activated in cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-alpha). Moreover, TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a 
catalytically inactive form of ASK1. ASK1 may be a key element in the mechanism 
of stress- and cytokine-induced apoptosis.
