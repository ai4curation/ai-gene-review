ClC chloride channels are widely distributed in organisms across the 
evolutionary spectrum, and members of the mammalian family play crucial roles in 
cellular function and are mutated in several human diseases (Jentsch, T. J., 
Stein, V., Weinreich, F., and Zdebik, A. A. (2002) Physiol. Rev. 82, 503-568). 
Within the ClC-3, -4, -5 branch of the family that are intracellular channels, 
two alternatively spliced ClC-3 isoforms were recognized recently (Ogura, T., 
Furukawa, T., Toyozaki, T., Yamada, K., Zheng, Y. J., Katayama, Y., Nakaya, H., 
and Inagaki, N. (2002) FASEB J. 16, 863-865). ClC-3A resides in late endosomes 
where it serves as an anion shunt during acidification. We show here that the 
ClC-3B PDZ-binding isoform resides in the Golgi where it co-localizes with a 
small amount of the other known PDZ-binding chloride channel, CFTR (cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Both channel proteins bind the 
Golgi PDZ protein, GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing 
protein). Interestingly, however, when overexpressed, GOPC, which is thought to 
influence traffic in the endocytic/secretory pathway, causes a large reduction 
in the amounts of both channels, probably by leading them to the degradative end 
of this pathway. ClC-3B as well as CFTR also binds EBP50 (ERM-binding 
phosphoprotein 50) and PDZK1, which are concentrated at the plasma membrane. 
However, only PDZK1 was found to promote interaction between the two channels, 
perhaps because they were able to bind to two different PDZ domains in PDZK1. 
Thus while small portions of the populations of ClC-3B and CFTR may associate 
and co-localize, the bulk of the two populations reside in different organelles 
of cells where they are expressed heterologously or endogenously, and therefore 
their cellular functions are likely to be distinct and not primarily related.
