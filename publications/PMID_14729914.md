An extensive analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana peripheral and integral 
thylakoid membrane proteome was performed by sequential extractions with salt, 
detergent, and organic solvents, followed by multidimensional protein separation 
steps (reverse-phase HPLC and one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis gels), 
different enzymatic and nonenzymatic protein cleavage techniques, mass 
spectrometry, and bioinformatics. Altogether, 154 proteins were identified, of 
which 76 (49%) were alpha-helical integral membrane proteins. Twenty-seven new 
proteins without known function but with predicted chloroplast transit peptides 
were identified, of which 17 (63%) are integral membrane proteins. These new 
proteins, likely important in thylakoid biogenesis, include two rubredoxins, a 
potential metallochaperone, and a new DnaJ-like protein. The data were 
integrated with our analysis of the lumenal-enriched proteome. We identified 83 
out of 100 known proteins of the thylakoid localized photosynthetic apparatus, 
including several new paralogues and some 20 proteins involved in protein 
insertion, assembly, folding, or proteolysis. An additional 16 proteins are 
involved in translation, demonstrating that the thylakoid membrane surface is an 
important site for protein synthesis. The high coverage of the photosynthetic 
apparatus and the identification of known hydrophobic proteins with low 
expression levels, such as cpSecE, Ohp1, and Ohp2, indicate an excellent dynamic 
resolution of the analysis. The sequential extraction process proved very 
helpful to validate transmembrane prediction. Our data also were 
cross-correlated to chloroplast subproteome analyses by other laboratories. All 
data are deposited in a new curated plastid proteome database (PPDB) with 
multiple search functions (http://cbsusrv01.tc.cornell.edu/users/ppdb/). This 
PPDB will serve as an expandable resource for the plant community.
