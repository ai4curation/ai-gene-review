Expression of the PTEN tumor suppressor is frequently lost in breast cancer in 
the absence of mutation or promoter methylation through as yet undetermined 
mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate that the Rak tyrosine kinase 
physically interacts with PTEN and phosphorylates PTEN on Tyr336. Knockdown of 
Rak enhanced the binding of PTEN to its E3 ligase NEDD4-1 and promoted PTEN 
polyubiquitination, leading to PTEN protein degradation. Notably, ectopic 
expression of Rak effectively suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation, 
invasion, and colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, 
Rak knockdown was sufficient to transform normal mammary epithelial cells. 
Therefore, Rak acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor gene through the mechanism 
of regulating PTEN protein stability and function.

Introduction

The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10) tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome 10q23 is frequently mutated in a number of tumor lineages, including glioblastoma, melanoma, and carcinomas of prostate, breast, and endometrium ( Li et al., 1997 ; Li and Sun, 1997 ; Steck et al., 1997 ). PTEN antagonizes the actions of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by dephosphorylating the second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5,-trisphosphate ( Cantley and Neel, 1999 ; Di Cristofano and Pandolfi, 2000 ; Maehama et al., 2001 ; Wishart and Dixon, 2002 ), regulating activation of the kinase Akt as well as the downstream cellular survival and growth responses ( Bellacosa et al., 1991 ; Chang et al., 1997 ; Jimenez et al., 1998 ; Staal, 1987 ). PTEN has phosphatase, C2, and PDZ-binding domains as well as potential sites of regulation by phosphorylation, including tyrosine phosphorylation, which may contribute to its ability to modulate cell growth and viability.

In addition to gene deletion or mutation, emerging evidence shows that complete or partial loss of PTEN protein expression can impact tumor suppression ( Salmena et al., 2008 ). Indeed, PTEN protein levels are reduced in at least 50% of breast cancer though gene mutations are rare ( Hennessy et al, 2005 , Brugge et al., 2007 , Stemke-Hale et al 2008 ). The epigenetic regulation of PTEN expression has been attributed to transcriptional regulation, microRNA and/or alteration of PTEN protein stability ( Salmena et al, 2008 ). The disruption of PTEN protein stability represents a particularly attractive yet elusive mechanism contributing to its loss in human cancer. Numerous reports have suggested that PTEN stability is regulated by interaction with other proteins and that it is subject to post-translational modification, particularly phosphorylation ( Salmena et al., 2008 ). To better understand the regulation of PTEN phosphorylation, stability and function, we used a proteomics-based approach to systematically identify PTEN-binding proteins.

Rak is a 54-kDa tyrosine kinase that belongs to a family of Src kinases ( Anneren et al., 2003 ; Cance et al., 1994 ; Serfas and Tyner, 2003 ). Like all members of the Src kinase family, the Rak kinase possesses an SH domain as well as conserved autoregulatory tyrosine residues in its catalytic domain ( Anneren et al., 2003 ; Cance et al., 1994 ; Serfas and Tyner, 2003 ). However, Rak differs significantly from the other family members in many structural features, including the presence of a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal and the lack of a consensus myristoylation motif ( Anneren et al., 2003 ; Serfas and Tyner, 2003 ). In fact, Rak has been shown to be a nuclear protein with growth-inhibitory effects when ectopically expressed in breast cancer cells ( Meyer et al., 2003 ). Notably, the Rak gene is located on chromosome 6q21-23, a region that undergoes loss of heterozygosity in 30% of breast cancer cases ( Sheng et al., 1996 ). However, the mechanisms by which Rak and its substrates function in cancer have remained unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated the functional interaction between Rak and PTEN, and provided mechanistic evidence supporting Rak functions as a bona fide breast tumor suppressor gene.

Discussion

Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated PTEN mutations frequently leads to loss of PTEN protein with at least 20% of the cases demonstrating high mRNA levels indicative of rapid degradation of mutant PTEN protein in cells ( Georgescu et al., 1999 ). In fact, PTEN tyrosine mutants, with an associated loss of PTEN protein and tumor suppressor activity, have been detected in many types of cancer. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate PTEN protein stability and whether the molecules regulating PTEN stability also function as tumor suppressor genes in human cancer. In this study, we have found that expression of Rak, a PTEN-interacting protein, strongly correlated with PTEN protein levels in breast cancer tissues, and we demonstrated that Rak positively regulates PTEN protein stability through phosphorylation of PTEN on Tyr 336, which in turn prevents PTEN from ubiquitination and degradation.

Recent studies have shown that PTEN protein stability is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation through the E3 ligase NEDD4-1. As with PTEN stability, the mechanisms regulating NEDD4-1 and PTEN association have not been fully elucidated. Since Rak enhances PTEN stability, we suspected that phosphorylation of NEDD4-1 or PTEN by Rak might disrupt the interaction between these two molecules and, in turn, stabilize PTEN protein. In our studies, we found that Rak efficiently phosphorylates PTEN on Tyr 336 but has no detectable kinase activity toward NEDD4-1 (data not presented). Notably, Rak depletion increased the interaction between NEDD4-1 and PTEN, suggesting that phosphorylation of PTEN by Rak may inhibit PTEN binding to NEDD4-1 and subsequent PTEN degradation. Indeed negative regulation of the binding between E3 ligase and substrate as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation has previously been reported. For example, Fyn was shown to phosphorylate the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch and reduce its binding to and degradation of its substrate JunB ( Yang et al., 2006 ). Notably, Fyn and Rak belong to the same kinase family, and Itch is a HECT-type E3 ligase, just like NEDD4-1. Thus the regulatory mechanisms are similar except that Rak phosphorylates the substrate whereas Fyn phosphorylates the E3 ligase. It is tempting to speculate that tyrosine phosphorylation may be a common mechanism for regulation of protein stability, in which tyrosine kinases protect substrates from HECT-mediated degradation. This mechanism is in contrast to the one where serine/threonine kinases promote F-Box-containing E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination and protein degradation.

In addition to uncovering a mechanism that regulates PTEN protein stability, as illustrated in Figure 6 , our studies also identified Rak as having the potential to act as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer. Rak is located a region that undergoes loss of heterozygosity in 30% of breast cancer cases. However, the role of Rak in breast cancer development is far from clear. Although we identified PTEN as an important substrate for Rak and one that may play crucial role in Rak’s tumor suppressor function, we cannot rule out the possibility that Rak may also suppress tumor growth through PTEN-independent pathway. PTEN has been reported to play fundamental roles in the maintenance of chromosomal stability as well as stem cell biology. Thus, we speculate that Rak may also participate in these two important biological functions. In fact, our preliminary studies implicate Rak in preventing spontaneous DNA damage (data not shown). Thus we will determine how Rak regulates genomic integrity and whether Rak is involved in “stemness” of cells in future studies.
