Renal development in bcl-2-deficient mice was monitored to examine the temporal 
and spatial function of this gene during nephrogenesis in vivo. Extensive 
apoptosis occurred during abnormal nephrogenesis in bcl-2-deficient mice. In 
embryos and newborn mice, the sequence of morphological events was monitored by 
morphology in conjunction with morphometry, and bcl-2 -/-, bcl-2 +/-, and bcl-2 
+/+ mice were compared. In bcl-2 -/- mice, initial induction of nephrons was 
detected by embryonic day 13 (E-13) as normal. Then, apoptotic cells became five 
times more frequent at E-13 to E-16 with a significant reduction (1/5) in 
nephron number at E-17 to E-19 in bcl-2 -/- mice compared with bcl-2 +/+ mice. 
No morphological difference was evident between bcl-2 +/- mice and bcl-2 +/+ 
mice by morphometry. Apoptotic cells were found mainly among the mesenchyme and 
less frequently in tubuli. Little apoptosis among ureteric buds was noted. In 
bcl-2 -/- mice at E-17 to E-19, inactive branching and insufficient convolution 
of ureteric buds were accompanied by fulminant apoptosis in the mesenchyme. 
Neonatal bcl-2 -/- mice lacked the nephrogenic zone, exhibiting renal 
hypoplasia. Thus, bcl-2 seems to inhibit apoptosis in renal stem cells during 
the induction of nephrons in vivo.
