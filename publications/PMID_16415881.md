Human SET7/9 is a protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT) that methylates 
histone H3, the tumor suppressor p53 and the TBP-associated factor TAF10. To 
elucidate the determinants of its substrate specificity, we have solved the 
enzyme's structure bound to a TAF10 peptide and examined its ability to 
methylate histone H3, TAF10 and p53 substrates bearing either mutations or 
covalent modifications within their respective methylation sites. Collectively, 
our data reveal that SET7/9 recognizes a conserved K/R-S/T/A motif preceding the 
lysine substrate and has a propensity to bind aspartates and asparagines on the 
C-terminal side of the lysine target. We then used a sequence-based approach 
with this motif to identify novel substrates for this PKMT. Among the putative 
targets is TAF7, which is methylated at Lys5 by the enzyme in vitro. These 
results demonstrate the predictive value of the consensus motif in identifying 
novel substrates for SET7/9.
