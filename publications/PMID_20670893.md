SIRT1, a NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase, plays crucial roles in multiple 
biological processes including gene transcription, cellular metabolism, stress 
response, and tumorigenesis. Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) is a core 
nucleotide excision repair (NER) factor essential for NER process. Here we show 
that SIRT1 plays an important role in the regulation of NER pathway. 
Downregulation of SIRT1 significantly sensitizes cells to UV irradiation. SIRT1 
interacts with XPA, and the interaction is enhanced after UV irradiation. XPA 
can be acetylated at lysines 63 and 67. SIRT1 deacetylates XPA both in vitro and 
in cells. Importantly, SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of XPA is required for 
optimal NER pathway since XPA-deficient cells complemented with XPA-K6367Q, 
which mimics hyperacetylated XPA, display significantly higher UV sensitivity 
compared with the XPA cells complemented with wild-type XPA. Furthermore, 
SIRT1-mediated XPA deacetylation enhances its interaction with RPA32. Our 
results demonstrate that SIRT1 regulates NER pathway through modulation of XPA 
acetylation status.
