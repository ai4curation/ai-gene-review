Neurofibromin (Nf1) is an approximately 280 kDa protein having tumor suppressor 
function, presumably by virtue of its GTPase activating domain, but little is 
known regarding molecular aspects of its effector pathways. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) 
regulates diverse signaling molecules and has itself been implicated as a tumor 
suppressor. Here we demonstrate that Nf1 binds to Cav-1's scaffolding domain and 
co-immunoprecipitates with Cav-1. Analysis of Nf1's primary structure reveals 
four potential caveolin binding domains, and interestingly, in individuals with 
neurofibromatosis I, missense mutations occur with high frequency in 3 of the 4 
putative domains. We show that Nf1 modulates ras, Akt, and focal adhesion kinase 
pathways, thereby affecting cytoskeletal organization; moreover, Nf1's effects 
on signaling are altered when lipid rafts and caveolae are disrupted by 
cholesterol depletion. These novel findings provide insight into possible 
signaling mechanisms of Nf1 and suggest that together Nf1 and Cav-1 may 
coordinately regulate cell growth and differentiation.
