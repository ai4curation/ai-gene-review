Eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) participates in the super elongation 
complex (SEC) with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) CTD kinase P-TEFb. SEC is a 
key regulator in the expression of HOX genes in mixed lineage leukemia 
(MLL)-based hematological malignancies, in the control of induced gene 
expression early in development, and in immediate early gene transcription. 
Here, we identify an SEC-like complex in Drosophila, as well as a distinct 
ELL-containing complex that lacks P-TEFb and other components of SEC named the 
"little elongation complex" (LEC). LEC subunits are highly enriched at RNA Pol 
II-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, and the loss of LEC results in 
decreased snRNA expression in both flies and mammals. The specialization of the 
SEC and LEC complexes for mRNA and snRNA-containing genes, respectively, 
suggests the presence of specific classes of elongation factors for each class 
of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II.
