Cellular dedifferentiation, the transition of differentiated somatic cells to 
pluripotent stem cells, ensures developmental plasticity and contributes to 
wound healing in plants. Wounding induces cells to form a mass of unorganized 
pluripotent cells called callus at the wound site. Explanted cells can also form 
callus tissues in vitro. Reversible cellular differentiation-dedifferentiation 
processes in higher eukaryotes are controlled mainly by chromatin modifications. 
We demonstrate that ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 (ATXR2), a histone lysine 
methyltransferase that promotes the accumulation of histone H3 proteins that are 
trimethylated on lysine 36 (H3K36me3) during callus formation, promotes early 
stages of cellular dedifferentiation through activation of LATERAL ORGAN 
BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD) genes. The LBD genes of Arabidopsis thaliana are 
activated during cellular dedifferentiation to enhance the formation of callus. 
Leaf explants from Arabidopsis atxr2 mutants exhibited a reduced ability to form 
callus and a substantial reduction in LBD gene expression. ATXR2 bound to the 
promoters of LBD genes and was required for the deposition of H3K36me3 at these 
promoters. ATXR2 was recruited to LBD promoters by the transcription factors 
AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19. Leaf explants from arf7-1arf19-2 
double mutants were defective in callus formation and showed reduced H3K36me3 
accumulation at LBD promoters. Genetic analysis provided further support that 
ARF7 and ARF19 were required for the ability of ATXR2 to promote the expression 
of LBD genes. These observations indicate that the ATXR2-ARF-LBD axis is key for 
the epigenetic regulation of callus formation in Arabidopsis.
