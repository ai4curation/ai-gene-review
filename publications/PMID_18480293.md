Homer proteins are components of postsynaptic density (PSD) and play a crucial 
role in coupling diverse target molecules. However, the regulatory aspect of 
Homer-mediated coupling has been addressed only about a dominant-negative effect 
of Homer1a, which requires de novo gene expression. Here, we present evidence 
that Homer-mediated coupling is regulated by its phosphorylation state. We found 
that Homer3, the predominant isoform in Purkinje cells, is phosphorylated by 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) both in vitro and in 
vivo. Biochemical fractionation with phosphor-specific antibodies revealed the 
presence of phosphorylated Homer3 in the cytosolic fraction in contrast to high 
levels of nonphosphorylated Homer3 in PSD. In P/Q-type voltage-gated-Ca2+ 
channel knock-out mice, in which CaMKII activation was reduced, the levels of 
Homer3 phosphorylation and the soluble form of Homer 3 were markedly lower. 
Furthermore, both robust phosphorylation of Homer3 and its dissociation from 
metabotropic glutamate receptor 1alpha (mGluR1alpha) were triggered by 
depolarization in primary cultured Purkinje cells, and these events were 
inhibited by CaMKII inhibitor. An in vitro binding kinetic analysis revealed 
that these phosphorylation-dependent events were attributable to a decrease in 
the affinity of phosphorylated Homer3 for its ligand. In a heterologous system, 
the Ca2+ signaling pattern induced by mGluR1alpha activation was modulated by 
the Homer3 phosphorylation state. Together, these findings suggested that Homer3 
in Purkinje cells might function as a reversible coupler regulated by CaMKII 
phosphorylation and that the phosphorylation is capable of regulating the 
postsynaptic molecular architecture in response to synaptic activity.
