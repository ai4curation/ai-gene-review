CDC-48 (also called VCP or p97 in mammals and Cdc48p in yeast) is a AAA (ATPases 
associated with diverse cellular activities) chaperone and participates in a 
wide range of cellular activities including modulation of protein complexes and 
protein aggregates. UFD-2 and UFD-3, C-terminal adaptors for CDC-48, reportedly 
bind to CDC-48 in a mutually exclusive manner and they may modulate the fate of 
substrates for CDC-48. However, their cellular functions have not yet been 
elucidated. In this study, we found that CDC-48 preferentially interacts with 
UFD-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans. We also found that the number of polyglutamine 
(polyQ) aggregates was reduced in the ufd-3 deletion mutant but not in the ufd-2 
deletion mutant. Furthermore, the lifespan and motility of the ufd-3 deletion 
mutant, where polyQ40::GFP was expressed, were greatly decreased. Taken 
together, we propose that UFD-3 may promote the formation of polyQ aggregates to 
reduce the polyQ toxicity in C. elegans.
