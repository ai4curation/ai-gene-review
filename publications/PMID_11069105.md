BACKGROUND: The role of protein phosphorylation in the Pasteur effect--the 
phenomenon whereby anaerobic conditions stimulate glycolysis--has not been 
addressed. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated when the oxygen 
supply is restricted. AMPK acts as an energy-state sensor and inhibits key 
biosynthetic pathways, thus conserving ATP. Here, we studied whether AMPK is 
involved in the Pasteur effect in the heart by phosphorylating and activating 
6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a potent stimulator of glycolysis.
RESULTS: Heart PFK-2 was phosphorylated on Ser466 and activated by AMPK in 
vitro. In perfused rat hearts, anaerobic conditions or inhibitors of oxidative 
phosphorylation (oligomycin and antimycin) induced AMPK activation, which 
correlated with PFK-2 activation and with an increase in fructose 
2,6-bisphosphate concentration. Moreover, in cultured cells transfected with 
heart PFK-2, oligomycin treatment resulted in a parallel activation of 
endogenous AMPK and PFK-2. In these cells, the activation of PFK-2 was due to 
the phosphorylation of Ser466. A dominant-negative construct of AMPK abolished 
the activation of endogenous and cotransfected AMPK, and prevented both the 
activation and phosphorylation of transfected PFK-2 by oligomycin.
CONCLUSIONS: AMPK phosphorylates and activates heart PFK-2 in vitro and in 
intact cells. AMPK-mediated PFK-2 activation is likely to be involved in the 
stimulation of heart glycolysis during ischaemia.
