Endorepellin, a processed fragment of perlecan protein core, possesses 
anti-angiogenic activity by antagonizing endothelial cells. Endorepellin 
contains three laminin G-like (LG) domains and binds simultaneously to vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and α2β1 integrin, resulting in 
dual receptor antagonism. Treatment of endothelial cells with endorepellin 
inhibits transcription of VEGFA, the natural ligand for VEGFR2, attenuating the 
pro-survival and migratory activities of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling cascade. Here, 
we investigated the specific binding site of endorepellin within the ectodomain 
of VEGFR2. Full-length endorepellin was not capable of displacing VEGFA binding 
from VEGFR2 and LG3 domain alone did not bind VEGFR2. This suggested different 
binding mechanisms of the extracellular Ig domains of VEGFR2. Therefore, we 
hypothesized that endorepellin would bind through its proximal LG1/2 domains to 
VEGFR2 in a different region than VEGFA. Indeed, we found that LG1/2 did not 
bind Ig1-3, but did bind with high affinity to Ig3-5, distal to the known VEGFA 
binding site, i.e. Ig2-3. These results support a role for endorepellin as an 
allosteric inhibitor of VEGFR2. Moreover, we found that LG1/2 blocked the rapid 
VEGFA activation of VEGFR2 at Tyr1175 in endothelial cells. In contrast, LG1/2 
did not result in actin cytoskeletal disassembly in endothelial cells whereas 
LG3 alone did induce cytoskeletal collapse. However, LG1/2 did inhibit 
VEGFA-dependent endothelial migration through fibrillar collagen I. These 
studies provide a mechanistic understanding of how the different LG domains of 
endorepellin signal in endothelial cells while serving as a template for protein 
design of receptor tyrosine kinase antagonists.

Introduction

Angiogenesis, or the proliferation of new networks of blood vessels, is an essential process for tumor development and for over 40 years has been considered a target for cancer therapy [ 1 ]. In addition to playing an essential role in development, neovascularization allows solid tumors to receive oxygen and essential nutrients while removing waste products to promote tumor progression. Once the “angiogenic switch” is turned on tumor invasion and metastasis are not far behind, ultimately resulting in poor clinical outcomes [ 2 ].

The soluble cytokine mainly responsible for the signaling of growth and survival of blood vessels is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) together with its main transcriptional controller hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). During abnormal vascular remodeling, the tumor microenvironment experiences hypoxia which stabilizes HIF-1α levels to promote VEGFA expression [ 3 ]. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) is the main signaling receptor for VEGFA ligand which binds between the extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains 2 and 3 [ 4 ]. The resulting signaling cascade following dimerization of this receptor tyrosine kinase includes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, actin remodeling and vascular permeability [ 5 ]. The tumor microenvironment consisting of these recruited stromal cells that line the blood vessels in addition to the neoplastic cells, make the pro-growth feedback loop a viable therapeutic target [ 6 ].

Several approaches have been taken to block this pathway including neutralizing VEGFA and VEGFR2. In spite of promising results showing anti-angiogenic capabilities in mice, agents targeting VEGFA or VEGFR2 in humans have not been as impressive [ 7 ]. Despite initial regressions in tumor size and neovascularization, the blockade of VEGF eventually overcomes the treatment resulting in tumor progression marked by the remodeling of blood vessels [ 8 ]. One explanation is the observation that following VEGF blockade, tumors begin abnormal accumulation of perlecan among other basement membrane proteins [ 9 ].

Perlecan is a ubiquitous, modular heparan-sulfate proteoglycan which has also been directly implicated in regulating endothelial cell adhesion [ 10 ], chondrogenesis [ 11 ], vascular injury and remodeling [ 12 - 15 ], lipid metabolism and fibrosis [ 16 , 17 ], corneal and epidermal structure [ 18 , 19 ], and developmental and tumor angiogenesis {1563, 901, 2647, 3829, 3971, 4483, 4619, 4642}. Indeed, proteoglycans have been associated with cancer biology for over 50 years based on their deregulated expression in various types of cancer [ 28 - 31 ], their propensity to act as depot for cytokines and growth factor, and their ability to present cytokine/growth factor complexes to their cognate receptors in a bioactive form [ 32 - 37 ]. The significance of perlecan regulating the angiogenic switch results from its opposing terminal angiogenic activities [ 38 ]. On one end, the N-terminus, which includes three heparan sulfate chains, is responsible for harboring a number of angiogenic growth factors within the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, including FGF2, FGF18, progranulin and VEGFA, in close proximity to their functional receptors [ 36 , 39 - 41 ]. Furthermore, 15-fold increases in perlecan mRNA have been observed in melanomas [ 42 ], consistent with the overabundance of this proangiogenic proteoglycan in the matrix of tumor cells [ 43 ]. In contrast, at its C-terminus, perlecan is proteolytically processed by BMP-1 [ 44 ] and cathepsin L [ 45 ]. The latter enzymatic processing liberates a bioactive angiostatic fragment named endorepellin to designate its intrinsic repulsive activity against endothelial cells [ 46 ]. Endorepellin is among a class of liberated C-terminal fragments derived from parental extracellular matrix proteins that along with other angioinhibitors such as arresten, canstatin, endostatin and tumstatin, bind to integrin receptors to regulate intracellular pathways of endothelial and tumor cells [ 47 ]. Endorepellin contains 3 laminin-G (LG) domains for which LG3 has been well studied and known to act in a dominant negative fashion to endothelial cells, similar to full length endorepellin [ 48 ]. Notably, LG3 has an anti-apoptotic effect on fibroblasts [ 49 ], suggesting that its activity might be cell-specific .

Previously, we have shown that much of endorepellin's angiostatic activity exists through binding to α2β1 integrin {2221, 2990, 2991, 3829} a key receptor involved in angiogenesis [ 53 - 55 ]. The interaction between endorepellin and the α2β1 integrin leads to a signaling cascade that induces collapse of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which in turn inactivates several receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR2 [ 56 ]. More recently we have put forward a new concept of dual receptor antagonism in which endorepellin interacts with both VEGFR2 and α2β1 in microvascular and macrovascular endothelial cells [ 57 ]. This mechanism of VEGFR2 antagonism extends to direct extracellular receptor binding resulting in transcriptional repression of HIF-1α and VEGFA along with inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T-cells-1 (NFAT1) activation [ 58 ].

In the present study, we show the distinct domains of endorepellin that specifically engage VEGFR2 as well as the differential mechanisms of anti-angiogenic activity for the two bioactive fragments LG1/2 and LG3. These results further support the emerging theme of dual receptor antagonism as a therapeutically viable mechanism for blocking receptor cross-talk [ 57 , 59 ].

Discussion

The localization and large modular nature of perlecan within basement membranes underlying epithelial and endothelial cells makes this proteoglycan a regulator of key biological processes within the tumor microenvironment. Five distinct domains exist within perlecan and the importance of this molecule is highlighted by the ubiquitous extracellular matrix expression across tissue and cell types [ 65 - 67 ] as well as genetic studies showing death during the 10-12 day embryonic stage due to cardiac tamponade and cardiovascular defects [ 68 , 69 ]. The C-terminal module endorepellin also allows for cell surface targeting of the parent proteoglycan due to high affinity interactions with the α2β1 integrin receptor [ 47 ] and VEGFR2 [ 57 ]. We recently discovered that perlecan knockdown causes a paradoxical increase and distribution of VEGFA in zebrafish and that the perlecan morphants could be partially rescued by microinjections of VEGFA [ 24 ]. Consistent with these findings, combined administration of perlecan and VEGFA to HUVECs enhances VEGFR2 phosphorylation at Tyr951 [ 24 ]. Similarly, a soluble form of perlecan domain I harboring HS chains enhances VEGFA activity on VEGFR2 Tyr951 [ 70 ]. Collectively, these results support a dual role for perlecan as a regulator of “proper” VEGFA targeting to endothelial cells and as a central mediator of signaling through VEGFR2. We have formulated a hypothesis in which the anti-angiogenic therapeutical potential of endorepellin derives from the “dual receptor antagonism” exhibited through intracellular endothelial cell signaling [ 58 ] and rapid receptor internalization and degradation upon treatment [ 57 ]. Important for specific targeting of endorepellin is the fact that endothelial cells are the only cell types to express these two receptors, while cross talk between integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases is a key step in angiogenesis through controlling cell migration and proliferation [ 71 ]. The proof-of-principle for our novel concept of dual receptor antagonism has been recently provided by a study which has developed a single chain VEGF (scVEGF) mutant that acts as dual-specific antagonist for both VEGFR2 and α V β3 integrin [ 59 ]. This dual scVEGF mutant concurrently binds to both receptors with antibody-like affinity, similar to endorepellin binding affinity in low nanomolar range. Importantly, when compared to monospecific scVEGF, the dual-specific scVEGF more efficiently inhibits VEGF-mediated receptor phosphorylation, capillary tube formation and in vivo angiogenesis [ 59 ]. These data provide robust support to the hypothesis that recombinant proteins with dual affinity for VEGFR2 and an angiogenic integrin receptor could be biologically active similar to a portion of perlecan that has evolved for over 500 million years.

Endorepellin also activates the Tyr phosphatase SHP-1 by enhancing its recruitment to the intracellular domain of the α2β1 integrin [ 56 ]. SHP-1 then dephosphorylates several receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR2, thereby blocking pro-angiogenic endothelial cell signaling through migratory, survival and proliferative pathways. This dual receptor interaction leads to a rapid recruitment of these receptors and to their internalization and degradation, which together with the deactivation of VEGFR2 by SHP-1, cause transcriptional repression of VEGFA gene and attenuation of VEGFA protein production and secretion [ 57 , 58 ]. The repression of VEGFA transcription would further contribute to the overall anti-angiogenic activity of endorepellin through inhibition of the positive feedback loop within the tumor stroma. The signaling mechanisms associated with anti-angiogenic activity by the LG domains of endorepellin are summarized in Figure 6 . Notably, TIMP-2, another angiostatic protein [ 72 ], attenuates VEGFA-evoked activation of VEGFR2 [ 73 ] and activates SHP-1 [ 74 ], all properties shared by endorepellin/LG1/2.

The mechanism of VEGFA activation of VEGFR2 has been well studied and through mutational analysis, the second and third Ig domain were identified [ 5 ]. Furthermore, electron microscopy has confirmed that VEGFA induces VEGFR2 dimerization through the membrane-proximal Ig domain 7 [ 4 ]. The present work extends previous findings showing the biological relationship between endorepellin and the VEGFA/VEGFR2 axis [ 24 , 75 ]. By creating fusion constructs containing different regions of the Ig domains of VEGFR2, we were able to show endorepellin binds to a different region, more distal than the endogenous pro-angiogenic signaling ligand VEGFA. In particular, it is the LG1/2 region that shows the specificity of binding Ig domains 3 to 5. The LG1/2 region of endorepellin has not been studied in as much detail as the angiostatic fragment LG3 and here we define a novel binding mechanism for this region. Important to note is the measured low nanomolar affinity LG1/2 compared to the low picomolar binding of VEGFA [ 5 ]; thus, LG1/2 should not physiologically compete for VEGFR2 ectodomain binding. Interesting to also consider for future studies, the LG2 module has been shown to bind to endostatin [ 46 ], another C-terminal angiostatic fragment processed from the parental proteoglycan collagen XVIII. In addition, endostatin binds to VEGFR2 [ 76 ] while the anti-angiogenic activity of endorepellin and endostatin is neutralized in the presence of each other [ 46 ]. Therefore it will be important to compare the circulating concentrations during normal versus disease states of these two fragments to assess their potential bioactivity.

As mentioned above, blockade of Tyr1175 phosphorylation induction of VEGFR2 has been shown to result from endorepellin evoking an increase in SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity [ 56 ]. Here we present a second layer of Tyr1175 regulation as we show LG1/2 is a potent inhibitor of VEGFA activation to mediate downstream signaling pathways. Tyr1175 is a key regulator of VEGFR2 signaling and is essential for proper vasculogenesis [ 77 ]. Phosphorylation of this key Tyr residue regulates a number of downstream activities by mediating the binding of adaptor proteins such as SHB (SH2-domain containing adapter protein), Sck [SHC (Src homology and collagen homology)-related adaptor protein], SHC and GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) [ 64 , 78 ]. Thus, intervention with LG1/2 could represent an endogenous biologic to block these pathways with less potential to initiate an immune response.

In our study we have been able to dissociate the bioactivity of endorepellin and its two main fragments on VEGFR2 and α2β1 integrin. Indeed LG1/2 was able to inhibit VEGFA-evoked endothelial cell migration through fibrillar collagen I, which resembles the provisional matrix formed during in vivo endothelial cell sprouting [ 43 ]. In contrast, LG1/2 was not able to induce dissolution of actin cytoskeleton, a property that was specifically mediated by the interaction of LG3 with α2β1 integrin. The specificity of the different LG domains for their functional receptors is shown in Figure 6 with the downstream signaling cascades ultimately converging on anti-angiogenesis thus highlighting the role of endorepellin as a dual receptor antagonist for endothelial cells.

In conclusion, in our current working model we propose that endorepellin would act as an allosteric inhibitor of VEGFR2 by binding to a region distal to Ig2-3 where VEGFA engages VEGFR2 [ 79 ]. We demonstrate here that this binding occurs via the two proximal LG1/2 domains, whereas LG3 would bind to the α2β1 integrin. We provide a new paradigm for anti-angiogenic fragments derived from large precursors, that is a “dual receptor” antagonism. We predict that a similar bioactivity could be operational for other processed forms of angiostatic matrix molecules acting as intrinsic microenvironmental barriers to tumorigenesis [ 80 ]. Indeed, powerful anti-angiogenic proteins such as thrombospondin-1 and endostatin bind both VEGFR2 and at least one integrin [ 76 , 81 , 82 ]. Thus, the paradigm of “dual receptor antagonism” may be the future framework for novel cancer therapeutics to maximize angiostatic potency.
