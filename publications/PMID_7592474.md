The DNA sequence for a 4.4-kb HindIII-XhoI Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 DNA 
fragment that is known to contain three genes (mxaAKL) involved in incorporation 
of calcium into methanol dehydrogenase (I. W. Richardson and C. Anthony, 
Biochem. J. 287:709-7115, 1992) was determined. Five complete open reading 
frames and two partial open reading frames were found, suggesting that this 
region contains previously unidentified genes. A combination of sequence 
analysis, mutant complementation data, and gene expression studies showed that 
these genes correspond to mxaSACKLDorf1. Of the three previously unidentified 
genes (mxaC, mxaD, and orf1), mutant complementation studies showed that mxaC is 
required for methanol oxidation, while the function of the other two genes is 
still unknown.
