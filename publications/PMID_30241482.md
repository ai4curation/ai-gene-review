BACKGROUND: Conotruncal heart defect (CTD) is a complex congenital heart disease 
with a complex and poorly understood etiology. The transcriptional corepressor 
RIPPLY3 plays a pivotal role in heart development as a negative regulator of the 
key cardiac transcription factor TBX1. A previous study showed that RIPPLY3 
contribute to cardiac outflow tract development in mice, however, the 
relationship between RIPPLY3 and human cardiac malformation has not been 
reported.
METHODS: 615 unrelated CTD Chinese Han patients were enrolled, we excluded the 
22q11.2 deletion/duplication using a modified multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
amplification method-CNVplex®, and investigated the variants of RIPPLY3 in 577 
patients without the 22q11.2 deletion/duplication by target sequencing. 
Functional assays were performed to testify the potential pathogenicity of 
nonsynonymous variants found in these CTD patients.
RESULTS: Four rare heterozygous nonsynonymous variants (p.P30L, p.T52S, p.D113N 
and p.V179D) were identified in four CTD patients, the variant 
NM_018962.2:c.155C>G (p.T52S) is referred as rs745539198, and the variant 
NM_018962.2:c.337G>A (p.D113N) is referred as rs747419773. However, variants 
p.P30L and p.V179D were not found in multiple online human gene variation 
databases. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence showed that there were 
no significant difference between wild type RIPPLY3 and these four variants. 
Luciferase assays revealed that the p.T52S variant altered the inhibition of 
TBX1 transcriptional activity in vitro, and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed 
that the p.T52S variant reduced the physical interaction of RIPPLY3 with TBX1. 
In addition to the results from pathogenicity prediction tools and evolutionary 
protein conservation, the p.T52S variant was thought to be a potentially 
deleterious variant.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that deleterious variants in RIPPLY3 
are potential molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of human CTD.
