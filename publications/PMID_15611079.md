Four ErbB receptors and multiple growth factors sharing an epidermal growth 
factor (EGF) motif underlie transmembrane signaling by the ErbB family in 
development and cancer. Unlike other ErbB proteins, ErbB-2 binds no known 
EGF-like ligand. To address the existence of a direct ligand for ErbB-2, we 
applied algorithms based on genomic and cDNA structures to search sequence data 
bases. These searches reidentified all known EGF-like growth factors including 
Epigen (EPG), the least characterized ligand, but failed to identify novel 
factors. The precursor of EPG is a widely expressed transmembrane glycoprotein 
that undergoes cleavage at two sites to release a soluble EGF-like domain. A 
recombinant EPG cannot stimulate cells singly expressing ErbB-2, but it acts as 
a mitogen for cells expressing ErbB-1 and co-expressing ErbB-2 in combination 
with the other ErbBs. Interestingly, soluble EPG is more mitogenic than EGF, 
although its binding affinity is 100-fold lower. Our results attribute the 
anomalous mitogenic power of EPG to evasion of receptor-mediated depletion of 
ligand molecules, as well as to inefficient receptor ubiquitylation and 
down-regulation. In conclusion, EPG might represent the last EGF-like growth 
factor and define a category of low affinity ligands, whose bioactivity differs 
from the more extensively studied high affinity ligands.
