Nef is an accessory protein of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV 
and SIV) that is required for efficient viral infectivity and pathogenicity. It 
decreases the expression of CD4 on the surface of infected cells. V1H is the 
regulatory subunit H of the vacuolar membrane ATPase (V-ATPase). Previously, the 
interaction between Nef and V1H has been found to facilitate the internalization 
of CD4, suggesting that V1H could connect Nef to the endocytic machinery. In 
this study, we demonstrate that V1H binds to the C-terminal flexible loop in Nef 
from HIV-1 and to the medium chain (mu2) of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) 
in vitro and in vivo. The interaction sites of V1H and mu2 were mapped to a 
central region in V1H from positions 133 to 363, which contains 4 armadillo 
repeats, and to the N-terminal adaptin-binding domain in mu2 from positions 1 to 
145. Fusing Nef to V1H reproduced the appropriate trafficking of Nef. This 
chimera internalized CD4 even in the absence of the C-terminal flexible loop in 
Nef. Finally, blocking the expression of V1H decreased the enhancement of virion 
infectivity by Nef. Thus, V1H can function as an adaptor for interactions 
between Nef and AP-2.
