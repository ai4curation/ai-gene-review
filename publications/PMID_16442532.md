Previous reports have shown that metallothionein (MT) may modulate p53 activity 
through zinc exchange. However, little is known on a direct interaction between 
MT and p53 in cells. The results demonstrate an interaction between MT and p53 
can occur in vitro. The complex between MT and p53 was observed in breast cancer 
epithelial cells with both wild and inactive type of p53. Furthermore, it was 
shown that wt-p53 was preferentially associated with Apo-MT. Our data suggest 
that co-expression of MT and p53 and their complex formation in tumor cells may 
be involved in regulation of apoptosis in these cells.
