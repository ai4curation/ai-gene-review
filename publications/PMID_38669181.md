The DNA sliding clamp PCNA is a multipurpose platform for DNA polymerases and 
many other proteins involved in DNA metabolism. The topologically closed PCNA 
ring needs to be cracked open and loaded onto DNA by a clamp loader, e.g., the 
well-studied pentameric ATPase complex RFC (RFC1-5). The CTF18-RFC complex is an 
alternative clamp loader found recently to bind the leading strand DNA 
polymerase ε and load PCNA onto leading strand DNA, but its structure and the 
loading mechanism have been unknown. By cryo-EM analysis of in vitro assembled 
human CTF18-RFC-DNA-PCNA complex, we have captured seven loading intermediates, 
revealing a detailed PCNA loading mechanism onto a 3'-ss/dsDNA junction by 
CTF18-RFC. Interestingly, the alternative loader has evolved a highly mobile 
CTF18 AAA+ module likely to lower the loading activity, perhaps to avoid 
competition with the RFC and to limit its role to leading strand clamp loading. 
To compensate for the lost stability due to the mobile AAA+ module, CTF18 has 
evolved a unique β-hairpin motif that reaches across RFC2 to interact with RFC5, 
thereby stabilizing the pentameric complex. Further, we found that CTF18 also 
contains a separation pin to locally melt DNA from the 3'-end of the primer; 
this ensures its ability to load PCNA to any 3'-ss/dsDNA junction, facilitated 
by the binding energy of the E-plug to the major groove. Our study reveals 
unique structural features of the human CTF18-RFC and contributes to a broader 
understanding of PCNA loading by the alternative clamp loaders.
