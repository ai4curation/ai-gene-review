Dendritic calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is dynamically 
targeted to the synapse. We show that CaMKIIalpha is associated with the 
CaMKII-binding proteins densin-180, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B 
subunit, and alpha-actinin in postsynaptic density-enriched rat brain fractions. 
Residues 819-894 within the C-terminal domain of alpha-actinin-2 constitute the 
minimal CaMKII-binding domain. Similar amounts of Thr286-autophosphorylated 
CaMKIIalpha holoenzyme [P-T286]CaMKII bind to alpha-actinin-2 as bind to NR2B 
(residues 1260-1339) or to densin-180 (residues 1247-1495) in 
glutathione-agarose cosedimentation assays, even though the CaMKII-binding 
domains share no amino acid sequence similarity. Like NR2B, alpha-actinin-2 
binds to representative splice variants of each CaMKII gene (alpha, beta, gamma, 
and delta), whereas densin-180 binds selectively to CaMKIIalpha. In addition, 
C-terminal truncated CaMKIIalpha monomers can interact with NR2B and 
alpha-actinin-2, but not with densin-180. Soluble alpha-actinin-2 does not 
compete for [P-T286]CaMKII binding to immobilized densin-180 or NR2B. However, 
soluble densin-180, but not soluble NR2B, increases CaMKII binding to 
immobilized alpha-actinin-2 by approximately 10-fold in a PDZ domain-dependent 
manner. A His6-tagged NR2B fragment associates with GST-densin or GST-actinin 
but only in the presence of [P-T286]CaMKII. Similarly, His6-tagged densin-180 or 
alpha-actinin fragments associate with GST-NR2B in a [P-T286]CaMKII-dependent 
manner. In addition, GST-NR2B and His6-tagged alpha-actinin can bind 
simultaneously to monomeric CaMKII subunits. In combination, these data support 
a model in which [P-T286]CaMKIIalpha can simultaneously interact with multiple 
dendritic spine proteins, possibly stabilizing the synaptic localization of 
CaMKII and/or nucleating a multiprotein synaptic signaling complex.
