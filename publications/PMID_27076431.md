The extent to which the skin instructs peripheral somatosensory neuron 
maturation is unknown. We studied this question in Merkel cell-neurite 
complexes, where slowly adapting type I (SAI) neurons innervate skin-derived 
Merkel cells. Transgenic mice lacking Merkel cells had normal dorsal root 
ganglion (DRG) neuron numbers, but fewer DRG neurons expressed the SAI markers 
TrkB, TrkC, and Ret. Merkel cell ablation also decreased downstream TrkB 
signaling in DRGs, and altered the expression of genes associated with SAI 
development and function. Skin- and Merkel cell-specific deletion of Bdnf during 
embryogenesis, but not postnatal Bdnf deletion or Ntf3 deletion, reproduced 
these results. Furthermore, prototypical SAI electrophysiological signatures 
were absent from skin regions where Bdnf was deleted in embryonic Merkel cells. 
We conclude that BDNF produced by Merkel cells during a precise embryonic period 
guides SAI neuron development, providing the first direct evidence that the skin 
instructs sensory neuron molecular and functional maturation.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Peripheral sensory neurons show incredible phenotypic 
and functional diversity that is initiated early by cell-autonomous and local 
environmental factors found within the DRG. However, the contribution of target 
tissues to subsequent sensory neuron development remains unknown. We show that 
Merkel cells are required for the molecular and functional maturation of the SAI 
neurons that innervate them. We also show that this process is controlled by 
BDNF signaling. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of 
somatosensory neuron development and reveal a novel way in which Merkel cells 
participate in mechanosensation.
