X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a key developmental process taking place in 
female mammals to compensate for the imbalance in the dosage of X-chromosomal 
genes between sexes. It is a formidable example of concerted gene regulation and 
a paradigm for epigenetic processes. Although XCI has been substantially 
deciphered in the mouse model, how this process is initiated in humans has long 
remained unexplored. However, recent advances in the experimental capacity to 
access human embryonic-derived material and in the laws governing ethical 
considerations of human embryonic research have allowed us to enlighten this 
black box. Here, we will summarize the current knowledge of human XCI, mainly 
based on the analyses of embryos derived from in vitro fertilization and of 
pluripotent stem cells, and highlight any unanswered questions.
