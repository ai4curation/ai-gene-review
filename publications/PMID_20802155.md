Wnt/β-catenin-dependent activation of lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (Lef-1) plays 
an important role in numerous developmental processes. In this context, 
transcription of the Lef-1 gene is increased by Wnt-mediated TCF4/β-catenin 
activation on the Lef-1 promoter through mechanisms that remain poorly defined. 
In mouse airway submucosal gland progenitor cells, Wnt3A transiently induces 
Lef-1 gene expression, and this process is required for epithelial cell 
proliferation and glandular morphogenesis. In the present study, we sought to 
identify additional candidate transcriptional regulators of the Lef-1 gene 
during glandular morphogenesis. To this end, we found that Sox17 expression is 
dramatically downregulated in early glandular progenitor cells that induce Lef-1 
expression. Wnt stimulation of undifferentiated primary airway epithelial cells 
induced similar changes in Sox17 and Lef-1 expression. Reporter assays revealed 
that ectopic expression of Sox17 suppresses Wnt3A/β-catenin activation of the 
Lef-1 promoter in cell lines. EMSA and ChIP analyses defined several Sox17- and 
TCF4-binding sites that collaborate in transcriptional control of the Lef-1 
promoter. More specifically, Sox17 bound to four sites in the Lef-1 promoter, 
either directly or indirectly through TCF complexes. The DNA- or 
β-catenin-binding domains of Sox17 controlled context-specific binding of 
Sox17/TCF complexes on the Lef-1 promoter. Combinatorial site-directed 
mutagenesis of Sox17- or TCF-binding sites in the Lef-1 promoter demonstrated 
that these sites control Wnt/β-catenin-mediated induction and/or repression. 
These findings demonstrate for the first time that Sox17 can directly regulate 
Wnt/β-catenin-dependent transcription of the Lef-1 promoter and reveal new 
context-dependent binding sites in the Lef-1 promoter that facilitate 
protein-protein interactions between Sox17 and TCF4.

Wnt/β-catenin-dependent activation of lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (Lef-1) plays an important role in numerous developmental processes. In this context, transcription of the Lef-1 gene is increased by Wnt-mediated TCF4/β-catenin activation on the Lef-1 promoter through mechanisms that remain poorly defined. In mouse airway submucosal gland progenitor cells, Wnt3A transiently induces Lef-1 gene expression, and this process is required for epithelial cell proliferation and glandular morphogenesis. In the present study, we sought to identify additional candidate transcriptional regulators of the Lef-1 gene during glandular morphogenesis. To this end, we found that Sox17 expression is dramatically downregulated in early glandular progenitor cells that induce Lef-1 expression. Wnt stimulation of undifferentiated primary airway epithelial cells induced similar changes in Sox17 and Lef-1 expression. Reporter assays revealed that ectopic expression of Sox17 suppresses Wnt3A/β-catenin activation of the Lef-1 promoter in cell lines. EMSA and ChIP analyses defined several Sox17- and TCF4-binding sites that collaborate in transcriptional control of the Lef-1 promoter. More specifically, Sox17 bound to four sites in the Lef-1 promoter, either directly or indirectly through TCF complexes. The DNA- or β-catenin-binding domains of Sox17 controlled context-specific binding of Sox17/TCF complexes on the Lef-1 promoter. Combinatorial site-directed mutagenesis of Sox17- or TCF-binding sites in the Lef-1 promoter demonstrated that these sites control Wnt/β-catenin-mediated induction and/or repression. These findings demonstrate for the first time that Sox17 can directly regulate Wnt/β-catenin-dependent transcription of the Lef-1 promoter and reveal new context-dependent binding sites in the Lef-1 promoter that facilitate protein-protein interactions between Sox17 and TCF4.

DISCUSSION

Canonical Wnt signaling plays roles in numerous developmental programs through β-catenin-dependent transcription factors of the TCF/Lef-1 family. Analysis of a transgenic Lef-1 promoter-driven reporter gene in Wnt3A knockout mice has demonstrated that the promoter is activated by Wnt3A signals in airway submucosal gland progenitor cells ( 10 ). Given that Sox17 expression is inversely regulated with Lef-1 expression in submucosal gland progenitor cells ( Fig. 1 ), Sox17 appeared to be an interesting candidate for regulating the Lef-1 promoter. Sox17 is also known to influence the proliferation and differentiation of airway epithelial cells in mice ( 29 , 36 , 37 ) and also to inhibit Wnt signaling ( 41 , 54 ). Indeed, Wnt stimulation of undifferentiated primary airway epithelial cells led to a dramatic increase in Lef-1 and cyclin D1 protein levels, with a concomitant decrease in the DNA binding form of Sox17 (F-Sox17) ( Fig. 2 ). Given that Lef-1 induces the cyclin D1 promoter ( 40 ) and that glandular airway progenitors fail to express Lef-1 and cyclin D1 in the absence of Wnt3A ( 10 ), these studies support a role for Lef-1 in driving the proliferation of glandular progenitors. However, the increased proliferation of glandular progenitor cells that inhibit Sox17 and induced Lef-1 expression is inconsistent with a previous report demonstrating that overexpression of Sox17 in respiratory epithelial cells of transgenic mice promotes proliferation and differentiation ( 37 ). Thus, Sox17 may be capable of influencing different pathways that can either inhibit or promote proliferation in the proximal and respiratory airway epithelium, respectively. Such differences may be controlled by the context of the Wnt signal and responsiveness of the Lef-1 promoter in a given airway cell type.

Our initial experiments in five cell lines demonstrated that Sox17 inhibits Wnt3A/β-catenin activation of the Lef-1 promoter ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). Several findings supported direct binding of Sox17 to the Lef-1 promoter as the mechanisms for inhibiting Wnt3A/β-catenin-mediated transcription. First, the DNA binding domain of Sox17 was required for its ability to inhibit Wnt3A-mediated activation of the Lef-1 promoter ( Fig. 5 ). Second, ChIP and EMSA analysis demonstrated that three regions in the endogenous Lef-1 promoter bound Sox17 (TLS2, SXS5, and TLS6) ( Fig. 6 B and 7 ). Of significant interest was the finding that the Sox17 BBD is required for efficient binding to SXS5 and TLS6, but not to TLS2. This unexpected finding suggests that the structure of Sox17-bound DNA differs across the Lef-1 promoter. Given that Sox17 associates with TCF4/β-catenin complexes ( Fig. 5 C ) ( 41 ) and that TCF4/β-catenin complexes are in part required for Wnt-mediated activation of the Lef-1 promoter ( 5 , 6 , 30 ), the finding that the Sox17 BBD influences binding to certain sites in the Lef-1 promoter is of significant interest.

The HMG domains of Sox proteins mediate DNA binding in a sequence-specific fashion. Like other Sox proteins, Sox17 imposes a widening of the minor groove of the DNA and bending of ∼80° ( 35 , 47 , 48 ). This feature is uncommon among transcription factors, most of which target mainly the major groove. The differences in DNA binding topology between the Sox proteins and other transcription factors, such as TCFs/Lef-1, make it possible for Sox proteins to bind to DNA in close proximity to other transcription factors ( 47 ). This characteristic of Sox protein/DNA binding has suggested that members of the Sox family of proteins organize the local chromatin structure and assemble associated transcription factors into multiprotein complexes capable of modulating transcription. Our findings on TCF4/Lef-1 and Sox17 binding to Lef-1 promoter sequences support the notion that intermolecular complexes between TCF4/Lef-1, β-catenin, and Sox17 form at certain sites on the promoter ( Fig. 10 ). A perfect example of this is Sox17 binding to SXS5; although TCF4/Lef-1 do not bind this site in isolation, Sox17 binding at SXS5 can lead to the recruitment of TCF4/Lef-1/β-catenin complexes, and this function is dependent on the Sox17 BBD ( Fig. 8 , C and D ). This finding suggests that β-catenin binding to Sox17 may be necessary to form TCF complexes on SXS5. By contrast, TCF4/Lef-1 binding to the TLS3/4 site can recruit Sox17, and this requires the HMG, but not the BBD, domain of Sox17. Whether TCF4/Lef-1 binding at TLS3/4 increases the affinity of Sox17 for one of the two TCF/Sox consensuses at this site, or Sox17 associates with TCF4/Lef-1 through its HMG domain as previously reported ( 41 ), is currently unclear. However, given that purified Sox17 has a low affinity for TLS3/4, either scenario is plausible. Two other sites in the Lef-1 promoter (TLS6 and TLS2) bind to TCF/Lef-1 and/or Sox17 in unusual ways. TLS2 binds primarily to Sox17, and binding at this site does not associate with β-catenin ( Figs. 6 , 7 , 8 C ). By contrast, both Sox17 and TCF4/Lef-1 can associate with TLS6. Thus, Sox17 and TCF4/Lef-1 may compete for occupancy of TLS6. These results suggest that the ratio of bound Sox17 to bound TCF4/Lef-1 in the context of a Wnt/β-catenin signal could dynamically regulate transcription from the Lef-1 promoter.

The process by which multiple and overlapping Sox17/TCF/Lef-1 binding sites in the full-length 2.5-kb Lef-1 promoter coordinate transcription in a Wnt/β-catenin-dependent fashion has been challenging to dissect. However, several themes have emerged from mutagenesis of the promoter. First, in both 293 and A549 cells, simultaneous mutation of all three primary Sox17 binding sites (TLS2/SXS5/TLS6) significantly impaired baseline, as well as Wnt3A/β-catenin-dependent, transcription from the promoter ( Fig. 9 ). This is perhaps not surprising since two of these sites associate with TCF4/Lef-1/β-catenin either directly (TLS6) or indirectly (SXS5) through Sox17 binding. Mutation of Sox17 sites individually (TLS2, SXS5, or TLS6) led to the greatest decline in β-catenin-dependent induction of the promoter in 293 cells without affecting baseline transcription. This finding in 293 cells suggests that Sox17, although capable of repressing β-catenin-dependent Lef-1 transcription, may also be required for the induction of Lef-1 transcription, through interactions with TCF4/Lef-1/β-catenin complexes. In A549 cells, mutation of the SXS5 site completely ablated Wnt3A-mediated induction, and did so by raising baseline activation of the promoter; this effect was less pronounced in the TLS2 and TLS6 mutants. This finding in A549 cells fits our model whereby Sox17 expression in airway epithelia represses transcription from the Lef-1 promoter, and Wnt3A derepresses the promoter at SXS5. However, the finding that the double (SXS5/TLS6) and triple (TLS2/SXS5/TLS6) mutants retained some level of Wnt3A induction in A549 cells suggests that SXS5 does not act in isolation to control Wnt3A-mediated promoter activation.

Of the cell lines evaluated, 293 cells appear to be unique in their ability to induce the Lef-1 promoter when Sox17 alone is overexpressed. Hyperactivation of the TLS2 mutant promoter in the setting of Sox17 overexpression suggests that this site may play a predominantly inhibitory role in the absence of β-catenin, in which case Sox17 occupancy of SXS5 and TLS6 likely predominates ( Fig. 9 B ). Since Sox17-TAD mutant failed to hyperactivate the TLS2 mutant promoter, we hypothesize that the Sox17 BBD is required for activation of the Lef-1 promoter at the SXS5 and TLS6 sites. Such findings are consistent with the fact that the Sox17-TAD mutant binds much less efficiently to these sites than does F-Sox17 ( Fig. 7 D ). However, assigning a strictly inhibitory function to TLS2 is not consistent with the finding that the SXS5/TLS6 mutant retains the ability to activate the Lef-1 promoter in the presence of overexpressed Sox17; in this case, Sox17 occupancy of TLS2 likely predominates. For these reasons, our current hypothesis is that the overall Sox17 occupancy on the Lef-1 promoter controls transcriptional activity, and that context-dependent changes in the formation of Sox17 complexes with TCF4/Lef-1 influences Lef-1 transcription.

The ability of Sox17 to suppress Wnt3A activation of both the Lef-1 and TOP-flash promoters is shared by multiple cell lines. However, given that Sox17 does not directly bind to the TOP-flash promoter, the mechanisms of action underlying this inhibition appear different. Previous studies have demonstrated that one mechanism by which Sox17 inhibits Wnt signaling (as assayed by TOP-flash) is proteasome-mediated degradation of TCF4 ( 41 ). This degradation requires the HMG binding domain of Sox17. Indeed, Sox17-mediated changes in TCF4 levels may be partly responsible for the ability of Sox17 to inhibit Wnt3A/β-catenin-mediated induction of the Lef-1 promoter. However, mutagenesis studies of the Sox17 binding site in the Lef-1 promoter suggest that direct Sox17 binding to the promoter is also involved ( Fig. 9 ); mutation of any of the three major Sox17 binding sites in the Lef-1 promoter (TLS2, SXS5, or TLS6), alone or in combination, prevented repression of Wnt3A-induced promoter activity in the context of Sox17 overexpression in A549 cells ( Fig. 9 C ). These findings suggest that the direct cumulative binding of Sox17 at all three binding sites in the Lef-1 promoter is required for the repression of Wnt3A activation; they cannot be explained by simply a posttranslational mechanism whereby Sox17 mediates the degradation of TCF4/β-catenin, as previously reported in colon cancers ( 41 ). Although we also found direct interactions among Sox17, TCF4, and β-catenin as previously described ( 41 ), we did not observe a dominant effect of Sox17-mediated degradation of TCF4 when these two proteins were coexpressed in cell lines ( Fig. 8 A ). Thus, this function may be cell-type specific. During SMG development, TCF4 is also highly expressed in both the SAE and newly forming glandular buds that induce Lef-1 ( 10 ), despite differences in the level of Sox17 protein expression in these two cellular compartments. Therefore, decreased Sox17 expression during glandular development does not appear to influence the stability of TCF4 protein in glandular progenitor cells.

In summary, the experiments described here demonstrate several novel features of Sox17 and its ability to regulate the Lef-1 promoter ( Fig. 10 ). First, we have shown that Sox17 binds directly to multiple sites in the Lef-1 promoter and controls its transcriptional activity, in both the presence and absence of Wnt/β-catenin signals. Second, we have shown that Sox17/TCF4/Lef-1/β-catenin complexes can be directed to certain sites in the Lef-1 promoter through the Sox17 BBD or HMG domains. Third, we have identified sites within the Lef-1 promoter that can bind to both Sox17 and TCF4/Lef-1, which may control Wnt/β-catenin-dependent transcription in a competitive manner. This work suggests that TCF and Sox proteins may act in concert to finely control transcriptional activation and repression of the Lef-1 promoter response to Wnt signals. Our findings provide important new insights into the duality of context-dependent HMG-transcription factors in the control of gene expression.
