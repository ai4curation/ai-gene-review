Deficiency of human glycerate kinase leads to D-glycerate acidemia/D-glyceric 
aciduria. Through PCR cloning assisted by in silico approach, we isolated the 
human glycerate kinase genes--Glycerate Kinase 1 (GLYCTK1) and its alternatively 
splicing variant--Glycerate Kinase 2 (GLYCTK2), which might be associated with 
D-glycerate acidemia/D-glyceric aciduria. The locus of GLYCTK gene is mapped to 
3p21. PCR amplification in seventeen human tissue cDNAs revealed that both 
GLYCTK1 and GLYCTK2 are expressed widely almost in all these tissues. The 
expression of mouse Glyctk in various tissues was demonstrated by in situ 
hybridization. Both GLYCTK1 and GLYCTK2 proteins are localized in cytosol, and 
GLYCTK2 proteins are specifically localized in mitochondria. Present results 
revealed the characteristic expression pattern of murine Glyctk in neural 
system, skeleton muscle, supporting that glycerate kinase is implicated in 
D-glycerate acidemia/D-glyceric aciduria.
