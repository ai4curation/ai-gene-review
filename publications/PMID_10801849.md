HeLa DNA polymerase epsilon (pol epsilon), possibly involved in both DNA 
replication and DNA repair, was previously isolated as a complex of a 261-kDa 
catalytic subunit and a tightly bound 59-kDa accessory protein. Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae pol epsilon, however, consists of four subunits: a 256-kDa catalytic 
subunit with 39% identity to HeLa pol epsilon p261, a 80-kDa subunit (DPB2) with 
26% identity to HeLa pol epsilon p59, a 23-kDa subunit (DPB3), and a 22-kDa 
subunit (DPB4). We report here the identification and the cloning of two 
additional subunits of HeLa pol epsilon, p17, and p12. Both proteins contain 
histone fold motifs which are present also in S. cerevisiae DPB4 and DPB3. The 
histone fold motifs of p17 and DPB4 are related to that of subunit A of the 
CCAAT binding factor, whereas the histone fold motifs found in p12 and DPB3 are 
homologous to that in subunit C of CCAAT binding factor. p17 together with p12, 
but not p17 or p12 alone, interact with both p261 and p59 subunits of HeLa pol 
epsilon. The genes for p17 and p12 can be assigned to chromosome locations 9q33 
and 2p12, respectively.
