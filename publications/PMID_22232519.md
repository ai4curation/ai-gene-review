Aberrations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) are the most common 
oncogenic alterations in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary 
brain tumor. Interactions between wild-type (wt) and mutant EGFRs and their 
subsequent activation are of biologic and potential therapeutic importance in 
GBMs. We recently showed that in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) allows for 
quantitative evaluation of EGFR dimerization and activation in intact cells. 
Using this in situ platform, we show the aberrant homo-/heterodimeric properties 
of EGFRvIII and EGFRc958 mutants, the two most common EGFR mutants in GBMs. In 
addition, dimer phosphoactivation status could be detected by PLA with superior 
signal-noise ratio (>17-fold) and sensitivity (>16-fold) than 
immunofluorescence-based phospho-EGFR measurements. Dimer activation analysis 
indicated quantitative activation differences of mutant dimers. These aberrant 
features were not overexpression dependent but appeared independent of cellular 
expression levels, suggesting inherent properties of the mutant receptors. 
Moreover, we observed in situ detection of EGFRwt-EGFRvIII heterodimerization in 
GBM specimens, supporting our cell line observations. Notably, currently used 
anti-EGFR therapeutics, such as cetuximab, matuzumab, and panitumumab, could 
effectively block EGFRwt dimerization and activation but did not equally impair 
EGFRvIII homodimers, EGFRwt-EGFRvIII, or EGFRvIII-EGFRc958 heterodimers. 
EGFRvIII appears to have intrinsic phosphoactivation independent of dimerization 
as matuzumab blockade of homodimerization had no effect on receptor 
phosphorylation levels. These data suggest differences in the 
dimerization-blocking efficacy of EGFR monoclonal antibodies as mutant EGFR 
dimer configurations prevalent in GBMs can evade blockade by anti-EGFR 
treatments. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether this evasion 
contributes to poor therapeutic response or resistance.
