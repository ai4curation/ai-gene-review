Cell senescence and programmed cell death (apoptosis) are two fundamental 
biological mechanisms that regulate proliferative capacity, survival potential, 
aging, and death of cells. Here we report several independent lines of 
experimental evidence that support the hypothesis that telomerase function and 
telomere length perform important roles in cell survival during apoptosis. 
First, with serum starvation and matrix-independent survival experiments, we 
found that young normal diploid cells were more resistant to apoptosis than 
their older counterparts. In addition, normal cells with stable telomere lengths 
caused by ectopic expression of telomerase maintained an increased resistance to 
serum starvation- and matrix-deprivation-induced programmed cell death compared 
with aged normal cells without telomerase. Second, we found that 
telomerase-positive immortalized SW39 cells had a higher survival ability and 
resistance to apoptosis than their telomerase-negative immortalized 
counterparts, SW13 and SW26. Third, we showed that telomerase-positive cells 
with experimentally elongated telomeres (GTR-IDH4 and GTR-DU145) acquired 
increased survival ability and higher resistance to apoptosis than the parental 
cell lines with shorter telomeres (IDH4 and DU145). Higher resistance to 
apoptosis of these cells was associated with a deficiency in two major apoptosis 
execution pathways: induction of nuclear calcium-dependent endonucleases and 
activation of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme-family of proteases 
(caspases). Taken together, these results provide the first direct experimental 
evidence supporting the hypothesis that telomerase activity and maintenance of 
telomere stability are associated with increased cellular resistance to 
apoptosis.
