Several recent studies have revealed the existence of a conserved oligomeric 
Golgi (COG) complex consisting of several novel proteins as well as known Golgi 
proteins that were identified by independent approaches. The mammalian COG 
complex contains eight subunits: COG1/LdlBp, COG2/LdlCp, COG3/Sec34, COG4/Cod1, 
COG5/GTC-90/Cod4, COG6/Cod2, COG7, and COG8/Dor1. COG1, COG2, and COG7 seem 
structurally unique to mammalian cells, whereas the other five subunits are 
structurally conserved in yeast, which also contains three other unique proteins 
(COG1/Sec36p/Cod3p, COG2/Sec35p, and COG7/Cod5p). We report here the network of 
intermolecular interactions of the COG complex, revealed by in vitro translation 
and co-immunoprecipitation approaches. Our results suggest that COG4 serves as a 
core component of the complex by interacting directly with COG1, COG2, COG5, and 
COG7. COG3 is incorporated by its direct interaction with COG1 and COG2, whereas 
COG6 and COG8 do not interact with any individual subunit. Incorporation of COG6 
into the complex depends on the concerted interaction of both COG5 and COG7, 
whereas optimal incorporation of COG8 depends on the concerted interaction of 
COG5, COG6, and COG7. Because COG4 (together with COG1, COG2, and COG3) is among 
the four essential genes of the COG complex in yeast, this molecular network 
highlights the structural basis for a crucial role of COG4 in the 
assembly/function of the complex. A model for the assembly of the COG complex is 
presented.
