Aberrant WNT signal transduction is involved in many diseases. In colorectal 
cancer and melanoma, mutational disruption of proteins involved in the 
degradation of beta-catenin, the key effector of the WNT signaling pathway, 
results in stabilization of beta-catenin and, in turn, activation of 
transcription. We have used tandem-affinity protein purification and mass 
spectrometry to define the protein interaction network of the beta-catenin 
destruction complex. This assay revealed that WTX, a protein encoded by a gene 
mutated in Wilms tumors, forms a complex with beta-catenin, AXIN1, beta-TrCP2 
(beta-transducin repeat-containing protein 2), and APC (adenomatous polyposis 
coli). Functional analyses in cultured cells, Xenopus, and zebrafish demonstrate 
that WTX promotes beta-catenin ubiquitination and degradation, which antagonize 
WNT/beta-catenin signaling. These data provide a possible mechanistic 
explanation for the tumor suppressor activity of WTX.
