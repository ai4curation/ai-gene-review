A newly recognized gene we name rhlB, after RNA helicase-like genes, has been 
found in the 85-minute region of the Escherichia coli chromosome. This gene 
encodes protein sequence motifs similar to those known for "D-E-A-D box" gene 
products. Proteins in this gene family occur in eukaryotes as well as 
prokaryotes, and, as far as tested, have been found to participate in 
ATP-dependent RNA helicase or RNA-dependent ATPase activities. The functions of 
these enzymes are poorly understood. In yeast, mutant phenotypes of various 
D-E-A-D genes suggest that they function in RNA splicing, processing, or 
translation. We find that rhlB is necessary for viability only in some genetic 
backgrounds. Conditional rhlB lethality is not complemented by another E. coli 
RNA helicase-like gene (srmB). Using primers with homology to consensus 
sequences in D-E-A-D box proteins, we have recovered DNA fragments amplified 
from E. coli genomic DNA by polymerase chain reactions. Sequence analysis of 
these fragments suggests that E. coli possesses at least five RNA helicase-like 
(rhl) D-E-A-D box genes at widely separated chromosomal locations. The 
multiplicity of such genes in a prokaryote raises the possibility of important 
roles for the corresponding class of biologically widespread proteins.
