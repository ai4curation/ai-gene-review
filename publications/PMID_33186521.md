Strategies for installing authentic ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) at desired positions 
are fundamental for creating the tools needed to explore this elusive 
post-translational modification (PTM) in essential cellular processes. Here, we 
describe a phospho-guided chemoenzymatic approach based on the Ser-ADPr writer 
complex for rapid, scalable preparation of a panel of pure, precisely modified 
peptides. Integrating this methodology with phage display technology, we have 
developed site-specific as well as broad-specificity antibodies to mono-ADPr. 
These recombinant antibodies have been selected and characterized using multiple 
ADP-ribosylated peptides and tested by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for 
their ability to detect physiological ADPr events. Mono-ADPr proteomics and 
poly-to-mono comparisons at the modification site level have revealed the 
prevalence of mono-ADPr upon DNA damage and illustrated its dependence on PARG 
and ARH3. These and future tools created on our versatile chemical 
biology-recombinant antibody platform have broad potential to elucidate ADPr 
signaling pathways in health and disease.
