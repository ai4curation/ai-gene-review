PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) are a group of basic helix-loop-helix 
(bHLH) transcription factors that repress plant light responses. PIF8 is one of 
the less-characterized Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PIFs, whose putative 
orthologs are conserved in other plant species. PIF8 possesses a bHLH motif and 
an active phytochrome B motif but not an active phytochrome A motif. Consistent 
with this motif composition, PIF8 binds to G-box elements and interacts with the 
Pfr form of phyB but only very weakly, if at all, with that of phyA. PIF8 
differs, however, from other PIFs in its protein accumulation pattern and 
functional roles in different light conditions. First, PIF8 inhibits 
phyA-induced seed germination, suppression of hypocotyl elongation, and 
randomization of hypocotyl growth orientation in far-red light, but it does not 
inhibit phyB-induced red light responses. Second, PIF8 protein accumulates more 
in far-red light than in darkness or red light. This is distinct from the 
pattern observed with PIF3, which accumulates more in darkness. This PIF8 
accumulation pattern requires degradation of PIF8 by CONSTITUTIVE 
PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) in darkness, inhibition of COP1 by phyA in far-red 
light, and promotion of PIF8 degradation by phyB in red light. Together, our 
results indicate that PIF8 is a genuine PIF that represses phyA-mediated light 
responses.

INTRODUCTION

Plants have evolved significant developmental plasticity to ensure their survival in the face of changing environmental conditions. Of the many environmental factors influencing plant development, light is one of the most critical ( Franklin and Quail, 2010 ). In the dark, seedlings display skotomorphogenic phenotypes characterized by elongated hypocotyls with closed cotyledons and an exaggerated apical hook. These are developmental adjustments by which germinating seedlings can rapidly push through the soil without harming the shoot apical meristem. Once the seedlings emerge from the soil, skotomorphogenesis is suppressed, and the seedlings display photomorphogenic phenotypes characterized by short hypocotyls with open cotyledons and fully developed chloroplasts that are ready for photosynthesis. Plants have developed several classes of photoreceptors that detect and respond to light quality, quantity, duration, and direction ( Galvão and Fankhauser, 2015 ; Li and Mathews, 2016 ). Phytochromes (phyA to phyE in Arabidopsis [ Arabidopsis thaliana ]) are chromophore-conjugated dimeric proteins responsible for detecting far-red and red light ( Clack et al., 1994 ; Rockwell et al., 2006 ; Li et al., 2015 ). Far-red and red light induce reversible conformational changes in phytochromes such that they take either the biologically inactive Pr form or the biologically active Pfr form, respectively. Pfr phytochromes enter the nucleus and promote photomorphogenesis, partly by inhibiting basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors called PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) and ubiquitin E3 ligase complexes called CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1/SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 complexes (COP1/SPAs; Nagatani, 2004 ; Bae and Choi, 2008 ; Leivar and Quail, 2011 ; Klose et al., 2015 ; Xu et al., 2015 ; Hoecker, 2017 ). In addition to detecting external light conditions, phytochromes also seem to sense ambient temperature. Pfr phytochromes are gradually converted to their Pr forms by thermal reversion, a process that is accelerated by increasing ambient temperature ( Jung et al., 2016 ; Legris et al., 2016 ).

PIFs are bHLH transcription factors that possess a phyA binding APA (active phytochrome A) motif or a phyB binding APB (active phytochrome B) motif ( Khanna et al., 2004 ; Al-Sady et al., 2006 ). They bind to G-box (CACGTG) motifs either alone or together with other transcription factors, including group A bZIPs like ABA INSENSITIVE5 (Martínez-García et al., 2000 ; Huq and Quail, 2002 ; Huq et al., 2004 ; Oh et al., 2007 , 2009 ; Leivar et al., 2008b ; Hornitschek et al., 2009 , 2012 ; Kidokoro et al., 2009 ; Li, 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ; Li et al., 2014 ; Pfeiffer et al., 2014 ; Kim et al., 2016b) . Upon binding to their target promoters, PIFs recruit transcriptional regulators like LEUNIG_HOMOLOG, HEMERA, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1, and HISTONE DEACETYLASE15 to either positively or negatively regulate gene expression ( Yamashino et al., 2003 ; Liu et al., 2013 ; Lee et al., 2015 ; Qiu et al., 2015 ; Soy et al., 2016 ; Zhu et al., 2016 ; Gu et al., 2017 ; Qiu et al., 2019 ). PIFs promote skotomorphogenic development in the dark through this regulation of target gene expression. PIFs are found in all land plants ranging from liverwort to angiosperms ( Llorente et al., 2016 ; Rosado et al., 2016 ; Lee and Choi, 2017 ; Xu and Hiltbrunner, 2017 ; Gao et al., 2019 ). Chara braunii , which belongs to the Charophyta clade, possesses a protein containing a distantly related APA motif, suggesting that PIF-like proteins may have evolved even before the emergence of land plants ( Possart et al., 2017 ). Multiple PIFs are present in most land plant species with the exception of Marchantia polymorpha , a liverwort with only one PIF ( Inoue et al., 2016 ). Arabidopsis possesses at least eight PIFs (PIF1 to PIF8), which regulate light responses either redundantly or distinctively ( Jeong and Choi, 2013 ; Pham et al., 2018c ). Among them, PIF1 specifically inhibits seed germination, whereas most PIFs redundantly promote skotomorphogenic phenotypes partly through their ability to promote cell elongation ( Oh et al., 2004 ; Leivar and Monte, 2014 ). The redundant roles of the PIFs are exemplified by the constitutively photomorphogenic phenotypes of the pif quadruple mutant ( pif1 pif3 pif4 pif5 ) in the dark ( Leivar et al., 2008a ; Shin et al., 2009 ).

Phytochromes inhibit PIFs in part by promoting PIF protein degradation. Light-activated Pfr interacts with and phosphorylates PIFs by kinase activity either intrinsic to the phytochromes or, as is the case for PIF3, by PHOTOREGULATORY PROTEIN KINASEs (PPK1 to PPK4) that are associated with phyB ( Al-Sady et al., 2006 ; Ni et al., 2013 , 2017 ; Shin et al., 2016 ). The phosphorylated PIFs are then polyubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by 26S proteasomes ( Bauer et al., 2004 ; Park et al., 2004 ; Shen et al., 2005 , 2007 , 2008 ; Oh et al., 2006 ; Nozue et al., 2007 ; Lorrain et al., 2008 ). A few E3 ubiquitin ligases have been identified that ubiquitinate PIFs for degradation. Among the E3 ligase components, COLD TEMPERATURE-GERMINATING10 and EIN3 BINDING F-BOX PROTEINs promote light-induced degradation of PIF1 and PIF3, respectively ( Dong et al., 2017 ; Majee et al., 2018 ). BLADE-ON-PETIOLEs ubiquitinate PIF4 for degradation in red light ( Zhang et al., 2017 ), while LIGHT-RESPONSIVE BRIC-A-BRACK/TRAMTRACK/BROADs bind to the Pfr form of phyB and PIF3 and ubiquitinate them, ensuring their destruction in the presence of red light ( Ni et al., 2014 ). PIFs are also phosphorylated independently of light by protein kinases such as CASEIN KINASE II and BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2; Bu et al., 2011 ; Ling et al., 2017 ). In addition to PIF protein degradation, phyB inhibits PIFs by sequestering them from their target gene promoters ( Park et al., 2012 , 2018 ).

COP1 is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that suppresses photomorphogenesis in association with SPA proteins ( Huang et al., 2014 ; Hoecker, 2017 ). COP1/SPAs suppress photomorphogenesis by directly ubiquitinating and degrading photomorphogenesis-promoting factors including ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1) in the dark ( Osterlund et al., 2000 ; Hoecker and Quail, 2001 ; Duek et al., 2004 ; Jang et al., 2005 ; Yang et al., 2005 ). COP1 also regulates PIF protein stability: it promotes the degradation of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3-LIKE1 (PIL1/PIF2; Luo et al., 2014 ) but increases the stability of PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5 in the dark ( Bauer et al., 2004 ; Pham et al., 2018a , 2018b ). During the dark-to-light transition, COP1 also ubiquitinates PIF1 and PIF5, promoting their degradation ( Shen et al., 2008 ; Zhu et al., 2015 ; Pham et al., 2018b ). Phytochromes inhibit COP1/SPAs either by excluding COP1 from the nucleus ( von Arnim and Deng, 1994 ; Osterlund and Deng, 1998 ; Pacín et al., 2013 , 2014 ), by disrupting COP1/SPA complexes ( Lu et al., 2015 ; Sheerin et al., 2015 ), or by degrading SPA proteins ( Balcerowicz et al., 2011 ; Chen et al., 2015 ). Such inhibition of COP1/SPAs by phytochromes results in the accumulation of several different factors, including HY5, that promote photomorphogenic development in the light.

PIF8 is one of the more poorly characterized PIFs in Arabidopsis ( Leivar and Quail, 2011 ). Given the importance of the other PIFs in light signaling, however, PIF8 too likely plays an important role in light signaling. Here, we report that PIF8 binds to the Pfr form of phyB but only very weakly, if at all, to that of phyA. We found that PIF8, unlike other PIFs, suppresses phyA-mediated far-red light responses, including seed germination and seedling photomorphogenesis, without affecting phyB-mediated responses to red light. PIF8 protein levels are higher under far-red light illumination than in the dark or under red light. This is in contrast to the levels of the other PIFs, which are higher in the dark than under red or far-red light. This increased accumulation of PIF8 under far-red light is caused by the combination of phyA-mediated inhibition of COP1 under far-red light, COP1-mediated degradation of PIF8 in the dark, and the promotion of PIF8 degradation by phyB in red light. Together, these findings indicate that PIF8 is a genuine PIF that mitigates excessive photomorphogenic seedling development in prolonged far-red light.

DISCUSSION

Here, we characterized the most poorly studied member of the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR protein family, PIF8, whose putative orthologs are conserved in plant species as diverse as tomato and rice. PIF8 possesses a bHLH domain and a highly conserved APB motif, but it does not have a conserved APA motif. Consistent with its motif composition, PIF8 binds to G-box elements in its target gene promoters and interacts preferentially with the Pfr form of phyB but only very weakly, if at all, with that of phyA. Interestingly, PIF8 is distinct from the other more well-characterized Arabidopsis PIFs in its protein stability pattern and functional roles in different light conditions. First, PIF8 represses photomorphogenic development in far-red but not in red light; it inhibits phyA-induced seed germination, suppression of hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon opening, and suppression of hypocotyl negative gravitropism in far-red light, but it does not inhibit phyB-induced light responses in red light. Second, PIF8 protein is more stable in far-red light than in the dark or in red light, whereas other PIFs, PIF3 for example, are more stable in the dark than in far-red and red light. This pattern of PIF8 accumulation is accomplished by the combination of COP1/SPAs-induced degradation of PIF8 in the dark, phyA-induced inhibition of COP1/SPAs in far-red light, and the degradation of PIF8 by phyB in red light. Together, our results indicate that PIF8 is a genuine PIF that inhibits phyA-mediated far-red light responses ( Figure 8 ).

The exact molecular mechanism by which PIF8 inhibits phyA- and not phyB-mediated light responses is not fully clear. PIF8 binds the promoters of PIF target genes and activates their mRNA expression ( Figure 7 ; Supplemental Figure 3 ), suggesting that PIF8, like PIF3, inhibits light responses via its role as a transcription factor. The selective stabilization of PIF8 combined with its resistance to being sequestered by phyA in far-red light would make PIF8 more active in far-red than in red light, thus biasing its action toward the inhibition of phyA-mediated light responses. It is unclear, however, whether the far-red light specificity of PIF8 is due solely to increased transcription factor activity in far-red light. Comparisons of the transcriptome- and genome-wide binding sites of PIF8 and PIF3 would allow us to confirm whether they bind similar target genes despite their preferential inhibition of phyA- or phyB-mediated light responses, respectively.

PIF8 is an Arabidopsis PIF possessing a bHLH motif and an APB motif but no APA motif. Two tomato PIF8 homologs (Sl-PIF8a and Sl-PIF8b) and a rice homolog (Os-PIF8) also possess a bHLH motif and an APB motif but no APA motif ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). This motif composition is similar to that of PIF2, PIF4, PIF5, PIF6, and PIF7 but different from that of PIF1 and PIF3, which possess both the APA and APB motifs ( Leivar and Quail, 2011 ). The tomato and rice PIFs and PILs that cluster with Arabidopsis PIF1 and PIF3 (i.e., Sl-PIF1a, Sl-PIF1b, Sl-PIF3, and Os-PIL15) also possess both APA and APB motifs, whereas tomato and rice PIFs and PILs that cluster with Arabidopsis PIF4, PIF5, PIF7, and PIF8 (i.e., Sl-PIF4/PIF5, Sl-PIF7a, Sl-PIF7b, Sl-PIF8a, Sl-PIF8b, and Os-PIF8) do not have APA motifs ( Figure 1B ; Nakamura et al., 2007 ; Zhou et al., 2014a ; Rosado et al., 2016 ; Lee and Choi, 2017 ; Ji et al., 2019 ). Thus, the absence of an APA motif is one of the most distinguishing features of PIF8 and its homologs.

The motif composition of PIF8 partly explains its molecular properties. First, PIF8’s ability to bind to G-box motifs in vitro and promoters containing G-box motifs in vivo can be attributed to its bHLH motif ( Figure 7 ). Studies have shown that the bHLH motifs of Arabidopsis PIFs bind to specific sequence elements including G-boxes (CACGTG) and PIF binding E-boxes (ACATG; Martínez-García et al., 2000 ; Huq and Quail, 2002 ; Huq et al., 2004 ; Oh et al., 2007 , 2009 ; Kim et al., 2008 ; Leivar et al., 2008b ; Hornitschek et al., 2009 , 2012 ; Kidokoro et al., 2009 ; Li, 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ; Li et al., 2014 ; Pfeiffer et al., 2014 ). Similarly, PIFs in other plant species including Sl-PIF1, Sl-PIF3, Os-PIL13, and Os-PIL14 also bind to G-boxes or promoters containing G-box or PIF binding E-box elements ( Todaka, 2012 ; Cordeiro et al., 2016 ; Llorente et al., 2016 ; Sakuraba et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2018 ).

Second, the presence of an APB motif but not an APA motif likely explains why PIF8 binds to phyB but only very weakly, if at all, to phyA. In previous studies, Arabidopsis PIFs with an APB motif bind to phyB, whereas PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7, which lack an APA motif, either do not bind to phyA or bind only weakly ( Huq and Quail, 2002 ; Huq et al., 2004 ; Shen et al., 2007 ; Leivar et al., 2008b ; Leivar and Quail, 2011 ; Lee and Choi, 2017 ). Similarly, APA-containing PIFs in other plant species including maize ( Zea mays ; i.e., Zm-PIF1, Zm-PIF2, and Zm-PIF3) bind to phyA, while APB-containing PIFs including rice Os-PIL14, Os-PIL15, and Os-PIL16 and maize Zm-PIF1 through Zm-PIF6 bind to phyB ( Cordeiro et al., 2016 ; He et al., 2016 ; Kumar et al., 2016 ; Gao et al., 2019 ; Xie et al., 2019 ). This is consistent with the APA and APB motifs of PIFs being necessary for binding to phyA and phyB, respectively. APA and APB motifs, however, do not seem to be the sole determining factor for a PIF’s ability to interact with either phyA or phyB. In our experiments, PIF5, although lacking an APA motif, binds to the Pfr form of phyA ( Supplemental Figure 7 ). PIF4, which also lacks an APA motif, does not bind to phyA in vitro. Rice Os-PIL13, which has an APB motif, does not interact with rice phyB ( Todaka et al., 2012 ). Since in vitro binding assays can be influenced by experimental conditions, further experimental verification will be necessary to conclude whether the APA and APB motifs are necessary and sufficient for PIF interactions with phyA and phyB, respectively.

Third, PIF8’s lack of an APA motif only partly accounts for its light-dependent degradation. Previous studies have implicated the APA motif in phyA-induced PIF protein degradation in far-red light and the APB motif in phyB-induced PIF protein degradation in red light. Consistent with this, PIF1 and PIF3, which possess both the APA and APB motifs, are degraded both in red and far-red light, whereas PIF4 and PIF5, which possess the APB motif but not the APA motif, are degraded in red light and only weakly degraded in far-red light ( Bauer et al., 2004 ; Park et al., 2004 ; Al-Sady et al., 2006 ; Oh et al., 2006 ; Shen et al., 2007 , 2008 ; Lorrain et al., 2008 ). Consistent with its APB motif, red light-induced degradation of PIF8 protein is dependent on phyB. Curiously, however, rather than being degraded by phyA, PIF8 protein is stabilized by phyA in far-red light. This degradation pattern is distinct from that of PIF1 and PIF3 and from that of PIF4 and PIF5. It is also different from that of PIF2, which is stabilized in red light, and that of PIF7, which is not degraded in red light ( Leivar et al., 2008b ; Luo et al., 2014 ). Thus, although the APA and APB motifs are necessary for phyA- and phyB-dependent PIF degradation, respectively, the presence of an APA or APB motif cannot be considered the only factor determining phyA- or phyB-dependent PIF degradation.

Our data indicate that COP1 also shapes the PIF8 protein degradation pattern in different light conditions. PIF8 protein is polyubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome in the dark, whereas it is stabilized in a phyA-dependent manner in far-red light. Because PIF8 does not directly interact with phyA, this phyA-dependent stabilization of PIF8 protein in far-red light must occur through interaction with another protein. Our data show that COP1 directly interacts with and ubiquitinates PIF8, whereas phyA stabilizes PIF8 in far-red light by inhibiting COP1. According to previous studies, phyA inhibits COP1/SPAs either by excluding COP1 from the nucleus ( Osterlund and Deng, 1998 ), by disrupting the COP1/SPA complex ( Sheerin et al., 2015 ), or by degrading SPA proteins ( Balcerowicz et al., 2011 ; Chen et al., 2015 ). Since COP1/SPAs are light-blind ubiquitin E3 ligases, it seems more likely that COP1/SPAs would ubiquitinate PIF8 protein regardless of the light condition. In far-red light, however, phyA’s inhibition of COP1/SPAs inhibits the COP1-dependent ubiquitination of PIF8, resulting in higher accumulation of PIF8 in far-red light than in the dark. Blue light also inhibits COP1/SPAs via cryptochromes and phyA ( Lian et al., 2011 ; Liu et al., 2011 ; Sheerin et al., 2015 ). Consistently, PIF8 protein is stabilized in blue light ( Supplemental Figure 8 ). PIF8 protein levels in red light are also higher in cop1 mutant seedlings than in the wild type, suggesting that phyB also inhibits the action of COP1/SPAs on PIF8. However, PIF8 protein is still degraded in cop1 mutant seedlings grown in red light ( Figure 6B ), indicating that the degradation of PIF8 by phyB can override phyB-mediated inhibition of COP1/SPAs in red light. Together, these results suggest that PIF8’s light-dependent degradation pattern is determined by a combination of COP1/SPA-mediated degradation of PIF8 in the dark, phyA-mediated inhibition of COP1/SPAs leading to the stabilization of PIF8 in far-red light, and phyB-mediated degradation of PIF8 in red light.

COP1 also regulates the stability of other PIFs, but not all PIFs are unilaterally degraded by COP1/SPAs. PIFs can either be stabilized or destabilized depending on the identity of the PIF and on light conditions. PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5 are stabilized by COP1 in the dark ( Bauer et al., 2004 ; Pham et al., 2018a , 2018b ). Although the mechanism by which this PIF stabilization occurs is not fully understood, PIF3 stabilization by COP1 can be attributed to COP1’s inhibition of the BIN2 protein kinase, which itself phosphorylates and destabilizes PIF3 ( Ling et al., 2017 ). Upon prolonged light exposure, however, the stability of PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5 is not regulated by COP1. Very shortly after the transition from dark to light, PIF1 and PIF5 are destabilized by the COP1/SPA complex ( Shen et al., 2008 ; Zhu et al., 2015 ; Pham et al., 2018b ). Among the other less-characterized PIFs, PIF2 is destabilized by COP1 in the dark but not in red, far-red, and blue light ( Luo et al., 2014 ). At this point, it is unclear what determines these various COP1/SPAs-associated PIF degradation patterns.

Our data indicate that PIF8 promotes hypocotyl elongation in blue, far-red, or mixed blue and far-red light but not in red light ( Figure 3 ; Supplemental Figure 8 ). This PIF8 activity is quite different from those of the better-characterized PIFs including PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7, which promote hypocotyl elongation in red light but either not at all in far-red light (PIF3 and PIF7) or very weakly in far-red light (PIF1, PIF4, and PIF5; Huq and Quail, 2002 ; Kim et al., 2003 ; Fujimori et al., 2004 ; Oh et al., 2004 ; Khanna et al., 2007 ; Leivar et al., 2008b ; Castillon et al., 2009 ; Lorrain et al., 2009 ; Kunihiro et al., 2010 ; Ma et al., 2016 ). PIF8 is also different from PIF2, which weakly inhibits hypocotyl elongation in red, far-red, and blue light ( Luo et al., 2014 ). These different light-specific activities of the various PIFs are not merely due to light-dependent PIF degradation. Rather, these functional differences arise from a combination of factors including light-dependent PIF degradation and light-dependent PIF sequestration by phytochromes and other proteins such as HFR1 and DELLA ( de Lucas et al., 2008 ; Feng et al., 2008 ; Hornitschek et al., 2009 ; Lorrain et al., 2009 ; Park et al., 2012 ; Shi et al., 2013 ). Such light-specific PIF8 activities should mitigate excessive phyA-mediated light responses in conditions enriched with far-red and blue light. The ecological conditions in which PIF8 plays a key role must still be identified.
