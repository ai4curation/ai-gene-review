Calorie restriction extends lifespan in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. 
In yeast, the SIR2 gene mediates the life-extending effects of calorie 
restriction. Here we show that the mammalian SIR2 orthologue, Sirt1 (sirtuin 1), 
activates a critical component of calorie restriction in mammals; that is, fat 
mobilization in white adipocytes. Upon food withdrawal Sirt1 protein binds to 
and represses genes controlled by the fat regulator PPAR-gamma (peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma), including genes mediating fat storage. 
Sirt1 represses PPAR-gamma by docking with its cofactors NCoR (nuclear receptor 
co-repressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone 
receptors). Mobilization of fatty acids from white adipocytes upon fasting is 
compromised in Sirt1+/- mice. Repression of PPAR-gamma by Sirt1 is also evident 
in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, where overexpression of Sirt1 attenuates adipogenesis, and 
RNA interference of Sirt1 enhances it. In differentiated fat cells, upregulation 
of Sirt1 triggers lipolysis and loss of fat. As a reduction in fat is sufficient 
to extend murine lifespan, our results provide a possible molecular pathway 
connecting calorie restriction to life extension in mammals.
