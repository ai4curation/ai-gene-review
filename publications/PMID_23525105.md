Studies of post-mortem brains from Alzheimer disease patients suggest that 
oxidative damage induced by mitochondrial amyloid β (mitAβ) accumulation is 
associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the regulation of mitAβ 
metabolism is unknown. One of the proteases involved in mitAβ catabolism is the 
long insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) isoform (IDE-Met(1)). However, the 
mechanisms of its expression are unknown, and its presence in brain is 
uncertain. We detected IDE-Met(1) in brain and showed that its expression is 
regulated by the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway (PGC-1α/NRF-1). A strong 
positive correlation between PGC-1α or NRF-1 and long IDE isoform transcripts 
was found in non-demented brains. This correlation was weaker in Alzheimer 
disease. In vitro inhibition of IDE increased mitAβ and impaired mitochondrial 
respiration. These changes were restored by inhibition of γ-secretase or 
promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis. Our results suggest that IDE-Met(1) links 
the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway with mitAβ levels and organelle 
functionality.
