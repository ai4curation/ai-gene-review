The gene spy from Escherichia coli has been cloned and sequenced. It encodes a 
precursor of a so far unknown 139-residue, rather basic periplasmic protein. It 
was not detectable immunologically in intact cells but was produced abundantly 
in spheroplasts. It could be a stress protein specific for spheroplasting.
