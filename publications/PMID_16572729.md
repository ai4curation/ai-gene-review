The Drosophila melanogaster family of small heat shock proteins (sHsps) is 
composed of 4 main members (Hsp22, Hsp23, Hsp26, and Hsp27) that display 
distinct intracellular localization and specific developmental patterns of 
expression in the absence of stress. In an attempt to determine their function, 
we have examined whether these 4 proteins have chaperone-like activity using 
various chaperone assays. Heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase was 
decreased from 100 to 17 arbitrary units in the presence of Hsp22 and Hsp27 at a 
1:1 molar ratio of sHsp to citrate synthase. A 5 M excess of Hsp23 and Hsp26 was 
required to obtain the same efficiency with either citrate synthase or 
luciferase as substrate. In an in vitro refolding assay with reticulocyte 
lysate, more than 50% of luciferase activity was recovered when heat 
denaturation was performed in the presence of Hsp22, 40% with Hsp27, and 30% 
with Hsp23 or Hsp26. These differences in luciferase reactivation efficiency 
seemed related to the ability of sHsps to bind their substrate at 42 degrees C, 
as revealed by sedimentation analysis of sHsp and luciferase on sucrose 
gradients. Therefore, the 4 main sHsps of Drosophila share the ability to 
prevent heat-induced protein aggregation and are able to maintain proteins in a 
refoldable state, although with different efficiencies. The functional reasons 
for their distinctive cell-specific pattern of expression could reflect the 
existence of defined substrates for each sHsp within the different intracellular 
compartments.
