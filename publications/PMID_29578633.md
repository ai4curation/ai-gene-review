The intracellular adaptor protein Mint2 binds amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
and presenilin-1, which are both central constituents of the amyloidogenic 
pathway associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additional interaction 
partners have also been suggested for Mint2; several of them are also pertinent 
to AD pathogenesis. However, no comparative mapping of the Mint2 protein-protein 
interaction network is available. Here we provide a systematic characterization 
of seven interaction partners and address their specificities towards the 
different binding domains of Mint2, which reveal domain-specific and 
-nonspecific interaction partners. Moreover, we show that the last two 
C-terminal amino acids of Mint2 are both important for the intramolecular 
interaction with the PDZ1 domain and for the stability of Mint2.
