The spindle checkpoint controls mitotic progression. Checkpoint proteins are 
temporally recruited to kinetochores, but their docking site is unknown. We show 
that a human kinetochore oncoprotein, AF15q14/blinkin, a member of the 
Spc105/Spc7/KNL-1 family, directly links spindle checkpoint proteins BubR1 and 
Bub1 to kinetochores and is required for spindle checkpoint and chromosome 
alignment. Blinkin RNAi causes accelerated mitosis due to a checkpoint failure 
and chromosome misalignment resulting from the lack of kinetochore and 
microtubule attachment. Blinkin RNAi phenotypes resemble the double RNAi 
phenotypes of Bub1 and BubR1 in living cells. While the carboxy domain 
associates with the c20orf172/hMis13 and DC8/hMis14 subunits of the hMis12 
complex in the inner kinetochore, association of the amino and middle domain of 
blinkin with the TPR domains in the amino termini of BubR1 and Bub1 is essential 
for BubR1 and Bub1 to execute their distinct mitotic functions. Blinkin may be 
the center of the network for generating kinetochore-based checkpoint signaling.
