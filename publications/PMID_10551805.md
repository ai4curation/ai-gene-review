Presenilin-1 (PS-1) is the most causative Alzheimer gene product, and its 
function is not well understood. In an attempt to elucidate the function of 
PS-1, we screened a human brain cDNA library for PS-1-interacting proteins using 
the yeast two-hybrid system and isolated a novel protein containing a 
PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-like domain. This novel PS-1-associated protein (PSAP) 
shares a significant similarity with a Caenorhabditis elegans protein of unknown 
function. Northern blot analysis revealed that PSAP is predominantly expressed 
in the brain. Deletion of the first four C-terminal amino acid residues of PS-1, 
which contain the PDZ domain-binding motif (Gln-Phe-Tyr-Ile), reduced the 
binding activity of PS-1 toward PSAP 4-fold. These data suggest that PS-1 may 
associate with a PDZ-like domain-containing protein in vivo and thus may 
participate in receptor or channel clustering and intracellular signaling events 
in the brain.
