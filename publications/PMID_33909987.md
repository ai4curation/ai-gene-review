Incompletely synthesized nascent chains obstructing large ribosomal subunits are 
targeted for degradation by ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). In 
bacterial RQC, RqcH marks the nascent chains with C-terminal alanine (Ala) tails 
that are directly recognized by proteasome-like proteases, whereas in 
eukaryotes, RqcH orthologs (Rqc2/NEMF [nuclear export mediator factor]) assist 
the Ltn1/Listerin E3 ligase in nascent chain ubiquitylation. Here, we study 
RQC-mediated proteolytic targeting of ribosome stalling products in mammalian 
cells. We show that mammalian NEMF has an additional, Listerin-independent 
proteolytic role, which, as in bacteria, is mediated by tRNA-Ala binding and Ala 
tailing. However, in mammalian cells Ala tails signal proteolysis indirectly, 
through a pathway that recognizes C-terminal degrons; we identify the 
CRL2KLHDC10 E3 ligase complex and the novel C-end rule E3, Pirh2/Rchy1, as bona 
fide RQC pathway components that directly bind to Ala-tailed ribosome stalling 
products and target them for degradation. As Listerin mutation causes 
neurodegeneration in mice, functionally redundant E3s may likewise be implicated 
in molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration.
