In response to viral infection, cytosolic retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like 
receptors sense viral RNA and promote oligomerization of mitochondrial antiviral 
signaling protein (MAVS), which then recruits tumor necrosis factor 
receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family proteins, including TRAF6, to activate 
an antiviral response. Currently, the interaction between MAVS and TRAF6 is only 
partially understood, and atomic details are lacking. Here, we demonstrated that 
MAVS directly interacts with TRAF6 through its potential TRAF6-binding motif 2 
(T6BM2; amino acids 455-460). Further, we solved the crystal structure of MAVS 
T6BM2 in complex with the TRAF6 TRAF_C domain at 2.95 Å resolution. T6BM2 of 
MAVS binds to the canonical adaptor-binding groove of the TRAF_C domain. 
Structure-directed mutational analyses in vitro and in cells revealed that MAVS 
binding to TRAF6 via T6BM2 instead of T6BM1 is essential but not sufficient for 
an optimal antiviral response. Particularly, a MAVS mutant Y460E retained its 
TRAF6-binding ability as predicted but showed significantly impaired signaling 
activity, highlighting the functional importance of this tyrosine. Moreover, 
these observations were further confirmed in MAVS(-/-) mouse embryonic 
fibroblast cells. Collectively, our work provides a structural basis for 
understanding the MAVS-TRAF6 antiviral response.

Introduction

The innate immune system senses pathogen infection via germ line-encoded pattern recognition receptors. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) 3 -like receptors (RLRs) are cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors that detect virus-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). RLRs have three known members, RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) ( 1 , 2 ). They share a central DEXD/H box helicase/ATPase domain and a C-terminal domain. Except LGP2, both RIG-I and MDA5 contain two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs). RIG-I specifically recognizes 5′-triphosphates and 5′-diphosphates of viral dsRNA via its C-terminal domain ( 3 , 4 ). Binding of viral dsRNA to RIG-I releases its CARDs from a closed autoinhibited state, leading to an active conformation ( 5 – 7 ). The free CARDs of RIG-I is then ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) ( 8 ). Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, as well as non-covalent binding of unanchored Lys-63 ubiquitin chains to RIG-I synergistically promotes the oligomerization of its CARDs, whereas filamentation of RIG-I surrounding long viral dsRNA also results in clustering of its CARDs ( 8 – 11 ). In this regard, MDA5 mainly senses long viral dsRNA and assembles into filament along dsRNA, which facilitates the oligomerization of its CARDs ( 12 ). Due to the lack of CARD, LGP2 alone cannot activate an antiviral response but instead functions as a positive or negative regulator of RLR signaling ( 13 , 14 ). For example, LGP2 was recently reported as an MDA5 activator, which enhances the RNA-binding ability of MDA5 and regulates MDA5 filament assembly to activate antiviral signaling ( 15 ).

RIG-I and MDA5 directly interact with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS; also called VISA or IPS-1), a critical downstream adaptor, to trigger signal transduction ( 16 – 19 ). MAVS is composed of an N-terminal CARD, a long unstructured loop containing a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain ( Fig. 1 A ). Using the oligomers of RIG-I or MDA5 CARDs as templates, MAVS can form a large filament via CARD-mediated homotypic interactions on the surface of the mitochondrion ( 20 – 22 ). The MAVS filament recruits multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6, via its TRAF-interacting motifs (TIMs) ( 17 , 23 – 27 ). These TRAF proteins are E3 ligases that can activate downstream TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/IκB kinase ϵ (IKKϵ) and IKKα/β, which in turn activate the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3/7 and NF-κB. Activated IRF3/7 and NF-κB translocate to the nucleus to induce the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines.

TRAF proteins act as crucial adaptors and E3 ligases in signal transduction important for immunity and development ( 28 , 29 ). For example, TRAF proteins are intensively involved in RLR, Toll-like receptor, NOD-like receptor, TNF receptor, and cytokine receptor signaling. They recognize distinct TIMs in upstream regulators through their C-terminal TRAF domains. Several TRAF proteins, including TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6, in complex with various partners have been structurally characterized, which reveals the specific recognition motifs of different TRAF proteins ( 30 – 38 ). Most TRAF proteins possess an N-terminal RING finger domain followed by several zinc fingers. TRAF proteins display E3 ligases activity and mediate Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination to modulate functions of substrate molecules via their RING finger domains ( 39 ). In Toll-like receptor and NOD-like receptor signaling, TRAF6 recruits and activates NF-κB essential modulator-IKKα/β and TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 1/2/3-TAK1, resulting in the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, whereas TRAF3 recruits IKKα and TBK1/IKKϵ to facilitate IRF3/7 phosphorylation and activation, both of which depend on their E3 ligase activities and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination ( 29 ). The regulatory effect of TRAF proteins on RLR signaling is controversial. MAVS has three potential TIMs, named TRAF2/3-binding motif (T2/3BM, 143 PVQDT 147 ) and TRAF6-binding motifs 1 and 2 (T6BM1, 153 PGENSE 158 ; T6BM2, 455 PEENEY 460 ) ( 17 ). The T2/3BM and T6BM1 are located in the proline-rich region of MAVS, whereas the T6BM2 is adjacent to the transmembrane domain. A group of studies indicate that MAVS associates with TRAF2 and TRAF3 via T2/3BM and associates with TRAF6 via T6BM1/2 ( 16 , 17 , 23 ). Deletion or mutation of TIMs impairs the binding of MAVS with TRAF proteins and the activation of NF-κB and interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). Moreover, deletion of T6BM2 resulted in a stronger effect than did T2/3BM or T6BM1 deletion, suggesting that T6BM2 plays a more important role in MAVS-mediated antiviral function. However, the interaction between MAVS and TRAF6 has not been structurally characterized.

Here, we identified the T6BM2 of MAVS, but not the T6BM1, as the primary binding site of TRAF6 and determined the crystal structure of T6BM2 in complex with the TRAF_C domain of TRAF6 to 2.95 Å resolution. Mutations on the interface that disrupt MAVS-TRAF6 complex assembly significantly impaired downstream antiviral signaling. Of particularly interest, a MAVS mutant, Y460E, which was designed to retain its TRAF6-binding ability, could indeed bind TRAF6 as does wild type MAVS but could no longer elicit an optimal antiviral response, indicating a critical role of tyrosine 460. Overall, our work provides a structural basis to further study MAVS-TRAF6 signaling.

Discussion

Previously, the T2/3BM of MAVS was demonstrated to directly bind TRAF3 ( 30 ). Because TRAF6 and TRAF3 recognize different motifs, T2/3BM would not bind TRAF6. Meanwhile, a deletion study suggests that T6BM2 may be more important than T6BM1 in the function of MAVS ( 16 ). Here, we demonstrated that the conserved T6BM2, but not T6BM1 of MAVS, is the major binding site for TRAF6, although two papers ( 46 , 47 ) reported that T6BM2 was required for TRAF3 binding in a co-immunoprecipitation assay and that mutation of T6BM2 impaired TRAF3 binding and antiviral response.

The consensus sequence of the TRAF6-binding motif has been defined as P X E XX -aromatic/acidic residue ( 33 ). However, unexpectedly, the T6BM1 of MAVS ( 153 PGENSE 158 ) cannot directly interact with TRAF6 ( Fig. 1 C ). According to the above consensus, residues Pro-153, Glu-155, and Glu-158 of the T6BM1 would have contributed to TRAF6 binding, but other residues could play negative roles and thus block the association of T6BM1 with TRAF6. This observation indicates that the previously defined consensus motif may not be sufficient for binding TRAF6 in certain cases. On the other hand, the +6 position of MAVS T6BM2 ( 455 PEENEY 460 ) is tyrosine 460. This aromatic residue could be replaced with an acidic residue, such as glutamate, as observed for IRAK proteins ( 33 ). Thus, it is expected that substitution of MAVS Tyr-460 with a glutamate would not affect its TRAF6-binding ability. Indeed, mutation Y460E did not disrupt MAVS binding to TRAF6, confirming that an aromatic residue at the +6 position is equivalent to an acidic residue in terms of TRAF6 binding.

Our study clearly indicates that MAVS interaction with TRAF6 via T6BM2 is essential for MAVS-mediated antiviral response. However, substitution of MAVS tyrosine 460 with a glutamate that retains MAVS interaction with TRAF6 is not sufficient for optimal signaling activity, highlighting the functional importance of this tyrosine. Such a discrepancy could be caused by multiple reasons given the distinct nature of tyrosine (neutral) and glutamate (acidic). One possibility is that the local conformation was disturbed by the Y460E mutation so that it is no longer optimal for signaling. An alternative possibility is that posttranslational modification of Tyr-460 is involved in MAVS signaling. For example, tyrosine can be phosphorylated, but glutamate could not. Together, these observations highlight the functional importance of the amino acid Tyr-460 for MAVS activity.

In conclusion, the crystal structure of the MAVS-TRAF6 complex offers insights into the specific interaction mode between MAVS and TRAF6 with atomic details. Our work, together with the crystal structure of the MAVS T2/3BM in complex with TRAF3 ( 30 ), indicates that MAVS directly recruits TRAF6 and TRAF3 in parallel through its T6BM2 and T2/3BM, respectively, to activate downstream kinases and transduce antiviral signaling.
