Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated p53 degradation is generally accepted as the 
major mechanism for p53 regulation; nevertheless, the in vivo significance of 
this function has not been unequivocally established. Here, we have generated an 
Mdm2(Y487A) knockin mouse; Mdm2(Y487A) mutation inactivates Mdm2 E3 ligase 
function without affecting its ability to bind its homolog MdmX. Unexpectedly, 
Mdm2(Y487A/Y487A) mice were viable and developed normally into adulthood. While 
disruption of Mdm2 E3 ligase function resulted in p53 accumulation, p53 
transcriptional activity remained low; however, exposure to sublethal stress 
resulted in hyperactive p53 and p53-dependent mortality in Mdm2(Y487A/Y487A) 
mice. These findings reveal a potentially dispensable nature for Mdm2 E3 ligase 
function in p53 regulation, providing insight that may affect how this pathway 
is targeted therapeutically.

INTRODUCTION

Classically, p53 has been characterized as a tumor suppressor, functioning as a transcription factor for a number of genes important in the regulation of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence ( Levine, 1997 ). In more recent years, a multitude of research has emerged, demonstrating p53 to also be critical in meiosis, reproduction, and metabolism, further broadening the role of p53 ( Levine et al., 2011 ; Lu et al., 2010 ; Vousden and Ryan, 2009 ).

The oncoprotein Mdm2 is generally accepted to function as the primary negative regulator of p53 ( Kruse and Gu, 2009 ; Wade et al., 2010 ). The RING finger domain of Mdm2 confers its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and through this function Mdm2 controls p53 stability, targeting it for export from the nucleus and subsequent degradation by the proteasome ( Haupt et al., 1997 ; Honda et al., 1997 ; Kubbutat et al., 1997 ). In addition to regulating p53 protein levels, Mdm2 also regulates p53 activity by binding via its N-terminus directly to the p53 transactivation domain ( Momand et al., 1992 ; Oliner et al., 1993 ). In vivo , deletion of Mdm2 results in high levels of p53 protein and transcriptional activity, and early embryonic lethality in Mdm2 −/− mice; this phenotype is rescued by concomitant deletion of Trp53 , further demonstrating the essential role of Mdm2 in p53 regulation ( Jones et al., 1995 ; Montes de Oca Luna et al., 1995 ).

MdmX, an Mdm2 homologue, is similarly capable of binding at its N-terminus to the p53 transactivation domain to control p53 activity, however, MdmX does not harbor intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity ( Jackson and Berberich, 2000 ; Poyurovsky et al., 2007 ; Shvarts et al., 1996 ). Similar to Mdm2 −/− mice, p53-dependent early embryonic lethality is also observed in Mdmx −/− mice ( Parant et al., 2001 ). While the early embryonic lethality observed in both Mdm2 and Mdmx KO mouse models suggests that individually Mdm2 and MdmX play unique and critical roles in the regulation of p53 activity; the embryonic lethality observed in two recently developed Mdmx knock-in mouse models that disrupt Mdm2:MdmX heterodimerization suggests that the ability of these two proteins to interact at their respective C-terminal RING finger domains and function collaboratively is essential for p53 regulation ( Huang et al., 2011 ; Pant et al., 2011 ).

Mdm2:MdmX heterodimerization is also disrupted by mutation of the Mdm2 RING finger domain, as observed in the Mdm2 C462A knock-in mouse model ( Clegg et al., 2012 ; Itahana et al., 2007 ). This mutation substitutes cysteine 462 of murine Mdm2 to alanine, thus disrupting Mdm2:MdmX interaction and ablating Mdm2 E3 ligase activity, but maintaining Mdm2:p53 interaction. Homozygous Mdm2 C462A mutation results in early embryonic lethality due to excessive p53 activation, suggesting that Mdm2:p53 binding alone is insufficient for controlling p53 activity, and calling into question the extent to which Mdm2:p53 interaction can regulate p53 activity in vivo ( Itahana et al., 2007 ). Because both Mdm2 E3 ligase activity and Mdm2:MdmX heterodimerization are disrupted by the Mdm2 C462A mutation, the independent effect of loss of each of these RING finger domain functions cannot be deduced from this model. Therefore, the in vivo role of Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, believed to be a critical Mdm2 function in p53 regulation, is yet to be unequivocally addressed. We carried out the current study to address this question.

DISCUSSION

Mdm2 has long been considered the gatekeeper of both p53 stability and activity, and as such, it is critically important to have a thorough understanding of Mdm2-mediated p53 regulation in vivo . It has long been accepted that Mdm2 E3 ligase activity is an essential mechanism for Mdm2-mediated p53 regulation; with this in mind, the most unanticipated finding of the current study is that fully intact Mdm2 E3 ligase activity towards p53 is dispensable in vivo , as demonstrated by the viability, normal development, and lifespan of Mdm2 Y487A/Y487A mice. In vivo , the loss of Mdm2 E3 ligase activity resulted in increased stabilization of p53, but loss of E3 activity alone, without disruption of Mdm2:MdmX heterodimerization, was not sufficient to significantly increase p53 activity. Following activation of the p53 pathway, Mdm2 E3 ligase function becomes essential in controlling p53 abundance and activity.

A number of recent knock-in mouse models, including Mdmx ΔRING , Mdmx C462A , and Mdm2 C462A , have implicated Mdm2:MdmX heterodimerization as an essential component of p53 regulation, in large part due to the embryonic lethality observed when this interaction is disrupted ( Huang et al., 2011 ; Itahana et al., 2007 ; Pant et al., 2011 ). In this regard, the Mdm2 Y487A model provided vital complementary data, further pointing towards Mdm2:MdmX heterodimerization as the key to understanding p53 regulation. Uniquely, the Mdm2 Y487A model allows for analysis of RING finger binding dynamics independent of Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In contrast with previous in vitro data, the study of the Mdm2 Y487A knock-in mouse model suggests that Mdm2 E3 ligase activity is significantly disrupted even in the presence of Mdm2:MdmX heterodimerization ( Okamoto et al., 2009 ; Poyurovsky et al., 2007 ; Uldrijan et al., 2007 ). The apparent discrepancy between Mdm2 Y487A in vitro , which demonstrated near normal levels of p53 stabilization in the presence of MdmX, and in vivo , which demonstrated near, if not complete disruption of p53 degradation, serves as an additional example as to the importance of examining proteins at physiologically relevant levels.

While correlated with the regulation of p53 stability and activity, the mechanism through which the Mdm2:MdmX heterodimer functions in these roles remains inadequately understood. In concert with existing mouse models we believe our data supports the following model: Under unstressed conditions the Mdm2:MdmX heterodimer is able to suppress p53 activity through binding, conceivably by inhibiting p300-mediated p53 acetylation, without Mdm2 mediated p53 degradation. Following stress and the subsequent post-translational modifications to p53, Mdm2, and MdmX, p53 levels and activity are increased. Once p53 has been stabilized and activated, the Mdm2:MdmX heterodimer is no longer sufficient to control p53, and Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity becomes critical for recovery from the p53-mediated stress response ( Figure 7 ).

Although MdmX is generally cytoplasmic, while Mdm2 and p53 are primarily localized to the nucleus, the Mdm2 Y487A mouse further implicates the interaction between Mdm2 and MdmX to be critical in p53 regulation. One explanation for the apparent necessity for Mdm2:MdmX interaction is the role of Mdm2 in translocation of MdmX to the nucleus, as MdmX does not carry its own nuclear localization signal or nuclear export signal ( Li et al., 2002 ; Marine and Jochemsen, 2005 ). Alternatively, the fraction of Mdm2 and p53 localized to the cytoplasm may allow for Mdm2:MdmX heterodimer formation and function; previous data has implicated cytoplasmic MdmX in p53 regulation ( Jimenez et al., 1999 ; Moll et al., 1995 ; Ohtsubo et al., 2009 ). Regardless, further investigation to characterize the mechanism illuminating how Mdm2 and MdmX work together to inhibit p53, despite differences in subcellular localization, remains an important yet unresolved issue in the field.

In addition to implications on the role of Mdm2 E3 ligase activity in the regulation of p53 stability, the Mdm2 Y487A mouse model has also provided additional insight into Mdm2 degradation. While the E3 ligase responsible for Mdm2 degradation in vivo is yet to be identified, this model provides further evidence that under physiological conditions autoubiquitination is not the primary mechanism for Mdm2 degradation. Additional research into the regulation of Mdm2 stability, and identification of E3 ubiquitin ligases with specificity for Mdm2 are important ventures to be explored.

Due to the high rate of p53 mutation, deletion, and misregulation in many cancers, in theory, the p53 pathway is an attractive drug target; however, effective therapeutics utilizing this pathway are not yet found in the clinic ( Danovi et al., 2004 ; Hainaut et al., 1997 ; Momand et al., 1998 ; Wade et al., 2013 ). As brought to light by our study, the basic understanding of p53 regulation in vivo is continuing to evolve. The key findings from this study have important clinical implications, as a number of drugs targeting the Mdm2-p53 pathway, including Nutlin-3a, were developed to target Mdm2:p53 interaction and/or Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 ( Vassilev et al., 2004 ; Wade et al., 2013 ). Although many factors in the tumor microenviroment are known to activate the p53 pathway, it remains to be determined if, as observed in response to DNA damage, disruption of Mdm2 E3 ligase activity will result in p53 hyper-activation in response to the tumor microenvironment itself ( Bieging et al., 2014 ). Along with a number of recent knock-in mouse models, the Mdm2 Y487A mouse points to the significance of Mdm2:MdmX heterodimerization in both p53 stability and activity, and thus disruption of this interaction may be a potent therapeutic target. Focused study of the interaction between Mdm2 and p53 at physiological levels has provided additional insight into both p53 and Mdm2 regulation, which will allow for more effective application of therapeutics targeting this pathway, as well as additional targets for the development of effective drugs.
