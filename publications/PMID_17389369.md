The ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(Fbs1), which contributes to the ubiquitination 
of glycoproteins, is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated 
degradation pathway. In SCF ubiquitin ligases, a diverse array of F-box proteins 
confers substrate specificity. Fbs1/Fbx2, a member of the F-box protein family, 
recognizes high-mannose oligosaccharides. To elucidate the structural basis of 
SCF(Fbs1) function, we determined the crystal structures of the Skp1-Fbs1 
complex and the sugar-binding domain (SBD) of the Fbs1-glycoprotein complex. The 
mechanistic model indicated by the structures appears to be well conserved among 
the SCF ubiquitin ligases. The structure of the SBD-glycoprotein complex 
indicates that the SBD primarily recognizes Man(3)GlcNAc(2), thereby explaining 
the broad activity of the enzyme against various glycoproteins. Comparison of 
two crystal structures of the Skp1-Fbs1 complex revealed the relative motion of 
a linker segment between the F-box and the SBD domains, which might underlie the 
ability of the complex to recognize different acceptor lysine residues for 
ubiquitination.
