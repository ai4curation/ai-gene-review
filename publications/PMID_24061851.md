The localization of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged HSP70 proteins was 
employed to identify stress-sensitive sites in human neurons following 
temperature elevation. Stable lines of human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells were 
established that expressed YFP-tagged protein products of the human inducible 
HSP70 genes HSPA6 (HSP70B') and HSPA1A (HSP70-1). Following a brief period of 
thermal stress, YFP-tagged HSPA6 and HSPA1A rapidly appeared at centrioles in 
the cytoplasm of human neuronal cells, with HSPA6 demonstrating a more prolonged 
signal compared to HSPA1A. Each centriole is composed of a distal end and a 
proximal end, the latter linking the centriole doublet. The YFP-tagged HSP70 
proteins targeted the proximal end of centrioles (identified by γ-tubulin 
marker) rather than the distal end (centrin marker). Centrioles play key roles 
in cellular polarity and migration during neuronal differentiation. The proximal 
end of the centriole, which is involved in centriole stabilization, may be 
stress-sensitive in post-mitotic, differentiating human neurons.
