In the fungal phylum Ascomycota, the ability to cause disease in plants and 
animals has been gained and lost repeatedly during phylogenesis. In 
monocotyledonous barley, loss-of-function mlo alleles result in effective 
immunity against the Ascomycete Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, the causal 
agent of powdery mildew disease. However, mlo-based disease resistance has been 
considered a barley-specific phenomenon to date. Here, we demonstrate a 
conserved requirement for MLO proteins in powdery mildew pathogenesis in the 
dicotyledonous plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Epistasis analysis showed 
that mlo resistance in A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules 
ethylene, jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin, glycosyl 
hydrolase and ABC transporter. These findings imply that a common host cell 
entry mechanism of powdery mildew fungi evolved once and at least 200 million 
years ago, suggesting that within the Erysiphales (powdery mildews) the ability 
to cause disease has been a stable trait throughout phylogenesis.
