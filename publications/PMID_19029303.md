The RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 (IGF-II mRNA binding protein 1) stabilizes the 
c-myc RNA by associating with the Coding Region instability Determinant (CRD). 
If and how other proteins cooperate with IGF2BP1 in promoting stabilization of 
the c-myc mRNA via the CRD remained elusive. Here, we identify various 
RNA-binding proteins that associate with IGF2BP1 in an RNA-dependent fashion. 
Four of these proteins (HNRNPU, SYNCRIP, YBX1, and DHX9) were essential to 
ensure stabilization of the c-myc mRNA via the CRD. These factors associate with 
IGF2BP1 in a CRD-dependent manner, co-distribute with IGF2BP1 in non-polysomal 
fractions comprising c-myc mRNA, and colocalize with IGF2BP1 in the cytoplasm. A 
selective shift of relative c-myc mRNA levels to the polysomal fraction is 
observed upon IGF2BP1 knockdown. These findings suggest that IGF2BP1 in complex 
with at least four proteins promotes CRD-mediated mRNA stabilization. Complex 
formation at the CRD presumably limits the transfer of c-myc mRNA to the 
polysomal fraction and subsequent translation-coupled decay.
