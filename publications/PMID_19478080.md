In mammals, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide 
mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT-1) constitute a nuclear NAD(+) 
salvage pathway which regulates the functions of NAD(+)-dependent enzymes such 
as the protein deacetylase SIRT1. One of the major functions of SIRT1 is to 
regulate target gene transcription through modification of chromatin-associated 
proteins. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which 
NAD(+) biosynthetic enzymes regulate SIRT1 activity to control gene 
transcription in the nucleus. In this study we show that stable short hairpin 
RNA-mediated knockdown of NAMPT or NMNAT-1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells reduces 
total cellular NAD(+) levels and alters global patterns of gene expression. 
Furthermore, we show that SIRT1 plays a key role in mediating the gene 
regulatory effects of NAMPT and NMNAT-1. Specifically, we found that SIRT1 binds 
to the promoters of genes commonly regulated by NAMPT, NMNAT-1, and SIRT1 and 
that SIRT1 histone deacetylase activity is regulated by NAMPT and NMNAT-1 at 
these promoters. Most significantly, NMNAT-1 interacts with, and is recruited to 
target gene promoters by SIRT1. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism for 
the direct control of SIRT1 deacetylase activity at a set of target gene 
promoters by NMNAT-1. This mechanism, in collaboration with NAMPT-dependent 
regulation of nuclear NAD(+) production, establishes an important pathway for 
transcription regulation by NAD(+).
