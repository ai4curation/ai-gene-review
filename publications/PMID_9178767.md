PAX2 is a member of the paired box family of genes with an important role in 
kidney, genital tract and eye development. Another gene essential for kidney and 
genital tract development is the Wilms tumour gene, WT1. PAX2 and WT1 encode 
transcription factors expressed during fetal kidney development in patterns that 
overlap both spatially and temporally. The overlap of PAX2 and WT1 expression in 
fetal kidney prompted us to determine whether PAX2 regulates the WT1 gene. To 
investigate this possibility, the WT1 promoter and a series of WT1 promoter 
deletion fragments were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, and used in 
co-transfection experiments with PAX2 expression constructs. PAX2 transactivated 
the WT1 promoter up to 35-fold in CHO-K1 cells, and from four- to sevenfold in 
293 cells. Two regions of the WT1 promoter were required in the same promoter 
construct for efficient transactivation by PAX2 in CHO-K1 cells, and purified 
recombinant PAX2 protein was found to bind to two sites in the WT1 promoter, at 
-205/-230 and +377/+402. Removal of WT1 promoter sequences containing the 
-205/-230, or +377/+402 binding sites abolished transactivation of the WT1 
promoter by PAX2 in CHO-K1 cells, and had a differential effect on 
transactivation of the WT1 promoter in 293 cells, depending on the PAX2 isoform 
used. A fragment containing the -205/-230 site alone could be transactivated by 
PAX2. These findings suggest that PAX2 is a tissue-specific modulator of WT1 
expression, and is involved in cell growth control via WT1.
