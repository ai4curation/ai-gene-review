Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized 
by increased incidence of benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin. 
Mutations that activate the protooncogene ras, such as loss of Nf1, cooperate 
with inactivating mutations at the p53 tumor suppressor gene during malignant 
transformation. One hundred percent of mice harboring null Nf1 and p53 alleles 
in cis synergize to develop soft tissue sarcomas between 3 and 7 months of age. 
These sarcomas exhibit loss of heterozygosity at both gene loci and express 
phenotypic traits characteristic of neural crest derivatives and human NF1 
malignancies.
