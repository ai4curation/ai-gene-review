The activity of proteins is typically regulated by secondary modifications and 
by interactions with other partners, resulting in the formation of protein 
complexes whose functions depend on the participating proteins. Accordingly, it 
is of central importance to monitor the presence of interaction complexes as 
well as their localization, thus providing information about the types of cells 
where the proteins are located and in what sub-cellular compartment these 
interactions occur. Several methods for visualizing protein interactions in situ 
have been developed during the last decade. These methods in most cases involve 
genetic constructs, and they have been successfully used in assays of living 
cell maintained in tissue culture, but they cannot easily be implemented in 
studies of clinical specimens. For such samples, affinity reagents like 
antibodies can be used to target the interacting proteins. In this review we 
will describe the in situ proximity ligation assays (in situ PLA), a method that 
is suitable for visualizing protein interactions in both tissue sections and in 
vitro cell lines, and we discuss research tasks when this or other method may be 
selected.
