Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that 
associates dynamically with various co-chaperones during its chaperone cycle. 
Here we analyzed the role of the activating co-chaperone Aha1 in the progression 
of the yeast Hsp90 chaperone cycle and identified a critical ternary Hsp90 
complex containing the co-chaperones Aha1 and Cpr6. Aha1 accelerates the 
intrinsically slow conformational transitions of Hsp90 to an N-terminally 
associated state but does not fully close the nucleotide-binding pocket yet. 
Cpr6 increases the affinity between Aha1 and Hsp90 and further stimulates the 
Hsp90 ATPase activity. Synergistically, Aha1 and Cpr6 displace the inhibitory 
co-chaperone Sti1 from Hsp90. To complete the cycle, Aha1 is released by the 
co-chaperone p23. Thus, at distinct steps during the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, 
co-chaperones selectively trap statistically distributed Hsp90 conformers and 
thus turn Hsp90 into a deterministic machine.
