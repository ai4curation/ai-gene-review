Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) gene cause PARK6 familial 
Parkinsonism. To decipher the role of PINK1 in pathogenesis of Parkinson's 
disease (PD), researchers need to identify protein substrates of PINK1 kinase 
activity that govern neuronal survival, and establish whether aberrant 
regulation and inactivation of PINK1 contribute to both familial Parkinsonism 
and idiopathic PD. These studies should take into account the several unique 
structural and functional features of PINK1. First PINK1 is a rare example of a 
protein kinase with a predicted mitochondrial-targeting sequence and a possible 
resident mitochondrial function. Second, bioinformatic analysis reveals unique 
insert regions within the kinase domain that are potentially involved in 
regulation of kinase activity, substrate selectivity and stability of PINK1. 
Third, the C-terminal region contains functional motifs governing kinase 
activity and substrate selectivity. Fourth, accumulating evidence suggests that 
PINK1 interacts with other signaling proteins implicated in PD pathogenesis and 
mitochondrial dysfunction. The most prominent examples are the E3 ubiquitin 
ligase Parkin, the mitochondrial protease high temperature requirement serine 
protease 2 and the mitochondrial chaperone tumor necrosis factor 
receptor-associated protein 1. How PINK1 may regulate these proteins to maintain 
neuronal survival is unclear. This review describes the unique structural 
features of PINK1 and their possible roles in governing mitochondrial import, 
processing, kinase activity, substrate selectivity and stability of PINK1. Based 
upon the findings of previous studies of PINK1 function in cell lines and animal 
models, we propose a model on the neuroprotective mechanism of PINK1. This model 
may serve as a conceptual framework for future investigation into the molecular 
basis of PD pathogenesis.
