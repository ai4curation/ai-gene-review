Accumulation of repair proteins on damaged chromosomes is required to restore 
genomic integrity. However, the mechanisms of protein retention at the most 
destructive chromosomal lesions, the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), are poorly 
understood. We show that RNF8, a RING-finger ubiquitin ligase, rapidly assembles 
at DSBs via interaction of its FHA domain with the phosphorylated adaptor 
protein MDC1. This is accompanied by an increase in DSB-associated 
ubiquitylations and followed by accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 repair proteins. 
Knockdown of RNF8 or disruption of its FHA or RING domains impaired 
DSB-associated ubiquitylation and inhibited retention of 53BP1 and BRCA1 at the 
DSB sites. In addition, we show that RNF8 can ubiquitylate histone H2A and H2AX, 
and that its depletion sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation. These data 
suggest that MDC1-mediated and RNF8-executed histone ubiquitylation protects 
genome integrity by licensing the DSB-flanking chromatin to concentrate repair 
factors near the DNA lesions.
