Cross-linking of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) induces tyrosine 
phosphorylation of Shc, which is believed to lead to the activation of Ras. 
Previous work has shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc forms complexes with 
another adapter protein, Grb2, and the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor 
SOS. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Shc by the hematopoietic 
cell-specific tyrosine kinase Syk induces binding of Grb2 to Shc, suggesting 
that Syk phosphorylates Shc in stimulated B cells. Surprisingly, 
Syk-phosphorylated Shc possesses two Grb2 binding sites rather than the one site 
that has been previously reported. Both of these sites are required for 
efficient formation of Shc-Grb2-SOS complexes in vitro and in vivo. We suggest 
that two Grb2 proteins anchored by a single Shc protein bind simultaneously to 
one SOS molecule, resulting in a complex that is more stable than a complex 
containing only a single Grb2 protein bound to one SOS molecule. This model is 
consistent with our observation that BCR stimulation greatly increases the 
amount of SOS associated with Grb2.

Abstract

Cross-linking of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, which is believed to lead to the activation of Ras. Previous work has shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc forms complexes with another adapter protein, Grb2, and the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Shc by the hematopoietic cell-specific tyrosine kinase Syk induces binding of Grb2 to Shc, suggesting that Syk phosphorylates Shc in stimulated B cells. Surprisingly, Syk-phosphorylated Shc possesses two Grb2 binding sites rather than the one site that has been previously reported. Both of these sites are required for efficient formation of Shc-Grb2-SOS complexes in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that two Grb2 proteins anchored by a single Shc protein bind simultaneously to one SOS molecule, resulting in a complex that is more stable than a complex containing only a single Grb2 protein bound to one SOS molecule. This model is consistent with our observation that BCR stimulation greatly increases the amount of SOS associated with Grb2.
