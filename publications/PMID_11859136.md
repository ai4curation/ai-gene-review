The interaction of C1q with endothelial cells elicits a multiplicity of biologic 
responses. Although these responses are presumed to be mediated by the 
interaction of C1q with endothelial cell surface proteins, the identity of the 
participants is not known. In this study we examined the roles of two C1q 
binding proteins, cC1q-R/calreticulin and gC1q-R/p33, in C1q-mediated adhesion 
and spreading of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC). When 
HDMVEC were cultured in microtiter plate wells coated with concentrations of C1q 
ranging from 0 to 50 microg/ml, a specific and dose-dependent adhesion and 
spreading was observed. The extent of adhesion and spreading was similar to the 
adhesion seen on collagen-coated wells. Spreading (68 +/- 12%) and to a moderate 
extent adhesion (47 +/- 9%) were inhibited by anti-gC1q-R mAb 60.11. Similar 
effects were noted with polyclonal anti-cC1q-R but not with control nonimmune 
IgG. The two Abs had a slight additive effect (75 +/- 13% inhibition) when mixed 
together in the proportion of 100 microg/ml anti-gC1q-R and 30 microg/ml 
anti-cC1q-R. More importantly, a 100% inhibition of spreading, but not adhesion, 
to C1q-coated wells was observed when HDMVEC were cultured in the presence of 30 
microM of the peptide GRRGDSP but not GRRGESP. Furthermore, while anti-beta(1) 
integrin Ab blocked both adhesion and spreading, anti-alpha(5) integrin blocked 
only spreading and not adhesion. Ag capture ELISA of endothelial cell membrane 
proteins using polyclonal anti-gC1q-R showed the presence of not only beta(1) 
and alpha(5) integrins but also CD44. Taken together these results suggest that 
endothelial cell adhesion and spreading require the cooperation of both C1qRs 
and beta(1) integrins and possibly other membrane-spanning molecules.
