## Abstract

Sequence of a cellulase gene of the thermophilic bacterium Clostridium 
thermocellum.

Béguin P, Cornet P, Aubert JP.

The nucleotide sequence of the celA gene, encoding the extracellular 
endoglucanase A of Clostridium thermocellum, was determined and compared with 
the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. The mature protein 
appeared to be extended by a signal sequence of 32 amino acids. A segment of 23 
amino acids was duplicated at the COOH-terminal end of the protein. The putative 
GUG initiation codon was preceded by an AGGAGG sequence, typical of procaryotic 
ribosomal binding sites. The segment of DNA presumably specifying 
transcriptional initiation contained a high percentage of adenine and thymine 
residues, including an adenine-thymine tract extending over 54 base pairs.
