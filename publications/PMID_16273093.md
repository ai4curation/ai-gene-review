Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; also called ErbB1) and its 
relatives initiate one of the most well-studied signalling networks, there is 
not yet a genome-wide view of even the earliest step in this pathway: 
recruitment of proteins to the activated receptors. Here we use protein 
microarrays comprising virtually every Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine 
binding (PTB) domain encoded in the human genome to measure the equilibrium 
dissociation constant of each domain for 61 peptides representing physiological 
sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on the four ErbB receptors. This involved 
77,592 independent biochemical measurements and provided a quantitative protein 
interaction network that reveals many new interactions, including ones that fall 
outside of our current view of domain selectivity. By slicing through the 
network at different affinity thresholds, we found surprising differences 
between the receptors. Most notably, EGFR and ErbB2 become markedly more 
promiscuous as the threshold is lowered, whereas ErbB3 does not. Because EGFR 
and ErbB2 are overexpressed in many human cancers, our results suggest that the 
extent to which promiscuity changes with protein concentration may contribute to 
the oncogenic potential of receptor tyrosine kinases, and perhaps other 
signalling proteins as well.

Suppressor screens can identify genetic modifiers of biochemical pathways but generally require that the suppressed mutant be viable and fertile. We developed a screening method that obviated this requirement and enabled the identification of mutations that partially suppressed the early developmental arrest and lethality caused by loss of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ortholog LET-23 in Caenorhabditis elegans. We chemically mutagenized animals carrying the loss-of-function allele let-23(sy15), recovered let-23(sy15) homozygotes that escaped early developmental arrest but were nevertheless inviable, and sequenced their genomes. Testing of candidate causal mutations identified 11 genes that, when mutated, mitigated the early lethality caused by loss of EGF signaling. These included genes encoding homologs of the small GTPase Ras (let-60), which is a downstream effector of LET-23, and of regulators of the small GTPase Rho, including the homolog of the phosphotyrosine-binding protein TENSIN (tns-1). We also recovered suppressing mutations in genes encoding nuclear proteins that protect against DNA damage, including the homolog of MSH4 (him-14). Genetic experiments were consistent with the repression of Rho activity or the activation of the DNA damage response compensating for the loss of EGF signaling. This sequencing-based, whole-animal screening method may be adapted to other organisms to enable the identification of mutations for which the phenotype does not allow the recovery of viable animals.
