Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; also called ErbB1) and its 
relatives initiate one of the most well-studied signalling networks, there is 
not yet a genome-wide view of even the earliest step in this pathway: 
recruitment of proteins to the activated receptors. Here we use protein 
microarrays comprising virtually every Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine 
binding (PTB) domain encoded in the human genome to measure the equilibrium 
dissociation constant of each domain for 61 peptides representing physiological 
sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on the four ErbB receptors. This involved 
77,592 independent biochemical measurements and provided a quantitative protein 
interaction network that reveals many new interactions, including ones that fall 
outside of our current view of domain selectivity. By slicing through the 
network at different affinity thresholds, we found surprising differences 
between the receptors. Most notably, EGFR and ErbB2 become markedly more 
promiscuous as the threshold is lowered, whereas ErbB3 does not. Because EGFR 
and ErbB2 are overexpressed in many human cancers, our results suggest that the 
extent to which promiscuity changes with protein concentration may contribute to 
the oncogenic potential of receptor tyrosine kinases, and perhaps other 
signalling proteins as well.

Abstract

Suppressor screens can identify genetic modifiers of biochemical pathways but generally require that the suppressed mutant be viable and fertile. We developed a screening method that obviated this requirement and enabled the identification of mutations that partially suppressed the early developmental arrest and lethality caused by loss of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ortholog LET-23 in Caenorhabditis elegans . We chemically mutagenized animals carrying the loss-of-function allele let-23(sy15) , recovered let-23(sy15) homozygotes that escaped early developmental arrest but were nevertheless inviable, and sequenced their genomes. Testing of candidate causal mutations identified 11 genes that, when mutated, mitigated the early lethality caused by loss of EGF signaling. These included genes encoding homologs of the small GTPase Ras ( let-60 ), which is a downstream effector of LET-23, and of regulators of the small GTPase Rho, including the homolog of the phosphotyrosine-binding protein TENSIN ( tns-1 ). We also recovered suppressing mutations in genes encoding nuclear proteins that protect against DNA damage, including the homolog of MSH4 ( him-14 ). Genetic experiments were consistent with the repression of Rho activity or the activation of the DNA damage response compensating for the loss of EGF signaling. This sequencing-based, whole-animal screening method may be adapted to other organisms to enable the identification of mutations for which the phenotype does not allow the recovery of viable animals.

Introduction

Experimental genetics is a powerful tool for the discovery of gene functions and interactions. Forward genetic screens allow the nonbiased identification of genes that prevent or contribute to a phenotype of interest. Advantages in genome sequencing have revolutionized the identification of causative mutations in mutant strains ( 1 ) and can make large-scale surveys of mutations in single-celled, haploid organisms possible ( 2 ), but have not similarly been useful in the diploid cells of metazoans. Genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening have made it possible to survey whole animal genomes for functional loci ( 3 - 5 ). Although they are powerful, these methods cannot match the versatility offered by chemical mutagenesis, which makes it possible to probe a broad range of effects on the functions of whole genes, to detect contributions made by specific domains within their protein products, and to discover coding changes analogous to mutations detected in human disease. Here, we describe a way to take advantage of both chemical mutagenesis and genome sequencing in a whole animal.

Since its genetics were first described fifty years ago ( 6 ), the free-living soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been a particularly productive tool for experimental geneticists, who have taken advantage of its selfing hermaphroditism, small size, rapid generation time, and easy cryopreservation ( 7 , 8 ). Genetic screens in C. elegans have led to notable discoveries including the foundations of our mechanistic understanding of programmed cell death, the elucidation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Ras signaling, and the discoveries of RNAi and of endogenous microRNAs ( 9 - 13 ). Traditionally genetic screens in C. elegans have been performed using chemical mutagenesis; other methods include mutagenesis using both endogenous and engineered transposons, as well as RNAi libraries ( 14 ). Each of these approaches offers advantages: RNAi libraries identify the responsible gene immediately, and transposon mutagenesis tags the affected gene to rapidly identify the mutation responsible. However, chemical mutagenesis is enduringly popular because it is particularly versatile. The effects of a mutant allele can be more consistent than results from RNAi treatment, and a broad range of mutations can be recovered: strong or weak loss-of-function changes, gain-of-function and neomorphic mutations, conditional alleles, or mutations affecting only specific functions of a gene product can all result from the random, broadly distributed nucleotide changes induced by chemical mutagenesis.

Screens using chemical mutagenesis have required the recovery and propagation of viable, fertile animals carrying the mutant allele, either from the progeny of the phenotypic animal itself (a “nonclonal” screen) or from a “clonal” screen that enables the recovery of the mutant allele from the siblings of phenotypic animals. The nonclonal screen allows large numbers of mutagenized genomes to be efficiently screened, but only if the phenotypic mutant produces viable progeny. The clonal screen solves this limitation, allowing the recovery of causal mutations when phenotypic animals cannot be propagated, either because of the effects of the mutation or because the assay performed to detect their phenotype is destructive, and allows the scoring of phenotypes at a population level. However, clonal screens are labor- and resource-intensive, and inefficient. Here, we present our results from a different approach to chemical mutagenesis screening that we have called an “aclonal screen,” in which the genomes of inviable phenotypic animals were sequenced, identifying candidate mutations that were subsequently reintroduced to the genome to test whether doing so would reiterate the phenotype of the strain that had contained them ( Fig. 1A ).

We used this method to identify mutant animals that had partially managed to suppress the phenotypes caused by loss of let-23 , which encodes the C. elegans ortholog of the EGF receptor (EGFR) ( 15 ). Strong loss-of-function mutations in let-23 recessively cause strict, fully penetrant phenotypes of paralysis and early larval lethality ( 16 , 17 ). LET-23 acts upstream of Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide signaling pathways, and increased Ras signaling can enable animals lacking let-23 to develop all the way through adulthood but does not suppress the sterility caused by loss of let-23 ( 18 ). This suggests that modifiers of Ras-MAPK pathway signaling could delay the lethality caused by loss of let-23 while failing to result in viable, fertile animals that could be used to establish a mutant strain, and so could not be recovered in a nonclonal screen. In our screens we recovered animals that escaped the let-23 phenotype of death early in larval development but did not survive to become fertile adults. Each candidate mutant from the screen was converted into a whole-animal lysate that was used to generate a sequencing library without amplification of the genomic DNA. From 86 such animals, 68 genomes were successfully analyzed, identifying 4,154 newly generated homozygous coding changes consistent with the effects of the chemical mutagen. Following analysis to identify candidate causal mutations, homology-directed repair was used to introduce 12 mutations identified in suppressed animals into the C. elegans genome, and 13 mutations that were available in existing C. elegans strains were obtained. These assays targeted a total of 19 genes and identified 10 new loci as modifiers of LET-23 signaling along with one established modifier: the KRAS ortholog let-60 . We identified one mutation affecting let-60 codon 164, which corresponds to a codon in KRAS that is affected in some KRAS mutations associated with human colorectal and endometrial cancers ( 19 , 20 ). The newly identified LET-23 pathway modifiers include din-1 , the homolog of Drosophila melanogaster split ends ; the genes encoding RHGF-2 and MPZ-1, homologs of the human Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) PLEKHG6 and the scaffolding protein PATJ, respectively, which interact with one another to regulate Rho; mutations specifically affecting a previously unstudied domain of the Tensin ortholog TNS-1, which we show acted through a negative regulator of Rho; and him-14 , which encodes a member of the MutS family of proteins that act as suppressors of epithelial cancer. These results indicate that sequencing-based genetic screens in C. elegans can identify previously unknown modifiers even of well-known and deeply studied pathways of known medical importance.
