Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; also called ErbB1) and its 
relatives initiate one of the most well-studied signalling networks, there is 
not yet a genome-wide view of even the earliest step in this pathway: 
recruitment of proteins to the activated receptors. Here we use protein 
microarrays comprising virtually every Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine 
binding (PTB) domain encoded in the human genome to measure the equilibrium 
dissociation constant of each domain for 61 peptides representing physiological 
sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on the four ErbB receptors. This involved 
77,592 independent biochemical measurements and provided a quantitative protein 
interaction network that reveals many new interactions, including ones that fall 
outside of our current view of domain selectivity. By slicing through the 
network at different affinity thresholds, we found surprising differences 
between the receptors. Most notably, EGFR and ErbB2 become markedly more 
promiscuous as the threshold is lowered, whereas ErbB3 does not. Because EGFR 
and ErbB2 are overexpressed in many human cancers, our results suggest that the 
extent to which promiscuity changes with protein concentration may contribute to 
the oncogenic potential of receptor tyrosine kinases, and perhaps other 
signalling proteins as well.
