Get3, Get4, and Get5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae participate in the insertion of 
tail-anchored proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We elucidated 
the interaction between Get4 and Get5 and investigated their interaction with 
Get3 and a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, Sgt2. Based on 
co-immunoprecipitation and crystallographic studies, Get4 and Get5 formed a 
tight complex, suggesting that they constitute subunits of a larger complex. In 
contrast, although Get3 interacted physically with the Get4-Get5 complex, low 
amounts of Get3 co-precipitated with Get5, implying a transient interaction 
between Get3 and Get4-Get5. Sgt2 also interacted with Get5, although the amount 
of Sgt2 that co-precipitated with Get5 varied. Moreover, GET3, GET4, and GET5 
interacted genetically with molecular chaperone YDJ1, suggesting that chaperones 
might also be involved in the insertion of tail-anchored proteins.
