Abstract

Parafibromin is a tumor suppressor protein encoded by HRPT2 , a gene recently implicated in the hereditary hyperparathyroidism–jaw tumor syndrome, parathyroid cancer, and a subset of kindreds with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism. Human parafibromin binds to RNA polymerase II as part of a PAF1 transcriptional regulatory complex. The physiologic targets of parafibromin and the mechanism by which its loss of function can lead to neoplastic transformation are poorly understood. We show here that RNA interference with the expression of parafibromin or Paf1 stimulates cell proliferation and increases levels of the c-myc proto-oncogene product, a DNA-binding protein and established regulator of cell growth. This effect results from both c-myc protein stabilization and activation of the c-myc promoter, without alleviation of the c-myc transcriptional pause. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates the occupancy of the c-myc promoter by parafibromin and other PAF1 complex subunits in native cells. Knockdown of c-myc blocks the proliferative effect of RNA interference with parafibromin or Paf1 expression. These experiments provide a previously uncharacterized mechanism for the anti-proliferative action of the parafibromin tumor suppressor protein resulting from PAF1 complex-mediated inhibition of the c-myc proto-oncogene.

Results

To better understand the normal cellular function of the parafibromin tumor suppressor protein in the context of the transcriptional regulatory PAF1 complex, RNA interference was used to inhibit the expression of endogenous parafibromin and Paf1 protein. The impact of this RNA interference on the expression of several components of the PAF1 complex and cellular proliferation in HeLa cells was determined ( Fig. 1 ). Transfection of cells with small interfering duplex RNAs (siRNA) targeting two different sequences of the HRPT2 gene transcript inhibited the expression of endogenous parafibromin in HeLa cells as previously shown ( Fig. 1 A ) ( 10 ). In addition, treatment of cells with HRPT2 -targeted siRNAs also inhibited expression of endogenous Paf1 and Leo1 proteins, both also components of the PAF1 transcriptional regulatory complex, compared to control ( Fig. 1 A ) ( 7 – 9 ). Similarly, transfection with Paf1-targeted siRNAs directed against two different Paf1 sequences both inhibited Paf1 (as expected) and Leo1 expression, although the Paf1-targeted gene silencing had little effect on parafibromin expression ( Fig. 1 B ). Thus RNA interference employing HRPT2 - and Paf1 -targeted siRNA appeared to be an effective strategy for the knockdown of multiple protein components of the endogenous PAF1 complex.

The effect of anti- HRPT2 - and anti- Paf1 -directed siRNA treatment on cell proliferation was studied in two different assays. Exponentially dividing HeLa cells treated with control, HRPT2 -, or Paf1 -directed siRNAs and stained with propidium iodide were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and the proportion of cells in G 1 , S, and G 2 /M phases estimated ( Fig. 1 C and D ). Treatment with HRPT2 siRNA-1 or -2 or with Paf1 siRNA-1 or -2 construct caused a significant increase in the proportion of cells in S phase with a corresponding decrease in the number of cells in G 1 ( Fig. 1 D ). These results confirm the findings of Yart, et al. ( 8 ). An independent assay of cell proliferation was used to compare the control, HRPT2 -, and Paf1 siRNA-treated cells and demonstrated that the siRNA-mediated knockdown of either PAF1 complex component increased the rate of cellular proliferation over control in both HeLa cells ( Fig. 1 E ) and primary human fibroblasts ( Fig. 1 F ). Treatment of human osteosarcoma-derived U2-OS cells with either HRPT2 or Paf1 siRNA also stimulated cell proliferation [ supporting information (SI) Fig. S1 ]. These results were consistent with previous findings that transfection of wild-type, but not clinically significant patient-derived mutants of, parafibromin strongly inhibited cell growth in proliferation assays ( 11 , 12 ).

The c-myc proto-oncogene encodes a transcription factor of the basic helix–loop–helix/leucine zipper family strongly implicated in the control of cell growth. Because siRNA-mediated knockdown of both HRPT2 - and Paf1 -stimulated cellular proliferation, we checked the effect of such siRNA treatment on cellular levels of the c-myc proto-oncogene by immunoblotting of HeLa cell lysates ( Fig. 2 A ). Both pairs of HRPT2 - and Paf1 -directed siRNAs elevated the level of c-myc protein above the control ( Fig. 2 A–C ). C-myc protein levels were also up-regulated in human U2-OS cells or primary human fibroblasts ( Fig. 2 D ) treated with either HRPT2 - or Paf1 -targeted siRNAs.

The c-myc protein is normally short-lived but can be stabilized by mitogenic stimuli like growth factors ( 13 ) and p 21 Ras ( 14 ). To determine if c-myc protein up-regulation in response to knockdown of HRPT2 and Paf1 might result from protein stabilization, the half-life of c-myc was estimated in HeLa cells treated with cycloheximide and either control, HRPT2 - or Paf1 -directed siRNAs ( Fig. 3 A and B ). The expression of c-myc protein was examined at multiple time points between 0 and 100 min and normalized by reference to the level of actin in each sample. As expected at t = 0, c-myc proteins levels were higher in cells treated with HRPT2 - or Paf1 -directed siRNAs compared to control ( Fig. 3 A and B ), and the siRNAs were effective at reducing their respective targeted proteins ( Fig. 3 C ). The natural logarithm of the actin-normalized c-myc protein expression level (relative to t = 0) was plotted over time, and linear regression analysis used to estimate the c-myc protein half-life assuming first-order kinetics ( Fig. 3 D and E ). The estimated half-life of c-myc was greater upon treatment with either HRPT2 - or Paf1 -directed siRNAs compared to control ( Fig. 3 D ; control siRNA: r 2 = 0.79, c-myc half-life 16 ± 15 min; HRPT2 -siRNA: r 2 = 0.85, c-myc half-life 47 ± 19 min, p = NS vs. control), ( Fig. 3 E ; control siRNA: r 2 = 0.91, c-myc half-life 15 ± 8 min; Paf1 -siRNA: r 2 = 1.0, c-myc half-life 43 ± 2 min, P < 0.005 vs. control), although the difference between HRPT2 -siRNA and its control did not achieve statistical significance ( Fig. 3 D ). Taken together, these data suggest that protein stabilization contributes to the up-regulation of c-myc expression resulting from HRPT2 or Paf1 knockdown.

Transcriptional activation of c-myc in response to the siRNA-mediated silencing of HRPT2 or Paf1 is a potential alternative mechanism that could also result in increased c-myc protein expression. This possibility is especially relevant since the human PAF1 complex is physically associated with, and known to regulate the activity of, RNA polymerase II ( 7 – 9 ). Furthermore, other tumor suppressors such as p53 are known to repress the transcription of c-myc ( 15 ). Analysis of c-myc transcript levels by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in HeLa cells treated with HRPT2 - and Paf1 -targeted siRNA at two different times points showed a significant elevation in response to treatment over control ( Fig. S2 a and b ). The effect of both anti- HRPT2 siRNA treatments was evident at 24 h, while treatment with the anti- Paf1 siRNA did not produce significant elevation of c-myc transcript until 48 h ( Fig. S2 a and b ). These results would be consistent with transcriptional activation of c-myc resulting from knockdown of parafibromin or Paf1.

The expression of c-myc is controlled in many cell types by a block in the elongation of primary transcripts mediated by transcriptional pause occurring at a locus near the exon 1-intron 1 boundary ( 16 , 17 ). The Paf1 complex has been implicated in RNA Pol II transcriptional elongation ( 7 , 18 ). We therefore looked for evidence that the endogenous Paf1 complex might be involved in the transcriptional arrest of c-myc at the exon 1-intron 1 junction by treatment of HeLa cells with HRPT2 - and Paf1 -targeted siRNAs and quantitative determination of exon 1- and exon 2-containing transcripts by quantitative RT-PCR ( Fig. S3 a and b ). The level of c-myc exon 1-containing transcripts was significantly increased by either siRNA treatment ( Fig. S3 a ) while the quantity of c-myc exon 2-containing transcripts was increased significantly only by anti- HRPT2 siRNA with the increase by anti- Paf1 siRNA not quite achieving statistical significance ( Fig. S3 b ). The ratio of exon 1- to exon 2-containing transcripts resulting from either HRPT2 - or Paf1 -targeted siRNA treatment did not differ from control, however, suggesting that relief of the c-myc transcriptional pause was not a major mechanism of c-myc up-regulation resulting from the knockdown of endogenous Paf1 complex components ( Fig. S3 c ).

To further examine the mechanism of transcriptional activation of c-myc upon knockdown of parafibromin or Paf1, three fragments of human genomic DNA comprising various lengths of upstream regulatory sequence and extending through the 1st intron of the c-myc gene were subcloned into the pGL3 Basic luciferase reporter construct to generate the −836/+2193, −63/+2193 and + 613/+2193 c-myc promoter reporters ( Fig. S2 c ). Position −63 is just upstream of the P1 and P2 promoter start sites, while position +613 is just downstream of the transcriptional pause sites at the exon 1-intron 1 junction. Treatment of primary human fibroblasts with HRPT2 -directed siRNA significantly elevated the promoter activity of the −836/+2193 and −63/+2193 c-myc luciferase reporters over control but had no effect on the low basal activity of the +613/+2193 luciferase reporter ( Fig. S2 d ). Knockdown of endogenous Paf1 gave similar results except that the activation of the −63/+2193 c-myc luciferase reporter did not achieve statistical significance ( Fig. S2 d ). In HeLa cells, as in primary fibroblasts, both HRPT2 - and Paf1 -directed siRNA treatments activated the −836/+2193 c-myc luciferase reporter ( Fig. S2 e ). No effect of the siRNA treatments was seen on the promoter-less pGL3 Basic vector alone ( Fig. S4 ). The results with the luciferase reporters suggest the principal effects of the endogenous PAF1 complex on c-myc transcription occur in the upstream regulatory region distant from the transcriptional pause site.

Activation of the c-myc promoter that results from knockdown of either HRPT2 or Paf1 implies a transcriptional inhibitory role for the endogenous PAF1 complex likely resulting from physical association of the complex with c-myc promoter elements. To test this hypothesis, the occupancy of the c-myc promoter and internal gene regions by parafibromin was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. ChIP with control rabbit IgG gave no signal with primers targeting either a region of the c-myc promoter just 3′ to the transcription start site (P2, +77), or a more internal region of c-myc (+1572) in human HeLa cells ( Fig. S5 a ). Specific signal with both pairs of c-myc - directed primers was detected, however, when ChIP used anti-parafibromin antibodies ( Fig. S5 a ). Anti-Paf1 and anti-Leo1 antibodies also gave a strong positive signal in the ChIP analysis employing c-myc - directed primers in HeLa cells ( Fig. S5 b ). In contrast, the signal with PCR primers to a region approximately 2 kB upstream of c-myc was either weak (with anti-parafibromin antibody; Fig. S5 a ) or absent (with anti-Paf1 and anti-Leo1 antibodies; Fig. S5 b ). These results confirm the occupancy of the human c-myc promoter by the endogenous PAF1 complex.

Although knockdown of HRPT2 and Paf1 by targeted siRNA treatment-stimulated cell proliferation and up-regulated c-myc protein levels, it is unclear to what extent the former effect depends on the latter. To check for the c-myc dependence of the proliferative response to knockdown of HRPT2 or Paf1 , the proliferative rate of HeLa cells was estimated after treatment with control, HRPT2 -, or Paf1 -targeted siRNAs without or with concurrent c-myc siRNA treatment (80 nM). The c-myc siRNA treatment was sufficient to reduce c-myc protein levels relative to control under all conditions and did not interfere with the knockdown of parafibromin or Paf1 protein resulting from treatment with the respective siRNA constructs ( Fig. 4 A ). The c-myc siRNA treatment did inhibit the basal cell proliferative rate in control siRNA-treated cells and abolished the cell proliferative response to HRPT2 - or Paf1 knockdown ( Fig. 4 B ). Since treatment with 80 nM c-myc siRNA was sufficient to inhibit c-myc expression below basal levels even after knockdown of parafibromin and Paf1, this result does not exclude the possibility that c-myc and the Paf1 complex work in parallel pathways to control cell proliferation. To better examine this issue, the experiment was repeated using graded amounts of 0, 20, and 40 nM c-myc siRNA so as to find conditions that would permit expression of near-control levels of c-myc protein even after knockdown of the Paf1 complex components. Immunoblots of cells treated under these conditions showed a general dose-dependence of the c-myc knockdown that did not interfere with the HRPT2 - and Paf1 -siRNA-mediated knockdown of parafibromin and Paf1, respectively ( Fig. 4 C ). Using the smaller doses of c-myc siRNA, however, the level of residual c-myc protein under conditions of parafibromin- and Paf1-knockdown was equivalent to, or even slightly higher than, the basal, control c-myc protein level ( Fig. 4 C , Top Panel ). Nevertheless, the more modest doses of 20 and 40 nM c-myc siRNA still inhibited the basal cell proliferative rate in control siRNA-treated cells and abolished the cell proliferative response to HRPT2 or Paf1 knockdown ( Fig. 4 D ). These results demonstrate that RNA interference with the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene can prevent cell proliferation in response to knockdown of parafibromin and Paf1 components of the PAF1 complex, even when basal levels of c-myc protein are maintained. Treatment with c-myc siRNA also abolished the cell proliferative response to HRPT2 or Paf1 knockdown in human U2-OS cells ( Fig. S6 ).

Discussion

Most clinically significant sporadic or germline mutations of HRPT2 predict loss of parafibromin expression or function ( 1 , 5 , 6 , 19 – 25 ), supporting the view that parafibromin is a tumor suppressor protein. The mechanism(s) by which loss of parafibromin function promotes neoplasia are nonetheless largely unknown. Neither the recognition that parafibromin is a component of the PAF1 complex ( 7 – 9 ) nor the observation that parafibromin binds to β-catenin and promotes Wnt signaling ( 26 ) has given insight into the critical pathway(s) in which loss of parafibromin function facilitates tumor development.

Anti-proliferative properties are common to many tumor suppressor proteins, as are pro-apoptotic actions such as that recently shown for endogenous parafibromin ( 10 ). The c-myc proto-oncogene has a well-established role in promoting cell proliferation and c-myc transcript levels correlate with the proliferative response of primary cultures of parathyroid cells to serum ( 27 ). Given the inhibition of c-myc expression by endogenous parafibromin and Paf1 demonstrated here, the inactivation of parafibromin in human parathyroid and other tumors is likely to promote neoplasia at least in part because of such loss-of-function. The interaction between parafibromin and c-myc demonstrated here expands a list of previously established functional interactions between tumor suppressors and oncogenes, including those between tuberin and p 21 Ras ( 28 ) and between PTEN and PI3K- Akt ( 29 ).

Up-regulation of c-myc message and protein has been observed in a variety of benign primary and secondary parathyroid tumors ( 30 ). This implies that disinhibition of c-myc expression resulting from parafibromin loss of function would be insufficient in itself to promote the development of malignancy. So beyond the PAF1 complex-mediated inhibition of the c-myc proto-oncogene demonstrated here, given the strong link between HRPT2 inactivation and parathyroid cancer ( 1 , 5 , 6 ), there are likely additional pathways by which loss of parafibromin function critically facilitates malignant transformation.
