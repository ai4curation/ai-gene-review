Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1, a 
pandemic autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an incidence of 1:3000. 
Individuals with NF1 have a variety of malignant and non-malignant 
manifestations, including skeletal manifestations, such as osteoporosis, 
scoliosis and short statures. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the osseous 
manifestations in NF1 are poorly understood. In the present study, utilizing Nf1 
haploinsufficient (+/-) mice, we demonstrate that Nf1+/- mesenchymal 
stem/progenitor cells (MSPC) have increased proliferation and colony forming 
unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) capacity compared with wild-type (WT) MSPC. Nf1+/- MSPC 
also have fewer senescent cells and have a significantly higher telomerase 
activity compared with WT MSPC. Nf1+/- MSPC have impaired osteoblast 
differentiation as determined by alkaline phosphatase staining, and confirmed by 
single CFU-F replating assays. The impaired osteoblast differentiation in Nf1+/- 
MSPC is consistent with the reduced expression of osteoblast markers at the mRNA 
level, including osteocalcin and osteonectin. Importantly, re-expression of the 
full-length NF1 GTPase activating related domain (NF1 GAP-related domain) is 
sufficient to restore the impaired osteoblast differentiation in Nf1+/- MSPC. 
Taken together, our results suggest that neurofibromin plays a crucial role in 
modulating MSPC differentiation into osteoblasts, and the defect in osteoblast 
differentiation may contribute at least in part to the osseous abnormalities 
seen in individuals with NF1.
