The human genome contains three alpha 1-glycoprotein genes (AGP-A, AGP-B, and 
AGP-B') encoding for slightly different forms of the protein. The major 
component of human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein found in plasma is coded by AGP-A, 
which is expressed in liver and in hepatoma cell lines and is induced by 
inflammatory stimuli. We have studied the regulation of the cloned AGP-A gene by 
transfection into cell lines of hepatic and nonhepatic origin. Unlike any other 
liver-specific gene investigated so far, every AGP construct tested was 
expressed with comparable efficiency in hepatoma and HeLa cells. In contrast, 
identical constructs in transgenic mice are expressed in a tissue-specific 
manner and are regulated by acute-phase stimuli. Transgenic mice carrying the 
cluster of three AGP genes secrete the human protein in the serum, and the 
corresponding mRNA is mainly derived from the AGP-A gene. The mRNA is liver 
specific, and its concentration increases several fold following experimentally 
induced inflammation. Additional transgenic lines carrying only the AGP-A gene 
showed that sufficient information for tissue-specific and regulated expression 
is contained within a 6.6-kb segment comprising the whole coding region plus 
1.2-kb 5'-flanking and 2-kb 3'-flanking DNA.
