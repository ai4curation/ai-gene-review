Peritoneal dissemination is the most common condition of metastasis in gastric 
cancer. The survival duration of a patient with advanced stage gastric cancer, 
may be improved by gene therapy. In this study, we used an oncolytic adenovirus 
vector (Ad/TRAIL-E1) that expresses both the TRAIL and E1A genes under the 
control of a tumor-specific promoter. We evaluated the anti-tumor effect of 
Ad/TRAIL-E1 on gastric cancer cells in vitro, as well as in vivo in a xenograft 
peritoneal carcinomatosis mouse model. Our data showed that Ad/TRAIL-E1 induced 
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in gastric cancer cell lines, but not in the normal 
cell lines. In addition, Ad/TRAIL-E1 significantly inhibited peritoneal 
metastasis and prolonged the survival of mice without treatment-related 
toxicity. Therefore, tumor-specific TRAIL expression from an oncolytic 
adenovirus vector may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of 
advance stage gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination.
