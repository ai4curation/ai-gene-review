Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) are associated with 
familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 is a complex protein that 
consists of multiple domains, including predicted C-terminal WD40 repeats. In 
this study, we analyzed functional and molecular features conferred by the WD40 
domain. Electron microscopic analysis of the purified LRRK2 C-terminal domain 
revealed doughnut-shaped particles, providing experimental evidence for its WD40 
fold. We demonstrate that LRRK2 WD40 binds and sequesters synaptic vesicles via 
interaction with vesicle-associated proteins. In fact, a domain-based pulldown 
approach combined with mass spectrometric analysis identified LRRK2 as being 
part of a highly specific protein network involved in synaptic vesicle 
trafficking. In addition, we found that a C-terminal sequence variant associated 
with an increased risk of developing PD, G2385R, correlates with a reduced 
binding affinity of LRRK2 WD40 to synaptic vesicles. Our data demonstrate a 
critical role of the WD40 domain within LRRK2 function.
