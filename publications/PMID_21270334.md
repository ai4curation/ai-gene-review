The ADP ribosyl transferase [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] ARTD3(PARP3) is a 
newly characterized member of the ARTD(PARP) family that catalyzes the reaction 
of ADP ribosylation, a key posttranslational modification of proteins involved 
in different signaling pathways from DNA damage to energy metabolism and 
organismal memory. This enzyme shares high structural similarities with the DNA 
repair enzymes PARP1 and PARP2 and accordingly has been found to catalyse 
poly(ADP ribose) synthesis. However, relatively little is known about its in 
vivo cellular properties. By combining biochemical studies with the generation 
and characterization of loss-of-function human and mouse models, we describe 
PARP3 as a newcomer in genome integrity and mitotic progression. We report a 
particular role of PARP3 in cellular response to double-strand breaks, most 
likely in concert with PARP1. We identify PARP3 as a critical player in the 
stabilization of the mitotic spindle and in telomere integrity notably by 
associating and regulating the mitotic components NuMA and tankyrase 1. Both 
functions open stimulating prospects for specifically targeting PARP3 in cancer 
therapy.
