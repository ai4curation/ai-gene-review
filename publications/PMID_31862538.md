Abstract

Despite recent advances in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), prognosis still remains poor and new therapeutic approaches are needed. Studies demonstrate the importance of the EGFR/HER-receptor family in NSCLC growth, as well as that of other tumors. Recently, HER3 is receiving increased attention because of its role in drug resistance and aggressive growth. Activation of overexpressed G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) can also initiate growth by transactivating EGFR/HER-family members. GPCR transactivation of EGFR has been extensively studied, but little is known of its ability to transactivate other EGFR/HER-members, especially HER3. To address this, we studied the ability of bombesin receptor(BnR) activation to transactivates all EGFR/HER-family members and their principal downstream signaling cascades, the PI3K/Akt- and MAPK/ERK-pathways, in human NSCLC cell-lines. In all three cell-lines studied, which possessed EGFR, HER2 and HER3, Bn rapidly transactivated EGFR, HER2 and HER3, as well as Akt and ERK. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed Bn-induced formation of both HER3/EGFR- and HER3/HER2-heterodimers. Specific EGFR/HER3 antibodies or siRNA-knockdown of EGFR and HER3, demonstrated Bn-stimulated activation of EGFR/HER members is initially through HER3, not EGFR. In addition, specific inhibition of HER3, HER2 or MAPK, abolished Bn-stimulated cell-growth, while neither EGFR nor Akt inhibition had an effect. These results show HER3 transactivation mediates all growth effects of BnR activation through MAPK. These results raise the possibility that targeting HER3 alone or with GPCR activation and its signal cascades, may be a novel therapeutic approach in NSCLC. This is especially relevant with the recent development of HER3-blocking antibodies.

1. Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in United States[ 1 ]. Despite the recent advances in its diagnosis and treatment, more than one-half of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed with advanced disease, and the prognosis remains poor with 5-year survival rates of 5% and 19% for those in advanced and all stages, respectively[ 1 ]. The epidermal growth factor (EGFR)/HER-receptor family including EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4, are widely overexpressed and significantly involved in the tumorigenesis of lung cancer, as well as a number of other various malignancies[ 2 , 3 ]. Recent studies have shown the significant antitumor activity of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors targeting EGFR in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) possessing EGFR mutations[ 4 – 6 ], however, most patients become refractory to these agents limiting prolongation of their survival[ 7 , 8 ]. Thus, although these studies establish the importance of the EGFR receptor family in lung cancer progression, because many patients only transiently respond, there is an urgent need for other novel therapeutic strategies in this area.

Among the EGFR/HER-receptor family, HER3 is a kinase dead RTK[ 9 , 10 ], whereas HER2 is an orphan (ligand-less) RTK[ 11 ]. The activation of HER3 particularly has been receiving increased attention, with studies showing it has an important role in the initial and subsequent development of therapeutic escape from other antitumor agents including EGFR inhibitors [ 12 – 15 ] as well as tumor aggressiveness[ 16 , 16 – 19 ] and because of its ability to activate other EGFR/HER-receptor family members[ 10 , 11 , 20 ]. Despite HER3’s lack of intrinsic kinase activity, with its ability to form heterodimers with other EGFR/HER family members, particularly HER2[ 11 , 21 ], HER3 can subsequently activate numerous downstream cascades, particularly important for growth/resistance being the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways[ 22 , 23 ]. Overexpression of HER3 is reported in many cancers and has been particularly well studied in NSCLC, where it is reported to be very frequently overexpressed[ 24 , 25 ]. For example, in 7 representative studies[ 25 – 32 ] of EGFR/HER family member overexpression involving 1346 NSCLC patients, HER3 overexpression was seen in 51%[20-83%](mean ±SEM) of all patient’s NSCLCs, which was as frequent as overexpression of EGFR/HER1-52%[39-72%], and more frequent than overexpression of HER2-28%[13-45%] .The overexpression of HER3 in is associated with worse survival[ 16 , 18 , 19 ], as well as more aggressive malignant behavior[ 16 , 17 ]. Therefore, potentially targeting HER3, is becoming an increasingly attractive therapeutic target, both for initial treatment and for overcoming drug resistance in lung cancer as well as other tumors.

The mammalian bombesin receptor (BnR) family are G-protein coupled-receptors(GPCRs), comprising the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR), the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) and the orphan receptor bombesin-receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3)[ 33 ]. Each receptor is frequently overexpressed in numerous common tumors, including NSCLC[ 33 – 37 ]. This family of receptors has received particular attention in lung cancer because they act as autocrine growth factors and have potent growth effects[ 33 , 35 , 38 , 39 ]. Activation of BnR, as well as other GPCRs, can transactivate the EGFR/HER-receptor family in the absence of native EGFR/HER-receptor family ligands, such as EGF and neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)[ 11 ]. The crosstalk between GPCRs and EGFR/HER-receptor family has been widely studied in a number of cancers, primarily focusing on EGFR, which show a synergistic effect on tumor growth[ 40 – 42 ], as well as participating as one of the mechanisms underlying resistance to EGFR inhibitors[ 43 , 44 ]. Whereas the transactivation of EGFR/HER1 by GPCRs has been well-studied, particularly in NSCLCs[ 45 – 47 ], little is known about the ability of GPCR’s to transactivate HER3, and its role in tumor growth, as well as its effect on tumorigenesis. Recent studies in other tumors demonstrate that EGFR can either be activated directly by a stimulant or it can be due to the initial activation of HER3, which then heterodimerizes with EGFR and activates it[ 45 , 48 – 50 ]. Therefore, in previous studies in which only the activation of EGFR/HER1 by stimulation of a GRPR was examined, the possible importance of HER3 in the process cannot be appreciated. Therefore, the possible ability of GPCRs to transactivate HER3 is becoming increasingly important potential novel area of therapy, especially with the recent development of anti-HER3 agents[ 11 , 51 ].

Therefore, to provide insight into the possible role of GPCR transactivation of HER3, as well as the other EGFR/HER-family members, we have studied the interaction of BnR activation and EGFR/HER-receptor family transactivation in human NSCLC cells, and defined the roles of each member, as well as their downstream signaling cascades, in mediating effects on tumoral growth.

4. Discussion

The EGFR/HER-receptor family are highly expressed in many malignancies, particularly cancers of the lung, breast, colorectum, pancreas, and head/neck (squamous[HNSCC])[ 3 , 11 , 18 , 51 ]. The activation of the EGFR/HER-receptor family is important not only in the pathogenesis of these tumors, but also an important target in their treatment, the development of treatment resistance, as a determinant of their aggressiveness and for prognosis[ 12 – 14 , 16 , 18 , 19 , 38 , 56 ]. The EGFR/HER-receptors in these cancers are stimulated by growth factors, activating mutations, amplification, as well as transactivation by various cellular receptors including GPCRs stimulated by various peptides, hormones, and bioactive lipids[ 3 , 11 , 54 ]. In many cancers, inhibition of the EGFR/HER-receptor family has led to significant therapeutic responses; however, drug resistance and therapeutic escape frequently develop[ 11 , 54 ]. Thus, there is a role for new treatment approaches and increased understanding of EGFR/HER-receptor family’s role in the tumor’s pathogenesis, treatment and therapeutic response.

Mammalian BnRs (GRPR, NMBR, BRS-3), as well as a number of other GPCRs, are widely overexpressed in numbers of common tumors, including lung, breast, colon, prostate, CNS, and HNSCC[ 33 – 36 ]. Numerous studies have shown that EGFR transactivated by GPCRs can be particularly important in these cancers, not only because the GPCRs can stimulate tumor growth and invasiveness, but also because dual-inhibition of the GPCRs and EGFR/HER-receptor family can have a synergistic cytotoxic effect[ 38 , 40 – 42 , 56 ], raising the possibility of novel treatment approaches. Furthermore, activation of the GPCRs resulting in EGFR’s transactivation can play an important role in the resistance against EGFR-targeted therapies[ 43 , 44 ]. Most studies of the transactivation of EGFR/HER-receptor family by GPCRs have only investigated the transactivation of EGFR, thus, the possibility that one of the other EGFR/HER-receptor family (HER3, HER4) is, in fact, the principal initiator in the transactivation process, with resultant heterodimerization with one of the other EGFR/HER members including EGFR, has not been well studied. This distinction is important with the recent development of specific inhibitors for the different EGFR/HER-receptor family members[ 11 ].

Recent studies have emphasized the importance of the kinase deficient HER3 through heterodimerization with the other EGFR/HER members in mediating treatment failure[ 12 – 14 ], promoting cancer metastasis[ 16 , 17 ], and as an important prognostic factor for worse survival[ 16 , 18 , 19 ]. Furthermore, a number of studies suggest HER3 activation can be an important mediator of EGFR/HER2 transactivation by different agents contributing to enhanced tumor growth as well as development of therapeutic escape[ 40 , 57 ]. The importance of HER3 transactivation by GPCR’s and other-receptors in cells/tumors (affecting cell/tumor behavior, growth, aggressiveness, migration) is reported for neurotensin receptors in breast and lung cancer cells[ 40 , 57 ]; estrogen, progesterone and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptors in breast cancer cells[ 49 , 58 , 59 ]; macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 receptor in both breast and gastric cancer[ 60 ]; activation of P2Y2 nucleotide receptors in salivary gland cells[ 48 ]; and activation of angiotensin 1/2 receptors in both normal cells and disease states[ 61 – 63 ]. Furthermore, in numerous cancers (prostate, lung, and hepatocellular), activation of GPCR’s and growth factor receptors can have a marked effect on expression of HER3[ 57 , 64 – 66 ]. These results strongly suggest that activation of GPCRs by a number of tumor growth stimulants can transactivate HER3 and thus targeting the HER3/GPCR interaction could be a novel therapeutic strategy among these diseases. Hence, elucidating in detail the mechanisms of transactivation of HER3 signaling cascades and its effect on cell-growth would provide important mechanistic insights which could reveal novel strategies with possible therapeutic potential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to study in detail in lung cancer cells(concentrating on NSCLC ), in which the EGFR/HER-receptor family has been extensively studied[ 42 – 44 , 47 , 52 , 67 ], the specific role of the EGFR/HER-receptor family in transactivation caused by GPCRs. Because the Bn receptor family is very frequently overexpressed in lung cancer cells[ 33 , 52 ] and has been shown to frequently stimulate EGFR transactivation in this cancer[ 41 , 42 , 44 , 47 , 52 ], the ability of Bn to transactivate the different EGFR/HER-family members in lung cancer cells was concentrated on.

A number of our results support the conclusion that both Bn-transactivation and the HER3 agonist, NRG-1, stimulate each of the EGFR/HER-receptor family members in each of the NSCLC cells examined (H441, H2087 and Calu-3). This conclusion was supported by our finding that both Bn and NRG-1 caused increased phosphorylation of each of the three EGFR/HER-receptor family members in each NSCLC cell-line. Furthermore, a co-immunoprecipitation study showed both Bn and NRG-1 stimulated heterodimerization of HER3/HER2 and HER3/EGFR. In general, the patterns of activation of the different EGFR/HER-receptor members by NRG-1 and Bn-transactivation were similar, however, the kinetics and magnitude of activation varied in the different NSCLC cells, as well as the kinetics and magnitudes of the activation of the different EGFR/HER members in a given NSCLC cell. Although no previous study in the same cells has compared in detail the kinetics and magnitudes of activation of all EGFR/HER members by a native EGFR/HER-receptor ligand to that seen with transactivation by GPCRs, as we performed in the current study, our results show both differences and similarities from previous studies examining only EGFR(HER1)-receptor transactivation. First, the magnitude of stimulation of HER2 and HER3, but not EGFR, differed in each of the cell-lines for BnR transactivation compared with NRG-1 stimulation, with NRG-1 showing greater stimulation. Our results are similar to studies showing greater stimulation of EGFR by the native EGFR ligand, EGF, than by transactivation by GPCR ligands in several tumor cells [neuroendocrine tumor[ 68 ], NSCLC[ 44 , 47 ] and prostate cancer[ 69 ]], as well as in normal fibroblasts[ 70 ]. Our results are also similar to one detailed study involving different normal cells transfected with numerous GPCRs, which showed greater activation of EGFR by EGF than by transactivation of a member of GPCR’s[ 62 ]. Second, in a given NSCLC cell-line, the kinetics of activation of each of the three EGFR/HER members was similar with BnR transactivation. In contrast, with NRG-1 stimulation, the relative kinetics of EGFR/HER-receptor activation in a given cell were more variable and more prolonged for HER2/HER3 activation. In terms of BnR transactivation, our results are different from a previous study demonstrating distinct kinetics of different members of the EGFR/HER-receptor family’s transactivation induced by angiotensin II in fibroblasts[ 62 ]. However, our kinetic results with Bn-transactivation are similar to different EGFR/HER-receptor’s transactivation by progesterone in ovarian cancer[ 59 ] and by growth hormone releasing hormone in prostate cancer cells[ 71 ]. Our results with NRG-1 stimulation are different from the previous studies reporting similar kinetics of different EGFR/HER-receptor’s activation, especially between EGFR and HER3, by their native ligands in ovarian cancer[ 72 ] and breast cancer cells[ 73 ] as well as in normal fibroblasts[ 74 ]. Third, in the different NSCLC cell-lines, for a given EGFR/HER member, the kinetics and/or magnitude of stimulation by either NRG-1 or Bn varied markedly. Similar to our results, a number of studies in various tumor cell-lines reported the similar rapid activation of HER3 induced by NRG-1 peaking at early stimulation time, including breast cancer[ 73 , 75 , 76 ], prostate cancer[ 76 ] melanoma[ 77 ], as well as in the normal cells (fibroblast)[ 74 ]. In terms of transactivation of EGFR/HER-receptors by GPCRs activation, results resembling the kinetic patterns we find, are reported with a slow stimulated time course in neuroendocrine tumors[ 68 ], prostate cancer[ 69 ] and breast cancers[ 59 ], while other studies reported the opposite results in NSCLC[ 42 , 44 ] and prostate cancer cells[ 78 ]. Fourth, in our study, both Bn- and NRG-1-induced activation of the EGFR/HER-family members were dose-dependent with similar EC50’s in a nanomolar range in the different cells. These are comparable with reports with GPCR ligands transactivating EGFR in neuroendocrine tumors[ 68 ], lung cancer[ 41 , 52 ] and prostate cancer cells[ 69 ], as well as for NRG-1 activating HER3 in ovarian cancer[ 72 ], hepatocellular carcinoma[ 65 ], and pancreatic cancer cells[ 55 ]. Our finding that Bn-transactivation was more potent than NRG-1 for activating the EGFR/HER-family members is in contrast to their comparable magnitude of activation which shows the reverse pattern. These results, combined with the previous findings, suggest that the mechanisms involved in the kinetics and magnitude of response, and potency of the stimulation for EGFR/HER-receptor family’s activation, can vary for specific native ligands and GPCRs transactivation within the same cell, as well as in different cell-lines for different EGFR/HER members.

A number of our results support the conclusion that in each of the NSCLC cells, Bn-transactivation as well as NRG-1 stimulation of each of the three EGFR/HER-family members (EGFR, HER2 and HER3) present, is mediated by heterodimerization with HER3, not EGFR. NRG-1, which only stimulates HER3 and HER4[ 79 ], stimulated activation of the three members of the EGFR/HER-family present in the each of the cells studied(HER1,HER2,HER3). Therefore, NRG-1 is causing these effects by activating HER3, because there is no HER4 present. Furthermore, because HER3 is kinase-deficient, it must heterodimerize with EGFR or HER2 to be active[ 9 ]. In many cells, HER2 is the preferred partner[ 21 ]. However, our immunoprecipitation studies show HER3 with NRG-1 stimulation heterodimerizes with both EGFR and HER2. Similarly, HER2 requires heterodimerization to be activated because no known specific native ligands for it have been identified[ 11 ]. Therefore, the activation of all three EGFR/HER members by NRG-1 strongly suggests initial HER3 activation is mediated activation of EGFR and HER2. Second, a specific HER3 antibody, MAB3481[ 20 , 55 ], completely inhibited both Bn-transactivation, as well as NRG-1 activation of each of the EGFR/HER-members. This was not due to nonspecific inhibition of EGFR or HER2, because this antibody had no effect on EGF activation of EGFR and HER2 in cells not possessing HER3, but only EGFR and HER2. Third, HER3 siRNA which only resulted in knockdown of HER3, had a similar effect to the HER3 antibody, blocked both Bn-transactivation and NRG-1 stimulation of each of the three EGFR/HER members present in each cell. In contrast, siRNA against EGFR, which specifically downregulated only EGFR, only inhibited EGFR activation. Although there are only limited studies of the ability of GPCR’s to transactivate all of the EGFR/HER-family members in a given cell, our results have both differences and similarities to the results in these studies. Our results demonstrating that in the NSCLC cells studied, BnR-stimulation caused activation of HER2 through a HER3-mediated process, differs from a number of studies reporting activation of various GPCR’s in different tumor cells stimulate HER2 via activation of EGFR[ 41 , 80 – 85 ]. These studies include EGFR/HER2 transactivation by GRP or lysophosphatidic acid in HNSCC[ 80 , 83 ]; EGFR/HER2 transactivation by leptin receptors stimulation in both breast cancer and vascular cells[ 81 , 85 ]; by endothelin receptor and Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide receptor transactivation of EGFR/HER2 in lung cancer cells[ 41 , 82 ]; and protease-activated receptor transactivation of EGFR/HER2 in breast cancer cells[ 84 ]. Our results demonstrating with BnR transactivation that both EGFR and HER2 is activated by a HER3-mediated mechanism is similar to studies of estrogen receptor transactivation in breast cancer cells[ 49 ], macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 receptor transactivation of EGFR/HER-receptors in gastric and breast cancer cells[ 60 ] and transactivation of EGFR/HER-family members in salivary grand cells by stimulation of the P2X2 nucleotide receptor[ 48 ].

Numerous studies demonstrate that not only are the family of BnR receptors(especially GRPR) present in the majority of NSCLC cells[ 33 , 35 , 46 , 52 ], but also, they are potent growth factors for these cells[ 33 , 35 ]. A number of our results support the conclusion that BnR-mediated transactivation of EGFR/HER-family members is a major determinant of their growth effect, and that this is affected initially by a HER3-dependent process. First, a specific inhibitor of HER3, but not EGFR, completely inhibited Bn-stimulated cell-growth in NSCLC cells. Second, specific knockdown of HER3 with siRNA showed a similar inhibitory effect to the HER3 antibody, whereas EGFR specific knockdown had no effect. These results differ from the studies reporting complete inhibition of various GPCR agonist-stimulated cell-growth by EGFR blockade in some lung cancers[ 42 ], HNSCC[ 80 , 83 , 86 ] and neuroendocrine tumor[ 68 ], as well as prostaglandin- and bradykinin-stimulated cell-growth in EGFR-knockout fibroblasts[ 87 ]. In contrast, our results are similar to the study showing that downregulation of HER3 by siRNA, as well as HER2 antibody, completely inhibit estrogen-stimulated cell-growth in mammary tumors[ 49 ].

Numerous studies in both lung cancer cells and other cells demonstrate activation of the EGFR/HER-family is coupled to stimulation of the MAPK-cascade as well as activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, each of which have can have an important effect on cell behavior (growth, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, inflammation, and biological response)[ 22 , 23 ]. Our results demonstrate both NRG-1 and Bn-transactivation stimulate each of these signaling cascades in each NSCLC cell-line, and they show both similarities and differences from results in other cells. Our results which show a rapid activation of ERK and Akt in each NSCLC cells with Bn-transactivation are similar to studies reporting endothelin-transactivation of EGFR in fibroblasts[ 70 ] and GRP-transactivation of the EGFR/HER-family in other lung cancer cells[ 42 , 44 ]. Similarly, our results demonstrating sustained activation of Akt with NRG-1 stimulation agree with results in breast cancer cells[ 23 , 75 ] and prostate cancer cells[ 76 ]. In contrast to our results, NRG-1 causes a transient activation of Akt in ovarian cancer cells[ 72 ] and melanoma cells[ 77 ] and sustained activation of ERK in breast cancer cells[ 73 ]. These results demonstrate that the kinetics of activation of the ERK and PI3K/Akt can differ markedly in different cells both when the EGFR/HER-family are transactivated by GPCRs or by direct stimulation with a native ligand.

While our results demonstrate that Bn-transactivation of HER3 stimulates both the PI3K- and MAPK-pathways, only activation of the MAPK/ERK-pathway, not the PI3K/Akt, mediates Bn-stimulated cell-proliferation in the NSCLC cells studied. Our results differ from a number of studies in both tumor/nontumor cells reporting PI3K activation is the principal downstream effector of HER2/HER3-signaling on cellular growth[ 13 , 14 , 22 , 67 ], with EGFR homodimers as well as EGFR/HER2 heterodimer complexes preferentially activating MAPK signaling and HER2/HER3 heterodimer to a lesser extent[ 15 , 21 , 22 ]. Conversely, similar to our results, the superiority of MAPK inhibitors over PI3K inhibitors on HER3-mediated growth activity is reported in several studies with breast cancer[ 88 , 89 ] and HNSCC[ 15 , 22 ]. Our results are also similar to a study in gastric cancer which reported that ERK, but not Akt, was involved in HER3-transactivation caused by histone deacetylase inhibitors[ 90 ]. These results demonstrate that prominence of MAPK-activation or PI3K-activation in mediating HER3 downstream events including growth, can vary markedly in different tumor cells.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that with Bn-transactivation as well as NRG-1 stimulation of NSCLC-cells, the stimulation of HER3-signaling by forming heterodimers with HER2 is essential in mediating cell-proliferation. Furthermore, the activation of MAPK, not PI3K, through HER2/HER3 heterodimers is the main downstream growth stimulating cascade. Previous studies demonstrate that not only do Bn-peptides act as tumor autocrine growth factors in lung cancer and a number of other common cancers, their receptor activation can stimulate EGFR/HER-family transactivation causing tumor growth, but its inhibition also increases the sensitivity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors[ 33 , 35 , 39 , 91 ]. With the increasing development of HER3 antagonists, as well as the availability of BnR receptor antagonists [ 11 , 51 , 91 – 96 ], our results support the conclusion that targeting the crosstalk between GPCR and HER3 transactivation, together with its downstream cascades, could be a novel antitumor therapeutic target among various malignancies expressing these receptors, especially in NSCLC.
