Phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) and GTPase activating protein (GAP) are 
substrates of EGF, PDGF and other growth factor receptors. Since either 
PLC-gamma or GAP also bind to the activated receptors it was suggested that 
their SH2 domains are mediating this association. We attempted to delineate the 
specific region of the EGF receptor that is responsible for the binding, 
utilizing EGF receptor mutants, PLC-gamma, and a bacterially expressed TRP E 
fusion protein containing the SH2 domains of GAP. As previously shown, tyrosine 
autophosphorylation of the wild-type receptor wsa crucial in mediating the 
association and in agreement, a kinase negative EGF receptor could bind 
PLC-gamma or TRP E GAP SH2, but only when cross tyrosine phosphorylated by an 
active EGF receptor kinase. The importance of autophosphorylation for 
association was confirmed by demonstrating that a carboxy-terminal deletion of 
the EGFR missing four autophosphorylation sites bound these proteins poorly. To 
study the role of EGF receptor autophosphorylation further, a 203 amino acid EGF 
receptor fragment was generated with cyanogen bromide that contained all known 
tyrosine autophosphorylation sites. This fragment bound both TRP E GAP SH2 and 
PLC-gamma but only when tyrosine phosphorylated. This data localizes a major 
binding site for SH2 domain containing proteins to the carboxy-terminus of the 
EGF receptor and points to the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in 
mediating this association.
