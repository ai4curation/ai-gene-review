Neural tube defects are common and serious human congenital anomalies. These 
malformations have a multifactorial etiology and can be reproduced in mouse 
models by mutations of numerous individual genes and by perturbation of multiple 
environmental factors. The identification of specific genetic interactions 
affecting neural tube closure will facilitate our understanding of molecular 
pathways regulating normal neural development and will enhance our ability to 
predict and modify the incidence of spina bifida and other neural tube defects. 
Here, we report a genetic interaction between Nf1, encoding the intracellular 
signal transduction protein neurofibromin, and Pax3, a transcription factor gene 
mutated in the Splotch mouse. Both Pax3 and Nf1 are important for the 
development of neural crest-derived structures and the central nervous system. 
Splotch is an established model of folate-sensitive neural tube defects, and 
homozygous mutant embryos develop spina bifida and sometimes exencephaly. Neural 
development is grossly normal in heterozygotes and neural tube defects are not 
seen. In contrast, we found a low incidence of neural tube defects in 
heterozygous Splotch mice that also harbored a mutation in one Nf1 allele. All 
compound homozygotes had severe neural tube defects and died earlier in 
embryogenesis than either Nf1(-/-) or Sp(-/-) embryos. We also report occasional 
exencephaly in Nf1(-/-) mice and identify more subtle CNS abnormalities in 
normal-appearing Nf1(-/-) embryos. Though other genetic loci and environmental 
factors affect the incidence of neural tube defects in Splotch mice, these 
results establish Nf1 as the first known gene to act as a modifier of neural 
tube defects in Splotch.
