Among the various forms of human lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 
exhibits a characteristic neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype. Neural and NE 
differentiation in SCLC depend, in part, on the action of the 
basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor human achaete-scute 
homologue-1 (hASH1). In nervous system development, the Notch signaling pathway 
is a critical negative regulator of bHLH factors, including hASH1, controlling 
cell fate commitment and differentiation. To characterize Notch pathway function 
in SCLC, we explored the consequences of constitutively active Notch signaling 
in cultured SCLC cells. Recombinant adenoviruses were used to overexpress active 
forms of Notch1, Notch2, or the Notch effector protein human hairy enhancer of 
split-1 (HES1) in DMS53 and NCI-H209 SCLC cells. Notch proteins, but not HES1 or 
control adenoviruses, caused a profound growth arrest, associated with a G1 cell 
cycle block. We found up-regulation of p21(waf1/cip1) and p27kip1 in concert 
with the cell cycle changes. Active Notch proteins also led to dramatic 
reduction in hASH1 expression, as well as marked activation of phosphorylated 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and ERK2, findings that have been 
shown to be associated with cell cycle arrest in SCLC cells. These data suggest 
that the previously described function of Notch proteins as proto-oncogenes is 
highly context-dependent. Notch activation, in the setting of a highly 
proliferative hASH1-dependent NE neoplasm, can be associated with growth arrest 
and apparent reduction in neoplastic potential.
