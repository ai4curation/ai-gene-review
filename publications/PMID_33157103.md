Iron-sulfur cluster proteins play key roles in a multitude of cellular 
processes. Iron-sulfur cofactors are assembled primarily in mitochondria and are 
then exported to the cytosol by use of an ABCB7 transporter. It has been shown 
that the yeast mitochondrial transporter Atm1 can export glutathione-coordinated 
iron-sulfur clusters, [2Fe-2S](SG)4, providing a source of cluster units for 
cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly systems. This pathway is consistent with 
the endosymbiotic model of mitochondrial evolution where homologous bacterial 
heavy metal transporters, utilizing metal glutathione adducts, were adapted for 
use in eukaryotic mitochondria. Herein, the basis for endosymbiotic evolution of 
the human cluster export protein (ABCB7) is developed through a BLAST analysis 
of transporters from ancient proteobacteria. In addition, a functional 
comparison of native human protein, versus a disease-causing mutant, 
demonstrates a key role for residue E433 in promoting cluster transport. 
Dysfunction in mitochondrial export of Fe-S clusters is a likely cause of the 
disease condition X-linked sideroblastic anemia.
