Scaffolding adapter Grb2-associated binder 2 (Gab2) is a key component of 
FcepsilonRI signaling in mast cells, required for the activation of PI3K. To 
understand how Gab2 is activated in FcepsilonRI signaling, we asked which 
protein tyrosine kinase is required for Gab2 phosphorylation. We found that Gab2 
tyrosyl phosphorylation requires Lyn and Syk. In agreement with published 
results, we found that Fyn also contributes to Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation. 
However, Syk activation is defective in Fyn(-/-) mast cells, suggesting that Syk 
is the proximal kinase responsible for Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Then, we 
asked which domains in Gab2 are required for Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation. We 
found that the Grb2-Src homology 3 (SH3) binding sites are required for, whereas 
the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain contributes to, Gab2 tyrosyl 
phosphorylation. Using a protein/lipid overlay assay, we determined that the 
Gab2 PH domain preferentially binds the PI3K lipid products, PI3, 4,5P3 and PI3, 
4P2. Furthermore, the Grb2-SH3 binding sites and PH domain binding to PI3K lipid 
products are required for Gab2 function in FcepsilonRI-evoked degranulation and 
Akt activation. Our data strongly suggest a model for Gab2 action in FcepsilonRI 
signaling. The Grb2 SH3 binding sites play a critical role in bringing Gab2 to 
FcepsilonRI, whereupon Gab2 becomes tyrosyl-phosphorylated in a Syk-dependent 
fashion. Phosphorylated Gab2 results in recruitment and activation of PI3K, 
whose lipid products bind the PH domain of Gab2 and acts in positive feedback 
loop for sustained PI3K recruitment and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 
production, required for FcepsilonRI-evoked degranulation of mast cells.
