The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is an essential 
component of transcriptional regulation and RNA processing of protein-coding 
genes. A large body of data also implicates the CTD in the transcription and 
processing of RNAPII-mediated small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). However, the identity 
of the complex (or complexes) that associates with the CTD and mediates the 
processing of snRNAs has remained elusive. Here, we describe an RNA polymerase 
II complex that contains at least 12 novel subunits, termed the Integrator, in 
addition to core RNAPII subunits. Two of the Integrator subunits display 
similarities to the subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity 
factor (CPSF) complex. We show that Integrator is recruited to the U1 and U2 
snRNA genes and mediates the snRNAs' 3' end processing. The Integrator complex 
is evolutionarily conserved in metazoans and directly interacts with the 
C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II largest subunit.
