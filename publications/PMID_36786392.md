The destructive effect of infectious diseases on human life and the emergence of 
antibiotic-resistant strains highlight the importance of developing new and 
appropriate treatment strategies, one of which is the use of metals 
as therapeutic agents. Bismuth nanoparticles are an example of prominent 
metal-containing drugs. The therapeutic effects of bismuth-based drugs in the 
treatment of wounds have been proven. Various laboratory studies have confirmed 
the antimicrobial effects of bismuth nanoparticles, including the clinical 
treatment of ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori. Therefore, considering the 
performance of this nanoparticle and its potent effect on infectious agents and 
its therapeutic dimensions, the present study fully investigated the properties 
and performance of this metal-based nanoparticle.
