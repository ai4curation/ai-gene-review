Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are germ cell precursors that are committed to 
sperm or oocytes. Dramatic proliferation during PGC development determines the 
number of founder spermatogonia and oocytes. Although specified to a germ 
lineage, PGCs produce pluripotent embryonic germ (EG) cells in vitro and 
testicular teratomas in vivo. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates pluripotency 
and differentiation in various stem cell systems, and dysregulation of this 
signaling causes various human cancers. Here, we examined the role of 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in PGC development. In normal PGC development, 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is suppressed by the GSK3beta-mediated active 
degradation of beta-catenin and the low expression of canonical Wnt molecules. 
The effects of aberrant activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in PGCs were 
analyzed using mice carrying a deletion of the exon that encodes the GSK3beta 
phosphorylation sites in the beta-catenin locus. Despite the potential activity 
of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in stem cell maintenance and carcinogenesis in 
various cell lineages, teratomas were not induced in the mice expressing the 
nuclear-localized beta-catenin in PGCs. Instead, the mutant mice showed germ 
cell deficiency caused by the delayed cell cycle progression of the 
proliferative phase PGCs. Our results show that the suppression of 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is a prerequisite for the normal development of PGCs.
