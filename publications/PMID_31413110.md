F-box protein 31 (FBXO31) is a reported putative tumor suppressor, and its 
inactivation due to loss of heterozygosity is associated with cancers of 
different origins. An emerging body of literature has documented FBXO31's role 
in preserving genome integrity following DNA damage and in the cell cycle. 
However, knowledge regarding the role of FBXO31 during normal cell-cycle 
progression is restricted to its functions during the G2/M phase. Interestingly, 
FBXO31 levels remain high even during the early G1 phase, a crucial stage for 
preparing the cells for DNA replication. Therefore, we sought to investigate the 
functions of FBXO31 during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Here, using flow 
cytometric, biochemical, and immunofluorescence techniques, we show that FBXO31 
is essential for maintaining optimum expression of the cell-cycle protein cyclin 
A for efficient cell-cycle progression. Stable FBXO31 knockdown led to atypical 
accumulation of cyclin A during the G1 phase, driving premature DNA replication 
and compromised loading of the minichromosome maintenance complex, resulting in 
replication from fewer origins and DNA double-strand breaks. Because of these 
inherent defects in replication, FBXO31-knockdown cells were hypersensitive to 
replication stress-inducing agents and displayed pronounced genomic instability. 
Upon entering mitosis, the cells defective in DNA replication exhibited a delay 
in the prometaphase-to-metaphase transition and anaphase defects such as lagging 
and bridging chromosomes. In conclusion, our findings establish that FBXO31 
plays a pivotal role in preserving genomic integrity by maintaining low cyclin A 
levels during the G1 phase for faithful genome duplication and segregation.
