Ordered assembly of scaffold proteins Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1 determines NF-kappaB 
activation following T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. Carma1-Bcl10 interaction 
and the signaling pathway are controlled by Carma1 phosphorylation, which are 
induced by PKCtheta and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). 
In addition to Carma1 phosphorylation, previous studies have demonstrated that 
Bcl10 is phosphorylated in the C-terminal Ser/Thr rich region following TCR 
engagement. However the kinases that phosphorylate Bcl10 are incompletely 
understood. Here we show that CaMKII phosphorylates Bcl10 on Ser138. 
Furthermore, a CaMKII inhibitor, KN93, and CaMKII siRNA substantially reduce 
Bcl10 phosphorylation induced by phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin. S138A 
mutation prolongs Bcl10-induced NF-kappaB activation, suggesting that Bcl10 
phosphorylation is involved in attenuation of NF-kappaB activation. These 
findings suggest that CaMKII modulates NF-kappaB activation via phosphorylating 
Bcl10 as well as Carma1.
