Smad3 is an important component of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) 
intracellular signalling. To identify novel interacting proteins of Smad3, we 
performed pull-down assays with Smad3 constructs fused to 
glutathione-S-transferase. Proteins which formed complexes with these constructs 
were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and were identified by 
matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We 
identified 14 proteins interacting with the Smad3 construct lacking the 
N-terminal Mad homology domain 1 (MH1), and 12 proteins interacting with the 
construct lacking the C-terminal MH2 domain. Proteins involved in signalling 
processes, in metabolism regulation, novel proteins, and components of 
cytoskeleton form four groups of interacting proteins. Interactions of AGP7, 
sex-determining region Y protein, actin beta and sterol regulatory element 
binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) proteins with Smad3 constructs were confirmed by 
immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Interaction of Smad3 with SREBP-2 was 
also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of myc-Smad3 and Flag-SREBP-2 upon 
expression in mammalian cells. We found that SREBP-2 inhibited the 
transcriptional activity of Smad3 in luciferase reporter assays.
