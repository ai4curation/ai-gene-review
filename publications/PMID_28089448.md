By interacting with hundreds of protein partners, 14-3-3 proteins coordinate 
vital cellular processes. Phosphorylation of the small heat shock protein, 
HSPB6, within its intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain activates its 
interaction with 14-3-3, ultimately triggering smooth muscle relaxation. After 
analyzing the binding of an HSPB6-derived phosphopeptide to 14-3-3 using 
isothermal calorimetry and X-ray crystallography, we have determined the crystal 
structure of the complete assembly consisting of the 14-3-3 dimer and 
full-length HSPB6 dimer and further characterized this complex in solution using 
fluorescence spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and limited 
proteolysis. We show that selected intrinsically disordered regions of HSPB6 are 
transformed into well-defined conformations upon the interaction, whereby an 
unexpectedly asymmetric structure is formed. This structure provides the first 
atomic resolution snapshot of a human small HSP in functional state, explains 
how 14-3-3 proteins sequester their regulatory partners, and can inform the 
design of small-molecule interaction modifiers to be used as myorelaxants.
