Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a transcription factor that has a 
central role in the regulation of tumour metabolism under hypoxic conditions. 
HIF-1α stimulates glycolytic energy production and promotes tumour growth. 
Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases that regulate cellular 
metabolism in response to stress; however, their involvement in the hypoxic 
response remains unclear. In this study, it is shown that SIRT2-mediated 
deacetylation of HIF-1α regulates its stability in tumour cells. SIRT2 
overexpression destabilized HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions, whereas HIF-1α 
protein levels were high in SIRT2-deficient cells. SIRT2 directly interacted 
with HIF-1α and deacetylated Lys709 of HIF-1α. Deacetylation of HIF-1α by SIRT2 
resulted in increased binding affinity for prolyl hydroxylase 2, a key regulator 
of HIF-1α stability, and increased HIF-1α hydroxylation and ubiquitination. 
Moreover, a pharmacological agent that increased the intracellular NAD(+)/NADH 
ratio led to the degradation of HIF-1α by increasing SIRT2-mediated 
deacetylation and subsequent hydroxylation. These findings suggest that 
SIRT2-mediated HIF-1α deacetylation is critical for the destablization of HIF-1α 
and the hypoxic response of tumour cells.
