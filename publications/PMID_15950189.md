The ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) is involved in ribosome biogenesis as a member 
of ribosomal small subunit and also plays a role in the repair of damaged DNA. 
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), a MAP kinase, is known to play 
important roles in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and 
apoptosis. In this study, the sequence analysis of rpS3 protein revealed that 
this protein has a putative FXFP motif which is believed to be an Erk binding 
site. Indeed, the motif was demonstrated as an Erk binding site by 
co-immunoprecipitation. In addition to this, it was revealed that Erk 
specifically phosphorylated Thr 42 residue of rpS3 in vitro and in vivo using 
the various mutants of rpS3. Taken together, rpS3 appears to be phosphorylated 
by activated Erk in proliferating cells, resulting in the decreased interaction 
between two proteins.
