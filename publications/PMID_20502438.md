DivIVA is a conserved protein in Gram-positive bacteria that localizes at the 
poles and division sites, presumably through direct sensing of membrane 
curvature. DivIVA functions as a scaffold and is vital for septum site selection 
during vegetative growth and chromosome anchoring during sporulation. DivIVA 
deletion causes filamentous growth in Bacillus subtilis, whereas overexpression 
causes hyphal branching in Streptomyces coelicolor. We have determined the 
crystal structure of the N-terminal (Nt) domain of DivIVA, and show that it 
forms a parallel coiled-coil. It is capped with two unique crossed and 
intertwined loops, exposing hydrophobic and positively charged residues that we 
show here are essential for membrane binding. An intragenic suppressor 
introducing a positive charge restores membrane binding after mutating the 
hydrophobic residues. We propose that the hydrophobic residues insert into the 
membrane and that the positively charged residues bind to the membrane surface. 
A low-resolution crystal structure of the C-terminal (Ct) domain displays a 
curved tetramer made from two parallel coiled-coils. The Nt and Ct parts were 
then merged into a model of the full length, 30 nm long DivIVA protein.
