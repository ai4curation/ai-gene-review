Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are posttranslationally inserted into either the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the mitochondrial outer membrane. The C-terminal 
transmembrane domains (TMDs) of TA proteins enable their many essential cellular 
functions by specifying the membrane target, but how cells process these 
targeting signals is poorly understood. Here, we reveal the composition of a 
conserved multiprotein TMD recognition complex (TRC) and show that distinct TRC 
subunits recognize the two types of TMD signals. By engineering mutations in a 
mitochondrial TMD, we switch over its TRC subunit recognition, thus leading to 
its misinsertion into the ER. Biochemical reconstitution with purified 
components demonstrates that TRC tethers and enzymatically activates Get3 to 
selectively hand off ER-bound TA proteins to Get3. Thus, ER-bound TA proteins 
are sorted at the top of a TMD chaperone cascade that culminates with the 
formation of Get3-TA protein complexes, which are recruited to the ER membrane 
for insertion.
