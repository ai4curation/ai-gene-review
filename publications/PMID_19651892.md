Histone lysine methyltransferase complexes are essential for chromatin 
organization and gene regulation. Whether any of this machinery functions in 
membrane traffic is unknown. In this study, we report that mammal Dpy-30 
(mDpy-30), a subunit of several histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase 
(H3K4MT) complexes, resides in the nucleus and at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). 
The TGN targeting of mDpy-30 is mediated by BIG1, a TGN-localized guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor for adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 
GTPases. Altering mDpy-30 levels changes the distribution of cation-independent 
mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) without affecting that of TGN46 or 
transferrin receptor. Our experiments also indicate that mDpy-30 functions in 
the endosome to TGN transport of CIMPR and that its knockdown results in the 
enrichment of internalized CIMPR and recycling endosomes near cell protrusions. 
Much like mDpy-30 depletion, the knockdown of Ash2L or RbBP5, two other H3K4MT 
subunits, leads to a similar redistribution of CIMPR. Collectively, these 
results suggest that mDpy-30 and probably H3K4MT play a role in the endosomal 
transport of specific cargo proteins.
