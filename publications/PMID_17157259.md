Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that SNIP1 (Smad nuclear-interacting 
protein 1) associates with c-Myc, a key regulator of cell proliferation and 
transformation. We demonstrate that SNIP1 functions as an important regulator of 
c-Myc activity, binding the N terminus of c-Myc through its own C terminus, and 
that SNIP1 enhances the transcriptional activity of c-Myc both by stabilizing it 
against proteosomal degradation and by bridging the c-Myc/p300 complex. These 
effects of SNIP1 on c-Myc likely contribute to synergistic effects of SNIP1, 
c-Myc, and H-Ras in inducing formation of foci in an in vitro transformation 
assay and also in supporting anchorage-independent growth. The significant 
association of SNIP1 and c-Myc staining in a non-small cell lung cancer tissue 
array is further evidence that their activities might be linked and suggests 
that SNIP1 might be an important modulator of c-Myc activity in carcinogenesis.
