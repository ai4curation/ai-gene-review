p23 is a co-chaperone of the heat shock protein Hsp90. p23 binds to Hsp90 in its 
ATP-bound state and, on its own, interacts specifically with non-native 
proteins. In our attempt to correlate these functions to specific regions of p23 
we have identified an unstructured region in p23 that maps to the C-terminal 
part of the protein sequence. This unstructured region is dispensible for 
interaction of p23 with Hsp90, since truncated p23 can still form complexes with 
Hsp90. In contrast, however, truncation of the C-terminal 30 amino acid residues 
of p23 affects the ability of p23 to bind non-native proteins and to prevent 
their non-specific aggregation. The isolated C-terminal region itself is not 
able to act as a chaperone nor is it possible to complement truncated p23 by 
addition of this peptide. These results imply that the binding site for Hsp90 is 
contained in the folded domain of p23 and that for efficient interaction of p23 
with non-native proteins both the folded domain and the C-terminal unstructured 
region are required.
