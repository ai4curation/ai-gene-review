A group of evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS proteins was 
initially defined by their ability to repress photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. 
It was proposed that this regulation be mediated by targeting degradation of key 
cellular regulators that promote photomorphogenesis. Among them, COP1 and the 
COP9 signalosome have been hypothesized to fulfill the roles as an ubiquitin 
ligase (E3) and an essential E3 modulator. Here we report that COP10 encodes a 
protein similar to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) variant proteins (UEV). 
COP10 is part of a nuclear protein complex and capable of directly interacting 
with both COP1 and the COP9 signalosome. Our data indicates that COP10 defines a 
possible E2 activity, thus validating the working hypothesis that the 
pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS group of proteins defined a protein ubiquitination 
pathway.

Abstract

A group of evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS
proteins was initially defined by their ability to repress
photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis . It was proposed that
this regulation be mediated by targeting degradation of key cellular
regulators that promote photomorphogenesis. Among them, COP1 and the
COP9 signalosome have been hypothesized to fulfill the roles as an
ubiquitin ligase (E3) and an essential E3 modulator. Here we report
that COP10 encodes a protein similar to ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme (E2) variant proteins (UEV). COP10 is part of a nuclear protein
complex and capable of directly interacting with both COP1 and the COP9
signalosome. Our data indicates that COP10 defines a possible E2
activity, thus validating the working hypothesis that the pleiotropic
COP/DET/FUS group of proteins defined a protein ubiquitination pathway.

Discussion

Taken together, our results have established that COP10 is another
component in addition to the COP1 and the COP9 signalosome in the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway responsible for repression of
photomorphogenesis in darkness. COP10 acts as a protein complex whose
stability and integrity depend on a functional COP9 signalosome. COP10
is capable of directly interacting with both the COP9 signalosome and
COP1 in the nucleus where these factors work together to mediate light
regulated degradation of HY5 and thus the light control of
photomorphogenic development. There are two possible biochemical
activities for the COP10 complex. The COP10 complex may simply serve as
a specific ubiquitin conjugation enzyme (E2) for the proposed E3
activity defined by COP1 ( Osterlund et al. 2000 ). This model is
illustrated in Figure 5 . Alternatively, the COP10 complex may
act as an E2 activity that promotes the formation of an unusual
ubiquitin chain on COP1 and thus positively regulates COP1 activity.
This would put COP10 function analogous to the E2V1 complex E2 activity
reported for both yeast and mammalian systems ( Hofmann and
Pickart 1999 ; Deng et al. 2000 ; VanDemark et al. 2001 ). In both models,
COP10 is part of a ubiquitin E2 activity that works together with COP1,
a putative E3, and the COP9 signalosome, an essential and conserved E3
modulator. In either of the two cases, the COP9 signalosome would be a
key participant in the process by directly associating with this E2â€“E3
complex. This role of the COP9 signalosome is in line with its reported
role in directly interacting with SCF type E3 ubiquitin ligases
( Schwechheimer and Deng 2001 ). This work thus supports the conclusion
that the evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic COP/DET/DET group of
proteins defines a ubiquitination pathway for regulated protein
degradation through the 26S proteasome.
