Caspases are cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinases, many of which play a 
central role in apoptosis. Here, we report the identification of a new murine 
caspase homologue, viz. caspase-14. It is most related to human/murine caspase-2 
and human caspase-9, possesses all the typical amino acid residues of the 
caspases involved in catalysis, including the QACRG box, and contains no or only 
a very short prodomain. Murine caspase-14 shows 83% similarity to human 
caspase-14. Human caspase-14 is assigned to chromosome 19p13.1. Northern blot 
analysis revealed that mRNA expression of caspase-14 is undetectable in all 
mouse adult tissues examined except for skin, while it is abundantly expressed 
in mouse embryos. In contrast to many other caspase family members, murine 
caspase-14 is not cleaved by granzyme B, caspase-1, caspase-2, caspase-3, 
caspase-6, caspase-7 or caspase-11, but is weakly processed into p18 and p11 
subunits by murine caspase-8. No aspartase activity of murine caspase-14 could 
be generated by bacterial or yeast expression. Transient overexpression of 
murine caspase-14 in mammalian cells did not elicit cell death and did not 
interfere with caspase-8-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, caspase-14 is a 
member of the caspase family but no proteolytic or biological activities have 
been identified so far. The high constitutive expression levels in embryos and 
specific expression in adult skin suggest a role in ontogenesis and skin 
physiology.
