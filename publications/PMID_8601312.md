The highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 family of proteins bind 
to a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle 
regulation. The nature and specificity of 14-3-3 binding is, however, not known. 
Here we show that 14-3-3 is a specific phosphoserine-binding protein. Using a 
panel of phosphorylated peptides based on Raf-1, we have defined the 14-3-3 
binding motif and show that most of the known 14-3-3 binding proteins contain 
the motif. Peptides containing the motif could disrupt 14-3-3 complexes and 
inhibit maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes. These results suggest that the 
interactions of 14-3-3 with signaling proteins are critical for the activation 
of signaling proteins. Our findings also suggest novel roles for 
serine/threonine phosphorylation in the assembly of protein-protein complexes.
