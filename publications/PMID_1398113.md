The amino acid (aa) sequence of human ribosomal protein S3a (hRPS3a) was deduced 
partially from the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding cDNA and confirmed 
by direct aa sequencing from the N terminus of the purified hRPS3a protein. The 
cDNA clone was isolated from a cDNA expression library in the pEX vector using 
antibodies. The hRPS3a protein has 263 aa and its calculated M(r) is 29 813.
