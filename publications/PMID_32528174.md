Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which consist of chromatin DNA filaments 
coated with granule proteins, are released by neutrophils to trap 
microorganisms1-3. Recent studies have suggested that the DNA component of NETs 
(NET-DNA) is associated with cancer metastasis in mouse models4-6. However, the 
functional role and clinical importance of NET-DNA in metastasis in patients 
with cancer remain unclear. Here we show that NETs are abundant in the liver 
metastases of patients with breast and colon cancers, and that serum NETs can 
predict the occurrence of liver metastases in patients with early-stage breast 
cancer. NET-DNA acts as a chemotactic factor to attract cancer cells, rather 
than merely acting as a 'trap' for them; in several mouse models, NETs in the 
liver or lungs were found to attract cancer cells to form distant metastases. We 
identify the transmembrane protein CCDC25 as a NET-DNA receptor on cancer cells 
that senses extracellular DNA and subsequently activates the ILK-β-parvin 
pathway to enhance cell motility. NET-mediated metastasis is abrogated in 
CCDC25-knockout cells. Clinically, we show that the expression of CCDC25 on 
primary cancer cells is closely associated with a poor prognosis for patients. 
Overall, we describe a transmembrane DNA receptor that mediates NET-dependent 
metastasis, and suggest that targeting CCDC25 could be an appealing therapeutic 
strategy for the prevention of cancer metastasis.
