The X-ray crystal structure of the Escherichia coli stress response protein HDEA 
has been determined at 2.0 A resolution. The single domain alpha-helical protein 
is found in the periplasmic space, where it supports an acid resistance 
phenotype essential for infectivity of enteric bacterial pathogens, such as 
Shigella and E. coli. Functional studies demonstrate that HDEA is activated by a 
dimer-to-monomer transition at acidic pH, leading to suppression of aggregation 
by acid-denatured proteins. We suggest that HDEA may support chaperone-like 
functions during the extremely acidic conditions.
