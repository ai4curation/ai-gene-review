Transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays an essential 
role in the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)- and interleukin-1beta 
(IL-1beta)-induced IkappaB kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation. Here we 
report that TNFalpha and IL-1beta induce Lys(63)-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination 
at the Lys(158) residue within the kinase domain. Tumor necrosis factor 
receptor-associated factors 2 and 6 (TRAF2 and -6) act as the ubiquitin E3 
ligases to mediate Lys(63)-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys(158) 
residue in vivo and in vitro. Lys(63)-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the 
Lys(158) residue is required for TAK1-mediated IKK complex recruitment. 
Reconstitution of TAK1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast cells with TAK1 wild 
type or a TAK1 mutant containing a K158R mutation revealed the importance of 
this site in TNFalpha and IL-1beta-mediated IKK/NF-kappaB and JNK/AP-1 
activation as well as IL-6 gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that 
Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 at Lys(158) is essential for its own 
kinase activation and its ability to mediate its downstream signal transduction

Abstract

Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays an essential role in the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)- and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced IκB kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation. Here we report that TNFα and IL-1β induce Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys 158 residue within the kinase domain. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 2 and 6 (TRAF2 and -6) act as the ubiquitin E3 ligases to mediate Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys 158 residue in vivo and in vitro . Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys 158 residue is required for TAK1-mediated IKK complex recruitment. Reconstitution of TAK1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblast cells with TAK1 wild type or a TAK1 mutant containing a K158R mutation revealed the importance of this site in TNFα and IL-1β-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation as well as IL-6 gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 at Lys 158 is essential for its own kinase activation and its ability to mediate its downstream signal transduction pathways in response to TNFα and IL-1β stimulation.

Introduction

Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) 3 and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) are two potent proinflammatory cytokines that play important roles in the regulation of immunity, inflammation, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis ( 1 , 2 ). Cellular responses to TNFα and IL-1β are mediated by intracellular signaling pathways that control the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) ( 3 , 4 ).

Upon binding to its receptor, TNFα induces formation of a receptor-associated complex, including the adaptor proteins TRADD, TRAF2, TRAF5, and RIP1, which subsequently leads to Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of TRAF2 and RIP1 ( 5 – 7 ). In contrast, IL-1β binding to its receptor induces a receptor-associated complex formation, including MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6, which is followed by Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6 and IRAKs ( 8 – 12 ). The formation of TRAF2-RIP1 and TRAF6-IRAK4 complexes as well as the Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of RIP1 and TRAF6 appear to enable the recruitment and activation of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) through binding of the TAK1 regulatory subunits TAB2 and TAB3 to the Lys 63 -polyubiquitinated RIP1 and TRAF6. The activated TAK1 then triggers the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK ( 8 , 13 – 17 ), which leads to activation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 and up-regulation of many genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and proteolytic enzymes ( 18 ).

The IKK complex consists of three subunits: two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and an essential regulatory subunit, IKKγ/NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) ( 3 , 19 ). Genetic studies have implicated that IKKβ and IKKγ/NEMO are essential for the TNFα- and IL-1β-mediated NF-κB activation ( 20 – 22 ). Phosphorylation of serine 177 and 181 residues in the activation loop is required for IKKβ activation ( 23 ). IKKγ/NEMO has been indicated to bind Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitin chains ( 7 , 16 , 24 , 25 ). It is proposed that Lys 63 -polyubiquitin chains act as a scaffold to allow for assembly of a signaling complex that leads to IKKβ activation. Once activated, IKKβ phosphorylates IκB proteins and leads to IκB polyubiquitination with a Lys 48 -linked ubiquitin chain. Polyubiquitination-mediated degradation of IκBs allows NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and activate NF-κB-dependent gene expression ( 26 ).

JNKs are members of three related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), JNKs, and p38 MAPKs ( 4 , 27 ). JNKs and p38 MAPKs are involved in transmitting intracellular signals in response to proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-1β, and environmental stresses ( 28 ). Once activated, JNKs phosphorylate specific sites on the N-terminal transactivation domain of transcription factor c-Jun, an important component of transcriptional activator AP-1. Phosphorylation of these sites stimulates the transactivity of c-Jun to activate AP-1-dependent gene expression ( 29 ).

TAK1, a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family, was originally found to function in the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-mediated MAPK activation ( 30 ). TAK1 has been demonstrated to be essential in TNFα- and IL-1β-mediated activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 ( 15 , 31 – 33 ). Several regulatory subunits of TAK1, including TAB1, TAB2, TAB3, and TAB4, have been implicated to play a role in the regulation of TAK1 activity in response to TNFα and IL-1β stimulation ( 13 , 34 – 37 ). TAB1 is a TAK1-interacting protein and induces TAK1 kinase activity through promoting autophosphorylation of key serine/threonine sites of the kinase activation loop ( 36 ). TAB1 is an inactive pseudophosphatase sharing homology with members of the PPM family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases ( 38 ). TAB2, TAB3, and TAB4 activate TAK1 through binding to polyubiquitinated proteins and promoting a larger complex formation during TNFα- and IL-1β-induced TAK1 activation ( 15 , 37 ).

Currently, growing evidence suggests that protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination play an essential role in the regulation of TAK1 activation. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis inhibits JNK1 activation by TGF-β1 through ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation of TAK1 ( 39 ). Furthermore, several reports suggest TAK1 ubiquitination is involved in the regulation of TAK1-mediated signaling pathways ( 40 – 42 ). Recently, TRAF6-mediated Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys 34 residue has been shown to correlate with TAK1 activation in TGF-β signaling ( 43 ). Helicobacter pylori CagA activates NF-κB by targeting TAK1 for TRAF6-mediated Lys 63 -linked ubiquitination ( 44 ). However, the molecular regulation of TAK1 activation by TNFα- and IL-1β-induced protein ubiquitination remains poorly understood.

In this report, we have further investigated the molecular mechanism of TAK1 activation in the context of TNFα and IL-1β stimulation. Using biochemical and reporter assays, we identified the Lys 158 residue within TAK1 kinase domain as a Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination site required for TAK1-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation. Furthermore, we found that polyubiquitination of Lys 158 residue can be induced by TNFα and IL-1β stimulation and is required for TNFα- and IL-1β-induced IKKγ/NEMO association with TAK1. In addition, we found that Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys 158 residue is essential for TNFα and IL-1β-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation as well as IL-6 gene expression. Together, our results provide biochemical and genetic evidence that the TNFα- and IL-1β-induced Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at Lys 158 is essential for TNFα and IL-1β-induced TAK1 activation and TAK1-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation.

DISCUSSION

In this report, we further examined the mechanism of ubiquitination in TNFα- and IL-1β-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation and gained novel insights into the regulatory role of Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination in the TAK1-mediated NF-κB and AP-1 activation. Here we show that TAK1 is polyubiquitinated with a Lys 63 -linked ubiquitin chain at the Lys 158 residue within its kinase domain in response to TNFα and IL-1β stimulation and that Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 at the Lys 158 residue binds to IKKγ/NEMO, resulting in the recruitment of IKK complexes to the activated TAK1. Furthermore, we show that TRAF2 and TRAF6 are the Ub E3 ligases that mediate Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of TAK1. Interestingly, a lysine to arginine mutation at Lys 158 of TAK1 blocks TNFα- and IL-1β-induced TAK1 polyubiquitination and downstream IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation. Taken together, our results indicate that Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 at Lys 158 and binding of polyubiquitinated TAK1 by IKKγ/NEMO are required for the TNFα- and IL-1-mediated IKK activation. In addition to the polyubiquitin chains on RIP1, TRAF2/6 and IRAKs, the polyubiquitin chains on TAK1 also serve as a part of a platform to recruit the IKK complex, JNK, and p38 MAPKs, allowing TAK1 to activate IKK, JNK, and p38-mediated signal transductions. We propose that Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of TAK1 at Lys 158 within the kinase domain is a general mechanism for TAK1-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation.

TRAF2/RIP1 and TRAF6/IRAKs are proximal signaling components in TNFα and IL-1β receptor-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation, respectively ( 6 , 7 ). Both TRAF2 and TRAF6 contain a RING domain that confers their E3 activity ( 46 ). Our studies demonstrate that TRAF2 and TRAF6 specifically catalyze TAK1 ubiquitination at the Lys 158 residue in vivo and in vitro . Considering there are 34 lysine residues in TAK1 protein sequence, it is very unusual that TRAF2- and TRAF6-mediated TAK1 polyubiquitination is so site-specific and consistent in both in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays. In the case of RIP1, none of the lysine mutations prevented RIP1 ubiquitination or NF-κB activation once overexpressed in HEK-293T cells ( 7 ).

Previous studies suggest that TAK1 as a serine/threonine kinase is recruited to receptor associated TRAF2/RIP1 and TRAF6/IRAKs through binding of TAB2 and TAB3 to polyubiquitinated RIP1 and IRAKs in response to TNFα and IL-1β stimulation, whereas the IKK complex is recruited via binding of IKKγ/NEMO to the polyubiquitin chain on RIP1 and IRAKs ( 8 – 12 ). Our current results demonstrate that TAK1 is polyubiquitinated at the Lys 158 residue, and this site-specific Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination is required for binding of NEMO to TAK1 in response to TNFα and IL-1β stimulation. Previous structure studies indicate that TAK1 Lys 158 residue is on the surface of the protein structure and exposed to solvent ( 50 ). Therefore, the TAK1 K158R mutation should not induce any significant structural perturbation ( supplemental Fig. S6 ). Consistent with this study, we found that both TRAF2 and TRAF6 successfully catalyzed TAK1 K63R polyubiquitination in an in vitro ubiquitination assay ( supplemental Fig. S1 ). Together, these results suggest that TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys 158 residue contributes to the formation of TNFα- and IL-1β-induced intracellular signaling complex that is essential for optimal downstream IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation.

Interestingly, as two serine/threonine kinases, RIP1 and IRAK1 are polyubiquitinated with a Lys 63 linkage type at lysine residues outside of their kinase domain in response to TNFα and IL-1β stimulation, respectively ( 8 – 12 ). In addition, Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of these two kinases are not reported to be involved in the regulation of their kinase activities. Furthermore, site-specific monoubiquitination of IKKβ within its kinase domain regulates its persistent activation ( 51 ). In contrast, TNFα- and IL-1β-induced Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination within the kinase domain is required for TNFα- and IL-1β-induced activation of TAK1 and the downstream signal transduction pathway.

Using a HeLa cell line stably expressing FLAG-TAK1 wild type and K158R mutant, we found that TNFα and IL-1β induced binding of IKKγ/NEMO to TAK1 wild type but not K158R mutant. This result strongly indicates that TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys 158 residue is essential for TNFα- and IL-1β-induced association of TAK1 with IKKγ/NEMO. It is highly likely that only polyubiquitinated TAK1 is able to phosphorylate and activate the IKKγ/NEMO-associated IKKβ in a complex containing the ubiquitinated TAK1, IKKγ/NEMO, and IKKβ. Further study is required to dissect the mechanism by which polyubiquitinated TAK1 is recruited to the receptor-associated protein complex and activates IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 in response to TNFα and IL-1β stimulation.

Our data show that polyubiquitination of TAK1 is not only required for TAK-1-mediated IKKβ activation but also for JNK and p38 activation. Importantly, we also failed to observe the phosphorylation at the Thr 178 , Thr 184 , and Thr 187 residues in the activation loop of TAK1 upon co-overexpression of TAK1 K158R with TAB1 in HEK-293T cells (data not shown). These results suggest that polyubiquitination of TAK1 at the Lys 158 residue is not only required for maintaining the receptor-associated complex formation but also essential for TAK1 phosphorylation and activation. Further studies are needed to determine the molecular mechanism of Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination in the regulation of TAK1 activation.

During preparation of this paper, Sorrentino et al. ( 43 ) reported that TRAF6-mediated Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys 34 residue correlates with TGF-β-induced TAK1 activation. TAK1 Lys 34 is located at the N terminus of the TAK1 protein sequence, outside of its kinase domain. Surprisingly, we did not find any role of the Lys 34 residue in TRAF2- and TRAF6-mediated Lys 63 -linked TAK1 polyubiquitination and NF-κB activation. Therefore, more work is needed to determine whether Lys 34 residue is an actual Ub lysine acceptor site on TAK1 in TGF-β signaling. However, it is possible that TRAF6 mediates TAK1 polyubiquitination at different sites in different signaling pathways.

In summary, our study revealed that polyubiquitination of TAK1 at the Lys 158 residue within the kinase activation loop is required for TNFα and IL-1β-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation. Importantly, our finding in this study is the first report that Lys 63 -linked polyubiquitination of a serine/threonine kinase within the kinase activation loop is required for kinase activation and proinflammatory cytokine TNFα- and IL-1β-mediated signal transduction. In view of the data presented here and in previous reports, we propose a working model ( Fig. 9 ) in which, upon TNFα and IL-1β binding to their cognate receptors, the receptor-mediated signaling events induce TRAF2/6-mediated TAK1 polyubiquitination at the Lys 158 and phosphorylation at the Thr 178 /Thr 184 /Thr 187 /Ser 192 residues within the kinase domain, which in turn trigger the activation of TAK1-mediated IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 as well as NF-κB- and AP-1-dependent IL-6 gene expression in the cells.
