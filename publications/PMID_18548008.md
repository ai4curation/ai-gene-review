B-Myb is one member of the vertebrate Myb family of transcription factors and is 
ubiquitously expressed. B-Myb activates transcription of a group of genes 
required for the G2/M cell cycle transition by forming the dREAM/Myb-MuvB-like 
complex, which was originally identified in Drosophila. Mutants of zebrafish 
B-myb and Drosophila myb exhibit defects in cell cycle progression and genome 
instability. Although the genome instability caused by a loss of B-Myb has been 
speculated to be due to abnormal cell cycle progression, the precise mechanism 
remains unknown. Here, we have purified a B-Myb complex containing clathrin and 
filamin (Myb-Clafi complex). This complex is required for normal localization of 
clathrin at the mitotic spindle, which was previously reported to stabilize 
kinetochore fibres. The Myb-Clafi complex is not tightly associated with the 
mitotic spindles, suggesting that this complex ferries clathrin to the mitotic 
spindles. Thus, identification of the Myb-Clafi complex reveals a previously 
unrecognized function of B-Myb that may contribute to its role in chromosome 
stability, possibly, tumour suppression.
