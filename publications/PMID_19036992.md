Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a microtubule-associated tubulin deacetylase, 
plays a significant role in the formation of protein aggregates in many 
neurodegenerative disorders. Parkin, a protein-ubiquitin E3 ligase linked to 
Parkinson's disease, accumulates at the centrosome in a microtubule-dependent 
manner in response to proteasome inhibition. Here, we show that the centrosome 
recruitment of parkin was mediated by its direct binding to HDAC6 through 
multiple interaction domains. The tubulin deacetylase activity of HDAC6 was 
required for the accumulation of parkin as well as its dispersion upon the 
reversal of proteasome inhibition. The bidirectional movements of parkin 
required intact microtubule network and were dependent on dynein and kinesin 1, 
respectively. Tubulin deacetylation increases microtubule dynamicity and may 
thus facilitate microtubule-based trafficking of the parkin-HDAC6 complex. The 
results suggest that HDAC6 acts as a sensor of proteasome inhibition and directs 
the trafficking of parkin by using different motor proteins.
