Target of rapamycin (TOR), a conserved protein kinase and central controller of 
cell growth, functions in two structurally and functionally distinct complexes: 
TORC1 and TORC2. Dysregulation of mammalian TOR (mTOR) signaling is implicated 
in pathologies that include diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. We resolved 
the architecture of human mTORC1 (mTOR with subunits Raptor and mLST8) bound to 
FK506 binding protein (FKBP)-rapamycin, by combining cryo-electron microscopy at 
5.9 angstrom resolution with crystallographic studies of Chaetomium thermophilum 
Raptor at 4.3 angstrom resolution. The structure explains how FKBP-rapamycin and 
architectural elements of mTORC1 limit access to the recessed active site. 
Consistent with a role in substrate recognition and delivery, the conserved 
amino-terminal domain of Raptor is juxtaposed to the kinase active site.
