In the highly concentrated environment of the cell, polypeptide chains are prone 
to aggregation during synthesis (as nascent chains await the emergence of the 
remainder of their folding domain), translocation, assembly, and exposure to 
stresses that cause previously folded proteins to unfold. A large and diverse 
group of proteins, known as chaperones, transiently associate with such folding 
intermediates to prevent aggregation, but in many cases the specific functions 
of individual chaperones are still not clear. In vivo, Hsp90 (heat shock protein 
90) plays a role in the maturation of components of signal transduction pathways 
but also exhibits chaperone activity with diverse proteins in vitro, suggesting 
a more general function. We used a unique temperature-sensitive mutant of Hsp90 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which rapidly and completely loses activity on 
shift to high temperatures, to examine the breadth of Hsp90 functions in vivo. 
The data suggest that Hsp90 is not required for the de novo folding of most 
proteins, but it is required for a specific subset of proteins that have greater 
difficulty reaching their native conformations. Under conditions of stress, 
Hsp90 does not generally protect proteins from thermal inactivation but does 
enhance the rate at which a heat-damaged protein is reactivated. Thus, although 
Hsp90 is one of the most abundant chaperones in the cell, its in vivo functions 
are highly restricted.
