The tumor suppressor VHL gene product (pVHL), recently reported to bind to 
elongins B and C, is thought to regulate transcription elongation. To establish 
whether the VHL gene may have other functions, we here searched for additional 
cellular protein(s) that might bind to pVHL using a two-hybrid system and 
identified seven independent clones, including elongin C, but not elongin B. 
Three clones (unknown, imidopeptidase, and unknown) presumably bind to the 
N-terminal nonconserved region, whereas the four other clones [elongin C, the 
HIV tat-binding protein, the actin-binding protein Filamin (ABP280), and the 
HIBBJ46 (named VBP-1)] were found to bind to the wild-type pVHL but not to a 
C-terminal 156-amino acid deletion mutant. Interestingly, the HIV tat-binding 
protein and Filamin could bind to C-terminal 26-amino acid deleted pVHL, but 
elongin C and VBP-1 failed to do so. Thus, elongin C and VBP-1 require the 
C-terminal end of pVHL for binding. It was also established that epitope-tagged 
pVHL strongly forms complexes with VBP-1 in vivo using immunoprecipitation 
Western blotting analysis. VBP-1 was widely expressed in various cell lines 
tested, in which VHL mRNA can be detected. When the VBP-1 protein was solely 
expressed, it located to the cytoplasm and did not localize to the nucleus. 
However, when coexpressed with VHL, it can translocate to the nucleus. These 
results indicate that VBP-1 can form a complex with VHL protein in vivo and 
hence VHL affects the intracellular localization of VBP-1 protein.
