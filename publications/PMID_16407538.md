sorLA is a recently identified neuronal receptor for amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) that is known to interact with APP and affect its intracellular transport 
and processing. Decreased levels of sorLA in the brain of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) patients and elevated levels of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in 
sorLA-deficient mice point to the importance of the receptor in this 
neurodegenerative disorder. We analyzed APP cleavage in an APP-shedding assay 
and found that both sorLA and, surprisingly, a sorLA tail construct inhibited 
APP cleavage in a beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE)-dependent manner. In line 
with this finding, sorLA and the sorLA tail significantly reduced secreted Abeta 
levels when BACE was overexpressed, suggesting that sorLA influences 
beta-cleavage. To understand the effect of sorLA on APP cleavage by BACE, we 
analyzed whether sorLA interacts with APP and/or BACE. Because both full-length 
sorLA and sorLA C-terminal tail constructs were functionally relevant for APP 
processing, we analyzed sorLA-APP for a potential cytoplasmatic interaction 
domain. sorLA and C99 coimmunoprecipitated, pointing toward the existence of a 
new cytoplasmatic interaction site between sorLA and APP. Moreover, sorLA and 
BACE also coimmunoprecipitate. Thus, sorLA interacts both with BACE and APP and 
might therefore directly affect BACE-APP complex formation. To test whether 
sorLA impacts BACE-APP interactions, we used a fluorescence resonance energy 
transfer assay to evaluate BACE-APP interactions in cells. We discovered that 
sorLA significantly reduced BACE-APP interactions in Golgi. We postulate that 
sorLA acts as a trafficking receptor that prevents BACE-APP interactions and 
hence BACE cleavage of APP.
