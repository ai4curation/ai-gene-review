During stress-induced apoptosis, the initiator caspase-9 is activated by the 
Apaf-1 apoptosome and must remain bound to retain significant catalytic 
activity. Nevertheless, in apoptotic cells the vast majority of processed 
caspase-9 is paradoxically observed outside the complex. We show herein that 
apoptosome-mediated cleavage of procaspase-9 occurs exclusively through a 
CARD-displacement mechanism, so that unlike the effector procaspase-3, 
procaspase-9 cannot be processed by the apoptosome as a typical substrate. 
Indeed, procaspase-9 possessed higher affinity for the apoptosome and could 
displace the processed caspase-9 from the complex, thereby facilitating a 
continuous cycle of procaspase-9 recruitment/activation, processing, and release 
from the complex. Owing to its rapid autocatalytic cleavage, however, 
procaspase-9 per se contributed little to the activation of procaspase-3. Thus, 
the Apaf-1 apoptosome functions as a proteolytic-based 'molecular timer', 
wherein the intracellular concentration of procaspase-9 sets the overall 
duration of the timer, procaspase-9 autoprocessing activates the timer, and the 
rate at which the processed caspase-9 dissociates from the complex (and thus 
loses its capacity to activate procaspase-3) dictates how fast the timer 'ticks' 
over.
