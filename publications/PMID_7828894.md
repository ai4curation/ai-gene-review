Rod photoreceptor cyclic GMP-phosphodiesterase (cGMP-PDE) is one of the key 
enzymes of the visual phototransduction cascade in the vertebrate retina. The 
holoenzyme is a heterotetrameric complex, consisting of two large catalytic 
subunits, alpha (88 kDa) and beta (84 kDa), and two identical inhibitory 
subunits, gamma (11 kDa). Here we present the complete nucleotide sequence of 
the gene (cGMP-PDE gamma) encoding the cGMP-PDE gamma-subunit from human rod 
photoreceptors. The transcribed region of the human cGMP-PDE gamma codes for a 
protein of 87 amino acids and consists of four exons interrupted by three 
introns. The first intron is located in the 5'-untranslated region. The 
5'-flanking region contains TATA-like and CAAT boxes which may serve as 
regulatory elements. The 5'-untranslated sequence (exon I) includes a potential 
SP1 transcription factor-binding site (GC core hexanucleotide). In addition, 
there were five AluI repetitive elements found in the cGMP-PDE gamma, three in 
the first intron and two in the second intron.
