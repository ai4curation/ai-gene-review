By using a yeast two-hybrid assay, cyclic AMP-response-element-binding 
protein-related protein (CREB-RP), also called activating transcription factor 
6beta (ATF6beta), was identified as a cellular protein that interacts with the 
NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus. An N-terminal half of NS4B and a central 
portion of CREB-RP/ATF6beta containing the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain 
were involved in the interaction. The interaction between NS4B and 
CREB-RP/ATF6beta was demonstrated also in mammalian cells by 
co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analyses using specific 
antibodies. The bZIP domain of ATF6alpha, which shares high sequence similarity 
with CREB-RP/ATF6beta, was also shown to interact with NS4B in yeast although 
the interaction was weaker than that between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta. 
CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha are known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress-induced transcription factors. Collectively, our results imply the 
possibility that NS4B modulates certain cellular responses upon ER stress 
through the physical interaction with CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha.
