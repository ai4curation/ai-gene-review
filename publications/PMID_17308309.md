Oxidative stress is a major aspect of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. We have 
investigated the relationship between oxidative stress and neuronal binding of 
Abeta oligomers (also known as ADDLs). ADDLs are known to accumulate in brain 
tissue of AD patients and are considered centrally related to pathogenesis. 
Using hippocampal neuronal cultures, we found that ADDLs stimulated excessive 
formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a mechanism requiring 
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) activation. ADDL binding to neurons was 
reduced and ROS formation was completely blocked by an antibody to the 
extracellular domain of the NR1 subunit of NMDA-Rs. In harmony with a steric 
inhibition of ADDL binding by NR1 antibodies, ADDLs that were bound to 
detergent-extracted synaptosomal membranes co-immunoprecipitated with NMDA-R 
subunits. The NR1 antibody did not affect ROS formation induced by NMDA, showing 
that NMDA-Rs themselves remained functional. Memantine, an open channel NMDA-R 
antagonist prescribed as a memory-preserving drug for AD patients, completely 
protected against ADDL-induced ROS formation, as did other NMDA-R antagonists. 
Memantine and the anti-NR1 antibody also attenuated a rapid ADDL-induced 
increase in intraneuronal calcium, which was essential for stimulated ROS 
formation. These results show that ADDLs bind to or in close proximity to 
NMDA-Rs, triggering neuronal damage through NMDA-R-dependent calcium flux. This 
response provides a pathologically specific mechanism for the therapeutic action 
of memantine, indicates a role for ROS dysregulation in ADDL-induced cognitive 
impairment, and supports the unifying hypothesis that ADDLs play a central role 
in AD pathogenesis.
