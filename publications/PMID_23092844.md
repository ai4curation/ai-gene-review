Exosomes are secreted by many cell types and display multiple biological 
functions. The ability to both rapidly detect and quantify exosomes in 
biological samples would assist in the screening of agents that interfere with 
their release, and which may therefore be of clinical relevance. Nanoparticle 
tracking analysis, which detects the size and concentration of exosomes, was 
used to monitor the inhibition of exosome secretion from MDA-MB-231 breast 
cancer cells expressing inhibitory RNA targeted for Rab27a, a known component of 
the exosome pathway. Inhibition of both Rab27a and Rab27b was observed, 
resulting in alterations to intracellular CD63+ compartments and the release of 
fewer exosomes into the culture medium, as determined by nanoparticle tracking 
analysis and confirmed by immunoblotting and protein quantification. These data 
show that nanoparticle tracking analysis can be used effectively and rapidly to 
monitor the disruption of exosome secretion.
