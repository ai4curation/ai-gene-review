Additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1, 170 kDa), a mammalian homolog of Drosophila 
ASX, was identified as a protein that interacts with retinoic acid receptor 
(RAR) in the presence of retinoic acid (RA). Systematic binding assays showed 
that the C-terminal nuclear receptor box (LVMQLL) of ASXL1 and the activation 
function-2 activation domain (AF-2 AD) core of the RAR are critical for 
ligand-dependent interaction. The interaction was confirmed using in vitro 
glutathione S-transferase pulldown and in vivo immunoprecipitation (IP) assays. 
Confocal microscopy revealed that ASXL1 localizes in the nucleus. In addition to 
the intrinsic transactivation function of ASXL1, its cotransfection together 
with an RA-responsive luciferase reporter increased the RAR activity. This ASXL1 
activity appears to be mediated through the functional cooperation with SRC-1, 
as shown by GST pulldown, IP, chromatin IP, and transcription assays. In the 
presence of ASXL1, more acetylated histone H3 was accumulated on the 
RA-responsive promoter in response to RA. Finally, stable expression of ASXL1 
increased the expression of endogenous RA-regulated genes and enhanced the 
antiproliferative potential of RA. Overall, these results suggest that ASXL1 is 
a novel coactivator of RAR that cooperates with SRC-1 and implicates it as a 
potential antitumor target of RA in RA-resistant cancer cells.
