Reticulons (RTNs) constitute a family of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated 
proteins with a reticular distribution. Recently, evidence has shown that they 
exert a cancer-speciﬁc proapoptotic function via interaction or modulation of 
speciﬁc proteins. Such evidence is particularly associated with the RTN1-C 
family members. In order to explore proteins that interact with RTN1-C, the 
yeast two-hybrid system and regular molecular biological techniques were used to 
screen the human fetal brain cDNA library. As a result, seven RTN1-C interacting 
proteins including Homo sapiens mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic 
factor (MANF) were obtained. The interactions between RTN1-C and its interacting 
proteins were confirmed by β-galactosidase assay and growth test in selective 
media. Moreover, the MANF/RTN1-C interaction was verified in vitro by 
glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay and in vivo by immunoprecipitation 
assay. By immunoﬂuorescence assay, it was found that MANF co-localized with 
RTN1-C in the ER. Knockdown of RTN1-C reduced the localization of MANF in the 
ER. These results provide clues to further explore the function of RTN1-C and 
MANF in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.
