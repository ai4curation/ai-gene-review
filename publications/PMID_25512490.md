Without a fully developed initial segment, the most proximal region of the 
epididymis, male infertility results. Therefore, it is important to understand 
the development and regulation of this crucial region. In addition to 
distinctively high activity levels of the components of the ERK pathway, which 
are essential for initial-segment differentiation, the initial segment exhibits 
high protein and activity levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). To 
understand the role of PTEN in the regulation of the initial segment, we 
generated a mouse model with a conditional deletion of Pten from the epithelial 
cells of the proximal epididymis from postnatal day 17 (P17) onward. Shortly 
after Pten deletion, hypertrophy of the proximal epididymis became evident. Loss 
of Pten resulted in activation of the AKT (protein kinase B) pathway components 
from P28 onward, which in turn gradually suppressed RAF1 proto-oncogene 
serine/threonine kinase (RAF1)/ERK signaling through the interaction between AKT 
and RAF1. Consistent with progressive changes in RAF1/ERK signaling, loss of 
Pten progressively altered cell shape, size, organization, proliferation, and 
survival in the initial-segment epithelium and resulted in dedifferentiation and 
extensive epithelial folding. Most importantly, knockout males progressively 
lost fertility and became infertile from 6 to 12 mo. Spermatozoa from older 
knockout mice showed a lower percentage of motility and a higher percentage of 
flagellar angulation compared with controls, suggesting compromised sperm 
maturation. Therefore, under normal physiological conditions, PTEN suppresses 
AKT activity to maintain activation of the RAF1/ERK signaling pathway, which in 
turn maintains normal function of the initial segment and therefore, normal 
sperm maturation.
