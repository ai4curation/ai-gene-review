Little is known about the spliceosome's structure before its extensive 
remodeling into a catalytically active complex. Here, we report a 3D cryo-EM 
structure of a pre-catalytic human spliceosomal B complex. The U2 
snRNP-containing head domain is connected to the B complex main body via three 
main bridges. U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP proteins, which are located in the main body, 
undergo significant rearrangements during tri-snRNP integration into the 
B complex. These include formation of a partially closed Prp8 conformation that 
creates, together with Dim1, a 5' splice site (ss) binding pocket, displacement 
of Sad1, and rearrangement of Brr2 such that it contacts its U4/U6 substrate and 
is poised for the subsequent spliceosome activation step. The molecular 
organization of several B-specific proteins suggests that they are involved in 
negatively regulating Brr2, positioning the U6/5'ss helix, and stabilizing the B 
complex structure. Our results indicate significant differences between the 
early activation phase of human and yeast spliceosomes.
