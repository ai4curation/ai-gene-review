Despite the fact that physiological evidence points to the existence of a 
functional Na-K-Cl cotransporter in the mammary gland, the molecular identity of 
this transport process remains unknown. We now show that the Na-K-Cl 
cotransporter isoform, NKCC1, is expressed in mammary tissue. Developmental 
profiling revealed that the level of NKCC1 protein was significantly influenced 
by the stage of mammary gland development, and immunolocalization studies 
demonstrated that NKCC1 was present on the basolateral membrane of mammary 
epithelial cells. To examine whether functional NKCC1 is required for mammary 
epithelial cell development, we used NKCC1 -/- mice. We demonstrate that NKCC1 
-/- mammary epithelium exhibited a significant delay in ductal outgrowth and an 
increase in branching morphogenesis during virgin development. These effects 
were autonomous to the epithelium as assessed by mammary gland transplantation. 
Although the absence of NKCC1 had no apparent effect on gross mammary epithelial 
cell morphology during lactation, pups born to NKCC1 -/- mice failed to thrive. 
Finally, analysis of NKCC1 protein in mouse models that exhibit defects in 
mammary gland development demonstrate that high levels of NKCC1 protein are 
indicative of ductal epithelial cells, and the presence of NKCC1 protein is 
characteristic of mammary epithelial cell identity.
