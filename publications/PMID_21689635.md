Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is the most frequent genetic cause of end-stage renal 
failure in children and young adults. NPHP8/RPGRIP1L is a novel ciliary gene 
that, when mutated, in addition to causing NPHP, also causes Joubert syndrome 
(JBTS) and Meckel syndrome (MKS). The exact function of NPHP8 and how defects in 
NPHP8 lead to human diseases are poorly understood. Here, we studied the 
Caenorhabditis elegans homolog nphp-8 (C09G5.8) and explored the possible 
function of NPHP-8 in ciliated sensory neurons. We determined the gene structure 
of nphp-8 through rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis and 
discovered an X-box motif that had been previously overlooked. Moreover, NPHP-8 
co-localized with NPHP-4 at the transition zone at the base of cilia. Mutation 
of nphp-8 led to abnormal dye filling (Dyf) and shorter cilia lengths in a 
subset of ciliary neurons. In addition, chemotaxis to several volatile 
attractants was significantly impaired in nphp-8 mutants. Our data suggest that 
NPHP-8/RPGRIP1L plays an important role in cilia formation and cilia-mediated 
chemosensation in a cell type-specific manner.
