Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-13 are cytokines critical to the development of T 
cell-mediated humoral immune responses, which are associated with allergy and 
asthma, and exert their actions through three different combinations of shared 
receptors. Here we present the crystal structures of the complete set of type I 
(IL-4R alpha/gamma(c)/IL-4) and type II (IL-4R alpha/IL-13R alpha1/IL-4, IL-4R 
alpha/IL-13R alpha1/IL-13) ternary signaling complexes. The type I complex 
reveals a structural basis for gamma(c)'s ability to recognize six different 
gamma(c)-cytokines. The two type II complexes utilize an unusual top-mounted 
Ig-like domain on IL-13R alpha1 for a novel mode of cytokine engagement that 
contributes to a reversal in the IL-4 versus IL-13 ternary complex assembly 
sequences, which are mediated through substantially different recognition 
chemistries. We also show that the type II receptor heterodimer signals with 
different potencies in response to IL-4 versus IL-13 and suggest that the 
extracellular cytokine-receptor interactions are modulating intracellular 
membrane-proximal signaling events.
