Expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is greatly enhanced during neuronal 
differentiation, but the nature of the molecular mechanisms remains to be fully 
defined. In this study, we observed that nerve growth factor treatment of PC12 
cells leads to a progressive increase in the expression of AChE transcripts, 
reaching approximately 3.5-fold by 72 h. Given that the AChE 3'-untranslated 
region (UTR) contains an AU-rich element, we focused on the potential role of 
the RNA-binding protein HuD in mediating the increase in AChE mRNA seen in 
differentiating neurons. Using PC12 cells engineered to stably express HuD or an 
antisense to HuD, our studies indicate that HuD can regulate the abundance of 
AChE transcripts in neuronal cells. Furthermore, transfection of a reporter 
construct containing the AChE 3'-UTR showed that this 3'-UTR can increase 
expression of the reporter gene product in cells expressing HuD but not in cells 
expressing the antisense. RNA gel shifts and Northwestern blots revealed an 
increase in the binding of several protein complexes in differentiated neurons. 
Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that HuD can bind directly AChE 
transcripts. These results show the importance of post-transcriptional 
mechanisms in regulating AChE expression in differentiating neurons and 
implicate HuD as a key trans-acting factor in these events.
