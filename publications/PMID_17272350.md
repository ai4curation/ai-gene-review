We have proposed a model of intestinal glucose absorption in which transport by 
SGLT1 induces rapid insertion and activation of GLUT2 in the apical membrane by 
a PKC betaII-dependent mechanism. Since PKC betaII requires Ca(2+) and glucose 
is depolarizing, we have investigated whether glucose absorption is regulated by 
the entry of dietary Ca(2+) through Ca(v)1.3 in the apical membrane. When rat 
jejunum was perfused with 75 mM glucose, Ca(2+)-deplete conditions, or perfusion 
with the L-type antagonists nifedipine and verapamil strongly diminished the 
phloretin-sensitive apical GLUT2, but not the phloretin-insensitive SGLT1 
component of glucose absorption. Western blotting showed that in each case there 
was a significant decrease in apical GLUT2 level, but no change in SGLT1 level. 
Inhibition of apical GLUT2 absorption coincided with inhibition of 
unidirectional (45)Ca(2+) entry by nifedipine and verapamil. At 10 mM luminal 
Ca(2+), (45)Ca(2+) absorption in the presence of 75 mM glucose was 2- to 3-fold 
that in the presence of 75 mM mannitol. The glucose-induced component was 
SGLT1-dependent and nifedipine-sensitive. RT-PCR revealed the presence of 
Ca(v)beta(3) in jejunal mucosa; Western blotting and immunocytochemistry 
localized Ca(v)beta(3) to the apical membrane, together with Ca(v)1.3. We 
conclude that in times of dietary sufficiency Ca(v)1.3 may mediate a significant 
pathway of glucose-stimulated Ca(2+) entry into the body and that luminal supply 
of Ca(2+) is necessary for GLUT2-mediated glucose absorption. The integration of 
glucose and Ca(2+) absorption represents a complex nutrient-sensing system, 
which allows both absorptive pathways to be regulated rapidly and precisely to 
match dietary intake.
