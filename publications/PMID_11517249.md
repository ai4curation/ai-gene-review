Using a yeast two-hybrid method, we searched for amyloid precursor protein 
(APP)-interacting molecules by screening mouse and human brain libraries. In 
addition to known interacting proteins containing a 
phosphotyrosine-interaction-domain (PID)-Fe65, Fe65L, Fe65L2, X11, and mDab1, we 
identified, as a novel APP-interacting molecule, a PID-containing isoform of 
mouse JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1b) and its human homolog IB1, the 
established scaffold proteins for JNK. The APP amino acids Tyr(682), Asn(684), 
and Tyr(687) in the G(681)YENPTY(687) region were all essential for APP/JIP-1b 
interaction, but neither Tyr(653) nor Thr(668) was necessary. APP-interacting 
ability was specific for this additional isoform containing PID and was shared 
by both human and mouse homologs. JIP-1b expressed by mammalian cells was 
efficiently precipitated by the cytoplasmic domain of APP in the extreme 
Gly(681)-Asn(695) domain-dependent manner. Reciprocally, both full-length 
wild-type and familial Alzheimer's disease mutant APPs were precipitated by 
PID-containing JIP constructs. Antibodies raised against the N and C termini of 
JIP-1b coprecipitated JIP-1b and wild-type or mutant APP in non-neuronal and 
neuronal cells. Moreover, human JNK1beta1 formed a complex with APP in a 
JIP-1b-dependent manner. Confocal microscopic examination demonstrated that APP 
and JIP-1b share similar subcellular localization in transfected cells. These 
data indicate that JIP-1b/IB1 scaffolds APP with JNK, providing a novel insight 
into the role of the JNK scaffold protein as an interface of APP with 
intracellular functional molecules.
