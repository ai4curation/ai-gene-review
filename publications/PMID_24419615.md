The Ets1 transcription factor is a member of the Ets protein family, a group of 
evolutionarily related DNA-binding transcriptional factors. Ets proteins 
activate or repress the expression of genes that are involved in various 
biological processes, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, 
development, transformation and apoptosis. FOXO1 is a member of the forkhead-box 
proteins (FOX proteins), which comprise a large family of functionally diverse 
transcription factors involved in cellular proliferation, transformation and 
differentiation. The FOXO subgroup of FOX proteins regulates the transcription 
of genes that control metabolism, cell survival, cellular proliferation, DNA 
damage responses, stress resistance and longevity. The DNA-binding domains 
(DBDs) of Ets1 and FOXO1 were crystallized in complex with DNA containing a 
composite sequence for a noncanonical forkhead binding site (AATAACA) and an ETS 
site (GGAA), FOX:ETS, by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. The FOX:ETS 
motif has been shown to be a conserved cis-acting element in several endothelial 
cell-specific genes, including Vegfr2, Tie2, Mef2c and ve-cadherin. Crystals 
were grown at 291 K using 30% polyethylene glycol 400, 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 100 mM 
KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 as the reservoir solution. The crystals belonged to space group 
C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 68.7, b = 104.9, c = 136.3 Å. Diffraction 
data were collected to a resolution of 2.2 Å.
