The GATOR2-GATOR1 signaling axis is essential for amino-acid-dependent mTORC1 
activation. However, the molecular function of the GATOR2 complex remains 
unknown. Here, we report that disruption of the Ring domains of Mios, WDR24, or 
WDR59 completely impedes amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation. Mechanistically, 
via interacting with Ring domains of WDR59 and WDR24, the Ring domain of Mios 
acts as a hub to maintain GATOR2 integrity, disruption of which leads to 
self-ubiquitination of WDR24. Physiologically, leucine stimulation dissociates 
Sestrin2 from the Ring domain of WDR24 and confers its availability to UBE2D3 
and subsequent ubiquitination of NPRL2, contributing to GATOR2-mediated GATOR1 
inactivation. As such, WDR24 ablation or Ring deletion prevents mTORC1 
activation, leading to severe growth defects and embryonic lethality at E10.5 in 
mice. Hence, our findings demonstrate that Ring domains are essential for GATOR2 
to transmit amino acid availability to mTORC1 and further reveal the 
essentiality of nutrient sensing during embryonic development.
