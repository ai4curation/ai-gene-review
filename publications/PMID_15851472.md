Manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) in the mitochondria plays a 
key role in protection against oxidative stress. Here we probed the pathway by 
which SOD2 acquires its manganese catalytic cofactor. We found that a 
mitochondrial localization is essential. A cytosolic version of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae Sod2p is largely apo for manganese and is only efficiently activated 
when cells accumulate toxic levels of manganese. Furthermore, Candida albicans 
naturally produces a cytosolic manganese SOD (Ca SOD3), yet when expressed in 
the cytosol of S. cerevisiae, a large fraction of Ca SOD3 also remained 
manganese-deficient. The cytosol of S. cerevisae cannot readily support 
activation of Mn-SOD molecules. By monitoring the kinetics for metalation of S. 
cerevisiae Sod2p in vivo, we found that prefolded Sod2p in the mitochondria 
cannot be activated by manganese. Manganese insertion is only possible with a 
newly synthesized polypeptide. Furthermore, Sod2p synthesis appears closely 
coupled to Sod2p import. By reversibly blocking mitochondrial import in vivo, we 
noted that newly synthesized Sod2p can enter mitochondria but not a Sod2p 
polypeptide that was allowed to accumulate in the cytosol. We propose a model in 
which the insertion of manganese into eukaryotic SOD2 molecules is driven by the 
protein unfolding process associated with mitochondrial import.
