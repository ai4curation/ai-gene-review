BACKGROUND: Prostate specific membrane antigen or PSMA has been recognized as 
one of the important cellular markers for prostate cancer, the expression of 
which is enhanced many fold in prostate cancer and other tumor neovasculature. 
PSMA is a type II membrane glycoprotein with a short cytoplasmic N-terminal 
region, a transmembrane domain, and a 701 amino acid extracellular portion with 
10 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. PSMA is a folate hydrolase, which 
cleaves terminal glutamates from poly- and gamma-glutamated folates; and 
NAALADase, which hydrolyses alpha-glutamate-linked dipeptide, 
N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) and is a glutamate carboxypeptidase.
METHODS: In our study we have used various enzymes or site directed mutagenesis 
to remove sugar molecules from PSMA protein and studied its folate hydrolase 
function. We have performed a biochemical characterization of N-linked 
glycosylation of the various mutant proteins.
RESULTS: PSMA protein expressed in different prostate cancer cell lines is 
differentially glycosylated. Removal of sugar residues either enzymatically or 
by mutagenesis abolishes the enzyme activity of PSMA protein completely.
CONCLUSION: N-linked carbohydrate structures are important for the folate 
hydrolase function of the protein. Removal of sugars partially or completely 
causes PSMA to be enzymatically inactive, improperly folded, resulting in 
increased rate of degradation.
