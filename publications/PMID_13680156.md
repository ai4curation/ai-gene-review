Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATS1 (alpha-tubulin suppressor 1) was originally 
identified as a high-copy suppressor of class two alpha-tubulin mutations and 
was proposed to have a regulatory role in coordinating the microtubule state 
with the cell cycle. Here, we show that Ats1p interacts with Nap1p, a 
cytoplasmic protein that regulates the activity of the Cdc28p/Clb2p complex. 
Loss of Nap1p results in a delayed switch from polar to isotropic bud growth. 
The delayed switch results in elongated buds. Nap1p and Ats1p interact in 
two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Both nap1Delta and ats1Delta cells 
have a Clb2p-dependent elongated bud morphology. Deletion of ATS1 partially 
suppresses the elongated bud morphology and benomyl resistance of nap1Delta 
mutants. Our results suggest Ats1p might regulate coordination of the 
microtubule state with the cell cycle through an interaction with Nap1p.
