The chaperone cycle of heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) involves progression 
through defined complexes with different cochaperones. It is still enigmatic how 
the exchange of cochaperones is regulated. The first cochaperone entering the 
cycle is the Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor Sti1 (Hop in human), which later is replaced 
by a prolyl isomerase (PPIase) and p23. We found, unexpectedly, that one Sti1 
molecule is sufficient to completely inhibit the ATPase of the Hsp90 dimer. Upon 
addition of a PPIase cochaperone to the Hsp90-Sti1 complex, an asymmetric 
ternary complex is preferentially formed. This PPIase-Hsp90-Sti1 intermediate is 
important for the progression of the cycle. To expel the bound Sti1, the 
concerted action of ATP and p23 is required. This mechanism, which is strictly 
conserved between the yeast and human Hsp90 systems, presents an example of how, 
in a cyclic process, directionality of assembly and disassembly of protein 
complexes can be achieved.
