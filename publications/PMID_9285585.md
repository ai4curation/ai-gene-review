Chaperonins assist protein folding with the consumption of ATP. They exist as 
multi-subunit protein assemblies comprising rings of subunits stacked back to 
back. In Escherichia coli, asymmetric intermediates of GroEL are formed with the 
co-chaperonin GroES and nucleotides bound only to one of the seven-subunit rings 
(the cis ring) and not to the opposing ring (the trans ring). The structure of 
the GroEL-GroES-(ADP)7 complex reveals how large en bloc movements of the cis 
ring's intermediate and apical domains enable bound GroES to stabilize a folding 
chamber with ADP confined to the cis ring. Elevation and twist of the apical 
domains double the volume of the central cavity and bury hydrophobic 
peptide-binding residues in the interface with GroES, as well as between GroEL 
subunits, leaving a hydrophilic cavity lining that is conducive to protein 
folding. An inward tilt of the cis equatorial domain causes an outward tilt in 
the trans ring that opposes the binding of a second GroES. When combined with 
new functional results, this negative allosteric mechanism suggests a model for 
an ATP-driven folding cycle that requires a double toroid.
