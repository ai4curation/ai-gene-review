Asf1 is a conserved histone chaperone implicated in nucleosome assembly, 
transcriptional silencing, and the cellular response to DNA damage. We solved 
the NMR solution structure of the N-terminal functional domain of the human 
Asf1a isoform, and we identified by NMR chemical shift mapping a surface of 
Asf1a that binds the C-terminal helix of histone H3. This binding surface forms 
a highly conserved hydrophobic groove surrounded by charged residues. Mutations 
within this binding site decreased the affinity of Asf1a for the histone H3/H4 
complex in vitro, and the same mutations in the homologous yeast protein led to 
transcriptional silencing defects, DNA damage sensitivity, and thermosensitive 
growth. We have thus obtained direct experimental evidence of the mode of 
binding between a histone and one of its chaperones and genetic data suggesting 
that this interaction is important in both the DNA damage response and 
transcriptional silencing.
