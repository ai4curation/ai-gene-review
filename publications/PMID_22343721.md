The conserved TREX-2 transcription-export complex integrates transcription and 
processing of many actively transcribed nascent mRNAs with the recruitment of 
export factors at nuclear pores and also contributes to transcriptional memory 
and genomic stability. We report the crystal structure of the Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 
segment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TREX-2 that interfaces with the gene 
expression machinery. Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 forms a previously uncharacterized 
PCI-domain complex characterized by the juxtaposition of Sac3 and Thp1 winged 
helix domains, forming a platform that mediates nucleic acid binding. Our 
structure-guided mutations support the idea that the Thp1-Sac3 interaction is an 
essential requirement for mRNA binding and for the coupling of transcription and 
processing to mRNP assembly and export. These results provide insight into how 
newly synthesized transcripts are efficiently transferred from TREX-2 to the 
principal mRNA export factor, and they reveal how Sem1 stabilizes PCI 
domain-containing proteins and promotes complex assembly.
