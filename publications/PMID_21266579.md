The double-stranded RNA analog, poly(I:C), extracellularly activates both the 
endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and the cytoplasmic RNA helicase, melanoma 
differentiation-associated gene 5, leading to the production of type I 
interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism by which 
extracellular poly(I:C) is delivered to TLR3-positive organelles and the 
cytoplasm remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that the cytoplasmic lipid 
raft protein, Raftlin, is essential for poly(I:C) cellular uptake in human 
myeloid dendritic cells and epithelial cells. When Raftlin was silenced, 
poly(I:C) failed to enter cells and induction of IFN-β production was inhibited. 
In addition, cellular uptake of B-type oligodeoxynucleotide that shares its 
uptake receptor with poly(I:C) was suppressed in Raftlin knockdown cells. Upon 
poly(I:C) stimulation, Raftlin was translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma 
membrane where it colocalized with poly(I:C), and thereafter moved to 
TLR3-positive endosomes. Thus, Raftlin cooperates with the uptake receptor to 
mediate cell entry of poly(I:C), which is critical for activation of TLR3.

Abstract

The double-stranded RNA analog, poly(I:C), extracellularly activates both the endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and the cytoplasmic RNA helicase, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, leading to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism by which extracellular poly(I:C) is delivered to TLR3-positive organelles and the cytoplasm remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that the cytoplasmic lipid raft protein, Raftlin, is essential for poly(I:C) cellular uptake in human myeloid dendritic cells and epithelial cells. When Raftlin was silenced, poly(I:C) failed to enter cells and induction of IFN-β production was inhibited. In addition, cellular uptake of B-type oligodeoxynucleotide that shares its uptake receptor with poly(I:C) was suppressed in Raftlin knockdown cells. Upon poly(I:C) stimulation, Raftlin was translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where it colocalized with poly(I:C), and thereafter moved to TLR3-positive endosomes. Thus, Raftlin cooperates with the uptake receptor to mediate cell entry of poly(I:C), which is critical for activation of TLR3.

Introduction

Polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), 2 a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), has been used as a potent type I interferon (IFN-α/β) inducer in both in vitro and in vivo studies since the discovery of anti-viral activity of type I IFNs ( 1 – 3 ). Many types of cells including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), produce IFN-β upon stimulation with poly(I:C). Studies have demonstrated that extracellular poly(I:C) is recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and cytoplasmic RNA helicase, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and induces innate immune responses including the production of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines ( 4 – 8 ). More recently, experimental evidence has accumulated that poly(I:C) acts as an adjuvant that enhances antibody production, natural killer cell activation, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte induction through the activation of TLR3 and/or MDA5 ( 9 – 15 ).

Human TLR3 localizes to the endosomal compartments in myeloid DCs, whereas it localizes to both the cell surface and endosomes of fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial cells ( 5 , 16 , 17 ). TLR3 signaling arises from an intracellular compartment in both cell types and requires endosomal maturation. After dsRNA recognition, endosomal TLR3 recruits an adaptor molecule, i.e. Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor molecule-1 (TICAM-1, also called TRIF) that activates the NF-κB, IRF-3, and AP-1 transcription factors, leading to IFN-β production ( 18 , 19 ). Also, extracellular poly(I:C) is sensed by MDA5 in the cytoplasm, resulting in the activation of IRF-3 and NF-κB via the mitochondrial outer membrane protein IPS-1 (also called MAVS, Cardif, or VISA) ( 20 – 23 ). However, the mechanism by which poly(I:C) is delivered from the extracellular fluid to the intracellular dsRNA sensors remains unresolved.

A recent study showed that CD14 directly binds to poly(I:C) and mediates poly(I:C) cellular uptake ( 24 ). Bone marrow-derived macrophages from CD14-deficient mice exhibited impaired, but not completely diminished, responses to poly(I:C). Also, a class A scavenger receptor was identified as a cell surface receptor for poly(I:C) in human epithelial cells, although the response of poly(I:C) was only partially impaired in scavenger receptor A-deficient mice ( 25 ). These results suggest that an unidentified cell surface molecule mediates cell entry of poly(I:C). Indeed, we and others demonstrated that poly(I:C) is internalized into CD14-negative human myeloid DCs and HEK293 cells via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and B- and C-type oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) share the uptake receptor with poly(I:C) ( 26 – 28 ).

In this study, we isolated poly(I:C)-binding proteins from CD14-negative cell lysates by sequential affinity chromatography with poly(U)- and poly(I:C)-Sepharose and subjected them to mass spectrometric analysis. Among the proteins identified, we selected several proteins that exhibited a transmembrane domain or a membrane-anchoring motif and examined whether they were involved in poly(I:C)-induced TLR3-mediated signaling. We found that Raftlin, a major lipid raft protein expressed by B cells, plays a critical role in poly(I:C) cellular uptake in human myeloid DCs and epithelial cells.

DISCUSSION

Recent studies using mouse implanted tumor models indicate that poly(I:C) is a promising adjuvant for tumor vaccines because it promotes adaptive anti-tumor responses through the activation of myeloid DCs and induction of type I IFN production by multiple type of cells ( 10 – 15 ). However, it remains unresolved how poly(I:C) is delivered from the extracellular fluid to the intracellular poly(I:C) sensors localized on the endosomal membrane or cytoplasm.

In this study, we demonstrated that Raftlin is essential for poly(I:C)-induced cellular responses in human myeloid DCs and epithelial cells by mediating the cellular uptake of poly(I:C). Raftlin was originally identified as a major raft protein in B cells that co-localized with B cell receptor in the lipid raft before and after B cell receptor stimulation ( 29 ). However, subcellular localization of endogenous Raftlin appears to depend on the cell types. We found that in unstimulated HeLa cells, endogenous Raftlin localized diffusely in the cytoplasm and did not co-localize with CTXB ( Fig. 4 ), whereas in MoDCs it localized to both the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm and membrane-associated Raftlin partially merged with CTXB ( Fig. 6 E ). In these cells, poly(I:C) stimulation induced the translocation of Raftlin from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where it cooperated with uptake receptor to deliver poly(I:C) to TLR3-positive endosomes ( Figs. 4 and 6 F ). Thus, Raftlin is involved in the nucleocapture complex triggering poly(I:C)-mediated TLR3 activation, and appears to act downstream of immune receptors in a cell type-specific manner.

Notably, Raftlin −/− BMDCs that express Raftlin-2 normally took up poly(I:C) ( Fig. 7 C ). The expression of Raftlin or Raftlin-2 depends on the cell type. Mouse Raftlin-2 is expressed in B cells but not T cells and is thought to function in a similar way to Raftlin in mouse B cells ( 33 ). Because poly(I:C)-induced IFN-β mRNA expression and internalization of poly(I:C) were decreased when mouse Raftlin-2 was knocked down in Raftlin −/− BMDCs ( Fig. 7 , D and E ), mouse Raftlin-2 participates in poly(I:C) uptake in Raftlin −/− BMDCs. In humans, MoDCs, HEK293 cells, and HeLa cells did not express Raftlin-2 mRNA. Hence, human Raftlin plays a key role in poly(I:C)-induced cellular responses in the absence of Raftlin-2.

The molecular mechanism by which Raftlin cooperates with the uptake receptor to mediate cell entry of poly(I:C) and B- and C-type ODNs is currently unknown. As shown in Fig. 3 A , clustering of the uptake receptor occurs without internalization in the absence of Raftlin. Because disruption of the lipid raft by treatment with MβCD did not affect internalization of poly(I:C) ( supplemental Fig. S4 ), Raftlin may participate in the assembly of the uptake machinery for poly(I:C) and B- and C-type ODNs independently of lipid raft function. We have previously demonstrated that poly(I:C) is internalized via the clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( 27 ). Indeed, Raftlin associated with clathrin after poly(I:C) stimulation ( Fig. 5 ). Thus, Raftlin might be involved in the clathrin and clathrin-associated adapter protein complexes at the plasma membrane and participates in cargo sorting and delivery to the TLR3-positive endosome ( 34 ).

Intriguingly, A-type ODN that activates plasmacytoid DCs to induce IFN-α was unable to bind to myeloid DCs ( 27 ). A-type ODN binds to high mobility group box 1 and augments the binding of high mobility group box 1 to receptor for advanced glycation end products ( 35 ). A-type ODN-high mobility group box 1 complex enhances TLR9-mediated IFN-α production by plasmacytoid DCs in a receptor for advanced glycation end product-dependent manner, although receptor for advanced glycation end products is not essential for internalization of A-type ODN or A-type ODN-high mobility group box 1 complexes. An unidentified uptake receptor for A-type ODN must reside on plasmacytoid DCs. Although whether Raftlin participates in the uptake of A-type ODN in human plasmacytoid DCs remains to be examined, we surmise that exogenous nucleic acids are recognized by cell surface receptors that form distinct nucleocapture complexes to deliver nucleic acids to intracellular organelles.

The adjuvant activity of poly(I:C) is derived from the activation of two innate immune sensors, TLR3 and MDA5, in myeloid DCs. No RNA molecule has been reported besides poly(I:C) that extracellulary activates either TLR3 or MDA5. Identification of the uptake receptor for poly(I:C) in DCs is important to elucidate the mechanism by which poly(I:C) is localized to TLR3 and MDA5, as well as to develop a poly(I:C)-related adjuvant that is selectively transferred to TLR3 and/or MDA5.
