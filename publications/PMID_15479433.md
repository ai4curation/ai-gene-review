CD163 is a monocyte/macrophage-specific scavenger receptor that undergoes 
ectodomain shedding upon an inflammatory stimulus. Soluble CD163 (sCD163) 
actively inhibits lymphocyte proliferation, but to date exactly how it interacts 
with these cells has remained elusive. We screened T lymphocytes and endothelial 
cells for proteins binding to sCD163. In both cell types a high affinity binding 
protein was detected. Partial sequencing of the protein revealed sequence 
identity to a non-muscle myosin heavy chain type A. Employing labelled sCD163 we 
found little specific binding of sCD163 to the extracellular domains of T 
lymphocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In activated T 
lymphocytes we demonstrated specific binding of sCD163 to intracellular 
structures as well as the presence of the native protein within the cell after 
co-incubation with purified sCD163. Furthermore, we developed a novel ELISA for 
highly specific detection of sCD163-myosin complexes. These complexes were 
present in activated T lymphocytes after incubation with shed sCD163. 
Co-localization of sCD163 and cellular myosin in T lymphocytes was further 
confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Our results suggest that sCD163 associates 
with cellular myosin, thereby possibly modulating the cells' response to an 
inflammatory stimulus.
