Promoter-proximal pausing by initiated RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and regulated 
release of paused polymerase into productive elongation has emerged as a major 
mechanism of transcription activation. Reactivation of paused Pol II correlates 
with recruitment of super-elongation complexes (SECs) containing ELL/EAF family 
members, P-TEFb, and other proteins, but the mechanism of their recruitment is 
an unanswered question. Here, we present evidence for a role of human Mediator 
subunit MED26 in this process. We identify in the conserved N-terminal domain of 
MED26 overlapping docking sites for SEC and a second ELL/EAF-containing complex, 
as well as general initiation factor TFIID. In addition, we present evidence 
consistent with the model that MED26 can function as a molecular switch that 
interacts first with TFIID in the Pol II initiation complex and then exchanges 
TFIID for complexes containing ELL/EAF and P-TEFb to facilitate transition of 
Pol II into the elongation stage of transcription.
