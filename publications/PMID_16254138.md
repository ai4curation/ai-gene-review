Allergic, inflammatory, and immune responses carried out by eosinophils are 
regulated by the cross talk between activatory and inhibitory signals. While 
much data has been obtained on activatory signals, inhibitory receptors on these 
cells have received scant attention. Therefore, we screened the surface of human 
peripheral blood eosinophils for inhibitory receptors using monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) previously generated to recognize receptors on human natural 
killer cells. Eosinophils from all of the donors examined expressed the 
inhibitory receptors IRp60, LIR3/ILT5, FcgammaRIIB, and p75/AIRM but not 
LIR1/ILT2, p58.1, p58.2, p70, or NKG2A/CD94 (n = 15). Interestingly, 25% of the 
donors expressed p140. IRp60 cross-linking inhibited eotaxin-dependent 
transmigration of eosinophils in a calcium-independent fashion. In addition, 
cross-linking of IRp60 on the eosinophils in the presence of IL-5/GM-CSF 
inhibited the antiapoptotic effect of these cytokines and blocked the release of 
TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and 3T3 fibroblast proliferation. 
Cross-linking of IRp60 inhibited IL-5-mediated JAK2 phosphorylation as well as 
eotaxin- and IL-5/GM-CSF-mediated ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, 
upon cross-linking, IRp60 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation and recruited SHP-1 
but not SHP-2. These findings demonstrate a novel pathway for suppressing the 
activity of human eosinophils, thus indicating IRp60 as a future potential 
target for the treatment of allergic and eosinophil-associated diseases.
