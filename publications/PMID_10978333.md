Members of the Ikaros family of transcription factors, Ikaros, Aiolos, and 
Helios, are expressed in lymphocytes and have been implicated in controlling 
lymphoid development. These proteins contain two characteristic clusters of zinc 
fingers, an N-terminal domain important for DNA recognition, and a C-terminal 
domain that mediates homo- and heterotypic associations between family members. 
The conservation of these domains is such that all three proteins recognize 
related DNA sequences, and all are capable of dimerizing with other family 
members. Here we describe two additional Ikaros family proteins, Eos and 
Pegasus. Eos is most highly related to Helios and shares its DNA binding and 
protein association properties. Pegasus is related to other Ikaros proteins in 
its C-terminal dimerization domain but contains a divergent N-terminal zinc 
finger domain. Pegasus self-associates and binds to other family members but 
recognizes distinct DNA-binding sites. Eos and Pegasus repress the expression of 
reporter genes containing their recognition elements. Our results suggest that 
these proteins may associate with previously described Ikaros family proteins in 
lymphoid cells and play additional roles in other tissues.
