The National Institutes of Health's Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) project was 
designed to generate and sequence a publicly accessible cDNA resource containing 
a complete open reading frame (ORF) for every human and mouse gene. The project 
initially used a random strategy to select clones from a large number of cDNA 
libraries from diverse tissues. Candidate clones were chosen based on 5'-EST 
sequences, and then fully sequenced to high accuracy and analyzed by algorithms 
developed for this project. Currently, more than 11,000 human and 10,000 mouse 
genes are represented in MGC by at least one clone with a full ORF. The random 
selection approach is now reaching a saturation point, and a transition to 
protocols targeted at the missing transcripts is now required to complete the 
mouse and human collections. Comparison of the sequence of the MGC clones to 
reference genome sequences reveals that most cDNA clones are of very high 
sequence quality, although it is likely that some cDNAs may carry missense 
variants as a consequence of experimental artifact, such as PCR, cloning, or 
reverse transcriptase errors. Recently, a rat cDNA component was added to the 
project, and ongoing frog (Xenopus) and zebrafish (Danio) cDNA projects were 
expanded to take advantage of the high-throughput MGC pipeline.

Abstract

The National Institutes of Health's Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) project was designed to generate and sequence a publicly accessible cDNA resource containing a complete open reading frame (ORF) for every human and mouse gene. The project initially used a random strategy to select clones from a large number of cDNA libraries from diverse tissues. Candidate clones were chosen based on 5â€²-EST sequences, and then fully sequenced to high accuracy and analyzed by algorithms developed for this project. Currently, more than 11,000 human and 10,000 mouse genes are represented in MGC by at least one clone with a full ORF. The random selection approach is now reaching a saturation point, and a transition to protocols targeted at the missing transcripts is now required to complete the mouse and human collections. Comparison of the sequence of the MGC clones to reference genome sequences reveals that most cDNA clones are of very high sequence quality, although it is likely that some cDNAs may carry missense variants as a consequence of experimental artifact, such as PCR, cloning, or reverse transcriptase errors. Recently, a rat cDNA component was added to the project, and ongoing frog ( Xenopus ) and zebrafish ( Danio ) cDNA projects were expanded to take advantage of the high-throughput MGC pipeline.
