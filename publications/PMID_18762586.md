CONTEXT: A role for the centrosome has been suggested in the pathology of major 
mental illnesses, especially schizophrenia (SZ).
OBJECTIVES: To show that pericentriolar material 1 protein (PCM1) forms a 
complex at the centrosome with disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and 
Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4 protein (BBS4), which provides a crucial pathway for 
cortical development associated with the pathology of SZ. To identify mutations 
in the PCM1 gene in an SZ population.
DESIGN: Interaction of DISC1, PCM1, and BBS proteins was assessed by 
immunofluorescent staining and coimmunoprecipitation. Effects of PCM1, DISC1, 
and BBS on centrosomal functions and corticogenesis in vivo were tested by RNA 
interference. The PCM1 gene was examined by sequencing 39 exons and flanking 
splice sites.
SETTING: Probands and controls were from the collection of one of us (A.E.P.).
PATIENTS: Thirty-two probands with SZ from families that had excess allele 
sharing among affected individuals at 8p22 and 219 white controls.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Protein interaction and recruitment at the centrosome in 
cells; neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex; and variant discovery in PCM1 
in patients with SZ.
RESULTS: PCM1 forms a complex with DISC1 and BBS4 through discrete binding 
domains in each protein. DISC1 and BBS4 are required for targeting PCM1 and 
other cargo proteins, such as ninein, to the centrosome in a synergistic manner. 
In the developing cerebral cortex, suppression of PCM1 leads to neuronal 
migration defects, which are phenocopied by the suppression of either DISC1 or 
BBS4 and are exacerbated by the concomitant suppression of both. Furthermore, a 
nonsense mutation that segregates with SZ spectrum psychosis was found in 1 
family.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data further support for the role of centrosomal proteins in 
cortical development and suggest that perturbation of centrosomal function 
contributes to the development of mental diseases, including SZ.
