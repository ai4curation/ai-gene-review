The NF1 tumor suppressor gene encodes a guanosine triphosphotase 
(GTPase)-activating protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling and is 
inactivated in a subset of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemias (JMMLs). Adoptive 
transfer of fetal liver cells from Nf1 mutant mice models JMML; however, this 
system has important limitations as a platform for performing biologic and 
preclinical studies. We have exploited the interferon-inducible Mx1-Cre 
transgene to ablate a conditional mutant Nf1 allele in hematopoietic cells. 
Somatic inactivation of Nf1 induces a myeloproliferative disorder with 100% 
penetrance that is associated with a sub-acute clinical course, tissue 
infiltration by myeloid cells, hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony 
stimulating factor, hyperproliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. These 
Mx1-Cre, Nf1(flox/flox) mice establish a tractable experimental model for 
testing therapeutics and for identifying mutations that cooperate with 
hyperactive Ras in myeloid leukemogenesis.
