Whether mechanically unfolded fibronectin (Fn) is present within native 
extracellular matrix fibrils is controversial. Fn extensibility under the 
influence of cell traction forces has been proposed to originate either from the 
force-induced lengthening of an initially compact, folded quaternary structure 
as is found in solution (quaternary structure model, where the dimeric arms of 
Fn cross each other), or from the force-induced unfolding of type III modules 
(unfolding model). Clarification of this issue is central to our understanding 
of the structural arrangement of Fn within fibrils, the mechanism of 
fibrillogenesis, and whether cryptic sites, which are exposed by partial protein 
unfolding, can be exposed by cell-derived force. In order to differentiate 
between these two models, two fluorescence resonance energy transfer schemes to 
label plasma Fn were applied, with sensitivity to either compact-to-extended 
conformation (arm separation) without loss of secondary structure or 
compact-to-unfolded conformation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies 
revealed that a significant fraction of fibrillar Fn within a three-dimensional 
human fibroblast matrix is partially unfolded. Complete relaxation of Fn fibrils 
led to a refolding of Fn. The compactly folded quaternary structure with crossed 
Fn arms, however, was never detected within extracellular matrix fibrils. We 
conclude that the resting state of Fn fibrils does not contain Fn molecules with 
crossed-over arms, and that the several-fold extensibility of Fn fibrils 
involves the unfolding of type III modules. This could imply that Fn might play 
a significant role in mechanotransduction processes.
