Human ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) acts as a DNA repair endonuclease. The 
multiple functions of this protein are regulated by post-translational 
modifications including phosphorylation and methylation. Using a yeast-two 
hybrid screen, we identified small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1) as a 
new interacting partner of rpS3. rpS3 interacted with SUMO-1 via the N- and 
C-terminal regions. We also observed sumoylation of rpS3 in Escherichia coli and 
mammalian cell systems. Furthermore, we discovered that one of three lysine 
residues, Lys18, Lys214, or Lys230, was sumoylated in rpS3. Interestingly, 
sumoylated rpS3 was resistant to proteolytic activity, indicating that SUMO-1 
increased the stability of the rpS3 protein. We concluded that rpS3 is 
covalently modified by SUMO-1 and this post-translational modification regulates 
rpS3 function by increasing rpS3 protein stability.
