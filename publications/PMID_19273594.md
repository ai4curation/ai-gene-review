The transcription factor SKN-1 protects Caenorhabditis elegans from stress and 
promotes longevity. SKN-1 is regulated by diverse signals that control 
metabolism, development, and stress responses, but the mechanisms of regulation 
and signal integration are unknown. We screened the C. elegans genome for 
regulators of cytoprotective gene expression and identified a new SKN-1 
regulatory pathway. SKN-1 protein levels, nuclear accumulation, and activity are 
repressed by the WD40 repeat protein WDR-23, which interacts with the 
CUL-4/DDB-1 ubiquitin ligase to presumably target the transcription factor for 
proteasomal degradation. WDR-23 regulates SKN-1 target genes downstream from p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, and insulin-like 
receptor pathways, suggesting that phosphorylation of SKN-1 may function to 
modify its interaction with WDR-23 and/or CUL-4/DDB-1. These findings define the 
mechanism of SKN-1 accumulation in the cell nucleus and provide a new 
mechanistic framework for understanding how phosphorylation signals are 
integrated to regulate stress resistance and longevity.
