Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are age-dependent stem cell malignancies that 
share biological features of activated adaptive immune response and ineffective 
hematopoiesis. Here we report that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), 
which are classically linked to immunosuppression, inflammation, and cancer, 
were markedly expanded in the bone marrow of MDS patients and played a 
pathogenetic role in the development of ineffective hematopoiesis. These 
clonally distinct MDSC overproduce hematopoietic suppressive cytokines and 
function as potent apoptotic effectors targeting autologous hematopoietic 
progenitors. Using multiple transfected cell models, we found that MDSC 
expansion is driven by the interaction of the proinflammatory molecule S100A9 
with CD33. These 2 proteins formed a functional ligand/receptor pair that 
recruited components to CD33’s immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif 
(ITIM), inducing secretion of the suppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β by 
immature myeloid cells. S100A9 transgenic mice displayed bone marrow 
accumulation of MDSC accompanied by development of progressive multilineage 
cytopenias and cytological dysplasia. Importantly, early forced maturation of 
MDSC by either all-trans-retinoic acid treatment or active immunoreceptor 
tyrosine-based activation motif–bearing (ITAM-bearing) adapter protein (DAP12) 
interruption of CD33 signaling rescued the hematologic phenotype. These findings 
indicate that primary bone marrow expansion of MDSC driven by the S100A9/CD33 
pathway perturbs hematopoiesis and contributes to the development of MDS.
