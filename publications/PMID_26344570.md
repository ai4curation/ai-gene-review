Chaperones increase the folding yields of soluble proteins by suppressing 
misfolding and aggregation, but how they modulate the folding of integral 
membrane proteins is not well understood. Here we use single-molecule force 
spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy to observe the periplasmic holdase chaperones 
SurA and Skp shaping the folding trajectory of the large β-barrel outer-membrane 
receptor FhuA from Escherichia coli. Either chaperone prevents FhuA from 
misfolding by stabilizing a dynamic, unfolded state, thus allowing the substrate 
to search for structural intermediates. During this search, the SurA-chaperoned 
FhuA polypeptide inserts β-hairpins into the membrane in a stepwise manner until 
the β-barrel is folded. The membrane acts as a free-energy sink for β-hairpin 
insertion and physically separates transient folds from chaperones. This 
stabilization of dynamic unfolded states and the trapping of folding 
intermediates funnel the FhuA polypeptide toward the native conformation.
