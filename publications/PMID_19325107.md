Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum is a complex process whose 
malfunction is implicated in disease and aging. By using the cell's endogenous 
sensor (the unfolded protein response), we identified several hundred yeast 
genes with roles in endoplasmic reticulum folding and systematically 
characterized their functional interdependencies by measuring unfolded protein 
response levels in double mutants. This strategy revealed multiple conserved 
factors critical for endoplasmic reticulum folding, including an intimate 
dependence on the later secretory pathway, a previously uncharacterized 
six-protein transmembrane complex, and a co-chaperone complex that delivers 
tail-anchored proteins to their membrane insertion machinery. The use of a 
quantitative reporter in a comprehensive screen followed by systematic analysis 
of genetic dependencies should be broadly applicable to functional dissection of 
complex cellular processes from yeast to human.
