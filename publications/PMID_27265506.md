Activating mutations in Gαq proteins, which form the α subunit of certain 
heterotrimeric G proteins, drive uveal melanoma oncogenesis by triggering 
multiple downstream signaling pathways, including PLC/PKC, Rho/Rac, and YAP. 
Here we show that the small GTPase ARF6 acts as a proximal node of oncogenic Gαq 
signaling to induce all of these downstream pathways as well as β-catenin 
signaling. ARF6 activates these diverse pathways through a common mechanism: the 
trafficking of GNAQ and β-catenin from the plasma membrane to cytoplasmic 
vesicles and the nucleus, respectively. Blocking ARF6 with a small-molecule 
inhibitor reduces uveal melanoma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in a mouse 
model, confirming the functional relevance of this pathway and suggesting a 
therapeutic strategy for Gα-mediated diseases.
