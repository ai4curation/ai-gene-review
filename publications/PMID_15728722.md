Neurite outgrowth is an important process in the formation of neuronal networks. 
Rac1 and Cdc42, members of the Rho-family GTPases, positively regulate neurite 
extension through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we examine the 
dynamic linkage between Rac1/Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3-kinase) during nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 
cells. Activity imaging using fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes 
showed that PI3-kinase as well as Rac1/Cdc42 was transiently activated in broad 
areas of the cell periphery immediately after NGF addition. Subsequently, local 
and repetitive activation of PI3-kinase and Rac1/Cdc42 was observed at the 
protruding sites. Depletion of Vav2 and Vav3 by RNA interference significantly 
inhibited both Rac1/Cdc42 activation and the formation of short processes 
leading to neurite outgrowth. At the NGF-induced protrusions, local 
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation recruited Vav2 and Vav3 to 
activate Rac1 and Cdc42, and conversely, Vav2 and Vav3 were required for the 
local activation of PI3-kinase. These observations demonstrated for the first 
time that Vav2 and Vav3 are essential constituents of the positive feedback loop 
that is comprised of PI3-kinase and Rac1/Cdc42 and cycles locally with 
morphological changes.
