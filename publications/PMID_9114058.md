We have determined the subcellular localization of the chromosome partition 
protein Spo0J of Bacillus subtilis by immunofluorescence microscopy and 
visualizing fluorescence of a Spo0J-GFP fusion protein. Spo0J was associated 
with a region of the nucleoid proximal to the cell pole, both in growing cells 
dividing symmetrically and in sporulating cells dividing asymmetrically. 
Additional experiments indicated that Spo0J was bound to sites in the 
origin-proximal third of the chromosome. These results show that the replicating 
chromosomes are oriented in a specific manner during the division cycle, with 
the Spo0J binding region positioned toward the cell poles. Experiments 
characterizing cells at different stages of the cell cycle showed that 
chromosome orientation is established prior to the initiation of cell division. 
Our results indicate that there is a mechanism for orienting the chromosomes and 
that the chromosome partition protein Spo0J might be part of a bacterial 
mitotic-like apparatus.
