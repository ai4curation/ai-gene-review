Comparative interactomics is a strategy for inferring potential interactions 
among orthologous proteins or "interologs". Herein we focus, in contrast to 
standard homology-based inference, on the divergence of protein interaction 
profiles among closely related organisms, showing that the approach can 
correlate specific traits to phenotypic differences. As a model, this new 
comparative interactomic approach was applied at a large scale to human 
papillomaviruses (HPVs) proteins. The oncogenic potential of HPVs is mainly 
determined by the E6 and E7 early proteins. We have mapped and overlapped the 
virus-host protein interaction networks of E6 and E7 proteins from 11 distinct 
HPV genotypes, selected for their different tropisms and pathologies. We 
generated robust and comprehensive datasets by combining two orthogonal protein 
interaction assays: yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), and our recently described 
"high-throughput Gaussia princeps protein complementation assay" (HT-GPCA). 
HT-GPCA detects protein interaction by measuring the interaction-mediated 
reconstitution of activity of a split G. princeps luciferase. Hierarchical 
clustering of interaction profiles recapitulated HPV phylogeny and was used to 
correlate specific virus-host interaction profiles with pathological traits, 
reflecting the distinct carcinogenic potentials of different HPVs. This 
comparative interactomics constitutes a reliable and powerful strategy to 
decipher molecular relationships in virtually any combination of 
microorganism-host interactions.
