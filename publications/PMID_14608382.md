T cells encounter two main checkpoints during development in the thymus. These 
checkpoints are critically dependent on signals derived from the thymic 
microenvironment as well as from the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) and the 
alphabeta TCR. Here we show that T cell-specific deletion of beta-catenin 
impaired T cell development at the beta-selection checkpoint, leading to a 
substantial decrease in splenic T cells. In addition, beta-catenin also seemed 
to be a target of TCR-CD3 signals in thymocytes and mature T cells. These data 
indicate that beta-catenin-mediated signals are required for normal T cell 
development.

Abstract

Cell adhesion proteins localize to epithelial and endothelial cell membranes to form junctional complexes between neighboring cells or between cells and the underlying basement membrane. The structural and functional integrities of these junctions are critical to establish cell polarity and maintain tissue barrier function, while also facilitating leukocyte migration and adhesion to sites of inflammation. In addition to their adhesive properties, however, junctional proteins can also serve important noncanonical functions in inflammatory signaling and transcriptional regulation. Intriguingly, recent work has unveiled novel roles for cell adhesion proteins as both signaling initiators and downstream targets during inflammation. In this review, we discuss both the traditional functions of junction proteins in cell adhesion and tissue barrier function as well as their noncanonical signaling roles that have been implicated in facilitating diverse inflammatory pathologies.

INTRODUCTION

Cell adhesion proteins play essential roles in generating and sustaining an impermeable barrier to promote epithelial tissue function. Adhesion proteins facilitate the establishment of a cohesive layer of interconnected cells by localizing along lateral cell surfaces to promote cell-cell interactions, as well as along basal surfaces to promote cell-basement membrane interactions ( Fig. 1, A and B ). Lateral junctions include tight junctions, adherens junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions ( Fig. 1 A ), whereas basal junctions include focal adhesions and hemidesmosomes ( 1 ) ( Fig. 1 B ). Canonically, these cell-cell and cell-basement membrane junctions are essential for cell polarity and promote diverse tissue functions that are critical for an organism’s health and survival, including secretion, absorption, diffusion, and pathogen exclusion ( 1 – 4 ).

Importantly, loss of adhesion proteins from the cell cortex causes junctional disruption, which can serve as a clinical hallmark of diverse pathological conditions, such as cancer and inflammatory bowel disease ( 5 ). The development and prognosis of junction-related diseases are largely associated with inflammatory responses mediated by the innate immune system. In many cancers, the initial oncogenic insult may drive inflammatory responses in premalignant cell populations, which upon becoming tumorigenic may further instigate inflammatory responses, causing a positive feedforward loop ( 6 ). Consequently, many ongoing studies in both basic biology and therapeutics seek to understand and leverage the aberrant immune landscape in disease states; this is evidenced by the implementation of immunotherapies such as pembrolizumab and tisagenlecleucel that have been shown to successfully target the tumor microenvironment ( 7 , 8 ).

Since the discovery of cell junctional complexes, numerous advances have been made in characterizing not only their critical roles in barrier function but also how their dysfunction can impact inflammatory disease phenotypes and, conversely, how inflammation may interfere with junctional integrity. Notably, adhesion proteins have emerging noncanonical functions in signaling, transcriptional regulation, and migration during inflammation. Furthermore, adhesion proteins can perform junction-independent functions in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and intracellular vesicles ( 9 , 10 ). Despite these advances, however, a mechanistic understanding of how these pathways and perturbations drive pathological conditions remains unclear. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge regarding signaling crosstalk between cell adhesion proteins and signal transduction pathways involved in tissue inflammation.

CONCLUSIONS

Adhesion proteins are essential components of the epithelial proteome that facilitate vital functions such as absorption, pathogen exclusion, and innate immunity. Tight junctions, adherens junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions, which perform essential cell-cell adhesive and communicatory functions on lateral cell membranes, establish and maintain a contiguous network of cells that form a polarized epithelium or endothelium ( Fig. 1 A ). Furthermore, focal adhesions and hemidesmosomes are essential basally localized junctions that mediate cell-basement membrane connections and signaling ( Fig. 1 B ).

Since their discovery, these diverse cell adhesion complexes have demonstrated functions beyond their physiological niche, notably as initiators and recipients of inflammatory signals. Notably, mechanistic investigations into their functions and targets have revealed the involvement of nearly all adhesion proteins in inflammatory responses. It has become clear that the innate immune system, which relies heavily on inflammatory signals, engages in extensive crosstalk with cell adhesion proteins. Former and ongoing investigations into diverse inflammatory-associated diseases, including cancer, have revealed the vital roles that adhesions play in such pathological contexts. Importantly, these studies have informed several immune-based therapeutic developments, such as immune blockers. Although recent research has underscored the significant interconnectivity of cell junctions and inflammatory signal transduction, achieving a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of adhesion protein function during inflammatory disease pathogenesis is essential for the future development of successful therapeutic interventions.
