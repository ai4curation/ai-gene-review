T cells encounter two main checkpoints during development in the thymus. These 
checkpoints are critically dependent on signals derived from the thymic 
microenvironment as well as from the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) and the 
alphabeta TCR. Here we show that T cell-specific deletion of beta-catenin 
impaired T cell development at the beta-selection checkpoint, leading to a 
substantial decrease in splenic T cells. In addition, beta-catenin also seemed 
to be a target of TCR-CD3 signals in thymocytes and mature T cells. These data 
indicate that beta-catenin-mediated signals are required for normal T cell 
development.
