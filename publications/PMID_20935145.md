Bioenergetic homeostasis is altered in heart failure and may play an important 
role in pathogenesis. p53 has been implicated in heart failure, and although its 
role in regulating tumorigenesis is well characterized, its activities on 
cellular metabolism are just beginning to be understood. We investigated the 
role of p53 and its transcriptional target gene TP53-induced glycolysis and 
apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) in myocardial energy metabolism under conditions 
simulating ischemia that can lead to heart failure. Expression of p53 and TIGAR 
was markedly upregulated after myocardial infarction, and apoptotic myocytes 
were decreased by 42% in p53-deficient mouse hearts compared with those in 
wild-type mice. To examine the effect of p53 on energy metabolism, cardiac 
myocytes were exposed to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced p53 and TIGAR expression in a 
p53-dependent manner. Knockdown of p53 or TIGAR increased glycolysis with 
elevated fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels and reduced myocyte apoptosis. Hypoxic 
stress decreased phosphocreatine content and the mitochondrial membrane 
potential of myocytes without changes in ATP content, the effects of which were 
prevented by the knockdown of TIGAR. Inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose 
blocked these bioenergetic effects and TIGAR siRNA-mediated prevention of 
apoptosis, and, in contrast, overexpression of TIGAR reduced glucose utilization 
and increased apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that p53 and TIGAR inhibit 
glycolysis in hypoxic myocytes and that inhibition of glycolysis is closely 
involved in apoptosis, suggesting that p53 and TIGAR are significant mediators 
of cellular energy homeostasis and cell death under ischemic stress.
