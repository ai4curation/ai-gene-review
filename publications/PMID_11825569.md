MHC class I molecules expressed in a calreticulin-deficient cell line (K42) 
assembled with beta 2-microglobulin (beta2-m) normally, but their subsequent 
loading with optimal peptides was defective. Suboptimally loaded class I 
molecules were released into the secretory pathway. This occurred despite the 
ability of newly synthesized class I to interact with the transporter associated 
with antigen processing (TAP) loading complex. The efficiency of peptide loading 
was reduced by 50%-80%, and impaired T cell recognition was observed for three 
out of four antigens tested. The peptide-loading function was specific to 
calreticulin, since the defect in K42 could be rectified by transfection with 
calreticulin but not a soluble form of calnexin, which shares its lectin-like 
activity.
