The MDM2 oncoprotein has transforming potential that can be activated by 
overexpression, and it represents a critical regulator of the p53 tumor 
suppressor protein. To identify other factors with a potential role in 
influencing the expression and/or function of MDM2, we utilized a yeast 
two-hybrid screening protocol. Here we report that MDM2 physically interacts 
with a structurally related protein termed MDMX. The results obtained in these 
studies provide evidence that C-terminal RING finger domains, contained within 
both of these proteins, play an important role in mediating the association 
between MDM2 and MDMX. The interaction of these proteins interferes with MDM2 
degradation, leading to an increase in the steady-state levels of MDM2. MDMX 
also inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, with subsequent accumulation of 
p53. Taken together, these data indicate that MDMX has the potential to regulate 
the expression and function of the MDM2 oncoprotein.
