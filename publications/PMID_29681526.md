Many cancer-related proteins are controlled by composite post-translational 
modifications (PTMs), but prevalent strategies only target one type of 
modification. Here we describe a designed peptide that controls two types of 
modifications of the p53 tumor suppressor, based on the discovery of a protein 
complex that suppresses p53 (suppresome). We found that Morn3, a cancer-testis 
antigen, recruits different PTM enzymes, such as sirtuin deacetylase and 
ubiquitin ligase, to confer composite modifications on p53. The molecular 
functions of Morn3 were validated through in vivo assays and chemico-biological 
intervention. A rationally designed Morn3-targeting peptide (Morncide) 
successfully activated p53 and suppressed tumor growth. These findings shed 
light on the regulation of protein PTMs and present a strategy for targeting two 
modifications with one molecule.
