Glomerular disease is one of the most common causes of end-stage renal failure. 
Increasing evidence suggests that these glomerulopathies are frequently caused 
by primary lesions in the renal podocytes. One of the major consequences of 
podocyte lesions is the accumulation of mesangial matrix in the glomerular 
basement membrane, a process called glomerulosclerosis. Mesangial sclerosis is 
one of the most consistent findings in Denys-Drash patients and can be caused by 
dominant mutations in the Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1). The underlying mechanism, 
however, is poorly understood. WT1 is expressed in the podocytes throughout 
life, but its function in this cell type is unknown. Combining Wt1-knockout and 
inducible yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse models, we demonstrate 
that reduced expression levels of WT1 result in either crescentic 
glomerulonephritis or mesangial sclerosis depending on the gene dosage. 
Strikingly, the two podocyte-specific genes nphs1 and podocalyxin are 
dramatically downregulated in mice with decreased levels of Wt1, suggesting that 
these two genes act downstream of Wt1. Taken together, our data provide genetic 
evidence that reduced levels of Wt1 are responsible for the pathogenesis of two 
distinct renal diseases and offer a molecular explanation for the increased 
occurrence of glomerulosclerosis in patients with WAGR syndrome.
