During embryogenesis, the expression of mammalian stanniocalcin (STC1) in the 
appendicular skeleton suggests its involvement in the regulation of longitudinal 
bone growth. Such a role is further supported by the presence of dwarfism in 
mice overexpressing STC1. Yet, the STC 1 inhibitory effect on growth may be 
related to both postnatal metabolic abnormalities and prenatal defective bone 
formation. In our study, we used an organ culture system to evaluate the effects 
of STC on growth plate chondrogenesis, which is the primary determinant of 
longitudinal bone growth. Fetal rat metatarsal bones were cultured in the 
presence of recombinant human STC (rhSTC). After 3 days, rhSTC suppressed 
metatarsal growth, growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and 
hypertrophy/differentiation, and extracellular matrix synthesis. In addition, 
rhSTC increased the number of apoptotic chondrocytes in the growth plate. In 
cultured chondrocytes, rhSTC increased phosphate uptake, reduced chondrocyte 
proliferation and matrix synthesis, and induced apoptosis. All these effects 
were reversed by culturing chondrocytes with rhSTC and phosphonoformic acid, an 
inhibitor of phosphate transport. The rhSTC-mediated inhibition of metatarsal 
growth and growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and 
hypertrophy/differentiation was abolished by culturing metatarsals with rhSTC 
and phosphonoformic acid. Taken together, our findings indicate that STC1 
inhibits longitudinal bone growth directly at the growth plate. Such growth 
inhibition, likely mediated by an increased chondrocyte phosphate uptake, 
results from suppressed chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy/differentiation, 
and matrix synthesis and by increased apoptosis. Last, the expression of both 
STC1 and its binding site in the growth plate would support an 
autocrine/paracrine role for this growth factor in the regulation of growth 
plate chondrogenesis.
