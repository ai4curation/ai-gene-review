The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein, the product of the gene responsible 
for the motor neuron degenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), is part 
of a large macromolecular complex. The SMN complex is localized in both the 
cytoplasm and the nucleus and contains SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, Gemin5, and 
a few not yet identified proteins. The SMN complex plays a key role in the 
biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other 
ribonucleoprotein particles. As a step toward the complete characterization of 
the components of the SMN complex, we generated stable cell lines that express 
FLAG-tagged SMN or Gemin2 under the control of a tetracycline-inducible 
promoter. Native SMN complexes of identical protein composition to those 
isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-SMN antibodies were purified by 
affinity chromatography from extracts of both cell lines. Here we report the 
identification by mass spectrometry of a novel protein component of the SMN 
complex termed Gemin6. Co-immunoprecipitation, immunolocalization, and in vitro 
binding experiments demonstrate that Gemin6 is a component of the SMN complex 
that localizes to gems and interacts with several Sm proteins of the 
spliceosomal snRNPs.
