Kallmann syndrome associates hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia and is 
probably due to a defect in the embryonic migration of olfactory and 
GnRH-synthesizing neurons. The Kallmann gene had been localized to Xp22.3. In 
this study 67 kb of genomic DNA, corresponding to a deletion interval containing 
at least part of the Kallmann gene, were sequenced. Two candidate exons, 
identified by multiparameter computer programs, were found in a cDNA encoding a 
protein of 679 amino acids. This candidate gene (ADMLX) is interrupted in its 3' 
coding region in the Kallmann patient, in which the proximal end of the KAL 
deletion interval was previously defined. A 5' end deletion was detected in 
another Kallmann patient. The predicted protein sequence shows homologies with 
the fibronectin type III repeat. ADMLX thus encodes a putative adhesion 
molecule, consistent with the defect of embryonic neuronal migration.
