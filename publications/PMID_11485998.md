Most mutations after DNA damage in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are induced by 
error-prone translesion DNA synthesis employing scRev1 and DNA polymerase zeta 
that consists of scRev3 and scRev7 proteins. Recently, the human REV1 (hREV1) 
and REV3 (hREV3) genes were identified, and their products were revealed to be 
involved in UV-induced mutagenesis, as observed for their yeast counterparts. 
Human REV7 (hREV7) was also cloned, and its product was found to interact with 
hREV3, but the biological function of hREV7 remained unknown. We report here the 
analyses of precise interactions in the human REV proteins. The interaction 
between hREV1 and hREV7 was identified by the yeast two-hybrid library screening 
using a bait of hREV7, which was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo binding 
assays. The homodimerization of hREV7 was also detected in the two-hybrid 
analysis. In addition, the precise domains for interaction between hREV7 and 
hREV1 or hREV3 and for hREV7 homodimerization were determined. Although hREV7 
interacts with both hREV1 and hREV3, a stable complex formation of the three 
proteins was undetectable in vitro. These findings suggest the possibility that 
hREV7 might play an important role in regulating the enzymatic activities of 
hREV1 and hREV3 for mutagenesis in response to DNA damage.
