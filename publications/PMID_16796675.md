The assembly of ring-like structures, composed of FtsZ proteins (i.e. the Z 
ring), is the earliest and most essential process in bacterial cytokinesis. It 
has been shown that this process is directly regulated by the FtsZ-binding 
proteins, FtsA, ZapA, and EzrA, in Bacillus subtilis. In this study, protein 
complexes that are involved in Z-ring formation were chemically cross-linked in 
vivo, purified by affinity chromatography, and analysed by mass spectrometry. 
Analysis of the results identified YlmF as a new component of the FtsZ complex. 
Yeast two-hybrid analysis and fluorescence microscopy of YFP-YlmF in B. subtilis 
cells indicated YlmF localizes to the division site in an FtsZ-dependent manner. 
A single disruption of YlmF resulted in a slight elongation of cells; however, 
simultaneous inactivation of both YlmF and FtsA showed synthetic lethality 
caused by complete blockage of cell division due to the defect in Z-ring 
formation. In contrast, the ftsA-null mutant phenotype, caused by inefficient 
Z-ring formation, could be complemented by overexpression of YlmF. These results 
suggest that YlmF has an overlapping function with FtsA in stimulating the 
formation of Z rings in B. subtilis.
