BACKGROUND: Apamin-sensitive small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) 
channels are gated by intracellular Ca(2+) through a constitutive interaction 
with calmodulin.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that arrhythmogenic human calmodulin mutations impede 
activation of SK channels.
METHODS: We studied 5 previously published calmodulin mutations (N54I, N98S, 
D96V, D130G, and F90L). Plasmids encoding either wild-type or mutant calmodulin 
were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells that stably 
express subtype 2 of SK protein channels (SK2 cells). Whole-cell voltage-clamp 
recording was used to determine apamin-sensitive current densities. We also 
performed optical mapping studies in normal murine hearts to determine the 
effects of apamin in hearts with (n=7) or without (n=3) pretreatment with sea 
anemone toxin.
RESULTS: SK2 cells transfected with wild-type calmodulin exhibited an 
apamin-sensitive current density of 33.6 pA/pF (31.4-36.5 pA/pF) (median and 
confidence interval 25th-75th percentile), which was significantly higher than 
that observed for cells transfected with N54I (17.0 pA/pF [14.0-27.7 pA/pF]; P = 
.016), F90L (22.6 pA/pF [20.3-24.3 pA/pF]; P = .011), D96V (13.0 pA/pF 
[10.9-15.8 pA/pF]; P = .003), N98S (13.7 pA/pF [8.8-20.4 pA/pF]; P = .005), and 
D130G (17.6 pA/pF [13.8-24.6 pA/pF]; P = .003). The decrease in SK2 current 
densities was not associated with a decrease in membrane protein expression or 
intracellular distribution of the channel protein. Apamin increased the 
ventricular action potential duration at 80% repolarization (from 79.6 ms 
[63.4-93.3 ms] to 121.8 ms [97.9-127.2 ms]; P = .010) in hearts pretreated with 
anemone toxin but not in control hearts.
CONCLUSION: Human arrhythmogenic calmodulin mutations impede the activation of 
SK2 channels in human embryonic kidney 293 cells.

Methods

We studied 5 previously published calmodulin mutations (N54I, N98S, D96V, D130G and F90L). Plasmids encoding either wild type (WT) or mutant calmodulin were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that stably express SK2 channels (SK2 Cells). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recording was used to determine apamin-sensitive current ( I KAS ) densities. We also performed optical mapping studies in normal murine hearts to determine the effects of apamin in hearts with (N=7) or without (N=3) pretreatment with sea anemone toxin (ATX II).

Results

SK2 cells transfected with WT calmodulin exhibited I KAS density (in pA/pF) of 33.6 [31.4;36.5] (median and confidence interval 25%-75%), significantly higher than that observed for cells transfected with N54I (17.0 [14.0;27.7], p =0.016), F90L (22.6 [20.3;24.3], p =0.011), D96V (13.0 [10.9;15.8], p =0.003), N98S (13.7 [8.8;20.4], p =0.005) and D130G (17.6 [13.8;24.6], p =0.003). The reduction of SK2 current was not associated with a decrease in membrane protein expression or intracellular distribution of the channel protein. Apamin increased the ventricular APD 80 (from 79.6 ms [63.4-93.3] to 121.8 ms [97.9-127.2], p =0.010) in hearts pre-treated with ATX-II but not in control hearts.

Conclusion

Human arrhythmogenic calmodulin mutations impede the activation of SK2 channels in HEK 293 cells.

Introduction

Small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels carry a repolarization current responsible for afterhyperpolarization of neurons in the nervous system and contributes to the modulation of intrinsic excitability, synaptic transmission and long-term changes that affect learning and memory formation. 1 , 2 SK also contributes significantly to the repolarization of atrial myocytes 3 , 4 and promotes automaticity and atrioventricular node conduction. 5 SK is upregulated in atrial fibrillation, heart failure and myocardial infarction. 4 , 6 - 8 While SK current is difficult to detect in normal ventricular myocytes at normal pacing rates, 3 , 6 , 9 it is important for ventricular repolarization during bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) block. 10 Apamin is a specific SK current blocker in both neuronal type and cardiac type ion channels. 1 , 11 SK current blockade by apamin can cause premature ventricular contraction, QT prolongation and torsades de pointes ventricular arrhythmia in normal rabbit ventricles. 10 However, there are no reported cases of SK channel mutations in humans with cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, the importance of SK current in human arrhythmogenesis remains unclear. Calmodulin mutations were reported to be associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT; N54I, N98S), 12 congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) with recurrent cardiac arrest (D96V, D130G and F142L) 13 and childhood and adolescent onset idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) (F90L). 14 Because SK channels are gated by intracellular Ca 2+ through a constitutive interaction between the pore-forming subunits and calmodulin, 1 it is possible that mutant calmodulin may impede the activation of the SK currents. We used human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that stably express subtype 2 of SK protein (SK2 cells) to test this hypothesis.

The study was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Indiana University and the Methodist Research Institute, Indianapolis, Indiana. Detailed methods are included in an online supplement .

Figure 1A illustrates representative current tracings from an SK2 cell before (trace a) and after (trace b) apamin, respectively, obtained by the descending voltage ramp protocol shown in the inset. Trace b shows the small endogenous current (<100 pA). Figure 1B shows the time course of the entire experiment. The current was fully activated 4 min after break-in and was completely suppressed by apamin. In Figure 1C , immunofluorescence shows SK2 protein (red fluorescence) expressed in all SK2 cells (left panel) while no detectable SK2 fluorescence was observed in naïve HEK 293 cells (right panel). This examination also confirmed the specificity of the SK2 antibody in HEK 293 cells.

Discussion

Co-expression of WT calmodulin significantly enhanced the current density of the SK2 cells, while mutant calmodulin abolished this effect. The cotransfection of WT and D96V calmodulins in cultured HEK 293 cells caused a dose-dependent loss-of-function in SK2 gating, suggesting haploinsufficiency as its mechanism. The effect of D96V on SK2 gating is probably induced by a failure of the mutated calmodulin to fully open SK2 channels in response to elevated intracellular calcium.

D96V mutation results in loss-of-function calmodulin and impedes SK2 activities

When SK2 channels are produced and traffic to the cell membrane, calmodulin is already constitutively bound to the calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) of SK2 channel. 22 , 23 The C-lobe of calmodulin is bound to SK2 CaMBD in a Ca 2+ -independent manner and this interaction is also required for surface expression of SK channels. 23 - 26 The N-lobe of calmodulin is important for mediating SK channel gating by binding Ca 2+ to the EF hand motifs. 23 , 26 In in-vitro studies, the Ca 2+ affinity of C-domain of D96V, N98S, F142L and D130G calmodulins was reduced, while Ca 2+ affinity of N-domains was not changed compared to wild type. 13 , 27 However, in the SK2 channel complex, calmodulin is constitutively bound to the CaMBD of SK2 channel via C-domain of calmodulin. We do not know whether these mutations would hinder or enhance the binding between calmodulin and SK2 channels. A crystal structure study showed that the C-domain of the calmodulin in the SK2 channel complex was conformationally distinct from Ca 2+ -bound status in vitro. 23 Similarly, it is also not known whether the Ca affinity of N-domain in vitro represents the Ca affinity of N-domain when the C-domain is already bound on CaMBD of SK2 channel and already experiences conformational change. Therefore, the data from recently published in vitro Ca binding assay may not be directly relevant to our study. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the mutations of the C-lobe may hinder the binding of calmodulin onto SK2 channel or impede the trafficking of SK2 protein onto cell membrane. Our confocal immunofluorescence experiments showed similar pattern of intracellular distribution of SK2 protein among SK2 cells with or without WT or mutant calmodulin transfection. These findings imply that SK2 protein distribution is not affected by excess amount of calmodulin expression nor the presence of mutated calmodulin.

In the WT:D96V cotransfection study ( figure 3 ), there was a progressive decrease in the SK current density with an increasing D96V:WT ratio, suggesting that D96V calmodulin lost its function on gating SK2 channel. The left shift of Ca-sensitivity curve of D96V indicates increased Ca 2+ sensitivity ( figure 4B ). In vitro Ca 2+ binding studies 13 showed D96V reduced Ca 2+ affinity in the C-domain but not in the N-domain. We postulate that, at lower total Ca 2+ concentration, the reduced Ca 2+ binding affinity of C domain (of D96V calmodulin) increases the availability of intracellular free Ca 2+ for the EF hands in the N-lobe of calmodulin, which results in conformational changes that increased Ca 2+ -sensitivity of the SK2 current. The same mechanism does not operate at higher Ca 2+ concentration (1 µM or higher), when Ca 2+ is easily available to both N and C terminal domains.

Because of the existence of intrinsic calmodulin in D96V transfected SK2 cells, each SK2 channel would be composed of different proportions of WT and mutant calmodulins. Our findings suggest that co-existence of D96V calmodulins in each SK2 channel complex increased SK2 channel Ca 2+ sensitivity. In patients harboring heterozygous calmodulin mutations, we may expect the same mechanism with the SK2 current more easily activated, but producing a subnormal SK2 current in a cardiomyocyte or a neuron. Further detailed studies are warranted to decipher the complicated interaction between free cytosolic calcium, mutant calmodulin and SK2 subunits.

We conclude that human arrhythmogenic calmodulin mutations impede the activation of SK2 channels in HEK 293 cells. The relevance of these results to calmodulinopathy remains unclear and deserves further study.
