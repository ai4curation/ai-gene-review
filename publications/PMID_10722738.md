Expression of the transcription unit early region 2 (E2) is of crucial 
importance for adenoviruses because this region encodes proteins essential for 
viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that the E1A(12S) protein of the 
oncogenic adenovirus serotype 12 activates the E2 promoter in dependence of the 
N terminus and the conserved region 1. Activation is mediated through a 
cAMP-response element that is bound by CREB-1 and ATF-1. Moreover, the Ad12 E2 
promoter is inducible by protein kinase A and repressed by either a 
dominant-negative cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) mutant or the 
highly specific protein kinase A inhibitor protein underscoring the 
participation of CREB-1/ATF-1 in promoter activation. E1A(12S) binds to CREB-1 
and ATF-1 in dependence of the N terminus and CR1 and is recruited to the E2 
cAMP-response element through both cellular transcription factors. Most 
interestingly, point mutations revealed that E1A(12S) domains essential for 
binding to CREB-1/ATF-1 and for activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter are also 
essential for binding to the CREB-binding protein. Due to these data and results 
obtained in DNA-dependent protein-protein interaction assays, we propose a model 
in which the cAMP-independent activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter is mediated 
through a ternary complex consisting of CREB-1/ATF-1, E1A(12S), and CREB-binding 
protein, which assembles on the E2 cAMP-response element.
