Binding specificity between fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors 
(FGFRs) is essential for mammalian development and is regulated primarily by two 
alternatively spliced exons, IIIb ("b") and IIIc ("c"), that encode the second 
half of Ig-like domain 3 (D3) of FGFRs. FGF7 and FGF10 activate only the b 
isoform of FGFR2 (FGFR2b). Here, we report the crystal structure of the 
ligand-binding portion of FGFR2b bound to FGF10. Unique contacts between 
divergent regions in FGF10 and two b-specific loops in D3 reveal the structural 
basis by which alternative splicing provides FGF10-FGFR2b specificity. 
Structure-based mutagenesis of FGF10 confirms the importance of the observed 
contacts for FGF10 biological activity. Interestingly, FGF10 binding induces a 
previously unobserved rotation of receptor Ig domain 2 (D2) to introduce 
specific contacts with FGF10. Hence, both D2 and D3 of FGFR2b contribute to the 
exceptional specificity between FGF10 and FGFR2b. We propose that ligand-induced 
conformational change in FGFRs may also play an important role in determining 
specificity for other FGF-FGFR complexes.
