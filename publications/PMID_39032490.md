INTS11 and CPSF73 are metal-dependent endonucleases for Integrator and pre-mRNA 
3'-end processing, respectively. Here, we show that the INTS11 binding partner 
BRAT1/CG7044, a factor important for neuronal fitness, stabilizes INTS11 in the 
cytoplasm and is required for Integrator function in the nucleus. Loss of BRAT1 
in neural organoids leads to transcriptomic disruption and precocious expression 
of neurogenesis-driving transcription factors. The structures of the human 
INTS9-INTS11-BRAT1 and Drosophila dIntS11-CG7044 complexes reveal that the 
conserved C terminus of BRAT1/CG7044 is captured in the active site of INTS11, 
with a cysteine residue directly coordinating the metal ions. Inspired by these 
observations, we find that UBE3D is a binding partner for CPSF73, and UBE3D 
likely also uses a conserved cysteine residue to directly coordinate the active 
site metal ions. Our studies have revealed binding partners for INTS11 and 
CPSF73 that behave like cytoplasmic chaperones with a conserved impact on the 
nuclear functions of these enzymes.
