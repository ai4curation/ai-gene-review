Situated on the northern coast of the Indonesian island of Java, Jakarta and its 
metropolitan area (Greater Jakarta) are subject to significant earthquake 
hazards from a subduction zone south of Java and nearby active crustal faults. 
The seismic risk may be even higher because Greater Jakarta resides on a 
sedimentary basin filled with thick Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments. A 
comprehensive study of Jakarta Basin's properties and geometry is important for 
creating robust seismic hazard and risk assessments. The main objective of this 
study is to develop a 3-D model of Jakarta Basin's shallow shear-wave velocity 
(VS ) structure and improve on previous models that did not cover the basin edge 
due to the extent of data coverage. Between April and October 2018, we deployed 
a new temporary seismic network to extend the spatial coverage beyond that of a 
previous deployment in 2013, and sampled 143 locations through sequential 
deployments of 30 broad-band sensors covering Jakarta and its adjacent areas. We 
conducted a 2-stage transdimensional Bayesian inversion of Rayleigh wave phase 
velocity dispersion curves derived from seismic noise. To begin, we applied 
tomography and constructed 2-D phase velocity maps for periods 1-5 s. Then, at 
each point in a regular grid defined on these maps, we invert each dispersion 
curve into 1-D depth profiles of VS . Finally, these profiles at gridpoints with 
∼2 km spacing are interpolated to form a pseudo-3-D VS model. Our results reveal 
the edge of the Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments along the south. Also, we resolve 
a basement offset across south Jakarta that we suggest may be related to the 
western extension of the Baribis Fault (alternatively, the West Java Backarc 
Thrust). We recommend using this 3-D model of the Jakarta Basin for scenario 
earthquake ground motion simulations. Such simulations would help establish how 
important it might be to re-assess seismic hazard and risk in Greater Jakarta so 
that basin resonance and amplification are considered.

1.INTRODUCTIONThe city of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital and one of the world's megacities, is located on the northern coast of the Indonesian island of Java. Greater Jakarta (Jakarta and its metropolitan area: Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi and Bogor) is one of the world's most populous urban areas (United Nations 2018) with about 35 million inhabitants in an area of 3367 km2, while more than 11 million residents live within Jakarta itself. The region is subject to significant earthquake hazards from a subduction zone south of Java and active crustal faults in West Java. In consequence, Jakarta's high population density of more than 14 000 people per square km means the city is likely a hotspot of seismic risk.At the Java Trench (see Fig. 1), about 300 km south of Jakarta, the Australian Plate subducts beneath the Sundaland Block with a convergence rate of about 60 mm yr−1 (Simons et al. 2007; Koulali et al. 2017). The closest segments of this subduction megathrust to Jakarta are Selat Sunda and West-Central Java, which have the potential for generating earthquakes as large as magnitude 8.7 (Irsyam et al. 2020). In addition, Jakarta and its metropolitan area are at risk from earthquakes that may occur on active crustal faults, namely the Cimandiri (Katili & Soetadi 1971), Lembang (Daryono et al. 2019) and Baribis (Simandjuntak & Barber 1996; Koulali et al. 2017; Damanik et al. 2021) Faults. The Baribis Fault, a backarc thrust fault in West Java, has been active since the Pliocene but is less clearly expressed in its western extent, near Jakarta, than it is farther east (Aribowo et al. 2022).

These studies were limited to the city of Jakarta, yet the Jakarta Basin appears to extend beyond the city into Greater Jakarta.This study aims to develop a 3-D model of Jakarta Basin's shallow shear-wave velocity (VS) structure. We propose a new model of the Jakarta Basin based on two-step transdimensional seismic ambient noise tomography; to improve previous models that have not revealed how far the basin extends beyond the city limits.

INTRODUCTION

The city of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital and one of the world's megacities, is located on the northern coast of the Indonesian island of Java. Greater Jakarta (Jakarta and its metropolitan area: Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi and Bogor) is one of the world's most populous urban areas (United Nations 2018) with about 35 million inhabitants in an area of 3367 km2, while more than 11 million residents live within Jakarta itself. The region is subject to significant earthquake hazards from a subduction zone south of Java and active crustal faults in West Java. In consequence, Jakarta's high population density of more than 14 000 people per square km means the city is likely a hotspot of seismic risk.

At the Java Trench (see Fig. 1), about 300 km south of Jakarta, the Australian Plate subducts beneath the Sundaland Block with a convergence rate of about 60 mm yr−1 (Simons et al. 2007; Koulali et al. 2017). The closest segments of this subduction megathrust to Jakarta are Selat Sunda and West-Central Java, which have the potential for generating earthquakes as large as magnitude 8.7 (Irsyam et al. 2020). In addition, Jakarta and its metropolitan area are at risk from earthquakes that may occur on active crustal faults, namely the Cimandiri (Katili & Soetadi 1971), Lembang (Daryono et al. 2019) and Baribis (Simandjuntak & Barber 1996; Koulali et al. 2017; Damanik et al. 2021) Faults. The Baribis Fault, a backarc thrust fault in West Java, has been active since the Pliocene but is less clearly expressed in its western extent, near Jakarta, than it is farther east (Aribowo et al. 2022). Subsequently, Widiyantoro et al. (2022) also denote that the western Baribis Fault running through the southern part of Jakarta is locked and may accumulate elastic stress energy.

Map of the seismic deployments and surface geology around Jakarta, modified from the regional geological maps (Turkandi et al. 1992; Simandjuntak & Barber 1996; Effendi et al. 1998). Red triangles are the seismic stations deployed between October 2013 and February 2014. Blue triangles are the seismic stations deployed between April 2018 and October 2018. The province and subprovince administrative boundaries of Jakarta are shown with dashed lines.

The seismic risk is enhanced by Jakarta's location on a sedimentary basin filled with geologically young sediments. Jakarta and its vicinity's surface geology are composed almost entirely of alluvium and beach ridge deposits (Turkandi et al. 1992). Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments of the Jakarta Basin gradually thicken from its southern edge with a thickness of around 50 m to central Jakarta with a thickness of more than 350 m (Fachri et al. 2002; Lubis et al. 2008). Such a thick young sedimentary layer enclosed in a basin should experience resonance and amplification of seismic ground motion (e.g. Rial et al. 1992), as has been observed in the 1985 Michoacan (Kawase & Aki 1989), the 1995 Kobe (Kawase 1996), the 2015 Kathmandu (Galetzka et al. 2015) and the 2017 Mexico City (Sahakian et al. 2018) earthquakes. In these and other events, poorly consolidated sediments and basin geometries caused amplification and prolongation of shaking, which strongly influenced the type and extent of the damage.

A thorough study of a basin's seismic properties and geometry is crucial to creating robust seismic hazard and risk assessments. To our knowledge, seismic hazard assessments for Greater Jakarta (Irsyam et al. 2020) are still developing and have yet to consider sedimentary basin-related effects on earthquake's ground motion. Studies have shown the importance of 3-D geometry for modelling seismic wave propagation in basins due to edge-diffracted waves (Kawase 1996; Ewald et al. 2006) and local-scale multiscattering and prolonged ground motion (Olsen et al. 2006; Denolle et al. 2014; Cruz-Atienza et al. 2016).

Such basin geometry can be modelled by constraining the velocity structure. The methods may include boreholes, active seismic surveys such as seismic reflection and refraction, or passive measurements such as microtremor and seismic interferometry. However, direct approaches are impractical and too expensive in urban areas, so the Jakarta Basin studies mainly rely on passive seismic (Ridwan et al. 2016, 2019; Saygin et al. 2016; 2017; Cipta et al. 2018a) and few borehole measurements (Fachri et al. 2002). These studies were limited to the city of Jakarta, yet the Jakarta Basin appears to extend beyond the city into Greater Jakarta.

This study aims to develop a 3-D model of Jakarta Basin's shallow shear-wave velocity (VS) structure. We propose a new model of the Jakarta Basin based on two-step transdimensional seismic ambient noise tomography; to improve previous models that have not revealed how far the basin extends beyond the city limits. The model we developed in this study shows the expansion of sedimentary basin fill that mainly reaches Greater Jakarta and the edge of Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments in the south. We also present an apparent basement offset across south Jakarta, which may be related to the western extension of the Baribis Fault.

2.THE JAKARTA BASINFachri et al. (2002) used borehole data to establish that the Jakarta Basin stratigraphy from old to young mainly consists of formations from the Middle Miocene to the Pliocene–Holocene. Pleistocene–Holocene sediments dominate the near-surface geology of Jakarta and its vicinity, with thickness varying between 31.5 and 53 m (described as alluvium fan deposits in Turkandi et al. 1992). Pliocene sediment lies beneath with thickness ranging from 250 to 400 m and includes a mixture of sandstone and claystone. The Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments are found in most borehole logs in Greater Jakarta (Fachri et al. 2002). They form aquifer and aquitard zones in the Jakarta Basin hydrostratigraphy.The Pliocene sediments are underlain by Miocene sediments that behave as a hydrological basement (Fachri et al. 2002; Lubis et al. 2008). The Miocene sediment may be regarded as engineering bedrock due to its higher compaction, although it is not necessarily a seismological basement. Evidence presented in boreholes (Fachri et al. 2002) exhibits different interfaces of Miocene sediments. Late Miocene sediments were found mainly in the north, while the south had mainly sediment of Middle Miocene age.Aside from the few geological studies, the Jakarta Basin has been exposed to few passive geophysical measurements. The following studies focus on the area of Jakarta to estimate the basin thickness underneath the city. Ridwan et al. (2016) applied the spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method and suggested that the depth of engineering bedrock (VS > 750 m s−1) reaches 725 m in the north and gradually decreases southward to about 350 m in the south. Saygin et al. (2016) developed a 3-D model for the basin structure by extracting Rayleigh wave group velocity measurements using Green's functions obtained from cross-correlograms of ambient noise at different station pairs. They suggested that the sedimentary basin covers most of the area of the city with a thickness of up to 1500 m below central Jakarta. The same data were subsequently used in studies reaching similar findings, in which P-wave reflectivity obtained from seismic noise was used to estimate basin depth (Saygin et al. 2017), and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) curves were used to estimate refined VS structure (Cipta et al. 2018a).These previous studies have consistently shown a basin fill with average VS of about 500 m s−1 that increases in thickness (300–1000 m) from south to north. However, the extent of these deployments appears not to have covered the edge of the basin, so that estimates of basement depth obtained by these earlier studies were greater than 300–400 m, even at the southern edge of the array coverage. In this study, we attempted to resolve the basin edge by deploying a new seismic experiment comprising 143 points to cover Greater Jakarta, extending to outside the city limits of Jakarta itself.

THE JAKARTA BASIN

Fachri et al. (2002) used borehole data to establish that the Jakarta Basin stratigraphy from old to young mainly consists of formations from the Middle Miocene to the Pliocene–Holocene. Pleistocene–Holocene sediments dominate the near-surface geology of Jakarta and its vicinity, with thickness varying between 31.5 and 53 m (described as alluvium fan deposits in Turkandi et al. 1992). Pliocene sediment lies beneath with thickness ranging from 250 to 400 m and includes a mixture of sandstone and claystone. The Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments are found in most borehole logs in Greater Jakarta (Fachri et al. 2002). They form aquifer and aquitard zones in the Jakarta Basin hydrostratigraphy.

The Pliocene sediments are underlain by Miocene sediments that behave as a hydrological basement (Fachri et al. 2002; Lubis et al. 2008). The Miocene sediment may be regarded as engineering bedrock due to its higher compaction, although it is not necessarily a seismological basement. Evidence presented in boreholes (Fachri et al. 2002) exhibits different interfaces of Miocene sediments. Late Miocene sediments were found mainly in the north, while the south had mainly sediment of Middle Miocene age.

Aside from the few geological studies, the Jakarta Basin has been exposed to few passive geophysical measurements. The following studies focus on the area of Jakarta to estimate the basin thickness underneath the city. Ridwan et al. (2016) applied the spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method and suggested that the depth of engineering bedrock (VS > 750 m s−1) reaches 725 m in the north and gradually decreases southward to about 350 m in the south. Saygin et al. (2016) developed a 3-D model for the basin structure by extracting Rayleigh wave group velocity measurements using Green's functions obtained from cross-correlograms of ambient noise at different station pairs. They suggested that the sedimentary basin covers most of the area of the city with a thickness of up to 1500 m below central Jakarta. The same data were subsequently used in studies reaching similar findings, in which P-wave reflectivity obtained from seismic noise was used to estimate basin depth (Saygin et al. 2017), and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) curves were used to estimate refined VS structure (Cipta et al. 2018a).

These previous studies have consistently shown a basin fill with average VS of about 500 m s−1 that increases in thickness (300–1000 m) from south to north. However, the extent of these deployments appears not to have covered the edge of the basin, so that estimates of basement depth obtained by these earlier studies were greater than 300–400 m, even at the southern edge of the array coverage. In this study, we attempted to resolve the basin edge by deploying a new seismic experiment comprising 143 points to cover Greater Jakarta, extending to outside the city limits of Jakarta itself.

3.DATA AND METHODSThis study combines two temporary seismic networks that were deployed separately: (1) the 2013–2014 network (see Saygin et al. 2016) and (2) the 2018 network. Both networks used three-component broad-band seismometers (Trillium Compact) and digitizers built by the Australian National University. The instruments were installed temporarily in schools, on concrete slab floors, throughout the city with a spacing of 3–5 km (Fig. 1). The 2013–2014 network covered most of the area within Jakarta's city limits with 96 stations. This network has been used in earlier studies to model the Jakarta Basin's geometry (Saygin et al. 2016; 2017; Cipta et al. 2018a). For this study, in 2018, we deployed another seismic network aiming mainly to expand the coverage outside Jakarta to reveal the extent of the sedimentary basin. This 2018 deployment comprised 143 stations where the 30 seismometers were maintained and redeployed in five phases with at least one month of recording at each site (Ry et al. 2019).We used seismic ambient noise tomography (ANT) to the data of both seismic networks. The data analysis follows this workflow: (1) we derived the noise correlation function of Rayleigh wave from the cross-correlation of vertical seismograms, (2) we estimated the phase velocity dispersion curve at each interstation midpoint from the real part of the NCF's spectrum, (3) we invert these dispersion curves to map 2-D Rayleigh wave velocity tomograms at various periods and (4) we invert dispersion curves for VS depth profiles on a set of the regularly spaced gridpoints covering the study area and then interpolate these to obtain a pseudo-3-D VS model of the Jakarta Basin.3.1.Noise correlation functionsTo assess surface waves, the empirical Green's function (GF) between two stations is often derived by cross-correlating their background ambient noise (Shapiro & Campillo 2004). Various processing workflows for this have been suggested, such as in Yao et al. (2006), Bensen et al. (2007) and Seats et al. (2012). Bensen et al. (2007), suggest the calculation of daily seismogram cross-correlations (correlograms); then, the daily correlograms over weeks, months, or years are stacked together to enhance the emergence of the surface wave signal. These stacked correlograms are usually called a noise correlation function (NCF). Meanwhile, Seats et al. (2012) propose shorter and overlapping time windows for cross-correlation and stacking to enhance the signal in NCF. They note that this approach benefits ambient seismic studies with limited recording duration and high levels of discontinuous local noise.In this study, we used the HiPerSeis package (Hassan et al. 2020) to obtain Rayleigh wave NCFs. The use of HiPerSeis, which is optimized for high-performance computing clusters and therefore allows for rapid assessment of processed results, allowed us to test many different choices for processing options and parameters (Hejrani et al. 2020). Prior to the calculation of NCFs, we checked the data for possible GPS clock drifts and other timing errors. Such problems are common in seismic instruments for various reasons and authors have taken different approaches to identify or correct for such errors (see, e.g. Hejrani et al. 2015, 2017, 2020; Hable et al. 2018). Using functionalities of HiPerSeis (Gorbatov et al. 2020), we assessed the GPS clock stability at a daily level for each station and we did not observe any drifts in the clocks.We briefly describe our workflow to calculate NCFs as follows. The vertical seismograms for all stations in miniseed format were converted to ASDF. The data in the time domain was resampled to 10 Hz, then means and trends were removed. Bandpass filtering was performed between 0.02 and 4 Hz. The data was normalized in the time domain so that it is approximately distributed as a standard normal distribution (e.g. Hawkins & Sambridge 2019). Spectral whitening was applied with a window frequency of 0.02 Hz. The vertical seismograms for all available station pairs were cross-correlated in one-hour-long segments with 75 per cent overlap (Seats et al. 2012). The results were stacked linearly over the entire recording period.To assess the excitation of surface waves, we visualize two sets of NCFs in Fig. 2, one from our 2018 deployment (Fig. 2a) and the other from the 2013 to 2014 deployment (Fig. 2b). We term the waves propagating towards the reference station as causal and away from the station as acausal (the opposite convention to Saygin et al. 2016). It can be observed that the NCFs are asymmetrical and emerge more clearly in the acausal part of the correlograms. Generally, the NCF is a good approximation to GF when the noise sources are randomly but homogenously distributed (Wapenaar et al. 2005; Snieder 2007). However, in many real data applications, the background seismic energy is not evenly distributed as it depends on the coupling between ocean waves and coastlines. In this study area, the asymmetrical NCFs strongly suggest a non-homogenous distribution of the ambient noise sources at the frequencies of interest. The most robust energy appears in the acausal part of the NCFs of the north reference stations, indicating that the source of noise is dominantly in the north, that is an embayment of the Java Sea. Other studies of ambient noise in the central and western part of Java (Zulfakriza et al. 2014; Pranata et al. 2020; Rosalia et al. 2020; Yudistira et al. 2021) also illustrate this dominance of the ambient seismic noise wavefield by sources in the Java Sea.Figure 2.Retrieved Green's functions of Rayleigh waves between the reference stations: (a) JK087 (the 2018 network), (b) JKA17 (the 2013–2014 network) and others. Correlograms were filtered between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz for plotting. Red and green lines show group velocities of 2 and 0.25 km s−1, respectively. Inset map shows the location of the reference source stations (yellow stars) and receiver stations (triangles).Saygin et al. (2016) also noted the asymmetric character of the NCFs in the Jakarta Basin, particularly along paths with nearly SN orientation, and interpreted this asymmetry as reflecting fundamental mode propagation in the SN direction (causal using our convention in Fig. 2), and 1st order overtone propagation in the NS direction (acausal in Fig. 2), based on the higher group velocity of the latter. We had difficulty following this interpretation for two reasons: (1) The arrival in the acausal part of the NCF is always at least as pronounced as that in the causal part and (2) The arrival in the causal part of the NCF vanishes for paths that extend outside the basin (as seen in the upper right portion of Fig. 2a). While several other studies have noted the presence of overtones in NCFs recorded in sedimentary basins (Savage et al. 2013; Boué et al. 2016), and in some cases, the 1st overtone can be dominant (Rivet et al. 2015), we know of no other case where fundamental and 1st overtone are so clearly separated into causal and acausal parts of the NCF due to anisotropic noise.In developing an alternative interpretation, we note that the fundamental change in character between the causal and acausal parts of the Jakarta Basin NCFs is one of frequency content: the causal part (SN propagation in our convention) always involves higher frequencies than the acausal part. This is illustrated in Fig. S1, where we have used the same data from Fig 2(a) and displayed separately the spectra associated with the causal and acausal parts. The signal in the acausal part of the NCF is confined to frequencies below 0.4 Hz, while the causal part contains energy in the range 0.5–2 Hz. We speculate that, for reasons we have yet to ascertain, the constructive interference of the ambient noise to produce a GF is more effective for SN (causal) propagation in the higher frequency band (up to 2 Hz), and more effective for NS (acausal) propagation in the lower frequency band. The much lower apparent velocity of the causal arrival with respect to the acausal arrivals could simply be because the causal arrivals correspond to the slower, high-frequency component of the fundamental mode GF, while the acausal arrivals correspond to the faster, low-frequency component of the fundamental mode GF.This interpretation is illustrated in Figs S2(a) and (b), where we compare synthetics that include only the fundamental mode with those that include both fundamental and 1st overtone, calculated for a VS profile near the centre of the stations used in the record section of Fig. S1. We follow Boué et al. (2016) in using a surface point source excitation (Harkrider & Anderson 1966) to calculate fundamental and 1st overtone spectra (Fig. S2c), and high-pass filter the causal part of the synthetics at 0.5 Hz, while the acausal part is low-passed filtered at 0.4 Hz. While the presence of the 1st overtone has some influence on the waveforms in both causal and acausal parts (Fig. S2b), the dominance of the fundamental mode is reflected in the similarity of waveforms in Figs S2(a) and (b), and in the spectra of Fig. S2(c). We also note that the phase velocity curves of fundamental and overtone are well separated, with no osculation. While we have only established self-consistency and not necessarily veracity of our interpretation that the acausal and causal parts of the NCF are both mainly associated with the fundamental mode, we believe this interpretation is as viable as the fundamental versus 1st overtone interpretation of Saygin et al. (2016). Therefore, we assume in what follows that both causal and acausal parts of our NCFs can be interpreted as reflecting the fundamental mode only. We leave the resolution of how much (or how little) the 1st overtone contributes to our NCFs to future work.3.2.Estimation of phase velocityWe analysed the NCFs of all station pairs to estimate the phase velocity of Rayleigh waves.

Missed or extra zeros results in jumps or discontinuities in the range of phase velocities branches obtained from eq. (3) (Hejrani et al. 2020).In consequence, Prieto et al. (2009) suggested a way to estimate an average phase velocity dispersion curve beneath an array. They demonstrated this by measuring the coherency in a frequency–distance domain between the real part of all NCFs spectrum and the Bessel function. Both approaches by Ekström et al. (2009) and Prieto et al. (2009) assess phase velocity from the relation between zero crossings of the NCF spectrum and the Bessel function. Accordingly, Hejrani et al. (2020). combined those to develop a two-stage semi-automatic routine to extract dispersion curves efficiently.We measured phase velocity dispersion curves following Hejrani et al. (2020), who did this in two stages. First, an average dispersion curve was calculated beneath an array (or a subarray) following Prieto et al. (2009). Given that the shallow lithologies in our study area are relatively complex and we attempted to obtain dispersion curves at frequencies up to 1 Hz, we estimated multiple average dispersion curves for three subsets of stations (see Fig. S3). Secondly, dispersion curves were picked manually among the branches identified with eqs (2) and (3) (Ekström et al. 2009) following these rules: (1) to select the correct branch of dispersion curve among the ones generated in eq. (3) for various values of m, we used our average dispersion curve as a guide at low frequencies. We selected a branch that is within one cycle (up and down) of the reference dispersion curve. The lowest frequency we consider was defined by the longest wavelength that could be detected given the inter-station distance. (2) We then manually assessed the selected branch to higher frequencies, up to 1 Hz. We considered jumps and drops in the dispersion curves due to missing or extra zeros in the spectrum as well as the amplitude of the oscillations in the spectrum.To generate average dispersion curves, we considered three subsets of stations, named subset-1, subset-2 and all-pairs, where subsets 1 and 2 are sitting in different geological settings (see Fig. S3). Following Prieto et al. (2009), the station pairs in each subset were binned based on their interstation distance (250 meters bins), and the one with the highest SNR is selected in each bin (Fig. 3a). At a given frequency, the spectrum of NCFs in the frequency–distance domain are modelled using Bessel functions of the first kind, \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

${J}_0( {{\omega }_0,r} )$\end{document}, by grid search over phase velocity. The result is an average dispersion curve for the selected station pairs (Fig. 3b). In the case of subset-1 (Figs S1b and S3), we observed stable phase velocities at 0.16–0.32 Hz to obtain the average dispersion curve depicted by the grey line. We could not extract an average dispersion curve at higher frequencies, probably due to the heterogeneity of the shallower crustal structure.Figure 3.(a) Observed real part of NCFs spectrum binned in the frequency–distance domain. (b) Estimated average phase velocity dispersion curve by fitting the observed coherency and the Bessel function following Prieto et al. (2009). Dots show the best fits of phase velocity as a function of frequency. Light-red line emphasizes the average dispersion curve between 0.16 and 0.32 Hz.Fig. 4 shows a dispersion curve measurement for the station pair JKA15–JKA17. As shown in each of these figures, a strong signal is observed in the chosen window, called the signal window (blue line; Fig. 4a). The window length was selected using the expected minimum and maximum velocity of surface waves (200 m s−1 and 2 km s−1) in our study region. The spectrum of the signal window (blue line; Fig. 4b) clearly shows Bessel-like oscillations that confidently fit the Bessel function's zeros. Branches of phase velocities (Fig. 4c) are indicated for different ‘m’ in Eq. (3). We manually selected a branch ‘m’ that lies within a range of one cycle (a grey area in Fig. 4c) of the reference dispersion curve at frequencies below 0.32 Hz. At the frequencies above, the curve was manually assessed and picked until 1 Hz by considering its smoothness and continuity. The amplitude of oscillations in the spectrum also remains stable up to 1 Hz.Figure 4.Dispersion curve extraction for the JKA15–JKA17 station pair. (a) NCF for full trace (black) and the signal window (blue). (b) Real part of the spectrum for full trace (black) and the signal window (blue). (c) Phase velocity dispersion curves obtained by fitting the zeros of the Bessel function to the spectrum of the signal window, including alternative curves for different ‘m’ in eq. (3). Grey shading area is one cycle (up and down) around the average dispersion curve from 0.16 to 0.32 Hz. Grey line presents the dispersion curve, which is manually picked.The same procedure was undertaken for all station pairs in this study. We used the reference dispersion curve of the respective zone where the ray path of the station pair lies, either in the subset-1, subset-2 or all-pairs (Figs S2–S4). Moreover, if the ray path propagates through different zones, we consider the combination of those references as a guide.We estimated ∼2661 phase velocity dispersion curves collected from NCFs having a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The estimated dispersion curves were used to construct 2-D tomographic maps of Rayleigh wave phase velocity beneath Jakarta for both the 2013–2014 and 2018 networks. We model them in the period domain in which we retrieved their phase velocities at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and 5 s. Fig. 5 depicts the geometry of ray paths and the number of ray paths at the selected periods. The ray paths sample with high density within the city of Jakarta.Figure 5.Geometry of straight ray path distributions at selected periods. The bar plot shows the number of ray paths.3.3.Transdimensional Bayesian seismic tomographyWe used the Bayesian framework to invert the dispersion curves for maps of Rayleigh wave phase velocity for selected periods. The Bayesian framework combines a probability density of a priori realistic Earth model information with a likelihood function as the probability of data to obtain the posterior probability distribution function (PDF) for the model given the observed data. In general, Bayes’ theorem is used to express the posterior distribution as:

$P( {k,{{\boldsymbol{m}}}_k{\mathrm{|}}{\boldsymbol{d}}} )$\end{document} can be explored using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) algorithm to sample the numerator (Malinverno 2002). This ‘transdimensional’ (Trans-D) sampling allows model sampling to occur over a number of model parametrizations that in our case corresponds to a variable number of either cell, in the case of inversion for 2-D maps of phase velocity, or layers in the case of inversions for VS depth profiles.Several studies have shown the successful application of the Trans-D Bayesian method to solve a wide range of inverse problems in seismology and geophysics: ANT (Bodin et al. 2012a), surface wave dispersion and receiver functions (Bodin et al. 
2012b), microtremor (Dettmer et al. 2012), airborne electromagnetic (Hawkins et al. 2018), finite fault inversion (Benavente et al. 2019), global core–mantle boundary tomography (Mousavi et al. 2021), gravity and magnetic (Ghalenoei et al. 2022), among others. For ANT, the McMC is typically implemented and developed to model 2-D phase or group velocity variations with a parametrization using Voronoi cells (Bodin & Sambridge 2009; Bodin et al. 2012a). These were used in studies that apply the Trans-D ANT in various regions, both on local and regional scales (Young et al. 2013; Zulfakriza et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2016; Saygin et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2017).In this tomographic study, we applied the Trans-D Bayesian tree method developed by Hawkins & Sambridge (2015) which uses a tree-based wavelet parametrization, which we henceforth refer to as ‘Trans-D tree’. The Trans-D tree offers flexibility, performance, and efficiency for tomographic imaging problems. The wavelet parametrization based on a tree structure allows a hierarchy of coefficients to represent fine-scale heterogeneity in different resolved parts of the model, which can adapt to the observed data (i.e. ray paths).We worked at each period independently between 1 and 5 s. To begin with, we used linearized inversion using straight rays to converge to an initial solution quickly. The inversion ran for 1000 000 iterations, and the results acted as a reasonable starting point for approximate statistical information that is then used in a non-linear inversion that allows for ray bending.Next, we used non-linear inversion for updating ray paths at each iteration to better account for the physics of surface wave propagation between stations. For the forward model, the Trans-D tree uses the fast marching method (FMM; Rawlinson & Sambridge 2004a, b) to trace the wave fonts for a given velocity model. As we expect strong lateral heterogeneity for shallow crustal structures beneath Jakarta, the FMM is beneficial. The Markov chain sampling method in the Trans-D tree includes multiple chains and Parallel Tampering to explore the model space better and speed up the convergence (Sambridge 2013). For non-linear inversion, we used two parallel chains at each temperature of three steps and attempted to swap information every 25 iterations. We ran 50 000 Markov chain steps for each chain.Lastly, we seeded a new parallel non-linear inversion using the previous parallel non-linear solution. We re-ran another non-linear inversion for 50 000 Markov chain steps with identical sampling parameters. Out of those steps, the first 10 000 iterations are the burn-in samples. We discarded the burn-in samples and used the rest of the iterations to compute the mean model. The chain histories were investigated to indicate whether it has achieved convergence. These 3-steps increase the computational time considerably but result in improved recovery of velocity structure.3.4.Transdimensional 1-D shear wave inversionFinally, dispersion curves at each of a set of regularly spaced gridpoints are assembled from the 2-D Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps and inverted to obtain 1-D VS depth profiles. For each curve, the sample points over adjacent period values are interpolated. The dispersion curves were inverted using a Trans-D Bayesian framework, with the details of the method given in Bodin et al. (2012b) and Dreiling & Tilmann (2019). In concept, the transdimensional Bayesian approach for VS inversion is equivalent to that used in the tomographic inversion for phase velocity described above but uses a variable number of horizontal, constant velocity layers to parametrize the VS depth profile, instead of 2-D wavelets to parametrize the lateral variation of phase velocity.For the inversion, we use an uninformative (i.e. uniform) prior for model parameters, with a depth range for the interfaces from the surface to 4 km, a maximum of 6 layers, and VS from 0 to 3 km s−1. For the forward model, the dispersion curves are computed with the routine from Herrmann (2013). Although dispersion data is most sensitive to VS, we demonstrate that it is also sensitive to a significant degree to P-wave velocity (VP) and mass density (ρ) (see Fig. S8), especially for cases of a shallow crust with low velocity. Therefore, we calculated VP and ρ inside each layer using the VS-to-VP and VP-to-ρ scaling relationships (Brocher 2005):

Each chain performed 3 million iterations, with a 1:1 ratio for the burn-in and exploration phase. If some chains failed to converge, the chains would be discarded as outliers. The final posterior distributions collect 100 000 models from the exploration phase, excluding outlier chains (Dreiling et al. 2020). We took the mean over the final posterior distributions for the preferred VS depth profile.

DATA AND METHODS

This study combines two temporary seismic networks that were deployed separately: (1) the 2013–2014 network (see Saygin et al. 2016) and (2) the 2018 network. Both networks used three-component broad-band seismometers (Trillium Compact) and digitizers built by the Australian National University. The instruments were installed temporarily in schools, on concrete slab floors, throughout the city with a spacing of 3–5 km (Fig. 1). The 2013–2014 network covered most of the area within Jakarta's city limits with 96 stations. This network has been used in earlier studies to model the Jakarta Basin's geometry (Saygin et al. 2016; 2017; Cipta et al. 2018a). For this study, in 2018, we deployed another seismic network aiming mainly to expand the coverage outside Jakarta to reveal the extent of the sedimentary basin. This 2018 deployment comprised 143 stations where the 30 seismometers were maintained and redeployed in five phases with at least one month of recording at each site (Ry et al. 2019).

We used seismic ambient noise tomography (ANT) to the data of both seismic networks. The data analysis follows this workflow: (1) we derived the noise correlation function of Rayleigh wave from the cross-correlation of vertical seismograms, (2) we estimated the phase velocity dispersion curve at each interstation midpoint from the real part of the NCF's spectrum, (3) we invert these dispersion curves to map 2-D Rayleigh wave velocity tomograms at various periods and (4) we invert dispersion curves for VS depth profiles on a set of the regularly spaced gridpoints covering the study area and then interpolate these to obtain a pseudo-3-D VS model of the Jakarta Basin.

3.1.Noise correlation functionsTo assess surface waves, the empirical Green's function (GF) between two stations is often derived by cross-correlating their background ambient noise (Shapiro & Campillo 2004). Various processing workflows for this have been suggested, such as in Yao et al. (2006), Bensen et al. (2007) and Seats et al. (2012). Bensen et al. (2007), suggest the calculation of daily seismogram cross-correlations (correlograms); then, the daily correlograms over weeks, months, or years are stacked together to enhance the emergence of the surface wave signal. These stacked correlograms are usually called a noise correlation function (NCF). Meanwhile, Seats et al. (2012) propose shorter and overlapping time windows for cross-correlation and stacking to enhance the signal in NCF. They note that this approach benefits ambient seismic studies with limited recording duration and high levels of discontinuous local noise.In this study, we used the HiPerSeis package (Hassan et al. 2020) to obtain Rayleigh wave NCFs. The use of HiPerSeis, which is optimized for high-performance computing clusters and therefore allows for rapid assessment of processed results, allowed us to test many different choices for processing options and parameters (Hejrani et al. 2020). Prior to the calculation of NCFs, we checked the data for possible GPS clock drifts and other timing errors. Such problems are common in seismic instruments for various reasons and authors have taken different approaches to identify or correct for such errors (see, e.g. Hejrani et al. 2015, 2017, 2020; Hable et al. 2018). Using functionalities of HiPerSeis (Gorbatov et al. 2020), we assessed the GPS clock stability at a daily level for each station and we did not observe any drifts in the clocks.We briefly describe our workflow to calculate NCFs as follows. The vertical seismograms for all stations in miniseed format were converted to ASDF. The data in the time domain was resampled to 10 Hz, then means and trends were removed. Bandpass filtering was performed between 0.02 and 4 Hz. The data was normalized in the time domain so that it is approximately distributed as a standard normal distribution (e.g. Hawkins & Sambridge 2019). Spectral whitening was applied with a window frequency of 0.02 Hz. The vertical seismograms for all available station pairs were cross-correlated in one-hour-long segments with 75 per cent overlap (Seats et al. 2012). The results were stacked linearly over the entire recording period.To assess the excitation of surface waves, we visualize two sets of NCFs in Fig. 2, one from our 2018 deployment (Fig. 2a) and the other from the 2013 to 2014 deployment (Fig. 2b). We term the waves propagating towards the reference station as causal and away from the station as acausal (the opposite convention to Saygin et al. 2016). It can be observed that the NCFs are asymmetrical and emerge more clearly in the acausal part of the correlograms. Generally, the NCF is a good approximation to GF when the noise sources are randomly but homogenously distributed (Wapenaar et al. 2005; Snieder 2007). However, in many real data applications, the background seismic energy is not evenly distributed as it depends on the coupling between ocean waves and coastlines. In this study area, the asymmetrical NCFs strongly suggest a non-homogenous distribution of the ambient noise sources at the frequencies of interest. The most robust energy appears in the acausal part of the NCFs of the north reference stations, indicating that the source of noise is dominantly in the north, that is an embayment of the Java Sea. Other studies of ambient noise in the central and western part of Java (Zulfakriza et al. 2014; Pranata et al. 2020; Rosalia et al. 2020; Yudistira et al. 2021) also illustrate this dominance of the ambient seismic noise wavefield by sources in the Java Sea.Figure 2.Retrieved Green's functions of Rayleigh waves between the reference stations: (a) JK087 (the 2018 network), (b) JKA17 (the 2013–2014 network) and others. Correlograms were filtered between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz for plotting. Red and green lines show group velocities of 2 and 0.25 km s−1, respectively. Inset map shows the location of the reference source stations (yellow stars) and receiver stations (triangles).Saygin et al. (2016) also noted the asymmetric character of the NCFs in the Jakarta Basin, particularly along paths with nearly SN orientation, and interpreted this asymmetry as reflecting fundamental mode propagation in the SN direction (causal using our convention in Fig. 2), and 1st order overtone propagation in the NS direction (acausal in Fig. 2), based on the higher group velocity of the latter. We had difficulty following this interpretation for two reasons: (1) The arrival in the acausal part of the NCF is always at least as pronounced as that in the causal part and (2) The arrival in the causal part of the NCF vanishes for paths that extend outside the basin (as seen in the upper right portion of Fig. 2a). While several other studies have noted the presence of overtones in NCFs recorded in sedimentary basins (Savage et al. 2013; Boué et al. 2016), and in some cases, the 1st overtone can be dominant (Rivet et al. 2015), we know of no other case where fundamental and 1st overtone are so clearly separated into causal and acausal parts of the NCF due to anisotropic noise.In developing an alternative interpretation, we note that the fundamental change in character between the causal and acausal parts of the Jakarta Basin NCFs is one of frequency content: the causal part (SN propagation in our convention) always involves higher frequencies than the acausal part. This is illustrated in Fig. S1, where we have used the same data from Fig 2(a) and displayed separately the spectra associated with the causal and acausal parts. The signal in the acausal part of the NCF is confined to frequencies below 0.4 Hz, while the causal part contains energy in the range 0.5–2 Hz. We speculate that, for reasons we have yet to ascertain, the constructive interference of the ambient noise to produce a GF is more effective for SN (causal) propagation in the higher frequency band (up to 2 Hz), and more effective for NS (acausal) propagation in the lower frequency band. The much lower apparent velocity of the causal arrival with respect to the acausal arrivals could simply be because the causal arrivals correspond to the slower, high-frequency component of the fundamental mode GF, while the acausal arrivals correspond to the faster, low-frequency component of the fundamental mode GF.This interpretation is illustrated in Figs S2(a) and (b), where we compare synthetics that include only the fundamental mode with those that include both fundamental and 1st overtone, calculated for a VS profile near the centre of the stations used in the record section of Fig. S1. We follow Boué et al. (2016) in using a surface point source excitation (Harkrider & Anderson 1966) to calculate fundamental and 1st overtone spectra (Fig. S2c), and high-pass filter the causal part of the synthetics at 0.5 Hz, while the acausal part is low-passed filtered at 0.4 Hz. While the presence of the 1st overtone has some influence on the waveforms in both causal and acausal parts (Fig. S2b), the dominance of the fundamental mode is reflected in the similarity of waveforms in Figs S2(a) and (b), and in the spectra of Fig. S2(c). We also note that the phase velocity curves of fundamental and overtone are well separated, with no osculation. While we have only established self-consistency and not necessarily veracity of our interpretation that the acausal and causal parts of the NCF are both mainly associated with the fundamental mode, we believe this interpretation is as viable as the fundamental versus 1st overtone interpretation of Saygin et al. (2016). Therefore, we assume in what follows that both causal and acausal parts of our NCFs can be interpreted as reflecting the fundamental mode only. We leave the resolution of how much (or how little) the 1st overtone contributes to our NCFs to future work.

Noise correlation functions

To assess surface waves, the empirical Green's function (GF) between two stations is often derived by cross-correlating their background ambient noise (Shapiro & Campillo 2004). Various processing workflows for this have been suggested, such as in Yao et al. (2006), Bensen et al. (2007) and Seats et al. (2012). Bensen et al. (2007), suggest the calculation of daily seismogram cross-correlations (correlograms); then, the daily correlograms over weeks, months, or years are stacked together to enhance the emergence of the surface wave signal. These stacked correlograms are usually called a noise correlation function (NCF). Meanwhile, Seats et al. (2012) propose shorter and overlapping time windows for cross-correlation and stacking to enhance the signal in NCF. They note that this approach benefits ambient seismic studies with limited recording duration and high levels of discontinuous local noise.

In this study, we used the HiPerSeis package (Hassan et al. 2020) to obtain Rayleigh wave NCFs. The use of HiPerSeis, which is optimized for high-performance computing clusters and therefore allows for rapid assessment of processed results, allowed us to test many different choices for processing options and parameters (Hejrani et al. 2020). Prior to the calculation of NCFs, we checked the data for possible GPS clock drifts and other timing errors. Such problems are common in seismic instruments for various reasons and authors have taken different approaches to identify or correct for such errors (see, e.g. Hejrani et al. 2015, 2017, 2020; Hable et al. 2018). Using functionalities of HiPerSeis (Gorbatov et al. 2020), we assessed the GPS clock stability at a daily level for each station and we did not observe any drifts in the clocks.

We briefly describe our workflow to calculate NCFs as follows. The vertical seismograms for all stations in miniseed format were converted to ASDF. The data in the time domain was resampled to 10 Hz, then means and trends were removed. Bandpass filtering was performed between 0.02 and 4 Hz. The data was normalized in the time domain so that it is approximately distributed as a standard normal distribution (e.g. Hawkins & Sambridge 2019). Spectral whitening was applied with a window frequency of 0.02 Hz. The vertical seismograms for all available station pairs were cross-correlated in one-hour-long segments with 75 per cent overlap (Seats et al. 2012). The results were stacked linearly over the entire recording period.

To assess the excitation of surface waves, we visualize two sets of NCFs in Fig. 2, one from our 2018 deployment (Fig. 2a) and the other from the 2013 to 2014 deployment (Fig. 2b). We term the waves propagating towards the reference station as causal and away from the station as acausal (the opposite convention to Saygin et al. 2016). It can be observed that the NCFs are asymmetrical and emerge more clearly in the acausal part of the correlograms. Generally, the NCF is a good approximation to GF when the noise sources are randomly but homogenously distributed (Wapenaar et al. 2005; Snieder 2007). However, in many real data applications, the background seismic energy is not evenly distributed as it depends on the coupling between ocean waves and coastlines. In this study area, the asymmetrical NCFs strongly suggest a non-homogenous distribution of the ambient noise sources at the frequencies of interest. The most robust energy appears in the acausal part of the NCFs of the north reference stations, indicating that the source of noise is dominantly in the north, that is an embayment of the Java Sea. Other studies of ambient noise in the central and western part of Java (Zulfakriza et al. 2014; Pranata et al. 2020; Rosalia et al. 2020; Yudistira et al. 2021) also illustrate this dominance of the ambient seismic noise wavefield by sources in the Java Sea.

Retrieved Green's functions of Rayleigh waves between the reference stations: (a) JK087 (the 2018 network), (b) JKA17 (the 2013–2014 network) and others. Correlograms were filtered between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz for plotting. Red and green lines show group velocities of 2 and 0.25 km s−1, respectively. Inset map shows the location of the reference source stations (yellow stars) and receiver stations (triangles).

Saygin et al. (2016) also noted the asymmetric character of the NCFs in the Jakarta Basin, particularly along paths with nearly SN orientation, and interpreted this asymmetry as reflecting fundamental mode propagation in the SN direction (causal using our convention in Fig. 2), and 1st order overtone propagation in the NS direction (acausal in Fig. 2), based on the higher group velocity of the latter. We had difficulty following this interpretation for two reasons: (1) The arrival in the acausal part of the NCF is always at least as pronounced as that in the causal part and (2) The arrival in the causal part of the NCF vanishes for paths that extend outside the basin (as seen in the upper right portion of Fig. 2a). While several other studies have noted the presence of overtones in NCFs recorded in sedimentary basins (Savage et al. 2013; Boué et al. 2016), and in some cases, the 1st overtone can be dominant (Rivet et al. 2015), we know of no other case where fundamental and 1st overtone are so clearly separated into causal and acausal parts of the NCF due to anisotropic noise.

In developing an alternative interpretation, we note that the fundamental change in character between the causal and acausal parts of the Jakarta Basin NCFs is one of frequency content: the causal part (SN propagation in our convention) always involves higher frequencies than the acausal part. This is illustrated in Fig. S1, where we have used the same data from Fig 2(a) and displayed separately the spectra associated with the causal and acausal parts. The signal in the acausal part of the NCF is confined to frequencies below 0.4 Hz, while the causal part contains energy in the range 0.5–2 Hz. We speculate that, for reasons we have yet to ascertain, the constructive interference of the ambient noise to produce a GF is more effective for SN (causal) propagation in the higher frequency band (up to 2 Hz), and more effective for NS (acausal) propagation in the lower frequency band. The much lower apparent velocity of the causal arrival with respect to the acausal arrivals could simply be because the causal arrivals correspond to the slower, high-frequency component of the fundamental mode GF, while the acausal arrivals correspond to the faster, low-frequency component of the fundamental mode GF.

This interpretation is illustrated in Figs S2(a) and (b), where we compare synthetics that include only the fundamental mode with those that include both fundamental and 1st overtone, calculated for a VS profile near the centre of the stations used in the record section of Fig. S1. We follow Boué et al. (2016) in using a surface point source excitation (Harkrider & Anderson 1966) to calculate fundamental and 1st overtone spectra (Fig. S2c), and high-pass filter the causal part of the synthetics at 0.5 Hz, while the acausal part is low-passed filtered at 0.4 Hz. While the presence of the 1st overtone has some influence on the waveforms in both causal and acausal parts (Fig. S2b), the dominance of the fundamental mode is reflected in the similarity of waveforms in Figs S2(a) and (b), and in the spectra of Fig. S2(c). We also note that the phase velocity curves of fundamental and overtone are well separated, with no osculation. While we have only established self-consistency and not necessarily veracity of our interpretation that the acausal and causal parts of the NCF are both mainly associated with the fundamental mode, we believe this interpretation is as viable as the fundamental versus 1st overtone interpretation of Saygin et al. (2016). Therefore, we assume in what follows that both causal and acausal parts of our NCFs can be interpreted as reflecting the fundamental mode only. We leave the resolution of how much (or how little) the 1st overtone contributes to our NCFs to future work.

Missed or extra zeros results in jumps or discontinuities in the range of phase velocities branches obtained from eq. (3) (Hejrani et al. 2020).In consequence, Prieto et al. (2009) suggested a way to estimate an average phase velocity dispersion curve beneath an array. They demonstrated this by measuring the coherency in a frequency–distance domain between the real part of all NCFs spectrum and the Bessel function. Both approaches by Ekström et al. (2009) and Prieto et al. (2009) assess phase velocity from the relation between zero crossings of the NCF spectrum and the Bessel function. Accordingly, Hejrani et al. (2020). combined those to develop a two-stage semi-automatic routine to extract dispersion curves efficiently.We measured phase velocity dispersion curves following Hejrani et al. (2020), who did this in two stages. First, an average dispersion curve was calculated beneath an array (or a subarray) following Prieto et al. (2009). Given that the shallow lithologies in our study area are relatively complex and we attempted to obtain dispersion curves at frequencies up to 1 Hz, we estimated multiple average dispersion curves for three subsets of stations (see Fig. S3). Secondly, dispersion curves were picked manually among the branches identified with eqs (2) and (3) (Ekström et al. 2009) following these rules: (1) to select the correct branch of dispersion curve among the ones generated in eq. (3) for various values of m, we used our average dispersion curve as a guide at low frequencies. We selected a branch that is within one cycle (up and down) of the reference dispersion curve. The lowest frequency we consider was defined by the longest wavelength that could be detected given the inter-station distance. (2) We then manually assessed the selected branch to higher frequencies, up to 1 Hz. We considered jumps and drops in the dispersion curves due to missing or extra zeros in the spectrum as well as the amplitude of the oscillations in the spectrum.To generate average dispersion curves, we considered three subsets of stations, named subset-1, subset-2 and all-pairs, where subsets 1 and 2 are sitting in different geological settings (see Fig. S3). Following Prieto et al. (2009), the station pairs in each subset were binned based on their interstation distance (250 meters bins), and the one with the highest SNR is selected in each bin (Fig. 3a). At a given frequency, the spectrum of NCFs in the frequency–distance domain are modelled using Bessel functions of the first kind, \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In the case of subset-1 (Figs S1b and S3), we observed stable phase velocities at 0.16–0.32 Hz to obtain the average dispersion curve depicted by the grey line. We could not extract an average dispersion curve at higher frequencies, probably due to the heterogeneity of the shallower crustal structure.Figure 3.(a) Observed real part of NCFs spectrum binned in the frequency–distance domain. (b) Estimated average phase velocity dispersion curve by fitting the observed coherency and the Bessel function following Prieto et al. (2009). Dots show the best fits of phase velocity as a function of frequency. Light-red line emphasizes the average dispersion curve between 0.16 and 0.32 Hz.Fig. 4 shows a dispersion curve measurement for the station pair JKA15–JKA17. As shown in each of these figures, a strong signal is observed in the chosen window, called the signal window (blue line; Fig. 4a). The window length was selected using the expected minimum and maximum velocity of surface waves (200 m s−1 and 2 km s−1) in our study region. The spectrum of the signal window (blue line; Fig. 4b) clearly shows Bessel-like oscillations that confidently fit the Bessel function's zeros. Branches of phase velocities (Fig. 4c) are indicated for different ‘m’ in Eq. (3). We manually selected a branch ‘m’ that lies within a range of one cycle (a grey area in Fig. 4c) of the reference dispersion curve at frequencies below 0.32 Hz. At the frequencies above, the curve was manually assessed and picked until 1 Hz by considering its smoothness and continuity. The amplitude of oscillations in the spectrum also remains stable up to 1 Hz.Figure 4.Dispersion curve extraction for the JKA15–JKA17 station pair.

Grey line presents the dispersion curve, which is manually picked.The same procedure was undertaken for all station pairs in this study. We used the reference dispersion curve of the respective zone where the ray path of the station pair lies, either in the subset-1, subset-2 or all-pairs (Figs S2–S4). Moreover, if the ray path propagates through different zones, we consider the combination of those references as a guide.We estimated ∼2661 phase velocity dispersion curves collected from NCFs having a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The estimated dispersion curves were used to construct 2-D tomographic maps of Rayleigh wave phase velocity beneath Jakarta for both the 2013–2014 and 2018 networks. We model them in the period domain in which we retrieved their phase velocities at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and 5 s.

We model them in the period domain in which we retrieved their phase velocities at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and 5 s. Fig. 5 depicts the geometry of ray paths and the number of ray paths at the selected periods. The ray paths sample with high density within the city of Jakarta.

3.3.Transdimensional Bayesian seismic tomographyWe used the Bayesian framework to invert the dispersion curves for maps of Rayleigh wave phase velocity for selected periods. The Bayesian framework combines a probability density of a priori realistic Earth model information with a likelihood function as the probability of data to obtain the posterior probability distribution function (PDF) for the model given the observed data. In general, Bayes’ theorem is used to express the posterior distribution as:

$P( {k,{{\boldsymbol{m}}}_k{\mathrm{|}}{\boldsymbol{d}}} )$\end{document} can be explored using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) algorithm to sample the numerator (Malinverno 2002). This ‘transdimensional’ (Trans-D) sampling allows model sampling to occur over a number of model parametrizations that in our case corresponds to a variable number of either cell, in the case of inversion for 2-D maps of phase velocity, or layers in the case of inversions for VS depth profiles.Several studies have shown the successful application of the Trans-D Bayesian method to solve a wide range of inverse problems in seismology and geophysics: ANT (Bodin et al. 2012a), surface wave dispersion and receiver functions (Bodin et al. 
2012b), microtremor (Dettmer et al. 2012), airborne electromagnetic (Hawkins et al. 2018), finite fault inversion (Benavente et al. 2019), global core–mantle boundary tomography (Mousavi et al. 2021), gravity and magnetic (Ghalenoei et al. 2022), among others. For ANT, the McMC is typically implemented and developed to model 2-D phase or group velocity variations with a parametrization using Voronoi cells (Bodin & Sambridge 2009; Bodin et al. 2012a). These were used in studies that apply the Trans-D ANT in various regions, both on local and regional scales (Young et al. 2013; Zulfakriza et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2016; Saygin et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2017).In this tomographic study, we applied the Trans-D Bayesian tree method developed by Hawkins & Sambridge (2015) which uses a tree-based wavelet parametrization, which we henceforth refer to as ‘Trans-D tree’. The Trans-D tree offers flexibility, performance, and efficiency for tomographic imaging problems. The wavelet parametrization based on a tree structure allows a hierarchy of coefficients to represent fine-scale heterogeneity in different resolved parts of the model, which can adapt to the observed data (i.e. ray paths).We worked at each period independently between 1 and 5 s. To begin with, we used linearized inversion using straight rays to converge to an initial solution quickly. The inversion ran for 1000 000 iterations, and the results acted as a reasonable starting point for approximate statistical information that is then used in a non-linear inversion that allows for ray bending.Next, we used non-linear inversion for updating ray paths at each iteration to better account for the physics of surface wave propagation between stations. For the forward model, the Trans-D tree uses the fast marching method (FMM; Rawlinson & Sambridge 2004a, b) to trace the wave fonts for a given velocity model. As we expect strong lateral heterogeneity for shallow crustal structures beneath Jakarta, the FMM is beneficial. The Markov chain sampling method in the Trans-D tree includes multiple chains and Parallel Tampering to explore the model space better and speed up the convergence (Sambridge 2013). For non-linear inversion, we used two parallel chains at each temperature of three steps and attempted to swap information every 25 iterations. We ran 50 000 Markov chain steps for each chain.Lastly, we seeded a new parallel non-linear inversion using the previous parallel non-linear solution. We re-ran another non-linear inversion for 50 000 Markov chain steps with identical sampling parameters. Out of those steps, the first 10 000 iterations are the burn-in samples. We discarded the burn-in samples and used the rest of the iterations to compute the mean model. The chain histories were investigated to indicate whether it has achieved convergence. These 3-steps increase the computational time considerably but result in improved recovery of velocity structure.

3.4.Transdimensional 1-D shear wave inversionFinally, dispersion curves at each of a set of regularly spaced gridpoints are assembled from the 2-D Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps and inverted to obtain 1-D VS depth profiles. For each curve, the sample points over adjacent period values are interpolated. The dispersion curves were inverted using a Trans-D Bayesian framework, with the details of the method given in Bodin et al. (2012b) and Dreiling & Tilmann (2019). In concept, the transdimensional Bayesian approach for VS inversion is equivalent to that used in the tomographic inversion for phase velocity described above but uses a variable number of horizontal, constant velocity layers to parametrize the VS depth profile, instead of 2-D wavelets to parametrize the lateral variation of phase velocity.For the inversion, we use an uninformative (i.e. uniform) prior for model parameters, with a depth range for the interfaces from the surface to 4 km, a maximum of 6 layers, and VS from 0 to 3 km s−1. For the forward model, the dispersion curves are computed with the routine from Herrmann (2013). Although dispersion data is most sensitive to VS, we demonstrate that it is also sensitive to a significant degree to P-wave velocity (VP) and mass density (ρ) (see Fig. S8), especially for cases of a shallow crust with low velocity. Therefore, we calculated VP and ρ inside each layer using the VS-to-VP and VP-to-ρ scaling relationships (Brocher 2005):

Each chain performed 3 million iterations, with a 1:1 ratio for the burn-in and exploration phase. If some chains failed to converge, the chains would be discarded as outliers. The final posterior distributions collect 100 000 models from the exploration phase, excluding outlier chains (Dreiling et al. 2020). We took the mean over the final posterior distributions for the preferred VS depth profile.

Transdimensional 1-D shear wave inversion

Finally, dispersion curves at each of a set of regularly spaced gridpoints are assembled from the 2-D Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps and inverted to obtain 1-D VS depth profiles. For each curve, the sample points over adjacent period values are interpolated.

These relations are valid for VS ≤ 4.5 km s−1 (eq. 7) and for 1.5 ≤ VP ≤ 6.1 km s−1 (eq. 8).

The inversion was performed with 24 chains to explore multiple independent parameter spaces. Each chain performed 3 million iterations, with a 1:1 ratio for the burn-in and exploration phase. If some chains failed to converge, the chains would be discarded as outliers. The final posterior distributions collect 100 000 models from the exploration phase, excluding outlier chains (Dreiling et al. 2020). We took the mean over the final posterior distributions for the preferred VS depth profile.

4.RESULTSFig. 6 depicts the Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps from periods 1 to 5 s. The corresponding Markov chain histories and uncertainty of each map are given in Fig. 7. The Markov chain histories appear ‘flat’, suggesting a convergence of the Markov chains (Hawkins & Sambridge 2015).Figure 6.Mean phase velocity tomograms of fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave from Trans-D tree Bayesian inversion for periods from 1 to 5 s.

(a) Markov chain histories for the negative logarithm of the likelihood in the last 50 000 steps. (b) Maps of standard deviation of the tomograms representing uncertainties. (c) Residual histograms of the mean phase velocity tomograms.We expect the Rayleigh waves at periods below 2 s to be most sensitive to structure at shallow depth, approximately <1 km, due to the low velocity of sediments. Low velocities of Rayleigh wave (250–500 m s−1) appear to cover most of Jakarta, which we presume corresponds to the pervasive shallow sedimentary cover reflected in surface geology maps. The low velocity extends to the western and eastern areas outside of Jakarta, to Tangerang and Bekasi, respectively. Towards the northeast, the low velocity exhibits a more robust anomaly, and it is consistent through longer periods. Meanwhile, toward the south (Depok and Bogor), Rayleigh wave velocities are gradually increasing. This suggests that the depth of the Jakarta Basin decreases southward. South of latitude 6.3°S, a contrast between low and high velocity can be observed. We presume this may relate to the transition of stratigraphy formations. Nevertheless, as shown for longer periods of 4 and 5 s, the velocity coverage seems smooth throughout the study area, suggesting that the deeper structure is more homogenous.We extracted over 442 dispersion curves from the phase velocity tomograms at interpolated gridpoints (Fig. 8) with ∼2 km spacing, at which inversions for VS depth profiles are performed. Fig. 9 gives an example of the inverted dispersion curves for L211 and L224. The quality of data fits for those examples is representative of the other points, in particular showing that the misfit between observed and calculated dispersion curves of 24 chains, in general, is low. The procedure was conducted for all gridpoints in Fig. 8. The VS profiles (Fig. 9) obtained at each gridpoint were interpolated to constitute a pseudo-3-D model of VS structure in the Jakarta Basin.Figure 8.Grid locations (green dots) where dispersion curves are extracted from phase velocity maps and inverted for VS depth profiles.

We expect the Rayleigh waves at periods below 2 s to be most sensitive to structure at shallow depth, approximately <1 km, due to the low velocity of sediments.

We extracted over 442 dispersion curves from the phase velocity tomograms at interpolated gridpoints (Fig. 8) with ∼2 km spacing, at which inversions for VS depth profiles are performed. Fig. 9 gives an example of the inverted dispersion curves for L211 and L224. The quality of data fits for those examples is representative of the other points, in particular showing that the misfit between observed and calculated dispersion curves of 24 chains, in general, is low. The procedure was conducted for all gridpoints in Fig. 8. The VS profiles (Fig. 9) obtained at each gridpoint were interpolated to constitute a pseudo-3-D model of VS structure in the Jakarta Basin.

5.DISCUSSIONThe distribution of the sediment layers in the Jakarta Basin is identified from a pseudo-3-D shear-wave velocity model we developed in this study. Due to the vertical resolution (see Fig. S9), we only interpret the results down to a depth of 1.5 km. The lateral distributions of VS structure beneath Greater Jakarta between depths 100 m and 1.5 km are shown in Fig. 10, while Fig. 11 depicts the cross-sections of VS vertical profiles across the area. Fig. 10 shows that in the northern part of Jakarta Basin, the phase velocity inversion in the shallowest layers resolves VS as low as 250 m s−1 (VS is probably even lower near the surface, in fine-scale layering that is not well resolved (see Cipta et al. 2018a; Ridwan et al. 2019). VS as low as 500 m s−1 persists to depths as great as 500 m, particularly in the northeast. Farther to the south, the velocity increases more rapidly with depth, suggesting that the southern edge of the basin has been at least partially imaged.Figure 10.Map slices of VS across Greater Jakarta from the inversion of phase velocity dispersion curves for depths between 100 m and 1.5 km.Figure 11.Cross-sections of VS vertical profiles (A, B, C, D and E) beneath Greater Jakarta for selected five lines shown in Fig. 8. Black horizontal bars represent interfaces depth resulting from Trans-D inversion.Superposed on the VS cross sections in Fig. 11 are horizontal bars indicating the depth of peaks in the posterior PDFs for interface depth. The shallowest of these appear to define an approximately continuous surface, everywhere but in the southernmost part of the basin, and appears to divide the basin into a shallow (depth < 300 m) layer with VS in the interval 250–500 m s−1, from a deeper layer (200–750 m depth range) having VS in the interval 500–800 m s−1. In Fig. 12, where we compare the cross-section B with a section from Fachri et al. (2002) derived from borehole logs, we have designated these layers as ‘Basin Fill 1″ and ‘Basin Fill 2″, respectively. The peaks in interface probability also appear to define an approximately continuous surface at a depth that varies in the depth range between 750 and 1000 m and coincides with an increase in velocity to 1000 m s−1 or greater. We designate this as ‘Basement’ (Fig. 12b).Figure 12.Cross-section (cs) of the Jakarta Basin from south to north. (a) Geological cs derived from borehole data given in Fachri et al. (2002) (modified from Fig. 6b). (b) B cs of VS model from Fig. 11 and the inferred thrust fault (red-dashed line).The base of the layer Basin Fill 1 and its depth variation (Figs 12 and 13) correspond well with the hydrological basement (Fachri et al. 2002) interpreted based on borehole data. They identify this interface as the base of Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments that fill the shallow part of much of the Jakarta Basin. The layer we refer to as Basin Fill 2 was identified by Fachri et al. (2002) as Late Miocene sediments of low permeability, hence its designation as the hydrological basement. However, none of those boreholes described penetrate much below the Basin Fill 2 layer, and as far as we are aware, no borehole data provide a constraint on the lithology below this layer. We refer to the apparent, abrupt increase in VS at the base of layer Basin Fill 2 as Basement, having VS of greater than 1000 m s−1. It seems likely that this seismological basement may be associated with widespread carbonate deposition in the Java Sea region that occurred in the early Miocene (Clements & Hall 2007).Figure 13.Spatial map of the basal depth of Basin Fill 1 (Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments) and the inferred offset, tentatively interpreted as thrust faulting (black-dashed line).Inferred from cross-section B as indicated in Fig. 12(b), VS in the shallowmost layer gradually shifts from about 500 to 750 m s−1 at about latitude −6.4° (see Fig. 13). This seems likely to reflect the shift from Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments of layer Basin Fill 1 to Middle Miocene sediments (having VS of 750 m s−1). We highlight this boundary as the edge of Basin Fill 1, although the very shallow layer of Pleistocene–Holocene alluvium dominating the surface geology in the region (Fachri et al. 2002) is unresolvable in this study. Meanwhile, in the southeast (Fig. 11, cross-section E), instead of Basin Fill 1 being replaced by Middle Miocene sediments, cross-section C suggests that layer Basin Fill 2 shallows and replaces layer Basin Fill 1 as the shallowest resolvable layer, which is also consistent with the emergence of Late Miocene sediments near the surface southeast of Jakarta.Finally, we consider the pronounced offset in both the Basement and the interface between Basin Fill 1 and 2 at around latitude −6.3°. This apparent ‘step’ agrees well with the borehole data of Fachri et al. (2002), as indicated in Fig. 12. Although their study seems to imply that this corresponds to normal displacement on a steep, northward dipping, half-graben-like structure, we note that its displacement of the Late Miocene sediments of Basin Fill 2 implies the displacement occurred after extension the Java Sea had ceased in the late Oligocene (Clements & Hall 2007). We offer an alternative interpretation for the basement offset evident in cross section B. We tentatively suggest that the displacement could be the result of thrust movement on a fault dipping southward at a shallower dip, as indicated in Fig. 12(b) and Fig. 13. Such a thrust fault would be consistent with previous suggestions of backarc thrusting in West Java (aka the Baribis Fault) based on geodetic (Koulali et al. 2017), geological (Simandjuntak & Barber 1996; Aribowo et al. 2022) and seismological (Damanik et al. 2021; Widiyantoro et al. 2022) data.There are some limitations in our approach that may lead to ambiguity in our result for the VS structure of the Jakarta Basin. First, we have interpreted our NCFs as containing only fundamental mode Rayleigh wave energy and our analysis did not account for overtones. Although we have argued above that this is a reasonable interpretation, we have not confidently resolved whether the fundamental mode is always dominant, and indeed in the northern part of the basin where velocities are particularly low and the basement is at considerable depth, there may be overtone energy present which we have not accounted for. This may result in some bias in our model (Rivet et al. 2015).Also, because we used a Bayesian method that uses a constant-velocity layer parametrization, our result for any gridpoint can be regarded as the simplest, layered model that fits the data, and a small uncertainty would imply that this simple, layered model fits the data better than other simple, layered models. It may be that our data are equally well fit by a continuous velocity profile, but from the point of view of the parametrization we use, this would be a more complex model, and the parsimony property of Bayesian inversion (Malinverno 2002) would cause such a model to have less weight. Therefore, based on our data alone, it may be difficult to say with confidence that there is no continuous model that fits the data as well as our simple, layered one. On the other hand, the borehole data of Fachri et al. (2002) suggests that the actual velocity structure is indeed layered, and the fact that our result matches the layer depths in the borehole data does give us some confidence that we are retrieving the actual layer depths of the VS profile in the basin.

The distribution of the sediment layers in the Jakarta Basin is identified from a pseudo-3-D shear-wave velocity model we developed in this study. Due to the vertical resolution (see Fig. S9), we only interpret the results down to a depth of 1.5 km. The lateral distributions of VS structure beneath Greater Jakarta between depths 100 m and 1.5 km are shown in Fig. 10, while Fig. 11 depicts the cross-sections of VS vertical profiles across the area. Fig. 10 shows that in the northern part of Jakarta Basin, the phase velocity inversion in the shallowest layers resolves VS as low as 250 m s−1 (VS is probably even lower near the surface, in fine-scale layering that is not well resolved (see Cipta et al. 2018a; Ridwan et al. 2019). VS as low as 500 m s−1 persists to depths as great as 500 m, particularly in the northeast. Farther to the south, the velocity increases more rapidly with depth, suggesting that the southern edge of the basin has been at least partially imaged.

Superposed on the VS cross sections in Fig. 11 are horizontal bars indicating the depth of peaks in the posterior PDFs for interface depth. The shallowest of these appear to define an approximately continuous surface, everywhere but in the southernmost part of the basin, and appears to divide the basin into a shallow (depth < 300 m) layer with VS in the interval 250–500 m s−1, from a deeper layer (200–750 m depth range) having VS in the interval 500–800 m s−1.

(2002) derived from borehole logs, we have designated these layers as ‘Basin Fill 1″ and ‘Basin Fill 2″, respectively. The peaks in interface probability also appear to define an approximately continuous surface at a depth that varies in the depth range between 750 and 1000 m and coincides with an increase in velocity to 1000 m s−1 or greater. We designate this as ‘Basement’ (Fig. 12b).

The base of the layer Basin Fill 1 and its depth variation (Figs 12 and 13) correspond well with the hydrological basement (Fachri et al. 2002) interpreted based on borehole data. They identify this interface as the base of Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments that fill the shallow part of much of the Jakarta Basin.

Inferred from cross-section B as indicated in Fig. 12(b), VS in the shallowmost layer gradually shifts from about 500 to 750 m s−1 at about latitude −6.4° (see Fig. 13). This seems likely to reflect the shift from Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments of layer Basin Fill 1 to Middle Miocene sediments (having VS of 750 m s−1).

6.CONCLUSIONWe developed a 3-D shear-wave velocity model of the Jakarta Basin covering Jakarta and its adjacent areas of Greater Jakarta. We conducted a 2-stage Trans-D Bayesian inversion of Rayleigh wave dispersion curves derived from seismic noise. First, we applied tomography and constructed 2-D phase velocity maps for periods 1–5 s. Then, we invert these tomographic maps into 1-D depth profiles of shear-wave velocity. And finally, these profiles at gridpoints of ∼2 km spacing were interpolated to constitute a pseudo-3-D VS model.The model reveals the Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments gradually thickening from south to north, reaching about 350 m below central Jakarta. The edge of this geologically young basin fill is distinct along the south, being replaced by Middle Miocene sediments. Meanwhile, the designated seismological basement, i.e. the base of the Miocene sediments, is more profound, ranging between 750 and 1000 m. Furthermore, we resolve an apparent offset across south Jakarta, which we tentatively interpret as resulting from thrust displacement on a southward-dipping fault, which may be related to the western segment of the Baribis Fault. While this interpretation is tentative, the potential implications for seismic risk in Jakarta are so substantial that we believe it merits further investigation.To our knowledge, the earthquake hazard and risk assessments of Greater Jakarta (Irsyam et al. 2020) are underestimated and still developing since they account for neither the basin's geometry nor the western Baribis Fault. We recommend further work on a localized seismic hazard assessment for Jakarta to account for these potentially significant effects. The 3-D model of the Jakarta basin we developed in this study is suitable for simulation to appraise basin effects on ground motion during earthquake scenarios and will likely result in seismic amplification (see, e.g. Cipta et al. 2018b).
