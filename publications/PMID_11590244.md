Cadherins are major cell-cell adhesion proteins whose cytoplasmic domains bind 
to catenin proteins. Strong intercellular adhesion depends on linkage of the 
cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton via alpha-catenin. To date, 
it is not clear how different cell types achieve the variable strength of 
cell-cell adhesion clearly needed in a multicellular organism. Here, we report 
the cloning and molecular characterization of alphaT(testis)-catenin, a novel 
human cDNA encoding a protein with homology to both human 
alphaE(epithelial)-catenin and alphaN(neural)-catenin. Although originally 
discovered in testis, alphaT-catenin is expressed in other tissues, the highest 
levels being observed in heart. Immunohistochemical analysis showed human 
alphaT-catenin localization at intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes and in 
peritubular myoid cells of testis. In cells transfected with alphaT-catenin 
cDNA, interaction with beta-catenin was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. 
Transfection of alpha-catenin-deficient colon carcinoma cells recruited 
E-cadherin and beta-catenin to cell-cell contacts and functional 
cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion was restored in this way. Moreover, 
compaction of these cells was at least as prominent as in the case of cells 
expressing endogenous alphaE-catenin. We propose that alphaT-catenin is 
necessary for the formation of stretch-resistant cell-cell adhesion complexes, 
in particular, muscle cells.
