Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein/thrombospondin 5 (COMP/TSP5) is a major 
component of the extracellular matrix of the musculoskeletal system. Although 
COMP/TSP5 abnormalities are associated with several pathological conditions, its 
normal function remains unclear. This study was undertaken to delineate the 
function(s) of COMP/TSP5 in cartilage, especially regarding its interaction with 
chondrocytes. We show that COMP/TSP5 can support chondrocyte attachment and that 
the RGD sequence in COMP/TSP5 and the integrin receptors alpha5beta1 and 
alphaVbeta3 on the chondrocytes are involved in mediating this attachment. The 
interactions of COMP/TSP5 with the integrins are dependent on COMP/TSP5 
conformation. Chondrocyte attachment to COMP/TSP5 in the calcium-replete 
conformation was inhibited by function-blocking integrin alpha5 and beta1 
antibodies, suggesting the involvement of the alpha5beta1 integrin. Under this 
condition, a function-blocking antibody against alphaVbeta3 did not have any 
effect on cell attachment. On the other hand, chondrocyte attachment to reduced 
COMP/TSP5 was instead sensitive to alphaVbeta3 function-blocking antibodies, 
suggesting that COMP/TSP5 mediates attachment through chondrocyte alphaVbeta3 
integrin under this condition. Cell attachment to reduced COMP/TSP5 was not 
inhibited by beta1 antibodies. These data indicate that COMP/TSP5 in different 
conformations can utilize different integrin receptors. These results are the 
first to demonstrate that COMP/TSP5 can mediate chondrocyte attachment through 
interactions with integrins. Through these interactions, COMP/TSP5 may be able 
to regulate cellular activities and respond to environment in the surrounding 
cartilage matrix.

Abstract

Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein/thrombospondin 5 (COMP/TSP5) is a major component of the extracellular matrix of the musculoskeletal system. Although COMP/TSP5 abnormalities are associated with several pathological conditions, its normal function remains unclear. This study was undertaken to delineate the function(s) of COMP/TSP5 in cartilage, especially regarding its interaction with chondrocytes. We show that COMP/TSP5 can support chondrocyte attachment and that the RGD sequence in COMP/TSP5 and the integrin receptors α 5 β 1 and α V β 3 on the chondrocytes are involved in mediating this attachment. The interactions of COMP/TSP5 with the integrins are dependent on COMP/TSP5 conformation. Chondrocyte attachment to COMP/TSP5 in the calcium-replete conformation was inhibited by function-blocking integrin α 5 and β 1 antibodies, suggesting the involvement of the α 5 β 1 integrin. Under this condition, a function-blocking antibody against α V β 3 did not have any effect on cell attachment. On the other hand, chondrocyte attachment to reduced COMP/TSP5 was instead sensitive to α V β 3 function-blocking antibodies, suggesting that COMP/TSP5 mediates attachment through chondrocyte α V β 3 integrin under this condition. Cell attachment to reduced COMP/TSP5 was not inhibited by β 1 antibodies. These data indicate that COMP/TSP5 in different conformations can utilize different integrin receptors. These results are the first to demonstrate that COMP/TSP5 can mediate chondrocyte attachment through interactions with integrins. Through these interactions, COMP/TSP5 may be able to regulate cellular activities and respond to environment in the surrounding cartilage matrix.

RESULTS

We first used the chondrocyte-derived cell line TC1a to test whether COMP/TSP5 is an adhesive protein for chondrocytes. Chondrocytes grown in monolayer systems were used for short-term attachment assays. For the attachment assays, cells were allowed to adhere to 96-well plates that were coated with recombinant COMP/TSP5 or MUT3 at various concentrations. Based on our previous results showing that COMP/TSP5 is a calcium-binding protein and that calcium influences the conformation of COMP/TSP5 protein ( 16 ), we investigated whether the conformation of COMP/TSP5 also affected its ability to support the chondrocyte attachment. For this purpose, we coated COMP/TSP5 or MUT3 in the presence of either calcium or EDTA. All attachment assays were performed in the presence of 2 mM calcium ions regardless of the protein-coating conditions. Attached cells were quantified using CyQuant (Molecular Probes). In our preliminary studies we have shown that fluorescence readings were linearly proportional to the number of cells. Typically ~70% of the cells initially added to the wells remained at the end of the attachment assay under our conditions unless inhibitors were used. For TC1a cells grown in monolayer, COMP/TSP5 in a calcium-replete conformation supported cell attachment in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 1 A ). At protein-coating concentrations of 5 μ g/ml and higher the cells also spread on the protein-coated wells ( Fig. 2 ). Treating cells 2 h before and during cell attachment assay with cycloheximide did not affect cell attachment, suggesting that in this short-term assay protein synthesis is not required for the attachment of cells to COMP/TSP5 ( Fig. 3 ). Treating COMP/TSP5 with calcium or EDTA without reduction had no obvious effect on attachment of the TC1a cells grown in a monolayer ( Fig. 1 A ). MUT3 also supported TC1a cell attachment, and treating MUT3 with EDTA before coating did not affect cell attachment significantly ( Fig. 1 B ). These results suggest that the removal of calcium from wild type COMP/TSP5 ( Fig. 1 A ) or MUT3 ( Fig. 1 B ) does not affect the capacity to bind to chondrocytes cultured in a monolayer compared with the calcium-replete condition.

It was shown previously with TSP1 and TSP2 that the availability of the RGD sequence, located in the calcium-binding type 3 repeats, is regulated by calcium binding as well as the complex intracellular disulfide bonds ( 28 – 30 ). Reduction of TSP1 and TSP2 helps to expose the RGD sequences that are possibly cryptic inside the complex intracellular disulfide bonds within the type 3 calcium-binding repeats ( 28 , 29 ). We wished to determine whether this holds true for COMP/TSP5 because of the high degree of homology in the type 3 repeats among all TSPs and the presence of the RGD sequence in human COMP/TSP5. To test this hypothesis, we reduced the coated calcium-depleted COMP/TSP5 or MUT3 with the reducing reagent dithiothreitol before adding the cells for attachment. Indeed, reduction of either wild type COMP/TSP5 or MUT3 ( protein/R in Fig. 1, A and B , respectively) after coating increased cell attachment, especially in wells coated with low concentrations, 1 μ g/ml or less, of COMP/TSP5 or MUT3. Cells attached to and spread on dithiothreitol-treated COMP/TSP5 coated at 1 μ g/ml ( Fig. 2 ).

In addition to immortalized chondrocytes, we have also tested whether COMP/TSP5 can support the attachment of primary chondrocytes. For this purpose, juvenile costochondral chondrocytes were used for short-term attachment assays as above, and we observed similar results (data not shown).

To investigate the nature of the interaction between COMP/TSP5 and chondrocytes, sequences on COMP/TSP5 that mediate the attachment were studied. An RGD sequence is located in the type 3 calcium-binding repeats of COMP/TSP5. We assessed whether the RGD sequence is active. For this purpose, we included a peptide containing RGD in the attachment assay (GRGDSP). A peptide containing the RGE sequence (GRGESP) was used as control. COMP/TSP5 was coated either in the presence of calcium or in the presence of EDTA followed by reduction. Under both conditions, the RGD peptide was able to inhibit the attachment of primary chondrocytes to COMP/TSP5 in a RGD peptide concentration-dependent manner, whereas the RGE peptide had no significant effect ( Fig. 4 ). These data suggest that COMP/TSP5 can support chondrocyte attachment, at least in part, via its RGD sequence.

The inhibitory effect of RGD suggests that the cells interact with COMP/TSP5 via cell surface integrins. To determine the integrin receptor expression on the primary human chondrocytes used in our experiments, we performed cell surface biotin labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with specific integrin antibodies. Our results showed that primary chondrocytes expressed integrins including α 3 β 1 and α 1 β 1 (not shown) as well as α V β 3 and those that contain α 5 and α 6 subunits in smaller amounts ( Fig. 5 ). Similarly, integrins containing the β 1 subunit and those that contain the α 5 and α 6 subunits, as well as α 3 β 1 and α V β 3, were also found to be expressed by the TC1a cells (data not shown). The lack of any precipitated bands with control mouse IgG indicated the stringency of our immunoprecipitation studies. The existence of more than one band in a lane indicates the presence of both the α and the β subunits in the immunoprecipitated integrin as expected for these heterodimeric receptors and possibly other cell surface-associated proteins.

To determine the integrin receptors on chondrocytes that mediate attachment to COMP/TSP5, various antibodies against integrin receptors were tested in attachment assays using chondrocytes. First, we examined the attachment of primary chondrocytes attached to calcium-replete COMP/TSP5, as shown in Fig. 6 . A function-blocking monoclonal antibody against the β 1 integrin subunit, mAb13, blocked the attachment, whereas another antibody without function-blocking activity against β 1, B3B11, did not inhibit substantially the attachment of primary chondrocytes to calcium-replete COMP/TSP5. Monoclonal antibodies against either the α 1 or α 2 subunit, reported by the manufacturer to inhibit cell attachment to collagen at the concentrations used, did not have any obvious effect on attachment to COMP/TSP5. However, mAb16 against the α 5 subunit was effective in inhibiting attachment ( Fig. 6 ). A function-blocking antibody against α V β 3 did not block attachment of primary chondrocytes to COMP/TSP5 (see below and Fig. 7 ). These results suggest that chondrocyte attachment to calcium-replete COMP/TSP5 involves the cell surface integrin receptor α 5 β 1.

Similar to the primary chondrocytes, TC1a cell attachment to COMP/TSP5 also seemed to involve the α 5 β 1 receptor. Attachment of the TC1a cells to calcium-replete COMP/TSP5 was inhibited by antibodies against either the α 5 or β 1 subunit. The antibodies tested were antibodies against the α 5 subunit, P1D6 and JBS5, and antibodies against the β 1 subunit, 4B4 and P4C10. Neither mouse IgG nor the B3B11 antibody without function-blocking activity against the β 1 sub-unit inhibited attachment. Antibody LM609 against integrin α v β 3 did not have any inhibitory effect, indicating that α V β 3 integrin is not involved under this condition.

Because the different conformation induced by reduction of COMP/TSP5 seems to regulate its adhesive activity, we tested whether changing the conformations of COMP/TSP5 also affects its interaction with cell surface receptors. We showed above that chondrocyte attachment to calcium-replete COMP/TSP5 (COMP/C) was inhibited by antibodies against α 5 β 1 but not against the α V β 3 integrin. Under this condition, antibody 4B4 against the β 1 integrin subunit inhibited attachment in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the antibody LM609 against α V β 3 integrin did not have any appreciable effect on the attachment ( Fig. 7 ). When chondrocytes were allowed to attach to calcium-depleted and reduced COMP/TSP5 (COMP/R), attachment was not inhibited by the 4B4 antibody against the β 1 subunit in all concentrations tested, including the concentration range at which 4B4 blocked these cells from attaching to COMP/C. Instead, the attachment was inhibited by antibody LM609 against α V β 3 in an antibody concentration-dependent fashion ( Fig. 7 ). Under this condition, the attachment was also inhibited by the RGD peptide in a concentration-dependent manner but not inhibited by the RGE peptide ( Fig. 2 ). These data suggest that in the calcium-depleted, reduced conformation, COMP/TSP5 can now recognize the cell surface α V β 3 receptor and interact with the chondrocyte.

DISCUSSION

COMP/TSP5 is an extracellular matrix protein that is abundant in musculoskeletal tissues including cartilage, tendon, ligament, and synovium. However, despite intensive studies on COMP/TSP5 and the fact that COMP/TSP5 is associated with several pathological conditions, its function in the connective tissue remains to be defined. To investigate the potential role of COMP/TSP5 in cartilage, in this paper we have studied the interaction of COMP/TSP5 with chondrocytes, the unique cell type found in cartilage.

Several important conclusions can be drawn from our current studies. First, we have shown that COMP/TSP5 can bind chondrocytes and serves as an adhesive factor for these cells using short-term attachment assays. This is in agreement with the distribution of COMP/TSP5 close to the chondrocytes in early development in cartilage pericellular and territorial matrix ( 7 , 8 ). Through binding to the chondrocytes, COMP/TSP5 has the potential to influence cellular activities and cellular phenotype. Indeed, Kipnes et al. ( 39 ) reported that COMP/TSP5 plays a role in mesenchymal chondrogenesis in vitro . COMP/TSP5 was shown to be able to regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells under the influence of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Thus, COMP/TSP5 can coordinate with BMP-2 to promote early stages of chondrogenic differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells. Whether this process involves the interaction of COMP/TSP5 with integrin warrants further investigation.

Furthermore, we have investigated the sequences on COMP/TSP5 involved in the adhesive function of this molecule. It has been debated whether the RGD sequence in COMP/TSP5 is active because it is buried in the calcium-binding domain and is conserved in human, mouse, and bovine COMP/TSP5 but not in rat COMP/TSP5. Our data suggest that the RGD sequence does play a role in mediating the attachment of chondrocytes in human cartilage.

In addition, we have studied the influence of the calcium binding conformation of COMP on its cellular attachment activities. In our previous studies we have shown that COMP/TSP5 is a calcium-binding protein and that its conformation depends on the amount of calcium bound by the protein ( 16 ). Because COMP/TSP5 under physiological conditions exists in an environment where the concentrations of calcium are in the millimolar range, we purified COMP/TSP5 in a calcium-replete conformation. We then asked if chelation of calcium ions from COMP/TSP5 affects its function and, furthermore, if mutations in COMP/TSP5 that render the protein defective in calcium binding also affect its function. Using TC1a cells cultured in a monolayer, we found that the calcium binding conformation of COMP/TSP5 does not have substantial influence on the adhesiveness of the protein. In agreement, MUT3 also supports adhesion of these cells as well as wild type COMP/TSP5. These results suggest that calcium binding conformation of COMP/TSP5 did not have any major influence on its ability to support chondrocyte attachment under our conditions.

Most importantly, our data also indicate that COMP/TSP5 can interact with α 5 β 1 and α V β 3 under different conditions. Through interactions with different receptors, COMP/TSP5 can potentially mediate different cellular responses. Although α 5 β 1 and α V β 3 are present on the cell surface of chondrocytes, they have different distribution patterns. Both integrins are expressed by articular and growth plate chondrocytes in fetal cartilage ( 40 – 42 ), and α V β 3 expression seems to be lower in the adolescent growth plate cartilage ( 43 ). It is possible that the ligation of the two integrins can confer different functions. For example, it has been shown that activation of either α 5 β 1 or α V β 3 plays opposite roles in mediating the inflammatory response in cartilage in osteoarthritis ( 44 ). The question of whether COMP/TSP5 interaction with either of these two integrins also leads to different downstream effects warrants further studies.

Integrin receptors exist on chondrocytes and recognize various cartilage extracellular matrix proteins ( 45 , 46 ). Both the α 5 β 1 and α v β 3 integrins have been found on the chondrocyte cell surface along with the α 1 β 1, α 2 β 1, α 3 β 1, α 6 β 1, α 10 β 1, and α v β 5 integrins ( 47 , 48 ). The integrins are important for cartilage morphogenesis and differentiation. Inhibition of integrins using anti- β 1 antibodies leads to the inhibition of chondrogenesis ( 49 ). In addition, it has been established that human articular chondrocytes use the α 5 β 1 integrin as a mechanoreceptor. Mechanical stimulation of normal human knee joint chondrocytes initiates a signal cascade involving stretch-activated ion channels, the α 5 β 1 integrin, and the interleukin-4 loop that results in membrane hyperpolarization, increased levels of aggrecan mRNA, and decreased levels of matrix metalloprotease-3 ( 50 – 53 ). Although an extracellular matrix-integrin interaction can result in anabolic responses in chondrocytes, catabolic consequences of this interaction have also been reported. Although the mechanoreceptor in osteoarthritis chondrocytes is also the α 5 β 1 integrin, downstream signaling pathways may differ, resulting in membrane depolarization and no change in aggrecan or matrix metalloprotease-3 expression following mechanical stimulation ( 54 – 56 ). These responses may play a role in the phenotypic changes and increased cartilage breakdown in diseased cartilage. However, the extracellular matrix molecules that can interact with the integrin receptors, as well as the exact mechanism leading from extracellular matrix-integrin interactions to the changes in intracellular signaling events and downstream biosynthetic reactions, remain unclear at present and need further studies. Here, our results have shown that COMP/TSP5 can mediate the interaction of chondrocytes with the cartilage extracellular matrix through interaction with cell surface integrin receptors.

Fibronectin (FN) and COMP/TSP5 have been shown to interact with each other and to colocalize in some regions of cartilage ( 10 ). These observations suggest the possibility that some of the functions of COMP/TSP5 may be indirectly mediated by FN. However, several pieces of evidence suggest that this is not the case in our study. First, it has been shown that COMP/TSP5 exists in articular cartilage in much higher concentrations (up to 5 mg/ml) ( 57 ) than FN (~1.5 μ g/ml) ( 58 ). Second, in our short-term attachment assays cycloheximide, which inhibits protein synthesis including FN synthesis, did not inhibit chondrocyte attachment to COMP/TSP5. This suggests that COMP/TSP5 can bind to chondrocyte integrin receptors directly instead of binding indirectly through FN. Further evaluations of the potential role of interactions between these two molecules may be explored in future studies. Likewise, the lack of effect of cycloheximide and the lack of the inhibitory effect of antibodies to α 1 or α 2 integrins, receptors for the collagens, also argues against the indirect involvement of collagen in our system.

For our studies, both immortalized and primary chondrocytes isolated from the costochondral cartilage in monolayer culture system were utilized. With these chondrocytes we have shown that COMP can interact with the cell surface integrin receptors, including α 5 β 1 and α v β 3. Because of the extremely limited availability of healthy human articular chondrocytes, we were not able to test whether COMP can interact similarly with these freshly isolated cells. It has been known that chondrocytes dedifferentiate in an extensive monolayer culture. In addition, non-weight-bearing cartilage, such as costochondral cartilage, is different in its matrix organization as compared with the weight-bearing articular cartilage, e.g. COMP is present at a much higher concentration in articular cartilage than in costochondral cartilage ( 57 ). Therefore care needs to be taken when we interpret our data and extrapolate to articular cartilage in vivo . Because of the clinical importance of articular cartilage and its involvement in arthritis, further experiments investigating the interaction of COMP with articular cartilage is of great importance in the future.

In summary, we have shown that COMP/TSP5 supports chondrocyte attachment in vitro and that integrins are functional receptors on chondrocytes that mediate attachment to COMP/TSP5. We have further shown that the conformation of COMP/TSP5 influences the receptors on the chondrocyte cell surface utilized for attachment. Our studies would indicate that COMP/TSP5 may function in mediating cell-matrix interactions within cartilage and other musculoskeletal tissues in vivo and that through these interactions COMP/TSP5 may function to regulate chondrocyte cellular activities as well as its phenotypic development.
