The Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) protein VP35 is multifunctional; it inhibits 
IFN-α/β production and functions as a cofactor of the viral RNA polymerase. Mass 
spectrometry identified the double stranded RNA binding protein 76 
(DRBP76/NFAR-1/NF90) as a cellular factor that associates with the VP35 
C-terminal interferon inhibitory domain (IID). DRBP76 is described to regulate 
host cell protein synthesis and play an important role in host defense. The 
VP35-IID-DRBP76 interaction required the addition of exogenous dsRNA, but 
full-length VP35 associated with DRBP76 in the absence of exogenous dsRNA. Cells 
infected with a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-expressing VP35 redistributed 
DRBP76 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the compartment in which EBOV 
replicates. Overexpression of DRBP76 did not alter the ability of VP35 to 
inhibit type I IFN production but did impair the function of the EBOV 
transcription/replication complex. These data suggest that DRBP76, via its 
association with VP35, exerts an anti-EBOV function.
