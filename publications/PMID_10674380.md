Hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and cycling are characterized by a tightly 
controlled balance of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The members 
of the bcl-2 family of proto-oncogenes are important key players in the 
apoptosis control machinery of most cell types. Bcl-2, an apoptosis inhibitor, 
and Bax, an apoptosis promoter, show tightly regulated, hair cycle-dependent 
expression patterns: during catagen, the distal ORS of the HF remains strongly 
positive for Bcl-2 and Bax; in contrast, the proximal epithelial part of the HF 
loses most Bcl-2 expression while it remains strongly positive for Bax. In Bcl-2 
null mice, skin becomes markedly hypopigmented during the first postnatal anagen 
probably due to increased melanocyte apoptosis. Reportedly, these mice also show 
a retardation of the first anagen development after birth. Transgenic mice 
overexpressing Bcl-2 under the control of the keratin-1 promoter display 
multifocal epidermal hyperplasia and aberrant expression of keratin-6, while 
alterations of HF cycling have not been investigated. Surprisingly, Bcl-2 
overexpression under the control of the keratin-14 promoter leads to accelerated 
catagen progression and increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, HF dystrophy 
and alopecia. Transgenic mice overexpressing Bcl-X(L), another anti-apoptotic 
bcl-2 family member, under the control of the K14 promoter, reportedly also 
display accelerated catagen development. These and other Bcl-2 transgenic and 
null mice are now available to further dissect the as yet unclear, and likely 
complex, role of Bcl-2 in HF growth and pigmentation.
