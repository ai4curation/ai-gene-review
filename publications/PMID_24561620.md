To maintain genome function and stability, DNA sequence and its organization 
into chromatin must be duplicated during cell division. Understanding how entire 
chromosomes are copied remains a major challenge. Here, we use nascent chromatin 
capture (NCC) to profile chromatin proteome dynamics during replication in human 
cells. NCC relies on biotin-dUTP labelling of replicating DNA, affinity 
purification and quantitative proteomics. Comparing nascent chromatin with 
mature post-replicative chromatin, we provide association dynamics for 3,995 
proteins. The replication machinery and 485 chromatin factors such as CAF-1, 
DNMT1 and SUV39h1 are enriched in nascent chromatin, whereas 170 factors 
including histone H1, DNMT3, MBD1-3 and PRC1 show delayed association. This 
correlates with H4K5K12diAc removal and H3K9me1 accumulation, whereas H3K27me3 
and H3K9me3 remain unchanged. Finally, we combine NCC enrichment with 
experimentally derived chromatin probabilities to predict a function in nascent 
chromatin for 93 uncharacterized proteins, and identify FAM111A as a replication 
factor required for PCNA loading. Together, this provides an extensive resource 
to understand genome and epigenome maintenance.
