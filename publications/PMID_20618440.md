14-3-3 is a family of proteins comprising several isoforms that, in many cases, 
promote cell survival by association with proapoptotic proteins. This study was 
designed to obtain further understanding of the 14-3-3 role in apoptosis 
regulation, by analyzing apoptosis-related protein-14-3-3 interactions. Western 
blot analysis of an eluted fraction from the 14-3-3-affinity chromatography 
column identified proapoptotic proteins as receptor-interacting protein 3 and 
Bcl-2-antagonist/killer as new phophorylation-dependent 14-3-3-binding proteins 
under physiological conditions. The apoptosis inducer C2-ceramide promoted decay 
of the 14-3-3-binding signal of protein cell extracts. Investigation of the role 
of 14-3-3 in C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis showed that depletion of the 
14-3-3zeta isoform sensitized to cell death, whereas overexpression of this 
isoform delayed cell death. A combination of tandem affinity purification and 
liquid chromatography-tandem MS techniques identified 15 proteins involved in 
cell survival processes whose 14-3-3-binding status changed during 
C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis. Under physiological conditions, desmin was 
clearly identified as a new 14-3-3-interactor protein, and 
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, nucleophosmin and calmodulin, whose 
14-3-3 binding was suggested by others on the basis of MS analysis, were 
confirmed here as phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3-associated proteins. 
Interestingly, proteins related to the regulation of DNA double-strand break 
repair in the early stages of apoptosis, such as DNA-dependent protein kinase, 
or the regulation of cell shrinkage during apoptosis, such as 
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and death promoters like 
receptor-interacting protein 3, were identified as 14-3-3-associated proteins 
whose 14-3-3-binding status changed when apoptosis was initiated. The functional 
diversity of these identified proteins suggests that 14-3-3 may regulate the 
apoptotic process through new mechanisms, in addition to others previously 
characterized.
