Recently, single chain peptides have been designed that target the insulin 
receptor and mimic insulin action. The aim of this study is to explore if 
activation of the insulin receptor with such an optimized peptide (S597) leads 
to the same activation of signaling pathways and biological endpoints i.e. 
stimulation of glycogen synthesis and cell proliferation as stimulation with 
insulin. We find that surface activation of the insulin receptor A-isoform with 
S597 leads to activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and glycogen synthesis 
comparable to activation by insulin, even though the level of insulin receptor 
phosphorylation is lower. In contrast, both Src homology 2/alpha 
collagen-related (Shc) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 
activation are virtually absent upon stimulation with S597. Cell proliferation 
is only stimulated slightly by S597, suggesting that it depends on signals from 
Shc and ERK. The differences in signaling response could explain both the 
earlier reported differences in gene expression, and the reported differences in 
cell proliferation and glycogen synthesis induced by insulin and S597. In 
conclusion, despite binding equipotency, insulin, and S597 initiate different 
signaling and biological responses through the same insulin receptor isoform. We 
show for the first time that it is possible to design insulin receptor ligand 
mimetics with metabolic equipotency but low mitogenicity.
