Hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2) is a hyaluronan (HA)-degrading enzyme found 
intracellularly or/and anchored to the plasma membrane through 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). Normal human bronchial epithelial cells 
(NHBE) grown at the air-liquid interphase (ALI), treated with PI-specific 
phospholipase C (PI-PLC), exhibited increased Hyal activity in secretions and 
decreased protein and activity on the apical membrane, confirming that 
GPI-anchored Hyal2 is expressed in NHBE cells and it remains active in its 
soluble form. We have reported that HA degradation was mediated by reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) in human airways. Here we show that ROS increase Hyal2 
expression and activity in NHBE cells and that the p38MAPK signaling pathway is 
involved in this effect. Hyal2 induction was confirmed by using small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) expressing lentivirus. These in vitro findings 
correlated in vivo with smokers, where increased Hyal2 immunoreactivity in the 
epithelium was associated with augmented levels of HA and the appearance of low 
molecular mass HA species in bronchial secretions. In summary, this work 
provides evidence that ROS induce Hyal2, suggesting that Hyal2 is likely 
responsible for the sustained HA fragmentation in the airway lumen observed in 
inflammatory conditions associated with oxidative stress.
