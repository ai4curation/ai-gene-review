The inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family of molecules inhibit apoptosis 
through the suppression of caspase activity. It is known that the XIAP protein 
regulates both caspase-3 and caspase-9 through direct protein-protein 
interactions. Specifically, the BIR3 domain of XIAP binds to caspase-9 via a 
;hotspot' interaction in which the N-terminal residues of caspase-9 bind in a 
shallow groove on the surface of XIAP. This interaction is regulated via SMAC, 
the N-terminus of which binds in the same groove, thus displacing caspase-9. The 
mechanism of suppression of apoptosis by cIAP1 is less clear. The structure of 
the BIR3 domain of cIAP1 (cIAP1-BIR3) in complex with N-terminal peptides from 
both SMAC and caspase-9 has been determined. The binding constants of these 
peptides to cIAP1-BIR3 have also been determined using the surface plasmon 
resonance technique. The structures show that the peptides interact with cIAP1 
in the same way that they interact with XIAP: both peptides bind in a similar 
shallow groove in the BIR3 surface, anchored at the N-terminus by a 
charge-stabilized hydrogen bond. The binding data show that the SMAC and 
caspase-9 peptides bind with comparable affinities (85 and 48 nM, respectively).
