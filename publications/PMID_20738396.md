The formation and structure of proinsulin C-peptide oligomers has been 
investigated by PAGE, NMR spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The results 
obtained show that C-peptide forms oligomers of different sizes, and that their 
formation and size distribution is altered by salt and divalent metal ions, 
which indicates that the aggregation process is mediated by electrostatic 
interactions. It is further demonstrated that the size distribution of the 
C-peptide oligomers, in agreement with previous studies, is altered by insulin, 
which supports a physiologically relevant interaction between these two 
peptides. A small fraction of oligomers has previously been suggested to be in 
equilibrium with a dominant fraction of soluble monomers, and this pattern also 
is observed in the present study. The addition of modest amounts of sodium 
dodecyl sulphate at low pH increases the relative amount of oligomers, and this 
effect was used to investigate the details of both oligomer formation and 
structure by a combination of biophysical techniques. The structural properties 
of the SDS-induced oligomers, as obtained by thioflavin T fluorescence, CD 
spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy, demonstrate that soluble aggregates are 
predominantly in β-sheet conformation, and that the oligomerization process 
shows characteristic features of amyloid formation. The formation of large, 
insoluble, β-sheet amyloid-like structures will alter the equilibrium between 
monomeric C-peptide and oligomers. This leads to the conclusion that the 
oligomerization of C-peptide may be relevant also at low concentrations.
