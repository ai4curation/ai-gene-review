TNFR-associated factor (TRAF)6 is an essential ubiquitin E3 ligase in immune 
responses, but its function in adaptive immunity is not well understood. In this 
study, we show that TRAF6 is recruited to the peripheral ring of the T cell 
immunological synapse in Jurkat T cells or human primary CD4(+) T cells 
conjugated with staphylococcal enterotoxin E-pulsed B cells. This recruitment 
depends on TRAF6 interacting with linker for activation of T cells (LAT) via its 
TRAF domain. Although LAT was indispensable for TCR/CD28-induced TRAF6 
ubiquitination and its ligase activity, RNA interference-induced TRAF6 knockdown 
in T cells decreased TCR/CD28-induced LAT ubiquitination, tyrosine 
phosphorylation, and association with tyrosine kinase ZAP70. Overexpression of 
TRAF6 or its catalytically inactive form C70A promoted and decreased, 
respectively, LAT tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation. Moreover, LAT was 
ubiquitinated at Lys(88) by TRAF6 via K63-linked chain. In addition, TRAF6 was 
required for and synergized with LAT to promote the TCR/CD28-induced activation 
of NFAT. These results reveal a novel function and mechanism of TRAF6 action in 
the TCR-LAT signaling pathway distinct from its role in TCR-induced NF-κB 
activation, indicating that LAT also plays an adapter role in TCR/CD28-induced 
activation of TRAF6.

Abstract

TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is an essential ubiquitin E3 ligase in immune responses, but its function in adaptive immunity is not well understood. Here we show that TRAF6 is recruited to the peripheral ring of the T cell immunological synapse in Jurkat T cells or human primary CD4 + T cells conjugated with SEE-pulsed B cells. This recruitment depends on TRAF6 interacting with linker for activation of T cells (LAT) via its TRAF domain. Although LAT was indispensable for TCR/CD28-induced TRAF6 ubiquitination and its ligase activity, RNA interference-induced TRAF6 knockdown in T cells decreased TCR/CD28-induced LAT ubiquitination, tyrosine-phosphorylation and association with tyrosine kinase ZAP70. Overexpression of TRAF6 or its catalytically inactive form C70A promoted and decreased, respectively, LAT tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation. Moreover, LAT was ubiquitinated at Lysine-88 by TRAF6 via K63-linked chain. In addition, TRAF6 was required for and synergized with LAT to promote the TCR/CD28-induced activation of NFAT. These results reveal a novel function and mechanism of TRAF6 action in the TCR-LAT signaling pathway distinct from its role in TCR-induced NF-κB activation, indicate LAT also play an adapter role in TCR/CD28-induced activation of TRAF6.

Introduction

Tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) belongs to the TRAF family of adapter proteins. It can act as an ubiquitin E3 ligase by inducing K63-linked ubiquitination of target proteins. Unlike other TRAFs, TRAF6 plays a dominant role in NF-κB activation initiated not only by members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily, but also by members of the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)/Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily ( 1 – 4 ). In these signaling pathways, receptor engagement results in recruitment of TRAF6 by adapters such as TRIF and MyD88, leading to oligomerization and ubiquitination of TRAF6. TRAF6 then ubiquitinates and activates the TAK1/TAB complex, followed by phosphorylation and activation of the IKK complex, leading to NF-κB activation ( 5 ).

T cell receptor (TCR) signaling is initiated when the TCR and costimulatory receptors, primarily CD28, on the T cell surface are engaged by cognate antigen presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs). An early TCR signaling event is the activation of the lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), which then phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of CD3 complex subunits, thereby facilitating the recruitment and activation of CD3ζ chain-associated protein of 70kDa (ZAP70) kinase. Recruitment of ZAP70 leads to a cascade of phosphorylation events involving linker for activation of T cells (LAT), SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76kDa (SLP76), Vav, protein kinase C-θ (PKCθ) and other signaling molecules, and eventually activates a number of transcription factors, notably NFAT, NF-κB and AP-1 ( 6 – 11 ). A polarized dynamic molecular structure called the immunological synapse (IS) or the supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC) is formed at T-APC cells conjugation site. The mature IS segregates into TCR and PKCθ-rich central SMAC (cSMAC) and an integrin-rich peripheral SMAC (pSMAC) ( 12 ). The activation of TCR-proximal molecules and the dynamic IS formation are tightly interwoven temporally and spatially to initiate, balance, amplify and, eventually, terminate TCR signaling in mature T cells ( 13 ). As a result of significant advances in microscopy, smaller aggregates of receptors and signaling molecules, termed microclusters, have been found to exist within the IS ( 13 – 14 ). TCR stimulation leads to the formation of separate IS microclusters containing proteins such as ZAP70, LAT and SLP76, which can then fuse or segregate to promote or terminate interactions between signaling proteins, respectively ( 15 , 16 ).

LAT is a prominent integral membrane adapter protein, which plays critical roles in T cell activation ( 17 ). The LAT cytoplasmic domain contains several conserved tyrosine (Tyr) residues including Tyr-132, -171, -191 and -226, which are primarily phosphorylated by ZAP70 upon TCR stimulation. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues provide docking sites for the recruitment of adapters (Grb2, SLP76, etc .), enzymes (PLC-γ1, Vav, etc. ) and the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), resulting in the assembly of a multiprotein complex, the so-called LAT signalosome. This signalosome transduces and propagates TCR signals leading to activation of downstream kinases and transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), resulting in T cell proliferation and cytokine expression ( 17 – 20 ). Genetic studies and evidence obtained from the analysis of LAT-deficient T cell lines demonstrated that LAT is a vital component of not only T cell activation, but also T cell development and differentiation, and that it can deliver both positive and negative regulatory signals via its distinct phosphorylated tyrosine residues ( 21 – 23 ). More recently, studies have shown that LAT is also subject to ubiquitination which might be involved in activation-induced internalization of LAT complexes and regulation of LAT protein stability ( 24 – 26 ). Therefore, elucidation of the components and functional mechanisms of the LAT signalosome is critical to our understanding of T cell activation and immune responses.

TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination and activation of the IKK/NEMO complex plays an essential role in the IL-1R/TLR-induced NF-κB pathway, it is also important for T cell activation, including the TCR-induced NF-κB pathway ( 27 – 29 ). Indeed, TRAF6-deficient mice have been shown to display severely abnormal T cell homeostasis ( 28 ), a dominant Th2-type polarized autoimmune response ( 30 ), resistance to anergizing signals ( 31 ), increased Th17 differentiation ( 32 ), and enhanced or decreased IL-2 production ( 28 , 31 , 33 ). Hyperactivation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, which is unrelated to NF-κB ( 34 ), was suggested to be responsible for the abnormal T cell homeostasis and Th2 polarization in Traf6 −/− mice ( 28 ). Although TRAF6 plays important roles in T cell immunity, it remains largely unknown how TRAF6 is regulated and how it functions in the TCR signaling pathway.

In this study, we found that LAT and TRAF6 regulate each other reciprocally. LAT is required for TRAF6 IS recruitment, ubiquitination and its E3 activity; whereas TRAF6 associates with LAT through its TRAF domain and functions an E3 ligase for LAT upon stimulation by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination at Lys-88 and in turn tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT. Knockdown of TRAF6 inhibited the TCR-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and activation of NFAT, and TRAF6 synergized with LAT to promote TCR-induced NFAT activation. These results suggest that TRAF6 is a component of the LAT signalsome that functions cooperatively with LAT during the early steps of T cell activation.

Discussion

TRAF6 is a key ubiquitin E3 ligase in NF-κB-mediated immune responses. However, its involvement in TCR signaling remains largely undefined. In this study, we show that TRAF6 was recruited to the pSMAC of the T cell IS, and that this localization depended on its association with LAT via the TRAF domain. LAT was required for the TCR-induced TRAF6 ubiquitination and its K63-linked ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Conversely, TRAF6 was important for the TCR-induced K63-linked ubiquitination of LAT and for its association with ZAP70, tyrosine phosphorylation, and LAT-mediated NFAT activation. Thus, our results reveal a novel layer of TRAF6 regulatory activity in TCR signaling mediated by its interplay with LAT.

As a master adapter that couples TCR signaling to downstream signaling events, LAT mainly supplies phosphorylated tyrosine residues that function as docking sites for the recruitment and activation of different effectors. Here, we have shown that in the absence of LAT, the TCR-induced ubiquitination and IS recruitment of TRAF6, as well as its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity were essentially missing. Thus, LAT is a critical adapter for TCR-induced recruitment and activation of TRAF6. A TRAF6-binding motif, PxExxD/E/Ф, which binds the TRAF domain of TRAF6 was found in upstream adapter proteins that, together with TRAF6, play important roles in CD40 and IL-1R/TLR signaling ( 44 ). MALT1, a crucial molecule in TCR-induced NF-κB activation, serves as an adapter for TRAF6, and associates with it through two TRAF6-binding motifs ( 27 ). In the case of LAT-TRAF6 interaction, as in the case of other TRAF6-associated proteins, the TRAF domain is responsible for binding LAT. However, LAT does not have a PxExxD/E/Ф motif, suggesting that LAT employs either a different motif or an intermediate adapter to bind the TRAF domain of TRAF6. Since gene knockout studies demonstrated distinct effects of LAT and TRAF6 versus MALT1 on T cell activation ( 22 , 28 , 45 ), MALT1 does not seem to be the adapter that mediates the association between TRAF6 and LAT. Thus, TRAF6 apparently interacts with LAT and MALT1, respectively, via different mechanisms within two different complexes.

We identified lysine-88 as the LAT site that undergoes TRAF6-induced K63-linked ubiquitination. This finding is consistent with a report that LAT is ubiquitinated at this site ( 26 ). However, in our study, K63-linked ubiquitination of LAT by TRAF6 was associated with increased LAT phosphorylation, while Samelson et al. reported that LAT ubiquitination by Cbl proteins is important for LAT protein stability ( 26 ). This apparent difference raises the question of how a single site can be modified by two different E3 ligases that lead to distinct functional outcomes. Since TRAF6 knockdown can affect LAT ubiquitination and phosphorylation at very early stimulation times, it is possible that this conundrum could reflect successive LAT modification, where TRAF6 functions early to modify LAT, whereas Cbl proteins regulate LAT half-life at later activation stages.

Interestingly, this study has demonstrated that the membrane-proximal region of LAT preceding Tyr-132 mediates its association with TRAF6, which promotes the ubiquitination of LAT and, in turn, the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on LAT. This finding assigns a novel, hitherto unknown function to this membrane-proximal region, namely, association with TRAF6, which is required for phosphorylation of the more distal tyrosine residues in LAT.

Deletion of Lat in mature CD4 + T cells leads to a lymphoproliferative disorder accompanied by elevated Th2 cytokine production ( 22 , 46 ). Meanwhile, Traf6 deletion has no apparent effect on TCR-induced NF-κB activation but instead leads to severe T cell hyperproliferation and a Th2 dominant autoimmune response, which may result from hyperactivation of the PI3K-Akt pathway ( 28 , 29 ). We showed here that TRAF6 knockdown significantly decreases LAT tyrosine (including Tyr-132 and Tyr-191) phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Tyr-191 residue in human LAT (Tyr-195 in murine LAT) recruits Gab2, which acts as a scaffold protein for the phosphatase SHP-2 and a negative regulator of T cell activation. Mutation of tyr-191 can disrupt downstream Gab2 and SHP-2 recruitment to the LAT signalosome, and stimulate the PI3K-Akt pathway ( 22 , 46 – 47 ). Therefore, TRAF6-dependent enhancement of LAT Tyr-191 phosphorylation may provide a molecular, mechanistic basis for the similarity between the T cell phenotypes of Traf6 -deficient mice and Lat -deficient mice, as well as for the T cell-intrinsic negative regulatory role of TRAF6 and LAT ( 28 , 46 – 47 ). Moreover, impaired LAT Tyr-132 phosphorylation in TRAF6 knockdown T cells could be the major reason for decreased phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and the following inhibition in NFAT activation upon TCR engagement. Thus, this discovery may also reveal a underlying molecular link between the requirement of TRAF6 and the function of NFAT in T cell anergy ( 31 , 48 – 49

Intriguingly, knockdown of TRAF6 did not affect the TCR-induced membrane recruitment of PLC-γ1 ( Figure 6B ) despite reducing its TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation as well as that of LAT. This reduced phosphorylation may result from deficient recruitment of ZAP-70 to the LAT signalosome ( Figure 4G ). Regarding the unabated membrane recruitment, it is known that membrane recruitment of PLC-γ1 is not solely dependent on its binding to phosphorylated Tyr-132 of LAT, and that other proteins, including SLP-76 which forms separate microcluster distinct from LAT, may also contribute to this membrane recruitment ( 15 , 20 , 43 ).

In summary, we have discovered that the adapter LAT is essential for TCR-induced TRAF6 E3 ligase activity and that, in turn, TRAF6 regulates LAT tyrosine phosphorylation by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of LAT. As a result of this reciprocal cross talk, TRAF6 and LAT cooperate, and apparently synergize, to enhance TCR-induced NFAT activation. Our results reveal a previously unknown mechanism underlying the immunological function of TRAF6 in T cells and, furthermore, highlight a novel regulatory mechanism of TCR proximal signaling.
