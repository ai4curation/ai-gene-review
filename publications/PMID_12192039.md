I-mfa has been identified as an inhibitor of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix 
transcription factors, and a related human I-mfa domain-containing protein (HIC) 
also has been identified as a protein that regulates Tat- and Tax-mediated 
expression of viral promoters. HIC and I-mfa represent a family of proteins that 
share a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain, termed the I-mfa domain. We show 
here that both I-mfa domain proteins, HIC and I-mfa, interacted in vivo with the 
Axin complex through their C-terminal I-mfa domains. This interaction inhibited 
Axin-mediated downregulation of free levels of cytosolic beta-catenin. I-mfa and 
HIC also both directly interacted with lymphocyte enhancer factor (LEF); 
however, I-mfa but not HIC significantly inhibited reporter constructs regulated 
by beta-catenin. The overexpression of HIC but not I-mfa decreased the 
inhibitory effects of Axin on beta-catenin-regulated reporter constructs, while 
both HIC and I-mfa decreased Axin-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 
activation. These data reveal for the first time that I-mfa domain proteins 
interact with the Axin complex and affect Axin regulation of both the Wnt and 
the JNK activation pathways. Interestingly, HIC differs from I-mfa in that I-mfa 
affects both Axin function and T-cell factor- or LEF-regulated transcription in 
the Wnt signaling pathway while HIC affects primarily Axin function.
