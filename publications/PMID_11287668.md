Histone deacetylase HDA1, the prototype for the class II mammalian deacetylases, 
is likely the catalytic subunit of the HDA1-containing complex that is involved 
in TUP1-specific repression and global deacetylation in yeast. Although the 
class I RPD3-like enzymatic complexes have been well characterized, little is 
known about the identity and interactions of the factors that associate to form 
the HDA1 complex. In this paper, we identify related HDA2 and HDA3 proteins that 
are found in the HDA1 complex and show that HDA1 interacts with itself and with 
the HDA2-HDA3 subcomplex to form a likely tetramer. These interactions are 
necessary for catalytic activity because mutations in any of the three 
components disrupt activity both in vitro and in vivo. In this respect the HDA1 
complex differs from yeast RPD3, which has components such as SIN3 that are not 
essential for activity in vitro, and yeast HOS3, which has intrinsic in vitro 
activity as a homodimer in the absence of other subunits.
