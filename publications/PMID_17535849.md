Alpha-catenins play key functional roles in cadherin-catenin cell-cell adhesion 
complexes. We previously reported on alphaT-catenin, a novel member of the 
alpha-catenin protein family. alphaT-catenin is expressed predominantly in 
cardiomyocytes, where it colocalizes with alphaE-catenin at the intercalated 
discs. Whether alphaT- and alphaE-catenin have specific or synergistic functions 
remains unknown. In this study we used the yeast two-hybrid approach to identify 
specific functions of alphaT-catenin. An interaction between alphaT-catenin and 
plakophilins was observed and subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation 
and colocalization. Interaction with the amino-terminal part of plakophilins 
appeared to be specific for the central ;adhesion-modulation' domain of 
alphaT-catenin. In addition, we showed, by immuno-electron microscopy, that 
desmosomal proteins in the heart localize not only to the desmosomes in the 
intercalated discs but also at adhering junctions with hybrid composition. We 
found that in the latter junctions, endogenous plakophilin-2 colocalizes with 
alphaT-catenin. By providing an extra link between the cadherin-catenin complex 
and intermediate filaments, the binding of alphaT-catenin to plakophilin-2 is 
proposed to be a means of modulating and strengthening cell-cell adhesion 
between cardiac muscle cells. This could explain the devastating effect of 
plakophilin-2 mutations on cell junction stability in intercalated discs, which 
lead to cardiac muscle malfunction.
