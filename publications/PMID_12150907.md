Unfolded Pael receptor (Pael-R) is a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase 
Parkin. Accumulation of Pael-R in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of dopaminergic 
neurons induces ER stress leading to neurodegeneration. Here, we show that CHIP, 
Hsp70, Parkin, and Pael-R formed a complex in vitro and in vivo. The amount of 
CHIP in the complex was increased during ER stress. CHIP promoted the 
dissociation of Hsp70 from Parkin and Pael-R, thus facilitating Parkin-mediated 
Pael-R ubiquitination. Moreover, CHIP enhanced Parkin-mediated in vitro 
ubiquitination of Pael-R in the absence of Hsp70. Furthermore, CHIP enhanced the 
ability of Parkin to inhibit cell death induced by Pael-R. Taken together, these 
results indicate that CHIP is a mammalian E4-like molecule that positively 
regulates Parkin E3 activity.
