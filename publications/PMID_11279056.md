Nuclear import of proteins that are too large to passively enter the nucleus 
requires soluble factors, energy, and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). 
Nuclear protein transport can be regulated, and different forms of stress affect 
nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. As such, import of proteins containing a 
classical NLS is inhibited in starving yeast cells. In contrast, the hsp70 Ssa4p 
concentrates in nuclei upon starvation. Nuclear concentration of Ssa4p in 
starving cells is reversible, and transfer of stationary phase cells to fresh 
medium induces Ssa4p nuclear export. This export reaction represents an active 
process that is sensitive to oxidative stress. In starving cells, the N-terminal 
domain of Ssa4p mediates Ssa4p nuclear accumulation, and a short hydrophobic 
sequence, termed Star (for starvation), is sufficient to localize the reporter 
proteins green fluorescent protein or beta-galactosidase to nuclei. To determine 
whether nuclear accumulation of Star-beta-galactosidase depends on a specific 
nuclear carrier, we have analyzed its distribution in mutant yeast strains that 
carry a deletion of a single beta-importin gene. With this assay we have 
identified Nmd5p as a beta-importin required to concentrate 
Star-beta-galactosidase in nuclei when cells enter stationary phase.
