Abstract

Cadherin adhesion molecules are key determinants of morphogenesis and tissue architecture. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the morphogenetic contributions of cadherins remain poorly understood in vivo . Besides supporting cell–cell adhesion, cadherins can affect a wide range of cellular functions that include activation of cell signalling pathways, regulation of the cytoskeleton and control of cell polarity. To determine the role of E-cadherin in stratified epithelium of the epidermis, we have conditionally inactivated its gene in mice. Here we show that loss of E-cadherin in the epidermis in vivo results in perinatal death of mice due to the inability to retain a functional epidermal water barrier. Absence of E-cadherin leads to improper localization of key tight junctional proteins, resulting in permeable tight junctions and thus altered epidermal resistance. In addition, both Rac and activated atypical PKC, crucial for tight junction formation, are mislocalized. Surprisingly, our results indicate that E-cadherin is specifically required for tight junction, but not desmosome, formation and this appears to involve signalling rather than cell contact formation.

Introduction

E-cadherin is important for tissue morphogenesis and polarity ( Larue et al , 1994 ). Upon establishing cell–cell adhesion, cadherins cluster in specialized cell junctions, known as adherens junctions, which associate with the actin cytoskeleton ( Gottardi et al , 2002 ). By thus coupling cell adhesion to the cytoskeleton, E-cadherin can create a transcellular network that enables groups of cells or tissues to coordinate their behaviour.

The association of E-cadherin with the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by α-catenin that is linked to the cadherin via β-catenin ( Rimm et al , 1995 ). The latter molecule is also a key player in the Wnt signalling pathway ( Gottardi et al , 2002 ). Another catenin, p120 ctn , also binds directly to the cadherin and regulates the stability of the cadherin complex at the cell surface ( Reynolds and Roczniak-Ferguson, 2004 ). The catenin plakoglobin can functionally replace β-catenin in the adherens junctions, but is also a structural component of desmosomes. These cell structures contain nonclassical cadherins and associate with the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. Desmosomes provide tissues with stable and strong cell–cell adhesion ( Getsios et al , 2004 ).

Next to this core cadherin–catenin complex, many other scaffolding, signalling and cytoskeletal molecules are associated with the adherens junctions ( Perez-Moreno et al , 2003 ). For example, the tight junctional marker ZO-1 binds directly to α-catenin and this is considered an intermediate step in the formation of tight junctions ( Itoh et al , 1997 ). Tight junctions act as selective permeability barriers but also form a fence that physically separates the apical membrane domain from the basolateral domain in simple epithelial cells ( Anderson et al , 2004 ). The size and ion selectivity of tight junctions is variable within different tissues and depends on the type and levels of expression of claudins, four span transmembrane molecules, which constitute the tight junctional paired strands ( Inai et al , 1999 ; Colegio et al , 2003 ).

In vitro studies have shown that E-cadherin is not only necessary for adherens junction formation but its adhesive activity is also crucial for the assembly of other junctional complexes such as desmosomes, gap junctions and tight junctions ( Gumbiner et al , 1988 ; Musil et al , 1990 ; Watabe et al , 1994 ). This junctional complex assembly coincides with the establishment of cell polarity and enrichment at the cell junctions of several protein complexes known to be essential for polarity, suggesting an intimate relationship between junction formation and polarity ( Nelson, 2003 ). Indeed, experiments in Drosophila have shown that mutations in junctional proteins not only affect junction formation but also disturb epithelial polarity, whereas polarity mutants have a profound effect on junction formation as well ( Cox et al , 1996 ; Muller and Wieschaus, 1996 ; Tanentzapf et al , 2000 ). Together, these data have led to a model in which initial cell–cell adhesion mediated by the cadherin complex is a key step in setting up other cell junctions and epithelial polarity. One of these polarity complexes consists of the Par3/Par6/atypicalPKC (aPKC) complex, which localizes to the apical junctional complex in Drosophila and to tight junctions in mammalian epithelial cells ( Nelson, 2003 ). The activity of the Par3/Par6/aPKC polarity protein complex has been implicated in the formation of tight junctions in simple epithelia ( Macara, 2004 ). Its activation depends on the formation of cell–cell contacts ( Yamanaka et al , 2001 ) and Armadillo, the fly β-catenin homologue, is important for proper localization of this complex in Drosophila ( Bilder et al , 2003 ; Tanentzapf and Tepass, 2003 ). Activation of the Par3/Par6/aPKC complex is achieved by binding to the small GTPase Cdc42, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of aPKC ( Joberty et al , 2000 ; Lin et al , 2000 ).

The epidermis is a stratifying, squamous differentiating multilayered epithelium that serves as the first barrier with the outside environment. Not only does it protect against outside challenges such as microbes or toxic substances, it also prevents the unnecessary loss of water from the organism. Cell–cell adhesion within the epidermis is mediated by both adherens junctions and desmosomes. Two classical cadherins are expressed within the epidermis: P-cadherin, which is confined to the basal layer, and E-cadherin found in all epidermal cell layers ( Jensen et al , 1997 ).

The epidermis is not a classical polarized epithelium, such as intestinal epithelium, which has a clear apical and basolateral membrane domain separated by the apical junctional complex. Nevertheless, the epidermis shows polarization in a broader sense in that the specific layers of the epidermis express a unique set of differentiation and junctional markers ( Watt, 2001 ). For example, hemidesmosomes are restricted to the basal layer, whereas desmosomes are found in all layers but their number and protein composition vary between the different layers ( Getsios et al , 2004 ). Tight junctions, previously thought to be absent in the epidermis, are exclusively found in the granular layer ( Morita et al , 1998 ; Pummi et al , 2001 ; Brandner et al , 2002 ). Their importance in maintaining the epidermal barrier was underscored by the observations that in vivo inactivation of the tight junctional membrane protein claudin-1 results in epidermal water loss and ultimately in neonatal death of the mice ( Furuse et al , 2002 ). In addition, claudin-6 overexpression in the skin also disturbs barrier function ( Turksen and Troy, 2002 ).

To study the role of E-cadherin in the morphogenesis and function of stratifying epithelium, we inactivated its gene specifically in the developing epidermis of mice using the Cre-loxP system. We show that E-cadherin is essential for epidermal barrier function. Mice lacking E-cadherin in the epidermis die shortly after birth because of dehydration. Closer molecular examination revealed that key tight junctional components are improperly localized, resulting in altered tight junctional architecture. Indeed, biotin penetrance of the granular layer and altered resistance using impedance measurements of the E-cadherin-negative epidermis revealed impaired tight junction function. Surprisingly, desmosomes are still normally formed, indicating that, unlike previously thought, E-cadherin is specifically required for tight junction formation. Since cell contacts are not majorly altered, E-cadherin may influence tight junction formation via signalling molecules. Potential candidates are the small GTPase Rac and atypical PKC, which both show an altered distribution upon loss of E-cadherin in the epidermis.

Early deletion of E-cadherin in the epidermis results in perinatal death due to water loss

The K14-Cre/Ecad Fl/− mice die perinatally around 7–12 h after birth. The mutant skin appears more red and shiny than that of their control littermates, and has a parchment-like resemblance. In all K14-Cre/Ecad Fl/− mice, scaling of the upper ventral side occurs after a few hours ( Figure 5A ). This macroscopic appearance of the mice suggested a perturbed water barrier. Weighing experiments showed that E-cadherin mutant mice lost around 9% of their body weight during their short lifespan in comparison to an average 3% in control mice ( Figure 5B ). An increased haematocrit of mutant mice was also observed ( Figure 5C ), indicating loss of fluids from the K14-Cre/Ecad Fl/− mice. Indeed, a considerable increase in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured in the K14-Cre/Ecad Fl/− mice compared to control ( Figure 5D ). Thus, the lethal phenotype of the E-cadherin mutant mice most likely results from water loss as a result of a disturbance in epidermal barrier function.

Loss of E-cadherin does not result in loss or impairment of cell contact formation

Inactivation of α-catenin in the epidermis resulted in severe blistering and overgrowth ( Vasioukhin et al , 2001 ). Both phenotypes are not observed in K14-Cre/Ecad Fl/− mice ( Young et al , 2003 ; Tinkle et al , 2004 ; this paper). Loss of E-cadherin is partially compensated by P-cadherin in the basal layer ( Figure 2 ). In control mice, P-cadherin is most abundantly expressed around the hair follicles and only weakly in the interfollicular epidermis. However, in the E-cadherin-deficient epidermis, P-cadherin expression is strongly increased in the basal cells of this area. In addition, protein expression of desmosomal cadherins is also upregulated ( Figure 3C ). The increased expression of these two adhesive systems may explain why no blistering occurs and why cell contact formation appears normal in newborn epidermis ( Figure 4 ). The upregulation of P-cadherin may also be sufficient to confer normal growth and differentiation properties to the basal epidermal keratinocytes in the absence of E-cadherin. Alternatively, growth regulation may be a cadherin-independent function of α-catenin ( Vasioukhin et al , 2001 ).
