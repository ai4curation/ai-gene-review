Stromal cell-derived factor 2-like 1 (SDF2L1) is an endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER)-localized protein whose function is undefined. Here we show that SDF2L1 
protein levels are increased in response to ER stress-inducing compounds, but 
not other cell stressors that we tested in insulinoma cell lines. SDF2L1 protein 
levels were also induced by expression of misfolded proinsulin in insulinoma 
cells and in islets from diabetic mice. Immunoprecipitation and binding assays 
demonstrated that SDF2L1 interacts with the ER chaperone GRP78/BiP, the 
ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery and with misfolded proinsulin. 
Unexpectedly, knockdown of SDF2L1 in INS-1 (insulin 2 C96Y-GFP) cells increased 
the degradation kinetics of mutant proinsulin, suggesting that SDF2L1 regulates 
substrate availability for the ERAD system. We suggest that SDF2L1 increases the 
time that misfolded proteins have to achieve a correctly folded conformation and 
thus that SDF2L1 can act as a buffer for substrate availability for ERAD in 
pancreatic β-cells.
