We have isolated a human cDNA clone encoding a novel protein of 22 kDa that is a 
human counterpart of the rat oncoprotein PTTG. We show that the corresponding 
gene (hpttg) is overexpressed in Jurkat cells (a human T lymphoma cell line) and 
in samples from patients with different kinds of hematopoietic malignancies. 
Analysis of the sequence showed that hPTTG has an amino-terminal basic domain 
and a carboxyl-terminal acidic domain, and that it is a proline-rich protein 
with several putative SH3-binding sites. Subcellular fractionation studies show 
that, although hPTTG is mainly a cytosolic protein, it is partially localized in 
the nucleus. In addition we demonstrate that the acidic carboxyl-terminal region 
of hPTTG acts as a transactivation domain when fused to a heterologous DNA 
binding domain, both in yeast and in mammalian cells.
