Orosomucoid like 3 (ORMDL3) has been strongly linked with asthma in genetic 
association studies, but its function in asthma is unknown. We demonstrate that 
in mice ORMDL3 is an allergen and cytokine (IL-4 or IL-13) inducible endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) gene expressed predominantly in airway epithelial cells. Allergen 
challenge induces a 127-fold increase in ORMDL3 mRNA in bronchial epithelium in 
WT mice, with lesser 15-fold increases in ORMDL-2 and no changes in ORMDL-1. 
Studies of STAT-6-deficient mice demonstrated that ORMDL3 mRNA induction highly 
depends on STAT-6. Transfection of ORMDL3 in human bronchial epithelial cells in 
vitro induced expression of metalloproteases (MMP-9, ADAM-8), CC chemokines 
(CCL-20), CXC chemokines (IL-8, CXCL-10, CXCL-11), oligoadenylate synthetases 
(OAS) genes, and selectively activated activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), 
an unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway transcription factor. siRNA knockdown 
of ATF-6α in lung epithelial cells inhibited expression of SERCA2b, which has 
been implicated in airway remodeling in asthma. In addition, transfection of 
ORMDL3 in lung epithelial cells activated ATF6α and induced SERCA2b. These 
studies provide evidence of the inducible nature of ORMDL3 ER expression in 
particular in bronchial epithelial cells and suggest an ER UPR pathway through 
which ORMDL3 may be linked to asthma.

Abstract

Orosomucoid like 3 (ORMDL3) has been strongly linked with asthma in genetic association studies, but its function in asthma is unknown. We demonstrate that in mice ORMDL3 is an allergen and cytokine (IL-4 or IL-13) inducible endoplasmic reticulum (ER) gene expressed predominantly in airway epithelial cells. Allergen challenge induces a 127-fold increase in ORMDL3 mRNA in bronchial epithelium in WT mice, with lesser 15-fold increases in ORMDL-2 and no changes in ORMDL-1. Studies of STAT-6–deficient mice demonstrated that ORMDL3 mRNA induction highly depends on STAT-6. Transfection of ORMDL3 in human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro induced expression of metalloproteases (MMP-9, ADAM-8), CC chemokines (CCL-20), CXC chemokines (IL-8, CXCL-10, CXCL-11), oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) genes, and selectively activated activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), an unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway transcription factor. siRNA knockdown of ATF-6α in lung epithelial cells inhibited expression of SERCA2b, which has been implicated in airway remodeling in asthma. In addition, transfection of ORMDL3 in lung epithelial cells activated ATF6α and induced SERCA2b. These studies provide evidence of the inducible nature of ORMDL3 ER expression in particular in bronchial epithelial cells and suggest an ER UPR pathway through which ORMDL3 may be linked to asthma.

Discussion

In this study we demonstrate that ORMDL3 is an inducible bronchial epithelial gene regulating pathways of potential importance to asthma including expression of metalloproteases (MMP-9, ADAM-8), CC chemokines (CCL-20), CXC chemokines (IL-8, CXCL-10, CXCL-11), OAS genes, and SERCA2b a gene implicated in airway remodeling in asthma ( 24 ). Induction of ORMDL3 in lung epithelium depends on Th2 cytokines, STAT-6, and selectively activates ATF6, an UPR pathway transcription factor. The link between lung epithelial ORMDL3, ATF-6, and SERCA2b expression was demonstrated in studies in which transfection of ORMDL3–induced activation of ATF6 and expression of SERCA2b, whereas knockdown of ATF6α inhibited SERCA2b expression. These studies provide an ER localized mechanism for ORMDL3 to interact with ATF6 to modulate levels of SERCA2b in lung epithelium. These studies provide evidence of the Th2 cytokine inducible nature of ORMDL3 ER expression in bronchial epithelial cells in the lung and suggest ATF-6α–dependent (Serca 2b) and ATF-6α–independent pathways (metalloproteases, chemokines, OAS) through which ER localized ORMDL3 may be linked to asthma.

Transfection of ORMDL3 into primary human lung bronchial epithelial cells induced increased expression of genes with potential importance to asthma including metalloproteases (MMP-9, ADAM-8) ( 7 – 11 ), CC chemokines (CCL-20) ( 12 – 15 ), and CXC chemokines (IL-8, CXC-10) ( 16 – 21 ), suggesting potential downstream pathways from ORMDL3 pertinent to the pathogenesis of asthma. The importance of these ORMDL3–regulated genes to asthma is suggested from studies demonstrating increased expression of many of these mediators in the airways of human asthmatics (MMP-9, ADAM-8, CCL-20, CXCL-10, IL-8) ( 7 – 17 ), induction of these mediators by allergen inhalation in asthmatics (MMP-9, CCL-20, CXCL-10) ( 7 , 12 , 19 ), and inhibition of asthma outcomes in mice deficient in these genes (MMP-9, ADAM-8, CXCL-10) ( 8 , 9 , 11 , 20 , 21 ). In addition to the important role of CCL-20 on T-cell recruitment ( 12 ), and epithelial mucus production ( 14 ), in mouse models of asthma, there is a critical link between CCL-20 and TRAIL for Th2 cell activation and allergic airway inflammation ( 15 ). Although asthma has predominantly been associated with expression of CC chemokines, both CC and CXC chemokines have been linked to asthma in studies in humans with asthma ( 12 , 13 , 16 – 19 ), and in studies in animal models ( 13 , 20 , 21 ) (i.e., CXCL-10 KO have significant reduction in Th2-type allergic airway inflammation and AHR) ( 20 ).

In addition to identifying genes linked to asthma, the transfection of ORMDL3 into human bronchial epithelial cells also induced expression of OAS genes ( 31 ), a pathway not previously linked to ORMDL3. OAS proteins are pattern recognition receptors for the viral pattern associated molecular pattern, double-stranded RNA. In humans, the OAS gene family has three enzymatically active copies, OAS-1, OAS-2, and OAS-3 ( 31 ), all of which were significantly up-regulated in human lung epithelial cell transfected with ORMDL3. OAS catalyze the polymerization of ATP into 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylates, which activate a constitutively expressed latent endonuclease, RNaseL, to block viral replication at the level of mRNA degradation. OAS-1 is up-regulated by a wide range of viruses and has been shown to play an antiviral role during viral infections including in studies with the asthma associated virus RSV ( 32 ). At present it is not known how up-regulation of the OAS pathway by ORMDL3 may influence asthma outcomes. One possibility is that the induction of the OAS pathway may be a protective antiviral pathway in asthma inhibiting viral triggered exacerbations. Alternatively, OAS through up-regulation of IFN pathways may bias immune responses against the development of Th2 responses.

Because we demonstrated that ORMDL3 is an ER-inducible protein, we also examined whether ORMDL3 influenced the function of the ER. In addition to influencing protein folding, the ER responds to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen or disruption of ER functional capacity (collectively termed ER stress) by activating intracellular signal transduction pathways called the UPR ( 22 ). Together at least three mechanistically distinct arms of the UPR (IRE1, PERK, ATF6) regulate the expression of numerous genes that function within the ER secretory pathway but also affect broad aspects of cell fate and metabolism of proteins, amino acids, and lipids ( 22 ). In this study, we have made the observation that the ATF6 pathway of the UPR is selectively activated by ORMDL3. ATF6 (consisting of the closely related ATF6α and ATF6β in mammals) ( 23 ) is a transcription factor known to regulate genes involved in protein folding ( 22 ). Interestingly, our studies demonstrate that ATF6α regulates expression of SERCA2b, which has been implicated in airway remodeling in asthma ( 24 ). In addition, in mice ATF6 regulates expression of IL-6, a cytokine we detected at increased levels in human subjects with asthma ( 29 ) and which has also been implicated in mouse models of asthma ( 30 ). Prior studies of ORMDL3 in ER signaling using HEK 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells transformed with adenovirus) have investigated the role of ER pathways (IRE1, PERK) other than ATF6 and suggested that the main impact of ORMDL3 is on the PERK/eIF2α pathway ( 33 ). These studies also demonstrated that ORMDL3 interacted with SERCA-2 and inhibited its function ( 33 ). Our results may differ from these studies because we examined the ER ATF6 pathway (not examined in prior study) ( 33 ) and used cell types pertinent to ORMDL3 expression in asthma (airway epithelium rather than transformed embryonic kidney fibroblasts used in prior study).

One of the limitations of this study is the inability of the two anti-ORMDL Abs used for FACS and IHC to distinguish between ORMDL3 and the closely related ORMDL-1 and ORMDL-2, which share significant amino acid identity ( 5 ). Nevertheless, the FACS and IHC studies using these Abs demonstrate that ORMDL is induced in WT mice bronchial epithelium after allergen challenge. When the results of the FACS and IHC studies of ORMDL expression are coupled with results examining ORMDL-1, ORMDL-2, and ORMDL3 mRNA expression in these cell types, it strongly suggests that allergen challenge is predominantly inducing ORMDL3. For example, allergen challenge in WT mice resulted in a 127-fold induction of ORMDL3 mRNA by bronchial epithelial cells in vivo, with no induction of ORMDL-1, and only minimal induction of ORMDL-2 mRNA. In addition to lung epithelial cells, lung macrophages and lung eosinophils expressed both constitutive and inducible ORMDL. In contrast, lung neutrophils expressed constitutive ORMDL, which was not inducible with allergen challenge. Based on qPCR studies, ORMDL-2 was the predominant family member expressed by neutrophils.

Studies with STAT6-deficient mice demonstrated that the induction of ORMDL3 mRNA in airway epithelial cells in vivo depended on STAT6. Interpreting our STAT6 chimera studies in conjunction with the available ORMDL3 promoter bioinformatic database suggest that STAT6 is not directly regulating ORMDL3 expression (no STAT6-binding sites identified in promoter region of ORMDL3) but rather that a resident lung cell expresses a STAT6-dependent mediator that is regulating ORMDL3 expression. Potential candidate lung cells that express STAT6 and may generate a mediator regulating ORMDL3 include epithelial and/or non-epithelial cells (T cells, B cells, mast cells, macrophages, and natural helper cells). STAT6 is known to regulate the expression of at least 452 known genes ( 28 ), one or more of which could potentially be regulating ORMDL3 expression and will require further study.

In summary, these studies provide evidence of the allergen, Th2 cytokine, and STAT6-dependent inducible nature of ORMDL3 expression in airway epithelium in the lung. In addition, we demonstrated that ORMDL3 selectively regulates activation of the ER localized transcription factor ATF6α signaling branch, a pathway we have demonstrated in human lung epithelial cells is linked to SERCA-2b, which is implicated in airway remodeling in asthma ( 24 ). Finally, our studies demonstrate that ORMDL3 activates several metalloprotease, chemokine, and OAS-regulated genes, several of whom have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma ( 7 – 24 ). Overall, these studies provide evidence for a mechanism to link an ER localized protein such as ORMDL3 to the pathogenesis of asthma.
