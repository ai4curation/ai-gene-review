beta-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III (KAS III, also called 
acetoacetyl-ACP synthase) encoded by the fabH gene is thought to catalyze the 
first elongation reaction (Claisen condensation) of type II fatty acid synthesis 
in bacteria and plant plastids. However, direct in vivo evidence that KAS III 
catalyzes an essential reaction is lacking, because no mutant organism deficient 
in this activity has been isolated. We report the first bacterial strain lacking 
KAS III, a fabH mutant constructed in the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus 
lactis subspecies lactis IL1403. The mutant strain carries an in-frame deletion 
of the KAS III active site region and was isolated by gene replacement using a 
medium supplemented with a source of saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty 
acids. The mutant strain is devoid of KAS III activity and fails to grow in the 
absence of supplementation with exogenous long-chain fatty acids demonstrating 
that KAS III plays an essential role in cellular metabolism. However, the L. 
lactis fabH deletion mutant requires only long-chain unsaturated fatty acids for 
growth, a source of long-chain saturated fatty acids is not required. Because 
both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are required for growth when fatty 
acid synthesis is blocked by biotin starvation (which prevents the synthesis of 
malonyl-CoA), another pathway for saturated fatty acid synthesis must remain in 
the fabH deletion strain. Indeed, incorporation of [1-14C]acetate into fatty 
acids in vivo showed that the fabH mutant retained about 10% of the fatty acid 
synthetic ability of the wild-type strain and that this residual synthetic 
capacity was preferentially diverted to the saturated branch of the pathway. 
Moreover, mass spectrometry showed that the fabH mutant retained low levels of 
palmitic acid upon fatty acid starvation. Derivatives of the fabH deletion 
mutant strain were isolated that were octanoic acid auxotrophs consistent with 
biochemical studies indicating that the major role of FabH is production of 
short-chain fatty acid primers. We also confirmed the essentiality of FabH in 
Escherichia coli by use of a plasmid-based gene insertion/deletion system. 
Together these results provide the first genetic evidence demonstrating that 
FabH conducts the major condensation reaction in the initiation of type II fatty 
acid biosynthesis in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
