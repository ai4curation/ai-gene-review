BACKGROUND: In many animals, the epidermis is in permanent contact with the 
environment and represents a first line of defense against pathogens and injury. 
Infection of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by the natural fungal pathogen 
Drechmeria coniospora induces the expression in the epidermis of antimicrobial 
peptide (AMP) genes such as nlp-29. Here, we tested the hypothesis that injury 
might also alter AMP gene expression and sought to characterize the mechanisms 
that regulate the innate immune response.
RESULTS: Injury induces a wound-healing response in C. elegans that includes 
induction of nlp-29 in the epidermis. We find that a conserved p38-MAP kinase 
cascade is required in the epidermis for the response to both infection and 
wounding. Through a forward genetic screen, we isolated mutants that failed to 
induce nlp-29 expression after D. coniospora infection. We identify a kinase, 
NIPI-3, related to human Tribbles homolog 1, that is likely to act upstream of 
the MAPKK SEK-1. We find NIPI-3 is required only for nlp-29 induction after 
infection and not after wounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the C. elegans epidermis actively responds to 
wounding and infection via distinct pathways that converge on a conserved 
signaling cassette that controls the expression of the AMP gene nlp-29. A 
comparison between these results and MAP kinase signaling in yeast gives 
insights into the possible origin and evolution of innate immunity.
