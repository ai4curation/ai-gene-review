Stress granules (SG) and processing bodies (PBs) are cytoplasmic 
ribonucleoprotein particles whose assembly is induced by different stimuli. SG 
are the site of storage of untranslated transcripts formed in response to 
environmental stress, whereas PBs are involved in mRNA turnover. We recently 
characterized a novel family of four human proteins related to the 
Caenorhabditis elegans Mex-3, a RNA binding protein involved in the 
establishment of the anterior-posterior embryonic asymmetry and in the 
maintenance of germline pluripotency. We now report that the adaptor proteins 
14-3-3 bind to hMex-3B but not to the three other hMex-3 family members. Serine 
462, when phosphorylated, is the major 14-3-3 docking site on hMex-3B, and 
manipulation of this interaction reveals that 14-3-3 both stabilizes hMex-3B and 
modulates its ability to bind RNA. Furthermore, the complex formed between 
hMex-3B and Argonaute proteins is excluded from PBs when the interaction with 
14-3-3 is disrupted, whereas the recruitment to SG is not affected. Thus, 14-3-3 
exerts combined effects on hMex-3B and acts as a major regulator of the sorting 
between distinct classes of RNA granules.
