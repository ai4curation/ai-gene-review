The transcription and processing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells are regulated 
in part by reversible phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest 
RNA polymerase (RNAP) II subunit. The CTD phosphatase, FCP1, catalyzes the 
dephosphorylation of RNAP II and is thought to play a major role in polymerase 
recycling. This study describes a family of small CTD phosphatases (SCPs) that 
preferentially catalyze the dephosphorylation of Ser5 within the consensus 
repeat. The preferred substrate for SCP1 is RNAP II phosphorylated by TFIIH. 
Like FCP1, the activity of SCP1 is enhanced by the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF. 
Expression of SCP1 inhibits activated transcription from a number of promoters, 
whereas a phosphatase-inactive mutant of SCP1 enhances transcription. 
Accordingly, SCP1 may play a role in the regulation of gene expression, possibly 
by controlling the transition from initiation/capping to processive transcript 
elongation.
