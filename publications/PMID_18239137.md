Notch signaling regulates smooth muscle cell phenotype and is critical for 
vascular development. One Notch target is smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA), a 
differentiated smooth muscle cell marker. The Notch intracellular domain 
(NotchICD) forms a complex with CBF-1 (C-promoter-binding factor-1) and directly 
induces SMA expression. Using primary human smooth muscle cells, we show that 
expression of the constitutive active ICD of human Notch1, Notch2, or Notch4 
receptors increase SMA levels. NotchICD also induce expression of the 
transcriptional repressors HRT1 (Hairy-related transcription factor 1) and HRT2, 
in a CBF-1-dependent manner. However, unlike the activating effects of NotchICD, 
HRT1 or HRT2 represses basal SMA expression, and both are strong antagonists of 
NotchICD-induced SMA upregulation. This antagonism does not depend on histone 
deacetylase activity and occurs at the transcriptional level. Competitive 
coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that HRT does not disrupt the 
association of NotchICD and CBF-1, which form a complex in the presence or 
absence of HRTs. However, HRT suppresses NotchICD/CBF-1 binding to the SMA 
promoter, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transactivation of 
an SMA promoter reporter spanning sequences -124/+32. SMA expression was 
regulated similarly following endogenous Notch activation in smooth muscle cells 
by coculture with endothelial cells, and this effect was also sensitive to HRT 
inhibition. Temporally defined HRT activity may constitute a negative feedback 
mechanism of Notch signaling. Our study presents a novel mechanism by which a 
balance between Notch signaling and HRT activity determines the expression of 
smooth muscle differentiation markers including SMA.
