One of the major limitations for understanding the biology of human mesenchymal 
stem cells (hMSCs) is the absence of prospective markers needed for 
distinguishing them from other cells and for monitoring lineage-specific 
differentiation. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has proven extremely 
useful for analyzing complex protein expression patterns and, when applied 
quantitatively, can be used to resolve subtle differences between samples. Thus, 
we used MS to characterize changes in expression of membrane protein markers 
before and after short-term induction of osteoblast (OB) differentiation in a 
cell model of hMSCs established by overexpression of human telomerase 
reverse-transcriptase gene. We identified 463 unique proteins with extremely 
high confidence, including all known markers of hMSCs (e.g., SH3 [CD71], SH2 
[CD105], CD166, CD44, Thy1, CD29, and HOP26 [CD63]) among 148 integral membrane 
or membrane-anchored proteins and 159 membrane-associated proteins. Twenty-nine 
integrins and cell adhesion molecules, 20 receptors, and 18 Ras-related small 
GTPases were also identified. Upon OB differentiation, the expression levels of 
83 proteins increased by at least twofold whereas the levels of another 21 
decreased by at least twofold. For example, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), versican 
core protein, and tenascin increased 27-, 12-, and 4-fold, respectively, and 
fatty acid synthase decreased sixfold. The observed increases in veriscan and 
ALP were confirmed using immunocytochemistry and cytochemistry. Quantitative 
real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence 
of mRNA of these membrane proteins. However, with the exception of ALP, no 
concordance was detected between the changes in levels of gene and protein 
expression during OB differentiation. In conclusion, MS-based proteomics can 
reveal novel markers for MSCs that can be used for their isolation and for 
monitoring OB differentiation.
