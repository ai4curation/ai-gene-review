We have investigated the role of Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) in 
NGF-induced neuronal differentiation by overexpressing both wild-type and 
membrane-targeted GAP in PC12 cells. Extension of neurites in response to NGF 
was completely blocked in cells expressing the highest level of 
membrane-targeted GAP and significantly inhibited in cells expressing either 
wild-type GAP or lower levels of membrane-targeted GAP. Overexpression of 
membrane-targeted GAP similarly inhibited induction of differentiation by src, 
but not by ras or raf oncogenes, indicating that GAP inhibits differentiation of 
PC12 cells by downregulating Ras function. GAP overexpression also inhibited 
stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and induction of 
immediate-early genes in response to NGF. In cells expressing wild-type GAP or 
lower levels of membrane-targeted GAP, the initial activation of MAP kinase and 
immediate-early gene expression were only partially inhibited. However, GAP 
expression in these cells resulted in substantial inhibition of sustained MAP 
kinase activity following NGF treatment, consistent with the inhibition of 
neurite extension in these cell lines. These results indicate that GAP acts as a 
negative regulation, rather than an effector, of Ras signaling in PC12 cells.
