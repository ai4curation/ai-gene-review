The mammalian cytoplasmic protein SirT2 is a member of the Sir2 family of 
NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases involved in caloric restriction-dependent 
life span extension. We found that SirT2 and its yeast counterpart Hst2 have a 
strong preference for histone H4K16Ac in their deacetylation activity in vitro 
and in vivo. We have pinpointed the decrease in global levels of H4K16Ac during 
the mammalian cell cycle to the G2/M transition that coincides with SirT2 
localization on chromatin. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for 
SirT2 show higher levels of H4K16Ac in mitosis, in contrast to the normal levels 
exhibited by SirT1-deficient MEFs. The enzymatic conversion of H4K16Ac to its 
deacetylated form may be pivotal to the formation of condensed chromatin. Thus, 
SirT2 is a major contributor to this enzymatic conversion at the time in the 
cell's life cycle when condensed chromatin must be generated anew.
