The chaperone system formed by DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE mediates stress-dependent 
negative modulation of the Escherichia coli heat shock response, probably 
through association with the heat shock promoter-specific sigma32 subunit of RNA 
polymerase. Interactions of the DnaK system with sigma32 were analysed. DnaJ and 
DnaK bind free, but not RNA polymerase-bound, sigma32 with dissociation 
constants of 20 nM and 5 muM respectively. Association and dissociation rates of 
DnaJ-sigma32 complexes are 5900- and 20-fold higher respectively than those of 
DnaK-sigma32 complexes in the absence of ATP. ATP destabilizes DnaK-sigma32 
interactions. DnaJ, through rapid association with sigma32 and stimulation of 
hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP, mediates efficient binding of DnaK to sigma32 in 
the presence of ATP, resulting in DnaK-DnaJ-sigma32 complexes containing ADP. 
GrpE binding to these complexes stimulates nucleotide release and subsequent 
complex dissociation by ATP. We propose that the principles of this cycle also 
operate in other chaperone activities of the DnaK system. DnaK and DnaJ 
cooperatively inhibit sigma32 activity in heat shock gene transcription and GrpE 
partially reverses this inhibition. These data indicate that reversible 
inhibition of sigma32 activity through transient association of DnaK and DnaJ is 
a central regulatory element of the heat shock response.
