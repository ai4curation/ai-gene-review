Lysine lactylation is a post-translational modification that links cellular 
metabolism to protein function. Here, we find that AARS1 functions as a lactate 
sensor that mediates global lysine lacylation in tumor cells. AARS1 binds to 
lactate and catalyzes the formation of lactate-AMP, followed by transfer of 
lactate to the lysince acceptor residue. Proteomics studies reveal a large 
number of AARS1 targets, including p53 where lysine 120 and lysine 139 in the 
DNA binding domain are lactylated. Generation and utilization of p53 variants 
carrying constitutively lactylated lysine residues revealed that AARS1 
lactylation of p53 hinders its liquid-liquid phase separation, DNA binding, and 
transcriptional activation. AARS1 expression and p53 lacylation correlate with 
poor prognosis among cancer patients carrying wild type p53. β-alanine disrupts 
lactate binding to AARS1, reduces p53 lacylation, and mitigates tumorigenesis in 
animal models. We propose that AARS1 contributes to tumorigenesis by coupling 
tumor cell metabolism to proteome alteration.
