The stress-responsive p38 and JNK MAPK pathways regulate cell cycle and 
apoptosis. A human MAPKKK, MTK1 (= MEKK4), mediates activation of both p38 and 
JNK in response to environmental stresses. Using a yeast two-hybrid method, 
three related proteins, GADD45alpha (= GADD45), GADD45, (= MyD118), and 
GADD45gamma, were identified that bound to an N-terminal domain of MTK1. These 
proteins activated MTK1 kinase activity, both in vivo and in vitro. The 
GADD45-like genes are induced by environmental stresses, including MMS, UV, and 
gamma irradiation. Expression of the GADD45-like genes induces p38/JNK 
activation and apoptosis, which can be partially suppressed by coexpression of a 
dominant inhibitory MTK1 mutant protein. We propose that the GADD45-like 
proteins mediate activation of the p38/JNK pathway, via MTK1/ MEKK4, in response 
to environmental stresses.
