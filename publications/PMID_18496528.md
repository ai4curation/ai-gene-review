Dopamine orchestrates motor behaviour and reward-driven learning. Perturbations 
of dopamine signalling have been implicated in several neurological and 
psychiatric disorders, and in drug addiction. The actions of dopamine are 
mediated in part by the regulation of gene expression in the striatum, through 
mechanisms that are not fully understood. Here we show that drugs of abuse, as 
well as food reinforcement learning, promote the nuclear accumulation of 32-kDa 
dopamine-regulated and cyclic-AMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32). This 
accumulation is mediated through a signalling cascade involving dopamine D1 
receptors, cAMP-dependent activation of protein phosphatase-2A, 
dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Ser 97 and inhibition of its nuclear export. 
The nuclear accumulation of DARPP-32, a potent inhibitor of protein 
phosphatase-1, increases the phosphorylation of histone H3, an important 
component of nucleosomal response. Mutation of Ser 97 profoundly alters 
behavioural effects of drugs of abuse and decreases motivation for food, 
underlining the functional importance of this signalling cascade.
