The unfolded protein response (UPR), caused by stress, matches the folding 
capacity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the load of client proteins in the 
organelle. In yeast, processing of HAC1 mRNA by activated Ire1 leads to 
synthesis of the transcription factor Hac1 and activation of the UPR. The 
responses to activated IRE1 in metazoans are less well understood. Here we 
demonstrate that mutations in either ire-1 or the transcription-factor-encoding 
xbp-1 gene abolished the UPR in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mammalian XBP-1 is 
essential for immunoglobulin secretion and development of plasma cells, and high 
levels of XBP-1 messenger RNA are found in specialized secretory cells. 
Activation of the UPR causes IRE1-dependent splicing of a small intron from the 
XBP-1 mRNA both in C. elegans and mice. The protein encoded by the processed 
murine XBP-1 mRNA accumulated during the UPR, whereas the protein encoded by 
unprocessed mRNA did not. Purified mouse IRE1 accurately cleaved XBP-1 mRNA in 
vitro, indicating that XBP-1 mRNA is a direct target of IRE1 endonucleolytic 
activity. Our findings suggest that physiological ER load regulates a 
developmental decision in higher eukaryotes.
