We have investigated the interaction between Cbl and the Src-related tyrosine 
kinase Fyn. Fyn was observed to be constitutively associated with Cbl in lysates 
of several different cell types including the interleukin-3-dependent murine 
myeloid cell line 32Dcl3, and the prolactin-dependent rat thymoma cell line Nb2. 
Binding studies indicated that Cbl could bind to glutathione S-transferase (GST) 
fusion proteins encoding the unique, Src homology domain 3 (SH3), and SH2 
domains of Fyn, Hck, or Lyn. Fusion proteins encoding either the SH3 or SH2 
domains of Fyn bound to Cbl as effectively as the fusion protein encoding the 
unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of Fyn. The Fyn SH2 domain bound to both 
tyrosine-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Cbl, implying that this 
interaction might be phosphotyrosine-independent. Binding of the Fyn SH2 domain 
to Cbl was not disrupted by the addition of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, or 
phosphothreonine. A GST fusion protein encoding the proline-rich region of Cbl 
bound to Fyn present in a total cell lysate. Far Western blot analysis also 
indicated that the SH3 domain of Fyn bound preferentially to the proline-rich 
region of Cbl. The addition of [gamma-32P]ATP to either anti-Cbl 
immunoprecipitates or anti-Fyn immunoprecipitates resulted in the 
phosphorylation of both Cbl and Fyn as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of 
the phosphorylated proteins with specific antisera. Fyn directly phosphorylated 
a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal region of Cbl (GST-CBL-LZIP). In 
contrast, immunoprecipitated JAK2 was not able to phosphorylate this same region 
of Cbl. The GST-CBL-LZIP fusion protein contains a binding site for the SH2 
domain of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which mapped to 
Tyr731, which is present in the sequence YEAM. Mutation of Tyr731 in 
GST-CBL-LZIP eliminated binding of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase and substantially reduced the phosphorylation of this fusion protein by 
Fyn, despite the presence of four other tyrosine residues in this fusion 
protein. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Cbl represents a 
substrate for Src-like kinases that are activated in response to the engagement 
of cell surface receptors, and that Src-like kinases are responsible for the 
phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in Cbl that may regulate activation of 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
