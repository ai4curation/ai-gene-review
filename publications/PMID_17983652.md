Embryo implantation is a complex process that requires coordinated 
trophoblast-endometrial interactions. During implantation, trophoblast cells of 
the attached blastocyst penetrate the luminal epithelium of the endometrium 
before invasion into the endometrial stroma. Previous studies demonstrated that 
calcitonin was actively secreted by rat and human endometrial epithelial cells 
(EEC) during the implantation window and targeted disruption of endometrial 
calcitonin expression dramatically decreased embryo implantation rates; however, 
the role and signal transduction of calcitonin in trophoblast-endometrial 
interactions remained unclear and are therefore examined in this study. BeWo 
trophoblast and RL95-2 EEC lines were used because they preserve many properties 
of their respective normal tissues. We co-cultured BeWo trophoblast spheroids 
with RL95-2 EEC monolayers to mimic the blastocyst-endometrial interaction, and 
found that most spheroids quickly attached to EEC monolayers and then 
progressively expanded, with marked displacement of EEC adjacent to the 
outgrowing trophoblast cells. Interestingly, pretreatment of EEC monolayers with 
calcitonin before the addition of spheroids significantly enhanced trophoblast 
expansion on EEC monolayers. Cytosolic calcium (Ca(2+)) levels in EEC increased 
rapidly upon exposure to calcitonin, and blockade of Ca(2+) release by BAPTA-AM 
effectively prevented the promoting effect of calcitonin on trophoblast 
expansion on EEC. The Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) was also activated 
in EEC after calcitonin treatment, and the PKC inhibitors staurosporine and 
calphostin C could completely abolish calcitonin-induced augmentation of 
trophoblast expansion on EEC. Our results suggest that calcitonin promotes 
trophoblastic displacement of EEC through calcium mobilization and PKC 
activation, thereby facilitating embryo implantation.
