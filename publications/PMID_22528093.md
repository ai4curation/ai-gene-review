'Amyloid binging proteins' is a generic term used to designate proteins that 
interact with different forms of amyloidogenic peptides or proteins and that, as 
a result, may modulate their physiological and pathological functions by 
altering solubility, transport, clearance, degradation, and fibril formation. We 
describe a simple affinity chromatography protocol to isolate and characterize 
amyloid-binding proteins based on the use of sequential elution steps that may 
provide further information on the type of binding interaction. As an example, 
we depict the application of this protocol to the study of Alzheimer's amyloid β 
(Aβ) peptide-binding proteins derived from human plasma. Biochemical analysis of 
the proteins eluted under different conditions identified serum amyloid P 
component (SAP) and apolipoprotein J (clusterin) as the main plasma Aβ-binding 
proteins while various apolipoproteins (apoA-IV, apoE, and apoA-I), as well as 
albumin (HSA) and fibulin were identified as minor contributors.
