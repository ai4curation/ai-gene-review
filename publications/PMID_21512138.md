Like many carcinomas, urothelial carcinoma (UroCa) is associated with chronic 
injury. A better understanding of this association could inform improved 
strategies for preventing and treating this disease. We investigated the 
expression, regulation, and function of the transcriptional regulator 
SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (Sox9) in urothelial development, injury 
repair, and cancer. In mouse bladders, Sox9 levels were high during periods of 
prenatal urothelial development and diminished with maturation after birth. In 
adult urothelial cells, Sox9 was quiescent but was rapidly induced by a variety 
of injuries, including exposure to the carcinogen cyclophosphamide, culture with 
hydrogen peroxide, and osmotic stress. Activation of extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) was required for Sox9 induction in 
urothelial injury and resulted from activation of the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (Egfr) by several Egfr ligands that were dramatically induced by 
injury. In UroCa cell lines, SOX9 expression was constitutively upregulated and 
could be suppressed by EGFR or ERK1/2 blockade. Gene knockdown showed a role for 
SOX9 in cell migration and invasion. Accordingly, SOX9 protein levels were 
preferentially induced in invasive human UroCa tissue samples (n = 84) compared 
with noninvasive cancers (n = 56) or benign adjacent urothelium (n = 49). These 
results identify a novel, potentially oncogenic signaling axis linking 
urothelial injury to UroCa. Inhibiting this axis is feasible through a variety 
of pharmacologic approaches and may have clinical utility.
