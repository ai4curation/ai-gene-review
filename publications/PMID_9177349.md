The proper folding of newly synthesized membrane proteins in the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) is required for the formation of functional mature proteins. 
Calnexin is a ubiquitous ER chaperone that plays a major role in quality control 
by retaining incompletely folded or misfolded proteins. In contrast to other 
known chaperones such as heat-shock proteins, BiP and calreticulin, calnexin is 
an integral membrane protein. Calmegin is a testis-specific ER protein that is 
homologous to calnexin. Here we show that calmegin binds to nascent polypeptides 
during spermatogenesis, and have analysed its physiological function by targeted 
disruption of its gene. Homozygous-null male mice are nearly sterile even though 
spermatogenesis is morphologically normal and mating is normal. In vitro, sperm 
from homozygous-null males do not adhere to the egg extracellular matrix (zona 
pellucida), and this defect may explain the observed infertility. These results 
suggest that calmegin functions as a chaperone for one or more sperm surface 
proteins that mediate the interactions between sperm and egg. The defective zona 
pellucida-adhesion phenotype of sperm from calmegin-deficient mice is 
reminiscent of certain cases of unexplained infertility in human males.
