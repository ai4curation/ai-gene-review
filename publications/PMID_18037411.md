TRPP2 (transient receptor potential polycystin-2) channels function in a range 
of cells where they are localized to specific subcellular regions including the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and primary cilium. In humans, TRPP2/PC-2 mutations 
severely compromise kidney function and cause autosomal dominant polycystic 
kidney disease (ADPKD). The Caenorhabditis elegans TRPP2 homolog, PKD-2, is 
restricted to the somatodendritic (cell body and dendrite) and ciliary 
compartments of male specific sensory neurons. Within these neurons PKD-2 
function is required for sensation. To understand the mechanisms regulating 
TRPP2 subcellular distribution and activity, we performed in vivo 
structure-function-localization studies using C. elegans as a model system. Our 
data demonstrate that somatodendritic and ciliary targeting requires the 
transmembrane (TM) region of PKD-2 and that the PKD-2 cytosolic termini regulate 
subcellular distribution and function. Within neuronal cell bodies, PKD-2 
colocalizes with the OSM-9 TRP vanilloid (TRPV) channel, suggesting that these 
TRPP and TRPV channels may function in a common process. When human TRPP2/PC-2 
is heterologously expressed in transgenic C. elegans animals, PC-2 does not 
visibly localize to cilia but does partially rescue pkd-2 null mutant defects, 
suggesting that human PC-2 and PKD-2 are functional homologs.
