Biogenesis of the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster is an indispensable process in 
living cells. In mammalian mitochondria, the initial step of the Fe-S cluster 
assembly process is assisted by the NFS1-ISD11 complex, which delivers sulfur to 
scaffold protein ISCU during Fe-S cluster synthesis. Although ISD11 is an 
essential protein, its cellular role in Fe-S cluster biogenesis is still not 
defined. Our study maps the important ISD11 amino acid residues belonging to 
putative helix 1 (Phe-40), helix 3 (Leu-63, Arg-68, Gln-69, Ile-72, Tyr-76), and 
C-terminal segment (Leu-81, Glu-84) are critical for in vivo Fe-S cluster 
biogenesis. Importantly, mutation of these conserved ISD11 residues into alanine 
leads to its compromised interaction with NFS1, resulting in reduced stability 
and enhanced aggregation of NFS1 in the mitochondria. Due to altered interaction 
with ISD11 mutants, the levels of NFS1 and Isu1 were significantly depleted, 
which affects Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, leading to reduced electron transport 
chain complex (ETC) activity and mitochondrial respiration. In humans, a 
clinically relevant ISD11 mutation (R68L) has been associated in the development 
of a mitochondrial genetic disorder, COXPD19. Our findings highlight that the 
ISD11 R68A/R68L mutation display reduced affinity to form a stable subcomplex 
with NFS1, and thereby fails to prevent NFS1 aggregation resulting in impairment 
of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis. The prime affected machinery is the ETC complex, 
which showed compromised redox properties, causing diminished mitochondrial 
respiration. Furthermore, the R68L ISD11 mutant displayed accumulation of 
mitochondrial iron and reactive oxygen species, leading to mitochondrial 
dysfunction, which correlates with the phenotype observed in COXPD19 patients.
