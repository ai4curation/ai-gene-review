The mammalian Ajuba LIM proteins (Ajuba, LIMD1, and WTIP) are adaptor proteins 
that exhibit the potential to communicate cell adhesive events with nuclear 
responses to remodel epithelia. Determining their role in vivo, however, has 
been challenging due to overlapping tissue expression and functional redundancy. 
Thus, we turned to Drosophila, where a single gene, CG11063 or djub, exists. 
Drosophila lacking the djub gene or depleted of dJub by RNA interference 
identify djub as an essential gene for development and a novel regulator of 
epithelial organ size as a component of the conserved Hippo (Hpo) pathway, which 
has been implicated in both tissue size control and cancer development. 
djub-deficient tissues were small and had decreased cell numbers as a result of 
increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, due to downregulation of DIAP1 
and cyclin E. This phenocopies tissues deficient for Yorkie (Yki), the 
downstream target of the Hippo pathway. djub genetically interacts with the 
Hippo pathway, and epistasis suggests that djub lies downstream of hpo. In 
mammalian and Drosophila cells, Ajuba LIM proteins/dJub interact with LATS/Warts 
(Wts) and WW45/Sav to inhibit phosphorylation of YAP/Yki. This work describes a 
novel role for the Ajuba LIM proteins as negative regulators of the Hippo 
signaling pathway.
