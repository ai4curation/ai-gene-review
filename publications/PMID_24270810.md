An increasing body of evidence points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a 
contributor to the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Parkinson's disease. Recent studies of the Parkinson's disease associated genes 
PINK1 (ref. 2) and parkin (PARK2, ref. 3) indicate that they may act in a 
quality control pathway preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional 
mitochondria. Here we elucidate regulators that have an impact on parkin 
translocation to damaged mitochondria with genome-wide small interfering RNA 
(siRNA) screens coupled to high-content microscopy. Screening yielded gene 
candidates involved in diverse cellular processes that were subsequently 
validated in low-throughput assays. This led to characterization of TOMM7 as 
essential for stabilizing PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane following 
mitochondrial damage. We also discovered that HSPA1L (HSP70 family member) and 
BAG4 have mutually opposing roles in the regulation of parkin translocation. The 
screens revealed that SIAH3, found to localize to mitochondria, inhibits PINK1 
accumulation after mitochondrial insult, reducing parkin translocation. Overall, 
our screens provide a rich resource to understand mitochondrial quality control.
