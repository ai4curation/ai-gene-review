Previous studies have demonstrated that the Escherichia coli dnaK and grpE genes 
code for heat shock proteins. Both the Dnak and GrpE proteins are necessary for 
bacteriophage lambda DNA replication and for E. coli growth at all temperatures. 
Through a series of genetic and biochemical experiments, we have shown that 
these heat shock proteins functionally interact both in vivo and in vitro. The 
genetic evidence is based on the isolation of mutations in the dnaK gene, such 
as dnaK9 and dnaK90, which suppress the Tr- phenotype of bacteria carrying the 
grpE280 mutation. Coimmunoprecipitation of DnaK+ and GrpE+ proteins from cell 
lysates with anti-DnaK antibodies demonstrated their interaction in vitro. In 
addition, the DnaK756 and GrpE280 mutant proteins did not coimmunoprecipitate 
efficiently with the GrpE+ and DnaK+ proteins, respectively, suggesting that 
interaction between the DnaK and GrpE proteins is necessary for E. coli growth, 
at least at temperatures above 43 degrees C. Using this assay, we found that one 
of the dnaK suppressor mutations, dnaK9, reinstated a protein-protein 
interaction between the suppressor DnaK9 and GrpE280 proteins.
