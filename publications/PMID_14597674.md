Connector enhancer of KSR (CNK) is a multidomain protein that participates in 
Ras signaling in Drosophila eye development. In this report we identify the 
human homologue of CNK, termed CNK2A, and a truncated alternatively spliced 
variant, CNK2B. We characterize CNK2 phosphorylation, membrane localization, and 
interaction with Ras effector molecules. Our results show that MAPK signaling 
appears to play a role in the phosphorylation of CNK2 in vivo. CNK2 is found in 
both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of the cell. In MDCK cells, full-length 
CNK2 is localized to the lateral plasma membrane. Consistent with previous 
reports, we show CNK2 interacts with Raf. CNK2 interaction was mapped to the 
regulatory and kinase domains of Raf, as well as to the carboxyl-terminal half 
of CNK2. CNK2 also interacts with the Ral signaling components, Ral GTPase, and 
the RalGDS family member Rlf. CNK2 interaction was mapped to the GEF domain of 
Rlf. The ability of CNK2 to interact with both Ras effector proteins Raf and Rlf 
suggests that CNK2 may integrate signals between MAPK and Ral pathways through a 
complex interplay of components.
