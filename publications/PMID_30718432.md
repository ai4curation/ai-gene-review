Necroptosis and ferroptosis are two distinct necrotic cell death modalities with 
no known common molecular mechanisms. Necroptosis is activated by ligands of 
death receptors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) under caspase-deficient 
conditions, whereas ferroptosis is mediated by the accumulation of lipid 
peroxides upon the depletion/or inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). 
The molecular mechanism that mediates the execution of ferroptosis remains 
unclear. In this study, we identified 2-amino-5-chloro-N,3-dimethylbenzamide 
(CDDO), a compound known to inhibit heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), as an 
inhibitor of necroptosis that could also inhibit ferroptosis. We found that 
HSP90 defined a common regulatory nodal between necroptosis and ferroptosis. We 
showed that inhibition of HSP90 by CDDO blocked necroptosis by inhibiting the 
activation of RIPK1 kinase. Furthermore, we showed that the activation of 
ferroptosis by erastin increased the levels of lysosome-associated membrane 
protein 2a to promote chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), which, in turn, 
promoted the degradation of GPX4. Importantly, inhibition of CMA stabilized GPX4 
and reduced ferroptosis. Our results suggest that activation of CMA is involved 
in the execution of ferroptosis.
