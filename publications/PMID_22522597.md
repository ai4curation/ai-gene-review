p53 is a key regulator of cell growth and death by controlling cell cycle 
progression and apoptosis under conditions of stress such as DNA damage or 
oncogenic stimulation. As these processes are critical for cell function and 
inhibition of tumor development, p53 regulatory pathways are strictly monitored 
in cells. Recently, it was recognized that nucleolar proteins, including 
nucleophosmin/B23, ribosomal protein L11, and alternate reading frame (ARF), 
form the nucleolus-ARF-murine double minute 2 (MDM2) axis in p53 regulatory 
pathways, which increases p53 stability by suppressing the activity of MDM2. In 
this work, we show that nucleolar protein glioma tumor-suppressor candidate 
region gene 2 (GLTSCR2) translocates to the nucleoplasm under ribosomal stress, 
where it interacts with and stabilizes p53 and inhibits cell cycle progression 
without the involvement of the major upstream p53 regulator, ARF. Furthermore, 
ectopic expression of GLTSCR2 significantly suppressed growth of cancer cells in 
a xenograft animal model via p53-dependent pathway. Our data identify GLTSCR2 as 
a new member of the nucleolus-nucleoplasmic axis for p53 regulation. 
ARF-independent direct regulation of p53 by GLTSCR2 may be a key mechanism and 
therapeutic target for cell death or growth inhibition when nucleolus-ARF-p53 
pathways are inactivated by genetic or epigenetic modifications of ARF, which 
are the second most common types of genetic change observed in human cancers.

Abstract

p53 is a key regulator of cell growth and death by controlling cell cycle progression and apoptosis under conditions of stress such as DNA damage or oncogenic stimulation. As these processes are critical for cell function and inhibition of tumor development, p53 regulatory pathways are strictly monitored in cells. Recently, it was recognized that nucleolar proteins, including nucleophosmin/B23, ribosomal protein L11, and alternate reading frame (ARF), form the nucleolus-ARF-murine double minute 2 (MDM2) axis in p53 regulatory pathways, which increases p53 stability by suppressing the activity of MDM2. In this work, we show that nucleolar protein glioma tumor-suppressor candidate region gene 2 (GLTSCR2) translocates to the nucleoplasm under ribosomal stress, where it interacts with and stabilizes p53 and inhibits cell cycle progression without the involvement of the major upstream p53 regulator, ARF. Furthermore, ectopic expression of GLTSCR2 significantly suppressed growth of cancer cells in a xenograft animal model via p53-dependent pathway. Our data identify GLTSCR2 as a new member of the nucleolus–nucleoplasmic axis for p53 regulation. ARF-independent direct regulation of p53 by GLTSCR2 may be a key mechanism and therapeutic target for cell death or growth inhibition when nucleolus-ARF-p53 pathways are inactivated by genetic or epigenetic modifications of ARF, which are the second most common types of genetic change observed in human cancers.

Discussion

The nucleolus is an organelle of the interphase cell nucleus where the biogenesis of ribosomes occurs. Thus, cell proliferation processes with high biosynthetic demands are closely coordinated with nucleolar function. 28 In addition to ribosome biogenesis, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the nucleolus directly controls the cell cycle and cell death in certain physiological and pathological states including cancers. 29 Regulation of these functions by the nucleolus is accomplished by a meshwork of proteins encompassing the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. One of the crucial protein axes responsible for cell cycle and cell death regulation is the nucleolus-MDM2-p53 pathway, in which nucleolar proteins control the stability of p53 mainly through the inhibition of MDM2 activity. 15 , 22 , 30 For example, ARF 13 and NS 12 are released from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, where they bind MDM2 to suppress MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. NPM also participates in ARF-dependent or -independent regulatory mechanisms of p53 stability control. 31 , 32 These findings demonstrate the importance of nucleolar proteins in p53 regulation. Here, we identified GLTSCR2 as another member of the family of nucleolar proteins that regulate cellular p53 levels in response to ribosomal stress.

Results of immunoprecipitation, pull-down, and transfection assays of wild-type and mutant GLTSCR2 indicate that GLTSCR2 directly binds to p53 and that the interaction of GLTSCR2 with p53 is crucial for translational upregulation of its binding partner, p53. Previous reports showed that competition with MDM2 for p53 binding and the resulting interference with MDM2-dependent ubiquitination is the key molecular mechanism by which some nucleolar proteins regulate p53 stability. 33 However, our results show that GLTSCR2 does not directly interact with MDM2 while GLTSCR2 stabilizes p53 in ARF -deleted A549 cells by inhibiting MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. ARF is a major upstream activator of p53 and functions as a tumor suppressor against oncogenic stimulation. 34 However, the ARF gene is commonly mutated, deleted, or silenced, and the frequency of ARF inactivation in human cancer is second only to the loss of p53 . 16 In cells in which ARF is inactivated by genetic or epigenetic events, the ARF-MDM2-p53 axis is disrupted and p53 is inactivated. 35 Under conditions where the ARF-MDM2-p53 axis is dysregulated, GLTSCR2 might have a key role in p53 activation through an ARF-independent pathway. Therefore, we suggest that GLTSCR2 exerts cell cycle and cell death regulation through direct p53 activation in tumors lacking functional ARF.

Appropriate subcellular localization is crucial for the regulation of p53 function. Export of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is mediated by a nucleas export signal (NES; residues 340–351) located in its TTD. 36 The masking and unmasking of NES within oligomers may be a general mechanism regulating the subcellular localization of p53. Stommel et al. 36 demonstrated that p53 tetramerization occludes its NES, thereby leading to nuclear retention of the DNA-binding form. In contrast, the conversion of tetramers into monomers or dimers exposes the p53 NES to the proteins that mediate export to the cytoplasm. Our deletion mapping studies show that the TTD involving the p53 NES is important for GLTSCR2–p53 interaction. In addition, our oligomerization assay shows that formation of the tetramer form of p53 is increased upon GLTSCR2 overexpression. In this process, physical interactions between GLTSCR2 and p53 seem to be important because M3 and M4 GLTSCR2 mutants, which contain only one p53-binding motif, have low potential to form p53 tetramer. Our results suggest that GLTSCR2–p53 interaction is a crucial mechanism preventing MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. Contrary to our results, however, tetrameric p53 is thought to bind MDM2 with higher affinity than monomeric form and tetramerization is required for p53 to be efficiently ubiquitinated by MDM2. 27 , 37 These contradictory results may be explained in part by a previous report, indicating that the C-terminal TTD of p53 is also required for efficient MDM2 binding and ubiquitination, although the MDM2-binding site in p53 is located in the N-terminus of p53. 38 It is possible that GLTSCR2 binding to the TTD of p53 assumes a more complex tertiary structure, which reduces the affinity to MDM2 otherwise increased by tetramerization.

Our results indicate that GLTSCR2 has a role in p53 stability control through direct interaction with p53. However, the majority of cellular GLTSCR2 is in the nucleolus, not in the nucleoplasm where p53 and MDM2 are located. This raises questions about how nucleolar GLTSCR2 forms a complex with p53. We showed that GLTSCR2 was redistributed from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in response to ribosomal stresses, such as hypoxia or Act-D, and the interaction of GLTSCR2 with p53 increased in parallel with the nucleoplasmic mobilization of GLTSCR2 ( Figure 6 ). Together with our recent report that GLTSCR2 is translocated to the nucleoplasm in response to DNA damage, 39 this finding indicates that GLTSCR2 is a dynamic protein that shuttles between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, similar to other p53-regulating nucleolar proteins such as NPM and NS. 8 , 12

Nucleolar proteins interact with each other to form intricate networks for the regulation of p53. For instance, NPM directly interacts with p53 or nucleolar ARF to regulate MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. 15 , 21 , 22 NS, another nucleolar protein regulating MDM2 stability, 12 interacts with NPM, 40 forming a complicated meshwork of p53-regulating proteins. It is possible that GLTSCR2 may interact and function in concert with other nucleolar proteins involved in nucleolus-p53 regulatory axes. We are now studying the role of GLTSCR2 in NPM-MDM2-p53 axis.

Recently, Sasaki et al. 41 reported that GLTSCR2 (also known as PICT1) decreases p53 stability through RPL11-dependent pathway. Using GLTSCR2-deficient ES cells, they showed that GLTSCR2 binds RPL11. In the absence of GLTSCR2, RPL11 is released from the nucleolus to block the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53, thereby inhibiting cell cycle progression. The findings of Sasaki et al. contradict our findings. However, the NS-MDM2 axis model of p53 regulation can explain the discrepancies between study results, at least in part. NS has a dual role in p53 regulation: both up and downregulation of NS activate the p53 pathway to inhibit cell cycle progression. Depletion of NS induced the interactions of RPL5 and RPL11 with MDM2, which suppress MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. 42 , 43 This mechanism is similar to that observed in GLTSCR2-deficient cells. Paradoxically, aberrant overexpression of NS also prevents p53 degradation through the inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination by the physical interaction of NS with MDM2. 43 The nucleoplasmic release of GLTSCR2 and interactions of GLTSCR2 and p53 may have a crucial role in p53 regulation under physiological conditions or GLTSCR2 overexpression. In conditions of GLTSCR2 deficiency, however, the p53 regulatory mechanism of GLTSCR2 through nucleoplasmic mobilization is not activated, which may induce the activation of alternative pathways such as RPL11-mediated suppression of MDM2 to maintain p53 stability, as shown by Sasaki et al. 41 Thus, the release of RPL11 from the nucleolus and interaction with MDM2 may be a major mechanism of p53 activation in GLTSCR2 deficiency. These discrepant results concerning GLTSCR2 imply that tight regulation of GLTSCR2 expression level is important for cellular homeostasis, and that stresses inducing perturbations of cellular GLTSCR2 levels activate p53.

In summary, we show that GLTSCR2 translationally upregulates p53 by increasing p53 stability. After exposure to ribosomal stresses, such as hypoxia and Act-D, GLTSCR2 is mobilized from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm leading to enhanced formation of the p53–GLTSCR2 complex, which interferes with the degradation of p53 by inhibiting MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. This GLTSCR2-p53 regulatory axis functions without the involvement of ARF, a major p53-upstream activator. Therefore, our data indicate that GLTSCR2 is a key upstream regulator of p53 in cancers in which ARF is inactivated by genetic or epigenetic events. Furthermore, GLTSCR2 could be a therapeutic target for the induction of cancer cell death in cases with inactivated nucleolus-ARF-p53 axis.
