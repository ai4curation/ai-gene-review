Bacterial cell division requires the coordinated action of cell division 
proteins and murein (peptidoglycan) synthases. Interactions involving the 
essential cell division protein FtsN and murein synthases were studied by 
affinity chromatography with membrane fraction. The murein synthases PBP1A, 
PBP1B, and PBP3 had an affinity to immobilized FtsN. FtsN and PBP3, but not 
PBP1A, showed an affinity to immobilized PBP1B. The direct interaction between 
FtsN and PBP1B was confirmed by pulldown experiments and surface plasmon 
resonance. The interaction was also detected by bacterial two-hybrid analysis. 
FtsN and PBP1B could be cross-linked in intact cells of the wild type and in 
cells depleted of PBP3 or FtsW. FtsN stimulated the in vitro murein synthesis 
activities of PBP1B. Thus, FtsN could have a role in controlling or modulating 
the activity of PBP1B during cell division in Escherichia coli.
