Dbl family members are guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for Rho 
guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and invariably possess tandem Dbl (DH) and 
pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. Dbs, a Dbl family member specific for Cdc42 
and RhoA, exhibits transforming activity when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 mouse 
fibroblasts. In this study, the PH domain of Dbs was mutated to impair 
selectively either guanine nucleotide exchange or phosphoinositide binding in 
vitro and resulting physiological alterations were assessed. As anticipated, 
substitution of residues within the PH domain of Dbs integral to the interface 
with GTPases reduced nucleotide exchange and eliminated the ability of Dbs to 
transform NIH 3T3 cells. More interestingly, substitutions within the PH domain 
that prevent interaction with phosphoinositides yet do not alter in vitro 
activation of GTPases also do not transform NIH 3T3 cell and fail to activate 
RhoA in vivo despite proper subcellular localization. Therefore, the PH domain 
of Dbs serves multiple roles in the activation of GTPases and cannot be viewed 
as a simple membrane-anchoring device. In particular, the data suggest that 
binding of phosphoinositides to the PH domain within the context of membrane 
surfaces may direct orientations or conformations of the linked DH and PH 
domains to regulate GTPases activation.
