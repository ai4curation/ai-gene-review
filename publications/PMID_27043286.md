Inflammasomes form as the result of the intracellular presence of 
danger-associated molecular patterns and mediate the release of active IL-1β, 
which influences a variety of inflammatory responses. Excessive inflammasome 
activation results in severe inflammatory conditions, but physiological IL-1β 
secretion is necessary for intestinal homeostasis. Here, we have described a 
mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation of NLRP3 
at Tyr861. We demonstrated that protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 
(PTPN22), variants in which are associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, 
dephosphorylates NLRP3 upon inflammasome induction, allowing efficient NLRP3 
activation and subsequent IL-1β release. In murine models, PTPN22 deficiency 
resulted in pronounced colitis, increased NLRP3 phosphorylation, but reduced 
levels of mature IL-1β. Conversely, patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) that carried an autoimmunity-associated PTPN22 variant had increased IL-1β 
levels. Together, our results identify tyrosine phosphorylation as an important 
regulatory mechanism for NLRP3 that prevents aberrant inflammasome activation.
