The structure and enzymic activity of xyloglucanase Xgh74A and endoxylanase 
Xyn10D, components in the cellulosomes of cellulose-grown Clostridium 
thermocellum, were determined. Xyn10D is a thermostable endo-1,4-beta-xylanase 
with a module composition identical to Xyn10C (CBM22-GH10-Doc). It hydrolyses 
xylan and mixed-linkage 1,3-1,4-beta-glucan with a temperature optimum of 80 
degrees C. Xyloglucanase Xgh74A contains a catalytic module of GHF74 in addition 
to a C-terminal dockerin module. It hydrolyses every fourth beta-1,4-glucan bond 
in the xyloglucan backbone, thus producing decorated cellotetraose units. Its 
low activity on CMC and lack of activity on amorphous cellulose indicates 
recognition of the xylosidic side chains present in xyloglucan, which is readily 
hydrolysed (295 U mg(-1)). The pattern of the hydrolysis products from tamarind 
xyloglucan resembles that of other GHF74 xyloglucan endoglucanases. The data 
indicate that Xgh74A and Xyn10D contribute to the in vivo degradation of the 
hemicelluloses xyloglucan and xylan by the cellulosome of C. thermocellum. 
Xgh74A is the first xyloglucanase identified in C. thermocellum and the only 
enzyme in the cellulosome that hydrolyses tamarind xyloglucan.
