Export of protein into the periplasm of Escherichia coli via the general 
secretory system requires that the transported polypeptides be devoid of stably 
folded tertiary structure. Capture of the precursor polypeptides before they 
fold is achieved by the promiscuous binding to the chaperone SecB. SecB delivers 
its ligand to export sites through its specific binding to SecA, a peripheral 
component of the membrane translocon. At the translocon the ligand is passed 
from SecB to SecA and subsequently through the SecYEG channel. We have 
previously used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance 
spectroscopy to establish a docking model between SecB and SecA. Here we report 
use of the same strategy to map the pathway of a physiologic ligand, the 
unfolded form of precursor galactose-binding protein, on SecB. Our set of SecB 
variants each containing a single cysteine, which was used in the previous 
study, has been expanded to 48 residues, which cover 49% of the surface of SecB. 
The residues on SecB involved in contacts were identified as those that, upon 
addition of the unfolded polypeptide ligand, showed changes in spectral line 
shape consistent with restricted motion of the nitroxide. We conclude that the 
bound precursor makes contact with a large portion of the surface of the small 
chaperone. The sites on SecB that interact with the ligand are compared with the 
previously identified sites that interact with SecA and a model for transfer of 
the ligand is discussed.
