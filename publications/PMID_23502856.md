NLRP3 forms an inflammasome with its adaptor ASC, and its excessive activation 
can cause inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the mechanisms 
that control assembly of the inflammasome complex. Here we show that 
microtubules mediated assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Inducers of the NLRP3 
inflammasome caused aberrant mitochondrial homeostasis to diminish the 
concentration of the coenzyme NAD(+), which in turn inactivated the 
NAD(+)-dependent α-tubulin deacetylase sirtuin 2; this resulted in the 
accumulation of acetylated α-tubulin. Acetylated α-tubulin mediated the 
dynein-dependent transport of mitochondria and subsequent apposition of ASC on 
mitochondria to NLRP3 on the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, in addition to 
direct activation of NLRP3, the creation of optimal sites for signal 
transduction by microtubules is required for activation of the entire NLRP3 
inflammasome.
