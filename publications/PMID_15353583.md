NuA4, the only essential histone acetyltransferase complex in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, acetylates the N-terminal tails of histones H4 and H2A. Affinity 
purification of NuA4 revealed the presence of three previously undescribed 
subunits, Vid21/Eaf1/Ydr359c, Swc4/Eaf2/Ygr002c, and Eaf7/Ynl136w. Experimental 
analyses revealed at least two functionally distinct sets of polypeptides in 
NuA4: (i) Vid21 and Yng2, and (ii) Eaf5 and Eaf7. Vid21 and Yng2 are required 
for bulk histone H4 acetylation and are functionally linked to the histone H2A 
variant Htz1 and the Swr1 ATPase complex (SWR-C) that assembles Htz1 into 
chromatin, whereas Eaf5 and Eaf7 have a different, as yet undefined, role. 
Mutations in Htz1, the SWR-C, and NuA4 cause defects in chromosome segregation 
that are consistent with genetic interactions we have observed between the genes 
encoding these proteins and genes encoding kinetochore components. Because 
SWR-C-dependent recruitment of Htz1 occurs in both transcribed and centromeric 
regions, a NuA4/SWR-C/Htz1 pathway may regulate both transcription and 
centromere function in S. cerevisiae.
