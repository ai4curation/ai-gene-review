The issue of specificity in tyrosine kinase intracellular signaling mediated by 
src homology 2 (SH2) domains has great importance in the understanding how 
individual signals maintain their mutual exclusivity and affect downstream 
responses. Several proteins contain tandem SH2 domains that, on interacting with 
their ligand, provide a higher level of specificity than can be afforded by the 
interaction of a single SH2 domain. In this study, we focus on the comparison of 
two proteins ZAP70 and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, which although distinctly 
different in function and general structure, possess tandem SH2 domains 
separated by a linker region and which bind to phosphorylated receptor molecules 
localized to the cell membrane. Binding studies using isothermal titration 
calorimetry show that these two proteins interact with peptides mimicking their 
physiological ligands in very different ways. In the case of the SH2 domains 
from ZAP70, they interact with a stoichiometry of unity, while p85 is able to 
make two distinct interactions, one with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and the other 
with two p85 molecules interacting with one receptor. The observation of two 
different modes of binding of p85 might be important in providing different 
cellular responses based on fluctuating intracellular concentration regimes of 
this protein. Thermodynamic data on both proteins suggest that a conformational 
change occurs on binding. On investigation of this structural change using a 
truncated form of p85 (including just the two SH2 domains and the inter-SH2 
region), both NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies failed to show 
significant changes in secondary structure. This suggests that any 
conformational change associated with binding is small and potentially limited 
to loop regions of the protein.
