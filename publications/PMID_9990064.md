Pten/Mmac1+/- heterozygous mice exhibited neoplasms in multiple organs including 
the endometrium, liver, prostate, gastrointestinal tract, thyroid, and thymus. 
Loss of the wild-type allele was detected in neoplasms of the thymus and liver. 
Surprisingly, tumors of the gastrointestinal epithelium developed in association 
with gut lymphoid tissue. Tumors of the endometrium, thyroid, prostate, and 
liver were not associated with lymphoid tissue and appeared to be highly 
mitotic. In addition, these mice have nonneoplastic hyperplasia of lymph nodes 
that was caused by an inherited defect in apoptosis detected in B cells and 
macrophages. Examination of peripheral lymphoid tissue including lymphoid 
aggregates associated with polyps revealed that the normal organization of B and 
T cells was disrupted in heterozygous animals. Taken together, these data 
suggest that PTEN is a regulator of apoptosis and proliferation that behaves as 
a "landscaper" tumor suppressor in the gut and a "gatekeeper" tumor suppressor 
in other organs.
