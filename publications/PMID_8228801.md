Interleukin 10 (IL-10) has recently been shown to induce normal human B 
lymphocytes to proliferate and differentiate into immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting 
cells. Herein, we show that IL-10 also promotes DNA synthesis and IgM production 
by anti-CD40 activated B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Most 
strikingly, IL-2 and IL-10 were found to synergize to induce the proliferation 
and differentiation of B-CLL cells. This synergy between IL-2 and IL-10 was also 
observed with normal B cells which proliferated strongly and secreted large 
amounts of IgM, IgG, and IgA. The observed synergy is likely to be due to the 
IL-10-induced increase of high affinity IL-2 receptors on both normal and 
leukemic B cells. This increase of high affinity receptor is associated to an 
increase of Tac/CD25 expression that can be detected by flow cytometric 
analysis. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-10 permits anti-CD40 
activated B cells to respond to IL-2 through an induction of high affinity IL-2 
receptors. This effect of IL-10 may partly explain how T cells, which activate B 
cells in a CD40-dependent fashion, induce B cell proliferation and 
differentiation mostly through IL-2.
