Arg and c-Abl represent the mammalian members of the Abelson family of 
nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases. To gain insight into the biological role 
of Arg we used the two-hybrid approach to identify interacting proteins. Using a 
C-terminal segment of Arg we identified a novel protein, ArgBP1 (Arg binding 
protein 1). ArgBP1 contains a C-terminal SH3 domain, several PEST sequences, a 
serine rich domain and an SH3 binding site. ArgBP1 is ubiquitously expressed as 
two transcripts of approximately 2.2 kb and approximately 8 kb with highest 
levels in brain, heart and testis. The association of ArgBP1 with Arg in living 
cells was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in cotransfected COS cells. 
Analysis of the mechanism of association indicated that the ArgBP1 SH3 domain 
binds to a C-terminal Arg SH3-binding site, and that an N-terminal ArgBP1 
proline-rich sequence binds to the Arg SH3 domain. Immunostaining indicated that 
the subcellular localization of ArgBP1 is cytoplasmic. The similarity of the 
ArgBP1 expression pattern and subcellular localization to those of Arg and the 
potential for a highly specific and potentially strong association mediated by 
two pairs of SH3 domain/proline-rich motif interactions, suggest that ArgBP1 is 
likely to be a regulator and/or effector of Arg function.
