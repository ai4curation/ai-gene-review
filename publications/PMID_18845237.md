MSRAs (methionine sulfoxide reductases A) are enzymes that reverse the effects 
of oxidative damage by reducing methionine sulfoxide back to methionine and 
recovering protein function. In this study we demonstrate that the 
transcriptional regulation of the human MSRA gene is complex and driven by two 
distinct promoters. Both promoters demonstrate high expression in human brain 
and kidney tissues. The upstream (promoter 1) regulates the msrA1 transcript 
that codes for the mitochondrial form of MSRA and is highly active in a broad 
range of cell lines. The downstream promoter (promoter 2) regulates the msrA2/3 
transcripts that code for the cytosolic/nuclear forms of MSRA and is generally 
less active. Promoter 2 contains a 65 bp putative enhancer region that is very 
active in the retinal pigment epithelium-derived D407 cell line. Both promoters 
are partially regulated by all-trans retinoic acid via RARA and other RARs.
