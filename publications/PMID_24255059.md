RATIONALE FOR STUDY: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate 
protein expression at post-transcriptional level. We hypothesized that a 
specific pool of endothelial miRNAs could be selectively regulated by flow 
conditions and inflammatory signals, and as such be involved in the development 
of atherosclerosis.
OBJECTIVE: To identify miRNAs, called atheromiRs, which are selectively 
regulated by shear stress and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL), and to 
determine their role in atherogenesis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Large-scale miRNA profiling in HUVECs identified miR-92a as 
an atheromiR candidate, whose expression is preferentially upregulated by the 
combination of low shear stress (SS) and atherogenic oxLDL. Ex vivo analysis of 
atheroprone and atheroprotected areas of mouse arteries and human 
atherosclerotic plaques demonstrated the preferential expression of miR-92a in 
atheroprone low SS regions. In Ldlr(-/-) mice, miR-92a expression was markedly 
enhanced by hypercholesterolemia, in particular in atheroprone areas of the 
aorta. Assessment of endothelial inflammation in gain- and loss-of-function 
experiments targeting miR-92a expression revealed that miR-92a regulated 
endothelial cell activation by oxLDL, more specifically under low SS conditions, 
which was associated with modulation of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), 
Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 5. miR-92a 
expression was regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
in SS- and oxLDL-dependent manner. Furthermore, specific in vivo blockade of 
miR-92a expression in Ldlr(-/-) mice reduced endothelial inflammation and 
altered the development of atherosclerosis, decreasing plaque size and promoting 
a more stable lesion phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of miR-92a by oxLDL in atheroprone areas promotes 
endothelial activation and the development of atherosclerotic lesions. 
Therefore, miR-92a antagomir seems as a new atheroprotective therapeutic 
strategy.
