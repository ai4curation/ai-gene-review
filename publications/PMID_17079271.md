The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) cascade performs a broad 
range of evolutionarily conserved functions, including the regulation of growth, 
developmental timing and lifespan, and the control of sugar, protein and lipid 
metabolism. Recently, these functions have been genetically dissected in the 
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, revealing a crucial role for cell-surface 
activation of the downstream effector kinase Akt in many of these processes. 
However, the mechanisms regulating lipid metabolism and the storage of lipid 
during development are less well characterized. Here, we use the 
nutrient-storing nurse cells of the fly ovary to study the cellular effects of 
intracellular IIS components on lipid accumulation. These cells normally store 
lipid in a perinuclear pool of small neutral triglyceride-containing droplets. 
We find that loss of the IIS signalling antagonist PTEN, which stimulates cell 
growth in most developing tissues, produces a very different phenotype in nurse 
cells, inducing formation of highly enlarged lipid droplets. Furthermore, we 
show that the accumulation of activated Akt in the cytoplasm is responsible for 
this phenotype and leads to a much higher expression of LSD2, the fly homologue 
of the vertebrate lipid-storage protein perilipin. Our work therefore reveals a 
signalling mechanism by which the effect of insulin on lipid metabolism could be 
regulated independently of some of its other functions during development and 
adulthood. We speculate that this mechanism could be important in explaining the 
well-established link between obesity and insulin resistance that is observed in 
Type 2 diabetes.
