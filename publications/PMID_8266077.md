The interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain (IL-2R gamma) is a necessary component of 
functional IL-2 receptors. IL-2R gamma mutations result in X-linked severe 
combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) in humans, a disease characterized by the 
presence of few or no T cells. In contrast, SCID patients with IL-2 deficiency 
and IL-2-deficient mice have normal numbers of T cells, suggesting that IL-2R 
gamma is part of more than one cytokine receptor. By using chemical 
cross-linking, IL-2R gamma was shown to be physically associated with the IL-7 
receptor. The presence of IL-2R gamma augmented both IL-7 binding affinity and 
the efficiency of internalization of IL-7. These findings may help explain the 
defects of XSCID. Given its role in more than one cytokine receptor system, the 
common gamma chain (gamma c) is proposed as the designation for IL-2R gamma.
