The CLN6 vLINCL is caused by molecular defects in CLN6 gene coding for an ER 
resident transmembrane protein whose function is unknown. In the present study 
gene expression profiling of CLN6-deficient fibroblasts using cDNA microarray 
was undertaken in order to provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms 
underlying this neurodegenerative fatal disease. Data were validated by qRT-PCR. 
Statistically significant alterations of expression were observed for 12 
transcripts. The two most overexpressed genes, versican and tissue factor 
pathway inhibitor 2, are related to extracellular matrix (ECM), predicting 
changes in ECM-related proteins in CLN6-deficient cells. Transcript profiling 
also suggested alterations in signal transduction pathways, apoptosis and the 
immune/inflammatory response. Up-regulated genes related to steroidogenesis or 
signalling, and the relationship between cholesterol dynamics and 
glycosphingolipid sorting, led to investigation of free cholesterol and 
gangliosides in CLN6-deficient fibroblasts. Cholesterol accumulation in 
lysosomes suggests a homeostasis block as a result of CLN6p deficiency. The 
cholesterol imbalance may affect structure/function of caveolae and lipid rafts, 
disrupting signalling transduction pathways and sorting cell mechanisms. 
Alterations in protein/lipid intracellular trafficking would affect the 
composition and function of endocytic compartments, including lysosomes. 
Dysfunctional endosomal/lysosomal vesicles may act as one of the triggers for 
apoptosis and cell death, and for a secondary protective inflammatory response. 
In conclusion, the data reported provide novel clues into molecular 
pathophysiological mechanisms of CLN6-deficiency, and may also help in 
developing disease biomarkers and therapies for this and other neurodegenerative 
diseases.
