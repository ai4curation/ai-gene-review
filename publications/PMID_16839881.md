Inactivation of cell death is a major step in tumor development, and p53, a 
tumor suppressor frequently mutated in cancer, is a critical mediator of cell 
death. While a role for p53 in apoptosis is well established, direct links to 
other pathways controlling cell death are unknown. Here we describe DRAM 
(damage-regulated autophagy modulator), a p53 target gene encoding a lysosomal 
protein that induces macroautophagy, as an effector of p53-mediated death. We 
show that p53 induces autophagy in a DRAM-dependent manner and, while 
overexpression of DRAM alone causes minimal cell death, DRAM is essential for 
p53-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, analysis of DRAM in primary tumors revealed 
frequent decreased expression often accompanied by retention of wild-type p53. 
Collectively therefore, these studies not only report a stress-induced regulator 
of autophagy but also highlight the relationship of DRAM and autophagy to p53 
function and damage-induced programmed cell death.
