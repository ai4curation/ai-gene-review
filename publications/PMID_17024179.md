Abstract

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a component of viral replicase and is well known to modulate the functions of several host proteins. Here, we show that NS5A specifically interacts with FKBP8, a member of the FK506-binding protein family, but not with other homologous immunophilins. Three sets of tetratricopeptide repeats in FKBP8 are responsible for interactions with NS5A. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of FKBP8 in a human hepatoma cell line harboring an HCV RNA replicon suppressed HCV RNA replication, and this reduction was reversed by the expression of an siRNA-resistant FKBP8 mutant. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that FKBP8 forms a complex with Hsp90 and NS5A. Treatment of HCV replicon cells with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of Hsp90, suppressed RNA replication in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the complex consisting of NS5A, FKBP8, and Hsp90 plays an important role in HCV RNA replication.

Introduction

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) persistently infects approximately 170 million people worldwide, and it is responsible for most cases of severe chronic liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma ( Wasley and Alter, 2000 ). Although treatment with interferon (IFN) alpha and ribavirin is available for about half of the population of HCV patients ( Manns et al , 2001 ), therapeutic and preventative vaccines are still necessary for more effective treatment; however, such vaccines have not yet been developed. HCV belongs to the Flaviviridae family and possesses a positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a nucleotide length of 9.6 kb. The HCV genome encodes a single large precursor polyprotein composed of about 3000 amino acids, and the polyprotein is processed by cellular and viral proteases into at least 10 structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins ( Moriishi and Matsuura, 2003 ).

The development of efficient therapies for hepatitis C has been hampered by the lack of a reliable cell-culture system, as well as by the absence of a non-primate animal model. The HCV replicon consists of an antibiotic selection marker and a genotype 1b HCV RNA, which replicates autonomously in the intracellular compartments in a human hepatoma cell line, Huh7 ( Lohmann et al , 1999 ). This replicon system has functioned as an important tool in the investigation of HCV replication and it has served as a cell-based assay system for the evaluation of antiviral compounds. Recently, cell culture systems for in vitro replication and infectious viral production were established based on the full-length HCV genome of genotype 2a, which was isolated from an HCV-infected patient who developed fulminant hepatitis ( Lindenbach et al , 2005 ; Wakita et al , 2005 ; Zhong et al , 2005 ). However, no robust in vitro culture systems for the 1a and 1b genotypes, which are the most prevalent HCV genotypes in the world, have been established to date.

Several viruses require viral and host molecular chaperones for entry, replication, and assembly, as well as for other steps in viral production ( Maggioni and Braakman, 2005 ; Mayer, 2005 ). Cyclosporine A has been found to effectively inhibit viral replication in hepatitis C patients and in HCV replicon cells ( Inoue et al , 2003 ; Watashi et al , 2003 ). Recently, it was shown that cyclophilin (Cyp) B specifically binds to NS5B and promotes association with the genomic RNA; furthermore, cyclosporine A was shown to disrupt interactions between NS5B and CypB ( Watashi et al , 2005 ). CypB belongs to the immunophilin family, which shares peptidyl propyl cis / trans isomerase (PPIase) activity and an affinity for the immunosuppressive drug ( Fischer and Aumuller, 2003 ). Furthermore, blockades of CypA, CypB, and CypC, as well as the induction of cellular stress responses, have been suggested to be involved in cyclosporine A-induced reduction of HCV RNA replication ( Nakagawa et al , 2005 ). However, the involvement of other immunophilins in HCV RNA replication is not yet well understood.

HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane-anchored phosphoprotein that possesses multiple functions in viral replication, IFN resistance, and pathogenesis ( Macdonald and Harris, 2004 ). NS5A contains a zinc metal-binding motif within the N-terminal domain, and this zinc-binding ability is known to be essential for HCV replication ( Tellinghuisen et al , 2004 , 2005 ). Adaptive mutations frequently mapped in the coding region of NS5A have been shown to increase RNA replication ( Yi and Lemon, 2004 ; Appel et al , 2005 ) and they are known to affect the hyperphosphorylation of NS5A by an unknown host kinase ( Koch and Bartenschlager, 1999 ; Neddermann et al , 1999 ; Pietschmann et al , 2001 ). RNA replication in HCV replicon cells has been shown to be inhibited by treatment with lovastatin, a drug that decreases the production of mevalonate by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase; this inhibition of RNA replication was reversed by the addition of geranylgeraniol, which suggests that HCV RNA replication requires geranylgeranylated proteins ( Ye et al , 2003 ; Kapadia and Chisari, 2005 ). A NS5A-pull-down assay identified a geranylgeranylated protein, FBL2, as a NS5A-binding protein ( Wang et al , 2005 ). Although several host proteins could potentially interact with NS5A, little is known about NS5A function.

To gain a better understanding of the functional role of NS5A in HCV replication, we screened human libraries by employing a yeast two-hybrid system and using NS5A as bait. We thereby successfully identified FKBP8 as an NS5A-binding protein. FKBP8 is classified as a member of the FK506-binding protein family, but it lacks several amino-acid residues thought to be important for PPIase activity and FK506 binding ( Lam et al , 1995 ). We demonstrated here that FKBP8 forms a complex with Hsp90 and NS5A, and that this complex is critical for HCV replication, as based on the finding that treatment of the HCV replicon cells with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of Hsp90, suppressed RNA replication. These results therefore suggest that protein complex formation with NS5A, FKBP8, and Hsp90 plays a crucial role in HCV RNA replication.

Discussion

HCV NS5A is a multifunctional protein involved in viral replication and pathogenesis ( Macdonald and Harris, 2004 ). In this study, we demonstrated that NS5A specifically binds to FKBP8, but not to other homologous immunophilins such as FKBP52 and CypD, and that FKBP8 forms both a homomultimer and a heteromultimer with Hsp90. Mutation analyses of FKBP8 and Hsp90 suggest that FKBP8 intermediates between NS5A and Hsp90 via the different position in the TRP domain. FKBP8 has been shown to be expressed in several human tissues, including the liver ( Lam et al , 1995 ); moreover, it has been demonstrated that FKBP8-knockout mice exhibit unusual morphological changes in brain development in the embryonic stage ( Nielsen et al , 2004 ). However, the physiological function of FKBP8 has not been clarified to date.

Recently, the in vitro replication of the full-length HCV genome of genotype 2a (JFH1) isolated from an HCV-infected patient who developed fulminant hepatitis was reported ( Lindenbach et al , 2005 ; Wakita et al , 2005 ; Zhong et al , 2005 ). Although binding of NS5A of the JFH1 clone to FKBP8 was weaker than that of genotypes 1a and 1b ( Figure 2A ), siRNA-mediated knockdown of FKBP8 impaired production of infectious HCV particles in JFH1 cell culture system ( Figure 6D ). In spite of a weaker interaction between FKBP8 and NS5A, these results suggest that FKBP8 is still required for HCV replication in the cell culture system of JFH1. The involvement of FKBP8 in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis remains controversial. Shirane and Nakayama (2003) reported that FKBP8 binds to Bcl-2 and that the Bcl-2/FKBP8 complex was sequestered in the mitochondria in order to suppress apoptosis. However, Edlich et al (2005) reported that FKBP8 binds to calmodulin via elevations in the calcium concentration, which in turn leads to the promotion of apoptosis in neuronal tissues. Knockdown of FKBP8 led to impaired HCV RNA replication, which was restored by the expression of an RNAi-resistant FKBP8 mutant. These results suggest that the impairment of HCV RNA replication induced by the knockdown of FKBP8 was not due to an induction of apoptosis, nor to any side effects of RNA transfection. The modulation of apoptosis by FKBP8 might be diverse in different tissue types and cell lines.

FKBP8 belongs to the FKBP family due to sequence similarity, but neither FK506 binding nor PPIase activity has been detected in the case of FKBP8 thus far ( Lam et al , 1995 ). Apoptosis was induced in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line by the treatment with mitochondria-mediated proapoptotic drugs, but was inhibited by the knockdown of FKBP8 and was enhanced by treatment with GPI1046, a nonimmunosuppressive FK506 derivative, whereas this result was not obtained with FK506 ( Edlich et al , 2005 ). The inhibition constant of FKBP8 to FK506 was 50 times higher than that of FKBP12 to FK506 ( Edlich et al , 2005 ), which suggests that the binding affinity of FKBP8 to FK506 is low. Furthermore, cyclosporin A, but not FK506, was shown to suppress HCV RNA replication via the interaction of NS5B with CypB ( Watashi et al , 2003 , 2005 ). These results support the notion that FK506 preferentially binds to FKBP members other than FKBP8 in vivo , and that it does not participate in the inhibition of HCV replication.

Cellular and viral chaperones are implicated in the processing of viral proteins and viral assembly ( Maggioni and Braakman, 2005 ; Mayer, 2005 ). The NS2 protein of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a member of the Flaviviridae family as is HCV, exhibits autoprotease activity that leads to cleavage at the NS2 and NS3 junction ( Lackner et al , 2005 ). A noncytopathogenic strain of BVDV is unable to cleave the NS2/3 junction in the absence of the interaction of a molecular chaperone, J-domain protein interacting with viral protein (Jiv); these previous findings suggest that Jiv is necessary for the replication of a noncytopathogenic strain of BVDV and is involved in the establishment of persistent infection ( Lackner et al , 2005 ). Furthermore, FKBP52, which shares a high homology with FKBP8, was shown to regulate replication of adeno-associated virus type 2 by interacting with viral DNA ( Qing et al , 2001 ). In this study, we demonstrated that HCV NS5A binds to FKBP8 and forms a complex with Hsp90. FKBP8 could directly bind to NS5A domain I in vitro ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), suggesting that Hsp90 is not required for interaction between NS5A and FKBP8. FKBP52 forms a homodimer, binds to Hsp90 through TPR domain, and regulates chaperone activity of Hsp90 ( Silverstein et al , 1999 ; Scheufler et al , 2000 ; Wu et al , 2004 ). FKBP8 may act as cochaperone of Hsp90 to regulate HCV genome replication by interaction with NS5A. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that is highly expressed in most cell types in various organisms ( Neckers, 2002 ). Here, Hsp90 was found to be able to bind to FKBP8 and form a complex with HCV NS5A. The suppression of NS5A, but not that of FKBP8, was observed in replicon cells treated with geldanamycin, thus suggesting that Hsp90 regulates the replication of HCV RNA via the interaction with FKBP8. It is well known that several host proteins such as VAPs and FBL2 interact with the HCV replication complex and regulate HCV RNA replication ( Evans et al , 2004 ; Gao et al , 2004 ; Hamamoto et al , 2005 ; Wang et al , 2005 ). The TPR domain of FKBP8 is composed of 220 amino acids and is too long to determine the critical residues responsible for interaction with NS5A. Therefore, we tried to make a chimeric mutant carrying the TPR of FKBP52 to determine the critical amino-acid residues for binding to NS5A in FKBP8. However, expression of a chimeric FKBP8 possessing TPR of FKBP52 was much lower than the native form, suggesting that TPR domain is critical for stability and conformation of FKBP8. Amino-acid residues responsible for the binding to NS5A must be different from the two-carboxylate positions responsible for Hsp90 binding and locate within the TPR domain. The ternary complex consists of NS5A, FKBP8 and Hsp90 may be involved in the replication of HCV. FKBP52 possesses PPIase activity and chaperone activity in domain I (amino acids 1–148) and domain 3 (TPR domain, amino acids 264–400), respectively ( Pirkl et al , 2001 ). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the TPR domain is responsible for the chaperone activity of FKBP8, and that the FKBP8 and NS5A complex transports Hsp90 to the appropriate clients, including viral and host proteins, which in turn leads to the stabilization of the replication complex and the enhancement of HCV RNA replication.

In this study, we identified human FKBP8 as a binding partner of HCV NS5A. Our results suggest that the interaction between FKBP8 and HCV NS5A is essential for HCV replication. The NS5A protein forms a complex with FKBP8 and Hsp90, and an inhibitor of Hsp90 was shown to reduce the efficiency of HCV replication. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the NS5A/FKBP8/Hsp90 complex may lead to the development of new therapeutics for chronic hepatitis C.
