Synaptophysin (SYP) is a major protein of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles 
spanning the membrane four times and contributing to various aspects of the 
synaptic vesicle cycle. The split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system was used to 
characterize molecular interactions of membrane-bound, full-length murine SYP. 
In this way, the known homophilic SYP-SYP association could be confirmed and 
heterophilic binding of SYP to other tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins of the 
secretory carrier-associated membrane- and synaptogyrin-type could be detected 
for the first time. SYP-binding was also observed for the vSNARE synaptobrevin2 
and various membrane and membrane-associated proteins. Double labeling 
immunofluorescence microscopy of murine retina, co-immunoprecipitation 
experiments and fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET) analyses between 
fluorescent protein-tagged polypeptides were carried out to validate and further 
characterize the association of SYP with the tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins 
secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 1 and synaptogyrin3, with 
synaptobrevin2, and the newly identified binding partners phospholipase D4, 
stathmin-like3, Rho family GTPase2 and ADP-ribosylation factor interacting 
protein2. It was observed that the carboxyterminus of SYP is dispensable for 
association with integral membrane proteins while it is needed for binding to 
membrane-associated polypeptides. The latter appears to be regulated by 
phosphorylation, since src homology 2-domains were shown to attach to the 
multiple carboxyterminal phosphotyrosine residues of SYP. In conclusion, the 
association of SYP with different tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins suggests 
shared functions and the multiple other interactions identify SYP as part of a 
membrane platform acting as a facilitator of various steps of the synaptic 
vesicle cycle.
