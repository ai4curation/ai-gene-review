This study presents an analysis of the stromal proteome in its oligomeric state 
extracted from highly purified chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. 241 
proteins (88% with predicted cTP), mostly assembled in oligomeric complexes, 
were identified by mass spectrometry with emphasis on distinguishing between 
paralogues. This is critical because different paralogues in a gene family often 
have different subcellular localizations and/or different expression patterns 
and functions. The native protein masses were determined for all identified 
proteins. Comparison with the few well characterized stromal complexes from A. 
thaliana confirmed the accuracy of the native mass determination, and by 
extension, the usefulness of the native mass data for future in-depth protein 
interaction studies. Resolved protein interactions are discussed and compared 
with an extensive collection of native mass data of orthologues in other plants 
and bacteria. Relative protein expression levels were estimated from spot 
intensities and also provided estimates of relative concentrations of individual 
proteins. No such quantification has been reported so far. Surprisingly proteins 
dedicated to chloroplast protein synthesis, biogenesis, and fate represented 
nearly 10% of the total stroma protein mass. Oxidative pentose phosphate 
pathway, glycolysis, and Calvin cycle represented together about 75%, nitrogen 
assimilation represented 5-7%, and all other pathways such as biosynthesis of 
e.g. fatty acids, amino acids, nucleotides, tetrapyrroles, and vitamins B(1) and 
B(2) each represented less than 1% of total protein mass. Several proteins with 
diverse functions outside primary carbon metabolism, such as the isomerase ROC4, 
lipoxygenase 2 involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, and a carbonic anhydrase 
(CA1), were surprisingly abundant in the range of 0.75-1.5% of the total stromal 
mass. Native images with associated information are available via the Plastid 
Proteome Database.
