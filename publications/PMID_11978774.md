In the present study, we examined the role of the recently identified 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface molecule BY55, assigned 
as CD160, in TCR signaling. CD160 is expressed by most intestinal 
intraepithelial lymphocytes and by a minor subset of circulating lymphocytes 
including NK, TCRgammadelta and cytotoxic effector CD8bright+CD28- T 
lymphocytes. We report that CD160, which has a broad specificity for MHC class 
Ia and Ib molecules, behaves as a co-receptor upon T cell activation. Anti-CD160 
mAb enhance the CD3-induced proliferation of freshly isolated CD160-enriched 
peripheral blood lymphocytes and CD160+ T cell clones. Further, the engagement 
of CD160 receptors on normal clonal T lymphocyte populations lacking CD4, CD8 
and CD28 molecules by MHC class I molecules results in an increased CD3-induced 
cell proliferation. Further, we found that CD160 co-precipitates with the 
protein tyrosine kinase p56lck and tyrosine phosphorylated zeta chains upon 
TCR-CD3 cell activation. Thus, we demonstrate that CD160 provides co-stimulatory 
signals leading to the expansion of a minor subset of circulating lymphocytes 
including double-negative CD4/CD8 T lymphocytes and CD8bright+ cytotoxic 
effector T lymphocytes lacking CD28 expression.
