The phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinases, including Tor1p, Tor2p, 
FRAP/RAFT, FRP/ATR, ATM, Mec1p, Rad3, and Tel1p, function in signal transduction 
pathways involved in cell cycle progression and surveillance. The 
rapamycin-sensitive kinase activities of Tor1p and Tor2p are required for the 
nutrient-activated protein translation essential for G1 cell cycle progression 
in haploid yeast cells. In addition, Tor2p's kinase activity is necessary for 
its unique rapamycin-insensitive function involved in the assembly of the actin 
cytoskeleton. In the current study using diploid yeast, we found that the kinase 
activities of the Tor proteins are also required for two discrete steps during 
yeast meiosisthe switch between the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles and a later 
step during meiosis involved in the packaging of resultant haploid cells 
(spores) into asci. Based on what is known of the mitotic functions of Tor and 
FRAP proteins, these results likely reflect the requirement for signaling 
pathways leading to regulated protein translation during meiosis. Mec1p, which 
is required for meiotic recombination, and the Tor proteins are, therefore, 
homologous kinases with distinct, yet essential, roles in meiosis.
