The Mdm2 and Mdm4 oncoproteins are key negative regulators of the p53 tumor 
suppressor. However, their physiological contributions to the regulation of p53 
stability and activity remain highly controversial. Here, we combined a p53 
knock-in allele, in which p53 is silenced by a transcriptional stop element 
flanked by loxP sites, with the mdm2- and mdm4-null alleles. This approach 
allows Cre-mediated conditional p53 expression in tissues in vivo and cells in 
vitro lacking Mdm2, Mdm4, or both. Using this strategy, we show that Mdm2 and 
Mdm4 are essential in a nonredundant manner for preventing p53 activity in the 
same cell type, irrespective of the proliferation/differentiation status of the 
cells. Although Mdm2 prevents accumulation of the p53 protein, Mdm4 contributes 
to the overall inhibition of p53 activity independent of Mdm2. We propose a 
model in which Mdm2 is critical for the regulation of p53 levels and Mdm4 is 
critical for the fine-tuning of p53 transcriptional activity, both proteins 
acting synergistically to keep p53 in check.
