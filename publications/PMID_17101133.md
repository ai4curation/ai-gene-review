Abl interactor (Abi) was identified as an Abl tyrosine kinase-binding protein 
and subsequently shown to be a component of the macromolecular Abi/WAVE complex, 
which is a key regulator of Rac-dependent actin polymerization. Previous studies 
showed that Abi-1 promotes c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Mammalian Enabled 
(Mena) and WAVE2. In addition to Abi-1, mammals possess Abi-2 and NESH (Abi-3). 
In this study, we compared the three Abi proteins in terms of the promotion of 
c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation and the formation of Abi/WAVE complex. Although 
Abi-2, like Abi-1, promoted the c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Mena and 
WAVE2, NESH (Abi-3) had no such effect. This difference was likely due to their 
binding abilities as to c-Abl. Immunoprecipitation revealed that NESH (Abi-3) is 
present in the Abi/WAVE complex. Our results suggest that NESH (Abi-3), like 
Abi-1 and Abi-2, is a component of the Abi/WAVE complex, but likely plays a 
different role in the regulation of c-Abl.
