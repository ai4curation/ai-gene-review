Shade-avoider plants typically respond to shade-light signals by increasing the 
rate of stem growth. CONSTITTUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (COP1) is an E3 ligase 
involved in the ubiquitin labelling of proteins targeted for degradation. In 
dark-grown seedlings, COP1 accumulates in the nucleus and light exposure causes 
COP1 migration to the cytosol. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, COP1 
accumulates in the nucleus under natural or simulated shade, despite the 
presence of far-red light. In plants grown under white light, the transfer to 
shade-light conditions triggers an unexpectedly rapid re-accumulation of COP1 in 
the nucleus. The partial simulation of shade by lowering either blue or red 
light levels (maintaining far-red light) caused COP1 nuclear re-accumulation. 
Hypocotyl growth of wild-type seedlings is more sensitive to afternoon shade 
than to morning shade. A residual response to shade was observed in the cop1 
mutant background, but these seedlings showed inverted sensitivity as they 
responded to morning shade and not to afternoon shade. COP1 overexpression 
exaggerated the wild-type pattern by enhancing afternoon sensitivity and making 
morning shade inhibitory of growth. COP1 nuclear re-accumulation also responded 
more strongly to afternoon shade than to morning shade. These results are 
consistent with a signalling role of COP1 in shade avoidance. We propose a 
function of COP1 in setting the daily patterns of sensitivity to shade in the 
fluctuating light environments of plant canopies.
