The CblC and CblD chaperones are involved in early steps in the cobalamin 
trafficking pathway. Cobalamin derivatives entering the cytoplasm are converted 
by CblC to a common cob(II)alamin intermediate via glutathione-dependent 
alkyltransferase or reductive elimination activities. Cob(II)alamin is 
subsequently converted to one of two biologically active alkylcobalamins by 
downstream chaperones. The function of CblD has been elusive although it is 
known to form a complex with CblC under certain conditions. Here, we report that 
CblD provides a sulfur ligand to cob(II)alamin bound to CblC, forming an 
interprotein coordination complex that rapidly oxidizes to 
thiolato-cob(III)alamin. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis and EPR spectroscopy 
identified Cys-261 on CblD as the sulfur donor. The unusual interprotein Co-S 
bond was characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and visualized in the 
crystal structure of the human CblD thiolato-cob(III)alamin complex. Our study 
provides insights into how cobalamin coordination chemistry could be utilized 
for cofactor translocation in the trafficking pathway.
