Phosphoprotein associated with GEMs (PAG), also known as Csk-binding protein 
(Cbp), is a broadly expressed palmitoylated transmembrane adapter protein found 
in membrane rafts, also called GEMs (glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane 
microdomains). PAG is known to bind and activate the essential regulator of 
Src-family kinases, cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase Csk. In the present 
study we used the yeast 2-hybrid system to search for additional proteins which 
might bind to PAG. We have identified the abundant cytoplasmic adapter protein 
EBP50 (ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa), also known 
as NHERF (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor), as a specific PAG-binding 
partner. The interaction involves the C-terminal sequence (TRL) of PAG and 
N-terminal PDZ domain(s) of EBP50. As EBP50 is known to interact via its 
C-terminal domain with the ERM-family proteins, which in turn bind to actin 
cytoskeleton, the PAG-EBP50 interaction may be important for connecting membrane 
rafts to the actin cytoskeleton.
