The nucleotide sequence of the xynZ gene, encoding the extracellular xylanase Z 
of Clostridium thermocellum, was determined. The putative xynZ gene was 2,511 
base pairs long and encoded a polypeptide of 837 amino acids. A region of 60 
amino acids containing a duplicated segment of 24 amino acids was found between 
residues 429 and 488 of xylanase Z. This region was strongly similar to the 
conserved domain found at the carboxy-terminal ends of C. thermocellum 
endoglucanases A, B, and D. Deletions removing up to 508 codons from the 5' end 
of the gene did not affect the activity of the encoded polypeptide, showing that 
the active site was located in the C-terminal half of the protein and that the 
conserved region was not involved in catalysis. Expression of xylanase activity 
in Escherichia coli was increased up to 220-fold by fusing fragments containing 
the 3' end of the gene with the start of lacZ present in pUC19. An internal 
translational initiation site which was efficiently recognized in E. coli was 
tentatively identified 470 codons downstream from the actual start codon.
