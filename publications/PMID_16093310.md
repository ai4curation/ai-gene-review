We carried out a large-scale screen to identify interactions between integral 
membrane proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using a modified 
split-ubiquitin technique. Among 705 proteins annotated as integral membrane, we 
identified 1,985 putative interactions involving 536 proteins. To ascribe 
confidence levels to the interactions, we used a support vector machine 
algorithm to classify interactions based on the assay results and protein data 
derived from the literature. Previously identified and computationally supported 
interactions were used to train the support vector machine, which identified 131 
interactions of highest confidence, 209 of the next highest confidence, 468 of 
the next highest, and the remaining 1,085 of low confidence. This study provides 
numerous putative interactions among a class of proteins that have been 
difficult to analyze on a high-throughput basis by other approaches. The results 
identify potential previously undescribed components of established biological 
processes and roles for integral membrane proteins of ascribed functions.
