Hephaestin (Hp) is a membrane protein with ferroxidase activity that converts 
Fe(II) to Fe(III) during the absorption of nutritional iron in the gut. Using 
anti-peptide antibodies to predicted immunogenic regions of rodent Hp, previous 
immunocytochemical studies in rat, mouse, and human gut tissues localized Hp to 
the basolateral membranes of the duodenal enterocytes where the Hp was predicted 
to aid in the transfer of Fe(III) to transferrin in the blood. We used a 
recombinant soluble form of human Hp to obtain a high-titer polyclonal antibody 
to Hp. This antibody was used to identify the intracellular location of Hp in 
human gut tissue. Our immunocytochemical studies confirmed the previous 
localization of Hp in human enterocytes. However, we also localized Hp to the 
entire length of the gastrointestinal tract, the antral portion of the stomach, 
and to the enteric nervous system (both the myenteric and submucous plexi). Hp 
was also localized to human pancreatic beta-cells. In addition to its expression 
in the same cells as Hp, ferroportin was also localized to the ductal cells of 
the exocrine pancreas. The localization of the ferroxidase Hp to the neuronal 
plexi and the pancreatic beta cells suggests a role for the enzymatic function 
of Hp in the protection of these specialized cell types from oxidative damage.
