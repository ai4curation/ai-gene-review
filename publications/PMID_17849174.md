Since Notch signaling plays a critical role in stem cells and oncogenesis, we 
hypothesized that Notch signaling might play roles in cancer stem cells and 
cancer cells with a stem cell phenotype. In this study, we accessed potential 
functions of the Notch pathway in the formation of cancer stem cells using human 
glioma. Using RT-PCR, we found that most human astrogliomas of different grades 
expressed moderate to high level of Notch receptors and ligands. mRNA of Hes5 
but not Hes1, both of which are major downstream molecules of the Notch pathway, 
was also detected. In human glioma cell lines BT325, U251, SHG-44, and U87, mRNA 
encoding different types of Notch receptors were detected, but active form of 
Notch1 (NIC) was only detected in SHG-44 and U87 by Western blot. Interestingly, 
proliferation of these two glioma cell lines appeared faster than that of the 
other two lines in which NIC was not detected. We have over-expressed NIC of 
Notch1 in SHG-44 cells by constitutive transfection to evaluate the effects of 
Notch signaling on glioma cells. Our results showed that over-expression of NIC 
in SHG-44 cells promoted the growth and the colony-forming activity of SHG-44 
cells. Interestingly, over-expression of NIC increased the formation 
neurosphere-like colonies in the presence of growth factors. These colonies 
expressed nestin, and could be induced to cells expressing neuron-, astrocyte-, 
or oligodendrocyte-specific markers, consistent with phenotypes of neural stem 
cells. These data suggest that Notch signaling promote the formation of cancer 
stem cell-like cells in human glioma.
