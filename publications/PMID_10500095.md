Cyclin E is an unstable protein that is degraded in a ubiquitin- and proteasome- 
dependent pathway. Two factors stimulate cyclin E ubiquitination in vivo: when 
it is free of its CDK partner, and when it is phosphorylated on threonine 380. 
We pursued the first of these pathways by using a two-hybrid screen to identify 
proteins that could bind only to free cyclin E. This resulted in the isolation 
of human Cul-3, a member of the cullin family of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. 
We found that Cul-3 was bound to cyclin E but not to cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes in 
mammalian cells, and that overexpression of Cul-3 increased ubiquitination of 
cyclin E but not other cyclins. Conversely, deletion of the Cul-3 gene in mice 
caused increased accumulation of cyclin E protein, and had cell-type-specific 
effects on S-phase regulation. In the extraembryonic ectoderm, in which cells 
undergo a standard mitotic cycle, there was a greatly increased number of cells 
in S phase. In the trophectoderm, in which cells go through endocycles, there 
was a block to entry into S phase. The SCF pathway, which targets cyclins for 
ubiquitination on the basis of their phosphorylation state, and the Cul-3 
pathway, which selects cyclin E for ubiquitination on the basis of its assembly 
into CDK complexes, may be complementary ways to control cyclin abundance.
