In our previous study, we identified 1241 loci with somatic copy number 
alterations in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 
arrays, and a putative cancer gene SERPINA5 was uncovered in a novel chromosomal 
region with recurrent copy number loss at 14q31.1-32.13. The SERPINA5 was 
reported to be deregulated in renal, breast, prostate and ovarian cancers. 
However, the roles of SERPINA5 in cancer remain greatly elusive. In this study, 
we found that the DNA dosage and expression level of the SERPINA5 gene were 
significantly decreased in HCC by quantitative real-time PCR. Notably, the 
expression levels of SERPINA5 negatively correlated with malignant progression 
of HCC. The SERPINA5 gene was further observed to reduce in vitro and in vivo 
metastatic potential of HCC cells. Moreover, secreted SERPINA5 protein also 
could inhibit the metastatic ability of HCC cells. Finally, we discovered that 
one of the mechanisms explaining SERPINA5 inhibition of HCC metastasis is 
through direct interaction with fibronectin and disruption of the 
fibronectin-integrin signaling pathway. These findings highlight an important 
role of SERPINA5 in the regulation of migratory and metastatic potentials of HCC 
and suggest a potential application of SERPINA5 in cancer treatment.

In this study, we found that the DNA dosage and expression level of the SERPINA5 gene were significantly decreased in HCC by quantitative real‐time PCR. Notably, the expression levels of SERPINA5 negatively correlated with malignant progression of HCC. The SERPINA5 gene was further observed to reduce in vitro and in vivo metastatic potential of HCC cells. Moreover, secreted SERPINA5 protein also could inhibit the metastatic ability of HCC cells. Finally, we discovered that one of the mechanisms explaining SERPINA5 inhibition of HCC metastasis is through direct interaction with fibronectin and disruption of the fibronectin–integrin signaling pathway. These findings highlight an important role of SERPINA5 in the regulation of migratory and metastatic potentials of HCC and suggest a potential application of SERPINA5 in cancer treatment.

1. Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide ( Yang and Roberts, 2010 ). The identification and characterization of genes within amplified and deleted chromosomal loci can provide new insights into the pathogenesis of cancer and also lead to new approaches for diagnosis and therapy ( Speleman et al., 2008 ). To identify novel cancer‐related genes, we previously identified 1241 loci with somatic copy number alterations (CNA) in human HCC using Affymetrix genome‐wide SNP 6.0 arrays ( Jia et al., 2011 ). Importantly, a number of new CNAs were also found, including a novel recurrent region of copy number loss at 14q31.1–32.13 with a frequency of 8.6% (5/58) in HCC ( Jia et al., 2011 ).

Copy number loss of 14q has been reported in several other cancers, including renal cell carcinoma ( Alimov et al., 2004 ), adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) ( Fortenberry et al., 2010 ; van Dekken et al., 1999 ), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) ( Pehlivan et al., 2008 ), colorectal adenocarcinoma ( Thorstensen et al., 2001 ), and gastric cancer ( Buffart et al., 2012 ). Moreover, loss of 14q was also correlated with an early age of onset, advanced stage, high grade, and poor disease outcome ( Alimov et al., 2004 ; Buffart et al., 2012 ; Fortenberry et al., 2010 ; Pehlivan et al., 2008 ; Thorstensen et al., 2001 ). The focal region has been isolated to 14q31.1–32.13 in adenocarcinoma of the GEJ and renal cell carcinoma, suggesting that this region encodes a putative tumor suppressor gene involved in disease progression ( Alimov et al., 2004 ; Fortenberry et al., 2010 ; van Dekken et al., 1999 ). Therefore, the identification of the genes at locus 14q31.1–32.13 responsible for copy number loss is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression in many solid tumors, including HCC. To identify the potential driver genes located in this region, we previously focused on differentially expressed genes at this locus with integrated copy number analysis and expression profiling, from which one candidate gene, SERPINA5 , was derived ( Jia et al., 2011 ).

SERPINA5 (also called Protein C Inhibitor, PCI ) belongs to the serine protease inhibitor superfamily which is a multi‐functional protein, including preventing metastasis and anti‐angiogenesis in tumor cells ( Sil et al., 2011 ). SERPINA5 was first isolated from human plasma. Human plasma SERPINA5 is mainly synthesized in the liver ( Francis and Thomas, 1984 ), but it is also produced in kidneys and reproductive organs, including testes, seminal vesicles and ovaries ( Laurell et al., 1992 ). Recently, SERPINA5 expression has been shown to be decreased in renal, breast, prostate and ovarian cancers ( Asanuma et al., 2007 ; Bijsmans et al., 2011 ; Cao et al., 2003 ; Wakita et al., 2004 ). However, the expression status, biological function and molecular mechanisms of SERPINA5 in HCC are largely unknown.

In this study, we demonstrated that SERPINA5 is pathologically downregulated in HCC specimens. Ectopic expression of SERPINA5 could inhibit the metastatic abilities of HCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo . Moreover, we found that one of the mechanisms by which SERPINA5 contributes to these malignant feature was explored to through disrupting the fibronectin–integrin signaling pathway. Together, our findings not only advance the molecular understanding of tumor metastasis, but also provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of metastatic HCC.

4. Discussion

An effective way to identify driver genes with causal roles in carcinogenesis is the detection of genomic regions that undergo frequent alterations in cancers. To identify recurrent regions of CNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we recently performed a genome‐wide copy number analysis of 58 HCC primary tumors and paired non‐tumor tissues using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array, from which a total of 1241 regions of somatic CNAs were derived ( Jia et al., 2011 ). Importantly, a number of new regions with somatic CNAs have also been uncovered in HCC, including a recurrent region of copy number loss at 14q31.1–32.13 occurring at a frequency of 8.6% (5/58). By using integrated analysis of copy number alteration and gene expression profiling, a putative tumor suppressor genes ( SERPINA5 ) was uncovered in the recurrent region of copy number loss, 14q31.1–32.13, in HCC.

SERPINA5 is a member of the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors ( Suzuki and Hayashi, 2007 ). SERPINA5 functions as an inhibitor of several plasma proteases involved in blood coagulation and is a potent inhibitor of uPA ( Stief et al., 1987 ). Given both the role of uPA in tumor cell metastasis and its inhibition by SERPINA5, the physiological relevance of SERPINA5 in tumor metastasis is apparent ( Jackson et al., 1997 ). This relevance was substantiated by a report on prostate cancer in which loss of SERPINA5 expression was found in high‐grade tumors ( Cao et al., 2003 ). Moreover, overexpression of SERPINA5 results in decreased invasion, metastatic potential and angiogenesis in breast cancer, and elevated levels of SERPINA5 protein have been reported to be associated with increased survival in primary breast carcinomas ( Asanuma et al., 2007 ; Castello et al., 2007 ). Additionally, the expression of SERPINA5 has been shown to be decreased in renal, prostate and ovarian cancers ( Alimov et al., 2004 ; Bijsmans et al., 2011 ; Cao et al., 2003 ). However, the expression status and functional roles of the SERPINA5 gene in HCC are largely unknown. In this study, we followed up on our previous study in which the SERPINA5 gene was identified in a genomic region of copy number loss at 14q31.1–32.13, and found the decreased level of SERPINA5 in HCC tissues. Importantly, the downregulation of SERPINA5 negatively correlated with the malignant progression of HCC specimens. Moreover, SERPINA5 was observed to inhibit the in vitro and in vivo metastatic potential of HCC cells.

To further explore the underlying mechanism by which SERPINA5 inhibits cell migration and tumor metastasis, we found that SERPINA5 can bind to fibronectin, a high‐molecular weight extracellular matrix glycoprotein that can be secreted by tumor cells ( Pankov and Yamada, 2002 ). Fibronectin, a ligand for the integrin β1 receptor, binds to membrane‐spanning integrin receptors and plays an important role in cell signaling, defining cellular shape, mobility, and regulating cell proliferation and cell survival ( Sengupta et al., 2010 ). Moreover, fibronectin plays an important role in cell signaling pertinent to tumor progression and is important for the proliferation of different types of cancers, including HCC ( Han et al., 2006 ; Ohnishi et al., 1998 ; Sherbet et al., 1982 ). In this study, we found that shRNA‐mediated knockdown of fibronectin expression attenuated the increased migration of HCC cells caused by targeted knockdown of SERPINA5 . Moreover, the migratory potential of HCC cells on chambers coated with fibronectin was suppressed by secreted SERPINA5. The binding of integrins to their ligands triggers downstream signal transduction cascades. The fibronectin receptor (α5β1‐integrin) primarily binds to fibronectin, leading to cell anchoring, and subsequently activates the non‐receptor tyrosine kinases FAK and Src, which play an important role in tumorigenesis by promoting the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells ( Caswell et al., 2007 ; Mitra and Schlaepfer, 2006 ). In this study, we found that overexpression of SERPINA5 decreases the phosphorylation levels of FAK and Src kinase, whereas inhibition of integrin β1 expression inhibits increased migration of HCC cells caused by targeted knockdown of SERPINA5 .

It has been reported that fibronectin–integrin β1 is an important regulator of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 activity ( Milner et al., 2007 ; Sil et al., 2011 ). Therefore, we employed gelatin zymography assay to determine whether the binding of SERPINA5 to fibronectin–integrin modulates the activity of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9. However, we found that overexpression of SERPINA5 has no significant effect on the activity of MMPs in HCC cells ( Figure S5 ). This finding implies that alternative downstream effectors rather than the activation of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 are involved in the fibronectin–integrin β1 pathway, which deserves further research in next study. In addition, the proteolytic activity of SERPINA5 on the migratory ability of HCC cells was further determined by constructing two SERPINA5 mutants (R354A and T341R) without proteolytic activity ( Rehault et al., 2005 ). The results showed that both of the two mutants inhibit the migratory ability of HCC cells ( Figure S6 ). Overall, this study demonstrated that SERPINA5 might regulate tumor migration and metastasis independent of protease inhibitory activity by interacting with fibronectin and disrupting fibronectin–integrin signaling in HCC. This evidence suggests that SERPINA5 may function as a fibronectin antagonist.

In conclusion, we have, for the first time, demonstrated that SERPINA5 is a novel metastasis suppressor gene in HCC. Molecular studies revealed that the metastasis‐suppressing function of SERPINA5 in HCC might be associated with its role in decreasing cell migration by directly interacting with fibronectin and disrupting the fibronectin–integrin signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that SERPINA5 is a target gene within the 14q31.1–32.13 deletion region that plays a pivotal role in HCC metastasis.
