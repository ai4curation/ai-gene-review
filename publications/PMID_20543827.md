In the absence of ligand, some nuclear receptors, including retinoic acid 
receptor (RAR), act as transcriptional repressors by recruiting corepressor 
complexes to target genes. This constitutive repression is crucial in metazoan 
reproduction, development and homeostasis. However, its specific molecular 
determinants had remained obscure. Using structural, biochemical and cell-based 
assays, we show that the basal repressive activity of RAR is conferred by an 
extended beta-strand that forms an antiparallel beta-sheet with specific 
corepressor residues. Agonist binding induces a beta-strand-to-alpha-helix 
transition that allows for helix H11 formation, which in turn provokes 
corepressor release, repositioning of helix H12 and coactivator recruitment. 
Several lines of evidence suggest that this structural switch could be 
implicated in the intrinsic repressor function of other nuclear receptors. 
Finally, we report on the molecular mechanism by which inverse agonists 
strengthen corepressor interaction and enhance gene silencing by RAR.
