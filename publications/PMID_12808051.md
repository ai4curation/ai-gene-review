In the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway, accumulation of 
unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates a transmembrane 
kinase/ribonuclease Ire1, which causes the transcriptional induction of 
ER-resident chaperones, including BiP/Kar2. It was previously hypothesized that 
BiP/Kar2 plays a direct role in the signaling mechanism. In this model, 
association of BiP/Kar2 with Ire1 represses the UPR pathway while under 
conditions of ER stress, BiP/Kar2 dissociation leads to activation. To test this 
model, we analyzed five temperature-sensitive alleles of the yeast KAR2 gene. 
When cells carrying a mutation in the Kar2 substrate-binding domain were 
incubated at the restrictive temperature, association of Kar2 to Ire1 was 
disrupted, and the UPR pathway was activated even in the absence of extrinsic ER 
stress. Conversely, cells carrying a mutation in the Kar2 ATPase domain, in 
which Kar2 poorly dissociated from Ire1 even in the presence of tunicamycin, a 
potent inducer of ER stress, were unable to activate the pathway. Our findings 
provide strong evidence in support of BiP/Kar2-dependent Ire1 regulation model 
and suggest that Ire1 associates with Kar2 as a chaperone substrate. We 
speculate that recognition of unfolded proteins is based on their competition 
with Ire1 for binding with BiP/Kar2.
