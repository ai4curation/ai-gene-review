By studying primary isogenic murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we have shown 
that PLK3 null MEFs contain a reduced level of phosphatase and tensin homolog 
(PTEN) and increased Akt1 activation coupled with decreased GSK3β activation 
under normoxia and hypoxia. Purified recombinant Plk3, but not a 
kinase-defective mutant, efficiently phosphorylates PTEN in vitro. Mass 
spectrometry identifies threonine 366 and serine 370 as two putative residues 
that are phosphorylated by Plk3. Immunoblotting using a phosphospecific antibody 
confirms these sites as Plk3 phosphorylation sites. Moreover, treatment of MEFs 
with LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3β and CK2, only partially suppresses the 
phosphorylation, suggesting Plk3 as an additional kinase that phosphorylates 
these sites in vivo. Plk3-targeting mutants of PTEN are expressed at a reduced 
level in comparison with the wild-type counterpart, which is associated with an 
enhanced activity of PDK1, an upstream activator of Akt1. Furthermore, the 
reduced level of PTEN in PLK3 null MEFs is stabilized by treatment with MG132, a 
proteosome inhibitor. Combined, our study identifies Plk3 as a new player in the 
regulation of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling axis by phosphorylation and 
stabilization of PTEN.
