Myopia, or near-sightedness, is an ocular refractive error of unfocused image 
quality in front of the retinal plane. Individuals with high-grade myopia 
(dioptric power greater than -6.00) are predisposed to ocular morbidities such 
as glaucoma, retinal detachment, and myopic maculopathy. Nonsyndromic, 
high-grade myopia is highly heritable, and to date multiple gene loci have been 
reported. We performed exome sequencing in 4 individuals from an 11-member 
family of European descent from the United States. Affected individuals had a 
mean dioptric spherical equivalent of -22.00 sphere. A premature stop codon 
mutation c.157C>T (p.Gln53*) cosegregating with disease was discovered within 
SCO2 that maps to chromosome 22q13.33. Subsequent analyses identified three 
additional mutations in three highly myopic unrelated individuals (c.341G>A, 
c.418G>A, and c.776C>T). To determine differential gene expression in a 
developmental mouse model, we induced myopia by applying a -15.00D lens over one 
eye. Messenger RNA levels of SCO2 were significantly downregulated in myopic 
mouse retinae. Immunohistochemistry in mouse eyes confirmed SCO2 protein 
localization in retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and sclera. SCO2 encodes for 
a copper homeostasis protein influential in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 
activity. Copper deficiencies have been linked with photoreceptor loss and 
myopia with increased scleral wall elasticity. Retinal thinning has been 
reported with an SC02 variant. Human mutation identification with support from 
an induced myopic animal provides biological insights of myopic development.
