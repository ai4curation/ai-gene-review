The M2 protein from influenza A virus is a pH-activated proton channel that 
mediates acidification of the interior of viral particles entrapped in 
endosomes. M2 is the target of the anti-influenza drugs amantadine and 
rimantadine; recently, resistance to these drugs in humans, birds and pigs has 
reached more than 90% (ref. 1). Here we describe the crystal structure of the 
transmembrane-spanning region of the homotetrameric protein in the presence and 
absence of the channel-blocking drug amantadine. pH-dependent structural changes 
occur near a set of conserved His and Trp residues that are involved in proton 
gating. The drug-binding site is lined by residues that are mutated in 
amantadine-resistant viruses. Binding of amantadine physically occludes the 
pore, and might also perturb the pK(a) of the critical His residue. The 
structure provides a starting point for solving the problem of resistance to 
M2-channel blockers.

Abstract

The influenza M2 protein forms an acid-activated and drug-sensitive proton channel in the virus envelope that is important for the virus lifecycle. The functional properties and high-resolution structures of this proton channel have been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms of proton conduction and drug inhibition. We review biochemical and electrophysiological studies of M2 and discuss how high-resolution structures have transformed our understanding of this proton channel. Comparison of structures obtained in different membrane-mimetic solvents and under different pH using X-ray crystallography, solution NMR, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy revealed how the M2 structure depends on the environment and showed that the pharmacologically relevant drug-binding site lies in the transmembrane (TM) pore. Competing models of proton conduction have been evaluated using biochemical experiments, high-resolution structural methods, and computational modeling. These results are converging to a model in which a histidine residue in the TM domain mediates proton relay with water, aided by microsecond conformational dynamics of the imidazole ring. These mechanistic insights are guiding the design of new inhibitors that target drug-resistant M2 variants and may be relevant for other proton channels.

Introduction

The M2 protein of the influenza A virus was first discovered as the protein target of the anti-influenza drug, amantadine. 1 This modular protein serves multiple functions, which are localized in different domains of the short 97-residue sequence. Its highly conserved N-terminal 23 residues are located on the outside of the virus and assist M2 incorporation into the virion. 2 Following this region is a transmembrane (TM) helix ( Fig. 1 ) that serves as a tetramerization and proton-conducting domain. Conduction of protons into the virion acidifies the virus after endocytosis and initiates viral uncoating. 6 , 7 Residues 46–60 form the next module, which helps induce membrane curvature and membrane scission to release newly assembled viruses from the host cell. 8 Finally, the C-terminal tail of the protein interacts with the matrix protein M1 and is essential for virus packaging and budding. 9 In some strains of the influenza A virus, M2 is also important for equilibrating the pH of the lumen of the Golgi apparatus with the cytoplasm, preventing premature conformational change of the viral hemagglutinin. 10 The M2 protein has been extensively studied because of its medical importance, particularly following the emergence of widespread resistance to M2-blocking drugs amantadine and rimantadine. 11 The small size and modular structure of M2 also make it attractive for biophysical studies.

This review will focus primarily on the structure and function of the TM domain of M2 (M2TM), which contains the proton-conducting residue, histidine 37 (His37), 12 and the channel-gating residue, tryptophan 41 (Trp41). 13 The TM domain reproduces most of the electrophysiological, pharmacological, and biophysical features of the full-length protein, such as low-pH activated proton conductivity, amantadine sensitivity of the proton current, and tetramerization of the protein. 14 – 16 Since its discovery and until 2008, the mechanism of proton conduction was extensively studied by electrophysiology, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 3 However, while these studies established the overall topology and approximate location of key side chains, no high-resolution structures were available. In 2008, this situation changed dramatically with the publication of solution NMR and crystallographic structures. 17 , 18 These were followed by solid-state NMR (SSNMR) structures of phospholipid-bilayer-bound M2. 5 , 19 In this review, we first summarize our understanding of M2’s mechanism of proton conduction and inhibition based on biochemical and electrophysiological studies. We then discuss how high-resolution structures have transformed our understanding of this proton channel. At times, high-resolution structures can give misleading results if their conclusions are not supported by functional data. Thus, to distinguish mechanistic conclusions based on biochemical data versus mechanistic insights from high-resolution structures, we review these subjects in separate sections. Because structures are emerging from several experimental methods, we also provide a brief technical description of the advantages as well as underlying uncertainties of the different methods.

Finally, we point to remaining areas of disagreement and open questions for future studies. Progress in the area of M2 has been punctuated by competing models of proton conduction and the site of pharmacological inhibition. Because these competing models were well defined and articulated, they stimulated new and more discriminating experiments and interpretation. The first debate concerned the proton conduction mechanism. An early model envisioned a continuous aqueous channel that was gated by pH (shutter mechanism), 20 versus the currently accepted model in which protons diffuse along a water wire until reaching His37, where they are then “shuttled” by His37 through alternate protonation and deprotonation events. A second debate focused on whether drugs inhibited the channel by binding to a site within the aqueous pore or on the surface of the protein. This debate stimulated extensive functional experiments 21 – 25 and SSNMR investigations. 5 , 26 , 27 The physiologically important site was eventually shown by SSNMR to lie in the pore, highlighting the utility of this atomic resolution spectroscopy for structure determination of membrane proteins in near-native lipid bilayers.

The primary remaining debate in the literature centers on the mechanism by which charge is stabilized in the His37 tetrad when it is protonated. One early model focused on a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) between His37 residues, which was motivated by the observation of a high p K a for the first two protonation steps. 28 A more recent study, however, suggested that the His37 cluster is less basic than originally anticipated. 29 Magic-angle spinning (MAS) SSNMR measurements of the His37 conformation and dynamics, 30 combined with crystal structure information, 31 indicate that His37 residues interact with each other indirectly via water molecules in the dominant structure at equilibrium. We present a model for conduction and inhibition that combines our understanding of the pharmacology and the full ensemble of structural and functional studies now accumulated for this proton channel.
