Phytochromes are informational photoreceptors through which plants adapt their 
growth and development to prevailing light conditions. These adaptations are 
effected primarily through phytochrome regulation of gene expression by 
mechanisms that remain unclear. We describe a new mutant, hfr1 (long hypocotyl 
in far-red), that exhibits a reduction in seedling responsiveness specifically 
to continuous far-red light (FRc), thereby suggesting a locus likely to be 
involved in phytochrome A (phyA) signal transduction. Using an insertionally 
tagged allele, we cloned the HFR1 gene and subsequently confirmed its identity 
with additional alleles derived from a directed genetic screen. HFR1 encodes a 
nuclear protein with strong similarity to the bHLH family of DNA-binding 
proteins but with an atypical basic region. In contrast to PIF3, a related bHLH 
protein previously shown to bind phyB, HFR1 did not bind either phyA or B. 
However, HFR1 did bind PIF3, suggesting heterodimerization, and both the 
HFR1/PIF3 complex and PIF3 homodimer bound preferentially to the Pfr form of 
both phytochromes. Thus, HFR1 may function to modulate phyA signaling via 
heterodimerization with PIF3. HFR1 mRNA is 30-fold more abundant in FRc than in 
continuous red light, suggesting a potential mechanistic basis for the 
specificity of HFR1 to phyA signaling.

Abstract

Phytochromes are informational photoreceptors through which plants
adapt their growth and development to prevailing light conditions.
These adaptations are effected primarily through phytochrome regulation
of gene expression by mechanisms that remain unclear. We describe a new
mutant, hfr1 (long h ypocotyl in f ar- r ed), that exhibits a reduction in seedling
responsiveness specifically to continuous far-red light (FRc), thereby
suggesting a locus likely to be involved in phytochrome A (phyA) signal
transduction. Using an insertionally tagged allele, we cloned the HFR1
gene and subsequently confirmed its identity with additional alleles
derived from a directed genetic screen. HFR1 encodes a nuclear protein
with strong similarity to the bHLH family of DNA-binding proteins but
with an atypical basic region. In contrast to PIF3, a related bHLH
protein previously shown to bind phyB, HFR1 did not bind either phyA or
B. However, HFR1 did bind PIF3, suggesting heterodimerization, and both
the HFR1/PIF3 complex and PIF3 homodimer bound preferentially to the
Pfr form of both phytochromes. Thus, HFR1 may function to modulate phyA
signaling via heterodimerization with PIF3. HFR1 mRNA is 30-fold more
abundant in FRc than in continuous red light, suggesting a potential
mechanistic basis for the specificity of HFR1 to phyA signaling.

Discussion

Considerable progress has been made in recent years in efforts to
define phytochrome signal transduction pathways ( Wei and Deng 1999 ; Nagy and Schäfer 2000 ; Neff et al. 2000 ). Genetic and molecular
approaches have identified a significant number of components that
potentially function as signaling intermediates and have provided
evidence of both shared and separate pathway branches for individual
phytochrome family members ( Soh et al. 1998 ; Bolle et al. 2000 ; Büche et al. 2000 ; Neff et al. 2000 ; Osterlund et al. 2000 ).
However, lacking until recently was evidence of a contiguous
transduction pathway, consisting of identified molecular intermediates,
that leads from phytochrome photoconversion to changes in gene
expression. The recent discoveries that phytochromes translocate to the
nucleus in response to light ( Sakamoto and Nagatani 1996 ; Kircher et
al. 1999 ; Yamaguchi et al. 1999 ) and that phyB can interact directly
with the bHLH protein, PIF3, bound to a DNA target site
( Martinez-Garcia et al. 2000 ) have suggested that one mode of
phytochrome signal transduction is the direct transcriptional
regulation of target genes. PIF3 was initially isolated as a
phytochrome-interacting factor in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Here we
have genetically identified a second member of the bHLH family, HFR1,
in a screen for components specific to the phyA signaling pathway and
have shown that HFR1 can heterodimerize with PIF3. These data support
and extend the hypothesis that phytochromes can regulate target genes
directly and open up the possibility that they may do so via multiple
heterodimerizing members of the bHLH family of transcription factors,
which might regulate gene expression in combinatorial fashion.

The observation that loss-of-function mutations in HFR1 result
in a FRc-specific phenotype indicates that HFR1 functions positively in
the phyA signaling pathway. Furthermore, the normal, or even increased,
level of phyA protein and its normal photoconversion activity in hfr1 mutants imply that HFR1 is an authentic signal
transducer, rather than a protein involved in phyA synthesis or
assembly. In these respects, hfr1 mutants are similar to other
FRc-specific, loss-of-response mutants that have been identified
previously, far1 ( Hudson et al. 1999 ), fhy1 and fhy3 ( Whitelam et al. 1993 ), fin2 ( Soh et al. 1998 ),
and pat1 ( Bolle et al. 2000 ).

However, the subset of developmental responses to FRc that are affected
in hfr1 mutants differs from the subset affected in other
phyA-signaling mutants. The most consistent hfr1 phenotype is
limited to a clear, partial loss of FRc-suppression of hypocotyl
elongation and negative gravitropism. The hypocotyl elongation and
gravitropism defects of hfr1-1 strictly cosegregate, and this
correlation is maintained in the hfr1-2 homozygotes that lack
the hfr1-1 T-DNA insertion, thereby indicating that both
defects result from mutation of HFR1 . Except for fin2 , which appears to show a loss of FRc suppression of
hypocotyl gravitropism similar to hfr1 ( Soh et al. 1998 ), the
effects on hypocotyl gravitropism of mutations in other phyA-signaling
loci have not been established. In phyA-signaling mutants other than hfr1 , a wider range of responses to FRc is affected, including
the stimulation of anthocyanin production and the loss of greening on
transfer to white light ( Barnes et al. 1996 ; Soh et al. 1998 ; Hudson et
al. 1999 ; Bolle et al. 2000 ). These FRc responses are consistently
unaffected in hfr1 mutants. The specificity of the hfr1 phenotype for particular FRc responses suggests that HFR1
may direct phyA signals primarily to the subset of phyA-regulated genes
that drive these responses.

Although three other genes specific for phyA signaling have been
molecularly cloned— SPA1 ( Hoecker et al. 1999 ), FAR1 ( Hudson et al. 1999 ) and PAT1 ( Bolle et al. 2000 )— HFR1 is the
only one of these whose sequence offers an obvious prediction of its
biochemical role. The sequence homology of HFR1 to members of the bHLH
family of transcription factors, along with potential nuclear
localization signals, suggests that it might be a transcription factor.
The demonstrated constitutive nuclear localization of transiently
expressed HFR1 in onion epidermal cells and the binding affinity of
HFR1 for its closest homolog, PIF3, are consistent with this
suggestion. PIF3 has similarly been shown to be constitutively nuclear
( Ni et al. 1998 ), and there is more substantial evidence that PIF3 may
act as a transcription factor. PIF3 alone can bind DNA, with a strong
preference for the G-box core motif and some specificity for one
flanking base on either side of it (cCACGTGg), and appears to be
involved in the induction of the genes CCA1 and LHY within 1 h of a light signal ( Martinez-Garcia et al. 2000 ). In
addition, the PIF3 two-hybrid chimera with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain
has transcriptional activation activity in yeast ( Ni et al. 1998 ).
However, we have not yet attempted to determine whether HFR1 binds
directly to DNA, and in contrast to PIF3, the analogous HFR1 two-hybrid
chimera exhibits no detectable intrinsic transcriptional activation
activity in yeast.

Does the unusual basic region of HFR1 predict a lack of affinity for
DNA or DNA binding with a sequence specificity distinct from that of
other bHLH proteins? In all reported cases, other bHLH proteins that
have unusual basic regions ultimately have been found to bind DNA with
an altered sequence specificity ( Littlewood and Evan 1998 ; Atchley et
al. 1999 ). The two key differences between HFR1 and a consensus basic
region (Fig. 4 B, arrows) are partly reflected in other bHLH proteins.
The highly conserved glutamate residue (arginine at position 22 in Fig. 5 B), which is integral to E-box (CAnnTG) sequence recognition ( Atchley
et al. 1999 ), is not retained in some members of the bHLH-PAS family.
In AhR, it is a serine, in Sim an alanine. The 5′ recognition
sequence half-sites preferred by AhR (T(c/t)GC) and Sim (GT(a/g)C) are
distinct from the E-box half-sites (CAn) preferred by their
heterodimerizing partner Arnt and other conventional bHLH proteins
( Sogawa et al. 1995 ; Swanson et al. 1995 ). By analogy, HFR1 would be
expected to recognize a non-E-box sequence. Similarly, the other
unusual HFR1 residue (aspartate at position 26 in Fig. 5 B) is an
arginine in G-box binding bHLH proteins, including PIF3. Substitutions
for this arginine, which is involved in the recognition of the central
CG of the G-box (CACGTG), confer specificity for a different central
pair within the E-box core ( Littlewood and Evan 1998 ; Atchley et al.
1999 ). Together, the unusual substitutions in the HFR1 basic region may
specify a recognition element that lacks similarity to the G-box
preferred by PIF3.

Our demonstration that HFR1 is a PIF3-binding bHLH protein may be the
first indication that a network of bHLH proteins is involved in the
regulation of plant development by phytochromes. Many animal bHLH
proteins act as components of complex regulatory networks that include
cross-dimerizing DNA-binding activators and repressors of
transcription, as well as HLH inhibitors of bHLH DNA-binding
( Littlewood and Evan 1998 ; Atchley et al. 1999 ; Massari and Murre
2000 ). This type of bHLH network has not been demonstrated in plants,
though a small number of bHLH proteins have been implicated in various
processes, including the regulation of tissue-specific production of
anthocyanin by the R/B proteins ( Ludwig and Wessler 1990 ; Lesnick and
Chandler 1998 ), and the induction of a dehydration-response gene by
rd22BP1 ( Abe et al. 1997 ). Many more bHLH proteins of unknown function
have been revealed by genomic sequencing of Arabidopsis .
Perhaps some of these bHLH proteins will be found to be involved in
light regulation of gene expression in collaboration with PIF3 and HFR1.

Whatever the nature of HFR1 activity, it appears to be largely specific
for responses to FRc, though essentially the same phenotypic responses
are induced by Rc in wild-type Arabidopsis . An attractively
simple hypothetical mechanism for HFR1 FRc specificity would be for
HFR1 to bind phyA specifically. However, we failed to find any evidence
for a direct HFR1/phyA interaction, either by yeast two-hybrid or
coimmunoprecipitation assays. It remains possible that a direct
HFR1/phyA interaction requires a plant-specific posttranslational
modification of HFR1 or phyA, but we have no evidence for this.

The HFR1/phytochrome complex that we have demonstrated here requires
PIF3, which might act as a bridge between its individual interactors,
HFR1 and phytochrome (Fig. 9 , middle). The
HFR1/PIF3 complex is drawn as a heterodimer rather than a higher-order
complex, though we have only very preliminary evidence for this from
native gel electrophoresis of proteins expressed in vitro (C.D.
Fairchild and P.H. Quail, unpubl.). The evidence for an
HFR1/PIF3/phytochrome complex does little to explain the observed FRc
specificity of HFR1 function, given that PIF3 binds both phyA and phyB.
It is tempting to speculate that in place of, or in addition to PIF3, a
phyA-specific binding protein might bridge HFR1 and phyA. Obvious
candidates for such a phyA-specific binding protein are the apparently
phyA-specific signal transducers that have been identified genetically, but no
evidence has yet been presented for a phyA-specific interacting protein.

The 30-fold greater abundance of HFR1 mRNA in FRc relative to
Rc that we have observed might be sufficient to explain the FRc
specificity of HFR1 action, if this difference in mRNA level translates
to a similar difference in HFR1 protein activity in the two light
conditions. The role of HFR1 could be to confer a different DNA
sequence specificity on the PIF3/phyA complex and, thus, to adjust the
gene-regulatory output of phyA (Fig. 9 ). The apparent FRc-specificity
of HFR1 activity might then be determined by a complex, reciprocal
regulation of HFR1 abundance by Rc and FRc (Fig. 9 ).
