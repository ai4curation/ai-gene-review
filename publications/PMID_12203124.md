## Abstract

1. Oncogene. 2002 Sep 5;21(39):6123-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205842.

The Brn-3a transcription factor inhibits the pro-apoptotic effect of p53 and 
enhances cell cycle arrest by differentially regulating the activity of the p53 
target genes encoding Bax and p21(CIP1/Waf1).

We have previously shown that the anti-apoptotic transcription factor, Brn-3a 
and the pro-apoptotic p53 factor have antagonistic effects on the promoter of 
the gene encoding the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, with p53 abolishing 
activation by Brn-3a. Here we demonstrate that this antagonism is also observed 
on the gene encoding the pro-apoptotic Bax protein with Brn-3a abolishing the 
ability of p53 to activate the Bax promoter and induce Bax protein expression. 
In contrast, Brn-3a and p53 co-operative to induce maximal activation of another 
p53 target gene encoding the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(CIP1/Waf1). 
These differential effects of Brn-3a on p53-inducible genes involved in 
apoptosis or growth arrest are paralleled by its effects on these processes 
themselves. Thus, we show that Brn-3a antagonises the anti-apoptotic effect of 
p53 but co-operates with p53 to induce cell cycle arrest. The potential role of 
Brn-3a in determining the outcome of enhanced p53 levels is discussed.
