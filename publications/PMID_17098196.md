Electron cryomicroscopy reveals an unprecedented conformation of the single-ring 
mutant of GroEL (SR398) bound to GroES in the presence of Mg-ATP. This 
conformation exhibits a considerable expansion of the folding cavity, with 
approximately 80% more volume than the X-ray structure of the equivalent cis 
cavity in the GroEL-GroES-(ADP)(7) complex. This expanded conformation can 
encapsulate an 86 kDa heterodimeric (alphabeta) assembly intermediate of 
mitochondrial branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, the largest substrate 
ever observed to be cis encapsulated. The SR398-GroES-Mg-ATP complex is found to 
exist as a mixture of standard and expanded conformations, regardless of the 
absence or presence of the substrate. However, the presence of even a small 
substrate causes a pronounced bias toward the expanded conformation. 
Encapsulation of the large assembly intermediate is supported by a series of 
electron cryomicroscopy studies as well as the protection of both alpha and beta 
subunits of the substrate from tryptic digestion.
