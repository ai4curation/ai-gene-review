Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a plant defense state that is induced, for 
example, after previous pathogen infection or by chemicals that mimic natural 
signaling compounds. SAR is associated with the ability to induce cellular 
defense responses more rapidly and to a greater degree than in noninduced 
plants, a process called "priming." Arabidopsis plants were treated with the 
synthetic SAR inducer benzothiadiazole (BTH) before stimulating two prominent 
cellular defense responses, namely Phe AMMONIA-LYASE (PAL) gene activation and 
callose deposition. Although BTH itself was essentially inactive at the 
immediate induction of these two responses, the pretreatment with BTH greatly 
augmented the subsequent PAL gene expression induced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. 
tomato infection, wounding, or infiltrating the leaves with water. The BTH 
pretreatment also enhanced the production of callose, which was induced by 
wounding or infiltrating the leaves with water. It is interesting that the 
potentiation by BTH pretreatment of PAL gene activation and callose deposition 
was not seen in the Arabidopsis nonexpresser of PR genes 1/noninducible immunity 
1 mutant, which is compromised in SAR. In a converse manner, augmented PAL gene 
activation and enhanced callose biosynthesis were found, without BTH 
pretreatment, in the Arabidopsis constitutive expresser of pathogenesis-related 
genes (cpr)1 and constitutive expresser of pathogenesis-related genes 5 mutants, 
in which SAR is constitutive. Moreover, priming for potentiated defense gene 
activation was also found in pathogen-induced SAR. In sum, the results suggest 
that priming is an important cellular mechanism in acquired disease resistance 
of plants that requires the nonexpresser of PR genes 1/noninducible immunity 1 
gene.

Abstract

Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a plant defense state that is induced, for example, after previous pathogen infection or by chemicals that mimic natural signaling compounds. SAR is associated with the ability to induce cellular defense responses more rapidly and to a greater degree than in noninduced plants, a process called “priming.” Arabidopsis plants were treated with the synthetic SAR inducer benzothiadiazole (BTH) before stimulating two prominent cellular defense responses, namely Phe AMMONIA-LYASE ( PAL ) gene activation and callose deposition. Although BTH itself was essentially inactive at the immediate induction of these two responses, the pretreatment with BTH greatly augmented the subsequent PAL gene expression induced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato infection, wounding, or infiltrating the leaves with water. The BTH pretreatment also enhanced the production of callose, which was induced by wounding or infiltrating the leaves with water. It is interesting that the potentiation by BTH pretreatment of PAL gene activation and callose deposition was not seen in the Arabidopsis nonexpresser of PR genes 1/noninducible immunity 1 mutant, which is compromised in SAR. In a converse manner, augmented PAL gene activation and enhanced callose biosynthesis were found, without BTH pretreatment, in the Arabidopsis constitutive expresser of pathogenesis-related genes ( cpr ) 1 and constitutive expresser of pathogenesis-related genes 5 mutants, in which SAR is constitutive. Moreover, priming for potentiated defense gene activation was also found in pathogen-induced SAR. In sum, the results suggest that priming is an important cellular mechanism in acquired disease resistance of plants that requires the nonexpresser of PR genes 1/noninducible immunity 1 gene.

DISCUSSION

In these experiments, we investigated the influence of pretreatment of Arabidopsis with BTH on the activation of two representative cellular defense responses, PAL gene activation and callose deposition. By doing so, we found that whereas directly activating (Figs. 1 , A and B, and 5, A and B) or augmenting (Fig. 4 ) the PR-1 gene, BTH was not, or only slightly, active at the immediate induction of the PAL gene (Figs. 1 , A and B; 2, A and B; 3; 5, A and B; and 6, A and B), even at concentrations of up to 1 m m (data not shown). Also, the BTH treatment only slightly activated callose production (Figs. 1 C; 2, A and B; and 5C). However, a pretreatment with BTH prepared the Arabidopsis plants for stronger PAL gene activation (Figs. 1 , A and B; 2, A and B; 3; 4; 5, A and B; and 6, A and B) and improved callose deposition (Figs. 1 C; 2, A and B; and 5C), thus demonstrating a dual role for BTH at the activation of defense responses in Arabidopsis: a direct one by immediately inducing PR-1 , and an indirect one by priming the plants for stronger stimulation of callose biosynthesis and PAL gene activation. As PAL is a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid metabolism, which is thought to include the biosynthesis pathway of SA ( Chong et al., 2001 ), the potentiated activation of the PAL gene in primed Arabidopsis plants may further amplify the induction of SA biosynthesis to better mediate disease resistance.

Because BTH, wounding, or water infiltration do not cause production of SA in various plants, including Arabidopsis ( Malamy et al., 1990 ; Friedrich et al., 1996 ; Lawton et al., 1996 ), we can exclude the possibility that pretreatment with BTH allows a critical level of SA to be reached, thus leading to augmented defense response activation upon further stimulation by wounding or infiltration of water. In contrast to wounding and water infiltration, Pst DC3000 infection causes some accumulation of SA in Arabidopsis ( Cameron et al., 1999 ). However, SA biosynthesis requires prolonged activation of PAL , which was not significantly induced by Pst DC3000 in our experiments (Figs. 1 A, 4 , 5 A, and 6 A). As we assayed PAL gene expression as early as 3 to 4 h post- Pst DC3000 inoculation, it is unlikely that the effects seen after infection with Pst DC3000 are due to a synergistic action of BTH and Pst DC3000-induced SA.

BTH-pretreated Arabidopsis plants show stronger PAL gene activation or/and enhanced callose deposition upon Pst DC3000 infection (Figs. 1 A, 5 A, and 6 A), slightly squeezing the leaves with forceps, or infiltrating them with water (Figs. 1 , B and C; 2–4; 5, B and C; and 6B). In analogy to the situation in water-infiltrated rice ( Oryza sativa ) leaves, which display enhanced activity of genes encoding the stress marker enzyme phospholipase D ( Yang et al., 1996 ), we assume that our water infiltration method may cause cell damage in infiltrated Arabidopsis leaves. The latter may explain why infiltration of water and wounding with forceps cause some identical responses in primed Arabidopsis leaves (Figs. 1 , B and C; 2–4; and 5, B and C). If this assumption holds true, the present study demonstrates that primed Arabidopsis plants are in an alerted state that improves the induction of the pathogen defense and wound responses.

Though the identity of the common step(s) in the regulation of pathogen and wound/water infiltration responses still remains unknown, our data indicate that the NPR1/NIM1 gene and priming may be common components that mediate crosstalk between these types of defense responses in Arabidopsis ( Maleck and Dietrich, 1999 ). This conclusion is drawn from our finding that the improvement of responses to wounding, water infiltration, and pathogen attack cannot be induced in the Arabidopsis npr1/nim1 mutant (Fig. 5 ), whereas priming for the wound reaction and the pathogen response was found constitutively present in cpr1 and cpr5 mutant plants (Fig. 6 ). In an alternate manner, feedback from products of BTH/SA-responsive genes downstream of NPR1/NIM1 may act to modify defense responses that are located upstream of BTH/SA in the cell's disease resistance mechanism ( Delaney, 1997 ), perhaps even PAL gene activation.

Priming and the resulting potentiation of cellular defense responses are absent in the Arabidopsis npr1/nim1 mutant (Fig. 5 ), which also is defective in the expression of certain defense-related genes and SAR ( Cao et al., 1994 ; Delaney et al., 1995 ). Priming and defense response potentiation were permanently and consistently present in the cpr1 and cpr5 mutants (Fig. 6 ) in which PR gene expression and SAR are constitutive ( Bowling et al., 1994 , 1997 ). Also, there is a close correlation between the ability of various compounds to activate certain PR genes and to elicit SAR and their capability to potentiate defense gene activation in Arabidopsis (Fig. 3 ). Therefore, it is very likely that priming, in addition to the immediate activation of certain PR genes, is an important mechanism in SAR of plants. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that Arabidopsis plants with pathogen-induced SAR are also primed for enhanced defense gene activation subsequently induced by Pst DC3000 challenge infection, wounding the leaves with forceps, or infiltrating them with water (Fig. 4 ). It is interesting that the constitutive induction of SAR in the Arabidopsis defense , no death1 mutant has been assumed to substitute for hypersensitive cell death in potentiating the gene-for-gene defense response ( Yu et al., 1998 ). Moreover, the enhanced disease resistance of the Arabidopsis cpr5-2 mutant has been ascribed to the potentiated induction of the PR-1 gene in these plants ( Boch et al., 1998 ). Finally, an attenuation of priming for potentiated induction of the oxidative burst has been associated with a loss of resistance to avirulent bacterial pathogens in tobacco ( Mur et al., 2000 ).

The Arabidopsis cpr1 and cpr5 mutants constitutively display enhanced disease resistance, and they permanently accumulate PR proteins ( Bowling et al., 1994 , 1997 ). We cannot completely exclude the possibility that constitutive priming in these mutants might be caused by the activation of various stress response mechanisms besides the SAR pathway ( Bowling et al., 1994 , 1997 ). However, we speculate that due to the enhanced levels of SA in the cpr mutants ( Bowling et al., 1994 , 1997 ), these are permanently in a primed state that leads to constitutive PR gene expression and also keeps the plants on the alert. This situation is similar to the one in wild-type plants that have been previously infected by an avirulent pathogen or pretreated with SA or BTH. Due to constitutive priming, the cpr1 and cpr5 mutants are able to rapidly and effectively activate their various cellular defense responses once attacked by a pathogen (Fig. 6 A) or stimulated by wounding (Fig. 6 , B and C).

SAR, PR gene expression, and priming for augmented pathogen, wound, and water infiltration responses in Arabidopsis obviously require the intact NPR1/NIM1 protein. This is concluded from previous results demonstrating absence of SAR and PR gene expression in npr1/nim1 mutant plants, despite the accumulation of SA ( Cao et al., 1994 ; Delaney et al., 1995 ), and from the finding that the potentiation of cellular defense responses is not detected in mutants with a defective NPR1/NIM1 gene (Fig. 5 ).

The Dong group ( Zhang et al., 1999 ), Klessig and coworkers ( Zhou et al., 2000 ), as well as Després et al. (2000) reported that the Arabidopsis NPR1/NIM1 protein may interact with transcription factors of the TGA/octopine synthase element binding factor basic Leu zipper protein family to activate the PR-1 gene in Arabidopsis. Based on our data, we conclude that during pretreatment with inducers of SAR, there might be synthesis and/or activation of one or more cellular factors, some of which may represent defense-related gene products, that shift the plants to the primed state. This factor(s) may then play a role in the immediate activation of certain other defense-related genes, such as the Arabidopsis PR-1 gene. By binding to the promoter of defense genes, such as the PAL and PR-1 gene of Arabidopsis, the cellular factor(s) might be able to also prepare their target gene(s) for better expression once stimulated by pathogen attack, wounding, or water infiltration.

It should be noted that in other plants, priming for enhanced induction of defense responses can also be induced by pretreatment with the signaling molecule methyl jasmonate ( Kauss et al., 1992b ). In addition, Zimmerli et al. (2000) recently demonstrated potentiated accumulation of PR-1 transcripts in Pst DC3000-infected Arabidopsis plants that had been primed with β-aminobutyric acid. Moreover, preincubation with the wound-generated peptide messenger systemin enhanced a rapid H 2 O 2 burst induced by the addition of oligogalacturonides or water to tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum ) cell suspension cultures ( Stennis et al., 1998 ). Together, these observations indicate a complex, multi-entrance nature for plant cell priming.
