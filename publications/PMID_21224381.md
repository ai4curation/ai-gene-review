The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways are highly organized 
signaling systems that transduce extracellular signals into a variety of 
intracellular responses. In this context, it is currently poorly understood how 
kinases constituting these signaling cascades are assembled and activated in 
response to receptor stimulation to generate specific cellular responses. Here, 
we show that AKAP-Lbc, an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) with an intrinsic 
Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, is critically involved 
in the activation of the p38α MAPK downstream of α(1b)-adrenergic receptors 
(α(1b)-ARs). Our results indicate that AKAP-Lbc can assemble a novel 
transduction complex containing the RhoA effector PKNα, MLTK, MKK3, and p38α, 
which integrates signals from α(1b)-ARs to promote RhoA-dependent activation of 
p38α. In particular, silencing of AKAP-Lbc expression or disrupting the 
formation of the AKAP-Lbc·p38α signaling complex specifically reduces 
α(1)-AR-mediated p38α activation without affecting receptor-mediated activation 
of other MAPK pathways. These findings provide a novel mechanistic hypothesis 
explaining how assembly of macromolecular complexes can specify MAPK signaling 
downstream of α(1)-ARs.
