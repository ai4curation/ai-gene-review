Nuclear factor I-X3 (NFI-X3) is a newly identified splice variant of NFI-X that 
regulates expression of several astrocyte-specific markers, such as glial 
fibrillary acidic protein. Here, we identified a set of genes regulated by 
NFI-X3 that includes a gene encoding a secreted glycoprotein YKL-40. Although 
YKL-40 expression is up-regulated in glioblastoma multiforme, its regulation and 
functions in nontransformed cells of the central nervous system are widely 
unexplored. We find that expression of YKL-40 is activated during brain 
development and also differentiation of neural progenitors into astrocytes in 
vitro. Furthermore, YKL-40 is a migration factor for primary astrocytes, and its 
expression is controlled by both NFI-X3 and STAT3, which are known regulators of 
gliogenesis. Knockdown of NFI-X3 and STAT3 significantly reduced YKL-40 
expression in astrocytes, whereas overexpression of NFI-X3 dramatically enhanced 
YKL-40 expression in glioma cells. Activation of STAT3 by oncostatin M induced 
YKL-40 expression in astrocytes, whereas expression of a dominant-negative STAT3 
had a suppressive effect. Mechanistically, NFI-X3 and STAT3 form a complex that 
binds to weak regulatory elements in the YKL-40 promoter and activates 
transcription. We propose that NFI-X3 and STAT3 control the migration of 
differentiating astrocytes as well as migration and invasion of glioma cells via 
regulating YKL-40 expression.
