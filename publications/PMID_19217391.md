Coactivators CREB-binding protein and p300 play important roles in mediating the 
transcriptional activity of p53. Until now, however, no detailed structural 
information has been available on how any of the domains of p300 interact with 
p53. Here, we report the NMR structure of the complex of the Taz2 (C/H3) domain 
of p300 and the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53. In the complex, p53 
forms a short alpha helix and interacts with the Taz2 domain through an extended 
surface. Mutational analyses demonstrate the importance of hydrophobic residues 
for complex stabilization. Additionally, they suggest that the increased 
affinity of Taz2 for p53(1-39) phosphorylated at Thr(18) is due in part to 
electrostatic interactions of the phosphate with neighboring arginine residues 
in Taz2. Thermodynamic experiments revealed the importance of hydrophobic 
interactions in the complex of Taz2 with p53 phosphorylated at Ser(15) and 
Thr(18).

Discussion

The p53 TAD has been described as intrinsically disordered ( Dunker et al. 2005 ). Frequently, intrinsically disordered protein domains are able to take on a number of conformations, particularly in complex with other proteins, to effect different biological outcomes ( Vise et al. 2007 ). In the free form, the TAD of p53 is flexible and unstructured. Recently, it has been demonstrated that TAD1 forms a dynamic α-helix, while two turns can be observed within TAD2 ( Lee et al. 2000 , Vise et al. 2005 ). This dynamic structure allows p53 to be involved in a variety of cellular responses by conforming to the proteins with which it interacts. In four previously determined structures of p53 TAD peptides in complex with proteins, both TAD1 and TAD2 have been found to form short α-helices and the binding was shown to be mediated by hydrophobic interactions ( Bochkareva et al. 2005 , Di Lello et al. 2006 , Kussie et al. 1996 , Popowicz et al. 2008 ).

The complex of p53 TAD1 with Taz2 is similar to the complexes formed with MDM2 and MDMX, in which p53 18-26 forms an amphipathic helix. Although hydrophobic interactions are important in all three interfaces, the specific residues involved in the interactions differ. In the MDM2 and MDMX complexes, Phe 19 , Trp 23 , and Leu 26 form the primary hydrophobic interactions, whereas in the Taz2 complex, we find that Phe 19 , Leu 22 , and Leu 25 are the most critical. Indeed, Trp 23 and Leu 26 project away from Taz2, whereas Leu 25 projects away from MDM2 ( Figure S6 ). We further observed that mutation of Leu 26 , important for MDM2 binding, did not affect binding of p53 to Taz2. In addition, although it is not buried in the hydrophobic pocket on MDM2 ( Figure S6B ), p53 Leu 22 makes hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the complex ( Kussie et al. 1996 ). As observed for p53 binding to Taz2, mutation of Leu 22 to alanine also disrupts binding of p53 to MDM2 ( Picksley et al. 1994 ). Although both complexes involve binding to α-helical regions of p53, the binding of p53 to MDM2 requires a shorter segment of p53 and has a higher affinity. In contrast, we found that the binding of p53 to Taz2 is approximately an order of magnitude weaker ( K d = 0.4 μM for binding to MDM2 and 3 μM for binding to Taz2) and involves a longer region of p53. The structure of the p53/MDM2 complex shows that p53 fits into a deep hydrophobic cleft on MDM2, with key hydrophobic residues buried in the interface. Although the interaction with Taz2 also involves hydrophobic interactions, p53 lies across the surface of Taz2 formed by helices α1, α2, and α3. The extended interaction site of p53 TAD1 on Taz2 is reflected in the greater loss of solvent-accessible surface area for this complex than that calculated for the MDM2-p53 15-29 complex ( Kussie et al. 1996 ). The Taz2-p53 2-39 complex shares common features with other complexes of intrinsically disordered domains, including large interaction area, large exposed surface area per residue, and binding through a single continuous segment of the protein ( Meszaros et al. 2007 ). Based upon the observed changes in polar and non-polar solvent accessible surface area upon Taz2-p53 2-39 complexation, we estimated Δ Cp for complex formation to be -244 cal/mol·K ( Loladze et al. 2001 ). This value is very similar to value of Δ Cp determined from thermodynamic measurements (Jenkins et al. 2009 Biochemistry DOI:10.1021/bi801716h).

Our structural and binding studies allow better understanding of the molecular basis for the increased binding affinity between Taz2 and p53 1-39 upon phosphorylation at Ser 15 and Thr 18 . In the Taz2-p53 2-39 complex, p53 Ser 15 and Thr 18 are located in a basic environment on Taz2 ( Figure 2 ); thus, phosphorylation at these sites contributes to increased affinity through stabilizing interactions. Similarly, it has been suggested that the decreased affinity of phosphorylated p53 for MDM2 is due to a local acidic environment near Thr 18 and Ser 20 on MDM2 that repels these residues when phosphorylated ( Lee et al. 2007 ). As phosphorylation has been suggested to stabilize helical conformation when it occurs at the N-terminus ( Smart and McCammon 1999 ), modification of Ser 15 may also stabilize the p53 helix, thereby increasing the affinity for Taz2. Although Arg 1731 and Arg 1732 play a role in stabilization of phosphorylation at Thr 18 ( Table 4 ), the more negative ΔCp for the modified form compared to the non-phosphorylated form ( Table 2 ) suggests that, consistent with changes observed in the chemical shift mapping experiments, the extent of hydrophobic interactions increased for p53 1-39 Thr18p. The less negative Δ C p observed for binding of p53 2-39 Ser15p, Thr18p to Taz2 ( Table 2 ) suggests an increase in electrostatic interactions in this complex and/or a decrease in the extent of hydrophobic interactions, possibly due to conformational restriction imposed by the two modifications. Thus, the structural and thermodynamic data suggest a means for modulation of the interaction of Taz2 and p53 TAD1 upon p53 phosphorylation.

The interaction between p53 and the Taz2 domain of p300 is crucial for p53 activity, and biological experiments have shown that phosphorylation modulates this interaction ( Avantaggiati et al. 1997 ). The increased affinity for Taz2 upon p53 phosphorylation may amplify the p53 response through repression of alternate signaling pathways. Following DNA damage-induced p53 phosphorylation, the increased affinity of p53 for p300 may reduce the interaction of p300 with other transcription factors through competition, thereby decreasing their activity while increasing that of p53. Acetylation of p53 by p300 may further enhance this affect by promoting coactivator recruitment by p53 and subsequent histone acetylation ( Barlev et al. 2001 ). This mechanism of repression by p53 would allow for amplification of the p53 response to DNA damage, an effect necessary to elicit cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Additionally, phosphorylation p53 on Thr 18 results in weaker binding to MDM2, disrupting the MDM2/p53 complex and allowing p53 to recruit p300.

The structural studies presented here describe the molecular determinants of the binding of p53 TAD1 to the Taz2 domain of p300, a crucial interaction for p53-mediated transcriptional activation. The interaction is stabilized in part by hydrophobic interactions, mediated by Phe 19 , Leu 22 , and Leu 25 . In addition, the extent of hydrophobic interaction is also increased upon p53 phosphorylation at either Ser 15 or Thr 18 , suggesting a possible rearrangement of the interaction with the phosphorylated protein as compared with the unmodified form. These vital modifications control the response of p53 following DNA damage by modulating its affinity for other proteins and thereby controlling whether it is degraded or stabilized and activated. Thus, details of how post-translational modifications regulate the protein-protein interactions of p53 at the molecular level are required to fully understand its functions.
