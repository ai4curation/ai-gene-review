Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) and thrombospondin-1 
(TS-1) are both present in extracellular matrix (ECM). Both proteins have been 
shown to bind to one another with high affinity. The purpose of these studies 
was to determine how the interaction between IGFBP-5 and TS-1 modulates IGF-I 
actions in porcine aortic smooth muscle cells (pSMC) in culture. The addition of 
increasing concentrations of TS-1 to pSMC cultures enhanced the protein 
synthesis and cell migration responses to IGF-I; whereas the addition of IGFBP-5 
alone resulted in minimal changes. In contrast, the addition of IGFBP-5 to 
cultures that were also exposed to IGF-I and TS-1 resulted in inhibition of 
protein synthesis. When the cell migration response was assessed, the response 
to IGF-I plus TS-1 was also significantly inhibited by the addition of IGFBP-5, 
whereas 1.0 microg/ml of IGFBP-5 alone had no effect on the response to IGF-I. 
To determine the molecular mechanism by which this inhibition occurred, a mutant 
form of IGFBP-5 that does not bind to IGF-I was tested. This mutant was 
equipotent compared to native IGFBP-5 in its ability to inhibit both protein 
synthesis and cell migration responses to IGF-I plus TS-1 thus excluding the 
possibility that IGFBP-5 was inhibiting the response to TS-1 and IGF-I by 
inhibiting IGF-I binding to the IGF-I receptor. To determine if an interaction 
between TS-1 and IGFBP-5 was the primary determinant of the inhibitory effect of 
IGFBP-5, an IGFBP-5 mutant that bound poorly to TS-1 was utilized. The addition 
of 1.0 microg/ml of this mutant did not inhibit the protein synthesis or cell 
migration responses to IGF-I plus TS-1. To determine the mechanism by which 
IGFBP-5 binding to TS-1 inhibited cellular responses to TS-1 plus IGF-I, TS-1 
binding to integrin associated protein (IAP) was assessed. The addition of 
IGFBP-5 (1.0 microg/ml) inhibited TS-1-IAP association. In contrast, a mutant 
form of IGFBP-5 that bound poorly to TS-1 had a minimal effect on TS-1 binding 
to IAP. Further analysis showed that IGFBP-5 addition altered the ability of 
TS-1 to modulate the SHPS-1/IAP interaction. When the IGFBP-5 mutant that did 
not bind to IGF-I was incubated with TS-1 and IGF-I, it inhibited the capacity 
of TS-1 to enhance the IGF-I receptor phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation 
in response to IGF-I. In contrast, the IGFBP-5 mutant that did not bind to TS-1 
had no effect on IGF-I stimulated IGF-I receptor phosphorylation or MAP kinase 
activation. These results indicate that IGFBP-5 inhibits the binding of TS-1 to 
IAP, and this results in an alteration of the ability of TS-1 to modulate the 
disruption of the IAP/SHPS-1 interaction which leads to attenuation of the 
ability of TS-1 to enhance cellular responsiveness to IGF-I.
