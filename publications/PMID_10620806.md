Here, to study lipid-protein interactions that contribute to the biogenesis of 
regulated secretory vesicles, we have developed new approaches by which to label 
proteins in vivo, using photoactivatable cholesterol and glycerophospholipids. 
We identify synaptophysin as a major specifically cholesterol-binding protein in 
PC12 cells and brain synaptic vesicles. Limited cholesterol depletion, which has 
little effect on total endocytic activity, blocks the biogenesis of 
synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) from the plasma membrane. We propose that 
specific interactions between cholesterol and SLMV membrane proteins, such as 
synaptophysin, contribute to both the segregation of SLMV membrane constituents 
from plasma-membrane constituents, and the induction of synaptic-vesicle 
curvature.
