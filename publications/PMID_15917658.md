Lte1, a protein important for exit from mitosis, localizes to the bud cortex as 
soon as the bud forms and remains there until cells exit from mitosis. Ras, the 
Rho GTPase Cdc42 and its effector the protein kinase Cla4 are required for 
Lte1's association with the bud cortex. Here we investigate how Ras, and the 
Cdc42 effector Cla4 regulate the localization of Lte1. We find that Ras2 and 
Lte1 associate in stages of the cell cycle when Lte1 is phosphorylated and 
associated with the bud cortex and that this association requires CLA4. 
Additionally, RAS1 and RAS2 are required for CLA4-dependent Lte1 
phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that Cla4-dependent phosphorylation 
promotes the initial association of Lte1 with Ras at the bud cortex and that Ras 
is required to stabilize phosphorylated forms of Lte1 at the bud cortex. Our 
results also raise the interesting possibility that the localization of Lte1 
affects the protein's ability to promote mitotic exit.
