Polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded proteins are associated with cytotoxicity in some 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease. We have reported that 
the aggregation of the polyQ-expanded protein is partially suppressed by 
co-expression of either of two homologs of an AAA chaperone p97, CDC-48.1 or 
CDC-48.2, in Caenorhabditis elegans, but how p97 regulates the aggregation of 
polyQ-expanded proteins remains unclear. Here we present direct evidence that 
CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 suppress the aggregation of a huntingtin (Htt) exon1 
fragment containing an expanded polyQ repeat in vitro. CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 
bound the Htt exon1 fragment directly, and suppressed the formation of 
SDS-insoluble aggregates of Htt fragments containing 53 glutamine residues 
(HttQ53) independently of nucleotides. CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 also modulated the 
oligomeric states of HttQ53 during the aggregate formation. In the absence of 
CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2, HttQ53 formed 70-150 kDa oligomers, whereas 300-500 kDa 
oligomers as well as 70-150 kDa oligomers accumulated in the presence of 
CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2. Taken together, these results suggest that p97 plays a 
protective role in neurodegenerative disorders by directly suppressing the 
protein aggregation as a molecular chaperone.
