Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the 
copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and 
p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with 
hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared 
in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. 
Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and 
cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, 
humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein 
of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken 
brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone 
encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments 
isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a 
full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino 
acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken 
and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the 
protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich 
carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise 
several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically 
immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be 
used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken 
oviduct cytosol.
