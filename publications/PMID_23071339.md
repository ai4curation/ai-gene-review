Ikaros is a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding protein that plays a pivotal role 
in immune homeostasis through transcriptional regulation of the earliest stages 
of lymphocyte ontogeny and differentiation. Functional deficiency of Ikaros has 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most 
common form of childhood cancer. Therefore, a stringent regulation of Ikaros 
activity is considered of paramount importance, but the operative molecular 
mechanisms responsible for its regulation remain largely unknown. Here we 
provide multifaceted genetic and biochemical evidence for a previously unknown 
function of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) as a partner and posttranslational 
regulator of Ikaros. We demonstrate that SYK phoshorylates Ikaros at unique 
C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites S358 and S361, thereby augmenting its 
nuclear localization and sequence-specific DNA binding activity. 
Mechanistically, we establish that SYK-induced Ikaros activation is essential 
for its nuclear localization and optimal transcription factor function.

Abstract

Ikaros is a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in immune homeostasis through transcriptional regulation of the earliest stages of lymphocyte ontogeny and differentiation. Functional deficiency of Ikaros has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer. Therefore, a stringent regulation of Ikaros activity is considered of paramount importance, but the operative molecular mechanisms responsible for its regulation remain largely unknown. Here we provide multifaceted genetic and biochemical evidence for a previously unknown function of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) as a partner and posttranslational regulator of Ikaros. We demonstrate that SYK phoshorylates Ikaros at unique C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites S358 and S361, thereby augmenting its nuclear localization and sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Mechanistically, we establish that SYK-induced Ikaros activation is essential for its nuclear localization and optimal transcription factor function.

Discussion

The SYK-phosphorylation sites S358 (S361 in human IK1) and S361 (S364 in human IK1) are outside the main DNA binding domain of IK containing the N-terminal ZFs 1–4. SYK-mediated phosphorylation of the IK protein may induce a conformational change that affects the accessibility and DNA binding affinity of the distant N-terminal ZFs or the more adjacent C-terminal ZFs. Our modeling studies indicate that SYK-induced phosphorylation of S361 and S364 would stabilize the local folded protein conformation of IK in this segment ( Fig. S3 ). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the C-terminal ZF domain may also affect the overall protein conformation of IK and the DNA binding affinity of its N-terminal ZF. Although high-affinity DNA interactions of IK have been generally attributed to its N-terminal ZF 1–3 ( 26 ), the C-terminal ZF domain has been shown to bind to the enhancer (δ-A element) of the CD3-δ gene in a sequence-specific manner ( 27 ). It has been proposed that the C-terminal ZF domain enables the IK5 isoform lacking three of the four N-terminal ZFs to engage in sequence-specific DNA binding ( 27 , 28 ). Therefore, augmentation of the DNA binding affinity and stability of the C-terminal ZF domain is likely to increase its contribution to the overall DNA binding affinity of IK. Like IK, other transcription factors, such as the Myc-associated ZF protein MAZ with six C 2 H 2 -type ZF motifs, show enhanced DNA binding activity when phosphorylated on a regulatory S-residue in their C-terminal domain ( 29 ).

The structural basis of SYK activation is not fully understood because of the lack of a 3D anatomic structure of full-length SYK in active conformation. Based on the anatomic structure of the related ZAP70 kinase, a model of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-based signaling has been proposed to explain BCR-mediated SYK activation ( 30 , 31 ). However, elevation of SYK enzymatic activity is induced by a variety of BCR-independent signals, including oxidative stress that cannot be explained by recruitment of SYK to ITAMs ( 32 , 33 ). Furthermore, the X-ray structure of unphosphorylated kinase catalytic domain of SYK showed that the enzyme adopts a conformation of the activation loop typically seen only in activated Y-phosphorylated Y-kinases ( 34 ). In addition, single-particle electron microscopy studies suggested that the regulation of the activation of SYK might be modulated by subtle or minor changes in the positioning of the regulatory domains (SH2-SH2 region) rather than full opening mechanisms proposed for Src kinases ( 35 ). It has also been shown that numerous signaling events such as phosphorylation by Src-family kinases, autophosphorylation, and substrate-binding to the SH2 domains can equally activate SYK ( 36 ). The CD19 receptor plays a critical role in initiation of SYK-dependent signaling events in both immature and mature B-lineage lymphoid cells ( 37 – 39 ) ( SI Text ). The present study demonstrates that activation of SYK after CD19 receptor engagement in a BCR-negative human pro–B-cell line is associated with increased S-phosphorylation of native IK, and SYK is directly responsible for this BCR-independent S-phosphorylation of native IK after CD19-receptor engagement. Hence, there are a multitude of signals that contribute to sustained baseline SYK activity in cells and this activity appears to be important for the optimal transcription factor function of IK. Whether or not the kinase-ligand interactions between SYK and IK can cause conformational changes reshaping the active site of SYK via the fairly common process of “induced fit” ( 40 ), and thereby further promote SYK-induced S-phosphorylation of IK, will require a 3D structure determination of full-length SYK in a complex with IK using X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. Similarly, the elucidation of the structural basis of IK activation by SYK-induced S-phosphorylation will require a 3D structure determination of IK at atomic resolution before and after phosphorylation.

Standard Biochemical, Imaging, and Transfection Methods.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy, coimmunoprecipitations, Western blot analyses, and EMSA were performed as per previously described standard procedures ( SI Text ). RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression levels of IK target genes.
