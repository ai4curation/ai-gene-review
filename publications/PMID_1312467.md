Cyclins play a fundamental role in regulating cell cycle events in all 
eukaryotic cells. The human cyclin A gene was identified as the site of 
integration of hepatitis B virus in a hepatocarcinoma cell line; in addition, 
cyclin A is associated with the E2F transcription factor in a complex which is 
dissociated by the E1A oncogene product. Such findings suggest that cyclin A is 
a target for oncogenic signals. We have now found that DNA synthesis and entry 
into mitosis are inhibited in human cells microinjected with anti-cyclin A 
antibodies at distinct times. Cyclin A binds both cdk2 and cdc2, giving two 
distinct cyclin A kinase activities, one appearing in S phase, the other in G2. 
These results suggest that cyclin A defines novel control points of the human 
cell cycle.
