Using specific anti-BiP/Kar2 antibody as the probe, we have developed an 
efficient purification method of BiP/Kar2 protein from the total cell extract of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overproduction of BiP/Kar2 protein was achieved by the 
cloning of the KAR2 gene on multicopy plasmids and the treatment of cells 
harboring the cloned KAR2 gene with tunicamycin. Freeze-thaw treatment, 
hydroxyapatite high pressure liquid chromatography, and ATP-agarose column 
chromatography of crude extract yielded homogeneous BiP/Kar2 protein (including 
less than 0.2% of degradative derivative) with a 430-fold purification and 28% 
recovery. Edman degradation of purified BiP/Kar2 suggests that the mature 
protein corresponds to a processed product with the removal of a 42-amino acid 
presequence. It is active as a homodimer and exhibits ATPase activity with a 
specific activity of 2 pmol/min/micrograms of protein. Protease susceptibility 
indicated that the ADP form of BiP/Kar2 is more resistant than the ATP form to 
the chymotrypsin digestion and that BiP/Kar2 required the presence of ATP to 
avoid the irreversible denaturation. Synthesis of BiP/Kar2 was induced by the 
inducible expression of an aberrant heterologous protein, yeast killer 
prepro-signal mouse alpha-amylase fusion protein.
