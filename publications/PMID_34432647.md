Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a pivotal role in the regulation of cell 
invasion. Placental trophoblast cell invasion is a precisely regulated event. 
Dysregulation of MMPs has been linked to various placental diseases. Growth 
differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), also known as myostatin, is a member of the 
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. GDF-8 and its putative 
receptors are expressed in human extravillous cytotrophoblast cells (EVTs). 
Although the pro-invasive effect of GDF-8 in human EVT cells has been recently 
reported, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. In this 
study, we investigate the effects of GDF-8 on the expression of the two most 
important MMPs, MMP2 and MMP9, in the HTR-8/SVneo human EVT cell line. Our 
results show that GDF-8 significantly upregulates the expression of MMP2. The 
expression of MMP9 is not affected by GDF-8. Using a siRNA-mediated knockdown 
approach, we reveal that the stimulatory effect of GDF-8 on MMP2 expression is 
mediated by the ALK5-SMAD2/3 signaling pathway. Additionally, the knockdown of 
MMP2 attenuates the GDF-8-induced cell invasiveness. These findings deepen our 
understanding of the biological roles of GDF-8 in the regulation of human 
trophoblast cell invasion.
