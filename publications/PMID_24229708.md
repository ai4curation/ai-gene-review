Targeted inactivation of Runx3 in mouse lung induced mucinous and nonmucinous 
adenomas and markedly shortened latency of adenocarcinoma formation induced by 
oncogenic K-Ras. RUNX3 was frequently inactivated in K-RAS mutated human lung 
adenocarcinomas. A functional genetic screen of a fly mutant library and 
molecular analysis in cultured cell lines revealed that Runx3 forms a complex 
with BRD2 in a K-Ras-dependent manner in the early phase of the cell cycle; this 
complex induces expression of p14(ARF)/p19(Arf) and p21(WAF/CIP). When K-Ras was 
constitutively activated, the Runx3-BRD2 complex was stably maintained and 
expression of both p14(ARF) and p21(WAF/CIP) was prolonged. These results 
provide a missing link between oncogenic K-Ras and the p14(ARF)-p53 pathway, and 
may explain how cells defend against oncogenic K-Ras.
