The Ire1p transmembrane receptor kinase/endonuclease transduces the unfolded 
protein response (UPR) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the nucleus in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we analyzed the capacity of a highly 
basic sequence in the linker region of Ire1p to function as a nuclear 
localization sequence (NLS) both in vivo and in vitro. This 18-residue sequence 
is capable of targeting green fluorescent protein to the nucleus of yeast cells 
in a process requiring proteins involved in the Ran GTPase cycle that 
facilitates nuclear import. Mutagenic analysis and importin binding studies 
demonstrate that the Ire1p linker region contains overlapping potential NLSs: at 
least one classical NLS (within sequences 642KKKRKR647 and/or 653KKGR656) that 
is recognized by yeast importin alpha (Kap60p) and a novel betaNLS 
(646KRGSRGGKKGRK657) that is recognized by several yeast importin beta 
homologues. Kinetic binding data suggest that binding to importin beta proteins 
would predominate in vivo. The UPR, and in particular ER stress-induced HAC1 
mRNA splicing, is inhibited by point mutations in the Ire1p NLS that inhibit 
nuclear localization and also requires functional RanGAP and Ran GEF proteins. 
The NLS-dependent nuclear localization of Ire1p would thus seem to be central to 
its role in UPR signaling.
