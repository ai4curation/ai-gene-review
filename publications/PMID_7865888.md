The cloning of a cDNA encoding a new member of the highly conserved mammalian 
70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp 70) family termed PBP74 was recently reported. 
Critical to an understanding of the function of this new hsp 70 is delineating 
its subcellular localization. Here we use a variety of immunological and 
biochemical approaches both in vitro and in vivo to demonstrate that PBP74 is 
imported into and resides in mitochondria. By confocal immunofluorescence 
microscopy PBP74 is detected in mitochondria, colocalizing with the 
mitochondrial 60-kDa heat shock protein. To address the inherent problem of 
serological cross-reactivity among the hsp70 family members, an influenza virus 
hemagglutinin epitope tag was introduced into the PBP74 cDNA. The epitope-tagged 
PBP74 protein transiently expressed in L cells localized to mitochondria. 
Moreover, deletion of the N-terminal 46-amino acid presequence results in a 
cytosolic localization of the epitope-tagged protein. Cell fractionation studies 
demonstrated PBP74 in purified mitochondria in a protease-protected location. 
After coupled transcription-translation the precursor of PBP74 is imported into 
isolated yeast mitochondria, where it becomes processed to the mature protein. 
According to a subfractionation of the mitochondria, the imported protein was 
found to be localized in the matrix space. Import in vitro is time- and 
temperature-dependent, requires matrix ATP, and is abolished upon depletion of 
the membrane potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Similarly, in 
mammalian cells PBP74 is synthesized as a pre-protein that requires membrane 
potential-dependent import into mitochondria for its maturation. Taken together, 
our data demonstrate that PBP74 is a mammalian mitochondrial hsp70.
