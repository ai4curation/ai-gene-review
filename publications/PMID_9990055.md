The signal sequence trap method was used to isolate cDNAs corresponding to 
proteins containing secretory leader peptides and whose genes are expressed 
specifically in the salivary glands of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. 
Fifteen unique cDNA fragments, ranging in size from 150 to 550 bp, were isolated 
and sequenced in a first round of immunoscreening in COS-7 cells. All but one of 
the cDNAs contained putative signal sequences at their 5' ends, suggesting that 
they were likely to encode secreted or transmembrane proteins. Expression 
analysis by reverse transcription-PCR showed that at least six cDNA fragments 
were expressed specifically in the salivary glands. Fragments showing a high 
degree of similarity to D7 and apyrase, two salivary gland-specific genes 
previously found in Aedes aegypti, were identified. Of interest, three different 
D7-related cDNAs that are likely to represent a new gene family were found in 
An. gambiae. Moreover, three salivary gland-specific cDNA fragments that do not 
show similarity to known proteins in the databases were identified, and the 
corresponding full length cDNAs were cloned and sequenced. RNA in situ 
hybridization to whole female salivary glands showed patterns of expression that 
overlap only in part those observed in the culicine mosquito A. aegypti.
