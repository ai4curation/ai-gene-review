The beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is expressed within the nervous system, 
even at the earliest stages of embryonic development when cell growth and 
proliferation is particularly important. In order to study the function of APP 
at these early developmental stages, we have studied the development of the 
cerebral cortex in both wild type and App-/- mutant mice. Here, we demonstrate 
that APP mRNA is expressed in cortical precursor cells and that APP protein is 
concentrated within their apical domains during interphase. However, during 
mitosis, APP re-localizes to the peripheral space surrounding the metaphase 
plate. In APP-deficient cortical precursors, the duration of mitosis is 
increased and a higher proportion of cortical precursor cells contained nuclei 
in late G2. We conclude that during cortical development APP plays a role in 
controlling cell cycle progression, particularly affecting G2 and mitosis. These 
observations may have important implications for our understanding of how APP 
influences the progression of Alzheimer's disease, since degenerating cortical 
neurons have been shown to up-regulate cell cycle markers and re-enter the 
mitotic cycle before dying.
