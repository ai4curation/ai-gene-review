Abstract

Members of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family of proteins are thought to regulate gene expression. Among mammalian CHD proteins, CHD8 was originally isolated as a negative regulator of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway that binds directly to β-catenin and suppresses its transactivation activity. The mechanism by which CHD8 inhibits β-catenin-dependent transcription has been unclear, however. Here we show that CHD8 promotes the association of β-catenin and histone H1, with formation of the trimeric complex on chromatin being required for inhibition of β-catenin-dependent transactivation. A CHD8 mutant that lacks the histone H1 binding domain did not show such inhibitory activity, indicating that histone H1 recruitment is essential for the inhibitory effect of CHD8. Furthermore, either depletion of histone H1 or expression of a dominant negative mutant of this protein resulted in enhancement of the response to Wnt signaling. These observations reveal a new mode of regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by CHD8, which counteracts β-catenin function through recruitment of histone H1 to Wnt target genes. Given that CHD8 is expressed predominantly during embryogenesis, it may thus contribute to setting a threshold for responsiveness to Wnt signaling that operates in a development-dependent manner.

INTRODUCTION

The Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway plays key roles in development, specification of cell fate, and adult stem cell proliferation ( 2 , 21 , 27 , 44 ). Abnormal activation of this pathway is associated with various human cancers, including colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Many genes associated with tumor growth, including those for c-Myc, matrix metalloproteinases, and cyclin D1, have been identified as Wnt target genes, with β-catenin functioning as a transcriptional coactivator at such genes ( 11 , 16 , 22 , 35 ). In the absence of β-catenin binding, the promoters of Wnt target genes are occupied by Tcf/Lef family proteins, the corepressor Groucho (also known as TLE1), and histone deacetylase 1 ( 3 , 5 , 9 , 34 ). Wnt signaling results in the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol and nucleus, and nuclear β-catenin displaces Groucho from Tcf by binding Tcf at the promoters of Wnt target genes. β-Catenin then recruits chromatin-remodeling complexes or other transcriptional coactivators to stimulate gene transcription ( 2 , 12 , 21 , 27 , 43 , 44 ). Several members of the Snf2 superfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes, including BRG1 ( 1 ), Snf2H, and p400 ( 39 ), were recently found to be recruited by β-catenin in the induction of target gene transcription. Although these findings suggest that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling plays a fundamental role in the regulation of β-catenin-dependent transcription, it remains unclear how such enzymes contribute to the regulation of chromatin at Wnt target genes.

Members of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family of proteins also belong to the Snf2 superfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. Among the nine mammalian members of this family, CHD1 is thought to play an important role in gene transcription. The tandem chromodomains of human CHD1 thus specifically recognize and bind to the trimethylated form of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3), a hallmark of actively transcribed chromatin ( 7 ), and mediate the recruitment of transcriptional initiation and pre-mRNA splicing factors ( 40 ). In mammals, CHD3 and CHD4 are subunits of nucleosome-remodeling and histone deacetylase (NURD) complexes, which contain histone deacetylases and function as transcriptional repressors ( 47 ). Mutations in CHD7 result in CHARGE syndrome, a multiple-malformation syndrome in humans for which more than 40 alleles have been defined ( 42 ). Chd7 +/− mice recapitulate several aspects of this human disease, including inner-ear vestibular dysfunction ( 13 ). Molecular studies suggest that CHD7 contributes to transcriptional activation of tissue-specific genes during differentiation ( 38 ). However, most of the biological functions mediated by members of the CHD family remain to be elucidated.

CHD8 exists in two isoforms, short (CHD8 S ) and long (CHD8 L ), that are generated as a result of alternative mRNA splicing. CHD8 S (also known as duplin) was originally isolated as a negative regulator of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway ( 36 ) and binds directly to the Armadillo repeats of β-catenin ( 36 , 41 ). The COOH-terminal region of full-length CHD8 (CHD8 L ) interacts with the insulator-binding protein CTCF, with this interaction being important for insulator activity ( 14 ). CHD8 has also been implicated as a positive or negative transcriptional regulator of various genes ( 19 , 32 , 33 , 45 , 46 ). We previously showed that Chd8 −/− mice die early during embryogenesis, manifesting widespread apoptosis ( 28 ), whereas additional deletion of the tumor suppressor gene p53 ameliorated this developmental arrest ( 29 ). Both isoforms of CHD8 bind to p53 and suppress its transactivation activity by recruiting histone H1, with formation of a p53-CHD8-histone H1 trimeric complex on chromatin being required for inhibition of p53-dependent transactivation and apoptosis. These observations led us to examine whether such histone H1 recruitment by CHD8 might also contribute to the regulation of other genes such as Wnt target genes. We now show that CHD8 mediates the recruitment of histone H1 to Wnt target genes, resulting in suppression of the expression of these genes induced by activation of Wnt–β-catenin signaling. Our results thus suggest that CHD8 may target multiple transcriptional activators, including β-catenin and p53, for suppression of transcriptional activity through recruitment of histone H1.

DISCUSSION

With the use of biochemical and genetic approaches, we have shown that CHD8 negatively regulates β-catenin function by recruiting histone H1 to the promoters of Wnt target genes. Formation of the β-catenin–CHD8–histone H1 complex requires two conditions: expression of CHD8 and stabilization of β-catenin by activation of Wnt signaling. CHD8 is preferentially expressed in embryonic tissues and in cancer cell lines, which are thought to reflect the embryonic state.

CHD8 S , also known as duplin, was originally isolated as a negative regulator of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway ( 36 ). Recent studies have indicated that CHD8 L interacts directly with β-catenin and negatively regulates β-catenin-dependent gene expression through the ATP-dependent modulation of chromatin structure ( 41 ). On the other hand, the COOH-terminal region of CHD8 L interacts with the insulator-binding protein CTCF, with this interaction being important for insulator activity ( 14 ). However, our present study suggests that not only CHD8 L but also CHD8 S is able to inhibit Wnt- and β-catenin-dependent transactivation. Given that CHD8 S contains the chromodomain but lacks the Snf2 helicase domain and the CTCF binding domain of CHD8 L , neither the ATP-dependent remodeling activity mediated by the Snf2 helicase domain nor CTCF binding through the COOH-terminal region of CHD8 L is necessary for this suppressive effect of CHD8 on the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. In contrast, this suppressive activity requires the region present in both CHD8 S and CHD8 L that mediates binding to histone H1. A CHD8 S mutant that lacks the histone H1 binding domain thus did not exhibit this inhibitory activity, and either depletion of histone H1 or expression of a dominant negative mutant thereof increased the cellular sensitivity to Wnt signaling. Our results thus indicate that histone H1 recruitment mediated by CHD8 is fundamental to negative regulation of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway.

Histone H1 molecules are highly mobile, and the interaction of a specific H1 molecule with a specific nucleosome is transient ( 18 , 20 ), suggesting that the molecules are continuously exchanged among chromatin binding sites according to a “stop-and-go” process in which a histone H1 molecule remains at a binding site for a limited time before dissociating and moving rapidly to another such site. Most chromatin fibers thus likely always contain histone H1, but there is a continuous turnover of histone H1 molecules at the level of the individual nucleosome. Given that histone H1 is implicated in regulation of the expression of specific genes, we postulated the existence of a factor such as CHD8 that extends the residence time of histone H1 at the corresponding specific chromatin sites. It is also possible that CHD8 alters the interaction of histone H1 with linker DNA and represses transcription by enhancing the intrinsic stability of nucleosomes. The detailed mechanisms of transcriptional suppression for specific genes remain to be elucidated.

The identification of various proteins that associate with β-catenin has provided insight into its function as a transcriptional regulator. Many of these proteins, including components of histone acetylation and methylation complexes as well as chromatin-binding proteins, contribute to regulation of chromatin structure or of RNA polymerase II. Several transcriptional complexes or coactivators, including Bcl-9 (also known as Lgs), Pygopus (Pygo), polymerase-associated factor 1 (Paf1), and SET1 (trithorax), have been found to be recruited by β-catenin for target gene regulation ( 17 , 24 , 39 ). At active target genes, Pygo binds through its PHD finger to methylated H3K4 and, by using Bcl-9 as an adaptor, retains β-catenin near Wnt-responsive elements independently of Tcf ( 37 ). Pygo-dependent binding of β-catenin to methylated histones frees Tcf to recruit its corepressors, such as Groucho, that counteract the activating β-catenin-induced chromatin-remodeling processes. We have now uncovered another mode of β-catenin regulation mediated by the CHD8-dependent recruitment of histone H1 to the promoters of Wnt target genes.

We previously showed that apoptosis mediated by p53-dependent transactivation is also suppressed by histone H1 recruited by CHD8 ( 29 ). Loss of CHD8 induced hyperactivation of p53, resulting in apoptosis, which was prevented by the additional depletion of p53. Mice deficient in CHD8 die during early embryogenesis (around embryonic day 7.5) as a result of aberrant apoptosis induced by the unscheduled activation of p53 ( 28 , 29 ). It is likely that such apoptosis dominates and masks possible phenotypes induced by hyperactivation of Wnt signaling. Additional deletion of p53 in CHD8-deficient mice ameliorated the developmental arrest, resulting in extension of survival until embryonic day 10.5. Death of the Chd8 −/− p53 −/− mice is associated with severe hemorrhage, probably as a result of a defect in cardiovascular development (M. Nishiyama and K. I. Nakayama, unpublished observations). Given that mice homozygous for a mutant Apc allele encoding a product truncated at position 716 ( Apc Δ 716 ) die in utero as a result of the unscheduled activation of Wnt signaling ( 30 ) and that Wnt signaling plays an essential role in cardiovascular development during embryogenesis ( 4 ), the embryonic death of Chd8 −/− p53 −/− mice may be attributable to a defect in the cardiovascular system resulting from unscheduled activation of Wnt signaling.

The mode of action of CHD8 in antagonism of Wnt–β-catenin signaling appears almost identical to that for p53 inhibition. The histone H1 binding domain that is present in both CHD8 S and CHD8 L is thus indispensable for CHD8-mediated inhibition of transactivation by p53 or β-catenin. Furthermore, genetic evidence from cells depleted of histone H1 also supports this similarity. Given that CHD8 is preferentially expressed in embryonic tissues and in cancer cell lines, which are thought to reflect the embryonic state, CHD8 may counteract p53 and Wnt–β-catenin function through recruitment of histone H1 during early embryogenesis to set a threshold for induction of apoptosis, cell proliferation, and axis formation. It is also possible that CHD8 may bind to transcriptional factors other than p53 and β-catenin and act as a more general inhibitor of transactivation activity through recruitment of histone H1.
