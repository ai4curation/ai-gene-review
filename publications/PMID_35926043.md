Kynurenic acid (KynA) is tissue protective in cardiac, cerebral, renal, and 
retinal ischemia models, but the mechanism is unknown. KynA can bind to multiple 
receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, the a7 nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor (a7nAChR), multiple ionotropic glutamate receptors, and 
the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35. Here, we show that GPR35 activation 
was necessary and sufficient for ischemic protection by KynA. When bound by 
KynA, GPR35 activated Gi- and G12/13-coupled signaling and trafficked to the 
outer mitochondria membrane, where it bound, apparantly indirectly, to ATP 
synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 (ATPIF1). Activated GPR35, in an 
ATPIF1-dependent and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, induced ATP synthase 
dimerization, which prevented ATP loss upon ischemia. These findings provide a 
rationale for the development of specific GPR35 agonists for the treatment of 
ischemic diseases.
