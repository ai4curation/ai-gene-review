The transient inactivation of protein phosphatases contributes to the efficiency 
and temporal control of kinase-dependent signal transduction. In particular, 
members of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family are known to undergo 
reversible oxidation of their active site cysteine. The thiol oxidation step 
requires activation of colocalized NADPH oxidases and is mediated by locally 
produced reactive oxygen species, in particular H2 O2 . How oxidized 
phosphatases are returned to the reduced active state is less well studied. Both 
major thiol reductive systems, the thioredoxin and the glutathione systems, have 
been implicated in the reactivation of phosphatases. Here, we show that the 
protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B and the dual-specificity phosphatase PTEN are 
preferentially reactivated by the thioredoxin system. We show that inducible 
depletion of thioredoxin 1(TRX1) slows PTEN reactivation in intact living cells. 
Finally, using a mechanism-based trapping approach, we demonstrate direct thiol 
disulphide exchange between the active sites of thioredoxin and either 
phosphatase. The application of thioredoxin trapping mutants represents a 
complementary approach to direct assays of PTP oxidation in elucidating the 
significance of redox regulation of PTP function in the control of cell 
signaling.
