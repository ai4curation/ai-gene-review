The LKB1 tumour suppressor kinase phosphorylates and activates a number of 
protein kinases belonging to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) subfamily. 
We have used a modified tandem affinity purification strategy to identify 
proteins that interact with AMPKalpha, as well as the twelve AMPK-related 
kinases that are activated by LKB1. The AMPKbeta and AMPKgamma regulatory 
subunits were associated with AMPKalpha, but not with any of the AMPK-related 
kinases, explaining why AMP does not influence the activity of these enzymes. In 
addition, we identified novel binding partners that interacted with one or more 
of the AMPK subfamily enzymes, including fat facets/ubiquitin specific 
protease-9 (USP9), AAA-ATPase-p97, adenine nucleotide translocase, protein 
phosphatase 2A holoenzyme and isoforms of the phospho-protein binding adaptor 
14-3-3. Interestingly, the 14-3-3 isoforms bound directly to the T-loop Thr 
residue of QSK and SIK, after these were phosphorylated by LKB1. Consistent with 
this, the 14-3-3 isoforms failed to interact with non-phosphorylated QSK and 
SIK, in LKB1 knockout muscle or in HeLa cells in which LKB1 is not expressed. 
Moreover, mutation of the T-loop Thr phosphorylated by LKB1, prevented QSK and 
SIK from interacting with 14-3-3 in vitro. Binding of 14-3-3 to QSK and SIK, 
enhanced catalytic activity towards the TORC2 protein and the AMARA peptide, and 
was required for the cytoplasmic localization of SIK and for localization of QSK 
to punctate structures within the cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this study 
provides the first example of 14-3-3 binding directly to the T-loop of a protein 
kinase and influencing its catalytic activity and cellular localization.
