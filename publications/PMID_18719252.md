Current yeast interactome network maps contain several hundred molecular 
complexes with limited and somewhat controversial representation of direct 
binary interactions. We carried out a comparative quality assessment of current 
yeast interactome data sets, demonstrating that high-throughput yeast two-hybrid 
(Y2H) screening provides high-quality binary interaction information. Because a 
large fraction of the yeast binary interactome remains to be mapped, we 
developed an empirically controlled mapping framework to produce a 
"second-generation" high-quality, high-throughput Y2H data set covering 
approximately 20% of all yeast binary interactions. Both Y2H and affinity 
purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) data are of equally high 
quality but of a fundamentally different and complementary nature, resulting in 
networks with different topological and biological properties. Compared to 
co-complex interactome models, this binary map is enriched for transient 
signaling interactions and intercomplex connections with a highly significant 
clustering between essential proteins. Rather than correlating with 
essentiality, protein connectivity correlates with genetic pleiotropy.

Abstract

Current yeast interactome network maps contain several hundred molecular complexes with limited and somewhat controversial representation of direct binary interactions. We carried out a comparative quality assessment of current yeast interactome datasets, demonstrating that high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) provides high-quality binary interaction information. As a large fraction of the yeast binary interactome remains to be mapped, we developed an empirically-controlled mapping framework to produce a “second-generation” high-quality high-throughput Y2H dataset covering ~20% of all yeast binary interactions. Both Y2H and affinity-purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) data are of equally high quality but of a fundamentally different and complementary nature resulting in networks with different topological and biological properties. Compared to co-complex interactome models, this binary map is enriched for transient signaling interactions and inter-complex connections with a highly significant clustering between essential proteins. Rather than correlating with essentiality, protein connectivity correlates with genetic pleiotropy.
