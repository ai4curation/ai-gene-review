We have previously shown that the breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, can 
transcriptionally activate the p27(Kip1) promoter. The BRCA1-responsive element 
was defined as a 35 bp region from position -545 to -511. We next determined 
that within this region is also a potential binding site for the transcription 
factor Forkhead box (FOX)A1. RNA and protein analysis as well as 
immunohistochemistry showed that expression of FOXA1 correlated with the 
expression of the estrogen receptor in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and 
tissues. In transient transfection reporter assays, FOXA1 could activate the 
p27(Kip1) promoter. Cotransfection of BRCA1 and FOXA1 resulted in a synergistic 
activation of the p27(Kip1) promoter. Mutation of the FOXA1 DNA-binding site in 
the p27(Kip1) promoter-luciferase construct significantly diminished the 
activity of FOXA1 alone or in combination with BRCA1. Cotransfection of FOXA1 
and BRCA1 resulted in a greater amount of each protein compared to transfection 
of each expression vector alone. The half-life of FOXA1 was increased when 
coexpressed with BRCA1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis 
demonstrated that FOXA1 could bind to a wild-type oligonucleotide containing the 
FOXA1 binding site in the p27(Kip1) promoter, but this binding was lost upon 
mutation of this FOXA1 binding site. The protein-DNA binding complex could be 
supershifted with an antibody directed against FOXA1. The activity of the 
p27(Kip1) promoter as well as FOXA1 expression was reduced in cells treated with 
BRCA1 siRNA, thus silencing the expression of BRCA1 protein. In summary, we 
identified a FOXA1 binding site within the BRCA1-responsive element of the 
p27(Kip1) promoter and showed that FOXA1 activated the promoter alone and in 
conjunction with BRCA1. Furthermore, we identified high expression of FOXA1 in 
breast cancer cell lines and tissues, discovered a role for BRCA1 in the 
regulation of p27(Kip1) transcription and a possible interaction with BRCA1.
