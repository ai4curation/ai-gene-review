Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx4) is a moonlighting 
selenoprotein, which has been implicated in anti-oxidative defense, sperm 
development, and cerebral embryogenesis. Among GPx-isoforms, GPx4 is unique 
because of its capability to reduce complex lipid hydroperoxides and its 
tendency toward polymerization, but the structural basis for these properties 
remained unclear. To address this, we solved the crystal structure of the 
catalytically active U46C mutant of human GPx4 to 1.55 A resolution. X-ray data 
indicated a monomeric protein consisting of four alpha-helices and seven 
beta-strands. GPx4 lacks a surface exposed loop domain, which appears to limit 
the accessibility of the active site of other GPx-isoforms, and these data may 
explain the broad substrate specificity of GPx4. The catalytic triad (C46, Q81, 
and W136) is localized at a flat impression of the protein surface extending 
into a surface exposed patch of basic amino acids (K48, K135, and R152) that 
also contains polar T139. Multiple mutations of the catalytic triad indicated 
its functional importance. Like the wild-type enzyme, the U46C mutant exhibits a 
strong tendency toward protein polymerization, which was prevented by 
reductants. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested involvement of the catalytic C46 
and surface exposed C10 and C66 in polymer formation. In GPx4 crystals, these 
residues contact adjacent protein monomers.
