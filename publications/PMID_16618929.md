A challenging task in the study of the secretory pathway is the identification 
and localization of new proteins to increase our understanding of the functions 
of different organelles. Previous proteomic studies of the endomembrane system 
have been hindered by contaminating proteins, making it impossible to assign 
proteins to organelles. Here we have used the localization of organelle proteins 
by the isotope tagging technique in conjunction with isotope tags for relative 
and absolute quantitation and 2D liquid chromatography for the simultaneous 
assignment of proteins to multiple subcellular compartments. With this approach, 
the density gradient distributions of 689 proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana 
were determined, enabling confident and simultaneous localization of 527 
proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuolar membrane, 
plasma membrane, or mitochondria and plastids. This parallel analysis of 
endomembrane components has enabled protein steady-state distributions to be 
determined. Consequently, genuine organelle residents have been distinguished 
from contaminating proteins and proteins in transit through the secretory 
pathway.

Abstract

A challenging task in the study of the secretory pathway is the identification and localization of new proteins to increase our understanding of the functions of different organelles. Previous proteomic studies of the endomembrane system have been hindered by contaminating proteins, making it impossible to assign proteins to organelles. Here we have used the localization of organelle proteins by the isotope tagging technique in conjunction with isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation and 2D liquid chromatography for the simultaneous assignment of proteins to multiple subcellular compartments. With this approach, the density gradient distributions of 689 proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana were determined, enabling confident and simultaneous localization of 527 proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuolar membrane, plasma membrane, or mitochondria and plastids. This parallel analysis of endomembrane components has enabled protein steady-state distributions to be determined. Consequently, genuine organelle residents have been distinguished from contaminating proteins and proteins in transit through the secretory pathway.

Discussion

Development of the LOPIT technique by using iTRAQ in conjunction with 2D liquid chromatography of peptides followed by tandem MS has resulted in the determination of density gradient distributions of 689 proteins, of which 60% were predicted to contain at least one transmembrane domain by using hmmtop 2.0 ( www.enzim.hu/hmmtop ). Based on these distributions, 527 proteins were assigned to the ER, Golgi apparatus, PM, vacuolar membrane, or mitochondria/plastid. Previous proteomic studies of the endomembrane system have been hindered by the presence of contaminating proteins, making it impossible to assign proteins to organelles. For example, proteomic analysis of a Golgi apparatus-enriched fraction derived from rat liver resulted in the identification of 421 proteins, of which >55% were contaminants ( 8 ). In contrast, LOPIT does not depend on the production of pure organelles. Consequently, this proteomic analysis shows that confident and parallel localization of proteins to the ER, PM, Golgi apparatus, or vacuolar membrane can be achieved. The remainder of this discussion will focus on the protein content revealed in these endomembrane organelles. Table 1 represents a summary of the number of proteins assigned to each organelle described.
