The pathways that distinguish transport of folded and misfolded cargo through 
the exocytic (secretory) pathway of eukaryotic cells remain unknown. Using 
proteomics to assess global cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) protein interactions (the CFTR interactome), we show that Hsp90 
cochaperones modulate Hsp90-dependent stability of CFTR protein folding in the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Cell-surface rescue of the most common disease 
variant that is restricted to the ER, DeltaF508, can be initiated by partial 
siRNA silencing of the Hsp90 cochaperone ATPase regulator Aha1. We propose that 
failure of DeltaF508 to achieve an energetically favorable fold in response to 
the steady-state dynamics of the chaperone folding environment (the "chaperome") 
is responsible for the pathophysiology of CF. The activity of cargo-associated 
chaperome components may be a common mechanism regulating folding for ER exit, 
providing a general framework for correction of misfolding disease.
