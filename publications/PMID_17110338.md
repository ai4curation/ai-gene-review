The pathways that distinguish transport of folded and misfolded cargo through 
the exocytic (secretory) pathway of eukaryotic cells remain unknown. Using 
proteomics to assess global cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) protein interactions (the CFTR interactome), we show that Hsp90 
cochaperones modulate Hsp90-dependent stability of CFTR protein folding in the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Cell-surface rescue of the most common disease 
variant that is restricted to the ER, DeltaF508, can be initiated by partial 
siRNA silencing of the Hsp90 cochaperone ATPase regulator Aha1. We propose that 
failure of DeltaF508 to achieve an energetically favorable fold in response to 
the steady-state dynamics of the chaperone folding environment (the "chaperome") 
is responsible for the pathophysiology of CF. The activity of cargo-associated 
chaperome components may be a common mechanism regulating folding for ER exit, 
providing a general framework for correction of misfolding disease.

Abstract

Cystic Fibrosis, one of the most common inherited lethal disease among Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR protein acts as a gated Cl âˆ’ channel at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, thereby facilitating proper hydration of mucosal linings. Disease causing mutations in the CFTR protein can affect a variety of steps in the biogenesis of a functional protein including the folding and trafficking of CFTR as well as the channel activity of plasma membrane-localized protein. Therefore, current research is focused on the use of small molecules to not only correct folding defects but also to enhance channel activity of mutant CFTR proteins. This review discusses the current knowledge of the folding, trafficking, and gating defects caused by CFTR mutations, the manner by which these defects are monitored by the cell, as well as the strategies which are currently being utilized to develop and screen for small molecule therapeutics.
