The redox regulator NRF2 becomes activated upon oxidative and electrophilic 
stress and orchestrates a response program associated with redox regulation, 
metabolism, tumor therapy resistance, and immune suppression. Here, we describe 
an unrecognized link between the integrated stress response (ISR) and NRF2 
mediated by the ISR effector ATF4. The ISR is commonly activated after 
starvation or ER stress and plays a central role in tissue homeostasis and 
cancer plasticity. ATF4 increases NRF2 transcription and induces the 
glutathione-degrading enzyme CHAC1, which we now show to be critically important 
for maintaining NRF2 activation. In-depth analyses reveal that NRF2 supports 
ATF4-induced cells by increasing cystine uptake via the glutamate-cystine 
antiporter xCT. In addition, NRF2 upregulates genes mediating thioredoxin usage 
and regeneration, thus balancing the glutathione decrease. In conclusion, we 
demonstrate that the NRF2 response serves as second layer of the ISR, an 
observation highly relevant for the understanding of cellular resilience in 
health and disease.
