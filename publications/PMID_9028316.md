To investigate the role of bcl-2 in lymphohematopoiesis, a long-term bone marrow 
reconstitution system was established. Transplantation of 1,000 c-Kit+ Sca-1+ 
and lineage markers negative cells from bcl-2-l-mouse bone marrow resulted in 
long-term reconstitution of nonlymphoid cells. However, T cells were totally 
absent and B-lymphocyte development was severely impaired at a very early stage 
of differentiation in the chimeric mouse. On the other hand, transplantation of 
day 14 fetal liver cells from bcl-2-l-mice resulted in generation of both T and 
B cells in the recipient, albeit transiently. These data suggest that bcl-2 
plays a critical role in the development of lymphoid progenitor cells from the 
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), but is not essential for the development of 
nonlymphoid cells and the self-renewal of HSC. In addition, lymphopoiesis from 
fetal liver HSC appears to be less dependent on bcl-2 than adult bone marrow 
HSC.
