Endothelin, a novel vasoactive peptide derived from endothelial cells 
(Yanagisawa, M., Kurihara, H., Kimura, S., Tomobe, Y., Kobayashi, M., Mitsui, 
Y., Yazaki, Y., Goto, K., and Masaki, T. (1988) Nature 332, 411-415), acts as a 
potent mitogen in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. The effect is dose-dependent with a 
half-maximal effect obtained at approximately 3 x 10(-11) M and is 
synergistically enhanced by a low concentration of insulin-like growth factor-I. 
Endothelin specifically binds to a single class of high affinity receptors in 
intact Swiss 3T3 cells and stimulates phospholipase C with the production of 
second messengers inositol trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, leading to 
biphasic increases in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, as measured 
with a fluorescent indicator fura-2, phosphorylation of a putative cellular 
substrate of 80 kDa for protein kinase C, and transient expression of cellular 
protoonocogenes, c-fos and c-myc. Mitogenic effect of endothelin is markedly 
attenuated in phorbol ester-pretreated, protein kinase C-depleted cells. 
Endothelin-induced inositol phosphates production is not affected by removal of 
extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that endothelin-induced phospholipase C 
activation is not the result of stimulation of Ca2+ influx across the plasma 
membrane. These composite results indicate that the inositol lipid signaling 
pathway plays an important role in endothelin-induced mitogenesis in Swiss 3T3 
fibroblasts. The mitogenic effect of endothelin is considerably smaller than 
that of bombesin, another well characterized mitogen acting through the inositol 
lipid pathway, despite comparable potencies in eliciting initial second 
messenger signals. In endothelin-treated cells, an increase in cellular 
1,2-diacylglycerol content is transient, and cellular cyclic AMP content is 
reduced. By contrast, bombesin induces a more prolonged increase in cellular 
1,2-diacylglycerol content and a slight increase in cellular cyclic AMP content. 
Because both 1,2-diacylglycerol and cyclic AMP are thought to serve as signals 
for promoting DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, these differences in the 
signal generation may contribute to the differences in potencies between the two 
mitogens.
