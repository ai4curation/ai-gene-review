into EBOV entry, the role of several inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis 
in blocking infection mediated by HIV pseudotyped with the EBOV envelope

pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein (VSVg) were used as 
controls to assess cell viability after inhibiting clathrin pathway. Inhibition 
of clathrin pathway using dominant-negative Eps15, siRNA-mediated knockdown of 
clathrin heavy chain, chlorpromazine and sucrose blocked EbGP pseudotyped HIV 
infection. Also, both chlorpromazine and Bafilomycin A1 inhibited entry of 
infectious EBOV. Sensitivity of EbGP pseudotyped HIV as well as infectious EBOV 
to inhibitors of clathrin suggests that EBOV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis

novel therapeutic modalities could be designed based on this lead compound.

Abstract

Ebola virus (EBOV) infects several cell types and while viral entry is known to be pH dependent; the exact entry pathway(s) remains unknown. To gain insights into EBOV entry, the role of several inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in blocking infection mediated by HIV pseudotyped with the EBOV envelope glycoprotein (EbGP) was examined. Wild type HIV and envelope-minus HIV pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein (VSVg) were used as controls to assess cell viability after inhibiting clathrin pathway. Inhibition of clathrin pathway using dominant-negative Eps15; siRNA-mediated knockdown of clathrin heavy chain; chlorpromazine and sucrose blocked EbGP pseudotyped HIV infection. Also, both chlorpromazine and Bafilomycin A1 inhibited entry of infectious EBOV. Sensitivity of EbGP pseudotyped HIV as well as infectious EBOV to inhibitors of clathrin suggests that EBOV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis as an entry pathway. Furthermore, since chlorpromazine inhibits EBOV infection, novel therapeutic modalities could be designed based on this lead compound.

Introduction

Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe, fatal hemorrhagic fever with mortality rates as high as 90 % ( Feldmann et al., 2003 ). There is currently no effective anti-viral therapy available for EBOV infection. EBOV is an enveloped, negative-sense, single stranded RNA virus ( Regnery, Johnson, and Kiley, 1980 ) with a broad species and cell-type tropism ( Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998 ). The envelope glycoprotein (GP) is responsible for entry ( Elliott, Kiley, and McCormick, 1985 ). Very little is known about the pathway used by EBOV to enter target cells and its receptor(s) remains unidentified. It is known that EBOV entry in the context of pseudotypes is pH dependent ( Chazal et al., 2001 ). Depletion of membrane cholesterol by β–methyl cyclodextrin inhibits EBOV infection in a dose dependant manner ( Yonezawa, Cavrois, and Greene, 2005 ) and ( Bavari et al., 2002 ). There have been conflicting reports on the endocytic pathway(s) used by EBOV to enter target cells. One group suggested that Ebola enters cells via caveolar uptake ( Empig and Goldsmith, 2002 ) and uses the folate receptor alpha as a cofactor for EbGP mediated fusion ( Chan et al., 2001 ). Another study has suggested that EBOV uses clathrin as well as caveolae mediated endocytosis for entry using various chemical inhibitors of these pathways ( Sanchez, 2007 ). However, most of the inhibitors caused considerable cell detachment in this study and it was conducted only in Vero cells so cell type specific effects could not be ruled out. In contrast, two reports had previously shown that neither caveolae nor folate receptor alpha are required for EbGP fusion function ( Simmons et al., 2003 ) and ( Sinn et al., 2003 ). In light of these controversies more analysis is required.

The major endocytic pathways include clathrin-mediated endocytosis, uptake by caveolae, macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. Some non-clathrin ( Nemerow and Cooper, 1984 ), non-caveolae mediated viral endocytic pathways have also been reported ( Sanchez-San Martin et al., 2004 ) but they are not well described.

Among all the known pathways of viral endocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is predominant. Key proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis include clathrin, Adaptor Protein Complex-2 (AP-2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway substrate clone 15 (Eps15). Clathrin assembles into a polyhedral lattice on the inner side of the plasma membrane to form the coated pit. Eps15 acts as an adaptor between the clathrin coats and AP-2 ( Keen, 1987 ). An AP-2 independent pathway for clathrin-mediated endocytosis has also been reported ( Lakadamyali, Rust, and Zhuang, 2006 ). Eps15 comprises of three structural domains: an N-terminal region (DI) composed of three Eps15 homology regions, a central coiled-coil domain (DII) involved in oligomerization and a C-terminal region (DIII) which contains the AP-2 binding sites. DI is required for correct coated pit targeting of Eps15. It was shown that in cells expressing mutants lacking Eps15 homology domains, punctuate distribution of AP-2 and clathrin is lost and endocytosis of transferrin, which is a specific marker of clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( Hanover, Willingham, and Pastan, 1984 ) is inhibited ( Benmerah et al., 1999 ). Certain chemical agents such as chlorpromazine ( Wang, Rothberg, and Anderson, 1993 ) and sucrose ( Heuser and Anderson, 1989 ) are also known to prevent recycling of clathrin to the plasma membrane thereby inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

In this study we examined whether EBOV requires the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway for entry. Our results demonstrate that EbGP pseudotyped HIV as well as replication-competent EBOV use clathrin-mediated endocytosis as an entry pathway. We have also shown that chlorpromazine significantly inhibits replication-competent EBOV infection and hence is a potential lead candidate for development of anti-viral therapy against EBOV infection.

Discussion

In this study, we present two lines of investigation that reveal that EBOV utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway to infect cells. First, using envelope-minus HIV pseudotyped with EbGP, we find that viral infection is blocked by chemical and dominant-negative inhibitors of clathrin endocytic pathway. Likewise, siRNA-mediated knockdown of clathrin heavy chain also inhibited infection with EbGP pseudotyped HIV. Importantly, the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was specific because chlorpromazine, sucrose, dominant-negative Eps15 and siRNA-mediated knockdown of clathrin had no inhibitory effect on infection mediated by either VSVg or HIV envelope. This specificity demonstrated that the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was not cytotoxic. Secondly, chlorpromazine could potently inhibit infection with replication-competent EBOV. These studies validate the results obtained with the HIV pseudotype system and demonstrate that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is necessary for infection with the filamentous particles characteristic of the filovirus Ebola.

The potential role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis may seem surprising when considering the known small and spherical nature of clathrin coated pits. Typically, they are on the order of 120 nm ( Conner and Schmid, 2003 ). Ebola virus on the other hand has a diameter of 80 nm, but is filamentous in nature. It has previously been reported that maximal infectivity of EBOV is associated with filamentous particles 970 nm long and EBOV particles can reach up to 14 μm in length ( Kiley et al., 1982 ). However, a previous report reveals that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is not restricted to small spherical coated pits. Listeria has been shown to utilize clathrin-mediated endocytosis to enter cells ( Veiga and Cossart, 2005 ). The large size of the Listeria, which extends to 2 μm ( Giardini and Theriot, 2001 ), suggests that clathrin coated pits should be able to readily accommodate the filamentous particles of EBOV.

Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was previously shown to block wild type VSV infection ( Sun et al., 2005 ). So a surprising finding from our study is that infection mediated by VSVg pseudotyped HIV remained unaffected after disrupting the clathrin endocytic pathway using four different approaches. However, VSVg infection was inhibited by Baf A1, which agreed with the pH-dependence previously reported for VSVg pseudotyped viruses and wild type VSV ( Matlin et al., 1982 ). There could be several reasons why VSVg mediated entry was unaffected by inhibitors of the clathrin pathway in our study. Perhaps, there are differences in the context of wild type virus compared to the function of VSVg in the context of pseudotyped HIV. Alternatively, the use of certain entry pathways may be cell-type dependent. For example, in the case of influenza virus it has been shown that the virus can enter via several pathways including clathrin ( Rust et al., 2004 ), caveolae ( Nunes-Correia et al., 2004 ) and a clathrin and caveolae independent pathway ( Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002 ) and ( Rust et al., 2004 ). Likewise, similar results have been reported for adenovirus ( Varga, Weibull, and Everitt, 1991 ); ( Svensson, 1985 ); ( Yoshimura, 1985 ) and ( Meier et al., 2002 ). Therefore, past data and findings from this study put together suggests that like influenza virus, VSV could perhaps use multiple endocytic pathways for entry.

Like influenza virus and adenovirus, it is also possible that EBOV could utilize other entry pathways in addition to clathrin-mediated endocytosis under different circumstances. However, there appears to be an important role for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the infection of HOS, HeLa, Vero, 293T and primary human endothelial cells with EbGP pseudotypes and Vero and HeLa cells with replication-competent EBOV as presented in this study.

Recent studies indicate that the viral endocytic pathways are not as well defined as was previously believed. Several studies have shown that although some viruses such as HIV ( Popik, Alce, and Au, 2002 ), Vaccinia virus ( Chung, Huang, and Chang, 2005 ), Coxsackievirus ( Triantafilou and Triantafilou, 2003 ) and filoviruses ( Bavari et al., 2002 ) could use lipid rafts as sites of entry and cholesterol depletion inhibits viral entry, yet these viruses may not necessarily enter via caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, some studies have shown that clathrin-mediated endocytosis may occur in the absence of AP-2 ( Lakadamyali, Rust, and Zhuang, 2006 ) and ( Motley et al., 2003 ), which was initially considered to be a critical adaptor for this pathway. These data indicate that although a virus may use a certain pathway for entry, it could use proteins or adaptors that are different from what have been previously described as essential and hence the use of certain inhibitors of a pathway may not necessarily block viral entry.

There are currently no therapeutic modalities available for EBOV infection. It is intriguing that chlorpromazine was highly effective in blocking EBOV infection. Chlorpromazine is a well-known psychotropic drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( Adams et al., 2005 ), which has also been shown to possess antimicrobial activities ( Kristiansen and Mortensen, 1987 ). Our findings suggest that this drug could be further investigated as a lead for chemoinformatics-based design and development of a series of potential inhibitors of EBOV replication. In this regard, it would be advantageous to examine other phenothiazine derivatives with lower psychotropic effects. Although chlorpromazine is shown to disrupt the assembly of clathrin ( Wang, Rothberg, and Anderson, 1993 ), the detailed mechanism of action of chlorpromazine is not entirely understood. Chlorpromazine is also known to inhibit calmodulin ( Marshak, Lukas, and Watterson, 1985 ) and ( Wrenn et al., 1981 ) and can bind to phospholipid components of the plasma membrane of endothelial cells ( Hueck et al., 2000 ). Therefore, it is possible that modulation of other cellular pathways may also contribute to the inhibitory effect of chlorpromazine on EBOV replication.

Using EbGP pseudotyped HIV as well as replication-competent EBOV, the results of this study have provided extensive evidence that EBOV uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis as an entry pathway. Another novel observation is the abrogation of EBOV infection by chlorpromazine, which could have important therapeutic implications. The role of chlorpromazine in inhibiting EBOV infection in animal models is under investigation.
