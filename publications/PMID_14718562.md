Phospholipase D (PLD) is a key facilitator of multiple types of membrane vesicle 
trafficking events. Two PLD isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, exist in mammals. Initial 
studies based on overexpression studies suggested that in resting cells, human 
PLD1 localized primarily to the Golgi and perinuclear vesicles in multiple cell 
types. In contrast, overexpressed mouse PLD2 was observed to localize primarily 
to the plasma membrane, although internalization on membrane vesicles was 
observed subsequent to serum stimulation. A recent report has suggested that the 
assignment of PLD2 to the plasma membrane is in error, because the endogenous 
isoform in rat secretory cells was imaged and found to be present primarily in 
the Golgi apparatus. We have reexamined this issue by using a monoclonal 
antibody specific for mouse PLD2, and find, as reported initially using 
overexpression studies, that endogenous mouse PLD2 is detected most readily at 
the plasma membrane in multiple cell types. In addition, we report that mouse, 
rat, and human PLD2 when overexpressed all similarly localize to the plasma 
membrane in cell lines from all three species. Finally, studies conducted using 
overexpression of wild-type active or dominant-negative isoforms of PLD2 and RNA 
interference-mediated targeting of PLD2 suggest that PLD2 functions at the 
plasma membrane to facilitate endocytosis of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor.
