Linear dose-response relationship of erythrocyte enzyme-activity mutations in 
offspring of ethylnitrosourea-treated mice.

Charles DJ, Pretsch W.

The specific activity of 10 erythrocyte enzymes was measured to detect gene 
mutations in F1 offspring of male mice treated with 3 different doses of 
ethylnitrosourea (ENU). After administration of ENU or of the solvent 
(controls), the (101/El X C3H/El)F1 hybrid males were mated to untreated T-stock 
females. No enzyme-activity mutant was found in 3610 F1 offspring of the control 
group. After treatment of postspermatogonial germ-cell stages, 1 mutant in 1125 
F1 offspring of males treated with 160 mg ENU/kg body weight, and 2 mutants in 
1319 F1 offspring of a 250-mg/kg group were observed. After treatment of 
spermatogonia, 9 enzyme-activity mutants in 4247 F1 offspring of males treated 
with 80 mg ENU/kg body weight, 15 mutants in 3396 F1 offspring of a 160-mg/kg 
group, and 9 mutants in 1402 F1 offspring of a 250-mg/kg group were detected. 
The mutation frequencies in spermatogonia were significantly different from that 
of the controls (P less than 0.01). The dose-response curve was found to be 
linear. The frequencies of enzyme-activity mutations are comparable to those of 
recessive specific-locus mutations determined in the same experiments. 
Enzyme-activity mutants with reduced activity as well as mutants with enhanced 
activity were found. Genetic and biochemical characterization of enzyme-activity 
mutants was routinely performed. In inter se crossings of heterozygotes, no 
offspring expressing a third phenotype other than the wild type and the 
heterozygote were found in approximately half of the mutation studies. The 
recovered mouse mutants might be used as animal models to study corresponding 
genetic diseases in humans.
