Caenorhabditis elegans polycystins LOV-1 and PKD-2 are expressed in the 
male-specific HOB neuron, and are necessary for sensation of the hermaphrodite 
vulva during mating. We demonstrate that male vulva location behavior and 
expression of lov-1 and pkd-2 in the ciliated sensory neuron HOB require the 
activities of transcription factor EGL-46 and to some extent also EGL-44. This 
EGL-46- regulated program is specific to HOB and is distinct from a general 
ciliogenic pathway functioning in all ciliated neurons. The ciliogenic pathway 
regulator DAF-19 affects downstream components of the HOB-specific program 
indirectly and is independent of EGL-46 activity. The sensory function of HOB 
requires the combined action of these two distinct regulatory pathways.
