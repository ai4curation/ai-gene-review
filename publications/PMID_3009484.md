Penicillin-binding protein (PBP)-2 and the RodA protein are known to function in 
determining the rod shape of Escherichia coli cells. Peptidoglycan biosynthetic 
reactions that required these two proteins were demonstrated in the membrane 
fraction prepared from an E. coli strain that overproduced both of these two 
proteins and which lacked PBP-1B activity (the major peptidoglycan synthetase 
activity in the normal E. coli membranes). The cross-linked peptidoglycan was 
synthesized from UDP-N-acetylmuramylpentapeptide and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in 
the presence of a high concentration of cefmetazole that inhibited all of PBPs 
except PBP-2. The peptidoglycan was synthesized via a lipid intermediate and 
showed up to 30% cross-linking. The cross-linking reaction was strongly 
inhibited by the amidinopenicillin, mecillinam, and by other beta-lactam 
antibiotics that have a high affinity for PBP-2, but not by beta-lactams that 
had very low affinity for PBP-2. The formation of peptidoglycan required the 
presence of high levels of both PBP-2 and the RodA protein in the membranes, but 
it is unclear which of the two proteins was primarily responsible for the 
extension of the glycan chains (transglycosylation). However, the sensitivity of 
the cross-linking reaction to specific beta-lactam antibiotics strongly 
suggested that it was catalyzed by PBP-2. The transglycosylase activity of the 
membranes was sensitive to enramycin and vancomycin and was unusual in being 
stimulated greatly by a high concentration of a chelating agent.
