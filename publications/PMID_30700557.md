Sphingolipids compose a lipid family critical for membrane structure as well as 
intra- and intercellular signaling. De novo sphingolipid biosynthesis is 
initiated by the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), which resides in the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. In both yeast and mammalian species, SPT 
activity is homeostatically regulated through small ER membrane proteins, the 
Orms in yeast and the ORMDLs in mammalian cells. These proteins form stable 
complexes with SPT. In yeast, the homeostatic regulation of SPT relies, at least 
in part, on phosphorylation of the Orms. However, this does not appear to be the 
case for the mammalian ORMDLs. Here, we accomplished a cell-free reconstitution 
of the sphingolipid regulation of the ORMDL-SPT complex to probe the underlying 
regulatory mechanism. Sphingolipid and ORMDL-dependent regulation of SPT was 
demonstrated in isolated membranes, essentially free of cytosol. This suggests 
that this regulation does not require soluble cytosolic proteins or small 
molecules such as ATP. We found that this system is particularly responsive to 
the pro-apoptotic sphingolipid ceramide and that this response is strictly 
stereospecific, indicating that ceramide regulates the ORMDL-SPT complex via a 
specific binding interaction. Yeast membranes harboring the Orm-SPT system also 
directly responded to sphingolipid, suggesting that yeast cells have, in 
addition to Orm phosphorylation, an additional Orm-dependent SPT regulatory 
mechanism. Our results indicate that ORMDL/Orm-mediated regulation of SPT 
involves a direct interaction of sphingolipid with the membrane-bound components 
of the SPT-regulatory apparatus.
