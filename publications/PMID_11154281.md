Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases (SGKs) form a novel family of 
serine/threonine kinases that are activated in response to a variety of 
extracellular stimuli. SGKs are related to Akt (also called PKB), a 
serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in promoting cell survival. 
Like Akt, SGKs are activated by the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and 
translocate to the nucleus upon growth factor stimulation. However the 
physiological substrates and cellular functions of SGKs remained to be 
identified. We hypothesized that SGKs regulate cellular functions in concert 
with Akt by phosphorylating common targets within the nucleus. The 
best-characterized nuclear substrates of Akt are transcription factors of the 
Forkhead family. Akt phosphorylates Forkhead transcription factors such as 
FKHRL1, leading to FKHRL1's exit from the nucleus and the consequent shutoff of 
FKHRL1 target genes. We show here that SGK1, like Akt, promotes cell survival 
and that it does so in part by phosphorylating and inactivating FKHRL1. However, 
SGK and Akt display differences with respect to the efficacy with which they 
phosphorylate the three regulatory sites on FKHRL1. While both kinases can 
phosphorylate Thr-32, SGK displays a marked preference for Ser-315 whereas Akt 
favors Ser-253. These findings suggest that SGK and Akt may coordinately 
regulate the function of FKHRL1 by phosphorylating this transcription factor at 
distinct sites. The efficient phosphorylation of these three sites on FKHRL1 by 
SGK and Akt appears to be critical to the ability of growth factors to suppress 
FKHRL1-dependent transcription, thereby preventing FKHRL1 from inducing cell 
cycle arrest and apoptosis. These findings indicate that SGK acts in concert 
with Akt to propagate the effects of PI3K activation within the nucleus and to 
mediate the biological outputs of PI3K signaling, including cell survival and 
cell cycle progression.
