The urokinase receptor (CD87) participates to the pericellular proteolytic 
potential of migrating cells and to the recruitment of leukocytes during 
inflammation. It consists of three structurally homologous domains, with the 
C-terminal domain D3 attached to cell membranes through a GPI anchor. CD87 is 
susceptible to an endoproteolytic processing removing the N-terminal domain D1 
and generating truncated D2D3 membrane species, thus modulating CD87-associated 
functions. Full-length or truncated CD87 can be also released from cells via 
juxtamembrane cleavage by phospholipases and/or by yet unidentified proteinases. 
Using a recombinant CD87 and the CD87-positive monocytic U937 cell line and 
isolated blood monocytes, we show by protein immunoblotting and flow 
immunocytometry that the human neutrophil serine-proteinases elastase and 
cathepsin G cleave CD87 within the D1-D2 linker sequence, while in addition 
cathepsin G is highly efficient in cleaving the C terminus of D3. The 
combination of cathepsin G and elastase provided by degranulated neutrophils 
results in enzymatic cooperation leading to the release from monocytic cells of 
a truncated D2D3 species resembling that previously described in pathological 
body fluids. Using mass spectrometry analysis, the proteolytic fragmentation of 
synthetic peptides mapping the D1-D2 linker and D3 C-terminal domains identifies 
potential cleavage sites for each enzyme and suggests the existence of a 
mechanism regulating the CD87(D1-D2)-associated chemotactic activity. Finally, 
isolated or combined elastase and cathepsin G drastically reduce the capacity of 
cells to bind urokinase. Secretable leukocyte serine-proteinases are thus 
endowed with high potential for the regulation of CD87 expression and function 
on inflammatory cells.
