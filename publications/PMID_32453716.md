Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a recessive neurodevelopmental ciliopathy 
characterized by a pathognomonic hindbrain malformation. All known JBTS genes 
encode proteins involved in the structure or function of primary cilia, 
ubiquitous antenna-like organelles essential for cellular signal transduction. 
Here, we used the recently identified JBTS-associated protein armadillo repeat 
motif-containing 9 (ARMC9) in tandem-affinity purification and yeast 2-hybrid 
screens to identify a ciliary module whose dysfunction underlies JBTS. In 
addition to the known JBTS-associated proteins CEP104 and CSPP1, we identified 
coiled-coil domain containing 66 (CCDC66) and TOG array regulator of axonemal 
microtubules 1 (TOGARAM1) as ARMC9 interaction partners. We found that TOGARAM1 
variants cause JBTS and disrupt TOGARAM1 interaction with ARMC9. Using a 
combination of protein interaction analyses, characterization of patient-derived 
fibroblasts, and analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish and hTERT-RPE1 
cells, we demonstrated that dysfunction of ARMC9 or TOGARAM1 resulted in short 
cilia with decreased axonemal acetylation and polyglutamylation, but relatively 
intact transition zone function. Aberrant serum-induced ciliary resorption and 
cold-induced depolymerization in ARMC9 and TOGARAM1 patient cell lines suggest a 
role for this new JBTS-associated protein module in ciliary stability.
