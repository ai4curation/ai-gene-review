Proapoptotic BCL-2 family members BAX and BAK are required for the initiation of 
mitochondrial dysfunction during apoptosis and for maintaining the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) stores necessary for Ca(2+)-dependent cell death. 
Conversely, antiapoptotic BCL-2 has been shown to decrease Ca(2+) concentration 
in the ER. We found that Bax(-/-)Bak(-/-) double-knockout (DKO) cells have 
reduced resting ER Ca(2+) levels because of increased Ca(2+) leak and an 
increase in the Ca(2+)-permeable, hyperphosphorylated state of the inositol 
trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R-1). The ER Ca(2+) defect of DKO cells is 
rescued by RNA interference reduction of IP3R-1, supporting the argument that 
this channel regulates the increased Ca(2+) leak in these cells. BCL-2 and 
IP3R-1 physically interact at the ER, and their binding is increased in the 
absence of BAX and BAK. Moreover, knocking down BCL-2 decreases IP3R-1 
phosphorylation and ER Ca(2+) leak rate in the DKO cells. These findings support 
a model in which BCL-2 family members regulate IP3R-1 phosphorylation to control 
the rate of ER Ca(2+) leak from intracellular stores.
