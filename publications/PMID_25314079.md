Snail is primarily known as a transcriptional repressor that induces 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition by suppressing adherent proteins. Emerging 
evidence suggests that Snail can act as an activator; however, the mechanism and 
biological significance are unclear. Here, we found that CREB-binding protein 
(CBP) is the critical factor in Snail-mediated target gene transactivation. CBP 
interacts with Snail and acetylates Snail at lysine 146 and lysine 187, which 
prevents the repressor complex formation. We further identified several 
Snail-activated targets, including TNF-α, which is also the upstream signal for 
Snail acetylation, and CCL2 and CCL5, which promote the recruitment of 
tumor-associated macrophages. Here, we present our results on the mechanism by 
which Snail induces target gene transactivation to remodel the tumor 
microenvironment.
