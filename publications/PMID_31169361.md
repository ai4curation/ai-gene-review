Many protein-protein and peptide-protein interactions (PPIs) play key roles in 
the regulation of biological functions, and therefore, the modulation of PPIs 
has become an attractive target of new drug development. Although a number of 
PPIs have already been identified, over 100 000 unknown PPIs are predicted to 
exist. To uncover such unknown PPIs, it is important to devise a conceptually 
distinct method from that of currently available methods. Herein, an mRNA 
display by using a total RNA library derived from various human tissues, which 
serves as a unique method to physically isolate peptide epitopes that 
potentially bind to a target protein of interest, is reported. In this study, 
selection was performed against Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1) as a 
model target protein, leading to a peptide epitope originating from 
astrotactin-1 (ASTN1). It turned out that this ASTN1 peptide was able to 
interact with Keap1 more strongly than that with a known peptide derived from 
Nrf2; a well-known, naturally occurring Keap1 binder. This case study 
demonstrates the applicability of peptidomic mRNA display for the rapid 
exploration of consensus binding peptide motifs and the potential for the 
discovery of unknown PPIs with other proteins of interest.
