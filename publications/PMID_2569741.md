Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes were isolated based upon their 
dosage-dependent rescue of a temperature-sensitive mutation of the gene CDC28, 
which encodes a protein kinase involved in control of cell division. CLN1 and 
CLN2 encode closely related proteins that also share homology with cyclins. 
Cyclins, characterized by a dramatic periodicity of abundance through the cell 
cycle, are thought to be involved in mitotic induction in animal cells. A 
dominant mutation in the CLN2 gene, CLN2-1, advances the G1- to S-phase 
transition in cycling cells and impairs the ability of cells to arrest in G1 
phase in response to external signals, suggesting that the encoded protein is 
involved in G1 control of the cell cycle in Saccharomyces.

Abstract

Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes were isolated based upon their dosage-dependent rescue of a temperature-sensitive mutation of the gene CDC28, which encodes a protein kinase involved in control of cell division. CLN1 and CLN2 encode closely related proteins that also share homology with cyclins. Cyclins, characterized by a dramatic periodicity of abundance through the cell cycle, are thought to be involved in mitotic induction in animal cells. A dominant mutation in the CLN2 gene, CLN2-1, advances the G1- to S-phase transition in cycling cells and impairs the ability of cells to arrest in G1 phase in response to external signals, suggesting that the encoded protein is involved in G1 control of the cell cycle in Saccharomyces.
