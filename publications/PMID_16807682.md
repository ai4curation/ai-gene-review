Thermotolerance is induced by moderated heat acclimation. Suspension cultures of 
heat-acclimated Arabidopsis thaliana L. (Heynh.), ecotype Columbia, show 
thermotolerance against lethal heat shock (9 min, 50 degrees C), as evidenced by 
a chlorophyll assay and fluorescein diacetate staining. To monitor the 
genome-wide transcriptome changes induced by heat acclimation at 37 degrees C, 
we constructed an A. thaliana cDNA microarray containing 7,989 unique genes, and 
applied it to A. thaliana suspension-culture cells harvested at various times 
(0.5, 1, 2.5, 6, and 16 h) during heat acclimation. Data analysis revealed 165 
differentially expressed genes that were grouped into ten clusters. We compared 
these genes with published and publicly available microarray heat-stress-related 
data sets in AtGenExpress. Heat-shock proteins were strongly expressed, as 
previously reported, and we found several of the up-regulated genes encoded 
detoxification and regulatory proteins. Moreover, the transcriptional induction 
of DREB2 (dehydration responsive element-binding factor 2) subfamily genes and 
COR47/rd17 under heat stress suggested cross-talk between the signaling pathways 
for heat and dehydration responses.
