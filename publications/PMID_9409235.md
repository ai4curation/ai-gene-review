The effect of the three platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms AA, AB, 
and BB on migration was investigated in cultured human saphenous vein smooth 
muscle cells. The modified Boyden chamber technique yielded efficacies BB >> AB, 
AA = 0. However, the BB concentration-response relationship displayed a 
pronounced peak, occurring between 1 and 10 ng/mL, with no response above this 
range. Checkerboard analysis showed that the promotion of migration at low 
concentrations was chemotactic in nature but that the downturn was independent 
of gradient. Furthermore, at high concentrations BB was able to prevent 
chemotaxis induced by fetal calf serum and epidermal growth factor (EGF). 
Experiments using low concentrations of BB in combination with high 
concentrations of AA to saturate PDGF alpha-receptors in the presence and 
absence of a neutralizing antibody to alpha-receptors revealed that 
alpha-receptor activation induced partial inhibition of chemotaxis but this did 
not account for the inhibition of migration by high concentrations of BB. 
Despite possessing no significant chemotactic action itself, high concentrations 
of the AB isoform completely inhibited BB induced chemotaxis. Taken together 
these results suggest that the chemotactic signal induced by PDGF is dominated 
by PDGF beta-receptors and switches from positive at low concentrations to 
negative at higher concentrations. Stimulation of DNA synthesis by the three 
isoforms (as measured by [3H] thymidine incorporation) yielded saturable 
responses for the AB and BB isoforms, with similar efficacy and weak or no 
response for the AA isoform. Concentration-dependent patterns of tyrosine 
phosphorylation of certain proteins mirrored the form of the chemotactic 
response and suggest one possible underlying regulatory mechanism to account for 
the disparity between PDGF-induced chemotaxis and DNA synthesis.
