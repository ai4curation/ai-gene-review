The proapoptotic protein Bim is expressed de novo following withdrawal of serum 
survival factors. Here, we show that Bim-/- fibroblasts and epithelial cells 
exhibit reduced cell death following serum withdrawal in comparison with their 
wild-type counterparts. In viable cells, Bax associates with Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L) and 
Mcl-1. Upon serum withdrawal, newly expressed Bim(EL) associates with Bcl-x(L) 
and Mcl-1, coinciding with the dissociation of Bax from these proteins. Survival 
factors can prevent association of Bim with pro-survival proteins by preventing 
Bim expression. However, we now show that even preformed Bim(EL)/Mcl-1 and 
Bim(EL)/Bcl-x(L) complexes can be rapidly dissociated following activation of 
ERK1/2 by survival factors. The dissociation of Bim from Mcl-1 is specific for 
Bim(EL) and requires ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Bim(EL) at Ser(65). 
Finally, ERK1/2-dependent dissociation of Bim(EL) from Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) may 
play a role in regulating Bim(EL) degradation, since mutations in the Bim(EL) 
BH3 domain that disrupt binding to Mcl-1 cause increased turnover of Bim(EL). 
These results provide new insights into the role of Bim in cell death and its 
regulation by the ERK1/2 survival pathway.
