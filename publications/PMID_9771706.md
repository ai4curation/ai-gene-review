Wolfram syndrome (WFS; OMIM 222300) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
disorder defined by young-onset non-immune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
and progressive optic atrophy. Linkage to markers on chromosome 4p was confirmed 
in five families. On the basis of meiotic recombinants and disease-associated 
haplotypes, the WFS gene was localized to a BAC/P1 contig of less than 250 kb. 
Mutations in a novel gene (WFS1) encoding a putative transmembrane protein were 
found in all affected individuals in six WFS families, and these mutations were 
associated with the disease phenotype. WFS1 appears to function in survival of 
islet beta-cells and neurons.
