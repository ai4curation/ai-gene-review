The predominant type of cellular junction between normal podocyte foot processes 
is the slit diaphragm. Under nephrotic conditions,however, foot process 
effacement leads to the loss of slit diaphragms and the new formationof tight 
junctions composed of the proteins coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) 
and zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1). Podocin, a protein that plays a key role in 
maintaining the integrity of the slit diaphragm, has also been localized to 
these tight junctions, but its function at this site is unknown. In this study, 
we confirmed that podocin colocalizes with CAR and ZO-1 at the tight junction 
between foot processes in nephrotic rats. Using primary cultures of rat 
podocytes, as well as cell lines that co-expressed podocin and CAR, we observed 
that podocin was recruited to sites of cell-cell contact and that it 
co-localized with CAR and ZO-1. Immunoprecipitation suggested that these three 
junctional proteins from a multi-protein complex. Consistent with this, we found 
that podociin facilitated the coalescence of preassembled lipid rafts containing 
CAR and restricted their lateral mobility, the latter likely a result of dynamic 
actin reorganization and subsequent tethering of CAR-podocin complexes to the 
cytoskeleton. In conclusion, in addition to serving as a structural protein of 
the slit diaphragm of normal podocytes, our data suggest that podocin may also 
serve as a scaffold that links tight junction proteins to the actin cytoskeleton 
in nephrotic foot processes.
