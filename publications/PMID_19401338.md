The presence of subdomains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enables this 
organelle to perform a variety of functions, yet the mechanisms underlying their 
organization are poorly understood. In the present study, we show that syntaxin 
18, a SNAP (soluble NSF attachment protein) receptor localized in the ER, is 
important for the organization of two ER subdomains, smooth/rough ER membranes 
and ER exit sites. Knockdown of syntaxin 18 caused a global change in ER 
membrane architecture, leading to the segregation of the smooth and rough ER. 
Furthermore, the organization of ER exit sites was markedly changed 
concomitantly with dispersion of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the 
Golgi complex. These morphological changes in the ER were substantially 
recovered by treatment of syntaxin-18-depleted cells with brefeldin A, a reagent 
that stimulates retrograde membrane flow to the ER. These results suggest that 
syntaxin 18 has an important role in ER subdomain organization by mediating the 
fusion of retrograde membrane carriers with the ER membrane.
