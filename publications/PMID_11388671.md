The p53 protein has recently been reported to be capable of mediating apoptosis 
through a pathway that is not dependent on its transactivation function. We 
report here that the PIASy member of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT 
family inhibited p53's transactivation function without compromising its ability 
to induce apoptosis of the H1299 nonsmall cell lung carcinoma cell line. The p53 
protein bound to PIASy in yeast two-hybrid assays and coprecipitated in 
complexes with p53 in immunoprecipitates from mammalian cells. PIASy inhibited 
the DNA-binding activity of p53 in nuclear extracts and blocked the ability of 
p53 to induce expression of two of its target genes, Bax and p21Waf1/Cip1, in 
H1299 cells. The block in p53-mediated induction of Bax and p21 was determined 
to be at the level of transactivation, since PIASy inhibited p53's ability to 
transactivate a p21/luciferase reporter construct. PIASy did not effect the 
incidence of apoptosis in H1299 cells upregulated for p53. PIASy appears to 
regulate p53-mediated functions and may direct p53 into a 
transactivation-independent mode of apoptosis.
