RATIONALE: The developmental role of the H3K27 demethylases Jmjd3, especially 
its epigenetic regulation at target genes in response to upstream developmental 
signaling, is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of Jmjd3 during mesoderm and cardiovascular 
lineage commitment.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Ablation of Jmjd3 in mouse embryonic stem cells does not 
affect the maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal but compromised mesoderm 
and subsequent endothelial and cardiac differentiation. Jmjd3 reduces H3K27me3 
marks at the Brachyury promoter and facilitates the recruitment of Î²-catenin, 
which is critical for Wnt signal-induced mesoderm differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that Jmjd3 is required for mesoderm 
differentiation and cardiovascular lineage commitment.
