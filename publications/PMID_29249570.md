Specificity of the ubiquitin proteasome system is controlled by ubiquitin E3 
ligases, including their major representatives, the multisubunit cullin-RING 
ubiquitin (Ub) ligases (CRLs). More than 200 different CRLs are divided into 
seven families according to their cullin scaffolding proteins (CUL1-7) around 
which they are assembled. Research over two decades has revealed that different 
CRL families are specialized to fulfill specific cellular functions. Whereas 
many CUL1-based CRLs (CRL1s) ubiquitylate cell cycle regulators, CRL4 complexes 
often associate with chromatin to control DNA metabolism. Based on studies about 
differentiation programs of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including myogenesis, 
neurogenesis, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and adipogenesis, we propose here 
that CRL3 complexes evolved to fulfill a pivotal role in mammalian cell 
differentiation.
