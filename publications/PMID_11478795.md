CD40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family. 
CD40-mediated signal transduction involves the recruitment of several 
cytoplasmic proteins and induces expression of a large number of genes. TTRAP, a 
novel protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 and with 
TNF-receptor associated factors (TRAFs), has been cloned and shown to inhibit 
nuclear factor-kappaB activation (NF-kappaB). By using various 
bioinformatics-based sequence and structure analyses of proteins involved in 
signaling by the TNF receptor family, we found that TTRAP is a member of a 
superfamily of Mg(2+)/Mn(2+)-dependent phosphodiesterases. More precisely, our 
results suggest that TTRAP is related to the human APE1, a Mg(2+)-dependent 
endonuclease. This potential novel function of TTRAP raises the intriguing 
possibility for a role of APE1-like DNA-repair endonucleases in TNF receptor 
family-mediated signaling and functions.
