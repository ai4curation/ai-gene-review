COP I-coated vesicles are involved in vesicular trafficking in the early 
secretory pathway. The COP I coat is composed of seven subunits, alpha-, beta-, 
beta'-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-COPs. Evidence suggests, however, 
that there may be isoforms of the COP I subunits. In the present study, we 
identified homologs of gamma-COP (gamma2-COP; original gamma-COP is referred to 
as gamma1-COP in this paper) and of zeta-COP (zeta2-COP; original zeta-COP is 
referred to as zeta1-COP). gamma1- and gamma2-COPs, and zeta1- and zeta2-COPs 
share 80 and 75%, respectively, of amino acids. mRNAs for gamma2-COP and 
zeta2-COP are expressed ubiquitously, suggesting their fundamental role in 
cellular function. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that gamma2-COP and 
zeta2-COP are colocalized with beta-COP in the paranuclear cis-Golgi region. 
Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicates that gamma1- and gamma2-COPs can directly, 
albeit promiscuously, interact with zeta1- and zeta2-COPs. Like gamma1-COP, 
gamma2-COP can form a complex with beta-COP in vivo. The gamma1-COP-containing 
and gamma2-COP-containing complexes can similarly interact with the cytoplasmic 
domain of p23. These results indicate that gamma2-COP and zeta2-COP can form a 
COP I-like complex in place of gamma1-COP and zeta1-COP, respectively, and 
suggest that the COP I complex and the COP I-like complex are functionally 
redundant.
