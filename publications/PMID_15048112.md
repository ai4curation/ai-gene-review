Both plants and animals respond to infection by synthesizing compounds that 
directly inhibit or kill invading pathogens. We report here the identification 
of infection-inducible antimicrobial peptides in Caenorhabditis elegans. 
Expression of two of these peptides, NLP-29 and NLP-31, was differentially 
regulated by fungal and bacterial infection and was controlled in part by tir-1, 
which encodes an ortholog of SARM, a Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain 
protein. Inactivation of tir-1 by RNA interference caused increased 
susceptibility to infection. We identify protein partners for TIR-1 and show 
that the small GTPase Rab1 and the f subunit of ATP synthase participate 
specifically in the control of antimicrobial peptide gene expression. As the 
activity of tir-1 was independent of the single nematode Toll-like receptor, 
TIR-1 may represent a component of a previously uncharacterized, but conserved, 
innate immune signaling pathway.
