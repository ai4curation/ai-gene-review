The net contribution of endothelin type A (ET(A)) and type B (ET(B)) receptors 
in blood pressure regulation in humans and experimental animals, including the 
conscious mouse, remains undefined. Thus we assessed the role of ET(A) and ET(B) 
receptors in the control of basal blood pressure and also the role of ET(A) 
receptors in maintaining the hypertensive effects of systemic ET(B) blockade in 
telemetry-instrumented mice. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate were 
recorded continuously from the carotid artery and daily (24 h) values 
determined. At baseline, MAP ranged from 99 +/- 1 to 101 +/- 1 mmHg and heart 
rate ranged between 547 +/- 15 and 567 +/- 19 beats/min (n = 6). Daily oral 
administration of the ET(B) selective antagonist A-192621 [10 mg/kg twice daily] 
increased MAP to 108 +/- 1 and 112 +/- 2 mmHg on days 1 and 5, respectively. 
Subsequent coadministration of the ET(A) selective antagonist atrasentan (5 
mg/kg twice daily) in conjunction with A-192621 (10 mg/kg twice daily) decreased 
MAP to baseline values on day 6 (99 +/- 2 mmHg) and to below baseline on day 8 
(89 +/- 3 mmHg). In a separate group of mice (n = 6) in which the treatment was 
reversed, systemic blockade of ET(B) receptors produced no hypertension in 
animals pretreated with atrasentan, underscoring the importance of ET(A) 
receptors to maintain the hypertension produced by ET(B) blockade. In a third 
group of mice (n = 10), ET(A) blockade alone (atrasentan; 5 mg/kg twice daily) 
produced an immediate and sustained decrease in MAP to values below baseline 
(baseline values = 101 +/- 2 to 103 +/- 2 mmHg; atrasentan decreased pressure to 
95 +/- 2 mmHg). Thus these data suggest that ET(A) and ET(B) receptors play a 
physiologically relevant role in the regulation of basal blood pressure in 
normal, conscious mice. Furthermore, systemic ET(B) receptor blockade produces 
sustained hypertension in conscious telemetry-instrumented mice that is absent 
in mice pretreated with an ET(A) antagonist, suggesting that ET(A) receptors 
maintain the hypertension produced by ET(B) blockade.
