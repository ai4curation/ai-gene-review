To identify genes involved in the central regulation of energy balance, we 
compared hypothalamic mRNA from lean and obese Psammomys obesus, a polygenic 
model of obesity, using differential display PCR. One mRNA transcript was 
observed to be elevated in obese, and obese diabetic, P. obesus compared with 
lean animals and was subsequently found to be increased 4-fold in the 
hypothalamus of lethal yellow agouti (A(y)/a) mice, a murine model of obesity 
and diabetes. Intracerebroventricular infusion of antisense oligonucleotide 
targeted to this transcript selectively suppressed its hypothalamic mRNA levels 
and resulted in loss of body weight in both P. obesus and Sprague Dawley rats. 
Reductions in body weight were mediated by profoundly reduced food intake 
without a concomitant reduction in metabolic rate. Yeast two-hybrid screening, 
and confirmation in mammalian cells by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 
analysis, demonstrated that the protein it encodes interacts with endophilins, 
mediators of synaptic vesicle recycling and receptor endocytosis in the brain. 
We therefore named this transcript Src homology 3-domain growth factor 
receptor-bound 2-like (endophilin) interacting protein 1 (SGIP1). SGIP1 encodes 
a large proline-rich protein that is expressed predominantly in the brain and is 
highly conserved between species. Together these data suggest that SGIP1 is an 
important and novel member of the group of neuronal molecules required for the 
regulation of energy homeostasis.
