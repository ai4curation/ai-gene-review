The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) orchestrates many cellular and 
tissue-specific processes by degrading damaged and key regulatory proteins. To 
enable investigation of UPS activity in different cell types in a living animal, 
we developed a photoconvertible fluorescent UPS reporter system for live imaging 
and quantification of protein degradation in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our 
reporter consists of the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Dendra2 targeted 
for proteasomal degradation by fusion to the UbG76V mutant form of ubiquitin. In 
contrast to previous reporters, this system permits quantification of UPS 
activity independently of protein synthesis. Our reporter revealed that 
UPS-mediated protein degradation varies in a cell type-specific and 
age-dependent manner in C. elegans.
