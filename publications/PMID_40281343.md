Tumor cells adapt to the inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) and develop 
resistance to immunotherapy, with ferroptosis being a major form of tumor cell 
death. However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells coordinate TME stimuli and 
their unique metabolic traits to evade ferroptosis and develop resistance to 
immunotherapy remain unclear. Here we showed that interferon-γ (IFNγ)-activated 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylates phosphoserine 
aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) at serine 337 (S337), allowing it to interact with 
glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and stabilize the protein, counteracting 
ferroptosis. PSAT1 elevates GPX4 stability by promoting 
α-ketoglutarate-dependent PHD3-mediated GPX4 proline 159 (P159) hydroxylation, 
disrupting its binding to HSC70 and inhibiting autophagy-mediated degradation. 
In mice, reconstitution of PSAT1 S337A or GPX4 P159A promotes ferroptosis and 
suppresses triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression. Blocking PSAT1 
pS337 with CPP elevates IFNγ-induced ferroptosis and enhances the efficacy of 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies in TNBC. Additionally, 
PSAT1-mediated GPX4 hydroxylation correlates with poor immunotherapy outcomes in 
patients with TNBC, highlighting PSAT1's noncanonical role in suppressing 
ferroptosis and immunotherapy sensitivity.
