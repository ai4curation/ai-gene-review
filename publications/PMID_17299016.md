BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a single gene disorder associated 
with a high frequency of cognitive deficits and a complex cognitive phenotype. 
These cognitive deficits have been associated with focal areas of high signal 
intensity on T2 weighted MRI images but the relationship remains controversial.
METHOD: A cohort of 76 children with NF1 and 45 unaffected sibling controls 
(aged 8-16 years) underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment, with the 
NF1 children having MRI examinations.
RESULTS: The presence or number of T2 hyperintensities (T2H) was not associated 
with cognitive dysfunction. However, the location of discrete (well 
circumscribed) T2H in the thalamus was associated with severe and generalised 
cognitive impairment. More diffuse lesions in the thalamus were also associated 
with reductions in IQ but the effects were less marked compared with the 
discrete lesions. Comparing children with NF1 to their unaffected siblings 
revealed more subtle effects of the lesions on cognitive ability.
CONCLUSIONS: T2H cannot be used in general as a radiological marker for 
cognitive deficits in children with NF1; however, lesions in the thalamus are 
strongly associated with cognitive impairment. It is possible that lesions in 
the thalamus in conjunction with more general thalamic hypometabolism may 
compound the level of thalamic dysfunction, resulting in cognitive deficits well 
beyond those produced by T2H in other regions.

Method

A cohort of 76 children with NF1 and 45 unaffected sibling controls (aged 8–16 years) underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment, with the NF1 children having MRI examinations.

Results

The presence or number of T2 hyperintensities (T2H) was not associated with cognitive dysfunction. However, the location of discrete (well circumscribed) T2H in the thalamus was associated with severe and generalised cognitive impairment. More diffuse lesions in the thalamus were also associated with reductions in IQ but the effects were less marked compared with the discrete lesions. Comparing children with NF1 to their unaffected siblings revealed more subtle effects of the lesions on cognitive ability.

Conclusions

T2H cannot be used in general as a radiological marker for cognitive deficits in children with NF1; however, lesions in the thalamus are strongly associated with cognitive impairment. It is possible that lesions in the thalamus in conjunction with more general thalamic hypometabolism may compound the level of thalamic dysfunction, resulting in cognitive deficits well beyond those produced by T2H in other regions.

Patients with NF1 ranged in age from 8.0 to 16.75 years (mean 11.63 (SD 2.32) years). Among the patients, 47% were female and 53% were male, with 61% having sporadic NF1 and 39% familial NF1. Fifty per cent of the cohort had macrocephaly. Of the 76 patients, 54 (71.1%) had at least one discrete T2H whereas 22 (28.9%) had no evidence of any discrete lesions. When taking into account both discrete and diffuse lesions (total T2H), 68 patients (89.5%) had T2H and only eight patients (10.5%) had no lesions on T2 weighted images. Of the 54 patients who showed evidence of a discrete lesion, the number of lesions ranged from 1 to 7, with a mean of 2.96 (median 2, SD 1.78).

The location of T2H in the 76 NF1 children is shown in fig 1. It is noted that there are large differences between diffuse and discrete lesions in their location: basal ganglia and hemispheric T2H were more likely to be discrete whereas lesions in the thalamus, cerebellum and brainstem were more likely to be diffuse. When examining the 45 children with NF1 in whom sibling controls were also studied, there were no significant differences in the frequency, number or location of T2H between this subgroup of children with NF1 and the total NF1 group. Of the 45 pairs, 34 children with NF1 (75.6%) had discrete T2H and 41 (91.1%) has both discrete and diffuse T2H. The results of the cognitive assessment have been previously described in detail. 2 , 31

Discussion

The results of the study show that discrete T2H are present in 71% of NF1 children whereas when diffuse lesions are also taken into account, T2H are present in 90% of children. T2H varied in terms of their frequency and intensity in different anatomical locations. Basal ganglia and hemispheric T2H were more likely to be discrete whereas lesions in the thalamus, cerebellum and brainstem were more likely to be diffuse. A relationship was found between age of the child with NF1 and the presence and number of T2H; those with T2H, on average, were younger than those without T2H, and a greater number of T2H were found in the younger children. This supports our previous longitudinal study showing that T2H disappear with age. 32

The current study did not confirm a relationship between the presence or number of T2H and cognitive ability. We were unable to replicate the previous results from our own group and others that supported an association between the presence of T2H and cognitive dysfunction. 10 , 11 , 12 This is probably because of differences in sample size, as inclusion/exclusion criteria and demographics of the NF1 cohorts have not varied markedly between studies and the current study has effectively double the sample size of our previous study. 11 In addition, by using finer sections through the brain (volume T2 sequence), we have demonstrated that T2H may be comprised of a number of poorly delineated lesions. Thus lesion count can be affected by the sensitivity of the imaging technique used, and previous analyses correlating the number of lesions with cognitive ability may not be particularly accurate. We have addressed this possibility by performing a separate analysis of discrete lesions (which would be detected using less sensitive MRI techniques) and diffuse lesions (which could be missed or not counted as T2H).

Our data add to a growing body of research supporting a relationship between thalamic lesions and cognitive dysfunction in children with NF1. While discrete lesions in the thalamus are relatively rare (∼8%), they appear to have an extreme impact on the NF1 child's level of general intellectual functioning, with a lowering of over 18 IQ points compared with those without discrete thalamic lesions. When familial and other genetic factors were taken into account by examining the lowering of cognitive ability in NF1 children compared with their unaffected siblings, the four pairs of NF1 siblings with discrete thalamic lesions had extreme differences in cognitive ability, with the NF1 children having a mean IQ 28 points lower than their siblings, and falling over 2 SD below their siblings on a task of sustained attention. The presence of both discrete and diffuse lesions in the thalamus (present in 28/45 pairs) revealed a significant, but less severe, lowering of FSIQ, PIQ and processing speed when comparing the NF1 children with their siblings. Examining the lowering of cognitive ability of children with NF1 compared with their siblings appears to be more sensitive in detecting the effects of the NF1 gene on cognition than by comparing group means.

One previous study of children with NF1 found a strong association between T2H in the thalamus and IQ, memory, motor skills and attention. 15 There is also evidence of a relationship between T2H in the thalamus and FSIQ and VIQ, 14 as well as between FSIQ and T1 in the nucleus pulvinarus. 33 In addition, lesions in the thalamus are more likely to evolve into true masses compared with T2H in several other regions, suggesting that lesions in the thalamus may be pathologically different to the T2H lesions seen elsewhere. 34 Children with NF1 have decreased metabolism in the thalamus independent of the presence of T2H, suggesting that delays in thalamic signal processing may contribute to the neuropsychological deficits. 35 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has shown that NF1 patients had significantly less N‐acetylaspartate in the thalamus than healthy controls. 36

It is therefore possible that lesions in the thalamus in conjunction with thalamic hypometabolism may compound the level of thalamic dysfunction, resulting in dysfunction well beyond that produced by T2H in other regions. Support for this hypothesis is evident in the present study, as discrete lesions in the thalamus were associated generally with more broad ranging cognitive deficits (with IQ, academic achievement, memory, perception and motor skills) as well as with more severe deficits (lower mean scores and greater difference scores between NF1 children and their siblings). When diffuse lesions were also taken into account, lesions in the thalamus were associated in general with attention and motor problems, and a lowering of IQ was seen in NF1 children compared with their siblings. However, the cognitive dysfunction in general was less widespread and severe than seen with the discrete lesions alone. This hypothesis has also been suggested by one other research study that found that smaller thalamic lesions were associated with cognitive problems. 14 The authors postulated that as regressing lesions are associated with high choline and low N‐acetylaspartate levels, the regressing (ie, smaller) lesions will be associated with high cell turnover and neuronal loss, leading to deterioration in cognitive functioning. It is also possible that a different underlying pathology of T2H in the thalamus may be causative of the cognitive dysfunction. While there does not appear to be a relationship between changes in T2H and changes in cognitive ability, 32 further longitudinal research examining whether changes in the thalamus are associated with changes in cognitive ability is warranted.
