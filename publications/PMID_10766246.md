Integrin adhesion receptors transduce signals that control complex cell 
functions which require the regulation of gene expression, such as 
proliferation, differentiation and survival. Their intracellular domain has no 
catalytic function, indicating that interaction with other transducing molecules 
is crucial for integrin-mediated signalling. Here we have identified a protein 
that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the beta2 subunit of the 
alphaL/beta2 integrin LFA-1. This protein is JAB1 (Jun activation domain-binding 
protein 1), a coactivator of the c-Jun transcription factor. We found that JAB1 
is present both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of cells and that a fraction 
of JAB1 colocalizes with LFA-1 at the cell membrane. LFA-1 engagement is 
followed by an increase of the nuclear pool of JAB1, paralleled by enhanced 
binding of c-Jun-containing AP-1 complexes to their DNA consensus site and 
increased transactivation of an AP-1-dependent promoter. We suggest that 
signalling through the LFA-1 integrin may affect c-Jun-driven transcription by 
regulating JAB1 nuclear localization. This represents a new pathway for 
integrin-dependent modulation of gene expression.
