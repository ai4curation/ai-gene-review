In response to different cellular stresses, a family of protein kinases 
regulates translation by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic 
initiation factor-2 (eIF-2alpha). Recently, we identified a new family member, 
pancreatic eIF-2alpha kinase (PEK) from rat pancreas. PEK, also referred to as 
RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) 
is a transmembrane protein implicated in translational control in response to 
stresses that impair protein folding in the ER. In this study, we identified and 
characterized PEK homologues from humans, Drosophila melanogaster and 
Caenorhabditis elegans. Expression of human PEK mRNA was found in over 50 
different tissues examined, with highest levels in secretory tissues. In 
mammalian cells subjected to ER stress, we found that elevated eIF-2alpha 
phosphorylation was coincident with increased PEK autophosphorylation and 
eIF-2alpha kinase activity. Activation of PEK was abolished by deletion of PEK 
N-terminal sequences located in the ER lumen. To address the role of C. elegans 
PEK in translational control, we expressed this kinase in yeast and found that 
it inhibits growth by hyperphosphorylation of eIF-2alpha and inhibition of 
eIF-2B. Furthermore, we found that vaccinia virus K3L protein, an inhibitor of 
the eIF-2alpha kinase PKR involved in an anti-viral defence pathway, also 
reduced PEK activity. These results suggest that decreased translation 
initiation by PEK during ER stress may provide the cell with an opportunity to 
remedy the folding problem prior to introducing newly synthesized proteins into 
the secretory pathway.
