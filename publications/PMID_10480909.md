The glypicans compose a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparan 
sulfate proteoglycans. Mutations in dally, a gene encoding a Drosophila 
glypican, and in GPC3, the gene for human glypican-3, implicate glypicans in the 
control of cell growth and division. So far, five members of the glypican family 
have been identified in vertebrates. By sequencing expressed sequence tag clones 
and products of rapid amplifications of cDNA ends, we identified a sixth member 
of the glypican family. The glypican-6 mRNA encodes a protein of 555 amino acids 
that is most homologous to glypican-4 (identity of 63%). Expression of this 
protein in Namalwa cells shows a core protein of approximately 60 kDa that is 
substituted with heparan sulfate only. GPC6, the gene encoding human glypican-6, 
contains nine exons. Like GPC5, the gene encoding glypican-5, GPC6 maps to 
chromosome 13q32. Clustering of the GPC5/GPC6 genes on chromosome 13q32 is 
strongly reminiscent of the clustering of the GPC3/GPC4 genes on chromosome Xq26 
and suggests GPCs arose from a series of gene and genome duplications. Based on 
similarities in sequence and gene organization, glypican-1, glypican-2, 
glypican-4, and glypican-6 appear to define a subfamily of glypicans, differing 
from the subfamily comprising so far glypican-3 and glypican-5. Northern 
blottings indicate that glypican-6 mRNA is widespread, with prominent 
expressions in human fetal kidney and adult ovary. In situ hybridization studies 
localize glypican-6 to mesenchymal tissues in the developing mouse embryo. High 
expressions occur in smooth muscle cells lining the aorta and other major blood 
vessels and in mesenchymal cells of the intestine, kidney, lung, tooth, and 
gonad. Growth factor signaling in these tissues might in part be regulated by 
the presence of glypican-6 on the cell surface.
