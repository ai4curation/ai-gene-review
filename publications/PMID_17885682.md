The actin filament-associated protein AFAP-110 is an actin cross-linking protein 
first identified as a substrate of the viral oncogene v-Src. AFAP-110 regulates 
actin cytoskeleton integrity but also functions as an adaptor protein that 
affects crosstalk between Src and PKC. Here we investigated the roles of 
AFAP-110 in the tumorigenic process of prostate carcinoma. Using 
immunohistochemistry of human tissue arrays, we found that AFAP-110 was absent 
or expressed at very low levels in normal prostatic epithelium and benign 
prostatic hyperplasia but significantly increased in prostate carcinomas. The 
level of AFAP-110 in carcinomas correlated with the Gleason scores. 
Downregulation of AFAP-110 in PC3 prostate cancer cells inhibited cell 
proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity and growth in orthotopic nude mouse 
models. Furthermore, downmodulation of AFAP-110 resulted in decreased 
cell-matrix adhesion and cell migration, defective focal adhesions, and reduced 
integrin beta1 expression. Reintroduction of avian AFAP-110 or a mutant 
disabling its interaction with Src restored these properties. However, 
expression of an AFAP-110 lacking the PKC-interacting domain failed to restore 
properties of parental cells. Thus, increased expression of AFAP-110 is 
associated with progressive stages of prostate cancer and is critical for 
tumorigenic growth, in part by regulating focal contacts in a PKC-dependent 
mechanism.
