The mutations that cause Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) lead to photoreceptor 
cell death at an early age, causing childhood blindness. To unravel the 
molecular basis of LCA, we analyzed how mutations in LCA5 affect the 
connectivity of the encoded protein lebercilin at the interactome level. In 
photoreceptors, lebercilin is uniquely localized at the cilium that bridges the 
inner and outer segments. Using a generally applicable affinity proteomics 
approach, we showed that lebercilin specifically interacted with the 
intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery in HEK293T cells. This interaction 
disappeared when 2 human LCA-associated lebercilin mutations were introduced, 
implicating a specific disruption of IFT-dependent protein transport, an 
evolutionarily conserved basic mechanism found in all cilia. Lca5 inactivation 
in mice led to partial displacement of opsins and light-induced translocation of 
arrestin from photoreceptor outer segments. This was consistent with a defect in 
IFT at the connecting cilium, leading to failure of proper outer segment 
formation and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration. These data suggest that 
lebercilin functions as an integral element of selective protein transport 
through photoreceptor cilia and provide a molecular demonstration that disrupted 
IFT can lead to LCA.
