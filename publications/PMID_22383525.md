Accumulation of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide within the brain is hypothesized to 
be one of the main causes underlying the pathogenic events that occur in 
Alzheimer disease (AD). Consequently, identifying pathways by which Aβ is 
cleared from the brain is crucial for better understanding of the disease 
pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics. Cellular uptake and degradation 
by glial cells is one means by which Aβ may be cleared from the brain. In the 
current study, we demonstrate that modulating levels of the low-density 
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a cell surface receptor that regulates the amount 
of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the brain, altered both the uptake and degradation 
of Aβ by astrocytes. Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in Aβ uptake, whereas 
increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of 
Aβ. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of Aβ and 
facilitated the vesicular transport of Aβ to lysosomes. Despite the fact that 
LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of 
LDLR on Aβ uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE. Finally, we 
provide evidence that Aβ can directly bind to LDLR, suggesting that an 
interaction between LDLR and Aβ could be responsible for LDLR-mediated Aβ 
uptake. Therefore, these results identify LDLR as a receptor that mediates Aβ 
uptake and clearance by astrocytes, and provide evidence that increasing glial 
LDLR levels may promote Aβ degradation within the brain.
