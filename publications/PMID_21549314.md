Accurate genome segregation depends on cohesion mechanisms that link duplicated 
sister chromatids, thereby allowing their tension-dependent biorientation in 
metaphase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cohesion is established during DNA 
replication when Eco1 acetylates the cohesin subunit Smc3. Cohesion 
establishment is restricted to S phase of the cell cycle, but the molecular 
basis of this regulation is unknown. Here, we show that Eco1 is negatively 
regulated by the protein kinase Cdk1. Phosphorylation of Eco1 after S phase 
targets it to SCF(Cdc4) for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. A 
nonphosphorylatable mutant of Eco1 establishes cohesion after DNA replication, 
suggesting that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Eco1 is a key factor limiting 
establishment to S phase. We also show that deregulation of Eco1 results in 
chromosome separation defects in anaphase. We conclude that this regulatory 
mechanism helps optimize the level of sister chromatid cohesion, ensuring a 
robust and efficient anaphase.

INTRODUCTION

The accurate transfer of genetic information to the next generation is necessary for the propagation of life. Multiple mechanisms therefore exist in the cell division cycle to ensure proper duplication and segregation of chromosomes ( Morgan, 2007 ). Following DNA replication in S phase, sister chromatid pairs are bioriented on the mitotic spindle, with one sister attached to each pole. Biorientation requires a means of discerning which chromatids are sisters; a mechanism has therefore evolved to hold sister chromatids together from S phase to mitosis ( Onn et al., 2008 ; Nasmyth and Haering, 2009 ; Uhlmann, 2009 ). When sister chromatid pairs are attached to microtubules from opposite poles, sister-chromatid cohesion resists the spindle forces pulling the chromatids apart. The resulting tension is used both to strengthen microtubule attachments and as a readout for the spindle assembly checkpoint, which delays anaphase until correct biorientation is achieved. When all chromosomes are correctly bioriented, sister-chromatid cohesion is removed, allowing sisters to separate and be pulled apart by the spindle.

Sister-chromatid cohesion depends primarily on a protein complex called cohesin. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the core components of this complex are Smc1, Smc3, Scc1/Mcd1, and Scc3 ( Onn et al., 2008 ; Nasmyth and Haering, 2009 ; Uhlmann, 2009 ). Smc1 and Smc3 are large coiled-coil proteins of the highly conserved ‘Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes’ (SMC) family. These two subunits form a large ring structure that is linked tightly at one end by globular hinge domains, and at the other end by the Scc1 subunit, together with Scc3. At the onset of anaphase, cleavage of Scc1 by the protease separase opens the ring, resulting in cohesin dissociation and thus sister separation ( Uhlmann et al., 2000 ).

Sister-chromatid cohesion is achieved in two steps: cohesin loading and establishment. Beginning in G1 and continuing throughout the cell cycle, cohesin is constitutively loaded onto chromosomes by a poorly understood mechanism that requires the proteins Scc2 and Scc4 ( Ciosk et al., 2000 ). Loaded cohesin appears to have a low affinity for chromosomes ( Gerlich et al., 2006 ) and is thus unable to hold sister chromatids together. As the chromosomes are duplicated in S phase, sister chromatid cohesion is ‘established’ when a fraction of the loaded cohesin molecules is converted into a form that tightly links the newly formed sister chromatids, providing cohesion that can resist the forces of the spindle ( Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998 ; Skibbens et al., 1999 ; Toth et al., 1999 ).

Among the many proteins known to be required for cohesion establishment, the best understood is the highly conserved acetyltransferase Eco1/Ctf7 ( Skibbens et al., 1999 ; Toth et al., 1999 ; Ivanov et al., 2002 ). Eco1 promotes cohesion by acetylating the cohesin subunit Smc3 during S phase. Smc3 acetylation appears to counteract an ‘anti-establishment’ activity of the cohesin-associated proteins Wpl1/Rad61 and Pds5, as mutation of either of these proteins renders Eco1 non-essential for viability ( Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008 ; Unal et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ; Rowland et al., 2009 ; Sutani et al., 2009 ).

The establishment of cohesion is tightly regulated both spatially and temporally. In a normal cell cycle, establishment is strictly confined to S phase; cohesin loaded onto chromatin in a metaphase-arrested cell is not able to establish cohesion ( Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998 ; Haering et al., 2004 ). The restriction of establishment to S phase is believed to depend in part on the recruitment of Eco1 to the replication fork by the processivity clamp PCNA ( Lengronne et al., 2006 ; Moldovan et al., 2006 ; Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008 ). However, association with the replication fork cannot be the only factor limiting cohesion establishment, since certain mutants (such as wpl1 Δ) are able to establish cohesion post-replication ( Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009 ), suggesting that the necessary components are present after S phase but are somehow inhibited.

Indeed, cohesion can also be established after S phase in cells experiencing DNA damage ( Strom et al., 2004 ; Strom et al., 2007 ; Unal et al., 2007 ). Damage-induced cohesion is necessary for efficient DNA repair ( Sjogren and Nasmyth, 2001 ; Strom et al., 2004 ; Unal et al., 2004 ) and genetic evidence suggests that it might be established by acetylation of the Scc1 subunit of cohesin by Eco1, which antagonizes the inhibitory activity of Wpl1 ( Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009 ). The S phase and damage acetylation marks appear to be distinct, as neither is able to compensate for loss of the other at the appropriate stage ( Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009 ).

Despite its critical role in the control of sister chromatid cohesion, the regulation of Eco1 is largely unexplored. In HeLa cells, Esco1 and Esco2 are known to undergo post-translational changes during the cell cycle: chromatin-bound Esco1 is phosphorylated during mitosis, and Esco2 levels are reduced from G2 through the end of M phase ( Hou and Zou, 2005 ). In Xenopus laevis , Eco1 and Eco2 are phosphorylated upon entry into mitosis, and Eco2 is ubiquitinated in late mitosis by the ubiquitin ligase APC Cdh1 ( Lafont et al., 2010 ). The functions of these regulatory events are not known. Intriguingly, over-expression of Eco1 allows yeast cells to establish cohesion in metaphase ( Unal et al., 2007 ), suggesting that Eco1 activity is a limiting factor for post-replicative cohesion establishment, and that Eco1 is somehow inhibited after S phase.

The tight coupling of cohesion establishment to the cell cycle suggests that a cell cycle component regulates Eco1 activity. Indeed, yeast Eco1 is known to be a target of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1, a key regulator of cell cycle progression ( Ubersax et al., 2003 ), and mutations that reduce Cdk1 activity are synthetically lethal with an eco1 mutation ( Brands and Skibbens, 2008 ). However, mutation of the four Cdk1 consensus phosphorylation sites in Eco1 does not affect cell viability or sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents ( Brands and Skibbens, 2008 ), and thus the role of Cdk1 in Eco1 regulation is not clear.

Here, we demonstrate that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Eco1 from late S phase through mitosis leads to its degradation. This helps limit the establishment of cohesion to S phase, as stabilization of Eco1, either through mutation of its Cdk1 sites or activation of the DNA damage pathway, permits ectopic establishment of cohesion in metaphase. Finally, we show that anaphase progression is defective in cells that fail to decrease Eco1 activity after S phase, illustrating the importance of this regulation for robust chromosome segregation.

DISCUSSION

The cycle of sister chromatid cohesion is tightly woven into the fabric of the cell division cycle. In this study we demonstrate the direct regulation of cohesion establishment by the master cell cycle regulator Cdk1. Our results suggest that Clb2-Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Eco1 from late S phase to mitosis targets nuclear Eco1 for ubiquitination by SCF Cdc4 and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This reduces the amount of Eco1 acetyltransferase activity below some threshold required to establish cohesion, which, together with reduced ECO1 transcription in G1 ( Spellman et al., 1998 ), prevents the establishment of new cohesion until DNA replication occurs in S phase of the next cell cycle. In cells containing a nonphosphorylatable Eco1, or upon activation of the DNA damage response, Eco1 is stabilized and cohesion can be established in metaphase.

The regulation of cohesion establishment, like that of all critical processes, is a finely tuned balance of opposing positive and negative influences. In this case, the acetyltransferase activity of Eco1 during DNA replication facilitates the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. In metaphase, however, Cdk1 kinase activity inhibits Eco1, allowing the anti-establishment activities of Wpl1 and Pds5 to predominate, thus preventing establishment after replication. By modulating the positive input (establishment), Cdk1 helps generate a level of chromosomal cohesion that is optimal for efficient sister chromatid separation in anaphase.

We uncovered the regulation of Eco1 by Cdk1 using a new method of creating constitutively phosphorylated mutants. Linking Cdk1 to Eco1 (via Cln3) inhibited Eco1 function, greatly reducing cell viability. Significantly, ECO1-4D did not mimic the phosphorylated state, revealing the usefulness of the fusion technique for detecting phenotypes that are not seen with traditional phosphomimics. The effect of Cdk1 phosphorylation on the majority of its substrates is unknown; the technique presented here, combined with previously created yeast library strains ( Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003 ) and the recent identification of hundreds of Cdk1 substrates ( Ubersax et al., 2003 ; Holt et al., 2009 ), could facilitate a better understanding of the role of Cdk1 in regulating cell cycle events.

Eco1 undergoes an interesting pattern of phosphorylation by Cdk1 over the cell cycle ( Figure 3D ). Given that Eco1 is not a Clb5-specific substrate ( Figure 3A ) ( Loog and Morgan, 2005 ), the phosphorylation seen in early S phase is likely to be incomplete. This partial phosphorylation might not be sufficient for degradation, given that Cdc4 only has appreciable affinity for multiply phosphorylated substrates. Instead, early phosphorylation by Clb5-Cdk1 may prime Eco1 to be rapidly phosphorylated when Clb2 activity rises in late S phase. It is also possible that phosphorylated Eco1 exists in S phase cells because some other mechanism prevents its degradation at that stage of the cell cycle.

In a cell experiencing double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), new cohesion aids DNA repair and is established by the reactivation of Eco1 ( Sjogren and Nasmyth, 2001 ; Strom et al., 2004 ; Unal et al., 2004 ; Unal et al., 2007 ). This appears to occur by two separate mechanisms: the stabilization of Eco1 ( Figure 6D ) and the phosphorylation of Scc1 by Chk1 ( Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008 ). Either mechanism is sufficient to establish cohesion in metaphase independent of DNA damage signaling ( Figure 6B ) ( Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009 ). Once the mechanism of Eco1 stabilization in damage is elucidated, it will be possible to test whether stabilization, like Scc1 phosphorylation ( Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008 ), is necessary for establishment of damage-induced cohesion. Interestingly, we found that Eco1 is stabilized not only after induction of DSBs, but also following inhibition of DNA replication with hydroxyurea ( Figure 6D ). Perhaps Eco1 stabilization facilitates cohesion establishment upon removal of replication stress.

The substrate of Eco1 during S phase is the Smc3 subunit of cohesin, whereas damage-induced Eco1 activity is thought to target the Scc1 subunit ( Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009 ). It is likely that Eco1-4A also targets Scc1, since the metaphase cohesion that results from ECO1 overexpression depends on lysines in Scc1, not Smc3 ( Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009 ), and does not promote excess Smc3 acetylation ( Borges et al., 2010 ). Mechanisms therefore exist to focus Eco1 activity on Smc3 in S phase and on Scc1 thereafter. The molecular basis of this selectivity is not known, although it seems likely that other factors, such as the replication fork or mitotic chromatin structure, influence the choice of targets. Structural changes in cohesin or cohesin-associated factors throughout the cell cycle are also possible. Interestingly, acetylation of Smc3 in S phase can occur even when Eco1 levels are severely reduced ( Breslow et al., 2008 ) or when replication is delayed until late S phase ( Beckouet et al., 2010 ), possibly due to a high local concentration of Eco1 at the replication fork. Scc1 acetylation, on the other hand, is more sensitive to enzyme concentration, as the degradation promoted by Cdk1 in mitosis is sufficient to prevent cohesion establishment at this stage.

Given that excess cohesion establishment activity is not grossly detrimental to yeast cell viability, why has an intricate system evolved to inhibit it? Since cells establish new genome-wide cohesion upon DNA damage, the cohesion removal system has likely developed a tolerance to some excess cohesion. This could be achieved by an excess of separase activity, for example. Indeed, we found that a reduction in separase activity (the esp1-2 mutation) had little effect on the viability of ECO1-4A cells ( Figure 7A ). However, we did observe defects in ECO1-4A esp1-2 cells delayed in mitosis by the spindle checkpoint, suggesting that separase activity becomes limiting when ECO1-4A cells accumulate too much cohesion during a metaphase delay. Moreover, we observed a loss of sister separation synchrony in ECO1-4A cells that was greatly enhanced when ECO1-4A was combined with a separase mutation. Yeast cells have therefore evolved both an excess of separase activity and a mechanism to temporally inhibit cohesion establishment to ensure robust and efficient cohesion removal at the onset of anaphase.

The regulatory mechanism we uncovered might be conserved in other eukaryotes. Vertebrate homologs of Eco1 are phosphorylated during mitosis ( Hou and Zou, 2005 ; Lafont et al., 2010 ; Olsen et al., 2010 ). The positions of Cdk1 consensus sites are not precisely conserved beyond the most closely related yeasts, but multiple Cdk1 motifs are present at some location in the N-terminus of most homologs. Given that the phosphorylation of Eco1 seems to serve only as an interaction motif for Cdc4, the exact position of the Cdk1 sites would be under less selective pressure to remain fixed through evolution ( Holt et al., 2009 ). If the regulation of cohesion establishment in the cell cycle is conserved, it would be interesting to study the effect of an Eco1 phosphomutant in organisms that use a prophase pathway to remove cohesion from chromosome arms prior to anaphase ( Sumara et al., 2000 ), as these cells may be more sensitive to persistent establishment activity. Additionally, because mutations in human Eco1 homologs have been implicated in certain cancers ( Ryu et al., 2007 ; Luedeke et al., 2009 ), it will also be important to pursue the intriguing possibility that defects in Eco1 regulation generate chromosomal instability and thereby facilitate tumor evolution.

General methods

Yeast strains were derivatives of S288C and are listed in Table S1 , along with a list of plasmid constructs. Genetic manipulations were performed using standard techniques ( Longtine et al., 1998 ). Construction of kinase and phosphatase fusion proteins is described in Figure S1B . Cell cycle arrests were done with 20 μg/ml nocodazole, 10 μg/ml alpha factor, 200 mM hydroxyurea, 2 μM 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, or 33 μg/ml zeocin for 3 h at 30 C unless otherwise stated. All arrests were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content. Protein half-lives were analyzed by addition of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. To inhibit proteasome activity, 100 μM MG132 was added to cells with a PDR5 deletion to increase retention of the drug. For the CDC4 shutoff experiment, cells were grown in YEP media containing 2% raffinose and 0.04% galactose, then treated with nocodazole for 1.5 h before the addition of 2% galactose or dextrose for 4 h to allow for complete turnover of Cdc4. To analyze Eco1 phosphorylation, resolving portions of SDS-PAGE gels were supplemented with 50 μM MnCl 2 and 10 μM Phos-tag reagent ( Kinoshita et al., 2006 ) made using standard chemical techniques, with two-fold excess ammonium persulfate and TEMED.
