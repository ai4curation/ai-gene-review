Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of several neurological disorders 
caused by a CAG repeat expansion. In SCA1, this expansion produces an abnormally 
long polyglutamine tract in the protein ataxin-1. Mutant polyglutamine proteins 
accumulate in neurons, inducing neurodegeneration, but the mechanism underlying 
this accumulation has been unclear. We have discovered that the 14-3-3 protein, 
a multifunctional regulatory molecule, mediates the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 by 
binding to and stabilizing ataxin-1, thereby slowing its normal degradation. The 
association of ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 is regulated by Akt phosphorylation, and in 
a Drosophila model of SCA1, both 14-3-3 and Akt modulate neurodegeneration. Our 
finding that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling and 14-3-3 cooperate to 
modulate the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 provides insight into SCA1 pathogenesis 
and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
