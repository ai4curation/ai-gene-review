We have characterized the Drosophila homologue of the proto-oncogenic RAC 
protein kinase (DRAC-PK). The DRAC-PK gene gives rise to two transcripts with 
the same coding potential, generated by the use of two different polyadenylation 
signals. Each transcript encodes two polypeptides because of the presence of a 
weaker initiator ACG codon, upstream from the major AUG, such that the larger 
protein contains an N-terminal extension. Like the human isoforms, DRAC-PKs 
possess a novel signaling region, the pleckstrin homology domain. DRAC-PK 
proteins have a similar expression pattern, being regulated both maternally and 
zygotically, and are expressed throughout Drosophila development. Antisera 
specific for recombinant DRAC-PK and for its C terminus detected two 
polypeptides of 66 and 85 kDa in Drosophila extracts. The antirecombinant 
antisera also recognized a polypeptide of 120 kDa from Drosophila, which 
apparently shared an epitope related to DRAC-PK sequences. The role of p120 
appears to be restricted compared with that of DRAC-PK, since it was not 
detected in larvae or adult flies. There was no spatial restriction of DRAC-PK 
expression during embryogenesis, suggesting that localized activation might be a 
regulatory mechanism for its function. DRAC-PK possesses an intrinsic kinase 
activity that is approximately 8-fold higher in adult flies than in 0-3-h 
embryos undergoing rapid mitotic cycles.
