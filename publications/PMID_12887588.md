Suppressor of phyA-105 (SPA1) is a phytochrome A-specific signaling intermediate 
that acts as a light-dependent repressor of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis 
seedlings. SPA1 is part of a small gene family comprising three genes: 
SPA1-related 2 (SPA2), SPA1-related 3 (SPA3), and SPA1-related 4 (SPA4). Here, 
we investigate the functions of SPA3 and SPA4, two very closely related genes 
coding for proteins with 74% identical amino acids. Seedlings with mutations in 
SPA3 or SPA4 exhibit enhanced photomorphogenesis in the light, but show no 
phenotype in darkness. While there are small differences between the effects of 
spa3 and spa4 mutations, it is apparent that SPA3 and SPA4 function to inhibit 
light responses in continuous far-red, red, and blue light. Phytochrome A is 
necessary for all aspects of the spa4 mutant phenotype, suggesting that SPA4, 
like SPA1, acts specifically in phytochrome A signaling. Enhanced 
photoresponsiveness of spa3 mutants is also fully dependent on phytochrome A in 
far-red and blue light, but not in red light. Hence, SPA3 function in red light 
may be dependent on other phytochromes in addition to phytochrome A. Using yeast 
two-hybrid and in vitro interaction assays, we further show that SPA3 as well as 
SPA4 can physically interact with the constitutive repressor of light signaling 
COP1. Deletion analyses suggest that SPA3 and SPA4, like SPA1, bind to the 
coiled-coil domain of COP1. Taken together, our results have identified two new 
loci coding for negative regulators that may be involved in fine tuning of light 
responses by interacting with COP1.
