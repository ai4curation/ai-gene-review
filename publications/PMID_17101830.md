OBJECTIVES: To better understand the relationship between mutation of the 
guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) gene and the etiology of DYT5 
dystonia and to accumulate data on the mutation in the Japanese population for 
genetic diagnosis of the disease.
SETTING: Japanese population. Patients Eight Japanese patients with suspected 
DYT5 dystonia were analyzed. Intervention Direct genomic sequencing of 6 exons 
of GCH1 was performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For patients who did not exhibit any abnormality in the 
sequence analysis, the possibility of exon deletions was examined. In cases for 
which cerebrospinal fluid was available, the concentrations of neopterin and 
biopterin were measured as an index of GCH1 enzyme activity.
RESULTS: In 2 patients, we found a new T106I mutation in exon 1 of GCH1, a 
position involved in the helix-turn-helix structure of the enzyme. In the third 
patient, we found a new mutation (a 15-base pair nucleotide deletion) in exon 5 
that may cause a frameshift involving the active site. In the fourth patient, we 
detected a known nucleotide G>A substitution in the splice site of intron 5, 
which has been reported to produce exon 5-skipped messenger RNA. The 
concentrations of both neopterin and biopterin in the cerebrospinal fluid of the 
third and fourth patients were markedly lower than the normal range, indicating 
that the GCH1 enzyme was functionally abnormal in these mutations. Gene dosage 
analysis showed that the fifth patient had a deletion of both exon 3 and exon 4, 
whereas the sixth patient had a deletion of exon 3.
CONCLUSIONS: We found several novel, as well as known, GCH1 mutations in 
Japanese patients with DYT5 dystonia. In some of them, the GCH1 enzyme activity 
was proved to be impaired.
