Introduction

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), 3 a member of the TRP superfamily of cation channels, is a Ca 2+ -permeable channel expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Channel activation allows cation influx into cells, leading to various Ca 2+ -dependent processes ( 1 , 2 ). TRPV4 can be activated by a variety of chemical and physical stimuli such as synthetic phorbol ester 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD) ( 3 ), a botanical agent (bisandrographolide A) ( 4 ), anandamide metabolites including arachidonic acid and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids ( 5 ), hypo-osmotic stimulation ( 6 , 7 ), shear stress ( 8 ), mechanical stretch ( 9 ), and moderate warmth (27–35 °C) ( 7 , 10 ). Therefore, the TRPV4 channel functions as a multimodal transducer in various tissues and cells.

Keratinocytes in the skin epidermis express TRPV4 ( 10 , 11 ), and it has been proposed that the channel is involved in the detection of warm temperature ( 12 ). Skin keratinocytes express another warm temperature-sensitive TRP channel, TRPV3 (activated by temperature above 32 °C), which is also implicated in temperature sensation in mice ( 13 ). Because both TRPV3 and TRPV4 are expressed in keratinocytes and are activated by a similar range of temperatures, these channels likely have distinct functions in the skin. Consistent with this idea, a recent report provided evidence that TRPV3, rather than TRPV4, mainly participates in transmission of warm temperature information from keratinocytes to adjacent nerve endings through ATP release ( 14 ). It has also been reported that mutation of TRPV3 is linked to defective hair growth and dermatitis in rodents ( 15 , 16 ), although the involvement of TRPV4 has not been confirmed.

The skin constitutes an interface between the external environment and the body, serving as a hydrophobic barrier essential for protection against infection from the outside and dehydration from the inside. The skin barrier function is achieved by keratinocytes in the epidermis, which consists of a basal layer and several differentiated layers covered with a cornified layer at the surface. The main barrier function is achieved by a cornified layer-dependent hydrophobic barrier ( 17 ), which is composed of a continuous sheet of protein-enriched cells embedded in an extracellular non-polar lipid layer ( 18 ). In addition to this, a barrier mediated by cell-cell junctions ( 19 ) beneath the cornified layer, including tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs), has recently been highlighted as an essential structure of the skin barrier function ( 20 ). An extensive epidermal water loss was observed in mice lacking claudin-1, the main component of the TJ complex, despite an apparently normal cornified layer function ( 21 ). Moreover, mice lacking E-cadherin specifically in the developing epidermis, the main component of the AJ complex, phenocopied the claudin-1-deficient mice ( 22 ). Thus, proper formation of AJs and TJs is indispensable for the skin barrier function preventing dehydration. In support of this, some skin diseases with barrier disruption are related to AJ and TJ abnormality; lack of extracellular domain of E-cadherin or absence of claudin-1 protein has been reported in Hailey-Hailey disease ( 23 ) or in neonatal ichthyosis and sclerosing cholangitis syndrome ( 24 ), respectively.

The formation of cell-cell junctions in keratinocytes critically depends on rearrangement of actin fibers during the differentiation process ( 25 – 27 ), which can be initiated by an increase in extracellular Ca 2+ (a Ca 2+ switch) in vitro ( 28 ). In fact, the formation of a Ca 2+ gradient in the epidermis has been reported in vivo with higher extracellular and intracellular Ca 2+ levels in the differentiated cell layers ( 28 , 29 ). It has been suggested that some Ca 2+ -permeable TRP channels are involved in keratinocyte differentiation ( 30 , 31 ). However, the contribution of the ion channels to the cell-cell junction formation has not been elucidated. In seeking a potential role of TRPV4 in keratinocytes, we found that the channel interacts with β-catenin and E-cadherin, both of which are basic components of AJs. We investigated the significance of TRPV4 in cell-cell junction development and the integrity of intercellular permeability by comparing skin and primary keratinocytes obtained from wild-type and TRPV4-deficient mice. The involvement of TRPV4 in the increase of intracellular Ca 2+ at physiological skin temperatures and in Rho activation was also examined, both of which are important for regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in skin. Finally, TRPV4 localization and junction structure among keratinocytes were investigated.

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we have provided evidence that the temperature-sensitive TRPV4 channel promotes cell-cell junction formation in skin keratinocytes, thereby regulating intercellular integrity. Many temperature-sensitive TRP channels are now regarded as polymodal receptors in various types of cells, where those channels evoke multiple signals in response to the changes in physiological contexts. TRPV3 and TRPV4 ( 12 , 13 ), both of which are expressed in skin keratinocytes, could have distinct roles because they are activated by a similar range of temperatures in the same type of cells. Indeed, TRPV3 is primarily involved in warm temperature-evoked ATP release from keratinocytes ( 14 ), and its mutation causes abnormality in hair growth and allergic dermatitis in the skin ( 15 , 16 ). On the other hand, we found that TRPV4, but not TRPV3, associates with the AJ complex ( Fig. 1 ). Recent reports that TRPV4 is located in close proximity to the actin cytoskeleton in a human keratinocyte cell line ( 49 , 50 ) strongly support our findings. TRPV4-mediated maturation of intercellular junctions ( Figs. 2 , 3 , and 5 ) is physiologically significant because the skin barrier prevents dehydration and its dysfunction can lead to death. However, unlike the mice lacking claudin-1 or E-cadherin ( 21 , 22 ), TRPV4-deficient mice survive, probably because of the normal expression levels of AJ- and TJ-related proteins ( supplemental Fig. S2 ). The leaky barrier might be masked by compensation, such as the thickened cornified layer observed in TRPV4-deficient mice ( Fig. 2 ). Nevertheless, TRPV4-AJ complex formation may be universally important. TRPV4-mediated functions such as intercellular permeability ( 6 , 7 ), the hypotonic response ( 49 ), and the mechanical stretch response ( 9 ) are directly relevant to cytoskeletal/morphological changes. Thus, our findings would provide a new aspect to clarify the mechanisms of the TRPV4-mediated physiological responses.

There are at least two ways in which TRPV4 might participate in AJ formation. In the first, TRPV4 might simply serve as a scaffold component to stabilize the AJ complex. Because TRP channels are thought to consist of tetramer, TRPV4 can promote clustering of E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes surrounding the channel, which might contribute to augmenting tightness of the cell-cell junction in the skin. In the second, TRPV4 may provide Ca 2+ from the extracellular space, thereby facilitating signaling pathways to enhance junction formation. It has been reported that Rho GTPase, a main regulator of the actin cytoskeleton during keratinocyte differentiation ( 51 ), is activated by increases in [Ca 2+ ] i ( 48 ). The TRPV4-mediated [Ca 2+ ] i increase and prolonged Rho activation in wild-type keratinocytes ( Fig. 4 ), therefore, may support this concept, in which Ca 2+ influx via TRPV4 activates Rho family signaling molecules to augment actin organization and integrity of intercellular junctions. Consistent with this, TRPV4 inhibition by RR resulted in weaker actin fiber formation ( Fig. 3 ). Indeed, there is a good correlation between the time course of changing [Ca 2+ ] i at physiological skin temperature and changing Rho activity and the progress of cell-cell junction formation ( Fig. 3 ) in the two genotypes. Inhibition of Rho A or its effector Rho-activated kinase is sufficient to perturb development of cell-cell contacts in keratinocytes ( 47 ), and Rho-activated kinase reportedly up-regulates Rho E, which is important for cell stratification and whose depletion delays initiation of keratinocyte differentiation ( 52 ). These reports support that TRPV4-induced Rho activation is one of the key elements in the development of cell-cell junctions via actin organization. Further analysis is needed to determine upstream signaling for Ca 2+ -dependent Rho activation. In keratinocytes, [Ca 2+ ] i regulation involving a cytosolic Ca 2+ store is known to be mediated through membrane proteins such as Ca 2+ -sensing receptors ( 53 , 54 ), TRPC1 ( 30 ) and TRPV6 ( 31 ), which may explain a considerable increase in [Ca 2+ ] i in the absence of TRPV4 after a Ca 2+ switch ( Fig. 4 ). However, our results demonstrate that such a [Ca 2+ ] i increase was insufficient to overcome TRPV4 deficiency. Additionally, TRPV3, another possible molecule causing Ca 2+ influx under physiological skin temperature, did not seem to participate in the formation and function of the cell-cell junctions ( Figs. 2 – 5 ). It is tempting to speculate that Ca 2+ influx via TRPV4 plays a specific role in regulating the cell-cell junction formation in the AJ complex, whereas increases in [Ca 2+ ] i via Ca 2+ -sensing receptors, TRPC1 and TRPV6, contributes to expression of differentiation-related genes ( 30 , 31 , 55 ).

One might ask how TRPV4-AJ complex controls the integrity of intercellular junctions. Predominant localization of TRPV4 at the apical side of keratinocytes suggests that TRPV4 must be located in close proximity to the TJ barrier to exert its regulatory roles ( Fig. 5 ). There are evidences that abnormal AJs drastically impair the TJ-dependent barrier ( 22 , 40 ), suggesting that TRPV4 deficiency-induced AJ abnormalities could lead to impaired functionality of the TJ-dependent intercellular barrier. TJs are also regulated by Rho through interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and TJ components ( 56 ). Thus, TRPV4-induced Rho activation possibly strengthens the cell-cell junction barrier as well as actin remodeling. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the mechanisms regulating the spatial distribution of TRPV4. Such information might reveal the general dynamics of the TRPV4-AJ complex.

TRPV4 is reportedly involved in the permeability of epithelial monolayers such that TRPV4 activation increases both transcellular and paracellular conductance in a mouse mammary cell line ( 57 ). In the latter pathway, TRPV4 was proposed to be involved in down-regulation of TJ protein expression. Another report ( 58 ) demonstrated that 4α-PDD increased lung endothelial permeability, which was blocked by RR. The effect of TRPV4 on barrier functions observed in those reports contradicts that obtained in our own study. For instance, expression of cell adhesion-related genes was not significantly altered by TRPV4 deficiency ( supplemental Fig. S2 ), and TRPV4 activation instead increased the integrity of intercellular permeability ( Figs. 2 and 5 ). Both reports, however, utilized 4α-PDD to activate TRPV4, by which we observed the strong side effects on cytoskeletal reorganization and the morphology during the Ca 2+ switch ( supplemental Fig. S6 ), making it difficult to discuss the differences. TRPV4/Ca 2+ -dependent signaling and TJ/AJ barrier structure should be different between monolayered cells used in the previous reports and multilayered keratinocytes in our study. For instance, the [Ca 2+ ] i increase in endothelial cells causes disassembly of VE-cadherin junctions, thereby increasing intercellular permeability ( 59 ). Thus, the molecular mechanisms of TRPV4-regulated barrier integrity may vary depending on the cell, which requires further clarification.

The cell-cell junction-dependent barrier is indispensable for restricting dehydration ( 20 – 22 ). Given that TRPV4 activity can be modulated by skin temperature, we speculate that enhanced TRPV4 activation at high temperature would protect against excess water loss by the barrier enforcement. In contrast, dried skin at cold temperatures might be partially explained by low TRPV4 activity, although there is no direct evidence. Currently, no skin diseases with TRPV4 malfunction have been reported; however, our results thus raise the possibility that manipulating TRPV4 function would be useful to improve skin barrier function, especially where the cornified layer-dependent barrier is damaged. This is supported by recent observations that barrier recovery after disruption of the cornified layer was accelerated by application of warm temperature or a TRPV4 activator, but not by a TRPV3 activator, and that the acceleration was blocked by RR ( 60 ).
