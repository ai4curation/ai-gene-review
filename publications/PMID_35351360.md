Mutations in BRCA1 and BARD1 predispose carriers to breast and ovarian cancers. 
The BRCA1 and BARD1 proteins form a heterodimeric complex (BRCA1/BARD1) that 
regulates many biological processes, including transcription and DNA 
double-stranded break repair. These functions are mediated by the only known 
enzymatic activity of BRCA1/BARD1 in its capacity as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and 
its role as a central hub for many large protein complexes. But the mechanisms 
by which BRCA1/BARD1 interfaces with chromatin, where it exerts its major 
functions, have remained unknown. Here, we review recent advancements in 
structural and cellular biology that have provided critical insights into how 
BRCA1/BARD1 serves as both a nucleosome reader and writer to facilitate 
transcriptional regulation and DNA repair by homologous recombination.

Abstract

Mutations in BRCA1 and BARD1 predispose carriers to breast and ovarian cancers. The BRCA1 and BARD1 proteins form a heterodimeric complex (BRCA1/BARD1) that regulates many biological processes including transcription and DNA double-stranded break repair. These functions are mediated by BRCA1/BARD1’s only known enzymatic function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and its role as a central hub for many large protein complexes. But the mechanisms by which BRCA1/BARD1 interfaces with chromatin, where it exerts its major functions, have remained unknown. Here, we review recent advancements in structural and cellular biology that have provided critical insights into how BRCA1/BARD1 serves as both a nucleosome reader and writer to facilitate transcriptional regulation and DNA repair by homologous recombination.
