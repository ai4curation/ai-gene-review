Internal initiation of translation from the human rhinovirus-2 (HRV-2) internal 
ribosome entry site (IRES) is dependent upon host cell trans-acting factors. The 
multiple cold shock domain protein Unr and the polypyrimidine tract-binding 
protein have been identified as synergistic activators of HRV-2 IRES-driven 
translation. In order to investigate the mechanism by which Unr acts in this 
process, we have mapped the binding sites of Unr to two distinct secondary 
structure domains of the HRV-2 IRES, and have identified specific nucleotides 
that are involved in the binding of Unr to the IRES. The data suggest that Unr 
acts as an RNA chaperone to maintain a complex tertiary IRES structure required 
for translational competency.
