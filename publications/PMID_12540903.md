The PAR-4 and PAR-1 kinases are necessary for the formation of the 
anterior-posterior (A-P) axis in Caenorhabditis elegans. PAR-1 is also required 
for A-P axis determination in Drosophila. Here we show that the Drosophila par-4 
homologue, lkb1, is required for the early A-P polarity of the oocyte, and for 
the repolarization of the oocyte cytoskeleton that defines the embryonic A-P 
axis. LKB1 is phosphorylated by PAR-1 in vitro, and overexpression of LKB1 
partially rescues the par-1 phenotype. These two kinases therefore function in a 
conserved pathway for axis formation in flies and worms. lkb1 mutant clones also 
disrupt apical-basal epithelial polarity, suggesting a general role in cell 
polarization. The human homologue, LKB1, is mutated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome 
and is regulated by prenylation and by phosphorylation by protein kinase A. We 
show that protein kinase A phosphorylates Drosophila LKB1 on a conserved site 
that is important for its activity. Thus, Drosophila and human LKB1 may be 
functional homologues, suggesting that loss of cell polarity may contribute to 
tumour formation in individuals with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
