The protection and efficient restart of stalled replication forks is critical 
for the maintenance of genome integrity. Here, we identify a regulatory pathway 
that promotes stalled forks recovery from replication stress. We show that the 
mammalian replisome component C20orf43/RTF2 (homologous to S. pombe Rtf2) must 
be removed for fork restart to be optimal. We further show that the proteasomal 
shuttle proteins DDI1 and DDI2 are required for RTF2 removal from stalled forks. 
Persistence of RTF2 at stalled forks results in fork restart defects, 
hyperactivation of the DNA damage signal, accumulation of single-stranded DNA 
(ssDNA), sensitivity to replication drugs, and chromosome instability. These 
results establish that RTF2 removal is a key determinant for the ability of 
cells to manage replication stress and maintain genome integrity.
