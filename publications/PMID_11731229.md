FAM is a developmentally regulated substrate-specific deubiquitylating enzyme. 
It binds the cell adhesion and signalling molecules beta-catenin and AF-6 in 
vitro, and stabilises both in mammalian cell culture. To determine if FAM is 
required at the earliest stages of mouse development we examined its expression 
and function in preimplantation mouse embryos. FAM is expressed at all stages of 
preimplantation development from ovulation to implantation. Exposure of two-cell 
embryos to FAM-specific antisense, but not sense, oligodeoxynucleotides resulted 
in depletion of the FAM protein and failure of the embryos to develop to 
blastocysts. Loss of FAM had two physiological effects, namely, a decrease in 
cleavage rate and an inhibition of cell adhesive events. Depletion of FAM 
protein was mirrored by a loss of beta-catenin such that very little of either 
protein remained following 72h culture. The residual beta-catenin was localised 
to sites of cell-cell contact suggesting that the cytoplasmic pool of 
beta-catenin is stabilised by FAM. Although AF-6 levels initially decreased they 
returned to normal. However, the nascent protein was mislocalised at the apical 
surface of blastomeres. Therefore FAM is required for preimplantation mouse 
embryo development and regulates beta-catenin and AF-6 in vivo.
