Myc expression is deregulated in many human cancers. A yeast two-hybrid screen 
has revealed that the transcriptional repressor Sin3b interacts with Myc 
protein. Endogenous Myc and Sin3b co-localize and interact in the nuclei of 
human and rat cells, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, 
and proximity ligation assay. The interaction is Max-independent. A conserved 
Myc region (amino acids 186-203) is required for the interaction with Sin3 
proteins. Histone deacetylase 1 is recruited to Myc-Sin3b complexes, and its 
deacetylase activity is required for the effects of Sin3b on Myc. Myc and 
Sin3a/b co-occupied many sites on the chromatin of human leukemia cells, 
although the presence of Sin3 was not associated with gene down-regulation. In 
leukemia cells and fibroblasts, Sin3b silencing led to Myc up-regulation, 
whereas Sin3b overexpression induced Myc deacetylation and degradation. An 
analysis of Sin3b expression in breast tumors revealed an association between 
low Sin3b expression and disease progression. The data suggest that Sin3b 
decreases Myc protein levels upon Myc deacetylation. As Sin3b is also required 
for transcriptional repression by Mxd-Max complexes, our results suggest that, 
at least in some cell types, Sin3b limits Myc activity through two complementary 
activities: Mxd-dependent gene repression and reduction of Myc levels.

Abstract

Myc expression is deregulated in many human cancers. A yeast two-hybrid screen has revealed that the transcriptional repressor Sin3b interacts with Myc protein. Endogenous Myc and Sin3b co-localize and interact in the nuclei of human and rat cells, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and proximity ligation assay. The interaction is Max-independent. A conserved Myc region (amino acids 186–203) is required for the interaction with Sin3 proteins. Histone deacetylase 1 is recruited to Myc-Sin3b complexes, and its deacetylase activity is required for the effects of Sin3b on Myc. Myc and Sin3a/b co-occupied many sites on the chromatin of human leukemia cells, although the presence of Sin3 was not associated with gene down-regulation. In leukemia cells and fibroblasts, Sin3b silencing led to Myc up-regulation, whereas Sin3b overexpression induced Myc deacetylation and degradation. An analysis of Sin3b expression in breast tumors revealed an association between low Sin3b expression and disease progression. The data suggest that Sin3b decreases Myc protein levels upon Myc deacetylation. As Sin3b is also required for transcriptional repression by Mxd-Max complexes, our results suggest that, at least in some cell types, Sin3b limits Myc activity through two complementary activities: Mxd-dependent gene repression and reduction of Myc levels.

Introduction

c-Myc (hereafter Myc) is an oncogenic transcription factor of the helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein family. Myc forms heterodimers with the protein Max, which bind to DNA sequences called E-boxes ( 1 – 3 ). Myc-Max regulates thousands of genes and binds to about 15% of genomic loci. Most target genes are activated by Myc in an E-box-dependent manner, although an important fraction of Myc target genes are repressed ( 4 – 7 ). Recent developments suggest that Myc functions as an amplifier of active genes ( 8 , 9 ) Myc activates transcription by recruiting a multiprotein complex that includes histone acetyltransferases ( 2 , 10 , 11 ). In agreement with its large number of target genes, Myc exerts a wide array of biological functions including cell cycle control, genomic instability, energetic metabolism, protein synthesis, intercellular communication, and control of cell differentiation ( 1 , 10 , 12 , 13 ). Myc is deregulated in about half of human tumors and frequently appears to be associated with tumor progression ( 14 – 16 ).

Myc transcriptional activity is also controlled by several competing repressive Max-binding partners of the Mxd family (Mxd1, Mxi1, Mxd3, Mxd4, and Mnt). Mxd-Max dimers are biochemical antagonists of Myc-Max, i.e. they repress gene expression upon binding to E-boxes in the regulatory regions of the target genes ( 17 , 18 ). Mxd-Max heterodimers repress transcription by recruiting Sin3a and Sin3b. Sin3 originally was discovered in yeasts as an essential component of transcriptional regulatory complexes containing multiple components ( 19 , 20 ). Mammalian Sin3 proteins were discovered as interactors of Mxd proteins, which carry a conserved Sin3-interacting domain (SID) in their N-terminal region ( 21 – 24 ). Sin3-Mxd interaction takes place through the paired amphipathic helices (PAH) 5 of the Sin3a/b C-terminal region and is required for the transcriptional repression exerted by Mxd proteins on their target genes ( 22 , 25 – 27 ). The mechanism through which Sin3b represses transcription involves the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) types 1 and 2 ( 28 – 30 ). Sin3-containing complexes, besides HDAC1 and HDAC2, contain other proteins to form a transcription regulatory complex (reviewed in Refs. 19 , 29 , and 31 ). Compared with Sin3a interactions, much less is known about Sin3b interactions. There are differences in the protein interactions described for each Sin3 family member ( 32 – 35 ) and the phenotypes of Sin3a- and Sin3b-deficient mice, with the Sin3a knock-out mice showing an earlier lethality than Sin3b knock-out mice ( 35 ). Here we show an interaction between Myc and Sin3b that results in impaired Myc transcriptional activity. The Myc region involved in the interaction is a small conserved region (Myc box III). Myc-Sin3b interaction leads to Myc deacetylation and destabilization, and co-expression of Sin3b leads to reduced Myc levels.

DISCUSSION

We have described here a direct interaction between Myc and the transcriptional corepressor Sin3b. We initially discovered this interaction by yeast two-hybrid screening. Furthermore, Myc and Sin3b co-immunoprecipitated in human HEK293T and rat UR61 cells upon transfection of expression vectors. Endogenous Myc and Sin3b also interacted in K562 cells, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation and isPLA. Moreover, we also detected the interaction of Sin3b with purified recombinant Myc, and we confirmed this interaction using purified Myc protein and a purified fusion Sin3b protein consisting of GST and the N-terminal region of Sin3b. Interestingly, in a previous report on two-hybrid screen designed to search Sin3b interacting peptides, two interacting peptides were found with a sequence similar to Myc Box III ( 55 ) (not shown). Although Sin3a did not appear in our initial two-hybrid screen, Sin3a also co-immunoprecipitated with Myc in cells and exerted the same effects on Myc-dependent transcription as did Sin3b. We also showed that Sin3b and Myc bind to the same promoter regions. Also, the genome-wide ChIP-seq data available in the UCSC genome browser reveal that Sin3a and Myc co-localize in a relevant fraction of chromatin sites. Taken together, the data strongly argue in favor of a direct interaction between Myc and Sin3b.

The Sin3b region found in the two-hybrid positive clone corresponds to amino acids 5–194, encompassing most of the PAH1 and PAH2 domains (amino acids 30–230). Myc mutational analysis showed that the Sin3b-interacting region includes amino acids 186–203. This region essentially corresponds to the conserved Myc Box III ( 56 ). Interestingly, Max is not required for Sin3b binding to Myc, and Sin3b impaired Myc transcriptional activity on E-box-carrying promoters. However, Sin3b and Sin3a showed no effect on the transactivation mediated by the Myc mutant lacking the region required for Sin3 interaction (amino acids 186–203).

It has been reported that Myc represses some genes through the recruitment of HDACs and that Myc Box III is required for this activity ( 57 ). We found that the Myc region involved in this repression was the same region required for Sin3b and Sin3a binding. Therefore, we propose that Sin3 mediates the interaction of Myc with HDAC1, although interaction with other protein deacetylases cannot be ruled out. This proposal is based on these findings: ( a ) the co-expression of HDAC and Sin3b enhanced the repressive effect on E-box-containing reporters; ( b ) HDAC inhibitors ( e.g. TSA and vorinostat) impaired the effect of Sin3b on Myc-mediated transcription; and ( c ) overexpression of HDAC alone did not modify Myc transcriptional activity. Therefore, Sin3b acts as a negative modulator of Myc transcriptional activity.

Several concomitant mechanisms could explain the repression of Myc activities by Sin3b. One would be the recruitment of Mxd protein to the promoter to exert transcriptional repression. This model is depicted in Fig. 11 A . Although this mechanism must operate in vivo , by itself it cannot explain our results, as the D186–203 Myc mutant did not interact with Sin3b and yet transactivated an E-box reporter even when Sin3b was co-expressed. Thus, the increase in Mxd-Sin3b-HDAC complexes on chromatin was not the main mechanism responsible for the diminished transcriptional activity of Myc in the presence of Sin3b.

A second explanation would be that the effect of Sin3b depends on histone deacetylation in the regulatory region of Myc-bound genes, leading to transcription repression (schematized in Fig. 11 B ). However, our ChIP results argue against this hypothesis as the major mechanism. In human leukemia cells, we found that both Myc and Sin3b bound to some promoters regardless of whether the gene was induced or repressed ( Fig. 7 ), and Sin3b binding at these sites was not related to histone acetylation marks ( 48 ). Also, the combined analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data generated by the ENCODE consortium revealed that in K562 cells, the coincidence of Myc and Sin3a on the proximal promoters did not correlate with a lower expression with respect to genes with Myc alone ( Fig. 8 ). Thus, our data do not support a direct role of Sin3b in transcriptional repression of Myc target genes. Given that the binding of Myc and Sin3b to chromatin can be transient, we cannot rule out an effect of Sin3b binding to Myc that leads to gene repression via histone deacetylation. Actually, Myc-mediated repression of some genes ( e.g. GADD45 and ID2 ) in Rat1a cells was impaired by co-transfection of Sin3b siRNA (not shown). However, taken together, the ChIP data are not consistent with this mechanism being the major one responsible for the decrease in Myc activity when Sin3b is co-expressed.

A third explanation is that Sin3b leads to reduced Myc levels. It is reported that Sin3a induces Myc deacetylation ( 53 ), and we have confirmed the same effect for Sin3b. Although the underlying mechanisms are not clear yet, it has been reported that acetylation of Myc by acetyltransferases ( e.g. GCN5, Tip60, and p300/CBP) usually results in an increase in protein stability ( 49 – 53 ), although Myc deacetylation by Sirt1 results in increased stability ( 52 ). We showed that Sin3b decreased Myc levels, whereas Sin3b depletion augmented Myc levels. The simplest explanation is that Sin3b interaction contributes to Myc deacetylation leading to reduced Myc levels, as schematized in Fig. 11 C . In agreement with the findings in cultured cells, we also found an association between high Sin3b and low Myc in human breast cancer samples (although the data were not statistically significant). In summary, the data suggest that, at least in some cell types, Sin3b controls Myc levels through a mechanism that involves protein deacetylation and destabilization. Further work is required to dissect the underlying mechanisms. On the other hand, transcriptional repression by Mxd of Myc target genes can also be mediated by Sin3b. Thus, Sin3b may reduce Myc activity through two parallel pathways: the canonical Sin3b-Mxd interaction, resulting in Myc target gene repression, and the reduction of Myc levels, as shown in this work. The effect of Sin3b on Myc activity opens possibilities of therapeutic intervention for Myc-driven tumors.
