Members of the P(4) family of P-type ATPases (P(4)-ATPases) are believed to 
function as phospholipid flippases in complex with CDC50 proteins. Mutations in 
the human class 1 P(4)-ATPase gene ATP8B1 cause a severe syndrome characterized 
by impaired bile flow (intrahepatic cholestasis), often leading to end-stage 
liver failure in childhood. In this study, we determined the specificity of 
human class 1 P(4)-ATPase interactions with CDC50 proteins and the functional 
consequences of these interactions on protein abundance and localization of both 
protein classes. ATP8B1 and ATP8B2 co-immunoprecipitated with CDC50A and CDC50B, 
whereas ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2 associated only with CDC50A. ATP8B1 shifted 
from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane upon coexpression of 
CDC50A or CDC50B. ATP8A1 and ATP8A2 translocated from the ER to the Golgi 
complex and plasma membrane upon coexpression of CDC50A, but not CDC50B. ATP8B2 
and ATP8B4 already displayed partial plasma membrane localization in the absence 
of CDC50 coexpression but displayed a large increase in plasma membrane 
abundance upon coexpression of CDC50A. ATP8B3 did not bind CDC50A and CDC50B and 
was invariably present in the ER. Our data show that interactions between CDC50 
proteins and class 1 P(4)-ATPases are essential for ER exit and stability of 
both subunits. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of the complex is 
determined by the P(4)-ATPase, not the CDC50 protein. The interactions of CDC50A 
and CDC50B with multiple members of the human P(4)-ATPase family suggest that 
these proteins perform broader functions in human physiology than thus far 
assumed.
