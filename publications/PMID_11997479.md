The essential, rapamycin-sensitive TOR kinases regulate a diverse set of cell 
growth-related readouts in response to nutrients. Thus, the yeast TOR proteins 
function as nutrient sensors, in particular as sensors of nitrogen and possibly 
carbon. However, the nutrient metabolite(s) that acts upstream of TOR is 
unknown. We investigated the role of glutamine, a preferred nitrogen source and 
a key intermediate in yeast nitrogen metabolism, as a possible regulator of TOR. 
We show that the glutamine synthetase inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine (MSX) 
specifically provokes glutamine depletion in yeast cells. MSX-induced glutamine 
starvation caused nuclear localization and activation of the TOR-inhibited 
transcription factors GLN3, RTG1, and RTG3, all of which mediate glutamine 
synthesis. The MSX-induced nuclear localization of GLN3 required the 
TOR-controlled, type 2A-related phosphatase SIT4. Other TOR-controlled 
transcription factors, GAT1/NIL1, MSN2, MSN4, and an unknown factor involved in 
the expression of ribosomal protein genes, were not affected by glutamine 
starvation. These findings suggest that the TOR pathway senses glutamine. 
Furthermore, as glutamine starvation affects only a subset of TOR-controlled 
transcription factors, TOR appears to discriminate between different nutrient 
conditions to elicit a response appropriate to a given condition.
