Signaling for cell death by Fas/APO1 occurs via a distinct region in its 
intracellular domain. This region contains a conserved sequence motif, the death 
domain motif, that is also found in the intracellular domains of the p55 tumor 
necrosis factor receptor and the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor, as 
well as in the regulatory domain of the ankyrins. A novel protein that 
specifically binds to the death domain of Fas/APO1 but not to Fas/APO1 molecules 
with a loss of function point mutation occurring in lprcg mice was cloned by a 
two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cells' cDNA library. The cloned protein itself 
contains a death domain motif, and this region binds to the death domain of 
Fas/APO1, while the region upstream to the death domain prompts self-association 
of the protein. Induced expression of the protein results in ligand-independent 
triggering of cytotoxicity, suggesting that it is involved in cell death 
induction by Fas/APO1.
