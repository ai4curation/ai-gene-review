Wilm's tumor protein 1 (WT1), a protein implicated in various cancers and 
developmental disorders, consists of two major isoforms: WT1(-KTS), a 
transcription factor, and WT1(+KTS), a post-transcriptional regulator that binds 
to RNA and can interact with splicing components. Here we show that WT1 
interacts with the novel splicing regulator RBM4. Each protein was found to 
colocalize in nuclear speckles and to cosediment with supraspliceosomes in 
glycerol gradients. RBM4 conferred dose-dependent and cell-specific regulation 
of alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs transcribed from several reporter genes. We 
found that overexpressed WT1(+KTS) abrogated this effect of RBM4 on splice-site 
selection, whereas WT1(-KTS) did not. We conclude that the (+KTS) form of WT1 is 
able to inhibit the effect of RBM4 on alternative splicing.
