In cellular respiration, cytochrome c transfers electrons from cytochrome bc(1) 
complex (complex III) to cytochrome c oxidase by transiently binding to the 
membrane proteins. Here, we report the structure of isoform-1 cytochrome c bound 
to cytochrome bc(1) complex at 1.9 A resolution in reduced state. The dimer 
structure is asymmetric. Monovalent cytochrome c binding is correlated with 
conformational changes of the Rieske head domain and subunit QCR6p and with a 
higher number of interfacial water molecules bound to cytochrome c(1). 
Pronounced hydration and a "mobility mismatch" at the interface with disordered 
charged residues on the cytochrome c side are favorable for transient binding. 
Within the hydrophobic interface, a minimal core was identified by comparison 
with the novel structure of the complex with bound isoform-2 cytochrome c. Four 
core interactions encircle the heme cofactors surrounded by variable 
interactions. The core interface may be a feature to gain specificity for 
formation of the reactive complex.
