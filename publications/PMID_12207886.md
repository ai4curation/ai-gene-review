TBP-interacting protein 120 (TIP120) has been identified by TBP-mediated 
affinity screening. Classical TIP120, TIP120A, which functions as a 
transcriptional activator, is expressed ubiquitously whereas TIP120B is 
specifically expressed in muscle tissues. We found that TIP120B gene was induced 
in C2C12 myoblasts when these cells differentiated into myotubes, whereas 
TIP120A gene expression was down-regulated. Whole-mount in situ hybridization 
revealed that TIP120B mRNA was concentrated in limb buds of mouse embryos. 
TIP120B is thus thought to be a myogenesis-responding gene. We searched for 
TIP120B-binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening and identified NOT3. 
NOT3, a constituent of CCR4-NOT complex, is suggested to be involved in global 
gene regulation via interaction with TBP. The human NOT3 (hNOT3L), which we 
identified, has an extra 144 amino acids (AAs) at the C-terminus of a classical 
NOT3. GST pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that hNOT3L is 
associated with TIP120B but not with TIP120A. A hNOT3L-specific C-terminal 
region of 92 AAs was assigned as a TIP120B-interacting domain. The N-terminus of 
209 AAs of TIP120B was responsible for this binding. TIP120B presumably affects 
tissue-specific transcriptional regulation via interaction with NOT3.
