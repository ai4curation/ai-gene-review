Interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, interleukin-11, 
and ciliary neurotrophic factor bind to receptor complexes that share the signal 
transducer gp130. Upon binding, the ligands rapidly activate DNA binding of 
acute-phase response factor (APRF), a protein antigenically related to the p91 
subunit of the interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 alpha (ISGF-3 alpha). These 
cytokines caused tyrosine phosphorylation of APRF and ISGF-3 alpha p91. Protein 
kinases of the Jak family were also rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated, and both 
APRF and Jak1 associated with gp130. These data indicate that Jak family protein 
kinases may participate in IL-6 signaling and that APRF may be activated in a 
complex with gp130.
