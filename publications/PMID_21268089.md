PPARs and LXRs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are emerging as 
promising therapeutic targets for limiting atherosclerosis, an inflammatory 
disorder orchestrated by cytokines. The potent anti-atherogenic actions of these 
nuclear receptors involve the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism along 
with attenuation of the inflammatory response. Similarly, cholesterol-lowering 
drugs, statins, inhibit inflammation. Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying 
such inhibitory actions of these agents in human macrophages are poorly 
understood and were therefore investigated in relation to IFN-γ, a key 
pro-atherogenic cytokine, which mediates its cellular effects mainly through 
STAT1. Simvastatin and PPAR agonists had no effect on the IFN-γ-induced, 
phosphorylation-mediated activation of STAT1 and its DNA binding but attenuated 
its ability to activate gene transcription. On the other hand, LXR activators 
attenuated both DNA binding and trans-activation potential of STAT1 induced by 
IFN-γ. These studies reveal differences in the mechanism of action of agonists 
of PPARs (and simvastatin) and LXRs on the IFN-γ-induced, STAT1-mediated gene 
transcription in human macrophages.
