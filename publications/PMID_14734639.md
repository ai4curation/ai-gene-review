Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are involved in protein folding, transport and stress 
resistance. Studies reporting an increased mRNA level of hsp genes in aged 
Drosophila suggest that expression of Hsp might be beneficial in preventing 
damages induced by aging. Because oxidative damage is often observed in aged 
organisms and mitochondria are sensitive to reactive oxygen species, we tested 
the hypothesis that increased levels of a small Hsp localized in mitochondria, 
Hsp22 of Drosophila melanogaster, could protect mitochondrial proteins and 
influence the aging process. We demonstrate that a ubiquitous or a targeted 
expression of Hsp22 within motorneurons increases the mean life span by more 
than 30%. Hsp22 shows beneficial effects on early-aging events since the 
premortality phase displays the same increase as the mean lifespan. Moreover, 
flies expressing Hsp22 in their motorneurons maintain their locomotor activity 
longer as assessed by a negative geotaxis assay. The motorneurons-targeted 
expression of Hsp22 also significantly increases flies' resistance to oxidative 
injuries induced by paraquat (up to 35%) and thermal stress (39% at 30 degrees C 
and 23% at 37 degrees C). These observations establish Hsp22 as a key player in 
cell-protection mechanisms against oxidative injuries and aging in Drosophila 
and corroborate the pivotal role of mitochondria in the process of aging.
