The bcl-2 proto-oncogene can prevent the death of many cell types. Mice were 
generated that were chimeric for the homozygous inactivation of bcl-2. 
Lymphocytes without Bcl-2 differentiated into phenotypically mature cells. 
However, in vitro, the mature T cells that lacked Bcl-2 had shorter life-spans 
and increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids and gamma-irradiation. In contrast, 
stimulation of CD3 inhibited the death of these cells. T and B cells with no 
Bcl-2 disappeared from the bone marrow, thymus, and periphery by 4 weeks of age. 
Thus, Bcl-2 was dispensable for lymphocyte maturation, but was required for a 
stable immune system after birth.
