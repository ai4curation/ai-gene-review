Members of the conserved Hsp70 chaperone family are assumed to constitute a main 
cellular system for the prevention and the amelioration of stress-induced 
protein damage, though little direct evidence exists for this function. We 
investigated the roles of the DnaK (Hsp70), DnaJ and GrpE chaperones of 
Escherichia coli in prevention and repair of thermally induced protein damage 
using firefly luciferase as a test substrate. In vivo, luciferase was rapidly 
inactivated at 42 degrees C, but was efficiently reactivated to 50% of its 
initial activity during subsequent incubation at 30 degrees C. DnaK, DnaJ and 
GrpE did not prevent luciferase inactivation, but were essential for its 
reactivation. In vitro, reactivation of heat-inactivated luciferase to 80% of 
its initial activity required the combined activity of DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE as 
well as ATP, but not GroEL and GroES. DnaJ associated with denatured luciferase, 
targeted DnaK to the substrate and co-operated with DnaK to prevent luciferase 
aggregation at 42 degrees C, an activity that was required for subsequent 
reactivation. The protein repair function of DnaK, GrpE and, in particular, DnaJ 
is likely to be part of the role of these proteins in regulation of the heat 
shock response.
