Coimmunoprecipitation of members of the phytochrome red/farred photoreceptor 
family from plant extracts has been used to analyze their heteromeric binding 
interactions. Phytochrome (phy)B or phyD apoproteins with six myc epitopes fused 
to their N termini are biologically active when expressed in Arabidopsis. 
Immunoprecipitation of either of these tagged proteins from seedling extracts 
coprecipitates additional type II phytochromes: six myc (myc6)-phyB 
coprecipitates phyC-phyE; and myc6-phyD coprecipitates phyB and phyE. No 
interaction of the epitope-tagged proteins with type I phyA was detected. Gel 
filtration chromatography shows that all five of the Arabidopsis phytochromes 
are present in seedlings as dimers, and that the heteromeric type II phytochrome 
complexes migrate at molecular masses characteristic of heterodimers. Similar 
levels of heterodimer formation are observed in extracts of dark-grown 
seedlings, where the phytochromes are cytosolic, and light-grown seedlings, 
where they are predominantly nuclear. These findings indicate that Arabidopsis, 
which until now has been thought to contain five homodimeric forms of 
phytochrome, in fact contains multiple species of both homodimeric and 
heterodimeric phytochromes. The conservation of the phytochrome family 
throughout angiosperms suggests that heterodimeric red/far-red receptors may be 
present in many flowering plants.
