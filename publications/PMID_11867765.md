Hsp104 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a hexameric protein with two AAA ATPase 
domains (N- and C-terminal nucleotide-binding domains NBD1 and NBD2, 
respectively) per monomer. Our previous analysis of the Hsp104 ATP hydrolysis 
cycle revealed that NBD1 and NBD2 have very different catalytic properties, but 
each shows positive cooperativity in hydrolysis. There is also communication 
between the two domains, in that ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 depends on the 
nucleotide that is bound to NBD2. Here, we extend our understanding of the 
Hsp104 ATP hydrolysis cycle through mutagenesis of the AAA sensor-2 motif in 
NBD2. To do so, we took advantage of the lack of tryptophan residues in Hsp104 
to place a single tryptophan in the C-terminal domain (Y819W). The Y819W 
substitution has no significant effects on folding stability of the C-terminal 
domain or on ATP hydrolysis by NBD1 or NBD2. The fluorescence of this tryptophan 
changes in response to ATP and ADP binding, allowing the K(d) and Hill 
coefficient to be determined for each nucleotide. By using this site-specific 
probe of binding, we analyze the effect of mutating the conserved arginine 
residue in the sensor-2 motif in Hsp104 NBD2. An R826M mutation causes nearly 
equal decreases in affinity of NBD2 for both ATP and ADP, indicating that at 
this site, the sensor-2 provides binding energy, but does not act to sense the 
difference between these nucleotides. In addition, the rate of ATP hydrolysis at 
NBD1 is decreased by the R826M mutation, providing further evidence for 
interdomain communication in the Hsp104 ATP hydrolysis cycle.
