Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been identified as a causative gene for 
Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 contains a kinase and a GTPase domain, both of 
which provide critical intracellular signal-transduction functions. We showed 
previously that Rab5b, a small GTPase protein that regulates the motility and 
fusion of early endosomes, interacts with LRRK2 and co-regulates synaptic 
vesicle endocytosis. Using recombinant proteins, we show here that LRRK2 
phosphorylates Rab5b at its Thr6 residue in in vitro kinase assays with mass 
spectrophotometry analysis. Phosphorylation of Rab5b by LRRK2 on the threonine 
residue was confirmed by western analysis using cells stably expressing LRRK2 
G2019S. The phosphomimetic T6D mutant exhibited stronger GTPase activity than 
that of the wild-type Rab5b. In addition, phosphorylation of Rab5b by LRRK2 also 
exhibited GTPase activity stronger than that of the unphosphorylated Rab5b 
protein. Two assays testing Rab5's activity, neurite outgrowth analysis and 
epidermal growth factor receptor degradation assays, showed that Rab5b T6D 
exhibited phenotypes that were expected to be observed in the inactive Rab5b, 
including longer neurite length and less degradation of EGFR. These results 
suggest that LRRK2 kinase activity functions as a Rab5b GTPase activating 
protein and thus, negatively regulates Rab5b signalling.
