The human thiamine transporter-1 (hTHTR-1) contributes to intestinal thiamine 
uptake, and its function is regulated at both the transcriptional and 
posttranscriptional levels. Nothing, however, is known about the protein(s) that 
may interact with hTHTR-1 and affects its cell biology and physiology. We 
addressed this issue in the present investigation using a bacterial two-hybrid 
system to screen a human intestinal cDNA library with the complete coding 
sequence of hTHTR-1 as a bait. Our results showed that a member of the 
tetraspanin family of proteins, Tspan-1, interacts with hTHTR-1. 
Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pulldown assays 
confirmed the existence of such an interaction between hTspan-1 and hTHTR-1 in 
human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, live cell confocal 
imaging demonstrated that hTspan-1 and hTHTR-1 colocalize in human intestinal 
epithelial HuTu-80 cells. The importance of the interaction between hTspan-1 and 
hTHTR-1 for cell biology of the thiamine transporter was examined in HuTu-80 
cells stably expressing hTHTR-1. Coexpression of hTspan-1 in these cells led to 
a significant decrease in the rate of degradation of hTHTR-1 compared with cells 
expressing the hTHTR-1 alone; in fact the half-life of the hTHTR-1 protein was 
twice longer in the former cell type compared with the latter cell type (12 h 
vs. 6 h, respectively). This finding was also confirmed at the functional level 
when a significantly higher thiamine uptake was observed in 
cycloheximide-treated (6 h) cells expressing hTHTR-1 together with hTspan-1 
compared with those expressing hTHTR-1 alone. These studies demonstrate for the 
first time that Tspan-1 is an interacting partner with hTHTR-1 and that this 
interaction affects hTHTR-1 stability.
