EHD1 has been implicated in the recycling of internalized proteins to the plasma 
membrane. However, the mechanism by which EHD1 mediates recycling and its 
relationship to Rab-family-controlled events has yet to be established. To 
investigate further the mode of EHD1 action, we sought to identify novel 
interacting partners. GST-EHD1 was used as bait to isolate a approximately 
120-kDa species from bovine and murine brain cytosol, which was identified by 
mass spectrometry as the divalent Rab4/Rab5 effector Rabenosyn-5. We mapped the 
sites of interaction to the EH domain of EHD1, and the first two of five NPF 
motifs of Rabenosyn-5. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies revealed that EHD1 
and Rabenosyn-5 partially colocalize to vesicular and tubular structures in 
vivo. To address the functional roles of EHD1 and Rabenosyn-5, we first 
demonstrated that RNA interference (RNAi) dramatically reduced the level of 
expression of each protein, either individually or in combination. Depletion of 
either EHD1 or Rabenosyn-5 delayed the recycling of transferrin and major 
histocompatibility complex class I to the plasma membrane. However, whereas 
depletion of EHD1 caused the accumulation of internalized cargo in a compact 
juxtanuclear compartment, Rabenosyn-5-RNAi caused its retention within a 
dispersed peripheral compartment. Simultaneous RNAi depletion of both proteins 
resulted in a similar phenotype to that observed with Rabenosyn-5-RNAi alone, 
suggesting that Rabenosyn-5 acts before EHD1 in the regulation of endocytic 
recycling. Our studies suggest that Rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 act sequentially in the 
transport of proteins from early endosomes to the endosomal recycling 
compartment and back to the plasma membrane.
