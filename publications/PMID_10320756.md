Differentiation of the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction 
requires agrin, a nerve-derived signal; MuSK, a critical component of the agrin 
receptor in muscle; and rapsyn, a protein that interacts with acetylcholine 
receptors (AChRs). We showed previously that nerve-induced AChR aggregation is 
dramatically impaired in knockout mice lacking agrin, MuSK, or rapsyn. However, 
the phenotypes of these mutants differed in several respects, suggesting that 
the pathway from agrin to MuSK to rapsyn is complex. Here, we compared the 
effects of these mutations on two aspects of synaptic differentiation: AChR 
clustering and transcriptional specialization of synapse-associated myonuclei. 
First, we show that a plant lectin, VVA-B4, previously shown to act downstream 
of agrin, can induce AChR clusters on MuSK-deficient but not rapsyn-deficient 
myotubes in culture. Thus, although both MuSK and rapsyn are required for AChR 
clustering in vivo, only rapsyn is essential for cluster formation per se. 
Second, we show that neuregulin, a nerve-derived inducer of AChR gene 
expression, activates AChR gene expression in cultured agrin- and MuSK-deficient 
myotubes, even though synapse-specific transcriptional specialization is 
disrupted in agrin and MuSK mutants in vivo. We propose that agrin works through 
MuSK to determine a synaptogenic region within which synaptic differentiation 
occurs.
