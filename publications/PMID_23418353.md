Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in 
internalization and ubiquitin-dependent endosomal sorting, leading to lysosomal 
degradation. Here we describe the role of the RING-finger-domain-containing 
protein RNF126 and the related protein, Rabring7 in EGFR endosomal sorting. We 
demonstrate that RNF126 specifies K48-linked chains with UbcH5b and also 
functions with Ubc13/Uev1a to form K63-linked chains in vitro. RNF126 and 
Rabring7 associate with the EGFR through a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger domain 
and both E3 ubiquitin ligases promote ubiquitylation of EGFR. In the absence of 
c-Cbl or in cells expressing Cbl-70Z, the binding of RNF126 and Rabring7 to the 
EGFR is reduced, suggesting that RNF126 and Rabring7 function downstream of 
c-Cbl. In HeLa cells depleted of either RNF126 or Rabring7 the EGFR is retained 
in a late endocytic compartment and is inefficiently degraded. In addition, 
depletion of RNF126 or Rabring7 destabilizes ESCRT-II and reduces the number of 
multivesicular bodies formed after EGF stimulation. We also show that the 
depletion of Rabring7 attenuates the degradation of MET and that both RNF126 and 
Rabring7 regulate the sorting of CXCR4 from an early endocytic compartment. 
Together these data suggest that RNF126 and Rabring7 play a role in the 
ubiquitin-dependent sorting and downregulation of membrane receptors.
