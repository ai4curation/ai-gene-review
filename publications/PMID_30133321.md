Starvation significantly alters cellular physiology, and signs of aging have 
been reported to occur during starvation. Mitochondria are essential to the 
regulation of cellular energetics and aging. We sought to determine whether 
mitochondria exhibit signs of aging during starvation and whether quality 
control mechanisms regulate mitochondrial physiology during starvation. We 
describe effects of starvation on mitochondria in the first and third larval 
stages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. When starved, C. elegans larvae 
enter developmental arrest. We observed fragmentation of the mitochondrial 
network, a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, and accumulation 
of DNA damage during starvation-induced developmental arrest. Mitochondrial 
function was also compromised by starvation. Starved worms had lower basal, 
maximal, and ATP-linked respiration. These observations are consistent with 
reduced mitochondrial quality, similar to mitochondrial phenotypes during aging. 
Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that worms deficient for 
autophagy were short-lived during starvation and recovered poorly from extended 
starvation, indicating sensitivity to nutrient stress. Autophagy mutants 
unc-51/Atg1 and atg-18/Atg18 maintained greater mtDNA content than wild-type 
worms during starvation, suggesting that autophagy promotes mitochondrial 
degradation during starvation. unc-51 mutants also had a proportionally smaller 
reduction in oxygen consumption rate during starvation, suggesting that 
autophagy also contributes to reduced mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, 
mutations in genes involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion as well as 
selective mitophagy of damaged mitochondria did not affect mitochondrial content 
during starvation. Our results demonstrate the profound influence of starvation 
on mitochondrial physiology with organismal consequences, and they show that 
these physiological effects are influenced by autophagy.
