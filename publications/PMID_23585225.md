Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors were initially developed as anticancer 
agents; however, it is becoming increasing clear that they also possess potent 
anti-inflammatory properties. Posttranslational modifications of Hsp90 have been 
reported in tumors and have been hypothesized to affect client protein- and 
inhibitor-binding activities. In the present study we investigated the 
posttranslational modification of Hsp90 in inflammation. LPS, a prototypical 
inflammatory agent, induced concentration- and time-dependent tyrosine (Y) 
phosphorylation of Hsp90α and Hsp90β in bovine pulmonary arterial and human lung 
microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). Mass spectrometry identified Y309 as a 
major site of Y phosphorylation on Hsp90α (Y300 of Hsp90β). LPS-induced Hsp90 
phosphorylation was prevented by the Hsp90 inhibitor 
17-allyl-amino-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG) in vitro as well as in lungs from 
LPS-treated mice, in vivo. Furthermore, 17-AAG prevented LPS-induced pp60src 
activation. LPS-induced Hsp90 phosphorylation was also prevented by the pp60src 
inhibitor PP2. Additionally, Hsp90 phosphorylation was induced by infecting 
cells with a constitutively active pp60src adenovirus, whereas either a 
dominant-negative pp60src adenovirus or reduced expression of pp60src by a 
specific siRNA prevented the LPS-induced Y phosphorylation of Hsp90. 
Transfection of HLMVEC with the nonphosphorylatable Hsp90β Y300F mutant 
prevented LPS-induced Hsp90β tyrosine phosphorylation but not pp60src 
activation. Furthermore, the Hsp90β Y300F mutant showed a reduced ability to 
bind the Hsp90 client proteins eNOS and pp60src and HLMVEC transfected with the 
mutant exhibited reduced LPS-induced barrier dysfunction. We conclude that 
inflammatory stimuli cause posttranslational modifications of Hsp90 that are 
Hsp90-inhibitor sensitive and may be important to the proinflammatory actions of 
Hsp90.

DISCUSSION

Hsp90 is a major regulator of important physiological processes conducted through “client” proteins, mostly enzymes and transcriptions factors, that it stabilizes and/or activates ( 48 ). Hsp90 inhibitors were initially developed to fight cancer, but ongoing research suggests that these compounds may also have a beneficial role in other diseases, since they exhibit strong anti-inflammatory properties ( 3 , 7 ).

Hsp90 consists of COOH-, middle-, and NH 2 -terminal domains, the latter arranged in a two-layer α/β sandwich structure in which the helices form a pocket that is the binding site of adenine nucleotides and most Hsp90 inhibitors. The biological function of Hsp90 depends on its ability to hydrolyze and bind ATP ( 33 ). The middle segment of Hsp90 consists of an αβα domain at the NH 2 terminus of the construct, connecting to a small αβα domain at the COOH terminus via a series of α-helices. This is the major site for client protein interaction. The COOH-terminal domain of Hsp90 is crucial for Hsp90 dimerization ( 33 ).

There are two major cytoplasmic isoforms of Hsp90: Hsp90α and Hsp90β. Hsp90α expression is inducible and lower compared with Hsp90β, which is constitutively expressed ( 12 ). Differences in the sequence between the α and β isoforms suggest that they may bind client proteins with different affinity ( 43 ). Other members of the Hsp90 family include Hsp90N, which is mainly associated with cellular transformation ( 17 ); GPR 94, found in the endoplasmic reticulum; and TRAP1, located in the mitochondria ( 11 ).

Hsp90 is regulated at several levels, including the ATPase cycle ( 16 ), association with conformation-specific cochaperones ( 36 ), and posttranslational modifications ( 35 , 37 ), the latter including phosphorylation, acetylation, S -nitrosylation, oxidation, and ubiquitination ( 28 ). Hyperacetylation induced by HDAC inhibition can abrogate client protein, p23, and ATP binding while it enhances the binding of inhibitory drugs to the N domain ( 21 ). Nitric oxide-induced nitrosylation of the Hsp90 C domain inhibits chaperone and ATPase activity in endothelial cells ( 25 , 31 , 35 ). Changes in phosphorylation impact Hsp90 function ( 22 ). Phosphorylation at sites in the M and the C domains, specifically, and by different molecular mechanisms, can modulate conformational rearrangements during the ATPase cycle of Hsp90 ( 42 ). LPS induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Hsp90, in HLMVEC, in a time-dependent manner. Similar Hsp90 posttranslational modifications are induced when in complex with the P2X ( 7 ) receptor and by the cell cycle protein Swe1, a Hsp90 client protein that phosphorylates the conserved Tyr24 in yeast Hsp90. This phosphorylation is crucial for the association of Swe1 with Hsp90 and established the importance of Hsp90 in cell cycle regulation ( 29 , 30 ). To our knowledge this is the first report of tyrosine phosphorylation of Hsp90 by a proinflammatory agent.

Hsp90 activation is involved in the induction of inflammation and Hsp90 inhibitors are able to counteract these effects ( 4 , 9 , 24 ). 17-Dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin reduces inflammation in lupus ( 39 ), blocks the NF-κB inflammatory cascade in immune stimulated macrophages ( 40 ) and substantially reduces necrosis-induced cytokine production and permeability increases in a model of endotoxin-induced uveitis ( 34 ). Moreover, the synthetic Hsp90 inhibitor EC144 appears to be efficacious in mouse models of endotoxin shock and arthritis ( 51 ). Other studies have reported a therapeutic benefit of Hsp90 inhibitors in experimental autoimmune encephalitis and arthritis ( 22 , 24 , 32 ).

Here we report for the first time that the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG can block the LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Hsp90 in both human and bovine endothelial cells, suggesting that this is not a species-specific effect. Hsp90 inhibitors have been shown to block phosphorylation of major intracellular pathways. In particular, SNX-2122 has been reported to degrade both full-length HER2 and p95-HER2 and to downregulate HER2, AKT, and ERK signaling in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo ( 6 ). In breast cancer cells that express high levels of HER2, 17-AAG also causes rapid inhibition of Akt kinase activity ( 4 ). Tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent NF-κB activation is sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 by geldanamycin, most likely through c-Src. Geldanamycin inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation and degradation of IkBa in HeLa and Jurkat cells, resulting in NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding, suggesting that Hsp90 plays a key role in NF-κB activation by oxidative stress ( 10 ).

The LPS-induced activation of pp60 src in endothelial cells was first reported in 2008 by Chatterjee et al. ( 7 ) and was in line with other studies that introduced LPS-induced pp60 Src activation in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages ( 13 , 23 , 44 ). Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK) also play an important role in LPS-induced superoxide production and are responsible for the phosphorylation of the TLR4 in mouse RAW264 macrophages and in Chinese hamster ovary cells ( 8 ). In endothelial cells, pp60 src is activated in response to a variety of stimuli, including H 2 O 2 , estrogen, and shear stress and leads to activation of eNOS ( 15 ). Furthermore, activated pp60 src increases the nuclear translocation of c-Jun and p65 ( 46 ) via PI3K/Akt and MAPKs ( 19 ), regulates LPS-induced actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in macrophages ( 9 ), and controls NADPH oxidase activation and ROS production ( 45 ). Indeed, Severgnini et al. ( 38 ) have shown both in vivo and in vitro that inhibition of the Src kinases protects against LPS-induced acute lung injury. However, this is the first report of inhibition of the LPS-induced phosphorylation of Hsp90 by pp60 src silencing or by antagonists.

The role of Hsp90 phosphorylation in inflammation remains largely unknown. In an effort to investigate the role of Hsp90 tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial barrier function, we demonstrated overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable Hsp90 mutant to HLMVEC, increased resting barrier strength, and moderately but significantly attenuated LPS-induced hyperpermeability. The small magnitude of the protective effect is likely due to the small transfection efficacy of the mutant and the continuous presence of the phosphorylatable, constitutive Hsp90. This is likely the reason why the mutant was also unable to reduce LPS-induced pp60 src activation. Indeed, when examined directly, the Y300F Hsp90β mutant exhibits profoundly reduced binding to two distinct Hsp90 client proteins. This agrees with previous studies demonstrating that the Y 300 of Hsp90β is a major phosphorylation site by c-Src in VEGFR-2-stimulated COS-7 cells and that the mutant Y300F Hsp90 reduces the association with eNOS in response to VEGFR-2 ( 14 ). The hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation activates Hsp90 and improves its client binding efficacy is further supported by the observation that tyrosine-phosphorylated Hsp90 preferentially associates with the P2X7 receptor complex and that the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation are associated with the function of the receptor. Treatment of HEK293 cells with geldanamycin decreased the Hsp90 phosphotyrosine levels without a detectable changes in Hsp90 protein levels ( 1 ). Recently, Hsp90 tyrosine phosphorylation was shown to promote recruitment of AHA1, stimulate Hsp90 ATPase activity, and regulate the Hsp90 chaperone cycle ( 50 ). Phosphorylation of two serine residues by casein kinase 2 is also crucial for Hsp90 activity, whereas hyperphosphorylation of these sites decreases its activity ( 27 ). It has been proposed that a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Hsp90 is necessary for client binding and release ( 52 ).

Endothelial cells are both a target and a participant of inflammation. They contain a substantial amount of Hsp90, which is critically involved in the hyperpermeability caused by inflammation and, in the case of pulmonary microvascular endothelium, in the edema and subsequent lung dysfunction associated with ALI/ARDS. Our present data agree with aforementioned findings in other tissues and strongly suggest that endothelial Hsp90 phosphorylation mediates, at least in part, Hsp90 complex formation with certain client proteins that are involved in normal endothelial function as well as in mediating inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the present data indicate that in endothelial cells, since pp60 src and Hsp90 phosphorylation/activation are abrogated by either Hsp90 or pp60 src inhibition, they are tightly coordinated and constitute a powerful proinflammatory unit ( Fig. 9 ).
