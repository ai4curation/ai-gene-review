Floor-plate-derived extracellular signaling molecules, including canonical axon 
guidance cues of the Netrin family, control neuronal circuit organization. 
Despite the importance of the floor plate as an essential signaling center in 
the developing vertebrate central nervous system, no systematic approach to 
identify binding partners for floor-plate-expressed cell-surface and secreted 
proteins has been carried out. Here, we used a high-throughput assay to discover 
extracellular protein-protein interactions, which likely take place in the 
zebrafish floor-plate microenvironment. The assembled floor-plate network 
contains 47 interactions including the hitherto-not-reported interaction between 
Netrin-1 and Draxin. We further characterized this interaction, narrowed down 
the binding interface, and demonstrated that Draxin competes with Netrin 
receptors for binding to Netrin-1. Our results suggest that Draxin functions as 
an extracellular Netrin signaling modulator in vertebrates. A reciprocal 
gradient of Draxin might shape or sharpen the active Netrin gradient, thereby 
critically modulating its effect.
