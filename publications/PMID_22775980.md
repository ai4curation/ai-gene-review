This study analysed the nitrifier community in the biofilter of a zero 
discharge, recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) for the production of marine 
shrimp in a low density (low ammonium production) system. The ammonia-oxidizing 
populations were examined by targeting 16S rRNA and amoA genes of 
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). The nitrite-oxidizing 
bacteria (NOB) were investigated by targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Archaeal amoA 
genes were more abundant in all compartments of the RAS than bacterial amoA 
genes. Analysis of bacterial and archaeal amoA gene sequences revealed that most 
ammonia oxidizers were related to Nitrosomonas marina and Nitrosopumilus 
maritimus. The NOB detected were related to Nitrospira marina and Nitrospira 
moscoviensis, and Nitrospira marina-type NOB were more abundant than N. 
moscoviensis-type NOB. Water quality and biofilm attachment media played a role 
in the competitiveness of AOA over AOB and Nitrospira marina-over N. 
moscoviensis-type NOB.
