Non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl is a well known regulator of the 
actin-cytoskeleton, including the formation of stress fibers and membrane 
ruffles. Vinexin is an adapter protein consisting of three SH3 domains, and 
involved in signal transduction and the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. In 
this study, we found that vinexin alpha as well as beta interacts with c-Abl 
mainly through the third SH3 domain, and that vinexin and c-Abl were colocalized 
at membrane ruffles in rat astrocytes. This interaction was reduced by 
latrunculin B, suggesting an F-actin-mediated regulatory mechanism. We also 
found that vinexin alpha but not beta was phosphorylated at tyrosine residue 
when c-Abl or v-Abl was co-expressed. A mutational analysis identified tyrosine 
127 on vinexin alpha as a major site of phosphorylation by c- or v-Abl. These 
results suggest that vinexin alpha is a novel substrate for Abl.
