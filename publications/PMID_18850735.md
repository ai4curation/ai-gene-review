The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multiprotein complex that plays a critical role 
in diverse cellular and developmental processes in various eukaryotic organisms. 
Despite of its significance, current understanding of the biological functions 
and regulatory mechanisms of the CSN complex is still very limited. To unravel 
these molecular mechanisms, we have performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis 
of the human CSN complex using a new purification method and quantitative mass 
spectrometry. Purification of the human CSN complex from a stable 293 cell line 
expressing N-terminal HBTH-tagged CSN5 subunit was achieved by high-affinity 
streptavidin binding with TEV cleavage elution. Mass spectrometric analysis of 
the purified CSN complex has revealed the identity of its composition as well as 
N-terminal modification and phosphorylation of the CSN subunits. N-terminal 
modifications were determined for seven subunits, six of which have not been 
reported previously, and six novel phosphorylation sites were also identified. 
Additionally, we have applied the newly developed MAP-SILAC and PAM-SILAC 
methods to decipher the dynamics of the human CSN interacting proteins. A total 
of 52 putative human CSN interacting proteins were identified, most of which are 
reported for the first time. In comparison to PAM-SILAC results, 20 proteins 
were classified as stable interactors, whereas 20 proteins were identified as 
dynamic ones. This work presents the first comprehensive characterization of the 
human CSN complex by mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach, providing 
valuable information for further understanding of CSN complex structure and 
biological functions.
