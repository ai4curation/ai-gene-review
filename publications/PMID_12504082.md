Interleukin 21 (IL-21) is a recently identified novel cytokine that plays an 
important role in the regulation of B, T, and NK cell functions. Its effects 
depend on binding to and signaling through an IL-21 receptor complex consisting 
of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common gamma-chain (gamma(c)). In this 
study using biosensor technique, the ligand-binding properties of IL-21R and 
gamma(c), which are presently poorly understood on a molecular level, were 
analyzed employing recombinant ectodomains of IL-21R and gamma(c). The formation 
of a binary complex between IL-21 and immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 70pM), gamma(c) 
and immobilized IL-21 (K(D) 160 microM) and a ternary complex between gamma(c) 
and IL-21 saturated immobilized IL-21R (K(D) 160nM) could be analyzed. The 
gamma(c) residues involved in IL-21 binding were defined by alanine-scanning 
mutational analysis. The epitope comprises gamma(c) residues N44, Y103, N128, 
L161, E162, and L208. It is not identical but partially overlapping with the 
previously established gamma(c) epitope for IL-4 binding. These results open the 
way to understand the molecular recognition mechanism in the IL-21 receptor 
system and also the promiscuous binding properties of gamma(c).
