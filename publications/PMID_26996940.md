The molecular mechanism by which the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau 
regulates the formation of microtubules (MTs) is poorly understood. The activity 
of tau is controlled via phosphorylation at specific Ser/Thr sites. Of those 
phosphorylation sites, 17 precede a proline, making them potential recognition 
sites for the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 binding and catalysis of 
phosphorylated tau at the AT180 epitope, which was implicated in Alzheimer's 
disease, has been reported to be crucial for restoring tau's ability to promote 
MT polymerization in vitro and in vivo [1]. Surprisingly, we discover that Pin1 
does not promote phosphorylated tau-induced MT formation in vitro, refuting the 
commonly accepted model in which Pin1 binding and catalysis on the A180 epitope 
restores the function of the Alzheimer's associated phosphorylated tau in 
tubulin assembly [1, 2]. Using turbidity assays, time-resolved small angle X-ray 
scattering (SAXS), and time-resolved negative stain electron microscopy (EM), we 
investigate the mechanism of tau-mediated MT assembly and the role of the Thr231 
and Ser235 phosphorylation on this process. We discover novel GTP-tubulin 
ring-shaped species, which are detectable in the earliest stage of tau-induced 
polymerization and may play a crucial role in the early nucleation phase of MT 
assembly. Finally, by NMR and SAXS experiments, we show that the tau molecules 
must be located on the surface of MTs and tubulin rings during the 
polymerization reaction. The interaction between tau and tubulin is 
multipartite, with a high affinity interaction of the four tubulin-binding 
repeats, and a weaker interaction with the proline-rich sequence and the termini 
of tau.
