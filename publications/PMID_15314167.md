We report that the actin filament-associated protein AFAP-110 is required to 
mediate protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine 
kinase c-Src and the subsequent formation of podosomes. Immunofluorescence 
analysis demonstrated that activation of PKCalpha by phorbol 12-myristate 
13-acetate (PMA), or ectopic expression of constitutively activated PKCalpha, 
directs AFAP-110 to colocalize with and bind to the c-Src SH3 domain, resulting 
in activation of the tyrosine kinase. Activation of c-Src then directs the 
formation of podosomes, which contain cortactin, AFAP-110, actin, and c-Src. In 
a cell line (CaOV3) that has very little or no detectable AFAP-110, PMA 
treatment was unable to activate c-Src or effect podosome formation. Ectopic 
expression of AFAP-110 in CaOV3 cells rescued PKCalpha-mediated activation of 
c-Src and elevated tyrosine phosphorylation levels and subsequent formation of 
podosomes. Neither expression of activated PKCalpha nor treatment with PMA was 
able to induce these changes in CAOV3 cells expressing mutant forms of AFAP-110 
that are unable to bind to, or colocalize with, c-Src. We hypothesize that one 
major function of AFAP-110 is to relay signals from PKCalpha that direct the 
activation of c-Src and the formation of podosomes.
