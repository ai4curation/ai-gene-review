HumHtrA2 or Omi is a recently described member of a novel family of mammalian 
serine proteases homologous to the Escherichia coli htrA gene product. Although 
the physiological function of members of this new family is unclear, the current 
understanding is that as well as being involved with the degradation aberrantly 
folded proteins during conditions of cellular stress, they may possess a 
chaperone-like role under normal conditions. In this report we describe the 
overexpression of humHtrA2 in two heterologous systems comparing the merits of 
each. We found that molecular analysis of processing events in Sf9 cells allowed 
us to revisit E. coli expression systems which were initially unsuccessful. 
Using E. coli we were able to produce milligram amounts of >90% pure recombinant 
enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE gels. By means of fluorescently labeled 
substrates alpha- and beta-casein and zymography, the proteolytic activity of 
recombinant HumHtrA2 was also demonstrated.
