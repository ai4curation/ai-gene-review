The cloning of full length cDNA for the translocon-associated protein alpha 
subunit, previously called signal sequence receptor alpha, is reported as a 
result of differential display experiments in search of genes induced by 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Its messenger RNA was more 
abundant in growing cells than in either factor-deprived cells or quiescent 
cells and comprised four species, each having microheterogeneity, as a result of 
complex alternative polyadenylation apparently dependent on arrays of 
non-canonical polyadenylation signals. Radiation hybrid mapping of the gene 
showed that the gene is on the short arm of chromosome 6.
