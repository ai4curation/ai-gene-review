Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a 21-amino acid peptide secreted by the epithelium and core 
mesenchyme in the branchial arches as well as vascular endothelium, is involved 
in craniofacial and cardiovascular development through endothelin receptor 
type-A (EdnrA) expressed in the neural crest-derived ectomesenchyme. Here we 
show that ET-1(-/-) mutant mice exhibit a homeotic-like transformation of the 
lower jaw to an upper jaw. Most of the maxillary arch-derived components are 
duplicated and replaced mandibular arch-derived structures, resulting in a 
mirror image of the upper and lower jaws in the ET-1(-/-) mutant. As for hyoid 
arch-derivatives, the ventral structures are severely affected in comparison to 
the dorsal ones in the ET-1(-/-) mutant. Correspondingly, the expression of Dlx5 
and Dlx6, Distalless-related homeobox genes determining the ventral identity of 
the anterior branchial arches, and of the mandibular marker gene Pitx1 is 
significantly downregulated in the ET-1(-/-) mutant, whereas the expression of 
Dlx2 and the maxillary marker gene Prx2 is unaffected or rather upregulated. 
These findings indicate that the ET-1/EdnrA signaling may contribute to the 
dorsoventral axis patterning of the branchial arch system as a mediator of the 
regional intercellular interactions.
