Loading of small RNAs into Argonaute, the core protein in RNA silencing, 
requires the Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone machinery. This machinery also activates many 
other clients, including steroid hormone receptors and kinases, but how their 
structures change during chaperone-dependent activation remains unclear. Here, 
we utilized single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to probe 
the conformational changes of Drosophila Ago2 mediated by the chaperone 
machinery. We found that empty Ago2 exists in various closed conformations. The 
Hsp70 system (Hsp40 and Hsp70) and the Hsp90 system (Hop, Hsp90, and p23) 
together render Ago2 into an open, active form. The Hsp70 system, but not the 
Hsp90 system alone, is sufficient for Ago2 to partially populate the open form. 
Instead, the Hsp90 system is required to extend the dwell time of Ago2 in the 
open state, which must be transiently primed by the Hsp70 system. Our data 
uncover distinct and coordinated actions of the chaperone machinery, where the 
Hsp70 system expands the structural ensembles of Ago2 and the Hsp90 system 
captures and stabilizes the active form.
