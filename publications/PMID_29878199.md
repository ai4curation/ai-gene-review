Genomics methodologies have significantly improved elucidation of Mendelian 
disorders. The combination with high-throughput functional-omics technologies 
potentiates the identification and confirmation of causative genetic variants, 
especially in singleton families of recessive inheritance. In a cohort of 99 
individuals with abnormal Golgi glycosylation, 47 of which being unsolved, 
glycomics profiling was performed of total plasma glycoproteins. Combination 
with whole-exome sequencing in 31 cases revealed a known genetic defect in 15 
individuals. To identify additional genetic factors, hierarchical clustering of 
the plasma glycomics data was done, which indicated a subgroup of four patients 
that shared a unique glycomics signature of hybrid type N-glycans. In two 
siblings, compound heterozygous mutations were found in SLC10A7, a gene of 
unknown function in human. These included a missense mutation that disrupted 
transmembrane domain 4 and a mutation in a splice acceptor site resulting in 
skipping of exon 9. The two other individuals showed a complete loss of SLC10A7 
mRNA. The patients' phenotype consisted of amelogenesis imperfecta, skeletal 
dysplasia, and decreased bone mineral density compatible with osteoporosis. The 
patients' phenotype was mirrored in SLC10A7 deficient zebrafish. Furthermore, 
alizarin red staining of calcium deposits in zebrafish morphants showed a strong 
reduction in bone mineralization. Cell biology studies in fibroblasts of 
affected individuals showed intracellular mislocalization of glycoproteins and a 
defect in post-Golgi transport of glycoproteins to the cell membrane. In 
contrast to yeast, human SLC10A7 localized to the Golgi. Our combined data 
indicate an important role for SLC10A7 in bone mineralization and transport of 
glycoproteins to the extracellular matrix.
