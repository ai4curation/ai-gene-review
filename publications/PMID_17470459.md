p27(Kip1) plays an important role in cell cycle regulation by inhibiting 
cyclin-CDK complex activity in the nucleus. p27(Kip1) is regulated by its 
concentration as well as by its subcellular localization. Tuberin, encoded by 
the tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressor gene TSC2, is a potent negative cell 
cycle regulator. We show herein, that tuberin induces nuclear p27 localization 
by inhibiting its 14-3-3-mediated cytoplasmic retention. Tuberin interferes with 
14-3-3's counteracting effects on p27-mediated cell cycle arrest. Akt-mediated 
phosphorylation of p27, but not of tuberin, negatively regulates tuberin's 
potential to trigger p27 nuclear localization. In G0 cells, tuberin binds p27 
triggering downregulation of p27's binding to 14-3-3 and of its cytoplasmic 
retention. At transition to S phase p27 is phosphorylated by Akt, tuberin/p27 
complex levels are downregulated and binding of p27 to 14-3-3 increases 
triggering cytoplasmic retention of p27. These findings demonstrate p27 
localization during the mammalian cell cycle to be under the control of the 
tumor suppressor tuberin.
