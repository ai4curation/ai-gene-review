factor-associated amphiphilic repression motifs. Moreover, SMXL4 and SMXL5 
interacted with HSFA1d and HSFA1e, central regulators sensing and transducing HS 
stimuli, and antagonistically affected their transactivation activity. In 
addition, HSFA2 directly bound to the SMXL4 and SMXL5 promoters, inducing their

Abstract

Identifying the essential factors and underlying mechanisms regulating plant heat stress (HS) responses is crucial for mitigating the threat posed by HS on plant growth, development, distribution, and productivity. In this study, we found that the Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) super-killer2 ( ski2 ) dicer-like4 ( dcl4 ) mutant, characterized by RNA processing defects and the accumulation of abundant 22-nt small interfering RNAs derived from protein-coding transcripts, displayed significantly increased expression levels of HS-responsive genes and enhanced thermotolerance. These traits primarily resulted from the suppression of SMAX1-LIKE4 ( SMXL4 ) and SMXL5 , which encode 2 putative transcriptional regulators that belong to the SMXL protein family. While smxl4 and smxl5 single mutants were similar to wild type, the smxl4 smxl5 double mutant displayed substantially heightened seedling thermotolerance. Further investigation demonstrated that SMXL4 and SMXL5 repressed the transcription of HEAT-SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 ( HSFA2 ), encoding a master regulator of thermotolerance, independently of ethylene-response factor–associated amphiphilic repression motifs. Moreover, SMXL4 and SMXL5 interacted with HSFA1d and HSFA1e, central regulators sensing and transducing HS stimuli, and antagonistically affected their transactivation activity. In addition, HSFA2 directly bound to the SMXL4 and SMXL5 promoters, inducing their expression during recovery from HS. Collectively, our findings elucidate the role of the SMXL4/SMXL5–HSFA2 regulatory module in orchestrating plant thermotolerance under HS.

Introduction

Exposure to extreme high-temperature conditions (heat stress or HS) causes devastating damage to plants at various stages of their development, ranging from seed germination to reproductive growth ( Hatfield and Prueger 2015 ; Sarwar et al. 2018 ; Haider et al. 2022a ). It is projected that the global mean temperature will increase by 2 to 4 °C by the end of the 21st century ( Haider et al. 2022b ). A rise in temperature of 1 °C is estimated to result in a decline in crop productivity, particularly for wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and maize ( Zea mays ), ranging from 4% to 10% ( Zhao et al. 2017 ; Haider et al. 2022b ). Understanding the pivotal factors governing plant HS response (HSR) and subsequent growth recovery is imperative for adaptation to the challenges posed by global warming and population growth ( Zhao et al. 2017 ; Haider et al. 2022a , 2022b ).

Plants have developed elaborate morphological and molecular adaptation mechanisms to cope with extreme high-temperature conditions. At the physiological level, plants enhance their cooling capacity through the elongation of hypocotyls and leaf petioles to evade the heat-radiating soil surface, as well as by producing smaller and thinner leaves ( Crawford et al. 2012 ). At the molecular level, plants activate the HSR to withstand the detrimental effects caused by HS. The HSR pathway primarily triggers the biosynthesis of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and other stress-responsive proteins ( Richter et al. 2010 ). Mutants deficient in HSP function exhibit diminished tolerance to HS ( Yamada et al. 2007 ; Su and Li 2008 ). The regulation of plant HSR is highly complex and sophisticated, requiring coordinated action among multiple families of transcription factors (TFs; Haider et al. 2022a ). While heat-shock TFs (HSFs) have traditionally been recognized as the principal regulators of HSR, recent studies have revealed the substantial contribution of other TF families, including NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2 (NAC) family member NAC019, MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c (MBF1c), and DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), in orchestrating plant responses to HS ( Qin et al. 2007 ; Suzuki et al. 2011 ; Guan et al. 2014 ; Haider et al. 2022b ).

The HSF family can be classified into 3 primary groups. Class A HSFs predominantly positively contribute to HSR. Among HSFA members, HSFA1s (HSFA1a, HSFA1b, HSFA1d, and HSFA1e) have been identified as key regulators of the HSR in various plant species ( Scharf et al. 2012 ). Under normal growth conditions, the transactivation activity of HSFA1d is hindered by the binding of HSP70 and HSP90 to its temperature-dependent repression domain. This interaction is disrupted under HS conditions ( Ohama et al. 2016 ). Additionally, recent studies have unveiled how HSFA1s govern 2 aspects of plant development in response to higher temperatures: thermomorphogenesis (HSFA1s–PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 [PIF4] module) and the heat-shock response (HSFA1s–HSFA2 module; Nishizawa-Yokoi et al. 2011 ; Tan et al. 2023a ). Class B HSFs repress gene expression during the recovery stage after HS ( Haider et al. 2022a ). Class C HSFs have a function similar to that of HSFAs and positively regulate the HSR ( Nishizawa-Yokoi et al. 2011 ; Jacob et al. 2017 ; Haider et al. 2022a ).

HSFA2 is a master regulator of thermotolerance by positively modulating the expression of HSR-related genes in plants ( Charng et al. 2007 ). Mutation of HSFA2 leads to a considerable impairment of thermotolerance, accompanied by a marked downregulation of HSR-related gene expression, including that of small HSP genes ( sHSP s), HSP70 , and HSP90 ( Charng et al. 2007 ). To mitigate the deleterious effects of HS, plants must induce the expression of HSFA2 to cope with HS conditions. Increasing evidence indicates that HSFA2 expression is controlled at multiple levels, including transcriptional regulation ( Nishizawa-Yokoi et al. 2011 ; Huang et al. 2021 ; He et al. 2022 ), alternative splicing ( Hu et al. 2020 ), noncoding RNAs ( Li et al. 2014 ; Stief et al. 2014 ; Li et al. 2023 ), epigenetic regulation ( Liu et al. 2019 ), translational regulation ( Chung et al. 2020 ), and heteromeric complex formation ( Friedrich et al. 2021 ). HSFA2 expression was shown to be quickly induced by HSFA1d and HSFA1e in response to HS in Arabidopsis ( Charng et al. 2007 ; Nishizawa-Yokoi et al. 2011 ). However, the simultaneous loss of HSFA1d and HSFA1e functions did not completely block the induction of HSFA2 expression under HS, suggesting the existence of additional regulators of HSFA2 ( Nishizawa-Yokoi et al. 2011 ). Plant thermotolerance can be improved by overexpression of HSFA2 ( Nishizawa et al. 2006 ; Charng et al. 2007 ). Nevertheless, excessive accumulation of HSFA2 causes growth inhibition and developmental retardation ( Ogawa et al. 2007 ). The occurrence of HS is often transient and recurrent, necessitating the timely inhibition or elimination of excess HSFA2 by plants during growth recovery ( Crisp et al. 2016 ). Therefore, further investigation is necessary to determine the regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune the accumulation of HSFA2 transcripts and HSFA2 protein.

Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is an evolutionarily conserved, sequence-specific gene-inactivating pathway in eukaryotes, particularly in plants ( Bologna and Voinnet 2014 ). PTGS is crucial for fine-tuning the balance between growth and stress responses during stress and recovery periods ( Pumplin and Voinnet 2013 ; Crisp et al. 2016 ; Hamar et al. 2020 ; Wu et al. 2020 ). PTGS involves the degradation of target RNAs by small RNAs that are cleaved by DICER family proteins ( Bologna and Voinnet 2014 ; Wu et al. 2020 ). Arabidopsis has 4 such DICER-LIKE (DCL) proteins; while the roles of DCL1, DCL3, and DCL4 in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses have been experimentally verified ( Zhang et al. 2012 ; Liu et al. 2017 ; Wu et al. 2017 ; Liu and He 2020 ). The antiviral defense efficacy of DCL2 has been acknowledged, establishing its potential as a substitute for DCL4 ( Bouche et al. 2006 ; Katsarou et al. 2018 ).

However, the investigation of endogenous 22-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), predominantly processed by DCL2, is hampered by their limited abundance. Defective RNA decay and DCL4 activity in the ein5 dcl4 (lacking ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE5 [EIN5] and DCL4 function) or ski2 dcl4 (lacking SUPER-KILLER2 [SKI2] and DCL4 function) double mutants leads to a substantial accumulation of 22-nt siRNAs derived from protein-coding transcripts ( Wu et al. 2017 , 2020 ). Half of these siRNAs are derived from NITRATE REDUCTASE1 ( NIA1 ) and NIA2 mRNAs, which encode nitrate reductases. In a nitrogen-deficient environment, 22-nt siRNAs generated by NIA1/2 transcripts induce the translational repression of these NIA1/2 transcripts, resulting in lower amino acid contents, decreased global translation, and a transition from growth to defense ( Wu et al. 2020 ). The ein5 dcl4 and ski2 dcl4 double mutants exhibit compromised plant growth and development under normal conditions, accompanied by the upregulation of stress-responsive genes ( Wilkinson and Crawford 1993 ; Wu et al. 2020 ). Genes, including NIA1 / 2 , SMAX1-LIKE4 ( SMXL4 ), SMXL5 , HSP70 s, and CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER ( HD-ZIP III ) family members, produced 22-nt siRNAs in these 2 double mutants ( Wu et al. 2020 ). Besides NIA1/2 , whether the other genes participate in coordinating growth, development, and stress responses is not completely understood.

The SMXL protein family present in terrestrial plant species defines a group of evolutionarily conserved transcriptional repressors that regulate various developmental processes and stress responses ( Bennett and Leyser 2014 ; Villaécija-Aguilar et al. 2019 ; Machin et al. 2020 ; Yang et al. 2020 ; Feng et al. 2023 ). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SMXLs cluster into 3 distinct subclades ( Wallner et al. 2017 ), all containing the highly conserved ethylene-response factor–associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, which play a role in protein–protein interactions with the transcriptional corepressor proteins TOPLESS (TPL) and TPL-related proteins (TPRs; Bennett and Leyser 2014 ; Moturu et al. 2018 ). In Arabidopsis, SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1) and SMXL2 within Subclade 1, and SMXL6, SMXL7, and SMXL8 (SMXL6–8) within Subclade 2 modulate karrikin and strigolactone responses, respectively, in a TPL-dependent manner by repressing transcription ( Villaécija-Aguilar et al. 2019 ; Wang et al. 2020a , 2020b ). Subclade 3 is the least studied and comprises SMXL3, SMXL4, and SMXL5 (SMXL3–5), which are functionally redundant during early protophloem development and primary root growth ( Wallner et al. 2017 , 2020 ). While the perception of karrikin or strigolactone leads to degradation of Subclades 1 and 2 SMXLs via the ubiquitination–proteasome pathway in a SKIP–CULLIN–F-BOX (SCF) complex–dependent manner ( Machin et al. 2020 ), karrikin or strigolactone signaling does not influence the stabilities of SMXL3–5 proteins ( Wallner et al. 2017 ). A recent study determined that SMXL6 acts as a transcriptional repressor and forms complexes with unknown TFs to recognize and bind to the promoters of BRANCHED1 ( BRC1 ), TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF DOMAIN PROTEIN1 ( TCP1 ), and PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1 ( PAP1 ), repressing their transcription ( Wang et al. 2020b ). Additionally, SMXL6, acting as a repressive TF, recruits TPL co-repressors and directly binds to the promoters of Subclade 2 SMXL genes to suppress their expression ( Wang et al. 2020b ). However, it remains unclear whether SMXL3–5 act as transcriptional repressors.

In this study, we discovered that the ski2 dcl4 double mutant exhibits notable thermotolerance, which is attenuated by the dcl2 mutation. We show that the production of 22-nt siRNAs leads to the suppression of SMXL4 and SMXL5 , which encode repressive TFs that negatively regulate HSR. Moreover, our investigation revealed that SMXL4 and SMXL5 directly bind to the HSFA2 promoter and form complexes with HSFA1d and HSFA1e to exert inhibitory effects on the expression of HSFA2 . After returning to normal growth temperature, HSFA2 in turn activates the expression of SMXL4 and SMXL5 , thereby establishing a feedback loop during the recovery phase. These results highlight a regulatory module consisting of SMXL4/SMXL5, HSFA1d/HSFA1e, and HSFA2 that is critical for plant survival under HS conditions. Our study is essential for unraveling the mechanisms of thermotolerance, providing valuable insights into optimizing plant growth and development as well as augmenting crop yield.

Discussion

With the gradual intensification of climate change and its substantial impact on crop yields, it is imperative to investigate regulatory factors that effectively balance plant stress adaptation and growth recovery, thereby enabling plants to cope with transient and repeated HS ( Haider et al. 2022a ). Our data support a model in which SMXL4 and SMXL5 are repressive TFs that directly bind to the HSFA2 promoter to inhibit its expression. Moreover, under normal conditions, SMXL4 and SMXL5 associated with HSFA1d and HSFA1e and negatively modulated the signaling cascade involving HSFA1d/HSFA1e–HSFA2. During HS, SMXL4 and SMXL5 expression is repressed by an unknown factor X, leading to an upregulation of HS-inducible HSFA2 . During the recovery phase, excessive HSFA2 formed a negative feedback loop for the expression of SMXL4 and SMXL5 , leading to the return of HSFA2 expression to basal levels ( Fig. 8 ). Plants have therefore developed a sophisticated regulatory loop involving SMXL4, SMXL5, and HSFA2 to acclimate to dynamically changing ambient temperatures, thereby optimizing resource allocation for optimal growth.

Recent studies have reported the importance of 22-nt siRNAs in plant adaptation and resistance to stress ( Wu et al. 2020 ). For example, 22-nt siRNAs impose translational repression on NIA1 and NIA2 transcripts, thus limiting the accumulation of the 2 encoded enzymes and restraining plant growth in response to a nitrogen-poor environment ( Wu et al. 2020 ). However, aside from the elucidated mechanism through which these NIA1/2 -generated 22-nt siRNAs act, how other 22-nt siRNAs participate in stress responses is poorly understood. In this study, we discovered that the ski2 dcl4 double mutant, which accumulates many 22-nt siRNAs derived from the transcripts of protein-coding genes, experienced the upregulation of multiple HSR genes to confer enhanced thermotolerance compared with WT, an effect that was abolished by the addition of the dcl2 mutation in the ski2 dcl4 background ( Fig. 1 ). Functional loss of PTGS core effectors, such as DCL2, RDR6, and AGO1, also abrogated the enhanced thermotolerance phenotype of the ski2 dcl4 double mutant ( Supplementary Fig. S1A ), suggesting that the DCL2-dependent PTGS pathway is crucial for thermotolerance. Further studies have demonstrated that the elevated thermotolerance of ski2 dcl4 resulted from the suppression of SMXL4 and SMXL5 function, presumably via RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated turnover, by their cognate 22-nt siRNAs. In agreement with this notion, the simultaneous loss of SMXL4 and SMXL5 function resulted in a thermotolerance phenotype similar to that of the ski2 dcl4 double mutant ( Fig. 2, B to D ). In conclusion, the present study unveils the pivotal role of SMXL4/SMXL5 in governing plant thermotolerance, as evidenced by their profound alteration in the ski2 dcl4 double mutant.

The production of SMXL4/SMXL5 -derived 22-nt siRNAs triggers transitive PTGS, which promotes the degradation of mRNA with homologous sequences ( Wu et al. 2017 ; Oberlin et al. 2022 ; Feng et al. 2024 ). This observation may in part explain why we failed to produce a compensatory phenotype through introducing additional SMXL4/SMXL5 copies into the ski2 dcl4 double mutant. Furthermore, we showed that the thermal response of phb or phv single mutants was comparable with that of WT seedlings ( Supplementary Fig. S2B ). However, recent studies have unveiled a significant enhancement in plant heat tolerance upon simultaneous loss of PHB and PHV (also the primary targets of 22-nt siRNAs) activity ( Li et al. 2023 ). We speculate that 22-nt siRNAs primarily inhibit the function of SMXL4/SMXL5 and PHB/PHV by RISC-mediated mRNA decay, thereby enhancing the expression of HSFA2 and increasing thermotolerance.

Emerging evidence reveals that plant thermotolerance is tightly associated with PTGS, whose key effectors can be modulated at both transcript and protein levels by high temperatures ( Pumplin and Voinnet 2013 ). It was reported that miR156 isoforms accumulate to high levels after HS, and their levels are critical for AT ( Stief et al. 2014 ). Higher temperature was shown to increase the activity of DCL2 during Turnip crinkle virus infection, leading to the production of viral 22-nt siRNAs that ensure the survival of infected Arabidopsis ( A. thaliana ) plants ( Zhang et al. 2012 ). The number of condensates containing SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3 (SGS3) rapidly increases following HS, concomitant with greater siRNA production, which might be associated with HS-induced global translational repression ( Ueda et al. 2012 ; Tan et al. 2023b ). HS tolerance is enhanced in Arabidopsis plants lacking the function of the 5′-3′ exoribonuclease EIN5 ( Nguyen et al. 2015 ). Combining the ein5 mutant with the loss-of-function ski2 mutant, lacking functions of both the 5′-3′ RNA decay pathway and 3′-5′ RNA decay pathway, leads to the generation of numerous DCL2- and DCL4-dependent siRNAs derived from the transcripts of protein-coding genes ( Zhang et al. 2015 ). These sRNAs possess the potential to modulate gene expression and functionality, thus resulting in enhanced HS tolerance. Our data suggest that maintaining strong thermotolerance by constitutively silencing SMXL4 and SMXL5 and keeping HSFA2 stable in the “on state” is an important biological function of these DCL2-dependent 22-nt siRNAs in ski2 dcl4 . Prior research has elucidated the competitive dynamic between DCL4 and DCL2 concerning their utilization of substrates ( Bouche et al. 2006 ; Katsarou et al. 2018 ). A future exploration of the underlying mechanism behind the modulation of the PTGS pathway during HS will be critical to uncover the acclimation responses of plants to HS.

Aside from SMXL3–5, other members of the SMXL family have been reported to be involved in various aspects of plant development and stress acclimation by functioning as transcriptional repressors ( Machin et al. 2020 ; Wang et al. 2020a , 2020b ). SMXL6 was shown to directly bind to the SMXL6–8 promoters and repress their transcription in an EAR motif–dependent manner ( Wang et al. 2020b ). Our study demonstrated that SMXL4 and SMXL5 are repressive TFs as well, directly binding to the HSFA2 promoter to suppress its expression, resulting in enhanced plant thermotolerance ( Fig. 4 ). We identified an EAR motif and an EAR-like motif in SMXL4 and SMXL5 ( Fig. 5A , Supplementary Fig. S5A ), and the evolutionarily conserved EAR motif was integral to their interactions ( Fig. 5, B to E ). While these EAR motifs were required for the repression of CHS transcription ( Supplementary Fig. S5, B and C ), they were dispensable for the transcriptional repression of HSFA2 ( Fig. 5F ). Based on our data, we hypothesize that (i) SMXL4 and SMXL5 compete with HSFA1d and HSFA1e to occupy the HSEs in the HSFA2 promoter, thereby directly inhibiting transcription; and (ii) SMXL4 and SMXL5 interact with HSFA1d and HSFA1e, blocking their capacity to initiate HSFA2 transcription. Additional biochemical experiments are required to distinguish between these 2 possibilities. In addition, RNA-seq analysis identified 425 genes as potential targets of SMXL4 and SMXL5 that may be involved in a variety of phytohormonal and stress responses ( Fig. 3, D and E ). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that SMXL4 and SMXL5 affect plant adaptation to multiple environmental stresses in many ways.

The SMXL family comprises 3 subfamilies with functional diversification in various aspects ( Wallner et al. 2017 ). SMAX1 and SMXL2 play a primary role in seed germination, root hair development, and the regulation of thermomorphogenesis ( Machin et al. 2020 ; Park et al. 2022 ). SMXL6–8 are primarily involved in stem elongation and regulation of drought tolerance ( Machin et al. 2020 ; Yang et al. 2020 ). SMXL3–5 regulate phloem development ( Wallner et al. 2017 ; Machin et al. 2020 ). In this study, we observed no thermal response distinct from that of WT for the smax1 smxl2 double mutant or the smxl6 smxl7 smxl8 triple mutant, indicating that their corresponding proteins do not contribute to thermotolerance. In contrast, SMXL3–5 negatively regulated thermotolerance, as evidenced by the increased HS tolerance seen in their double mutant combinations ( Fig. 3A ).

Apart from their functional specificity, the regulatory factors upstream of SMXL family members are also distinct. For example, SMAX1, SMXL2, and SMXL6–8 are mainly degraded during phytohormone-induced and SCF complex–dependent ubiquitination ( Wang et al. 2015 ). On the contrary, karrikin or strigolactone signals do not affect SMXL4 or SMXL5 ( Wallner et al. 2017 ). With loss of function of RNA degradation pathways ( dcp2 , varicose [ vcs ], or ein5 ski2 mutants) or DCL4 ( dcl4-2, ein5 dcl4 , or ski2 dcl4 mutants), plants accumulate 21- and 22-nt siRNAs derived from SMXL4 and SMXL5 for their silencing ( de Alba et al. 2015 ; Wu et al. 2017 , 2020 ). Unlike SMXL4 and SMXL5, the transcripts encoding the remaining SMAX1/SMXL members are unable to produce siRNAs ( Wu et al. 2020 ). Additionally, we demonstrated that higher temperatures have a significant suppressive effect on the expression of SMXL4 and SMXL5 ( Fig. 2, F and G ). Following HS, a substantial accumulation of HSFA2 also positively regulated the expression of SMXL4 and SMXL5 and ensured an optimal level of HSFA2 in plants. SMXL4 and SMXL5 are relatively distinct compared with other members within the SMXL family, and their precise regulatory mechanisms need to be further elucidated.
