Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the most prevalent esophageal cancer type in 
the United States. The TNF-α/mTOR pathway is known to mediate the development of 
EAC. Additionally, aberrant activation of Gli1, downstream effector of the 
Hedgehog (HH) pathway, has been observed in EAC. In this study, we found that an 
activated mTOR/S6K1 pathway promotes Gli1 transcriptional activity and oncogenic 
function through S6K1-mediated Gli1 phosphorylation at Ser84, which releases 
Gli1 from its endogenous inhibitor, SuFu. Moreover, elimination of S6K1 
activation by an mTOR pathway inhibitor enhances the killing effects of the HH 
pathway inhibitor. Together, our results established a crosstalk between the 
mTOR/S6K1 and HH pathways, which provides a mechanism for SMO-independent Gli1 
activation and also a rationale for combination therapy for EAC.
