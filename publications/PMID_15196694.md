The human follitropin (follicle stimulating hormone, FSH) receptor (FSHR) is a G 
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). To identify cytoplasmic proteins that may 
regulate FSHR function, a yeast-based interaction trap was performed. A linked 
construct of the first and second intracellular loops (iL1-iL2 bait) of FSHR was 
used as bait and a human ovarian cDNA library was used as prey. Among the 
proteins identified that interacted with the bait was 14-3-3tau, a member of a 
family of homodimeric cytoplasmic adapter proteins. Human granulosa cells, the 
site of FSHR expression in the ovary, were found to contain 14-3-3tau. 
Importantly, 14-3-3tau co-immunoprecipitated with FSHR stably expressed in HEK 
293 cells. Its association with FSHR was follitropin-dependent. Over-expression 
of 14-3-3tau resulted in a modest decrease of follitropin-induced cAMP 
accumulation. Collectively, these data support a role for 14-3-3tau in 
follitropin action. The finding that 14-3-3tau interacts with FSHR is novel and 
should lead to new insights into the regulation of GPCR in general and FSHR 
specifically.
