MicroRNAs are endogenously expressed small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene 
expression on the posttranscriptional level. The miR-17-92 cluster (encoding 
miR-17, -18a, -19a/b, -20a, and miR-92a) is highly expressed in tumor cells and 
is up-regulated by ischemia. Whereas miR-92a was recently identified as negative 
regulator of angiogenesis, the specific functions of the other members of the 
cluster are less clear. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of miR-17, -18a, 
-19a, and -20a significantly inhibited 3-dimensional spheroid sprouting in 
vitro, whereas inhibition of miR-17, -18a, and -20a augmented endothelial cell 
sprout formation. Inhibition of miR-17 and miR-20a in vivo using antagomirs 
significantly increased the number of perfused vessels in Matrigel plugs, 
whereas antagomirs that specifically target miR-18a and miR-19a were less 
effective. However, systemic inhibition of miR-17/20 did not affect tumor 
angiogenesis. Further mechanistic studies showed that miR-17/20 targets several 
proangiogenic genes. Specifically, Janus kinase 1 was shown to be a direct 
target of miR-17. In summary, we show that miR-17/20 exhibit a cell-intrinsic 
antiangiogenic activity in endothelial cells. Inhibition of miR-17/20 
specifically augmented neovascularization of Matrigel plugs but did not affect 
tumor angiogenesis indicating a context-dependent regulation of angiogenesis by 
miR-17/20 in vivo.
