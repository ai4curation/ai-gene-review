The GINS complex, which contains the four subunits Sld5, Psf1, Psf2, and Psf3, 
is essential for both the initiation and progression of DNA replication in 
eukaryotes. GINS associates with the MCM2-7 complex and Cdc45 to activate the 
eukaryotic minichromosome maintenance helicase. It also appears to interact with 
and stimulate the polymerase activities of DNA polymerase epsilon and the DNA 
polymerase alpha-primase complex. To further understand the functional role of 
GINS, we determined the crystal structure of the full-length human GINS 
heterotetramer. Each of the four subunits has a major domain composed of an 
alpha-helical bundle-like structure. With the exception of Psf1, each of the 
other subunits has a small domain containing a three-stranded beta-sheet core. 
Each full-length protein in the crystal has unstructured regions that are all 
located on the surface of GINS and are probably involved in its interaction with 
other replication factors. The four subunits contact each other mainly through 
alpha-helices to form a ring-like tetramer with a central pore. This pore is 
partially plugged by a 16-residue peptide from the Psf3 N terminus, which is 
unique to some eukaryotic Psf3 proteins and is not required for tetramer 
formation. Removal of these N-terminal 16 residues of Psf3 from the GINS 
tetramer increases the opening of the pore by 80%, suggesting a mechanism by 
which accessibility to the pore may be regulated. The structural data presented 
here indicate that the GINS tetramer is a highly stable complex with multiple 
flexible surface regions.
