STAT4 is an essential transcription factor for Th1 cell development. IL-12 and 
IFN-alpha both activate STAT4, but with different kinetics. In this study we 
compared their capacities to drive differentiation of human naive Th cells 
toward the Th1 phenotype. The Th1-polarizing activity of IFN-alpha was much 
weaker than that of IL-12, correlating with a marked difference in the kinetics 
of STAT4 activation; the response to IL-12 was sustained (>48 h), whereas the 
response to IFN-alpha was transient (4 h). The continuous presence of IL-12 was 
required for sustained STAT4 activation. Similarly, optimal Th1 polarization was 
only achieved upon prolonged exposure to IL-12 and could not be induced by a 
transient IL-12 pulse. Furthermore, the cytokine IL-2 potentiated sustained 
IL-12/STAT4 responses through up-regulation of IL-12R expression and synergized 
with IL-12 in driving Th1 cell development. Transient IFN-alpha responses, on 
the other hand, were not prolonged by IL-2. IFN-alpha treatment induced 
down-regulation of IFN-alphabeta receptor subunit 1, rendering cells refractory 
to IFN-alpha, but did not trans-inhibit the IL-12/STAT4 response. These data 
indicate that sustained IL-12 signaling is essential for optimal Th1 cell 
development and that transient activation of STAT4 in response to IFN-alpha may 
explain the poor Th1-polarizing capacity of this cytokine. Collectively these 
data show that the duration of cytokine signaling is important for determining 
the biological response.
