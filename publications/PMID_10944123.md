Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are attached to the C-termini of many 
proteins, thereby acting as membrane anchors. Biosynthesis of GPI is initiated 
by GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT), which transfers 
N-acetylglucosamine from UDP- N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol. 
GPI-GnT is a uniquely complex glycosyltransferase, consisting of at least four 
proteins, PIG-A, PIG-H, PIG-C and GPI1. Here, we report that GPI-GnT requires 
another component, termed PIG-P, and that DPM2, which regulates 
dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase, also regulates GPI-GnT. PIG-P, a 134-amino 
acid protein having two hydrophobic domains, associates with PIG-A and GPI1. 
PIG-P is essential for GPI-GnT since a cell lacking PIG-P is GPI-anchor 
negative. DPM2, but not two other components of dolichol-phosphate-mannose 
synthase, associates with GPI-GnT through interactions with PIG-A, PIG-C and 
GPI1. Lec15 cell, a null mutant of DPM2, synthesizes early GPI intermediates, 
indicating that DPM2 is not essential for GPI-GnT; however, the enzyme activity 
is enhanced 3-fold in the presence of DPM2. These results reveal new essential 
and regulatory components of GPI-GnT and imply co-regulation of GPI-GnT and the 
dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase that generates a mannosyl donor for GPI.
