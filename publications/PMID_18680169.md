The present study highlights on the biochemical and immunological analysis of 
MS-KIF18A in pre-osteogenic MBA-15 cells. The protein distribution in various 
cellular compartments was demonstrated by imaging and Western blot (WB) 
analysis. MS-KIF18A interactions with cytoskeletal proteins were confirmed for 
tubulin and actin. The complex between MS-KIF18A and microtubules (MT) was 
demonstrated in cellular system for endogenous proteins and also between 
recombinant proteins in pull down and immunoprecipitation (IP) assays. Multiple 
assays including metabolic labeling, cell fractionation and IP with 
anti-MS-KIF18A antibody demonstrated an association with actin that was 
prominent in the cell cytoplasm. Sub-cellular fractionation identified diverse 
forms of MS-KIF18A in cytoplasm and membrane/nucleus compartments which are 
suggested to represent the result of post-transcriptional modifications, such as 
phosphorylation and glycosylation. These modifications on MS-KIF18A were 
analyzed by bioinformatics and immunological assays. Furthermore, we studied the 
role of ubiquitin-proteasome system in the MS-KIF18A degradation. Taken 
together, the current study sheds light on MS-KIF18A a MT-dependent kinesin and 
adds insights on the post-translational modifications that potentially control 
the protein cellular distribution and its co-association with cytoskeletal 
proteins.
