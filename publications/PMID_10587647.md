Melanoma chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (MCSP) is a cell-surface antigen that 
has been implicated in the growth and invasion of melanoma tumours. Although 
this antigen is expressed early in melanoma progression, its biological function 
is unknown. MCSP can stimulate the integrin-alpha4 beta1-mediated adhesion and 
spreading of melanoma cells. Here we show that stimulated MCSP recruits 
tyrosine-phosphorylated p130 cas, an adaptor protein important in tumour cell 
motility and invasion. MCSP stimulation also results in a pronounced activation 
and recruitment of the Rho-family GTPase Cdc42. MCSP-induced spreading of 
melanoma cells is dependent upon active Cdc42, a Cdc42-associated tyrosine 
kinase (Ack-1) and tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. Furthermore, vectors 
inhibiting Ack-1 or Cdc42 expression and/or function abrogate MCSP-induced 
tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of p130cas. Our findings indicate that 
MCSP may modify tumour growth or invasion by a unique signal-transduction 
pathway that links Cdc42 activation to downstream tyrosine phosphorylation and 
subsequent cytoskeletal reorganization.
