Hsp90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone, which facilitates the activation 
and stabilization of hundreds of client proteins in cooperation with a defined 
set of cofactors. Many client proteins are protein kinases, which are activated 
and stabilized by Hsp90 in cooperation with the kinase-specific co-chaperone 
Cdc37. Other Hsp90 co-chaperones, like the ATPase activator Aha1, also are 
implicated in kinase activation, and it is not yet clear how Cdc37 is integrated 
into Hsp90 co-chaperone complexes. Here, we studied the interaction between 
Cdc37, Hsp90, and other Hsp90 co-chaperones from the nematode Caenorhabditis 
elegans. Nematode Cdc37 binds with high affinity to Hsp90 and strongly inhibits 
the ATPase activity. In contrast to the human Hsp90 system, we observed binding 
of Cdc37 to open and closed Hsp90 conformations, potentially reflecting two 
different binding modes. Using a novel ultracentrifugation setup, which allows 
accurate analysis of multifactorial protein complexes, we show that cooperative 
and competitive interactions exist between other co-chaperones and Cdc37-Hsp90 
complexes in the C. elegans system. We observed strong competitive interactions 
between Cdc37 and the co-chaperones p23 and Sti1, whereas the binding of the 
phosphatase Pph5 and the ATPase activator Aha1 to Cdc37-Hsp90 complexes is 
possible. The ternary Aha1-Cdc37-Hsp90 complex is disrupted by the 
nucleotide-induced closing reaction at the N terminus of Hsp90. This implies a 
carefully regulated exchange process of cofactors during the chaperoning of 
kinase clients by Hsp90.
