To define the functions of genes previously identified by expression profiling 
as being rapidly light induced under phytochrome (phy) control, we are 
investigating the seedling de-etiolation phenotypes of mutants carrying T-DNA 
insertional disruptions at these loci. Mutants at one such locus displayed 
reduced responsiveness to continuous red, but not continuous far-red light, 
suggesting a role in phyB signaling but not phyA signaling. Consistent with such 
a role, expression of this gene is induced by continuous red light in wild-type 
seedlings, but the level of induction is strongly reduced in phyB-null mutants. 
The locus encodes a novel protein that we show localizes to the nucleus, thus 
suggesting a function in light-regulated gene expression. Recently, this locus 
was identified as EARLY FLOWERING 4, a gene implicated in floral induction and 
regulating the expression of the gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1. Together 
with these previous data, our findings suggest that EARLY FLOWERING 4 functions 
as a signaling intermediate in phy-regulated gene expression involved in 
promotion of seedling de-etiolation, circadian clock function, and photoperiod 
perception.
