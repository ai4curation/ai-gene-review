EphB4 is a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family shown to act in 
neuronal guidance and mediate venal/arterial separation. In contrast to these 
more established roles, EphB4's function in cancer is much less clear. Here we 
illustrate both tumor promoting as well as suppressing roles of EphB4, by 
showing that its activation resulted in inhibition of the Ras/ERK pathway in 
endothelial cells but activation of the same pathway in MCF-7 breast cancer 
cells. This was true if EphB4 was stimulated with EphrinB2, its natural ligand, 
or an agonistic monoclonal antibody for EphB4. Correspondingly, EphB4 activation 
stimulated MCF7 growth while inhibiting HUVEC cell proliferation. The reason for 
these dramatic differences is due to functional coupling of EphB4 to different 
downstream effectors. Reduction of p120 RasGAP in HUVEC cells attenuated the 
inhibitory effect of EphB4 activation on the ERK pathway, whereas knockdown of 
PP2A in MCF7 cells attenuated EphB4 activation of the ERK pathway. This 
represents the first time a functional coupling between Eph receptor and PP2A 
has been demonstrated leading to activation of an oncogenic pathway. Our study 
illustrates the caveats and potential challenges of targeting EphB4 for cancer 
therapy due to the conflicting effects on cancer cell and endothelial cell 
compartments.
