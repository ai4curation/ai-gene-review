hsp82 is one of the most highly conserved and abundantly synthesized heat shock 
proteins of eucaryotic cells. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two 
closely related genes in the HSP82 gene family. HSC82 was expressed 
constitutively at a very high level and was moderately induced by high 
temperatures. HSP82 was expressed constitutively at a much lower level and was 
more strongly induced by heat. Site-directed disruption mutations were produced 
in both genes. Cells homozygous for both mutations did not grow at any 
temperature. Cells carrying other combinations of the HSP82 and HSC82 mutations 
grew well at 25 degrees C, but their ability to grow at higher temperatures 
varied with gene copy number. Thus, HSP82 and HSC82 constitute an essential gene 
family in yeast cells. Although the two proteins had different patterns of 
expression, they appeared to have equivalent functions; growth at higher 
temperatures required higher concentrations of either protein. Biochemical 
analysis of hsp82 from vertebrate cells suggests that the protein binds to a 
variety of other cellular proteins, keeping them inactive until they have 
reached their proper intracellular location or have received the proper 
activation signal. We speculate that the reason cells require higher 
concentrations of hsp82 or hsc82 for growth at higher temperatures is to 
maintain proper levels of complex formation with these other proteins.
