Ras GTPase-activating proteins negatively regulate the Ras/Erk signaling 
pathway, thereby playing crucial roles in the proliferation, function, and 
development of various types of cells. In this study, we identified a novel Ras 
GTPase-activating proteins protein, RASAL3, which is predominantly expressed in 
cells of hematopoietic lineages, including NKT, B, and T cells. We established 
systemic RASAL3-deficient mice, and the mice exhibited a severe decrease in NKT 
cells in the liver at 8 weeks of age. The treatment of RASAL3-deficient mice 
with α-GalCer, a specific agonist for NKT cells, induced liver damage, but the 
level was less severe than that in RASAL3-competent mice, and the attenuated 
liver damage was accompanied by a reduced production of interleukin-4 and 
interferon-γ from NKT cells. RASAL3-deficient NKT cells treated with α-GalCer in 
vitro presented augmented Erk phosphorylation, suggesting that there is 
dysregulated Ras signaling in the NKT cells of RASAL3-deficient mice. Taken 
together, these results suggest that RASAL3 plays an important role in the 
expansion and functions of NKT cells in the liver by negatively regulating 
Ras/Erk signaling, and might be a therapeutic target for NKT-associated 
diseases.
