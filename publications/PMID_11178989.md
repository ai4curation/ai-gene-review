Overexpression of the oncoprotein MDM2, a negative feedback regulator of p53, is 
often observed in breast cancer tissue and cell lines, particularly in those 
which express estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). In this study, we report a 
novel function of MDM2, i.e., as a positive regulator of ERalpha. This function 
does not involve p53. MDM2 overexpressing clones derived from the breast cancer 
cell line, MCF-7 cells, showed a remarkable growth advantage only in estradiol 
supplemented conditions, and this profile coincided with increased 
transcriptional activity of ERalpha in these cells. Though p53 has been reported 
to be an inhibitor of ERalpha function, p53 protein in MDM2 overexpressing 
clones was more abundant than in the parental cells. When ERalpha was 
exogenously expressed in p53-null cells, its activity was enhanced by 
coexpression of MDM2. Mammalian two-hybrid assays and GST pull-down assays 
indicated that MDM2 could interact with ERalpha. These results indicate that 
MDM2 is a direct activator of ERalpha function, and suggest such a role for MDM2 
in ERalpha-positive breast cancer.
