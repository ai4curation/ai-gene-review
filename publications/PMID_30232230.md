Studies have suggested a role for the mammalian (or mechanistic) target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) in skeletal development and homeostasis, yet there is no 
evidence connecting mTOR with the key signaling pathways that regulate 
skeletogenesis. We identified a parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide 
(PTHrP)-salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3)-mTOR signaling cascade essential for 
skeletogenesis. While investigating a new skeletal dysplasia caused by a 
homozygous mutation in the catalytic domain of SIK3, we observed decreased 
activity of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 due to accumulation of DEPTOR, a 
negative regulator of both mTOR complexes. This SIK3 syndrome shared skeletal 
features with Jansen metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC), a disorder caused by 
constitutive activation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor. JMC-derived chondrocytes 
showed reduced SIK3 activity, elevated DEPTOR, and decreased mTORC1 and mTORC2 
activity, indicating a common mechanism of disease. The data demonstrate that 
SIK3 is an essential positive regulator of mTOR signaling that functions by 
triggering DEPTOR degradation in response to PTH/PTHrP signaling during 
skeletogenesis.
