Neurofibromatosis type I is a common autosomal dominant disease characterized by 
formation of multiple benign and malignant tumors. People with this disorder 
also experience chronic pain, which can be disabling. Neurofibrinomin, the 
protein product of the NF1 gene (neurofibromin gene (human)), is a guanosine 
triphosphate activating protein for p21(ras). Loss of NF1 results in an increase 
in activity of the p21(ras) transduction cascade. Because of the growing 
evidence suggesting involvement of downstream components of the p21(ras) 
transduction cascade in the sensitization of nociceptive sensory neurons, we 
examined the stimulus-evoked release of the neuropeptides, substance P and 
calcitonin gene-related peptide, from primary sensory neurons of mice with a 
mutation of the Nf1 gene (neurofibromin gene (mouse)) (Nf1+/-). Measuring 
immunoreactive substance P and immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide by 
radioimmunoassay, we demonstrated that capsaicin-stimulated release of 
neuropeptides is three to five-fold higher in spinal cord slices from Nf1+/- 
mice than from wildtype mouse tissue. In addition, the potassium and 
capsaicin-stimulated release of immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide 
from cultures of sensory neurons isolated from Nf1+/- mice was more than double 
that from cultures of wildtype neurons. Treatment of wildtype sensory neurons 
with nerve growth factor for 5-7 days mimicked the enhanced stimulus-evoked 
release observed from the Nf1+/- neurons. When nerve growth factor was removed 
48 h before conducting release experiments, nerve growth factor-induced 
augmentation of immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide release from 
Nf1+/- neurons was more pronounced than in Nf1+/- sensory neurons that were 
treated with nerve growth factor continuously for 5-7 days. Thus, sensory 
neurons from mice with a heterozygous mutation of the Nf1 gene that is analogous 
to the human disease neurofibromatosis type I, exhibit increased sensitivity to 
chemical stimulation. This augmented responsiveness may explain the abnormal 
pain sensations experienced by people with neurofibromatosis type I and suggests 
an important role for guanosine triphosphate activating proteins, in the 
regulation of nociceptive sensory neuron sensitization.
