Mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) increases amyloid peptide production, attenuates 
capacitative calcium entry (CCE), and augments calcium release from the 
endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). Here we measured the intracellular free Ca(2+) 
concentration in hippocampal neurons from six different combinations of 
transgenic and gene-ablated mice to demonstrate that mutant PS1 attenuated CCE 
directly, independent of the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). 
On the other hand, increased Ca(2+) release from the ER in mutant PS1 neurons, 
as induced by thapsigargin, was clearly dependent on the presence of APP and its 
processing by PS1, i.e. on the generation of the amyloid peptides and the APP 
C99 fragments. This observation was corroborated by the thapsigargin-induced 
increase in cytosolic [Ca(2+)](i) in PS1 deficient neurons, which accumulate C99 
fragments due to deficient gamma-secretase activity. Moreover, co-expression of 
mutant APP[V717I] in PS1-deficient neurons further increased the apparent size 
of the ER calcium stores in parallel with increasing levels of the APP 
processing products. We conclude that mutant PS1 deregulates neuronal calcium 
homeostasis by two different actions: (i) direct attenuation of CCE at the 
cell-surface independent of APP; and (ii) indirect increase of ER-calcium stores 
via processing of APP and generation of amyloid peptides and C99 fragments.
