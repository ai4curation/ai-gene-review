beta-Catenin is a multifunctional protein that mediates Wnt signaling by binding 
to members of the T cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors. Here, we 
report an evolutionarily conserved interaction of beta-catenin with FOXO 
transcription factors, which are regulated by insulin and oxidative stress 
signaling. beta-Catenin binds directly to FOXO and enhances FOXO transcriptional 
activity in mammalian cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of the beta-catenin 
BAR-1 reduces the activity of the FOXO ortholog DAF-16 in dauer formation and 
life span. Association of beta-catenin with FOXO was enhanced in cells exposed 
to oxidative stress. Furthermore, BAR-1 was required for the oxidative 
stress-induced expression of the DAF-16 target gene sod-3 and for resistance to 
oxidative damage. These results demonstrate a role for beta-catenin in 
regulating FOXO function that is particularly important under conditions of 
oxidative stress.
