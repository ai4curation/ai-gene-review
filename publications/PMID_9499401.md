The rapid yet transient transcriptional activation of heat shock genes is 
mediated by the reversible conversion of HSF1 from an inert negatively regulated 
monomer to a transcriptionally active DNA-binding trimer. During attenuation of 
the heat shock response, transcription of heat shock genes returns to basal 
levels and HSF1 reverts to an inert monomer. These events coincide with elevated 
levels of Hsp70 and other heat shock proteins (molecular chaperones). Here, we 
show that the molecular chaperone Hsp70 and the cochaperone Hdj1 interact 
directly with the transactivation domain of HSF1 and repress heat shock gene 
transcription. Overexpression of either chaperone represses the transcriptional 
activity of a transfected GAL4-HSF1 activation domain fusion protein and 
endogenous HSF1. As neither the activation of HSF1 DNA binding nor inducible 
phosphorylation of HSF1 was affected, the primary autoregulatory role of Hsp70 
is to negatively regulate HSF1 transcriptional activity. These results reveal 
that the repression of heat shock gene transcription, which occurs during 
attenuation, is due to the association of Hsp70 with the HSF1 transactivation 
domain, thus providing a plausible explanation for the role of molecular 
chaperones in at least one key step in the autoregulation of the heat shock 
response.
