A 2.75-year-old Chinese boy presented with typical clinical features of 
pseudoachondroplasia, including disproportionate short-limb short stature, 
brachydactyly, genu varus and waddling gait. Radiologically, tubular bones were 
short with widened metaphyses, irregular and small epiphyses; anterior tonguing 
or beaking of vertebral bodies were characteristic. DNA sequencing analysis of 
the COMP gene revealed a heterozygous mutation (c.1511G>A, p.Cys504Tyr) in the 
patient but his parents were unaffected without this genetic change. The 
missense mutation (c.1511G>A) was not found in 100 healthy controls and has not 
been reported previously. Our findings expand the spectrum of known mutations in 
COMP leading to pseudoachondroplasia.
