Ca(V)1.1 is the prototype for the other nine known Ca(V) channel isoforms, yet 
it has functional properties that make it truly atypical of this group. 
Specifically, Ca(V)1.1 is expressed solely in skeletal muscle where it serves 
multiple purposes; it is the voltage sensor for excitation-contraction coupling 
and it is an L-type Ca²⁺ channel which contributes to a form of 
activity-dependent Ca²⁺ entry that has been termed Excitation-coupled Ca²⁺ 
entry. The ability of Ca(V)1.1 to serve as voltage-sensor for 
excitation-contraction coupling appears to be unique among Ca(V) channels, 
whereas the physiological role of its more conventional function as a Ca²⁺ 
channel has been a matter of uncertainty for nearly 50 years. In this chapter, 
we discuss how Ca(V)1.1 supports excitation-contraction coupling, the possible 
relevance of Ca²⁺ entry through Ca(V)1.1 and how alterations of Ca(V)1.1 
function can have pathophysiological consequences. This article is part of a 
Special Issue entitled: Calcium channels.
