The Golgi apparatus is the central organelle in the secretory pathway and plays 
key roles in glycosylation, protein sorting, and secretion in plants. Enzymes 
involved in the biosynthesis of complex polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and 
glycolipids are located in this organelle, but the majority of them remain 
uncharacterized. Here, we studied the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) 
membrane proteome with a focus on the Golgi apparatus using localization of 
organelle proteins by isotope tagging. By applying multivariate data analysis to 
a combined data set of two new and two previously published localization of 
organelle proteins by isotope tagging experiments, we identified the subcellular 
localization of 1,110 proteins with high confidence. These include 197 Golgi 
apparatus proteins, 79 of which have not been localized previously by a 
high-confidence method, as well as the localization of 304 endoplasmic reticulum 
and 208 plasma membrane proteins. Comparison of the hydrophobic domains of the 
localized proteins showed that the single-span transmembrane domains have unique 
properties in each organelle. Many of the novel Golgi-localized proteins belong 
to uncharacterized protein families. Structure-based homology analysis 
identified 12 putative Golgi glycosyltransferase (GT) families that have no 
functionally characterized members and, therefore, are not yet assigned to a 
Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database GT family. The substantial numbers of these 
putative GTs lead us to estimate that the true number of plant Golgi GTs might 
be one-third above those currently annotated. Other newly identified proteins 
are likely to be involved in the transport and interconversion of nucleotide 
sugar substrates as well as polysaccharide and protein modification.

Abstract

The Golgi apparatus is the central organelle in the secretory pathway and plays key roles in glycosylation, protein sorting, and secretion in plants. Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of complex polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids are located in this organelle, but the majority of them remain uncharacterized. Here, we studied the Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) membrane proteome with a focus on the Golgi apparatus using localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging. By applying multivariate data analysis to a combined data set of two new and two previously published localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging experiments, we identified the subcellular localization of 1,110 proteins with high confidence. These include 197 Golgi apparatus proteins, 79 of which have not been localized previously by a high-confidence method, as well as the localization of 304 endoplasmic reticulum and 208 plasma membrane proteins. Comparison of the hydrophobic domains of the localized proteins showed that the single-span transmembrane domains have unique properties in each organelle. Many of the novel Golgi-localized proteins belong to uncharacterized protein families. Structure-based homology analysis identified 12 putative Golgi glycosyltransferase ( GT ) families that have no functionally characterized members and, therefore, are not yet assigned to a Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database GT family. The substantial numbers of these putative GTs lead us to estimate that the true number of plant Golgi GTs might be one-third above those currently annotated. Other newly identified proteins are likely to be involved in the transport and interconversion of nucleotide sugar substrates as well as polysaccharide and protein modification.

CONCLUSION

The localization of over 1,100 plant membrane proteins will be an invaluable resource for the community and allow in-depth analysis of many organelle properties and functions. For example, the identification here of differences in TMD properties between the ER , Golgi, and PM proteins will allow better prediction of novel protein localization as well as facilitate studies of protein targeting. The currently identified GTs are insufficient to synthesize all the cell wall carbohydrate structures produced by plants. We identified 12 biochemically uncharacterized Golgi putative GT families, extending substantially the number of targets for functional studies that are now under way in our laboratory. We believe that these results will greatly contribute to the understanding of plant cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis.
