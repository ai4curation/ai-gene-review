Interferon-α (IFNα) signaling is essential for antiviral response via induction 
of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Through a non-biased high-throughput RNAi 
screening of 711 known epigenetic modifiers in cellular models of IFNα-mediated 
inhibition of HBV replication, we identified methyltransferase SETD2 as a 
critical amplifier of IFNα-mediated antiviral immunity. Conditional knockout 
mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Setd2 exhibit enhanced HBV infection. 
Mechanistically, SETD2 directly mediates STAT1 methylation on lysine 525 via its 
methyltransferase activity, which reinforces IFN-activated STAT1 phosphorylation 
and antiviral cellular response. In addition, SETD2 selectively catalyzes the 
tri-methylation of H3K36 on promoters of some ISGs such as ISG15, leading to 
gene activation. Our study identifies STAT1 methylation on K525 catalyzed by the 
methyltransferase SETD2 as an essential signaling event for IFNα-dependent 
antiviral immunity and indicates potential of SETD2 in controlling viral 
infections.
