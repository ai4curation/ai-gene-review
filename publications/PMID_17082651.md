Angiogenesis is a multistep complex phenomenon critical for several inflammatory 
and neoplastic disorders. Basophils, normally confined to peripheral blood, can 
infiltrate the sites of chronic inflammation. In an attempt to obtain insights 
into the mechanism(s) underlying human basophil chemotaxis and its role in 
inflammation, we have characterized the expression and function of vascular 
endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors in these cells. Basophils 
express mRNA for three isoforms of VEGF-A (121, 165, and 189) and two isoforms 
of VEGF-B (167 and 186). Peripheral blood and basophils in nasal polyps contain 
VEGF-A localized in secretory granules. The concentration of VEGF-A in basophils 
was 144.4 +/- 10.8 pg/10(6) cells. Immunologic activation of basophils induced 
the release of VEGF-A. VEGF-A (10-500 ng/ml) induced basophil chemotaxis. 
Supernatants of activated basophils induced an angiogenic response in the chick 
embryo chorioallantoic membrane that was inhibited by an anti-VEGF-A Ab. The 
tyrosine kinase VEGFR-2 (VEGFR-2/KDR) mRNA was expressed in basophils. These 
cells also expressed mRNA for the soluble form of VEGFR-1 and neuropilin (NRP)1 
and NRP2. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that basophils express epitopes 
recognized by mAbs against the extracellular domains of VEGFR-2, NRP1, and NRP2. 
Our data suggest that basophils could play a role in angiogenesis and 
inflammation through the expression of several forms of VEGF and their 
receptors.
