The yeast two-hybrid screening method was used to identify novel proteins that 
associate with human DNA polymerase delta (pol delta). Two baits were used in 
this study. These were the large (p125) and small (p50) subunits of the core pol 
delta heterodimer. p50 was the only positive isolated with p125 as the bait. Two 
novel protein partners, named PDIP38 and PDIP46, were identified from the p50 
screen. In this study, the interaction of PDIP38 with pol delta was further 
characterized. PDIP38 encodes a protein of 368 amino acids whose C terminus is 
conserved with the bacterial APAG protein and with the F box A protein. It was 
found that PDIP38 also interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). 
The ability of PDIP38 to interact with both the p50 subunit of pol delta and 
with PCNA was confirmed by pull-down assays using glutathione S-transferase 
(GST)-PDIP38 fusion proteins. The PCNA-PDIP38 interaction was also demonstrated 
by PCNA overlay experiments. The association of PDIP38 with pol delta was shown 
to occur in calf thymus tissue and mammalian cell extracts by GST-PDIP38 
pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. PDIP38 was associated with pol 
delta isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography. The association of PDIP38 with 
pol delta could also be demonstrated by native gel electrophoresis.
