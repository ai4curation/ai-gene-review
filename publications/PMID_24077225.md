The biogenesis of integral outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) in Gram-negative 
bacteria requires molecular chaperones that prevent the aggregation of OMP 
polypeptides in the aqueous periplasmic space. How these energy-independent 
chaperones interact with their substrates is not well understood. We have used 
high-resolution NMR spectroscopy to examine the conformation and dynamics of the 
Escherichia coli periplasmic chaperone Skp and two of its complexes with OMPs. 
The Skp trimer constitutes a flexible architectural scaffold that becomes more 
rigid upon substrate binding. The OMP substrates populate a dynamic 
conformational ensemble with structural interconversion rates on the 
submillisecond timescale. The global lifetime of the chaperone-substrate complex 
is seven orders of magnitude longer, emerging from the short local lifetimes by 
avidity. The dynamic state allows for energy-independent substrate release and 
provides a general paradigm for the conformation of OMP polypeptides bound to 
energy-independent chaperones.
