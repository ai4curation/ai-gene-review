APP, amyloid beta precursor protein, is linked to the onset of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). We have here found that transforming growth factor beta2 
(TGFbeta2), but not TGFbeta1, binds to APP. The binding affinity of TGFbeta2 to 
APP is lower than the binding affinity of TGFbeta2 to the TGFbeta receptor. On 
binding to APP, TGFbeta2 activates an APP-mediated death pathway via 
heterotrimeric G protein G(o), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, NADPH oxidase, and 
caspase 3 and/or related caspases. Overall degrees of TGFbeta2-induced death are 
larger in cells expressing a familial AD-related mutant APP than in those 
expressing wild-type APP. Consequently, superphysiological concentrations of 
TGFbeta2 induce neuronal death in primary cortical neurons, whose one allele of 
the APP gene is knocked in with the V642I mutation. Combined with the finding 
indicated by several earlier reports that both neural and glial expression of 
TGFbeta2 was upregulated in AD brains, it is speculated that TGFbeta2 may 
contribute to the development of AD-related neuronal cell death.
