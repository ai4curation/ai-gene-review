Cyclin E, a partner of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2, has been implicated in 
positive control of the G1/S phase transition. Whereas degradation of cyclin E 
has been shown to be exquisitely regulated by ubiquitination and proteasomal 
action, little is known about posttranscriptional aspects of its biogenesis. In 
a yeast-based screen designed to identify human proteins that interact with 
human cyclin E, we identified components of the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin 
CCT. We found that the endogenous CCT complex in yeast was essential for the 
maturation of cyclin E in vivo. Under conditions of impaired CCT function, 
cyclin E failed to accumulate. Furthermore, newly translated cyclin E, both in 
vitro in reticulocyte lysate and in vivo in human cells in culture, is 
efficiently bound and processed by the CCT. In vitro, in the presence of ATP, 
the bound protein is folded and released in order to become associated with 
Cdk2. Thus, both the acquisition of the native state and turnover of cyclin E 
involve ATP-dependent processes mediated by large oligomeric assemblies.

Abstract

Cyclin E, a partner of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2, has been implicated in positive control of the G 1 /S phase transition. Whereas degradation of cyclin E has been shown to be exquisitely regulated by ubiquitination and proteasomal action, little is known about posttranscriptional aspects of its biogenesis. In a yeast-based screen designed to identify human proteins that interact with human cyclin E, we identified components of the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin CCT. We found that the endogenous CCT complex in yeast was essential for the maturation of cyclin E in vivo. Under conditions of impaired CCT function, cyclin E failed to accumulate. Furthermore, newly translated cyclin E, both in vitro in reticulocyte lysate and in vivo in human cells in culture, is efficiently bound and processed by the CCT. In vitro, in the presence of ATP, the bound protein is folded and released in order to become associated with Cdk2. Thus, both the acquisition of the native state and turnover of cyclin E involve ATP-dependent processes mediated by large oligomeric assemblies.

DISCUSSION

To date, the CCT complex has been shown to mediate the ATP-dependent folding of only a limited set of proteins in vivo—tubulin, actin, and α-transducin. These proteins do not show any significant amino acid sequence similarity, nor do they share a common fold. Cyclin E, likewise, does not bear any recognizable primary structural similarity to the other known CCT substrates. Notably, however, all four of these proteins are known to be aggregation prone when expressed in bacterial systems or when subjected to refolding from denaturant in vitro. Thus, exposure of hydrophobic surfaces in the nonnative state may be a significant shared feature of recognition of these proteins by CCT, as it is for the bacterial chaperonin, GroEL ( 1 ). On the other hand, CCT in general does not efficiently bind GroEL substrates following their dilution from denaturant, for example ( 26 ). Thus, there must be additional features of recognition in addition to, or other than, exposed hydrophobic surfaces, which are operative in recognition by this machinery. Perhaps the heterologous nature of the eight different CCT apical domains, corresponding to eight different subunits, contributes to such specificity. In any case, here, as with other heterooligomeric proteins whose subunit folding is assisted by chaperonin, CCT-mediated folding of cyclin E precedes the step of oligomerization with its partner protein, Cdk2. In the present case, in contrast to α and β tubulins, both of which require CCT action, Cdk2 does not appear to require the action of CCT for acquisition of its native state. However, folding of cyclin E by the CCT appears to be a prerequisite for Cdk2 binding, as cyclin E associated with the CCT is not associated with Cdk2.

The findings reported here of involvement of the CCT in biogenesis of cyclin E complement previous studies showing the involvement of another complex, the proteasome, in the ubiquitin-mediated turnover of cyclin E. It remains to be understood exactly what conformational features of the same primary cyclin E sequence are recognized by CCT early after translation, leading to production of the native state and assembly with Cdk2, as opposed to those recognized by the ubiquitin conjugation machinery after the G 1 /S transition, leading to proteasome-mediated proteolysis.

The genetic interaction between cyclin E and components of the CCT was discovered because expression of individual human CCT subunits was able to rescue the lethality associated with cyclin E overexpression in yeast, presumably by interfering with some aspect of cyclin E biogenesis or function. This result would seem to be at odds with the notion that CCT function is associated with folding and maturation of cyclin E into an active form. However, we propose two models that might provide resolution to this apparent paradox. Firstly, human CCT components, when expressed in yeast might be coassembled into the endogenous CCT, acting as poison or dominant negative subunits. Reducing the efficiency of the endogenous CCT in this manner might interfere with the maturation of cyclin E, accounting for the rescue of cyclin E-associated toxicity. Consistent with this interpretation, human CCT subunits coeluted with endogenous high-molecular-weight CCT complexes when yeast extracts expressing the recombinant human protein were subjected to gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). Secondly, excess monomeric human CCT subunits might have the capacity to bind and sequester cyclin E in a nonfunctional state, thereby reducing the functional level of cyclin E and accounting for the rescue of cyclin E-associated toxicity. Although gel filtration profiles revealed elution patterns consistent with CCT subunit-cyclin E heterodimer formation, the steady-state levels of such complexes were relatively low (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that such complexes exist at much high levels in vivo and dissociate upon lysis and preparation of extracts. Therefore, further investigation is required to choose from between these models or additional models in order to explain our initial genetic observations linking cyclin E to the CCT.
