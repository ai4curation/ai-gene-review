Two B-type cyclins, B1 and B2, have been identified in mammals. Proliferating 
cells express both cyclins, which bind to and activate p34(cdc2). To test 
whether the two B-type cyclins have distinct roles, we generated lines of 
transgenic mice, one lacking cyclin B1 and the other lacking cyclin B2. Cyclin 
B1 proved to be an essential gene; no homozygous B1-null pups were born. In 
contrast, nullizygous B2 mice developed normally and did not display any obvious 
abnormalities. Both male and female cyclin B2-null mice were fertile, which was 
unexpected in view of the high levels and distinct patterns of expression of 
cyclin B2 during spermatogenesis. We show that the expression of cyclin B1 
overlaps the expression of cyclin B2 in the mature testis, but not vice versa. 
Cyclin B1 can be found both on intracellular membranes and free in the 
cytoplasm, in contrast to cyclin B2, which is membrane-associated. These 
observations suggest that cyclin B1 may compensate for the loss of cyclin B2 in 
the mutant mice, and implies that cyclin B1 is capable of targeting the 
p34(cdc2) kinase to the essential substrates of cyclin B2.
