Damaged mitochondria are eliminated by mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy 
whose dysfunction associates with neurodegenerative diseases. PINK1, PARKIN and 
p62/SQTMS1 have been shown to regulate mitophagy, leaving hitherto ill-defined 
the contribution by key players in 'general' autophagy. In basal conditions, a 
pool of AMBRA1 - an upstream autophagy regulator and a PARKIN interactor - is 
present at the mitochondria, where its pro-autophagic activity is inhibited by 
Bcl-2. Here we show that, upon mitophagy induction, AMBRA1 binds the 
autophagosome adapter LC3 through a LIR (LC3 interacting region) motif, this 
interaction being crucial for regulating both canonical PARKIN-dependent and 
-independent mitochondrial clearance. Moreover, forcing AMBRA1 localization to 
the outer mitochondrial membrane unleashes a massive PARKIN- and p62-independent 
but LC3-dependent mitophagy. These results highlight a novel role for AMBRA1 as 
a powerful mitophagy regulator, through both canonical or noncanonical pathways.
