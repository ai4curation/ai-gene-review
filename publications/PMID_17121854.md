Fe65 interacts with the cytosolic domain of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor 
protein (APP). The functions of the Fe65 are still unknown. To address this 
point we generated Fe65 knockout (KO) mice. These mice do not show any obvious 
phenotype; however, when fibroblasts (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), isolated 
from Fe65 KO embryos, were exposed to low doses of DNA damaging agents, such as 
etoposide or H2O2, an increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress, compared with 
wild type animals, clearly emerged. Accordingly, brain extracts from Fe65 KO 
mice, exposed to non-lethal doses of ionizing radiations, showed high levels of 
gamma-H2AX and p53, thus demonstrating a higher sensitivity to X-rays than wild 
type mice. Nuclear Fe65 is necessary to rescue the observed phenotype, and few 
minutes after the exposure of MEFs to DNA damaging agents, Fe65 undergoes 
phosphorylation in the nucleus. With a similar timing, the proteolytic 
processing of APP is rapidly affected by the genotoxic stress: in fact, the 
cleavage of the APP COOH-terminal fragments by gamma-secretase is induced soon 
after the exposure of cells to etoposide, in a Fe65-dependent manner. These 
results demonstrate that Fe65 plays an essential role in the response of the 
cells to DNA damage.
