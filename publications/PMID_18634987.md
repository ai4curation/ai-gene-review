OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of angio-associated 
migratory cell protein (AAMP) for the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells 
(SMCs) and for the development of neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury.
BACKGROUND: Although AAMP has been shown to participate in angiogenesis and 
cancerogenesis and is predominantly expressed in cells with a migratory 
phenotype, involvement of AAMP during neointima (NI) formation after arterial 
injury has not been analyzed previously.
METHODS: The AAMP content in SMCs was examined using 2-photon laser-scanning 
microscopy and subcellular fractioning. Migratory potential of SMCs transiently 
transfected with AAMP expression vectors, transfected with small interfering 
ribonucleic acid (siRNA), or treated with antirecombinant angio-associated 
migratory cell protein-antibody (anti-rAAMP-ab) was examined using transwell 
migration chamber assays. Expression of AAMP was determined in the atherogenic 
apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mouse model and in the porcine coronary 
restenosis model by immunohistochemistry and by Western blot. ApoE(-/-) mice 
were treated intraperitoneally with anti-rAAMP-ab, and wire-injured carotid 
arteries were examined.
RESULTS: Angio-associated migratory cell protein is localized in the membrane of 
SMCs, and its expression is enhanced in NI-derived SMCs. The AAMP overexpression 
increases, while both treatment with anti-rAAMP-ab and transfection with siRNA 
decreases SMC migration. Knockdown of AAMP decreases RhoA activity in the 
membrane fraction of SMCs. The AAMP expression by SMCs is enhanced in both 
animal models. Anti-rAAMP-ab reduces neointimal SMC density at 1 week and NI 
formation at 4 weeks in apoE(-/-) mice without affecting proliferation of SMCs.
CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal an important functional role of AAMP in the 
migration of SMCs, identifying AAMP as a potential target to limit lesion 
formation after injury.
