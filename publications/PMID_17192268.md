CEACAM1-4S (carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1, with 4 
ectodomains and a short, 12-14 amino acid cytoplasmic domain) mediates lumen 
formation via an apoptotic and cytoskeletal reorganization mechanism when 
mammary epithelial cells are grown in a three-dimensional model of mammary 
morphogenesis. We show by quantitative yeast two-hybrid, BIAcore, NMR HSQC and 
STD, and confocal analyses that amino acids phenylalanine (Phe(454)) and lysine 
(Lys(456)) are key residues that interact with actin orchestrating the 
cytoskeletal reorganization. A CEACAM1 membrane model based on vitamin D-binding 
protein that predicts an interaction of Phe(454) at subdomain 3 of actin was 
supported by inhibition of binding of actin to vitamin D-binding protein by the 
cytoplasmic domain peptide. We also show that residues Thr(457) and/or Ser(459) 
are phosphorylated in CEACAM1-transfected cells grown in three-dimensional 
culture and that mutation analysis of these residues (T457A/S459A) or F454A 
blocks lumen formation. These studies demonstrate that a short cytoplasmic 
domain membrane receptor can directly mediate substantial intracellular 
signaling.
