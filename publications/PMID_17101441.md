Mass spectrometry-based approaches are commonly used to identify proteins from 
multiprotein complexes, typically with the goal of identifying new complex 
members or identifying post-translational modifications. However, with the 
recent demonstration that spectral counting is a powerful quantitative proteomic 
approach, the analysis of multiprotein complexes by mass spectrometry can be 
reconsidered in certain cases. Using the chromatography-based approach named 
multidimensional protein identification technology, multiprotein complexes may 
be analyzed quantitatively using the normalized spectral abundance factor that 
allows comparison of multiple independent analyses of samples. This study 
describes an approach to visualize multiprotein complex datasets that provides 
structure function information that is superior to tabular lists of data. In 
this method review, we describe a reanalysis of the Rpd3/Sin3 small and large 
histone deacetylase complexes previously described in a tabular form to 
demonstrate the normalized spectral abundance factor approach.
