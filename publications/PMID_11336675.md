Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) controls the daily rhythm in melatonin 
synthesis. When isolated from tissue, AANAT copurifies with isoforms epsilon and 
zeta of 14-3-3. We have determined the structure of AANAT bound to 14-3-3zeta, 
an association that is phosphorylation dependent. AANAT is bound in the central 
channel of the 14-3-3zeta dimer, and is held in place by extensive interactions 
both with the amphipathic phosphopeptide binding groove of 14-3-3zeta and with 
other parts of the central channel. Thermodynamic and activity measurements, 
together with crystallographic analysis, indicate that binding of AANAT by 
14-3-3zeta modulates AANAT's activity and affinity for its substrates by 
stabilizing a region of AANAT involved in substrate binding.
