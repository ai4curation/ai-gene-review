Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is thought to exert its effects on cell 
growth, adhesion, and migration by mechanisms involving proteolysis and 
interaction with its cell surface receptor (uPAR). The functional properties of 
uPA and the significance of its various domains for chemotactic activity were 
analyzed using human airway smooth muscle cells (hAWSMC). The wild-type uPA 
(r-uPAwt), inactive urokinase with single mutation (His(204) to Gln) 
(r-uPA(H/Q)), urokinase with mutation of His(204) to Gln together with a 
deletion of growth factor-like domain (r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD), the catalytic domain of 
urokinase (r-uPA(LMW)), and its kringle domain (r-KD) were expressed in 
Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that glycosylated uPA, r-uPAwt, r-uPA(H/Q), and 
r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD elicited similar chemotactic effects. Half-maximal chemotaxis 
(EC(50)) were apparent at approximately 2 nm with all the uPA variants. The 
kringle domain induced cell migration with an EC(50) of about 6 nm, whereas the 
denaturated r-KD and r-uPA(LMW) were without effect. R-uPAwt-induced chemotaxis 
was dependent on an association with uPAR and a uPA-kringle domain-binding site, 
determined using a monoclonal uPAR antibody to prevent the uPA-uPAR interaction, 
and a monoclonal antibody to the uPA-kringle domain. The binding of iodinated 
r-uPAwt with hAWSMC was due to interaction with a high affinity binding site on 
the uPAR, and a lower affinity binding site on an unidentified cell surface 
target, which was mediated exclusively through the kringle domain of urokinase. 
Specific binding of r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD to hAWSMC involved an interaction with a 
single site whose characteristics were similar to those of the low affinity site 
of r-uPAwt binding to hAWSMC. uPAR-deficient HEK 293 cells specifically bound 
r-uPAwt and r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD via a single, similar type of binding site. These 
cells migrated when stimulated by r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD and uPAwt, but not r-uPA(LMW). 
HEK 293 cells transfected with the uPAR cDNA expressed two classes of sites that 
bound r-uPAwt; however, only a single site was responsible for the binding of 
r-uPA(H/Q)-GFD. Together, these findings indicate that uPA-induced chemotaxis is 
dependent on the binding of the uPA-kringle to the membrane surface of cells and 
the association of uPA with uPAR.
