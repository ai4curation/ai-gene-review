Proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) play diverse functions in 
regulating gene expression in the cell. Many of these proteins interact with 
cytoplasmic ribosomes. However, the molecular functions related to the 
interactions are largely unclear. In this study, using an abundant RNA-binding 
protein, Sbp1, with a structurally well-defined RNA recognition motif and an 
intrinsically disordered RGG domain as a model system, we investigated how an 
RNA binding protein with IDR modulates mRNA storage and translation. Using 
genomic and molecular approaches, we show that Sbp1 slows ribosome movement on 
cellular mRNAs and promotes polysome stacking or aggregation. Sbp1-associated 
polysomes display a ring-shaped structure in addition to a beads-on-string 
morphology visualized under the electron microscope, likely to be an 
intermediate slow translation state between actively translating polysomes and 
the translation-sequestered RNA granule. Moreover, the binding of Sbp1 to the 
5'UTRs of mRNAs represses both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation 
initiation of proteins, many are functionally important for general protein 
synthesis in the cell. Finally, post-translational modifications at the arginine 
in the RGG motif change the Sbp1 protein interactome and play important roles in 
directing cellular mRNAs to either translation or storage. Taken together, our 
study demonstrates that under physiological conditions, intrinsically disordered 
RNA binding proteins promote polysome aggregation and regulate mRNA translation 
and storage using multiple distinctive mechanisms. This research also 
establishes a framework with which functions of other IDR-containing proteins 
can be investigated and defined.
