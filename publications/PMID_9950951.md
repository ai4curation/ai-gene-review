Tight regulation of the rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis is critical 
for normal nephrogenesis. Nephrogenesis is profoundly affected by the loss of 
bcl-2 expression. Bcl-2-deficient (bcl-2 -/-) mice are born with renal 
hypoplasia and succumb to renal failure secondary to renal multicystic disease. 
Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions impact tissue architecture by modulating 
cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. E-cadherin 
mediates calcium-dependent homotypic cell-cell interactions that are stabilized 
by its association with catenins and the actin cytoskeleton. The contribution of 
altered cell-cell interactions to renal cystic disease has not been delineated. 
Cystic kidneys from bcl-2 -/- mice displayed nuclear localization of 
beta-catenin and loss of apical brush border actin staining. The protein levels 
of alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, actin, and E-cadherin were not altered in cystic 
kidneys compared with normal kidneys. Therefore, an altered distribution of 
beta-catenin and actin, in kidneys from bcl-2 -/- mice, may indicate improper 
cell-cell interactions interfering with renal maturation and contributing to 
renal cyst formation.
