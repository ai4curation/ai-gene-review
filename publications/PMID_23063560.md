Facilitated binding of p53 to DNA by high mobility group B1 (HMGB1) may involve 
interaction between the N-terminal region of p53 and the high mobility group 
(HMG) boxes, as well as HMG-induced bending of the DNA. Intramolecular shielding 
of the boxes by the HMGB1 acidic tail results in an unstable complex with p53 
until the tail is truncated to half its length, at which point the A box, 
proposed to be the preferred binding site for p53(1-93), is exposed, leaving the 
B box to bind and bend DNA. The A box interacts with residues 38-61 (TAD2) of 
the p53 transactivation domain. Residues 19-26 (TAD1) bind weakly, but only in 
the context of p53(1-93) and not as a free TAD1 peptide. We have solved the 
structure of the A-box/p53(1-93) complex by nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy. The incipient amphipathic helix in TAD2 recognizes the concave 
DNA-binding face of the A box and may be acting as a single-stranded DNA mimic.
