A metabolic isotope-labeling strategy was used in conjunction with nano-liquid 
chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry peptide sequencing to 
assess quantitative alterations in the expression patterns of subunits within 
cellulosomes of the cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum, grown on 
either cellulose or cellobiose. In total, 41 cellulosomal proteins were 
detected, including 36 type I dockerin-containing proteins, which count among 
them all but three of the known docking components and 16 new subunits. All 
differential expression data were normalized to the scaffoldin CipA such that 
protein per cellulosome was compared for growth between the two substrates. 
Proteins that exhibited higher expression in cellulosomes from cellulose-grown 
cells than in cellobiose-grown cells were the cell surface anchor protein OlpB, 
exoglucanases CelS and CelK, and the glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) 
endoglucanase CelJ. Conversely, lower expression in cellulosomes from cells 
grown on cellulose than on cellobiose was observed for the GH8 endoglucanase 
CelA; GH5 endoglucanases CelB, CelE, CelG; and hemicellulases XynA, XynC, XynZ, 
and XghA. GH9 cellulases were the most abundant group of enzymes per CipA when 
cells were grown on cellulose, while hemicellulases were the most abundant group 
on cellobiose. The results support the existing theory that expression of 
scaffoldin-related proteins is coordinately regulated by a catabolite repression 
type of mechanism, as well as the prior observation that xylanase expression is 
subject to a growth rate-independent type of regulation. However, concerning 
transcriptional control of cellulases, which had also been previously shown to 
be subject to catabolite repression, a novel distinction was observed with 
respect to endoglucanases.
