Genomic amplification at 20q11-13 is a common event in human cancers. We 
isolated a germline translocation breakpoint at 20q11 from a bladder cancer 
patient. We identified CDC91L1, the gene encoding CDC91L1 (also called 
phosphatidylinositol glycan class U (PIG-U), a transamidase complex unit in the 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring pathway), as the only gene whose 
expression was affected by the translocation. CDC91L1 was amplified and 
overexpressed in about one-third of bladder cancer cell lines and primary 
tumors, as well as in oncogenic uroepithelial cells transformed with human 
papillomavirus (HPV) E7. Forced overexpression of CDC91L1 malignantly 
transformed NIH3T3 cells in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of CDC91L1 also 
resulted in upregulation of the urokinase receptor (uPAR), a GPI-anchored 
protein, and in turn increased STAT-3 phosphorylation in bladder cancer cells. 
Our findings suggest that CDC91L1 is an oncogene in bladder cancer, and 
implicate the GPI anchoring system as a potential oncogenic pathway and 
therapeutic target in human cancers.
