Intraneuronal deposition of aggregated proteins in tauopathies, Parkinson 
disease, or familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) 
leads to impaired protein homeostasis (proteostasis). FENIB represents a 
conformational dementia, caused by intraneuronal polymerization of mutant 
variants of the serine protease inhibitor neuroserpin. In contrast to the 
aggregation process, the kinetic relationship between neuronal proteostasis and 
aggregation are poorly understood. To address aggregate formation dynamics, we 
studied FENIB in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. Point mutations causing FENIB 
also result in aggregation of the neuroserpin homolog SRP-2 most likely within 
the ER lumen in worms, recapitulating morphological and biochemical features of 
the human disease. Intriguingly, we identified conserved protein quality control 
pathways to modulate protein aggregation both in worms and mice. Specifically, 
downregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways in the worm 
favors mutant SRP-2 accumulation, while mice overexpressing a polymerizing 
mutant of neuroserpin undergo transient induction of the UPR in young but not in 
aged mice. Thus, we find that perturbations of proteostasis through impairment 
of the heat shock response or altered UPR signaling enhance neuroserpin 
accumulation in vivo. Moreover, accumulation of neuroserpin polymers in mice is 
associated with an age-related induction of the UPR suggesting a novel 
interaction between aging and ER overload. These data suggest that targets aimed 
at increasing UPR capacity in neurons are valuable tools for therapeutic 
intervention.
