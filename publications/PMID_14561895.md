Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) regulates IGF bioactivity 
and also independently modulates cell growth and survival. By using a yeast 
two-hybrid screen to identify IGFBP-3-interacting proteins, we cloned humanin 
(HN) as an IGFBP-3-binding partner. HN is a 24-aa peptide that has been shown to 
specifically inhibit neuronal cell death induced by familial Alzheimer's disease 
mutant genes and amyloid-beta (Abeta). The physical interaction of HN with 
IGFBP-3 was determined to be of high affinity and specificity and was confirmed 
by yeast mating, displaceable pull-down experiments with (His)-6-tagged HN, and 
ligand blot experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation of IGFBP-3 and HN from mouse 
testes confirmed the interaction in vivo. In cross-linking experiments, HN bound 
IGFBP-3 but did not compete with IGF-I-IGFBP-3 binding; competitive ligand dot 
blot experiments revealed the 18-aa heparin-binding domain of IGFBP-3 as the 
binding site for HN. Alanine scanning determined that F6A-HN mutant does not 
bind IGFBP-3. HN but not F6A-HN inhibited IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis in human 
glioblastoma-A172. In contrast, HN did not suppress IGFBP-3 response in SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma and mouse cortical primary neurons. In primary neurons, IGFBP-3 
markedly potentiated HN rescue ability from Abeta1-43 toxicity. In summary, we 
have identified an interaction between the survival peptide HN and IGFBP-3 that 
is pleiotrophic in nature and is capable of both synergistic and antagonistic 
interaction. This interaction may prove to be important in neurological disease 
processes and could provide important targets for drug development.
