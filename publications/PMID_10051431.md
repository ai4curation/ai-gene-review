Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases 
(JNKs, or stress-activated protein kinases) are activated by diverse 
extracellular signals and mediate a variety of cellular responses, including 
mitogenesis, differentiation, hypertrophy, inflammatory reactions and apoptosis. 
We have examined the involvement of Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC) in ERK and 
JNK activation by the human G-protein-coupled m2 and m3 muscarinic acetylcholine 
receptors (mAChR) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We show that 
the Ca2+-mobilizing m3 AChR is efficiently coupled to JNK and ERK activation, 
whereas the m2 AChR activates ERK but not JNK. Activation of JNK in CHO-m3 cells 
by the agonist methacholine (MCh) was delayed in onset and more sustained 
relative to that of ERK in either CHO-m2 or CHO-m3 cells. The EC50 values for 
MCh-induced ERK activation in both cell types were essentially identical and 
similar to that for JNK activation in CHO-m3 cells, suggesting little 
amplification of the response. Agonist-stimulated Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation in 
CHO-m3 cells was insensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX), consistent with a 
Gq/phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-beta mediated pathway, whereas a 
significant component of ERK and JNK activation in CHO-m3 cells was 
PTX-sensitive, indicating Gi/o involvement. Using manipulations that prevent 
receptor-mediated extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+-store 
release, we also show that ERK activation by m2 and m3 receptors is 
Ca2+-independent. In contrast, a significant component (>50%) of JNK activation 
mediated by the m3 AChR was dependent on Ca2+, mainly derived from extracellular 
influx. PKC inhibition and down-regulation studies suggested that JNK activation 
was negatively regulated by PKC. Conversely, ERK activation by both m2 and m3 
AChRs required PKC, suggesting a novel mechanism for PKC activation by 
PTX-sensitive m2 AChRs. In summary, mAChRs activate JNK and ERK via divergent 
mechanisms involving either Ca2+ or PKC respectively.

Abstract

Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs, or stress-activated protein kinases) are activated by diverse extracellular signals and mediate a variety of cellular responses, including mitogenesis, differentiation, hypertrophy, inflammatory reactions and apoptosis. We have examined the involvement of Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC) in ERK and JNK activation by the human G-protein-coupled m2 and m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We show that the Ca2+-mobilizing m3 AChR is efficiently coupled to JNK and ERK activation, whereas the m2 AChR activates ERK but not JNK. Activation of JNK in CHO-m3 cells by the agonist methacholine (MCh) was delayed in onset and more sustained relative to that of ERK in either CHO-m2 or CHO-m3 cells. The EC50 values for MCh-induced ERK activation in both cell types were essentially identical and similar to that for JNK activation in CHO-m3 cells, suggesting little amplification of the response. Agonist-stimulated Ins(1,4,5)P3 accumulation in CHO-m3 cells was insensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX), consistent with a Gq/phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-beta mediated pathway, whereas a significant component of ERK and JNK activation in CHO-m3 cells was PTX-sensitive, indicating Gi/o involvement. Using manipulations that prevent receptor-mediated extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+-store release, we also show that ERK activation by m2 and m3 receptors is Ca2+-independent. In contrast, a significant component (>50%) of JNK activation mediated by the m3 AChR was dependent on Ca2+, mainly derived from extracellular influx. PKC inhibition and down-regulation studies suggested that JNK activation was negatively regulated by PKC. Conversely, ERK activation by both m2 and m3 AChRs required PKC, suggesting a novel mechanism for PKC activation by PTX-sensitive m2 AChRs. In summary, mAChRs activate JNK and ERK via divergent mechanisms involving either Ca2+ or PKC respectively.
