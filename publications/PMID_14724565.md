The neurofibromatosis type 1 tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin, is a GTPase 
activating protein for H-, N-, K-, R-Ras and TC21/R-Ras2 proteins. We 
demonstrate that Schwann cells derived from Nf1-null mice have enhanced 
chemokinetic and chemotactic migration in comparison to wild-type controls. 
Surprisingly, this migratory phenotype is not inhibited by a farnesyltransferase 
inhibitor or dominant-negative (dn) (N17)H-Ras (which inhibits H-, N-, and K-Ras 
activation). We postulated that increased activity of R-Ras and/or TC21/R-Ras2, 
due to loss of Nf1, contributes to increased migration. Mouse Schwann cells 
(MSCs) express R-Ras and TC21/R-Ras2 and their specific guanine exchange 
factors, C3G and AND-34. Infection of Nf1-null MSCs with a dn(43N)R-Ras 
adenovirus (to inhibit both R-Ras and TC21/R-Ras2 activation) decreases 
migration by approximately 50%. Conversely, expression of activated 
(72L)TC21/R-Ras2, but not activated (38V)R-Ras, increases migration, suggesting 
a role of TC21/R-Ras2 activation in the migration of neurofibromin-deficient 
Schwann cells. TC21/R-Ras2 preferentially couples to the phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and MAP kinase pathways. Treatment with a PI3-kinase or 
MAP kinase inhibitor reduces Nf1-null Schwann cell migration, implicating these 
TC21 effectors in Schwann cell migration. These data reveal a key role for 
neurofibromin regulation of TC21/R-Ras2 in Schwann cells, a cell type critical 
to NF1 tumor pathogenesis.
