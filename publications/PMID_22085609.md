Previously we identified a novel mutation (F71L) in the αA-crystallin gene 
associated with early onset of age-related cataract. However, it is not known 
how the missense substitution translates into reduced chaperone-like activity 
(CLA), and how the structural and functional changes lead to early onset of the 
disease. Herein, we show that under native conditions the F71L-mutant is not 
significantly different from wild-type with regard to secondary and tertiary 
structural organization, hydrophobicity and the apparent molecular mass of 
oligomer but has substantial differences in structural and functional properties 
following a heat treatment. Wild-type αA-crystallin demonstrated increased CLA, 
whereas the F71L-mutant substantially lost its CLA upon heat treatment. Further, 
unlike the wild-type αA-subunit, F71L-subunit did not protect the αB-subunit in 
hetero-oligomeric complex from heat-induced aggregation. Moreover, 
hetero-oligomer containing F71L and αB in 3:1 ratio had significantly lower CLA 
upon thermal treatment compared to its unheated control. These results indicate 
that α-crystallin complexes containing F71L-αA subunits are less stable and have 
reduced CLA. Therefore, F71L may lead to earlier onset of cataract due to 
interaction with several environmental factors (e.g., temperature in this case) 
along with the aging process.
