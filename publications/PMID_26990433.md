Type I interferon (IFN-α/β) plays a critical role in suppressing viral 
replication by driving the transcription of hundreds of interferon-sensitive 
genes (ISGs). While many ISGs are transcriptionally activated by the ISGF3 
complex, the significance of other signaling intermediates in IFN-α/β-mediated 
gene regulation remains elusive, particularly in rare cases of gene silencing. 
In human Th2 cells, IFN-α/β signaling suppressed IL5 and IL13 mRNA expression 
during recall responses to T-cell receptor (TCR) activation. This suppression 
occurred through a rapid reduction in the rate of nascent transcription, 
independent of de novo expression of ISGs. Further, IFN-α/β-mediated STAT4 
activation was required for repressing the human IL5 gene, and disrupting STAT4 
dimerization reversed this effect. This is the first demonstration of STAT4 
acting as a transcriptional repressor in response to IFN-α/β signaling and 
highlights the unique activity of this cytokine to acutely block the expression 
of an inflammatory cytokine in human T cells.
