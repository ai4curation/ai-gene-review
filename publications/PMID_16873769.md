TSG-6 (the protein product of TNF-stimulated gene-6), an inflammation-associated 
protein, forms covalent complexes with heavy chains (HCs) from 
inter-alpha-inhibitor and pre-alpha-inhibitor and associates noncovalently with 
their common bikunin chain, potentiating the antiplasmin activity of this serine 
protease inhibitor. We show that TSG-6 and TSG-6.HC complexes are present in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with asthma and increase after 
allergen challenge. Immunodetection demonstrated elevated TSG-6 in the airway 
tissue and secretions of smokers. Experiments conducted in vitro with purified 
components revealed that bikunin.HC complexes (byproducts of TSG-6.HC formation) 
release bikunin. Immunoprecipitation revealed that bikunin accounts for a 
significant proportion of tissue kallikrein inhibition in bronchoalveolar lavage 
after allergen challenge but not in baseline conditions, confirming that bikunin 
in its free state, but not when associated with HCs, is a relevant protease 
inhibitor in airway secretions. In primary cultures of differentiated human 
airway epithelial and submucosal gland cells, TSG-6 is induced by TNF-alpha and 
IL-1beta, which suggests that these cells are responsible for TSG-6 release in 
vivo. Bikunin and HC3 (i.e., pre-alpha-inhibitor) were also induced by TNF-alpha 
in primary cultures. Our results suggest that TSG-6 may play an important 
protective role in bronchial epithelium by increasing the antiprotease screen on 
the airway lumen.

Abstract

TSG-6 (the protein product of TNF-stimulated gene-6), an inflammation-associated protein, forms covalent complexes with heavy chains (HCs) from inter–α-inhibitor and pre–α-inhibitor and associates noncovalently with their common bikunin chain, potentiating the antiplasmin activity of this serine protease inhibitor. We show that TSG-6 and TSG-6·HC complexes are present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with asthma and increase after allergen challenge. Immunodetection demonstrated elevated TSG-6 in the airway tissue and secretions of smokers. Experiments conducted in vitro with purified components revealed that bikunin·HC complexes (byproducts of TSG-6·HC formation) release bikunin. Immunoprecipitation revealed that bikunin accounts for a significant proportion of tissue kallikrein inhibition in bronchoalveolar lavage after allergen challenge but not in baseline conditions, confirming that bikunin in its free state, but not when associated with HCs, is a relevant protease inhibitor in airway secretions. In primary cultures of differentiated human airway epithelial and submucosal gland cells, TSG-6 is induced by TNF-α and IL-1β, which suggests that these cells are responsible for TSG-6 release in vivo . Bikunin and HC3 (i.e., pre–α-inhibitor) were also induced by TNF-α in primary cultures. Our results suggest that TSG-6 may play an important protective role in bronchial epithelium by increasing the antiprotease screen on the airway lumen.

TSG-6·HC Complex Formation Results in the Release of Free Bikunin

Free bikunin was detected in samples in which TSG-6 and IαI are incubated together, where there was an increasing amount of the free protein seen over the time course of the reaction ( Figure 5 ). No bikunin was present after 0.5 or 5 min, even though bikunin·HC species, which are by-products of TSG-6·HC complex formation ( 27 ), were clearly detected in these samples. Free bikunin was present in the 30-, 120-, and 240-min time points. This is consistent with our previous data indicating that free bikunin results from the breakdown of the bikunin·HC by-products rather than being released as part of the mechanism of TSG-6·HC complex formation ( 27 ). The bikunin resulting from chondroitinase digestion of TSG-6/IαI reaction mixtures ( Figure 4 ) is of lower molecular weight than the bikunin released during complex formation, indicating that in the latter case there is no fission of the chondroitin sulfate chain. It is most likely, therefore, that the release of bikunin·CS from bikunin·HC results from the hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the heavy chain to the CS. These experiments provide evidence that TSG-6 can enhance the anti-TK activity of IαI via the release of bikunin.

DISCUSSION

We report that TSG-6 enhances the antiprotease activity of IαI against TK and that this is due to the release of bikunin resulting from TSG-6·HC complex formation. We found that TSG-6 is present in airway secretions where its levels are upregulated in two conditions associated with airway inflammation: asthma and chronic exposure to cigarette smoke. We identified submucosal glands and surface epithelial cells as sources of TSG-6 in airway secretions.

When the BALF of individuals with asthma was examined, free TSG-6 and 120-kD TSG-6·HC complexes were observed, and the amount of the free TSG-6 seemed to be significantly increased after allergen challenge. Furthermore, high-molecular-weight species were detected with the anti-IαI antibody (running as a smear on Figure 1 ), and these are likely to correspond to HC·HA complexes, as seen in the cumulus matrix from murine cumulus oocyte complexes ( 34 ). It is probable therefore that a significant amount of TSG-6·HC complexes had been formed in these patients because TSG-6·HC can act as intermediates in the production of HC·HA ( 27 ) and that this is likely to be accompanied by the release of bikunin, as demonstrated here in vitro . We show that TSG-6 is able to increase the inhibitory activity of IαI against TK, a serine protease that plays a key role in asthma pathophysiology ( 10 , 11 , 17 ). Our data show that the TSG-6–induced increase in IαI antiprotease activity is due to the release of free bikunin after the formation of TSG-6·HC complexes. Immunoprecipitation of bikunin resulted in increased TK activity in BALF obtained from patients with asthma after allergen challenge but not in baseline conditions, confirming that released bikunin plays an important role in controlling TK catalytic activity as described ( 55 ). This phenomenon was mimicked in vitro by adding IαI and TSG-6 to hyaluronidase-treated apical cell washes on NHBE cell cultures. In fact, bikunin immunoprecipitation seemed to have resulted in higher activity than before IαI and TSG-6 supplementation, suggesting that a fraction of TK was already being inhibited by bikunin in these cell cultures. Bikunin is also an effective inhibitor of other serine proteases such as prostasin ( 56 ), which is involved in the regulation of the epithelial Na + channel ( 57 , 58 ) and has been linked to the loss of periciliary fluid on the airway epithelium in cystic fibrosis ( 14 ); therefore, TSG-6−induced bikunin release may have wider implications in airway homeostasis. TSG-6 potentiates the antiplasmin activity of IαI ( 25 , 28 ), contributing to its antiinflammatory and chondroprotective effect in arthritic joints ( 31 ). This enhancement of IαI inhibitory activity toward TK occurs via a different mechanism from that which we have recently described for the potentiation of the antiplasmin activity of IαI, which involves the formation of a noncovalent complex between the TSG-6 Link module and the bikunin chain ( 38 ). Bikunin is an effective inhibitor of TK only when it is in a free form (i.e., not part of the intact IαI molecule).

We induced TSG-6 gene expression is in NHE and SMG cells by TNF-α and IL-1β, as has been reported for most cell types expressing this gene ( 20 ). In contrast to reports that TSG-6 expression does not occur unless induced by inflammatory mediators, constitutive expression of TSG-6 mRNA was seen in our cell cultures (particularly SMG cells), as has been observed in renal epithelial cells ( 59 ) and chondrocytes ( 60 ). This is unlikely to be only an in vitro phenomenon because bronchial secretions obtained from normal volunteers contained low but measurable amounts of TSG-6. These findings are in agreement with a recent report where Lilly and colleagues ( 61 ), using microarray analysis of airway epithelial cells, found basal TSG-6 gene expression that was increased in subjects with asthma after allergen challenge.

In addition to TSG-6, we detected constitutive gene expression of HC3 and bikunin (i.e., components of PαI) that could be further increased by TNF-α. The HC3 protein was detected by immunostaining with an anti-HC3 antibody in SMG and surface epithelial cells in the airways of smokers, which is consistent with the local synthesis of PαI. These findings are not unique to airway epithelium; in fact, Janssen and colleagues ( 59 ) reported that human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells also constitutively express HC3 and bikunin. The presence of locally synthesized PαI, in addition to TSG-6, in inflammatory conditions supports the notion that airway epithelium is able to generate local responses to limit protease activity without necessarily relying on plasma proteins that become available during inflammatory responses. It is therefore tempting to hypothesize that the constitutive expression of PαI and TSG-6 could be part of a homeostatic mechanism aimed at providing antiprotease protection to the airways under normal conditions, as has been suggested in the kidney ( 59 ). Positive immunostaining of TSG-6 in tracheal tissue sections obtained from nonsmokers and smoker lung donors confirmed that TSG-6 gene expression results in increased protein expression; TSG-6 mRNA was present in SMG cells in control individuals and smokers but was clearly upregulated in the latter. In normal control subjects, faint staining was also observed in the apical pole of epithelial cells, in contrast to smokers, in whom protein expression was widely distributed (e.g., in the surface epithelium, submucosal glands, and at the ciliary border). Additionally, in control subjects we observed faint TSG-6 staining not associated with IαI, whereas in smokers TSG-6 labeling was increased (in agreement with the results on gene expression), confirming that enhanced TSG-6 protein expression is associated with airway inflammation. These findings are in agreement with the observation that cigarette smoke induces TNF-α gene and protein expression ( 62 – 64 ). IαI was not seen in normal tissues but was present in the subepithelial and interstitial tissues of smokers (likely due to vascular leakage), where it is not associated with TSG-6. However, colocalization of TSG-6 and IαI staining was observed at the ciliary border, suggesting that this could be the site of TSG-6·HC complex formation. This notion is supported by the increase in soluble TSG-6 in the bronchial secretions of smokers when compared with nonsmokers.

The roles that TSG-6 may play in human airways during inflammation are likely to be diverse. For example, TSG-6 mediates the transfer of the heavy chains from IαI/PαI onto HA ( 19 , 27 ), which is believed to lead to HA cross-linking, increasing its level of aggregation, as seen in the synovial fluids of patients with arthritis ( 65 ). TSG-6–mediated cross-linking of HA is likely to be a common feature of inflammation ( 26 , 66 ). In this regard, it is possible that free HA could act as a water reservoir in airway secretions and that the cross-linking of HA with HC, due to the increased production of TSG-6 during inflammation, may decrease its water-retaining capacity (i.e., due to a reduction in the HA domain size). This could directly affect the viscoelastic properties of mucus, thus contributing to the mucus “dehydration” seen in asthma and other airway diseases. It has also been suggested that cross-linked HA may be more resistant to depolymerization by ROS ( 27 ), suggesting that increases in TSG-6 and PαI expression (and leakage of serum-derived IαI) could play a role in protecting the epithelial surface against oxidative insults.

We have previously shown that soluble HA is increased in the BALF of patients with asthma, coinciding with a decrease in its average molecular mass ( 55 ) and suggesting that HA depolymerization occurs in the asthmatic airways. The fact that TSG-6 and IαI show colocalization at the luminal pole of epithelial cells but are dissociated in subepithelial tissue and in glands in inflamed lungs further supports the hypothesis that TSG-6·HC complex formation and the release of bikunin occurs extracellularly, after secretion, and is consistent with the detection of free TSG-6 and TSG-6·HC complexes in the BALF of subjects with asthma and the presence of HC·HA complexes, including some of low molecular weight that are likely to correspond to heavy chains attached to relatively short HA chains.

Because TSG-6 is expressed in a variety of inflammatory conditions ( 20 , 67 ), we did not limit our observations to patients with asthma. We looked also at the levels of TSG-6 in the bronchial secretions of smokers, where an increased amount of soluble TSG-6 was observed in smokers compared with nonsmokers and ex-smokers, supporting the notion that TSG-6 upregulation is a common component of a broad range of airway inflammatory responses.

The present study identifies a novel function of TSG-6 (i.e., enhancement of the anti-TK activity of IαI) by a distinct mechanism (i.e., bikunin release after TSG-6·HC complex formation) and provides a rational for this activity within the context of inflamed airways.

In summary, we report a previously unrecognized antiprotease system regulated by TSG-6, which is induced in inflammatory responses. TSG-6, HC3, and bikunin are expressed in airway epithelial cells in culture where their mRNA levels are increased by TNF-α and IL-1β. These findings correlate with the observed increases in protein expression in tracheal tissue sections and elevated protein concentrations in the bronchial secretions of smokers and in the BALF of patients with asthma, where TNF-α is upregulated ( 62 – 64 , 68 , 69 ). The interactions of TSG-6 with other molecules are also potentially important to the pathophysiologic aspects of inflammatory airway diseases that remain to be elucidated.
