The basis for memory loss in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) seems likely to 
involve synaptic damage caused by soluble Abeta-derived oligomers (ADDLs). ADDLs 
have been shown to build up in the brain and CSF of AD patients and are known to 
interfere with mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, acting as gain-of-function 
ligands that attach to synapses. Because of the correlation between AD dementia 
and synaptic degeneration, we investigated here the ability of ADDLs to affect 
synapse composition, structure, and abundance. Using highly differentiated 
cultures of hippocampal neurons, a preferred model for studies of synapse cell 
biology, we found that ADDLs bound to neurons with specificity, attaching to 
presumed excitatory pyramidal neurons but not GABAergic neurons. Fractionation 
of ADDLs bound to forebrain synaptosomes showed association with postsynaptic 
density complexes containing NMDA receptors, consistent with observed attachment 
of ADDLs to dendritic spines. During binding to hippocampal neurons, ADDLs 
promoted a rapid decrease in membrane expression of memory-related receptors 
(NMDA and EphB2). Continued exposure resulted in abnormal spine morphology, with 
induction of long thin spines reminiscent of the morphology found in mental 
retardation, deafferentation, and prionoses. Ultimately, ADDLs caused a 
significant decrease in spine density. Synaptic deterioration, which was 
accompanied by decreased levels of the spine cytoskeletal protein drebrin, was 
blocked by the Alzheimer's therapeutic drug Namenda. The observed disruption of 
dendritic spines links ADDLs to a major facet of AD pathology, providing strong 
evidence that ADDLs in AD brain cause neuropil damage believed to underlie 
dementia.
