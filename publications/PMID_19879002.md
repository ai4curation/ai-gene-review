The reaction mechanism of the dinuclear zinc enzyme human renal dipeptidase is 
investigated using hybrid density functional theory. This enzyme catalyzes the 
hydrolysis of dipeptides and beta-lactam antibiotics. Two different protonation 
states in which the important active site residue Asp288 is either neutral or 
ionized were considered. In both cases, the bridging hydroxide is shown to be 
capable of performing the nucleophilic attack on the substrate carbonyl carbon 
from its bridging position, resulting in the formation of a tetrahedral 
intermediate. This step is followed by protonation of the dipeptide nitrogen, 
coupled with C-N bond cleavage. The calculations establish that both cases have 
quite feasible energy barriers. When the Asp288 is neutral, the hydrolytic 
reaction occurs with a large exothermicity. However, the reaction becomes very 
close to thermoneutral with an ionized Asp288. The two zinc ions are shown to 
play different roles in the reaction. Zn1 binds the amino group of the 
substrate, and Zn2 interacts with the carboxylate group of the substrate, 
helping in orienting it for the nucleophilic attack. In addition, Zn2 stabilizes 
the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate, thereby facilitating the 
nucleophilic attack.
