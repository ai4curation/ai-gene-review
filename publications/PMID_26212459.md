The heat shock response (HSR) is essential for proteostasis and cellular health. 
In metazoans, aging is associated with a decline in quality control, 
thus increasing the risk for protein conformational disease. Here, we show that 
in C. elegans, the HSR declines precipitously over a 4 hr period in early 
adulthood coincident with the onset of reproductive maturity. Repression of the 
HSR occurs due to an increase in H3K27me3 marks at stress gene loci, the timing 
of which is determined by reduced expression of the H3K27 demethylase jmjd-3.1. 
This results in a repressed chromatin state that interferes with HSF-1 binding 
and suppresses transcription initiation in response to stress. The removal of 
germline stem cells preserves jmjd-3.1 expression, suppresses the accumulation 
of H3K27me3 at stress gene loci, and maintains the HSR. These findings suggest 
that competing requirements of the germline and soma dictate organismal stress 
resistance as animals begin reproduction.
