Apoptotic execution is characterized by dramatic changes in nuclear structure 
accompanied by cleavage of nuclear proteins by caspases (reviewed in [1]). 
Cell-free extracts have proved useful for the identification and functional 
characterization of activities involved in apoptotic execution [2-4] and for the 
identification of proteins cleaved by caspases [5]. More recent studies have 
suggested that nuclear disassembly is driven largely by factors activated 
downstream of caspases [6]. One such factor, the caspase-activated DNase, 
CAD/CPAN/DFF40 [4,7,8] (CAD) can induce apoptotic chromatin condensation in 
isolated HeLa cell nuclei in the absence of other cytosolic factors [6,8]. As 
chromatin condensation occurs even when CAD activity is inhibited, however, CAD 
cannot be the sole morphogenetic factor triggered by caspases [6]. Here we show 
that DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha), which is essential for both 
condensation and segregation of daughter chromosomes in mitosis [9], also 
functions during apoptotic execution. Simultaneous inhibition of Topo IIalpha 
and caspases completely abolishes apoptotic chromatin condensation. In addition, 
we show that CAD binds to Topo IIalpha, and that their association enhances the 
decatenation activity of Topo IIalpha in vitro.
