Yeast Sir2 plays critical roles in gene silencing, stress resistance and 
longevity. Mammalian Sirt1 NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase, the closest 
homolog of Sir2, regulates cell cycle, cellular senescence, apoptosis and 
metabolism, by functional interactions with a number of biological molecules 
such as p53. To investigate a role of Sirt1 in endothelial dysfunction and 
premature senescence, we examined the effects of Sirt1 inhibition in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Sirt1 inhibition by sirtinol, which is 
a 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde derivative, or siRNA for Sirt1-induced premature 
senescence-like phenotype, as judged by increased senescence-associated 
beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity, sustained growth arrest and enlarged 
and flattened cell morphology at 10 days after the treatment. Sixty-four percent 
of sirtinol (60 mumol/L)-treated HUVEC was SA-beta-gal-positive, whereas only 
17% of vehicle-treated cells were positive. Sirt1 inhibition by sirtinol or 
Sirt1 siRNA increased PAI-1 expression and decreased both protein expression and 
activity of eNOS. Treatment with sirtinol or Sirt1 siRNA increased acetylation 
of p53, while p53 expression was unaltered. Impaired epidermal growth 
factor-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases was associated 
with Sirt1 inhibition-induced senescence-like growth arrest. Conversely, 
overexpression of Sirt1 prevented hydrogen peroxide-induced SA-beta-gal 
activity, morphological changes and deranged expression of PAI-1 and eNOS. These 
results showed that Sirt1 inhibition increased p53 acetylation and induced 
premature senescence-like phenotype in parallel with increased PAI-1 and 
decreased eNOS expression. Our data suggest that Sirt1 may exert protective 
effects against endothelial dysfunction by preventing stress-induced premature 
senescence and deranged expression of PAI-1 and eNOS.
