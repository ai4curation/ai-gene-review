The molecular oscillator that drives circadian rhythmicity in mammals obtains 
its near 24-h periodicity from posttranslational regulation of clock proteins. 
Activity of the major clock kinase casein kinase I (CKI) epsilon is regulated by 
inhibitory autophosphorylation. Here we show that protein phosphatase (PP) 5 
regulates the kinase activity of CKIepsilon. We demonstrate that cryptochrome 
regulates clock protein phosphorylation by modulating the effect of PP5 on 
CKIepsilon. Like CKIepsilon, PP5 is expressed both in the master circadian clock 
in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and in peripheral tissues independent of the 
clock. Expression of a dominant-negative PP5 mutant reduces PER phosphorylation 
by CKIepsilon in vivo, and down-regulation of PP5 significantly reduces the 
amplitude of circadian cycling in cultured human fibroblasts. Collectively, 
these findings indicate that PP5, CKIepsilon, and cryptochrome dynamically 
regulate the mammalian circadian clock.
