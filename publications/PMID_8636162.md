The coat protomer complex I (COPI) family of coat proteins are involved in the 
assembly of membrane-associated coats thought to mediate vesicular transport 
between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex, between adjacent Golgi 
cisternae, and possibly in the endocytic pathway. We investigated whether this 
heterogeneity in the sites of COPI action might be reflected in biochemical 
heterogeneity of one or more COPI subunits. A simplified method was devised to 
purify the cytosolic COPI precursor complex, coatomer, from rat liver cytosol. 
The individual subunits were analyzed by high resolution two dimensional gel 
electrophoresis and mass spectroscopic analysis of tryptic peptides. 
Considerable charge heterogeneity was observed, particularly for the beta-COP 
and delta-COP subunits. The multiple species detected, however, did not appear 
to reflect the presence of distinct translation products but rather a 
significant degree of protein phosphorylation. The observed pI of beta-COP was 
sensitive to alkaline phosphatase digestion. Moreover, isolation of coatomer 
from metabolically labeled tissue culture cells demonstrated directly that both 
beta-COP and delta-COP, but no other coatomer subunits, were 
serine-phosphorylated. COPI phosphorylation may regulate coatomer assembly, 
membrane recruitment, or the specificity of coatomer-organelle interaction.
