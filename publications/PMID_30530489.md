Lysine methylation is an important post-translational modification that is also 
present on mitochondrial proteins, but the mitochondrial lysine-specific 
methyltransferases (KMTs) responsible for modification are in most cases 
unknown. Here, we set out to determine the function of human family with 
sequence similarity 173 member B (FAM173B), a mitochondrial methyltransferase 
(MTase) reported to promote chronic pain. Using bioinformatics analyses and 
biochemical assays, we found that FAM173B contains an atypical, noncleavable 
mitochondrial targeting sequence responsible for its localization to 
mitochondria. Interestingly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of FAM173B in mammalian 
cells abrogated trimethylation of Lys-43 in ATP synthase c-subunit (ATPSc), a 
modification previously reported as ubiquitous among metazoans. ATPSc 
methylation was restored by complementing the KO cells with enzymatically active 
human FAM173B or with a putative FAM173B orthologue from the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans Interestingly, lack of Lys-43 methylation caused aberrant 
incorporation of ATPSc into the ATP synthase complex and resulted in decreased 
ATP-generating ability of the complex, as well as decreased mitochondrial 
respiration. In summary, we have identified FAM173B as the long-sought KMT 
responsible for methylation of ATPSc, a key protein in cellular ATP production, 
and have demonstrated functional significance of ATPSc methylation. We suggest 
renaming FAM173B to ATPSc-KMT (gene name ATPSCKMT).
