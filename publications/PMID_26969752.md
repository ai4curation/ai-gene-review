BACKGROUND: Calmodulin (CaM) is encoded by 3 genes, CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3, all 
of which harbor pathogenic variants linked to long QT syndrome (LQTS) with early 
and severe expressivity. These LQTS-causative variants reduce CaM affinity to 
Ca(2+) and alter the properties of the cardiac L-type calcium channel (CaV1.2). 
CaM also modulates NaV1.5 and the ryanodine receptor, RyR2. All these 
interactions may play a role in disease pathogenesis. Here, we determine the 
spectrum and prevalence of pathogenic CaM variants in a cohort of genetically 
elusive LQTS, and functionally characterize the novel variants.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-eight genetically elusive LQTS cases underwent 
whole-exome sequencing to identify CaM variants. Nonsynonymous CaM variants were 
over-represented significantly in this heretofore LQTS cohort (13.2%) compared 
with exome aggregation consortium (0.04%; P<0.0001). When the clinical sequelae 
of these 5 CaM-positive cases were compared with the 33 CaM-negative cases, 
CaM-positive cases had a more severe phenotype with an average age of onset of 
10 months, an average corrected QT interval of 676 ms, and a high prevalence of 
cardiac arrest. Functional characterization of 1 novel variant, E141G-CaM, 
revealed an 11-fold reduction in Ca(2+)-binding affinity and a functionally 
dominant loss of inactivation in CaV1.2, mild accentuation in NaV1.5 late 
current, but no effect on intracellular RyR2-mediated calcium release.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 13% of our genetically elusive LQTS cohort harbored 
nonsynonymous variants in CaM. Genetic testing of CALM1-3 should be pursued for 
individuals with LQTS, especially those with early childhood cardiac arrest, 
extreme QT prolongation, and a negative family history.

Methods and Results

Thirty-nine genetically elusive LQTS cases underwent whole exome sequencing to identify CaM variants. Non-synonymous CaM variants were overrepresented significantly in this heretofore LQTS cohort (15.4%) compared to exome aggregation consortium (0.04%; p<0.0001). When the clinical sequelae of these 6 CaM-positive cases was compared to the 33 CaM-negative cases, CaM-positive cases had a more severe phenotype with an average age of onset of 8 months, an average QTc of 679 ms, and a high prevalence of cardiac arrest. Functional characterization of one novel variant, E141G-CaM, revealed an 11-fold reduction in Ca 2+ binding affinity and a functionally-dominant loss of inactivation in Ca V 1.2, mild accentuation in Na V 1.5 late current, but no effect on intracellular RyR2-mediated calcium release.

Conclusions

Overall, 15% of our genetically elusive LQTS cohort harbored non-synonymous variants in CaM. Genetic testing of CALM1-3 should be pursued for individuals with LQTS, especially those with early childhood cardiac arrest, extreme QT prolongation, and a negative family history.

Introduction

Calmodulin (CaM) is an essential Ca 2+ sensing, signal-transducing protein. Calcium-induced activation of CaM regulates many calcium-dependent processes and modulates the function of cardiac ion channels including the long QT syndrome (LQTS)-associated CACNA1C -encoded Ca V 1.2 calcium channel and SCN5A -encoded Na V 1.5 sodium channel, as well as the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)-associated RYR2 -encoded ryanodine receptor. 1 - 3 Interestingly, there are three calmodulin genes, CALM1 (chr14q31), CALM2 (chr2p21), and CALM3 (chr19q13), 4 with unique nucleotide sequences that all encode for a completely identical 149 amino acid CaM protein, 5 , 6 which are expressed differentially in the human heart. 7

Variants in all three of the calmodulin genes ( CALM1, CALM2 , and CALM3) have been described recently in LQTS. 7 - 9 LQTS is a disorder of ventricular myocardial repolarization characterized by the prolongation of the heart-rate corrected QT interval (QTc) on a resting electrocardiogram (ECG), manifesting clinically as syncope, seizures, or sudden death in the setting of a structurally normal heart. In 2013, whole exome sequencing (WES) was utilized on two parent-child trios of severe cases of LQTS presenting during infancy yielding de novovariants in CALM1 and CALM2 . 7 Follow-up cohort analysis identified two additional LQTS patients with variants in CALM1 . Since then, additional CALM2 variants have also been identified in cases of LQTS and LQTS/CPVT overlap phenotypes. 8 Finally, a variant was identified in CALM3 -encoded CaM in a severe case of LQTS. 9

All of the identified LQTS-associated variants in CaM characterized to date have reduced affinity for Ca 2+ and attenuated Ca V 1.2 inactivation through the loss of calcium dependent inactivation (CDI). 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 Here, we describe the spectrum, prevalence, and functional consequence of novel CaM variants identified within our cohort of 39 unrelated patients with genetically elusive LQTS.

Discussion

Our examination of 39 patients with genetically elusive LQTS identified 6 individuals (15.4%) that harbored variants in either CALM1 or CALM2 . Three of the identified variants, p.D96V, p.D130G, and p.F142L, had been published previously in other cases of LQTS, 7 one variant represented a novel amino acid change at a previously described position, p.D130V, and the final variant, p.E141G, was novel. Within our cohort, CaM variants were overrepresented significantly when compared to the publically available databases in essentially a modified case:control analysis, which provides additional evidence that single amino acid substitutions within CaM, particularly those involving calcium-interacting residues in the C-domain, are not well tolerated.

When examining the clinical characteristics of these six patients harboring CaM variants, we found that they had an early age at onset with the average age of onset at 8 months, average QTc of 679 ± 32 ms, and all experienced cardiac arrest ( Figure 2 , Table 3 ). 19 Moreover, all CaM variants were shown to occur as de novo when parental DNA was available for testing, thus supporting the malignant nature of LQTS-related CaM variants. These clinical characteristics seemed even more severe than those of the previously published LQT1-3 genotype-positive and LQT1-3 genotype-negative LQTS ( Table 3 ), 19 and the previously described LQTS 7 and LQTS/CPVT 8 patients with CaM variants (n=10), where the average age at diagnosis was 3 years, the average QTc was 591 ± 22 ms, and 60% experienced cardiac arrest ( Table 2 ). However, if we separate the previously described CaM-positive patients into two categories, LQTS/CPVT overlap phenotypes and a pure LQTS phenotype, it becomes more apparent that LQTS/CPVT patients (n=3) 8 may be less severe, as the average age at diagnosis was 7 years, the average QTc was 519 ± 53 ms, with only 33% experiencing cardiac arrest. In contrast, the patients with a pure LQTS phenotype (n=7) were similar to our LQTS CaM-positive patients, with an average age at diagnosis of 14 months, an average QTc of 622 ± 20 ms, and with 86% experiencing cardiac arrest. This provides evidence that CaM-mediated LQTS is very severe and it may be important to delineate these phenotypes, as they may present with different disease severities, and the phenotypic presentation may be regulated by distinct underlying mechanisms. Therefore, continued studies will be necessary to elucidate the key differences between CaM variants and their associated phenotypes. In addition, children with CaM-mediated LQTS who survive will need ongoing surveillance for the potential development of a cardiomyopathy as two of the CaM variant-positive children who have survived past 5 years of age, and one of the deceased patients on autopsy, had developed dilated cardiomyopathy. It is possible that the Ca V 1.2's impaired CDI may contribute to diastolic calcium excess that could precipitate cardiomyopathic structural remodeling.

CaM modulates the activity of several different ion channels by sensing and transducing Ca 2+ signals. When Ca 2+ levels are raised, CaM binds up to 4 calcium ions, which stabilize an open conformation within each domain that mediates interactions with CaM's targets. Hence, we first examined the effects of the E141G variant on the Ca 2+ affinity of CaM, and found that this mutant resulted in an 11-fold reduction in the Ca 2+ affinity of the C-domain. These results are comparable to the Ca 2+ binding impairments caused by the 8 variants previously associated with LQTS or LQTS/CPVT overlap phenotypes (5-54 fold increased dissociation of Ca 2+ in the C-domain, Table 2 ), 7 , 10 , 18 suggesting that impaired Ca 2+ binding properties in the C-domain is a common underlying pathomechanism of LQTS-associated CaM variants.

These disrupted Ca 2+ affinities have direct implications on Ca V 1.2's CDI. Typically, Ca V 1.2 is inactivated with increasing Ca 2+ concentrations via a mechanism mediated by the binding of CaM. The altered Ca 2+ binding properties of CaM, such as with CaM-E141G, would therefore be expected to impair Ca V 1.2's CDI. Using whole-cell patch clamp experiments, we found that CaM-E141G shifted inactivation 1.9 mV. These findings were replicated in native ventricular myocytes where CaM-E141G again reduced Ca V 1.2 inactivation, which closely parallels what has been noted previously with the other LQTS-associated CaM variants. 10 , 11

Because there are three calmodulin genes expressed in the heart, which each encode for an identical protein, our heterozygous variant only affects 1/6 of the calmodulin alleles. Therefore, we examined the CaM-E141G variant at reduced levels (25:75; mutant:WT), which also maintained a significant effect on inactivation. This suggests that p.E141G has a dominant negative effect and is capable of causing the disease phenotype.

In addition to Ca V 1.2, it has been established previously that CaM modulates cardiac sodium channel inactivation. 21 Previously, Yin and colleagues found that LQTS-associated CaM variants (D96V, D130G, and F142L) did not affect Na V 1.5; however D130G led to a 7.5-fold increase in fetal Na V 1.5 late current. 11 They hypothesized that because CaM-mediated LQTS has an early age of onset, the variants may only affect the fetal isoform of the sodium channel. However, because there have been associations of CaM with the adult isoform of Na V 1.5, we wanted to determine whether CaM-E141G may have an effect on channel gating function. Our studies showed that the E141G variant led to a 1.7-fold increase in Na V l.5 late current when expressed as a homozygote. This makes our CaM-E141G variant the first CaM variant shown to affect the adult isoform of the cardiac sodium channel. Interestingly, however, when E141G was expressed with wild-type CaM – mimicking a heterozygote patient – the Na V 1.5 late current was normalized. This differs from the effect of E141G-CaM on Ca V 1.2, where even a 3-fold excess of WT CaM failed to normalize Ca V 1.2 inactivation.

It has been established that CPVT-associated CaM variants 18 affect the functioning of RYR2 - encoded ryanodine receptor (RyR2), leading to greater open probability of the channel. 3 Because one previously reported LQTS associated CaM variant (N98S) also activates RyR2 and can cause CPVT as well as LQTS, 3 we examined the effect of p.E141G on RyR2 Ca 2+ release channel activity. The p.E141G variant had no effect on Ca 2+ sparks, a measure of RyR2 Ca 2+ release channel activity, and did not affect SR Ca 2+ content. Hence, our results continue to support the emerging evidence that LQTS-associated CaM variants do not affect RyR2, whereas CPVT-associated CaM variants perturb RyR2 function.

Conclusion

We have identified a novel CaM variant p.E141G, which like other LQTS-associated CaM variants, disrupts Ca 2+ binding and leads to increased Ca V 1.2 window/persistent current. In addition, p.E141G is the first CaM variant identified to also affect the adult Na V 1.5 isoform, leading to increased sodium late current. Overall, we found that 15% of genetically elusive LQTS patients harbored a functionally significant CaM variant. The phenotypic characteristics of the CaM-positive individuals from our cohort, combined with the other published cases of LQTS-associated CaM variants, suggest that LQTS patients harboring variants in either CALM1-, CALM2 -, or CALM3 -encoded CaM present early in life with profound QT prolongation and have a high predilection for cardiac arrest and sudden death. The existing gene panels for LQTS genetic testing should now be expanded to include CALM1, CALM2 , and CALM3 .
