Every organ depends on blood vessels for oxygen and nutrients, but the 
vasculature associated with individual organs can be structurally and 
molecularly diverse. The central nervous system (CNS) vasculature consists of a 
tightly sealed endothelium that forms the blood-brain barrier, whereas blood 
vessels of other organs are more porous. Wnt7a and Wnt7b encode two Wnt ligands 
produced by the neuroepithelium of the developing CNS coincident with vascular 
invasion. Using genetic mouse models, we found that these ligands directly 
target the vascular endothelium and that the CNS uses the canonical Wnt 
signaling pathway to promote formation and CNS-specific differentiation of the 
organ's vasculature.
