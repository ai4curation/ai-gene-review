MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in insulin signaling and insulin 
secretion, but the role of miRNAs in the association between obesity and hepatic 
insulin resistance is largely unknown. This study reports that saturated fatty 
acid (SFA) and high fat diet (HFD) significantly induce miR-195 expression in 
hepatocytes, and that the insulin receptor (INSR), not insulin receptor 
substrate-1 (IRS-1), is a direct target of miR-195. Furthermore, the ectopic 
expression of miR-195 suppresses the expression of INSR, thereby impairing the 
insulin signaling cascade and glycogen synthesis in HepG2 cells. These findings 
suggest that the dysregulation of miR-195 by SFA is a detrimental factor for 
hepatic insulin sensitivity.
