ATF5 loss of function has been shown previously to cause apoptotic cell death in 
glioblastoma and breast cancer cells but not in non-transformed astrocytes and 
human breast epithelial cells. The mechanism for the cell type-dependent 
survival function of ATF5 is unknown. We report here that the anti-apoptotic 
factor BCL-2 is a downstream target of ATF5 that mediates the prosurvival 
function of ATF5 in C6 glioma cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. ATF5 binds to 
an ATF5-specific regulatory element that is downstream of and adjacent to the 
negative regulatory element in the BCL-2 P2 promoter, stimulating BCL-2 
expression. Highlighting the critical role of BCL-2 in ATF5-dependent cancer 
cell survival, expression of BCL-2 blocks death of C6 and MCF-7 cells induced by 
dominant-negative ATF5, and depletion of BCL-2 impairs ATF5-promoted cell 
survival. Moreover, we found that BCL-2 expression is not regulated by ATF5 in 
non-transformed rat astrocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human breast 
epithelial cells, where expression of BCL-2 but not ATF5 is required for cell 
survival. These findings identify BCL-2 as an essential mediator for the 
cancer-specific cell survival function of ATF5 in glioblastoma and breast cancer 
cells and provide direct evidence that the cell type-specific function of ATF5 
derives from differential regulation of downstream targets by ATF5 in different 
types of cells.
