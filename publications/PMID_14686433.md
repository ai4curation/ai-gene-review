Phototropism as well as gravitropism plays a role in the oriented growth of 
roots in flowering plants. In blue or white light, roots exhibit negative 
phototropism, but red light induces positive phototropism in Arabidopsis roots. 
Phytochrome A (phyA) and phyB mediate the positive red-light-based photoresponse 
in roots since single mutants (and the double phyAB mutant) were severely 
impaired in this response. In blue-light-based negative phototropism, phyA and 
phyAB (but not phyB) were inhibited in the response relative to the WT. In root 
gravitropism, phyB and phyAB (but not phyA) were inhibited in the response 
compared to the WT. The differences observed in tropistic responses were not due 
to growth limitations since the growth rates among all the mutants tested were 
not significantly different from that of the WT. Thus, our study shows that the 
blue-light and red-light systems interact in roots and that phytochrome plays a 
key role in plant development by integrating multiple environmental stimuli.
