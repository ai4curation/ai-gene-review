Abstract

FAT10 (HLA-F-adjacent transcript 10) is a ubiquitin-like modifier that is commonly overexpressed in various tumors. It was found to play a role in mitotic regulation through its interaction with mitotic arrest-deficient 2 (MAD2). Overexpression of FAT10 promotes tumor growth and malignancy. Here, we identified the MAD2-binding interface of FAT10 to be located on its first ubiquitin-like domain whose NMR structure thus was determined. We further proceeded to demonstrate that disruption of the FAT10–MAD2 interaction through mutation of specific MAD2-binding residues did not interfere with the interaction of FAT10 with its other known interacting partners. Significantly, ablation of the FAT10–MAD2 interaction dramatically limited the promalignant capacity of FAT10, including promoting tumor growth in vivo and inducing aneuploidy, proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis in vitro. Our results strongly suggest that the interaction of FAT10 with MAD2 is a key mechanism underlying the promalignant property of FAT10 and offer prospects for the development of anticancer strategies.

Discussion

In recent years, increasing evidence has pointed toward a pathological role for FAT10 in promoting cellular malignancy through mechanisms beyond its proteasome-targeting function. Liu et al. ( 4 ) first reported the interaction of FAT10 with the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2, and we further showed that this interaction induced chromosomal instability ( 7 , 12 ), a hallmark of many solid tumors. Recently, a causal role for FAT10 in tumor initiation and progression was established ( 9 , 29 ). However, the role of the FAT10–MAD2 interaction in promoting malignancy remained unclear, largely because the insoluble nature of the FAT10 protein in vitro hampered the identification of the FAT10 protein structure and its interaction interface with MAD2.

In this study, we achieved a breakthrough to this conundrum, and with the FAT10 domain 1 structure presented here we report the successful determination of the first (to our knowledge) solution structures of the FAT10 domains through extensive dissection of the protein. We show through NMR studies that FAT10 contains two domains that adopt the same ubiquitin-like fold and that they may not possess tight packing between each other. Importantly, we mapped the MAD2-binding interface of FAT10 to domain 1 of FAT10 with a K d of 2.97 µM. The very different electrostatic potential surface of domain 2 may be largely responsible for its inability to bind MAD2 ( Fig. S2 ). We further identified and characterized five core residues within this interface that are crucial for the interaction of FAT10 with MAD2. Mutation of these five key residues abolished the FAT10–MAD2 interaction both in vitro and in vivo and mitigated the promalignant features of FAT10, strongly implicating the interaction of FAT10 with MAD2 in mediating FAT10-induced malignancy. Importantly, disruption of the FAT10–MAD2 interaction significantly curtailed FAT10-induced tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that the role of FAT10 in tumor progression is critically dependent on its interaction with MAD2.

In agreement with literature reports implicating FAT10 in mitotic regulation ( 7 , 12 ), a recent study revealed FATylation of mitosis-related cell cycle regulators, including MAD2, during mitosis ( 30 ). Here, we provide further mechanistic insight into FAT10-induced mitotic dysregulation through its interaction with the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2. We demonstrated that the capacity of FAT10 to induce numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations is critically dependent on its interaction with MAD2. Perhaps this finding is not surprising, given that MAD2 serves as an important checkpoint during mitosis, ensuring proper attachment of chromosomes to the spindle microtubules during prometaphase. During this phase, unattached kinetochores prevent metaphase-to-anaphase transition by inducing the conversion of mitotic checkpoint proteins such as MAD2 into diffusible inhibitors of anaphase-promoting complex-cdc20 (APC cdc20 ) ( 31 ). Interestingly, the MAD2-dependent FAT10-induced malignant phenotype strikingly resembles the high prevalence of aneuploidy and spontaneous tumors observed in mice heterozygous for MAD2 and overexpressing MAD2 ( 32 , 33 ), implicating a weakened mitotic checkpoint in promoting cellular malignancy. The significance of checkpoint aberration and aneuploidy in promoting neoplastic transformation also has been highlighted by several studies that used mice with genetically altered levels of checkpoint components (reviewed in ref. 13 ). Notably, we found that other FAT10-induced malignant characteristics such as enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion and resistance to apoptosis also were dependent on its interaction with MAD2, consistent with the reported promalignant phenotype of MAD2-deficient cells ( 34 – 36 ). These findings suggest that MAD2 may have other roles that are independent of its role in mitosis, although the underlying mechanisms at present remain unclear. Additionally, our data suggest that the interaction of FAT10 with MAD2 induces widespread gene deregulation that may promote cellular malignancy. Although it is not immediately clear whether the aberrant gene-expression patterns observed were a result of FAT10-induced chromosomal instability or a consequence of the FAT10–MAD2 interaction, our data undoubtedly show that abrogating the FAT10–MAD2 interaction protects on cells against global gene deregulation induced by FAT10.

In this study, we have demonstrated that the MAD2-binding interface of FAT10 is specific to MAD2, thus presenting a previously unidentified and specific strategy for targeting the MAD2-related tumor-promoting activities of FAT10. Mutation of the five core residues of FAT10 that are crucial for the FAT10–MAD2 interaction did not affect the covalent binding of FAT10 with its E1 enzyme UBA6 or with other known binding partners through the FAT10 di-glycine residues, consistent with the notion that the two FAT10 domains are structurally independent. Noncovalent interactions between FAT10 and proteins NUB1L and HDAC6 also were unaffected by the disruption of the MAD2-binding interface of FAT10. Specific targeting of the MAD2-related pathological activity of FAT10 offers the advantage of minimizing potential undesirable side effects for future therapy and is of paramount importance, because our current understanding of the physiological roles of FAT10 is incomplete. Specific targeting of FAT10 also appears more favorable than targeting MAD2 because MAD2 is ubiquitously expressed and plays a critical physiological role in cell cycle regulation. In contrast, the frequent selective overexpression of FAT10 in tumors ( 5 ) makes extremely attractive the development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting the MAD2-binding interface of FAT10 for use as a cytostatic agent in anticancer therapies for patients with premalignant neoplasms or tumors.

In summary, this study has shed light on the mechanism underlying FAT10-induced promotion of cellular malignancy through its interaction with MAD2. Importantly, our findings present a paradigm for drug targeting as well as the foundation for the development of novel, small-molecule anticancer drugs that specifically target the MAD2-related promalignant functions of FAT10.
