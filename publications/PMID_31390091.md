RIG-I-MAVS antiviral signaling represents an important pathway to stimulate 
interferon production and confer innate immunity to the host. Upon binding to 
viral RNA and Riplet-mediated polyubiquitination, RIG-I promotes prion-like 
aggregation and activation of MAVS. MAVS subsequently induces interferon 
production by activating two signaling pathways mediated by TBK1-IRF3 and 
IKK-NF-κB respectively. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of MAVS 
downstream pathways remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that activation of 
TBK1-IRF3 by MAVS-Region III depends on its multimerization state and identified 
TRAF3IP3 as a critical regulator for the downstream signaling. In response to 
virus infection, TRAF3IP3 is accumulated on mitochondria and thereby facilitates 
the recruitment of TRAF3 to MAVS for TBK1-IRF3 activation. Traf3ip3-deficient 
mice demonstrated a severely compromised potential to induce interferon 
production and were vulnerable to RNA virus infection. Our findings uncover that 
TRAF3IP3 is an important regulator for RIG-I-MAVS signaling, which bridges MAVS 
and TRAF3 for an effective antiviral innate immune response.

Abstract

RIG‐I‐MAVS antiviral signaling represents an important pathway to stimulate interferon production and confer innate immunity to the host. Upon binding to viral RNA and Riplet‐mediated polyubiquitination, RIG‐I promotes prion‐like aggregation and activation of MAVS. MAVS subsequently induces interferon production by activating two signaling pathways mediated by TBK1‐IRF3 and IKK‐NF‐κB respectively. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of MAVS downstream pathways remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that activation of TBK1‐IRF3 by MAVS‐Region III depends on its multimerization state and identified TRAF3IP3 as a critical regulator for the downstream signaling. In response to virus infection, TRAF3IP3 is accumulated on mitochondria and thereby facilitates the recruitment of TRAF3 to MAVS for TBK1‐IRF3 activation. Traf3ip3 ‐deficient mice demonstrated a severely compromised potential to induce interferon production and were vulnerable to RNA virus infection. Our findings uncover that TRAF3IP3 is an important regulator for RIG‐I‐MAVS signaling, which bridges MAVS and TRAF3 for an effective antiviral innate immune response.

Introduction

Innate immunity plays an important role in protecting higher organisms against pathogen infection (Palm & Medzhitov, 2009 ; Takeuchi & Akira, 2010 ). In the past two decades, distinct signaling pathways have been identified to mediate proper and efficient immune responses to virus infection (Yoneyama & Fujita, 2010 ; Aoshi et al , 2011 ; Tan et al , 2018 ). RIG‐I, one of the RIG‐I‐like receptors (RLRs), senses viral RNA in the cytoplasm and triggers immune signaling through its downstream adaptor protein MAVS (also known as VISA, IPS1, Cardif; Yoneyama et al , 2004 ; Kawai et al , 2005 ; Meylan et al , 2005 ; Seth et al , 2005 ; Xu et al , 2005 ; Chow et al , 2018 ; Loo et al , 2008 ), while cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) detects viral DNA in the cytoplasm and launches immune response through the adaptor protein STING (also known as MITA, ERIS, MYPS; Chen et al , 2016 ). RIG‐I‐MAVS transduces antiviral signal to downstream kinases, including TBK1/IKKε and IKKα/β, which further activate transcriptional factors IRF3/IRF7 and NF‐κB, respectively, to stimulate the expression of type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines (tenOever et al , 2004 ). Type I IFN (α and β) induces the expression of hundreds of interferon‐stimulated genes (ISGs) and eventually an antiviral state to provide innate immunity for host cells.

Upon detection of viral RNA, RIG‐I switches from a “closed” conformation to an “open” one, thereby activating MAVS by inducing its prion‐like aggregation (Hou et al , 2011 ; Kowalinski et al , 2011 ; Luo et al , 2011 ; Cai et al , 2014 ; Peisley et al , 2014 ; Wu et al , 2014 ). It has been shown recently that Riplet‐mediated ubiquitination is crucial for RIG‐I‐mediated MAVS activation and the signal transduction from RIG‐I to MAVS could be elegantly reconstituted in vitro using purified components (Zeng et al , 2010 ; Shi et al , 2017 ). In contrast to such an elaborate understanding of the MAVS upstream signaling pathway, its downstream signaling has been unclear. MAVS contains multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor‐associated factor (TRAF)‐binding sites for TRAF proteins, including TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6, which play redundant roles in mediating MAVS downstream signaling (Seth et al , 2005 ; Xu et al , 2005 ; Pineda et al , 2007 ; Liu et al , 2013 ; Fang et al , 2017 ). The identification of Ubc5 as an essential player for MAVS downstream signaling indicated the involvement of a ubiquitination event and supported the role of the TRAF proteins, which are E3 ubiquitin ligases (Zeng et al , 2009 ). In addition, other molecules, including TRADD and TANK, were also indicated in MAVS downstream signaling (Guo & Cheng, 2007 ; Michallet et al , 2008 ). A recent report refined two previously identified TRAF‐binding sites of MAVS as Regions I and II, which contribute to IKK‐NF‐κB activation, and further uncovered MAVS‐Region III as a novel site responsible for TBK1‐IRF3 activation (Shi et al , 2015 ). Phosphorylation of MAVS at a site located in its Region III was demonstrated to be critical for TBK1‐IRF3 activation (Liu et al , 2015 ). However, how MAVS‐Region III recruits and activates its downstream signaling molecules such as TRAFs is largely unknown.

The recruitment of TRAF3 to MAVS is an essential step in RIG‐I‐MAVS antiviral signaling (Saha et al , 2006 ; Paz et al , 2011 ; Belgnaoui et al , 2012 ). However, the mechanism of TRAF3 recruitment by MAVS remains unknown. Interestingly, TRAF3 interacting protein 3 (TRAF3IP3), also known as TRAF3‐interacting JNK‐activating modulator (T3JAM), has been reported to associate with TRAF3 and express at high levels in a variety of immune organs (Zou et al , 2015 ; Yu et al , 2018 ). Previous studies indicated that TRAF3IP3 and TRAF3 synergistically promote JNK but not NF‐κB activation, and TRAF3IP3‐mediated ERK signaling is critical in thymocyte development (Dadgostar et al , 2003 ). TRAF3IP3 also promotes autophagy and thus plays an important role in marginal zone B‐cell development and survival (Peng et al , 2015 ). Nevertheless, how TRAF3IP3 might contribute to antiviral innate immune signaling and whether it might be involved in RIG‐I‐MAVS pathway have not been explored.

Prion‐like aggregation of MAVS is required for its activation and presumably releases its autoinhibition on Region III after virus infection (Shi et al , 2015 ). Activated MAVS‐Region III promotes its downstream TBK1‐IRF3 activation, which is central to RIG‐I signaling. To gain mechanistical insight into how MAVS activates TBK1‐IRF3 signaling, we expressed MAVS‐Region III in vitro and in cells and found that it becomes active after multimerization. We then identified TRAF3IP3 by affinity purification as a binding partner to multimerized active MAVS‐Region III. We further found that TRAF3IP3 is accumulated on the mitochondria and mediates TRAF3 recruitment to MAVS upon virus infection. Remarkably, TRAF3IP3 plays a specific role in regulating TBK1‐IRF3 but not IKK‐NF‐κB activation upon RNA virus infection. Traf3ip3 ‐deficient mice showed attenuated interferon response and thus severely crippled innate immunity to RNA virus infection. Therefore, our data identify TRAF3IP3 as a critical regulator in MAVS‐mediated TBK1‐IRF3 activation for type I interferon production against RNA virus infection.

Discussion

MAVS was identified as an essential player in RIG‐I signaling more than a decade ago and Mavs ‐deficient mice were shortly generated to provide evidence substantiating the pivotal role of MAVS in interferon induction by virus infection (Sun et al , 2006 ). In contrast, dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying MAVS activation and how MAVS activates its downstream signaling has been arduous. As such, a number of proteins have been identified to modulate MAVS antiviral activity (Moore et al , 2008 ; Lei et al , 2012 ; Liu et al , 2012 , 2017 ; Zhang et al , 2014 ; Yan et al , 2017 ). Among them, TRAF proteins were found to play redundant roles downstream of MAVS. Despite these studies, there are remaining gaps in our understanding of signaling from MAVS to its downstream molecules. In this study, we reported an important regulator TRAF3IP3, which mediates the recruitment of TRAF3 to MAVS to promote MAVS downstream signaling and specifically regulates TBK1‐IRF3 but not IKK‐ NF‐κB activation (Fig 8 ).

Multimerization or aggregation has been demonstrated as a key feature of MAVS antiviral function. MAVS C‐terminal transmembrane domain mediates a homotypic interaction between full‐length MAVS and its truncated isoforms to prevent its accidental spontaneous aggregation in cells, which represents one multimerization element of MAVS (Qi et al , 2017 ). Moreover, N‐terminal CARD domain of MAVS mediates its prion‐like aggregation upon virus infection, which unleashes the autoinhibitory effect of MAVS on its Region III. MAVS‐Region III can then activate downstream TBK1‐IRF3 signaling. Following these studies, there is an intriguing question as to whether the activity of MAVS‐Region III depends on its multimerization state on its own. To address this question, we enforced the multimerization of MAVS‐Region III by artificially tagging it with GCN4‐derived peptides, which are able to mediate multimerization independently. Based on both in vitro and in cellulo evidence, we concluded that a high‐order multimerization of MAVS‐Region III is indispensable for its activity. As a matter of fact, our previous report showed that without N‐terminal CARD domain, overexpressed MAVS‐Region III‐TM could also activate TBK1‐IRF3 in cells, which is conceivable as MAVS transmembrane domain could mediate homotypic interaction and thus multimerization (Shi et al , 2015 ). Collectively, we reasoned that prion‐like aggregation of MAVS can not only release its autoinhibition on Region III, but also result in the multimerization and activation of Region III, highlighting an unappreciated layer of consequence and significance of MAVS prion‐like aggregation. Following structural study on MAVS‐Region III in both autoinhibitory and high‐order multimerized states should provide more mechanistic insight into its antiviral function.

In the effort investigating how MAVS‐Region III activates its downstream signaling, we identified TRAF3IP3 as a binding partner to MAVS‐Region III and an important regulator in mediating TBK1‐IRF3 activation downstream of MAVS. Interestingly, TRAF3IP3 specifically associated with TRAF3 but not other TRAF proteins. Therefore, we postulated a mechanism underlying TRAF3IP3‐mediated TRAF3 recruitment to MAVS for antiviral signaling. In support of this mechanism, TRAF3IP3 only binds to multimerized and active MAVS‐Region III but not inactive MAVS‐Region III, indicating it is a signaling‐dependent interaction. Furthermore, TRAF3 recruitment to MAVS was severely impaired in the absence of TRAF3IP3 in response to virus infection. Our findings thus shed light into an unidentified mechanism suggesting that TRAF3IP3 mediates the recruitment of TRAF3 to MAVS upon virus infection, highlighting the involvement of TRAF3 in antiviral signaling in a sense. We further investigated the antiviral role of TRAF3IP3 in vivo . In the absence of TRAF3IP3, type I IFN induction was severely compromised upon RNA virus infection in mouse primary cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that ISG54 but not IL‐6 induction was impaired in Traf3ip3 −/− cells, indicating that TRAF3IP3 was indeed required for TBK1‐IRF3 but not IKK‐NF‐κB activation and nevertheless essential for IFNs induction. As a result, Traf3ip3 −/− mice were defective in antiviral innate immunity and more vulnerable to VSV‐mediated killing than wild‐type mice, providing supportive evidence demonstrating the antiviral function of TRAF3IP3 in vivo .

In addition to Region III, MAVS also harbors Region I and II. MAVS‐Region I and II contain putative TRAF protein‐binding sites, which presumably mediate TRAF2/3/5/6 recruitment directly upon virus infection. In support of this view, point mutations of these TRAF‐binding sites completely disrupt the function of Region I and II in activating downstream IKK‐NF‐κB (Liu et al , 2013 ; Shi et al , 2015 ). These studies emphasized the importance of putative TRAF‐binding sites of MAVS in antiviral signaling. Intriguingly, MAVS‐Region III could also recruit TRAF3 and TRAF5 for TBK1‐IRF3 activation in response to virus infection, regardless of that it does not harbor any putative TRAF‐binding sites (Shi et al , 2015 ). Our identification of TRAF3IP3 involved in RIG‐I‐MAVS signaling revealed a mechanism underlying TRAF3 recruitment to MAVS through the adaptor protein TRAF3IP3 upon virus infection. In light of that MAVS‐Region III could also recruit TRAF5 for TBK1‐IRF3 activation upon virus infection, it is possible that there might be unknown molecules mediating the recruitment of TRAF5 to MAVS‐Region III for antiviral signaling. Furthermore, considering that TRAF proteins play redundant roles in MAVS downstream signaling, it will be interesting to further investigate the remaining question as to how or whether these TRAF proteins might promote the activation of downstream signaling molecules including TBK1 and IKK by different mechanisms.
