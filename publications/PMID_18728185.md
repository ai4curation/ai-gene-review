General methods to engineer genetically encoded, reversible, light-mediated 
control over protein function would be useful in many areas of biomedical 
research and technology. We describe a system that yields such photo-control 
over actin assembly. We fused the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 in its GDP-bound form 
to the photosensory domain of phytochrome B (PhyB) and fused the Cdc42 effector, 
the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP), to the light-dependent PhyB-binding 
domain of phytochrome interacting factor 3 (Pif3). Upon red light illumination, 
the fusion proteins bind each other, activating WASP, and consequently 
stimulating actin assembly by the WASP target, the Arp2/3 complex. Binding and 
WASP activation are reversed by far-red illumination. Our approach, in which the 
biochemical specificity of the nucleotide switch in Cdc42 is overridden by the 
light-dependent PhyB-Pif3 interaction, should be generally applicable to other 
GTPase-effector pairs.

Abstract

General methods to engineer genetically encoded, reversible, light-mediated control over protein function would be useful in many areas of biomedical research and technology. We describe a system that yields such photo-control over actin assembly. We fused the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 in its GDP-bound form to the photosensory domain of phytochrome B (PhyB) and fused the Cdc42 effector, the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP), to the light-dependent PhyB-binding domain of phytochrome interacting factor 3 (Pif3). Upon red light illumination, the fusion proteins bind each other, activating WASP, and consequently stimulating actin assembly by the WASP target, the Arp2/3 complex. Binding and WASP activation are reversed by far-red illumination. Our approach, in which the biochemical specificity of the nucleotide switch in Cdc42 is overridden by the light-dependent PhyB-Pif3 interaction, should be generally applicable to other GTPase-effector pairs.

Discussion

We have shown here that the nucleotide switch in Cdc42 can be overridden through artificial dimerization of the GTPase with WASP. This has led to a system in which the activity of WASP can be controlled with light in reversible fashion using genetically encoded components. Such an approach should be generally applicable, provided that other GDP-bound GTPases can also activate their effectors when at high concentration. Several pieces of data suggest that this will likely be the case. Most directly, the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of G Sα have been shown to activate adenylyl cyclase to similar levels, although the latter requires higher concentrations to do so ( 28 ). This has been explained by a model in which G Sα exists in equilibrium between an inactive conformation (G) and an active conformation (G*), which are differentially favored by GDP- and GTP-binding, respectively. G* has higher affinity for adenylyl cyclase and can activate it. Because both nucleotide states of G Sα can access the G* conformation, both are capable of activating adenylyl cyclase. However, because the GDP state favors G, its affinity for adenylyl cyclase is lower than that of the GTP state. Reciprocally, adenylyl cyclase binding shifts the allosteric equilibrium in G Sα toward G*. A large body of spectroscopic data indicates that the Ras GTPase also exists in an analogous equilibrium between two conformations in both the GDP- and GTP-bound states ( 29 – 31 ). In addition, binding of the effector Raf strongly shifts the equilibrium to one state ( 29 , 31 ). Although it has not been tested experimentally, these data suggest that like Cdc42 and G Sα , Ras(GDP) can sample a GTP-like conformation, which could act on Raf similarly to Ras(GTP). Finally, two-state behavior has also been observed for Ran(GMPPNP) spectroscopically ( 29 ), and Ran(GDP) has been found capable of binding its effector RanBP1 with micromolar affinity ( 32 ). These observations on several distantly related family members argue that many GDP-bound GTPases should be capable of activating their effectors at sufficiently high concentrations. Thus, our approach to generating light-controlled GTPase-effector systems by overriding the nucleotide switch should have broad applicability. Given that many biological signaling events are driven by changes in the affinity of protein–protein interactions, this approach to light control may have utility in numerous other systems as well.

A number of hurdles must be overcome to implement PhyB-Pif3-based photoswitches of the type that we describe here in vivo . Principal among these is the need to generate holo-PhyB in eukaryotic systems. This may be accomplished as we have here, through expression of Ho1 and HY2, albeit at the expense of significant cell engineering. Alternatively, it may be possible to simply add the PCB chromophore (isolated from algae) to cells expressing the PhyB fusion. Because yeast readily take up PCB in this manner and produce holo-PhyB ( 17 , 18 ), this may ultimately prove to be the more straightforward approach in higher eukaryotes as well. It will also be important to control both the relative and absolute levels of the PhyB and Pif3 fusions to produce quantitatively defined light-dependent activity, based on the affinities of the two components of the switch. This difficulty may be lessened somewhat through designing reporters of activity/binding directly into the photoswitch, for example by attaching CFP and YFP fluorophores to the two components of the switch. In such a design, intermolecular FRET would independently report on the binding status of the switch ( 1 ). Finally, as with all photo-controlled systems, spatial precision will be decreased by diffusion of the components after illumination. However, in contrast to photo-activation systems, where the active form remains active while it diffuses, in PhyB-based photoswitchable systems, it may be possible to achieve highly precise activation through local red light illumination coupled with global far-red illumination. If these difficulties can be overcome, the PhyB-Pif3 system could have great utility in understanding biology through the rapidly reversible spatial and temporal control of protein activity.
