The identification of modular units of cellular function is a major goal for 
proteomic research. Protein complexes represent important building blocks 
defining functionality and deciphering their composition remains a major 
challenge. Here, we have designed a new tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag 
(termed S3S-tag) for the isolation of protein complexes. Specifically, the 
immune cell protein ADAP that regulates integrin adhesion was fused either C- or 
N-terminally to the S3S-tag. After retroviral transduction of a vector 
containing S3S-tagged ADAP and internal ribosomal entry site encoded enhanced 
green fluorescent protein (eGFP), Jurkat T cells were sorted according to eGFP 
expression and further selected for expression of TAP-tagged protein close to 
endogenous levels. The combination of a cleavable S-tag and a Strep-tag II 
allowed for the isolation of ADAP and associated proteins. Subsequently, stable 
isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture-based mass spectrometric 
analysis was performed to identify potentially specific interaction partners. 
Co-purification of the known interaction partner Src kinase-associated 
phosphoprotein of 55 kDa indicates the validity of our approach, while the 
identification of the ENA/VASP family member EVL, the guanine nucleotide 
exchange factor GEF-H1 and the adaptor protein DOCK2 corroborates a link between 
ADAP-mediated integrin regulation and the cytoskeleton.
