The eukaryotic RNA exosome participates extensively in RNA processing and 
degradation. In human cells, three accessory factors (RBM7, ZCCHC8 and hMTR4) 
interact to form the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, which directs a 
subset of non-coding RNAs for exosomal degradation. Here we elucidate how RBM7 
is incorporated in the NEXT complex. We identify a proline-rich segment of 
ZCCHC8 as the interaction site for the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) of RBM7 and 
present the crystal structure of the corresponding complex at 2.0 Å resolution. 
On the basis of the structure, we identify a proline-rich segment within the 
splicing factor SAP145 with strong similarity to ZCCHC8. We show that this 
segment of SAP145 not only binds the RRM region of another splicing factor SAP49 
but also the RRM of RBM7. These dual interactions of RBM7 with the exosome and 
the spliceosome suggest a model whereby NEXT might recruit the exosome to 
degrade intronic RNAs.
