The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), an evolutionarily conserved surveillance 
pathway, prevents chromosome segregation in response to conditions that disrupt 
the kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Removal of the checkpoint-activating 
stimulus initiates recovery during which spindle integrity is restored, 
kinetochores become bi-oriented, and cells initiate anaphase. Whether recovery 
ensues passively after the removal of checkpoint stimulus, or requires mediation 
by specific effectors remains uncertain. Here, we report two unrecognized 
functions of yeast Cdk1 required for efficient recovery from SAC-induced arrest. 
We show that Cdk1 promotes kinetochore bi-orientation during recovery by 
restraining premature spindle elongation thereby extinguishing SAC signalling. 
Moreover, Cdk1 is essential for sustaining the expression of Cdc20, an activator 
of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) required for anaphase 
progression. We suggest a model in which Cdk1 activity promotes recovery from 
SAC-induced mitotic arrest by regulating bi-orientation and APC/C activity. Our 
findings provide fresh insights into the regulation of mitosis and have 
implications for the therapeutic efficacy of anti-mitotic drugs.
