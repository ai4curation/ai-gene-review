Three cyclophilin inhibitors (DEBIO-025, SCY635, and NIM811) are currently in 
clinical trials for hepatitis C therapy. The mechanism of action of these, 
however, is not completely understood. There are at least 16 cyclophilins 
expressed in human cells which are involved in a diverse set of cellular 
processes. Large-scale siRNA experiments, chemoproteomic assays with cyclophilin 
binding compounds, and mRNA profiling of HCV replicon containing cells were used 
to identify the cyclophilins that are instrumental to HCV replication. The 
previously reported cyclophilin A was confirmed and additional cyclophilin 
containing pathways were identified. Together, the experiments provide strong 
evidence that NIM811 reduces viral replication by inhibition of multiple 
cyclophilins and pathways with protein trafficking as the most strongly and 
persistently affected pathway.
