Consistent with findings of Wnt pathway members involved in vascular cells, a 
role for Wnt/Frizzled signaling has recently emerged in vascular cell 
development. Among the few Wnt family members implicated in vessel formation in 
adult, Wnt7b and Frizzled 4 have been shown as involved in vessel formation in 
the lung and in the retina, respectively. Our previous work has shown a role for 
secreted Frizzled-related protein-1 (sFRP-1), a proposed Wnt signaling 
inhibitor, in neovascularization after an ischemic event and demonstrated its 
role as a potent angiogenic factor. However the mechanisms involved have not 
been investigated. Here, we show that sFRP-1 treatment increases endothelial 
cell spreading on extracellular matrix as revealed by actin stress fiber 
reorganization in an integrin-dependent manner. We demonstrate that sFRP-1 can 
interact with Wnt receptors Frizzled 4 and 7 on endothelial cells to transduce 
downstream to cellular machineries requiring Rac-1 activity in cooperation with 
GSK-3beta. sFRP-1 overexpression in endothelium specifically reversed the 
inactivation of GSK-3 beta and increased neovascularization in ischemia-induced 
angiogenesis in mouse hindlimb. This study illustrates a regulated pathway by 
sFRP-1 involving GSK-3beta and Rac-1 in endothelial cell cytoskeletal 
reorganization and in neovessel formation.
