The lower jaw skeleton is derived from cephalic neural crest (CNC) cells that 
reside in the mandibular region of the first pharyngeal arch. Endothelin-A 
receptor (Ednra) signaling in crest cells is crucial for their development, as 
Ednra(-/-) mice are born with severe craniofacial defects resulting in neonatal 
lethality. In this study, we undertook a more detailed analysis of mandibular 
arch development in Ednra(-/-) embryos to better understand the cellular and 
molecular basis for these defects. We show that most lower jaw structures in 
Ednra(-/-) embryos undergo a homeotic transformation into maxillary-like 
structures similar to those observed in Dlx5/Dlx6(-/-) embryos, though lower 
incisors are still present in both mutant embryos. These structural changes are 
preceded by aberrant expansion of proximal first arch gene expression into the 
distal arch, in addition to the previously described loss of a Dlx6/Hand2 
expression network. However, a small distal Hand2 expression domain remains. 
Although this distal expression is not dependent on either Ednra or Dlx5/Dlx6 
function, it may require one or more GATA factors. Using fate analysis, we show 
that these distal Hand2-positive cells probably contribute to lower incisor 
formation. Together, our results suggest that the establishment of a 'mandibular 
identity' during lower jaw development requires both Ednra-dependent and 
-independent signaling pathways.
