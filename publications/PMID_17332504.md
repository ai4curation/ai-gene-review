The tumor suppressor p53 is a key transcriptional factor regulating the 
induction of cellular senescence by oncogenic signals. The activity of p53 is 
regulated by recruitment into promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-nuclear bodies (NBs) 
as well as by stabilization through posttranslational modifications such as 
phosphorylation and acetylation. Here we found that MORC3 (microrchidia3)-ATPase 
activated p53 and induced cellular senescence in normal human and mouse 
fibroblasts but not p53-/- fibroblasts. Conversely, genotoxic stress-induced 
phosphorylation and stabilization of p53 but barely increased its 
transcriptional activity in Morc3-/- fibroblasts. MORC3 localized on PML-NBs in 
presence of PML and mediated recruitment of p53 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) 
into PML-NBs. In contrast, expression of ATPase activity-deficient mutant 
MORC3-E35A or siRNA repression of MORC3 impaired the localization of p53 and 
Sp100 but not CBP on PML-NBs. These results suggest that MORC3 regulates p53 
activity and localization into PML-NBs. We identified a new molecular mechanism 
that regulates the activity of nuclear proteins by localization to a nuclear 
subdomain.

The tumor suppressor p53 is a key transcriptional factor regulating the induction of cellular senescence by oncogenic signals. The activity of p53 is regulated by recruitment into promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-nuclear bodies (NBs) as well as by stabilization through posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Here we found that MORC3 (microrchidia3)-ATPase activated p53 and induced cellular senescence in normal human and mouse fibroblasts but not p53−/− fibroblasts. Conversely, genotoxic stress–induced phosphorylation and stabilization of p53 but barely increased its transcriptional activity in Morc3−/− fibroblasts. MORC3 localized on PML-NBs in presence of PML and mediated recruitment of p53 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) into PML-NBs. In contrast, expression of ATPase activity-deficient mutant MORC3-E35A or siRNA repression of MORC3 impaired the localization of p53 and Sp100 but not CBP on PML-NBs. These results suggest that MORC3 regulates p53 activity and localization into PML-NBs. We identified a new molecular mechanism that regulates the activity of nuclear proteins by localization to a nuclear subdomain.
