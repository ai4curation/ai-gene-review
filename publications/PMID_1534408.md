The cAMP response element (CRE) is an octanucleotide motif (TGACGTCA) that 
mediates diverse transcriptional regulatory effects. In this report we describe 
the isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA that encodes a CRE 
binding protein called CREB-2. Like other ATF/CREB transcription factors, the 
351-amino acid CREB-2 protein contains a COOH-terminal leucine-zipper motif and 
an adjacent basic domain. CREB-2 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in human tumor 
cell lines and mouse organs suggesting that it is involved in regulating 
transcription in a wide variety of cell types. Overexpression of CREB-2 resulted 
in a consistent and significant repression of CRE-dependent transcription in 
CV-1 cells. Deletional analyses localized the transcriptional repressor activity 
of CREB-2 to a 102-amino acid COOH-terminal region (amino acids 249-351) that 
contains the leucine-zipper and basic domains of the molecule. These results 
demonstrate that CRE-dependent transcription can be both positively and 
negatively regulated by structurally related members of the ATF/CREB family.
