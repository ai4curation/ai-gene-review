Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells provide a valuable model system for 
uncovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms of differentiation of 
proerythroid cells in culture. In order to characterize genes and gene 
expression patterns unique for erythropoiesis, we: (i) cloned and sequenced a 
226bp cDNA encoding portion of the 3'-end B22 subunit of mitochondrial 
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I); (ii) assessed the steady state level 
of RNA transcripts encoded by B22, cytochrome c oxidase (COX II, COX IV) and 
c-myc genes in MEL cells undergoing terminal differentiation induced by 
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and/or 2-(3-ethylureido)-6-methylpyridine; and (iii) 
investigated whether the gene expression patterns of B22, COX IV and c-myc genes 
seen in differentiating cells are affected by N(6)-methyladenosine, an inhibitor 
of commitment and RNA methylation. These studies have indicated: (a) c-myc, COX 
II and COX IV genes exhibited biphasic expression pattern; a transient 
accumulation of c-myc, COX II and COX IV mRNAs was followed by a decline after 
36hr incubation with DMSO and/or 2-(3-ethylureido)-6-methylpyridine, (b) B22 
gene expression declined progressively in differentiated cells, (c) blockade of 
differentiation of MEL cells with N(6)-methyladenosine failed to prevent the 
transient accumulation of c-myc, COX II and COX IV mRNAs, but abrogated the 
irreversible expression of all four genes. These findings indicated that B22, 
c-myc, COX II and COX IV genes are gradually repressed in terminally 
differentiating MEL cells presumably via different patterns of expression 
(gradual vs. biphasic). Overall, these results showed that erythroid maturation 
of MEL cells is accompanied by transcriptional inactivation (or repression) of 
at least three genes encoding mitochondrial enzyme subunits involved in cell 
respiration.
