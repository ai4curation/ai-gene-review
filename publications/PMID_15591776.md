not decrease the secretion of apoB-48 from intestinal CaCo-2 cells.

We compared the acute effect of insulin on the human colonic intestinal 
epithelial cell line CaCo-2 and the transformed human hepatic cell line HepG2. 
Over 24 h, 100 nM and 10 microM insulin significantly inhibited the secretion of 
apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 from HepG2 cells to 63 and 49% of control, 
respectively. Insulin had no effect on the secretion of apoB-48 from CaCo-2 
cells. There was no effect of insulin on the cholesterol ester or free 
cholesterol concentrations in HepG2 or CaCo-2 cells. HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells 
bound insulin with high affinity, leading to similar stimulation of insulin 
receptor protein tyrosine kinase activation. Protein kinase C or 
mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in the presence or absence of insulin 
was not correlated with apoB-48 production in CaCo-2 cells. Therefore, insulin 
acutely decreases the secretion of apoB-100 in hepatic HepG2 cells, but does not 
acutely modulate the production or secretion of apoB-48 from CaCo-2 intestinal 
cells.
