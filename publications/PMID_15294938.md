CD6 is a cell surface receptor expressed on immature thymocytes and mature T and 
B1a lymphocytes. The ultimate function of CD6 has not been deciphered yet, but 
much evidence supports a role for CD6 in T cell activation and differentiation. 
In this study, we show that a fraction of CD6 molecules physically associates 
with the TCR/CD3 complex by coimmunoprecipitation, cocapping, and fluorescence 
resonance energy transfer experiments. Image analysis of Ag-specific T-APC 
conjugates demonstrated that CD6 and its ligand, activated leukocyte cell 
adhesion molecule (CD166), colocalize with TCR/CD3 at the center of the 
immunological synapse, the so-called central supramolecular activation cluster. 
The addition of a soluble rCD6 form significantly reduced the number of mature 
Ag-specific T-APC conjugates, indicating that CD6 mediates early cell-cell 
interactions needed for immunological synapse maturation to proceed. This was in 
agreement with the dose-dependent inhibition of CD3-mediated T cell 
proliferation induced by soluble rCD6. Taken together, our data illustrate the 
important role played by the intra- and intercellular molecular interactions 
mediated by CD6 during T cell activation and proliferation processes.
