The yeast SNF-SWI complex is required for transcriptional activation of diverse 
genes and has been shown to alter chromatin structure. The complex has at least 
10 components, including SNF2/SWI2, SNF5, SNF6, SWI1/ADR6, and SWI3, and has 
been widely conserved in eukaryotes. Here we report the characterization of a 
new component. We identified proteins that interact in the two-hybrid system 
with the N-terminal region of SNF2, preceding the ATPase domain. In addition to 
SWI3, we recovered a new 19-kDa protein, designated SNF11. Like other SNF/SWI 
proteins, SNF11 functions as a transcriptional activator in genetic assays. 
SNF11 interacts with SNF2 in vitro and copurifies with the SNF-SWI complex from 
yeast cells. Using a specific antibody, we showed that SNF11 
coimmunoprecipitates with members of the SNF-SWI complex and that SNF11 is 
tightly and stoichiometrically associated with the complex. Furthermore, SNF11 
was detected in purified SNF-SWI complex by staining with Coomassie blue dye; 
its presence previously went unrecognized because it does not stain with silver. 
SNF11 interacts with a 40-residue sequence of SNF2 that is highly conserved, 
suggesting that SNF11 homologs exist in other organisms.
