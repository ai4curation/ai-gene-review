Human erythrocyte nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) is a hexameric 
enzyme consisting of two kinds of polypeptide chains, A and B. By random 
association (A6, A5B...AB5, B6) these polypeptides form isoenzymes differing in 
their isoelectric point. Chains A and B of NDP kinase were purified by 
ion-exchange chromatography under denaturing conditions. Upon mixing and 
renaturation, the isozymic pattern of NDP kinase obtained by conventional 
methods was restored. Antibodies raised against purified chains showed 
significant cross-reactivity, both in immunoblot experiments and activity 
inhibition studies. Sequence determination showed that both chains consisted of 
152 amino acid residues corresponding to Mr or 17,143 (chain A) and 17,294 
(chain B), respectively. There was high homology between the two sequences (88% 
identity). The phosphorylation site on the enzyme is located at His-118. Chain A 
was identical with human Nm23 protein, which has been reported as a potential 
suppressor protein in tumor metastasis and chain B was identical with Nm23-H2 
protein.
