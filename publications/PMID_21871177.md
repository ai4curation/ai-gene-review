Ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) is a multifunctional protein involved in 
translation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The relationship between rpS3 and 
cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) involved in cell cycle regulation is not yet 
known. Here, we show that rpS3 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 in G2/M phase. 
Co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays revealed that Cdk1 interacted 
with rpS3. An in vitro kinase assay showed that Cdk1 phosphorylated rpS3 
protein. Phosphorylation of rpS3 increased in nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells; 
however, treatment with Cdk1 inhibitor or Cdk1 siRNA significantly attenuated 
this phosphorylation event. The phosphorylation of a mutant form of rpS3, T221A, 
was significantly reduced compared with wild-type rpS3. Decreased 
phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of T221A was much more pronounced in 
G2/M phase. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of rpS3 by Cdk1 
occurs at Thr221 during G2/M phase and, moreover, that this event is important 
for nuclear accumulation of rpS3.
