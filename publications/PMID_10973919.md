Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated as mediators of tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) -induced apoptosis. In addition to leading to cell 
death, ROS can also promote cell growth and/or survival. We investigated these 
two roles of ROS in TNF-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated with TNF produced an intracellular burst 
of ROS. Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of a dominant negative form of the 
small GTPase Rac1 (Rac1N17) partially suppressed the TNF-induced oxidative burst 
without affecting TNF-induced mitochondrial ROS production. HUVECs were 
protected from TNF-induced apoptosis. Expression of Rac1N17 blocked TNF-induced 
activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), increased activity of 
caspase-3, and markedly augmented endothelial cell susceptibility to TNF-induced 
apoptosis. Direct inhibition of NF-kappaB through adenoviral expression of the 
super repressor form of inhibitor of kappaBalpha (I-kappaB S32/36A) also 
increased susceptibility of HUVECs to TNF-induced apoptosis. Rotenone, a 
mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor, suppressed TNF-induced 
mitochondrial ROS production, proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3, and 
apoptosis. These findings show that Rac1 is an important regulator of 
TNF-induced ROS production in endothelial cells. Moreover, they suggest that 
Rac1-dependent ROS, directly or indirectly, lead to protection against 
TNF-induced death, whereas mitochondrial-derived ROS promote TNF-induced 
apoptosis.
