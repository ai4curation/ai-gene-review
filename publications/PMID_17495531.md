The transitions of the cell cycle are regulated by the cyclin dependent protein 
kinases (CDKs). The cyclins activate their respective CDKs and confer substrate 
recognition properties. We report the structure of phospho-CDK2/cyclin B and 
show that cyclin B confers M phase-like properties on CDK2, the kinase that is 
usually associated with S phase. Cyclin B produces an almost identical activated 
conformation of CDK2 as that produced by cyclin A. There are differences between 
cyclin A and cyclin B at the recruitment site, which in cyclin A is used to 
recruit substrates containing an RXL motif. Because of sequence differences this 
site in cyclin B binds RXL motifs more weakly than in cyclin A. Despite 
similarity in kinase structures, phospho-CDK2/cyclin B phosphorylates 
substrates, such as nuclear lamin and a model peptide derived from p107, at 
sequences SPXX that differ from the canonical CDK2/cyclin A substrate 
recognition motif, SPXK. CDK2/cyclin B phosphorylation at these non-canonical 
sites is not dependent on the presence of a RXL recruitment motif. The p107 
peptide contains two SP motifs each followed by a non-canonical sequence of 
which only one site (Ser640) is phosphorylated by pCDK2/cyclin A while two sites 
are phosphorylated by pCDK2/cyclin B. The second site is too close to the RXL 
motif to allow the cyclin A recruitment site to be effective, as previous work 
has shown that there must be at least 16 residues between the catalytic site 
serine and the RXL motif. Thus the cyclins A and B in addition to their role in 
promoting the activatory conformational switch in CDK2, also provide 
differential substrate specificity.
