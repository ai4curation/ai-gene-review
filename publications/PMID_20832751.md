In vitro studies have shown that inhibition of ribosomal biogenesis can activate 
p53 through ribosomal protein (RP)-mediated suppression of Mdm2 E3 ligase 
activity. To study the physiological significance of the RP-Mdm2 interaction, we 
generated mice carrying a cancer-associated cysteine-to-phenylalanine 
substitution in the zinc finger of Mdm2 that disrupted its binding to RPL5 and 
RPL11. Mice harboring this mutation, retain normal p53 response to DNA damage, 
but lack of p53 response to perturbations in ribosome biogenesis. Loss of 
RP-Mdm2 interaction significantly accelerates Eμ-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. 
Furthermore, ribosomal perturbation-induced p53 response does not require tumor 
suppressor p19ARF. Collectively, our findings establish RP-Mdm2 interaction as a 
genuine p53 stress-signaling pathway activated by aberrant ribosome biogenesis 
and essential for safeguarding against oncogenic c-MYC-induced tumorigenesis.

Introduction

The p53 transcription factor interacts with a large number of proteins and plays a central role in regulating cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis ( Vogelstein et al., 2000 ). The function of p53 is negatively controlled by Mdm2 (HDM2 in humans, henceforth as Mdm2), which itself is a transcriptional target of p53, thus constituting an auto regulatory feedback loop ( Picksley and Lane, 1993 ). Mdm2 controls the activity of p53 and is regulated in response to a multitude of stressors, one of these stressors is the so called nucleolar stress (a.k.a. ribosomal stress) ( Rubbi and Milner, 2003 ). Previous evidence demonstrates a nucleolar stress response to a low dose (5 nM) of Actinomycin D (Act D) ( Dai and Lu, 2004 ; Dai et al., 2004 ; Jin et al., 2004 ), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) ( Gilkes et al., 2006 ; Sun et al., 2007 ), serum depletion and contact inhibition ( Bhat et al., 2004 ), mycophenolic acid (MPA)-mediated depletion of GTP ( Sun et al., 2008 ), or interfering with nucleolar function by ectopic overexpression of nucleostemin ( Dai et al., 2008 ). At low concentrations (e.g. <10 nM), Act D selectively inhibits ribosomal biogenesis through inhibiting pol I-dependent transcription of rRNA ( Iapalucci-Espinoza and Franze-Fernandez, 1979 ; Perry and Kelley, 1970 ). 5-FU is a pyrimidine analog whose metabolite, FUTP, is extensively incorporated into RNA, disrupting normal RNA processing ( Longley et al., 2003 ). MPA inhibits de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, leading to depletion of intracellular guanine nucleotide and blockage of de novo RNA synthesis ( Allison, 2005 ). As the prime location for ribosome biogenesis, the nucleolus is highly susceptible to perturbations in the process of ribosome assembly, thereby clarifying how nucleolar stress is often synonymous with “ribosomal stress”.

Ribosome biogenesis is an essential cellular process that involves three fundamental steps: coordinated expression of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal protein (RP), processing of rRNA, and assembly of the 40S and 60S ribosome subunits ( Perry, 2007 ). Perturbation of any step in this process is thought to lead to nucleolar stress, triggering specific binding of Mdm2 to several RPs, including L11 ( Fumagalli et al., 2009 ; Lohrum et al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2003 ), L23 ( Dai et al., 2004 ; Jin et al., 2004 ), and L5 ( Dai and Lu, 2004 ). Increased binding of ribosomal proteins to Mdm2 leads to p53 stability and transactivation. In addition to L5, L11, and L23, additional ribosomal proteins such as S7 ( Chen et al., 2007 ; Zhu et al., 2009 ) and L26 ( Ofir-Rosenfeld et al., 2008 ) have also been shown to interact with Mdm2. The consequence of the S7-Mdm2 interaction resembles that of the other RPs in terms of binding to Mdm2 and activation of p53. However, surprising findings show that MdmX, a homologue of Mdm2, can facilitate S7’s suppression of Mdm2 and that S7, itself a substrate for Mdm2 ubiquitination, acts as both an effector and affector of Mdm2 ( Zhu et al., 2009 ). The interaction of L26 with Mdm2 appears to perform a different function. L26 was found to increase the translational rate of p53 mRNA through binding to its 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and in this case Mdm2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for ubiquitylation and degradation of L26, thereby inhibiting p53 translation ( Ofir-Rosenfeld et al., 2008 ). Collectively, these findings indicate that RPs could play a pivotal role in mediating a p53 response to nucleolar stress (reviewed in ( Zhang and Lu, 2009 ))

Mdm2 contains three highly conserved regions: the N-terminus, the C-terminus, and the central zinc finger area. The N-terminal conserved domain is important for p53 binding. The C-terminal domain contains a RING finger essential for the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of Mdm2. The function of the central acidic domain, including a highly conserved C4 zinc finger, is not fully understood. Intriguingly, several small basic proteins that function to inhibit Mdm2, including p19Arf and each of the aforementioned ribosomal proteins, all interact with the conserved central acidic domain of Mdm2 ( Figure 1A ), suggesting that this region might serve as a site for receiving and integrating various Mdm2-regulatory signals into the p53 pathway ( Dai et al., 2006 ).

Mdm2 gene amplification is the predominant mechanism ascribed to oncogenic activation and has been detected in many types of human cancers including soft tissue sarcomas ( Oliner et al., 1992 ) and brain tumors ( Corvi et al., 1995 ; Reifenberger et al., 1993 ). In addition to gene amplification and protein overexpression, mutations within the Mdm2 gene have been reported in several types of human cancers ( Schlott et al., 1997 ; Tamborini et al., 2001 ). Intriguingly, many of the cancer associated Mdm2 mutations occur at or near the central zinc finger, including point mutations altering one of the conserved zinc-coordinating cysteines and truncations around the zinc finger. In vitro studies have shown that mutations at the zinc-coordinating cysteine residues disrupts Mdm2 binding to L5 and L11, and as a result diminishes the capacity of Mdm2 to respond to nucleolar stress ( Lindstrom et al., 2007 ). However, despite recent evidence from multiple laboratories corroborating a putative RP-Mdm2-p53 signaling pathway, the validity of RP mediated signaling to p53 has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. The current study was designed to investigate this.

Discussion

A number of ribosomal proteins, including L5, L11, L23, L26, S3 and S7, have been shown to interact with and inhibit the E3 ligase function of Mdm2, thereby stabilizing and activating p53 ( Chen et al., 2007 ; Dai and Lu, 2004 ; Dai et al., 2004 ; Jin et al., 2004 ; Lohrum et al., 2003 ; Ofir-Rosenfeld et al., 2008 ; Zhang et al., 2003 ; Zhu et al., 2009 ). The physiological significance of the RP-Mdm2 interaction, however, has not been previously studied in vivo . In this study, we generated and analyzed mice carrying a C305F knockin mutation in the Mdm2 zinc finger. The mutation disrupts the interaction of Mdm2 with L5 and L11. Several important observations have been made from this study.
