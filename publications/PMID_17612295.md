Interactions between proteins are central to most biological processes; 
consequently, understanding the latter requires identification of all possible 
protein interactions within a cell. To extend the range of existing assays for 
the detection of protein interactions, we present a novel genetic screening 
assay, the cytosolic yeast two-hybrid system (cytoY2H), which is based on the 
split-ubiquitin technique and detects protein-protein interactions in the 
cytoplasm. We show that the assay can be applied to a wide range of proteins 
that are difficult to study in the classical yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system, 
including transcription factors such as p53 and members of the NF-kappaB 
complex. Furthermore, we applied the cytoY2H system to cDNA library screening 
and identified several new interaction partners of Uri1p, an uncharacterized 
yeast protein. The cytoY2H system extends existing methods for the detection of 
protein interactions by providing a convenient solution for screening a wide 
range of transcriptionally active proteins.
