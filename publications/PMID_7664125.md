The structure of Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelC, a member of the 
largest cellulase family (family A), has been determined at 2.15 A resolution. 
The protein folds into an (alpha/beta)8 barrel, with a deep active-site cleft 
generated by the insertion of a helical subdomain. The structure of the 
catalytic core of xylanase XynZ, which belongs to xylanase family F, has been 
determined at 1.4 A resolution. In spite of significant differences in substrate 
specificity and structure (including the absence of the helical subdomain), the 
general polypeptide folding pattern, architecture of the active site and 
catalytic mechanism of XynZ and CelC are similar, suggesting a common 
evolutionary origin.
