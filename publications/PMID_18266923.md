Ultraviolet-B light (UV-B) regulates the expression of genes in a wavelength- 
and fluence rate-dependent fashion. A signaling pathway consisting of 
CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (COP1) and UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR 8) 
mediates responsiveness to longer wavelength, low intensity UV-B 
light-activating, for example, HY5 gene expression. By contrast, transcription 
of another group of genes, including ANAC13, modulated by shorter wavelength, 
higher intensity UV-B is controlled by a yet unknown and largely 
COP1-independent signaling cascade. Here we provide evidence by promoter 
deletion analysis, and characterization of genetic mutants displaying aberrant 
expression patterns, that two cis-regulatory elements, designated MRE(ANAC13) 
and UVBox(ANAC13), are required for maximal UV-B induction of the ANAC13 gene in 
transgenic plants. These elements are located in the proximal 150-bp region of 
the ANAC13 promoter. They show no significant similarity to each other; the 
putative MRE(ANAC13) (-AACCTT-) is closely related to MRE(CHS) (-AACCTA-) found 
in the CHALCONE SYNTHASE (CHS) gene, whereas UVBox(ANAC13) (with core sequence 
CAAG) represents a novel cis-regulatory element. The novel UVBox(ANAC13) 
sequence is significantly enriched in the promoter region of a subset of 
UV-B-induced genes with similar activation properties as ANAC13. In addition, we 
demonstrate that expression of a chimeric gene containing only the dimerized 
12-mer containing UVBox(ANAC13) fused to a minimal CaMV35S promoter/luciferase 
reporter is (i) efficiently induced by shorter wavelength, higher intensity 
UV-B, but (ii) does not respond either to longer wavelength UV-B and red light 
or (iii) to abscisic acid treatment and osmotic, salt, heat and cold stresses.
