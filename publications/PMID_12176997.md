Hsp90 is a chaperone required for the conformational maturation of certain 
signaling proteins including Raf, cdk4, and steroid receptors. Natural products 
and synthetic small molecules that bind to the ATP-binding pocket in the 
amino-terminal domain of Hsp90 inhibit its function and cause the degradation of 
these client proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 function in cells causes 
down-regulation of an Akt kinase-dependent pathway required for D-cyclin 
expression and retinoblastoma protein-dependent G(1) arrest. Intracellular Akt 
is associated with Hsp90 and Cdc37 in a complex in which Akt kinase is active 
and regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Functional Hsp90 is required for 
the stability of Akt in the complex. Occupancy of the ATP-binding pocket by 
inhibitors is associated with the ubiquitination of Akt and its targeting to the 
proteasome, where it is degraded. This results in a shortening of the half-life 
of Akt from 36 to 12 h and an 80% reduction in its expression. Akt and its 
activating kinase, PDK1, are the only members of the protein kinase A/protein 
kinase B/protein kinase C-like kinase family that are affected by Hsp90 
inhibitors. Thus, transduction of growth factor signaling via the Akt and Raf 
pathways requires functional Hsp90 and can be coordinately blocked by its 
inhibition.
