SUMO-1 conjugation modulates numerous cellular functions, including the 
subnuclear localization of its target proteins. The WT1 tumor suppressor encodes 
a four-zinc finger protein with distinct splicing isoforms. WT1(-KTS), encoding 
uninterrupted zinc fingers, functions as a transcription factor and has a 
diffusely nuclear distribution; WT1(+KTS), with an insertion of three amino 
acids (KTS) between zinc fingers three and four, localizes to discrete nuclear 
speckles, the function of which is unknown. Because the SUMO-1 E2-conjugating 
enzyme, Ubc9, interacts with WT1, we tested whether sumoylation modulates the 
cellular localization of WT1. We find here that both WT1 isoforms are directly 
sumoylated on lysine residues 73 and 177. Although RNA interference-mediated 
Ubc9 depletion effectively suppresses WT1 nuclear speckles, a SUMO-1-deficient 
WT1(+KTS)(K73, 177R) double mutant retains localization to speckles. Thus, 
direct sumoylation of WT1 is not responsible for its cellular localization, and 
other sumoylated proteins may target WT1 to these nuclear structures. 
Identification of other components of WT1-associated speckles is likely to 
provide clues to their function.
