Eukaryotes initiate autophagy to cope with the lack of external nutrients, which 
requires the activation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
(NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). However, the mechanisms 
underlying the starvation-induced Sirt1 activation for autophagy initiation 
remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a conventional glycolytic enzyme, is a critical mediator 
of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-driven Sirt1 activation. Under glucose 
starvation, but not amino acid starvation, cytoplasmic GAPDH is phosphorylated 
on Ser122 by activated AMPK. This causes GAPDH to redistribute into the nucleus. 
Inside the nucleus, GAPDH interacts directly with Sirt1, displacing Sirt1's 
repressor and causing Sirt1 to become activated. Preventing this shift of GAPDH 
abolishes Sirt1 activation and autophagy, while enhancing it, through 
overexpression of nuclear-localized GAPDH, increases Sirt1 activation and 
autophagy. GAPDH is thus a pivotal and central regulator of autophagy under 
glucose deficiency, undergoing AMPK-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear 
translocation to activate Sirt1 deacetylase activity.
