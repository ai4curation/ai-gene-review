Histone acetylation regulates gene expression. Whether this is caused by a 
general increase in nucleosome fluidity due to charge neutralization or by a 
more specific code is still matter of debate. By using a set of 
glucose-repressed Adr1-dependent genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose 
transcription was previously shown to require both Gcn5 and Esa1, we asked how 
changes of histone acetylation patterns at the promoter nucleosomes regulate 
chromatin remodelling and activation. When the signal of glucose reduction 
reaches the cells, H4 acetylation is kept constant while an increase of H3 
acetylation occurs, in an Adr1- and Gcn5-dependent manner. In cells lacking Gcn5 
activity, the H3 acetylation increase does not occur and an unexpected increase 
of histone H4 acetylation is observed. Nevertheless, chromatin remodelling and 
transcription activation are impaired, suggesting that acetylation of H3 and H4 
histones plays different roles.
