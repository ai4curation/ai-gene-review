Production of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells is regulated by direct 
interactions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with effector proteins 
such as Ca2+-calmodulin, by posttranslational modifications such as 
phosphorylation via protein kinase B, and by translocation of the enzyme from 
the plasma membrane caveolae to intracellular compartments. Reversible acylation 
of eNOS is thought to contribute to the intracellular trafficking of the enzyme; 
however, protein factor(s) that govern the translocation of the enzyme are still 
unknown. Here we have used the yeast two-hybrid system and identified a novel 34 
kDa protein, termed NOSIP (eNOS interacting protein), which avidly binds to the 
carboxyl-terminal region of the eNOS oxygenase domain. Coimmunoprecipitation 
studies demonstrated the specific interaction of eNOS and NOSIP in vitro and in 
vivo, and complex formation was inhibited by a synthetic peptide of the 
caveolin-1 scaffolding domain. NO production was significantly reduced in 
eNOS-expressing CHO cells (CHO-eNOS) that transiently overexpressed NOSIP. 
Stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 induced the reversible 
translocation of eNOS from the detergent-insoluble to the detergent-soluble 
fractions of CHO-eNOS, and this translocation was completely prevented by 
transient coexpression of NOSIP in CHO-eNOS. Immunofluorescence studies revealed 
a prominent plasma membrane staining for eNOS in CHO-eNOS that was abolished in 
the presence of NOSIP. Subcellular fractionation studies identified eNOS in the 
caveolin-rich membrane fractions of CHO-eNOS, and coexpression of NOSIP caused a 
shift of eNOS to intracellular compartments. We conclude that NOSIP is a novel 
type of modulator that promotes translocation of eNOS from the plasma membrane 
to intracellular sites, thereby uncoupling eNOS from plasma membrane caveolae 
and inhibiting NO synthesis.
