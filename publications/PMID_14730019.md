The exon junction complex (EJC) is a protein complex that assembles near 
exon-exon junctions of mRNAs as a result of splicing. EJC proteins play 
important roles in postsplicing events including mRNA export, cytoplasmic 
localization, and nonsense-mediated decay. Recent evidence suggests that mRNA 
translation is also influenced by the splicing history of the transcript. Here 
we identify eIF4A3, a DEAD-box RNA helicase and a member of the eIF4A family of 
translation initiation factors, as a novel component of the EJC. We show that 
eIF4A3 associates preferentially with nuclear complexes containing the EJC 
proteins magoh and Y14. Furthermore, eIF4A3, but not the highly related eIF4A1 
or eIF4A2, preferentially associates with spliced mRNA. In vitro splicing and 
mapping experiments demonstrate that eIF4A3 binds mRNAs at the position of the 
EJC. Using monoclonal antibodies, we show that eIF4A3 is found in the nucleus 
whereas eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 are found in the cytoplasm. Thus, eIF4A3 likely 
provides a splicing-dependent influence on the translation of mRNAs.
