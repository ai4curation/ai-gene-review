Cells respond to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) by increasing the transcription of the genes encoding ER-resident 
chaperone proteins. Ire1p is a transmembrane protein kinase that transmits the 
signal from unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER by a mechanism that 
requires oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation of its 
cytoplasmic-nucleoplasmic kinase domain. Activation of Ire1p induces a novel 
spliced form of HAC1 mRNA that produces Hac1p, a transcription factor that is 
required for activation of the transcription of genes under the control of the 
unfolded-protein response (UPR) element. Searching for proteins that interact 
with Ire1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated PTC2, which encodes a 
serine/threonine phosphatase of type 2C. The Ptc2p interaction with Ire1p is 
specific, direct, dependent on Ire1p phosphorylation, and mediated through a 
kinase interaction domain within Ptc2p. Ptc2p dephosphorylates Ire1p efficiently 
in an Mg2+-dependent manner in vitro. PTC2 is nonessential for growth and 
negatively regulates the UPR pathway. Strains carrying null alleles of PTC2 have 
a three- to fourfold-increased UPR and increased levels of spliced HAC1 mRNA. 
Overexpression of wild-type Ptc2p but not catalytically inactive Ptc2p reduces 
levels of spliced HAC1 mRNA and attenuates the UPR, demonstrating that the 
phosphatase activity of Ptc2p is required for regulation of the UPR. These 
results demonstrate that Ptc2p downregulates the UPR by dephosphorylating Ire1p 
and reveal a novel mechanism of regulation in the UPR pathway upstream of the 
HAC1 mRNA splicing event.
