Wnts are a highly conserved family of lipid-modified glycoproteins that work as 
morphogens to activate several signaling pathways, leading to remodeling of the 
cytoskeleton and the regulation of gene transcription. Wnt signaling regulates 
multiple cellular functions and cell systems, including the development and 
maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. These neurons are of 
considerable interest for regenerative medicine because their degeneration 
results in Parkinson's disease (PD). This review focuses on new advances in 
understanding key functions of Wnts in mDA neuron development and using novel 
tools to regulate Wnt signaling in regenerative medicine for PD. Particularly, 
recent reports indicate that appropriate levels of Wnt signaling are essential 
to improve the quantity and quality of stem cell- or reprogrammed cell-derived 
mDA neurons to be used in drug discovery and cell replacement therapy for PD.
