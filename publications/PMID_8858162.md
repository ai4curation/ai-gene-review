Coatomer is a cytosolic protein complex that forms the coat of COP I-coated 
transport vesicles. In our attempt to analyze the physical and functional 
interactions between its seven subunits (coat proteins, [COPs] alpha-zeta), we 
engaged in a program to clone and characterize the individual coatomer subunits. 
We have now cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed bovine alpha-COP, the 135-kD 
subunit of coatomer as well as delta-COP, the 57-kD subunit and have identified 
a yeast homolog of delta-COP by cDNA sequence comparison and by NH2-terminal 
peptide sequencing. delta-COP shows homologies to subunits of the clathrin 
adaptor complexes AP1 and AP2. We show that in Golgi-enriched membrane 
fractions, the protein is predominantly found in COP I-coated transport vesicles 
and in the budding regions of the Golgi membranes. A knock-out of the delta-COP 
gene in yeast is lethal. Immunoprecipitation, as well as analysis exploiting the 
two-hybrid system in a complete COP screen, showed physical interactions between 
alpha- and epsilon-COPs and between beta- and delta-COPs. Moreover, the 
two-hybrid system indicates interactions between gamma- and zeta-COPs as well as 
between alpha- and beta' COPs. We propose that these interactions reflect in 
vivo associations of those subunits and thus play a functional role in the 
assembly of coatomer and/or serve to maintain the molecular architecture of the 
complex.
