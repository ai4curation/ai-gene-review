Carriers of BRCA1 germline mutations are predisposed to breast and ovarian 
cancers. Accumulated evidence shows that BRCA1 is quickly recruited to DNA 
lesions and plays an important role in the DNA damage response. However, the 
mechanism by which BRCA1 is recruited to DNA damage sites remains elusive. BRCA1 
forms a Ring-domain heterodimer with BARD1, a major partner of BRCA1 that 
contains tandem BRCA1 C-terminus (BRCT) motifs. Here, we identify the BRCTs of 
BARD1 as a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)-binding module. The binding of the BARD1 BRCTs 
to PAR targets the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer to DNA damage sites. Thus, our study 
uncovers a PAR-dependent mechanism of rapid recruitment of BRCA1/BARD1 to DNA 
damage sites.

INTRODUCTION

Cells encounter numerous environmental and internal hazards that induce various kinds of DNA damage. To cope with these threats, cells have developed a DNA damage response system to sense and repair DNA lesions. Loss of this DNA damage response lead to the accumulation of DNA lesions, triggers genomic instability, and ultimately promotes tumorigenesis. Thus, many DNA damage response proteins are important tumor suppressors.

BRCA1 is a breast and ovarian cancer suppressor ( Miki et al., 1994 ). Germline BRCA1 mutation carriers are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancers ( King et al., 2003 ; Rahman and Stratton, 1998 ; Turner et al., 2004 ; Venkitaraman, 2002 ). Accumulated evidence suggests that BRCA1 plays important roles in several biological events during the DNA damage response including cell cycle checkpoint activation and repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) ( Huen et al., 2010 ; Roy et al., 2011 ; Scully et al., 1997 ; Scully and Livingston, 2000 ). As a result, tumor cells bearing BRCA1 mutations are hypersensitive to DSBs-inducing agents, such as ionizing radiation (IR) ( Abbott et al., 1999 ; Shen et al., 1998 ). In addition to DSB repair, cells have other pathways to repair different types of DNA lesions, such as DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs). It has been shown that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) play important roles in SSB repair ( Burkle, 2001 ; Fisher et al., 2007 ; Okano et al., 2003 ). Interestingly, suppression of PARPs by inhibitors can specifically kill breast cancer cells bearing BRCA1 mutations. It has been hypothesized that cells lacking both PARP-dependent SSB repair and BRCA1-dependent DSB repair are inviable ( Farmer et al., 2005 ; Fong et al., 2009 ; Rouleau et al., 2010 ). Following DNA damage, PARP1, one of the major PARPs in the DNA damage response, quickly relocates to DNA damage sites and catalyzes protein PARylation ( Kim et al., 2005 ). Although the function of this PARylation is not clear, some evidence suggests that it can function as a docking signal to recruit other DNA damage response factors to DNA lesions ( Masson et al., 1998 ; Okano et al., 2003 ; Ruscetti et al., 1998 ). Interestingly, recent structural analyses indicate that PARP1 also recognizes DSBs ( Ali et al., 2012 ), although the function of PARP1 in DSB repair is unknown.

Like PARP1, BRCA1 is also quickly recruited to DNA damage sites ( Scully et al., 1997 ). The molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 is recruited to DNA damage sites remains elusive. Two important DNA damage response factors, γH2AX and MDC1, have been shown to facilitate the recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage sites ( Harper and Elledge, 2007 ). However, BRCA1 can still be transiently recruited to DNA damage sites in the absence of γH2AX, although it cannot be stably retained at DNA damage sites ( Celeste et al., 2003 ), suggesting that H2AX provides the platform to stabilize BRCA1 at DNA damage sites instead of directly recruiting it. Recently, it has been shown that a DNA damage-induced protein ubiquitination pathway governs the relocation of BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage via the RAP80 complex) ( Kim et al., 2007 ; Sobhian et al., 2007 ; Wang et al., 2007 ). However, deletion of RAP80 does not completely abolish the IR-induced foci formation of BRCA1( Hu et al., 2011 ), suggesting that alternative mechanism of recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage sites exists. Since the DNA damage-induced protein ubiquitination pathway is γH2AX-dependent ( Huen et al., 2007 ; Kolas et al., 2007 ; Mailand et al., 2007 ), it is likely that protein ubiquitination at DNA damage sites, like γH2AX, only stabilizes BRCA1 foci instead of acting in the initial recruitment of BRCA1. Thus, in this study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 is recruited to the sites of DNA damage.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we identified the BARD1 BRCTs as a PAR-binding motif. DNA damage induces massive PAR synthesis in a very short period of time at DNA lesions ( D'Amours et al., 1999 ; Kim et al., 2005 ). Previous results suggest that protein PARylation is involved in SSB repair. However, recent structural analysis of PARP1, one of the major PAR polymerases in the DNA damage response, shows that it can recognize DSBs ( Ali et al., 2012 ; Langelier et al., 2012 ). Our results show that DSBs also induce protein PARylation. Protein PARylation functions as a signal to recruit DNA damage repair proteins like the BRCA1/BARD1 complex to repair DSBs. Suppression of protein PARylation in turn impairs BRCA1/BARD1 recruitment. Our findings also explain the molecular mechanism by which BRCA1/BARD1 is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites even in the H2AX-deficient cells. Following DSB formation, the BARD1 BRCTs first recognize PAR at DNA lesions, which mediates the rapid recruitment of BRCA1. The retention of BRCA1 is mediated by the BRCA1 BRCTs and is H2AX dependent ( Figure S3F ). Since SSBs also induce PAR synthesis, it is likely that the BRCA1/BARD1 complex is recruited to SSBs. However, without DNA damage-induced H2AX phosphorylation, the BRCA1/BARD1 complex would be quickly released from DNA damage sites following rapid PAR degradation. Thus, H2AX phosphorylation is still a key factor in facilitating BRCA1 function in DNA damage response.

In our study, the BARD1 BRCTs bind ADP-ribose, the basic unit of PAR, but not phospho-proteins. Although previous peptide library screening showed that the BARD1 BRCT domain preferentially recognizes the pSDDE motif ( Rodriguez et al., 2003 ), the protein binding partner of the BARD1 BRCTs has not yet been identified. Of note, there are two phosphate groups in one ADP-ribose. The phosphate group of Ser and negative charged residues following the pSer in the pSDDE motif might mimic the negatively charged phosphate groups in ADP-ribose, potentially explaining why pSDDE was identified in library screening. Future structural analysis of the BARD1 BRCTs/ADP-ribose complex should reveal the molecular details of the interaction.

Since the BARD1 BRCTs bind ADP-ribose, free ADP-ribose competed with the BARD1-PAR interaction in vitro . Such competition could not occur in vivo because high level of free ADP-ribose in vivo is toxic to cells ( Dunn et al., 1999 ; Hassa et al., 2006 ). The intracellular concentration of ADP-ribose in mammals is maintained below 100 µM ( Gasser and Guse, 2005 ) and is tightly controlled by specific ADP-ribose hydrolases/pyrophosphatases, which act as protective factors that limit free ADP-ribose accumulation and protein glycation ( D'Amours et al., 1999 ; Fernandez et al., 1996 ; Hassa et al., 2006 ; Miro et al., 1989 ; Ribeiro et al., 1995 ; Ribeiro et al., 2001 ). The concentration of NAD + in undamaged mammalian cells is around 400–500 µM, with 65–75 % of NAD + utilized to synthesize PAR in response to DNA damage ( D'Amours et al., 1999 ; Hassa et al., 2006 ). Thus, free ADP-ribose cannot reach a sufficient concentration to compete away PAR in vivo .

The recruitment of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex to DNA damage sites by PAR is important for cells during the DNA damage response. This process ensures that cells which lose certain phosphorylation-dependent pathways could still repair DNA lesions. It might increase cell viability when cells bear germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 . In particular, the most frequent cancer-associated BRCA1 mutations are hypomorphic mutations that lose the C-terminal BRCT domain, which is required to bind to functional partners with pSer motifs. Cells with mutations that abolish the interaction between the BRCA1 BRCTs and pSer motifs could be hypersensitive to PARP inhibitor treatment in part because, in the absence of PAR synthesis, the BRCA1/BARD1 complex could neither quickly relocate to nor slowly accumulate at DNA damage sites. This “double hit” might induce tumor cell lethality. This model also provides an explanation for a recent observation that disrupting the interaction between the BRCA1 BRCTs and phosphoproteins enhances the cytotoxic effect of PARP inhibitors in cancer cells ( Langelier et al., 2012 ).

Notably, PARP inhibitors also kill BRCA1 -null cells for which the double-hit model described above is irrelevant ( Drost et al., 2011 ). It has been shown that impairment of base excision repair by PARP inhibitors aggravates the DNA damage repair deficiency in BRCA1-deficient cells and promotes synthetic lethality ( Kummar et al., 2012 ; Rios and Puhalla, 2011 ). Moreover, PARP inhibitors can trap PARP1 at DNA damage sites ( Murai et al., 2012 ), blocking normal DNA repair. Together with our data, these observations indicate that there are multiple mechanisms by which PARP inhibition can kill breast cancer cells.
