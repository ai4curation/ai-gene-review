Gene duplication results in two identical paralogs that diverge through 
mutation, leading to loss or gain of interactions with other biomolecules. Here, 
we comprehensively characterize such network rewiring for C. elegans 
transcription factors (TFs) within and across four newly delineated molecular 
networks. Remarkably, we find that even highly similar TFs often have different 
interaction degrees and partners. In addition, we find that most TF families 
have a member that is highly connected in multiple networks. Further, different 
TF families have opposing correlations between network connectivity and 
phylogenetic age, suggesting that they are subject to different evolutionary 
pressures. Finally, TFs that have similar partners in one network generally do 
not in another, indicating a lack of pressure to retain cross-network 
similarity. Our multiparameter analyses provide unique insights into the 
evolutionary dynamics that shaped TF networks.
