Tid1 is a human homolog of bacterial DnaJ and the Drosophila tumor suppressor 
Tid56 that has two alternatively spliced isoforms, Tid1-long and -short (Tid1-L 
and -S), which differ only at their carboxyl termini. Although Tid1 proteins 
localize overwhelmingly to mitochondria, published data demonstrate principally 
nonmitochondrial protein interactions and activities. This study was undertaken 
to determine whether Tid1 proteins function as mitochondrial DnaJ-like 
chaperones and to resolve the paradox of how proteins targeted primarily to 
mitochondria function in nonmitochondrial pathways. Here we demonstrate that 
Tid1 isoforms exhibit a conserved mitochondrial DnaJ-like function substituting 
for the yeast mitochondrial DnaJ-like protein Mdj1p. Like Mdj1p, Tid1 localizes 
to human mitochondrial nucleoids, which are large protein complexes bound to 
mitochondrial DNA. Unlike other DnaJs, Tid1-L and -S form heterocomplexes; both 
unassembled and complexed Tid1 are observed in human cells. Results demonstrate 
that Tid1-L has a longer residency time in the cytosol prior to mitochondrial 
import as compared with Tid1-S; Tid1-L is also significantly more stable in the 
cytosol than Tid1-S, which is rapidly degraded. The longer cytosolic residency 
time and the half-life of Tid1-L are explained by its interaction with cytosolic 
Hsc70 and potential protein substrates such as the STAT1 and STAT3 transcription 
factors. We show that the unique carboxyl terminus of Tid1-L is required for 
interaction with Hsc70 and STAT1 and -3. We propose that the association of Tid1 
with chaperones and/or protein substrates in the cytosol provides a mechanism 
for the alternate fates and functions of Tid1 in mitochondrial and 
nonmitochondrial pathways.
