Hsp70s comprise a deeply conserved chaperone family that has a central role in 
maintaining protein homeostasis. In humans, Hsp70 client specificity is provided 
by 49 different co-factors known as J domain proteins (JDPs). However, the 
cellular function and client specificity of JDPs have largely remained elusive. 
We have combined affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and 
proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to characterize the interactome of all 
human JDPs and Hsp70s. The resulting network suggests specific functions for 
many uncharacterized JDPs, and we establish a role of conserved JDPs DNAJC9 and 
DNAJC27 in histone chaperoning and ciliogenesis, respectively. Unexpectedly, we 
find that the J domain of DNAJC27 but not of other JDPs can fully replace the 
function of endogenous DNAJC27, suggesting a previously unappreciated role for J 
domains themselves in JDP specificity. More broadly, our work expands the role 
of the Hsp70-regulated proteostasis network and provides a platform for further 
discovery of JDP-dependent functions.
