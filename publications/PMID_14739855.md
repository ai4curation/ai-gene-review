BACKGROUND: Severe burn induces the hepatic acute phase response. In this study, 
we wondered whether continuous insulin treatment decreases acute phase protein 
levels in the severely burned.
METHODS: Eighteen children aged 2 to 17 years with burns >40% of total body 
surface area were randomized to receive either insulin (n=9) or no treatment 
(n=9) within 72 hours after injury until the wounds were 95% healed. Insulin was 
given at a continuous rate of > or =1.5 microU/kg/min to maintain euglycemia 
(serum glucose 100-140 microg/dL). Plasma was examined at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 
for acute phase protein levels including C-reactive protein, C3 complement, 
alpha1-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, alpha2-macroglobulin, prealbumin, 
transferrin, and retinol-binding protein. Statistical analysis was by ANOVA and 
t test.
RESULTS: With insulin treatment, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, C3 complement, 
alpha2-macroglobulin, and haptoglobin levels decreased (P<.05) after a severe 
burn compared with control, especially at days 21 and 28. Additionally, the 
hepatic constitutive proteins (prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding 
protein) were lower in the insulin-treatment group than those of the control 
group at day 21 (P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous insulin treatment decreases acute phase protein levels 
after a severe burn. The results suggest insulin downregulation of the hepatic 
acute phase response to injury.
