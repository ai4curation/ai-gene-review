Intestinal epithelial cells contribute to regulation of intestinal immunity in 
mammals, but the detailed molecular mechanisms of such regulation have remained 
largely unknown. Stomach-cancer-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 
(SAP-1, also known as PTPRH) is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase 
that is localized specifically at microvilli of the brush border in 
gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Here we show that SAP-1 ablation in 
interleukin (IL)-10-deficient mice, a model of inflammatory bowel disease, 
resulted in a marked increase in the severity of colitis in association with 
up-regulation of mRNAs for various cytokines and chemokines in the colon. 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion 
molecule (CEACAM) 20, an intestinal microvillus-specific transmembrane protein 
of the Ig superfamily, was greatly increased in the intestinal epithelium of the 
SAP-1-deficient animals, suggesting that this protein is a substrate for SAP-1. 
Tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 by the protein tyrosine kinase c-Src and 
the consequent association of CEACAM20 with spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) 
promoted the production of IL-8 in cultured cells through the activation of 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In addition, SAP-1 and CEACAM20 were found to form a 
complex through interaction of their ectodomains. SAP-1 and CEACAM20 thus 
constitute a regulatory system through which the intestinal epithelium 
contributes to intestinal immunity.

Abstract

Intestinal epithelial cells contribute to regulation of intestinal immunity in mammals, but the detailed molecular mechanisms of such regulation have remained largely unknown. Stomach-cancer–associated protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SAP-1, also known as PTPRH) is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase that is localized specifically at microvilli of the brush border in gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Here we show that SAP-1 ablation in interleukin (IL)-10–deficient mice, a model of inflammatory bowel disease, resulted in a marked increase in the severity of colitis in association with up-regulation of mRNAs for various cytokines and chemokines in the colon. Tyrosine phosphorylation of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) 20, an intestinal microvillus-specific transmembrane protein of the Ig superfamily, was greatly increased in the intestinal epithelium of the SAP-1–deficient animals, suggesting that this protein is a substrate for SAP-1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 by the protein tyrosine kinase c-Src and the consequent association of CEACAM20 with spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) promoted the production of IL-8 in cultured cells through the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In addition, SAP-1 and CEACAM20 were found to form a complex through interaction of their ectodomains. SAP-1 and CEACAM20 thus constitute a regulatory system through which the intestinal epithelium contributes to intestinal immunity.

Discussion

We have here shown that ablation of SAP-1, a microvillus-specific PTP, exacerbated spontaneous colitis in association with up-regulation of mRNAs for various cytokines and chemokines in the colon of Il10 −/− mice, whereas Sap1 −/− mice did not manifest any sign of colonic inflammation. IL-10 is thought to suppress the functions of various immune cells in the intestine, thereby protecting against colitis ( 34 ). Ablation of IL-10 in mice thus results in colonic inflammation that resembles IBD in humans ( 21 , 22 ). Depletion of commensal bacteria with antibiotics also attenuates the severity of colitis in Il10 −/− mice ( 21 , 24 ), suggesting the importance of such bacteria in this colitis model. We found that antibiotic treatment also prevented the exacerbation of colitis induced by SAP-1 ablation in Il10 −/− mice. Our results thus suggest that SAP-1, in cooperation with IL-10, contributes to protection against the development of colitis.

We also investigated the molecular mechanism by which SAP-1 regulates intestinal immunity and by which ablation of SAP-1 exacerbates colitis in Il10 −/− mice. We found that the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20, which is specifically expressed in IECs, was markedly increased in Sap1 −/− mice. We also showed that tyrosine-phosphorylated CEACAM20 was efficiently dephosphorylated by SAP-1 in vitro as well as in cultured cells. Moreover, the expression pattern and localization of CEACAM20 overlapped with those of SAP-1, with both proteins being localized at microvilli of the intestine. Furthermore, SAP-1 and CEACAM20 were found to form a complex through interaction of their ectodomains in cultured cells, suggesting that both proteins physically associate with each other. Collectively, these observations suggest that CEACAM20 is a physiological substrate for SAP-1 in the intestinal epithelium.

Given that we found that SAP-1 regulates intestinal immunity through dephosphorylation of CEACAM20, we also investigated the function as well as signaling downstream of CEACAM20. We found that c-Src promotes the phosphorylation of Tyr 559 or Tyr 570 in the COOH-terminal region of CEACAM20 and that Syk then binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated CEACAM20 through its SH2 domains. Such binding to CEACAM20 likely results in the activation of Syk and promotes further tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20. Finally, we showed that formation of the CEACAM20–Syk complex promoted the production of IL-8, likely as a result of the activation of NF-κB, in cultured cells. In contrast, forced expression of SAP-1 markedly attenuated the increase in IL-8 production induced by expression of CEACAM20 and c-Src, suggesting that SAP-1 counteracts the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM20 on IL-8 production. We have also found that forced expression of CEACAM20 together with c-Src and Syk induces the production of IL-6 in HEK293A cells ( Fig. S9 ). CEACAM20 thus likely promotes inflammatory conditions in the intestine through its formation of a complex with Syk and the consequent production of chemokines and cytokines in IECs.

Neutrophil infiltration into the intestinal mucosa is fundamental to the development and progression of IBD ( 35 ). The chemokine IL-8 is thought to play a major role in the neutrophil infiltration that is frequently associated with colitis lesions in individuals with IBD ( 35 ). Mice deficient in chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2), a receptor for the IL-8 homologs MIP-2 and KC, manifest a reduced susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, another animal model of IBD ( 36 ). Conversely, transgenic mice that overexpress MIP-2 specifically in the intestinal epithelium manifest exaggeration of such colitis ( 14 ). The levels of mRNAs for MIP-2 and KC tended to increase in the intestinal epithelium of Il10 −/− Sap1 −/− mice before the development of colitis. The tyrosine-phosphorylation of CEACAM20 thus likely contributes at least in part to the development of colitis in Il10 −/− Sap1 −/− mice.

We found that the ectodomain of SAP-1 interacts with that of CEACAM20. Given that both proteins are localized at microvilli of IECs, they—and in particular CEACAM20—might also interact with commensal bacteria in the intestine. Indeed, the Ig-like ectodomain of another CEACAM family member, CEACAM3, which also contains an ITAM-like motif in its cytoplasmic domain, recognizes bacteria that express the Opa protein and thereby triggers phagocytosis and elimination of the bacteria by granulocytes ( 37 ). In addition, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6, which are expressed in human IECs, have been shown to function as a receptor for Escherichia coli isolated from the intestine of healthy individuals or IBD patients ( 38 , 39 ). Similarly, commensal or pathogenic bacteria might contribute to the regulation of CEACAM20 function by interacting with the ectodomain of this protein at the microvilli of IECs.

In summary, we propose a model for regulation of intestinal immunity by SAP-1 and CEACAM20 ( Fig. 7 ). Further study will be required to elucidate whether mutations of the genes for SAP-1 or CEACAM20 are associated with IBD in humans. Nevertheless, these molecules are potential drug targets for the treatment of IBD.
