HES-1 is a mammalian helix-loop-helix factor structurally related to the 
Drosophila hairy and Enhancer of split proteins. It binds more preferentially to 
the N box (CACNAG) than to the E box (CANNTG) and acts as a negative regulator. 
In this study, we have isolated and characterized the mouse HES-1 gene. This 
gene consists of four exons, and the positions of introns are well conserved 
when compared with those of the Drosophila hairy gene, except for the third 
intron. Southern blot and interspecies backcross analyses suggest that the mouse 
HES-1 gene is a single-copy gene and is located around position 26 on chromosome 
16. The transcription initiation site, determined by the S1 nuclease and primer 
extension experiments, is located 31 nucleotides downstream of a TATA box. In 
the 5'-regulatory region, there are four N box sequences, and the DNase I 
foot-printing and gel mobility shift analyses show that HES-1 binds to these 
sequences. Transient transfection assays using C3H10T1/2 cells suggest that 
there are several positive regulatory regions in the HES-1 gene. However, 
cotransfection of the HES-1 expression vector leads to approximately 40-fold 
repression in promoter activity. Furthermore, when the N box sequences are 
disrupted, this negative regulation is severely impaired. These results raise 
the possibility that HES-1 gene expression may be negatively autoregulated 
through the N box sequences.
