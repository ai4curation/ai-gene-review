Heatshock protein 60 (hsp60) in the matrix of mitochondria is essential for the 
folding and assembly of newly imported proteins. Hsp60 belongs to a class of 
structurally related chaperonins found in organelles of endosymbiotic origin and 
in the bacterial cytosol. Hsp60 monomers form a complex arranged as two stacked 
7-mer rings. This 14-mer complex binds unfolded proteins at its surface, then 
seems to catalyse their folding in an ATP-dependent process. The question arises 
as to how such an assembly machinery is itself folded and assembled. Hsp60 
subunits are encoded by a nuclear gene and translated in the cytosol as 
precursors which are translocated into mitochondria and proteolytically 
processed. In both intact cells and isolated mitochondria of the hsp60-defective 
yeast mutant mif4, self-assembly of newly imported wild-type subunits is not 
observed. Functional pre-existing hsp60 complex is required in order to form 
new, assembled, 14-mer. Subunits imported in vitro are assembled with a 
surprisingly fast half-time of 5-10 min, indicative of a catalysed reaction. 
These findings are further evidence that self-assembly may not be the principal 
mechanism by which proteins attain their functional conformation in the intact 
cell.
