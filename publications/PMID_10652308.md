Activation of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), approximately 20-kDa GTPases that 
are inactive in the GDP-bound form, depends on guanine nucleotide-exchange 
proteins (GEPs) to accelerate GTP binding. A novel ARF GEP, designated 
cytohesin-4, was cloned from a human brain cDNA library. Deduced amino acid 
sequence of the 47-kDa protein contains the same structural components present 
in cytohesin -1, -2, and -3, including an approximately 200-amino acid Sec7 
domain with an approximately 100-residue pleckstrin homology domain near the C 
terminus. The Sec7 domain sequence is 77% identical to those of other 
cytohesins. Structures of the cytohesin-4 and cytohesin-1 genes were remarkably 
similar, except for an extra 3-base pair (GAG) exon present in cytohesin-1. Two 
mRNAs with and without the 3-base pair sequence were found in brain in different 
ratios for cytohesin-1, -2, and -3 but not cytohesin-4. Recombinant cytohesin-4 
stimulated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding by human ARF1 and ARF5 
but not ARF6. Like other cytohesins and unlike the approximately 200-kDa ARF 
GEPs, it was not inhibited by brefeldin A. A cytohesin-4 mRNA of approximately 
3.7 kilobases, abundant in leukocytes, was not detected in most tissues. Among 
separated populations of blood cells, approximately 90% of CD33(+) (monocytes), 
80% of CD2(+) (NK/T), and 10-20% of CD19(+) (B) cells contained cytohesin-4 mRNA 
by in situ hybridization. Thus, in gene structure and brefeldin A-insensitive 
GEP activity, cytohesin-4 resembles other cytohesins, but its tissue 
distribution differs considerably, consistent with a different specific 
function.
