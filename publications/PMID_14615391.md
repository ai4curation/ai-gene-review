OBJECTIVE: In cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells, insulin increases 
cyclic GMP production by inducing nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. The aim of the 
present study was to determine whether in these cells the insulin-stimulated 
NO/cyclic GMP pathway plays a role in the regulation of glucose uptake.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Glucose transport in human vascular smooth muscle cells was 
measured as uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose, cyclic GMP synthesis was checked by 
radioimmunoassay, and GLUT4 recruitment into the plasma membrane was determined 
by immunofluorescence. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 
recruitment were blocked by an inhibitor of NO synthesis and mimicked by 
NO-releasing drugs. Insulin- and NO-elicited glucose uptake were blocked by 
inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase; 
furthermore, glucose transport was stimulated by an analog of cyclic GMP.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that insulin-elicited glucose transport (and 
the corresponding GLUT4 recruitment into the plasma membrane) in human vascular 
smooth muscle cells is mediated by an increased synthesis of NO, which 
stimulates the production of cyclic GMP and the subsequent activation of a 
cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase.
