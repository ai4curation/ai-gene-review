Mislocalization and aggregation of Aβ and Tau combined with loss of synapses and 
microtubules (MTs) are hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. We exposed mature primary 
neurons to Aβ oligomers and analysed changes in the Tau/MT system. MT breakdown 
occurs in dendrites invaded by Tau (Tau missorting) and is mediated by spastin, 
an MT-severing enzyme. Spastin is recruited by MT polyglutamylation, induced by 
Tau missorting triggered translocalization of TTLL6 
(Tubulin-Tyrosine-Ligase-Like-6) into dendrites. Consequences are spine loss and 
mitochondria and neurofilament mislocalization. Missorted Tau is not axonally 
derived, as shown by axonal retention of photoconvertible Dendra2-Tau, but newly 
synthesized. Recovery from Aβ insult occurs after Aβ oligomers lose their 
toxicity and requires the kinase MARK (Microtubule-Affinity-Regulating-Kinase). 
In neurons derived from Tau-knockout mice, MTs and synapses are resistant to Aβ 
toxicity because TTLL6 mislocalization and MT polyglutamylation are prevented; 
hence no spastin recruitment and no MT breakdown occur, enabling faster 
recovery. Reintroduction of Tau re-establishes Aβ-induced toxicity in TauKO 
neurons, which requires phosphorylation of Tau's KXGS motifs. Transgenic mice 
overexpressing Tau show TTLL6 translocalization into dendrites and decreased MT 
stability. The results provide a rationale for MT stabilization as a therapeutic 
approach.
