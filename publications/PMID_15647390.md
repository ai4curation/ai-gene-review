The carboxy terminus (CT) of the colonic H(+)-K(+)-ATPase is required for stable 
assembly with the beta-subunit, translocation to the plasma membrane, and 
efficient function of the transporter. To identify protein-protein interactions 
involved in the localization and function of HKalpha(2), we selected 84 amino 
acids in the CT of the alpha-subunit of mouse colonic H(+)-K(+)-ATPase 
(CT-HKalpha(2)) as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse kidney cDNA 
library. The longest identified clone was CD63. To characterize the interaction 
of CT-HKalpha(2) with CD63, recombinant CT-HKalpha(2) and CD63 were synthesized 
in vitro and incubated, and complexes were immunoprecipitated. CT-HKalpha(2) 
protein (but not CT-HKalpha(1)) coprecipitated with CD63, confirming stable 
assembly of HKalpha(2) with CD63. In HEK-293 transfected with HKalpha(2) plus 
beta(1)-Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, suppression of CD63 by RNA interference increased 
cell surface expression of HKalpha(2)/NKbeta(1) and (86)Rb(+) uptake. These 
studies demonstrate that CD63 participates in the regulation of the abundance of 
the HKalpha(2)-NKbeta(1) complex in the cell membrane.
