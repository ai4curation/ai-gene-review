Both human and animal studies suggest that hyperthermia contributes to the 
lethal effects of methamphetamine. To elucidate the roles of dopamine D1 and D2 
receptors in methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia and lethal effects, we used D1 
knockout (D1KO) mice, D2 knockout (D2KO) mice, and wild-type littermates. After 
the administration (i.p.) of a single dose of 30 mg/kg methamphetamine, no 
hyperthermic effect on body temperature was observed in D2KO mice, though there 
was a slight elevation in D1KO mice and a marked elevation in wild-type mice. 
Approximately 27% of the wild-type mice died after the administration, compared 
to only 7% of D1KO mice and 4% of D2KO mice. In conclusion, both D1 and D2 
receptors play roles in the lethal toxic effects of methamphetamine, and mainly 
the D2 receptor is involved in the elevation of body temperature.
