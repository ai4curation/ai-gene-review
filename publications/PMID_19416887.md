IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) is one of the first identified proteins induced

Sendai virus-triggered activation of IRF3, NF-kappaB, and the IFN-beta promoter, 
whereas knockdown of ISG56 had opposite effects. Consistently, overexpression of 
ISG56 reversed cytoplasmic poly(I:C)-induced inhibition of vesicular stomatitis

Abstract

IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) is one of the first identified proteins induced by viruses and type I IFNs. In this study, we identified ISG56 as a virus-induced protein associated with MITA, an adapter protein involved in virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs. Overexpression of ISG56 inhibited Sendai virus-triggered activation of IRF3, NF-κB, and the IFN-β promoter, whereas knockdown of ISG56 had opposite effects. Consistently, overexpression of ISG56 reversed cytoplasmic poly(I:C)-induced inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication, whereas knockdown of ISG56 inhibited VSV replication. Competitive coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that ISG56 disrupted the interactions between MITA and VISA or TBK1, two components in the virus-triggered IFN signaling pathways. These results suggest that ISG56 is a mediator of negative-feedback regulation of virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs and cellular antiviral responses.

Discussion

ISG56 and ISG54 are two of the first identified proteins that are induced by type I IFNs, dsRNAs, and viruses ( 19 , 22 ). In this study, we identified ISG56 and ISG54 as two proteins associated with MITA, a critical adapter protein involved in virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs ( 14 , 15 ). Overexpression of ISG56 inhibited SeV-triggered activation of IRF3, NF-κB, and the IFN-β promoter, whereas knockdown of ISG56 had an opposite effect. Consistently, overexpression of ISG56 reversed cytoplasmic poly(I:C)-induced inhibition of VSV replication, whereas knockdown of ISG56 inhibited VSV replication. These results suggest that ISG56 negatively regulates virus-triggered IFN-β induction and cellular antiviral responses. Previously, it has been established that ISG56 is induced by viral infection and type I IFNs ( 21 ). Taken together, these studies suggest that ISG56 is a mediator of negative-feedback regulation of cellular antiviral responses.

Interestingly, although ISG54 is homologous to ISG56 and also disrupted MITA–VISA and MITA–TBK1 interactions in mammalian overexpression systems, either overexpression or knockdown of ISG54 had only minor effects on SeV-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter as well as cellular antiviral responses. Previously, it has been demonstrated that ISG56 mRNA expression was much stronger and longer than ISG54 in response to viruses such as influenza virus and herpes simplex virus type 1 ( 29 , 30 ). It has also been noted that ISG56 mRNA is the most abundant IFN-induced mRNAs in a gene array analysis ( 16 ). These observations suggest that ISG56 is a major mediator of virus-triggered negative-feedback regulation of type I IFNs and cellular antiviral responses, whereas ISG54 plays much lesser role in these processes.

In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, ISG56 interacted with MITA but not TBK1 or IRF3. Competitive coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that ISG56 disrupted the MITA–VISA and MITA–TBK1 interactions in a dose-dependent manner. In similar experiments, ISG56 did not disrupt the MDA5–VISA and TRIF–TBK1 interactions. Based on these results, we propose that ISG56 negatively regulates virus-triggered signaling and cellular antiviral responses through specific disruption of the VISA–MITA–TBK1 complex by steric hindrance.

To prevent harmful effects resulting from spontaneous production in uninfected cells or overproduction of type I IFNs during an acute infection, host cells have developed distinct strategies to control excessive antiviral innate immune responses. At least two distinct mechanisms have been identified. One of the mechanisms involves the ubiquitin–proteosome system. Several members of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family, such as A20, RNF125, Pin1, RBCK1, RNF5, and Ro52, target the key components of the virus-induced type I IFN signaling pathways for degradation ( 26 – 28 , 31 , 32 ). Second, some inhibitory proteins, such as DAK, SIKE, and NLRX1, are constitutively expressed and physically associated with key components of virus-induced type I IFN signaling pathways to sequester them in inactive forms ( 26 , 27 , 33 ). Viral infection leads to release of these inhibitors, resulting in activation of the signaling components. In this study, we identified a distinct mechanism on regulation of virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs and cellular antiviral response: ISG56 is strongly induced by viral infection and then down-regulates virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs and cellular antiviral responses by disrupting the VISA–MITA–TBK1 complex.

Previous reports suggest that ISG56 acts as a suppressor of viral replication and protein translation. In light of these and our current findings, it is possible that ISG56 has multiple functions and is an important integrator of inhibition of viral replication and control of excessive antiviral responses. It is also possible that the functions of ISG56 are temporally regulated during viral infection. Although more studies are needed to understand the delicate regulatory mechanisms of ISG56 in viral replication and antiviral responses, our findings reveal a previously undescribed role for ISG56 in regulating cellular antiviral responses.
