RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) play important roles in RNA biology. However, the 
function and regulation of mRNA G-quadruplexes in embryonic development remain 
elusive. Previously, we identified RHAU (DHX36, G4R1) as an RNA helicase that 
resolves mRNA G-quadruplexes. Here, we find that cardiac deletion of Rhau leads 
to heart defects and embryonic lethality in mice. Gene expression profiling 
identified Nkx2-5 mRNA as a target of RHAU that associates with its 5' and 3' 
UTRs and modulates its stability and translation. The 5' UTR of Nkx2-5 mRNA 
contains a G-quadruplex that requires RHAU for protein translation, while the 3' 
UTR of Nkx2-5 mRNA possesses an AU-rich element (ARE) that facilitates 
RHAU-mediated mRNA decay. Thus, we uncovered the mechanisms underlying Nkx2-5 
post-transcriptional regulation during heart development. Meanwhile, this study 
demonstrates the function of mRNA 5' UTR G-quadruplex-mediated protein 
translation in organogenesis.
