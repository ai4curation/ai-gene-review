L-carnitine is required for the transfer of activated acyl-groups across 
intracellular membranes in eukaryotic organisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
peroxisomal membranes are impermeable to acetyl-CoA, which is produced in the 
peroxisome when cells are grown on fatty acids as carbon source. In a reversible 
reaction catalysed by carnitine acetyltransferases (CATs), activated acetyl 
groups are transferred to carnitine to form acetylcarnitine which can be 
shuttled across membranes. Here we describe a mutant selection strategy that 
specifically selects for mutants affected in carnitine-dependent metabolic 
activities. Complementation of three of these mutants resulted in the cloning of 
three CAT encoding genes: CAT2, coding for the carnitine acetyltransferase 
associated with the peroxisomes and the mitochondria; YAT1, coding for the 
carnitine acetyltransferase, which is presumably associated with the outer 
mitochondrial membrane, and YER024w (YAT2), which encodes a third, previously 
unidentified carnitine acetyltransferase. The data also show that (a) 
L-carnitine and all three CATs are essential for growth on non-fermentable 
carbon sources in a strain with a disrupted CIT2 gene; (b) Yat2p contributes 
significantly to total CAT activity when cells are grown on ethanol; and that 
(c) the carnitine-dependent transfer of activated acetyl groups plays a more 
important role in cellular processes than previously realised.
