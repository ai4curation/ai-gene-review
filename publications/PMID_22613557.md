Tumor differentiation factor (TDF) is a pituitary protein that is secreted into 
the bloodstream and has an endocrine function. TDF and TDF-P1, a 20-residue 
peptide selected from the ORF of TDF, induce differentiation in human breast and 
prostate cancer cells, but not in other cells. TDF has no known mechanism of 
action. In our recent study, we identified heat shock 70 kDa proteins (HSP70s) 
as TDF receptors (TDF-Rs) in breast cancer cells. Therefore, we sought to 
investigate whether TDF-R candidates from prostate cancer cells are the same as 
those identified in breast cancer cells. Here, we used TDF-P1 to purify the 
potential TDF-R candidates by affinity purification chromatography from DU145 
and PC3 steroid-resistant prostate cancer cells, LNCaP steroid-responsive 
prostate cancer cells, and nonprostate NG108 neuroblastoma and BLK CL.4 
fibroblast-like cells. We identified the purified proteins by MS, and validated 
them by western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoaffinity 
purification chromatography, and structural biology. We identified seven 
candidate proteins, of which three were from the HSP70 family. These three 
proteins were validated as potential TDF-R candidates in LNCaP 
steroid-responsive and in DU145 and PC3 steroid-resistant prostate cancer cells, 
but not in NG108 neuroblastoma and BLK CL.4 fibroblast-like cells. Our previous 
study and the current study suggest that GRP78, and perhaps HSP70s, are strong 
TDF-R candidates, and further suggest that TDF interacts with its receptors 
exclusively in breast and prostate cells, inducing cell differentiation through 
a novel, steroid-independent pathway.
