The Bcl-2-family of proteins localize to intracellular membranes via a 
C-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchor (MA) domain, to exert their antiapoptotic 
or proapoptotic functions. In Drosophila, both Bcl-2 family members, DEBCL and 
BUFFY, contain an MA. In DEBCL the MA is necessary for the localization of 
protein to mitochondria and for its proapoptotic activity. BUFFY is highly 
similar to DEBCL but its localization and function are not clearly defined. 
Here, we report on comparative analysis of BUFFY and DEBCL to decipher the 
molecular basis for their subcellular localization. We show that these two 
proteins localize to distinct intracellular membranes, DEBCL predominantly to 
mitochondria and BUFFY to endoplasmic reticula (ER). Our results suggest that 
the MA-flanking residues in DEBCL, homologous to Bcl-X(L), are required for the 
targeting of DEBCL to mitochondria. The C-terminal positively charged residues 
present in DEBCL are absent in BUFFY, which allows for its localization to ER. 
The MA in both proteins is required for the correct targeting and proapoptotic 
activities of these proteins. Interestingly, a functional nuclear localization 
signal was identified in the N-terminal region of BUFFY and in the absence of 
the MA, BUFFY accumulated in the nucleus. The functional implications of these 
findings are discussed.
