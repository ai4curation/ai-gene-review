Transcription factor DREB2A interacts with a cis-acting dehydration-responsive 
element (DRE) sequence and activates expression of downstream genes involved in 
drought- and salt-stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana. Intact DREB2A 
expression does not activate downstream genes under normal growth conditions. A 
negative regulatory domain exists in the central region of DREB2A, and deletion 
of this region transforms DREB2A to a constitutive active form (DREB2A CA). We 
carried out microarray analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis-overexpressing DREB2A 
CA and found that the overexpression of DREB2A CA induces not only drought- and 
salt-responsive genes but also heat-shock (HS)-related genes. Moreover, we found 
that transient induction of the DREB2A occurs rapidly by HS stress, and that the 
sGFP-DREB2A protein accumulates in nuclei of HS-stressed cells. DREB2A 
up-regulated genes were classified into three groups based on their expression 
patterns: genes induced by HS, genes induced by drought stress, and genes 
induced by both HS and drought stress. DREB2A up-regulated genes were 
down-regulated in DREB2A knockout mutants under stress conditions. 
Thermotolerance was significantly increased in plants overexpressing DREB2A CA 
and decreased in DREB2A knockout plants. Collectively, these results indicate 
that DREB2A functions in both water and HS-stress responses.

Abstract

Transcription factor DREB2A interacts with a cis-acting dehydration-responsive element (DRE) sequence and activates expression of downstream genes involved in drought- and salt-stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana . Intact DREB2A expression does not activate downstream genes under normal growth conditions. A negative regulatory domain exists in the central region of DREB2A, and deletion of this region transforms DREB2A to a constitutive active form ( DREB2A CA ). We carried out microarray analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis -overexpressing DREB2A CA and found that the overexpression of DREB2A CA induces not only drought- and salt-responsive genes but also heat-shock (HS)-related genes. Moreover, we found that transient induction of the DREB2A occurs rapidly by HS stress, and that the sGFP-DREB2A protein accumulates in nuclei of HS-stressed cells. DREB2A up-regulated genes were classified into three groups based on their expression patterns: genes induced by HS, genes induced by drought stress, and genes induced by both HS and drought stress. DREB2A up-regulated genes were down-regulated in DREB2A knockout mutants under stress conditions. Thermotolerance was significantly increased in plants overexpressing DREB2A CA and decreased in DREB2A knockout plants. Collectively, these results indicate that DREB2A functions in both water and HS-stress responses.

Discussion

The DRE contains the core sequence A/GCCGAC and has been identified as a cis-acting promoter element in regulating gene expression in response to drought, salt, and cold stresses in Arabidopsis ( 6 ). DREB2A was subsequently isolated as a cDNA encoding a DREB protein by using a yeast one-hybrid screening ( 10 ). Therefore, the function of DREB2A under these stresses has been well studied ( 10 , 21 ), but the effect of HS stress has not been previously studied. However, in our current study, we clearly identified the up-regulation of many HS-related genes such as AtHsfA3 and HSPs , as a result of overexpressing DREB2A CA (Table 2 and Fig. 6). We subsequently confirmed that these genes were induced by HS stress (Table 2 and Fig. 2 ). Moreover, we found that the DREB2A gene is also strongly induced by HS stress ( Fig. 1 A ), and that the sGFP-DREB2A protein is stabilized in the nuclei in plant cells by HS stress ( Fig. 1 C ). We hypothesized that DREB2A is important for the regulation of gene expression in response to heat stress as well as drought and salt stress. We later confirmed this hypothesis by using the dreb2a mutants and the 35S:DREB2A CA plants. Elimination of the DREB2A gene decreased HS- and drought-stress-inducible expression of DREB2A up-regulated genes ( Fig. 3 ). Finally, we found that the 35S:DREB2A CA plants showed enhanced thermotolerance, and that the dreb2a mutants displayed reduced survival under HS condition ( Fig. 4 ).

Four of five HS-related genes, AtHsfA3 and three HSPs , that are up-regulated in the 35S:DREB2A CA plants with remarkable expression ratios greater than eight times, showed strong inducible expression by HS stress (Table 2). AtHsfA3 is a member of the HSF gene family, which consists of 21 genes belonging to three major classes that are based on structural differences, HsfA, HsfB, and HsfC. HsfAs, have been shown to be the major transcription factors that function in heat-induced expression of HSP genes ( 24 ). AtHsfA3 might act as a transcription factor in HS-stress-responsive gene expression, but detailed function of AtHsfA3 has not yet been identified. HSP70 ( At3g12580 ) encodes one of the HSP70 chaperones that have an essential function in preventing aggregation and in assisting refolding of nonnative proteins under stress conditions. They are also involved in the degradation of unstable proteins by targeting the proteins to lysosomes or proteasomes ( 22 ). Overexpression of HSP70 genes in transgenic plants has been shown to correlate positively with the acquisition of thermotolerance and results in enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and heat stress ( 22 ). Two genes, At1g52560 (CPsHSP) and HSP18.2 , encode small HS proteins (sHSPs). Although the sHSPs alone are not able to refold nonnative proteins, they probably bind to unfolded proteins and facilitate further refolding by HSP complexes ( 22 ). These HSPs probably contribute to the acquisition of stress tolerance not only to heat stress but also to drought and salt stress in the 35S:DREB2A CA plants. Five more genes such as RD17 encoding a group two LEA protein (dehydrin), AtGolS1 encoding a galactinol synthase ( 32 ), MT2A encoding a putative detoxification-related gene ( 33 ), AT4g36010 (thaumatin-like protein) encoding a PR-5 like protein related to biotic stress, and AtCYP18-1 encoding an unknown protein, were shown to be HS-inducible. These genes may have important roles to increase HS stress tolerance in the transgenic plants. On the other hand, thermotolerance of the dreb2a mutants was not dramatically reduced ( Fig. 4 ). Our microarray analysis revealed that 956 genes showed HS-responsive expression, and 110 of them are up-regulated by DREB2A (Tables 3 and 4). Functionally redundant proteins are encoded by DREB2A-regulated and -unregulated HS-responsive genes. It appears that the latter genes are capable of complementing the DREB2A mutation.

Our microarray analysis of 35S:DREB2A CA plants confirmed that many drought-stress- or HS-inducible genes are potentially downstream of DREB2A (Table 2 and Fig. 2 ). However, an analysis with a gain-of-function method with constitutive and ectopic gene expression sometimes creates false responses. Therefore, we confirmed the expression of these DREB2A up-regulated genes in the dreb2a mutants by using quantitative RT-PCR and microarray analyses. Six DREB2A up-regulated genes showed clear down-regulation of stress-inducible expression in both dreb2a-1 and - 2 plants ( Fig. 3 C and D ). Similar to DREB2A , most of the genes such as RD17 , HSP70 , AtCYP18-1 , and HSP18.2 showed rapid and transient expression in response to HS stress, but their expression was slightly delayed. Although their expression peaked 1 h after stress treatment ( Fig. 2 A and B ), HS-inducible DREB2A expression peaked between 30 min and 1 h ( Fig. 1 A ). This time lag supports the hypothesis that these genes are downstream targets of DREB2A. Drought-stress-inducible expression of At1g52690 (LEA protein) also decreased in the dreb2a mutants ( Fig. 3 E ). In addition, stress-inducible expression of At1g01470 (LEA14), COR15A , At3g17520 , XERO2 , and RD29A was reduced in the microarray analysis of the dreb2a mutants (Table 7). All of these genes have DRE in their promoter regions, suggesting they are direct downstream genes of DREB2A.

Among 483 DREB2A up-regulated genes with the expression ratios greater than two times, 68 and 107 genes showed drought- and salt-responsive gene expression, respectively (Fig. 5). Fifty-five (80%) of the 68 drought-stress-inducible genes are also induced by salt stress. This extensive overlap suggests that a common regulatory mechanism exists between drought- and salt-induced gene expression of the DREB2A up-regulated genes. One hundred ten genes showed HS-responsive expression, and only 38 of them showed drought- and/or salt stress-responsive expression (Fig. 5). HS- and drought-specific expression of the DREB2A up-regulated genes was also detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Genes shown in Fig. 2 B responded to HS but not to drought stress. In contrast, genes shown in Fig. 2 C responded to drought but not to HS stress. These results suggest that distinct regulatory mechanisms exist between HS- and drought-/salt-induced gene expression of the DREB2A up-regulated genes. Recently, Diaz-Martin et al . ( 34 ) reported that a sunflower DREB2-type protein, HaDREB2, interacts with a heat-stress factor A9 (HaHSFA9), and these proteins synergistically induce expression of HaHSP17.6 . Interaction of HS or drought-/salt-stress specific cofactors such as HaAHSFA9 may be necessary to activate DREB2A. Otherwise, HS- or drought-/salt stress-specific repressors may inhibit the gene expression activated by DREB2A.

When sGFP was fused to full-length (FL) DREB2A ( sGFP-DREB2A ) and expressed in Arabidopsis , only weak green fluorescence was observed in the nucleus under unstressed control conditions. In contrast, strong sGFP signals were observed in the nucleus of the transgenic plants expressing chimeric genes with sGFP fused to DREB2A CA. DREB2A CA lacks the negative regulatory domain that contains a PEST sequence ( 21 ). The FL DREB2A protein containing the PEST sequence may be degraded rapidly by the ubiquitin–proteasome system ( 21 ). However, strong GFP fluorescence was detected in the nuclei of transgenic plants expressing sGFP-DREB2A under HS-stress conditions ( Fig. 1 C ). These data indicate that the DREB2A protein is stabilized by HS stress and nuclear-localized during stress conditions. The PEST sequence of DREB2A (RSDASEVTSTSSQSEVCTVETPGCV) contains many phosphorylation target sites of protein kinases such as PKC and CKII. Because the phosphorylation of the PEST sequence has been reported to be important for protein degradation ( 35 ), it is plausible that the modification of the DREB2A protein by these kinases might be important for its stabilization under stress conditions.

In summary, DREB2A is shown to play an important role in crosstalk between drought- and heat-stress responses. DREB2A is HS-stress-inducible and contains an HS element in its promoter. Moreover, DREB2A controls HSF as one of the downstream genes. This complex cascade of transcription may enable plants to properly respond to both heat and drought stress.
