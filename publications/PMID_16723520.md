Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (gas6) activity is mediated through the 
receptor tyrosine kinase family members Axl, Rse, and Mer, all of which are 
expressed in human oligodendrocytes. In this study, we examined whether 
recombinant human (rh) gas6 protects oligodendrocytes from growth factor 
(insulin) withdrawal or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) cytotoxicity. In 
addition, we examined whether the effect was caspase-dependent, which receptor 
mediated the protective effect, and whether survival required Akt1 activation. 
Oligodendrocyte viability was assessed by O4 staining and terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling. 
Addition of rhgas6 to insulin-depleted cultures resulted in a significant 
increase in oligodendrocyte viability. Rhgas6 and caspase inhibitors also 
reduced active caspase-3 immunoreactivity relative to TNFalpha-only-treated 
cultures. In cultures treated with TNFalpha (100 ng/ml), the oligodendrocyte 
survival rate was 18% compared with cultures treated with TNFalpha and rhgas6 
(64%) or the caspase inhibitors IETD-fmk 
[z-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone] (65%) and zVAD-fmk 
(N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone) (63%). Increased 
phosphoAkt (Ser473) immunoreactivity was detected 15 min after administration of 
gas6 and TNFalpha to oligodendrocyte cultures but not in TNFalpha-treated 
cultures. The gas6 protective effect was abrogated by the Axl decoy receptor 
Axl-Fc, by the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase inhibitor LY294002 
[2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one], and in Akt1(-/-) 
oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocyte cultures established from wild-type and 
Rse(-/-) mice, but not from Axl(-/-) mice, were also protected from 
TNFalpha-induced cell death when maintained in rhgas6. We conclude that gas6 
signaling through the Axl receptor and the PI3 kinase/Akt1 survival pathway 
protects oligodendrocytes from growth factor withdrawal and TNFalpha-mediated 
cell death.
