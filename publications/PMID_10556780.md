To study the effects of homologous mouse GH (mGH) on the presence and 
characteristics of serum GH-binding protein (GHBP) we have used transgenic mice 
expressing GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) as a model. Chromatographic techniques 
allowed the characterization of GHBP bioactivity, and immunological techniques 
were used to determine its concentration and molecular components. 
Chromatographic separation of labeled human GH or mGH cross-linked to serum 
GHBPs showed two GH-binding serum fractions in normal as well as in transgenic 
mice serum. SDS-PAGE of this material revealed a specific band of 66 kDa and 
another higher molecular weight broad band, which, in the presence of 
2-mercapto-ethanol, is converted into the 66 kDa fraction. Since normal mice 
serum has an mGH concentration of 0. 40+/-0.06 nM and a GHBP concentration of 
5.7+/-1.1 nM, while the high-affinity site for mGH has a K(d)</+/-27 nM, only a 
small percentage (2.9%) of total serum mGH is bound to GHBP in the sera of these 
mice. In transgenic mice serum, where the mGH concentration is 60 times higher 
(23+/-2.7 nM), 22.5% of total serum mGH is bound to serum GHBP. These values 
agree with the experimental data (4+/-2% and 17+/-4% for normal and transgenic 
mice serum respectively). The concentration of GHBP in GHRH transgenic mice was 
found to be increased four- to tenfold, depending on the technique used. This 
increment closely resembles the increased concentration of GHBP in the serum of 
transgenic bovine GH (bGH) mice, in which peripheral bGH levels are grossly 
elevated. Our results support the idea that the circulating levels of mGH in 
normal mouse serum are capable of influencing the levels of GHBP in peripheral 
circulation in a way similar to that of bGH, in spite of the different 
affinities of these two hormones. The fact that the up-regulation of GHBP 
occurs, even though a small percentage of mGH is bound in these animals, 
strongly suggests the existence of a physiological function for GHBP. These 
results also question some of the assigned or attributed physiological roles of 
GHBP, at least in the mouse, since only a negligible percentage of total mGH 
would be prevented from degradation and/or renal filtration by binding to GHBP. 
This small percentage of bound mGH also invalidates its role as a reservoir or a 
buffer of mGH concentration during pulses of GH release or rapid changes of mGH 
levels. Our results also demonstrate the presence of high molecular weight forms 
of GH-GHBP complexes that could be dissociated by dilution or in the presence of 
2-mercapto-ethanol.
