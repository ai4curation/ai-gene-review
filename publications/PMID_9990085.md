Estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) orchestrate many cellular responses involved 
in female reproductive physiology, including reproductive behaviors. E- and 
P-binding neurons important for lordosis behavior have been located within the 
ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and several hormone-responsive genes have been 
observed there as well. In attempts to identify additional E- and P-responsive 
genes in the VMH that may contribute to sexual behaviors, we used the 
differential display mRNA screening technique. One of the genes identified 
encodes the 73-kDa heat shock cognate protein (Hsc73). Quantitative in situ 
hybridization analysis of brains from naturally cycling female rats revealed a 
significant increase in Hsc73 mRNA in the VMH and arcuate nucleus of animals 
during proestrus compared with those at diestrus-1. To confirm that these 
increases were steroid hormone dependent, we compared vehicle-treated 
ovariectomized females with ovariectomized females treated with estradiol 
benzoate and P. Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations showed that the 
Hsc73 gene is enhanced by E and P in the pituitary and subregions of the VMH. 
Incidentally, by examining the primary amino acid sequence of rat, human, and 
chicken progesterone receptors, we noticed that putative Hsc73 binding sites are 
conserved across species with similar sites existing in the androgen and 
glucocorticoid receptors. Together these findings suggest a possible mechanism 
through which E could influence the activities of progesterone, androgen, and 
glucocorticoid receptors, by enhancing the expression of Hsc73 in cells where 
these proteins colocalize.
