PSM/SH2-B has been described as a cellular partner of the FcepsilonRI receptor, 
insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR), 
and nerve growth factor receptor (TrkA). A function has been proposed in 
neuronal differentiation and development but its role in other signaling 
pathways is still unclear. To further elucidate the physiologic role of PSM we 
have identified additional mitogenic receptor tyrosine kinases as putative PSM 
partners including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) beta, 
hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met), and fibroblast growth factor receptor. 
We have mapped Y740 as a site of PDGFR beta that is involved in the association 
with PSM. We have further investigated the putative role of PSM in mitogenesis 
with three independent experimental strategies and found that all consistently 
suggested a role as a positive, stimulatory signaling adapter in normal NIH3T3 
and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts. (1) PSM expression from cDNA using an 
ecdysone-regulated transient expression system stimulated PDGF-BB-, IGF-I-, and 
insulin- but not EGF-induced DNA synthesis in an ecdysone dose-responsive 
fashion; (2) Microinjection of the (dominant negative) PSM SH2 domain interfered 
with PDGF-BB- and insulin-induced DNA synthesis; and (3) A peptide mimetic of 
the PSM Pro-rich putative SH3 domain-binding region interfered with PDGF-BB-, 
IGF-I-, and insulin- but not with EGF-induced DNA synthesis in NIH3T3 
fibroblasts. This experiment was based on cell-permeable fusion peptides with 
the Drosophila antennapedia homeodomain which effectively traverse the plasma 
membrane of cultured cells. These experimental strategies independently suggest 
that PSM functions as a positive, stimulatory, mitogenic signaling mediator in 
PDGF-BB, IGF-I, and insulin but not in EGF action. This function appears to 
involve the PSM SH2 domain as well as the Pro-rich putative SH3 domain binding 
region. Our findings support the model that PSM participates as an adapter in 
various mitogenic signaling mechanisms by linking an activated (receptor) 
phospho-tyrosine to the SH3 domain of an unknown cellular partner.
