Actin works in concert with myosin I to regulate the transcription of ribosomal 
genes in the nucleolus. Recently, nucleolar actin has been shown to be active in 
its polymeric form raising the question how actin dynamics is regulated in the 
nucleolus. Here, we show that the actin capping protein CapG localizes in the 
nucleolus of cultured cells. CapG transport to the nucleolus is an active and 
ATP-dependent process. Association of CapG with the nucleolus requires active 
RNA Polymerase I transcription. In addition, we show that activated Ran GTPase, 
an interaction partner of CapG, is also transported to the nucleolus. A 
constitutively active Ran mutant promotes CapG accumulation in the nucleolus 
indicating that CapG transport to the nucleolus can be supported by Ran. Our 
results suggest that filamentous actin in the nucleolus might be regulated by 
actin binding proteins such as CapG.
