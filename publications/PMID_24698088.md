High-temperature requirement protease A2 (HtrA2), a multitasking serine protease 
that is involved in critical biological functions and pathogenicity, such as 
apoptosis and cancer, is a potent therapeutic target. It is established that the 
C-terminal post-synaptic density protein, Drosophila disc large tumor 
suppressor, zonula occludens-1 protein (PDZ) domain of HtrA2 plays pivotal role 
in allosteric modulation, substrate binding and activation, as commonly reported 
in other members of this family. Interestingly, HtrA2 exhibits an additional 
level of functional modulation through its unique N-terminus, as is evident from 
'inhibitor of apoptosis proteins' binding and cleavage. This phenomenon 
emphasizes multiple activation mechanisms, which so far remain elusive. Using 
conformational dynamics, binding kinetics and enzymology studies, we addressed 
this complex behavior with respect to defining its global mode of regulation and 
activity. Our findings distinctly demonstrate a novel N-terminal ligand-mediated 
triggering of an allosteric switch essential for transforming HtrA2 to a 
proteolytically competent state in a PDZ-independent yet synergistic activation 
process. Dynamic analyses suggested that it occurs through a series of 
coordinated structural reorganizations at distal regulatory loops (L3, LD, L1), 
leading to a population shift towards the relaxed conformer. This precise 
synergistic coordination among different domains might be physiologically 
relevant to enable tighter control upon HtrA2 activation for fostering its 
diverse cellular functions. Understanding this complex rheostatic dual switch 
mechanism offers an opportunity for targeting various disease conditions with 
tailored site-specific effector molecules.
