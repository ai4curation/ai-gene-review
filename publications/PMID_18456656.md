SOX genes encode a family of high-mobility group transcription factors that play 
critical roles in organogenesis. The functional specificity of different SOX 
proteins and the tissue specificity of a particular SOX factor are largely 
determined by the differential partnership of SOX transcription factors with 
other transcription regulators, many of which have not yet been discovered. 
Virtually all members of the SOX family have been found to be deregulated in a 
wide variety of tumors. However, little is known about the cellular and 
molecular behaviors involved in the oncogenic potential of SOX proteins. Using 
cell culture experiments, tissue analysis, molecular profiling, and animal 
studies, we report here that SOX2 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis 
by facilitating the G(1)/S transition and through its transcription regulation 
of the CCND1 gene in breast cancer cells. In addition, we identified 
beta-catenin as the transcription partner for SOX2 and demonstrated that SOX2 
and beta-catenin act in synergy in the transcription regulation of CCND1 in 
breast cancer cells. Our experiments not only determined a role for SOX2 in 
mammary tumorigenesis but also revealed another activity of the multifunctional 
protein, beta-catenin.
