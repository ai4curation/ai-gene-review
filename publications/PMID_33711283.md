Impaired ribosome function is the underlying etiology in a group of bone marrow 
failure syndromes called ribosomopathies. However, how ribosomes are regulated 
remains poorly understood, as are approaches to restore hematopoietic stem cell 
(HSC) function loss because of defective ribosome biogenesis. Here we reveal a 
role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HectD1 in regulating HSC function via ribosome 
assembly and protein translation. Hectd1-deficient HSCs exhibit a striking 
defect in transplantation ability and ex vivo maintenance concomitant with 
reduced protein synthesis and growth rate under stress conditions. 
Mechanistically, HectD1 ubiquitinates and degrades ZNF622, an assembly factor 
for the ribosomal 60S subunit. Hectd1 loss leads to accumulation of ZNF622 and 
the anti-association factor eIF6 on 60S, resulting in 60S/40S joining defects. 
Importantly, Znf622 depletion in Hectd1-deficient HSCs restored ribosomal 
subunit joining, protein synthesis, and HSC reconstitution capacity. These 
findings highlight the importance of ubiquitin-coordinated ribosome assembly in 
HSC regeneration.
