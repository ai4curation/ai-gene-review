Many bacteria and about 40,000 plant species form primary carbohydrate reserves 
based on fructan; these polymers of beta-D-fructofuranose are thought to confer 
tolerance to drought and frost in plants. Microbial fructan, the 
beta(2,6)-linked levan, is synthesized directly from sucrose by levansucrase, 
which is able to catalyze both sucrose hydrolysis and levan polymerization. The 
crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis levansucrase, determined to a resolution 
of 1.5 A, shows a rare five-fold beta-propeller topology with a deep, negatively 
charged central pocket. Arg360, a residue essential for polymerase activity, 
lies in a solvent-exposed site adjacent to the central pocket. Mutagenesis data 
and the sucrose-bound structure of inactive levansucrase E342A, at a resolution 
of 2.1 A, strongly suggest that three conserved acidic side chains in the 
central pocket are critical for catalysis, and presumably function as 
nucleophile (Asp86) and general acid (Glu342), or stabilize the transition state 
(Asp247).
