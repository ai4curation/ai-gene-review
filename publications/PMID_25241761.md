Signal transduction pathways in the cell require protein-protein interactions 
(PPIs) to respond to environmental cues. Diverse experimental techniques for 
detecting PPIs have been developed. However, the huge amount of PPI data 
accumulated from various sources poses a challenge with respect to data 
reliability. Herein, we collected ∼ 700 primary antibodies and employed a highly 
sensitive and specific technique, an in situ proximity ligation assay, to 
investigate 1204 endogenous PPIs in HeLa cells, and 557 PPIs of them tested 
positive. To overview the tested PPIs, we mapped them into 13 PPI public 
databases, which showed 72% of them were annotated in the Human Protein 
Reference Database (HPRD) and 8 PPIs were new PPIs not in the PubMed database. 
Moreover, TP53, CTNNB1, AKT1, CDKN1A, and CASP3 were the top 5 proteins 
prioritized by topology analyses of the 557 PPI network. Integration of the 
PPI-pathway interaction revealed that 90 PPIs were cross-talk PPIs linking 17 
signaling pathways based on Reactome annotations. The top 2 connected cross-talk 
PPIs are MAPK3-DAPK1 and FAS-PRKCA interactions, which link 9 and 8 pathways, 
respectively. In summary, we established an open resource for biological modules 
and signaling pathway profiles, providing a foundation for comprehensive 
analysis of the human interactome.

Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), a ubiquitously expressed 60 kDa serine/threonine kinase, plays crucial roles in various cellular processes. Mst1 is activated by autophosphorylation at Thr183 and caspase 3-mediated cleavage, producing a catalytically active 36/37 kDa (or, in some studies, a 34 kDa) fragment under apoptotic conditions. However, whether the 34 and 36/37 kDa fragments observed in different studies are identical remains unclear, given their similar sizes and the specific detection of a 34 kDa fragment in normal mouse liver and intestinal epithelial cells. This study aimed to resolve this question. Here, we demonstrate that 34 and 36/37 kDa fragments are distinct and coexist in staurosporine-treated neuronal cells. Peptide mapping revealed that the 34 kDa band corresponds to Mst1 amino acids 1–301, in contrast to the caspase 3-cleaved 36/37 kDa fragment, which comprises amino acids 1–326. The 34 kDa fragment is expressed endogenously in the forebrain under physiological conditions, lacks Thr183 phosphorylation, and shows higher expression in brain regions such as the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, while being absent in the brainstem and cerebellum. However, the 34 kDa fragment produced in Escherichia coli exhibits kinase activity comparable to that of the 37 kDa fragment. Furthermore, incubation of recombinant full-length Mst1 with brain extracts resulted in the production of a 34 kDa fragment, suggesting a potential proteolytic mechanism for its generation. Collectively, these findings prove that the 34 kD Mst1 present in normal brain tissues and neuronal cells is distinct from the 36/37 kD Mst1 fragment produced by caspase 3 cleavage under apoptotic conditions. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate its function.
