Signal transduction pathways in the cell require protein-protein interactions 
(PPIs) to respond to environmental cues. Diverse experimental techniques for 
detecting PPIs have been developed. However, the huge amount of PPI data 
accumulated from various sources poses a challenge with respect to data 
reliability. Herein, we collected âˆ¼ 700 primary antibodies and employed a highly 
sensitive and specific technique, an in situ proximity ligation assay, to 
investigate 1204 endogenous PPIs in HeLa cells, and 557 PPIs of them tested 
positive. To overview the tested PPIs, we mapped them into 13 PPI public 
databases, which showed 72% of them were annotated in the Human Protein 
Reference Database (HPRD) and 8 PPIs were new PPIs not in the PubMed database. 
Moreover, TP53, CTNNB1, AKT1, CDKN1A, and CASP3 were the top 5 proteins 
prioritized by topology analyses of the 557 PPI network. Integration of the 
PPI-pathway interaction revealed that 90 PPIs were cross-talk PPIs linking 17 
signaling pathways based on Reactome annotations. The top 2 connected cross-talk 
PPIs are MAPK3-DAPK1 and FAS-PRKCA interactions, which link 9 and 8 pathways, 
respectively. In summary, we established an open resource for biological modules 
and signaling pathway profiles, providing a foundation for comprehensive 
analysis of the human interactome.
