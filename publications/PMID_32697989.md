Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is pervasive in the human genome. 
However, the mechanisms controlling transcription at promoters and enhancers 
remain enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that Integrator subunit 11 (INTS11), the 
catalytic subunit of the Integrator complex, regulates transcription at these 
loci through its endonuclease activity. Promoters of genes require INTS11 to 
cleave nascent transcripts associated with paused RNAPII and induce their 
premature termination in the proximity of the +1 nucleosome. The turnover of 
RNAPII permits the subsequent recruitment of an elongation-competent RNAPII 
complex, leading to productive elongation. In contrast, enhancers require INTS11 
catalysis not to evict paused RNAPII but rather to terminate enhancer RNA 
transcription beyond the +1 nucleosome. These findings are supported by the 
differential occupancy of negative elongation factor (NELF), SPT5, and 
tyrosine-1-phosphorylated RNAPII. This study elucidates the role of Integrator 
in mediating transcriptional elongation at human promoters through the 
endonucleolytic cleavage of nascent transcripts and the dynamic turnover of 
RNAPII.
