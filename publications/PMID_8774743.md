Molecular cloning of cDNA for a new regulatory subunit, designated p97, of the 
human 26S proteasome showed that the polypeptide consists of 908 amino acid 
residues with a calculated molecular mass of 100184 Da and an isoelectric point 
of 4.94. Computer analysis showed that p97 is very similar to type-1 
tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-receptor-associated protein (TRAP)-2 and 55.11, both 
of which were identified recently as binding proteins of the cytoplasmic domain 
of type-1 TNF receptor by yeast two-hybrid screening. This finding suggests that 
the 26S proteasome might serve as a mediator molecule in the TNF signaling 
pathway in cells. Computer-assisted similarity analysis also revealed the high 
sequence similarity of p97 with a yeast protein whose function is yet unknown, 
the gene for which is here termed NAS1 (non-ATPase subunit 1). Disruption of 
NAS1 resulted in several phenotypes, including lethality and 
temperature-sensitive growth, depending on the genetic background of the cells 
used. The human p97 cDNA suppressed the growth defect of nas1 disruptant cells, 
when expressed from single-copy or multi-copy vectors, indicating that p97 is 
functionally equivalent to yeast Nas1p. Culturing of the temperature-sensitive 
nas1 cells at the restrictive temperature promoted the accumulation 
polyubiquitinated cellular proteins, implying that the 26S proteasome requires a 
functional Nas1p subunit for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These results 
indicate that p97/Nas1p plays an important regulatory role in the function of 
the 26S proteasome.
