In the red blood cell (RBC), adducin is present primarily as tetramers of alpha- 
and beta-subunits at spectrin-actin junctions, or junctional complexes. Mouse 
RBCs also contain small amounts of gamma-adducin. Platelets contain alpha- and 
gamma-adducin only. Adducin functions as a barbed-end actin capping protein to 
regulate actin filament length and recruits spectrin to the ends of actin 
filaments. To further define adducin's role in vivo, we generated alpha-adducin 
knockout mice. alpha-Adducin is absent in all tissues examined in homozygous 
null mice. In RBCs, beta- and gamma-adducin are also absent, indicating that 
alpha-adducin is the limiting subunit in tetramer formation at the 
spectrin-actin junction. Similarly, gamma-adducin is absent in alpha-null 
platelets. alpha-Adducin-null mice display compensated hemolytic anemia with 
features characteristic of RBCs in hereditary spherocytosis (HS), including 
spherocytes with significant loss of surface area, decreased mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV), cell dehydration, and increased osmotic fragility. Platelets 
maintain their normal discoid shape, and bleeding times are normal. 
alpha-Adducin-null mice show growth retardation at birth and throughout 
adulthood. Approximately 50% develop lethal communicating hydrocephalus with 
striking dilation of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. These data 
indicate that adducin plays a role in RBC membrane stability and in 
cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis.
