SUMOylation is a dynamic process, catalyzed by SUMO-specific ligases and 
reversed by Sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs). The physiologic 
consequences of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation are not fully understood. Here we 
investigate the phenotypes of mice lacking SENP1 and find that SENP1(-/-) 
embryos show severe fetal anemia stemming from deficient erythropoietin (Epo) 
production and die midgestation. We determine that SENP1 controls Epo production 
by regulating the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) 
during hypoxia. Hypoxia induces SUMOylation of HIF1alpha, which promotes its 
binding to a ubiquitin ligase, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, through a 
proline hydroxylation-independent mechanism, leading to its ubiquitination and 
degradation. In SENP1(-/-) MEFs, hypoxia-induced transcription of 
HIF1alpha-dependent genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 
glucose transporter 1 (Glut-1) is markedly reduced. These results show that 
SENP1 plays a key role in the regulation of the hypoxic response through 
regulation of HIF1alpha stability and that SUMOylation can serve as a direct 
signal for ubiquitin-dependent degradation.
