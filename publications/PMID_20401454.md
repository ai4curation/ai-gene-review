Diabetes mellitus is caused by deficiency of insulin secretion from the 
pancreatic islet beta cells and/or insulin resistance in liver, muscle and 
adipocytes, resulting in glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia. Several protein 
tyrosine phosphatases, such as PTP1B (PTPN1), TCPTP (PTPN2), LYP (PTPN22), 
PTPIA-2, PTPMEG2 (PTPN9) or OSTPTP are involved in insulin signaling pathway, 
insulin secretion and autoreactive attack to pancreatic beta cells. Genetic 
mutation or overexpression of these phosphotases has been found to cause or 
increase the risk of diabetes mellitus. Some population with high risk for type 
2 diabetes has overexpressed PTP1B, a prototypical tyrosine phosphatase which 
down-regulates insulin and leptin signal transduction. Animal PTP1B knockout 
model and PTP1B specific inhibitor cellular studies indicate PTP1B may serve as 
a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes. TCPTP shares more than 70% sequence 
identity with PTP1B in their catalytic domain. TCPTP dephosphorylates tyrosine 
phosphorylated substrates overlapping with PTP1B but also has its own distinct 
dephosphorylation sites and functions. Recent research indicates TCPTP may have 
role in type 1 diabetes via dysregultaion of cytokine-mediated immune responses 
or pancreatic beta cell apoptosis. The tyrosine phosphatase LYP, which 
down-regulates LCK activity in T cell response, can become mutated as R620W 
which is highly correlated to type 1 diabetes. LYP R620W may be a gain of 
function mutation which suppresses TCR signaling. Patients bearing the R620W 
mutant have impaired T cell responses and increased populations of 
(CD45RO+CD45RA-) CD4+ T cells. A detailed elucidation of mechanism of R620W in 
type 1 diabetes and specific LYP inhibitor development will help characterize 
LYP R620W as a therapeutic target. A receptor tyrosine phosphatase, PTPIA-2/beta 
is a major autoantigen of type 1 diabetes. A diagnosis kit identifying 
PTPIA-2/beta autoantibodies is valuable in early detection and prevention of 
type 1 diabetes. In addition, other phosphatase like OSTPTP and PTPMEG2 are 
involved in type 2 diabetes via regulation of insulin production, beta cell 
growth or insulin signaling. Research into understanding the mechanism of these 
tyrosine phosphatases in diabetes, such as their precise functions in the 
regulation of insulin secretion, the insulin response and the immune response 
will strengthen our knowledge of diabetes pathophysiology which may result in 
new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for diabetes.
