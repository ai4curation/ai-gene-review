Neuropeptides, including mammalian bombesin-like peptides, act as potent 
cellular growth factors and have been implicated in a variety of normal and 
abnormal processes, including development, inflammation, and malignant 
transformation. These signaling peptides exert their characteristic effects on 
cellular processes by binding to specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on 
the surface of their target cells. Typically, the binding of a neuropeptide to 
its cognate GPCR triggers the activation of multiple signal transduction 
pathways that act in a synergistic and combinatorial fashion to relay the 
mitogenic signal to the nucleus and promote cell proliferation. A rapid increase 
in the synthesis of lipid-derived second messengers with subsequent activation 
of protein phosphorylation cascades is an important early response to 
neuropeptides. An emerging theme in signal transduction is that these agonists 
also induce rapid and coordinate tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins 
including the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase p125fak and the adaptor proteins 
p130cas and paxillin. This tyrosine phosphorylation pathway depends on the 
integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and requires functional Rho. The purpose of 
this article is to review recent advances in unraveling the pathways that play a 
role in transducing mitogenic and migratory responses induced by G 
protein-coupled neuropeptide receptor agonists.
