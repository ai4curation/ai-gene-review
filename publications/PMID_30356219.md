Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and basic metabolic 
processes. The application of nitrogen-containing fertilizer increases yield, 
which has been a substantial factor in the green revolution1. Ecologically, 
however, excessive application of fertilizer has disastrous effects such as 
eutrophication2. A better understanding of how plants regulate nitrogen 
metabolism is critical to increase plant yield and reduce fertilizer overuse. 
Here we present a transcriptional regulatory network and twenty-one 
transcription factors that regulate the architecture of root and shoot systems 
in response to changes in nitrogen availability. Genetic perturbation of a 
subset of these transcription factors revealed coordinate transcriptional 
regulation of enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism. Transcriptional 
regulators in the network are transcriptionally modified by feedback via genetic 
perturbation of nitrogen metabolism. The network, genes and gene-regulatory 
modules identified here will prove critical to increasing agricultural 
productivity.
