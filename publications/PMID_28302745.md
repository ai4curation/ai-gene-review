Percutaneous therapies for congenital heart disease have evolved rapidly in the 
past 3 decades. This has occurred despite limited investment from industry and 
support from regulatory bodies resulting in a lack of specific device 
development. Indeed, many devices remain off-label with a best-fit approach 
often required, spurning an innovative culture within the subspecialty, which 
had arguably laid the foundation for many of the current and evolving structural 
heart interventions. Challenges remain, not least encouraging device design 
focused on smaller infants and the inevitable consequences of somatic growth. 
Data collection tools are emerging but remain behind adult cardiology and 
cardiac surgery and leading to partial blindness as to the longer-term 
consequences of our interventions. Tail coating on the back of developments in 
other fields of adult intervention will soon fail to meet the expanding needs 
for more precise interventions and biological materials. Increasing 
collaboration with surgical colleagues will require development of dedicated 
equipment for hybrid interventions aimed at minimizing the longer-term 
consequences of scar to the heart. Therefore, great challenges remain to ensure 
that children and adults with congenital heart disease continue to benefit from 
an exponential growth in minimally invasive interventions and technology. This 
can only be achieved through a concerted collaborative approach from physicians, 
industry, academia, and regulatory bodies supporting great innovators to 
continue the philosophy of thinking beyond the limits that has been the 
foundation of our specialty for the past 50 years.
