Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is expressed in an exaggerated fashion in 
epithelial cells at sites of pulmonary T helper cell type 2 inflammation and 
plays important roles in the pathogenesis of anti-parasite and asthma-like 
responses. However, the mechanisms that control epithelial cell AMCase secretion 
and its effector responses have not been adequately defined. To address these 
issues, we used in vivo and in vitro experimental systems to define the pathways 
of epithelial AMCase secretion and its epithelial regulatory effects. Here we 
demonstrate that, in murine T helper cell type 2 modeling systems, AMCase 
colocalizes with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ADAM17 (a 
membrane disintegrin and metallopeptidase 17) in lung epithelial cells. In vitro 
cotransfection experiments in A549 cells demonstrated that AMCase and EGFR 
physically interact with each other. Cotransfection of AMCase and EGFR also 
increased, whereas EGFR inhibition decreased AMCase secretion. Interestingly, 
AMCase secretion was not significantly altered by treatment with EGF but was 
significantly decreased when the upstream EGFR transactivator ADAM17 was 
inhibited. AMCase secretion was also decreased when the EGFR-downstream Ras was 
blocked. Transfected and recombinant AMCase induced epithelial cell production 
of CCL2, CCL17, and CXCL8. These studies demonstrate that lung epithelial cells 
secrete AMCase via an EGFR-dependent pathway that is activated by ADAM17 and 
mediates its effects via Ras. They also demonstrate that the AMCase that is 
secreted feeds back in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion to stimulate 
pulmonary epithelial cell chemokine production.

Abstract

Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is expressed in an exaggerated fashion
 in epithelial cells at sites of pulmonary T helper cell type 2 inflammation
 and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of anti-parasite and asthma-like
 responses. However, the mechanisms that control epithelial cell AMCase
 secretion and its effector responses have not been adequately defined. To
 address these issues, we used i n vivo and in vitro experimental systems to define the pathways of epithelial AMCase secretion and
 its epithelial regulatory effects. Here we demonstrate that, in murine T
 helper cell type 2 modeling systems, AMCase colocalizes with the epidermal
 growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ADAM17 (a membrane disintegrin and
 metallopeptidase 17) in lung epithelial cells. In vitro cotransfection experiments in A549 cells demonstrated that AMCase and EGFR
 physically interact with each other. Cotransfection of AMCase and EGFR also
 increased, whereas EGFR inhibition decreased AMCase secretion. Interestingly,
 AMCase secretion was not significantly altered by treatment with EGF but was
 significantly decreased when the upstream EGFR transactivator ADAM17 was
 inhibited. AMCase secretion was also decreased when the EGFR-downstream Ras
 was blocked. Transfected and recombinant AMCase induced epithelial cell
 production of CCL2, CCL17, and CXCL8. These studies demonstrate that lung
 epithelial cells secrete AMCase via an EGFR-dependent pathway that is
 activated by ADAM17 and mediates its effects via Ras. They also demonstrate
 that the AMCase that is secreted feeds back in an autocrine and/or paracrine
 fashion to stimulate pulmonary epithelial cell chemokine production.

RESULTS

AMCase, EGFR, and ADAM17 Are Induced and Co-localize in Vivo at Sites
 of Th2 and Th2-Cytokine-mediated Airway Inflammation —To
 characterize and quantify intracellular AMCase expression in lung epithelial
 cells in vivo , we established a flow cytometric epithelial evaluation
 method based on light scatter parameters, negative expression of CD45,
 negative expression of CD31, and positive expression of cytokeratin
 ( Fig. 1 ). Using this method, we
 successfully compared the levels of intracellular AMCase in lung epithelial
 cells from control mice, mice sensitized and challenged with OVA, and
 IL-13-overexpressing transgenic animals. These studies demonstrated a
 significant increase in intracellular AMCase in both of the modeling systems
 ( Fig. 2, a–d ).
 The increase in intracellular AMCase in these Th2 inflammation/asthma models
 was paralleled by an increase of total EGFR in lung lysates
 ( Fig. 3 a ) as well as
 specific EGFR surface expression on lung epithelial cells as analyzed by
 immunohistochemistry ( Fig.
 3 b ) and flow cytometry
 ( Fig. 3, c and d ). Using confocal microscopy, AMCase and EGFR were found
 to co-localize in lung epithelial cells of lungs of IL-13 transgenic and
 OVA-sensitized and -challenged mice ( Fig.
 3 e ) (data not shown).

Similar to EGFR, our studies demonstrated that ADAM17 surface expression on
 lung epithelial cells was up-regulated in IL-13 transgenic mice
 ( Fig. 3, f and g ) and OVA-sensitized and challenged mice
 ( Fig. 3 f ). In
 OVA-sensitized and saline-challenged or saline-sensitized and OVA-challenged
 mice, no induction of AMCase, EGFR, or ADAM17 was observed (data not shown).
 Further analyses using flow cytometry showed co-expression of AMCase, EGFR,
 and ADAM17 on lung epithelial cells in OVA-sensitized and -challenged and
 IL-13 transgenic mice on a single cell level
 ( Fig. 4 ) (data not shown). When
 viewed in combination, these data demonstrate that AMCase, EGFR, and ADAM17
 are concomitantly up-regulated in lung epithelial cells at sites of
 Th2/allergic inflammation in vivo , where they co-localize with each
 other.

EGFR Physically Interacts with AMCase —To determine if AMCase
 and EGFR physically interact with one another, lung epithelial cells (A549)
 were transfected with vectors driving the expression of full-length cDNA
 encoding these moieties, alone and in combination. The interaction of AMCase
 and EGFR was then evaluated using combined immunoprecipitation and
 immunoblotting protocols. These studies demonstrated that these molecules bind
 to each other in these cells, since antibodies against one consistently
 precipitated the other ( Fig.
 5 ).

EGFR Modulates AMCase Secretion —Studies were next undertaken
 to define the intracellular pathway(s) that epithelial cells use to secrete
 AMCase. In these experiments, A549 cells were transfected with recombinant
 human full-length AMCase. This resulted in the secretion of bioactive AMCase
 into the cell supernatant that could be appreciated after 24 h and was most
 prominent after 48 h of incubation ( Fig.
 6 a ). The co-transfection of these cells with EGFR
 enhanced AMCase activity in a dose-dependent manner
 ( Fig. 6 a ). In
 contrast, transfection of EGFR without AMCase had no effect on supernatant
 chitinase activity (data not shown). Based on these findings, we hypothesized
 that EGFR signaling is required for the secretion of AMCase. To test this
 hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of exogenous EGF and small molecule EGFR
 kinase inhibitors on AMCase secretion in AMCase/EGFR-co-transfected A549
 cells. The former demonstrated that exogenous EGF up to 5 ng/ml had no effect
 on AMCase secretion by these cells, whereas very high concentrations of EGF
 (>200 ng/ml) only caused slight but not statistically significant increases
 in AMCase elaboration ( Fig.
 6 b ) (data not shown). However, pharmacologic blockade of
 the ATP binding site of EGFR, which inactivates its downstream signaling,
 caused a significant decrease in the levels of supernatant AMCase
 ( Fig. 6 b ).
 Importantly, the levels of intracellular AMCase were significantly increased
 in lysates from these EGFR inhibitor-treated A549 cells
 ( Fig. 6 c ). This
 demonstrates that AMCase is produced but cannot leave the cell without EGFR
 signaling activity. In combination, these studies demonstrate that
 ligand-independent EGFR signaling plays a critical role in epithelial cell
 AMCase secretion.

ADAM17 and Ras Regulate AMCase Secretion —Because EGFR
 regulation of AMCase secretion was largely ligand-independent, we hypothesized
 that constitutive EGFR activation via protease-mediated liberation of
 membrane-bound ligands ( 11 )
 plays a major role in this process. Since ADAM17 is a major regulator of EGFR
 activity by liberation of cell surface-bound EGFR ligands and subsequent
 transactivation of EGFR ( 14 ),
 studies were next undertaken to determine if inhibition of ADAM17 altered
 epithelial cell AMCase secretion. This was accomplished with the specific
 ADAM17 inhibitors TAPI-1 and TAPI-2. In these experiments, ADAM17 inhibition
 decreased AMCase secretion ( Fig.
 7 ). The effects of TAPI-1 an TAPI-2 were comparable with those
 that were seen with small molecule kinase inhibitors that blocked the ATP
 binding site of EGFR ( PD153035 ) and interfered with EGFR tyrosine kinases
 (AG1478) ( Fig. 7 ). In accord
 with these findings, inhibition of Ras, an oncogene downstream of EGFR, also
 decreased AMCase secretion ( Fig.
 7 a ), In contrast, inhibition of ERK did not alter AMCase
 secretion ( Fig. 7 ). To further
 define the specificity of this finding, we used different doses of these
 pharmacological inhibitors and compared AMCase secretion with IL-6 secretion
 by A549 cells ( Fig.
 7 b ). These studies demonstrated that manumycin A, a
 natural inhibitor of Ras farnesyltransferase, inhibited AMCase secretion in a
 dose-dependent manner, whereas ERK inhibition had no effect at all doses
 tested ( Fig. 7 b , top ). In contrast to AMCase secretion, IL-6 secretion was not
 affected by Ras inhibition ( Fig.
 7 b , bottom ). When viewed in combination, these
 studies demonstrate that lung epithelial cell AMCase secretion is selectively
 regulated via a pathway involving ADAM17, EGFR, and Ras.

AMCase Stimulates Epithelial Chemokine Production —Previous
 studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the in vivo inhibition
 of AMCase decreased aeroallergen-induced inflammatory cell accumulation in the
 airway ( 6 ). This prompted us to
 determine if AMCase stimulated epithelial cell chemokine production. To
 address this issue we compared the levels of MCP-1/CCL2, TARC/CCL17, and
 IL-8/CXCL8 in supernatants from A549 cells transfected with AMCase and control
 constructs and A549 cells incubated with varying concentrations of exogenous
 recombinant AMCase or vehicle control. In both experimental systems, AMCase
 stimulated epithelial cell production of these cytokines
 ( Fig. 8, a–d ).
 This stimulation was most prominent after 48 h of A549 cell-AMCase incubation.
 ( Fig. 8 and data not shown).
 These studies demonstrate that the AMCase that is produced by epithelial cells
 feeds back in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner to stimulate epithelial
 cell chemokine production.

DISCUSSION

AMCase is induced during and plays an important role in anti-parasite and
 Th2 responses ( 6 , 26 ). Surprisingly, the
 molecular mechanisms controlling AMCase elaboration and its effector responses
 in these settings have not been adequately defined. To address these issues,
 we defined the mechanisms that regulate epithelial AMCase secretion and the
 epithelial regulatory effects that it has once it is elaborated. These studies
 demonstrate that AMCase physically interacts with EGFR and co-localizes with
 EGFR and ADAM17 and that epithelial AMCase secretion is regulated by an
 ADAM17/EGFR/Ras-dependent pathway. They also demonstrate that the AMCase that
 is produced feeds back in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner to induce
 epithelial chemokine elaboration.

EGFR has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Th2 tissue
 inflammation via its ability to regulate goblet cell metaplasia, mucin
 synthesis, and epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival
 ( 12 , 27 – 29 ).
 Recent studies demonstrated that EGFR signaling mediates allergen-induced
 chemokine (TARC/CCL17) release by lung epithelial cells
 ( 30 ). EGFR signaling can be
 triggered by EGF as well as TGF-α, heparin binding epidermal growth
 factor, and amphiregulin ( 31 ).
 These latter ligands are synthesized as transmembrane proforms and are
 processed to their mature, receptor-activating forms by ADAM proteases, such
 as ADAM17/TACE ( 14 ). ADAM17
 acts as a sheddase where it processes and thereby regulates a variety of
 mediators and receptors, including EGFR transactivation
 ( 14 ), ectodomain shedding of
 TNF-α and TNFI and TNFII (TNF receptors I and II, respectively)
 ( 32 ), platelet glycoproteins
 ( 33 ), neurotrophin receptors
 ( 34 ), l -selectin
 ( 35 ), angiotensin-converting
 enzyme-2 ( 36 ), and fractalkine
 ( 37 ). ADAM17 activity in
 pulmonary epithelial cells has been reported to be induced by IL-13
 ( 19 , 30 ), and TACE/ADAM17
 processing of EGFR ligands has been found to play a critical role in
 IL-13-induced airway responses and proliferation of epithelial cells
 ( 19 , 30 ). Previous studies from our
 laboratory demonstrated that IL-13 stimulates epithelial AMCase production,
 that AMCase accumulates in the cytoplasm of distal airway epithelial cells in
 a distinctly granular manner, and that AMCase plays a critical role in the
 pathogenesis of IL-13-induced tissue alterations
 ( 6 , 7 ). This caused us to
 hypothesize that EGFR and AMCase interact with each other and that
 ADAM17/EGFR-dependent pathways are involved in the secretion of AMCase by
 epithelial cells. Our data support this hypothesis in a number of ways. First,
 they demonstrate that the IL-13-induced increase in lung epithelial cell
 AMCase expression is paralleled by a similar increase of EGFR and ADAM17
 expression and that all three proteins colocalize in lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo . They also demonstrate that AMCase and
 EGFR physically interact with each other. Last, they demonstrate that
 inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, ADAM17 inhibition, or inhibition of the
 EGFR downstream signaling molecule Ras impair epithelial cell AMCase
 secretion, whereas inhibition of ERK had no effect. This effect was not due to
 general inhibition of the cell secretion apparatus, since secretion of IL-6
 was unaffected by inhibition of this pathway. When viewed in combination,
 these data tempt us to speculate that the following scenario is taking place
 in allergic/Th2 inflammation. IL-13, while inducing AMCase production,
 concomitantly activates ADAM17 on pulmonary epithelial cells
 ( 13 , 19 ). ADAM17 transactivates
 EGFR on epithelial cells, which then in turn triggers a downstream signaling
 cascade involving Ras, thereby facilitating the trafficking and secretion of
 AMCase ( 11 , 38 – 40 ).
 The involvement of Ras in AMCase secretion is in accord with its known roles
 in exocytosis and vesicular trafficking
 ( 41 , 42 ). EGFR may also participate
 in the trafficking of intracellular AMCase, since EGFR is well known to be
 internalized and undergoes further endosomal processing and recycling
 ( 43 – 45 ).
 Our demonstration that AMCase and EGFR physically bind to each other supports
 this possibility. Further support for this hypothesis can be seen in recent
 data from our laboratory that demonstrate that the CAML (calcium modulator and
 cyclophilin ligand) protein, which is required for appropriate EGFR recycling
 ( 46 ), binds AMCase
 intracellularly. 4

Studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that 18 glycosyl
 hydrolase proteins, including AMCase, BRP-39 (murine breast regression protein
 39), and YKL-40 (the human homologue of BRP-39), are stimulated during
 parasite infections and Th2 inflammation
 ( 4 , 6 , 47 ). To understand the
 processes that are involved in these important responses, the biologic
 repertoires of these moieties have begun to be investigated. These studies
 demonstrated that AMCase is an important regulator of responses to
 chitin-containing pathogens and contributes to tissue inflammation in
 chitin-free situations ( 6 , 26 ). The present studies add
 to our understanding of the biology of these responses by demonstrating that
 epithelial cell AMCase secretion is regulated by an EGFR/ADAM17/Ras-dependent
 mechanism and that AMCase feeds back in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner
 to induce epithelial chemokine production. The EGFR-related observations raise
 the intriguing possibility that many of the important roles of EGFR in Th2
 responses are the result of EGFR regulation of AMCase secretion. The chemokine
 findings also provide an intriguing explanation for the decrease in
 bronchoalveolar lavage and tissue inflammation that was seen when free AMCase
 was neutralized in the ovalbumin sensitization and challenge asthma model
 ( 6 ). Last, an appropriate
 anti-parasite response needs to rapidly attack the pathogen and induce an
 inflammatory response that is powerful enough to control the invading agent.
 The present studies and studies from others
 ( 26 ) suggest that AMCase
 contributes to both of these responses, with the chitinolytic activity of
 AMCase mediating anti-parasitic effects and the ability of AMCase to stimulate
 epithelial cell chemokines
 ( 15 ) contributing to the
 induction of tissue inflammation. Further experimentation will be required to
 evaluate the validity of this mechanistic construct.

In summary, these studies provide novel insights into the secretion and
 effector functions of AMCase. They demonstrate that AMCase colocalizes and
 physically interacts with EGFR and that AMCase secretion is mediated via an
 ADAM17/EGFR/Ras-dependent pathway. They also demonstrate that the AMCase that
 is secreted stimulates epithelial chemokine production. These findings will
 help to clarify the utility of AMCase-based interventions in the treatment of
 allergic inflammation as well as other Th2-dominated disorders.
