The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are transported by a family of 
high-affinity binding proteins (IGFBPs) that protect IGFs from degradation, 
limit their binding to IGF receptors, and modulate IGF actions. The six 
classical IGFBPs have been believed to have no affinity for insulin. We now 
demonstrate that IGFBP-7/mac25, a newly identified member of the IGFBP 
superfamily that binds IGFs specifically with low affinity is a high-affinity 
insulin binding protein. IGFBP-7 blocks insulin binding to the insulin receptor 
and thereby inhibiting the earliest steps in insulin action, such as 
autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta subunit and phosphorylation of 
IRS-1, indicating that IGFBP-7 is a functional insulin-binding protein. The 
affinity of other IGFBPs for insulin can be enhanced by modifications that 
disrupt disulfide bonds or remove the conserved COOH terminus. Like IGFBP-7, an 
NH2-terminal fragment of IGFBP-3 (IGFBP-3((1-87))), also binds insulin with high 
affinity and blocks insulin action. IGFBPs with enhanced affinity for insulin 
might contribute to the insulin resistance of pregnancy, type II diabetes 
mellitus, and other pathological conditions.
