The insulin/IGF-1 (where IGF-1 is insulin-like growth factor-1) signaling 
pathway influences longevity, reproduction, and diapause in many organisms. 
Because of the fundamental importance of this system in animal physiology, we 
asked when during the animal's life it is required to regulate these different 
processes. We find that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the pathway acts during 
adulthood, to relatively advanced ages, to influence aging. In contrast, it 
regulates diapause during development. In addition, the pathway controls 
longevity and reproduction independently of one another. Together our findings 
show that life-span regulation can be dissociated temporally from phenotypes 
that might seem to decrease the quality of life.
