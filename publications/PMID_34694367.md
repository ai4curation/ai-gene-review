The major spliceosome mediates pre-mRNA splicing by recognizing the highly 
conserved sequences at the 5' and 3' splice sites and the branch point. More 
than 150 proteins participate in the splicing process and are organized in the 
spliceosomal A, B, and C complexes. FRA10AC1 is a peripheral protein of the 
spliceosomal C complex and its ortholog in the green alga facilitates 
recognition or interaction with splice sites. We identified biallelic pathogenic 
variants in FRA10AC1 in five individuals from three consanguineous families. The 
two unrelated Patients 1 and 2 with loss-of-function variants showed 
developmental delay, intellectual disability, and no speech, while three 
siblings with the c.494_496delAAG (p.Glu165del) variant had borderline to mild 
intellectual disability. All patients had microcephaly, hypoplasia or agenesis 
of the corpus callosum, growth retardation, and craniofacial dysmorphism. 
FRA10AC1 transcripts and proteins were drastically reduced or absent in 
fibroblasts of Patients 1 and 2. In a heterologous expression system, the 
p.Glu165del variant impacts intrinsic stability of FRA10AC1 but does not affect 
its nuclear localization. By co-immunoprecipitation, we found ectopically 
expressed HA-FRA10AC1 in complex with endogenous DGCR14, another component of 
the spliceosomal C complex, while the splice factors CHERP, NKAP, RED, and SF3B2 
could not be co-immunoprecipitated. Using an in vitro splicing reporter assay, 
we did not obtain evidence for FRA10AC1 deficiency to suppress missplicing 
events caused by mutations in the highly conserved dinucleotides of 5' and 3' 
splice sites in an in vitro splicing assay in patient-derived fibroblasts. Our 
data highlight the importance of specific peripheral spliceosomal C complex 
proteins for neurodevelopment. It remains possible that FRA10AC1 may have other 
and/or additional cellular functions, such as coupling of transcription and 
splicing reactions.
