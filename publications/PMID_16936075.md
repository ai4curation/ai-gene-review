Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates the activation of the myogenic 
determination gene Myf5 at the onset of myogenesis, but the underlying molecular 
mechanism is unknown. Here, we report that the Wnt signal is transduced in 
muscle progenitor cells by at least two Frizzled (Fz) receptors (Fz1 and/or 
Fz6), through the canonical beta-catenin pathway, in the epaxial domain of newly 
formed somites. We show that Myf5 activation is dramatically reduced by blocking 
the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in somite progenitor cells, whereas expression of 
activated beta-catenin is sufficient to activate Myf5 in somites but not in the 
presomitic mesoderm. In addition, we identified Tcf/Lef sequences immediately 5' 
to the Myf5 early epaxial enhancer. These sites determine the correct 
spatiotemporal expression of Myf5 in the epaxial domain of the somite, mediating 
the synergistic action of the Wnt/beta-catenin and the Shh/Gli pathways. Taken 
together, these results demonstrate that Myf5 is a direct target of 
Wnt/beta-catenin, and that its full activation requires a cooperative 
interaction between the canonical Wnt and the Shh/Gli pathways in muscle 
progenitor cells.
