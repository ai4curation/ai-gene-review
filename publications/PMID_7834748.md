To extend the mammalian cell death pathway, we screened for further Bcl-2 
interacting proteins. Both yeast two-hybrid screening and lambda expression 
cloning identified a novel interacting protein, Bad, whose homology to Bcl-2 is 
limited to the BH1 and BH2 domains. Bad selectively dimerized with Bcl-xL as 
well as Bcl-2, but not with Bax, Bcl-xs, Mcl-1, A1, or itself. Bad binds more 
strongly to Bcl-xL than Bcl-2 in mammalian cells, and it reversed the death 
repressor activity of Bcl-xL, but not that of Bcl-2. When Bad dimerized with 
Bcl-xL, Bax was displaced and apoptosis was restored. When approximately half of 
Bax was heterodimerized, death was inhibited. The susceptibility of a cell to a 
death signal is determined by these competing dimerizations in which levels of 
Bad influence the effectiveness of Bcl-2 versus Bcl-xL in repressing death.
