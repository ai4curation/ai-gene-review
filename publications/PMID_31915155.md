Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, 
and in the advanced diabetic retinopathy appear vitreal fibrovascular membranes 
that consist of a variety of cells, including vascular endothelial cells (ECs). 
New therapeutic approaches for this diabetic complication are urgently needed. 
Here, we report that in cultured human retinal microvascular ECs, high glucose 
induced expression of p110δ, which was also expressed in ECs of fibrovascular 
membranes from patients with diabetes. This catalytic subunit of a 
receptor-regulated PI3K isoform δ is known to be highly enriched in leukocytes. 
Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that p110δ activity in 
cultured ECs controls Akt activation, cell proliferation, migration, and tube 
formation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth 
factor, and epidermal growth factor. Using a mouse model of oxygen-induced 
retinopathy, p110δ inactivation was found to attenuate pathological retinal 
angiogenesis. p110δ inhibitors have been approved for use in human B-cell 
malignancies. Our data suggest that antagonizing p110δ constitutes a previously 
unappreciated therapeutic opportunity for diabetic retinopathy.
