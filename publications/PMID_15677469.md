Mitosin/CENP-F is a human nuclear matrix protein with multiple leucine zipper 
motifs. Its accumulation in S-G2 phases and transient kinetochore localization 
in mitosis suggest a multifunctional protein for cell proliferation. Moreover, 
its murine and avian orthologs are implicated in myocyte differentiation. Here 
we report its interaction with activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4), a 
ubiquitous basic leucine zipper transcription factor important for 
proliferation, differentiation, and stress response. The C-terminal portion of 
mitosin between residues 2488 and 3113 bound to ATF4 through two distinct 
domains, one of which was a leucine zipper motif. Mitosin mutants containing 
these domains were able to either supershift or disrupt the ATF4-DNA complex. On 
the other hand, ATF4, but not ATF1-3 or ATF6, interacted with mitosin through a 
region containing the basic leucine zipper motif. Moreover, overexpression of 
full-length mitosin repressed the transactivation activity of ATF4 in dual 
luciferase-based reporter assays, while knocking down mitosin expression 
manifested the opposite effects. These findings suggest mitosin to be a negative 
regulator of ATF4 in interphase through direct interaction.
