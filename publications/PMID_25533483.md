Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. Functional 
interactions between some PD genes, like PINK1 and parkin, have been identified, 
but whether other ones interact remains elusive. Here we report an unexpected 
genetic interaction between two PD genes, VPS35 and EIF4G1. We provide evidence 
that EIF4G1 upregulation causes defects associated with protein misfolding. 
Expression of a sortilin protein rescues these defects, downstream of VPS35, 
suggesting a potential role for sortilins in PD. We also show interactions 
between VPS35, EIF4G1, and α-synuclein, a protein with a key role in PD. We 
extend our findings from yeast to an animal model and show that these 
interactions are conserved in neurons and in transgenic mice. Our studies reveal 
unexpected genetic and functional interactions between two seemingly unrelated 
PD genes and functionally connect them to α-synuclein pathobiology in yeast, 
worms, and mouse. Finally, we provide a resource of candidate PD genes for 
future interrogation.
