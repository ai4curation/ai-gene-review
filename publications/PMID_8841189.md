In 1960, progressive sensorineural deafness (McKusick 304,700, DFN-1) was shown 
to be X-linked based on a description of a large Norwegian pedigree. More 
recently, it was shown that this original DFN-1 family represented a new type of 
recessive neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by postlingual progressive 
sensorineural deafness as the first presenting symptom in early childhood, 
followed by progressive dystonia, spasticity, dysphagia, mental deterioration, 
paranoia and cortical blindness. This new disorder, termed Mohr-Tranebjaerg 
syndrome (referred to here as DFN-1/MTS) was mapped to the Xq21.3-Xq22 region2. 
Using positional information from a patient with a 21-kb deletion in chromosome 
Xq22 and sensorineural deafness along with dystonia, we characterized a novel 
transcript lying within the deletion as a candidate for this complex syndrome. 
We now report small deletions in this candidate gene in the original DFN-1/MTS 
family, and in a family with deafness, dystonia and mental deficiency but not 
blindness. This gene, named DDP (deafness/ dystonia peptide), shows high levels 
of expression in fetal and adult brain. The DDP protein demonstrates striking 
similarity to a predicted Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein of no known 
function. Thus, is it likely that the DDP gene encodes an evolutionarily 
conserved novel polypeptide necessary for normal human neurological development.
