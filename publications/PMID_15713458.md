The majority of known tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains consist of three 
copies of the helix-turn-helix TPR motif, together with a seventh C-terminal 
helix. TPR domains function as protein-protein recognition modules in 
intracellular signalling. This function is exemplified by the TPR domain of 
protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), which binds to the C terminus of the chaperone 
protein Hsp90. Here, we report NMR and CD spectroscopic studies that reveal that 
this domain is largely unfolded at physiological temperatures, and that 
interaction with an MEEVD pentapeptide derived from Hsp90 stabilises a folded 
structure. This complex, coupled folding-binding mechanism is characterised 
further by its observed enthalpy change on binding (determined by isothermal 
titration calorimetry), which displays a markedly non-linear relationship with 
temperature. A nested Gibbs-Helmholtz model is used in a novel combined analysis 
of the CD and ITC data to determine separately the thermodynamic contributions 
of the intrinsic folding and binding events to the overall coupled process. The 
analysis shows that, despite the expected large entropic opposition to the 
folding process, a nearly equal favourable folding enthalpy means the net effect 
of coupled folding on the observed affinity is small across a broad range of 
temperature. We hypothesise that a coupled folding-binding mechanism is common 
in this class of domains.
