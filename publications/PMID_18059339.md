Early growth response 3 (Egr3) is a member of a zinc-finger transcription factor 
subfamily, which we previously found to be strongly upregulated by vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in an oligonucleotide microarray screen of 
endothelial cells. Here, we show that Egr3 is the predominant Egr family member 
upregulated by VEGF in endothelial cells at 45 min, and that VEGF induced a 
rapid increase in Egr-dependent transcriptional activation mediated via its 
major signalling receptor, VEGFR2/KDR, and the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. 
VEGF-induced Egr3 gene expression was also mediated in part via a PKC-dependent 
activation of protein kinase D. Inhibition of Egr3 gene expression by RNA 
interference was effective in inhibiting basal and VEGF-induced Egr3 gene 
expression, and it also inhibited VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation, 
migration and tubulogenesis. These findings indicate that Egr3 has an essential 
downstream role in VEGF-mediated endothelial functions leading to angiogenesis 
and may have particular relevance for adult angiogenic processes involved in 
vascular repair and neovascular disease.
