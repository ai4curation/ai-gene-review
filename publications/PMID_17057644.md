A cell polarity complex consisting of partitioning defective 3 (PAR-3), atypical 
protein kinase C (aPKC) and PAR-6 has a central role in the development of cell 
polarity in epithelial cells. In vertebrate epithelial cells, this complex 
localizes to tight junctions. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of a 
distinct PAR protein complex in endothelial cells. Both PAR-3 and PAR-6 
associate directly with the adherens junction protein vascular endothelial 
cadherin (VE-cadherin). This association is direct and mediated through 
non-overlapping domains in VE-cadherin. PAR-3 and PAR-6 are recruited 
independently to cell-cell contacts. Surprisingly, the VE-cadherin-associated 
PAR protein complex lacks aPKC. Ectopic expression of VE-cadherin in epithelial 
cells affects tight junction formation. Our findings suggest that in endothelial 
cells, another PAR protein complex exists that localizes to adherens junctions 
and does not promote cellular polarization through aPKC activity. They also 
point to a direct role of a cadherin in the regulation of cell polarity in 
vertebrates.
