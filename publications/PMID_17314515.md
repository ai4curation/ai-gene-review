How the HIV1 Vpr protein initiates the host cell response leading to cell cycle 
arrest in G(2) has remained unknown. Here, we show that recruitment of 
DCAF1/VprBP by Vpr is essential for its cytostatic activity, which can be 
abolished either by single mutations of Vpr that impair DCAF1 binding, or by 
siRNA-mediated silencing of DCAF1. Furthermore, DCAF1 bridges Vpr to DDB1, a 
core subunit of Cul4 ubiquitin ligases. Altogether these results point to a 
mechanism where Vpr triggers G(2) arrest by hijacking the Cul4/DDB1(DCAF1) 
ubiquitin ligase. We further show that, Vpx, a non-cytostatic Vpr-related 
protein acquired by HIV2 and SIV, also binds DCAF1 through a conserved motif. 
Thus, Vpr from HIV1 and Vpx from SIV recruit DCAF1 with different physiological 
outcomes for the host cell. This in turn suggests that both proteins have 
evolved to preserve interaction with the same Cul4 ubiquitin ligase while 
diverging in the recognition of host substrates targeted for proteasomal 
degradation.
