The transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH may be resolved into at least two 
subcomplexes: the core TFIIH and the cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex. The 
CAK complex, which is also found free in the cell, is composed of cdk7, cyclin 
H, and MAT1. In the present work, we found that the C terminus of MAT1 binds to 
the cdk7 x cyclin H complex and activates the cdk7 kinase activity. The median 
portion of MAT1, which contains a coiled-coil motif, allows the binding of CAK 
to the TFIIH core through interactions with both XPD and XPB helicases. 
Furthermore, using recombinant TFIIH complexes, it is demonstrated that the 
N-terminal RING finger domain of MAT1 is crucial for transcription activation 
and participates to the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest 
subunit of the RNA polymerase II.
