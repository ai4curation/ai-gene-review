The mutator hypothesis of tumorigenesis suggests that loss of chromosomal 
stability or maintenance functions results in elevated mutation rates, leading 
to the accumulation of the numerous mutations required for multistep 
carcinogenesis. The human DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes are highly conserved 
homologues of the Escherichia coli MutHLS system, which contribute to genomic 
stability by surveillance and repair of replication misincorporation errors and 
exogenous DNA damage. Mutations in one of these MMR genes, hMSH2, account for 
about half of all cases of genetically linked hereditary non-polyposis 
colorectal cancer. Loss of function of p53 has also been proposed to increase 
cellular hypermutability, thereby accelerating carcinogenesis, although a clear 
role for p53 in genomic instability remains controversial. p53 is mutated 
frequently in a wide range of human cancers, including colonic tumours. Both 
Msh2- and p53-targeted knockout mice are viable and susceptible to cancer. Here 
we demonstrate that combined Msh2 and p53 ablation (Msh2-/-p53-/-) results in 
developmental arrest of all female embryos at 9.5 days. In contrast, male 
Msh2-/-p53-/- mice are viable, but succumb to tumours significantly earlier 
(t1-2 is 73 days) than either Msh2-/- or p53-/- littermates. Furthermore, the 
frequency of microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumours from Msh2-/-p53-/- mice 
is not significantly different than in Msh2-/- mice. Synergism in tumorigenesis 
and independent segregation of the MSI phenotype suggest that Msh2 and p53 are 
not genetically epistatic.
