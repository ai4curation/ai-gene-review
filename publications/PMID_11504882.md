The class II histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5 interact specifically with the 
myogenic MEF2 transcription factor and repress its activity. Here we show that 
HDAC4 is cytoplasmic during myoblast differentiation, but relocates to the 
nucleus once fusion has occurred. Inappropriate nuclear entry of HDAC4 following 
overexpression suppresses the myogenic programme as well as MEF2-dependent 
transcription. Activation of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin signalling pathway via 
constitutively active CaMKIV prevents nuclear entry of HDAC4 and HDAC4-mediated 
inhibition of differentiation. Consistent with a role of phosphorylation in 
HDAC4 cytoplasmic localisation, HDAC4 binds to 14-3-3 proteins in a 
phosphorylation-dependent manner. Together these data establish a role for HDAC4 
in muscle differentiation. Recently, HDAC5 has also been implicated in muscle 
differentiation. However, despite the functional similarities of HDAC4 and 
HDAC5, their intracellular localisations are opposed, suggesting a distinct role 
for these enzymes during muscle differentiation.
