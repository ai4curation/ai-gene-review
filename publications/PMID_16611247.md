Recently, we have identified human scribble (hScrib), human homolog of the 
Drosophila tumor suppressor Scribble, as a substrate of human papillomavirus E6 
oncoproteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation dependent on ubiquitin-protein 
ligase E6AP. Human Scribble, classified as a LAP protein containing leucine-rich 
repeats and PDZ domains, interacts with E6 through its PDZ domains and 
C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif of E6 protein. Interaction between human 
Discs Large (hDlg), which is a substrate of E6 for the ubiquitin-mediated 
degradation, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) has been shown. Here, we 
investigated whether hScrib and APC interact with each other in vitro and in 
vivo. Interaction between hScrib and APC is mediated by the PDZ domains 1 and 4 
of hScrib and C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif of APC. Human Scribble 
co-localized with APC at the synaptic sites of hippocampal neuron and at the tip 
of membrane protrusion in the epithelial cell line. Interference of the 
interaction between hScrib and APC caused disruption of adherens junction. 
Knockdown of hScrib expression by RNAi disrupts localization of APC at the 
adherens junction. These data suggest that hScrib may participate in the 
hDlg-APC complex through its PDZ domains and regulate cell cycle and neural 
function by associating with APC.
