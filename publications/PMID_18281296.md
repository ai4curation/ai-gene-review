Using an organelle proteomics approach, we previously studied the rat peroxisome 
in order to characterize the proteins participating in its biogenesis. A 
peroxisome-specific isoform of Lon (pLon) protein was accordingly identified. 
However, the precise role of pLon in peroxisomes remains to be elucidated. Here, 
we demonstrate that pLon plays a role in processing and activating a specific 
regulatory protein belonging to the peroxisome targeting signal (PTS) 
1-containing proteins. Proteomic analysis of proteins co-immunoprecipitated with 
Lon suggested that Lon interacts with PMP70 and several enzymes involved in 
beta-oxidation, including acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX). The processing of AOX for its 
activation in peroxisomes was strongly inhibited in cells expressing a dominant 
negative form of pLon. Furthermore, a catalase possessing a modified PTS1 
sequence was misdistributed in this cell line. pLon exhibits little, if any, in 
vitro AOX processing activity, and does not process PTS2-containing 
3-ketoacyl-coenzyme A thiolase (PTL). Therefore, pLon may specifically control, 
sort and process PTS1 proteins. Based on the relationship between pLon and the 
beta-oxidation enzymes that regulate peroxisomal morphology, the observation of 
enlarged peroxisomes in cells expressing recombinant pLon suggests that pLon is 
a critical factor determining peroxisome morphology.
