RNA polymerase (Pol) I-transcribed ribosomal genes of budding yeast exist as a 
tandem array (about 150 repeats) with transcription units separated by spacer 
sequences. Half of these rDNAs are inactivated by repressive chromatin 
structure, whereas the rest exist in an open conformation transcribed by closely 
spaced Pol I elongation complexes. Whereas previous studies have suggested that 
active rDNA is devoid of nucleosomal structure, we demonstrate that active rDNA 
has nucleosomal structure, according to chromatin immunoprecipitation and 
biochemical fractionation. Using a yeast strain with reduced numbers of all 
actively transcribed rDNA repeats, we show that rDNA exists in a dynamic 
chromatin structure of unphased nucleosomes. Furthermore, it is associated with 
chromatin-remodeling enzymes Chd1p, Isw1p and Isw2p, whose inactivation causes 
defects in transcription termination. We suggest that Pol I transcription, like 
that of Pol II, may be modulated by specific chromatin structures.
