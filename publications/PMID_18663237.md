In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) functions as a 
photoreceptor to entrain circadian oscillators to light-dark cycles and as a 
transcription factor to maintain circadian oscillator function in certain 
peripheral tissues. Given the importance of CRY to circadian clock function, we 
expected this protein to be expressed in all oscillator cells, yet CRY cellular 
distribution and subcellular localization has not been firmly established. Here 
we investigate CRY spatial expression in the brain using a newly developed CRY 
antibody and a novel set of cry deletion mutants. We find that CRY is expressed 
in s-LNvs, l-LNvs, and a subset of LNds and DN1s, but not DN2s and DN3s. CRY is 
present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of these neurons, and its 
subcellular localization does not change over the circadian cycle. Although CRY 
is absent in DN2s and DN3s, cry promoter activity and/or cry mRNA accumulation 
can be detected in these neurons, suggesting that CRY levels are regulated 
posttranscriptionally. Oscillators in DN2s and DN3s entrain to environmental 
light-dark cycles, which implies that they are entrained indirectly by retinal 
photoreceptors, extraretinal photoreceptors, or other CRY-expressing cells.
