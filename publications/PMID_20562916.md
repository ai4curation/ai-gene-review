Chemoresistance is a major cause of treatment failure and poor outcome in 
neuroblastoma. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of 
dual-specificity phosphatase 26 (DUSP26), also known as mitogen-activated 
protein kinase phophatase-8, in human neuroblastoma. We found that DUSP26 was 
expressed in a majority of neuroblastoma cell lines and tissue specimens. 
Importantly, we found that DUSP26 promotes the resistance of human neuroblastoma 
to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by acting as a p53 phosphatase to downregulate 
p53 tumor suppressor function in neuroblastoma cells. Inhibiting DUSP26 
expression in the IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell line enhanced doxorubicin-induced 
p53 phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser37, p21, Puma, Bax expression as well as 
apoptosis. In contrast, DUSP26 overexpression in the SK-N-SH cell line inhibited 
doxorubicin-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser37, p21, Puma, Bax 
expression and apoptosis. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that 
DUSP26 binds to p53 and dephosphorylates p53 at Ser20 and Ser37. In this report, 
we show that DUSP26 functions as a p53 phosphatase, which suppresses downstream 
p53 activity in response to genotoxic stress. This suggests that inhibition of 
this phosphatase may increase neuroblastoma chemosensitivity and DUSP26 is a 
novel therapeutic target for this aggressive pediatric malignancy.

Introduction

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children and is responsible for 15% of all cancer-related deaths within this population. Multidisciplinary therapeutic approaches including chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, radical tumor resections and radiation therapy have affected the outcomes in low-risk neuroblastoma. However, o20% of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma live past 5 years ( Brodeur, 2003 ). These high-risk patients are the most difficult to treat because of the highly resistant nature of these tumors. Many clinical trials are underway to target these therapy resistance pathways using small molecule inhibitors in hopes of increasing the efficacy of current treatment modalities.

The tumor suppressor p53 is a nuclear transcription factor that has a central role in the pathogenesis of human cancers ( Levine, 1997 ; Hupp et al. , 2000 ; Vogelstein et al. , 2000 ). The p53 protein is normally expressed at low levels in a latent form in the cytoplasm. Many stress signals and oncogenic changes activate p53 protein and lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptotic cell death. The regulation of p53 tumor suppressor activity is complex and includes posttranslational events such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Phosphorylation at several serine and threonine residues in p53 has been shown to occur after cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents and is critical for p53 to function as an effective tumor suppressor ( Kruse and Gu, 2009 ). Aberrant regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway has been suggested as an important mechanism of chemoresistance in neuroblastoma ( Tweddle et al ., 2003 ).

Available evidence suggests that neuroblastoma maintains functional p53; however, the downstream apoptotic mechanisms are suppressed in the majority of primary and relapsed cases ( Moll et al. , 1995 ; Goldman et al. , 1996 ; Chen et al. , 2007 ). More than 50% of all human cancers have p53 gene mutations or deletions ( Vousden and Lu, 2002 ). The p53 protein is mostly wild type (WT) in neuroblastoma, suggesting that inhibition of p53 tumor suppressor function contributes to chemoresistance, tumor metastasis and poor patient survival ( Moll et al , 1995 ; Tweddle et al. , 2001 ). Thus, the strategy of restoring p53 function represents an attractive therapeutic approach to this cancer ( Tweddle et al. , 2003 ).

Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are a subset of protein tyrosine phosphatases, many of which dephosphorylate serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues on mitogen-activated protein kinases, and hence are also referred to as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases. This group of phosphatases has been shown to have an important role in the regulation of intracellular signaling cascades governing cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis ( Jeffrey et al. , 2007 ; Patterson et al. , 2009 ). In some types of cancer cells, the expression level of a DUSP with oncogenic potential is elevated. For example, overexpression of the Cdc25 phosphatase in many tumors is associated with a poor prognosis ( Pestell et al. , 2000 ). In other cancers, a DUSP with tumor suppression potential is inactivated. For example, the DUSP6/mitogen-activated protein kinase phophatase-3 protein has been suggested to be a strong candidate tumor suppressor gene at 12q22 locus in pancreatic cancer ( Furukawa et al. , 2003 ). In our previous report, we cloned and identified DUSP26, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase phophatase-8, as a p38 phosphatase ( Vasudevan et al. , 2005 ). Moreover, recent studies suggest DUSP26 could promote cell survival of anaplastic thyroid cancer cells by inhibiting p38 kinase phosphorylation ( Yu et al. , 2007 ).

In this study, we examine the role of DUSP26 in the resistance of neuroblastoma cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. We provide experimental evidence that DUSP26 inhibits p53 tumor suppressor function by dephosphorylating p53 at Ser20 and Ser37 and contributes to the resistance of neuroblastoma cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.

Discussion

Neuroblastoma is a p53 WT tumor for which relapse with chemoresistant disease is the primay cause of death ( Brodeur, 2003 ). The mechanism for this chemoresistance in the presence of intact apoptotic machinery remains unclear. In this study, we examine the role of DUSP26 in promoting neuroblastoma chemoresistance. As has been shown with other important DUSPs, we present evidence that DUSP26 is overexpressed in neuroblastoma cell lines and in high-risk neuroblastoma tissue samples. The high-risk tissue samples represent patients with high-risk features such as age >1 year of age, MYCN amplification, poorly differentiated histopathologic characteristics and poor prognosis ( London et al. , 2005 ).

Our studies show that DUSP26 overexpression may be one of the mechanisms by which neuroblastoma develops chemoresistance. We found that overexpression of DUSP26 in a low DUSP26 expressing cell line increased cell viability in the setting of doxorubicin treatment by both cell viability assay and PARP cleavage. With DUSP26 inhibition with short hairpin RNA, the cells became more chemosensitive to doxorubicin treatment showing that p53 is essential for chemotherapy-related cell death in neuroblastoma. Doxorubicin-induced genotoxic stress is an accepted model of p53 transactivation and has been a mainstay of therapy for neuroblastoma for many years ( Lowe et al. , 1994 ; Matthay et al. , 1998 ).

In neuroblastoma, the p53 protein is most commonly in the WT form and is functional. p53 has an essential role in tumor suppression and in the cellular response to stress ( Toledo and Wahl, 2006 ). Phosphorylation of p53 protein is involved in the regulation of p53 protein stability and biochemical activities. Many serine residues within the N- and C-terminal regions of p53 are phosphorylated in response to stress conditions such as hypoxia and DNA damage ( Kruse and Gu, 2009 ). Both Ser20 and Ser37 phosphorylation on the p53 protein has been shown to have an important role in p53 stability and downstream apoptotic function ( Chehnab et al. , 1999 ; Unger et al. , 1999 ; Li et al. , 2006 ; Amano et al. , 2009 ).

Previously, human Cdc14 phosphatase has been reported to interact with and dephosphorylate p53 at Ser-315 while PPM1D dephosphorylates p53 at Ser15 without binding ( Li et al. , 2000 ; Lu et al. , 2005 ). The results from our in vitro phosphatase assays suggest that p53 Ser20 and Ser37 are specifically targeted by DUSP26 compared with Ser15. In addition, our DUSP26 knockdown and overexpression data further suggest that p53 Ser20 and Ser37 are targeted in vivo by DUSP26. These data indicate that phosphorylation of Ser20 and Ser37 facilitate p53 tumor suppressor function in neuroblastoma. Overexpression of DUSP26 in neuroblastoma results in physical binding and dephosphorylation of p53 in vivo which downregulates p53 tumor suppressor activity in neuroblastoma cells in response to doxorubicin. Interestingly, we found that doxorubincin and VP-16-induced p21 expression was partially inhibited by DUSP26-CS mutant ( Figure 3c , Supplementary Figure 3b ). One explanation is that DUSP26-CS mutant may still have residual phosphatase activity. However, we can not exclude the possibility that binding of DUSP26-CS mutant to p53 causes some level of inhibition. It is also possible that the physical interaction of DUSP26-p53 and the enzymatic activity of DUSP26 both have inhibitory effects on p53 phosphorylation.

Our data, in conjunction with previous studies, suggest a model in which genotoxic stress/DNA damage causes p53 induction and phosphorylation in neuroblastoma. DUSP26 binds to and dephosphorylates p53 at Ser 20 and Ser37 to inhibit p53 tumor suppressor function in neuroblastoma cells ( Figure 5 ). We suggest that overexpression of DUSP26 has an important role in the capacity of neuroblastoma cells to overcome the mechanisms that promote apoptosis and inhibit tumor progression.

Thus, overexpression of DUSP26 may be one of the mechanisms in neuroblastoma to escape doxorubincin-induced cell death and gain chemoresistence. Therefore, therapies designed to interfere with the DUSP26-p53 functional interaction would increase chemosensitivity by reactivating cellular apoptosis pathways to promote tumor cell death and better response to therapy.
