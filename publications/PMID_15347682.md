The first isoform of the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1) is of central 
importance for the control of cellular ion concentration and epithelium-mediated 
salt secretion. Several studies have established that a change in intracellular 
[Cl(-)] (Cl(-)(i)) represents a key signaling mechanism by which NKCC1-induced 
Cl(-) movement is autoregulated and by which Cl(-) entry and exit on opposite 
sides of polarized cells are coordinated. Although this signaling mechanism is 
coupled to a pathway that leads to post-translational modification of the 
carrier, no unifying model currently accounts for the ion dependence of NKCC1 
regulation. In this paper, evidence is presented for the first time that hsp90 
associates with the cytosolic C terminus of NKCC1, probably when the carrier is 
predominantly in its unfolded form during early biogenesis. Evidence is also 
presented that the Cl(-)(i)-dependent regulatory pathway can be activated by a 
thermal stress but that it is no longer operational if NKCC1-expressing cells 
are pretreated with geldanamycin, an antibiotic that inhibits hsp90, albeit 
nonspecifically. Taken together, our data indicate that binding of hsp90 to 
NKCC1 may be required for Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransport to occur at the cell 
surface and that it could play an important role in ion-dependent signaling 
mechanisms, insofar as the maneuvers that were used to alter the expression or 
activity of the chaperone do not exert their main effect by inducing other 
cellular events such as the unfolded protein response. Further studies will be 
required to elucidate the functional relevance of this novel interaction.
