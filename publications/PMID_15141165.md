In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, splicing of HAC1 mRNA is initiated in response to 
the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum by the 
transmembrane kinase-endoribonuclease Ire1p. Spliced Hac1p (Hac1ip) is a 
negative regulator of differentiation responses to nitrogen starvation, 
pseudohyphal growth, and meiosis. Here we show that the RPD3-SIN3 histone 
deacetylase complex (HDAC), its catalytic activity, recruitment of the HDAC to 
the promoters of early meiotic genes (EMGs) by Ume6p, and the Ume6p DNA-binding 
site URS1 in the promoters of EMGs are required for nitrogen-mediated negative 
regulation of EMGs and meiosis by Hac1ip. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments 
demonstrated that Hac1ip can interact with the HDAC in vivo. Systematic analysis 
of double deletion strains revealed that HAC1 is a peripheral component of the 
HDAC. In summary, nitrogen-induced synthesis of Hac1ip and association of Hac1ip 
with the HDAC are physiological events in the regulation of EMGs by nutrients. 
These data also define for the first time a gene class that is under negative 
control by the UPR, and provide the framework for a novel mechanism through 
which bZIP proteins repress transcription.
