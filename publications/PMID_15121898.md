hStaufen is the human homolog of dmStaufen, a double-stranded (ds)RNA-binding 
protein involved in early development of the fly. hStaufen-containing complexes 
were purified by affinity chromatography from human cells transfected with a 
TAP-tagged hStaufen gene. These complexes showed a size >10 MDa. Untagged 
complexes with similar size were identified from differentiated human 
neuroblasts. The identity of proteins present in purified hStaufen complexes was 
determined by mass spectrometry and the presence of these proteins and other 
functionally related ones was verified by western blot. Ribosomes and proteins 
involved in the control of protein synthesis (PABP1 and FMRP) were present in 
purified hStaufen complexes, as well as elements of the cytoskeleton (tubulins, 
tau, actin and internexin), cytoskeleton control proteins (IQGAP1, cdc42 and 
rac1) and motor proteins (dynein, kinesin and myosin). In addition, proteins 
normally found in the nucleus, like nucleolin and RNA helicase A, were also 
found associated with cytosolic hStaufen complexes. The co-localization of these 
components with hStaufen granules in the dendrites of differentiated 
neuroblasts, determined by confocal immunofluorescence, validated their 
association in living cells. These results support the notion that the 
hStaufen-containing granules are structures essential in the localization and 
regulated translation of human mRNAs in vivo.

Abstract

hStaufen is the human homolog of dmStaufen, a double-stranded (ds)RNA-binding protein involved in early development of the fly. hStaufen-containing complexes were purified by affinity chromatography from human cells transfected with a TAP-tagged hStaufen gene. These complexes showed a size >10 MDa. Untagged complexes with similar size were identified from differentiated human neuroblasts. The identity of proteins present in purified hStaufen complexes was determined by mass spectrometry and the presence of these proteins and other functionally related ones was verified by western blot. Ribosomes and proteins involved in the control of protein synthesis (PABP1 and FMRP) were present in purified hStaufen complexes, as well as elements of the cytoskeleton (tubulins, tau, actin and internexin), cytoskeleton control proteins (IQGAP1, cdc42 and rac1) and motor proteins (dynein, kinesin and myosin). In addition, proteins normally found in the nucleus, like nucleolin and RNA helicase A, were also found associated with cytosolic hStaufen complexes. The co-localization of these components with hStaufen granules in the dendrites of differentiated neuroblasts, determined by confocal immunofluorescence, validated their association in living cells. These results support the notion that the hStaufen-containing granules are structures essential in the localization and regulated translation of human mRNAs in vivo .

INTRODUCTION

Although sorting of proteins to specific points within the cell can be a post-translational process, their intracellular accumulation at specific sites is often accomplished by the previous localization of the corresponding mRNAs (reviewed in 1 – 5 ). The specific intracellular localization of certain proteins is a key event in many biological phenomena. One of the best known examples is determination of the antero-posterior axis during the early development of Drosophila melanogaster . Thus, the localization of oskar mRNA in the fly oocyte defines the location of the pole plasm at the posterior pole ( 6 ) and later the specific posterior expression of nanos in the embryo ( 7 ). Likewise, the localization of bicoid mRNA at the anterior pole determines the position of the head in the body plan ( 7 ). The specific localization of proteins is also essential in the definition of cell asymmetries in cell division and differentiation. prospero mRNA is localized in the basal area of fly mitotic neuroblasts and determines the fate of one daughter cell as the ganglion mother cell ( 8 , 9 ). Similarly, mating type switching of the daughter cell in yeast is determined by the specific accumulation of Ash1 mRNA at the budding tip. Ash1p inhibits the expression of HO endonuclease and stops the shift of mating type in the daughter cell ( 10 , 11 ). In addition to these biological processes, cell comunication events are also affected by the localization of specific mRNAs. Consequently, mRNA localization at the synapse has been suggested as a means to increase neuronal plasticity by local translation of specific proteins (reviewed in 4 , 12 , 13 ) and cell motility in a specific direction depends on the asymmetric localization of β-actin mRNA ( 14 ).

For it to be effective, mRNA localization has to be tightly coupled with translation at the site. Thus, several types of trans factors, some of which act in conjunction with the cis signals present in the messengers, are involved in confined protein expression via mRNA localization. (i) RNA-binding proteins that associate with specific mRNAs. Among them, there are proteins containing double-stranded (ds)RNA-binding domains, of which dmStaufen is the prototype ( 7 ); Zipcode-binding proteins like ZBP-1 ( 15 ) or Vera ( 16 ); some hnRNP components ( 17 ); a new type of RNA-binding protein that recognizes Ash1 mRNA ( 18 , 19 ). (ii) Motor proteins that associate with specific RNPs to transport them, like dynein ( 20 ) or kinesin ( 21 ). (iii) Adaptor proteins that interact with other elements in the mRNA RNPs and are essential for their transport, like barentsz and miranda ( 22 – 24 ). (iv) Cytoskeletal structures along which the specific RNPs move, like microtubules ( 25 ) or actin fibers ( 26 , 27 ). (v) Specific repressors of protein synthesis that prevent translation before the target mRNA is properly localized, like bruno activity on oskar mRNA translation ( 28 ).

dmStaufen is an RNA-binding protein crucial for the localization of specific mRNAs in fly early development. It is a member of a family of dsRNA-binding proteins that include PKR, RNase III, HIV TAR-binding protein and vaccinia E3L protein ( 7 , 29 ). These proteins contain several dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) whose structure has been determined ( 30 , 31 ). The interaction of dmStaufen with its cognate mRNAs in vivo involves the formation of large RNA granules in which both RNA–RNA and protein–RNA interactions are important ( 25 , 32 ). We and others have identified the human homolog of dmStaufen (hStaufen) ( 33 , 34 ). The various isoforms of hStaufen contain four dsRBDs homologous to dmStaufen but lack the sequences corresponding to the N-terminal half of the fly protein. hStaufen protein binds dsRNA in vitro without any sequence specificity and is localized in human cells in culture in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in association with polysomes ( 33 ). In contrast to dmStaufen, it contains a tubulin-binding domain ( 34 ) that may be involved in the transport of specific mRNAs along microtubules. In fact, the rat homolog of hStaufen localizes at the dendrites of neurons in culture and associates with RNA-containing granules that move in a microtubule-dependent manner ( 35 – 37 ). More recently, a second hStaufen homolog has been described that also localizes to the somato-dendritic domains in neurons and is associated with RNA-containing granules ( 38 – 40 ).

In this report we describe the purification of hStaufen-containing complexes isolated from cells expressing a tagged hStaufen gene and the characterization of untagged complexes in differentiated human neuroblasts in culture. The hStaufen-containing complexes contain ribosomes, proteins from the cytoskeleton, motor proteins and regulatory proteins, as well as other RNA-binding proteins normally localized to the nucleus. Altogether, the composition and size of these complexes is consistent with a role in the regulated transport and translation of mRNAs.

DISCUSSION

To investigate the possible roles of hStaufen protein in somatic human cells we set out to recover and characterize intracellular hStaufen-containing complexes. As a first step for this information-driven strategy we chose to express a TAP-tagged hStaufen protein in HEK293T human cells and use the tag as a handle to purify intracellular hStaufen complexes. The results presented in this report show that these complexes can be purified extensively, are very large in size and contain a recurrent set of associated proteins (Figs 1 and 2 ). They could also be purified from cells in which protein synthesis had been inhibited by puromycin treatment (data not shown). The relevance of these complexes containing tagged hStaufen for the normal situation in unaltered cells was verified in human differentiated neuroblasts. Endogenous complexes containing hStaufen with a size similar to that of complexes purified by affinity chromatography were detected in these cells (Fig. 2 ) and, moreover, most of the proteins identified in the latter (Fig. 3 ) were also present in large hStaufen-containing granules observed in dendrites of differentiated neuroblasts in vitro (Figs 5 – 9 ).
