Interactions of thrombospondin with extracellular matrix proteins: selective 
binding to type V collagen.

Mumby SM, Raugi GJ, Bornstein P.

Thrombospondin (TS), a protein first described in platelets, was recently shown 
to be synthesized and secreted by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth 
muscle cells. The presence of TS in the extracellular matrix of cultured cells 
has prompted us to examine the associations of this protein with matrix 
macromolecules. Interactions of TS with both matrix and serum proteins were 
tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. With this assay we assessed 
the binding of TS in solution to proteins adsorbed to polystyrene microtiter 
plates. Among collagens, platelet TS bound to type V but not to types I, III, or 
IV. This selective interaction was confirmed in experiments using proteins 
linked to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. TS released from platelets in 
response to thrombin activation, as well as that secreted by endothelial cells 
in culture, bound to type V but not to type I collagen-Sepharose. No binding was 
observed to denatured type V collagen-Sepharose. The binding region for type V 
collagen was located in a chymotrypsin-produced fragment of TS with chains of Mr 
= 70,000, after reduction. Interactions of TS with a number of other proteins, 
including fibronectin, fibrinogen, and laminin, could be demonstrated using the 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique but the interpretation of these 
findings is difficult since comparable binding to protein-Sepharose was not 
always observed. Our findings suggest that both the extravascular distribution 
and function of TS in vivo may involve an interaction with type V collagen.
