TRP channels have emerged as key biological sensors in vision, taste, olfaction, 
hearing, and touch. Despite their importance, virtually nothing is known about 
the folding and transport of TRP channels during biosynthesis. Here, we identify 
XPORT (exit protein of rhodopsin and TRP) as a critical chaperone for TRP and 
its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), rhodopsin (Rh1). XPORT is a resident ER 
and secretory pathway protein that interacts with TRP and Rh1, as well as with 
Hsp27 and Hsp90. XPORT promotes the targeting of TRP to the membrane in 
Drosophila S2 cells, a finding that provides a critical first step toward 
solving a longstanding problem in the successful heterologous expression of TRP. 
Mutations in xport result in defective transport of TRP and Rh1, leading to 
retinal degeneration. Our results identify XPORT as a molecular chaperone and 
provide a mechanistic link between TRP channels and their GPCRs during 
biosynthesis and transport.
