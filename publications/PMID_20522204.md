The protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene is expressed 
in hematopoietic tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells including natural 
killer (NK) cells. The rs2476601 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 
PTPN22 gene is an important susceptibility marker for autoimmunity but its role 
in NK cell biology is not yet clear. The aim of the current study was to 
evaluate in a cohort of healthy individuals, whether allelic variants of the 
rs2476601 SNP are associated with NK cell expansion in vitro. The CT genotype of 
the rs2476601 SNP was significantly (P = 0.0013) associated with reduced NK cell 
CD3(-) CD56(+) fraction in culture. The current study shows that the T variant 
of the rs2476601 SNP could alter NK vs T-cell balance in vitro and suggests that 
the PTPN22 gene might have an important immune regulatory role in NK cell 
function which needs further investigation.
