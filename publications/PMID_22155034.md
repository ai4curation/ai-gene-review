Despite the involvement of BMP-3b (also called GDF-10) in osteogenesis, 
embryogenesis and adipogenesis, the functional receptors and intracellular 
signaling of BMP-3b have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we 
investigated the cellular mechanism of BMP-3b in osteoblast differentiation 
using mouse myoblastic C2C12 cells. BMP-3b stimulated activin/TGF-β-responsive 
promoter activities. The stimulatory actions of BMP-3b on 
activin/TGF-β-responsive activities were suppressed by co-treatment with BMP-2. 
BMP-responsive promoter activities stimulated by BMP-2 were significantly 
inhibited by treatment with BMP-3b. BMP-3b suppressed the expression of 
osteoblastic markers including Runx2, osteocalcin and type-1 collagen induced by 
BMP-2, -4, -6 and -7. BMP-2-induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and mRNA levels of 
the BMP target gene Id-1 were suppressed by co-treatment with BMP-3b, although 
BMP-3b failed to activate Smad1/5/8 signaling. Of interest, the BMP-3b 
suppression of BMP-2-induced Id-1 expression was not observed in cells 
overexpressing Smad4 molecules. On the other hand, BMP-3b directly activated 
Smad2/3 phosphorylation and activin/TGF-β target gene PAI-1 mRNA expression, 
while BMP-2 suppressed BMP-3b-induced Smad2/3 signal activation. BMP-2 
inhibition of BMP-3b-induced PAI-1 expression was also reversed by 
overexpression of Smad4. Analysis using inhibitors for BMP-Smad1/5/8 pathways 
revealed that these BMP-3b effects were mediated via receptors other than ALK-2, 
-3 and -6. Furthermore, results of inhibitory studies using extracellular 
domains for BMP receptor constructs showed that the activity of BMP-3b was 
functionally facilitated by a combination of ALK-4 and ActRIIA. Collectively, 
BMP-3b plays an inhibitory role in the process of osteoblast differentiation, in 
which BMP-3b and BMP-2 are mutually antagonistic possibly by competing with the 
availability of Smad4.
