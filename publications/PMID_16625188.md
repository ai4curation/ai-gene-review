Hsp90 (heat shock protein of 90 kDa) is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone 
responsible for the assembly and regulation of many eukaryotic signalling 
systems and is an emerging target for rational chemotherapy of many cancers. 
Although the structures of isolated domains of Hsp90 have been determined, the 
arrangement and ATP-dependent dynamics of these in the full Hsp90 dimer have 
been elusive and contentious. Here we present the crystal structure of 
full-length yeast Hsp90 in complex with an ATP analogue and the co-chaperone 
p23/Sba1. The structure reveals the complex architecture of the 'closed' state 
of the Hsp90 chaperone, the extensive interactions between domains and between 
protein chains, the detailed conformational changes in the amino-terminal domain 
that accompany ATP binding, and the structural basis for stabilization of the 
closed state by p23/Sba1. Contrary to expectations, the closed Hsp90 would not 
enclose its client proteins but provides a bipartite binding surface whose 
formation and disruption are coupled to the chaperone ATPase cycle.
