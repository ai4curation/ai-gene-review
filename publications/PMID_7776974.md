The thyroid hormone (T3) receptors (TRs) are hormone-dependent transcription 
factors that regulate expression of a variety of specific target genes. To help 
elucidate the mechanisms that underlie this transcriptional regulation and other 
potential TR activities, we used the yeast interaction trap to isolate clones 
encoding proteins that specifically interact with the ligand binding domain of 
the rat TR beta. Several such proteins, called Trips (TR-interacting proteins), 
were isolated from independent selections carried out either in the presence or 
absence of T3. Surprisingly, all of the Trips were dependent on hormone for 
interaction with the TR, with some interacting only when T3 is present and 
others only when it is absent. Nearly all of the Trips also show similar 
ligand-dependent interaction with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), but none 
interact with the glucocorticoid receptor under any conditions. The sequences of 
three of the Trips predict specific functional roles: one is an apparent human 
homolog of a yeast transcriptional coactivator, one is a new member of a class 
of nonhistone chromosomal proteins, and one contains a conserved domain 
associated with ubiquitination of specific target proteins. Consistent with the 
pleiotropic effects of TR and RXR, several other Trips show significant amino 
acid sequence similarity with proteins involved in various regulatory pathways. 
The inherent transcriptional activity of the Trips was tested in yeast, and a 
chimeric protein consisting of a fusion of Trip4 to the bacterial LexA repressor 
protein is a relatively strong transcriptional activator. Similar LexA fusions 
to Trip9 and Trip10 had no transcriptional activity on their own but, when 
coexpressed with both TR and RXR, conferred T3-dependent activation to a 
reporter gene controlled by LexA binding sites. We suggest that this indirect T3 
response provides a novel mechanism for hormonal activation of gene expression, 
and that studies of the Trips will provide important insights into the specific 
mechanisms of action of TRs and other receptors.
