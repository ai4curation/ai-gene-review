The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded latency-associated 
nuclear antigen (LANA) is known to modulate viral and cellular gene expression. 
We show that LANA directly associates with an interleukin-6 signal transducer, 
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and that LANA 
enhances the transcriptional activity of STAT3. Coimmunoprecipitation studies 
documented a physical interaction between LANA and STAT3 in transiently 
transfected 293T cells as well as the KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma 
(PEL) cell line. Furthermore, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of LANA 
expression decreased the STAT3-dependent transcription in KSHV-positive PEL 
cells, whereas overexpression of LANA enhanced STAT3 activity in KSHV-negative B 
lymphoma cells. These data demonstrate that LANA is a transcriptional 
co-activator of STAT3, and may have implications for the pathogenesis of 
KSHV-associated diseases.
