Several genes encoding salivary components of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae 
were identified using a selective trapping approach. Among these, five 
corresponded to genes expressed specifically in female glands and their role may 
possibly be linked to blood-feeding. Our collection included a fourth member of 
the D7 protein family and two polypeptides that showed weak similarity to 
anti-coagulants from distantly related species. Moreover, we identified two 
additional members of a novel group of proteins that we named glandins. The 
isolation of tissue-specific genes represents a first step toward a deeper 
molecular analysis of mosquito salivary secretions.
