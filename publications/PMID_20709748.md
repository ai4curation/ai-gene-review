Ras and Rho small GTPases possessing a C-terminal polybasic region (PBR) are 
vital signaling proteins whose misregulation can lead to cancer. Signaling by 
these proteins depends on their ability to bind guanine nucleotides and their 
prenylation with a geranylgeranyl or farnesyl isoprenoid moiety and subsequent 
trafficking to cellular membranes. There is little previous evidence that 
cellular signals can restrain nonprenylated GTPases from entering the 
prenylation pathway, leading to the general belief that PBR-possessing GTPases 
are prenylated as soon as they are synthesized. Here, we present evidence that 
challenges this belief. We demonstrate that insertion of the dominant negative 
mutation to inhibit GDP/GTP exchange diminishes prenylation of Rap1A and RhoA, 
enhances prenylation of Rac1, and does not detectably alter prenylation of 
K-Ras. Our results indicate that the entrance and passage of these small GTPases 
through the prenylation pathway is regulated by two splice variants of SmgGDS, a 
protein that has been reported to promote GDP/GTP exchange by PBR-possessing 
GTPases and to be up-regulated in several forms of cancer. We show that the 
previously characterized 558-residue SmgGDS splice variant (SmgGDS-558) 
selectively associates with prenylated small GTPases and facilitates trafficking 
of Rap1A to the plasma membrane, whereas the less well characterized 607-residue 
SmgGDS splice variant (SmgGDS-607) associates with nonprenylated GTPases and 
regulates the entry of Rap1A, RhoA, and Rac1 into the prenylation pathway. These 
results indicate that guanine nucleotide exchange and interactions with SmgGDS 
splice variants can regulate the entrance and passage of PBR-possessing small 
GTPases through the prenylation pathway.
