Fragments of proteins containing an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract are 
thought to initiate aggregation and toxicity in at least nine neurodegenerative 
diseases, including Huntington's disease. Because proteasomes appear unable to 
digest the polyQ tract, which can initiate intracellular protein aggregation, 
preventing polyQ peptide aggregation by chaperones should greatly improve polyQ 
clearance and prevent aggregate formation. Here we expressed polyQ peptides in 
cells and show that their intracellular aggregation is prevented by DNAJB6 and 
DNAJB8, members of the DNAJ (Hsp40) chaperone family. In contrast, HSPA/Hsp70 
and DNAJB1, also members of the DNAJ chaperone family, did not prevent 
peptide-initiated aggregation. Intriguingly, DNAJB6 and DNAJB8 also affected the 
soluble levels of polyQ peptides, indicating that DNAJB6 and DNAJB8 inhibit 
polyQ peptide aggregation directly. Together with recent data showing that 
purified DNAJB6 can suppress fibrillation of polyQ peptides far more efficiently 
than polyQ expanded protein fragments in vitro, we conclude that the mechanism 
of DNAJB6 and DNAJB8 is suppression of polyQ protein aggregation by directly 
binding the polyQ tract.
