Bacteria, fungi and plants rescue aggregated proteins using a powerful 
bichaperone system composed of an Hsp70 chaperone and an Hsp100 AAA+ 
disaggregase. In Escherichia coli, the Hsp70 chaperone DnaK binds aggregates and 
targets the disaggregase ClpB to the substrate. ClpB hexamers use ATP to thread 
substrate polypeptides through the central pore, driving disaggregation. How 
ClpB finds DnaK and regulates threading remains unclear. To dissect the 
disaggregation mechanism, we separated these steps using primarily chimeric 
ClpB-ClpV constructs that directly recognize alternative substrates, thereby 
obviating DnaK involvement. We show that ClpB has low intrinsic disaggregation 
activity that is normally repressed by the ClpB middle (M) domain. In the 
presence of aggregate, DnaK directly binds M-domain motif 2, increasing ClpB 
ATPase activity to unleash high ClpB threading power. Our results uncover a new 
function for Hsp70: the coupling of substrate targeting to AAA+ chaperone 
activation at aggregate surfaces.
