Proper chromosome segregation requires the attachment of sister kinetochores to 
microtubules from opposite spindle poles to form bi-oriented chromosomes on the 
metaphase spindle. The chromosome passenger complex containing Survivin and the 
kinase Aurora B regulates this process from the centromeres. We report that a 
de-ubiquitinating enzyme, hFAM, regulates chromosome alignment and segregation 
by controlling both the dynamic association of Survivin with centromeres and the 
proper targeting of Survivin and Aurora B to centromeres. Survivin is 
ubiquitinated in mitosis through both Lys(48) and Lys(63) ubiquitin linkages. 
Lys(63) de-ubiquitination mediated by hFAM is required for the dissociation of 
Survivin from centromeres, whereas Lys(63) ubiquitination mediated by the 
ubiquitin binding protein Ufd1 is required for the association of Survivin with 
centromeres. Thus, ubiquitinaton regulates dynamic protein-protein interactions 
and chromosome segregation independently of protein degradation.
