The serine/threonine kinase protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt plays a central role in 
many cellular processes, including cell growth, glucose metabolism, and 
apoptosis. However, the identification and validation of novel regulators or 
effectors is key to future advances in understanding the multiple functions of 
PKB. Here we report the identification of a novel PKB binding protein, called 
Ft1, from a cDNA library screen using a green fluorescent protein-based 
protein-fragment complementation assay. We show that the Ft1 protein interacts 
directly with PKB, enhancing the phosphorylation of both of its regulatory sites 
by promoting its interaction with the upstream kinase PDK1. Further, the 
modulation of PKB activity by Ft1 has a strong effect on the apoptosis 
susceptibility of T lymphocytes treated with glucocorticoids. We demonstrate 
that this phenomenon occurs via a PDK1/PKB/GSK3/NF-ATc signaling cascade that 
controls the production of the proapoptotic hormone Fas ligand. The wide 
distribution of Ft1 in adult tissues suggests that it could be a general 
regulator of PKB activity in the control of differentiation, proliferation, and 
apoptosis in many cell types.
