Siah1 is the central component of a multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex 
that targets beta-catenin for destruction in response to p53 activation. The E3 
complex comprises, in addition to Siah1, Siah-interacting protein (SIP), the 
adaptor protein Skp1, and the F-box protein Ebi. Here we show that SIP engages 
Siah1 by means of two elements, both of which are required for mediating 
beta-catenin destruction in cells. An N-terminal dimerization domain of SIP sits 
across the saddle-shaped upper surface of Siah1, with two extended legs packing 
against the sides of Siah1 by means of a consensus PXAXVXP motif that is common 
to a family of Siah-binding proteins. The C-terminal domain of SIP, which binds 
to Skp1, protrudes from the lower surface of Siah1, and we propose that this 
surface provides the scaffold for bringing substrate and the E2 enzyme into 
apposition in the functional complex.
