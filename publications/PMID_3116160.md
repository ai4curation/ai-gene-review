The spoIIAC gene was cloned from chromosomal DNA of seven spoIIAC mutants of 
Bacillus subtilis, and the complete sequence of the gene was determined for each 
mutant. Three of the mutants proved to have chain-terminating mutations (one of 
which, previously shown to be suppressible by sup-3, was identified as amber); 
these led in every case to complete failure either to manufacture spores or to 
synthesize two enzymes normally associated with stage II of sporulation. The 
four remaining mutations were missense, and these corresponded to a phenotype in 
which a few spores are formed and about half the wild-type quantities of the two 
enzymes are made. Of the four missense mutations, two were near the 
promoter-distal end of the gene, in a region believed to correspond to the 
DNA-binding domain of the sigma factor that spoIIAC encodes. The remaining two 
mutations were in the region of the gene that is thought to correspond to the 
domain of the protein that interacts with core RNA polymerase.
