Protein interaction networks are becoming an increasingly important area of 
research within structural genomics. Here we present an ion mobility-mass 
spectrometry approach capable of distinguishing the overall subunit architecture 
of protein complexes. The approach relies on the simultaneous measurement in the 
gas phase of the mass and size of intact assemblies and subcomplexes. These data 
are then used as restraints to generate topological models of protein complexes. 
To test and develop our method, we have chosen two well-characterized 
homo-dodecameric protein complexes: ornithine carbamoyl transferase and 
glutamine synthetase. By forming subcomplexes related to the comparative 
strength of the subunit interfaces, acquiring ion mobility data, and subsequent 
modeling, we show that these "building blocks" retain their native interactions 
and do not undergo major rearrangement in either solution or gas phases. We 
apply this approach to study two subcomplexes of the human eukaryotic initiation 
factor 3, for which there is no high-resolution structure.
