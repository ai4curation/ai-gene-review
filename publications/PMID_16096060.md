The Wee1 kinase phosphorylates and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), 
thereby delaying entry into mitosis until appropriate conditions have been met. 
An understanding of the mechanisms that regulate Wee1 should provide new insight 
into how cells make the decision to enter mitosis. We report here that Swe1, the 
budding-yeast homolog of Wee1, is directly regulated by Cdk1. Phosphorylation of 
Swe1 by Cdk1 activates Swe1 and is required for formation of a stable Swe1-Cdk1 
complex that maintains Cdk1 in the inhibited state. Dephosphorylation of Cdk1 
leads to further phosphorylation of Swe1 and release of Cdk1. Thus, Cdk1 both 
positively and negatively regulates its own inhibitor. Regulation of the 
Swe1-Cdk1 complex is likely to play a critical role in controlling the 
transition into mitosis.
