BAI1 (brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1) was originally isolated as a 
p53-target gene specifically expressed in brain. To clarify its function, we 
have been searching for cellular proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic 
domain of BAI1. Using its intracellular carboxyl terminus as "bait" in a yeast 
two-hybrid system, we isolated a cDNA clone named BAIAP2 whose nucleotide 
sequence would encode a 521-amino acid protein showing significant homology to a 
58/53-kDa substrate of insulin-receptor kinase in the hamster. As the expression 
profile of BAIAP2 examined by Northern blot analysis was almost identical to 
that of BAI1, BAIAP2 appears to be active mainly in neurons. In vitro binding 
assays confirmed that a proline-rich cytoplasmic fragment of BAI1 interacted 
with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of BAIAP2. Double-color immunofluorescent 
analysis revealed that BAIAP2 was localized at the cytoplasmic membrane when it 
was coexpressed with BAI1 in COS-7 cells; BAIAP2 not associated with BAI1 was 
diffused in the cytoplasm. Predominant localization of BAI1 protein in a 
sub-cellular fraction enriched in growth cones indicated a possible role of BAI1 
as a cell adhesion molecule inducing growth cone guidance. As a protein partner 
of BAI1, BAIAP2 may represent an important link between membrane and 
cytoskeleton in the process of neuronal growth.
