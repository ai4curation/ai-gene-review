Abstract

The molecular mechanism and significance of endocytic processes involved in directional axon elongation are not well understood. The Unc-51 family of serine/threonine kinases was shown to be important for axon growth and was also linked to endocytosis, providing an entry point to study this problem. We found that mouse Unc-51-like kinase 1/2 (Ulk1/2) proteins are localized to vesicular structures in growth cones of mouse spinal sensory neurons. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Ulk1 and/or Ulk2 resulted in impaired endocytosis of nerve growth factor (NGF), excessive axon arborization, and severely stunted axon elongation. The evidence also indicates that Ulk1/2 mediates a non-clathrin-coated endocytosis in sensory growth cones. Interestingly, NGF can induce the interaction of Ulk1 with TrkA receptor complexes through promoting K63-polyubiquitination of Ulk1 and binding of Ulk1 to the scaffolding protein p62. These results and additional studies suggest that Ulk1/2 proteins regulate filopodia extension and neurite branching during sensory axon outgrowth, probably through regulating TrkA receptor trafficking and signaling.

Discussion

We demonstrated that Ulk1/2 proteins are required for efficient endocytosis of NGF and for suppressing excessive filopodia extension and axon branching in sensory neurons during NGF-induced axon outgrowth. How might Ulk1/2 exert their functions? In embryonic DRG neurons, it is known that NGF stimulates filopodia extension and the advancing growth cone by binding to TrkA receptors and activating various intracellular signaling pathways. In this study, we found that NGF also induces K63-polyubiquitination of Ulk1 (and perhaps Ulk2), where TRAF6 is a potential candidate for the E3 ligase. This K63-polyubiquitination allows the binding of Ulk1/2 to the p62 protein via its UBA-domain. The binding of p62 with activated TrkA recruits Ulk1/2 to the active TrkA complex. Previous work demonstrated that Ulk1/2 interacts with syntenin and SynGAP, proteins that regulate endocytosis ( 13 ). We propose that these interactions allow Ulk1/2 to traffic the NGF-bound TrkA receptors into an endocytic compartment that attenuates NGF signaling, thereby allowing filopodia to withdraw even in the continued presence of NGF. This model predicts that reducing the activities of Ulk1/2 will lead to prolonged TrkA signaling and impaired filopodia retraction, which is exactly what we observed in Ulk1/2 knockdown neurons, i.e., increased activation/phosphorylation of Akt and an excessive number of filopodia and axon branches. These data support the functional involvement of a phylogenetically conserved Ulk1/2-mediated endocytic pathway in modulating the signaling of neurotrophins in sensory neurons.

It was known that active TrkA receptors can also be endocytosed via CVV into signaling endosomes that continue to transduce the NGF signal in a retrograde manner back to cell bodies in DRG neurons ( 23 , 24 ). Recently, Pincher-mediated macroendocytosis of TrkA and the formation of multivesicular bodies were shown to be the primary pathway responsible for retrograde neurotrophin signaling in sympathetic neurons ( 25 ). Therefore, endocytosis per se does not necessarily result in termination of active TrkA signaling. It is interesting to note that Ulk1/2 puncta, presumably representing the Ulk1/2-associated endocytic vesicles, do not colocalize with clathrin in the growth cone ( Fig. 3 E and F ). Thus the segregation of Ulk1/2-mediated endocytosis from the clathrin-mediated pathway may allow sensory neurons to use the Ulk1/2 pathway for internalization of TrkA into signaling-inactive endosomes and either recycles the TrkA back to the cell surface or directs it to the degradation pathway, while using the clathrin pathway for the formation of retrograde signaling endosomes. Future work is needed to further characterize the molecular and cellular nature of the Ulk1/2â€“mediated endocytic pathway, as well as the fates of the Ulk1/2-mediated endocytosed vesicles and the internalized TrkA receptors (i.e., degraded or recycled). Suffice it to say, our study does highlight the importance of endocytic processes in regulating diverse signaling events during axon elongation and neuronal morphogenesis.
