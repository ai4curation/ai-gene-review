Membrane proteins reside in lipid bilayers and are typically extracted from this 
environment for study, which often compromises their integrity. In this work, we 
ejected intact assemblies from membranes, without chemical disruption, and used 
mass spectrometry to define their composition. From Escherichia coli outer 
membranes, we identified a chaperone-porin association and lipid interactions in 
the β-barrel assembly machinery. We observed efflux pumps bridging inner and 
outer membranes, and from inner membranes we identified a pentameric pore of 
TonB, as well as the protein-conducting channel SecYEG in association with F1FO 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase. Intact mitochondrial membranes from Bos 
taurus yielded respiratory complexes and fatty acid-bound dimers of the ADP 
(adenosine diphosphate)/ATP translocase (ANT-1). These results highlight the 
importance of native membrane environments for retaining small-molecule binding, 
subunit interactions, and associated chaperones of the membrane proteome.
