Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) balances organelle adaptation and 
elimination, and mechanistic crosstalk between the underlying molecular 
processes affects subsequent stress outcomes. FUNDC1 (FUN14 domain containing 1) 
is a mammalian mitophagy receptor that responds to hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) 
stress. Here, we provide evidence that FNDC-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of 
FUNDC1, and that its loss protects against injury in a worm model of HR. This 
protection depends upon ATFS-1, a transcription factor that is central to the 
mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Global mRNA and metabolite 
profiling suggest that atfs-1-dependent stress responses and metabolic 
remodeling occur in response to the loss of fndc-1. These data support a role 
for FNDC-1 in non-hypoxic MQC, and further suggest that these changes are 
prophylactic in relation to subsequent HR. Our results highlight functional 
coordination between mitochondrial adaptation and elimination that organizes 
stress responses and metabolic rewiring to protect against HR 
injury.Abbreviations: AL: autolysosome; AP: autophagosome; FUNDC1: FUN14 domain
