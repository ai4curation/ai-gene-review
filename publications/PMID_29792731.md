Impairment of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is considered a key 
contributor to the development of age-related macular degeneration. 
Apoptosis-related protein 3 (APR3) was recently discovered after treatment with 
all- trans retinoic acid, a pivotal molecule in RPE cells. However, the function 
of APR3 remains poorly understood. In the present study, we found that APR3 
could interact with nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, which is a 
regulator of phase II enzymes, and that knockdown of APR3 promoted nuclear 
factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 nuclear translocation and activated 
expression of phase II enzymes, which was accompanied by improved redox status 
and mitochondrial activity. Overexpression of APR3 revealed its mitochondrial 
localization and induced a robust production of reactive oxygen species that was 
accompanied by impaired mitochondrial oxygen consumption, complex activity, and 
lower ATP content, resulting in significant changes in mitochondrial structure, 
which may contribute to cell apoptosis. High doses of all- trans retinoic acid 
treatment were found to significantly induce APR3 expression, increase reactive 
oxygen species levels, and decrease ATP content, which were abolished by 
knockdown of APR3. These results indicate that APR3 plays a vital role in 
regulating redox status and mitochondrial activity and thus suggest APR3 might 
be a potential novel target for study of treatment of age-related macular 
degeneration.-Li, Y., Zou, X., Gao, J., Cao, K., Feng, Z., Liu, J. APR3
