Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (T Ag) interacts with the tumor
suppressor p53 and the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. Binding of
these cellular proteins in a ternary complex has been implicated in T
Ag-mediated transformation. It has been suggested that the ability of CBP/p300
to modulate p53 function underlies p53's regulation of cell proliferation and
tumorigenesis. In this study, we provide further evidence that CBP activity may
be mediated through its synergistic action with p53. We demonstrate that SV40 T
Ag is acetylated in vivo in a p53-dependent manner and T Ag acetylation is
largely mediated by CBP. The acetylation of T Ag is dependent on its interaction
with p53 and on p53's interaction with CBP. We have mapped the site of
acetylation on T Ag to the C-terminal lysine residue 697. This acetylation site
is conserved between the T antigens of the human polyomaviruses JC and BK, which
are also known to interact with p53. We show that both JC and BK T antigens are
also acetylated at corresponding sites in vivo. While other proteins are known
to be acetylated by CBP/p300, none are known to depend on p53 for acetylation. T
Ag acetylation may provide a regulatory mechanism for T Ag binding to a cellular
factor or play a role in another aspect of T Ag function.

Binding of these cellular proteins in a ternary complex has been implicated in T Ag-mediated transformation. It has been suggested that the ability of CBP/p300 to modulate p53 function underlies p53's regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we provide further evidence that CBP activity may be mediated through its synergistic action with p53. We demonstrate that SV40 T Ag is acetylated in vivo in a p53-dependent manner and T Ag acetylation is largely mediated by CBP. The acetylation of T Ag is dependent on its interaction with p53 and on p53's interaction with CBP. We have mapped the site of acetylation on T Ag to the C-terminal lysine residue 697. This acetylation site is conserved between the T antigens of the human polyomaviruses JC and BK, which are also known to interact with p53.

While other proteins are known to be acetylated by CBP/p300, none are known to depend on p53 for acetylation. T Ag acetylation may provide a regulatory mechanism for T Ag binding to a cellular factor or play a role in another aspect of T Ag function.

DISCUSSION

The posttranslational modification of histone and nonhistone proteins by acetylation is an important regulatory process that controls gene transcription. Due to its importance in governing cellular activities, many viruses seek to interfere with the acetylation pathway in order to regulate cellular and viral gene expression or gain some functional advantage. Some viruses encode proteins that can interact with cellular HATs and modulate their activity. One consequence of this interaction is that in some cases the viral protein itself can serve as a substrate for acetylation. For example, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat and Ad E1A can both be acetylated by cellular HATs. The acetylation of these viral proteins has various effects on different aspects of their function. For HIV-1 Tat, it can be acetylated by three different HATs on three specific lysine residues. Acetylation at each lysine results in a new functional property of Tat that is critical to the HIV-1 life cycle ( 8 ). Like several other viral proteins, SV40 T Ag interacts with the cellular HATs CBP and p300 and is thought to affect their acetyltransferase activity ( 38 ).

In this study, we demonstrate that SV40 T Ag is acetylated in vivo in a manner that depends on T Ag's ability to bind to p53. The dependence of T Ag acetylation on p53 binding suggests that one purpose of T Ag's binding to and stabilizing p53 is so that it can bind to CBP/p300 and get acetylated. Since the 22,23 mutant p53 that is deficient in binding to CBP cannot support T Ag acetylation, this provides evidence that CBP/p300 contributes to T Ag acetylation. This observation supports the model that p53 serves as a bridging protein, allowing T Ag and CBP/p300 to interact indirectly, as has been previously suggested ( 25 ). Interestingly, T Ag acetylation does not depend on p53 acetylation, although it does depend on T Ag binding to p53 and p53 binding to CBP/p300 (Fig. 2B and 5C ). While p53 itself is also acetylated by CBP/p300, it appears that p53 acetylation and T Ag acetylation are independent events and therefore probably serve distinct functions. This also suggests that p53 bound to T Ag need not be functionally active in order to promote binding to CBP/p300 and therefore T Ag acetylation. p53 may simply serve as a binding scaffold allowing T Ag access to the HAT activity of CBP/p300.

While most studies have illustrated the functional redundancy between p300 and CBP, some evidence suggests that p300 and CBP may have distinct roles in vivo. For example, there is a differential requirement for the PHD fingers (in the C/H2 region) of p300 and CBP in their acetyltransferase activities. While CBP requires an intact PHD finger motif to acetylate histones and p53, p300 does not ( 5 , 21 ). This suggests that structural differences between p300 and CBP may contribute to the specialized functions of the proteins. In this study, CBP appears to serve as the major contributor to T Ag acetylation (Fig. 4 ). However, even in the absence of CBP, T Ag acetylation is not completely abolished, as is the case in the absence of p53. The apparent decrease in T Ag acetylation in CBP −/− MEFs may reflect the preferred acetylation of T Ag specifically by CBP, with a small contribution by p300 or the upregulation of p300 activity in the absence of CBP. It is also possible that PCAF contributes to a small percentage of T Ag acetylation (<10%) that is not detectable through the elimination of PCAF alone (Fig. 4B ).

Simultaneous elimination of both CBP and p300, together or in combination with PCAF, would allow us to address this question and see if T Ag acetylation can be completely eliminated to a level comparable to that in p53 −/− MEFs. However, since CBP and p300 are both essential for cell growth and development, a double knockout of CBP and p300 is technically difficult due to its lethality in cells. A transient knockdown of p300 activity in CBP −/− MEFs, or vice versa, by RNA interference or small-molecule inhibitors may provide another approach to address this question. A similar approach could be used to more precisely determine the contribution, if any, of PCAF to T Ag acetylation.

We have mapped the site of acetylation on T Ag to the carboxyl-terminal lysine at position 697. From our experiments mutating the single lysine 697 to arginine, we were able to eliminate the acetylation of T Ag. This difference in acetylation between the mutant T antigens is not due to changes in protein stability or cellular localization, as acetylation mutant T antigens had a half-life indistinguishable from that of wt T Ag and all forms of T Ag localized to the nucleus (data not shown). We confirmed that lysine 697 is a site of T Ag acetylation by generation of a site-specific antibody. We cannot rule out the possibility, although it is unlikely from our studies, that other sites of acetylation exist on T Ag and that mutation of the site at K697 somehow alters T Ag to prevent it from being acetylated at other sites. If this is the case, each acetylation site on T Ag could result in a distinct effect on various aspects of T Ag function.

The conservation of the acetylation site lysine in SV40 T Ag among human polyomaviruses JC and BK large T antigens suggests that T Ag acetylation may serve a common purpose that is important to all of these viruses. While the Ac-K697 site-specific antibody strongly recognized SV40 T Ag, JC and BK T antigens reacted somewhat more weakly. This could be due to the slight sequence variation between SV40, JC, and BK T antigens in the region that the antibody recognizes or the decreased ability of JC and BK T antigens to bind p53 compared to that of SV40 T Ag (Fig. 7A ) ( 4 ). Interestingly, mouse polyomavirus large T Ag has also been reported to be acetylated, and it is thought that this modification contributes to the activation of replication at the polyomavirus origin ( 39 ). While the sites of polyomavirus T Ag acetylation were not mapped, polyomavirus T Ag shows no homology to the SV40 T Ag C-terminal domain. In addition, polyomavirus T Ag is acetylated by PCAF rather than by CBP/p300 ( 12 ). These differences, in addition to the fact that polyomavirus T Ag binds to CBP/p300 directly and does not bind to p53, suggest not only a different mechanism but also a distinct functional role for the acetylation of SV40 and polyomavirus T antigens.

The acetylation of viral proteins has been shown to affect many aspects of protein function, including cellular localization, protein stability, and protein-protein as well as protein-DNA interactions. There are numerous possible effects of T Ag acetylation on any of its functions. For example, the site of acetylation maps to the previously characterized carboxyl-terminal host range/Ad helper function (hr/hf) domain of SV40 T Ag ( 31 , 36 , 37 ). This host range phenotype, in addition to many other functions of T Ag, could be regulated by T Ag acetylation by either promotion or disruption of the association of cellular host factors with the C terminus of T Ag. T Ag acetylation could result in a functional advantage that is mediated by its interaction with cellular proteins.

One example of acetylation regulating the binding of cellular factors to a viral oncoprotein is found in adenovirus E1A. E1A is specifically acetylated on lysine 239, located in its C-terminal regulatory domain, by PCAF, GCN5, and CBP/p300. This region also interacts with the transcriptional corepressor CtBP, but acetylation of lysine 239 inhibits this interaction. This could help to increase the transforming potential of E1A by releasing the repressing function of CtBP. Similarly, acetylation of SV40 T Ag could regulate its interaction with some cellular corepressor or coactivator proteins. While we have found that the majority of T Ag (>60%) appears to be acetylated in vivo (data not shown), two distinct populations of T Ag, acetylated and unacetylated, may serve different purposes. Acetylation could affect T Ag's relationship with any of its known binding partners or it could be responsible for promoting or interfering with T Ag binding to a novel cellular factor. Further studies with our acetylation site mutant T Ags may be able to shed some light on this possibility by allowing us to compare proteins bound to acetylated and unacetylated forms of T Ag. In this way, T Ag acetylation may indirectly contribute to the transforming function or other functions of T Ag. Alternatively, the acetylation of T Ag may reflect its ability to modulate the function of the cellular proteins that it comes into contact with. T Ag clearly alters the HAT activity of CBP/p300 since it is able to redirect the acetyltransferase activity onto itself. In this way, T Ag may sequester CBP/p300's HAT activity by displacing it from its cellular functional complex and directing it to serve the virus's purpose. The conservation of T Ag acetylation among polyomaviruses likely indicates a common functional advantage of this modification of viral proteins.
