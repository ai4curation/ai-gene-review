Mitochondrial protein homeostasis is crucial for cellular function and integrity 
and is therefore maintained by several classes of proteins possessing chaperone 
and/or proteolytic activities. In the present study, we focused on 
characterization of LACE1 (lactation elevated 1) function in mitochondrial 
protein homeostasis. LACE1 is the human homologue of yeast mitochondrial Afg1 
(ATPase family gene 1) ATPase, a member of the SEC18-NSF, PAS1, CDC48-VCP, TBP 
family. Yeast Afg1 was shown to mediate degradation of mitochondrially encoded 
complex IV subunits, and, on the basis of its similarity to CDC48 (p97/VCP), it 
was suggested to facilitate extraction of polytopic membrane proteins. We show 
that LACE1, which is a mitochondrial integral membrane protein, exists as part 
of three complexes of approximately 140, 400 and 500 kDa and is essential for 
maintenance of fused mitochondrial reticulum and lamellar cristae morphology. We 
demonstrate that LACE1 mediates degradation of nuclear-encoded complex IV 
subunits COX4 (cytochrome c oxidase 4), COX5A and COX6A, and is required for 
normal activity of complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain. Using affinity 
purification of LACE1-FLAG expressed in a LACE1-knockdown background, we show 
that the protein interacts physically with COX4 and COX5A subunits of complex IV 
and with mitochondrial inner-membrane protease YME1L. Finally, we demonstrate by 
ectopic expression of both K142A Walker A and E214Q Walker B mutants, that an 
intact ATPase domain is essential for LACE1-mediated degradation of 
nuclear-encoded complex IV subunits. Thus the present study establishes LACE1 as 
a novel factor with a crucial role in mitochondrial protein homeostasis.
