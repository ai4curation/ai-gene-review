Mutations in SHR3 block amino acid uptake into yeast by reducing the levels of 
multiple amino acid permeases within the plasma membrane. SHR3 is a novel 
integral membrane protein component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). shr3 null 
mutants specifically accumulate amino acid permeases in the ER; other plasma 
membrane proteins, secretory proteins, and vacuolar proteins are processed and 
targeted correctly. Our findings suggest that SHR3 interacts with a structural 
domain shared by amino acid permeases, an interaction required for 
permease-specific processing and transport from the ER. Even in the presence of 
excess amino acids, shr3 mutants exhibit starvation responses. shr3 mutants 
constitutively express elevated levels of GCN4, and mutant shr3/shr3 diploids 
undergo dimorphic transitions that result in filamentous growth at enhanced 
frequencies.
