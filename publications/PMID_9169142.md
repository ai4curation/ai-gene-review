The Src-homology-3 domain (SH3) is an evolutionarily conserved, 50- to 
60-amino-acid module carried by intracellular proteins involved in the 
transduction of signals for cell polarization, motility, enzymatic activation, 
and transcriptional regulation. The SH3 drives protein-protein interactions 
through binding to proline-rich ligands. This function relies on the conserved 
secondary structure, whereas the SH3 primary structure is highly diverse. Taking 
advantage of the fact that the few conserved amino acids are clustered near the 
N- and C-terminal ends, we designed degenerate oligonucleotides spanning these 
two regions and screened by PCR a variety of normal and tumor tissues for the 
expression of SH3-containing transcripts. Using this strategy, we have 
identified a novel SH3-containing human gene family of six related transcripts 
that map to four different chromosomes. The SH3 domain lies at the C-terminal 
end and shows 56-50% amino acid homology to the C-terminal SH3 of 
Sem-5/Drk/GRB2. The N-terminal segment of this novel SH3GL (from SH3-containing 
Grb2-like) gene family does not resemble any known protein. Three of these 
transcripts are in-frame and show a peculiar tissue distribution: SH3GL2 is 
preferentially expressed in the brain, SH3GL3 in brain and testis, and SH3GL1 is 
ubiquitous.
