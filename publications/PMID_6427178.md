Replacement of the Bacillus subtilis subtilisin structural gene with an In 
vitro-derived deletion mutation.

Stahl ML, Ferrari E.

The entire subtilisin structural gene from Bacillus subtilis I168 has been 
cloned, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. When expressed on a 
high-copy-number shuttle vector, a fivefold increase in serine protease activity 
was observed. The DNA sequence of the gene is 80% homologous to the Bacillus 
amyloliquefaciens subtilisin structural gene, and the translated mature coding 
sequence is 85% homologous to the published protein sequence of subtilisin BPN'. 
The chloramphenicol resistance determinant of a plasmid integrated at the 
subtilisin locus was mapped by PBS1 transduction and was found to be linked to 
glyB (83%) and argC (60%), but not with metC or purB . The chromosomal locus 
containing the wild-type subtilisin allele was replaced with an in vitro-derived 
allele of the gene (delta apr-684) that contained a 684-base-pair deletion. The 
technique used for introducing the deletion is a variation of the gene 
replacement methods used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. When 
used in B. subtilis, deletion mutants could be directly screened among the 
transformants. Physiological characterization of the delta apr-684 mutation 
revealed no discernable effect on the formation of heat-resistant endospores, 
but strains carrying the mutation produced only 10% of wild-type serine protease 
activity. A model is presented that outlines the pathway for plasmid integration 
and deletion formation in B. subtilis.
