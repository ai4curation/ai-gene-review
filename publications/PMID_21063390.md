Proper attachment of microtubules to kinetochores is essential for accurate 
chromosome segregation. Here, we report a novel protein involved in 
kinetochore-microtubule attachment, chromosome alignment-maintaining 
phosphoprotein (CAMP) (C13orf8, ZNF828). CAMP is a zinc-finger protein 
containing three characteristic repeat motifs termed the WK, SPE, and FPE 
motifs. CAMP localizes to chromosomes and the spindle including kinetochores, 
and undergoes CDK1-dependent phosphorylation at multiple sites during mitosis. 
CAMP-depleted cells showed severe chromosome misalignment, which was associated 
with the poor resistance of K-fibres to the tension exerted upon establishment 
of sister kinetochore bi-orientation. We found that the FPE region, which is 
responsible for spindle and kinetochore localization, is essential for proper 
chromosome alignment. The C-terminal region containing the zinc-finger domains 
negatively regulates chromosome alignment, and phosphorylation in the FPE region 
counteracts this regulation. Kinetochore localization of CENP-E and CENP-F was 
affected by CAMP depletion, and by expressing CAMP mutants that cannot 
functionally rescue CAMP depletion, placing CENP-E and CENP-F as downstream 
effectors of CAMP. These data suggest that CAMP is required for maintaining 
kinetochore-microtubule attachment during bi-orientation.
