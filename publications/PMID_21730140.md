Individual cell types are defined by architecturally and functionally 
specialized cortical domains. The Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin (ERM) proteins play 
a major role in organizing cortical domains by assembling membrane protein 
complexes and linking them to the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Many studies have 
focused on the individual roles of the ERM proteins in stabilizing the 
membrane-cytoskeleton interface, controlling the distribution and function of 
apical membrane complexes, regulating the small GTPase Rho, or establishing 
cell-cell junctions. We previously found that deletion of the mouse Ezrin gene 
yields severe defects in apical integrity throughout the developing intestinal 
epithelium, resulting in incomplete villus morphogenesis and neonatal death. 
However, the molecular function of Ezrin in building the apical surface of the 
intestinal epithelium was not clear. By deleting Ezrin in the adult mouse 
intestinal epithelium, we provide evidence that Ezrin performs multiple 
molecular functions that collaborate to build the functional apical surface of 
the intestinal epithelium in vivo. The loss of Ezrin-mediated apical integrity 
in the adult intestine yields severe morphological consequences during 
intestinal homeostasis, including defects in cell geometry, extrusion, 
junctional remodeling, and spindle orientation. Surprisingly, deletion of Ezrin 
either before or after villus morphogenesis yields villus fusion, revealing a 
previously unrecognized step in intestinal homeostasis. Our studies indicate 
that the function of Ezrin in building and maintaining the apical domain is 
essential not only for intestinal morphogenesis but also for homeostasis in the 
mature intestine.

Abstract

Individual cell types are defined by architecturally and functionally specialized cortical domains. The Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin (ERM) proteins play a major role in organizing cortical domains by assembling membrane protein complexes and linking them to the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Many studies have focused on the individual roles of the ERM proteins in stabilizing the membrane–cytoskeleton interface, controlling the distribution and function of apical membrane complexes, regulating the small GTPase Rho, or establishing cell–cell junctions. We previously found that deletion of the mouse Ezrin gene yields severe defects in apical integrity throughout the developing intestinal epithelium, resulting in incomplete villus morphogenesis and neonatal death. However, the molecular function of Ezrin in building the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium was not clear. By deleting Ezrin in the adult mouse intestinal epithelium, we provide evidence that Ezrin performs multiple molecular functions that collaborate to build the functional apical surface of the intestinal epithelium in vivo. The loss of Ezrin-mediated apical integrity in the adult intestine yields severe morphological consequences during intestinal homeostasis, including defects in cell geometry, extrusion, junctional remodeling, and spindle orientation. Surprisingly, deletion of Ezrin either before or after villus morphogenesis yields villus fusion, revealing a previously unrecognized step in intestinal homeostasis. Our studies indicate that the function of Ezrin in building and maintaining the apical domain is essential not only for intestinal morphogenesis but also for homeostasis in the mature intestine.

Discussion

By bringing together multiple proteins at the membrane and linking them to the cytoskeleton, the ERMs seem designed to simultaneously coordinate several activities at the cell cortex. Studies of the ERMs across species have independently focused on their roles in stabilizing the membrane–cytoskeleton interface, regulating the small GTPase Rho, controlling membrane receptors, or stabilizing the AJR. Here, we provide evidence that the ERMs carry out all of these functions in the same tissue in vivo, supporting the notion that individual ERM molecules can simultaneously coordinate multiple activities. Moreover, we extend our previous discovery of the requirement for Ezrin in intestinal development and show that Ezrin function is also necessary for intestinal homeostasis in the adult. In fact, the phenotypic consequences of deleting Ezrin before villus morphogenesis (during development) vs . during villus maintenance (in the adult) are essentially identical, uncovering a previously unrecognized morphogenetic aspect of intestinal homeostasis. We also provide evidence that the intestinal epithelium is planar-polarized.

The ability of the ERMs to directly control both local cortical architecture and receptor distribution/activity renders them pivotal in creating cortical domains that define the functions of individual cells or tissues. Ezrin coordinates these molecular functions to build a contractile apical domain that also carries out the absorptive function of the intestinal epithelium. Conversely, the loss of apical integrity due to Ezrin deficiency reflects the concomitant loss of multiple molecular functions and profoundly impacts intestinal architecture, function, and homeostasis. On a cellular level, destabilization of the membrane–cytoskeleton interface and increased Rho-mediated actomyosin contractility likely cooperate to give rise to a BB that exhibits misoriented microvilli and is prone to herniation. Microvilli function to increase the absorptive surface area of the gut and present transporters to the intestinal lumen. Therefore, these defects may reflect the function of Ezrin both in stabilizing the membrane–cytoskeleton interface and in presenting and regulating critical transporters. Notably, recent studies indicate that microvilli can function as dynamic conveyor belts that continuously shed active enzyme-containing vesicles into the intestinal lumen, highlighting the importance of coordinating mechanically stable membrane–cytoskeleton attachment with the positioning and regulation of membrane protein complexes ( 44 ).

The intestinal epithelium is the most dynamic tissue in the adult body, replacing billions of cells every 4–5 d through an exquisitely choreographed program of cell division, migration, and extrusion ( 23 ). The interconnected BBs of intestinal epithelial cells provide a strong, flexible network that maintains the integrity of the epithelium while cells are in constant movement and under continuous mechanical stress. The apical surfaces of Ez −/− cells across the epithelium are narrow and do not expand at the crypt surface, consistent with the notion that they are constrained by excess Rho-mediated actomyosin contractility. Moreover, the extrusion of apoptotic cells from the colonic epithelium, which is driven by a transient relaxation of Rho-mediated contractility, is defective in the absence of Ezrin. These defects highlight the dynamic nature of Rho-mediated contractility that must govern these processes and suggest that the role of Ezrin in Rho regulation is also dynamic.

The most profound defect caused by loss of Ezrin in the adult is the development of fused villi. Surprisingly, this phenotypically mirrors the consequences of Ezrin deficiency in the developing intestine, a defect attributable to the failed expansion of secondary lumina that drive villus segregation specifically during development. However, careful consideration reveals that both of these defects may reflect failed segregation of cells due to defective junctional remodeling and are therefore likely to be directly related. In the adult, crypts significantly outnumber villi ( 23 ), and each crypt contributes to several surrounding villi. Therefore, the process of continuous villus repopulation must involve the segregation of adjacent cells at some point. In the Ez −/− intestine, adjacent cells appear unable to segregate and instead remain in contact as they ascend two different villi, resulting in villus fusion ( Fig. 4 J and Fig. S5 B ). This defect could be due to defective planar polarization of cell junctions. The segregation of adjacent cells before migration up separate villi implies that cell junctions aligned with the crypt–villus axis, but not those perpendicular to it, are programmed for segregation. Our observation that spindle orientation is planar-polarized in the wild-type but not in the Ez −/− intestine, together with morphological and biochemical differences in the AJR in the absence of Ezrin, support this hypothesis.

The mechanism by which Ezrin stabilizes the AJR may be indirect. Studies in Drosophila demonstrated that, through interaction with the membrane-tethered protein Bitesize (Btsz), Moesin organizes actin in a localized domain that is in turn required to stabilize E-cadherin ( 10 ). In btsz mutants, Moesin localization to the AJR is decreased and E-cadherin is not stabilized, as actin filaments fail to form a stable, continuous network that defines the boundary between the apical and junctional domains. Indeed, the elongated and disorganized appearance of cell–cell junctions in Ez −/− intestinal epithelia ( Fig. 5 B ) could reflect the lack of a properly defined apical–junctional boundary. However, although several mammalian homologs of Btsz exist, none contain the Moesin-interacting domain ( 10 ).

Our data uncover the complex molecular requirements for Ezrin in building the apical BB and the similarly complex biological requirements for the apical BB in intestinal epithelial homeostasis. This model will be valuable for a detailed biochemical interrogation of Ezrin-containing complexes in the intestinal epithelium and for deeper analyses of individual aspects of intestinal homeostasis.
