The interactions of the heterodimeric apolipoprotein and complement inhibitor, 
clusterin (CL, 80 kDa), with actively assembling terminal complement proteins 
were characterized. Clusterin inhibited at three sites and by two modes of 
action. Clusterin inhibited C9 assembly on C5b-8 and C5b-9 and also bound to 
C5b-7 to prevent membrane attachment. The impact on C5b-9 assembly was the most 
potent. C9 assembly was monitored by assembly-induced fluorescence changes of C9 
labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-C9). Assembly of monomeric FITC-C9 
with C5b-8 or C5b-9(1) produced a substantial decrease in fluorescence intensity 
due to changes in the environment of the probe. Addition of the next subunit of 
unlabeled C9 produced a further small change. One equivalent of FITC-C9 bound to 
C5b-8 at low temperatures, but the fluorescence change and addition of more C9 
did not occur until the temperaure was increased. Kinetic analysis of the 
fluorescence change suggested an irreversible, first-order process with an 
activation energy of 29 kcal/mol (k = 0.12 s(-1) at 25 degrees C). The kinetic 
properties differed for C9 addition to C5b-9(1) (0.27 s(-1) at 25 degrees C, 21 
kcal/mol), indicating that C9 activation occurred at a different or altered 
site. Clusterin binding to C5b-8-(FITC-C9)1 caused fluorescence quenching 
similar to that of unlabeled C9, indicating that it bound to the C9 binding 
site. Clusterin binding to C5b-8 and C5b-9(1) was reversible with affinities 
that were 2 and 15 times that of C9 for the C5b-8 and C5b-9(1) complexes, 
respectively. The results suggested that the presence of <10% of the circulating 
clusterin in its heterodimeric, active form could reduce the rate of complement 
cytolysis of nucleated cells by 10-fold, and under some conditions by 100-fold 
or more. This would provide a high level of protection for certain cells and may 
allow time for action by other inhibitors of complement.
