Ski-interacting protein (SKIP), a vitamin D receptor (VDR) coactivator, also 
functions as a repressor in Notch signalling in association with the corepressor 
SMRT. Here we show that SKIP bifunctionally modulates (activates or represses) 
Retinoid-X receptor (RXR)- and VDR-dependent gene transcription in a cell 
line-specific manner, with activation in CV-1 and repression in P19 cells. The 
coactivator function of SKIP in these cells appeared to correlate with the 
relative level and ratio of expression of N-CoR and p300, with greater SKIP 
activation in higher p300-expressing and lower N-CoR-expressing cell-lines. 
C-terminal deletion of SKIP (delta334-536 aa) was associated with strong 
activation in both CV-1 and P19 cells. The corepressors N-CoR and SMRT and the 
coregulator p300 interacted with SKIP through the same N-terminal region (1-200 
aa). Overall these results suggest that transcriptional action of SKIP may 
depend on distinct functional domains and cell line-specific interactions with 
both corepressors and coactivators.
