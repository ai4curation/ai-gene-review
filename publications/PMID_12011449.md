We previously cloned Siva-1 by using the cytoplasmic tail of CD27, a member of 
the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, as the bait in the yeast two-hybrid 
system. The Siva gene is organized into four exons that code for the predominant 
full-length Siva-1 transcript, whereas its alternate splice form, Siva-2, lacks 
exon 2 coding sequence. Various groups have demonstrated a role for Siva-1 in 
several apoptotic pathways. Interestingly, the proapoptotic properties of Siva-1 
are lacking in Siva-2. The fact that Siva-1 is partly localized to mitochondria 
despite the absence of any mitochondrial targeting signal, it harbors a 
20-aa-long putative amphipathic helical structure that is absent in Siva-2, and 
that its expression is restricted to double-positive (CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+)) 
thymocytes like BCL-X(L), prompted us to test for a potential interaction 
between Siva-1 and BCL-X(L). Here, we show that Siva-1 binds to and inhibits 
BCL-X(L)-mediated protection against UV radiation-induced apoptosis. Indeed, the 
unique amphipathic helical region (SAH) present in Siva-1 is required for its 
binding to BCL-X(L) and sensitizing cells to UV radiation. Natural complexes of 
Siva-1/BCL-X(L) are detected in HUT78 and murine thymocyte, suggesting a 
potential role for Siva-1 in regulating T cell homeostasis.
