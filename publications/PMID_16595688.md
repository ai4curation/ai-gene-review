The human PPIL1 (peptidyl prolyl isomerase-like protein 1) is a specific 
component of human 35 S U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle and 45 S 
activated spliceosome. It is recruited by SKIP, another essential component of 
45 S activated spliceosome, into spliceosome just before the catalytic step 1. 
It stably associates with SKIP, which also exists in 35 S and activated 
spliceosome as a nuclear matrix protein. We report here the solution structure 
of PPIL1 determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure of PPIL1 resembles other 
members of the cyclophilin family and exhibits PPIase activity. To investigate 
its interaction with SKIP in vitro, we identified the SKIP contact region by GST 
pulldown experiments and surface plasmon resonance. We provide direct evidence 
of PPIL1 stably associated with SKIP. The dissociation constant is 1.25 x 10(-7) 
M for the N-terminal peptide of SKIP-(59-129) with PPIL1. We also used chemical 
shift perturbation experiments to show the possible SKIP binding interface on 
PPIL1. These results illustrated that a novel cyclophilin-protein contact mode 
exists in the PPIL1-SKIP complex during activation of the spliceosome. The 
biological implication of this binding with spliceosome rearrangement during 
activation is discussed.
