The contractile actomyosin cytoskeleton and its connection to the plasma 
membrane are critical for control of cell shape and migration. We identify three 
STRIPAK complex components, FAM40A, FAM40B and STRN3, as regulators of the 
actomyosin cortex. We show that FAM40A negatively regulates the MST3 and MST4 
kinases, which promote the co-localization of the contractile actomyosin 
machinery with the Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin family proteins by phosphorylating the 
inhibitors of PPP1CB, PPP1R14A-D. Using computational modelling, in vitro cell 
migration assays and in vivo breast cancer metastasis assays we demonstrate that 
co-localization of contractile activity and actin-plasma membrane linkage 
reduces cell speed on planar surfaces, but favours migration in confined 
environments similar to those observed in vivo. We further show that FAM40B 
mutations found in human tumours uncouple it from PP2A and enable it to drive a 
contractile phenotype, which may underlie its role in human cancer.
