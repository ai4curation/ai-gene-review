Budding of transport vesicles in the Golgi apparatus requires the recruitment of 
coat proteins and is regulated by ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) 1. ARF1 
activation is promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which 
catalyze the transition to GTP-bound ARF1. We recently have identified a human 
protein, ARNO (ARF nucleotide-binding-site opener), as an ARF1-GEF that shares a 
conserved domain with the yeast Sec7 protein. We now describe a human Sec7 
domain-containing GEF referred to as ARNO3. ARNO and ARNO3, as well as a third 
GEF called cytohesin-1, form a family of highly related proteins with identical 
structural organization that consists of a central Sec7 domain and a 
carboxy-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. We show that all three proteins act 
as ARF1 GEF in vitro, whereas they have no effect on ARF6, an ARF protein 
implicated in the early endocytic pathway. Substrate specificity of ARNO-like 
GEFs for ARF1 depends solely on the Sec7 domain. Overexpression of ARNO3 in 
mammalian cells results in (i) fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, (ii) 
redistribution of Golgi resident proteins as well as the coat component 
beta-COP, and (iii) inhibition of SEAP transport (secreted form of alkaline 
phosphatase). In contrast, the distribution of endocytic markers is not 
affected. This study indicates that Sec7 domain-containing GEFs control 
intracellular membrane compartment structure and function through the regulation 
of specific ARF proteins in mammalian cells.
