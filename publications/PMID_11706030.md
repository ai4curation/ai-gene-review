ik3-1/Cables is associated with cdk3 in self-replicating cells. In postmitotic 
neurons, it may serve as an adaptor molecule, functionally connecting c-abl and 
cdk5, and supporting neurite growth. Here we report that ik3-1 binds to p53 and 
p73 in vivo. Ectopically expressed ik3-1 potentiates p53-induced cell death but 
not p73-induced cell death in U2OS cells. On the contrary, coexpression of 
ik3-1-DeltaC, an ik3-1 deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 139 [corrected] 
amino acids (corresponding to the cyclin box-homologous region), inhibits 
p73-induced cell death but not p53-induced cell death. ik3-1-DeltaC-mediated 
inhibition of p73-induced cell death are partially attenuated by overexpression 
of ik3-1. These data indicate that ik3-1 is not only a regulator for p53-induced 
cell death but also an essential regulator for p73-induced cell death, and 
ik3-1-DeltaC competes with ik3-1 only in p73-induced cell death. Furthermore, 
functional domains of p53 responsible for its interaction with ik3-1 are 
partially different from those of p73. In conclusion, we found that ik3-1, a 
putative component of cell cycle regulation, is functionally connected with p53 
and p73, but in distinct fashions.
