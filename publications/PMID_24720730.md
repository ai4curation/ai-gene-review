Fibrillar amyloid-β (Aβ) is the major constituent of senile plaques in the brain 
of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ is a short peptide generated from 
amyloid precursor protein with two main isoforms, Aβ40 and Aβ42, with the latter 
having two additional hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus. The two isoforms 
have distinct characteristics, in which Aβ42 plays a more pathogenic role. Some 
early-onset familial AD cases possess an elevated Aβ42/Aβ40 level, and 
biochemical studies show the two species interact with each other. Therefore, 
understanding structural conversion in the aggregation of mixed Aβ isoforms is 
essential for elucidating AD pathogenesis. Here, we systematically examined the 
differences between Aβ42, Aβ40 and various Aβ42/Aβ40 mixtures by monitoring the 
fibrillization kinetics, epitope changes, assembly, morphology and induced 
cytotoxicity. We found that the minor Aβ species in different mixing ratios 
modulated the major aggregation pathway. Size exclusion chromatography, circular 
dichroism spectroscopy and photo-crosslinking assay showed that soluble Aβ42 
oligomers were stabilized after Aβ40 addition, and the equimolar Aβ42/Aβ40 
mixture rapidly formed spherical oligomers. These oligomers were the most toxic 
among those examined as evidenced by neurite degeneration and neuronal toxicity. 
However, the oligomers were not responsible for intracellular calcium elevation. 
Overall, our results demonstrated that differently mixed Aβ species 
repartitioned oligomer intermediates on the major aggregation pathway. 
Furthermore, the equimolar mixture rapidly formed structurally stable and the 
most toxic oligomers. These results provided information on the potential 
pathological mechanisms underlying the elevated Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in familial AD 
patients and in the local environment of sporadic AD brains.
