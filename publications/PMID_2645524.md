A nuclear encoded mitochondrial heat-shock protein hsp60 is required for the 
assembly into oligomeric complexes of proteins imported into the mitochondrial 
matrix. hsp60 is a member of the 'chaperonin' class of protein factors, which 
include the Escherichia coli groEL protein and the Rubisco subunit-binding 
protein of chloroplasts.
