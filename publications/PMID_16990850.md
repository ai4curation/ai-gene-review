Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum triggers the 
unfolded protein response (UPR). How the UPR is downregulated is not well 
understood. Inositol requirement 1 (Ire1) is an endoplasmic reticulum 
transmembrane UPR sensor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When the UPR is triggered, 
Ire1 is autophosphorylated, on Ser 840 and Ser 841, inducing the cytosolic 
endonuclease activity of Ire1, thereby initiating the splicing and translational 
de-repression of HAC1 mRNA. Homologous to Atf/Creb1 (Hac1) activates UPR 
transcription. Here, we report that the dose-dependent cell-cycle regulator 2 
(Dcr2) phosphatase functionally and physically interacts with Ire1. We 
identified genetic interactions between DCR2 and genes, including IRE1, which 
are involved in secretory processes. Overexpression of DCR2, but not of a 
catalytically inactive DCR2 allele, significantly delays HAC1 splicing and 
sensitizes cells to the UPR. Furthermore, Dcr2 physically interacts in vivo with 
Ire1-S840E,S841E, which mimics phosphorylated Ire1, and Dcr2 de-phosphorylates 
Ire1 in vitro. Our results are consistent with de-phosphorylation of Ire1 being 
a mechanism for antagonizing UPR signalling.
