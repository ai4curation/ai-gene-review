Sec1p-like/Munc-18 (SM) proteins bind to t-SNAREs and inhibit ternary complex 
formation. Paradoxically, the absence of SM proteins does not result in 
constitutive membrane fusion. Here, we show that in yeast cells lacking the SM 
protein Vps45p, the t-SNARE Tlg2p is down-regulated, to undetectable levels, by 
rapid proteasomal degradation. In the absence of Vps45p, Tlg2p can be stabilized 
through abolition of proteasome activity. Surprisingly, the stabilized Tlg2p was 
targeted to the correct intracellular location. However, the stabilized Tlg2p is 
non-functional and unable to bind its cognate SNARE binding partners, Tlg1p and 
Vti1p, in the absence of Vps45p. A truncation mutant lacking the first 230 
residues of Tlg2p no longer bound Vps45p but was able to form complexes with 
Tlg1p and Vti1p in the absence of the SM protein. These data provide us with two 
valuable insights into the function of SM proteins. First, SM proteins act as 
chaperone-like molecules for their cognate t-SNAREs. Secondly, SM proteins play 
an essential role in the activation process allowing their cognate t-SNARE to 
participate in ternary complex formation.
