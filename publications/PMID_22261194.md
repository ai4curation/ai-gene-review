BACKGROUND: After myocardial ischemia, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition 
occurs at the site of the focal injury and at the border region.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We have applied a novel proteomic method for the analysis 
of ECM in cardiovascular tissues to a porcine model of ischemia/reperfusion 
injury. ECM proteins were sequentially extracted and identified by liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. For the first time, ECM proteins such 
as cartilage intermediate layer protein 1, matrilin-4, extracellular adipocyte 
enhancer binding protein 1, collagen α-1(XIV), and several members of the small 
leucine-rich proteoglycan family, including asporin and prolargin, were shown to 
contribute to cardiac remodeling. A comparison in 2 distinct cardiac regions 
(the focal injury in the left ventricle and the border region close to the 
occluded coronary artery) revealed a discordant regulation of protein and mRNA 
levels; although gene expression for selected ECM proteins was similar in both 
regions, the corresponding protein levels were much higher in the focal lesion. 
Further analysis based on >100 ECM proteins delineated a signature of early- and 
late-stage cardiac remodeling with transforming growth factor-β1 signaling at 
the center of the interaction network. Finally, novel cardiac ECM proteins 
identified by proteomics were validated in human left ventricular tissue 
acquired from ischemic cardiomyopathy patients at cardiac transplantation.
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a biosignature of early- and late-stage ECM 
remodeling after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, which may have clinical 
utility as a prognostic marker and modifiable target for drug discovery.
