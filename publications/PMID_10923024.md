We report here basic functional analysis of strains deleted for six open reading 
frames (ORFs), YNL059c and YNL148c from chromosome XIV and YOR145c, YOR152c, 
YOR161c and YOR162c from chromosome XV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ORFs were 
replaced with the KanMX4 resistance marker using a long flanking homology PCR 
strategy in FY1679 and W303 diploid strains. Replacement cassettes were 
constructed in plasmid pUG7 and the cognate wild-type genes were recovered by 
gap repair. Sporulation and tetrad analysis revealed that deletion of 
YNL059c/ARP5 was lethal for vegetative growth in strain W303 and caused severe 
growth defects in strain FY1679 while YOR145c was essential for growth in both 
strains. Fusion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene to the 3' ends of 
the YNL059c/ARP5 and YOR145c coding sequences created functional chimeric genes 
at the respective chromosomal loci. Both Arp5-GFP and Yor145-GFP localized to 
the nucleus, Yor145-GFP concentrating in the nucleolus. The vectors containing 
the deletion cassettes and the cognate wild-type genes, the oligonucleotides, 
and the deletant strains are available from the EUROFAN resource centre 
EUROSCARF (Frankfurt).
