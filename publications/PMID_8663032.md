The oncogene product Bcl-2 effectively spares cells from programmed cell death 
(apoptosis). The molecular mechanism underlying this death-protective activity 
has, however, remained enigmatic. Here we show that induction of Bcl-2 
expression is consistently associated with a retardation of mammalian cell 
proliferation due to a prolongation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Whereas 
cells lacking Bcl-2 expression die from any point of the cell cycle in response 
to apoptotic agents, Bcl-2-overexpressing cells accumulate in the G0/G1 phase 
and are protected from cell death. Co-expression of Bax, a negative regulator of 
Bcl-2, reverts both the cell death protective and proliferation retarding 
activities of Bcl-2. Moreover, a Bcl-2 mutant defective in death protection does 
not affect cell division. These findings indicate that Bcl-2 contributes to cell 
survival by diminishing the rate of cell proliferation.
