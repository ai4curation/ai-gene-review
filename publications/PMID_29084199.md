The molecular mechanisms underlying the interdependence between intracellular 
trafficking and epithelial cell polarity are poorly understood. Here we show 
that inactivation of class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (CIII-PI3K), 
which produces phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) on endosomes, 
disrupts epithelial organization. This is caused by dysregulation of endosomally 
localized Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1, also known as STK11), which shows delocalized 
and increased activity accompanied by dysplasia-like growth and invasive 
behaviour of cells provoked by JNK pathway activation. CIII-PI3K inactivation 
cooperates with RasV12 to promote tumour growth in vivo in an LKB1-dependent 
manner. Strikingly, co-depletion of LKB1 reverts these phenotypes and restores 
epithelial integrity. The endosomal, but not autophagic, function of CIII-PI3K 
controls polarity. We identify the CIII-PI3K effector, WD repeat and FYVE 
domain-containing 2 (WDFY2), as an LKB1 regulator in Drosophila tissues and 
human organoids. Thus, we define a CIII-PI3K-regulated endosomal signalling 
platform from which LKB1 directs epithelial polarity, the dysregulation of which 
endows LKB1 with tumour-promoting properties.
