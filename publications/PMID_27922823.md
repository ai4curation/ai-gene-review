In most eukaryotic cells mitochondria are essential organelles involved in a 
great variety of cellular functions. One of the physiological processes linked 
to mitochondria is aging, a gradual process of damage accumulation that 
eventually promotes cell death. Aging depends on a balance between mitochondrial 
biogenesis, function and degradation. It has been previously shown that Tor1, 
Sch9 and Ras2 are activated in response to nutrient availability and regulate 
cell growth and division. A deficiency in any of these genes promotes lifespan 
extension and cell protection during oxidative and heat shock stress. In this 
work we report that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the uncharacterized 
mitochondrial protein Slm35 is functionally linked with the TOR signaling 
pathway. A Δtor1Δslm35 strain shows a severe decrease in lifespan and is unable 
to contend with oxidative and heat shock stresses. Specifically, this mutant 
shows decreased catalase activity indicating a misregulation of ROS scavenging 
mechanisms. In this study we show that Slm35 is also relevant for mitochondrial 
network dynamics and mitophagy. The results presented here suggest that Slm35 
plays an important role connecting mitochondrial function with cytosolic 
responses and cell adaptation to stress and aging.
