Phosphorylation of histone H3 affects transcription, chromatin condensation, and 
chromosome segregation. However, the role of phosphorylation of histone H2A 
remains unclear. Here, we found that Arabidopsis thaliana MUT9P-LIKE-KINASE 
(MLK4) phosphorylates histone H2A on serine 95, a plant-specific modification in 
the histone core domain. Mutations in MLK4 caused late flowering under long-day 
conditions but no notable phenotype under short days. MLK4 interacts with 
CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), which allows MLK4 to bind to the GIGANTEA 
(GI) promoter. CCA1 interacts with YAF9a, a co-subunit of the Swi2/Snf2-related 
ATPase (SWR1) and NuA4 complexes, which are responsible for incorporating the 
histone variant H2A.Z into chromatin and histone H4 acetylase activity, 
respectively. Importantly, loss of MLK4 function led to delayed flowering by 
decreasing phosphorylation of H2A serine 95, along with attenuated accumulation 
of H2A.Z and the acetylation of H4 at GI, thus reducing GI expression. Together, 
our results provide insight into how phosphorylation of H2A serine 95 promotes 
flowering time and suggest that phosphorylation of H2A serine 95 modulated by 
MLK4 is required for the regulation of flowering time and is involved in 
deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z and H4 acetylation in Arabidopsis.

INTRODUCTION

Histone phosphorylation occurs on serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine residues at H3 and is generally associated with the regulation of transcription or entry into mitosis/meiosis. Phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10, serine 28, threonine 3, and threonine 11 is evolutionarily conserved in yeast, mammalian cells, and plants ( Cerutti and Casas-Mollano, 2009 ; Banerjee and Chakravarti, 2011 ; Rossetto et al., 2012 ). The phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 (H3S10ph) by MAP kinase signaling stimulates the acetylation of lysine 14 in H3, which in turn recruits Transcription Factor II D to activate gene expression ( Cheung et al., 2000 ; Lo et al., 2000 ; Hirota et al., 2005 ). H3 serine28 phosphorylation (H3S28ph), generated by MITOGEN- AND STRESS-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE1, not only prevents recruitment of the gene-silencing Polycomb-repressive complexes and their methylation of H3K27, but it also induces a switch from methylation to acetylation at H3K27 ( Lau and Cheung, 2011 ). In mammalian cells and plants, phosphorylation of H3 at threonine 3 (H3T3ph) generated by the mitosis-activated Haspin kinase functions in chromosome alignment and centromere cohesion ( Dai et al., 2005 ; Cerutti and Casas-Mollano, 2009 ). However, the phosphorylation of H3 at threonine 3 by the kinase MUT9p is associated with transcriptional silencing in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( Ivaldi et al., 2007 ).

In contrast to the phosphorylation of histone H3, the phosphorylation sites of histone H2A have not been well defined, and these modifications are usually associated with DNA damage. In yeast, phosphorylation of histone H2A at serine 129 by kinases Mec1 (Mitosis entry checkpoint protein 1) and Tel1 (Telomere length regulation protein 1) is required for efficient DNA double-strand break repair by nonhomologous end joining ( Rogakou et al., 1998 ; Downs et al., 2000 ). Phosphorylation of histone H2A at serine 129 enhances the recruitment of the INO80 complex to facilitate the repair of double-strand DNA breaks ( van Attikum et al., 2004 ). In mammalian cells, the Williams Syndrome Transcription Factor-SNF2H (Sucrose Non-Fermentable 2H) chromatin remodeling complex plays a vital role in the DNA damage response and phosphorylates tyrosine 142 of H2A.X ( Xiao et al., 2009 ). In addition to DNA damage, phosphorylation of H2A at serine 121 by Bub1 (Budding Uninhibited By Benzimidazoles 1) regulates the localization of shugoshin to prevent chromosomal instability ( Kawashima et al., 2010 ), and phosphorylation of histone H2A at tyrosine 56 by Casein Kinase II (CK2) regulates transcriptional elongation ( Basnet et al., 2014 ). In maize ( Zea mays ), the phosphorylation of H2A at threonine 133 is associated with centromere function and maintenance during meiosis ( Dong and Han, 2012 ).

Flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana is promoted by long summer days and is repressed by short winter days. The photoperiod pathway in the leaves controls this response via a signaling cascade involving GIGANTEA ( GI ) and the transcriptional regulator CONSTANS (CO) ( Fornara et al., 2010 ). CO is required to promote flowering under long-day ( LD ) but not short-day ( SD ) conditions ( Putterill et al., 1995 ). CO encodes a B-box-type zinc-finger transcription factor that directly activates the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) ( Yanovsky and Kay, 2002 ). The expression of CO is repressed by CYCLING DOF FACTOR1 and activated by FLAVIN BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1 and GI ( Imaizumi et al., 2005 ). The expression of CO and GI mRNAs is controlled by the circadian clock ( Fowler et al., 1999 ; Park et al., 1999 ; Suárez-López et al., 2001 ; Mizoguchi et al., 2002 ).

The Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase (SWR1) complex is an ATP-dependent complex required for deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z, whereas NuA4 is a histone acetylation complex that modifies H4, H2A, and H2A.Z in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Krogan et al., 2004 ). These two complexes share four subunits, Yaf9, Swc4, Arp4, and Act1, which function together to regulate chromatin structure and gene transcription ( Krogan et al., 2004 ; Zhang et al., 2004 ). Yaf9 is a YEAST domain protein, which is evolutionarily conserved in yeast, mammals, and plants. In yeast, the Yaf9 components of the SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are required for gene expression, H4 acetylation, and Htz1 replacement at specific genes ( Zhang et al., 2004 ; Wang et al., 2009 ; Altaf et al., 2010 ). There are two genes encoding Yaf9 in Arabidopsis: YAF9a ( TAF14b ) and YAF9b ( TAF14 ). The loss of YAF9a function results in early flowering in LD via reduced H4 acetylation at FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) and the promotion of acetylation at FT , whereas the phenotype is not obvious in SD ( Zacharaki et al., 2012 ).

Casein kinase I, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is a multifunctional protein kinase found in most eukaryotic cells. In mammalian cells, casein kinase I is involved in vesicular trafficking, DNA repair, the circadian rhythm, and morphogenesis ( McKay et al., 2001 ; Milne et al., 2001 ). In the alga Chlamydomonas, MUT9p, which is related to casein kinase I, is capable of phosphorylating H3 at threonine 3 ( Casas-Mollano et al., 2008 ). The Arabidopsis genome encodes four proteins (MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, and MLK4) related to MUT9p ( Cerutti and Casas-Mollano, 2009 ; Wang et al., 2015 ; Huang et al., 2016 ). These four proteins were copurified with the evening complex, which is composed of EARLY FLOWERING4 (ELF4), ELF3, and LUX ARRHYTHMO ( Huang et al., 2016 ). MLK1 and MLK2 also function as kinases to phosphorylate H3 at threonine 3, and the loss of MLK1 and MLK2 function results in hypersensitivity to osmotic stress ( Wang et al., 2015 ). In rice ( Oryza sativa ), EARLIER FLOWERING1 encodes a casein kinase I protein that phosphorylates the DELLA protein SLR1 ( Dai and Xue, 2010 ).

Histone modifications play critical roles in development, but the patterns of development differ dramatically between plants and animals. One fundamental outstanding question is how plant dialects of the histone modification code function in developmental regulation. In particular, H2A is more divergent than H3 and H4, and its modifications (especially phosphorylation) have been less well studied. Here, we report that MLK4 phosphorylates H2A at serine 95 (H2AS95ph), a plant-specific site, both in vitro and in vivo in Arabidopsis. MLK4 interacts with CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and targets GI directly. In addition, CCA1 binds to YAF9a, a co-subunit of the SWR1 and NuA4 complexes, which are responsible for incorporating the histone variant H2A.Z into chromatin and for histone H4 acetylase activity. The loss of MLK4 function results in late flowering, as well as a reduction in H2AS95ph, H2A.Z accumulation, H4 acetylation, and the expression of GI in LD conditions in Arabidopsis.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we identified a modification site in the histone core domain, the serine 95 of H2A, which is phosphorylated. Our data provide insights into the mechanism by which the histone-phosphorylating enzyme MLK4 affects photoperiod-dependent flowering time in Arabidopsis. MLK4 has H2A serine 95 phosphorylation activity in vitro and in vivo. The loss of MLK4 function results in late-flowering plants with reduced transcript and H2AS95ph levels of GI . The substitution of MLK4 lysine 174 with arginine led to a loss of H2A phosphorylation activity in vitro, and MLK4 K174R failed to rescue the late-flowering phenotype of mlk4 mutants, demonstrating that H2AS95ph is vital for flowering time. Taken together, these results suggest that MLK4 might be critical for H2AS95ph and the regulation of the downstream developmental processes in Arabidopsis. We observed MLK4 expression in roots and anthers, suggesting that MLK4 might also be involved in root and pollen development.

Our results indicate that MLK4 phosphorylates multiple sites on H2A, but prefers serine 95. The MLK4 activity on H2A containing serine-to-alanine substitutions at serine 95 was similar to its activity on H2A containing serine-to-alanine substitutions at 9, 17, 19, 20, 95, and 124, suggesting that serine 95 is the dominant site for MLK4 activity. However, MLK4 still had partial phosphorylation acidity when all serines in H2A were replaced with alanine, suggesting that MLK4 might phosphorylate other sites in H2A. We observed no notable changes of H2AS95ph in the wild type or the mlk4 mutants, suggesting that other kinases might phosphorylate serine 95 of H2A. MLK4 also has autophosphorylation activity, but whether this autophosphorylation activity affects its functions remains unclear. A recent study showed that MLK4 copurified with components of the evening complex of the circadian clock in a phytochrome B-dependent manner ( Huang et al., 2016 ), suggesting that MLK4 might phosphorylate the components of this complex, which may, in turn, regulate GI expression. CCA1 binds to GI and represses its expression ( Lu et al., 2012 ). Although mutations in CCA1 resulted in slightly early flowering, the cca1 mLk4 double mutant exhibited late flowering, suggesting that the appropriate flowering time requires both CCA1 and MLK4 .

Our results also provide insight into the specificity of MLK4 for its target gene. Most histone modification enzymes have not been observed to bind DNA, except for REF6 and MLL1, which contain a zinc finger domain and CXXC domain, respectively ( Cierpicki et al., 2010 ; Cui et al., 2016 ). The fundamental question of how these histone modification proteins target specific genes to carry out their functions remains to be explored. Our study showed that CCA1 physically interacts with MLK4 and allows MLK4 to target GI .

Although Arabidopsis MLK4 has a high amino acid sequence similarity to Chlamydomonas MUT9p, MLK4 targets H2AS95ph, whereas MUT9p has H3T3ph activity, although MUT9p has also been shown to have phosphorylation activity on H2A in vitro ( Casas-Mollano et al., 2008 ). Arabidopsis has four MLK proteins that are closely related to MUT9p. Phosphorylation activity on H3 threonine 3 was not observed for MLK1 or MLK2 in vitro; however, defects in mlk1 mLk2 result in the reduction of H3T3ph, indicating that MLK1 or MLK2 has H3T3ph activity in vivo ( Wang et al., 2015 ). The kinase functions of MUT9p may have diverged to produce new functions during the evolution of the land plants, leading to the separation of phosphorylation activity for H3T3 and H2AS95. The sequences of H3 and H4 are conserved among species, whereas the histone H2A and H2B sequences are diverse. Correspondingly, the phosphorylation sites at H2A are much more divergent than those of H3 between yeast, mammals, and plants. The phosphorylation of H2A at serine 129 in yeast and humans is correlated with DNA damage ( Rogakou et al., 1998 ); however, these conserved phosphorylation sites were not observed in Arabidopsis. The alignment of H2A sequences showed that serine 95 exists in plants, but not in yeast, fly, mouse, or mammalian cells, suggesting that the phosphorylation of H2A at serine 95 is specific to plants. This serine 95 of H2A was not observed in Chlamydomonas, suggesting this amino acid residue and MLK4 activity likely evolved de novo in the green algal and plant lineage. Unlike Chlamydomonas, the life cycle of land plants contains a vegetative stage and reproductive stage. Defective H2AS95 phosphorylation modulated by MLK4 resulted in late flowering, indicating that this histone phosphorylation site might promote the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive stage.

A loss of MLK4 function results in the reduced expression and H2AS95ph levels of GI , indicating that the level of H2AS95ph is correlated with the level of GI transcription. H3S10ph facilitates the release of RNA polymerase II from promoter-proximal pausing in Drosophila, while H3S28ph modulates RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription ( Ivaldi et al., 2007 ; Zhang et al., 2011 ). In our study, the reduced H2AS95ph caused by a loss of MLK4 function resulted in the downregulation of H2A.Z accumulation and H4 acetylation, which are involved in transcriptional activity. In yeast, histone variant H2A.Z is a component of euchromatin that functions to antagonize the opposite chromatin state and is selectively present at the vast majority of gene promoter regions ( Raisner et al., 2005 ). In contrast to yeast, H2A.Z binding levels are correlated with gene activity in humans ( Barski et al., 2007 ), but in plants, the presence of H2A.Z within genes is correlated with lower transcription levels and a higher variability in expression patterns across tissue types and environmental conditions ( Coleman-Derr and Zilberman, 2012 ). In yeast, the Swr1 complex is required for the deposition of histone H2A.Z at specific chromosome locations ( Mizuguchi et al., 2004 ). Arabidopsis contains the corresponding subunits of SWC2 and PHOTOPERIOD-INDEPENDENT EARLY FLOWERING1 (PIE1), which are the homologs of yeast Swc2 and Swr1, respectively. These subunits interact with three Arabidopsis homologs of H2A.Z proteins, HTA8, HTA9, and HTA11 ( Choi et al., 2007 ), indicating that the SWR1 complex is involved in H2A.Z deposition. The loss-of-function pie1 mutant flowers early because PIE1 is required for the deposition of H2A.Z at FLC , MAF4 , and MAF5 ( Deal et al., 2007 ). NuA4, the only essential histone acetyltransferase complex in S. cerevisiae , acetylates the N-terminal tails of histones H4 and H2A, which directly stimulates the incorporation of H2A.Z by the SWR1 complex ( Altaf et al., 2010 ). Yaf9 is a component of the NuA4 and SWR1 complexes, can bind histones H3 and H4 in vitro, and is required for histone variant H2A.Z deposition and for H2A.Z and H4 acetylation ( Zhang et al., 2004 ; Altaf et al., 2010 ). Our results show that Arabidopsis YAF9a is required for H4 acetylation and the deposition of H2A.Z at GI , indicating that Arabidopsis YAF9a might be the counterpart of yeast Yaf9 and that YAF9a is involved in chromatin and transcriptional regulation at GI . MLK4 and YAF9a form a protein complex. Defects in MLK4 might destroy this complex and thus result in the reduction of H2A.Z deposition and H4 acetylation, which indicates that H2AS95ph modulated by MLK4 might be involved in H4 acetylation and the deposition of H2A.Z. Mutations in MLK4 also resulted in enhanced H2A occupancy at the GI promoter; this might be antagonistic to H4 acetylation and H2A.Z deposition. Together, our results provide important insights into the mechanism by which MLK4-modulated H2AS95ph regulates flowering time and promotes gene transcription by enhancing H2A.Z accumulation and H4 acetylation in Arabidopsis.
