A new subunit of the human T-cell antigen receptor complex.

Weissman AM, Samelson LE, Klausner RD.

The T-cell antigen receptor binds antigen in association with a cell surface 
molecule encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC restricted 
recognition of antigen by this receptor leads to the complex pattern of 
programmed gene expression that characterizes T-cell activation. The eventual 
understanding of human T-cell function will require the complete elucidation of 
the structure of the human T-cell antigen receptor. On human T cells, clonally 
determined, disulphide-linked alpha and beta chains of the receptor are 
non-covalently and stoichiometrically associated with three additional 
polypeptides known as the T3 complex. These receptor subunits are glycoproteins 
of relative molecular mass (Mr) 25,000 (25K) and 20K (gamma and delta) and a 
non-glycosylated 20K protein (epsilon). Our studies of murine T cells show that 
the mouse T-cell antigen receptor consists of at least seven distinct 
polypeptide chains. In addition to clonotypic alpha and beta chains, the murine 
complex consists of glycoproteins of 26K and 21K and endoglycosaminidase F (endo 
F)-insensitive polypeptides of 25K, 21K and 16K. The latter, which we have 
termed zeta (zeta), exists as a homodimer within the complex. The 26K component 
(gp26) has been shown to be the murine analogue of the human delta chain. Other 
cross species homologies remain to be established, however none of the described 
human receptor components appear similar to the murine zeta polypeptide. We 
report here the use of an antiserum raised against the murine zeta subunit to 
identify a previously unrecognized component of the human T-cell antigen 
receptor. This human protein is T-cell specific and biochemically similar to the 
murine zeta polypeptide.
