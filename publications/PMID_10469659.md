Earlier work on the protein import system of yeast mitochondria has identified 
two soluble 70 kDa protein complexes in the intermembrane space. One complex 
contains the essential proteins Tim9p and Tim10p and mediates transport of 
cytosolically-made metabolite carrier proteins from the outer to the inner 
membrane. The other complex contains the non-essential proteins Tim8p and Tim13p 
as well as loosely associated Tim9p; its function was unclear, but it interacted 
structurally or functionally with the Tim9p-Tim10p complex. We now show that the 
two 70 kDa complexes each mediate the import of a different subset of integral 
inner membrane proteins and that they can transfer these proteins to one of 
three different membrane insertion sites: the TIM22 complex, the TIM23 complex 
or an as yet uncharacterized insertion site. Yeast mitochondria thus use 
multiple pathways for escorting hydrophobic inner membrane proteins across the 
aqueous intermembrane space.
