Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (50-90 nm in diameter) secreted by most 
hematopoietic cells. We provide here the first evidence for the presence of 
exosomes in vivo, in the blood. Plasma samples of all healthy donors tested (n = 
15) contain vesicles that are similar in shape, size and density to the 
previously described exosomes. They were clearly identified by electron 
microscopy after isolation by differential ultracentrifugation or 
immunoisolation with CD63-coated latex beads. We performed their biochemical 
characterization by western blot analysis and by flow cytometry after vesicle 
adsorption onto latex beads using a panel of mAbs. We observed that these 
plasma-derived vesicles contain tetraspanin molecules such as CD63, CD9, CD81 as 
well as class I and class II MHC molecules and Lamp-2 (i.e. proteins that are 
known to be enriched in exosomes). In addition, these vesicles float on sucrose 
gradient at a density similar to exosomes. Our results demonstrate that blood is 
a physiological fluid for exosome circulation in the body, suggesting their role 
in cell-cell or organ-organ communications as carriers for molecules that need 
to reach distant cell targets.
