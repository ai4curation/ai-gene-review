Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and the blood testis barrier.

Forrest JB, Turner TT, Howards SS.

The blood testis barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of testicular 
relapse of childhood acute leukemia by forming a "sanctuary site" for leukemic 
cells. Experiments were conducted to test the transport of carbon 14 
cyclophosphamide and tritiated vincristine across the blood testis barrier. Both 
cyclophosphamide and vincristine crossed the blood testis barrier. However, 
other factors such as the transport of immunoglobins and leukocytes across the 
blood testis barrier may interact in the pathogenesis of leukemic testicular 
relapse.
