Ever since their discovery as cellular counterparts of viral oncogenes more than 
25 years ago, much progress has been made in understanding the complex networks 
of signal transduction pathways activated by oncogenic Ras mutations in human 
cancers. The activity of Ras is regulated by nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 
and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), and much emphasis has been put into the 
biochemical and structural analysis of the Ras/GAP complex. The mechanisms by 
which GAPs catalyze Ras-GTP hydrolysis have been clarified and revealed that 
oncogenic Ras mutations confer resistance to GAPs and remain constitutively 
active. However, it is yet unclear how cells coordinate the large and divergent 
GAP protein family to promote Ras inactivation and ensure a certain biological 
response. Different domain arrangements in GAPs to create differential 
protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions are probably key factors 
determining the inactivation of the 3 Ras isoforms H-, K-, and N-Ras and their 
effector pathways. In recent years, in vitro as well as cell- and animal-based 
studies examining GAP activity, localization, interaction partners, and 
expression profiles have provided further insights into Ras inactivation and 
revealed characteristics of several GAPs to exert specific and distinct 
functions. This review aims to summarize knowledge on the cell biology of RasGAP 
proteins that potentially contributes to differential regulation of 
spatiotemporal Ras signaling.
