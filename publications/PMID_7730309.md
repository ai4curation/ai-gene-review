GTP cyclohydrolase I is the first and rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis 
of tetrahydrobiopterin in mammals. Previously, we reported three species of 
human GTP cyclohydrolase I cDNA in a human liver cDNA library (Togari, A., 
Ichinose, H., Matsumoto, S., Fujita, K., and Nagatsu, T. (1992) Biochem. 
Biophys. Res. Commun. 187, 359-365). Furthermore, very recently, we found that 
the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene is causative for hereditary progressive dystonia 
with marked diurnal fluctuation, also known as DOPA-responsive dystonia 
(Ichinose, H., Ohye, T., Takahashi, E., Seki, N., Hori, T., Segawa, M., Nomura, 
Y., Endo, K., Tanaka, H., Tsuji, S., Fujita, K., and Nagatsu, T. (1994) Nature 
Genetics 8, 236-242). To clarify the mechanisms that regulate transcription of 
the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene and to generate multiple species of mRNA, we 
isolated genomic DNA clones for the human and mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I genes. 
Structural analysis of the isolated clones revealed that the GTP cyclohydrolase 
I gene is encoded by a single copy gene and is composed of six exons spanning 
approximately 30 kilobases. We sequenced all exon/intron boundaries of the human 
and mouse genes. Structural analysis also demonstrated that the heterogeneity of 
GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA is caused by an alternative usage of the splicing 
acceptor site at the sixth exon. The transcription start site of the mouse GTP 
cyclohydrolase I gene and the 5'-flanking sequences of the mouse and human genes 
were determined. We performed regional mapping of the mouse gene by fluorescence 
in situ hybridization, and the mouse GTP cyclohydrolase I gene was assigned to 
region C2-3 of mouse chromosome 14. We identified missense mutations in patients 
with GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency and expressed mutated enzymes in 
Escherichia coli to confirm alterations in the enzyme activity.
