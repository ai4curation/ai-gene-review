Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) contributes importantly to the hydrolysis of 
cholesteryl ester in steroidogenic tissues, releasing the cholesterol required 
for adrenal steroidogenesis. HSL has broad substrate specificity, because it 
hydrolyzes triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols, and 
cholesteryl esters. In this study, we developed a specific cholesterol esterase 
assay using cholesterol oleate (CO) dispersed in phosphatidylcholine and gum 
arabic by sonication. To continuously monitor the hydrolysis of CO by HSL, we 
used the pH-stat technique. For the sake of comparison, the hydrolysis of CO 
dispersion was also tested using other cholesteryl ester-hydrolyzing enzymes. 
The specific activities measured on CO were found to be 18, 100, 27, and 3 
micromol/min/mg for HSL, cholesterol esterase from Pseudomonas species, Candida 
rugosa lipase-3, and cholesterol esterase from bovine pancreas, respectively. 
The activity of HSL on CO is approximately 4- to 5-fold higher than on 
long-chain TAGs. In contrast, with all other enzymes tested, the rates of TAG 
hydrolysis were higher than those of CO hydrolysis. The relatively higher 
turnover of HSL on CO observed in vitro adds further molecular insight on the 
physiological importance of HSL in cholesteryl ester catabolism in vivo. Thus, 
HSL could be considered more as a cholesteryl ester hydrolase than as a TAG 
lipase.
