At sites of inflammation, ligation of leukocyte integrins is critical for the 
activation of cellular effector functions required for host defense. However, 
the signaling pathways linking integrin ligation to cellular responses are 
poorly understood. Here we show that integrin signaling in neutrophils and 
macrophages requires adaptors containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based 
activation motifs (ITAMs). Neutrophils and macrophages lacking two 
ITAM-containing adaptor proteins, DAP12 and FcRgamma, were defective in 
integrin-mediated responses. Activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk by integrins 
required that DAP12 and FcRgamma were first phosphorylated by Src family 
kinases. Retroviral transduction of neutrophils and macrophages with wild-type 
and mutant Syk or DAP12 demonstrated that the Src homology 2 domains of Syk and 
the ITAM of DAP12 were required for integrin signaling. Our data show that 
integrin signaling for the activation of cellular responses in neutrophils and 
macrophages proceeds by an immunoreceptor-like mechanism.

Abstract

At sites of inflammation, ligation of leukocyte integrins is critical for the activation of cellular effector functions required for host defense. However, the signaling pathways linking integrin ligation to cellular responses are poorly understood. Here we show that integrin signaling in neutrophils and macrophages requires adaptors containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Neutrophils and macrophages lacking two ITAM-containing adaptor proteins, DAP12 and FcRγ, were defective in integrin-mediated responses. Activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk by integrins required that DAP12 and FcRγ were first phosphorylated by Src family kinases. Retroviral transduction of neutrophils and macrophages with wild-type and mutant Syk or DAP12 demonstrated that the Src homology 2 domains of Syk and the ITAM of DAP12 were required for integrin signaling. Our data show that integrin signaling for the activation of cellular responses in neutrophils and macrophages proceeds by an immunoreceptor-like mechanism.

DISCUSSION

Many studies have demonstrated the dependence on Src family and Syk tyrosine kinases in both integrin and immunoreceptor signaling pathways. With those observations in mind, we tested the hypothesis that similar signaling adaptors are needed to initiate both pathways. We found that the ITAM-containing molecules DAP12 and FcRγ were indispensable for β 2 integrin–mediated Syk activation and cellular responses in neutrophils and macrophages. Integrin-dependent functions that do not require Src family kinases or Syk, such as neutrophil migration, also did not require DAP12 or FcRγ. After integrin ligation, the ITAM-bearing adaptor molecules became phosphorylated by Src family kinases and associated with the SH2 domains of Syk. Structure-function analysis of neutrophils and macrophages suggested that integrin signaling requires the SH2 domains of Syk and the ITAM tyrosine residues of DAP12 (and probably FcRγ). These data have demonstrated that signal transduction by β 2 integrins follows the ITAM-based paradigm of immunoreceptor signaling. The unexpected similarity between proximal signaling by adhesion receptors and receptors of the adaptive immune system can be extended further downstream, as members of the Vav and SLP-76 families, originally thought to be involved mainly in lymphocyte antigen receptor signaling 24 , 25 , have been shown to be required for integrin signaling in neutrophils 19 , 26 , macrophages 27 , osteoclasts 28 and platelets 29 .

Our findings challenge the present view of integrin signal transduction, which is proposed to be unrelated to immunoreceptor-like signaling mechanisms. In particular, it has been concluded that the SH2 domains of Syk are not required for its activation by the platelet integrin α IIb β 3 heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells 13 . Although the reason for that apparent contradiction is unclear, it may result from differential signaling by β 2 and β 3 integrins or alternative signaling pathways used by the α IIb β 3 heterodimers when expressed in nonhematopoietic cells that do not express ITAM-containing adaptors. Related to that issue is the reported direct binding of Syk to the cytoplasmic tails of multiple integrin β-chains in a phosphorylated ITAM–independent way when expressed together in nonhematopoietic cells 14 , 15 . However, those observations do not exclude the possibility of a phosphorylated ITAM–dependent step in the integrin-mediated activation of Syk.

Both DAP12 and FcRγ associate with many cell surface receptors in various hematopoietic cell types 12 . The molecular basis of that association is the presence of opposing charged residues in the transmembrane segments of the molecules involved, allowing intra-membrane salt bridges to be formed between DAP12 or FcRγ and their associated receptors. Integrins lack such charged residues in their transmembrane segments. Furthermore, the surface expression of integrins was normal in DF double-knockout leukocytes, unlike that of most DAP12- or FcRγ-associated receptors. In addition, we were unable to demonstrate immunoprecipitation of DAP12 or FcRγ together with CD18 in adherent neutrophils. Therefore, integrins are unlikely to associate directly with DAP12 or FcRγ.

A more likely scenario is that DAP12- or FcRγ-associated receptors are functionally linked to integrins and participate in their signal transduction in an ITAM-dependent way. That hypothesis is also supported by preliminary experiments in which a DAP12 transmembrane ‘charge mutant’ unable to associate with known DAP12-associated receptors failed to restore integrin-dependent signaling to DAP12-deficient macrophages (C.L.A. and C.A.L., unpublished observations). Although reports have suggested that ITAM-containing Fc receptors and integrins may function cooperatively 17 , 30 , it is unlikely that the Fc receptors themselves couple ITAM-containing adaptors to the integrin signaling pathway, for several reasons. First, DF double-knockout cells have functional and signaling defects even in the absence of Fc receptor–ligating immunoglobulins; second, DAP12 is important in integrin-mediated responses even though it does not associate with Fc receptors; and third, TNF-induced responses of neutrophils plated on fibrinogen were normal in neutrophils lacking the FcRγ-associated receptors FcγRI and FcγRIII (Z.J. and A.M., unpublished observations). Given the many non–Fc receptor molecules identified that associate with and signal through DAP12 and FcRγ 12 , it is likely that DAP12- or FcRγ-associated molecules other than Fc receptors might be involved in integrin signaling of neutrophils and macrophages.

The association of integrins and ITAM-containing adaptors could be through interactions between amino acids outside the transmembrane domain, through interactions with other cell surface molecules, such as tetraspanins, which seem to regulate integrin signals in many cell types 31 , or through the association with lipid microdomains, although the last possibility has not been fully investigated in neutrophil signal transduction. Determining the molecular details of how β 2 integrins couple to DAP12 or FcRγ is an area for further research. Furthermore, it is unclear whether integrins discriminate between different ITAM-containing adaptors for signaling, as do immunoreceptors.

We have shown here that integrin signaling in neutrophils and macrophages uses an ITAM-based, immunoreceptor-like mechanism acting via the DAP12 and FcRγ adaptor molecules. Our findings fundamentally alter the present view of integrin ‘outside-in’ signal transduction in hematopoietic cells. They may also provide new insights into the pathogenesis of, and possible targets for the therapy of, infectious and inflammatory diseases.

Note added in proof : It has been independently confirmed that the SH2 domains of Syk are required for integrin signaling in neutrophils 32 .
