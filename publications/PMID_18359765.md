The acid stress chaperones HdeA and HdeB of Escherichia coli prevent the 
aggregation of periplasmic proteins at acidic pH. We show in this report that 
they also form mixed aggregates with proteins that have failed to be solubilized 
at acidic pH and allow their subsequent solubilization at neutral pH. HdeA, 
HdeB, and HdeA and HdeB together display an increasing efficiency for the 
solubilization of protein aggregates at pH 3. They are less efficient for the 
solubilization of aggregates at pH 2, whereas HdeB is the most efficient. 
Increasing amounts of periplasmic proteins draw increasing amounts of chaperone 
into pellets, suggesting that chaperones co-aggregate with their substrate 
proteins. We observed a decrease in the size of protein aggregates in the 
presence of HdeA and HdeB, from very high molecular mass aggregates to 
100-5000-kDa species. Moreover, a marked decrease in the exposed hydrophobicity 
of aggregated proteins in the presence of HdeA and HdeB was revealed by 
1,1'-bis(4-anilino)naphtalene-5,5'-disulfonic acid binding experiments. In vivo, 
during the recovery at neutral pH of acid stressed bacterial cells, HdeA and 
HdeB allow the solubilization and renaturation of protein aggregates, including 
those formed by the maltose receptor MalE, the oligopeptide receptor OppA, and 
the histidine receptor HisJ. Thus, HdeA and HdeB not only help to maintain 
proteins in a soluble state during acid treatment, as previously reported, but 
also assist, both in vitro and in vivo, in the solubilization at neutral pH of 
mixed protein-chaperone aggregates formed at acidic pH, by decreasing the size 
of protein aggregates and the exposed hydrophobicity of aggregated proteins.
