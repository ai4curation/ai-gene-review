During sporulation, sigma(G) becomes active in the prespore upon the completion 
of engulfment. We show that the inactivation of the sigma(F)-directed csfB locus 
resulted in premature activation of sigma(G). CsfB exerted control distinct from 
but overlapping with that exerted by LonA to prevent inappropriate sigma(G) 
activation. The artificial induction of csfB severely compromised spore 
formation.
