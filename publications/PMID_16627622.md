Sustained activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) both promote neuronal death. Here we 
identify a direct link between these two cell death pathways. In a rat model of 
hypoglycemic brain injury, neuronal PARP-1 activation and subsequent neuronal 
death were blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor 
2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (PD98059). In neuron cultures, 
PARP-1-mediated neuronal death induced by N-methyl-d-aspartate, peroxynitrite, 
or DNA alkylation was similarly blocked by ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors. These 
inhibitors also blocked PARP-1 activation and PARP-1-mediated death in 
astrocytes. siRNA down-regulation of ERK2 expression in astrocytes also blocked 
PARP-1 activation and cell death. Direct effects of ERK1/2 on PARP-1 were 
evaluated by using isolated recombinant enzymes. The activity of recombinant 
human PARP-1 was reduced by incubation with alkaline phosphatase and restored by 
incubation with active ERK1 or ERK2. Putative ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites on 
PARP-1 were identified by mass spectrometry. Using site-directed mutagenesis, 
these sites were replaced with alanine (S372A and T373A) to block 
phosphorylation, or with glutamate (S372E and T373E) to mimic constitutive 
phosphorylation. Transfection of PARP-1 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts 
with the mutant PARP-1 species showed that the S372A and T373A mutations 
impaired PARP-1 activation, whereas the S372E and T373E mutations increased 
PARP-1 activity and eliminated the effect of ERK1/2 inhibitors on PARP-1 
activation. These results suggest that PARP1 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 is 
required for maximal PARP-1 activation after DNA damage.

Abstract

Sustained activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) both promote neuronal death. Here we identify a direct link between these two cell death pathways. In a rat model of hypoglycemic brain injury, neuronal PARP-1 activation and subsequent neuronal death were blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (PD98059). In neuron cultures, PARP-1-mediated neuronal death induced by N -methyl- d -aspartate, peroxynitrite, or DNA alkylation was similarly blocked by ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors. These inhibitors also blocked PARP-1 activation and PARP-1-mediated death in astrocytes. siRNA down-regulation of ERK2 expression in astrocytes also blocked PARP-1 activation and cell death. Direct effects of ERK1/2 on PARP-1 were evaluated by using isolated recombinant enzymes. The activity of recombinant human PARP-1 was reduced by incubation with alkaline phosphatase and restored by incubation with active ERK1 or ERK2. Putative ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites on PARP-1 were identified by mass spectrometry. Using site-directed mutagenesis, these sites were replaced with alanine (S372A and T373A) to block phosphorylation, or with glutamate (S372E and T373E) to mimic constitutive phosphorylation. Transfection of PARP-1 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts with the mutant PARP-1 species showed that the S372A and T373A mutations impaired PARP-1 activation, whereas the S372E and T373E mutations increased PARP-1 activity and eliminated the effect of ERK1/2 inhibitors on PARP-1 activation. These results suggest that PARP1 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 is required for maximal PARP-1 activation after DNA damage.

Discussion

Inhibition of ERK1/2 can reduce neuronal death in several settings known to cause extensive PARP-1 activation ( 17 , 19 , 31 ). Here we show that ERK1/2 activation is required both for PARP-1 activation and for PARP-1-induced neuron and astrocyte death. In vivo , ERK1/2 inhibition during severe hypoglycemia blocked PAR formation and neuronal death under conditions in which the neuronal death is almost entirely PARP-1 dependent. In cultured cells, PARP-1-mediated death of neurons induced by MNNG, SIN-1, or NMDA was completely blocked by two chemically distinct inhibitors of the MEK1/2–ERK1/2 pathway. PARP-1-mediated death of astrocytes was also blocked by pharmacological ERK1/2 inhibition, and siRNA-mediated down-regulation of astrocyte ERK2 protein expression had a cytoprotective effect comparable with that of the pharmacological inhibitors. These studies are germane to the many prior reports that identify neuroprotective effects of ERK1/2 inhibition in ischemia and other conditions ( 22 ).

More direct evidence for ERK1/2 regulation of PARP-1 activity was provided by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry studies showing reduced PAR formation with either pharmacological ERK1/2 inhibition or siRNA down-regulation of ERK2 expression. A direct effect of both ERK1 and ERK2 on PARP-1 activity was confirmed by studies using recombinant enzymes. These studies showed that ERK1 and ERK2 can directly phosphorylate PARP-1 and increase PARP-1 activity relative to its dephosphorylated state. In addition, immunoprecipitation of activated PARP-1 from astrocytes showed an increase in phosphoserine content that was blocked by ERK1/2 inhibition. Last, amino acid substitutions at putative ERK2 phosphorylation sites on PARP-1 produced dramatic changes in PARP-1 activity.

Substitution of S372 and T373 with alanine to prevent phosphorylation generated PARP-1 species with reduced activation after DNA damage. This finding suggests that phosphorylation at these sites is needed for maximal PARP-1 activation; however, it is also possible that the reduced PARP-1 activity results from conformational changes induced by the amino acid substitutions. Stronger support for ERK1/2 phosphorylation at these sites is provided by the finding that replacing either of these residues with glutamate, to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, generated PARP-1 species that were no longer responsive to ERK1/2 inhibition. Of note, these residues are located near the beginning of the BRCT portion of the automodification domain, which is known to modulate PARP-1 activity and binding to DNA strand breaks ( 6 ). The S372E and T373E mutations also increased the basal level of PAR formation in transfected MEF cells. This increase may result from an amplified PARP-1 response to basal levels of DNA damage or, alternatively, may reflect an increase in PARP-1 activity that occurs independent of DNA damage ( 32 , 33 ).

Although ERK1 and ERK2 were both shown to phosphorylate and activate recombinant PARP-1, only ERK2 down-regulation led to reduced PAR formation and PARP-1-mediated cell death in the siRNA studies, despite a comparable, 70–75% reduction in both ERK1 and ERK2 protein expression. Similarly, ERK2, but not ERK1, produced detectable phosphorylation of PARP-1 when assessed by mass spectrometry. Prior studies have also suggested that ERK2 has a greater influence than ERK1 on cell survival under stress conditions ( 18 , 34 ). Our findings provide evidence for a direct interaction between ERK2 and PARP-1 but are not conclusive regarding interactions between ERK1 and PARP-1 in situ .

Regulation of PARP-1 activity by phosphorylation has been described. Aoufouchi and Shall ( 35 ) reported that activity of PARP-1 in developing Xenopus oocytes required phosphorylation of PARP-1 at serine residues. Although the kinase was not identified, ERK1/2 is a plausible candidate given that ERK1/2 exhibits sustained activation during the oocyte maturation process ( 36 ). Evidence also suggests that PARP-1 may be phosphorylated by protein kinase C, with a resultant down-regulation of PARP-1 activity by that modification ( 37 , 38 ). The present results suggest that ERK1/2 activation is a prerequisite for maximal PARP-1 activation after DNA damage. The ERK1/2 signaling pathway is itself activated during DNA damage, through a p53-independent mechanism ( 39 ). The ERK1/2 pathway can also be activated at multiple steps by reactive oxygen species ( 22 ). Whether ERK1/2 activation is always required for maximal PARP-1 activation remains uncertain, however, because PARP-1 activation is reported in settings that may not involve concomitant ERK1/2 activation ( 32 , 33 ). Our observation that recombinant human PARP-1 prepared in Escherichia coli is active, but loses activity when treated with alkaline phosphatase, indicates that kinases other than ERK1/2 (which are not expressed in bacteria) can activate PARP-1. PARP-1 purified from mammalian cells is generally active, suggesting that basal ERK1/2 activity is sufficient for measurable PARP-1 activity or that other pathways for PARP-1 regulation exist.

Hypoglycemia produces PARP-1-mediated neuronal death in selectively vulnerable neuron populations ( 4 ). Here we showed that hypoglycemia also produces neuronal ERK1/2 phosphorylation (activation). The MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation during hypoglycemia and also blocked PARP-1 activation and subsequent cell death in these neuronal populations. These findings, together with the cell culture and cell-free enzyme studies, suggest that the neuroprotective effects of ERK1/2 inhibition in hypoglycemia are largely attributable to reduced PARP-1 activation. Given that PARP-1 has a critical influence on neuronal survival in ischemia, excitotoxicity, inflammation, and many other conditions, ERK1/2 regulation of PARP-1 activity may be a common and important pathway by which the MEK1/2–ERK1/2 signal cascade influences neuronal survival.
