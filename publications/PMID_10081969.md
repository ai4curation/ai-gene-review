We report the cDNA sequence of human Fe65L2. The human Fe65L2 encoded 486 amino 
acids; the deduced amino acid sequence was shorter by 18 amino acids than the 
rat protein and had 86% identity to the rat protein Three protein-protein 
interaction domains, a WW and two PID/PTB elements, were conserved among the 
Fe65 protein family. Human Fe65L2 mRNA was expressed in various tissues; a 
transcript of about 2.2 kb was mainly expressed in the brain. A splicing variant 
lacking two amino acids in the first PID/PTB element was detected. We also 
confirmed that the carboxyl-terminal region of PID/PTB of the Fe65L2 interacted 
with the intracellular domain of the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) and APP-like proteins.
