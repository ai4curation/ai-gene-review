The fatty acid desaturase (FADS) genes code for the rate-limiting enzymes 
required for the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(LCPUFA). Here we report discovery and function of a novel FADS1 splice variant. 
FADS1 alternative transcript 1 (FADS1AT1) enhances desaturation of FADS2, 
leading to increased production of eicosanoid precursors, the first case of an 
isoform modulating the enzymatic activity encoded by another gene. Multiple 
protein isoforms were detected in primate liver, thymus, and brain. In human 
neuronal cells, their expression patterns are modulated by differentiation and 
result in alteration of cellular fatty acids. FADS1, but not FADS1AT1, localizes 
to endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Ribosomal footprinting demonstrates 
that all three FADS genes are translated at similar levels. The noncatalytic 
regulation of FADS2 desaturation by FADS1AT1 is a novel, plausible mechanism by 
which several phylogenetically conserved FADS isoforms may regulate LCPUFA 
biosynthesis in a manner specific to tissue, organelle, and developmental stage.
