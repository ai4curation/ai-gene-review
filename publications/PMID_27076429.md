The enteric nervous system (ENS) is organized into neural circuits within the 
gastrointestinal wall where it controls the peristaltic movements, secretion, 
and blood flow. Although proper gut function relies on the complex neuronal 
composition of the ENS, little is known about the transcriptional networks that 
regulate the diversification into different classes of enteric neurons and glia 
during development. Here we redefine the role of Ascl1 (Mash1), one of the few 
regulatory transcription factors described during ENS development. We show that 
enteric glia and all enteric neuronal subtypes appear to be derived from 
Ascl1-expressing progenitor cells. In the gut of Ascl1(-/-) mutant mice, 
neurogenesis is delayed and reduced, and posterior gliogenesis impaired. The 
ratio of neurons expressing Calbindin, TH, and VIP is selectively decreased 
while, for instance, 5-HT(+) neurons, which previously were believed to be 
Ascl1-dependent, are formed in normal numbers. Essentially the same 
differentiation defects are observed in Ascl1(KINgn2) transgenic mutants, where 
the proneural activity of Ngn2 replaces Ascl1, demonstrating that Ascl1 is 
required for the acquisition of specific enteric neuronal subtype features 
independent of its role in neurogenesis. In this study, we provide novel 
insights into the expression and function of Ascl1 in the differentiation 
process of specific neuronal subtypes during ENS development.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of 
different neuronal subtypes during development of the enteric nervous system are 
poorly understood despite its pivotal function in gut motility and involvement 
in gastrointestinal pathology. This report identifies novel roles for the 
transcription factor Ascl1 in enteric gliogenesis and neurogenesis. Moreover, 
independent of its proneurogenic activity, Ascl1 is required for the normal 
expression of specific enteric neuronal subtype characteristics. Distinct 
enteric neuronal subtypes are formed in a temporally defined order, and we 
observe that the early-born 5-HT(+) neurons are generated in Ascl1(-/-) mutants, 
despite the delayed neurogenesis. Enteric nervous system progenitor cells may 
therefore possess strong intrinsic control over their specification at the 
initial waves of neurogenesis.
