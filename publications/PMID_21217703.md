Repressor activator protein 1 (RAP1) is the most highly conserved telomere 
protein. It is involved in protecting chromosome ends in fission yeast and 
promoting gene silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas it represses 
homology-directed recombination at telomeres in mammals. To understand how RAP1 
has such diverse functions at telomeres, we solved the crystal or solution 
structures of the RAP1 C-terminal (RCT) domains of RAP1 from multiple organisms 
in complex with their respective protein-binding partners. Our analysis 
establishes RAP1(RCT) as an evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interaction 
module. In mammalian and fission yeast cells, this module interacts with TRF2 
and Taz1, respectively, targeting RAP1 to chromosome ends for telomere 
protection. In contrast, S. cerevisiae RAP1 uses its RCT domain to recruit Sir3 
to telomeres to mediate gene silencing. Together, our results show that, 
depending on the organism, the evolutionarily conserved RAP1 RCT motif has 
diverse functional roles at telomeres.
