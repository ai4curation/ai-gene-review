OBJECTIVE: IL-6-induced STAT3 activation is associated with various chronic 
inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-STAT3 mechanism 
of the dietary polyphenol, biochanin A (BCA), in IL-6-treated macrophages.
METHODS: The effect of BCA on STAT3 and p38 MAPK was analyzed by immunoblot. The 
localization of both these transcription factors was determined by 
immunofluorescence and fractionation studies. The impact on DNA-binding activity 
of STAT3 was studied by luciferase assay. To understand which of the isoforms of 
p38 MAPK was responsible for BCA-mediated regulation of STAT3, overexpression of 
the proteins, site-directed mutagenesis, pull-down assays and computational 
analysis were performed. Finally, adhesion-migration assays and 
semi-quantitative PCR were employed to understand the biological effects of 
BCA-mediated regulation of STAT3.
RESULTS: BCA prevented STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705) and increased p38 MAPK 
phosphorylation (Thr180/Tyr182) in IL-6-stimulated differentiated macrophages. 
This opposing modulatory effect of BCA was not observed in cells treated with 
other stress-inducing stimuli that activate p38 MAPK. BCA abrogated IL-6-induced 
nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT3 and its transcriptional activity, while 
increasing the cellular abundance of phospho-p38 MAPK. BCA-induced 
phosphorylation of p38δ, but not α, β, or γ was responsible for impeding 
IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, interaction with phospho-p38δ 
masked the Tyr705 residue of STAT3, preventing its phosphorylation. BCA 
significantly reduced STAT3-dependent expression of icam-1 and mcp-1 diminishing 
IL-6-mediated monocyte adhesion and migration.
CONCLUSION: This differential regulation of STAT3 and p38 MAPK in macrophages 
establishes a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of BCA which could be important 
for the prevention of IL-6-associated chronic inflammatory diseases.
