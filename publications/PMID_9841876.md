The action of oestrogen hormones is mediated through the oestrogen receptor 
(ER), a member of a large superfamily of nuclear receptors that function as 
ligand-activated transcription factors. Sequence-specific transcription factors, 
including the nuclear receptor superfamily, are thought to interact either 
directly or indirectly with general transcription factors to regulate 
transcription. Although numerous studies have focused on the identification of 
potential co-activators interacting with isolated trans-activation domains of 
ER, few have investigated the mechanisms by which ER transmits its signal to the 
basal transcription machinery. We show that ER does not stabilize the binding of 
the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) of the TFIID complex, or of TFIIB to the 
promoter, although a stable ER-TBP-TFIIB-promoter complex was detected, 
suggesting that ER, TBP and TFIIB might interact with each other to form a 
complex to the promoter. We also demonstrate that ER binds specifically to 
TFIIB, a key component of the preinitiation complex. Affinity chromatography 
with immobilized deletion mutants of ER maps a TFIIB interaction region that 
encompasses the DNA-binding domain. The addition of excess TFIIB to 
transcription reactions in vitro did not, however, affect the magnitude of 
transcriptional activation by ER. These results indicate that, in contrast with 
current models, ER does not activate transcription by increasing the rate of 
assembly of TFIIB into the transcription complex. An increased concentration of 
TFIIB was unable, by itself, to overcome the requirement for ER. By using an 
immobilized promoter-template assay employing nuclear extract from HeLa cells, 
recombinant human ER increased the stable association of subsequent components 
of the transcription machinery (TFIIE and TFIIF), in correlation with ER-induced 
transcription. Our results suggest that ER acts, in an early step, during or 
immediately after the formation of template-committed complexes containing 
TFIIB, favouring the recruitment of one or more components of the basic 
transcription machinery as well as co-activators.
