To examine the role of C/EBP-related transcription factors in long-term synaptic 
plasticity and memory storage, we have used the tetracycline-regulated system 
and expressed in the forebrain of mice a broad dominant-negative inhibitor of 
C/EBP (EGFP-AZIP), which preferentially interacts with several inhibiting 
isoforms of C/EBP. EGFP-AZIP also reduces the expression of ATF4, a distant 
member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors that is homologous to the 
Aplysia memory suppressor gene ApCREB-2. Consistent with the removal of 
inhibitory constraints on transcription, we find an increase in the pattern of 
gene transcripts in the hippocampus of EGFP-AZIP transgenic mice and both a 
reversibly enhanced hippocampal-based spatial memory and LTP. These results 
suggest that several proteins within the C/EBP family including ATF4 (CREB-2) 
act to constrain long-term synaptic changes and memory formation. Relief of this 
inhibition lowers the threshold for hippocampal-dependent long-term synaptic 
potentiation and memory storage in mice.
