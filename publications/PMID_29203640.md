Recognition of gene promoters by RNA polymerase II is mediated by general 
transcription factor IID (TFIID), which has been thought to be a static complex 
and to play a passive role in the regulation of gene expression under the 
instruction of gene-specific transcription factors. Here we show that 
transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) induced degradation of the TFIID subunit 
TAF7 in cultured mouse mammary epithelial cells and that this effect was 
required for proliferative arrest in response to TGF-β stimulation. TGF-β 
stimulated transcription of the gene for the ubiquitin ligase TRIM26, which was 
shown to ubiquitylate TAF7 and thereby to target it for proteasomal degradation. 
Sustained exposure of cells to TGF-β resulted in recovery from proliferative 
arrest in association with amplification of the Myc proto-oncogene, with MYC 
inhibiting TRIM26 induction by TGF-β. Our data thus show that TFIID is not 
simply a general mediator of transcription but contributes to the regulation of 
transcription in response to cell stimulation, playing a key role in the 
cytostatic function of TGF-β.

ABSTRACT

Recognition of gene promoters by RNA polymerase II is mediated by general transcription factor IID (TFIID), which has been thought to be a static complex and to play a passive role in the regulation of gene expression under the instruction of gene-specific transcription factors. Here we show that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) induced degradation of the TFIID subunit TAF7 in cultured mouse mammary epithelial cells and that this effect was required for proliferative arrest in response to TGF-β stimulation. TGF-β stimulated transcription of the gene for the ubiquitin ligase TRIM26, which was shown to ubiquitylate TAF7 and thereby to target it for proteasomal degradation. Sustained exposure of cells to TGF-β resulted in recovery from proliferative arrest in association with amplification of the Myc proto-oncogene, with MYC inhibiting TRIM26 induction by TGF-β. Our data thus show that TFIID is not simply a general mediator of transcription but contributes to the regulation of transcription in response to cell stimulation, playing a key role in the cytostatic function of TGF-β.

INTRODUCTION

Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that activates SMAD transcription factors via a receptor serine-threonine kinase ( 1 ). TGF-β functions as a pro-oncogenic factor through induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which confers characteristics associated with cancer stem cells and malignancy in epithelial cells ( 2 ). On the other hand, TGF-β also has the ability to inhibit cell proliferation and to induce apoptosis in most cell types, including epithelial cells ( 3 ). TGF-β is thus thought to act as a tumor suppressor at early stages of tumorigenesis but to promote invasiveness and metastasis in more advanced tumor cells ( 4 ). However, the molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells evade the restraining effect of TGF-β on cell proliferation have remained unclear.

Eukaryotic transcription is initiated by recognition of a gene promoter by general transcription factor IID (TFIID), a complex of TATA box binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) ( 5 ). Whereas TFIID has been thought to be a static complex and to play a passive role in the selection of genes for transcriptional activation ( 6 ), recent studies have suggested that the stoichiometry of TFIID subunits is not static but is instead regulated in a cell-type-specific manner. Such cell-type-specific TFIID complexes are now thought to be important for selective gene expression during lineage-specific cell differentiation ( 7 ). Although many of these studies have shown that the differential expression of TFIID components is regulated at the transcriptional level, the possible role of posttranscriptional regulation—particularly at the level of protein degradation—has remained largely uninvestigated.

The degradation of nuclear proteins is regulated in large part by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which proteins tagged with multiple ubiquitin molecules undergo proteasome-catalyzed degradation ( 8 , 9 ). Protein ubiquitylation requires three enzymes: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). The ubiquitin ligase determines the substrate specificity of the ubiquitylation reaction ( 10 , 11 ). The degradation of TAF4a and TBP during the differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells and myoblasts has been shown to be suppressed by a proteasome inhibitor ( 12 ). A novel ubiquitin ligase that targets TBP in myotubes was recently identified and was shown to regulate myotube differentiation together with the proteasome ( 13 ), raising the possibility that the ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates additional TFIID components in other cellular processes, such as EMT.

Myc is one of the most frequently amplified oncogenes ( 14 ). Overexpression of the MYC protein increases the expression of genes that promote cell proliferation and negatively regulates that of genes related to proliferation arrest ( 15 , 16 ), with these effects together facilitating tumor formation. MYC has been proposed to regulate gene expression both globally ( 17 , 18 ) and selectively ( 19 , 20 ). Genome-wide analyses have shown that MYC represses the expression of as many genes as it activates ( 21 , 22 ), indicating the importance of such repression by MYC. However, the molecular mechanisms by which MYC acts as a transcriptional repressor have remained largely uncharacterized. In addition, the functional relationship between MYC and TGF-β in tumorigenesis is still mostly unknown.

We have now investigated the role of TFIID in TGF-β action and provide evidence that TGF-β and MYC signaling pathways converge at the level of gene expression for the ubiquitin ligase TRIM26, with TGF-β-induced proliferative arrest being mediated by TRIM26-dependent degradation of TAF7 and this effect being antagonized by MYC.

DISCUSSION

Cellular differentiation processes have been found to be associated with the downregulation of various TFIID components mediated by transcriptional repression. Proteasomal degradation has also been implicated in such downregulation of TBP and TAF4a in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts and F9 embryonal carcinoma cells ( 12 ), with HUWE1 recently identified as a ubiquitin ligase that targets TBP for degradation ( 13 ). We have now identified TRIM26 as a ubiquitin ligase that targets the TFIID component TAF7 for proteasomal degradation, suggesting that posttranslational regulation of TFIID subunits may be widespread. Why is the abundance of TFIID components regulated by both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms? Given that we found that TGF-β induces both proteasomal degradation of TAF7 and upregulation of Taf7 mRNA, cessation of proteasomal degradation is likely followed by a rapid recovery of TAF7 levels after termination of TGF-β stimulation. Characterization of the mechanism by which TRIM26 is inactivated after TGF-β withdrawal should provide further insight into such regulation.

TRIM26 is a RING finger-type ubiquitin ligase with three previously identified substrates. TRIM26 thus binds to and ubiquitylates IRF3 for proteasomal degradation in the nucleus in response to interferon stimulation ( 31 ). Similar to the effect of TGF-β described in the present study, interferon stimulation upregulates TRIM26 expression, indicating that TRIM26 is a stimulus-activated ubiquitin ligase. TRIM26 also ubiquitylates PHF20 and thereby triggers its degradation in the nucleus in a manner dependent on its recruitment by the histone demethylase JMJD3, serving as a scaffold protein ( 32 ). In addition, the DNA base excision repair-related DNA glycosylase NEIL1 was recently identified as a substrate for TRIM26-dependent degradation, with suppression of Trim26 expression resulting in the accumulation of NEIL1 and increased resistance to ionizing radiation ( 33 ). Given that IRF3, PHF20, and TAF7 are all involved in gene transcription and NEIL1 is involved in DNA repair, it is likely that TRIM26 is an important regulator of gene transcription and repair in response to cellular stimulation. Furthermore, the recent finding that TRIM26 serves as a tumor suppressor of hepatocellular carcinoma ( 34 ) is consistent with our finding that TRIM26 functions as a negative regulator of cell proliferation by targeting TAF7 for degradation. Although our results support the notion that TAF7 is the major substrate of TRIM26 in the induction of proliferation arrest and apoptosis by TGF-β, we do not exclude the possibility that other TRIM26 substrates (IRF3, PHF20, NEIL1, or as yet unidentified proteins) also contribute to these effects.

Downregulation of MYC mRNA by TGF-β has previously been shown to be important for proliferation arrest in epithelial cells ( 15 , 35 ). However, we did not detect such an effect of TGF-β in NMuMG cells (data not shown), suggesting that transcriptional repression of the MYC gene by TGF-β is cell type specific. In this regard, it will be interesting to determine whether cells depleted of MYC are able to overcome the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β during long-term exposure to the cytokine.

Our data indicate that overexpressed MYC competes with SMAD3 for binding to the Trim26 promoter and thereby inhibits Trim26 expression. Given that MYC binds to the Trim26 promoter, we propose that MYC directly regulates Trim26 expression ( Fig. 11 ). However, we do not exclude the possibility that transcriptional repressors induced by MYC also contribute to this regulation, as a global transcription amplifier model for MYC posits ( 36 ). How MYC competes with SMAD3 at target genes requires clarification in order to provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional repression by MYC.

TGF-β has been known to induce characteristics of malignant tumors in precancerous cells, with concomitant inhibition of proliferation ( 3 , 4 ), but how this negative effect on proliferation is overcome in cancer cells has remained poorly understood. The Myc gene is frequently amplified in aggressive tumors ( 14 ), and the abundance of MYC mRNA or protein has been found to correlate with the rate of cell proliferation ( 15 , 16 ). Genome-wide analysis has shown that MYC regulates the expression of various genes, many of which are related to the cell cycle ( 15 ). Our findings now connect TGF-β and MYC at the level of a shared target gene, Trim26 , with TGF-β signaling inducing and MYC suppressing Trim26 expression. Such regulation has opposite outcomes with regard to cell proliferation, with MYC counteracting the antiproliferative activity of TGF-β in a manner independent of the EMT process.

We detected amplification of two genomic regions on the same chromosome, accompanied by an upregulation of transcript abundance for four genes within these regions, in proliferating NMuMG cells after sustained exposure to TGF-β. Although Myc amplification likely contributes to this proliferative phenotype, we cannot exclude the possibility that the other three genes ( Pvt1 , Kif21a , and Abcd2 ) also play a role. Expression of PVT1 has been found to be required for upregulation of MYC protein levels in human cancer cells showing amplification of chromosome 8 ( 37 ). KIF21A is an inhibitor of microtubule growth ( 38 ), and its knockdown was shown to induce a lysosomal trafficking defect followed by lysosomal membrane disruption and consequent cell death ( 39 ), suggesting that Kif21a amplification might support cell survival by maintaining lysosomal trafficking. ABCD2 is a lipid transporter that mediates the import of very-long-chain fatty acids into the lumen of peroxisomes for β-oxidation ( 40 ). Overexpression of ABCD2 might be expected to support cell proliferation through facilitation of energy production by β-oxidation or sequestration of excess very-long-chain fatty acids. Further studies are necessary to clarify the potential contributions of these three genes to cell proliferation during long-term exposure to TGF-β.
