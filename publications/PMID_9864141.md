Stat3 is essential for early embryonic development and for myeloid 
differentiation induced by the cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(G-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Two isoforms of Stat3 have been identified, 
(p92) and beta (p83), which have distinct transcriptional and biological 
functions. Activation of both Stat3 and Stat3beta requires the distal 
cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSFR, which contains four Tyr at positions 704, 729, 
744, and 764. The studies reported here were undertaken to determine which, if 
any, of these tyrosine residues participated in Stat3/beta recruitment and 
activation. We showed that Stat3 and Stat3beta were affinity purified using 
phosphopeptides containing Y704 and Y744 but not by nonphosphorylated peptide 
analogues or by phosphopeptides containing Y729 and Y764. Complementary results 
were obtained in studies examining the ability of these peptides to destabilize 
and inhibit DNA binding of activated Stat3. Both Y704 and Y744 contributed to 
optimal activation of Stat3/beta in M1 murine myeloid leukemia cells containing 
wild-type and Y-to-F mutant G-CSFR constructs. Carboxy-terminal to Y704 at the 
+3 position is Gln; YXXQ represents a consensus Stat3 recruitment and activation 
motif. Y744 is followed at the +3 position by Cys (C); YXXC, represents a novel 
motif implicated in the recruitment and activation of Stat3. Modeling of the SH2 
domain of Stat3 based on homologous SH2 domains of known structure revealed 
polar residues whose side chains contact the +3 position. This substitution may 
confer specificity for the Y704- and Y744-based ligands by allowing H-bond 
formation between the binding surface and the Gln or Cys found at the respective 
+3 position.
