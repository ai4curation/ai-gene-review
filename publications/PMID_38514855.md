Medulloblastoma (MB) is a prevalent malignant brain tumor among children, which 
can be classified into four primary molecular subgroups. Group 3 MB (G3-MB) is 
known to be highly aggressive and associated with a poor prognosis, 
necessitating the development of novel and effective therapeutic interventions. 
Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death induced by lipid peroxidation, has 
been identified as a natural tumor suppression mechanism in various cancers. 
Nevertheless, the potential role of ferroptosis in the treatment of G3-MB 
remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RNF126 acts as an 
anti-ferroptotic gene by interacting with ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 
(FSP1, also known as AIFM2) and ubiquitinating FSP1 at the 4KR-2 sites. 
Additionally, the deletion of RNF126 reduces the subcellular localization of 
FSP1 in the plasma membrane, resulting in an increase in the CoQ/CoQH2 ratio in 
G3-MB. The RNF126-FSP1-CoQ10 pathway plays a pivotal role in suppressing 
phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Clinically, 
RNF126 exhibited elevated expression in G3-MB and its overexpression was 
significantly associated with reduced patient survival. Our findings indicate 
that RNF126 regulates G3-MB sensitivity to ferroptosis by ubiquitinating FSP1, 
which provides new evidence for the potential G3-MB therapy.
