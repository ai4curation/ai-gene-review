Nucleolin is an abundant multifunctional nucleolar protein with defined roles in 
ribosomal RNA processing, RNA polymerase I catalyzed transcription and the 
regulation of apoptosis. Earlier we reported that human nucleolin binds to the 
p53 antagonist human double minute 2 (Hdm2) as determined by reciprocal 
co-immunoprecipitation assays using cell lysates. We also demonstrated that 
nucleolin antagonizes Hdm2-mediated degradation of p53. Here, we identify 
specific domains of nucleolin and Hdm2 proteins that support mutual interaction 
and investigate the implications of complex formation on p53 ubiquitination and 
protein levels. Our data indicate that the nucleolin N-terminus as well as the 
central RNA-binding domain (RBD) are predominantly involved in binding to Hdm2. 
The nucleolin RBD robustly bound to the NLS/NES (nuclear localization and export 
signals) domain of Hdm2 in vitro, while the N-terminus of nucleolin 
preferentially associated with the Hdm2 RING (really interesting new gene) 
domain expressed in cells. We further demonstrate that the C-terminal 
glycine-arginine rich domain of nucleolin serves as the predominant binding 
domain for direct interaction with p53. While overexpression of nucleolin or its 
various domains had no significant effect on Hdm2 auto-ubiquitination, the 
nucleolin RBD antagonized the Hdm2 E3 ligase activity against p53, leading to 
p53 stabilization. Conversely, the adjacent glycine-arginine rich domain of 
nucleolin interacted with p53 causing a modest stimulatory effect on p53 
ubiquitination. These data suggest that changes in nucleolin conformation can 
alter the availabilities of such domains in vivo to modulate the overall impact 
of nucleolin on Hdm2 activity and hence on p53 stability.

Abstract

Nucleolin is an abundant multifunctional nucleolar protein with defined roles in ribosomal RNA processing, RNA polymerase I-catalyzed transcription, and the regulation of apoptosis. Earlier we reported that human nucleolin binds to the p53-antagonist Hdm2 as determined by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays using cell lysates. We also demonstrated that nucleolin antagonizes Hdm2-mediated degradation of p53. Here, we identify specific domains of nucleolin and Hdm2 proteins that support mutual interaction and investigated the implications of complex formation on p53-ubiquitination and protein levels. Our data indicate that the nucleolin N-terminus as well as the central RNA-binding domain (RBD) are predominantly involved in binding to Hdm2. The nucleolin RBD robustly bound to the NLS/NES (nuclear localization and export signals) domain of Hdm2 in vitro, while N-terminus of nucleolin preferentially associated with the Hdm2 RING domain expressed in cells. We further demonstrate that the C-terminal GAR ( G lycine- A rginine R ich) domain of nucleolin serves as the predominant binding domain for direct interaction with p53. While over-expression of nucleolin or its various domains had no significant effect on Hdm2 auto-ubiquitination, the nucleolin RBD antagonized the Hdm2 E3 ligase activity against p53, leading to p53 stabilization. Conversely, the adjacent GAR domain of nucleolin interacted with p53 causing a modest stimulatory effect on p53 ubiquitination. These data suggest that changes in nucleolin conformation can alter the availabilities of such domains in vivo to modulate the overall impact of nucleolin on Hdm2 activity and hence on p53 stability.

Introduction

The Hdm2 oncoprotein (with non-human homologs referred to as Mdm2) is a well-studied E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the p53 tumor suppressor protein for proteasomal degradation. Under normal physiological conditions, Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination maintains low levels of p53 protein by triggering its degradation. Under conditions of cellular stress such as DNA damage or persistent oncogenic growth signals, the activity of Hdm2 towards p53 is reduced, raising p53 levels. This in turn causes growth arrest, the induction of apoptosis or senescence, dependent on the cellular milieu, in order to combat the stress conditions. Because the Hdm2-p53 connection is involved in life-and-death decisions for the cell, the interplay between these two factors is not surprisingly subject to regulation from various factors. A number of such factors are involved in ribosome structure or biogenesis including the large ribosomal subunits L5, L11 and L23 [ 1 – 6 ] as well as non-ribosomal proteins such as nucleophosmin/B23 [ 7 – 10 ], and nucleolin [ 11 , 12 ].

Nucleolin is an abundant nucleolar protein that stimulates the initial step of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing [ 11 ], and exerts both positive and negative effects on rDNA transcription, possibly through the FACT-like histone chaperone activity of nucleolin [ 13 ]. Over-expression of nucleolin is seen in many tumor types including leukemias (in which 25-fold higher nucleolin protein levels also stabilize Bcl-2 mRNA, increasing the resistance to apoptosis) [ 14 ], hepatocellular carcinomas [ 15 ], and breast tumors [ 16 ] (reviewed in [ 17 ]). Release of nucleolar stress factors (e.g. B23, ARF-Alternate Reading Frame protein and nucleolin) into the nucleoplasm upon various cellular stresses including DNA damage leads to p53-stabilization [ 8 , 18 – 22 ]. In contrast, binding of ribosomal protein L26 (RPL26) and nucleolin to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of p53 mRNA, controls p53 translation and induction upon DNA damage [ 23 ]. Nucleolin levels can increase up to 4-fold in response to c-Myc or a heightened cellular proliferation rate [ 24 , 25 ]. We reported earlier that analogous 2- to 4-fold alterations of nucleolin protein levels cause a similar increase in p53 protein levels [ 12 ]. These findings have led to the proposal that heightened nucleolin levels found in hyper-proliferating cells provide a feedback mechanism to stimulate p53 and hence slow growth.

Although nucleolin and p53 physically interact [ 18 ], the increase in p53 levels occurs through nucleolin binding and inhibiting Hdm2 activity towards p53 [ 12 ]. The molecular basis for this effect remains dimly understood. In this report, we examined the molecular interactions between nucleolin and Hdm2 in both cell-free systems and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that specific domains of nucleolin and Hdm2 proteins are involved in mutual interactions. The results show novel associations between nucleolin-Hdm2 as well as nucleolin-p53, and add a unique mechanism into the regulation of p53 stability that is fine-tuned by availability of specific nucleolin domains through possible modifications in nucleolin conformation.

Results

In our earlier study we reported interactions of full-length nucleolin and Hdm2 proteins in vivo using reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays [ 12 ]. In order to map the interacting domains of nucleolin and Hdm2, we generated various constructs that expressed nucleolin truncation mutants ( Fig. 1A ). These constructs also allow the expression of GST- or GFP-tagged nucleolin in either a yeast or mammalian expression system. Similarly, GST-tagged Hdm2 FL and Hdm2-truncation mutants shown schematically in Fig. 1B , were produced using a prokaryotic expression system [ 8 ].

Discussion

Hdm2 is a key E3 ubiquitin ligase that is critical for the regulation of p53 stability and thereby p53 activity in cells. Significant control over Hdm2 activity has been demonstrated to be exerted by factors involved in ribosomal RNA processing (nucleolin, nucleophosmin/B23), or by particular ribosome subunits (L5, L11 and L23). Here, our examination of the nucleolin-Hdm2 association finds two distinct physical interactions between nucleolin and Hdm2 that are mediated by multiple domains on each factor (schematically depicted in Fig. 8 ). Nucleolin RBD was found to bind directly with the Hdm2 p53-BD, NLS/NES, and RING, while nucleolin NT associate with the Hdm2 p53-BD and RING. Furthermore, these interactions can yield both positive and negative alterations in Hdm2 activity, and similar effects on p53 levels. Although the expression of the full-length nucleolin increases p53 protein levels under our growth conditions (this report; [ 12 ]), our results clearly raise the potential for nucleolin to have both positive and negative effects on Hdm2 activity, dependent on nucleolin conformation and/or modification state that enable availability of specific domains.

Past work has found that the association of nucleolin with other factors is altered both by genotoxic stress and the nucleolin phosphorylation state, presumably by causing changes to nucleolin conformation [ 27 ]. It had also been observed that the conformation of nucleolin, as examined by the sensitivity to protease digestion, was altered by the presence of poly (G) RNA [ 28 ]. These results suggest that the nucleolin conformation is sensitive to environmental conditions, and to the loss of its pre-rRNA target caused by stress. Thus, the ability of multiple domains in both nucleolin and Hdm2 to interact suggests that alterations in nucleolin conformation, which increase or decrease the exposure of particular nucleolin domains, can fine-tune the activity of Hdm2 towards p53.

The L5, L11 and L23 ribosome subunits have each been found to associate with the central acidic domain of Hdm2 [ 1 , 2 , 5 ]. These interactions also lead to loss of activity of Hdm2 towards p53, and thus p53 stabilization. Binding of the L5 and L11 proteins was also found to be dependent on the structural integrity of the C4 zinc finger region that is contained within the Hdm2 central acidic domain [ 29 , 30 ]. In contrast, nucleolin interacted with the strongest apparent affinity to the Hdm2 NLS/NES and RING entities, and to a lesser extent with the p53-binding domain. We did not observe any noticeable association of nucleolin with the Hdm2 central acidic domain, demonstrating that nucleolin inhibits Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination using a mechanism distinct from that used by the three ribosomal factors.

Because nucleolin, or any of its isolated domains, did not detectably affect Hdm2 auto-ubiquitination in vitro, the ability of nucleolin to inhibit p53 ubiquitination does not appear to result from a general inhibition of Hdm2 activity. Instead the effect of nucleolin on Hdm2 is specific to ubiquitination of p53. Expression of the nucleolin RBD had the strongest effect on p53 stabilization, but the mechanism of Hdm2 inhibition is made complicated by the ability of RBD to associate with the Hdm2 NLS/NES, RING, and p53-BD entities. Which of these interactions causes an inhibition of Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination? First considering the Hdm2 NLS/NES sequence, it has been shown that Hdm2 association with p53 can induce nuclear export, an event required for p53 degradation [ 31 ]. However, this re-localization is dependent on the p53, but not the Hdm2, NES. The significance of nucleolin association with the Hdm2 NLS/NES is therefore as yet unclear. In contrast, the association of the RBD with the p53-binding domain could be easily envisioned to yield a specific effect on p53 ubiquitination by preventing p53 association with Hdm2. Nutlin-1, a small molecule antagonist of Mdm2, functions by binding to the p53-binding pocket in the p53-BD, destabilizing the Hdm2-p53 complex [ 32 ]. Lastly, it is also possible that the association of the nucleolin RBD (or NT) domain with the Hdm2 RING is responsible for the observed inhibition of Hdm2 activity. The RING domain is an element essential for p53 ubiquitination, and past work has shown that acetylation of Mdm2 primarily in the RING domain inhibits p53 degradation [ 33 ]. Although nucleolin does not efficiently bind with the Hdm2-CT constructs containing RING domain in binding assays with cell lysates and nucleolin-NT does not interact with Hdm2-RING domain in vitro, it can be envisioned that binding of nucleolin-RBD to the NLS/NES or p53-BD may expose the RING domain for interaction with nucleolin-NT in vivo. More work will be needed to further decipher the roles of the nucleolin RBD and NT on Hdm2 activity, particularly in the context of the full-length nucleolin protein.

Our study provides further demonstration of the importance of factors involved in ribosome biogenesis in the regulation of the Hdm2-p53 axis. In addition, it is now clear that the modulation of Hdm2 activity can provide a potential route for anti-cancer therapy [ 34 – 37 ]. Dissecting nucleolin domains that are inhibitory to Hdm2 can thus provide valuable data for the development of alternative anti-Hdm2 regulators to aid cancer therapeutics.
