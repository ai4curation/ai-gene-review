DNA methyltransferases methylate target bases within specific nucleotide 
sequences. Three structures are described for bacteriophage T4 DNA-adenine 
methyltransferase (T4Dam) in ternary complexes with partially and fully specific 
DNA and a methyl-donor analog. We also report the effects of substitutions in 
the related Escherichia coli DNA methyltransferase (EcoDam), altering residues 
corresponding to those involved in specific interaction with the canonical GATC 
target sequence in T4Dam. We have identified two types of protein-DNA 
interactions: discriminatory contacts, which stabilize the transition state and 
accelerate methylation of the cognate site, and antidiscriminatory contacts, 
which do not significantly affect methylation of the cognate site but disfavor 
activity at noncognate sites. These structures illustrate the transition in 
enzyme-DNA interaction from nonspecific to specific interaction, suggesting that 
there is a temporal order for formation of specific contacts.
