Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain transcriptional repression of hundreds of 
genes involved in development, signaling or cancer using chromatin-based 
epigenetic mechanisms. Biochemical studies in Drosophila have revealed that PcG 
proteins associate in at least two classes of protein complexes known as 
Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). Drosophila core PRC1 is 
composed of four subunits, Polycomb (Pc), Sex combs extra (Sce), Polyhomeotic 
(Ph), and Posterior sex combs (Psc). Each of these proteins has multiple 
orthologs in vertebrates classified respectively as the CBX, RING1/RNF2, PHC, 
and BMI1/PCGF families. Mammalian genomes encode five CBX family members (CBX2, 
CBX4, CBX6, CBX7, and CBX8) that are believed to have distinct biological 
functions. Here, we applied a tandem affinity purification (TAP) approach 
coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methodologies in order to identify 
interacting partners of CBX family proteins under the same experimental 
conditions. Our analysis identified with high confidence about 20 proteins 
co-eluted with CBX2 and CBX7 tagged proteins, about 40 with CBX4, and around 60 
with CBX6 and CBX8. We provide evidences that the CBX family proteins are 
mutually exclusive and define distinct PRC1-like protein complexes. CBX proteins 
also interact with different efficiencies with the other PRC1 components. Among 
the novel CBX interacting partners, protein kinase 2 associates with all 
CBX-PRC1 protein complexes, whereas 14-3-3 proteins specifically bind to CBX4. 
14-3-3 protein binding to CBX4 appears to modulate the interaction between CBX4 
and the BMI1/PCGF components of PRC1, but has no effect on CBX4-RING1/RNF2 
interaction. Finally, we suggest that differences in CBX protein interactions 
would account, at least in part, for distinct subnuclear localization of the CBX 
family members.
