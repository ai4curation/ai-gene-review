BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A ruptured intracranial aneurysm (IA) is the leading 
cause of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This study seeks to define a specific gene 
whose mutation leads to disease.
METHODS: More than 500 IA probands and 100 affected families were enrolled and 
clinically characterized. Whole exome sequencing was performed on a large 
family, revealing a segregating THSD1 (thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 
protein 1) mutation. THSD1 was sequenced in other probands and controls. Thsd1 
loss-of-function studies in zebrafish and mice were used for in vivo analyses 
and functional studies performed using an in vitro endothelial cell model.
RESULTS: A nonsense mutation in THSD1 was identified that segregated with the 9 
affected (3 suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage and 6 had unruptured IA) and was 
absent in 13 unaffected family members (LOD score 4.69). Targeted THSD1 
sequencing identified mutations in 8 of 507 unrelated IA probands, including 3 
who had suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.6% [95% confidence interval, 
0.8%-3.1%]). These THSD1 mutations/rare variants were highly enriched in our IA 
patient cohort relative to 89 040 chromosomes in Exome Aggregation Consortium 
(ExAC) database (P<0.0001). In zebrafish and mice, Thsd1 loss-of-function caused 
cerebral bleeding (which localized to the subarachnoid space in mice) and 
increased mortality. Mechanistically, THSD1 loss impaired endothelial cell focal 
adhesion to the basement membrane. These adhesion defects could be rescued by 
expression of wild-type THSD1 but not THSD1 mutants identified in IA patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This report identifies THSD1 mutations in familial and sporadic IA 
patients and shows that THSD1 loss results in cerebral bleeding in 2 animal 
models. This finding provides new insight into IA and subarachnoid hemorrhage 
pathogenesis and provides new understanding of THSD1 function, which includes 
endothelial cell to extracellular matrix adhesion.
