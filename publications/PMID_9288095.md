Loss of sequences from human chromosome 10q has been associated with the 
progression of human cancer. Medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme are the 
most common malignant brain tumours in children and adults, respectively. In 
glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive form, 80% of the tumours show loss 
of 10q. We have used representational difference analysis to identify a 
homozygous deletion at 10q25.3-26.1 in a medulloblastoma cell line and have 
cloned a novel gene, DMBT1, spanning this deletion. DMBT1 shows homology to the 
scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily. Intragenic homozygous 
deletions has been detected in 2/20 medulloblastomas and in 9/39 glioblastomas 
multiformes. Lack of DMBT1 expression has been demonstrated in 4/5 brain-tumour 
cell lines. We suggest that DMBT1 is a putative tumour-suppressor gene 
implicated in the carcinogenesis of medulloblastoma and glibolastoma multiforme.
