Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Small open 
reading frame (sORF)-encoded proteins or microproteins constitute a new class of 
molecules often transcribed from presumed long non-coding RNA transcripts 
(lncRNAs). The translation of some of these sORFs has been confirmed, but their 
cellular function and importance remains largely unknown. Here, we report the 
identification and characterization of a novel microprotein of 10 kDa, which we 
named Cancer-Associated Small Integral Membrane Open reading frame 1 (CASIMO1). 
CASIMO1 RNA is overexpressed predominantly in hormone receptor-positive breast 
tumors. Its knockdown leads to decreased proliferation in multiple breast cancer 
cell lines. Its loss disturbs the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, leads 
to inhibition of cell motility, and causes a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The 
proliferation phenotype upon overexpression is observed only with CASIMO1 
protein expression, but not with a non-translatable mutant attributing the 
effects to the sORF-derived protein rather than a lncRNA function. CASIMO1 
microprotein interacts with squalene epoxidase (SQLE), a key enzyme in 
cholesterol synthesis and a known oncogene in breast cancer. Overexpression of 
CASIMO1 leads to SQLE protein accumulation without affecting its RNA levels and 
increased lipid droplet clustering, while knockdown of CASIMO1 decreased SQLE 
protein abundance and ERK phosphorylation downstream of SQLE. Importantly, SQLE 
knockdown mimicked the CASIMO1 knockdown phenotype and in turn SQLE 
overexpression fully rescued the effect of CASIMO1 knockdown. These findings 
establish CASIMO1 as the first functional microprotein that plays a role in 
carcinogenesis and is implicated in the cell lipid homeostasis.
