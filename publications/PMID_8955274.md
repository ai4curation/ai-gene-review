Translocation of mitochondrial preproteins across the inner membrane is 
facilitated by the TIM machinery. Tim23 binds to matrix targeting signals and 
initiates membrane potential-dependent import. Tim23 and Tim17 are constituents 
of a translocation channel across the inner membrane. Tim44 is associated with 
this channel at the matrix side, and Tim44 recruits mitochondrial Hsp70 and its 
co-chaperone Mgel, which drive protein translocation into the matrix using ATP 
as an energy source. Tim22 is a new component of the import machinery of 
mitochondria, which shares sequence similarity with both Tim23 and Tim17. Here 
we report that Tim22 is required for the import of proteins of the mitochondrial 
ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) family into the inner membrane. Members of the yeast AAC 
family are synthesized without matrix targeting signals. Tim22 is in an assembly 
of high relative molecular mass that is distinct from the Tim23-Tim17 complex. 
Import of proteins of the AAC family is independent of Tim23, and import of 
matrix targeting signals containing preproteins is independent of Tim22.
