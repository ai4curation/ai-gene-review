HIV-1 Nef, a protein important for the development of AIDS, has 
well-characterized effects on host membrane trafficking and receptor 
downregulation. By an unidentified mechanism, Nef increases the intrinsic 
infectivity of HIV-1 virions in a host-cell-dependent manner. Here we identify 
the host transmembrane protein SERINC5, and to a lesser extent SERINC3, as a 
potent inhibitor of HIV-1 particle infectivity that is counteracted by Nef. 
SERINC5 localizes to the plasma membrane, where it is efficiently incorporated 
into budding HIV-1 virions and impairs subsequent virion penetration of 
susceptible target cells. Nef redirects SERINC5 to a Rab7-positive endosomal 
compartment and thereby excludes it from HIV-1 particles. The ability to 
counteract SERINC5 was conserved in Nef encoded by diverse primate 
immunodeficiency viruses, as well as in the structurally unrelated glycosylated 
Gag from murine leukaemia virus. These examples of functional conservation and 
convergent evolution emphasize the fundamental importance of SERINC5 as a potent 
anti-retroviral factor.
