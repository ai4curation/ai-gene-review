Mice lacking the expression of proteolipid protein (PLP)/DM20 in 
oligodendrocytes provide a genuine model for spastic paraplegia (SPG-2). Their 
axons are well myelinated but exhibit impaired axonal transport and progressive 
degeneration, which is difficult to attribute to the absence of a single myelin 
protein. We hypothesized that secondary molecular changes in PLP(null) myelin 
contribute to the loss of PLP/DM20-dependent neuroprotection and provide more 
insight into glia-axonal interactions in this disease model. By gel-based 
proteome analysis, we identified >160 proteins in purified myelin membranes, 
which allowed us to systematically monitor the CNS myelin proteome of adult 
PLP(null) mice, before the onset of disease. We identified three proteins of the 
septin family to be reduced in abundance, but the nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) was virtually 
absent. SIRT2 is expressed throughout the oligodendrocyte lineage, and 
immunoelectron microscopy revealed its association with myelin. Loss of SIRT2 in 
PLP(null) was posttranscriptional, suggesting that PLP/DM20 is required for its 
transport into the myelin compartment. Because normal SIRT2 activity is 
controlled by the NAD+/NADH ratio, its function may be coupled to the axo-glial 
metabolism and the long-term support of axons by oligodendrocytes.
