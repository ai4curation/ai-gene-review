The D or L form of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) accumulates in certain rare 
neurometabolic disorders, and high D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) levels are also 
found in several types of cancer. Although 2HG has been detected in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its metabolism in yeast has remained largely 
unexplored. Here, we show that S. cerevisiae actively forms the D enantiomer of 
2HG. Accordingly, the S. cerevisiae genome encodes two homologs of the human 
D-2HG dehydrogenase: Dld2, which, as its human homolog, is a mitochondrial 
protein, and the cytosolic protein Dld3. Intriguingly, we found that a dld3Δ 
knock-out strain accumulates millimolar levels of D-2HG, whereas a dld2Δ 
knock-out strain displayed only very moderate increases in D-2HG. Recombinant 
Dld2 and Dld3, both currently annotated as D-lactate dehydrogenases, efficiently 
oxidized D-2HG to α-ketoglutarate. Depletion of D-lactate levels in the dld3Δ, 
but not in the dld2Δ mutant, led to the discovery of a new type of enzymatic 
activity, carried by Dld3, to convert D-2HG to α-ketoglutarate, namely an 
FAD-dependent transhydrogenase activity using pyruvate as a hydrogen acceptor. 
We also provide evidence that Ser3 and Ser33, which are primarily known for 
oxidizing 3-phosphoglycerate in the main serine biosynthesis pathway, in 
addition reduce α-ketoglutarate to D-2HG using NADH and represent major 
intracellular sources of D-2HG in yeast. Based on our observations, we propose 
that D-2HG is mainly formed and degraded in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae cells 
in a process that couples D-2HG metabolism to the shuttling of reducing 
equivalents from cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial respiratory chain via the 
D-lactate dehydrogenase Dld1.

Abstract

The d or l form of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) accumulates in certain rare neurometabolic disorders, and high d -2-hydroxyglutarate ( d -2HG) levels are also found in several types of cancer. Although 2HG has been detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , its metabolism in yeast has remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that S. cerevisiae actively forms the d enantiomer of 2HG. Accordingly, the S. cerevisiae genome encodes two homologs of the human d -2HG dehydrogenase: Dld2, which, as its human homolog, is a mitochondrial protein, and the cytosolic protein Dld3. Intriguingly, we found that a dld3 Δ knock-out strain accumulates millimolar levels of d -2HG, whereas a dld2 Δ knock-out strain displayed only very moderate increases in d -2HG. Recombinant Dld2 and Dld3, both currently annotated as d -lactate dehydrogenases, efficiently oxidized d -2HG to α-ketoglutarate. Depletion of d -lactate levels in the dld3 Δ, but not in the dld2 Δ mutant, led to the discovery of a new type of enzymatic activity, carried by Dld3, to convert d -2HG to α-ketoglutarate, namely an FAD-dependent transhydrogenase activity using pyruvate as a hydrogen acceptor. We also provide evidence that Ser3 and Ser33, which are primarily known for oxidizing 3-phosphoglycerate in the main serine biosynthesis pathway, in addition reduce α-ketoglutarate to d -2HG using NADH and represent major intracellular sources of d -2HG in yeast. Based on our observations, we propose that d -2HG is mainly formed and degraded in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae cells in a process that couples d -2HG metabolism to the shuttling of reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial respiratory chain via the d -lactate dehydrogenase Dld1.

Introduction

2-Hydroxyglutarate (2HG) 3 is a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid that was first detected in human urine in the late 1970s ( 1 ). Because of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon, 2HG exists under two enantiomeric configurations ( l or d ) that can be separated by gas or liquid chromatography after derivatization with another chiral compound and that can therefore be differentially assayed in biological samples using GC-MS or LC-MS methods ( 2 , 3 ). The interest in 2HG increased when it was found to accumulate in urine of patients with suspected inborn errors of metabolism ( 4 , 5 ). Most 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria patients present elevations of either l -2HG or d -2HG in their extracellular fluids, and the clinical phenotype depends on the configuration of the accumulated organic acid. More recently, cases of “combined d,l -hydroxyglutaric aciduria” have been reported ( 6 ).

2-Hydroxyglutaric acidurias remained enigmatic diseases because neither l -2HG nor d -2HG are intermediates of any known metabolic pathway, and the causal gene deficiencies were only discovered many years after the first patient case reports. It is now established that l -2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the L2HGDH gene, encoding a specific l -2HG dehydrogenase, whereas in many cases d -2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria results from loss-of-function mutations in the D2HGDH gene, which encodes a dehydrogenase acting on d -2HG ( 7 , 8 ). Other cases of d -2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria are caused by gain-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase gene IDH2 ( 9 ). Interestingly, somatic IDH1 (cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase) and IDH2 mutations leading to increased d -2HG production have also been identified in a number of cancers, including gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemia ( 10 ). Increased 2HG levels have in addition been detected in human breast tumors with wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) ( 11 ). d -2HG is therefore suspected to act as an oncometabolite ( 10 ). Combined d,l -hydroxyglutaric aciduria is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial citrate carrier SLC25A1 ( 12 ).

The cancer-associated mutant IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes actively convert α-ketoglutarate to d -2HG leading to high (millimolar) intracellular concentrations of the latter. It is less clear which is the main source of d -2HG in normal mammalian tissues. Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase (ADHFE1) catalyzes the conversion of γ-hydroxybutyrate to succinic semialdehyde with concomitant reduction of α-ketoglutarate to d -2HG ( 13 ). Human phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was also recently found to convert α-ketoglutarate to d -2HG, using NADH as a cofactor ( 14 ). Finally, there is evidence that wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 also slowly form d -2HG from α-ketoglutarate ( 15 ). A known source of l -2HG in mammalian cells is a low side activity of malate dehydrogenase, converting α-ketoglutarate to l -2HG at the expense of NADH ( 16 , 17 ). Such an l -2HG-producing side activity has also been demonstrated for the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenases of Arabidopsis thaliana ( 18 ). Lactate dehydrogenase A has recently been described as a major source of l -2HG in mammalian cells under hypoxia ( 19 ). Isotopic labeling studies using [ 13 C]glucose and [ 2 H]glutamate strongly indicate that, in the mammalian system, d -2HG and l -2HG are derived from the mitochondrial pool of α-ketoglutarate ( 20 , 21 ). In agreement with this, both the mammalian d - and l -2HG dehydrogenases were shown to be localized in the mitochondria ( 22 , 23 ).

In contrast to the mammalian system, very little is known about the occurrence of 2-hydroxyglutarate and its metabolism in yeast. 2HG was detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures grown anaerobically in the presence of glucose and of glutamate as the sole nitrogen source ( 24 ). 14 C labeling of either the supplemented glucose or glutamate revealed that 2HG was entirely derived from glutamate under these conditions. The purpose of the present work was to determine whether S. cerevisiae produces the l and/or the d enantiomer of 2HG and to identify the enzymes involved in the formation and degradation of this organic acid in yeast. We show that S. cerevisiae only forms detectable amounts of the d form of 2HG under standard yeast cultivation conditions (aerobic batch cultures in minimal defined medium supplemented with glucose) and that the main enzyme responsible for its degradation is encoded by the DLD3 gene, currently annotated as a d -lactate dehydrogenase. We found that this cytosolic protein actually converts d -2HG to α-ketoglutarate with concomitant reduction of pyruvate to d -lactate, qualifying this enzyme as a transhydrogenase rather than a dehydrogenase. Finally, we show that the Ser3 and Ser33 proteins, known to catalyze the oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate in the first step of the main yeast serine biosynthesis pathway, in addition catalyze the NADH-dependent conversion of α-ketoglutarate to d -2HG. The physiological significance of these reactions is discussed in the light of our findings.
