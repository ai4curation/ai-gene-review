When we treated rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs) with neuronal 
differentiation induction media, typical unfolded protein response (UPR) was 
observed. BIP/GRP78 protein expression was time-dependently increased, and three 
branches of UPR were all activated. ATF6 increased the transcription of XBP1 
which was successfully spliced by IRE1. PERK was phosphorylated and it was 
followed by eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Transcription of two downstream targets 
of eIF2alpha, ATF4 and CHOP/GADD153, were transiently up-regulated with the peak 
level at 24 h. Immunocytochemical study showed clear coexpression of BIP and 
ATF4 with NeuN and Map2, respectively. UPR was also observed during the neuronal 
differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Finally, chemical 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers, thapsigargin, tunicamycin, and 
brefeldin A, dose-dependently increased both mRNA and protein expressions of 
NF-L, and, its expression was specific to BIP-positive rBMSCs. Our results 
showing the induction of UPR during neuronal differentiations of rBMSCs and mES 
cells as well as NF-L expression by ER stress inducers strongly suggest the 
potential role of UPR in neuronal differentiation.
