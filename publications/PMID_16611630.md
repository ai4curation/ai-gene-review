Loss of articular cartilage because of extracellular matrix breakdown is the 
hallmark of arthritis. Degradative fragments of cartilage oligomeric matrix 
protein (COMP), a prominent noncollagenous matrix component in articular 
cartilage, have been observed in the cartilage, synovial fluid, and serum of 
arthritis patients. The molecular mechanism of COMP degradation and the 
enzyme(s) responsible for it, however, remain largely unknown. ADAMTS-12 (a 
disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs) was shown to 
associate with COMP both in vitro and in vivo. ADAMTS-12 selectively binds to 
only the epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain of COMP of the four 
functional domains tested. The four C-terminal TSP-1-like repeats of ADAMTS-12 
are shown to be necessary and sufficient for its interaction with COMP. 
Recombinant ADAMTS-12 is capable of digesting COMP in vitro. The COMP-degrading 
activity of ADAMTS-12 requires the presence of Zn2+ and appropriate pH 
(7.5-9.5), and the level of ADAMTS-12 in the cartilage and synovium of patients 
with both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is significantly higher than 
in normal cartilage and synovium. Together, these findings indicate that 
ADAMTS-12 is a new COMP-interacting and -degrading enzyme and thus may play an 
important role in the COMP degradation in the initiation and progression of 
arthritis.

Abstract

Loss of articular cartilage because of extracellular matrix breakdown is the hallmark of arthritis. Degradative fragments of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a prominent noncollagenous matrix component in articular cartilage, have been observed in the cartilage, synovial fluid, and serum of arthritis patients. The molecular mechanism of COMP degradation and the enzyme(s) responsible for it, however, remain largely unknown. ADAMTS-12 ( a d isintegrin a nd m etalloprotease with t hrombo s pondin motifs) was shown to associate with COMP both in vitro and in vivo. ADAMTS-12 selectively binds to only the epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain of COMP of the four functional domains tested. The four C-terminal TSP-1-like repeats of ADAMTS-12 are shown to be necessary and sufficient for its interaction with COMP. Recombinant ADAMTS-12 is capable of digesting COMP in vitro. The COMP-degrading activity of ADAMTS-12 requires the presence of Zn 2 + and appropriate pH (7.5-9.5), and the level of ADAMTS-12 in the cartilage and synovium of patients with both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is significantly higher than in normal cartilage and synovium. Together, these findings indicate that ADAMTS-12 is a new COMP-interacting and -degrading enzyme and thus may play an important role in the COMP degradation in the initiation and progression of arthritis.

RESULTS

ADAMTS-12 Associates with COMP in Yeast —Our unpublished observation that the EGF-like domain of COMP binds to the C-terminal TSP1-like repeats of ADAMTS-7, whose domain organization and structure are similar to those of ADAMTS-12, prompted us to investigate whether ADAMTS-12 interacts with COMP. For this purpose, the four C-terminal TSP1-like repeats of ADAMTS-12 (amino acids 1316-1530) were subcloned into a yeast expression pPC86 vector and a yeast two-hybrid assay performed ( Fig. 1A ). Briefly, the plasmid encoding the EGF-like domain of COMP (amino acids 84-261) linked to Gal4DBD (above the line in Fig. 1B ) and the plasmid encoding the four C-terminal TSP1-like repeats of ADAMTS-12 fused to VP16AD (below the line) were used to cotransform the yeast strain MAV203. Plasmid pairs encoding c-Jun/c-Fos and Rb/lamin were used as positive and negative protein-protein interaction controls, respectively. Interaction between the C-terminal polypeptide of ADAMTS-12 and the EGF-like domain of COMP was resolved by a β-galactosidase assay and growth phenotype on selective media ( Fig. 1B ). Like the c-Jun/c-Fos pair, which are known to interact, the EGF-like domain of COMP was shown to interact with the C-terminal of ADAMTS-12 in yeast based on β-galactosidase activity ( Fig. 1B , left) and growth inhibition on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (two hybrid-dependent activation of URA3 results in conversion of 5-fluoroorotic acid to 5-fluorouracil, which is toxic). Hence, the growth of yeast containing interacting proteins is inhibited when plated on the medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid ( Fig. 1B , right).

Direct Binding of COMP to the C-terminal Polypeptide of ADAMTS-12 in Vitro —The interaction between COMP and ADAMTS-12 was also confirmed using in vitro GST pulldown assays. Briefly, affinity-purified GST and a purified COMP EGF-like domain (amino acids 84-261) as a GST fusion protein (GST-EGF) that were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with cell extracts prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding either wild-type ADAMTS-12 (TS-12, Fig. 2A ) or ADAMTS-12 with mutant catalytic domain (TS-12mut, Fig. 2B ) ( 39 ). After washing, glutathione-Sepharose bead bound proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Purified GST did not pull down either wild-type or mutant ADAMTS-12 ( Fig. 2A , lane 2 and B, lane 2), whereas GST-EGF efficiently pulled down these proteins ( Fig. 2A , lane 3 and B, lane 3 ), indicating that the EGF-like domain of COMP binds to the ADAMTS-12 in vitro .

The interaction between COMP and ADAMTS-12 was also characterized by an in vitro solid-liquid phase titration experiment in which the dilution series of recombinant His-TS12C4TSP and purified COMP showed dose-dependent binding and saturation to the liquid-phase COMP ( Fig. 2C ). The interaction between COMP and ADAMTS-12 is direct, since both COMP and the C-terminal four TSP-1-like repeats were used as purified recombinant proteins.

Binding of COMP to ADAMTS-12 in Mammalian Cells —We next performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay to determine whether ADAMTS-12 associates with COMP in vivo ( Fig. 2D ). COMP stable cell lines were transfected with a mammalian expression pcDNA3-ADAMTS12-HA plasmid that encodes HA-tagged ADAMTS-12 (provided by Drs. Cal and Lopez-Otin) ( 39 ). The cell extracts prepared from those transfected cells were first incubated with control IgG (negative control), anti-COMP (positive control), or anti-HA, and the complexes were detected with anti-COMP polyclonal antiserum. A specific COMP band was immunoprecipitated by anti-COMP antibodies (lane 3) and anti-HA antibodies (lane 4), but not by control IgG antibodies (lane 2), demonstrating that ADAMTS-12 specifically associates with COMP in vivo .

Selective Association of ADAMTS-12 with the EGF-like Domain of COMP —As shown in Fig. 1 , ADAMTS-12 associates with the EGF-like domain of COMP. We also investigated whether ADAMTS-12 interacts with the other three functional domains of COMP, including the N-terminal pentamerizing domain, the type III domain, and the C-terminal global domain. For this purpose, filter-based β-galactosidase assays were performed to determine whether coexpression of the various domains of COMP/Gal4DBD and ADAMTS-12/VP16AD fusion proteins activate the reporter LacZ gene. As shown in Fig. 3 , of the four functional domains tested, ADAMTS-12 selectively interacts with only the EGF-like domain of COMP.

Four C-terminal TSP1-like Repeats of ADAMTS-12 Are Necessary and Sufficient for Binding COMP —To identify the COMP binding domain in ADAMTS-12, we generated various constructs that expressed various ADAMTS-12 deletion mutants in yeast. Results from filter-based β-galactosidase assays ( Fig. 4B ) of all these mutants are summarized in Fig. 4A . The ADAMTS-12 prodomain, the metalloproteinase, disintegrin-like, and cysteine-rich domains, and the spacer-1 plus three TSP repeats all failed to bind to COMP. As expected, the spacer-2 plus four C-terminal TSP-1-like repeats bound to COMP. When the spacer-2 domain was removed, the binding to COMP was not disturbed, indicating that this domain is not required for binding. Further removal of four TSP-1-like repeats eliminated binding, indicating that four TSP-1-like repeats in the C-terminal are required. When four TSP-1-like repeats were used, however, COMP binding occurred. Our conclusion from this set of experiments is that that four C-terminal TSP-1-like repeats of ADAMTS-12 are required and sufficient for its interaction with COMP.

Cleavage of COMP by Recombinant ADAMTS-12 in Vitro —Once the interaction between ADAMTS-12 and COMP was established, cotransfection assays were performed to determine whether ADAMTS-12 has COMP-degrading activity. A COMP stable line was transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector, wild-type ADAMTS-12 (pFLAG-TS-12), or ADAMTS-12 with mutant catalytic domain (pTS-12mut), and the medium collected and detected by Western blotting with anti-COMP antibodies ( 13 , 37 , 38 ). As shown in Fig. 5A , the COMP stable cells transfected with either empty vector (lane 3) or mutant ADAMTS-12 (in which two crucial amino acids in the catalytic domain of ADAMTS-12 were mutated) ( 39 ) (lane 2) did not show any COMP-degrading activity, but wild-type ADAMTS-12 (lane 1) digested COMP and produced one major fragment with an apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (large arrowhead) and two minor fragments (small arrow-heads). We verified the COMP-cleaving activity of ADAMTS-12 by an in vitro digestion assay with purified COMP and the cell lysates expressing ADAMTS-12 or its mutant. As indicated in Fig. 5B , cell extracts transfected with an empty vector (lane 1) did not result in any COMP-degrading activity, but wild-type ADAMTS-12 (lane 2) showed COMP-degrading activity. In addition, enzymatic activity was dramatically reduced when the two crucial amino acids in the catalytic domain of ADAMTS-12 were mutated ( 39 ) (lane 3). COMP-degrading activity by ADAMTS-12 was further demonstrated by digestion performed with purified ADAMTS-12 ( Fig. 5C ).

Cleavage of COMP by ADAMTS-12 Is Zn 2 + - and pH-dependent —It was reported that the catalytic domain of ADAMTS-20 produced in bacteria can digest its substrates in vitro ( 44 ). Using a similar method, we purified the catalytic domain (amino acids 241-464) of ADAMTS-12 as a GST fusion protein (GST-TS12-CD) in bacteria. The GST moiety was further removed by a Xa factor, and the purity of proteins was confirmed by silver staining (not shown). The recombinant catalytic domain of ADAMTS-12 was employed in the following in vitro digestion assays. To determine whether ADAMTS-12-mediated COMP cleavage requires the involvement of cations, including Ca 2 + , Zn 2 + , and/or Mg 2 + , purified COMP substrate and ADAMTS-12 enzyme were incubated in digestion buffer in the presence or absence of various cations ( Fig. 5D ). A degraded COMP fragment ( arrow in Fig. 5D ) was detectable in the digestion buffer with Zn 2 + (lane 6) but was undetectable in the digestion buffer with Ca 2 + (lane 5) or Mg 2 + (lane 7) used alone. In the presence of Zn 2 + (compare lanes 8 and 10), the addition of Ca 2 + changed the electrophoretic mobility of the COMP-digested fragment, probably due to a conformation change in COMP. Mg 2 + seems not to affect COMP digestion by ADAMTS-12, since it did not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the COMP-digested fragment when used alone or in combination with other cations (compare lanes 10 and 7).

Because Zn 2 + is essential for the enzymatic activity of ADAMTS-12, we next performed an in vitro digestion assay with different Zn 2 + concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 m m ) to determine the optimum concentration of Zn 2 + for ADAMTS-12 activity ( Fig. 5E ). The highest enzymatic activity was observed in the presence of 2 m m of ZnCl 2 , and the amount of digested COMP was dramatically reduced or totally abolished in the presence of higher amounts of ZnCl 2 (4 or 8 m m ).

In vitro digestions were performed at various pH values in order to examine its regulation of ADAMTS-12 activity. As shown in Fig. 5F , ADAMTS-12 generated the largest amount of COMP fragments in the range of physiological pH (pH 7.5) up to pH 9.5, whereas the enzyme did not produce visible COMP fragments at pH values lower than 6.5 or higher than 10.5, indicating that the digestive activity of ADAMTS-12 is pH-dependent.

Musculoskeletal Tissues Distribution of ADAMTS-12 —The fact that COMP is predominately expressed in the musculoskeletal tissues, together with our findings that ADAMTS-12 binds to and cleave COMP, prompted us to test the expression of ADAMTS-12 in musculoskeletal tissues. Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay was performed to examine the expression of ADAMTS-12 mRNA in eight specimens of normal human musculoskeletal tissue. As seen in Fig. 6A , the 733-bp hADAMTS-12 fragment was amplified using ADAMTS-12-specific primers from cartilage, synovium, and tendon in which COMP was also present ( 3 , 4 ). ADAMTS-12 is also detectable in skeletal muscle and fat. However, ADAMTS-12 was undetectable in meniscus, bone, and ligament. These results demonstrate that while ADAMTS-12 is coexpressed in COMP-producing musculoskeletal tissues, it has a wider tissue distribution ( 3 , 4 , 38 , 46 ).

Increased Expression of ADAMTS-12 in the Cartilage and Synovium of Patients with Arthritis —To determine whether the expression of ADAMTS-12 in cartilage and synovium is altered in OA or RA, a quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a sequence-specific probe and primers for ADAMTS-12. Total RNA was extracted from adult age-matched normal and arthritic tissues (articular cartilage and synovium). As shown in Fig. 6B , ADAMTS-12 mRNA was significantly upregulated in both OA and RA cartilage ( p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively) compared with the normal control. Further analysis of synovium samples revealed that the level of ADAMTS-12 was also significantly up-regulated in RA synovium compared with normal synovium ( p < 0.001, Fig. 6C ).

DISCUSSION

The present study demonstrates that ADAMTS-12 binds to the EGF-like repeat domain of COMP via its four C-terminal TSP-1 like repeats and that ADAMTS-12-mediated COMP degradation is Zn 2 + - and pH-dependent (Figs. 3 - 5 ). In view of the fact that prominent COMP degradative fragments in OA and RA are produced by cleavage within the COMP EGF-like molecular domain, the binding of ADAMTS-12 to this same region with subsequent COMP cleavage is strong evidence that ADAMTS-12 plays an important role in COMP degradation ( 13 ).

COMP interacts with multiple protein partners; these interactions are important for the COMP physiologic functions and cytoplasmic processing and transport. COMP can mediate chondrocyte attachment through interactions with integrins. Through these interactions, COMP may be able to regulate cellular activities and respond to environment in the surrounding cartilage matrix ( 3 , 47 ). Several reports suggest that COMP may function to stabilize the articular cartilage extracellular matrix by specific cation-dependent interactions with matrix components, including collagen types II and IX, fibronectin, aggrecan, and matrilin-1, -3, and -4 ( 10 , 48 - 51 ). COMP has also been shown to associate with several chaperone proteins, including BiP, calreticulin, protein disulfide, ERp72, Grp94, HSP47, and calnexin, and it has been proposed that these associations facilitate the processing and transport of wild-type COMP in normal chondrocytes and in the retention of mutant COMP in pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes ( 52 - 54 ). In addition to the interactions between COMP and its protein partners, the five-stranded N-terminal domain of COMP forms a complex with vitamin D-3, illustrating that COMP has storage function for hydrophobic compounds, including prominent cell signaling molecules ( 55 ).

Purified COMP has been reported to be digested in vitro by several members from the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), collagenase-3 (MMP-13), strome-lysin-1 (MMP-3), gelatinase-B (MMP-9), MMP-19, and enamelysin (MMP-20) ( 56 ). It was also shown that ADAMTS-4 is able to cleave purified COMP in an in vitro digestion assay and that the resultant fragment has a molecular mass similar to one of the fragments observed in OA and RA samples ( 57 ); all these assays, however, were performed using an in vitro digestion system in which both enzymes and substrates were at higher concentrations than those in physiological/pathological conditions. None of these metalloproteinases has been found capable of associating with COMP, which is probably necessary for COMP degradation in vivo . Results from this study using ADAMTS-12 comprehensive protein-protein interactions and enzymatic activities assays clearly show that ADAMTS-12 can bind to and cleave COMP (Figs. 1 - 5 ).

The C-terminal domain of metalloproteinases were found to be important for binding substrates and determining enzyme selectivity; data from chimeric constructs indicate that collagenases, stromelysins, and gelatinases interact with their macromolecular substrates via this domain (see the review by Martel Pelletier, Ref. 62 ). The matrix-binding properties of ADAMTS-1 appear to be related to the number of TSP repeats in its C-terminal region ( 63 ), and our finding that four C-terminal TSP repeats of ADAMTS-12 are required and sufficient for binding to COMP also supports this concept. Recent studies also provide evidence that ADAMTS-4 interacts with aggrecan via its cysteine-rich/spacer domains ( 64 ), whereas its C-terminal region plays a major role in regulating aggrecanase activity by masking its general proteolytic activity ( 65 ).

In addition to their substrates, the enzymatic activities of ADAMTS proteins may be regulated by their associated proteins, and several ADAMTS binding partners have been isolated. α 2 -Macroglobulin was found to form protein complexes with ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 and represents an endogenous inhibitor of these enzymes ( 58 ). It was also reported that the aggrecanase activity of ADAMTS-4 is inhibited by fibronectin through interaction with its C-terminal domains, suggesting that this extracellular regulation mechanism of ADAMTS-4 activity may be important for the degradation of aggrecan in arthritic cartilage ( 59 ). ADAMTS-4 also associates with α 1 -antitrypsin a member of the family of plasma serine proteinase inhibitors, but the physiological significance of the interaction between them remains unclear ( 60 ). The extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1 was identified as an ADAMTS-1 interacting molecule in a yeast-two-hybrid screen, and fibulin-1 was found to enhance the capacity of ADAMTS-1 to cleave aggrecan, indicating that fibulin-1 is a regulator of ADAMTS-1-mediated proteoglycan proteolysis and thus may play an important role in proteoglycan turnover ( 61 ).

As shown in Fig. 5 , D and E , the COMP-degrading activity of ADAMTS-12 depends on the presence of appropriate cations; this dependence was further verified with EDTA chelator, since 5 m m EDTA totally abolished COMP digestion mediated by ADAMTS-12 (not shown). ADAMTS-12 demonstrated highest enzymatic activities in the presence of 2 m m Zn 2 + , whereas most metalloproteinases usually require lower concentrations of Zn 2 + for cleaving their substrates ( e.g. 0.1 m m ). The differences in metal requirements between metalloproteinases may indicate a difference in the cation dependence of these enzymes. A good example in this regard is the matrix metalloproteinases gelatinases. The 68,000 and 130,000 gelatinases are active at higher concentration of Zn 2 + (2 m m ), but 60,000 gelatinase is active at a very low concentration of Zn 2 + (5 μ m ) ( 45 ).

Reverse-transcription PCR was employed to examine the expression of ADAMTS-12 in human musculoskeletal tissues and revealed that ADAMTS-12 is expressed in COMP-expressing tissues, including cartilage, synovium, and tendon ( Fig. 6A ). A real time PCR assay performed to compare the expression profile of the ADAMTS genes in OA and normal cartilage showed that ADAMTS-12 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in OA cartilage ( p < 0.05) ( 1 ). This finding is in agreement with our quantitative real time PCR assays using OA cartilage; we also found, however, that ADAMTS-12 is significantly up-regulated in cartilage and synovium obtained from patients with RA ( p < 0.001, Fig. 6 , B and C ), suggesting that ADAMTS-12 plays an important role in joint degenerative disease progression. The increased expression of ADAMTS-12 in the joint tissues of arthritic patients may be caused by proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β (not shown).

Our identification of ADAMTS-12 as a COMP-binding protein and subsequent characterization of the enzyme/substrate association and COMP degradation mediated by ADAMTS-12 significantly extend our understanding of the degradative events that occur in joint disorders and promise to increase our ability to monitor the biological and physical properties of cartilage extracellular matrix. Because the levels of ADAMTS-12 are significantly increased in the cartilage and synovium of arthritis patients, this enzyme appears to play an important role in the pathophysiology of cartilage degradation in arthritis.
