Adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) translocates to, and stabilizes, the 
plus-ends of microtubules. In microtubule-dependent cellular protrusions, APC 
frequently accumulates in peripheral clusters at the basal membrane. APC 
targeting to membrane clusters is important for cell migration, but the 
localization mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we performed 
deletion mapping and defined a minimal sequence (amino acids 1-2226) that 
efficiently targets APC to membrane clusters. This sequence lacks DLG-1 and EB1 
binding sites, suggesting that these partners are not absolutely required for 
APC membrane targeting. A series of APC sequences were transiently expressed in 
cells and compared for their ability to compete endogenous APC at the membrane; 
potent inhibition of endogenous APC targeting was elicited by the Armadillo- 
(binds KAP3A, B56alpha, and ASEF) and beta-catenin-binding domains. The 
Armadillo domain was predicted to inhibit APC membrane localization through 
sequestration of the kinesin-KAP3A complex. The role of beta-catenin in APC 
membrane localization was unexpected but affirmed by overexpressing the APC 
binding sequence of beta-catenin, which similarly reduced APC membrane staining. 
Furthermore, we used RNA interference to show that loss of beta-catenin reduced 
APC at membrane clusters in migrating cells. In addition, we report that 
transiently expressed APC-yellow fluorescent protein co-localized with 
beta-catenin, KAP3A, EB1, and DLG-1 at membrane clusters, but only beta-catenin 
stimulated APC anchorage at the membrane. Our findings identify beta-catenin as 
a regulator of APC targeting to membrane clusters and link these two proteins to 
cell migration.
