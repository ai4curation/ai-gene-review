The RING domain protein RNF11 is overexpressed in breast cancers and promotes 
tumour growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signalling. RNF11 has been proposed to 
regulate TGF-beta signalling by interacting with HECT- and SCF-type E3 ligases; 
however, the role of RNF11 in other signalling pathways is poorly understood. 
Here, we demonstrate a novel function of RNF11 as a negative regulator of 
NF-kappaB and jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathways. Knockdown of 
RNF11 with siRNA resulted in persistent tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- and 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated NF-kappaB and JNK signalling. RNF11 interacted 
with the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20 and its regulatory protein TAX1BP1 in a 
stimulus-dependent manner. RNF11 negatively regulated RIP1 and TRAF6 
ubiquitination upon stimulation with TNF and LPS, respectively. Furthermore, 
RNF11 was required for A20 to interact with and inactivate RIP1 to inhibit 
TNF-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Our studies reveal that RNF11, together with 
TAX1BP1 and Itch, is an essential component of an A20 ubiquitin-editing protein 
complex that ensures transient activation of inflammatory signalling pathways.
