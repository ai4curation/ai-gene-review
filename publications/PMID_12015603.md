Sleep is controlled by two processes: a homeostatic drive that increases during 
waking and dissipates during sleep, and a circadian pacemaker that controls its 
timing. Although these two systems can operate independently, recent studies 
indicate a more intimate relationship. To study the interaction between 
homeostatic and circadian processes in Drosophila, we examined homeostasis in 
the canonical loss-of-function clock mutants period (per(01)), timeless 
(tim(01)), clock (Clk(jrk)) and cycle (cyc(01)). cyc(01) mutants showed a 
disproportionately large sleep rebound and died after 10 hours of sleep 
deprivation, although they were more resistant than other clock mutants to 
various stressors. Unlike other clock mutants, cyc(01) flies showed a reduced 
expression of heat-shock genes after sleep loss. However, activating heat-shock 
genes before sleep deprivation rescued cyc(01) flies from its lethal effects. 
Consistent with the protective effect of heat-shock genes, was the observation 
that flies carrying a mutation for the heat-shock protein Hsp83 (Hsp83(08445)) 
showed exaggerated homeostatic response and died after sleep deprivation. These 
data represent the first step in identifying the molecular mechanisms that 
constitute the sleep homeostat.
