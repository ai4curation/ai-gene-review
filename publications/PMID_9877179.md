We report the molecular cloning of a human cDNA that encodes a molecule having 
striking homology with Ras-specific GTPase-activating proteins (RasGAPs). Among 
previously described RasGAPs, the cDNA product is most closely related to 
Caenorhabditis elegans GAP-2, including a predicted coiled-coil structure near 
the carboxyl terminus. Expression of the cDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
defective in one of two RasGAPs, Ira2, complemented loss of the Ira2 function, 
indicating that the cDNA product functions as a RasGAP. The RasGAP-like gene is 
located on the human chromosome 1q25, the locus that appears to contain a 
hereditary prostate cancer susceptible gene, HPC1.
