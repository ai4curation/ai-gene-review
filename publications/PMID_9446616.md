Signal transduction through the interferongamma (IFNgamma) receptor involves the 
formation of a ligand-dependent multimolecular association of receptor chains 
(alpha and beta), Janus tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and Jak2), and the transcription 
factor (signal transducers and activators of transcription 1alpha (STAT1alpha)) 
in addition to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). 
Interactions between components of the Jak/STAT cascade and the 
p21(ras)/Raf-1/MAPK cascade are unexplored. Treatment of HeLa cells with 
IFNgamma resulted in the rapid and transient activation of Raf-1 and MAPK. 
Parallel activation of cells resulted in essentially no enhancement of p21(ras) 
activation despite marked enhancement after treatment with epidermal growth 
factor. In HeLa (E1C3) and fibrosarcoma (U4A) cell lines, both of which are 
deficient in Jak1 kinase, Raf-1 activation by IFNgamma was absent. 
Reconstitution of Raf-1 activity was observed only with kinase active Jak1 in 
both cell lines. In COS cells, transient expression of wild type or 
kinase-inactive Jak1 coimmunoprecipitated with Raf-1, but activation of Raf-1 
activity was only observed in cells expressing kinase-active Jak1. These 
observations suggest that a kinase-active Jak1 is required for IFNgamma 
activation of Raf-1 that is p21(ras)-independent.

Methods

RT-PCR and flow cytometry were used for the analysis of B7-DC expression on various tumor cells. The phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2, JNK, Akt, and JAK2 was determined by Western blot.

Results

IFN-γ markedly up-regulated B7-DC expression on various tumor cells and resulted in the phosphorylation of JAK2, JNK, ERK, p38, and Akt. Inhibition of ERK or JNK pathway significantly decreased IFN-γ-induced B7-DC expression, whereas inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt, p38, and JAK2 had very little effect on IFN-γ-induced B7-DC expression.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that the pretreatment of tumor cells with IFN-γ enhances B7-DC expression through ERK and JNK pathways.

Introduction

B7-DC, a new member of B7 family, was originally identified by Tseng et al. as a potent stimulator of T cells whose protein expression is predominantly restricted to dendritic cells (DCs) and activated macrophages (Tseng et al. 2001 ). Although B7-DC on DCs was also shown to down-modulate T-cell responses via binding to the inhibitory receptor PD-1 on activated T cells in vitro (Latchman et al. 2001 ), more evidence of the stimulatory function of B7-DC on DCs has been established recently by a PD-1-independent manner, which enhance T-cell proliferation, Th1 cytokine production, and tumor-specific immunity (Wang et al. 2003 ; Nguyen et al. 2002 ; Radhakrishnan et al. 2003 ; Shin et al. 2003 ). In addition, Shin T et al. showed that diminished T helper 1 and CTL response were found in B7-DC knockout mice (Shin et al. 2005 ). Similar to other members of B7 family, B7-DC expression can be induced in other cells. B7-DC on T cell activated by anti-CD3 body was demonstrated to suppress the proliferation of allo-antigen-specific T cells and Th1 cytokine production via PD-1 (Seo et al. 2006 ). Compared with B7-H1, B7-DC on tumor cells was rather restricted. And even in tumor samples copositive for B7-H1 and B7-DC, the B7-H1 expression was much higher than B7-DC so that the costimulatory effect of B7-DC may be overshadowed by the powerful inhibitory effect of B7-H1. And a recent report from Liu XL and colleagues has shown that B7-DC-transfected tumors significantly enhance anti-tumor immunity by promoting clonal expansion of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (Liu et al. 2003 ). These may be some evidence of the anti-tumor activity of B7-DC on tumor. However, the mechanism of B7-DC regulation on tumor cells and the signal transduction pathways involved have not been elucidated so far.

IFN-γ has been recognized as a critical cytokine involved in effective anti-tumor immune responses. IFNGR1 knockout mice, cells with dominant-negative IFNGR1 mutations and cells treated with IFN-γ neutralizing antibodies display compromised tumor rejection (Kaplan et al. 1998 ; Dighe et al. 1994 ; Tannenbaum and Hamilton 2000 ). The effectiveness of IFN-γ in tumor surveillance has been attributed to its ability to up-regulate MHC class I expression and other Ag presentation components (Webber and Rosenberg 1988 ), induce chemokines that inhibit angiogenesis (Sgadari et al. 1996 ; Sgadari et al. 1997 ) and down-regulate the expression of immunosuppressive molecules secreted by tumors (Naganuma et al. 1998 ; Boraschi et al. 1984 ). Recently, more interesting results were found that IFN-γ stimulation could induce B7-DC expression on macrophages and dendritic cells (Yamazaki et al. 2002 ). In view of the roles of IFN-γ and B7-DC in anti-tumor immunity response and the association between IFN-γ and B7-DC expression on macrophages and dendritic cells, we surmised that IFN-γ contributed to the up-regulated expression of B7-DC on tumor cells.

To gain a better insight into the mechanism of B7-DC expression on tumor cells, in this study, we detected B7-DC expression and the phosphorylation levels of p38, ERK1/2, JNK, Akt, and JAK2 on various tumor cells and demonstrated that IFN-γ could increase the expression of B7-DC on different types of cancer cells via ERK and JNK pathways.

Discussion

IFN-γ is an immunoregulatory cytokine, which coordinates a diverse array of cellular programs through transcriptional regulation of immunologically relevant genes. B7-DC, a new identified costimulatory signal in immune response, may be one of these genes. The findings in this study demonstrated that IFN-γ-induced B7-DC expression in several human cancer cell lines including T24, A549, and PC3 cells. Of these, we choose T24 cells to further study. Pretreatment of T24 cells with IFN-γ resulted in a dramatic increase in B7-DC gene expression and protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. However, our studies also showed that IFN-γ failed to induce B7-DC expression in several hepatoma carcinoma cell lines including HepG2, MHCC97L, and 7402 (data not shown). Thus, the effect of IFN-γ on B7-DC expression appears to be tissue-type specific, which may be associated with weaker IFN-γR expression on some tumor cells.

The mechanisms through which IFN-γ induces gene transcription have been investigated over the last decade. IFN-γ exerts its pleiotropic biological effects by interacting with IFNγR (Schroder et al. 2004 ). Ligation of IFNγR initiates intracellular signaling, in which the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway plays key role (Stark et al. 1998 ; Darnell et al. 1994 ; Ramana et al. 2002 ). However, it has been known that activation of JAK-STAT pathway alone is not sufficient for the generation of all biological activities of IFN-γ. Several recent studies have revealed the existence of STAT-1-independent pathways (Ramana et al. 2002 ; Ramana et al. 2001 ; Gil et al. 2001 ). It has been reported that IFN-γ can also activate many other pathways including the MAPK, PI-3 K/Akt, and PI-3 K/mTOR pathways (Platanias 2005 ). IFN-γ stimulation has been shown to activate specific MAPKs and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in certain cell types. For example, IFN-γ activates ERK1/2 in some cell types (Cho et al. 2007 ; Han et al. 2002 ; Sakatsume et al. 1998 ; Takaoka et al. 1999 ; Nguyen et al. 2000 ), p38 MAPK in human keratinocytes (Kanda et al. 2007 ), and Akt in mesangial cells (Venkatesan et al. 2006 ). In addition, very recently, an unpublished report from Han IO showed that IFN-γ induced an increase in the activity of JNK without affecting activities of ERK1/2 in neural progenitor cells. Therefore, we first examined whether p38 MAPK, JNK, ERK1/2, or PI3K/Akt signaling pathways can be activated in T24 cells by IFN-γ and found that JNK, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were all activated. Then, we determined the role of these pathways in IFN-γ-induced B7-DC expression by using specific inhibitors of pathways. We found AG 490 for JAK2 had little effect on IFN-γ-induced B7-DC expression on cancer cells, whereas both PD98059 for ERK1/2, and SP600125 for JNK significantly decreased B7-DC gene expression and protein expression, but PD98059 was more potent than SP600125 to attenuate B7-DC expression. We also found other inhibitors including LY294002 for PI3K, SB203580 for P38, PTDC for NF-κB (data not shown), and rapamycin (data not shown) for mTOR had little effect on IFN-γ-induced B7-DC expression in T24 cells. These results indicate that ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways are involved in IFN-γ-induced B7-DC gene expression and subsequently B7-DC protein expression in T24 cells. This is consistent with the report that demonstrated ERK pathway has a critical role in some gene induction after stimulation by IFN-γ (Hu et al. 2001 ; Roy et al. 2002 ). By application of PTCD, a potent NF-κB inhibitory, we preliminarily found that the role of NF-κB is unnoticeable in B7-DC expression induced by IFN-γ on T24 cells. And it would be of interest to identify the transcription factor that mediate B7-DC expression in cancer cells after stimulation by IFN-γ in the future study.

In conclusion, we for the first time showed that IFN-γ could enhance B7-DC expression in several type cancer cells including T24 cells, A549 cells, and PC3 cells. IFN-γ activated ERK1/2, JNK, p38 MAPK, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. And ERK and JNK signaling pathways were responsible for IFN-γ-induced B7-DC expression. These results may provide new insight for understanding the mechanisms by which IFN-γ displays its anti-tumor effect.
