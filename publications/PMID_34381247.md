Aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells, also known as the 'Warburg effect', is 
driven by hyperactivity of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). LDHA is thought to be 
a substrate-regulated enzyme, but it is unclear whether a dedicated 
intracellular protein also regulates its activity. Here, we identify the human 
tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) as a binding partner and uncompetitive 
inhibitor of LDHA. A flexible loop within the amino terminus of FLCN controls 
movement of the LDHA active-site loop, tightly regulating its enzyme activity 
and, consequently, metabolic homeostasis in normal cells. Cancer cells that 
experience the Warburg effect show FLCN dissociation from LDHA. Treatment of 
these cells with a decapeptide derived from the FLCN loop region causes cell 
death. Our data suggest that the glycolytic shift of cancer cells is the result 
of FLCN inactivation or dissociation from LDHA. Together, FLCN-mediated 
inhibition of LDHA provides a new paradigm for the regulation of glycolysis.

Abstract

Aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells, also known as the ‘Warburg effect’, is driven by hyperactivity of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). LDHA is thought to be a substrate-regulated enzyme, but it is unclear whether a dedicated intracellular protein also regulates its activity. Here, we identify the human tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) as a binding partner and uncompetitive inhibitor of LDHA. A flexible loop within the amino terminus of FLCN controls movement of the LDHA active-site loop, tightly regulating its enzyme activity and, consequently, metabolic homeostasis in normal cells. Cancer cells that experience the Warburg effect show FLCN dissociation from LDHA. Treatment of these cells with a decapeptide derived from the FLCN loop region causes cell death. Our data suggest that the glycolytic shift of cancer cells is the result of FLCN inactivation or dissociation from LDHA. Together, FLCN-mediated inhibition of LDHA provides a new paradigm for the regulation of glycolysis.

Discussion

LDHA follows an ordered sequential mechanism whereby NADH binding to the co-factor-binding site precedes binding of pyruvate to the substrate-binding site. A subsequent conformational change in which the active-site loop closes over the active site provides a largely desolvated ternary complex. Our orthogonal approach has identified the tumor suppressor FLCN as a bona fide endogenous uncompetitive inhibitor of LDHA. Mechanistically, it appears that FLCN prefers binding to the less active LDHA dimer, compared to the hyperactive LDHA tetramer. A flexible loop within the amino terminus of FLCN controls movement of the LDHA active-site loop, which tightly regulates its enzyme activity and consequently metabolic homeostasis in normal cells. A protease-sensitive flexible antigenic loop within the substrate-binding domain of LDHA may also confer specificity of FLCN for LDHA.

Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor FLCN cause BHD syndrome, which predisposes affected individuals to develop kidney tumors. Previous works have shown that loss of FLCN causes dysregulation of LDHA and high lactate production in patient-derived cell lines 10 , 11 . Our data suggest that pathogenic mutation of FLCN enables LDHA hyperactivity as a result of a lack of direct LDHA inhibition by FLCN, leading to a metabolic shift in these tumors. FLCN is also unable to bind and inhibit LDHA in cancer cells that experience the Warburg effect. Interestingly, FLCN mutation rate is low across cancers 39 – 43 , suggesting a prevalent and robust epigenetic and/or post-translational inactivation. Although we do not know the signaling mechanisms that govern FLCN binding and/or dissociation from LDHA, we have managed to bypass this regulatory mechanism using a small FLCN-derived decapeptide that is cell-permeant and sufficient to efficiently inhibit LDHA activity. This decapeptide also has the ability to inhibit LDHA in a tumor derived from a patient with BHD.

LDHA is hyperactive in cancer cells experiencing the Warburg effect. Characteristically, LDHA is tetramerized in these cells, and binding to FLCN is less favorable in this state. However, the FLCN decapeptide has the ability to bind and inhibit LDHA in these cancer cells. Importantly, LDHA inhibitors have yet to see meaningful clinical advancement, in part due to a lack of isoform selectivity 44 . The inherent specificity of FLCN for LDHA over LDHB provides a conceptual advantage for future drug development efforts. Recapitulation of FLCN-mediated LDHA inhibition may be a new avenue for targeted therapy in these cancers.
