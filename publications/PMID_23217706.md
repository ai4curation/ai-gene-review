Abstract

Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a key event during tumorigenesis. Despite being known for decades (Warburg effect), the molecular mechanisms regulating this switch remained unexplored. Here, we identify SIRT6 as a novel tumor suppressor that regulates aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. Importantly, loss of SIRT6 leads to tumor formation without activation of known oncogenes, while transformed SIRT6-deficient cells display increased glycolysis and tumor growth, suggesting that SIRT6 plays a role in both establishment and maintenance of cancer. Using a conditional SIRT6 allele, we show that SIRT6 deletion in vivo increases the number, size and aggressiveness of tumors. SIRT6 also functions as a novel regulator of ribosome metabolism by co-repressing MYC transcriptional activity. Lastly, SIRT6 is selectively downregulated in several human cancers, and expression levels of SIRT6 predict prognosis and tumor-free survival rates, highlighting SIRT6 as a critical modulator of cancer metabolism. Our studies reveal SIRT6 to be a potent tumor suppressor acting to suppress cancer metabolism.

INTRODUCTION

Cancer cells are characterized by the acquisition of several characteristics that enable them to become tumorigenic ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000 ). Among them, the ability to sustain uncontrolled proliferation represents the most fundamental trait of cancer cells. This hyperproliferative state involves the deregulation of proliferative signaling pathways as well as loss of cell cycle regulation. In addition, tumor cells need to readjust their energy metabolism to fuel cell growth and division. This metabolic adaptation is directly regulated by many oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and is required to support the energetic and anabolic demands associated with cell growth and proliferation ( Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011 ).

Alteration in glucose metabolism is the best-known example of metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. Under aerobic conditions, normal cells convert glucose to pyruvate through glycolysis, which enters the mitochondria to be further catabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) to generate adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP). Under anaerobic conditions, mitochondrial respiration is abated; glucose metabolism is shifted towards glycolytic conversion of pyruvate into lactate. This metabolic reprogramming is also observed in cancer cells even in the presence of oxygen and was first described by Otto Warburg several decades ago ( Warburg, 1956 ; Warburg et al., 1927 ). By switching their glucose metabolism towards “aerobic glycolysis”, cancer cells accumulate glycolytic intermediates that will be used as building blocks for macromolecular synthesis ( Vander Heiden et al., 2009 ). Most cancer cells exhibit increased glucose uptake, which is due, in part, to the upregulation of glucose transporters, mainly GLUT1 ( Yamamoto et al., 1990 ; Younes et al., 1996 ). Moreover, cancer cells display a high expression and activity of several glycolytic enzymes, including phospho-fructose kinase (PFK)-1, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-A and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-1 ( Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011 ), leading to the high rate of glucose catabolism and lactate production characteristic of these cells. Importantly, downregulation of either LDH-A or PDK1 decreases tumor growth ( Bonnet et al., 2007 ; Fantin et al., 2006 ; Le et al., 2010 ) suggesting an important role for these proteins in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells.

Traditionally, cancer-associated alterations in metabolism have been considered a secondary response to cell proliferation signals. However, growing evidence has demonstrated that metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is a primary function of activated oncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressors ( Dang et al., 2012 ; DeBerardinis et al., 2008 ; Ward and Thompson, 2012 ). Despite this evidence, whether the metabolic reprogramming observed in cancer cells is a driving force for tumorigenesis remains as yet poorly understood.

Sirtuins are a family of NAD + -dependent protein deacetylases involved in stress resistance and metabolic homeostasis ( Finkel et al., 2009 ). In mammals, there are seven members of this family (SIRT1-7). SIRT6 is a chromatin-bound factor that was first described as a suppressor of genomic instability ( Mostoslavsky et al., 2006 ). SIRT6 also localizes to telomeres in human cells and controls cellular senescence and telomere structure by deacetylating histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) ( Michishita et al., 2008 ). However, the main phenotype SIRT6 deficient mice display is an acute and severe metabolic abnormality. At 20 days of age, they develop a degenerative phenotype that includes complete loss of subcutaneous fat, lymphopenia, osteopenia, and acute onset of hypoglycemia, leading to death in less than ten days ( Mostoslavsky et al., 2006 ). Recently, we have demonstrated that the lethal hypoglycemia exhibited by SIRT6 deficient mice is caused by an increased glucose uptake in muscle and brown adipose tissue ( Zhong et al., 2010 ). Specifically, SIRT6 co-represses HIF-1α by deacetylating H3K9 at the promoters of several glycolytic genes and, consequently, SIRT6 deficient cells exhibit increased glucose uptake and upregulated glycolysis even under normoxic conditions ( Zhong et al., 2010 ). Such a phenotype, reminiscent of the “Warburg Effect” in tumor cells, prompted us to investigate whether SIRT6 may protect against tumorigenesis by inhibiting glycolytic metabolism.

Here, we demonstrate that SIRT6 is a novel tumor suppressor that regulates aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. Strikingly, SIRT6 acts as a first hit tumor suppressor and lack of this chromatin factor leads to tumor formation even in non-transformed cells. Notably, inhibition of glycolysis in SIRT6 deficient cells completely rescues their tumorigenic potential, suggesting that enhanced glycolysis is the driving force for tumorigenesis in these cells. Furthermore, we provide new data demonstrating that SIRT6 regulates cell proliferation by acting as a co-repressor of c-Myc, inhibiting the expression of ribosomal genes. Finally, SIRT6 expression is downregulated in human cancers, strongly reinforcing the idea that SIRT6 is a novel tumor suppressor.

DISCUSSION

The data presented here reveals a novel role for SIRT6 as a tumor suppressor. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as data from several human cancer databases, we have demonstrated that loss of SIRT6 leads to tumorigenesis and its expression is selectively downregulated in several human cancers. Mechanistically, SIRT6 represses aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) dampening cancer initiation and growth. Moreover, we describe a key role of this sirtuin in controlling cancer cell proliferation by co-repressing MYC transcriptional activity and the expression of ribosomal genes.

Given their absolute dependency on NAD + , sirtuins have evolved as critical modulators of stress responses, DNA repair and metabolism, sensing changes in metabolic cues in order to exert adaptive responses ( Finkel et al., 2009 ). In this context, these proteins represent good candidates to control tumorigenesis and cancer growth. Indeed, SIRT1, SIRT2 and SIRT3 have been described to have tumor suppressive activity by controlling genomic stability and cellular metabolism ( Kim et al., 2011 ; Martinez-Pastor and Mostoslavsky, 2012). Here, we show that SIRT6 functions as a first-hit tumor suppressor, and lack of this chromatin factor leads to tumor initiation and growth. Several lines of evidence support this model. First, SIRT6 deficiency, even in non-transformed cells, causes tumorigenesis ( Figure 1C ). Importantly, this appears to be specific to SIRT6, since the tumor suppressive effect of other sirtuins has been observed only in transformed cells ( Bell et al., 2011 ; Fang and Nicholl, 2011; Finley et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011 ). Although immortalized SIRT2-deficient cells also exhibit tumorigenic potential ( Kim et al., 2011 ), this phenotype might be related to the accumulation of genomic instability in these cells, leading to the activation of oncogenic signals, a phenotype not observed in Sirt6 KO cells (as discussed below). Second, SIRT6 deficiency promotes tumor growth in transformed cells (H-RasV12/shp53) ( Figure 1F ), indicating that SIRT6 is also controlling the proliferation of cancer cells. Third, SIRT6 gene copy number, as well as mRNA expression, are downregulated in several human cancer databases ( Figure 6 ), arguing for a positive selection within the tumor for cells that exhibit low levels of SIRT6. Strikingly, analysis of colon carcinomas from patients followed over a span of eleven years showed that low levels of SIRT6 correlated with shorter relapse even in more aggressive tumors. Finally, deletion of SIRT6 in an in vivo model of colon carcinoma increases adenoma number and size and, strikingly, promotes aggressiveness ( Figure 7 ), fully confirming the role of SIRT6 as a tumor suppressor. Interestingly, it has been shown that male mice overexpressing SIRT6 have increased lifespan compared to control animals ( Kanfi et al., 2012 ). Our results, in combination with those of Kanfi et al, suggest that SIRT6 overexpression may extend lifespan at least in part by acting as a tumor suppressor. In contrast, a decline in NAD + levels during aging could potentially decrease SIRT6 activity, thus leading to increased susceptibility to tumor formation.

SIRT6 is a chromatin-bound factor that was first described as a suppressor of genomic instability by promoting base excision DNA repair (BER) ( Mostoslavsky et al., 2006 ). Recent studies have demonstrated that SIRT6 is involved in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by regulating the activity of C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) interacting protein (CtIP) ( Kaidi et al., 2010 ) and poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) ( Mao et al., 2011 ), further supporting a role for SIRT6 as a key DNA repair factor. Genomic instability is a known characteristic of cancer cells. Surprisingly, our data indicate that chromosome instability likely does not account for the increased tumorigenic potential in SIRT6-deficient cells, since reintroduction of SIRT6 in Sirt6 KO cells completely abolishes tumor formation ( Figure 1D ). Furthermore, we have not observed activation of known oncogenic pathways in SIRT6-deficient cells ( Figure 3A ). Although we cannot rule out activation of other signaling pathways, our data strongly suggest that the genomic instability observed in SIRT6-deficient cells is not the major driving force for tumorigenesis in this setting.

We have recently shown that SIRT6 is a master regulator of glucose homeostasis ( Zhong et al., 2010 ). Here, we further extend these observations and demonstrate that SIRT6 represses tumorigenesis by inhibiting a glycolytic switch (Warburg effect), recently proposed as a “new hallmark” of cancer cells ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2012 ; Ward and Thompson, 2012 ). In support of this model, we have found that, similar to what we observe in normal cells ( Zhong et al., 2010 ), SIRT6 deficiency in transformed cells also increases aerobic glycolytic metabolism, and such effect is specifically selected by cancer cells in order to proliferate ( Figure 2E and Figure S2 ). This phenotype is likely HIF-1α-dependent, as previously described ( Zhong et al., 2010 ). However, pinpointing its precise contribution to the glycolytic phenotype observed in SIRT6 KO transformed cells may be difficult. HIF-1α is involved in multiple processes -besides controlling glycolysis- that may impact in tumorigenesis. Moreover, HIF-1α and HIF-2α have overlapping functions, and how these two factors influence tumorigenesis remains still highly controversial ( Keith et al., 2012 ). Interestingly, SIRT3 has been also described as a tumor suppressor regulating mitochondrial ROS production and, indirectly, HIF-1α stability and aerobic glycolysis (Finley et al., 2011; Bell et al., 2011 ; Kim et al., 2010b ). However, SIRT6 expression is not downregulated in human breast cancers with low levels of SIRT3 (Finley et al., 2011) ( Figure S6E ), suggesting that loss of expression of these two sirtuins might be mutually exclusive in the context of human cancer. Importantly, the role of Sirt3 as a tumor suppressor regulating aerobic glycolysis is only observed in already transformed cells (Finley et al., 2011), whereas activation of this glycolytic switch in non-transformed SIRT6-deficient cells also leads to tumor formation in vivo . Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of glycolysis -by means of knocking-down Pdk1 and inhibiting PDK1 activity- completely inhibited tumor formation in the context of SIRT6 deficiency ( Figure 3G and 7I ), confirming that increased aerobic glycolysis is the driving force for tumorigenesis in SIRT6-deficient cells (and further arguing against a mutator phenotype behind this phenotype). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that SIRT6 deficiency promotes both tumor establishment and progression by modulating glucose metabolism. Further supporting this idea, SIRT6 levels are downregulated in pancreatic and colon premalignant lesions ( Figure S6C and S6D ) and low SIRT6 expression is selectively maintained in late stages of colon cancer ( Figure 6E ). Interestingly, SIRT1 has also been involved in colorectal cancer by modulating the activity of β-catenin ( Firestein et al., 2008 ), suggesting that sirtuins might have evolved to regulate different aspects of the tumorigenic process.

In addition to controlling glucose metabolism in cancer cells, our current work unravels a novel function of SIRT6 as a regulator of ribosomal gene expression. One of the main features of cancer cells is their high proliferative potential. In order to proliferate, cancer cells readjust their metabolism to generate biosynthetic precursors for macromolecular synthesis ( Deberardinis et al., 2008 ). However, protein synthesis also requires the activation of a transcriptional program leading to ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation ( van Riggelen et al., 2010 ). As a master regulator of cell proliferation, MYC regulates ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis by controlling the transcription and assembly of ribosome components as well as translation initiation ( Dang et al., 2012 ; van Riggelen et al., 2010 ). Our results show that SIRT6 specifically regulates the expression of ribosomal genes. In keeping with this, SIRT6-deficient tumor cells exhibit high levels of ribosomal protein gene expression. Beyond ribosome biosynthesis, MYC regulates glucose and glutamine metabolism ( Dang et al., 2012 ). Our results show that glutamine - but not glucose - metabolism is rescued in SIRT6-deficient/MYC knockdown cells, suggesting that SIRT6 and MYC might have redundant roles in regulating glucose metabolism.

Overall, our results indicate that SIRT6 represses tumorigenesis by inhibiting a glycolytic switch required for cancer cell proliferation. Inhibition of glycolysis in SIRT6-deficient cells abrogates tumor formation, providing proof of concept that inhibition of glycolytic metabolism in tumors with low SIRT6 levels could provide putative alternative approaches to modulate cancer growth. Furthermore, we uncover a new role for SIRT6 as a regulator of ribosome biosynthesis by co-repressing MYC transcriptional activity. Our results indicate that SIRT6 sits at a critical metabolic node, modulating both glycolytic metabolism and ribosome biosynthesis ( Figure 7L ). SIRT6 deficiency deregulates both pathways, leading to robust metabolic reprogramming that is sufficient to promote tumorigenesis bypassing major oncogenic signaling pathway activation.
