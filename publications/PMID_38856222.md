SUMMARYNucleotide-derived second messengers are present in all domains of life. 
In prokaryotes, most of their functionality is associated with general lifestyle 
and metabolic adaptations, often in response to environmental fluctuations of 
physical parameters. In the last two decades, cyclic di-AMP has emerged as an 
important signaling nucleotide in many prokaryotic lineages, including 
Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. Its importance is highlighted by 
the fact that both the lack and overproduction of cyclic di-AMP affect viability 
of prokaryotes that utilize cyclic di-AMP, and that it generates a strong innate 
immune response in eukaryotes. In bacteria that produce the second messenger, 
most molecular targets of cyclic di-AMP are associated with cell volume control. 
Besides, other evidence links the second messenger to cell wall remodeling, DNA 
damage repair, sporulation, central metabolism, and the regulation of glycogen 
turnover. In this review, we take a biochemical, quantitative approach to 
address the main cellular processes that are directly regulated by cyclic di-AMP 
and show that these processes are very connected and require regulation of a 
similar set of proteins to which cyclic di-AMP binds. Altogether, we argue that 
cyclic di-AMP is a master regulator of cell volume and that other cellular 
processes can be connected with cyclic di-AMP through this core function. We 
further highlight important directions in which the cyclic di-AMP field has to 
develop to gain a full understanding of the cyclic di-AMP signaling network and 
why some processes are regulated, while others are not.
