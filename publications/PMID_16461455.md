The SWIRM domain is a module found in the Swi3 and Rsc8 subunits of 
SWI/SNF-family chromatin remodeling complexes, and the Ada2 and BHC110/LSD1 
subunits of chromatin modification complexes. Here we report the high-resolution 
crystal structure of the SWIRM domain from Swi3 and characterize the in vitro 
and in vivo function of the SWIRM domains from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Swi3 and 
Rsc8. The Swi3 SWIRM forms a four-helix bundle containing a pseudo 2-fold axis 
and a helix-turn-helix motif commonly found in DNA-binding proteins. We show 
that the Swi3 SWIRM binds free DNA and mononucleosomes with high and comparable 
affinity and that a subset of Swi3 substitution mutants that display growth 
defects in vivo also show impaired DNA-binding activity in vitro, consistent 
with a nucleosome targeting function of this domain. Genetic and biochemical 
studies also reveal that the Rsc8 and Swi3 SWIRM domains are essential for the 
proper assembly and in vivo functions of their respective complexes. Together, 
these studies identify the SWIRM domain as an essential multifunctional module 
for the regulation of gene expression.
