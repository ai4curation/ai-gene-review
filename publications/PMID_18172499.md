NUMB is a cell fate determinant, which, by asymmetrically partitioning at 
mitosis, controls cell fate choices by antagonising the activity of the plasma 
membrane receptor of the NOTCH family. NUMB is also an endocytic protein, and 
the NOTCH-NUMB counteraction has been linked to this function. There might be, 
however, additional functions of NUMB, as witnessed by its proposed role as a 
tumour suppressor in breast cancer. Here we describe a previously unknown 
function for human NUMB as a regulator of tumour protein p53 (also known as 
TP53). NUMB enters in a tricomplex with p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2 
(also known as MDM2), thereby preventing ubiquitination and degradation of p53. 
This results in increased p53 protein levels and activity, and in regulation of 
p53-dependent phenotypes. In breast cancers there is frequent loss of NUMB 
expression. We show that, in primary breast tumour cells, this event causes 
decreased p53 levels and increased chemoresistance. In breast cancers, loss of 
NUMB expression causes increased activity of the receptor NOTCH. Thus, in these 
cancers, a single event-loss of NUMB expression-determines activation of an 
oncogene (NOTCH) and attenuation of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway. 
Biologically, this results in an aggressive tumour phenotype, as witnessed by 
findings that NUMB-defective breast tumours display poor prognosis. Our results 
uncover a previously unknown tumour suppressor circuitry.
