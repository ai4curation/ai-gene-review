The protooncogene bcl-2 rescues cells from a wide variety of insults. Recent 
evidence suggests that the mechanism of action of Bcl-2 involves antioxidant 
activity. The involvement of free radicals in ischemia/reperfusion injury to 
neural cells has led us to investigate the effect of Bcl-2 in a model of delayed 
neural cell death. We have examined the survival of control and bcl-2 
transfectants of a hypothalamic tumor cell line, GT1-7, exposed to potassium 
cyanide in the absence of glucose (chemical hypoxia/aglycemia). After 30 min of 
treatment, no loss of viability was evident in control or bcl-2 transfectants; 
however, Bcl-2-expressing cells were protected from delayed cell death measured 
following 24-72 h of reoxygenation. Under these conditions, the rate and extent 
of ATP depletion in response to treatment with cyanide in the absence of glucose 
and the rate of recovery of ATP during reenergization were similar in control 
and Bcl-2-expressing cells. Bcl-2-expressing cells were protected from oxidative 
damage resulting from this treatment, as indicated by significantly lower levels 
of oxidized lipids. Mitochondrial respiration in control but not 
Bcl-2-expressing cells was compromised immediately following hypoxic treatment. 
These results indicate that Bcl-2 can protect neural cells from delayed death 
resulting from chemical hypoxia and reenergization, and may do so by an 
antioxidant mechanism. The results thereby provide evidence that Bcl-2 or a 
Bcl-2 mimetic has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of 
neuropathologies involving oxidative stress, including focal and global cerebral 
ischemia.
