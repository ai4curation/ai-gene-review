Macrophage lineage cells such as osteoclasts and foreign body giant cells 
(FBGCs) form multinuclear cells by cell-cell fusion of mononuclear cells. 
Recently, we reported that two seven-transmembrane molecules, osteoclast 
stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP) and dendritic cell-specific 
transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), were essential for osteoclast and FBGC 
cell-cell fusion in vivo and in vitro. However, signaling required to regulate 
FBGC fusion remained largely unknown. Here, we show that signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) deficiency in macrophages enhanced 
cell-cell fusion and elevated DC-STAMP expression in FBGCs. By contrast, lack of 
STAT6 increased STAT1 activation, significantly inhibiting cell-cell fusion and 
decreasing OC-STAMP and DC-STAMP expression in IL-4-induced FBGCs. Furthermore, 
either STAT1 loss or co-expression of OC-STAMP/DC-STAMP was sufficient to induce 
cell-cell fusion of FBGCs without IL-4. We conclude that the STAT6-STAT1 axis 
regulates OC-STAMP and DC-STAMP expression and governs fusogenic mechanisms in 
FBGCs.
