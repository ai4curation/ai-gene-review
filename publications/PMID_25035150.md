RATIONALE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a novel class of noncoding 
RNAs that regulate gene expression. Although recent data suggest that lncRNAs 
may be associated with cardiac disease, little is known about lncRNAs in the 
setting of myocardial ischemia.
OBJECTIVE: To measure lncRNAs in patients with myocardial infarction (MI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 414 patients with acute MI treated by primary 
percutaneous coronary intervention. Blood samples were harvested at the time of 
reperfusion. Expression levels of 5 lncRNAs were measured in peripheral blood 
cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction: hypoxia inducible factor 1A 
antisense RNA 2, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B antisense RNA 1 (ANRIL), 
potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1 opposite 
strand/antisense transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1), myocardial infarction-associated 
transcript, and metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1. Levels 
of hypoxia inducible factor 1A antisense RNA 2, KCNQ1OT1, and 
metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 were higher in patients 
with MI than in healthy volunteers (P<0.01), and levels of ANRIL were lower in 
patients with MI (P=0.003). Patients with ST-segment-elevation MI had lower 
levels of ANRIL (P<0.001), KCNQ1OT1 (P<0.001), myocardial infarction-associated 
transcript (P<0.001), and metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 
(P=0.005) when compared with patients with non-ST-segment-elevation MI. Levels 
of ANRIL were associated with age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Patients 
presenting within 3 hours of chest pain onset had elevated levels of hypoxia 
inducible factor 1A antisense RNA 2 when compared with patients presenting later 
on. ANRIL, KCNQ1OT1, myocardial infarction-associated transcript, and 
metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 were significant 
univariable predictors of left ventricular dysfunction as assessed by an 
ejection fraction ≤40% at 4-month follow-up. In multivariable and 
reclassification analyses, ANRIL and KCNQ1OT1 improved the prediction of left 
ventricular dysfunction by a model, including demographic features, clinical 
parameters, and cardiac biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of lncRNAs in blood cells are regulated after MI and may 
help in prediction of outcome. This motivates further investigation of the role 
of lncRNAs after MI.
