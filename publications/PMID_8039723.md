A human cDNA that encodes a polypeptide that has 94% deduced amino-acid sequence 
identity to porcine phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase was cloned 
from a testis library. The sequence shows preservation of the UGA selenocysteine 
codon, putative active-site Trp and Glu residues and a Tyr residue that is 
phosphorylated in the porcine protein. The 3'-UTR shows some conservation of 
sequences implicated in the insertion of selenocysteine at an opal codon in 
human glutathione peroxidase-1.
