This study identified CD63, a member of the tetraspanin family, as a TIMP-1 
interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. Immunoprecipitation and 
confocal microscopic analysis confirmed CD63 interactions with TIMP-1, integrin 
beta1, and their co-localizations on the cell surface of human breast epithelial 
MCF10A cells. TIMP-1 expression correlated with the level of active integrin 
beta1 on the cell surface independent of cell adhesion. While MCF10A cells 
within a three-dimensional (3D) matrigel matrix form polarized acinar-like 
structures, TIMP-1 overexpression disrupted breast epithelial cell polarization 
and inhibited caspase-mediated apoptosis in centrally located cells, necessary 
for the formation and maintenance of the hollow acinar-like structures. Small 
hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated CD63 downregulation effectively reduced TIMP-1 
binding to the cell surface, TIMP-1 co-localization with integrin beta1, and 
consequently reversed TIMP-1-mediated integrin beta1 activation, cell survival 
signaling and apoptosis inhibition. CD63 downregulation also restored 
polarization and apoptosis of TIMP-1 overexpressing MCF10A cells within a 
3D-matrigel matrix. Taken together, the present study identified CD63 as a cell 
surface binding partner for TIMP-1, regulating cell survival and polarization 
via TIMP-1 modulation of tetraspanin/integrin signaling complex.
