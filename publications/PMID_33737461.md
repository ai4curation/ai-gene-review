Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunoregulatory cytokine with both 
anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory properties and is frequently 
dysregulated in disease. We used a structure-based approach to deconvolute IL-10 
pleiotropy by determining the structure of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) complex 
by cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.5 angstroms. The hexameric 
structure shows how IL-10 and IL-10Rα form a composite surface to engage the 
shared signaling receptor IL-10Rβ, enabling the design of partial agonists. 
IL-10 variants with a range of IL-10Rβ binding strengths uncovered substantial 
differences in response thresholds across immune cell populations, providing a 
means of manipulating IL-10 cell type selectivity. Some variants displayed 
myeloid-biased activity by suppressing macrophage activation without stimulating 
inflammatory CD8+ T cells, thereby uncoupling the major opposing functions of 
IL-10. These results provide a mechanistic blueprint for tuning the pleiotropic 
actions of IL-10.
