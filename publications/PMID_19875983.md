To cover the receptive field completely and non-redundantly, neurons of certain 
functional groups arrange tiling of their dendrites. In Drosophila class IV 
dendrite arborization (da) neurons, the NDR family kinase Tricornered (Trc) is 
required for homotypic repulsion of dendrites that facilitates dendritic tiling. 
We here report that Sin1, Rictor, and target of rapamycin (TOR), components of 
the TOR complex 2 (TORC2), are required for dendritic tiling of class IV da 
neurons. Similar to trc mutants, dendrites of sin1 and rictor mutants show 
inappropriate overlap of the dendritic fields. TORC2 components physically and 
genetically interact with Trc, consistent with a shared role in regulating 
dendritic tiling. Moreover, TORC2 is essential for Trc phosphorylation on a 
residue that is critical for Trc activity in vivo and in vitro. Remarkably, 
neuronal expression of a dominant active form of Trc rescues the tiling defects 
in sin1 and rictor mutants. These findings suggest that TORC2 likely acts 
together with the Trc signalling pathway to regulate the dendritic tiling of 
class IV da neurons, and thus uncover the first neuronal function of TORC2 in 
vivo.
