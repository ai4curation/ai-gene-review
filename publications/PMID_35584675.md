The evolution of zinc (Zn) as a protein cofactor altered the functional 
landscape of biology, but dependency on Zn also created an Achilles' heel, 
necessitating adaptive mechanisms to ensure Zn availability to proteins. A 
debated strategy is whether metallochaperones exist to prioritize essential 
Zn-dependent proteins. Here, we present evidence for a conserved family of 
putative metal transferases in human and fungi, which interact with Zn-dependent 
methionine aminopeptidase type I (MetAP1/Map1p/Fma1). Deletion of the putative 
metal transferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ZNG1; formerly YNR029c) leads to 
defective Map1p function and a Zn-deficiency growth defect. In vitro, Zng1p can 
transfer Zn2+ or Co2+ to apo-Map1p, but unlike characterized copper chaperones, 
transfer is dependent on GTP hydrolysis. Proteomics reveal mis-regulation of the 
Zap1p transcription factor regulon because of loss of ZNG1 and Map1p activity, 
suggesting that Zng1p is required to avoid a compounding effect of Map1p 
dysfunction on survival during Zn limitation.
