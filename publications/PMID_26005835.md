The character of EGFR signals can influence cell fate but mechanistic insights 
into intestinal EGFR-Ras signalling are limited. Here we show that two distinct 
Ras nucleotide exchange factors, RasGRP1 and SOS1, lie downstream of EGFR but 
act in functional opposition. RasGRP1 is expressed in intestinal crypts where it 
restricts epithelial growth. High RasGRP1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
patient samples correlates with a better clinical outcome. Biochemically, we 
find that RasGRP1 creates a negative feedback loop that limits proliferative 
EGFR-SOS1-Ras signals in CRC cells. Genetic Rasgrp1 depletion from mice with 
either an activating mutation in KRas or with aberrant Wnt signalling due to a 
mutation in Apc resulted in both cases in exacerbated Ras-ERK signalling and 
cell proliferation. The unexpected opposing cell biological effects of 
EGFR-RasGRP1 and EGFR-SOS1 signals in the same cell shed light on the intricacy 
of EGFR-Ras signalling in normal epithelium and carcinoma.

Abstract

The character of EGFR signals can influence cell fate but mechanistic insights into intestinal EGFR-Ras signalling are limited. Here we show that two distinct Ras nucleotide exchange factors, RasGRP1 and SOS1, lie downstream of EGFR but act in functional opposition. RasGRP1 is expressed in intestinal crypts where it restricts epithelial growth. High RasGRP1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) patient samples correlates with a better clinical outcome. Biochemically, we find that RasGRP1 creates a negative feedback loop that limits proliferative EGFR–SOS1–Ras signals in CRC cells. Genetic Rasgrp1 depletion from mice with either an activating mutation in KRas or with aberrant Wnt signalling due to a mutation in Apc resulted in both cases in exacerbated Ras–ERK signalling and cell proliferation. The unexpected opposing cell biological effects of EGFR–RasGRP1 and EGFR–SOS1 signals in the same cell shed light on the intricacy of EGFR-Ras signalling in normal epithelium and carcinoma.

DISCUSSION

Here we revealed that RasGRP1 and SOS1, two structurally distinct RasGEFs (refs 19 , 22 ), both lie downstream of EGFR. Reduction of RasGRP1 levels relieves the negative feedback to EGFR-SOS1, sustains EGFR-RAS-ERK signalling, and promotes cell proliferation. We find that RasGRP1 plays a negative regulatory role in CRC and that depletion of Rasgrp1 alleles exacerbates ERK signalling and serrated dysplasia and hyperproliferation of the KRas G12D intestinal epithelium. KRas G12D alone does not lead to full CRC in mice 34 – 36 . Consistent with the conclusion that perturbed Ras function by itself is insufficient to produce CRC, we did not observe high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinomas in KRas G12D :Rasgrp1 WT /− and KRas G12D :Rasgrp1 −/− mice that were up to 9 months of age. Epithelial cells in these two models return to the normal simple columnar pattern further up the villus, despite the severely altered T/A zone, and loss of Rasgrp1 results in increased levels of cell apoptosis. For full CRC to develop in mice, KRas G12D requires additional events such as loss of the APC tumour suppressor 35 . Vice versa, perturbation of APC requires EGFR signalling for tumour maintenance 53 , 54 . In agreement with the concept that these two pathways intersect in CRC, we observe that loss of Rasgrp1 in addition to the Apc Min /+ allele leads to increases in colonic tumour numbers and sizes and reduced mean survival of Apc Min /+ :Rasgrp1 −/− mice.

RasGRP3 seems to connect to cMET(HGF)- signal input 55 . Our results here show that RasGRP1 responds to EGFR signal input. Thus, RasGRP RasGEFs can couple to receptor tyrosine kinases but the mechanistic details and the biological consequences are not yet fully understood. RasGRP3 promotes growth of melanoma- and prostate-cancer cells 55 , 56 whereas our findings here demonstrate that RasGRP1 opposes CRC growth. The suppressive function of RasGRP1 in CRC also contrasts its growth-promoting role in T-cell leukaemia 27 and in skin cancer 57 . Thus, not all RasGRP1-generated Ras signals are the same and RasGRP1 may function as a context-dependent tumour-suppressor protein or a protein with oncogenic functions.

Here we revealed non-intuitive feedback between two RasGEFs; that is, EGFR-RasGRP1 signals that dampen EGFR-SOS signals. Grb2 can impair access of phosphatases to the FGFR (refs 58 , 59 ). Possibly, RasGRP1 indirectly promotes phosphatase access to EGFR, reducing Grb2-SOS1-P-Y 1068 -EGFR complexes. Alternatively, EGFR-RasGRP1 may influence phosphatase function directly. The phosphatase Cdc25A binds to and dephosphorylates EGFR (ref. 60 ). Interestingly, vemurafenib (PLX4032) treatment of CRC cells with somatic BRAF(V600E) was recently shown to relieve a negative feedback loop to EGFR by decreasing the activity of the phosphatase Cdc25C, resulting in increased P-Y 1068 -EGFR levels 61 . It is of interest to note that somatic KRAS MUT emerge as mediators of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy 62 , 63 . Possibly anti-EGFR therapy inhibits the negative feedback coming from EGFR-RasGRP1 signals.
