Expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats that encode polyglutamine is the 
underlying cause of at least nine inherited human neurodegenerative disorders, 
including Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias. PolyQ fragments 
accumulate as aggregates in the cytoplasm and/or in the nucleus, and induce 
neuronal cell death. However, the molecular mechanism of polyQ-induced cell 
death is controversial. Here, we show the following: (1) polyQ with pathogenic 
repeat length triggers ER stress through proteasomal dysfunction; (2) ER stress 
activates ASK 1 through formation of an IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 complex; and (3) 
ASK1(-/-) primary neurons are defective in polyQ-, proteasome inhibitor-, and ER 
stress-induced JNK activation and cell death. These findings suggest that ASK1 
is a key element in ER stress-induced cell death that plays an important role in 
the neuropathological alterations in polyQ diseases.
