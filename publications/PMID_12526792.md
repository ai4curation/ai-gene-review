The role of cytosolic factors in protein targeting to mitochondria is poorly 
understood. Here, we show that in mammals, the cytosolic chaperones Hsp90 and 
Hsp70 dock onto a specialized TPR domain in the import receptor Tom70 at the 
outer mitochondrial membrane. This interaction serves to deliver a set of 
preproteins to the receptor for subsequent membrane translocation dependent on 
the Hsp90 ATPase. Disruption of the chaperone/Tom70 recognition inhibits the 
import of these preproteins into mitochondria. In yeast, Hsp70 rather than Hsp90 
is used in import, and Hsp70 docking is required for the formation of a 
productive preprotein/Tom70 complex. We outline a novel mechanism in which 
chaperones are recruited for a specific targeting event by a membrane-bound 
receptor.
