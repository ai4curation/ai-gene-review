Eukaryotic cells use autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) as 
their major protein degradation pathways. Whereas the UPS is required for the 
rapid degradation of proteins when fast adaptation is needed, autophagy pathways 
selectively remove protein aggregates and damaged or excess organelles. However, 
little is known about the targets and mechanisms that provide specificity to 
this process. Here we show that mature ribosomes are rapidly degraded by 
autophagy upon nutrient starvation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Surprisingly, 
this degradation not only occurs by a non-selective mechanism, but also involves 
a novel type of selective autophagy, which we term 'ribophagy'. A genetic screen 
revealed that selective degradation of ribosomes requires catalytic activity of 
the Ubp3p/Bre5p ubiquitin protease. Although ubp3Delta and bre5Delta cells 
strongly accumulate 60S ribosomal particles upon starvation, they are proficient 
in starvation sensing and in general trafficking and autophagy pathways. 
Moreover, ubiquitination of several ribosomal subunits and/or 
ribosome-associated proteins was specifically enriched in ubp3Delta cells, 
suggesting that the regulation of ribophagy by ubiquitination may be direct. 
Interestingly, ubp3Delta cells are sensitive to rapamycin and nutrient 
starvation, implying that selective degradation of ribosomes is functionally 
important in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest a link between 
ubiquitination and the regulated degradation of mature ribosomes by autophagy.
