Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Short Hypocotyl in White Light1 (SHW1) 
encodes a Ser-Arg-Asp-rich protein that acts as a negative regulator of 
photomorphogenesis. SHW1 and Constitutive Photomorphogenic1 (COP1) genetically 
interact in an additive manner to suppress photomorphogenesis. Elongated 
Hypocotyl5 (HY5) is a photomorphogenesis promoting a basic leucine zipper 
transcription factor that is degraded by COP1 ubiquitin ligase in the darkness. 
Here, we report the functional interrelation of SHW1 with COP1 and HY5 in 
Arabidopsis seedling development. The in vitro and in vivo molecular interaction 
studies show that SHW1 physically interacts with both COP1 and HY5. The genetic 
studies reveal that SHW1 and HY5 work in an antagonistic manner to regulate 
photomorphogenic growth. Additional mutation of SHW1 in hy5 mutant background is 
able to suppress the gravitropic root growth defect of hy5 mutants. This study 
further reveals that the altered abscisic acid responsiveness of hy5 mutants is 
modulated by additional loss of SHW1 function. Furthermore, this study shows 
that SHW1 promotes COP1-mediated degradation of HY5 through enhanced 
ubiquitylation in the darkness. Collectively, this study highlights a 
mechanistic view on coordinated regulation of SHW1, COP1, and HY5 in Arabidopsis 
seedling development.

Abstract

Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) Short Hypocotyl in White Light1 (SHW1) encodes a Ser-Arg-Asp-rich protein that acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis. SHW1 and Constitutive Photomorphogenic1 (COP1) genetically interact in an additive manner to suppress photomorphogenesis. Elongated Hypocotyl5 (HY5) is a photomorphogenesis promoting a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is degraded by COP1 ubiquitin ligase in the darkness. Here, we report the functional interrelation of SHW1 with COP1 and HY5 in Arabidopsis seedling development. The in vitro and in vivo molecular interaction studies show that SHW1 physically interacts with both COP1 and HY5. The genetic studies reveal that SHW1 and HY5 work in an antagonistic manner to regulate photomorphogenic growth. Additional mutation of SHW1 in hy5 mutant background is able to suppress the gravitropic root growth defect of hy5 mutants. This study further reveals that the altered abscisic acid responsiveness of hy5 mutants is modulated by additional loss of SHW1 function. Furthermore, this study shows that SHW1 promotes COP1-mediated degradation of HY5 through enhanced ubiquitylation in the darkness. Collectively, this study highlights a mechanistic view on coordinated regulation of SHW1, COP1, and HY5 in Arabidopsis seedling development.

DISCUSSION

This study provides evidence that SHW1, a unique negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, works in concert with COP1 ubiquitin ligase and promotes the degradation of HY5 in the darkness to suppress photomorphogenesis. Several lines of experimental evidences, including protein-protein interactions by two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays, show the physical interactions of SHW1 with both HY5 and COP1 proteins. The shw1 cop1 double mutant has earlier been shown to display increased photomorphogenic growth compared with cop1 single mutants in the dark ( Bhatia et al., 2008 ). One plausible mechanism of such genetic and physical interaction of SHW1 with COP1 may be that it controls the COP1-mediated degradation of HY5. Indeed, the level of accumulation of HY5 protein in shw1 cop1 double mutant is increased compared with cop1 mutants in dark-grown seedlings. Furthermore, COP1-mediated ubiquitination of HY5 protein has been enhanced in the presence of SHW1. The higher level of accumulation of HY5 protein in shw1 cop1 double mutant than cop1 mutant alone thereby explains the enhanced photomorphogenic growth of shw1 cop1 double mutants in the darkness.

Negative regulators play important roles in light signaling pathways ( Kim et al., 2003 ; Jiao et al., 2007 ; Lau and Deng, 2012 ; Li et al., 2015 ). COP1 is an essential suppresser of photomorphogenesis in dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. COP1 and its interacting partners, SPA proteins, have been shown to establish the skotomorphogenesis in the darkness and prevent hyperphotomorphogenic growth in light-grown seedlings ( Hoecker et al., 1998 ; Laubinger and Hoecker, 2003 ; Saijo et al., 2003 ; Seo et al., 2003 ). However, whereas mutation in any single SPA gene family member does not display any morphological defects in the darkness, shw1 mutants show partial photomorphogenic growth in the darkness. After all four SPA genes are mutated, the quadruple mutant shows strong phenotype similar to cop1 ( Laubinger et al., 2004 ). Recent studies have shown that PIF1 promotes COP1-mediated degradation of HY5 ( Xu et al., 2014a, 2014b ).

To analyze the physiological significance of the observed protein-protein interactions between SHW1 and HY5, the genetic interactions between these two respective genes were analyzed. These studies have revealed that SHW1 and HY5 act in an antagonistic manner to regulate photomorphogenic growth. The etiolated phenotype of hy5 mutants is partly suppressed in shw1 hy5 double mutants in WL . Although shw1 mutants do not display any significant difference in hypocotyl length in RL , FR light, or BL compared with wild-type background, the additional mutation in SHW1 in hy5 mutant was able to partly suppress the hy5 mutant phenotype in RL and BL . These results establish that SHW1 and HY5 act antagonistically with each other to regulate photomorphogenic growth in RL and BL conditions. The gravitropic root growth defect of hy5 mutants is also suppressed by additional loss of function of SHW1 . Although Bhatia et al. (2008) did not find any significant change in root length in shw1 mutants, careful examination in this study revealed that, although not drastic, shw1 mutants indeed display significantly shorter root length than wild-type plants.

Cross talk of light signaling pathways with other signaling cascades has been shown ( Boter et al., 2004 ; Lorenzo et al., 2004 ; Yadav et al., 2005 ; Henriques et al., 2009 ; Huang et al., 2014 ). Both shw1 and hy5 mutants display less sensitivity to ABA -mediated inhibition of seed germination. This individual effect on ABA responsiveness on seed germination has been enhanced in shw1 hy5 double mutants. Therefore, although SHW1 and HY5 work in an antagonistic manner in photomorphogenic growth, these two proteins function nonredundantly to regulate ABA -mediated inhibition of seed germination. Several reports have earlier shown the differential regulation of a gene in two different signaling pathways ( Anderson et al., 2004 ; Kazan and Manners, 2008 ). MYC2 works as a negative regulator of light signaling pathways ( Yadav et al., 2005 ; Gangappa et al., 2010; Sethi et al., 2014 ). However, it works as both positive and negative regulators of jasmonic acid signaling pathways ( Dombrecht et al., 2007 ; Kazan and Manners 2008, 2013 ). Furthermore, differential genetic interaction of HY5 and GBF1 has been shown to work in a light intensity-dependent manner ( Singh et al., 2012 ). Recent studies have revealed the cross talk between light and temperature signaling pathways ( Delker et al., 2014 ; Johansson et al., 2014 ; Toledo-Ortiz et al., 2014 ). It would be interesting to investigate the possible involvement of SHW1 and HY5 in temperature signaling pathways. Furthermore, it would also be interesting to determine the possible involvement of SHW1, as an associated factor of COP1, in COP1-mediated proteasomal degradation of other photomorphogenesis-promoting factors, such as HYH, HFR1, and LAF1, in future studies.
