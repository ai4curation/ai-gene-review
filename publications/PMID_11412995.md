BACKGROUND: Position-dependent gene silencing in yeast involves many factors, 
including the four HIR genes and nucleosome assembly proteins Asf1p and 
chromatin assembly factor I (CAF-I, encoded by the CAC1-3 genes). Both cac Delta 
asfl Delta and cac Delta hir Delta double mutants display synergistic reductions 
in heterochromatic gene silencing. However, the relationship between the 
contributions of HIR genes and ASF1 to silencing has not previously been 
explored.
RESULTS: Our biochemical and genetic studies of yeast Asf1p revealed links to 
Hir protein function. In vitro, an active histone deposition complex was formed 
from recombinant yeast Asf1p and histones H3 and H4 that lack a newly 
synthesized acetylation pattern. This Asf1p/H3/H4 complex generated micrococcal 
nuclease--resistant DNA in the absence of DNA replication and stimulated 
nucleosome assembly activity by recombinant yeast CAF-I during DNA synthesis. 
Also, Asf1p bound to the Hir1p and Hir2p proteins in vitro and in cell extracts. 
In vivo, the HIR1 and ASF1 genes contributed to silencing the heterochromatic 
HML locus via the same genetic pathway. Deletion of either HIR1 or ASF1 
eliminated telomeric gene silencing in combination with pol30--8, encoding an 
altered form of the DNA polymerase processivity factor PCNA that prevents CAF-I 
from contributing to silencing. Conversely, other pol30 alleles prevented 
Asf1/Hir proteins from contributing to silencing.
CONCLUSIONS: Yeast CAF-I and Asf1p cooperate to form nucleosomes in vitro. In 
vivo, Asf1p and Hir proteins physically interact and together promote 
heterochromatic gene silencing in a manner requiring PCNA. This Asf1/Hir 
silencing pathway functionally overlaps with CAF-I activity.
