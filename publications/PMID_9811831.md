Since their discovery, protein tyrosine phosphatases have been speculated to

growth-promoting protein tyrosine kinases. Recently, a tumor suppressor from 
human chromosome 10q23, called PTEN or MMAC1, has been identified that shares

mutation in PTEN, PTEN-G129E, which is observed in two Cowden disease kindreds, 
specifically ablates the ability of PTEN to recognize inositol phospholipids as 
a substrate, suggesting that loss of the lipid phosphatase activity is

Abstract

Since their discovery, protein tyrosine phosphatases have been speculated to play a role in tumor suppression because of their ability to antagonize the growth-promoting protein tyrosine kinases. Recently, a tumor suppressor from human chromosome 10q23, called PTEN or MMAC1, has been identified that shares homology with the protein tyrosine phosphatase family. Germ-line mutations in PTEN give rise to several related neoplastic disorders, including Cowden disease. A key step in understanding the function of PTEN as a tumor suppressor is to identify its physiological substrates. Here we report that a missense mutation in PTEN, PTEN-G129E, which is observed in two Cowden disease kindreds, specifically ablates the ability of PTEN to recognize inositol phospholipids as a substrate, suggesting that loss of the lipid phosphatase activity is responsible for the etiology of the disease. Furthermore, expression of wild-type or substrate-trapping forms of PTEN in HEK293 cells altered the levels of the phospholipid products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ectopic expression of the phosphatase in PTEN-deficient tumor cell lines resulted in the inhibition of protein kinase (PK) B/Akt and regulation of cell survival.

DISCUSSION

PTEN is a newly defined tumor-suppressor gene that has been implicated in a wide variety of cancers and in a series of related disorders that are characterized by a predispostion to cancer ( 1 , 2 , 25 – 28 ). Although these studies offer many insights into the biology of PTEN, they do not address the molecular mechanism of PTEN function, which requires the identification of its physiological substrates. However, this has become an area of controversy. Tamura et al. ( 9 ) have suggested that PTEN disrupts cell spreading and migration by dephosphorylating FAK. In contrast, Maehema and Dixon ( 10 ) have shown that, in certain contexts, PTEN can dephosphorylate the lipid second messenger PtdInsP. However, both of these studies fall short of demonstrating that the ability of PTEN to dephosphorylate FAK or PtdInsP is related to its tumor-suppressive function. In light of the facts that previous studies have shown that PTEN prefers highly acidic or multiply phosphorylated substrates ( 11 ) and that FAK and PtdInsP share these properties, one must view these results with caution, as they may result from nonspecific interactions between PTEN and highly charged molecules ( 12 ).

Significantly, we have been able to show that a single point mutation in PTEN, PTEN-G129E, specifically ablates the ability of PTEN to recognize phospholipids as substrates. In contrast, Tamura et al. ( 9 ) found that the PTEN-G129E point mutation behaves essentially like wild-type PTEN in their assays of cell spreading. Even though this mutation does not alter the ability of PTEN to recognize proteinaceous substrates, the fact that it has been identified in two independent Cowden disease kindreds indicates that this mutation would be expected to impair the tumor-suppressor activity of PTEN ( 5 , 11 ). Therefore, these findings demonstrate that the lipid phosphatase activity rather than the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is important for its tumor-suppressive activity and that FAK, at least in this respect, is not a relevant target of the phosphatase.

Characterization of the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN demonstrates that it shows specificity for phosphatidylinositols phosphorylated at the 3 position. This represents the first phosphatidylinositol phosphatase with specificity for the lipid products of PI 3-kinase and suggests that PTEN may function to antagonize the growth-promoting signals generated by PI 3-kinase. Indeed, overexpression of PTEN in mammalian cells disrupted the PI 3-kinase-dependent production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 . Furthermore, expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PTEN, PTEN-C124S, which may function as a substrate trap, results in the accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 , indicating that PTEN may function in vivo to antagonize PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling.

Importantly, signaling downstream of PI 3-kinase is altered in two different glioblastoma cell lines, U87 MG and U373 MG, which have lost expression of PTEN because of mutation or deletion of both alleles. Both cell lines exhibited elevated levels of active, phosphorylated PKB/Akt, a serine/threonine kinase whose activation requires the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 or PtdIns(3,4)P 2 ( 21 , 29 ). Restoration of PTEN expression by retroviral transduction resulted in the reduction of activated PKB/Akt as is evident from the observed reduction in the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and in reduced levels of phosphorylated BAD, an apoptosis regulator that is a known in vivo substrate of PKB/Akt ( 22 ). Significantly, insulin or platelet-derived growth factor stimulation of these cell lines resulted in the stimulation of PKB/Akt regardless of whether PTEN expression had been reconstituted, suggesting that there are mechanisms in place which, in response to growth factor stimulation, serve to regulate the activity of PTEN and allow the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 . This is especially important given that PTEN is widely expressed, including cell lines that produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 in response to insulin.

Although the reconstitution of PTEN decreased the levels of phosphorylated BAD, we were unable to detect evidence of apoptosis in these cell lines. PKB/AKT is thought to affect cell survival in many cell types by phosphorylating BAD or inactivating GSK3β ( 23 , 30 ). Reconstitution of PTEN in LnCaP cells, a PTEN-deficient prostate-cancer cell line, resulted in the inhibition of cell survival. Importantly, expression of the PTEN-G129E Cowden disease point mutation does not result in the abrogation of cell survival. This observation indicates that the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for these effects on cell survival. The properties of the PTEN-G129E mutant emphasize the requirement of the lipid phosphatase activity for the tumor-suppressor function of PTEN. Furthermore, the PTEN-dependent induction of apoptosis was completely inhibited by coexpressing a constitutively active, membrane-targeted form of PKB/Akt indicating that PTEN, by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositides, is an upstream regulator of PKB/Akt and, at least in LNCAP cells, serves to regulate survival signals. Thus, in some cell types, PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor to inhibit the PKB/AKT-dependent survival signals that are activated in response to 3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols.

The failure of PTEN to regulate cell survival in the glioblastoma cell lines suggests that the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates plays other roles during tumor progression. In fact, PI 3-kinase has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes ( 31 ). Therefore, by dephosphorylating the products of PI 3-kinase, PTEN is likely to be involved in the regulation of many of these processes. Significantly, both PI 3-kinase and PKB/Akt have been isolated as transforming oncogenes in retroviruses ( 32 , 33 ). These observations indicate that PI 3-kinase and PKB/Akt function in a signaling pathway promoting growth and survival. Our data demonstrate that PTEN functions to suppress these growth-promoting and survival signals by dephosphorylating the phospholipid products of PI 3-kinase. Our data provide a molecular basis for the development of Cowden disease, as loss of the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN leads to the accumulation of the products of PI 3-kinase and results in the neoplastic pathologies characteristic of the disease.
