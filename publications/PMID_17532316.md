Members of the Wnt family of genes such as Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Wnt7a have been 
implicated in the formation and morphogenesis of the Müllerian duct into various 
parts of the female reproductive tract. These WNT ligands elicit their action 
via either the canonical WNT/beta-catenin or the non-canonical WNT/calcium 
pathway and could possibly function redundantly in Müllerian duct 
differentiation. By using the Müllerian duct-specific anti-Müllerian hormone 
receptor 2 cre (Amhr2-cre) mouse line, we established a conditional knockout 
model that removed beta-catenin specifically in the mesenchyme of the Müllerian 
duct. At birth, loss of beta-catenin in the Müllerian duct mesenchyme disrupted 
the normal coiling of the oviduct in the knockout embryo, resembling the 
phenotype of the Wnt7a knockout. The overall development of the female 
reproductive tract was stunted at birth with a decrease in proliferation in the 
mesenchyme and epithelium. We also discovered that Wnt5a and Wnt7a expression 
remained normal, excluding the possibility that the phenotypes resulted from a 
loss of these WNT ligands. We examined the expression of Frizzled (Fzd), the 
receptors for WNT, and found that Fzd1 is one receptor present in the Müllerian 
duct mesenchyme and could be the putative receptor for beta-catenin activation 
in the Müllerian duct. In summary, our findings suggest that mesenchymal 
beta-catenin is a downstream effector of Wnt7a that mediates the patterning of 
the oviduct and proper differentiation of the uterus.

Members of the Wnt family of genes such as Wnt4, Wnt5a , and Wnt7a have been implicated in the formation and morphogenesis of the Müllerian duct into various parts of the female reproductive tract. These WNT ligands elicit their action via either the canonical WNT/beta-catenin or the non-canonical WNT/Calcium pathway and could possibly function redundantly in Müllerian duct differentiation. By using the Müllerian duct specific anti-Müllerian hormone receptor 2 cre ( Amhr2 -cre) mouse line, we established a conditional knockout model that removed beta-catenin specifically in the mesenchyme of the Müllerian duct. At birth, loss of beta-catenin in the Müllerian duct mesenchyme disrupted the normal coiling of the oviduct in the knockout embryo, resembling the phenotype of the Wnt7a knockout. The overall development of the female reproductive tract was stunted at birth with a decrease in proliferation in the mesenchyme and epithelium.

INTRODUCTION

The Müllerian duct is the embryonic precursor of the female reproductive tract. In the mouse, the Müllerian duct begins to form as an invagination of the surface epithelium of the mesonephros at embryonic day 11.5 or E11.5 and continues to elongate until it reaches the cloaca at E13.5 in both male and female embryos ( Kobayashi and Behringer 2003 ). The transformation of the Müllerian duct into various parts of the female reproductive tract does not occur until later in embryonic development. By two weeks after birth in the mouse, the Müllerian duct has developed rostral-caudally into the oviducts, uterus, cervix, and upper portion of the vagina ( Yin and Ma 2005 ). Formation of the Müllerian duct results from a collective action of transcription factors and signaling molecules including Pax2, Lim1, Emx2 , and Wnt4 ( Torres et al. 1995 ; Kobayashi et al. 2003 ; Miyamoto et al. 1997 ; Vainio et al. 1999 ). In embryos lacking either Pax2, Lim1 , or Emx2 , which are transcription factors expressed in the Müllerian duct epithelium, the Müllerian duct failed to form leading to a complete absence of the female reproductive tract ( Torres et al. 1995 ; Kobayashi et al. 2003 ; Miyamoto et al. 1997 ). Wnt4 , a signaling molecule produced by the Müllerian duct mesenchyme, is also essential for the initial formation of the Müllerian duct ( Vainio et al. 1999 ).

The transformation of the Müllerian duct into distinct structures of the female reproductive tract also requires a coordinate interaction among transcription factors and local signaling molecules. Expression of the homeobox genes such as Hoxa9, Hoxa10, Hoxa11 , and Hoxa13 , are restricted to specific regions of the female reproductive tract after birth and null mutations of these homeobox genes lead to various defects in Müllerian duct patterning. A Hoxa10 mutation resulted in homeotic transformation; the anterior segment of the uterus transformed into the oviduct ( Benson et al. 1996 ). In Hoxa10 +/-; Hoxa11 +/- embryos, abnormal uterotubal junctions and a narrow uterus arose ( Branford et al. 2000 ). Furthermore, Hoxa13 female mutants were infertile, which was proposed to be due to hypoplasia of the vaginal cavity and the cervix ( Post and Innis 1999 ). Overall, mutations in this set of Hox genes disrupt the regional specification of the female reproductive tract.

In addition to homeobox genes, signaling molecules such as Wnt5a and Wnt7a have been shown to be critical for the patterning of the Müllerian duct. Wnt5a is expressed in the mesenchyme of the uterus, cervix and vagina ( Miller et al. 1998 ). In the absence of Wnt5a , the uterus did not develop uterine glands and the anterior/posterior structures such the cervix and vagina did not form properly ( Mericskay et al. 2004 ). In contrast to the mesenchyme expression of Wnt4 and Wnt5a, Wnt7a is produced specifically in the luminal epithelium ( Miller et al. 1998 ). Without Wnt7a , the oviducts failed to coil and the uterine wall was thinner and less muscular in the mutants as compared with wild type mice. Wnt7a mutants also lacked uterine glands and developed shallow vaginal fornices ( Carta and Sasson 2004 ; Miller et al. 1998 ).

WNT proteins are known to elicit their function through two pathways in a ligand- and receptor-dependent manner: the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway and the non-canonical WNT/Ca 2+ pathway ( Miller 2001 ). The concurrent presence of Wnt4 , Wnt5a , and Wnt7a in the Müllerian duct suggests a certain degree of redundancy among these WNTs in Müllerian duct patterning. In this study, we investigated the overall role of the canonical WNT pathway by removing beta-catenin specifically in the mesenchyme of the Müllerian duct that express Amhr2 . By comparing the Müllerian duct phenotypes of the mesenchyme-specific beta-catenin knockout with other Wnt knockouts, we were able to establish a connection between these WNT ligands and the canonical WNT pathway during female reproductive tract differentiation.

DISCUSSION

The morphogenesis of the Müllerian duct into the various parts of the female reproductive tract requires intricate interactions among transcription factors and signaling molecules. Without the proper differentiation of the Müllerian duct in the female and its regression in the male, reproductive tract anomalies and infertility can occur. In the mouse, several Wnts including Wnt4, Wnt5a , and Wnt7a are expressed in a compartment-specific manner in the Müllerian duct and play unique roles in regional specific development of the duct. Wnt4 and Wnt5a are expressed in the mesenchyme of the Müllerian duct while Wnt7a is expressed in the epithelium of the Müllerian duct ( Miller et al. 1998 ). These WNTs signal through the canonical beta-catenin pathway, the non-canonical WNT pathway, or a combination of both. Wnt4 has been found to activate both the canonical and the non-canonical WNT signaling pathways in vertebrate tissues such as the kidney, the Müllerian duct, and the mammary gland ( Stark, 1994 ; Vainio et al. 1999 ; Brisken 2000 ). Wnt5a mainly signals through the non-canonical pathway in vertebrate species in the limb, the lung, chondrocytes, and the female reproductive tract ( Yamaguchi 1999 ; Li 2006 ; Yang 2003 ; Mericskay et al. 2004 ). On the other hand, Wnt7a elicits its action through the canonical WNT pathway in vertebrates in the limb, the female reproductive tract, and the cerebellum ( Parr 1995 ; Parr 1998 ; Miller 1998 ; and Hall 2000 ). To understand the overall role of the canonical WNT pathway in Müllerian duct development, we removed beta-catenin specifically in the Amhr2 -expressing mesenchyme of the Müllerian duct and investigated how the WNT/beta-catenin pathway connected to various WNT molecules in this developmental process.
