GIT1-like proteins are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Arfs and interact 
with a variety of signaling molecules to function as integrators of pathways 
controlling cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. In this report, we 
describe the characterization of a Drosophila homologue of GIT1, dGIT, and show 
that it is required for proper muscle morphogenesis and myotube guidance in the 
fly embryo. The dGIT protein is concentrated at the termini of growing myotubes 
and localizes to muscle attachment sites in late stage embryos. dgit mutant 
embryos show muscle patterning defects and aberrant targeting in subsets of 
their muscles. dgit mutant muscles fail to localize the p21-activated kinase, 
dPak, to their termini. dPak and dGIT form a complex in the presence of dPIX and 
dpak mutant embryos show similar muscle morphogenesis and targeting phenotypes 
to that of dgit. We propose that dGIT and dPak are part of a complex that 
promotes proper muscle morphogenesis and myotube targeting during embryogenesis.
