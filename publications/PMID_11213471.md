Transport of system xc- is an exchange agency with high specificity for anionic 
form of cystine and glutamate. The protein mediating this transport is a 
disulfide-linked heterodimer of a light chain named xCT and a heavy chain 
previously known as 4F2hc. We have isolated two cDNAs encoding xCT from the 
human cDNA library. One clone coded for a protein of 501 amino acids with 12 
putative transmembrane domains. When functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes 
together with the human 4F2hc, human xCT induced the transport activity whose 
characteristics are similar to those of system xc-. Another clone seemed to 
contain a partial human xCT and a long 3' untranslated region. The human xCT 
gene was localized at chromosome 4q28-31. Analysis of the 5'-flanking region of 
the human xCT gene revealed several sites for potentially binding of 
transcriptional factors, including NF-E2 and AP-1. Transport of cystine via 
system xc- has been known as a regulatory factor for the intracellular 
glutathione level, and its transport activity is induced in response to the 
oxygen tension in culture. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 
expression of both xCT and 4F2hc was significantly enhanced by oxygen. The 
results suggest that oxygen regulates the activity of system xc- by modulating 
the expression of both xCT and 4F2hc mRNAs.
