Genetic studies have elucidated critical roles of Piwi proteins in germline 
development in animals, but whether Piwi is an actual disease gene in human 
infertility remains unknown. We report germline mutations in human Piwi (Hiwi) 
in patients with azoospermia that prevent its ubiquitination and degradation. By 
modeling such mutations in Piwi (Miwi) knockin mice, we demonstrate that the 
genetic defects are directly responsible for male infertility. Mechanistically, 
we show that MIWI binds the histone ubiquitin ligase RNF8 in a Piwi-interacting 
RNA (piRNA)-independent manner, and MIWI stabilization sequesters RNF8 in the 
cytoplasm of late spermatids. The resulting aberrant sperm show histone 
retention, abnormal morphology, and severely compromised activity, which can be 
functionally rescued via blocking RNF8-MIWI interaction in spermatids with an 
RNF8-N peptide. Collectively, our findings identify Piwi as a factor in human 
infertility and reveal its role in regulating the histone-to-protamine exchange 
during spermiogenesis.

Graphical abstract

Male infertility in mice and humans can result from mutations that stabilize the Piwi protein in late spermatids: sperm defects are due to aberrant histone retention, not piRNA misregulation.

Introduction

Genomic DNA is organized on histone octamer in the nucleus of typical eukaryotic cells but is alternatively packaged on protamines in sperm of many animals ( Kornberg and Thomas, 1974 ; Oliva, 2006 ; Balhorn, 2007 ). Protamines are small, highly basic proteins that promote a much higher degree of DNA condensation to facilitate the packaging of genomic DNA into tiny sperm heads, which is essential to produce functional sperm ( Oliva, 2006 ). Such histone-to-protamine exchange is a complex process, which occurs during post-meiotic male germ cell development, known as spermiogenesis, when haploid round spermatids elongate and transform into spermatozoa ( Meistrich et al., 2003 ; Oliva, 2006 ). Despite the discovery of protamines in animal sperm more than a century ago and the well-established linkage between defective histone-to-protamine transition and male infertility in mammals ( Meistrich et al., 2003 ; Oliva, 2006 ; Yan, 2009 ), little is known about the regulatory mechanism that governs this transition. A recent study suggests that global ubiquitination of H2A and H2B mediated by the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 is a key initial step in this process ( Lu et al., 2010 ), but how this transition is triggered at a defined developmental stage of spermatogenesis remains unknown.

The evolutionarily conserved Piwi proteins belong to the Piwi clade of the Argonaute family, each of which is specifically expressed during the development of animal germline ( Juliano et al., 2011 ; Siomi et al., 2011 ). Piwi proteins are known to enlist germline-specific Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to suppress transposable elements and protect the integrity of the genome in germ cells ( Juliano et al., 2011 ; Siomi et al., 2011 ). We and others recently showed that the Piwi/piRNA machinery also functions in regulating protein coding genes in germ cells ( Gou et al., 2014 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ; Barckmann et al., 2015 ; Watanabe et al., 2015 ; Vourekas et al., 2016 ). Extensive genetic studies in worms, flies, fish, and mice indicate that Piwi proteins are essential for gametogenesis in animals ( Cox et al., 1998 ; Harris and Macdonald, 2001 ; Deng and Lin, 2002 ; Kuramochi-Miyagawa et al., 2004 ; Carmell et al., 2007 ; Houwing et al., 2008 ; Batista et al., 2008 ). For instance, all three Drosophila Piwi proteins, including Argonaute 3, Aubergine, and PIWI, are required for germ cell formation and germline stem cell maintenance in both male and female flies, consistent with their expression in testis and ovary ( Cox et al., 1998 ; Harris and Macdonald, 2001 ). The mouse genome encodes three Piwi paralogs, Miwi , Mili , and Miwi2 , all of which are highly expressed in the testis, and accordingly, all are required for male but not female fertility ( Deng and Lin, 2002 ; Kuramochi-Miyagawa et al., 2004 ; Carmell et al., 2007 ).

Piwi proteins consist of four distinct domains: the N-terminal, PAZ, MID, and PIWI domains ( Meister, 2013 ). The PAZ and MID domains are responsible for piRNA loading whereas the PIWI domain resembles RNase H ( De Fazio et al., 2011 ; Reuter et al., 2011 ; Cora et al., 2014 ), but the functional significance of the N-terminal domain has been unclear. We recently identified a conserved destruction box (D-box), a signature shared by the substrates of the APC/C ubiquitin E3 ligase, in the N-terminal domain of vertebrate PIWI proteins, including MIWI in mice and HIWI in humans ( Zhao et al., 2013 ). We further demonstrated that MIWI is ubiquitinated and degraded by APC/C in a D-box-dependent manner in late spermiogenesis in mice ( Zhao et al., 2013 ). By testis transduction, we provided initial evidence that this MIWI elimination is critical for proper transformation of spermatids into spermatozoa.

The human genome encodes four Piwi family members, including Hiwi , Hili , Hiwi2 , and Piwil3 ( Sasaki et al., 2003 ), all of which are mainly expressed in testis, but their potential function in human germline development has remained elusive. Despite the identification of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human Piwi genes ( Gu et al., 2010 ), the functional significance, if any, of such SNPs has remained unclear. Suspecting that HIWI D-box element might be a hotspot for mutations that cause male infertility in humans, we embarked on a screening effort to sequence the D-box region spanning the sixth and seventh exons of the Hiwi gene in a group of 413 patients with idiopathic azoospermia, which led to the identification of specific D-box mutations in three patients with azoospermia, including R218A/L221A (Patient 1), L221G/N225H (Patient 2), and L221R (Patient 3). By modeling such mutations in both knockin and trans-genic mice, we demonstrate that D-box mutations impeded MIWI degradation and contribute to male infertility. Mechanistically, we find that the MIWI D-box mutations in male mice impair the histone ubiquitination and histone-to-protamine transition during spermiogenesis, reminiscent of the phenotype observed in the histone ubiquitin ligase RNF8-deficient mice ( Lu et al., 2010 ). We further demonstrate that MIWI binds RNF8 in the cytoplasm of earlier spermatids, and MIWI degradation by APC/C in late spermatids is required for nuclear translocation of RNF8 to catalyze histone ubiquitination and trigger histone removal. These findings highlight a piRNA-independent function of HIWI/MIWI in late stage germline cells and demonstrate that defects in this regulatory pathway are implicated in infertility in males.

Discussion

Despite genetic studies on various animal models indicating that Piwi proteins are essential for animal germline development and fertility, the roles of Piwi in human genetics have not been demonstrated. In the present study, we identified specific D-box mutations in Hiwi from patients with idiopathic azoospermia, and by modeling such mutations in mouse models, we demonstrate their direct contribution to male infertility. More importantly, our data further indicate that MIWI ubiquitination/degradation is coupled with histone ubiquitination during late spermiogenesis, and MIWI stabilization inhibits RNF8 nuclear translocation and RNF8-mediated histone ubiquitination in late spermatids, which in turn cripples the histone-to-protamine transition to cause compromised sperm production both in quantity and quality in Miwi +/DB - Cre males ( Figure 7D ). Thus, our work identifies a role for Piwi function in human genetics and reveals mechanism for regulated packaging of genomic DNA into functional sperm.
