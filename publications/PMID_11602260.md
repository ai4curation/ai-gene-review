We previously identified and purified a nucleolar phosphoprotein, 
nucleophosmin/B23, as a stimulatory factor for replication from the adenovirus 
chromatin. We show here that nucleophosmin/B23 functions as a histone chaperone 
protein such as nucleoplasmin, TAF-I, and NAP-I. Nucleophosmin/B23 was shown to 
bind to histones, preferentially to histone H3, to mediate formation of 
nucleosome, and to decondense sperm chromatin. These activities of B23 were 
dependent on its acidic regions as other histone chaperones, suggesting that 
B23/nucleophosmin is a member of histone chaperone proteins.
