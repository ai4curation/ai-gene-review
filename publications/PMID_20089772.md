Anoxia induces several heat shock proteins, and a mild heat pretreatment can 
acclimatize Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings to subsequent anoxic 
treatment. In this study, we analyzed the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to 
anoxia, heat, and combined heat + anoxia stress. A significant overlap between 
the anoxic and the heat responses was observed by whole-genome microarray 
analysis. Among the transcription factors induced by both heat and anoxia, the 
heat shock factor A2 (HsfA2), known to be involved in Arabidopsis acclimation to 
heat and to other abiotic stresses, was strongly induced by anoxia. 
Heat-dependent acclimation to anoxia is lost in an HsfA2 knockout mutant (hsfa2) 
as well as in a double mutant for the constitutively expressed HsfA1a/HsfA1b 
(hsfA1a/1b), indicating that these three heat shock factors cooperate to confer 
anoxia tolerance. Arabidopsis seedlings that overexpress HsfA2 showed an 
increased expression of several known targets of this transcription factor and 
were markedly more tolerant to anoxia as well as to submergence. Anoxia failed 
to induce HsfA2 target proteins in wild-type seedlings, while overexpression of 
HsfA2 resulted in the production of HsfA2 targets under anoxia, correlating well 
with the low anoxia tolerance experiments. These results indicate that there is 
a considerable overlap between the molecular mechanisms of heat and anoxia 
tolerance and that HsfA2 is a player in these mechanisms.

Abstract

Anoxia induces several heat shock proteins, and a mild heat pretreatment can acclimatize Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) seedlings to subsequent anoxic treatment. In this study, we analyzed the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to anoxia, heat, and combined heat + anoxia stress. A significant overlap between the anoxic and the heat responses was observed by whole-genome microarray analysis. Among the transcription factors induced by both heat and anoxia, the heat shock factor A2 ( HsfA2 ), known to be involved in Arabidopsis acclimation to heat and to other abiotic stresses, was strongly induced by anoxia. Heat-dependent acclimation to anoxia is lost in an HsfA2 knockout mutant ( hsfa2 ) as well as in a double mutant for the constitutively expressed HsfA1a / HsfA1b ( hsfA1a/1b ), indicating that these three heat shock factors cooperate to confer anoxia tolerance. Arabidopsis seedlings that overexpress HsfA2 showed an increased expression of several known targets of this transcription factor and were markedly more tolerant to anoxia as well as to submergence. Anoxia failed to induce HsfA2 target proteins in wild-type seedlings, while overexpression of HsfA2 resulted in the production of HsfA2 targets under anoxia, correlating well with the low anoxia tolerance experiments. These results indicate that there is a considerable overlap between the molecular mechanisms of heat and anoxia tolerance and that HsfA2 is a player in these mechanisms.

DISCUSSION

Mild heat treatment results in acquired anoxia tolerance ( Loreti et al., 2005 ). The molecular basis of this phenomenon is unknown, and there are several possible hypotheses. First, heat may induce several stress-related transcription factors, thus activating a large number of signaling pathways conferring tolerance to anoxia. A second possibility is that heat pretreatment enhances tolerance by dampening the anoxic responses of the seedlings, allowing them to enter into a quiescent state preserving cellular viability. Third, the increased tolerance could be due to the activation of a functional overlap between the heat and the anoxia acclimation mechanisms.

The first hypothesis is reasonable, since we observed a strong induction of the genes belonging, for example, to the ERF, MYB, WRKY, NAC, and HSF families (Supplemental Fig. S2). However, none of the transcription factors listed in Supplemental Table S1 is known to positively affect anoxia tolerance. The dampening of the anoxic response as part of a “low oxygen quiescence syndrome” ( Bailey-Serres and Voesenek, 2008 ) is also feasible, since heat pretreatment reduces the expression of several anaerobic genes ( Fig. 2 ) and also slows down the ethanol production (Supplemental Fig. S1). However, the higher production of ethanol observed in the 35S :: HsfA2 seedlings (Supplemental Fig. S3), which were also more tolerant to anoxia ( Fig. 5A ), suggests that the dampening effect of heat over the anaerobic response may simply reflect the hierarchies of stress response regulatory systems.

However, the activation of a heat-dependent anoxia acclimation mechanism(s) that shares similarities with acquired thermotolerance pathways would seem to be possible, so we turned our attention to HsfA2 ( Fig. 3 ). HsfA2 plays an important role in acquired thermotolerance and also appears to play a role in abiotic stress tolerance. Indeed, some studies have reported the role of HsfA2 in oxidative stress ( Li et al., 2005 ), high light conditions and chilling ( Nishizawa et al., 2006 , 2008 ), and salt/osmotic stress tolerance, suggesting a role in multiple stress tolerance ( Ogawa et al., 2007 ). The results obtained through a genetic approach demonstrate that the hsfA2 mutant cannot cross-acclimate to anoxia through mild heat pretreatment, in contrast to the wild type ( Fig. 5 ). Assuming that HsfA2 is important for anoxia tolerance, we would also have expected a lower anoxia tolerance in the hsfA2 plants when a sublethal anoxic treatment was applied, but this was not the case (data not shown). However, expression of HsfA2 targets in hsfA2 explains this result and is most likely due to possible redundancy among the 21 Arabidopsis HSFs ( Lohmann et al., 2004 ). Seven Hsf s ( Fig. 3A ) were induced under anoxia and may have compensated for the absence of HsfA2 in the hsfA2 mutant. Differences between the wild type and hsfA2 in heat-dependent acquired anoxia tolerance were observed only after a long (2-d) recovery from the heat treatment, in line with the role of HsfA2 in acquired thermotolerance ( Charng et al., 2007 ). It has been demonstrated that only after a long-term recovery from heat pretreatment is it possible to observe differences both in heat tolerance and expression of HsfA2 -dependent HSPs, such as Hsp25.3-P ( Charng et al., 2007 ). Additionally, as previously suggested for heat stress ( Schramm et al., 2006 ), HsfA2 appears to cooperate with HsfA1a/1b in the mechanism of heat-induced anoxia tolerance ( Fig. 5D ). Both HsfA2 and HsfA1a/1b are indeed involved in the mechanism of acquired thermotolerance ( Wunderlich et al., 2003 ; Charng et al., 2007 ).

35S :: HsfA2 seedlings and plants showed enhanced tolerance to anoxia and to submergence, respectively ( Fig. 5 ). The enhanced anoxia tolerance could be explained either as a real tolerance to the lack of oxygen or a better ability to recover during the postanoxic phase. The results obtained with the submergence experiments, which showed healthier 35S :: HsfA2 plants during and immediately after the end of the submergence ( Fig. 5C ), suggest that HsfA2 overexpression protects the plants during the stress treatment rather than from the consequences of reaeration. These results demonstrate that HsfA2 is not only responsible for the heat-dependent acclimation to anoxia but also plays a role in the low oxygen-tolerance response in Arabidopsis.

HsfA2 is the most H 2 O 2 -responsive Hsf ( Miller and Mittler, 2006 ). It is likely that H 2 O 2 is the trigger that induces HsfA2 under anoxia, since H 2 O 2 is produced at the onset of anoxia ( Fig. 4B ). Exogenous H 2 O 2 treatment induces HsfA2 and confers anoxia tolerance ( Fig. 4, A and C ). Signaling by reactive oxygen species under oxygen deprivation ( Bailey-Serres and Chang, 2005 ) and protection from oxidative stress are important under anoxia ( Blokhina et al., 2002 ). HSPs themselves may be involved in protecting the cell from oxidative stress ( Timperio et al., 2008 ). GolS1 is induced by HsfA2 and is important for plant acclimation to oxidative stress ( Nishizawa et al., 2008 ). Galactinol, produced by GolS , may well play a role under anoxia, as de novo galactinol biosynthesis from Suc would be required, and Suc is known to enhance Arabidopsis tolerance to low oxygen ( Banti et al., 2008 ). Genes regulated by HsfA2 include several sHSPs ( Nishizawa et al., 2006 ; Schramm et al., 2006 ). sHSPs are overrepresented under several stress conditions, underlining the putative importance of their ATP-independent role in stabilizing proteins and membranes undergoing conformational disruption ( Swindell et al., 2007 ). This ATP-independent function may be particularly important under anoxic conditions, since it reduces the energy-dependent de novo protein synthesis.

Despite the anoxic induction of HsfA2 at levels close to those observed after heat treatment ( Fig. 3 ), Arabidopsis seedlings are highly susceptible to anoxia. Heat-pretreated or 35S :: HsfA2 plants, on the other hand, are highly tolerant to anoxia. This can be explained by the failure of wild-type plants to induce the HsfA2 targets at the protein level ( Fig. 6B ). Indeed, while HsfA2 target mRNAs are induced under either heat or anoxia, we only detected a faint protein band corresponding to sHSP-CI and Hsp25.3-P in the 4-h anoxia-treated Col-0 plants ( Fig. 6B ). Plants able to withstand anoxic treatment (heat pretreated or overexpressing HsfA2 ), on the other hand, showed HSP accumulation under anoxia ( Fig. 6B ). The lack of expression of HSPs at the protein level in the anoxic samples is somewhat surprising, since HSP mRNAs are loaded onto polyribosomes under low oxygen ( Branco-Price et al., 2008 ). This suggests that the translation of HSP mRNA is controlled by a complex regulatory mechanism. This hypothesis is reinforced by the evidence of a lack of HSP protein accumulation even in the 35S :: HsfA2 aerobic seedlings, despite the strong expression of the respective HSP mRNAs. The HSP proteins only accumulated when the 35S :: HsfA2 plants were exposed to anoxia, indicating that a “stress” signal is required for the translation of the HSP mRNAs. The failure to induce HSP accumulation under anoxia in wild-type plants is possibly due to the slower timing of the HsfA2 expression and its targets under anoxia compared with the expression following heat and heat + anoxia ( Fig. 3C ). In the 35S :: HsfA2 plants, HsfA2 and its target mRNAs are already present in air, which is likely to lead to their rapid translation as soon as anoxia is established, before the ability to produce and accumulate HSP proteins declines ( Fig. 6B ).

In this study, we demonstrated the importance of HsfA2 in protecting Arabidopsis plants under low-oxygen conditions. The overexpression of HsfA2 transactivates its target genes early enough to enable them to be translated even under anoxic conditions. It is likely that both HSPs and genes involved in the protection against oxidative stress are responsible for the acquisition of anoxia tolerance. These results indicate that there is a considerable overlap between the molecular mechanisms of heat and anoxia tolerance and that HsfA2 is a major player in these mechanisms.
