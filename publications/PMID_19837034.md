Human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol gamma) is the sole replicase in 
mitochondria. Pol gamma is vulnerable to nonselective antiretroviral drugs and 
is increasingly associated with mutations found in patients with 
mitochondriopathies. We determined crystal structures of the human 
heterotrimeric Pol gamma holoenzyme and, separately, a variant of its 
processivity factor, Pol gammaB. The holoenzyme structure reveals an unexpected 
assembly of the mitochondrial DNA replicase where the catalytic subunit Pol 
gammaA interacts with its processivity factor primarily via a domain that is 
absent in all other DNA polymerases. This domain provides a structural module 
for supporting both the intrinsic processivity of the catalytic subunit alone 
and the enhanced processivity of holoenzyme. The Pol gamma structure also 
provides a context for interpreting the phenotypes of disease-related mutations 
in the polymerase and establishes a foundation for understanding the molecular 
basis of toxicity of anti-retroviral drugs targeting HIV reverse transcriptase.
