Amyloid beta (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It 
is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two sequential 
proteolytic cleavages, which also generate the APP intracellular domain (AICD). 
The precise cellular function(s) of AICD still remain obscure. To elucidate the 
roles of AICD in the development of AD, a yeast two-hybrid system was used to 
screen a human brain cDNA library for proteins interacting directly with AICD. 
One of the potential AICD-interacting proteins identified from our screening 
result is a lipid raft-associated protein, flotillin-1. The interaction was 
confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation 
studies. Since lipid raft has been suggested to play an important role in signal 
transduction as well as the pathogenic development of neurodegenerative 
diseases, it is proposed that flotillin-1 may recruit APP to lipid rafts and 
therefore participate in the localization and processing of APP.
