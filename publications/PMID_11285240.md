Alternative splicing of human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) exon 9 is regulated by a combination of cis-acting elements 
distributed through the exon and both flanking introns (IVS8 and IVS9). Several 
studies have identified in the IVS8 intron 3' splice site a regulatory element 
that is composed of a polymorphic (TG)m(T)n repeated sequence. At present, no 
cellular factors have been identified that recognize this element. We have 
identified TDP-43, a nuclear protein not previously described to bind RNA, as 
the factor binding specifically to the (TG)m sequence. Transient TDP-43 
overexpression in Hep3B cells results in an increase in exon 9 skipping. This 
effect is more pronounced with concomitant overexpression of SR proteins. 
Antisense inhibition of endogenous TDP-43 expression results in increased 
inclusion of exon 9, providing a new therapeutic target to correct aberrant 
splicing of exon 9 in CF patients. The clinical and biological relevance of this 
finding in vivo is demonstrated by our characterization of a CF patient carrying 
a TG10T9(DeltaF508)/TG13T3(wt) genotype leading to a disease-causing high 
proportion of exon 9 skipping.
