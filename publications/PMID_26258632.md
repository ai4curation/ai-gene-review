For proper partitioning of genomes in mitosis, all chromosomes must be aligned 
at the spindle equator before the onset of anaphase. The spindle assembly 
checkpoint (SAC) monitors this process, generating a 'wait anaphase' signal at 
unattached kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes. However, the link between SAC 
activation and chromosome alignment is poorly understood. Here we show that 
Mad1, a core SAC component, plays a hitherto concealed role in chromosome 
alignment. Protein-protein interaction screening revealed that fission yeast 
Mad1 binds the plus-end-directed kinesin-5 motor protein Cut7 (Eg5 homologue), 
which is generally thought to promote spindle bipolarity. We demonstrate that 
Mad1 recruits Cut7 to kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes and promotes 
chromosome gliding towards the spindle equator. Similarly, human Mad1 recruits 
another kinetochore motor CENP-E, revealing that Mad1 is the conserved 
dual-function protein acting in SAC activation and chromosome gliding. Our 
results suggest that the mitotic checkpoint has co-evolved with a mechanism to 
drive chromosome congression.
