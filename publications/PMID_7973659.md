The interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) consists of three subunits: the IL-2R alpha, 
IL-2R beta, and IL-2R gamma chains, the last of which is also used in the 
receptors for IL-4, IL-7, and IL-9. Stimulation with IL-2 induces the tyrosine 
phosphorylation and activation of the Janus kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 
were found to be selectively associated with the "serine-rich" region of IL-2R 
beta and the carboxyl-terminal region of IL-2R gamma, respectively. Both regions 
were necessary for IL-2 signaling. Furthermore, Jak3-negative fibroblasts 
expressing reconstituted IL-2R became responsive to IL-2 after the additional 
expression of Jak3 complementary DNA. Thus, activation of Jak1 and Jak3 may be a 
key event in IL-2 signaling.
