The insulin/IGF receptor homolog DAF-2 regulates the aging in C. elegans. 
Decreasing daf-2 activity causes fertile adults to remain active much longer 
than normal and to live more than twice as long. A more severe decrease in daf-2 
function causes young larvae to enter a state of diapause rather than 
progressing to adulthood. We have asked which cells require daf-2 gene activity 
in order for the animal to develop to adulthood and to age normally. We found 
that daf-2 functions cell nonautonomously in both processes. Our findings imply 
that the life span of C. elegans is determined by a signaling cascade in which 
the DAF-2 receptor acts in multiple cell lineages to regulate the production or 
activity of a secondary signal (or signals), which, in turn, controls the growth 
and longevity of individual tissues in the animal.
