We purified the oncoprotein SnoN and found that it functions as a corepressor of 
the tumor suppressor p53 in the regulation of the hepatic alpha-fetoprotein 
(AFP) tumor marker gene. p53 promotes SnoN and histone deacetylase interaction 
at an overlapping Smad binding, p53 regulatory element (SBE/p53RE) in AFP. 
Comparison of wild-type and p53-null mouse liver tissue by using chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) reveals that the absence of p53 protein correlates 
with the disappearance of SnoN at the SBE/p53RE and loss of AFP developmental 
repression. Treatment of AFP-expressing hepatoma cells with transforming growth 
factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) induced SnoN transcription and Smad2 activation, 
concomitant with AFP repression. ChIP assays show that TGF-beta1 stimulates p53, 
Smad4, P-Smad2 binding, and histone H3K9 deacetylation and methylation, at the 
SBE/p53RE. Depletion, by small interfering RNA, of SnoN and/or p53 in hepatoma 
cells disrupted repression of AFP transcription. These findings support a model 
of cooperativity between p53 and TGF-beta effectors in chromatin modification 
and transcription repression of an oncodevelopmental tumor marker gene.
