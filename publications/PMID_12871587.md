Seizure-induced neuronal death may involve coordinated intracellular trafficking 
and protein-protein interactions of members of the Bcl-2 family. The 14-3-3 
proteins are known to sequester certain pro-apoptotic members of this family. 
BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) may contribute to seizure-induced 
neuronal death, although regulation by 14-3-3 has not been reported. In this 
study we examined whether 14-3-3 proteins interact with Bid during 
seizure-induced neuronal death. Brief seizures were evoked in rats by 
intraamygdala microinjection of kainic acid to elicit unilateral hippocampal CA3 
neuronal death. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that although 
Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad) constitutively bound 14-3-3, there was no 
interaction between Bid and 14-3-3 in control brain. Seizures triggered Bid 
cleavage and a commensurate increase in binding of Bid to 14-3-3 within injured 
hippocampus. Casein kinases I and II, which can inactivate Bid by 
phosphoserine/threonine modification, did not coimmunoprecipitate with Bid. The 
largely uninjured contralateral hippocampus did not exhibit Bid cleavage or 
binding of 14-3-3 to Bid. In vitro experiments confirmed that 14-3-3beta is 
capable of binding truncated Bid, likely in the absence of 
phosphoserine/threonine modification. These data suggest 14-3-3 proteins may 
target active as well as inactive conformations of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 death 
agonists, highlighting novel targets for intervention in seizure-induced 
neuronal death.
