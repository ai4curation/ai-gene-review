To understand the mechanism of how Axin acts as an inhibitory molecule in the 
Wnt pathway, we generated a series of mutated forms of Axin. From the binding 
experiments, we defined the domains of Axin that bind glycogen synthase 
kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and beta-catenin. We also examined the ability of each 
Axin mutant to inhibit lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (Lef-1) reporter activity in a 
cell line expressing high levels of beta-catenin. Axin mutants that did not bind 
GSK-3beta or beta-catenin were ineffective in suppressing Lef-1 reporter 
activity. Binding GSK-3beta and beta-catenin was not sufficient for this 
inhibitory effect of Axin. Axin mutants with C-terminal truncations lacked the 
ability to inhibit Lef-1 reporter activity, even though they bound GSK-3beta and 
beta-catenin. The C-terminal region was required for binding to Axin itself. 
Substitution of the C-terminal region with an unrelated dimerizing molecule, the 
retinoid X receptor restored its inhibitory effect on Lef-1-dependent 
transcription. The oligomerization of Axin through its C terminus is important 
for its function in regulation of beta-catenin-mediated response.
