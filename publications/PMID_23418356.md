Successful completion of mitosis requires that sister kinetochores become 
attached end-on to the plus ends of spindle microtubules (MTs) in prometaphase, 
thereby forming kinetochore microtubules (kMTs) that tether one sister to one 
spindle pole and the other sister to the opposite pole. Sites for kMT attachment 
provide at least four key functions: robust and dynamic kMT anchorage; force 
generation that can be coupled to kMT plus-end dynamics; correction of errors in 
kMT attachment; and control of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The SAC 
typically delays anaphase until chromosomes achieve metaphase alignment with 
each sister kinetochore acquiring a full complement of kMTs. Although it has 
been known for over 30 years that MT motor proteins reside at kinetochores, a 
highly conserved network of protein complexes, called the KMN network, has 
emerged in recent years as the primary interface between the kinetochore and 
kMTs. This Commentary will summarize recent advances in our understanding of the 
role of the KMN network for the key kinetochore functions, with a focus on human 
cells.
