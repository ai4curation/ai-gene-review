Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) negatively regulate 
MAPK activity. In the present study, we have identified a novel MKP, designated 
MKP-7, and mapped it to human chromosome 12p12. MKP-7 possesses a long 
C-terminal stretch containing both a nuclear export signal and a nuclear 
localization signal, in addition to the rhodanese-like domain and the dual 
specificity phosphatase catalytic domain, both of which are conserved among MKP 
family members. When expressed in mammalian cells MKP-7 protein was localized 
exclusively in the cytoplasm, but this localization became exclusively nuclear 
following leptomycin B treatment or introduction of a mutation in the nuclear 
export signal. These findings indicate that MKP-7 is the first identified 
leptomycin B-sensitive shuttle MKP. Forced expression of MKP-7 suppressed 
activation of MAPKs in COS-7 cells in the order of selectivity, JNK p38 > ERK. 
Furthermore, a mutant form MKP-7 functioned as a dominant negative particularly 
against the dephosphorylation of JNK, suggesting that MKP-7 works as a 
JNK-specific phosphatase in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and 
histological analysis suggested that MKP-7 determines the localization of MAPKs 
in the cytoplasm.
