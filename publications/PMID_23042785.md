Although tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation is a universal feature of 
cancer cells, little is known about the necessary molecular triggers. Here, we 
show that Wilms' tumour 1 (WT1), a developmental master regulator that can also 
act as a tumour suppressor or oncoprotein, transcriptionally regulates the de 
novo DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and that cellular WT1 levels can 
influence DNA methylation of gene promoters genome-wide. Specifically, we 
demonstrate that depletion of WT1 by short-interfering RNAs leads to reduced 
DNMT3A in Wilms' tumour cells and human embryonal kidney-derived cell lines. 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate WT1 recruitment to the DNMT3A 
promoter region and reporter assays confirm that WT1 directly transactivates 
DNMT3A expression. Consistent with this regulatory role, immunohistochemical 
analysis shows co-expression of WT1 and DNMT3A proteins in nuclei of blastemal 
cells in human fetal kidney and Wilms' tumours. Using genome-wide promoter 
methylation arrays, we show that human embryonal kidney cells over-expressing 
WT1 acquire DNA methylation changes at specific gene promoters where DNMT3A 
recruitment is increased, with hypermethylation being associated with silencing 
of gene expression. Elevated DNMT3A is also demonstrated at hypermethylated 
genes in Wilms' tumour cells, including a region of long-range epigenetic 
silencing. Finally, we show that depletion of WT1 in Wilms' tumour cells can 
lead to reactivation of gene expression from methylated promoters, such as 
TGFB2, a key modulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. Collectively, our 
work defines a new regulatory modality for WT1 involving elicitation of 
epigenetic alterations which is most likely crucial to its functions in 
development and disease.
