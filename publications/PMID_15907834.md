Branching morphogenesis in the lung serves as a model for the complex patterning 
that is reiterated in multiple organs throughout development. Beta-catenin and 
Wnt signaling mediate critical functions in cell fate specification and 
differentiation, but specific functions during branching morphogenesis have 
remained unclear. Here, we show that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates 
proximal-distal differentiation of airway epithelium. Inhibition of 
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, either by expression of Dkk1 or by tissue-specific 
deletion of beta-catenin, results in disruption of distal airway development and 
expansion of proximal airways. Wnt/beta-catenin functions upstream of BMP4, FGF 
signaling, and N-myc. Moreover, we show that beta-catenin and LEF/TCF activate 
the promoters of BMP4 and N-myc. Thus, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is a critical 
upstream regulator of proximal-distal patterning in the lung, in part, through 
regulation of N-myc, BMP4, and FGF signaling.
