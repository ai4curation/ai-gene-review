In order to investigate the neuroprotection of insulin in retinal neurons, we 
used retinal neuronal culture as a model system to study the protective effects 
of insulin against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and apoptotic death. Primary 
retinal neuronal cultures were grown from retinas of 0-2-day old Sprague-Dawley 
rats. Cell viability was measured by 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Apoptotic 
cell death was evaluated by the TdT-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP nick-end labeling 
assay, and by DNA laddering analysis. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity 
was measured using phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphophate and [gamma-32P]ATP as 
substrate. Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-Akt (pS473) antibody was 
performed to examine the level of phosphorylated Akt. We observed that treatment 
with 100 microM H2O2 for 24 h significantly decreased cell viability and induced 
apoptotic death of retinal neurons, and that pretreatment with 10 nM insulin 
significantly inhibited or attenuated H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. 
Pretreatment with LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, abolished the 
cytoprotective effect of insulin. Insulin also strongly activated both PI3K and 
the downstream effector Akt. These results suggest that insulin protects retinal 
neurons from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and that the PI3K/Akt signal 
pathway is involved in insulin-mediated retinal neuroprotection.
