Cyclophilin A (CyP-A), the major intracellular receptor for the 
immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA), is a member of the immunophilin class of 
proteins, which all possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and, 
therefore, are believed to be involved in protein folding and/or intracellular 
protein transport. The CyP-A protein is encoded by a single gene; in addition, 
15 pseudogenes have been identified. Recently, specific binding of CyP-A to the 
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gag protein has been reported. 
Interestingly, this interaction can be inhibited by the immunosuppressant CsA 
and also by nonimmunosuppressive, CyP-A-binding CsA derivatives, which were also 
shown to exhibit potent anti-HIV-1 activity. Results thus indicate that CyP-A 
may have an essential function in HIV-1 replication. Using a panel of somatic 
rodent-human cell hybrids and PCR technology, we localized the coding 
cyclophilin A gene (PPIA) on chromosome 7 and four pseudogenes (PPIP2, PPIP3, 
PPIP4, and PPIP6) on chromosomes 14, 10, 18, and 3, respectively. Using 
chromosome 7 and chromosome 10 deletion hybrid panels, we were able to localize 
further the coding gene to the region 7p11.2-p13, as confirmed by fluorescence 
in situ hybridization analysis, and one pseudogene (PPIP3) to the region 
10q11.2-q23. This is the first report on the regional mapping of members of the 
CyP-A gene family.
