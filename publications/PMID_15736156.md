The present study deals with the effects of Ni on the expression level of three 
stress proteins, namely, the cytosolic HSP72 and HSP73, and the 
reticulum-associated GRP94. Experiments were carried out on "Wistar'' female 
rats daily injected with 4 mg NiCl2 per kg body weight for 1, 3, 5, and 10 days. 
Another set of experiments were carried out using cell lines, derived from the 
monkey kidney (COS-7), and from human tumors of the lung (A549) and liver 
(HepG2). Cells were cultured for 4 days in the permanent presence of 100, 200, 
or 400 microM NiCl2. In control rats, stress proteins pattern was found to be 
tissue specific: two protein bands of 96 and 94 kDa were immunodetected with the 
anti-GRP94 antibody in kidney and liver extracts, whereas only the 96 kDa band 
was present in ovary extracts. HSP73 was present in kidney, liver, and ovary 
whereas HSP72 was only found in kidney. In kidney of nickel-treated animals, 
HSP73 and the 96 kDa proteins were overexpressed whereas HSP72 was strongly down 
regulated. No such effect was observed in liver or ovary. Similarly, in 
nickel-treated cell lines, HSP72 was downregulated and GRP94 (96 kDa protein) 
was overexpressed. HSP73 expression appeared moderately increased in A549 cells 
but decreased in COS-7 cells. Because long-term caloric restriction was reported 
to reduce free radical generation in cells, the effect of 1 month food 
restriction (50%) was tested in rats as a possible way to lower oxidative 
damages induced by Ni. No significant effect on HSP expression was observed.
