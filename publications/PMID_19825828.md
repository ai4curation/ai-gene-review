Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a proinflammatory cytokine mainly produced by cells of 
the T helper 17 (T(H)17) lineage, is required for host defense against bacterial 
and fungal infections and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of 
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Act1 is an essential adaptor molecule in 
IL-17-mediated signaling and is recruited to the IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) upon 
IL-17 stimulation through an interaction between its SEFIR domain and that of 
the IL-17R. Here, we report that Act1 is a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase and that 
its activity is essential for IL-17-mediated signaling pathways. Through the use 
of the Ubc13-Uev1A E2 complex, Act1 mediated the lysine-63-linked ubiquitination 
of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a component of 
IL-17-mediated signaling. Deletion and point mutations of the Act1 U-box 
abolished Act1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF6 and impaired the ability of Act1 
to restore IL-17-dependent signaling and expression of target genes in Act1(-/-) 
mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We also showed that the lysine-124 residue of TRAF6 
was critical for efficient Act1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF6 and for the 
ability of TRAF6 to mediate IL-17-induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB. 
Thus, we propose that Act1 mediates IL-17-induced signaling pathways through its 
E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and that TRAF6 is a critical substrate of Act1, 
which indicates the importance of protein ubiquitination in the IL-17-dependent 
inflammatory response.

Abstract

Interleukin (IL)-17, a proinflammatory cytokine mainly produced by T-helper-17 (T H 17) lineage, is required for host defense against bacteria and fungus infection and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Act1 is an essential adaptor molecule in IL-17-mediated signaling pathway, recruited to IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) upon IL-17 stimulation through SEFIR-SEFIR domain interaction. Here we report that Act1 is a novel bona fide U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, whose activity is essential for IL-17-mediated signaling pathways (including nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), and partially required for Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation) and inflammatory gene expression (KC (CXCL1), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CFS ) and IL-6) in mammalian cells. By utilizing Ubc13/Uev1A E2 complex, Act1 mediates Lys 63-linked ubiquitination of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an important signaling component of IL-17-mediated signaling pathway. Deletion and point mutations of the Act1 U-box abolish Act1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF6 and impair the ability of Act1 to restore IL-17-dependent signaling and inflammatory gene expression in Act1 −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Importantly, we demonstrate that the Lys 124 residue of TRAF6 is critical for efficient Act1-mediated TRAF6 ubiquitination and for the ability of TRAF6 to mediate IL-17-induced NFκB activation. Thus Act1 mediates IL-17-induced signaling pathways through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and TRAF6 is a critical substrate of Act1, indicating the importance of protein ubiquitination in IL-17-dependent inflammatory response.

INTRODUCTION

The recent discovery of an inflammatory T helper cell population (Th17), distinct from the classical Th1 and Th2 subsets, has challenged the paradigm of T cell biology and provided new understanding about T cell-mediated immunity. Interleukin (IL)-17 (IL-17, IL-17A), a key proinflammatory cytokine mainly produced by the Th17 cell lineage, is required for host defense against extracellular microorganisms and contributes to the development and pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 1 – 4 . IL-17 levels are elevated in many inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lung airway infections, and psoriasis. IL-17-deficient mice displayed reduced severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), indicating the essential role IL-17 under those inflammatory conditions. The main function of IL-17 is to coordinate local tissue inflammation through the up-regulation of inflammatory and neutrophil-mobilizing cytokines and chemokines in various tissue cells, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells and astrocytes. Although recent studies have begun to unravel IL-17-dependent signalling events 5 – 8 , the precise molecular mechanism for IL-17-mediated pathway remains unclear. Identification of intermediate signalling components and understanding of their signalling mechanism are crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies to block this major pro-inflammatory pathway.

IL-17 signals through a heteromeric receptor complex composed of IL-17RA and IL-17RC, members of the IL-17 receptor family 9 ; 10 . Both IL-17RA and IL-17RC belong to a SEFIR protein family, defined by a conserved cytoplasmic SEFIR domain that is responsible for the homotypical interaction between proteins 11 . Act1 has recently been identified as an essential component in IL-17 signalling pathway and is required for IL-17-dependent immune responses 5 ; 6 . Act1 contains two tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) binding sites, a helix-loop-helix domain at the N-terminus, and a coiled-coil domain at the C-terminus 12 . Act1 has a SEFIR domain located within its coiled-coil region and therefore is also a member of the SEFIR protein family. Upon IL-17 stimulation, Act1 is recruited to IL-17R through SEFIR-SEFIR domain interaction. which is followed by recruitment of the TGFbeta Activated Kinase 1 (TAK1) and E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 that mediate ‘downstream’ signalling events 6 ; 13 .

Protein ubiquitination is an important post-translational modification required for many cellular functions 14 ; 15 . Protein ubiquitination involves three types of enzyme: ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) which activates ubiquitin in a ATP-dependent process, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) which accepts activated ubiquitin from E1 to form E2-ubiquitin thioester, and ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) which binds E2 and the substrate and mediates the formation of isopeptide bond between ubiquitin carboxyl terminus and a ε-amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein. The E3 ubiqutin ligases, together with E2 determine the specificity of their substrates to mediate diverse biological functions. Three families of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been described, including HECT (homology to E6AP C-terminus)-, RING (really interesting new gene)-, and U-box-type E3s. Different lysine residues of ubiquitin can be utilized in conjugation with another ubiquitin molecule to form distinct polyubiquitin chains. K48-linked polyubiquitination usually targets the substrate for proteasome-mediated degradation. In contrast, K63-linked polyubiquitination is involved in nonproteolytic functions, such as protein-protein interaction and cell signalling.

We now found that Act1 contains a U-box-like region and is a member of the U-box-type 3 ubiquitin ligase family. In the present study, we demonstrate that Act1 functions as a novel U-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligase mediating Lys 63-ubiquitination of TRAF6, which is critical for IL-17-mediated signalling. Act1 represents a first example that a U-box-type E3 may regulate immune responses through its impact on IL-17 signalling.

DISCUSSION

In this manuscript, we show that Act1, a receptor proximal component of the IL-17R signalling pathway, is an U-box type E3 ubiquitin ligase. Importantly, the Act1 U-box-mediated E3 activity is crucial for IL-17-induced downstream signalling events (NFκB, JNK and ERK activation) and inflammatory gene expression (KC, GM-CSF and IL-6), providing a molecular mechanism for Act1-mediated IL-17-induced signalling. Specifically, Act1 mediates Lys 63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6, an important component of IL-17 signalling pathway. We demonstrate that Act1-mediated TRAF6 ubiquitination takes place on Lys 124 of TRAF6, which is required for IL-17-induced NFκB activation.

The Act1 U-box (amino acid residues 273–338) was identified through a Hidden Markov Model search of the SMART database, followed by sequence alignment with the U-boxes of known structure from CHIP [PDB code 2C2V 17 ; 18 , Prp 23 and AtPUB 24 ]. While these sequences have twilight identity with the Act1 U-box (10–14%) but more substantial sequence similarity (41–48%) was found. The alignment was used to generate a model structure for the Act1 U-box using the Swiss-Model interface 16 . The overall reasonable model geometry and conformation were verified by a number of parameters, including pseudo-energies calculated by QMEAN (−1204 kJ/mol 25 ) and DFIRE (−3250 kJ/mol 26 ). Measures of local structure quality (ANOLEA and GROMOS energies) supported these numbers, especially in the core regions of the fold. The mean S-score of the model (calculated in ProQRes 27 ) was 0.65, which is considered reasonable given the relatively low sequence homologies among the template structures and Act1. The overall sequence analysis and structural modelling provide sufficient confidence in the Act1 U-box domain. Our studies show that the Act1 molecule with this hypothetical U-box was indeed able to confer E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in vivo. While the removal of the U-box abolished the E3 activity of Act1, the U-box alone was sufficient to mediate polyubiquitination. Point mutations of the key residues in the U-box (predicted by sequence alignment and structural modelling with known U-box containing E3 CHIP) abolished its E3 activity, confirming the specificity of the Act1 U-box domain. Taken together, our results indicate that Act1 contains a bona fide U-box with potent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.

Act1 has recently been identified as an essential component in IL-17 signalling pathway and is required for IL-17-dependent immune responses 5 ; 6 . IL-17 signals through a heteromeric receptor complex composed of IL-17RA and IL-17RC, which belong to a SEFIR protein family, defined by a conserved cytoplasmic SEFIR domain. Act1 contains a SEFIR domain and is recruited to IL-17R through SEFIR-SEFIR domain interaction. We have now identified the U-box as a second functional domain of Act1. While the SEFIR domain is the interacting domain for specific recruitment of Act1 to the receptor, the U-box domain of Act1 is an effector domain for Act1 to mediate the ubiquitination and activation of downstream signalling components. Inactivation of the E3 activity of Act1 diminished the ability of Act1 to mediate IL-17-induced NFκB, JNK and ERK activation. Specifically, we have now identified TRAF6 as one critical ubiquitination substrate of Act1. Act1 U-box-mediated TRAF6 ubiquitination is required for the IL-17-dependent NFκB activation.

TRAF6 is a central signalling molecule utilized by a variety of receptors, including IL-1R/TLRs and CD40 19 ; 20 ; 28 – 30 . TRAF6 has been shown to play an important role in the activation of TAK1, leading to IKK and NFκB activation. Upon TLR-IL-1R stimulation, TRAF6 is ubiquitinated with K63-linked ubiquitin chain. The TAK1 binding proteins, TAB2 and TAB3, bind preferentially to polyubiquitin chains on TRAF6 through a highly conserved zinc finger (ZnF) domain 31 . Importantly, TRAF6 is a RING-domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent activation of TAK1 and IKK complex 32 ; 33 . In this study, we found that the RING domain E3 mutant TRAF6 C70A failed to restore IL-17-induced IκB phosphorylation/degradation and NFκB-dependent liciferase activity in Traf6 −/− MEFs. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the TRAF6 E3 activity is also critical for IL-17-mediated NFκB activation.

The critical question has been whether TRAF6 mediates self-ubiquitination or another E3 is required for TRAF6 ubiquitination 22 . Importantly, our results show that TRAF6 was not efficiently ubiquitinated by itself when using Ubc13/Uev1A E2 complex in the in vitro assay. This observation is consistent with a recent report that Uev1A is inhibitory to TRAF6 ubiquitination by directing the reaction to ubiquitin chain synthesis 21 . Addition of Act1 to the reaction significantly promoted TRAF6 modification and the U-box of Act1 is required for Act1-mediated TRAF6 ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore, we have now mapped the Lys 124 of TRAF6 as the primary acceptor site for Act1-mediated ubiquitnation. Consistent with this, Lys 124 of TRAF6 is indeed required for IL-17-mediated signalling pathway. IL-17-dependent TRAF6 ubiquitination and NFκB activation were greatly impaired in Traf6 −/− MEFs reconstituted with TRAF6 K124R mutant. Based on these findings, we propose the following model for IL-17-induced Act1-TRAF6-mediated NFκB activation. Act1 is recruited to IL-17R upon IL-17 stimulation, followed by the recruitment of TRAF6, where Act1 mediates TRAF6 ubiquitination. The polyubiquitinated TRAF6 recruits the TAK1-TAB2/3 and mediates the ubiquitination and activation of the TAK1 and IKK complex, resulting in activation of NFκB.

It is important to note that while TRAF6 deficiency abolished IL-17-induced NFκB and JNK activation, IL-17-mediated ERK phosphorylation was intact in TRAF6-deficient MEFs. However, the U-box region of Act1 is required for IL-17-induced NFκB, JNK and ERK activation. Furthermore, whereas Act1 is required for IL-17-mediated mRNA stabilization {Hartupee, 2007 2/id}, TRAF6 has been shown to be dispensable for this posttranscriptional regulation in response to IL-17 stimulation. These results suggest that the Act1 E3 activity is probably required for more IL-17-mediated signalling events than those mediated by TRAF6, implicating the presence of additional Act1 substrates in the IL-17 signalling pathway.

In summary, our study demonstrates that Act1 is a novel U-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligase whose activity is critical for IL-17-mediated TRAF6-dependent NFκB activation. Furthermore, our study shows that TRAF6 can only poorly ubiquitinate itself and Act1 functions as an E3 to efficiently promote TRAF6 polyubiquitination. The modified TRAF6 then recruits and ubiquitinates downstream signalling molecules (components in the TAK1 and IKK complex), leading to NFκB activation. Thus, Act1-mediated TRAF6 ubiquitination represents a new regulatory mechanism in IL-17 signalling pathway.
