The extracellular portion of the VEGF and PlGF receptor, Flt-1 (or VEGFR-1), 
consists of seven immunoglobulin-like domains. The second domain from the N 
terminus (Flt-1D2) is necessary and sufficient for high affinity VEGF binding. 
The 1.7 A resolution crystal structure of Flt-1D2 bound to VEGF revealed that 
this domain is a member of the I-set of the immunoglobulin superfamily, but has 
several unusual features including a region near the N terminus that bulges away 
from the domain rather than pairing with the neighboring beta-strand. Some of 
the residues in this region make contact with VEGF, raising the possibility that 
this bulge could be a consequence of VEGF binding and might not be present in 
the absence of ligand. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of Flt-1D2 
in its uncomplexed form determined by NMR spectroscopy. A semi-automated method 
for NOE assignment that takes advantage of the previously solved crystal 
structure was used to facilitate rapid analysis of the 3D NOESY spectra. The 
solution structure is very similar to the previously reported VEGF-bound crystal 
structure; the N-terminal bulge is present, albeit in a different conformation. 
We also report the 2.7 A crystal structure of Flt-1D2 in complex with VEGF 
solved in a different crystal form that reveals yet another conformation for the 
N-terminal bulge region. (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear NOEs indicate this region is 
flexible in solution; the crystal structures show that this region is able to 
adopt more than one conformation even when bound to VEGF. Thus, VEGF-binding is 
not accompanied by significant structural change in Flt-1D2, and the unusual 
structural features of Flt-1D2 are an intrinsic property of this domain.
