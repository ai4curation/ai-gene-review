Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is replicated and repaired by the mtDNA 
polymerase gamma, polγ. Polγ is composed of three subunits encoded by two 
nuclear genes: (1) POLG codes for the 140-kilodalton (kDa) catalytic subunit, 
p140 and (2) POLG2 encodes the ∼110-kDa homodimeric accessory subunit, p55. 
Specific mutations are associated with POLG- or POLG2-related disorders. During 
DNA replication the p55 accessory subunit binds to p140 and increases 
processivity by preventing polγ's dissociation from the template. To date, 
studies have demonstrated that homodimeric p55 disease variants are deficient in 
the ability to stimulate p140; however, all patients currently identified with 
POLG2-related disorders are heterozygotes. In these patients, we expect p55 to 
occur as 25% wild-type (WT) homodimers, 25% variant homodimers and 50% 
heterodimers. We report the development of a tandem affinity strategy to isolate 
p55 heterodimers. The WT/G451E p55 heterodimer impairs polγ function in vitro, 
demonstrating that the POLG2 c.1352G>A/p.G451E mutation encodes a dominant 
negative protein. To analyze the subcellular consequence of disease mutations in 
HEK293 cells, we designed plasmids encoding p55 disease variants tagged with 
green fluorescent protein (GFP). P205R and L475DfsX2 p55 variants exhibit 
irregular diffuse mitochondrial fluorescence and unlike WT p55, they fail to 
form distinct puncta associated with mtDNA nucleoids. Furthermore, homogenous 
preparations of P205R and L475DfsX2 p55 form aberrant reducible multimers. We 
predict that abnormal protein folding or aggregation or both contribute to the 
pathophysiology of these disorders. Examination of mitochondrial bioenergetics 
in stable cell lines overexpressing GFP-tagged p55 variants revealed impaired 
mitochondrial reserve capacity.
