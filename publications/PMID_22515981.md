The Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible 45 (GADD45) proteins have been 
implicated in regulation of many cellular functions including DNA repair, cell 
cycle control, senescence and genotoxic stress. However, the pro-apoptotic 
activities have also positioned GADD45 as an essential player in oncogenesis. 
Emerging functional evidence implies that GADD45 proteins serve as tumor 
suppressors in response to diverse stimuli, connecting multiple cell signaling 
modules. Defects in the GADD45 pathway can be related to the initiation and 
progression of malignancies. Moreover, induction of GADD45 expression is an 
essential step for mediating anti-cancer activity of multiple chemotherapeutic 
drugs and the absence of GADD45 might abrogate their effects in cancer cells. In 
this review, we present a comprehensive discussion of the functions of GADD45 
proteins, linking their regulation to effectors of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair 
and apoptosis. The ramifications regarding their roles as essential and central 
players in tumor growth suppression are also examined. We also extensively 
review recent literature to clarify how different chemotherapeutic drugs induce 
GADD45 gene expression and how its up-regulation and interaction with different 
molecular partners may benefit cancer chemotherapy and facilitate novel drug 
discovery.
