Complementary DNA (cDNA) clones encoding the heavy chain of the heterodimeric 
human membrane glycoprotein 4F2 have been isolated by immunoscreening of a 
lambda gt11 expression library. The identity of these clones has been confirmed 
by hybridization to RNA and DNA prepared from mouse L-cell transfectants, which 
were produced by whole cell gene transfer and selected for cell-surface 
expression of the human 4F2 heavy chain. DNA sequence analysis suggests that the 
4F2 heavy-chain cDNAs encode an approximately 526-amino acid type II membrane 
glycoprotein, which is composed of a large C-terminal extracellular domain, a 
single potential transmembrane region, and a 50-81 amino acid N-terminal 
intracytoplasmic domain. Southern blotting experiments have shown that the 4F2 
heavy-chain cDNAs are derived from a single-copy gene that has been highly 
conserved during mammalian evolution.
