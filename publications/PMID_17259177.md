In Escherichia coli the Cpx sensor regulator system senses different kinds of 
envelope stress and responds by triggering the expression of periplasmic folding 
factors and proteases. It consists of the membrane-anchored sensor kinase CpxA, 
the response regulator CpxR, and the periplasmic protein CpxP. The Cpx pathway 
is induced in vivo by a variety of signals including pH variation, osmotic 
stress, and misfolded envelope proteins and is inhibited by overproduced CpxP. 
Because it is not clear how the Cpx pathway is able to recognize and correspond 
to so many different signals we overproduced, solubilized, purified, and 
incorporated the complete membrane-integral CpxA protein into proteoliposomes to 
analyze its biochemical properties in more detail. Autokinase and 
phosphotransfer activities of the reconstituted CpxA-His6 protein were 
stimulated by KCl. NaCl also stimulated the activities but to a lesser extent. 
Other osmotic active solutes as glycine betaine, sucrose, and proline had no 
effect. The system was further characterized by testing for susceptibility to 
sensor kinase inhibitors. Among these, Closantel inhibited the activities of 
solubilized but not of the reconstituted CpxA-His6 protein. We further analyzed 
the effect of CpxP on CpxA activities. Purified tagless CpxP protein reduced the 
phosphorylation status of CpxA to 50% but had no effect on CpxA phosphotransfer 
or phosphatase activities. As the in vitro system excludes the involvement of 
other factors our finding is the first biochemical evidence for direct 
protein-protein interaction between the sensor kinase CpxA and the periplasmic 
protein CpxP resulting in a down-regulation of the autokinase activity of CpxA.
