Although the BRCA1 tumor suppressor has been implicated in many cellular 
processes, the biochemical mechanisms by which it influences these diverse 
pathways are poorly understood. The only known enzymatic function of BRCA1 is 
the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity mediated by its highly conserved RING domain. 
In vivo, BRCA1 associates with the BARD1 polypeptide to form a heterodimeric 
BRCA1/BARD1 complex that catalyzes autoubiquitination of BRCA1 and trans 
ubiquitination of other protein substrates. In most cases, BRCA1-dependent 
ubiquitination generates polyubiquitin chains bearing an unconventional K6 
linkage that does not appear to target proteins for proteasomal degradation. 
Since ubiquitin-dependent processes are usually mediated by cellular receptors 
with ubiquitin-binding motifs, we screened for proteins that specifically bind 
autoubiquitinated BRCA1. Here we report that the UBXN1 polypeptide, which 
contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) motif, recognizes autoubiquitinated BRCA1. 
This occurs through a bipartite interaction in which the UBA domain of UBXN1 
binds K6-linked polyubiquitin chains conjugated to BRCA1 while the C-terminal 
sequences of UBXN1 bind the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer in a ubiquitin-independent 
fashion. Significantly, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1/BARD1 is dramatically 
reduced in the presence of UBXN1, suggesting that UBXN1 regulates the enzymatic 
function of BRCA1 in a manner that is dependent on its ubiquitination status.
