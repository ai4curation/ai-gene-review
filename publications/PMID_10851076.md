IL-15 and SCF fail to induce NK differentiation and proliferation of CD34+ 
hematopoietic progenitors from chronic myeloid leukemia patients in contrast to 
normal stem cells although, both normal and leukemic CD34+ cells display 
comparable expression of c-kit or IL-15 receptor subunits. Interestingly, 
confocal microscopy analysis revealed that leukemic and most normal CD34+ cells 
produce and secrete IL-15, as shown by its trafficking through the Golgi 
apparatus and early endosomes. However, only leukemic progenitors express the 
membrane bound IL-15. Colocalization and internalization of IL-15Rbeta/gammac 
and IL-15Ralpha/gammac complexes indicated that IL-15 was specifically uptaken 
by leukemic progenitors. We also demonstrated that in both normal and leukemic 
progenitors, the signaling kinase Jak3 is constitutively pre-associated with the 
gammac chain. Anti-IL-15 neutralizing mAb treatment resulted in down-regulation 
of gammac chain and disruption of gammac/Jak3 interaction in normal but had no 
effect in leukemic progenitors. Our results suggest the existence in both normal 
and leukemic CD34+ cells of a constitutive production of a bioactive IL-15 that 
does not lead to NK differentiation and further indicate that membrane bound 
IL-15 and constitutive activation of gammac are hallmarks of leukemic 
progenitors. Oncogene (2000).
