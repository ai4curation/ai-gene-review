Adaptor proteins for the various growth factor receptors play a crucial role in 
signal transduction through tyrosine phosphorylation. Several candidates for 
adaptor proteins with potential effects on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
receptor-mediated signaling pathway have been identified by recent 
phosphoproteomic studies. Here, we focus on a novel protein, GAREM 
(Grb2-associated and regulator of Erk/MAPK) as a downstream molecule of the EGF 
receptor. GAREM is phosphorylated at tyrosine 105 and 453 after EGF stimulation. 
Grb2 was identified as its binding partner, and the proline-rich motifs of GAREM 
are recognized by the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2. In addition, the 
tyrosine phosphorylations of GAREM are necessary for its binding to Grb2. 
Because the amino acid sequence surrounding tyrosine 453 is similar to the 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, Shp2, a positive regulator of 
Erk, binds to GAREM in this phosphorylation-dependent manner. Consequently, Erk 
activation in response to EGF stimulation is regulated by the expression of 
GAREM in COS-7 and HeLa cells, which occurs independent of the presence of other 
binding proteins, such as Gab1 and SOS, to the activated EGF receptor. 
Furthermore, the expression of GAREM has an effect on the transformation 
activity of cultured cells. Together, these findings suggest that GAREM plays a 
key role in the ligand-mediated signaling pathway of the EGF receptor and the 
tumorigenesis of cells.

Abstract

Adaptor proteins for the various growth factor receptors play a crucial role in signal transduction through tyrosine phos pho ryl a tion. Several candidates for adaptor proteins with potential effects on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-mediated signaling pathway have been identified by recent phosphoproteomic studies. Here, we focus on a novel protein, GAREM ( G rb2- a ssociated and r egulator of E rk/ M APK) as a downstream molecule of the EGF receptor. GAREM is phos pho ryl a ted at tyrosine 105 and 453 after EGF stimulation. Grb2 was identified as its binding partner, and the proline-rich motifs of GAREM are recognized by the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2. In addition, the tyrosine phos pho ryl a tions of GAREM are necessary for its binding to Grb2. Because the amino acid sequence surrounding tyrosine 453 is similar to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, Shp2, a positive regulator of Erk, binds to GAREM in this phos pho ryl a tion-dependent manner. Consequently, Erk activation in response to EGF stimulation is regulated by the expression of GAREM in COS-7 and HeLa cells, which occurs independent of the presence of other binding proteins, such as Gab1 and SOS, to the activated EGF receptor. Furthermore, the expression of GAREM has an effect on the transformation activity of cultured cells. Together, these findings suggest that GAREM plays a key role in the ligand-mediated signaling pathway of the EGF receptor and the tumorigenesis of cells.

DISCUSSION

Members of the Gab family are known Grb2-binding proteins and regulators of downstream protein kinases such as Erk and Akt ( 3 â€“ 5 ). Unlike Gab1, GAREM does not have multiple phosphorylation sites or other functional domains such as PH domains; instead, it has proline-rich sequences that enable its binding to N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2 in response to EGF stimulation ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). Several phosphoproteomics studies have identified Tyr-453 to be one of the phosphorylation sites of GAREM ( 12 , 15 , 16 ). In addition to this site, we identified that the Tyr-105 phosphorylation occurs upon EGF stimulation. Although both tyrosine phosphorylation sites of GAREM were crucial for its binding to Grb2, neither Tyr-105 nor Tyr-453 is an effective direct binding site for the SH2 domain of Grb2. From these results, we speculate that the tyrosine phosphorylations might contribute to the conformational alteration of GAREM into its active form to facilitate interaction between the proline-rich motif of GAREM and SH3 domain of Grb2 in the EGF-stimulated cells.

On the other hand, the phosphorylation of Tyr-453 in GAREM plays an important role in the biological function of protein. The amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site Tyr-453 is LP phospho YEEL: this site is a good match to the consensus sequence of the Shp binding site present in the Gab or the insulin receptor substrate-1 family ( 27 , 28 ), which is also called an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif ( 29 , 30 ). In this study, we found that the phosphorylation of Tyr-453 and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like sequence surrounding GAREM may be necessary for the binding of GAREM to Shp2. Therefore, this binding might be directly caused by the enhanced activation of Erk in response to EGF stimulation. Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs normally exist in some receptor proteins. GAREM may provide an extra binding site for Shp2 on the plasma membrane. It may be involved in the formation of the activated EGF receptor complex, or it may indirectly associate with the EGF receptor via Grb2. In general, Gab1 was translocated to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on the PH domain and the phospholipids generated by the stimulation of several growth factors ( 31 ). In contrast to Gab1, GAREM localized at the plasma membrane with or without EGF stimulation (data not shown). GAREM cDNA has been cloned as a gene coding for the SAM domain-containing protein at its extreme C terminus. Recently, SAM domains have been shown to play a role in homotypic or heterotypic protein-protein interactions ( 32 , 33 ). Currently, we do not have any experimental evidence to show that a portion of the C-terminal region of GAREM could function as a SAM domain. Further study will be required to determine the mechanism of cellular localization of GAREM.

An interesting aspect of this complex is the question of whether or not the Gab family is included. However, GAREM may be able to bind the complex of Grb2 and Shp2 downstream of the EGF receptor independent of Gab1 and SOS. Consequently, a new independent pathway, Grb2-GAREM-Shp2, may be functionally generated for Erk activation in addition to the previously known pathways such as Grb2-SOS, Shc-Grb2-SOS, and Grb2-Gab-Shp2 at the plasma membrane. The precise relationship between GAREM and other binding proteins to the EGF receptor remains to be elucidated.

In addition to the EGF receptor, the signaling pathways of the receptor tyrosine kinases are closely linked to the transformation of mammalian cells ( 11 ). We have shown the relationship between the expression level of GAREM and the transformation of the cells may be important. Although NIH3T3 cells have been known to be devoid of endogenous EGF receptor ( 34 ), the effect of GAREM on tumorigenesis could be observed in NIH3T3 cells and HeLa cells without adding EGF. Thus, GAREM may function as a downstream molecule for not only the EGF receptor but also other receptor tyrosine kinases.

Interestingly, a GAREM mutant lacking the proline-rich domain has been identified, and this mutant was not able to bind to Grb2 ( Fig. 7 ). Because this mutant is not a splice variant of the wild-type GAREM, it may be difficult to generate it by simple gene mutation. The expression levels of this mutant protein in cultured cells or animal tissues are not yet clear. In our study, only a single protein band of GAREM was detected in the lysate of certain types of cultured cells such as COS-7, HeLa, 293, and A431 cells (data not shown). The expression of the GAREM gene (FLJ21610) has been identified by microarray analysis of multiple myeloma cells ( 35 ). Further, this gene is hypomethylated in various human colorectal carcinoma cell lines ( 36 ). The function of GAREM at physiological levels in normal cells or at abnormal levels in various tumor cells remains to be elucidated. We are currently analyzing the amount of GAREM protein and the level of Tyr-453 phosphorylation in various carcinoma cells to help understand the relationship between GAREM expression and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, screening of other interacting molecules in various cell lines, and the analysis of the function of SAM-like domains in the C-terminal of GAREM will help achieve a detailed understanding of its physiological functions.

In conclusion, we have identified GAREM, a novel adaptor protein in the growth factor-mediated signaling pathway. This protein may serve a crucial role in the regulation of the downstream molecules of the growth factor receptor as well as the Gab or insulin receptor substrate-1 family proteins.
