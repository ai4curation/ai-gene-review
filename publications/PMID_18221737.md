Telomeres are the capping structures of the eukaryotic chromosome ends. 
Tankyrase 1 is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that elongates telomeres in a 
telomerase-dependent manner. This function of tankyrase 1 is mediated by 
down-regulation of TRF1, a negative regulator of telomere access to telomerase. 
Namely, tankyrase 1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates (PARsylates) TRF1, which in turn 
dissociates TRF1 from telomeres. The resulting telomeres become better 
substrates for telomerase-mediated DNA extension. Tankyrase 1 has five 
independent TRF1 binding sites, ARC (ANK repeat cluster) I to V. Among them, the 
most C-terminal ARC V is required for TRF1 PARsylation and its release from 
telomeres. By contrast, functional significance of other four ARCs remains 
elusive. In this study, we generated a mutant tankyrase 1 that had inactive ARC 
IV and lacked ARC V but elongated telomeres without TRF1 PARsylation. Consistent 
with the failure in PARsylation, this mutant only marginally released TRF1 from 
telomeres. Still, it decreased telomere binding of POT1, a downstream effector 
of TRF1-mediated telomere length control, and elongated the telomeric 
3'-overhang as the wild-type tankyrase 1 did. Thus even without TRF1 
PARsylation, this mutant tankyrase 1 seemed to loosen the closed structure of 
the telomeric heterochromatin. These findings suggest a new role for multiple 
ARCs in telomere extension by tankyrase 1.
