Human colostrum is an important source of protective, nutritional and 
developmental factors for the newborn. We have investigated the low abundance 
proteins in the aqueous phase of human colostrum, after depletion of the major 
proteins secretory IgA, lactoferrin, alpha-lactalbumin and HSA by 
immunoabsorption, using 2-D LC and gel-based proteomic methods. One hundred and 
fifty-one proteins were identified, 83 of which have not been previously 
reported in human colostrum, or milk. This is the first comprehensive proteomic 
analysis of human colostrum produced during the first 48 h of lactation.
