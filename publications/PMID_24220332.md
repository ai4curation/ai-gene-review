Integrin α3β1, a receptor for laminins, is involved in the structural and 
functional organization of epithelial organs, including the lung, kidney, and 
skin. Recently, a missense mutation that causes substitution of Arg628 with Pro 
(R628P) in the calf-1 domain of human α3 was shown to be associated with 
disorders of the lung, kidney, and skin. Here, we found that the R628P mutation 
leads to aberrations in the posttranslational processing of α3. Specifically, α3 
with the R628P mutation showed hardly any cleavage at the calf-2 domain, which 
usually occurs in the Golgi apparatus during the delivery of de novo-synthesized 
α3. The mutant α3 retained the ability to associate with integrin β1, but not 
with the tetraspanin CD151, and the bound β1 was a partially glycosylated 
immature form, the maturation of which also takes place in the Golgi apparatus. 
Furthermore, the cell surface expression of the mutant protein was markedly 
reduced. These results suggest that the R628P mutation leads to a deficit in the 
transport of α3β1 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. When Arg628 was mutated to 
Gln or Glu, instead of Pro, the resulting mutants did not display aberrations in 
processing or CD151 binding, indicating that the presence of Pro, rather than 
the absence of Arg, at amino acid residue 628 of α3 is important for the 
abnormalities in the R628P mutant. In support of this notion, a homology 
modeling analysis of the calf-1 domain of α3 showed that replacement with Pro, 
but not with Gln or Glu, caused partial disruption of the β-sheet structures. 
Furthermore, the ER-associated degradation of the R628P mutant was not enhanced 
compared with that of the wild-type protein, suggesting that the deficits in the 
posttranslational processing and cell surface expression of the R628P mutant are 
independent of the ER-associated degradation, but arise from the defect in its 
export from the ER. We conclude that the calf-1 domain is required for the 
transport of α3 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus to maintain the integrity of 
epithelial tissues, and hence the impairment of the calf-1 domain by the R628P 
mutation leads to severe diseases of the kidneys, lungs, and skin.
