Proteolytic resistance of Notch prior to ligand binding depends on the 
structural integrity of a negative regulatory region (NRR) of the receptor that 
immediately precedes the transmembrane segment. The NRR includes the 3 
Lin12/Notch repeats and the juxtamembrane heterodimerization domain, the region 
of Notch1 most frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
lymphoma (T-ALL). Here, we report the x-ray structure of the Notch1 NRR in its 
autoinhibited conformation. A key feature of the Notch1 structure that maintains 
its closed conformation is a conserved hydrophobic plug that sterically occludes 
the metalloprotease cleavage site. Crystal packing interactions involving a 
highly conserved, exposed face on the third Lin12/Notch repeat suggest that this 
site may normally be engaged in intermolecular or intramolecular protein-protein 
interactions. The majority of known T-ALL-associated point mutations map to 
residues in the hydrophobic interior of the Notch1 NRR. A novel mutation 
(H1545P), which alters a residue at the crystal-packing interface, leads to 
ligand-independent increases in signaling in reporter gene assays despite only 
mild destabilization of the NRR, suggesting that it releases the autoinhibitory 
clamp on the heterodimerization domain imposed by the Lin12/Notch repeats. The 
Notch1 NRR structure should facilitate a search for antibodies or compounds that 
stabilize the autoinhibited conformation.
