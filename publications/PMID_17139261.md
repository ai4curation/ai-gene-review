critical for TR3 to inhibit MDM2 expression. TR3 downregulates p53 
transcriptional activity by blocking its acetylation, leading to a decrease on 
the transcription level of MDM2. Furthermore, TR3 binding to p53 obstructs its 
ubiquitination and degradation induced by MDM2, resulting in the MDM2 
ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, TR3 could enhance p53-mediated 
apoptosis induced by UV irradiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate 
that p53 mediates the suppression of TR3 on MDM2 at both transcriptional and

Abstract

MDM2 is an oncoprotein whose transforming potential is activated by overexpression. The expression level of MDM2 is negatively regulated by orphan receptor TR3 that mainly acts as a transcriptional factor to regulate gene expression. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unclear. Here, we present the first evidence that inhibition of TR3 on MDM2 is mediated by p53. We found that TR3 directly interacts with p53 but not MDM2, and such interaction is critical for TR3 to inhibit MDM2 expression. TR3 downregulates p53 transcriptional activity by blocking its acetylation, leading to a decrease on the transcription level of MDM2. Furthermore, TR3 binding to p53 obstructs its ubiquitination and degradation induced by MDM2, resulting in the MDM2 ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, TR3 could enhance p53-mediated apoptosis induced by UV irradiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that p53 mediates the suppression of TR3 on MDM2 at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level and suggest TR3 as a potential target to develop new anticancer agents that restrict MDM2-induced tumor progression.

Introduction

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a well-characterized transcription factor which directly activates numerous genes that are involved in many cellular functions ( Vogelstein et al, 2000 ). Its function is crucial for the prevention of tumor development. For example, p53 can initiate cell cycle arrest and trigger cell death by apoptosis in response to anticancer therapy ( Vousden, 2000 ). It has been found that p53 is mutated in about 55% of human tumors. These mutations are mainly single amino-acid substitutions in the DNA-binding domain of p53( Hollstein et al, 1994 ).

In normal cells, p53 is maintained at very low levels due to rapid degradation mediated by MDM2 (mouse double minute) protein. MDM2 is an oncoprotein whose transforming potential is activated by overexpression ( Fakharzadeh et al, 1991 ). It binds to p53 and functions as an ubiquitin E3 ligase to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomes, thus restraining the oncosuppressor functions of p53( Momand et al, 1992 ; Haupt et al, 1997 ; Kubbutat et al, 1997 ; Roth et al, 1998 ). Therefore, MDM2 is a negative regulator of p53, which contributes to the dysfunctions of p53. The negative regulation of MDM2 on p53 can be neutralized by partner proteins and specific protein modifications. In response to stress or DNA damage, p53 is stabilized through phosphorylation on itself by other kinases or expression of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF ( Prives and Hall, 1999 ). HIPK2 contributes to drug-induced modulation of MDM2 activity at transcriptional (through p53Ser46 phosphorylation) and post-transcriptional (through p53-independent subcellular relocalization and proteasomal degradation) levels ( Peng et al, 2001 ). Transcription regulator YY1 interacts with MDM2, stimulating MDM2–p53 complex formation and p53 ubiquitination ( Sui et al, 2004 ). YY1 also directly binds to p53 transactivation domain and blocks p53–p300 binding ( Gronroos et al, 2004 ).

TR3 (also known as NGFI-B or Nur77), an orphan receptor ( Chang and Kokontis, 1988 ; Hazel et al, 1988 ), belongs to the steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor superfamily and functions as a transcription factor that negatively or positively regulates gene expression ( Kastner et al, 1995 ; Mangelsdorf and Evans, 1995 ). TR3 is a unique nuclear protein required not only for cell proliferation but also for apoptosis. Our previous studies revealed that TR3 can heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor (RXR) or another orphan receptor COUP-TF to regulate their transcriptional activity, which subsequently contributes to regulation of cell growth and apoptosis in response to retinoids and hormones ( Wu et al, 1997a , 1997b ). Recently, Zhang's group found that the mitogenic effect of TR3 was associated with its presence in the nucleus, whereas its apoptotic effect was correlated with its mitochondrial localization in the same lung cancer ( Kolluri et al, 2003 ). We also demonstrated that treatment of phorbol ester 12- O -tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate (TPA) induced translocation of TR3 from the nucleus to the mitochondria where it triggered cytochrome c release and initiated apoptosis in gastric cancer cells ( Wu et al, 2002 ; Lin et al, 2004 ). Upon stimulation of apoptosis by a variety of apoptosis-inducing agents, translocation of nuclear TR3 to the mitochondria also occurred in prostate cancer ( Li et al, 2000 ), colon cancer ( Wilson et al, 2003 ), lung cancer ( Kolluri et al, 2003 ), and ovarian ( Holmes et al, 2003 ) cells. Therefore, TR3 is indeed involved in both cellular proliferation and apoptosis, which are considered to be resulted from a disturbance in the balance between these two processes.

The fact that TR3 functions in the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α through decrease of MDM2 expression ( Yoo et al, 2004 ) suggests that MDM2 may be a major target of TR3 function. The mechanism by which TR3 downregulates the expression of MDM2 has not been reported. Direct transcriptional regulation on the promoter of MDM2 by TR3 is unlikely, because DNA binding of TR3 is not required for this process ( Yoo et al, 2004 ). Therefore, there might be some additional factors involved in the TR3–MDM2 cross-talk.

In this report, we demonstrated for the first time that p53 physically interacts with TR3 and the interaction is crucial for TR3 to inhibit MDM2. TR3 binding suppresses the transcriptional activity of p53 by blocking its acetylation, leading to the repression of MDM2 transcription. TR3 also enhanced p53-mediated apoptosis induced by irradiation of UV. In addition, TR3 binding prevents p53 from MDM2-induced degradation through the obstruction of p53 ubiquitination, which subsequently results in MDM2 ubiquitination and degradation. Taken together, our study has revealed a unique TR3–p53–MDM2 pathway in which TR3 and p53 cooperatively act to regulate MDM2 functions.

Discussion

MDM2 protein is overexpressed in a series of human tumors underscoring its involvement in the development of these human disease ( Leach et al, 1993 ). Although expression of MDM2 is activated by p53 at the transcription level ( Barak et al, 1993 ), the major function of MDM2 is to induce p53 proteasomal degradation ( Haupt et al, 1997 ; Kubbutat et al, 1997 ). Therefore, MDM2 functions as a negative feedback regulator to maintain p53 at a low level. And thus, the destabilization of MDM2 and stabilization of p53 are of importance to provide a potential approach for cancer therapy. Recent studies indicate an important role of orphan receptor TR3 in inhibition of MDM2 protein expression ( Yoo et al, 2004 ). However, the regulatory mechanism between TR3 and MDM2 cross-talk is largely unknown. In the present study, we showed a novel signal pathway in which p53 acts as an inter-link mediating TR3–MDM2 cross-talk. We demonstrated that (1) TR3 did not interact directly with MDM2, but directly interacted with p53, and its inhibition on MDM2 required the mediation of p53; (2) TR3–p53 binding led to the decrease of p53 transcriptional activity through inhibition of p53 acetylation, resulting in repression of MDM2 mRNA; (3) TR3 had a higher binding affinity to p53 than to MDM2. TR3–p53 interaction led to the separation of MDM2 from p53, which protected p53 from MDM2-induced degradation, and promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of MDM2 itself; (4) p53-dependent TR3 inhibition on MDM2 did not impair cell cycle progression while induced apoptosis, and TR3 could enhance p53-mediated apoptosis induced by UV irradiation. Therefore, our study reveals a novel model for regulatory mechanism of TR3 on MDM2 at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels ( Figure 8 ).

p53 occupies a central position in signaling network through its specific transcriptional activations and post-translational modifications ( Vogelstein et al, 2000 ). Although TR3 has been reported to exert its inhibition on endogenous MDM2 expression ( Figure 1A ) ( Yoo et al, 2004 ), direct interaction or binding between TR3 and MDM2 could not be observed ( Figure 2 ). In the cross-talk between TR3 and MDM2, p53 appears to act as an adapting protein, as it physically interacted with TR3 as well as MDM2 ( Figure 2 ), and such interaction brought TR3 to the proximity of MDM2, facilitating TR3 to inhibit MDM2 ( Figure 3 ). Moreover, the integration of p53 was requisite in its mediation role ( Figure 3C and D ). Thus, we demonstrated, for the first time, the requirement of p53 in mediating the inhibitory effect of TR3 on MDM2 expression. The role of p53 as a mediator in signal transduction has often been identified. For example, the multifunctional transcription regulator YY1 interacts with MDM2 and such interaction is competitively inhibited by ARF, which is probably mediated by p53 ( Gronroos et al, 2004 ; Sui et al, 2004 ). Further study showed that as a result of downregulating p53 transcriptional activity, TR3 indirectly extended its inhibitory effect on the transcriptional activity of MDM2 promoter ( Figure 5C ) and expression of MDM2 gene ( Figure 5A ). In this process, the event of TR3–p53 binding was crucial, as the truncation mutant TR3/MD1, which is noninteractive with p53, failed to exert the above-mentioned function ( Figure 5A ). Regulation of p53 acetylation by TR3 seems to be an essential step. TR3 significantly repressed p300-induced p53 transcriptional activity ( Figure 4H ), and drastically diminished p300-induced p53 acetylation ( Figure 4G ). p300 can form a complex with MDM2, which facilitates MDM2-mediated p53 degradation ( Grossman et al, 1998 ). Conversely, p300 was also shown to stabilize p53 after DNA damage ( Yuan et al, 1999 ). These evidences gave rise to another intriguing possibility that whether TR3 could maintain p53 stability by means of competing with p300 in binding p53? Further studies with regard to these interesting issues are been carrying out.

p53 normally functions as an integrator of stress response signals by activating or repressing the transcription of genes that regulate cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis ( Meek, 1999 ; Prives and Hall, 1999 ). Although Daxx, which has been shown to potentiate Fas-mediated apoptosis ( Zhao et al, 2004 ), repressed the transcriptional activity of p53 toward the p21waf1/cip1 promoter, it had no effects on the induction of proapoptotic genes such as bax, PIG3, and AIP1( Gostissa et al, 2004 ). Here, we showed that TR3 failed to regulate cell cycle progression but could induce apoptosis via activation of p53 under UV irradiation, although it repressed p53-dependent transcription of the p21waf1/cip1 gene ( Figures 1D , 4 and 5D ). We also found that overexpression of TR3 sensitized hepatoma cells to UV-induced cell death ( Figure 5D ), and this process was dependent on p53 ( Figure 5E ). These results indicate that such an effect requires p53, and the physiological levels of p53 protein are important in setting the threshold for TR3-mediated apoptosis. The fact that activation of p53 results in elevated levels of apoptosis, which could be suppressed by MDM2 expression ( Zhao et al, 2004 ), suggests that MDM2 can protect cells from p53-mediated apoptosis. In line with these observations, we also found that TR3 was able to enhance p53-dependent apoptosis induced by UV irradiation ( Figure 5D ), probably through the inhibition of MDM2 expression ( Figure 1D ). Therefore, in light of our evidence, it is fascinating to speculate that TR3 may exert a dual role through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional pathways to inhibit MDM2 expression, and p53 protein provides a linking platform for the interaction between TR3 and MDM2. Indeed, this was the unique role of TR3 in maintaining p53 protein levels by inducing MDM2 ubiquitination and degradation ( Figure 7D and E ). Therefore, the role of TR3 on MDM2 self-ubiquitination may be a side effect, which ensures the normalization of p53–MDM2 feedback loop. In addition, our study also points out that when p53 acts as a mediator in TR3–MDM2 pathway, although its transcriptional activity is inhibited by TR3, it could still utilize another avenue to cooperate with TR3 in inhibiting MDM2 expression. How TR3 involves in such a complex regulatory process and the exact mechanism by which the repressive function of TR3 operates specifically toward some p53-induced apoptotic genes requires further elucidation.

MDM2 functions as a ubiquitin ligase E3 to promote its self-degradation and the degradation of p53 ( Fang et al, 2000 ). Thus, the MDM2–p53 feedback loop represents a cellular autoregulatory paradigm, finely tuning p53 function ( Momand et al, 2000 ). TR3 also inhibited exogenous MDM2 expression ( Figure 7G ), is such inhibition by TR3 associated with the regulation of MDM2–p53 feedback loop? Here, we propose a mechanism for the MDM2–p53 loop regulated by TR3, that is, interaction with TR3 prevented p53 from MDM2 ubiquitination-degradation, resulting in MDM2 self-degradation. When TR3, p53, and MDM2 coexpressed in 293 cells, MDM2-induced p53 degradation was dramatically neutralized by TR3, and p53 kept its normal level even in the presence of MDM2 ( Figure 6A ), strongly suggesting a novel function of TR3 in maintaining p53 stability. TR3 downregulated the expression levels of MDM2 but not p53 ( Figure 7H and I ). Further experiment verified that this action was via the blockage of ubiquitination pathway induced by MDM2 ( Figure 6A ). Importantly, this effect was also closely associated with the TR3–p53 interaction, because the p53 noninteractive TR3/MD1 lost such function ( Figure 6 ). Therefore, repression of MDM2 by TR3 may lead to stabilization of p53 and a shift in the negative MDM2 feedback loop. Recent studies point out that HIPK2 is able to rescue p53 transcriptional activity and apoptotic outcome by overcoming MDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation ( Di et al, 2005 ). HIPK2 and MDM2 form a stable complex that, in response to DNA damage, allows MDM2 detachment from phosphorylated p53Ser46. The end result of this action is HIPK2-dependent MDM2 destabilization and p53 stabilization ( D'Orazi et al, 2002 ; Di et al, 2005 ). Conversely, the nuclear corepressor KAPI, as a novel MDM2-interacting protein, cooperates with MDM2 to inhibit p53 acetylation, stimulate p53 ubiquitination, and inhibit p53 transcription and apoptosis functions ( Wang et al, 2005 ). In addition, the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 turnover might be tightly linked to its own instability. Deletion of the central domains or the C-terminal RING finger of MDM2 not only destroys its ability to degrade p53 but also cause stabilization of MDM2 itself ( Oren, 2003 ). Here, we demonstrated that the TR3-induced ubiquitination and degradation of MDM2 ( Figure 7D–F ) is due to a higher affinity of TR3 for p53 than that between p53 and MDM2 ( Figure 7B and C ). In addition, we observed that p53 was located in the nucleus when transfected by itself, and MDM2 could promote p53 nuclear export. However, cotransfection of TR3 hindered p53 nuclear export even in the presence of MDM2 ( Figure 7A ), which might provide a mechanism for TR3 to protect p53 from MDM2 degradation. These observations revealed a connection between p53 stabilization and MDM2 destabilization regulated by TR3, not only demonstrating that inhibition of MDM2 by TR3 is important for p53 stabilization but also suggesting that TR3 stabilizing p53 protein is a unique property that is independent of other previously described functions of TR3, such as its transcriptional regulation of mitogenic activities in the nucleus ( Kolluri et al, 2003 ).

In summary, our studies identified the nuclear transcription factor TR3 as a novel p53-interaction protein. TR3, via p53, inhibited MDM2 mRNA and protein expression, finally sequestrated MDM2 from p53, and protected p53 from MDM2-induced degradation. Because malignant cells with high-level expression of MDM2 are aggressive, and destabilization of MDM2 and stabilization of p53 are potentially significant approaches for cancer therapy, our research may provide an insight into the underlying mechanisms, revealing that TR3 may be a novel target for the development of new anticancer strategy that may restrict MDM2-induced tumor progression.
