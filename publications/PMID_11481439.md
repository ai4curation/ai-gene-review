Thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs) from mammalian cells contain an essential 
selenocysteine residue in the conserved C-terminal sequence Gly-Cys-SeCys-Gly 
forming a selenenylsulfide in the oxidized enzyme. Reduction by NADPH generates 
a selenolthiol, which is the active site in reduction of Trx. The 
three-dimensional structure of the SeCys498Cys mutant of rat TrxR in complex 
with NADP(+) has been determined to 3.0-A resolution by x-ray crystallography. 
The overall structure is similar to that of glutathione reductase (GR), 
including conserved amino acid residues binding the cofactors FAD and NADPH. 
Surprisingly, all residues directly interacting with the substrate glutathione 
disulfide in GR are conserved despite the failure of glutathione disulfide to 
act as a substrate for TrxR. The 16-residue C-terminal tail, which is unique to 
mammalian TrxR, folds in such a way that it can approach the active site 
disulfide of the other subunit in the dimer. A model of the complex of TrxR with 
Trx suggests that electron transfer from NADPH to the disulfide of the substrate 
is possible without large conformational changes. The C-terminal extension 
typical of mammalian TrxRs has two functions: (i) it extends the electron 
transport chain from the catalytic disulfide to the enzyme surface, where it can 
react with Trx, and (ii) it prevents the enzyme from acting as a GR by blocking 
the redox-active disulfide. Our results suggest that mammalian TrxR evolved from 
the GR scaffold rather than from its prokaryotic counterpart. This evolutionary 
switch renders cell growth dependent on selenium.
