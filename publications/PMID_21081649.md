NF-κB regulates the expression of a large number of target genes involved in the 
immune and inflammatory response, apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation 
and survival. In this study, we identified SIRT2 as a deacetylase of the 
transcription factor p65. SIRT2 is a member of the family of sirtuins, which are 
NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases involved in several cellular processes. SIRT2 
interacts with p65 in the cytoplasm and deacetylates p65 in vitro and in vivo at 
Lys310. Moreover, p65 is hyperacetylated at Lys310 in Sirt2(-/-) cells after 
TNFα stimulation, which results in the increase in expression of a subset of p65 
acetylation-dependent target genes. Our work provides evidence that p65 is 
deacetylated by SIRT2 in the cytoplasm to regulate the expression of specific 
NF-κB-dependent genes.
