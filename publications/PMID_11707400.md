In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), disulfide bonds are simultaneously formed in 
nascent proteins and removed from incorrectly folded or assembled molecules. In 
this compartment, the redox state must be, therefore, precisely regulated. Here 
we show that both human Ero1-Lalpha and Ero1-Lbeta (hEROs) facilitate disulfide 
bond formation in immunoglobulin subunits by selectively oxidizing PDI. 
Disulfide bond formation is controlled by hEROs, which stand at a crucial point 
of an electron-flow starting from nascent secretory proteins and passing through 
PDI. The redox state of ERp57, another ER-resident oxidoreductase, is not 
affected by over-expression of Ero1-Lalpha, suggesting that parallel and 
specific pathways control oxidative protein folding in the ER. Mutants in the 
Ero1-Lalpha CXXCXXC motif act as dominant negatives by limiting immunoglobulin 
oxidation. PDI-dependent oxidative folding in living cells can thus be 
manipulated by using hERO variants.

Abstract

In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), disulfide bonds are simultaneously formed in nascent proteins and removed from incorrectly folded or assembled molecules. In this compartment, the redox state must be, therefore, precisely regulated. Here we show that both human Ero1-Lα and Ero1-Lβ (hEROs) facilitate disulfide bond formation in immunoglobulin subunits by selectively oxidizing PDI. Disulfide bond formation is controlled by hEROs, which stand at a crucial point of an electron-flow starting from nascent secretory proteins and passing through PDI. The redox state of ERp57, another ER-resident oxidoreductase, is not affected by over-expression of Ero1-Lα, suggesting that parallel and specific pathways control oxidative protein folding in the ER. Mutants in the Ero1-Lα CXXCXXC motif act as dominant negatives by limiting immunoglobulin oxidation. PDI-dependent oxidative folding in living cells can thus be manipulated by using hERO variants.

Introduction

To assist the folding of proteins destined for the secretory pathway and extracellular space, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells contains a vast array of chaperones and enzymes ( Gething and Sambrook, 1992 ; Ellgaard et al., 1999 ). As many secretory proteins contain disulfide bonds, a central role is played by ER-resident oxidoreductases, such as PDI, ERp72 (CaBP1), ERp57 and P5 (CaBP2). Recently, PDI and ERp57 have been shown to react directly and selectively with different substrate proteins and, therefore, to participate in distinct oxidative pathways ( Molinari and Helenius, 1999 , 2000 ). Preferential import of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) from the cytosol has been proposed to generate oxidizing conditions in the ER ( Hwang et al., 1992 ). However, the redox state must be precisely regulated within the ER, as in this organelle disulfide bonds are simultaneously formed in nascent proteins and removed from incorrectly folded or assembled polypeptides ( Helenius et al., 1992 ). The process of disulfide bond formation has been elegantly reconstructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . PDI molecules that are reduced after donating a disulfide bond to cargo proteins are re-oxidized by Ero1p, the product of the essential ERO1 gene ( Frand and Kaiser, 1999 ). Ero1p has been shown to oxidize PDI and another ER oxidoreductase, Mpd2p ( Frand and Kaiser, 1999 ) and to require flavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor ( Tu et al., 2000 ), but the mechanisms that control its re-oxidation in vivo remain to be elucidated. The phenotype of yeast cells lacking functional Ero1p can be alleviated by diamide ( Pollard et al., 1998 ) and suppressed by disruption of the glutathione synthase gene ( Cuozzo and Kaiser, 1999 ). These findings suggest that Ero1p serves mainly as an oxidant, and that GSH may act as a buffer of the oxidant power of Ero1p.

We cloned two human members of the ERO1 family, ERO1-Lα and ERO1-Lβ (hEROs), which show different tissue distribution and transcriptional regulation. Only ERO1-Lβ is induced during the unfolded protein response ( Pagani et al., 2000 ). Nevertheless, both genes complement the ero1-1 yeast mutant ( Cabibbo et al., 2000 ; Pagani et al., 2000 ). Ero1-Lα can be found in mixed disulfides with PDI in mammalian cells ( Benham et al., 2000 ) confirming its involvement in the pathways of disulfide bond formation.

To investigate and compare the function of Ero1-Lα and Ero1-Lβ, we monitored the rate and efficiency of oxidative folding of two immunoglobulin subunits, J and κ chains, in the ER of mammalian cells over-expressing either Ero1-Lα or Ero1-Lβ. Our results show that both oxidireductins facilitate disulfide bond formation in cargo proteins. The two hEROs form mixed disulfides with PDI and other unidentified proteins. Covalent complexes with ERp72, ERp57 and P5 are not detected, suggesting that selective protein–protein interactions underlie the control of the redox state in the ER. Certain Ero1-Lα mutants act as dominant negatives; therefore, the activity of hEROs seems to play a pivotal role in controlling disulfide bond formation. The fact that immunoglobulin oxidation can be manipulated by a defined redox enzyme has implications for the control of humoral immunity.

Discussion

There is general agreement that the exocytic pathway is more oxidizing than the cytosol ( Hwang et al., 1992 ; Cuozzo and Kaiser, 1999 ), but it is not entirely clear how this gradient is generated. In the absence of a direct means to measure the local ER redox conditions, we monitored disulfide bond formation in two soluble Ig subunits: J chains, which carry a single N -glycan and are unable to reach a transport competent structure ( Mancini et al., 2000 ), and κ chains, which can be exported from the ER ( Reddy et al., 1996 ; S.Ingrassia, A.Mezghrani and R.Sitia, unpublished results). Owing to the rapid formation of disulfide bonds in nascent Ig chains ( Bergman and Kuehl, 1979 ) we used DTT to uncouple oxidation from translocation ( Valetti and Sitia, 1994 ) and more easily uncover potential effects of hEROs. Using this technique, disulfide bond formation can be synchronized and, as importantly, a cysteine oxidation wave can be studied with little concomitant disulfide isomerization.

With this assay, we showed that both Ero1-Lα and Ero1-Lβ accelerate oxidative protein folding in the ER of human cells. This function is dependent on the presence of a functional hERO, as mutants in the conserved CXXCXXC motif show different activities. As in yeast complementation assays ( Cabibbo et al ., 2000 ), the C391A mutant displayed weaker activity on the oxidation of JcM, whereas the second and third cysteines were essential for proper function. The C394A and C397A mutants inhibited oxidative folding of both JcM and κ chains, possibly competing with endogenous Ero molecules for binding to PDI and/or to the recharging machinery. We cannot exclude a dominant-negative effect by direct interaction with endogenous Ero1-Lα. Inhibiting oxidative folding by introducing non-functional oxidoreductins could represent an important tool to identify the natural substrates of the hEROs–PDI driven pathway and analyse the cellular responses to redox imbalances.

Ero1-Lα and Ero1-Lβ accelerate the generation of both intra-chain and inter-chain bonds. The absence of mixed disulfides with JcM suggests that their activity is not due to direct interactions with cargo proteins. Thus, hEROs do not seem to have direct chaperone functions, but rather modulate the activity of PDI. Indeed, covalent complexes containing one PDI and one hERO are readily detected in HeLa transfectants (Figures 4 and 5 ). These complexes are present also in stable HeLa transfectants expressing low amounts of the tagged-transgene, suggesting that they are not artefacts due to over-expression, but rather intermediates in the electron transfer chain in the ER lumen. This interpretation is supported by the absence of such complexes from deletion or replacement Ero1-Lα mutants that show no functional activity (T.Simmen, G.Bertoli and R.Sitia, unpublished observations). The weaker activity of Ero1-LαC391A may depend on the formation of transient mixed disulfides with PDI ( Benham et al., 2000 ) or on the larger complexes formed by this mutant. The presence of hEROs–PDI and PDI–JcM mixed disulfides but not of hEROs–JcM complexes 7 suggests that electrons are transferred from nascent cargo proteins to hEROs via PDI (Figure 8 ). The mechanisms responsible for the re-oxidation of hEROs remain to be established. Whereas covalent complexes with PDI are easily detectable, we did not detect mixed disulfides between hEROs and three ER other abundant oxidoreductases, ERp57, ERp72 or p5. It is possible that these intermediates are too transient to be detected. On the other hand, the data in Figure 5 D indicate that in human cells the redox state of ERp57 is not modulated by hEROs. This differs from that observed in S.cerevisiae , where Ero1p seems to transfer oxidative equivalents to PDI, Mpd2 ( Frand and Kaiser, 1999 ) and possibly also Mpd1 ( Norgaard et al., 2001 ).

How then is ERp57 oxidized? An indirect role of PDI is not so likely as the ERp57 redox state was not affected by the presence of abundant oxidized PDI in HeLa transfectants. Other proteins endowed with oxidase activity, such as the sulphydryl oxidases found in the secretory compartment ( Hoober et al ., 1996 , 1999 ), might be in charge of controlling ERp57. With its interactors calnexin and calreticulin, ERp57 is thought to form a folding pathway that assists a class of glycoproteins ( Oliver et al ., 1997 , 1999 ; Molinari and Helenius, 2000 ). Neither J nor κ chains, which carry a single or no glycan respectively, associate with calnexin or calreticulin during folding. Instead they utilize BiP as a chaperone and the hEROs–PDI system for disulfide bond formation. The thought of parallel folding pathways in the ER using different chaperones and folding enzymes, and displaying different substrate specificities, needs to be further explored.

While in S.cerevisiae PDI is present predominantly in the oxidized state ( Frand and Kaiser, 1999 ; Tu et al., 2000 ), we found that the vast majority of PDI is partially reduced in HeLa, COS and U937 cells. Although scarce at steady state, a more oxidized form of PDI becomes detectable in HeLa cells soon during the recovery from DTT exposure, suggesting that cells rapidly activate robust responses to restore the optimal redox levels. As similar situation is observed for ERp57, it seems that the molecule(s) that control the ERp57 redox state are also activated by exposure to DTT.

The small pool of oxidized PDI in mammalian cells suggests that oxidative equivalents are rapidly transferred to cargo proteins, in agreement with the decrease of PDI–JcM mixed disulfides after DTT removal (Figure 3 ). Thus, electrons flow from nascent proteins to either Ero1-Lα or Ero1-Lβ, via PDI (Figure 8 ). The topological restrictions imposed by protein–protein interactions may enable the cell to localize and contain oxidation and reduction within the same cellular compartment ( Tortorella et al ., 1998 ).

Our studies reveal that Ero1-Lα and Ero1-Lβ are similar with respect to oxidoreductase binding and in assisting PDI oxidation. Why do humans and mice have two genes for a conserved function, fulfilled by a single essential gene in yeast? Intriguingly, Ero1-Lβ shows a higher degree of similarity to yeast Ero1p than Ero1-Lα in the presumed active sites ( Pagani et al ., 2000 ) raising the possibility that mammalian cells have evolved more subtle ways to control the ER redox state. An excess of oxidation may be toxic for cells, favouring protein aggregation in the ER and possibly activating signalling pathways. Pre liminary data suggest that Ero1-Lβ is more active than Ero1-Lα in sustaining oxidative folding. When the oxidative power of Ero1-Lα is overwhelmed, unfolded proteins will accumulate and rapidly induce synthesis of Ero1-Lβ via the unfolded protein response pathway (Figure 8 ).
