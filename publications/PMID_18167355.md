The loss of a glutamic acid residue in the AAA-ATPase (ATPases associated with 
diverse cellular activities) torsinA is responsible for most cases of early 
onset autosomal dominant primary dystonia. In this study, we found that snapin, 
which binds SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25,000 Da) and enhances 
the association of the SNARE complex with synaptotagmin, is an interacting 
partner for both wild type and mutant torsinA. Snapin co-localized with 
endogenous torsinA on dense core granules in PC12 cells and was recruited to 
perinuclear inclusions containing mutant DeltaE-torsinA in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y 
cells. In view of these observations, synaptic vesicle recycling was analyzed 
using the lipophilic dye FM1-43 and an antibody directed against an 
intravesicular epitope of synaptotagmin I. We found that overexpression of wild 
type torsinA negatively affects synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Conversely, 
overexpression of DeltaE-torsinA in neuroblastoma cells increases FM1-43 uptake. 
Knockdown of snapin and/or torsinA using small interfering RNAs had a similar 
inhibitory effect on the exo-endocytic process. In addition, down-regulation of 
torsinA causes the persistence of synaptotagmin I on the plasma membrane, which 
closely resembles the effect observed by the overexpression of the 
DeltaE-torsinA mutant. Altogether, these findings suggest that torsinA plays a 
role together with snapin in regulated exocytosis and that DeltaE-torsinA exerts 
its pathological effects through a loss of function mechanism. This may affect 
neuronal uptake of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, playing a role in the 
development of dystonic movements.
