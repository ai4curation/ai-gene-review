The signaling pathway downstream of the mammalian interleukin-1 receptor 
(IL-1R)/Toll-like receptor (TLR) is evolutionally conserved with that mediated 
by the Drosophila Toll protein. Toll initiates its signal through the adapter 
molecule Tube and the serine-threonine kinase Pelle. Pelle is highly homologous 
to members of the IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family in mammals. Recently, a 
novel Pelle-interacting protein called Pellino was identified in Drosophila. We 
now report a mammalian counterpart of Pellino, termed Pellino 1, which is 
required for NF kappa B activation and IL-8 gene expression in response to IL-1, 
probably through its signal-dependent interaction with IRAK4, IRAK, and the 
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). The Pellino 
1-IRAK-IRAK4-TRAF6 signaling complex is likely to be intermediate, located 
between the IL-1 receptor complex and the TAK1 complex in the IL-1 pathway.

INTRODUCTIONThe Toll immune pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway in both insects and mammals (1–3). When pathogens infect Drosophila, the receptor Toll binds to activated Spatzle (Spz), and three core components (MyD88, Tube, and Pelle) are recruited to form a receptor proximal oligomeric complex. This complex further triggers the degradation of Cactus and the phosphorylation of transcription factor Dorsal. Subsequently, the phosphorylated Dorsal translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus for regulating the expression of multiple antimicrobial peptides (4, 5). The Toll pathway has been reported to participate in various biological processes, including embryonic development and innate antiviral immunity (3, 6, 7). Besides, many host factors have been identified to be involved in this immune pathway, including the Pellino family (8–10).Pellino proteins are a type of highly conserved E3 ubiquitin ligases and have been implicated in the regulation of PRR signaling pathway, including the Toll immune pathway (11). The mammalian Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) pathways are homologous to the Drosophila Toll pathway (12, 13). Pellino can interact with and be phosphorylated by IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), the vertebrate homolog of Tube (14–16). The mammalian Pellino family consists of three members (Pellino-1, Pellino-2, and Pellino-3), and only one Pellino is found in the fly (8). In mammals, Pellino-2 positively regulates TLR/IL-1R pathway and Pellino-3 negatively regulates IL-1R signaling (17, 18). Pellino-1 can both positively and negatively regulate TLR/IL-1R-dependent NF-κB activation (15, 19). In addition, Drosophila Pellino positively regulates innate immunity by interacting with the activated Pelle protein (9). Pellino has also been reported to target MyD88 for ubiquitination and degradation, acting as a negative regulator in the Toll signaling pathway in Drosophila (10). However, the role of the Pellino family in the transmission of plant viruses by insect vectors remains largely unknown.Rice stripe virus (RSV) is a non-enveloped negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Tenuivirus and family Phenuiviridae, causing severe losses to rice production in Asian countries (20). The genome of RSV contains four RNA segments and encodes one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), one nucleocapsid protein (NP), and five nonstructural proteins (NS2, NSvc2, NS3, NS4, and NSvc4) (21, 22). RSV is transmitted by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus) in a persistent and propagative manner (23). When RSV enters the midgut lumen of L. striatellus through feeding on RSV-infected plants, RSV needs to overcome the midgut barrier and replicates in the epithelial cells. Subsequently, RSV spreads through the hemolymph system to the salivary glands and finally disseminates to healthy plants (24–27). In addition to replicating and proliferating in L. striatellus, RSV also invades the reproductive system and is vertically transmitted to the offspring (28–30). Recent studies have demonstrated that RSV infection activates several immune signaling pathways in L. striatellus, such as the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway (31), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (32), the prophenoloxidase (PPO) pathway (33), and the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway (34). Our previous studies showed that RSV infection also activates the Toll signaling pathway, which regulates downstream immune-related effectors to maintain persistent viral transmission (35, 36). Although Pellino has been reported to be involved in insect Toll antiviral immunity, it is still unknown whether Pellino affects the transmission of RSV by L. striatellus.In this study, we aim to clarify the role of the Pellino family in the transmission of RSV by the small brown planthopper. We found that there was only one member of the Pellino family in L. striatellus (LsPellino). LsPellino exerted antiviral function by interacting with LsTube and participating in the Toll immune pathway. Meanwhile, RSV NS3 hijacked an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (LsSOCS5), to promote the degradation of LsPellino through the 26S proteasome pathway and suppress Toll immune response. Our results suggest that attenuation of Toll immune defense through RSV-mediated degradation of LsPellino is essential for persistent viral infection in insect vectors.

INTRODUCTION

The Toll immune pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway in both insects and mammals (1–3). When pathogens infect Drosophila, the receptor Toll binds to activated Spatzle (Spz), and three core components (MyD88, Tube, and Pelle) are recruited to form a receptor proximal oligomeric complex. This complex further triggers the degradation of Cactus and the phosphorylation of transcription factor Dorsal. Subsequently, the phosphorylated Dorsal translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus for regulating the expression of multiple antimicrobial peptides (4, 5). The Toll pathway has been reported to participate in various biological processes, including embryonic development and innate antiviral immunity (3, 6, 7). Besides, many host factors have been identified to be involved in this immune pathway, including the Pellino family (8–10).

Pellino proteins are a type of highly conserved E3 ubiquitin ligases and have been implicated in the regulation of PRR signaling pathway, including the Toll immune pathway (11). The mammalian Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) pathways are homologous to the Drosophila Toll pathway (12, 13). Pellino can interact with and be phosphorylated by IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), the vertebrate homolog of Tube (14–16). The mammalian Pellino family consists of three members (Pellino-1, Pellino-2, and Pellino-3), and only one Pellino is found in the fly (8). In mammals, Pellino-2 positively regulates TLR/IL-1R pathway and Pellino-3 negatively regulates IL-1R signaling (17, 18). Pellino-1 can both positively and negatively regulate TLR/IL-1R-dependent NF-κB activation (15, 19). In addition, Drosophila Pellino positively regulates innate immunity by interacting with the activated Pelle protein (9). Pellino has also been reported to target MyD88 for ubiquitination and degradation, acting as a negative regulator in the Toll signaling pathway in Drosophila (10). However, the role of the Pellino family in the transmission of plant viruses by insect vectors remains largely unknown.

Rice stripe virus (RSV) is a non-enveloped negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Tenuivirus and family Phenuiviridae, causing severe losses to rice production in Asian countries (20). The genome of RSV contains four RNA segments and encodes one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), one nucleocapsid protein (NP), and five nonstructural proteins (NS2, NSvc2, NS3, NS4, and NSvc4) (21, 22). RSV is transmitted by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus) in a persistent and propagative manner (23). When RSV enters the midgut lumen of L. striatellus through feeding on RSV-infected plants, RSV needs to overcome the midgut barrier and replicates in the epithelial cells. Subsequently, RSV spreads through the hemolymph system to the salivary glands and finally disseminates to healthy plants (24–27). In addition to replicating and proliferating in L. striatellus, RSV also invades the reproductive system and is vertically transmitted to the offspring (28–30). Recent studies have demonstrated that RSV infection activates several immune signaling pathways in L. striatellus, such as the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway (31), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (32), the prophenoloxidase (PPO) pathway (33), and the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway (34). Our previous studies showed that RSV infection also activates the Toll signaling pathway, which regulates downstream immune-related effectors to maintain persistent viral transmission (35, 36). Although Pellino has been reported to be involved in insect Toll antiviral immunity, it is still unknown whether Pellino affects the transmission of RSV by L. striatellus.

In this study, we aim to clarify the role of the Pellino family in the transmission of RSV by the small brown planthopper. We found that there was only one member of the Pellino family in L. striatellus (LsPellino). LsPellino exerted antiviral function by interacting with LsTube and participating in the Toll immune pathway. Meanwhile, RSV NS3 hijacked an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (LsSOCS5), to promote the degradation of LsPellino through the 26S proteasome pathway and suppress Toll immune response. Our results suggest that attenuation of Toll immune defense through RSV-mediated degradation of LsPellino is essential for persistent viral infection in insect vectors.

RESULTSIdentification and characterization of LsPellinoThe LsPellino gene sequence was identified by comparing the genome of L. striatellus with Pellino genes from other insect species. The full sequence of LsPellino was confirmed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing. The open reading frame (ORF) of LsPellino included 1,329 bp and encoded a protein of 48.6 kDa with 442 amino acid (aa) residues. Conserved domain analysis showed that LsPellino contained two typical functional domains. The FHA (forkhead-associated) domain was predicted to extend from 33 to 300 aa, whereas the RING-like domain was predicted to extend from 305 to 426 aa (Fig. 1A). Moreover, amino acid alignment analysis indicated that Pellino sequence was relatively conserved among insect species, and LsPellino shared a 98.5% aa identity with Nilaparvata lugens Pellino (Fig. 1B). Phylogenetic analysis showed that LsPellino was closely related to the homologs of two other planthoppers (N. lugens and Sogatella furcifera) (Fig. 1C).Fig 1Structure feature and phylogenetic analysis of L. striatellus Pellino.

The results indicated that the transcription level of LsPellino was upregulated at 1 and 3 days, whereas it was significantly downregulated at 6 and 9 days after feeding on the RSV-infected plants (Fig. 2A). In addition, RT-qPCR and western blotting analyses showed that the expression of LsPellino at both the transcriptional and protein levels was decreased in the whole bodies of viruliferous planthoppers compared with nonviruliferous planthoppers (Fig. 2B and C). We then explored the expression pattern of LsPellino across different stages and in various organs of the nonviruliferous and viruliferous planthoppers. RT-qPCR revealed that LsPellino was expressed in all developmental stages, and the expression level in nonviruliferous planthoppers was higher than that in viruliferous planthoppers (Fig. 2D). Besides, LsPellino was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, and its expression level was obviously reduced in RSV-infected planthoppers compared with non-infected planthoppers (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, immunofluorescence labeling using the anti-LsPellino and anti-RSV NP antibodies showed that LsPellino was not localized with RSV virions, and the fluorescence intensity of LsPellino was significantly reduced in RSV-infected cells compared to uninfected cells in midgut and salivary glands (Fig. 2F and G). These results suggested that the expression of LsPellino is inhibited during RSV infection in small brown planthoppers.Fig 2Suppression of LsPellino expression during RSV infection in small brown planthoppers.

Viruliferous planthoppers were first treated with double-stranded LsPellino (dsLsPellino) or green fluorescent protein (dsGFP) for 48 h, resulting in a significant reduction in the relative transcript level of LsPellino (Fig. 3A). RT-qPCR and western blotting analyses indicated that the accumulation of RSV nucleocapsid protein (NP) at both RNA and protein levels was increased in the dsLsPellino-treated planthoppers compared with the dsGFP-treated controls (Fig. 3B and C). When nonviruliferous planthoppers were injected with a mixture of dsLsPellino and RSV crude extracts, the expression of LsPellino decreased, and the viral RNA level was significantly high compared with the controls (Fig. 3D and E).Fig 3LsPellino inhibits RSV replication and transmission in small brown planthoppers. (A) The relative transcript levels of LsPellino in dsGFP- or dsLsPellino-treated viruliferous planthoppers were analyzed using RT-qPCR. (B and C) The relative RNA (B) and protein levels (C) of RSV NP in dsGFP- or dsLsPellino-treated viruliferous planthoppers were measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting assays.

Immunofluorescence depicts fewer RSV-infected epithelial cells. **p<0.01, *p<0.001.Subsequently, we explored the effects of LsPellino knockdown on RSV replication and transmission in planthoppers. The results revealed that both the RSV acquisition ratio (55.2%) and transmission ratio (25.9%) in dsLsPellino-treated planthoppers were much higher than those in the dsGFP-treated controls (Fig. 3F). Immunofluorescence labeling assays showed that the number of RSV-infected midgut epithelial cells was greatly increased in dsLsPellino-treated planthoppers compared with the controls (Fig. 3G and H). Together, these results demonstrated that LsPellino inhibits RSV replication and transmission in small brown planthoppers.E3 ubiquitin ligase LsSOCS5 interacts with LsPellino and mediates the RSV-induced degradation of LsPellinoConsidering that the expression of LsPellino was reduced in viruliferous planthoppers (Fig. 2), we next investigated which protein was involved in the degradation of LsPellino. Using LsPellino as a bait protein, we screened 72 potential interacting proteins from a cDNA library of L. striatellus. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showed that an E3 ubiquitin ligase suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 5 in L. striatellus (LsSOCS5) was identified as an LsPellino-interacting protein. The interaction between LsPellino and LsSOCS5 was confirmed using an in vivo co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. The results indicated that the two proteins were mutually precipitated from the nonviruliferous planthoppers using either anti-LsPellino or anti-LsSOCS5 antibodies (Fig. 4A and B). Furthermore, one-to-one Y2H assay revealed that LsSOCS5 specifically interacted with the N-terminal fragment of LsPellino [LsPellino(N), 1–300 aa], but not with the C-terminal fragment of LsPellino [LsPellino(C), 301–442 aa] (Fig. 4C). Immunofluorescence assays further demonstrated that LsPellino and LsSOCS5 were colocalized in the salivary glands and midgut cells of L. striatellus (Fig. 4D). We also investigated whether other E3 ubiquitin ligases in L. striatellus specifically interacted with LsPellino. Seven E3 ubiquitin ligases were identified by aligning homologous sequences, and one-to-one Y2H assay showed that none of them could interact with LsPellino (Fig. S1). These results suggested that LsSOCS5 may be associated with the degradation of LsPellino.Fig 4E3 ubiquitin ligase LsSOCS5 interacts with LsPellino and mediates the RSV-induced degradation of LsPellino. (A and B) The interaction between LsPellino and LsSOCS5 was confirmed by Co-IP assay. Total protein from nonviruliferous insects was prepared and immunoprecipitated by Protein A-LsPellino (A) or Protein A-LsSOCS5 (B) combinations. The coimmunoprecipitated proteins were detected with LsSOCS5 and LsPellino antibodies. (C) Interaction of LsPellino and LsSOCS5 was confirmed by one-to-one Y2H assay. Yeast cells co-transformed with AD-T and BD-53 were used as a positive control. Yeast co-transformed with BD-LsPellino and AD-T7 served as a negative control. (D) Immunofluorescence labeling of LsPellino (green) and LsSOCS5 (red) in the salivary glands and midgut. LsPellino was detected using a FITC-conjugated anti-LsPellino antibody.

ACTB was used as a loading control.LsPellino interacts with LsSOCS5. Co-IP and yeast two-hybrid assays confirm interaction. Immunofluorescence depicts colocalization in salivary glands and midgut. Knockdown or proteasome inhibition affects LsPellino, LsSOCS5, and RSV NP levels.To better understand the role of LsSOCS5 in LsPellino degradation, viruliferous planthoppers were treated with dsLsSOCS5 or dsGFP for 48 h. Compared with the dsGFP controls, the expression level of LsPellino was significantly increased, whereas the viral NP level was markedly decreased in the dsLsSOCS5-treated group, as revealed by western blotting (Fig. 4E, lanes 3 vs. 4). Besides, no significant effect on the expression level of LsPellino was detected in the dsLsSOCS5-treated nonviruliferous planthopers compared with the controls (Fig. 4E, lanes 1 vs. 2). The 26S proteasome system is one of the primary pathways for protein degradation (37). To investigate whether the proteasome pathway participated in RSV-induced reduction of LsPellino, viruliferous planthopers were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 48 h using double-layer parafilm. Western blotting analysis showed that the accumulation level of LsPellino was higher and the accumulation level of RSV NP was lower in the MG132-treated viruliferous planthopers compared with the DMSO-treated controls (Fig. 4F, lanes 3 vs. 4). Meanwhile, MG132 treatment had no significant effect on the accumulation levels of LsPellino in nonviruliferous planthopers, suggesting that the 26S proteasome pathway may be involved in the RSV-induced degradation of LsPellino.RSV nonstructural protein NS3 promotes LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellinoGiven that RSV infection could induce the degradation of LsPellino, we next investigated whether viral proteins participated in LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino. One-to-one Y2H assay showed that both LsSOCS5 and LsPellino interacted with RSV nonstructural protein NS3 (RSV-NS3). Besides, RSV-NS3 specifically interacted with the LsPellino(N) but not with LsPellino(C) (Fig. 5A). The interactions among RSV-NS3, LsSOCS5, and LsPellino were further confirmed by pull-down and Co-IP assays. LsSOCS5 and LsPellino were pulled down from glutathione S-transferase (GST) beads incubated with recombinant GST-RSV-NS3 protein, but these bands were absent in GST beads incubated with GST protein (Fig. 5B). Additionally, LsSOCS5 and LsPellino were detected in anti-NS3 immunoprecipitates but not in controls (Fig. 5C). Similarly, a significantly higher amount of RSV-NS3 was precipitated from the viruliferous planthoppers using either anti-LsSOCS5 or anti-LsPellino antibodies (Fig. 5D and E). Immunofluorescence microscopy of RSV-infected salivary glands or midguts revealed that RSV-NS3 partially colocalized with LsSOCS5 or LsPellino (Fig. 5F, yellow arrows). Many fluorescent signals without colocalization were also observed (Fig. 5F, red and green arrows). Subsequently, competitive binding assays were performed to determine whether RSV-NS3 could affect the interaction between LsSOCS5 and LsPellino. The results indicated that RSV-NS3 did not compete with LsSOCS5 or LsPellino. Instead, RSV-NS3 could stabilize the interaction between LsSOCS5 and LsPellino (Fig. 5G and H), indicating that RSV-NS3 may play a positive regulatory role in accelerating the degradation of LsPellino. To test this hypothesis, viruliferous planthopers were treated with dsNS3 and dsGFP for 48 h. Western blotting analysis revealed that the expression level of LsPellino was significantly increased in the dsNS3-treated planthopper compared with the dsGFP-treated controls. Taken together, these results suggested that NS3, LsSOCS5, and LsPellino may form a complex during RSV infection, with NS3 promoting LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino.Fig 5RSV nonstructural protein NS3 promotes LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino.

(B) Interaction between RSV-NS3 and LsSOCS5 or LsPellino in GST pull-down assay.

When the amounts of RSV-NS3-His increased, the interaction between LsPellino and LsSOCS5 was not affected (G). GST-LsPellino and RSV-NS3-His were incubated with GST beads and then MBP-LsSOCS5 was added to the beads. When the amounts of MBP-LsSOCS5 increased, the interaction between LsPellino and RSV-NS3 was not affected (H).

Knockdown of NS3 affects LsPellino, LsSOCS5, and RSV NP levels.The degradation of LsPellino attenuates Toll pathway-mediated antiviral immune responseThe Pellino family has been reported to play a crucial regulatory role in Toll/TLR innate immune signaling in both insects and mammals (9, 38). To determine whether LsPellino protein participates in Toll immune signaling in L. striatellus, we used one-to-one Y2H and pull-down assays to verify the LsPellino-interacting proteins in the Toll immune pathway. The results showed that LsTube, a core component of Toll immune pathway, could specifically interact with LsPellino (C) and failed to interact with LsPellino (N) (Fig. 6A and B), suggesting that LsPellino most likely had a regulatory effect on Toll immune pathway. Our previous studies have demonstrated that RSV infection activates the Toll signaling, which regulates several downstream antiviral immune responses (including autophagy) to induce antiviral response (35, 36). To test whether LsPellino affects Toll pathway-mediated antiviral immunity, nonviruliferous planthoppers were treated with dsLsPellino for 48 h and then with RSV crude extracts for an additional 4 days. Compared with the control, the transcript levels of downstream immune-related genes (LsATG3, LsATG8, and LsATG12) were significantly lower in the dsLsPellino-treated groups (Fig. 6C). However, the expression levels of these immune-related genes were not markedly changed in nonviruliferous planthoppers treated with dsGFP or dsLsPellino (Fig. S2). Given that LsSOCS5 mediates the RSV-induced degradation of LsPellino, we further examined whether LsSOCS5 has an inhibitory effect on antiviral response. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of these immune genes was significantly increased after dsLsSOCS5 treatment compared with the dsGFP control (Fig. 6D). Consistently, when nonviruliferous planthoppers were treated with dsNS3 followed by treating with RSV crude extracts, the expression of these immune genes was also notably upregulated compared with the control (Fig. 6E). These results demonstrate that LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino attenuates Toll pathway-mediated antiviral immune response.Fig 6The degradation of LsPellino attenuates Toll pathway-mediated antiviral immune response.

The positive interactions were analyzed in 10-fold serial dilutions in synthetic dextrose (SD) quadruple dropout medium (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade) plates. Yeast cells co-transformed with AD-T and BD-53 were used as a positive control. Yeast co-transformed with AD-LsPellino and BD-T7 served as a negative control.

Knockdown of LsPellino, LsSOCS5, and RSV-NS3 affects LsATG3, LsATG8, and LsATG12 expressions.LsPellino participates in other rice virus infection in small brown planthoppersTo further investigate whether LsPellino affects the infection of other viruses, rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), which is also persistently transmitted by the small brown planthopper, was evaluated in this study. RT-qPCR and western blotting analyses showed that the expression of LsPellino at both the transcriptional and protein levels was significantly lower in the RBSDV-infected planthoppers compared with non-infected planthoppers (Fig. S3A and B). In addition, nonviruliferous planthoppers were treated with dsLsPellino for 48 h and then with RBSDV crude extracts for another 6 days. The accumulation level of RBSDV capsid protein (RB-P10) was markedly increased compared with the dsGFP-treated controls (Fig. S3C). We then investigated whether any other viral proteins could interact with LsPellino or LsSOCS5. Y2H and pull-down assays showed that a minor core capsid protein of RBSDV (RB-P8) could bind to LsPellino and LsSOCS5 (Fig. S3D through F). Thus, these data indicated that LsPellino participates in the infection of RBSDV in small brown planthoppers.

Identification and characterization of LsPellinoThe LsPellino gene sequence was identified by comparing the genome of L. striatellus with Pellino genes from other insect species. The full sequence of LsPellino was confirmed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing. The open reading frame (ORF) of LsPellino included 1,329 bp and encoded a protein of 48.6 kDa with 442 amino acid (aa) residues. Conserved domain analysis showed that LsPellino contained two typical functional domains. The FHA (forkhead-associated) domain was predicted to extend from 33 to 300 aa, whereas the RING-like domain was predicted to extend from 305 to 426 aa (Fig. 1A). Moreover, amino acid alignment analysis indicated that Pellino sequence was relatively conserved among insect species, and LsPellino shared a 98.5% aa identity with Nilaparvata lugens Pellino (Fig. 1B). Phylogenetic analysis showed that LsPellino was closely related to the homologs of two other planthoppers (N. lugens and Sogatella furcifera) (Fig. 1C).Fig 1Structure feature and phylogenetic analysis of L. striatellus Pellino.

Suppression of LsPellino expression during RSV infection in small brown planthoppersTo investigate whether the LsPellino was involved in RSV infection, we first examined the expression of LsPellino during RSV acquisition using RT-qPCR. The results indicated that the transcription level of LsPellino was upregulated at 1 and 3 days, whereas it was significantly downregulated at 6 and 9 days after feeding on the RSV-infected plants (Fig. 2A). In addition, RT-qPCR and western blotting analyses showed that the expression of LsPellino at both the transcriptional and protein levels was decreased in the whole bodies of viruliferous planthoppers compared with nonviruliferous planthoppers (Fig. 2B and C). We then explored the expression pattern of LsPellino across different stages and in various organs of the nonviruliferous and viruliferous planthoppers. RT-qPCR revealed that LsPellino was expressed in all developmental stages, and the expression level in nonviruliferous planthoppers was higher than that in viruliferous planthoppers (Fig. 2D). Besides, LsPellino was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, and its expression level was obviously reduced in RSV-infected planthoppers compared with non-infected planthoppers (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, immunofluorescence labeling using the anti-LsPellino and anti-RSV NP antibodies showed that LsPellino was not localized with RSV virions, and the fluorescence intensity of LsPellino was significantly reduced in RSV-infected cells compared to uninfected cells in midgut and salivary glands (Fig. 2F and G). These results suggested that the expression of LsPellino is inhibited during RSV infection in small brown planthoppers.Fig 2Suppression of LsPellino expression during RSV infection in small brown planthoppers.

LsPellino inhibits RSV replication and transmission in small brown planthoppersAfter confirming that LsPellino was inhibited during RSV infection, we then investigated the role of LsPellino in viral infection in planthoppers. Viruliferous planthoppers were first treated with double-stranded LsPellino (dsLsPellino) or green fluorescent protein (dsGFP) for 48 h, resulting in a significant reduction in the relative transcript level of LsPellino (Fig. 3A). RT-qPCR and western blotting analyses indicated that the accumulation of RSV nucleocapsid protein (NP) at both RNA and protein levels was increased in the dsLsPellino-treated planthoppers compared with the dsGFP-treated controls (Fig. 3B and C). When nonviruliferous planthoppers were injected with a mixture of dsLsPellino and RSV crude extracts, the expression of LsPellino decreased, and the viral RNA level was significantly high compared with the controls (Fig. 3D and E).Fig 3LsPellino inhibits RSV replication and transmission in small brown planthoppers.

Immunofluorescence depicts fewer RSV-infected epithelial cells. **p<0.01, *p<0.001.Subsequently, we explored the effects of LsPellino knockdown on RSV replication and transmission in planthoppers. The results revealed that both the RSV acquisition ratio (55.2%) and transmission ratio (25.9%) in dsLsPellino-treated planthoppers were much higher than those in the dsGFP-treated controls (Fig. 3F). Immunofluorescence labeling assays showed that the number of RSV-infected midgut epithelial cells was greatly increased in dsLsPellino-treated planthoppers compared with the controls (Fig. 3G and H). Together, these results demonstrated that LsPellino inhibits RSV replication and transmission in small brown planthoppers.

When nonviruliferous planthoppers were injected with a mixture of dsLsPellino and RSV crude extracts, the expression of LsPellino decreased, and the viral RNA level was significantly high compared with the controls (Fig. 3D and E).

The results revealed that both the RSV acquisition ratio (55.2%) and transmission ratio (25.9%) in dsLsPellino-treated planthoppers were much higher than those in the dsGFP-treated controls (Fig. 3F). Immunofluorescence labeling assays showed that the number of RSV-infected midgut epithelial cells was greatly increased in dsLsPellino-treated planthoppers compared with the controls (Fig. 3G and H). Together, these results demonstrated that LsPellino inhibits RSV replication and transmission in small brown planthoppers.

E3 ubiquitin ligase LsSOCS5 interacts with LsPellino and mediates the RSV-induced degradation of LsPellinoConsidering that the expression of LsPellino was reduced in viruliferous planthoppers (Fig. 2), we next investigated which protein was involved in the degradation of LsPellino. Using LsPellino as a bait protein, we screened 72 potential interacting proteins from a cDNA library of L. striatellus. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showed that an E3 ubiquitin ligase suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 5 in L. striatellus (LsSOCS5) was identified as an LsPellino-interacting protein. The interaction between LsPellino and LsSOCS5 was confirmed using an in vivo co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. The results indicated that the two proteins were mutually precipitated from the nonviruliferous planthoppers using either anti-LsPellino or anti-LsSOCS5 antibodies (Fig. 4A and B). Furthermore, one-to-one Y2H assay revealed that LsSOCS5 specifically interacted with the N-terminal fragment of LsPellino [LsPellino(N), 1–300 aa], but not with the C-terminal fragment of LsPellino [LsPellino(C), 301–442 aa] (Fig. 4C). Immunofluorescence assays further demonstrated that LsPellino and LsSOCS5 were colocalized in the salivary glands and midgut cells of L. striatellus (Fig. 4D). We also investigated whether other E3 ubiquitin ligases in L. striatellus specifically interacted with LsPellino. Seven E3 ubiquitin ligases were identified by aligning homologous sequences, and one-to-one Y2H assay showed that none of them could interact with LsPellino (Fig. S1). These results suggested that LsSOCS5 may be associated with the degradation of LsPellino.Fig 4E3 ubiquitin ligase LsSOCS5 interacts with LsPellino and mediates the RSV-induced degradation of LsPellino. (A and B) The interaction between LsPellino and LsSOCS5 was confirmed by Co-IP assay.

Knockdown or proteasome inhibition affects LsPellino, LsSOCS5, and RSV NP levels.To better understand the role of LsSOCS5 in LsPellino degradation, viruliferous planthoppers were treated with dsLsSOCS5 or dsGFP for 48 h. Compared with the dsGFP controls, the expression level of LsPellino was significantly increased, whereas the viral NP level was markedly decreased in the dsLsSOCS5-treated group, as revealed by western blotting (Fig. 4E, lanes 3 vs. 4). Besides, no significant effect on the expression level of LsPellino was detected in the dsLsSOCS5-treated nonviruliferous planthopers compared with the controls (Fig. 4E, lanes 1 vs. 2). The 26S proteasome system is one of the primary pathways for protein degradation (37). To investigate whether the proteasome pathway participated in RSV-induced reduction of LsPellino, viruliferous planthopers were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 48 h using double-layer parafilm. Western blotting analysis showed that the accumulation level of LsPellino was higher and the accumulation level of RSV NP was lower in the MG132-treated viruliferous planthopers compared with the DMSO-treated controls (Fig. 4F, lanes 3 vs. 4). Meanwhile, MG132 treatment had no significant effect on the accumulation levels of LsPellino in nonviruliferous planthopers, suggesting that the 26S proteasome pathway may be involved in the RSV-induced degradation of LsPellino.

To better understand the role of LsSOCS5 in LsPellino degradation, viruliferous planthoppers were treated with dsLsSOCS5 or dsGFP for 48 h. Compared with the dsGFP controls, the expression level of LsPellino was significantly increased, whereas the viral NP level was markedly decreased in the dsLsSOCS5-treated group, as revealed by western blotting (Fig. 4E, lanes 3 vs. 4).

RSV nonstructural protein NS3 promotes LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellinoGiven that RSV infection could induce the degradation of LsPellino, we next investigated whether viral proteins participated in LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino. One-to-one Y2H assay showed that both LsSOCS5 and LsPellino interacted with RSV nonstructural protein NS3 (RSV-NS3). Besides, RSV-NS3 specifically interacted with the LsPellino(N) but not with LsPellino(C) (Fig. 5A). The interactions among RSV-NS3, LsSOCS5, and LsPellino were further confirmed by pull-down and Co-IP assays. LsSOCS5 and LsPellino were pulled down from glutathione S-transferase (GST) beads incubated with recombinant GST-RSV-NS3 protein, but these bands were absent in GST beads incubated with GST protein (Fig. 5B). Additionally, LsSOCS5 and LsPellino were detected in anti-NS3 immunoprecipitates but not in controls (Fig. 5C). Similarly, a significantly higher amount of RSV-NS3 was precipitated from the viruliferous planthoppers using either anti-LsSOCS5 or anti-LsPellino antibodies (Fig. 5D and E). Immunofluorescence microscopy of RSV-infected salivary glands or midguts revealed that RSV-NS3 partially colocalized with LsSOCS5 or LsPellino (Fig. 5F, yellow arrows). Many fluorescent signals without colocalization were also observed (Fig. 5F, red and green arrows). Subsequently, competitive binding assays were performed to determine whether RSV-NS3 could affect the interaction between LsSOCS5 and LsPellino. The results indicated that RSV-NS3 did not compete with LsSOCS5 or LsPellino. Instead, RSV-NS3 could stabilize the interaction between LsSOCS5 and LsPellino (Fig. 5G and H), indicating that RSV-NS3 may play a positive regulatory role in accelerating the degradation of LsPellino. To test this hypothesis, viruliferous planthopers were treated with dsNS3 and dsGFP for 48 h. Western blotting analysis revealed that the expression level of LsPellino was significantly increased in the dsNS3-treated planthopper compared with the dsGFP-treated controls. Taken together, these results suggested that NS3, LsSOCS5, and LsPellino may form a complex during RSV infection, with NS3 promoting LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino.Fig 5RSV nonstructural protein NS3 promotes LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino.

RSV nonstructural protein NS3 promotes LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino

Given that RSV infection could induce the degradation of LsPellino, we next investigated whether viral proteins participated in LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino. One-to-one Y2H assay showed that both LsSOCS5 and LsPellino interacted with RSV nonstructural protein NS3 (RSV-NS3). Besides, RSV-NS3 specifically interacted with the LsPellino(N) but not with LsPellino(C) (Fig. 5A). The interactions among RSV-NS3, LsSOCS5, and LsPellino were further confirmed by pull-down and Co-IP assays. LsSOCS5 and LsPellino were pulled down from glutathione S-transferase (GST) beads incubated with recombinant GST-RSV-NS3 protein, but these bands were absent in GST beads incubated with GST protein (Fig. 5B). Additionally, LsSOCS5 and LsPellino were detected in anti-NS3 immunoprecipitates but not in controls (Fig. 5C). Similarly, a significantly higher amount of RSV-NS3 was precipitated from the viruliferous planthoppers using either anti-LsSOCS5 or anti-LsPellino antibodies (Fig. 5D and E). Immunofluorescence microscopy of RSV-infected salivary glands or midguts revealed that RSV-NS3 partially colocalized with LsSOCS5 or LsPellino (Fig. 5F, yellow arrows). Many fluorescent signals without colocalization were also observed (Fig. 5F, red and green arrows). Subsequently, competitive binding assays were performed to determine whether RSV-NS3 could affect the interaction between LsSOCS5 and LsPellino. The results indicated that RSV-NS3 did not compete with LsSOCS5 or LsPellino. Instead, RSV-NS3 could stabilize the interaction between LsSOCS5 and LsPellino (Fig. 5G and H), indicating that RSV-NS3 may play a positive regulatory role in accelerating the degradation of LsPellino. To test this hypothesis, viruliferous planthopers were treated with dsNS3 and dsGFP for 48 h. Western blotting analysis revealed that the expression level of LsPellino was significantly increased in the dsNS3-treated planthopper compared with the dsGFP-treated controls. Taken together, these results suggested that NS3, LsSOCS5, and LsPellino may form a complex during RSV infection, with NS3 promoting LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino.

The degradation of LsPellino attenuates Toll pathway-mediated antiviral immune responseThe Pellino family has been reported to play a crucial regulatory role in Toll/TLR innate immune signaling in both insects and mammals (9, 38). To determine whether LsPellino protein participates in Toll immune signaling in L. striatellus, we used one-to-one Y2H and pull-down assays to verify the LsPellino-interacting proteins in the Toll immune pathway. The results showed that LsTube, a core component of Toll immune pathway, could specifically interact with LsPellino (C) and failed to interact with LsPellino (N) (Fig. 6A and B), suggesting that LsPellino most likely had a regulatory effect on Toll immune pathway. Our previous studies have demonstrated that RSV infection activates the Toll signaling, which regulates several downstream antiviral immune responses (including autophagy) to induce antiviral response (35, 36). To test whether LsPellino affects Toll pathway-mediated antiviral immunity, nonviruliferous planthoppers were treated with dsLsPellino for 48 h and then with RSV crude extracts for an additional 4 days. Compared with the control, the transcript levels of downstream immune-related genes (LsATG3, LsATG8, and LsATG12) were significantly lower in the dsLsPellino-treated groups (Fig. 6C). However, the expression levels of these immune-related genes were not markedly changed in nonviruliferous planthoppers treated with dsGFP or dsLsPellino (Fig. S2). Given that LsSOCS5 mediates the RSV-induced degradation of LsPellino, we further examined whether LsSOCS5 has an inhibitory effect on antiviral response. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of these immune genes was significantly increased after dsLsSOCS5 treatment compared with the dsGFP control (Fig. 6D). Consistently, when nonviruliferous planthoppers were treated with dsNS3 followed by treating with RSV crude extracts, the expression of these immune genes was also notably upregulated compared with the control (Fig. 6E). These results demonstrate that LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino attenuates Toll pathway-mediated antiviral immune response.Fig 6The degradation of LsPellino attenuates Toll pathway-mediated antiviral immune response.

However, the expression levels of these immune-related genes were not markedly changed in nonviruliferous planthoppers treated with dsGFP or dsLsPellino (Fig. S2).

LsPellino participates in other rice virus infection in small brown planthoppersTo further investigate whether LsPellino affects the infection of other viruses, rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), which is also persistently transmitted by the small brown planthopper, was evaluated in this study. RT-qPCR and western blotting analyses showed that the expression of LsPellino at both the transcriptional and protein levels was significantly lower in the RBSDV-infected planthoppers compared with non-infected planthoppers (Fig. S3A and B). In addition, nonviruliferous planthoppers were treated with dsLsPellino for 48 h and then with RBSDV crude extracts for another 6 days. The accumulation level of RBSDV capsid protein (RB-P10) was markedly increased compared with the dsGFP-treated controls (Fig. S3C). We then investigated whether any other viral proteins could interact with LsPellino or LsSOCS5. Y2H and pull-down assays showed that a minor core capsid protein of RBSDV (RB-P8) could bind to LsPellino and LsSOCS5 (Fig. S3D through F). Thus, these data indicated that LsPellino participates in the infection of RBSDV in small brown planthoppers.

DISCUSSIONDuring the long-term evolutionary process, plant viruses have developed various counter-defense strategies to suppress the innate immune system of insect vectors and maintain persistent infection and transmission (39–43). Our previous results indicated that RSV-NP binds to the cell surface receptor LsToll and activates the Toll signaling pathway, which subsequently activates the downstream transcription factor LsDorsal and regulates the antiviral immune response. In contrast, RSV utilizes its NS4 protein to inhibit LsDorsal phosphorylation by competitively binding to LsMSK2 kinase, thereby counteracting Toll antiviral immunity (35, 36). In this study, we identified a novel anti-defense strategy to antagonize Toll antiviral defense (Fig. 7). LsPellino participates in the Toll immune pathway by interacting with LsTube and activates a downstream immune response to inhibit viral infection. Meanwhile, RSV-NS3 hijacks LsSOCS5 to promote the degradation of LsPellino through the 26S proteasome pathway, finally attenuating the Toll antiviral pathway to facilitate RSV infection in insect vectors (Fig. 7).Fig 7The schematic diagram indicating viral protein attenuating the Toll antiviral pathway via promoting degradation of LsPellino. RSV infection activates the Toll pathway by the interaction of RSV-NP and Toll receptor (LsToll) (35, 36). Subsequently, LsPellino participates in the Toll antiviral pathway by interacting with LsTube and induces the downstream immune response (such as autophagy). Meanwhile, RSV-NS3 hijacks LsSOCS5 to mediate the degradation of LsPellino through the 26S proteasome pathway, finally attenuating the Toll antiviral pathway to facilitate RSV infection in insect vectors.RSV-NS3 of LsPellino degradation via 26S proteasome, reducing Toll signaling and facilitating viral infection. LsPellino interacts with LsTube, whereas LsSOCS5 may regulate its stability. LsDorsal phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are suppressed.The Pellino family is regarded as scaffold proteins in the signal transduction process due to their interactions with multiple intermediates (44–46). In Drosophila, Pellino enhances innate immunity by interacting with Pelle and acts as a negative regulator of the Toll signaling pathway by targeting MyD88 for ubiquitination and degradation. Our study reveals that LsPellino cannot bind to LsMyD88 but interacts with LsTube (Fig. 6A). Although the degradation of LsPellino occurs via the proteasome pathway, we cannot rule out the possibility that other degradation pathways are involved in LsPellino degradation, such as the autophagy pathway. Moreover, our results showed that the downstream immune-related genes are downregulated after knockdown of LsPellino expression. Whether the interaction between LsPellino and LsTube affects the degradation of LsCactus and the phosphorylation of LsDorsal still needs to be further elucidated. Besides, the Pellino family can be phosphorylated by multiple intermediates after interaction, thereby activating Pellino proteins and regulating downstream signaling (11, 38, 47). For example, Pellino recognizes phosphorylated IRAKs (IL-1R-associated kinases) through its N-terminal FHA domain, and Pellino is phosphorylated by IRAKs, which enhances the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Pellino (14, 48, 49). A mutation in the Pellino C-terminal RING-like domain results in the loss of E3 ligase activity (48). Furthermore, kinase-active IRAKs promote polyubiquitination and degradation of the Pellino family, whereas loss of kinase-active IRAKs increases the expression level of Pellino (50–52). Our results indicated that the RING domain of LsPellino, but not the N-terminal FHA domain, can bind to LsTube. Whether LsTube can catalyze the phosphorylation of LsPellino and subsequently lead to LsTube-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation of LsPellino remains to be further explored.Recent studies have reported that many viruses affect the function of Pellino to evade host antiviral immunity in both insects and mammals. In Drosophila, the poxvirus homolog of the Pellino binds to IRAKs and suppresses Toll- and TLR-mediated activation of downstream transcription factors (53). In the mammalian system, the microRNA-155 is upregulated and targets mRNA to inhibit the expression of Pellino during the Japanese encephalitis virus infection (54). In our study, we showed that the nonstructural protein NS3 of RSV directly interacts with the LsPellino N-terminal FHA domain and promotes LsSOCS5-mediated degradation of LsPellino (Fig. 5). It will be interesting in future studies to determine the specific amino acid sequences or domains of RSV-NS3 that bind to LsSOCS5 and LsPellino. Besides, we also revealed that the expression level of LsPellino is reduced following RBSDV infection, and the RBSDV P8 protein also binds to both LsPellino and LsSOCS5 (Fig. 7). Targeting Pellino to attenuate the Toll antiviral pathway may represent a universal mechanism for ensuring the persistent transmission of other viruses by their insect vectors.Our previous studies have demonstrated that RSV and RBSDV infection can activate the JAK-STAT pathway, promote the accumulation of LsSOCS5 regulated by the transcription factor STAT5B, and facilitate persistent viral infection in insect vectors (34). Our results showed that RSV-NS3 hijacks LsSOCS5 to promote the degradation of LsPellino, thereby attenuating the Toll antiviral pathway. These two pathways appear to be antagonistic to one another. An intriguing study will focus on how viruses manipulate these two pathways to achieve homeostasis during persistent viral infection. For different methods of virus inoculation (e.g., feeding vs. injection) may result in differences in virus infectivity and vector fitness. For example, injection can increase not only virus infectivity but also insect mortality, whereas feeding reduces virus infectivity but has no significant effect on vector fitness. Moreover, immunofluorescence microscopy of RSV-infected salivary glands or midguts revealed that RSV does not infect all host cells but accumulates only in localized cells (Fig. 2). Other immune pathways, such as siRNAi, PPO, and JNK, have also been reported to participate in viral infection in planthoppers (31–33). Whether interactions exist among these immune regulatory networks to limit excessive viral accumulation warrants further investigation.In summary, we revealed that LsPellino is involved in the Toll immune pathway by interacting with LsTube and activates a downstream immune response to inhibit viral infection. Meanwhile, RSV-NS3 hijacks LsSOCS5 to promote the degradation of LsPellino via the 26S proteasome pathway, ultimately attenuating the Toll antiviral pathway to facilitate RSV infection in insect vectors. Our findings uncover a novel counter-defense strategy that may expand the understanding of the arms race between viruses and insect vectors during coevolution.

MATERIALS AND METHODSInsects and rice virusesThe population of small brown planthopper was reared on rice seedlings of rice at 26 ± 1°C with a photoperiod of 14 h light and 10 h dark. The RSV-infected and RBSDV-infected rice plants originated from Jiangsu Province, China. The RSV-infected or RBSDV-infected planthoppers were obtained by feeding on virus-infected plants or injecting virus crude extracts. To ensure that the proportion of RSV-carrying (viruliferous) planthoppers exceeds 90%, the viruliferous population was regularly screened (every 3 months) using RNA extraction from individual insects and PCR detection according to the previous description (55).Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisTotal RNA was extracted from the whole bodies of insects or from seven tissues (salivary gland, midgut, epidermis, hemolymph, fat body, ovary, and testis) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The concentration and quality of total RNA were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). One microgram of RNA from whole bodies or from each tissue was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR (+gDNA wiper) (Vazyme, China).Gene cloning and sequence analysisLsPellino and other genes were amplified from the cDNA template based on the genomic information for the L. striatellus (56). Two sequences of RSV (NP and NS3) and two sequences of RBSDV (P8 and P10) were amplified from the cDNA of insects infected with these two viruses. The functional domain of LsPellino was predicted using the Conserved Domain Database server (57). The amino acid sequence alignment of Pellino from L. striatellus and other insect species was conducted with the BioEdit 7.2 program. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using a Machine Learning Algorithm via the RAxML-NG program with 1,000 bootstrap replicates (58).Real-time quantitative PCR analysisReal-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to evaluate the relative RNA levels of viral or insect genes. A 10 µL reaction mixture, consisting of 5 µL of Hieff qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (11202ES08, Yeasen, China), 4 µL of 20-fold diluted cDNA template, and 0.5 µL of each primer (10 µM), was conducted on a LightCycler Real-Time PCR System (Roche Swiss). The primers utilized for the RT-qPCR are listed in Table S1. The transcript level of the Actin gene served as an internal reference to quantify the expression of each gene in L. striatellus. Each experiment was performed with three biological replicates, with each biological replicate containing two technical replicates.Injection of virus crude extractsThe virus crude extracts were prepared as described previously (34). Briefly, a total of 10 RSV-infected insect samples were collected and homogenized in 100 µL of 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) in a 1.5 mL tube. After centrifugation at 4°C and 8,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to another EP tube and centrifuged three additional times. The supernatant sample from the final centrifugation was regarded as the virus crude extracts. A volume of 25 nl of virus crude extracts was injected into each nonviruliferous third-instar planthoppers using a TransferMan 4 r micromanipulator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Each replicate included 50 nonviruliferous insects, and three replicates were conducted for each experiment.Double-stranded RNA synthesis and deliveryThe double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeting LsPellino, LsSOCS5, NS3, and green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) were synthesized using the T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (10623ES60, Yeasen, China) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The purity and integrity of these dsRNAs were evaluated using agarose gel electrophoresis. A volume of 20 nl of dsRNA was injected into the insect’s ventral thorax through a glass needle with a TransferMan 4 r micromanipulator. Viral loads at the RNA level and transcription levels of insect genes were quantified using RT-qPCR. The protein levels of RSV NP, NS3, RBSDV P10, LsPellino, and LsSOCS5 were determined by western blotting with specific antibodies.Western blotting assayProtein samples were extracted from 20 planthoppers in 200 µL of 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) and boiled with a loading buffer at 95°C for 10 min. After being separated in 10% (wt/vol) SDS-PAGE gels, the samples were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The blots were incubated with specific primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5,000 (vol/vol), followed by the application of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:10,000 (vol/vol). The membranes were treated with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate (34577, Thermo Scientific, USA) and visualized using a CCD camera system Amersham Imager 680 (GE, Sweden).Specific primary antibodies against LsPellino, RSV NP, NS3, or RBSDV P10 were produced in the laboratory. The anti-SOCS polyclonal antibody (HA500307) and anti-beta Actin monoclonal antibody (EM21002) were acquired from Huabio (Hangzhou, China) and used to quantify LsSOCS5 and ACTB (beta-actin), respectively. MBP-tag monoclonal antibody (MA5-27544), GST-tag monoclonal antibody (MA4-004), and His-tag monoclonal antibody (MA1-21315) were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and used in competitive binding assay.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayThe rates of RSV acquisition and transmission were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The collected planthoppers or rice plants were ground individually in PBS buffer. Then, the samples were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants from each sample were blotted on the nitrocellulose membranes. After drying at room temperature for 10 min, the membranes were incubated with an RSV NP antibody at a dilution of 1:5,000 (vol/vol), followed by the application of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000 (vol/vol). The membranes were treated with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate and visualized using a CCD camera system Amersham Imager 680 (GE, Sweden).Competitive binding assayThe full-length ORF of LsPellino was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector and recombinantly expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-LsPellino). LsSOCS5 was cloned into the pMAL-c5x vector to express the recombinant protein with the MBP tag (MBP-LsSOCS5). The RSV NS3 gene was cloned into the pET-28a vector for expression of a His-tagged recombinant protein (RSV-NS3-His). Recombinant proteins GST-LsPellino, MBP-LsSOCS5, or RSV-NS3-His were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified in vitro, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Insects and rice virusesThe population of small brown planthopper was reared on rice seedlings of rice at 26 ± 1°C with a photoperiod of 14 h light and 10 h dark. The RSV-infected and RBSDV-infected rice plants originated from Jiangsu Province, China. The RSV-infected or RBSDV-infected planthoppers were obtained by feeding on virus-infected plants or injecting virus crude extracts. To ensure that the proportion of RSV-carrying (viruliferous) planthoppers exceeds 90%, the viruliferous population was regularly screened (every 3 months) using RNA extraction from individual insects and PCR detection according to the previous description (55).
