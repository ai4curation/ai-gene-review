In Escherichia coli, YaeT, together with four lipoproteins, YfgL, YfiO, NlpB, 
and SmpA, forms a complex that is essential for beta-barrel outer membrane 
protein biogenesis. Data suggest that YfgL and YfiO make direct but independent 
physical contacts with YaeT. Whereas the YaeT-YfiO interaction needs NlpB and 
SmpA for complex stabilization, the YaeT-YfgL interaction does not. Using 
bioinformatics, genetics, and biochemical approaches, we have identified three 
residues, L173, L175, and R176, in the mature YfgL protein that are critical for 
both function and interactions with YaeT. A single substitution at any of these 
sites produces no phenotypic defect, but two or three simultaneous alterations 
produce mild or yfgL-null phenotypes, respectively. Interestingly, biochemical 
data show that all YfgL variants, including those with single substitutions, 
have weakened in vivo YaeT-YfgL interaction. These defects are not due to 
mislocalization or low steady-state levels of YfgL. Cysteine-directed 
cross-linking data show that the region encompassing L173, L175, and R176 makes 
direct contact with YaeT. Using the same genetic and biochemical strategies, it 
was found that altering residues D227 and D229 in another region of YfgL from 
E221 to D229 resulted in defective YaeT bindings. In contrast, mutational 
analysis of conserved residues V319 to H328 of YfgL shows that they are 
important for YfgL biogenesis but not YfgL-YaeT interactions. The five YfgL 
mutants defective in YaeT associations and the yfgL background were used to show 
that SurA binds to YaeT (or another complex member) without going through YfgL.
