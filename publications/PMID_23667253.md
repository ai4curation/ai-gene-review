In yeast, aberrant mRNAs lacking in-frame termination codons are recognized and 
degraded by the non-stop decay (NSD) pathway. The recognition of non-stop mRNAs 
involves a member of the eRF3 family of GTP-binding proteins, Ski7. Ski7 is 
thought to bind the ribosome stalled at the 3'-end of the mRNA poly(A) tail and 
recruit the exosome to degrade the aberrant message. However, Ski7 is not found 
in mammalian cells, and even the presence of the NSD mechanism itself has 
remained enigmatic. Here, we show that unstable non-stop mRNA is degraded in a 
translation-dependent manner in mammalian cells. The decay requires another eRF3 
family member (Hbs1), its binding partner Dom34, and components of the 
exosome-Ski complex (Ski2/Mtr4 and Dis3). Hbs1-Dom34 binds to form a complex 
with the exosome-Ski complex. Also, the elimination of aberrant proteins 
produced from non-stop transcripts requires the RING finger protein listerin. 
These findings demonstrate that the NSD mechanism exists in mammalian cells and 
involves Hbs1, Dom34, and the exosome-Ski complex.
