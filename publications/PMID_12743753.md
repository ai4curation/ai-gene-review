Corynebacterium glutamicum has played a principal role in the progress of the 
amino acid fermentation industry. The complete genome sequence of the 
representative wild-type strain of C. glutamicum, ATCC 13032, has been 
determined and analyzed to improve our understanding of the molecular biology 
and physiology of this organism, and to advance the development of more 
efficient production strains. Genome annotation has helped in elucidation of the 
gene repertoire defining a desired pathway, which is accelerating pathway 
engineering. Post genome technologies such as DNA arrays and proteomics are 
currently undergoing rapid development in C. glutamicum. Such progress has 
already exposed new regulatory networks and functions that had so far been 
unidentified in this microbe. The next goal of these studies is to integrate the 
fruits of genomics into strain development technology. A novel methodology that 
merges genomics with classical strain improvement has been developed and applied 
for the reconstruction of classically derived production strains. How can 
traditional fermentation benefit from the C. glutamicum genomic data? The path 
from genomics to biotechnological processes is presented.
