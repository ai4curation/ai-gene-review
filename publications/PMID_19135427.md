Accumulation of unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen 
induces ER stress. Eukaryotic cells possess the ER quality control systems, the 
unfolded protein response (UPR), to adapt to ER stress. IRE1alpha is one of the 
ER stress receptors and mediates the UPR. Here, we identified ubiquitin specific 
protease (USP) 14 as a binding partner of IRE1alpha. USP14 interacted with the 
cytoplasmic region of IRE1alpha, and the endogenous interaction between USP14 
and IRE1alpha was inhibited by ER stress. Overexpression of USP14 inhibited the 
ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and USP14 depletion by small 
interfering RNA effectively activated ERAD. These findings suggest that USP14 is 
a novel player in the UPR by serving as a physiological inhibitor of ERAD under 
the non-stressed condition.
