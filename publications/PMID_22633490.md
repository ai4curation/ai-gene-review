Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) functions not only as a bioactive lipid molecule, 
but also as an important intermediate of the sole sphingolipid-to-glycerolipid 
metabolic pathway. However, the precise reactions and the enzymes involved in 
this pathway remain unresolved. We report here that yeast HFD1 and 
the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS)-causative mammalian gene ALDH3A2 are 
responsible for conversion of the S1P degradation product hexadecenal to 
hexadecenoic acid. The absence of ALDH3A2 in CHO-K1 mutant cells caused abnormal 
metabolism of S1P/hexadecenal to ether-linked glycerolipids. Moreover, we 
demonstrate that yeast Faa1 and Faa4 and mammalian ACSL family members are 
acyl-CoA synthetases involved in the sphingolipid-to-glycerolipid metabolic 
pathway and that hexadecenoic acid accumulates in Δfaa1 Δfaa4 mutant 
cells. These results unveil the entire S1P metabolic pathway: S1P is metabolized 
to glycerolipids via hexadecenal, hexadecenoic acid, hexadecenoyl-CoA, and 
palmitoyl-CoA. From our results we propose a possibility that accumulation of 
the S1P metabolite hexadecenal contributes to the pathogenesis of SLS.
