BACKGROUND: Pharmacological and genetic studies indicate that the (Na+)-H+ 
exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) plays a critical role in myocardial ischemia and 
reperfusion (I/R) injury. We found that p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) 
phosphorylated serine 703 of NHE1, stimulating 14-3-3 binding and NHE1 activity. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibiting RSK in cardiomyocytes would prevent 
NHE1 activation and decrease I/R-mediated injury.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To examine the role of RSK in vivo, we generated transgenic 
mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of dominant negative RSK (DN-RSK-TG). 
DN-RSK-TG hearts demonstrated normal basal cardiac function and morphology. 
However, myocardial infarction (left coronary artery occlusion for 45 minutes) 
in DN-RSK-TG hearts was significantly reduced at 24 hours of reperfusion from 
46.9+/-5.6% area at risk in nontransgenic littermate controls to 26.0+/-4.2% in 
DN-RSK-TG (P<0.01). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was significantly reduced after I/R 
in DN-RSK (0.9+/-0.2%) compared with nontransgenic littermate controls 
(6.2+/-2.6%). Importantly, activation of RSK and interaction of 14-3-3 with 
NHE1, necessary for agonist-stimulated NHE1 activity, were increased by I/R and 
inhibited by 70% in DN-RSK-TG (P<0.01). Next, we transduced rat neonatal 
cardiomyocytes with adenovirus-expressing DN-RSK (Ad.DN-RSK) and measured NHE1 
activity. The baseline rate of pH recovery in acid-loaded cells was equal in 
cells expressing LacZ or DN-RSK. However, NHE1 activation by 100 micromol/L H2O2 
was significantly inhibited in cells expressing DN-RSK (0.16+/-0.02 pH 
units/min) compared with Ad.LacZ (0.49+/-0.13 pH units/min). Apoptosis induced 
by 12 hours of anoxia followed by 24 hours' reoxygenation was significantly 
reduced in cells expressing Ad.DN-RSK (18.6+/-2.0%) compared with Ad.LacZ 
(29.3+/-5.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, RSK is a novel regulator of cardiac NHE1 activity by 
phosphorylating NHE1 serine 703 and a new pathological mediator of I/R injury in 
the heart.
