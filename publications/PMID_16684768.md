Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a pivotal role in inflammation, 
immunity, stress responses, and protection from apoptosis. Canonical activation 
of NF-kappaB is dependent on the phosphorylation of the inhibitory subunit 
IkappaBalpha that is mediated by a multimeric, high molecular weight complex, 
called IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. This is composed of two catalytic subunits, 
IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and a regulatory subunit, NEMO/IKKgamma. The latter 
protein is essential for the activation of IKKs and NF-kappaB, but its mechanism 
of action is not well understood. Here we identified ABIN-1 (A20 binding 
inhibitor of NF-kappaB) as a NEMO/IKKgamma-interacting protein. ABIN-1 has been 
previously identified as an A20-binding protein and it has been proposed to 
mediate the NF-kappaB inhibiting effects of A20. We find that both ABIN-1 and 
A20 inhibit NF-kappaB at the level of the IKK complex and that A20 inhibits 
activation of NF-kappaB by de-ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKgamma. Importantly, 
small interfering RNA targeting ABIN-1 abrogates A20-dependent de-ubiquitination 
of NEMO/IKKgamma and RNA interference of A20 impairs the ability of ABIN-1 to 
inhibit NF-kappaB activation. Altogether our data indicate that ABIN-1 
physically links A20 to NEMO/IKKgamma and facilitates A20-mediated 
de-ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKgamma, thus resulting in inhibition of NF-kappaB.
