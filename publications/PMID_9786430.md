In an attempt to identify autoantigens of synovium in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
we constructed lambda phage expression cDNA libraries from synovium and screened 
them by IgG purified from synovial fluids, both of which were derived from RA 
patients. As a result of this unique combination of the libraries and probes, we 
cloned follistatin-related protein (FRP) as a novel autoantigen in systemic 
rheumatic diseases. FRP is a secreted protein containing a similar amino acid 
sequence to follistatin, an inhibitor of activin. FRP was first cloned as a 
transforming growth factor-beta1-inducible protein (called TSC-36) from a mouse 
osteoblastic cell line and was suggested to have some roles in the negative 
regulation of cellular growth. Immunoblotting analyses detected synovial fluid 
and serum anti-FRP antibodies of IgG class more frequently in RA than any other 
systemic rheumatic diseases and controls. Synovial fluid anti-FRP antibodies 
appeared in 44% of RA (n = 18) and none of osteoarthritis (OA) (n = 15) 
patients. Serum antibodies were detected in 30% of RA (n = 67), 17% of systemic 
sclerosis (n = 18), 10% of systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 51) and Sjögren's 
syndrome (n = 10), and none of polymyositis/dermatomyositis (n = 13) patients 
and healthy subjects (n = 30). These antibodies recognized an EC domain, an 
extracellular Ca2+ binding module. In anti-FRP antibody-positive RA patients, 
serum C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were more 
elevated than negative patients (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). FRP gene 
expression was higher in RA than OA synovium (P < 0.05). However, there was no 
difference between these groups in the amount of synovial FRP, suggesting its 
elevated turnover in RA. As follistatin inhibits activin, FRP might inhibit some 
growth factor-like molecule. Detection of anti-FRP antibodies, possibly having 
disease-promoting effects as the blocking antibodies, could be one of the 
markers for clinical evaluation of systemic rheumatic diseases.
