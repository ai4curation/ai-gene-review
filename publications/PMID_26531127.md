AIMS: Arterial hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. 
The kidney and its natriuretic function are in the centre of the prevailing 
models to explain the pathogenesis of hypertension; however, the mechanisms 
underlying blood pressure elevation remain unclear in most patients. Development 
of hypertension is strongly correlated with age, and this blood pressure 
increase typically accelerates in the fourth decade of life. The cause of 
age-dependent blood pressure elevation is poorly understood. This study aims to 
understand the role of procontractile G-protein-mediated signalling pathways in 
vascular smooth muscle in age-dependent hypertension.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Similar to humans at mid-life, we observed in 1-year-old 
mice elevated blood pressure levels without any evidence for increased vessel 
stiffness, impaired renal function, or endocrine abnormalities. Hypertensive 
aged mice showed signs of endothelial dysfunction and had an increased vascular 
formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevated endothelial ET-1 
expression. Age-dependent hypertension could be normalized by ETA receptor 
blockade, smooth muscle-specific inactivation of the gene encoding the ETA 
receptor, as well as by acute disruption of downstream signalling via induction 
of smooth muscle-specific Gα12/Gα13, Gαq/Gα11, or LARG deficiency using 
tamoxifen-inducible smooth muscle-specific conditional mouse knock-out models. 
Induction of smooth muscle-specific ETA receptor deficiency normalized the blood 
pressure in aged mice despite the continuous presence of signs of endothelial 
dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: Age-dependent blood pressure elevation is due to a highly reversible 
activation of procontractile signalling in vascular smooth muscle cells 
indicating that increased vascular tone can be a primary factor in the 
development of hypertension.
