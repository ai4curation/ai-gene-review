The Schizosaccharomyces pombe shu1+ gene encodes a cell-surface protein required 
for assimilation of exogenous heme. In this study, shaving experiments showed 
that Shu1 is released from membrane preparations when spheroplast lysates are 
incubated with phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Shu1 
cleavability by PI-PLC and its predicted hydropathy profile strongly suggested 
that Shu1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. When heme 
biosynthesis is selectively blocked in hem1Δ mutant cells, the heme analog zinc 
mesoporphyrin IX (ZnMP) first accumulates into vacuoles and then subsequently, 
within the cytoplasm in a rapid and Shu1-dependent manner. An HA4-tagged shu1+ 
allele that retained wild-type function localizes to the cell surface in 
response to low hemin concentrations, but under high hemin concentrations, 
Shu1-HA4 re-localizes to the vacuolar membrane. Inactivation of abc3+, encoding 
a vacuolar membrane transporter, results in hem1Δ abc3Δ mutant cells being 
unable to grow in the presence of hemin as the sole iron source. In hem1Δ abc3Δ 
cells, ZnMP accumulates primarily in vacuoles and does not sequentially 
accumulate in the cytosol. Consistent with a role for Abc3 as vacuolar hemin 
exporter, results with hemin-agarose pulldown assays showed that Abc3 binds to 
hemin. In contrast, an Abc3 mutant in which an inverted Cys-Pro motif had been 
replaced with Ala residues fails to bind hemin with high affinity. Taken 
together, these results show that Shu1 undergoes rapid hemin-induced 
internalization from the cell surface to the vacuolar membrane and that the 
transporter Abc3 participates in the mobilization of stored heme from the 
vacuole to the cytosol.

The Schizosaccharomyces pombe shu1+ gene encodes a cell-surface protein required for assimilation of exogenous heme. In this study, shaving experiments showed that Shu1 is released from membrane preparations when spheroplast lysates are incubated with phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Shu1 cleavability by PI-PLC and its predicted hydropathy profile strongly suggested that Shu1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. When heme biosynthesis is selectively blocked in hem1Δ mutant cells, the heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin IX (ZnMP) first accumulates into vacuoles and then subsequently, within the cytoplasm in a rapid and Shu1-dependent manner. An HA4-tagged shu1+ allele that retained wild-type function localizes to the cell surface in response to low hemin concentrations, but under high hemin concentrations, Shu1-HA4 re-localizes to the vacuolar membrane. Inactivation of abc3+, encoding a vacuolar membrane transporter, results in hem1Δ abc3Δ mutant cells being unable to grow in the presence of hemin as the sole iron source. In hem1Δ abc3Δ cells, ZnMP accumulates primarily in vacuoles and does not sequentially accumulate in the cytosol. Consistent with a role for Abc3 as vacuolar hemin exporter, results with hemin-agarose pulldown assays showed that Abc3 binds to hemin.
