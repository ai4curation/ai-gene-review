Complex formation of platelet thrombospondin with plasminogen. Modulation of 
activation by tissue activator.

Silverstein RL, Leung LL, Harpel PC, Nachman RL.

Thrombospondin (TSP), a multifunctional alpha-granule glycoprotein of platelets, 
binds fibrinogen, fibronectin, heparin, and histidine-rich glycoprotein and thus 
may play an important role in regulating thrombotic influences at vessel 
surfaces. In this study we have demonstrated that purified human platelet TSP 
formed a complex with purified human plasminogen (Plg). Complex formation was 
detected by rocket immunoelectrophoresis of mixtures of the purified 
radiolabeled proteins. Significant complex formation of fluid-phase Plg with 
adsorbed TSP was also demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
The complex formation was specific, saturable, and inhibited by excess 
fluid-phase TSP, with an apparent KD of approximately 35 nM. In both ELISA and 
rocket immunoelectrophoresis systems, complex formation was inhibited by 10 mM 
epsilon-amino-n-caproic acid, implying that there is a role for the lysine 
binding sites of Plg in mediating the interaction. TSP also formed a complex 
with plasmin as detected by ELISA but did not directly inhibit plasmin activity 
measured with a synthetic fluorometric substrate or with a 125I-fibrin plate 
assay. TSP, when incubated with Plg before addition to 125I-fibrin plates 
significantly inhibited the generation of plasmin activity by tissue plasminogen 
activator (TPA) in a manner that was calcium dependent. A kinetic study of Plg 
activation by TPA in the presence of TSP demonstrated that Michaelis-Menten 
kinetics were followed and that TSP acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor. These 
studies support the hypothesis that TSP, acting as a multifunctional regulator 
in focal areas of active hemostasis, could serve as a prothrombotic influence, 
leading to increased deposition of fibrin.
