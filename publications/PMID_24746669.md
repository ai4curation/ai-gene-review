A substantial amount of mitochondrial energy is required for cell-cycle 
progression. The mechanisms underlying the coordination of the mitochondrial 
respiration with cell-cycle progression, especially the G2/M transition, remain 
to be elucidated. Here, we show that a fraction of cyclin B1/Cdk1 proteins 
localizes to the matrix of mitochondria and phosphorylates a cluster of 
mitochondrial proteins, including the complex I (CI) subunits in the respiratory 
chain. Cyclin B1/Cdk1-mediated CI phosphorylation enhances CI activity, whereas 
deficiency of such phosphorylation in each of the relevant CI subunits results 
in impairment of CI function. Mitochondria-targeted cyclin B1/Cdk1 increases 
mitochondrial respiration with enhanced oxygen consumption and ATP generation, 
which provides cells with efficient bioenergy for G2/M transition and shortens 
overall cell-cycle time. Thus, cyclin B1/Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of 
mitochondrial substrates allows cells to sense and respond to increased energy 
demand for G2/M transition and, subsequently, to upregulate mitochondrial 
respiration for successful cell-cycle progression.
