Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is important in stem cell biology, embryonic 
development, and disease, including cancer. However, the mechanism of Wnt signal 
transmission, notably how the receptors are activated, remains incompletely 
understood. We found that the prorenin receptor (PRR) is a component of the Wnt 
receptor complex. PRR functions in a renin-independent manner as an adaptor 
between Wnt receptors and the vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) 
complex. Moreover, PRR and V-ATPase were required to mediate Wnt signaling 
during antero-posterior patterning of Xenopus early central nervous system 
development. The results reveal an unsuspected role for the prorenin receptor, 
V-ATPase activity, and acidification during Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
