4-Aminobutyrate type A (GABA(A)) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) is a 
ubiquitin-like modifier implicated in the intracellular trafficking of GABA(A) 
receptors, and belongs to a family of proteins involved in intracellular 
vesicular transport processes, such as autophagy and intra-Golgi transport. In 
this article, it is demonstrated that calreticulin is a high affinity ligand of 
GABARAP. Calreticulin, although best known for its functions as a Ca(2+) 
-dependent chaperone and a Ca(2+) -buffering protein in the endoplasmic 
reticulum, is also localized to the cytosol and exerts a variety of 
extra-endoplasmic reticulum functions. By phage display screening of a 
randomized peptide library, peptides that specifically bind GABARAP were 
identified. Their amino acid sequences allowed us to identify calreticulin as a 
potential GABARAP binding protein. GABARAP binding to calreticulin was confirmed 
by pull-down experiments with brain lysate and colocalization studies in N2a 
cells. Calreticulin and GABARAP interact with a dissociation constant K(d) = 64 
nm and a mean lifetime of the complex of 20 min. Thus, the interaction between 
GABARAP and calreticulin is the strongest so far reported for each protein.
