The deficiency of retinoblastoma (Rb) gene deregulates E2F transcription factors 
and thus induces E2F target genes directly or p53 target genes indirectly via 
mouse p19(Arf) (or p14(ARF) in humans), an E2F target gene. Here, we identified 
that etoposide-induced 2.4 mRNA (Ei24)/p53-induced gene 8 (Pig8), a p53 target 
gene involved in apoptosis and autophagy, was up-regulated in Rb(-/-) mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The Ei24 promoter was activated by E2F1 via 
multiple E2F-responsive elements, independently of the previously reported 
p53-responsive element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that E2F1 
directly acts on the mouse Ei24 promoter. We observed that Ei24 expression was 
suppressed in p53(-/-) MEFs upon UVC irradiation, which was exacerbated in 
p53(-/-) E2f1(-/-) MEFs, supporting the positive role of E2F1 on Ei24 
transcription. Furthermore, Ei24 knockdown sensitized p53(-/-) MEFs against UVC 
irradiation. Together, our data indicate that Ei24 is a novel E2F target gene 
contributing to the survival of p53-deficient cells upon UVC irradiation and 
thus may have a potential significance as a therapeutic target of certain 
chemotherapy for treating p53-deficient tumors.

Abstract

The deficiency of retinoblastoma ( Rb ) gene deregulates E2F transcription factors and thus induces E2F target genes directly or p53 target genes indirectly via mouse p19 Arf (or p14 ARF in humans), an E2F target gene. Here, we identified that etoposide-induced 2.4 mRNA ( Ei24 )/p53-induced gene 8 ( Pig8 ), a p53 target gene involved in apoptosis and autophagy, was up-regulated in Rb −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The Ei24 promoter was activated by E2F1 via multiple E2F-responsive elements, independently of the previously reported p53-responsive element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that E2F1 directly acts on the mouse Ei24 promoter. We observed that Ei24 expression was suppressed in p53 −/− MEFs upon UVC irradiation, which was exacerbated in p53 −/− E2f1 −/− MEFs, supporting the positive role of E2F1 on Ei24 transcription. Furthermore, Ei24 knockdown sensitized p53 −/− MEFs against UVC irradiation. Together, our data indicate that Ei24 is a novel E2F target gene contributing to the survival of p53 -deficient cells upon UVC irradiation and thus may have a potential significance as a therapeutic target of certain chemotherapy for treating p53 -deficient tumors.

Introduction

The retinoblastoma gene ( Rb ) 4 was the first tumor suppressor gene to be identified in humans, and its loss of function is implicated in a wide variety of human cancers, including retinoblastomas ( 1 ). The Rb gene product (pRb) is a critical component of the cell cycle because it regulates the activity of E2F transcription factors, which induce the expression of genes required for cell cycle progression, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( 2 ). When E2F is activated or deregulated, Rb-induced cell cycle arrest is compromised ( 3 ). Furthermore, deregulated E2F transcription factors can enforce quiescent cells to re-enter the cell cycle ( 4 ).

pRb/E2F is controlled by p53, which is a critical tumor suppressor known as the guardian of the genome ( 5 ). More than 50% of human cancers contain a mutation of p53 ( 6 ), and p53-mediated tumor suppression is mainly dependent on its activity as a transcription factor. The mutations occur most frequently in the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein ( 7 ). In fact, p53 can activate a plethora of genes that regulate cell cycle progress, apoptosis, and DNA repair under stressful conditions ( 8 ). p21 Waf1 is a well known p53 target gene that is involved in the regulation of the Rb/E2F pathway. p21 Waf1 can directly bind to and inhibit all cyclin-CDK complexes, whereas p16 Ink4a specifically inhibits cyclin D-associated complexes of CDK4 and CDK6 ( 9 ). The resulting hypophosphorylation of pRb blocks the activation of E2F transcription factors.

In addition to their roles in cell cycle progression, E2F genes are important for apoptosis. In fact, diverse proapoptotic genes are directly regulated by E2F transcription factors ( 2 ), whose physiological significance has been demonstrated using mouse models deficient for E2F transcription factors. E2f1 -deficient mice exhibit defects in apoptosis and are rather prone to tumorigenesis ( 10 , 11 ). E2F2 and E2F3 are required for S phase entry induced by c-Myc ( 12 ). These phenotypes are supported by E2F-mediated regulation of proapoptotic genes including Bax/Bad , Apaf1 , caspase-3 , and caspase-9 ( 2 ).

Etoposide-induced 2.4 mRNA ( Ei24 ), also known as p53-induced gene 8 ( Pig8 ), was first identified as an up-regulated transcript in etoposide-treated NIH3T3 cells ( 13 ) and was later characterized as a p53 target gene ( 14 ). Ei24 was also identified as a prerequisite gene for executing autophagy ( 15 ). Because its ectopic expression induces cell death and suppresses cellular growth, Ei24 has been regarded as a tumor suppressor gene with a proapoptotic function ( 14 ). In support of this characterization, Ei24 is located on chromosome 11q24, which is frequently lost in neoplastic lesions, including breast cancers ( 16 ). Furthermore, because Ei24 is a Bcl2-binding protein localized on the endoplasmic reticulum with potential roles in preventing the spreading of tumors ( 17 ), it is believed to be a critical downstream regulator of p53 in tumor suppression. We recently reported that Ei24 stabilizes protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and that its deficiency attenuates PKCα signaling and skin carcinogenesis in mice ( 18 ), suggesting that the physiological role of EI24 is complex and may manifest differently according to tissue- and/or in a stress-specific manner.

Even though a large number of genes have been identified as E2F target genes, the role of pRb/E2F has not been fully elucidated. Recently, we analyzed the alteration in the gene expression pattern induced by Rb deficiency ( 19 ). Among the deregulated genes, the induction of Ei24 was observed in Rb −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In the present study, we characterized Ei24 as an E2F target gene, suggesting that Ei24 may act as a key mediator in the downstream pathways of both pRb/E2F and p53.

DISCUSSION

In the present study, we identified Ei24 , a p53 target gene, as an up-regulated gene in Rb −/− MEFs, and we subsequently characterized it as an E2F1 target gene. p53 and pRb/E2F are closely related in modulating diverse cellular physiologies. When Rb is deficient, deregulated E2F up-regulates the expression of p19 Arf , an important tumor suppressor gene alternatively encoded by Ink4a/Arf locus ( 24 , 29 , 30 ). p19 Arf then executes a critical role in regulating the p53 activity by compromising the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 ( 31 – 33 ). This molecular interaction allows diverse p53 and E2F target genes to be simultaneously induced in Rb −/− MEFs. Besides the Ink4a/Arf locus, cross-talk between p53 and pRb/E2F is also achieved by sharing target genes or by regulating distinct genes of a common physiological process. For example, Apaf1 is directly up-regulated by both p53 and E2F1 ( 23 ). Bax , a p53 target gene, and Apaf1 , a common target of E2F and p53, are critical components for transducing intrinsic apoptotic signals and cooperate with E2F target genes including caspases-3 and 7–9 , to properly execute apoptosis ( 34 ). Along these lines, considering its expressional regulation, EI24 may participate in cellular processes that are commonly governed by both p53 and E2F.

The potential significance of Ei24 has been highlighted as a p53 target gene for apoptosis and growth suppression ( 14 ) and as an autophagy gene ( 15 ). As a lethal stress, UVC irradiation actively induces cell death through both p53-dependent and independent pathways ( 35 , 36 ). Our results indicate that Ei24 expression is suppressed by UVC irradiation ( Fig. 3 ), presumably by the activation of pRb and/or its homologues, p107 and p130 ( 37 ). However, because this phenomenon was accelerated by E2f1 deficiency, E2F1 should have a positive role in regulating Ei24 expression upon UVC irradiation. Previous studies have described Ei24 as a proapoptotic gene, and thus its putative role as a tumor suppressor is expected ( 14 , 17 ). In fact, etoposide induces Ei24 expression ( 13 ), and Ei24 knockdown confers cellular resistance to etoposide-induced cell death in NIH3T3 cells ( 38 ). Although these lines of evidence suggest the possible role of EI24 as a tumor suppressor, we recently reported that Ei24 -heterozygous knock-out mice manifested attenuated skin tumorigenesis phenotypes upon 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA)/12- O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment ( 18 ). Consistently, Ei24 knockdown sensitizes p53 −/− MEFs to UVC irradiation ( Fig. 5 ), raising the possibility that EI24 might exert a protective effect under a certain stress independently of p53. These results also suggest that the physiological role of EI24 in cell death is complicated and may be context- and/or environment-dependent. Meanwhile, its physiological role can be deduced from the function of EI24 as an autophagy gene ( 15 ). Autophagy is also regulated by both p53 and E2F1 ( 39 ). Because UVC irradiation seriously damages cells, the damaged organelles, including mitochondria, should be removed by autophagy. If they are not properly eliminated by autophagy, lethal materials produced and released by the damaged mitochondria ( e.g. reactive oxygen species or proapoptotic molecules) may make Ei24 -silenced cells susceptible to UVC irradiation.

As Ei24 knockdown increased the sensitivity of p53 −/− MEFs against UVC irradiation ( Fig. 5 ), EI24 might be critical for determining cellular survival under a certain stress independently of p53. In other words, it is highly possible that EI24 is a critical factor modulating the survival of p53-deficient cells in human diseases, e.g. cancers. Therefore, EI24 can be considered as a potential therapeutic target in p53 -deficient tumors.

Taken together, these results imply that EI24 is a critical mediator/effector required for the crosstalk between p53 and pRb/E2F pathways dedicated to tumor suppression. Therefore, understanding and identifying the specific conditions that require EI24 may provide important clues for the prevention and treatment of neoplastic diseases in humans, and it may be helpful to scrutinize the molecular mechanisms of EI24 action and to evaluate the extent of mutations and expression of Ei24 gene in diverse human cancers for proper cancer treatments.
