STUDY QUESTION: What is the effect of defects in the manchette protein IQ 
motif-containing N (IQCN) on sperm flagellar assembly?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Deficiency in IQCN causes sperm flagellar assembly defects and 
male infertility.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The manchette is a transient structure that is involved 
in the shaping of the human spermatid nucleus and protein transport within 
flagella. Our group recently reported that the manchette protein IQCN is 
essential for fertilization. Variants in IQCN lead to total fertilization 
failure and defective acrosome structure phenotypes. However, the function of 
IQCN in sperm flagellar assembly is still unknown.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Fifty men with infertility were recruited from a 
university-affiliated center from January 2014 to October 2022.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from the 
peripheral blood samples of all 50 individuals for whole-exome sequencing. The 
ultrastructure of the spermatozoa was assessed by transmission electron 
microscopy. Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) was used to test the 
parameters of curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), and 
average path velocity (VAP). An Iqcn knockout (Iqcn-/-) mouse model was 
generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology to evaluate sperm motility and the 
ultrastructure of the flagellum. Hyperactivation and sperm fertilizing ability 
were assessed in a mouse model. Immunoprecipitation followed by liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect IQCN-binding proteins. 
Immunofluorescence was used to validate the localization of IQCN-binding 
proteins.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Biallelic variants in IQCN (c.3913A>T and 
c.3040A>G; c.2453_2454del) were identified in our cohort of infertile men. The 
sperm from the affected individuals showed an irregular '9 + 2' structure of the 
flagellum, which resulted in abnormal CASA parameters. Similar phenotypes were 
observed in Iqcn-/- male mice. VSL, VCL, and VAP in the sperm of Iqcn-/- male 
mice were significantly lower than those in Iqcn+/+ male mice. Partial 
peripheral doublet microtubules (DMTs) and outer dense fibers (ODFs) were 
absent, or a chaotic arrangement of DMTs was observed in the principal piece and 
end piece of the sperm flagellum. Hyperactivation and IVF ability were impaired 
in Iqcn-/- male mice. In addition, we investigated the causes of motility 
defects and identified IQCN-binding proteins including CDC42 and the 
intraflagellar transport protein families that regulate flagellar assembly 
during spermiogenesis.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: More cases are needed to demonstrate the 
relation between IQCN variants and phenotypes.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings expand the genetic and 
phenotypic spectrum of IQCN variants in causing male infertility, providing a 
genetic marker for sperm motility deficiency and male infertility.
