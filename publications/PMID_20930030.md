Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a quality control mechanism that detects 
and degrades mRNAs containing premature stop codons (PTCs). In vertebrates, PTCs 
trigger efficient NMD when located upstream of an exon junction complex (EJC). 
Degradation of PTC-containing mRNAs requires the endonucleolytic activity of 
SMG6, a conserved NMD factor; nevertheless, the precise role for the EJC in NMD 
and how the SMG6 endonuclease is recruited to NMD targets have been unclear. 
Here we show that SMG6 interacts directly with the EJC via two conserved 
EJC-binding motifs (EBMs). We further show that the SMG6-EJC interaction is 
required for NMD. Our results reveal an unprecedented role for the EJC in 
recruiting the SMG6 endonuclease to NMD targets. More generally, our findings 
identify the EBM as a protein motif present in a handful of proteins, and 
suggest that EJCs establish multiple and mutually exclusive interactions with 
various protein partners, providing a plausible explanation for the myriad 
functions performed by this complex in post-transcriptional mRNA regulation.
