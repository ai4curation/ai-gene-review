Coordinated activities of protein kinases and phosphatases ensure 
phosphorylation homeostasis, which, when perturbed, can instigate diseases, 
including cancer. Yet, in contrast to kinases, much less is known about protein 
phosphatase functions and their interactions and complexes. Here, we used 
quantitative affinity proteomics to assay protein-protein interactions for 54 
phosphatases distributed across the three major protein phosphatase families, 
with additional analysis of their 12 co-factors. We identified 838 
high-confidence interactions, of which 631, to our knowledge, have not been 
reported before. We show that inhibiting the activity of phosphatases PP1 and 
PP2A by okadaic acid disrupts their specific interactions, supporting the 
potential of therapeutics that target these proteins. Additional analyses 
revealed candidate physical and functional interaction links to 
phosphatase-based regulation of several signaling pathways and to human cancer. 
Our study provides an initial glimpse of the protein interaction landscape of 
phosphatases and their functions in cellular regulation.
