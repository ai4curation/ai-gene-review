In addition to establishing dendritic coverage of the receptive field, neurons 
need to adjust their dendritic arbors to match changes of the receptive field. 
Here, we show that dendrite arborization (da) sensory neurons establish 
dendritic coverage of the body wall early in Drosophila larval development and 
then grow in precise proportion to their substrate, the underlying body wall 
epithelium, as the larva more than triples in length. This phenomenon, referred 
to as scaling growth of dendrites, requires the function of the microRNA (miRNA) 
bantam (ban) in the epithelial cells rather than the da neurons themselves. We 
further show that ban in epithelial cells dampens Akt kinase activity in 
adjacent neurons to influence dendrite growth. This signaling between epithelial 
cells and neurons receiving sensory input from the body wall synchronizes their 
growth to ensure proper dendritic coverage of the receptive field.
