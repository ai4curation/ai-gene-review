In all eukaryotes, CAP-Gly proteins control important cellular processes. The 
molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of CAP-Gly domains, however, are 
still poorly understood. Here we use the complex formed between the CAP-Gly 
domain of p150(glued) and the C-terminal zinc knuckle of CLIP170 as a model 
system to explore the structure-function relationship of CAP-Gly-mediated 
protein interactions. We demonstrate that the conserved GKNDG motif of CAP-Gly 
domains is responsible for targeting to the C-terminal EEY/F sequence motifs of 
CLIP170, EB proteins and microtubules. The CAP-Gly-EEY/F interaction is 
essential for the recruitment of the dynactin complex by CLIP170 and for 
activation of CLIP170. Our findings define the molecular basis of CAP-Gly domain 
function, including the tubulin detyrosination-tyrosination cycle. They further 
establish fundamental roles for the interaction between CAP-Gly proteins and 
C-terminal EEY/F sequence motifs in regulating complex and dynamic cellular 
processes.
