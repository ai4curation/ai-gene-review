BACKGROUND & AIMS: Given the observations that intestinal epithelial cells 
(IECs) can present antigens to CD4(+) T lymphocytes and that professional 
antigen-presenting cells secrete exosomes (antigen-presenting vesicles), we 
hypothesized that IECs may secrete exosomes carrying molecules implicated in 
antigen presentation, which may be able to cross the basement membrane and 
convey immune information to noncontiguous immune cells.
METHODS: Human IEC lines HT29-19A and T84-DRB1*0401/CIITA were grown on 
microporous filters. Release of exosomes under basal or inflammatory conditions 
was evaluated in conditioned apical and basolateral media after differential 
ultracentrifugations. Morphologic and biochemical characterization of exosomes 
was performed using immunoelectron microscopy, Western blotting, and 
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: The intestinal cell lines released 30-90-nm-diameter vesicles from the 
apical and basolateral sides, and this release was significantly increased in 
the presence of interferon gamma. MHC class I, MHC class II, CD63, 
CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, and A33 antigen were present in epithelial-derived 
exosomes. CONCLUSIONS; Human IEC lines secrete exosomes bearing accessory 
molecules that may be involved in antigen presentation. These data are 
consistent with a model in which IECs may influence antigen presentation in the 
mucosal or systemic immune system independent of direct cellular contact with 
effector cells.
