Beta-catenin functions both as an adherens junction adhesion protein and as an 
essential mediator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Wnts stabilize 
beta-catenin and promote its accumulation in the nucleus, where it regulates 
transcription of the target genes. Here we show that Smad7 promotes cell-cell 
adhesion by stabilizing beta-catenin and consequently increases the 
beta-catenin-E-cadherin complex level at the plasma membrane. A Smad7-Axin 
interaction disassociates GSK-3beta and beta-catenin from Axin, as well as 
inhibits the recruitment of Smurf2, an E3 ligase, to beta-catenin, thus 
protecting beta-catenin from phosphorylation and degradation. Smad7 increases 
the stabilized beta-catenin to form a complex with E-cadherin and stabilizes the 
E-cadherin-beta-catenin complex. Thereby, rather than being translocated to the 
nucleus for regulating the target gene transcription, 
Smad7-stabilized-beta-catenin is shunted to the E-cadherin complex to modulate 
cell-cell adhesion.
