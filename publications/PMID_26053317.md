Primary cilia are sensory organelles that harbor various receptors such as G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We analyzed subcellular localization of 138 
non-odorant GPCRs. We transfected GPCR expression vectors into NIH3T3 cells, 
induced ciliogenesis by serum starvation, and observed subcellular localization 
of GPCRs by immunofluorescent staining. We found that several GPCRs whose 
ligands are involved in feeding behavior, including prolactin-releasing hormone 
receptor (PRLHR), neuropeptide FF receptor 1 (NPFFR1), and neuromedin U receptor 
1 (NMUR1), localized to the primary cilia. In addition, we found that a short 
form of dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2S) is efficiently transported to the primary 
cilia, while a long form of dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2L) is rarely transported 
to the primary cilia. Using an anti-Prlhr antibody, we found that Prlhr 
localized to the cilia on the surface of the third ventricle in the vicinity of 
the hypothalamic periventricular nucleus. We generated the Npy2r-Cre transgenic 
mouse line in which Cre-recombinase is expressed under the control of the 
promoter of Npy2r encoding a ciliary GPCR. By mating Npy2r-Cre mice with Ift80 
flox mice, we generated Ift80 conditional knockout (CKO) mice in which 
Npy2r-positive cilia were diminished in number. We found that Ift80 CKO mice 
exhibited a body weight increase. Our results suggest that Npy2r-positive cilia 
are important for body weight control.
