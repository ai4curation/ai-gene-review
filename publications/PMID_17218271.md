Transrepression is widely utilized to negatively regulate gene expression, but 
the mechanisms by which different nuclear receptors effect gene- and 
signal-specific transrepression programs remain poorly understood. Here, we 
report the identification of alternative SUMOylation-dependent mechanisms that 
enable PPARgamma and LXRs to negatively regulate overlapping but distinct 
subsets of proinflammatory genes. Ligand-dependent conjugation of SUMO2/3 to 
LXRs or SUMO1 to PPARgamma targets them to promoters of TLR target genes, where 
they prevent the signal-dependent removal of NCoR corepressor complexes required 
for transcriptional activation. SUMO1-PPARgamma and SUMO2/3-LXRs inhibit 
distinct NCoR clearance mechanisms, allowing promoter- and TLR-specific patterns 
of repression. Mutational analysis and studies of naturally occurring oxysterol 
ligands indicate that the transactivation and SUMOylation-dependent 
transrepression activities of LXRs can be independently regulated. These studies 
define parallel but functionally distinct pathways that are utilized by 
PPARgamma and LXRs to differentially regulate complex programs of gene 
expression that control immunity and homeostasis.
