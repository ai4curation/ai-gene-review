With the completion of the sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome and the recent 
advances in proteomic technology, the identification of proteins from highly 
complex mixtures is now possible. Rather than using gel electrophoresis and 
peptide mass fingerprinting, we have used multidimensional protein 
identification technology (MudPIT) to analyse the "tightly-bound" proteome for 
purified cell walls from Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures. Using 
bioinformatics for the prediction of signal peptides for targeting to the 
secretory pathway and for the absence of ER retention signal, 89 proteins were 
selected as potential extracellular proteins. Only 33% of these were identified 
in previous proteomic analyses of Arabidopsis cell walls. A functional 
classification revealed that a large proportion of the proteins were enzymes, 
notably carbohydrate active enzymes, peroxidases and proteases. Comparison of 
all the published proteomic analyses for the Arabidopsis cell wall identified 
268 non-redundant genes encoding wall proteins. Sixty of these (22%) were 
derived from our analysis of tightly-bound wall proteins.
