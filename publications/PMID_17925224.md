The cellular response to unfolded and misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial 
matrix is poorly understood. Here, we report on a genome-wide RNAi-based screen 
for genes that signal the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) in 
C. elegans. Unfolded protein stress in the mitochondria correlates with complex 
formation between a homeodomain-containing transcription factor DVE-1 and the 
small ubiquitin-like protein UBL-5, both of which are encoded by genes required 
for signaling the UPR(mt). Activation of the UPR(mt) correlates temporally and 
spatially with nuclear redistribution of DVE-1 and with its enhanced binding to 
the promoters of mitochondrial chaperone genes. These events and the downstream 
UPR(mt) are attenuated in animals with reduced activity of clpp-1, which encodes 
a mitochondrial matrix protease homologous to bacterial ClpP. As ClpP is known 
to function in the bacterial heat-shock response, our findings suggest that 
eukaryotes utilize component(s) from the protomitochondrial symbiont to signal 
the UPR(mt).
