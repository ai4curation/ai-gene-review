The growth arrest specific 1 (gas1) gene is highly expressed in quiescent 
mammalian cells (Schneider et al., 1988, Cell 54, 787-793). Overexpression of 
gas1 in normal and some cancer cell lines could inhibit G(0)/G(1) transition. 
Presently, we have examined the functions of this gene in the developing mouse 
embryo. The spatial-temporal expression patterns for gas1 were established in 
8.5- to 14.5-day-old embryos by immunohistochemical staining and in situ 
hybridization. Gas1 was found heterogeneously expressed in most organ systems 
including the brain, heart, kidney, limb, lung, and gonad. The antiproliferative 
effects of gas1 on 10.5 and 12.5 day limb cells were investigated by flow 
cytometry. In 10.5 day limbs cells, gas1 overexpression could not prevent 
G(0)/G(1) progression. It was determined that gas1 could only induce growth 
arrest if p53 was also coexpressed. In contrast, gas1 overexpression alone was 
able to induce growth arrest in 12.5 day limb cells. We also examined the cell 
cycle profile of gas1-expressing and nonexpressing cells by immunochemistry and 
flow cytometry. For 10.5 day Gas1-expressing heart and limb cells, we did not 
find these cells preferentially distributed at G0/G1, as compared with 
Gas1-negative cells. However, in the 12.5 day heart and limb, we did find 
significantly more Gas1-expressing cells distributed at G0/G1 phase than 
Gas1-negative cells. These results implied that Gas1 alone, during the early 
stages of development, could not inhibit cell growth. This inhibition was only 
established when the embryo grew older. We have overexpressed gas1 in 
subconfluent embryonic limb cells to determine the ability of gas1 to cross-talk 
with various response elements of important transduction pathways. Specifically, 
we have examined the interaction of gas1 with Ap-1, NFkappaB, and c-myc 
responsive elements tagged with a SEAP reporter. In 10.5 day limb cells, gas1 
overexpression had little effect on Ap-1, NFkappaB, and c-myc activities. In 
contrast, gas1 overexpression in 12.5 day limb cells enhanced AP-1 response 
while it inhibited NFkappaB and c-myc activities. These responses were directly 
associated with the ability of gas1 to induce growth arrest in embryonic limb 
cells. In the 12.5 day hindlimb, gas1 was found strongly expressed in the 
interdigital tissues. We overexpressed gas1 in these tissues and discovered that 
it promoted interdigital cell death. Our in situ hybridization studies of limb 
sections and micromass cultures revealed that, during the early stages of 
chondrogenesis, only cells surrounding the chondrogenic condensations expressed 
gas1. The gene was only expressed by chondrocytes after the cartilage started to 
differentiate. To understand the function of gas1 in chondrogenesis, we 
overexpressed the gene in limb micromass cultures. It was found that cells 
overexpressing gas1/GFP could not participate in cartilage formation, unlike 
cells that just express the GFP reporter. We speculated that the reason gas1 was 
expressed outside the chondrogenic nodules was to restrict cells from being 
recruited into the nodules and thereby defining the boundary between 
chondrogenic and nonchondrogenic forming regions.
