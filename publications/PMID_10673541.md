1. Activity of amino acid transport and relative abundance of mRNAs encoding 
related transporters have been studied in parallel either before or following in 
vitro culture of explants of human placental chorionic villi. 2. Amino acid 
transport activities through systems L (1.9-fold), y+L (2.6-fold) and y+ 
(3.2-fold) were markedly enhanced following culture for 48 h. 3. Relative mRNA 
abundance (determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for 
the heavy chain of CD98 surface antigen and for the cationic amino acid 
transporter-1 were similarly stimulated (2.8-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively). 
In contrast, none of the mRNA levels for light chains of CD98 (system L-amino 
acid transporter-1, system L-amino acid transporter-2, system y+L-amino acid 
transporter-1 and system y+L-amino acid transporter-2) studied nor for the 
cationic amino acid transporter-2B were altered.
