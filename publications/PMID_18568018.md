Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) family members regulate many 
developmental and pathological events through Smad transcriptional modulators. 
How nuclear accumulation of Smad is coupled to the transcriptional machinery is 
poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that in response to TGFbeta stimulation 
the transcriptional regulator TAZ binds heteromeric Smad2/3-4 complexes and is 
recruited to TGFbeta response elements. In human embryonic stem cells TAZ is 
required to maintain self-renewal markers and loss of TAZ leads to inhibition of 
TGFbeta signalling and differentiation into a neuroectoderm lineage. In the 
absence of TAZ, Smad2/3-4 complexes fail to accumulate in the nucleus and 
activate transcription. Furthermore, TAZ, which itself engages in shuttling, 
dominantly controls Smad nucleocytoplasmic localization and can be retained in 
the nucleus by transcriptional co-factors such as ARC105, a component of the 
Mediator complex. TAZ thus defines a hierarchical system regulating Smad nuclear 
accumulation and coupling to the transcriptional machinery.
