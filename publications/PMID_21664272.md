Adaptor protein Nck1 binds a number of intracellular proteins and influences 
various signaling pathways. Here we show that Nck1 directly binds and activates 
the GTPase-activating protein of Ras (RasGAP), which is responsible for the 
down-regulation of Ras. The first and the third SH3 domains of Nck1 and the 
NH(2)-terminal proline-rich sequence of RasGAP contribute most to the complex 
formation causing direct molecular interaction between the two proteins. Cell 
adhesion to the substrate is obligatory for the Nck1 and RasGAP association, as 
cell detachment makes RasGAP incapable of associating with Nck1. This leads to 
the complex dissipation, decrease of RasGAP activity and the increase of 
H-Ras-GTP level in the detached cells. Our findings reveal unexpected feature of 
adaptor protein Nck1 as the regulator of RasGAP activity.
