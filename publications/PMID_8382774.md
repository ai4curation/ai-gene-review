We have used a transient expression system and mutant platelet-derived growth 
factor (PDGF) receptors to study the binding specificities of the Src homology 2 
(SH2) regions of the Ras GTPase-activator protein (GAP) and the p85 alpha 
subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase). A number of fusion 
proteins, each tagged with an epitope allowing recognition by a monoclonal 
antibody, were expressed at levels comparable to those of endogenous GAP. Fusion 
proteins containing the central SH2-SH3-SH2 region of GAP or the C-terminal 
region of p85 alpha, which includes two SH2 domains, bound to PDGF receptors in 
response to PDGF stimulation. Both fusion proteins showed the same requirements 
for tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the PDGF receptor as the full-length 
proteins from which they were derived, i.e., binding of the GAP fusion protein 
was reduced by mutation of Tyr-771, and binding of the p85 fusion protein was 
reduced by mutation of Tyr-740, Tyr-751, or both residues. Fusion proteins 
containing single SH2 domains from either GAP or p85 alpha did not bind 
detectably to PDGF receptors in this system, suggesting that two SH2 domains in 
a single polypeptide cooperate to raise the affinity of binding. The sequence 
specificities of individual SH2 domains were deduced from the binding properties 
of fusion proteins containing one SH2 domain from GAP and another from p85. The 
results suggest that the C-terminal GAP SH2 domain specifies binding to Tyr-771, 
the C-terminal p85 alpha SH2 domain binds to either Tyr-740 or Tyr-751, and each 
protein's N-terminal SH2 domain binds to unidentified phosphorylation 
sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

We have used a transient expression system and mutant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors to study the binding specificities of the Src homology 2 (SH2) regions of the Ras GTPase-activator protein (GAP) and the p85 alpha subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase). A number of fusion proteins, each tagged with an epitope allowing recognition by a monoclonal antibody, were expressed at levels comparable to those of endogenous GAP. Fusion proteins containing the central SH2-SH3-SH2 region of GAP or the C-terminal region of p85 alpha, which includes two SH2 domains, bound to PDGF receptors in response to PDGF stimulation. Both fusion proteins showed the same requirements for tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the PDGF receptor as the full-length proteins from which they were derived, i.e., binding of the GAP fusion protein was reduced by mutation of Tyr-771, and binding of the p85 fusion protein was reduced by mutation of Tyr-740, Tyr-751, or both residues. Fusion proteins containing single SH2 domains from either GAP or p85 alpha did not bind detectably to PDGF receptors in this system, suggesting that two SH2 domains in a single polypeptide cooperate to raise the affinity of binding. The sequence specificities of individual SH2 domains were deduced from the binding properties of fusion proteins containing one SH2 domain from GAP and another from p85.
