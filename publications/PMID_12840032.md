The mechanism of senescence-associated cytoplasmic induction of p-Erk1/2 
(SA-p-Erk1/2) proteins in human diploid fibroblasts was investigated. p-Erk1/2 
proteins were efficiently dephosphorylated in vitro by protein phosphatases 1 
and 2A (PP1/2A) and MAPK phosphatase 3 (MKP3). Specific activity of PP1/2A and 
MKP3 activity significantly decreased during cellular senescence, whereas their 
protein expression levels did not. To investigate possible mechanism of 
phosphatase inactivation, we measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation 
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and found it was much higher in 
mid-old cells than the young cells. Treating the young cells once with 1 mm H2O2 
remarkably induced p-Erk1/2 expression; however, it was transient unless 
repeatedly treated until 72 h. Multiple treatment of the cells with 0.2 mm H2O2 
significantly duplicated inactivation of PP1/2A; however, thiol-specific 
reagents could reverse the PP1/2A activities, suggesting the oxidation of 
cysteine molecule in PP1/2A by the increased ROS. When the cells were pretreated 
with 10 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine for 1 h, Erk1/2 activation was completely 
blocked. To elucidate which cysteine residue and/or metal ion in PP1/2A was 
modified by H2O2, electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analyses were 
performed with purified PP1C-alpha and found Cys62-SO3H and Cys105-SO3H, 
implicating the tertiary structure perturbation. H2O2 inhibited purified 
PP1C-alpha activity by both oxidation of Cys residues and metal ion(s), 
evidenced by dithiothreitol and ascorbate-restoration assay. In summary, 
SA-p-Erk1/2 was most likely due to the oxidation of PP1/2A, which resulted from 
the continuous exposure of the cells to vast amounts of ROS generated during 
cellular senescence by oxidation of Cys62 and Cys105 in PP1C-alpha and metal 
ion(s).
