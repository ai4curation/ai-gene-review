Cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondria-specific glycerophospholipid, is required for 
diverse mitochondrial processes and orchestrates the function of various 
death-inducing proteins during apoptosis. Here, we identify a complex of the 
p53-regulated protein TRIAP1 (p53CSV) and PRELI in the mitochondrial 
intermembrane space (IMS), which ensures the accumulation of CL in mitochondria. 
TRIAP1/PRELI complexes exert lipid transfer activity in vitro and supply 
phosphatidic acid (PA) for CL synthesis in the inner membrane. Loss of TRIAP1 or 
PRELI impairs the accumulation of CL, facilitates the release of cytochrome c, 
and renders cells vulnerable to apoptosis upon intrinsic and extrinsic 
stimulation. Survival of TRIAP1- and PRELI-deficient cells is conferred by an 
excess of exogenously provided phosphatidylglycerol. Our results reveal a 
p53-dependent cell-survival pathway and highlight the importance of the CL 
content of mitochondrial membranes in apoptosis.
