The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) tumor suppressor protein accumulates in PML 
nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), and can induce growth arrest, cellular senescence and 
apoptosis. PML has also been localized in the cytoplasm, although its function 
in this localization remains elusive. A general property of primary cancers is 
their high glycolytic rate which results from increased glucose consumption. 
However, the mechanism by which cancer cells up-regulate glycolysis is not well 
understood. Here, we have shown that cytoplasmic PML (cPML) directly interacts 
with M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2), a key regulator of carbon fate. PKM2 
determines the proportion of carbons derived from glucose that are used for 
glycolytic energy production. Over-expression of PML-2KA mutant in the 
cytoplasm, which was generated by mutagenesis of the nuclear localization 
signals of PML, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells suppressed PKM2 activity and the 
accumulation of lactate. PKM2 exists in either an active tetrameric form which 
has high affinity for its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or a less active 
dimeric form which has low affinity for its substrate. Over-expression of 
PML-2KA suppressed the activity of the tetrameric form of PKM2, but not the 
dimeric form. Our findings suggest that cPML plays a role in tumor metabolism 
through its interaction with PKM2.
