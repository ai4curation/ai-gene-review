Many growth factors and cytokines act as cellular survival factors by preventing 
programmed cell death (apoptosis). However, the specific genes and corresponding 
proteins that mediate survival are poorly defined. To identify potential 
survival genes, a cDNA library was prepared from murine fibroblasts and screened 
by a functional expression cloning approach. A 1023-bp cDNA, AAC-11, was 
identified that encodes a protein of approximately 25 kDa. The AAC-11 gene shows 
strong species conservation and is ubiquitously expressed in embryonic and adult 
tissues with multiple transcripts, as well as in various human tumor cell lines. 
The predicted protein contains a leucine zipper domain but lacks a DNA-binding 
domain. BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts that were stably transfected with AAC-11 cDNA were 
viable in serum-free medium for up to 12 weeks. The protective action of AAC-11 
was abolished by mutation of leucines to arginines within the leucine zipper 
domain. We also isolated a longer AAC-11 cDNA that codes for up to an additional 
290 amino-terminal amino acids but did not protect against apoptosis. The cDNA 
for human AAC-11 was identified and exhibits strong homology with the murine 
species and retains the leucine zipper domain. Western immunoblots of BALB/c3T3 
cells using rabbit anti-AAC-11 polyclonal serum revealed a major native 55-kDa 
AAC-11 protein and a minor 25-kDa protein corresponding to the long and short 
forms of AAC-11 cDNA, respectively. In summary, we report a cDNA whose 
expression supports cell viability after withdrawal of growth factors. The 
corresponding native protein may function as a novel inhibitor of apoptosis.
