Gravitropic orientation and the elongation of etiolated hypocotyls are both 
regulated by red light through the phytochrome family of photoreceptors. The 
importance of phytochromes A and B (phyA and phyB) in these red light responses 
has been established through studies using phy mutants. To identify the roles 
that phytochromes play in gravitropism and elongation of roots, we studied the 
effects of red light on root elongation and then compared the gravitropic 
curvature from roots of phytochrome mutants of Arabidopsis (phyA, phyB, phyD and 
phyAB) with wild type. We found that red light inhibits root elongation 
approximately 35% in etiolated seedlings and that this response is controlled by 
phytochromes. Roots from dark- and light-grown double mutants (phyAB) and 
light-grown phyB seedlings have reduced elongation rates compared with wild 
type. In addition, roots from these seedlings (dark/light-grown phyAB and 
light-grown phyB) have reduced rates of gravitropic curvature compared with wild 
type. These results demonstrate roles for phytochromes in regulating both the 
elongation and gravitropic curvature of roots.
