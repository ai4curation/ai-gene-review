RATIONALE: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β was linked to abnormal vessel 
function and can mediate impairment of endothelial angiogenic responses. Its 
effect on microRNAs and downstream targets in this context is not known.
OBJECTIVE: To study the role of microRNAs in TGF-β-mediated angiogenic activity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: MicroRNA profiling after TGF-β treatment of endothelial 
cells identified miR-30a-3p, along with other members of the miR-30 family, to 
be strongly silenced. Supplementation of miR-30a-3p restored function in 
TGF-β-treated endothelial cells. We identified the epigenetic factor 
methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) to be a direct and functional target of 
miR-30a-3p. Viral overexpression of MeCP2 mimicked the effects of TGF-β, 
suggesting that derepression of MeCP2 after TGF-β treatment may be responsible 
for impaired angiogenic responses. Silencing of MeCP2 rescued detrimental TGF-β 
effects on endothelial cells. Microarray transcriptome analysis of 
MeCP2-overexpressing endothelial cells identified several deregulated genes 
important for endothelial cell function including sirtuin1 (Sirt1). In vivo 
experiments using endothelial cell-specific MeCP2 null or Sirt1 transgenic mice 
confirmed the involvement of MeCP2/Sirt1 in the regulation of angiogenic 
functions of endothelial cells. Additional experiments identified that MeCP2 
inhibited endothelial angiogenic characteristics partly by epigenetic silencing 
of Sirt1.
CONCLUSIONS: TGF-β impairs endothelial angiogenic responses partly by 
downregulating miR-30a-3p and subsequent derepression of MeCP2-mediated 
epigenetic silencing of Sirt1.
