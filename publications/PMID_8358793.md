The establishment of compartment-specific transcription in sporulating cells of 
B. subtilis is governed at the level of the activity of transcription factor 
sigma F. Genetic experiments have suggested that SpoIIAA and SpoIIAB, the other 
products of the sigma F operon, are involved in regulating sigma F activity. 
This activity is inhibited in the predivisional cell but specifically released 
from inhibition in the prespore about 1.5 hr after sporulation is induced. We 
now show that purified SpoIIAB inhibits transcription directed by sigma F in 
vitro. We note that the amino acid sequence of SpoIIAB shows some similarity to 
a group of bacterial histidine protein kinases, and we find that SpoIIAB is 
indeed a protein kinase that phosphorylates SpoIIAA on a serine residue. We 
suggest that this phosphorylation is responsible for the compartment-specific 
release of sigma F activity, perhaps through the formation of a tight complex 
between SpoIIAB and phosphorylated SpoIIAA.
