A specific covalently cross-linked complex between redox partners yeast 
cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) and cytochrome c (cyt. c) has been made by 
engineering cysteines into CCP and cyt. c that form an intermolecular disulfide 
bond in high yield. The crystal structure of the cross-linked complex has been 
solved to 1.88-A resolution and closely resembles the structure of the 
noncovalent complex [Pellitier, H. & Kraut, J. (1992) Science 258, 1748-1755]. 
The higher resolution of the covalent complex has enabled the location of 
ordered water molecules at the peroxidase-cytochrome c interface that serve to 
bridge between the two proteins by hydrogen bonding. As in the noncovalent 
complex, direct electrostatic interactions between protein groups appear not to 
be critical in complex formation. UV-visible spectroscopic and stopped-flow 
studies indicate that CCP in the covalent complex reacts normally with H(2)O(2) 
to give compound I. Stopped-flow kinetic studies also show that intramolecular 
electron transfer between the cross-linked ferrocytochrome c and the Trp-191 
cation radical site in CCP compound I occurs fast and is nearly complete within 
the dead time ( approximately 2 ms) of the instrument. These results indicate 
that the structure of the covalent complex closely mimics the physiological 
electron transfer complex. In addition, single-turnover and steady-state 
experiments reveal that CCP compound I in the covalent complex oxidizes 
exogenously added ferrocytochrome c at a slow rate (t(1/2) approximately 2 min), 
indicating that CCP does not have a second independent site for physiologically 
relevant electron transfer.
