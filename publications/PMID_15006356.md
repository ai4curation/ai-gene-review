A delicate balance of signals regulates cell survival. One set of these signals 
is derived from integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix 
(ECM). Loss of cell attachment to the ECM causes apoptosis, a process known as 
anoikis. In searching for proteins involved in cell adhesion-dependent 
regulation of anoikis, we identified Bit1, a mitochondrial protein that is 
released into the cytoplasm during apoptosis. Cytoplasmic Bit1 forms a complex 
with AES, a small Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) protein, and 
induces cell death with characteristics of caspase-independent apoptosis. Cell 
attachment to fibronectin counteracts the apoptotic effect of Bit1 and AES. 
Increasing Bit1 expression enhances anoikis, while suppressing the expression 
reduces it. Thus, we have elucidated an integrin-controlled pathway that is, at 
least in part, responsible for the cell survival effects of cell-ECM 
interactions.
