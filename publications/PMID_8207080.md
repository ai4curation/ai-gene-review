Cyclin E is a regulatory subunit of the cdc2-related protein kinase cdk2, which 
is activated shortly before S-phase entry, thus defining it as a G1 cyclin. We 
report here the existence of a 43 kDa splice variant of human cyclin E, termed 
cyclin Es, which lacks 49 amino acids within the cyclin box compared to the 
known 48 kDa cyclin E. Cyclin Es is expressed at approximately 1/10 of the level 
of full-length cyclin E in several cell lines analysed. The two cyclin E forms 
differ functionally in that cyclin E, but not cyclin Es, is able to complex with 
cdk2, to activate the histone H1, pRb and p107 in vitro kinase activity of cdk2 
and to rescue a triple CLN mutation in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin Es is the first 
splice variant of a cell cycle regulatory protein to be described. Our findings 
also indicate that the cyclin box in cyclin E mediates the interaction with 
cdk2.
