FtsQ, an essential protein for the Escherichia coli divisome assembly, is able 
to interact with various division proteins, namely FtsI, FtsL, FtsN, FtsB and 
FtsW. In this paper, the FtsQ domains involved in these interactions were 
identified by two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitations. Progressive 
deletions of the ftsQ gene suggested that the FtsQ self-interaction and its 
interactions with the other proteins are localized in three periplasmic 
subdomains: (i) residues 50-135 constitute one of the sites involved in FtsQ, 
FtsI and FtsN interaction, and this site is also responsible for FtsW 
interaction; (ii) the FtsB interaction is localized between residues 136 and 
202; and (iii) the FtsL interaction is localized at the very C-terminal 
extremity. In this third region, the interaction site for FtsK and also the 
second site for FtsQ, FtsI, FtsN interactions are located. As far as FtsW is 
concerned, this protein interacts with the fragment of the FtsQ periplasmic 
domain that spans residues 67-75. In addition, two protein subdomains, one 
constituted by residues 1-135 and the other from 136 to the end, are both able 
to complement an ftsQ null mutant. Finally, the unexpected finding that an E. 
coli ftsQ null mutant can be complemented, at least transiently, by the 
Streptococcus pneumoniae divIB/ftsQ gene product suggests a new strategy for 
investigating the biological significance of protein-protein interactions.
