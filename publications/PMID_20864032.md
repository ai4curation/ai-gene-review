TEL2 interacts with and is essential for the stability of all 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), but its mechanism of 
action remains unclear. Here, we show that TEL2 is constitutively phosphorylated 
on conserved serines 487 and 491 by casein kinase 2 (CK2). Proteomic analyses 
establish that the CK2 phosphosite of TEL2 confers binding to the 
R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, which possesses chaperon/prefoldin activities 
required during protein complex assembly. The PIH1D1 subunit of the R2TP complex 
binds directly to the CK2 phosphosite of TEL2 in vitro and is required for the 
TEL2-R2TP/prefoldin-like complex interaction in vivo. Although the CK2 
phosphosite mutant of TEL2 retains association with the PIKKs and HSP90 in 
cells, failure to interact with the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex results in 
instability of the PIKKs, principally mTOR and SMG1. We propose that TEL2 acts 
as a scaffold to coordinate the activities of R2TP/prefoldin-like and HSP90 
chaperone complexes during the assembly of the PIKKs.
