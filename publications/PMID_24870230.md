RNA ligases have essential roles in many cellular processes in eukaryotes, 
archaea and bacteria, including in RNA repair and stress-induced splicing of 
messenger RNA. In archaea and eukaryotes, RNA ligases also have a role in 
transfer RNA splicing to generate functional tRNAs required for protein 
synthesis. We recently identified the human tRNA splicing ligase, a multimeric 
protein complex with RTCB (also known as HSPC117, C22orf28, FAAP and D10Wsu52e) 
as the essential subunit. The functions of the additional complex components ASW 
(also known as C2orf49), CGI-99 (also known as C14orf166), FAM98B and the 
DEAD-box helicase DDX1 in the context of RNA ligation have remained unclear. 
Taking advantage of clusters of eukaryotic orthologous groups, here we find that 
archease (ARCH; also known as ZBTB8OS), a protein of unknown function, is 
required for full activity of the human tRNA ligase complex and, in cooperation 
with DDX1, facilitates the formation of an RTCB-guanylate intermediate central 
to mammalian RNA ligation. Our findings define a role for DDX1 in the context of 
the human tRNA ligase complex and suggest that the widespread co-occurrence of 
archease and RtcB proteins implies evolutionary conservation of their functional 
interplay.
