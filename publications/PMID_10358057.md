The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) 
receptor has recently been shown to interact with several classes of cytoplasmic 
proteins that regulate different aspects of AT1 receptor physiology. Employing 
yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse kidney cDNA library with the 
carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the murine AT1a receptor as a bait, we 
have isolated a novel protein with a predicted molecular mass of 18 kDa, which 
we have named ATRAP (for AT1 receptor-associated protein). ATRAP interacts 
specifically with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the AT1a receptor but not with 
those of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2), m3 muscarinic acetylcholine, bradykinin 
B2, endothelin B, and beta2-adrenergic receptors. The mRNA of ATRAP was 
abundantly expressed in kidney, heart, and testis but was poorly expressed in 
lung, liver, spleen, and brain. The ATRAP-AT1a receptor association was 
confirmed by affinity chromatography, by specific co-immunoprecipitation of the 
two proteins, and by fluorescence microscopy, showing co-localization of these 
proteins in intact cells. Overexpression of ATRAP in COS-7 cells caused a marked 
inhibition of AT1a receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C without 
affecting m3 receptor-mediated activation. In conclusion, we have isolated a 
novel protein that interacts specifically with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic 
domain of the AT1a receptor and affects AT1a receptor signaling.
