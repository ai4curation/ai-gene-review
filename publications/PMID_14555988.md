Smad transcription factors mediate the growth inhibitory effect of transforming 
growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in many cell types. Mutational inactivation of 
Smads has been correlated with loss of responsiveness to TGF-beta-mediated 
signal transduction. In this study, we compare the contribution of individual 
Smads to TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition and endogenous gene expression in 
isogenic cellular backgrounds. Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 expression were 
selectively inhibited in differentiation-competent cells by using improved 
antisense molecules. We found that TGF-beta mediates its inhibitory effect on 
HaCaT keratinocyte cell growth predominantly through Smad3. Inhibition of Smad3 
expression was sufficient to interfere with TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest 
and to induce or suppress endogenous cell cycle regulators. Inhibition of Smad4 
expression exhibited a partial effect, whereas inhibition of Smad2 expression 
had no effect. By gene expression profiling, we identified TGF-beta-dependent 
genes that are differentially regulated by Smad2 and Smad3 under regular growth 
conditions on a genome-wide scale. We show that Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 
contribute to the regulation of TGF-beta responses to varying extents, and 
demonstrate, in addition, that these Smads exhibit distinct roles in different 
cell types.
