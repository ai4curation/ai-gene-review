Pannexins (Panx) are a class of integral membrane proteins that have been 
proposed to exhibit characteristics similar to those of connexin family members. 
In this study, we utilized Cx43-positive BICR-M1R(k) cells to stably express 
Panx1, Panx3, or Panx1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) to assess their 
trafficking, cell surface dynamics, and interplay with the cytoskeletal network. 
Expression of a Sar1 dominant negative mutant revealed that endoplasmic 
reticulum to Golgi transport of Panx1 and Panx3 was mediated via COPII-dependent 
vesicles. Distinct from Cx43-GFP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching 
studies revealed that both Panx1-GFP and Panx3-GFP remained highly mobile at the 
cell surface. Unlike Cx43, Panx1-GFP exhibited no detectable interrelationship 
with microtubules. Conversely, cytochalasin B-induced disruption of 
microfilaments caused a severe loss of cell surface Panx1-GFP, a reduction in 
the recoverable fraction of Panx1-GFP that remained at the cell surface, and a 
decrease in Panx1-GFP vesicular transport. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation 
and co-sedimentation assays revealed actin as a novel binding partner of Panx1. 
Collectively, we conclude that although Panx1 and Panx3 share a common 
endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi secretory pathway to Cx43, their ultimate cell 
surface residency appears to be independent of cell contacts and the need for 
intact microtubules. Importantly, Panx1 has an interaction with actin 
microfilaments that regulates its cell surface localization and mobility.
