Integrin regulation in neutrophil adhesion is essential for innate immune 
response. c-Abl kinase is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and is critical for 
signaling transduction from various receptors in leukocytes. Using neutrophils 
and dHL-60 (neutrophil-like differentiation of HL-60) cells, we show that c-Abl 
kinase is activated by beta(2) integrin engagement and is required for beta(2) 
integrin-dependent neutrophil sustained adhesion and spreading. The expression 
of beta(2) integrin on neutrophils induced by TNF-alpha is not affected by c-Abl 
kinase inhibitor STI571, suggesting that c-Abl kinase is not involved in 
TNF-alpha-induced integrin activation. The recruitment of c-Abl kinase to 
beta(2) integrin is dependent on talin head domain, which constitutively 
interacts with beta(2) integrin cytoplasmic domain. After activated, c-Abl 
kinase increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav. The SH3 domain of c-Abl 
kinase is involved in its interaction with talin and Vav. Thus, c-Abl kinase 
plays an essential role in the activation of Vav induced by beta(2) integrin 
ligation and in regulating neutrophil-sustained adhesion and spreading.
