CLAC (collagenous Alzheimer amyloid plaque component) is a proteolytic fragment 
derived from a novel membrane-bound collagen, CLAC-P/collagen type XXV, that 
deposits in senile plaques associated with amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) in the 
brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. We previously showed that CLAC 
binds to the fibrillized form of Abeta in vitro, although the mechanism and the 
subdomains that mediate interaction of CLAC with Abeta as well as the effect of 
binding of CLAC on amyloid fibril formation remain unknown. Here we show that 
the collagenous domain 1 of CLAC, which is rich in positively charged amino acid 
residues, mediates its interaction with Abeta and that this binding is mediated 
by an electrostatic interaction and requires formation of the triple helix 
structure of CLAC. The soluble form of CLAC purified from the media of cells 
transfected with CLAC-P inhibited fibrillization of Abeta in vitro, especially 
in its elongation phase. These results suggest the anti-amyloidogenic roles of 
CLAC in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.
