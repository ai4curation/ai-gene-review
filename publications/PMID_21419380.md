Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a 
leukodystrophy characterized by early-onset macrocephaly and delayed-onset 
neurological deterioration. Recessive MLC1 mutations are observed in 75% of 
patients with MLC. Genetic-linkage studies failed to identify another gene. We 
recently showed that some patients without MLC1 mutations display the classical 
phenotype; others improve or become normal but retain macrocephaly. To find 
another MLC-related gene, we used quantitative proteomic analysis of 
affinity-purified MLC1 as an alternative approach and found that GlialCAM, an 
IgG-like cell adhesion molecule that is also called HepaCAM and is encoded by 
HEPACAM, is a direct MLC1-binding partner. Analysis of 40 MLC patients without 
MLC1 mutations revealed multiple different HEPACAM mutations. Ten patients with 
the classical, deteriorating phenotype had two mutations, and 18 patients with 
the improving phenotype had one mutation. Most parents with a single mutation 
had macrocephaly, indicating dominant inheritance. In some families with 
dominant HEPACAM mutations, the clinical picture and magnetic resonance imaging 
normalized, indicating that HEPACAM mutations can cause benign familial 
macrocephaly. In other families with dominant HEPACAM mutations, patients had 
macrocephaly and mental retardation with or without autism. Further experiments 
demonstrated that GlialCAM and MLC1 both localize in axons and colocalize in 
junctions between astrocytes. GlialCAM is additionally located in myelin. Mutant 
GlialCAM disrupts the localization of MLC1-GlialCAM complexes in astrocytic 
junctions in a manner reflecting the mode of inheritance. In conclusion, 
GlialCAM is required for proper localization of MLC1. HEPACAM is the second gene 
found to be mutated in MLC. Dominant HEPACAM mutations can cause either 
macrocephaly and mental retardation with or without autism or benign familial 
macrocephaly.
