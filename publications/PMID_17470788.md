The tumor suppressor p53 regulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis in

unwanted effects. Tight regulation of p53 is essential for maintaining normal 
cell growth. p53-associated cellular protein-testes derived (PACT, also known as

ubiquitination and degradation of p53 as a result of the increase of the 
p53-Hdm2 affinity. Consequently, PACT represses p53-dependent gene 
transcription. Knockdown of PACT significantly attenuates the p53-Hdm2 
interaction, reduces p53 polyubiquitination, and enhances p53 accumulation, 
leading to both apoptosis and cell growth retardation. Taken together, our data

Abstract

The tumor suppressor p53 regulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis in response to various types of stress, whereas excess p53 activity creates unwanted effects. Tight regulation of p53 is essential for maintaining normal cell growth. p53-associated cellular protein-testes derived (PACT, also known as P2P-R, RBBP6) is a 250-kDa Ring finger-containing protein that can directly bind to p53. PACT is highly up-regulated in esophageal cancer and may be a promising target for immunotherapy. However, the physiological role of the PACT–p53 interaction remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the disruption of PACT in mice leads to early embryonic lethality before embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), accompanied by an accumulation of p53 and widespread apoptosis. p53-null mutation partially rescues the lethality phenotype and prolonged survival to E11.5. Endogenous PACT can interact with Hdm2 and enhance Hdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 as a result of the increase of the p53–Hdm2 affinity. Consequently, PACT represses p53-dependent gene transcription. Knockdown of PACT significantly attenuates the p53–Hdm2 interaction, reduces p53 polyubiquitination, and enhances p53 accumulation, leading to both apoptosis and cell growth retardation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the PACT–p53 interaction plays a critical role in embryonic development and tumorigenesis and identify PACT as a member of negative regulators of p53.

Discussion

Tight regulation of p53 activity in an appropriate range is imperative for maintaining normal cell growth and preventing tumorigenesis. There is no question that Hdm2, a p53-interacting partner, plays a pivotal role in down-regulating p53 activities in numerous cellular settings such as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. To date, seven negative and three positive feedback loops were documented, six through the Hdm2 protein to regulate p53 activity ( 5 ). Recently, increasing amounts of data suggest that p53 ubiquitination and degradation are more complex than once thought. More E3 ligases were found with specificity for p53 dependent or independent of Hdm2 ( 22 – 24 ). In this paper, we demonstrate that PACT is another negative regulator of p53 by the involvement of Hdm2, acting as an E3 ligase.

In the previous study, stable overexpression of specific segments of PACT was shown to contribute to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ( 11 – 13 ). However, little is known about the function of full-length and endogenous PACT. Here, we systematically analyzed PACT's function and identified PACT as a pivotal negative regulator of p53. Our results lead to three major conclusions or implications: First, PACT is a negative regulator of p53 mediated by Hdm2, possibly acting as an E4 ligase. There is no question that Hdm2 plays a pivotal role in down-regulating p53 activities in numerous cellular settings. Nevertheless, growing evidence suggests that additional proteins may regulate Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. Here, we demonstrated that PACT could inhibit the accumulation of p53 by promoting its degradation mediated by Hdm2, repressing p53-dependent transactivation. Knockdown of endogenous PACT resulted in p53 accumulation in vivo and then induced both apoptosis and cell growth retardation in a p53-dependent manner. Our data identified that PACT is involved in the negative regulation of p53 function through physical interaction with Hdm2 and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. It is possible that PACT may provide a platform to promote the assembly of the p53–Hdm2 complex and fine-tune the p53 network. Second, PACT is essential for development, and its deficiency leads to early embryonic lethality, which is consistent with the fact that mutation of its homologue, SNAMA, results in apoptosis in embryos in Drosophila ( 25 ). During normal early mouse development, p53 activation is controlled by its negative regulators, and p53 is not activated before E11 ( 26 ). Otherwise, an excess of p53 activity in early embryos comes with unwanted effects. PACT may play an important role for monitoring p53 activity at this stage. This hypothesis is illustrated by studies conducted in mice, in whom inactivation of p53 was shown to partially rescue the embryonic lethality caused by loss of PACT function. Third, alteration of PACT expression and/or activity may be an important event during tumorigenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, PACT is widely expressed in many tumor cell lines, and its expression is found to be increased in tumors, such as esophageal ( 10 ) and breast cancer (L.L., unpublished data). However, the correlation of PACT overexpression and tumorigenesis remains unclear. Because inactivation of p53 is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells, our results demonstrated that PACT could inhibit tumor suppressor p53 function, providing a new possible functional mechanism by which PACT could promote tumorigenesis.

Notably, there are few proteins that could also bind Rb among the p53-negative regulators, except for Hdm2 and gankyrin, which play important roles in both of the two tumor suppressor pathways ( 27 ). PACT may be a member of the small family and function as a scaffold protein to promote the assembly of tumor suppressor complexes. Taken together, our findings highlight the complexity of the Hdm2–p53 ubiquitination process and prove that p53 ubiquitination and degradation are subjected to regulation at multiple partnerships. Further research into the role of PACT as a modulator of p53 function may lead to new strategies for controlling development and growth of tumors.
