Membrane recruitment of cytohesin family Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors 
depends on interactions with phosphoinositides and active Arf GTPases that, in 
turn, relieve autoinhibition of the catalytic Sec7 domain through an unknown 
structural mechanism. Here, we show that Arf6-GTP relieves autoinhibition by 
binding to an allosteric site that includes the autoinhibitory elements in 
addition to the PH domain. The crystal structure of a cytohesin-3 construct 
encompassing the allosteric site in complex with the head group of phosphatidyl 
inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and N-terminally truncated Arf6-GTP reveals a large 
conformational rearrangement, whereby autoinhibition can be relieved by 
competitive sequestration of the autoinhibitory elements in grooves at the 
Arf6/PH domain interface. Disposition of the known membrane targeting 
determinants on a common surface is compatible with multivalent membrane docking 
and subsequent activation of Arf substrates, suggesting a plausible model 
through which membrane recruitment and allosteric activation could be 
structurally integrated.
