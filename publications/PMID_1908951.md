The number of lymphocytes in an animal is remarkably constant despite 
antigen-driven proliferation and a high rate of B-cell lymphopoiesis. This 
reflects the relatively brief lifespan of many newly generated B cells and 
argues for a well-regulated death mechanism. Even so, a secondary immune 
response can be generated years after a primary exposure to antigen. Antigen 
that might restimulate B cells persists for extended periods on follicular 
dendritic cells in the light zone of germinal centres. Antigen-binding B cells 
have also been found months after the end of obvious cell division. The precise 
signal that enables certain B cells to emerge as long-term surviving memory 
cells is unknown. Bcl-2, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, blocks 
programmed cell death in B cells. We report here that this proto-oncogene 
maintains immune responsiveness. Transgenic mice overproducing Bcl-2 have a 
long-term persistence of immunoglobulin-secreting cells and an extended lifetime 
for memory B cells.
