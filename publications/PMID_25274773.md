Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
neurodegeneration and diabetes mellitus. The gene responsible for the syndrome 
(WFS1) encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein that 
is involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), 
intracellular ion homeostasis, cyclic adenosine monophosphate production and 
regulation of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. In this study, single cell 
Ca(2+) imaging with fura-2 and direct measurements of free cytosolic ATP 
concentration ([ATP]CYT) with adenovirally expressed luciferase confirmed a 
reduced and delayed rise in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]CYT), 
and additionally, diminished [ATP]CYT rises in response to elevated glucose 
concentrations in WFS1-depleted MIN6 cells. We also observed that 
sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) expression was elevated in several 
WFS1-depleted cell models and primary islets. We demonstrated a novel 
interaction between WFS1 and SERCA by co-immunoprecipitation in Cos7 cells and 
with endogenous proteins in human neuroblastoma cells. This interaction was 
reduced when cells were treated with the ER stress inducer dithiothreitol. 
Treatment of WFS1-depleted neuroblastoma cells with the proteasome inhibitor 
MG132 resulted in reduced accumulation of SERCA levels compared with wild-type 
cells. Together these results reveal a role for WFS1 in the negative regulation 
of SERCA and provide further insights into the function of WFS1 in calcium 
homeostasis.
