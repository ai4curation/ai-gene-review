The Axin-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin catalysed by glycogen 
synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is inhibited during embryogenesis. This protects 
beta-catenin against ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, leading to its 
accumulation in the nucleus, where it controls the expression of genes important 
for development. Frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphomas 1 (FRAT1) is 
a mammalian homologue of a GSK3-binding protein (GBP), which appears to play a 
key role in the correct establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis in Xenopus 
laevis. Here, we demonstrate that FRATtide (a peptide corresponding to residues 
188-226 of FRAT1) binds to GSK3 and prevents GSK3 from interacting with Axin. 
FRATtide also blocks the GSK3-catalysed phosphorylation of Axin and 
beta-catenin, suggesting a potential mechanism by which GBP could trigger axis 
formation. In contrast, FRATtide does not suppress GSK3 activity towards other 
substrates, such as glycogen synthase and eIF2B, whose phosphorylation is 
independent of Axin but dependent on a 'priming' phosphorylation. This may 
explain how the essential cellular functions of GSK3 can continue, despite the 
suppression of beta-catenin phosphorylation.
