Arabidopsis displays circadian rhythms in stomatal aperture, stomatal 
conductance, and CO(2) assimilation, each of which peaks around the middle of 
the day. The rhythmic opening and closing of stomata confers a rhythm in 
sensitivity and resistance, respectively, to the toxic gas sulfur dioxide. Using 
this physiological assay as a basis for a mutant screen, we isolated mutants 
with defects in circadian timing. Here, we characterize one mutant, out of phase 
1 (oop1), with the circadian phenotype of altered phase. That is, the timing of 
the peak (acrophase) of multiple circadian rhythms (leaf movement, CO(2) 
assimilation, and LIGHT-HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL a/b-BINDING PROTEIN 
transcription) is early with respect to wild type, although all circadian 
rhythms retain normal period length. This is the first such mutant to be 
characterized in Arabidopsis. oop1 also displays a strong photoperception defect 
in red light characteristic of phytochrome B (phyB) mutants. The oop1 mutation 
is a nonsense mutation of PHYB that results in a truncated protein of 904 amino 
acids. The defect in circadian phasing is seen in seedlings entrained by a 
light-dark cycle but not in seedlings entrained by a temperature cycle. Thus, 
PHYB contributes light information critical for proper determination of 
circadian phase.

Abstract

Arabidopsis displays circadian rhythms in stomatal aperture, stomatal conductance, and CO 2 assimilation, each of which peaks around the middle of the day. The rhythmic opening and closing of stomata confers a rhythm in sensitivity and resistance, respectively, to the toxic gas sulfur dioxide. Using this physiological assay as a basis for a mutant screen, we isolated mutants with defects in circadian timing. Here, we characterize one mutant, out of phase 1 ( oop1 ), with the circadian phenotype of altered phase. That is, the timing of the peak (acrophase) of multiple circadian rhythms (leaf movement, CO 2 assimilation, and LIGHT-HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL a/b-BINDING PROTEIN transcription) is early with respect to wild type, although all circadian rhythms retain normal period length. This is the first such mutant to be characterized in Arabidopsis. oop1 also displays a strong photoperception defect in red light characteristic of phytochrome B ( phyB ) mutants. The oop1 mutation is a nonsense mutation of PHYB that results in a truncated protein of 904 amino acids. The defect in circadian phasing is seen in seedlings entrained by a light-dark cycle but not in seedlings entrained by a temperature cycle. Thus, PHYB contributes light information critical for proper determination of circadian phase.

DISCUSSION

The oop1 phenotype in which the phases but not the periods of multiple rhythms are affected in white light is unusual and may allow insight into the mechanisms of phase determination. oop1 is a new allele of the red-light photoreceptor PHYB gene. This represents the first report of PHYB as a regulator of circadian phase, which adds to its known involvement in controlling the period of the clock in red light ( Somers et al., 1998a ; Devlin and Kay, 2000 , 2001 ). oop1 plants accumulate a truncated form of PHYB that lacks the C-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain ( Yeh and Lagarias, 1998 ), but that retains the two PAS domains, which mediate protein-protein interactions ( Lindebro et al., 1995 ; Ni et al., 1998 ). Elongation of hypocotyls in red light shows that oop1 is a putative null allele of PHYB in red light, which suggests that this truncated PHYB protein is not active. The characterization of phyB-9 , a known null PHYB allele ( Reed et al., 1993 ), shows that loss of PHYB function affects the phase of LHCB::LUC transcription. The similar phase alteration caused by these two phyB mutations suggests that the truncated photoreceptor accumulating in oop1 is not responsible for the circadian phenotype but rather, it is the loss of PHYB signaling that is primarily responsible for changing the phase.

At least three possible mechanisms may explain the phase alteration seen in oop1 and phyB-9 . PHYB signaling could affect light input to the clock. As an alternative, PHYB signaling could directly affect levels of a critical clock component. Finally, PHYB signaling could affect a component of an output pathway acting downstream of the oscillator. Because the period length is unaffected by the oop1 or phyB-9 mutations, we conclude that oscillator function is not affected, and it is unlikely that an oscillator component is the direct target of PHYB signaling. However, our data are inadequate to distinguish between a defect in light input to the clock and light modulation of an output component. It is often difficult to distinguish between input and output pathways based solely on an altered clock parameter like period or phase ( Roenneberg and Merrow, 1998 ; Foster and Lucas, 1999 ; Merrow et al., 1999 ). As noted above, the expression of Arabidopsis PHY and CRY photoreceptor genes oscillates, indicating that the ability to perceive light (a clock input) is modulated by the clock and, hence, is a clock output ( Bognár et al., 1999 ; Tóth et al., 2001 ). However, we do note that because the phase of multiple rhythms (SO 2 resistance, CO 2 assimilation, leaf movement, and LHCB::LUC transcription) is affected in oop1 and phyB-9 mutants, if PHYB affects clock output, then the defect must occur at an output component that is common to all of these output pathways, clock-proximal to any branch points that distinguish these output pathways.

Both light and temperature signaling can entrain the circadian clock ( Somers et al., 1998a ; Devlin and Kay, 2000 , 2001 ). The altered phase in the oop1 mutant is only evident in response to an entraining light-dark cycle and is not detected after entrainment to temperature cycles. Temperature signaling, which is not affected in oop1 plants, apparently compensates for the impairment in red-light signaling and is sufficient for the establishment of proper phase in both oop1 and phyB-9 plants after entrainment by temperature cycles. However, in the temperature cycles used in Figure 7 , the seedlings are grown under continuous light and one might expect that the light signaling defect of oop1 and phyB-9 should be evident as a phase-angle alteration. Nonetheless, under these conditions the phase of LHCB transcription is identical in all genotypes. This argues that the oop1 ( phyB ) defect does not affect parametric entrainment under continuous light but, rather, that PHYB is required to establish the wild-type phase relationship (phase angle) during discrete entrainment to light-dark cycles.

Loss of PHYB signaling would be expected to attenuate light input to the clock. This would reduce the acute induction of a light-induced clock component at dawn (lights on) or, conversely, delay the light-regulated degradation of some critical clock component. In either case, the timing of the acrophase after dawn would be affected. One known target of PHYB signaling is PHY INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3), a bHLH-PAS transcription factor that binds to G-box motifs ( Ni et al., 1998 ). Upon illumination with red light, PHYB relocalizes from the cytoplasm into the nucleus ( Kircher et al., 1999 ; Yamaguchi et al., 1999 ) where it binds directly to PIF3 and modulates transcriptional activity ( Ni et al., 1999 ; Martínez-García et al., 2000 ). Transcription of two known clock components, CCA1 and LHY , is activated by PHYB through PIF3 bound to G-boxes in their promoter regions, and in PIF3 antisense lines, the induction of both CCA1 and LHY is attenuated ( Martínez-García et al., 2000 ). We suggest that the loss of PHYB-mediated induction of CCA1 and LHY at dawn might confer the phase defect seen in oop1 and phyB-9 plants. The mutant phase leads (precedes) the phase seen in wild-type plants, which suggests that the PHYB/PIF3 target should function as a negative clock element. This is consistent with the demonstrated role of CCA1 as a negative regulator of TOC1 transcription ( Alabadí et al., 2001 ). Thus, we suggest that PHYB and PIF3 may constitute an important phase-determination pathway providing input to either the Arabidopsis clock or to a downstream output component. This pathway need not be exclusive to PIF3 signaling and may include one or more of the many PIF3 relatives found in Arabidopsis. PHYA also provides light input through PIF3 to induce CCA1 expression ( Tepperman et al., 2001 ). CCA1 and LHY expression is still detectable to levels close to wild type in oop1 and phyB-9 (data not shown), suggesting that induction of these putative clock components is not exclusively mediated by PHYB. It is interesting to note that both PHYB and PIF3 contain PAS domains, as do the ZTL/LKP2/FKF1 proteins that are implicated in light-regulated protein degradation in the Arabidopsis circadian system ( Kiyosue and Wada, 2000 ; Nelson et al., 2000 ; Somers et al., 2000 ; Schultz et al., 2001 ). The PAS domain features prominently in other clock-associated light input pathways including that of N. crassa , where the WHITE COLLAR proteins and VIVID (VVD) contain PAS domains ( Heintzen et al., 2001 ; Loros and Dunlap, 2001 ; Merrow et al., 2001 ).

Phase mutants have been described in several other clock systems. In fruitfly, two phase-angle ( psi-2 and psi-3 ) mutants dramatically alter the phase of the eclosion rhythm, although the role of these genes in the establishment of phase remains unknown ( Jackson, 1983 ). In N. crassa , mutation of the vvd locus alters the phase of the rhythm in FREQUENCY expression ( Heintzen et al., 2001 ). Deletion of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, camk-1 ,confers both a lagging phase and slight period lengthening in N. crassa ( Yang et al., 2001 ). In cyanobacteria, inactivation of cikA , which encodes a bacteriophytochrome, alters circadian phase but also shortens the period length ( Schmitz et al., 2000 ). Thus, PHYB is analogous to VVD and CikA in playing a role in the determination of both period and phase.

Although the circadian phase defect seen in the oop1 mutant probably reflects simple loss of PHYB signaling, the observed hypocotyl phenotypes of oop1 and other phyB mutants suggests interactions with other light-signaling pathways. Through its PAS domains, PHYB oop1 may be able to interact with at least some PHYB-interacting factors, but would be unable to transduce the light signal to them, because it lacks all of the kinase domain. The enhancement of hypocotyl elongation seen in red plus higher intensities of blue light suggests that PHYB oop1 and PHYB phyB-28 interact with a CRY1 signaling pathway, possibly through the titration of some common interacting protein. Because PHYB oop1 lacks the three nuclear localization sequences shown to be sufficient for nuclear translocation of a GUS::PHYB 898–1172 fusion ( Sakamoto and Nagatani, 1996 ), we predict that these potential interactions are cytosolic. PIF3 is constitutively nuclear ( Ni et al., 1998 ) and is, therefore, unlikely to be a partner for this aberrant PHYB oop1 interaction. ELF3 affects light input to the circadian clock ( McWatters et al., 2000 ) and light-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in both red and blue wavelengths ( Zagotta et al., 1996 ). In addition, ELF3 interacts directly with PHYB ( Liu et al., 2001 ). However, ELF3 is a nuclear protein ( Liu et al., 2001 ), so it is unlikely that PHYB oop1 titrates ELF3. PHY KINASE SUBSTRATE 1 (PKS1) is cytosolic ( Fankhauser et al., 1999 ), but PKS1 overexpressing or antisense lines show no modified sensitivity to blue light, indicating that PKS1 is unlikely to be the relevant target of PHYB oop1 . PKS2 (Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences no. At1g14280), a protein 55% identical to PKS1, is predicted to be cytosolic and might represent such in interactor. As an alternative, PHYB oop1 could physically interact with CRY1. Labeling studies showed a red-light-dependent, far-red-light reversible phosphorylation of CRY1, which could indicate that PHYB may interact with CRY1 in vivo ( Ahmad et al., 1998 ).

It has been clear for some time that PHYB plays multiple important roles in light regulation of multiple developmental processes. The characterization of oop1 , a new allele with a truncation of the carboxy terminus of PHYB, has revealed two previously unknown roles of PHYB: a potential interaction with CRY1-mediated blue-light regulation of hypocotyl elongation, and an important contribution to white-light-mediated phase determination of the circadian clock.
