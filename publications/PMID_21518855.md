Cholera remains an important global cause of morbidity and mortality, capable of 
causing periodic epidemic disease. Beginning in August 2008, a major cholera 
epidemic occurred in Zimbabwe, with 98,585 reported cases and 4,287 deaths. The 
dynamics of such outbreaks, particularly in nonestuarine regions, are not well 
understood. We explored the utility of mathematical models in understanding 
transmission dynamics of cholera and in assessing the magnitude of interventions 
necessary to control epidemic disease. Weekly data on reported cholera cases 
were obtained from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MoHCW) for 
the period from November 13, 2008 to July 31, 2009. A mathematical model was 
formulated and fitted to cumulative cholera cases to estimate the basic 
reproductive numbers R(0) and the partial reproductive numbers from all 10 
provinces for the 2008-2009 Zimbabwe cholera epidemic. Estimated basic 
reproductive numbers were highly heterogeneous, ranging from a low value of just 
above unity to 2.72. Partial reproductive numbers were also highly 
heterogeneous, suggesting that the transmission routes varied by province; 
human-to-human transmission accounted for 41-95% of all transmission. Our models 
suggest that the underlying patterns of cholera transmission varied widely from 
province to province, with a corresponding variation in the amenability of 
outbreaks in different provinces to control measures such as immunization. These 
data underscore the heterogeneity of cholera transmission dynamics, potentially 
linked to differences in environment, socio-economic conditions, and cultural 
practices. The lack of traditional estuarine reservoirs combined with these 
estimates of R(0) suggest that mass vaccination against cholera deployed 
strategically in Zimbabwe and surrounding regions could prevent future cholera 
epidemics and eventually eliminate cholera from the region.
