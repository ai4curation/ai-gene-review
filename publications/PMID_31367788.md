Thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and NADPH are key members of 
the Trx system that is involved in redox regulation and antioxidant defense. In 
recent years, several researchers have provided information about the roles of 
the Trx system in cancer development and progression. These reports indicated 
that many tumor cells express high levels of Trx and TrxR, which can be 
responsible for drug resistance in tumorigenesis. Inhibition of the Trx system 
may thus contribute to cancer therapy and improving chemotherapeutic agents. 
There are now a number of effective natural and synthetic inhibitors with 
chemotherapy applications possessing antitumor activity ranging from oxidative 
stress induction to apoptosis. In this article, we first described the features 
and functions of the Trx system and then reviewed briefly its correlations with 
cancer. Finally, we summarized the present knowledge about the Trx/TrxR 
inhibitors as anticancer drugs.
