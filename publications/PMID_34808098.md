Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen that causes seasonal epidemics 
with significant mortality. One of the most abundant proteins in IAV particles 
is the matrix protein 1 (M1), which is essential for the virus structural 
stability. M1 organizes virion assembly and budding at the plasma membrane (PM), 
where it interacts with other viral components. The recruitment of M1 to the PM 
as well as its interaction with the other viral envelope proteins (hemagglutinin 
[HA], neuraminidase, matrix protein 2 [M2]) is controversially discussed in 
previous studies. Therefore, we used fluorescence fluctuation microscopy 
techniques (i.e., scanning fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy and 
number and brightness) to quantify the oligomeric state of M1 and its 
interactions with other viral proteins in co-transfected as well as infected 
cells. Our results indicate that M1 is recruited to the PM by M2, as a 
consequence of the strong interaction between the two proteins. In contrast, 
only a weak interaction between M1 and HA was observed. M1-HA interaction 
occurred only in the event that M1 was already bound to the PM. We therefore 
conclude that M2 initiates the assembly of IAV by recruiting M1 to the PM, 
possibly allowing its further interaction with other viral proteins.

We therefore conclude that M2 initiates the assembly of IAV by recruiting M1 to the PM, possibly allowing its further interaction with other viral proteins.

Introduction

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) belong to the family of the Orthomyxoviridae. These pathogens represent a substantial global health burden, being associated with significant morbidity and mortality through frequent epidemics and several pandemics ( 1 , 2 ). IAV is enveloped by a lipid bilayer that is derived from the host cell membrane and contains two integral transmembrane glycoproteins (i.e., hemagglutinin [HA] and neuraminidase [NA]) and one transmembrane protein with a proton-selective ion channel activity (i.e., the matrix protein 2 [M2]) ( 3 , 4 ). The envelope protein HA is a homotrimeric type I transmembrane glycoprotein and is the major surface protein of IAV particles ( 5 , 6 , 7 ). HA plays a major role in viral entry by mediating the attachment of the virus to cell surface sialic acid molecules, membrane fusion after internalization, and the release of viral genome into target cells ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ). The surface protein NA is a homotetrameric type II transmembrane glycoprotein that facilitates the release of newly synthesized virus particles from the infected cells by enzymatic cleavage of the cell surface receptor molecules ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ). Additionally, a small amount of homotetrameric M2 molecules are embedded in the viral envelope (approximately 16–20 molecules in a virus, compared with circa [ca.] 300–400 HA and 50 NA copies) ( 6 , 7 ). M2 is a type III transmembrane protein that functions as proton channel activated by acidic pH and is important for genome unpacking during virus entry ( 7 , 8 , 9 ). Moreover, it was shown that M2 is connected to virus morphology, production of infectious virus particles, and membrane scission ( 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ). All the three envelope proteins are transported from the trans -Golgi network to the apical plasma membrane (PM) via the secretory pathway ( 8 , 9 , 14 ). Both glycoproteins, HA and NA, are supposed to be enriched in lipid “raft” microdomains at the virion budding site, whereas M2 was suggested to localize to the edges of such domains ( 8 , 14 , 15 , 16 ).

The luminal side of the viral envelope is coated with the matrix protein 1 (M1), which forms the viral nucleocapsid in close contact with the lipid membrane ( 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ), binds the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) ( 4 , 21 ), and is supposed to interact with viral surface proteins ( 10 , 11 , 22 , 23 , 24 ). Moreover, M1 is the most abundant, highly conserved protein in IAV particles and is important for several processes during viral replication, including the regulation of capsid disassembly, virus budding, and morphogenesis ( 3 , 8 , 25 ). Interestingly, M1 lacks an apical transport signal, implying that the membrane localization of M1 in infected cells might be due to piggyback transport with HA, NA, M2, or vRNPs ( 26 , 27 ). For this reason, various hypotheses regarding the association of M1 to the PM have been proposed over the years. First, several studies established that M1 associates with negatively charged lipids in model membranes ( 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 28 , 29 ). Nevertheless, such interactions appear not to be sufficient for the actual association of M1 to the PM in non-infected cells (i.e., in cells expressing M1 as the only viral protein) ( 17 , 27 ). Accordingly, M1 was proposed to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA during their apical transport ( 22 , 23 , 24 , 30 , 31 ), as well as with the cytoplasmic tails of M2 at the assembly site ( 10 , 11 , 27 ). Interactions between M1 and HA, NA, or M2 have been investigated via bulk biochemistry methods (e.g., by altered detergent solubility ( 22 , 24 ), increased membrane association ( 31 ) of M1 in the presence of HA or NA, or co-immunoprecipitation of M1 in the presence of M2 ( 10 , 11 , 32 )). Nevertheless, no clear consensus has been reached regarding the role of HA, NA, or M2 in recruiting M1 to the PM and its subsequent incorporation into virions ( 11 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ). In conclusion, the molecular mechanisms involved in M1-driven IAV assembly are not fully understood and the specific interactions between M1 and other viral surface proteins have not yet been quantified directly in living cells.

To obtain quantitative information on how protein-protein interactions (e.g., M1-M1 or M1-HA) occur in the native cellular environment, minimally invasive approaches (e.g., fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy) are needed ( 38 ). Here, we apply number and brightness (N&B) and cross-correlation N&B (ccN&B) as well as scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (sFCS) and scanning fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (sFCCS) analysis in living cells to quantify oligomeric state, concentration, and diffusion dynamics of the viral envelope proteins (HA, NA, M2) and M1, as well as their interactions. Our results suggest the presence of a strong interaction between M1 and M2, leading to the recruitment of M1 to the PM in an M2 concentration-dependent manner. We further hypothesize that the interaction between M1 and HA occurs in a subsequent step. Finally, we provide the first experimental evidence of a possible M2-binding site within the N-terminal domain of M1.

Discussion

The role of M1 in IAV assembly is of fundamental importance, as it is now understood that this protein connects together the viral envelope, its membrane proteins (HA, NA, and M2), and the genome ( 61 ). It has been suggested that interactions of M1 with the viral glycoproteins (e.g., HA) drive M1 localization to the PM of infected cells ( 10 , 11 , 22 , 23 , 24 ), but other studies reported conflicting data regarding the interaction of M1 with HA and NA ( 30 , 31 , 35 , 36 ). Such findings are mostly based on biochemistry approaches providing indirect interaction data ( 7 , 62 ).

Therefore, in order to quantify protein-protein interactions directly at the PM of living cells, we performed fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy experiments under physiological conditions. Such experimental approaches (i.e., sF(C)CS and (cc)N&B) provide information regarding the oligomeric state, surface concentration, hetero-interactions, and dynamics in complex biological systems ( 51 , 52 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 ).

To this aim, we selected HEK293T cells as a cellular model because they are often used for reverse genetic virus production ( 39 , 40 , 67 ) and were shown to be appropriate for IAV protein expression ( 17 , 41 , 42 ). Additionally, we produced and tested several fluorescent IAV protein constructs. Of note, the fluorescent NA construct designed in this study allowed for the first time the investigation of the interaction between this IAV glycoprotein and other viral proteins directly in living cells. It is worth noting that incorporating fluorescent fusion tags might have an impact in general on the localization, function, and conformation of the protein of interest ( 68 , 69 ). For example, our control experiments showed that the cellular distribution of M1 with an mEGFP fused to its C terminus was similar to that of unlabeled M1 ( 46 , 47 ), whereas an N-terminally fused mEGFP M1 variant seemed to have transport failures, which are probably caused by steric hindrance between fluorophore and signal peptide ( 47 ). On the other hand, the fluorescent constructs used to investigate the viral envelope proteins (HA, NA, and M2) were all localized at the PM, similar to the corresponding non-fluorescent proteins ( 48 , 49 ), and yielded the expected oligomerization state ( 41 , 42 , 53 , 54 ). For example, our results are compatible with the presence of NA tetramers and mixtures of M2 dimers and tetramers ( Fig. 3 C ), in agreement with previous data ( 55 , 70 ). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the protein-protein interactions investigated here (e.g., between M1-mEGFP and mCherry2-M2) are specific and analogous to those observed in other contexts ( 10 ), as shown by mutagenesis experiments ( Fig. 5 D ) and using unlabeled interaction partners ( Fig. S1 ).

In order to identify the minimum requirement for M1 association to the PM, we observed cells expressing different combinations of viral proteins. First, we confirmed that M1 does not bind to the PM in the absence of other viral proteins, despite the strong lipid-protein interactions previously observed in model membrane systems ( 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ). Surprisingly, we did not observe any recruitment of M1 to the PM in the presence of HA or NA ( Fig. 1 ). It is worth noting that several studies proposed that M1 interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of HA or NA ( 23 , 30 , 71 , 72 , 73 , 74 ), but our direct observations in living cells strongly suggest that the two IAV glycoproteins are not able to recruit M1 to the PM by themselves. It is unlikely that the lack of interaction might be a simple consequence of the presence of fluorescent labels, since HA and NA are labeled at the extracellular side. Also, the same M1-mEGFP strongly associates with the PM in the presence of M2. This result is in agreement with previous studies indicating that M1-M2 interactions affect M1 localization and drive virus assembly ( 10 , 11 , 27 , 75 , 76 ). For the first time, we could provide direct experimental evidence that the M2-binding region is located within the first 67 aa of M1 ( Fig. 5 ). Also, thanks to the application of quantitative fluorescence microscopy methods, we could additionally prove that M1 and M2 do not simply colocalize at the PM but rather form complexes. This conclusion is supported by the similar diffusion dynamics observed for M1 and M2 (i.e., diffusion coefficients typical of transmembrane proteins rather than membrane-associated proteins; Fig. 3 H ) and by the significant degree of cross-correlation between the signals of the two proteins ( Fig. 3 G ). Due to the lack of strong intracellular colocalization ( Figs. 1 C and 5 C ), we hypothesize that M1 diffuses freely in the cytoplasm and M1-M2 interaction occurs directly at the PM. M1-M2 complexes appear to consist, on average, of one or two M1 and two to four M2 molecules ( Fig. 3 ). Assuming that each M2 monomer has a binding site for M1, the observed 1:2 stoichiometry suggests that the M1 binding might be limited, for example, by steric constraints or competition with other binding partners of M2 (e.g., LC3 ( 42 )). Furthermore, in the simple approximation of M1 dimers, M2 tetramers, and 2:4 M1-M2 complexes being associated with the PM, our cross-correlation measurements indicate that ca. 80% of M1 is indeed complexed to M2. The remaining amount of PM-associated M1 might interact with, e.g., acidic lipids at the PM ( 19 , 20 ), but, of note, we never observed any significant degree of M1 localization at the PM in the absence of M2. This finding puts forward the hypothesis that M2-M1 complex formation might facilitate the interaction of M1 with other membrane components. This mechanism might also explain previous findings indicating the presence of HA and M1 in the same membrane fractions ( 22 , 23 ) or within the same region in the PM ( 15 ). Accordingly, we have observed that, in the presence of M2 (i.e., M1 being efficiently recruited to the PM), there is a significant (although modest) interaction between M1 and the glycoproteins HA or NA ( Fig. 3 G ). On one hand, it is possible that, e.g., M1-HA interactions are not direct but, rather, mediated by M2 ( 15 ). Alternatively, it is possible that, while M2 is needed for the initial recruitment of M1 to the PM, M1-M2 interactions are not long lived and can be partially replaced, for example, by M1-HA interactions. In this case, M2 might induce interactions between M1 and other membrane components by, e.g., increasing M1 local concentration in specific PM regions or stabilizing a certain geometric configuration of M1. However, based on control experiments monitoring M1-HA/NA interactions as a function of local protein concentration ( Fig. S11 ), a prominent role of concentration seems unlikely. To evaluate whether M2 is strictly needed for HA-M1 interactions, we performed sFCCS experiments in which M1 was artificially anchored to the PM ( Fig. 4 ). In this case, depending on the specific lipid anchor, we were also able to observe M1-HA interactions in the absence of M2, thus indicating that (1) the latter protein is not always required as a bridge between M1 and IAV glycoproteins, and (2) the lipid environment plays a role in the establishment of interactions among IAV proteins. Of interest, it was shown that HA is associated with specific lipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) ( 14 , 49 ) and this observation might provide a molecular mechanism explaining our observation of non-negligible M1-HA interactions, in the event that M1 was artificially anchored to the membrane via lipidation and, additionally, a polybasic motif. The degree of association between HA and mp-KrΦ-M1-mEGFP appeared to be between that observed for wild-type M1 and that observed for mp-M1-mEGFP, as supported by the observation of intermediate cross-correlation values ( Fig. 4 C ) and diffusion dynamics ( Fig. 4 D ).

The observation that one single IAV membrane protein (i.e., M2) is sufficient for the recruitment of M1 to the PM prompted us to investigate whether M1-M2 interaction is also sufficient for the initiation of the large-scale M1 multimerization associated with IAV assembly ( 17 ). Our experiments clearly demonstrate that this is not the case, since M1 remains, on average, mostly dimeric when bound to the PM in the presence of M2 ( Fig. 2 C ). On the other hand, in the presence of all the other viral proteins, M1 formed larger multimers (up to 5–10 monomers). This effect does not seem to be a direct consequence of the presence of HA or NA alone ( Fig. 3 B ) and is even stronger in infected cells. It is worth noting that the formation of very large multimers of M1-mEGFP in infected cells might be partially due to (1) higher M1 concentrations at the PM or (2) the presence of unlabeled M1 molecules that more efficiently support protein-protein interactions. It was in fact reported that fluorescent viral proteins might not be able to oligomerize on a very large scale ( 65 ). Alternatively, other viral proteins or altered lipid metabolism (and, consequently, modification of PM composition) in infected cells might play a role, and these possibilities are currently under investigation.

In conclusion, our study sheds light on the very first steps in IAV assembly. According to our results, the main role of M2 in this context is to recruit M1 to specific regions of the PM. This is in agreement with previously proposed models according to which M2 chaperones M1 to the PM ( 77 ) and, specifically, to interface regions between raft and non-raft domains ( 14 , 16 ) or domains enriched in negatively charged lipids ( 17 ). In further steps, M1 can then interact with lipids and other viral proteins, and such interactions might be involved in the formation of larger protein complexes, eventually leading to IAV capsid assembly.
