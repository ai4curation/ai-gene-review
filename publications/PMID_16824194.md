The assembly of the prereplicative complex (pre-RC) at the origin of replication 
in eukaryotes is a highly regulated and highly conserved process that plays a 
critical role in preventing multiple rounds of DNA replication per cell division 
cycle. This study analyzes the molecular dynamics of the assembly of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae pre-RC in vitro using ARS1 plasmid DNA and yeast whole 
cell extracts. In addition, pre-RC assembly was reconstituted in vitro using 
ARS1 DNA and purified origin-recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6p and Cdt1p-Mcm2-7p. 
The results reveal sequential recruitment of ORC, Cdc6p, Cdt1p and Mcm2-7p on to 
ARS1 DNA. When Mcm2-7p is maximally loaded, Cdc6p and Cdt1p are released, 
suggesting that these two proteins are co-ordinately regulated during pre-RC 
assembly. In extracts from sid2-21 mutant cells that are deficient in CDT1, ORC 
and Cdc6p bind to ARS1 but Cdt1p and Mcm2-7p do not. However, Mcm2-7p does bind 
in the presence of exogenous Cdt1p or Cdt1p-Mcm2-7p complex. Cdt1p-Mcm2-7p 
complex, which was purified from G1-, early S or G2/M-arrested cells, exhibits 
structure-specific DNA binding, interacting only with bubble- or Y-shape-DNA, 
but the biological significance of this observation is not yet known.
