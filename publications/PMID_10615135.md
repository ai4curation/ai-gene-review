The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is responsible for cytosine methylation in 
mammals and has a role in gene silencing. DNA methylation represses genes partly 
by recruitment of the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2, which in turn recruits a 
histone deacetylase activity. Here we show that Dnmt1 is itself associated with 
histone deacetylase activity in vivo. Consistent with this association, we find 
that one of the known histone deacetylases, HDAC1, has the ability to bind Dnmt1 
and can purify methyltransferase activity from nuclear extracts. We have 
identified a transcriptional repression domain in Dnmt1 that functions, at least 
partly, by recruiting histone deacetylase activity and shows homology to the 
repressor domain of the trithorax-related protein HRX (also known as MLL and 
ALL-1). Our data show a more direct connection between DNA methylation and 
histone deacetylation than was previously considered. We suggest that the 
process of DNA methylation, mediated by Dnmt1, may depend on or generate an 
altered chromatin state via histone deacetylase activity.
