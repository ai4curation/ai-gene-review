The kinase domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 3/ErbB3, a 
member of the EGF receptor (EGFR) family, lacks several residues that are 
critical for catalysis. Because catalytic activity in EGFR family members is 
switched on by an allosteric interaction between kinase domains in an asymmetric 
kinase domain dimer, HER3 might be specialized to serve as an activator of other 
EGFR family members. We have determined the crystal structure of the HER3 kinase 
domain and show that it appears to be locked into an inactive conformation that 
resembles that of EGFR and HER4. Although the crystal structure shows that the 
HER3 kinase domain binds ATP, we confirm that it is catalytically inactive but 
can serve as an activator of the EGFR kinase domain. The HER3 kinase domain 
forms a dimer in the crystal, mediated by hydrophobic contacts between the 
N-terminal lobes of the kinase domains. This N-lobe dimer closely resembles a 
dimer formed by inactive HER4 kinase domains in crystal structures determined 
previously, and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the HER3 and HER4 
N-lobe dimers are stable. The kinase domains of HER3 and HER4 form similar 
chains in their respective crystal lattices, in which N-lobe dimers are linked 
together by reciprocal exchange of C-terminal tails. The conservation of this 
tiling pattern in HER3 and HER4, which is the closest evolutionary homolog of 
HER3, might represent a general mechanism by which this branch of the HER 
receptors restricts ligand-independent formation of active heterodimers with 
other members of the EGFR family.

Abstract

The kinase domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 3/ErbB3, a member of the EGF receptor (EGFR) family, lacks several residues that are critical for catalysis. Because catalytic activity in EGFR family members is switched on by an allosteric interaction between kinase domains in an asymmetric kinase domain dimer, HER3 might be specialized to serve as an activator of other EGFR family members. We have determined the crystal structure of the HER3 kinase domain and show that it appears to be locked into an inactive conformation that resembles that of EGFR and HER4. Although the crystal structure shows that the HER3 kinase domain binds ATP, we confirm that it is catalytically inactive but can serve as an activator of the EGFR kinase domain. The HER3 kinase domain forms a dimer in the crystal, mediated by hydrophobic contacts between the N-terminal lobes of the kinase domains. This N-lobe dimer closely resembles a dimer formed by inactive HER4 kinase domains in crystal structures determined previously, and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the HER3 and HER4 N-lobe dimers are stable. The kinase domains of HER3 and HER4 form similar chains in their respective crystal lattices, in which N-lobe dimers are linked together by reciprocal exchange of C-terminal tails. The conservation of this tiling pattern in HER3 and HER4, which is the closest evolutionary homolog of HER3, might represent a general mechanism by which this branch of the HER receptors restricts ligand-independent formation of active heterodimers with other members of the EGFR family.
