Normal human cells undergo a finite number of cell divisions and ultimately 
enter a nondividing state called replicative senescence. It has been proposed 
that telomere shortening is the molecular clock that triggers senescence. To 
test this hypothesis, two telomerase-negative normal human cell types, retinal 
pigment epithelial cells and foreskin fibroblasts, were transfected with vectors 
encoding the human telomerase catalytic subunit. In contrast to 
telomerase-negative control clones, which exhibited telomere shortening and 
senescence, telomerase-expressing clones had elongated telomeres, divided 
vigorously, and showed reduced straining for beta-galactosidase, a biomarker for 
senescence. Notably, the telomerase-expressing clones have a normal karyotype 
and have already exceeded their normal life-span by at least 20 doublings, thus 
establishing a causal relationship between telomere shortening and in vitro 
cellular senescence. The ability to maintain normal human cells in a 
phenotypically youthful state could have important applications in research and 
medicine.
