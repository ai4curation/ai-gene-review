The RING family zinc-finger protein topors (topoisomerase I-binding protein) 
binds not only topoisomerase I, but also p53 and the AAV-2 Rep78/68 proteins. 
topors maps to human chromosome 9p21, which contains candidate tumor suppressor 
genes implicated in small cell lung cancers. In this study, we isolated the 
murine counterpart of topors and investigated its impact on p53 function. The 
deduced amino-acid sequence of mouse topors exhibits extensive similarity to 
human topors. Overexpressed myc-tagged topors associates with and stabilizes 
p53, and enhances the p53-dependent transcriptional activities of p21(Waf1), 
MDM2 and Bax promoters and elevates endogenous p21(Waf1) mRNA levels. 
Overexpression of topors consequently results in the suppression of cell growth 
by cell cycle arrest and/or by the induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these 
studies identify topors as a positive regulator of p53. The expression of topors 
is induced by exposure to the genotoxic reagents cisplatin and camptothecin, a 
DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. We therefore postulate that topors mediates 
p53-dependent cellular responses induced by DNA damage, suggesting its 
physiological role as a tumor suppressor.
