Multiple cytosolic innate sensors form large signalosomes after activation, but 
this assembly needs to be tightly regulated to avoid accumulation of misfolded 
aggregates. We found that the eIF2α kinase heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) 
controls NOD1 signalosome folding and activation through a process requiring 
eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), the transcription factor ATF4, and the 
heat shock protein HSPB8. The HRI/eIF2α signaling axis was also essential for 
signaling downstream of the innate immune mediators NOD2, MAVS, and TRIF but 
dispensable for pathways dependent on MyD88 or STING. Moreover, filament-forming 
α-synuclein activated HRI-dependent responses, which suggests that the HRI 
pathway may restrict toxic oligomer formation. We propose that HRI, eIF2α, and 
HSPB8 define a novel cytosolic unfolded protein response (cUPR) essential for 
optimal innate immune signaling by large molecular platforms, functionally 
homologous to the PERK/eIF2α/HSPA5 axis of the endoplasmic reticulum UPR.
