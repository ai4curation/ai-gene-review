The mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC) is a multifunctional gene showing loss of 
expression in colorectal and liver cancers. MCC mutations can drive colon 
carcinogenesis in the mouse and in vitro experiments suggest that loss of MCC 
function promotes cancer through several important cellular pathways. In 
particular, the MCC protein is known to regulate beta-catenin (β-cat) signaling, 
but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that the β-cat repressor 
function of MCC is strongly impaired by the presence of a disease-associated 
mutation. We also identify deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) as a new MCC 
interacting partner and regulator of β-cat signaling. RNA interference 
experiments show that DBC1 promotes β-cat transcriptional activity and that the 
presence of DBC1 is required for MCC-mediated β-cat repression. In contrast to 
all other DBC1 interacting partners, MCC does not interact through the DBC1 
Leucine Zipper domain but with a glutamic-acid rich region located between the 
Nudix and EF-hand domains. Furthermore, MCC overexpression relocalizes DBC1 from 
the nucleus to the cytoplasm and reduces β-cat K49 acetylation. Treatment of 
cells with the SIRT1 inhibitor Nicotinamide reverses MCC-induced deacetylation 
of β-cat K49. These data suggest that the cytoplasmic MCC-DBC1 interaction 
sequesters DBC1 away from the nucleus, thereby removing a brake on DBC1 nuclear 
targets, such as SIRT1. This study provides new mechanistic insights into the 
DBC1-MCC axis as a new APC independent β-cat inhibitory pathway.
