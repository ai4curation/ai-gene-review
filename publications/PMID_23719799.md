The tetra(ethylene glycol) derivative of benzothiazole aniline, BTA-EG4, is a 
novel amyloid-binding small molecule that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier 
and protect cells from Aβ-induced toxicity. However, the effects of Aβ-targeting 
molecules on other cellular processes, including those that modulate synaptic 
plasticity, remain unknown. We report here that BTA-EG4 decreases Aβ levels, 
alters cell surface expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and improves 
memory in wild-type mice. Interestingly, the BTA-EG4-mediated behavioral 
improvement is not correlated with LTP, but with increased spinogenesis. The 
higher dendritic spine density reflects an increase in the number of functional 
synapses as determined by increased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency without 
changes in presynaptic parameters or postsynaptic mEPSC amplitude. Additionally, 
BTA-EG4 requires APP to regulate dendritic spine density through a Ras 
signaling-dependent mechanism. Thus, BTA-EG4 may provide broad therapeutic 
benefits for improving neuronal and cognitive function, and may have 
implications in neurodegenerative disease therapy.
