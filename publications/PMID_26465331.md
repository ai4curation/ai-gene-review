Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs) are molecular chaperones that transiently 
interact with other proteins, thereby assisting with quality control of proper 
protein folding and/or degradation. They are also recruited to protect cells 
from a variety of stresses in response to extreme heat, heavy metals, and 
oxidative-reductive stress. Although ten human sHSPs have been identified, their 
likely diverse biological functions remain an enigma in health and disease, and 
much less is known about non-redundant roles in selective cells and tissues. 
Herein, we set out to comprehensively characterize the cardiac-restricted Heat 
Shock Protein B-2 (HspB2), which exhibited ischemic cardioprotection in 
transgenic overexpressing mice including reduced infarct size and maintenance of 
ATP levels. Global yeast two-hybrid analysis using HspB2 (bait) and a human 
cardiac library (prey) coupled with co-immunoprecipitation studies for 
mitochondrial target validation revealed the first HspB2 "cardiac interactome" 
to contain many myofibril and mitochondrial-binding partners consistent with the 
overexpression phenotype. This interactome has been submitted to the Biological 
General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID). A related sHSP chaperone 
HspB5 had only partially overlapping binding partners, supporting specificity of 
the interactome as well as non-redundant roles reported for these sHSPs. 
Evidence that the cardiac yeast two-hybrid HspB2 interactome targets resident 
mitochondrial client proteins is consistent with the role of HspB2 in 
maintaining ATP levels and suggests new chaperone-dependent functions for 
metabolic homeostasis. One of the HspB2 targets, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), has reported roles in HspB2 associated phenotypes 
including cardiac ATP production, mitochondrial function, and apoptosis, and was 
validated as a potential client protein of HspB2 through chaperone assays. From 
the clientele and phenotypes identified herein, it is tempting to speculate that 
small molecule activators of HspB2 might be deployed to mitigate mitochondrial 
related diseases such as cardiomyopathy and neurodegenerative disease.
