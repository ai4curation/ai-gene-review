Distinct penicillin binding proteins involved in the division, elongation, and 
shape of Escherichia coli K12.

Spratt BG.

The varied effects of beta-lactam antibiotics on cell division, cell elongation, 
and cell shape in E. coli are shown to be due to the presence of three essential 
penicillin binding proteins with distinct roles in these three processes. (A) 
Cell shape: beta-Lactams that specifically result in the production of ovoid 
cells bind to penicillin binding protein 2 (molecular weight 66,000). A mutant 
has been isolated that fails to bind beta-lactams to protein 2, and that grows 
as round cells. (B) Cell division: beta-Lactams that specifically inhibit cell 
division bind preferentially to penicillin binding protein 3 (molecular weight 
60,000). A temperature-sensitive cell division mutant has been shown to have a 
thermolabile protein 3. (C) Cell elongation: One beta-lactam that preferentially 
inhibits cell elongation and causes cell lysis binds preferentially to binding 
protein 1 (molecular weight 91,000). Evidence is presented that penicillin bulge 
formation is due to the inhibition of proteins 2 and 3 in the absence of 
inhibition of protein 1.
