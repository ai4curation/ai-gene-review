Tracheal agenesis/atresia (TA) is a rare but fatal congenital disease in which 
the breathing tube fails to grow. The etiology of this serious condition remains 
largely unknown. We found that Bmp signaling is prominently present in the 
anterior foregut where the tracheal primordium originates and targeted ablation 
of Bmp4 (Bmp4(cko)) resulted in a loss-of-trachea phenotype that closely 
resembles the Floyd type II pathology, the most common form of TA in humans. In 
Bmp4(cko) embryos, tracheal specification was not affected; however, its 
outgrowth was severely impaired due to reduced epithelial and mesenchymal 
proliferation. In agreement, we also observed significant reduction in the 
expression of Cyclin D1, a key cell cycle regulator associated with cellular 
proliferation. However, the proliferative effect of Bmp signaling appears to be 
independent of Wnt signaling. Interestingly, we found significantly reduced 
expression of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) in the 
Bmp4(cko) ventral foregut, suggesting that Bmp signaling promotes Erk 
phosphorylation which has been associated with cellular proliferation. This 
study provides the first evidence linking Bmp signaling to tracheal formation by 
regulating the proliferative response of the anterior ventral foregut. Our 
finding sheds light on human tracheal malformations by providing a novel mouse 
model implicating Bmp signaling, non-canonical Erk activation and cellular 
proliferation.

Abstract

Tracheal agenesis/atresia (TA) is a rare but fatal congenital disease in which the breathing tube fails to grow. The etiology of this serious condition remains largely unknown. We found that Bmp signaling is prominently present in the anterior foregut where the tracheal primordium originates and targeted ablation of Bmp4 ( Bmp4 cko ) resulted in a loss-of-trachea phenotype that closely resembles the Floyd type II pathology, the most common form of TA in humans. In Bmp4 cko embryos, tracheal specification was not affected, however, its outgrowth was severely impaired due to reduced epithelial and mesenchymal proliferation. In agreement, we also observed significant reduction in the expression of Cyclin D1, a key cell cycle regulator associated with cellular proliferation. However, the proliferative effect of Bmp signaling appears to be independent of Wnt signaling. Interestingly, we found significantly reduced expression of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) in the Bmp4 cko ventral foregut, suggesting that Bmp signaling promotes Erk phosphorylation which has been associated with cellular proliferation. This study provides the first evidence linking Bmp signaling to tracheal formation by regulating the proliferative response of the anterior ventral foregut. Our finding sheds light on human tracheal malformations by providing a novel mouse model implicating Bmp signaling, non-canonical Erk activation and cellular proliferation.

INTRODUCTION

The trachea/lung and esophagus, respiratory and digestive organs respectively, originate from a common foregut endodermal tube surrounded by splanchnic mesoderm. Ventral outpocketing of the respiratory primordium from the anterior foregut endoderm, clearly discernible at E9.5 in the mouse embryo, gives rise to the tracheal diverticulum with a pair of lung buds at its distal end while the dorsal foregut domain develops into the esophagus ( Cardoso and Lu, 2006 ; Shannon and Hyatt, 2004 ; Warburton et al., 2000 ). Defective development of these organs results in congenital malformations in humans such as esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) and a spectrum of tracheal defects known as tracheal agenesis or atresia (TA).

TA has been diagnosed in neonates with cyanosis and severe respiratory distress and at an incidence of less than 1 in 50,000 births, TA is considered a rare congenital malformation but uniformly fatal ( Felix et al., 2006 ; Manschot et al., 1994 ; van Veenendaal et al., 2000 ). It is often associated with a wide variety of other congenital anomalies of the heart, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, pulmonary and central nervous system but specific etiologies have not been identified ( Evans et al., 1999 ; Faro et al., 1979 ; Kerschner and Klotch, 1997 ; Lander et al., 2004 ; Saleeby et al., 2003 ; Sparey et al., 2000 ; Wei et al., 2003 ). The Floyd anatomical classification describes three types of TA ( Fig. 1A ). In Type I, there is atresia of part of the trachea with a normal but short distal trachea, normal bronchi and tracheoesophageal fistula. In Type II, the most common type in humans reported at around 60% of TA cases, there is complete tracheal agenesis but with normal bifurcation and bronchi. Type III has no trachea and the bronchi arise directly from the esophagus ( Diaz et al., 1989 ; Faro et al., 1979 ; Floyd et al., 1962 ; Fraser et al., 2005 ; Heimann et al., 2007 ; Manschot et al., 1994 ; van Veenendaal et al., 2000 ; Wei et al., 2003 ).

Elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of foregut anomalies will add significantly to our progress in understanding these congenital malformations of unknown etiology. Recent studies by us and others have elucidated a key role of Bmp signaling in the generation of EA/TEF ( Li et al., 2007 ; Que et al., 2006 ). Therefore, we asked whether Bmp signaling could also have a critical role in tracheal morphogenesis. We found that the distribution of phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8 (p-Smad1), indicative of Bmp signaling, is restricted to the ventral foregut endoderm and mesenchyme (this work). In agreement, a previous study has shown that Bmp4 is expressed in the ventral foregut mesenchyme surrounding the lung primordium and the future trachea ( Weaver et al., 1999 ). These observations raised the possibility that Bmp signaling may be important in tracheal morphogenesis.

During development of the foregut tube, inductive signals emanating from the ventral foregut mesoderm, such as Bmps, are thought to pattern the underlying foregut endoderm resulting in outgrowth of primitive buds that give rise to structures such as the lung, liver and ventral rudiment of the pancreas during an active period of organogenesis ( Hogan, 1996 ; Rossi et al., 2001 ; Zaret, 2002 ). Bmp 2, 4 and 7 are by far the most studied members of the Bmp family. Signaling by Bmps is mediated by a receptor complex consisting of type 1 (Bmpr-1a/Alk3, Bmpr-1b/Alk6) and type 2 (Bmpr2) transmembrane receptor serine-threonine kinases. Type 1 receptors for Bmps phosphorylate downstream targets, Smad1/5/8, which then form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 followed by translocation to the nucleus where they bind cis elements associated with specific gene expressions which regulate diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, growth arrest or cell migration ( Aubin et al., 2004 ; Chen et al., 2004 ; Kishigami and Mishina, 2005 ; Massague, 2000 ; Mishina, 2003 ). Besides Smad-mediated transcription, Bmp-induced receptor complex can also activate p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway to modulate apoptosis ( Kendall et al., 2005 ; Kimura et al., 2000 ; Moustakas and Heldin, 2005 ). Several reports also indicate activation of Ras and ERK (Extracellular-Signal Regulated Kinase, i.e. p44/42 MAPK) by Bmps under physiological and pathological conditions ( Haynes et al., 2007 ; Moustakas and Heldin, 2005 ; Zhou et al., 2007 ).

In this study, we address the role of Bmp4 signaling in tracheal morphogenesis, by conditionally ablating Bmp4 using Foxg1Cre ( Bmp4 cko ) since early embryonic lethality of Bmp4 null mutants precludes analysis of Bmp function at a stage when the trachea begins to develop ( Fujiwara et al., 2002 ; Fujiwara et al., 2001 ; Lawson et al., 1999 ). We found that Bmp signaling is essential to tracheal formation and the Bmp4 cko foregut displayed loss of trachea resembling the Floyd type II pathology.

DISCUSSION

Tracheal atresia/agenesis (TA) is a rare but fatal foregut anomaly of unknown etiology ( Diaz et al., 1989 ; Kerschner and Klotch, 1997 ; Manschot et al., 1994 ). We found that mouse embryos with conditional ablation of Bmp4 in the ventral foregut domain by a Foxg1Cre transgene displayed TA with a fistula between the esophagus and carina which divides to form the bronchi. Therefore, this study reveals a critical role of Bmp signaling in tracheal morphogenesis. Further analysis of Bmp4 cko embryos indicated that respiratory specification was unaffected based on Nkx2.1 expression. Therefore, Bmp4 is not required for the initial specification of the respiratory bud; rather, it plays a vital role in tracheal outgrowth and elongation which was severely impaired. This finding is consistent with significantly reduced tracheal epithelial and mesenchymal proliferation indicative of impaired G1-S cell cycle progression but without significant alteration in cell death. Bmp signaling is involved in epithelial growth and tissue morphogenesis of the lung and kidney ( Cardoso and Lu, 2006 ; Eblaghie et al., 2006 ; Miyazaki et al., 2000 ). This finding contrasts with the role of Bmp signaling in liver development, where it appears to be essential for both initial hepatic fate specification and subsequent outgrowth of hepatic endoderm into liver buds ( Rossi et al., 2001 ; Zaret, 2000 ; Zaret, 2001 )

Like lung development, tracheal morphogenesis is also governed by a complex process of inductive interactions between the endoderm and its surrounding mesoderm. We observed reduction in Bmp signaling in both the ventral foregut endoderm and mesenchyme, suggesting that Bmp4 signals not only function in an autocrine but also paracrine fashion to regulate the growth of the underlying foregut endoderm. In addition, n Bmp4 signaling could act indirectly on the endoderm by regulating mesenchymal signals that are critical for epithelial growth.

Several signaling pathways notably Wnt and Shh have been shown to play a critical role during endoderm growth and patterning. In the chick anterior foregut, Wnt5a and Wnt11 are expressed in the early tracheal mesenchyme, the laryngotracheal groove, suggesting that they may be involved in tracheal morphogenesis ( Sakiyama et al., 2000 ). Transgenic Top-Gal reporter expression in the mouse can be detected as early as E9.5 in the developing anterior foregut endoderm suggesting that Wnt signaling may play a key role in anterior foregut morphogenesis ( Okubo and Hogan, 2004 ; Shu et al., 2005 ). Wnt5a null embryos displayed defects in late lung maturation and tracheal length was significantly reduced ( Li et al., 2002 ). Likewise Wnt11 has been implicated in the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and morphogenesis of the chick respiratory tract ( Ouko et al., 2004 ; Sakiyama et al., 2000 ). Furthermore, Bmp has also been shown to regulate the cell cycle by controling Cyclin D1 expression and G1/S transition via activation of canonical Wnt signaling during neural crest delamination ( Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2004 ; Marcelle et al., 1997 ). Conditional inactivation of Bmp receptor, BMPR-IA, in the developing limb bud mesenchyme resulted in reduced levels of Wnt5a and cyclin D1, reduced cell proliferation and severe defect in distal limb outgrowth ( Ovchinnikov et al., 2006 ). Conversely, canonical Wnt signaling has been shown to transcriptionally regulate the expression of Bmp4 in the developing lung epithelium ( Shu et al., 2005 ). Hence, the coexistence of these two conserved signaling systems appears to be important during embryogenesis in promoting tissue growth and patterning in certain context. However, using the Top-Gal reporter mouse line ( DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999 ), we did not observe changes in Wnt signaling in Bmp4 cko foregut. In addition, targeted deletion of •-catenin in the foregut resulted in tracheal defects distinct from that of Bmp4 cko , suggesting that Bmp signaling likely does not act via Wnt/•-catenin signaling during tracheal morphogenesis.

Embryos with Shh loss-of-function displayed severe esophageal and tracheal defects suggesting a critical role of Shh signaling in foregut morphogenesis ( Litingtung et al., 1998 ; Motoyama et al., 1998 ; Pepicelli et al., 1998 ). Since it has been suggested that Bmp signaling can cross-talk with Shh during palatogenesis and tooth germ development ( Chen et al., 1996 ; Zhang et al., 2000 ; Zhang et al., 2002 ), we also examined the potential role played by Shh in the Bmp4 cko tracheal phenotype. However, the expression of Shh and its downstream target gene Gli1 in Bmp4 cko foregut appeared comparable to wildtype at E9.0-E9.5 ( Supplemental Fig. 1A-D , data not shown). Furthermore, constitutive activation of Shh pathway using SmoM2 allele in the ventral foregut did not rescue the Bmp4 cko TA phenotype. Thus, Shh signaling does not appear to mediate the loss-of-trachea phenotype in Bmp4 cko embryos.

Besides the canonical pathway mediated by Smads, Bmp/TGFbeta signaling has also been shown to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway via ERK, JNK or p38 ( Derynck and Zhang, 2003 ; Hamada et al., 2007 ; Haynes et al., 2007 ; Miyazono et al., 2005 ; Moustakas and Heldin, 2005 ; Nohe et al., 2002 ; Piek et al., 1999 ; Yang et al., 2005 ; Zhou et al., 2007 ). Here, we found that pErk1/2 was almost completely lost in Bmp4 cko ventral foregut suggesting that Erk signaling may be the underlying effector of Bmp4 pathway in regulating tracheal proliferation and outgrowth. It has been shown that during the initial stage of retinal regeneration, Bmp signaling directs FGF-dependent activation of Erk resulting in proliferation and differentiation ( Haynes et al., 2007 ). Although Fgf signaling is active during foregut morphogenesis, no mutants in Fgf signaling have been shown, sofar, that display a tracheal phenotype ( Celli et al., 1998 ; De Moerlooze et al., 2000 ; Min et al., 1998 ; Sekine et al., 1999 ). Therefore, Bmp signaling in the anterior ventral foregut regulates activation of Erk pathway possibly via a more direct mechanism. In a recent finding, ERK activation was shown as a central regulator for BMP-4 dependent capillary sprouting in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and Smad6 (I-Smad) can inhibit phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and endothelial cell sprouting ( Zhou et al., 2007 ). Interestingly, Smad4 (co-Smad) siRNA knockdown in HUVECs did not affect BMP-4 induced sprout length, suggesting that the ERK, but not Smad pathway, is necessary for endothelial cell sprouting. In our study, we detected expression of activated Smad1/5/8 and Erk1/2 in the ventral foregut, both of which are substantially lost in the Bmp4 cko foregut; how or whether these two pathways cross talk during tracheal formation remains to be investigated.

Bmp-induced receptor complexes can also phosphorylate and activate p38 MAPK pathway via TAK1 (TGFbeta-activated kinase 1) to modulate apoptosis ( Kendall et al., 2005 ; Kimura et al., 2000 ; Moustakas and Heldin, 2005 ). We did not detect activated/phosphorylated p38 MAPK staining in wildtype foregut at E9.25-E9.5, nor did we find alteration in phosphorylated-p38 staining in Bmp4 cko foreguts (data not shown), suggesting that Bmp4 does not directly activate the p38 MAPK pathway during tracheal formation. This is consistent with our finding that there was no significant apoptotic cells in the ventral foregut endoderm of Bmp4 cko and wildtype embryos at E9.0-10.5 (data not shown).

Tracheal agenesis is considered a rare congenital malformation but uniformly fatal ( Felix et al., 2006 ; Manschot et al., 1994 ; van Veenendaal et al., 2000 ). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this serious congenital defect are poorly understood. Our finding that Bmp cko mutants resemble the most common form of tracheal agenesis observed in human underscores the critical role of Bmp signaling in tracheal morphogenesis and provides a unique animal model to further elucidate the pathogenesis of this disease. Since familial patterns are uncommon, external factors have been implicated in foregut malformations such as EA/TEF and TA ( van Veenendaal et al., 2000 ). Taken together, our findings implicate Bmp signaling as a potential teratogenic target at a critical period during human foregut development.
