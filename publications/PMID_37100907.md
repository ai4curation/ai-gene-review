Circadian rhythms influence many behaviours and diseases1,2. They arise from 
oscillations in gene expression caused by repressor proteins that directly 
inhibit transcription of their own genes. The fly circadian clock offers a 
valuable model for studying these processes, wherein Timeless (Tim) plays a 
critical role in mediating nuclear entry of the transcriptional repressor Period 
(Per) and the photoreceptor Cryptochrome (Cry) entrains the clock by triggering 
Tim degradation in light2,3. Here, through cryogenic electron microscopy of the 
Cry-Tim complex, we show how a light-sensing cryptochrome recognizes its target. 
Cry engages a continuous core of amino-terminal Tim armadillo repeats, 
resembling how photolyases recognize damaged DNA, and binds a C-terminal Tim 
helix, reminiscent of the interactions between light-insensitive cryptochromes 
and their partners in mammals. The structure highlights how the Cry flavin 
cofactor undergoes conformational changes that couple to large-scale 
rearrangements at the molecular interface, and how a phosphorylated segment in 
Tim may impact clock period by regulating the binding of Importin-α and the 
nuclear import of Tim-Per4,5. Moreover, the structure reveals that the 
N terminus of Tim inserts into the restructured Cry pocket to replace the 
autoinhibitory C-terminal tail released by light, thereby providing a possible 
explanation for how the long-short Tim polymorphism adapts flies to different 
climates6,7.
