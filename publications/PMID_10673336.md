Exon trapping from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC 78138) mapping to the 
19q13.3 glioma tumor suppressor candidate region yielded two exons that 
recognized a 3.6-kb transcript on Northern blot. Screening of a human fetal 
brain cDNA library with these exons identified three novel genes, designated 
EHD2, EHD3, and EHD4, which are homologous to the recently characterized human 
EHD1 (testilin/HPAST) and its mouse homolog Ehd1, as well as to homologs in 
Drosophila (Past1) and Caenorhabditis elegans. Alignment of the predicted 
peptide sequences revealed striking similarities, with multiple conserved 
regions that include a nucleotide-binding consensus site at the N-terminus, a 
bipartite nuclear localization signal, and an eps15 homology (EH) 
protein-binding domain with an EF-hand motif at the C-terminus. The genes are 
specifically expressed, with EHD2 highly expressed in heart, EHD3 in brain and 
heart, and EHD4 in heart and pancreas. EHD2 was confirmed to originate from BAC 
78138 at 19q13.3; radiation hybrid mapping localized EHD3 and EHD4 to 2p21 and 
15q11.1, respectively; EHD1 has been previously mapped to 11q13. The three EHD1 
paralogs therefore represent novel members of a family of human EH 
domain-containing proteins that may play a role in endocytosis and signaling. 
Mutation analysis of the five coding exons of EHD2 in gliomas failed to detect 
any tumor-specific alterations, thus indicating that EHD2 is an unlikely 
candidate for the 19q tumor suppressor gene.
