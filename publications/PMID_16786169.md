The role of regucalcin, a regulatory protein in intracellular signaling system, 
in the regulation of Ca2+-ATPase activity in rat heart mitochondria was 
investigated. Mitochondrial Ca2+-ATPase activity was significantly increased by 
increasing concentrations of CaCl2 (2.5-50 microM). An increase in the enzyme 
activity was saturated at 50 microM CaCl2. The addition of regucalcin 
(10(-11)-10(-8) M) in the enzyme reaction mixture caused a significant increase 
in Ca2+-ATPase activity in heart mitochondria in the presence of 50 microM 
CaCl2. Regucalcin did not have a significant effect on mitochondrial Mg2+-ATPase 
activity. Regucalcin (10(-9) M) did not have a significant effect on Ca2+-ATPase 
activity in the presence of digitonin (10(-3) or 10(-2) %), which is a 
solubilization effect on membranous lipids. The effect of regucalcin in 
increasing mitochondrial Ca2+-ATPase activity was not observed in the presence 
of ruthenium red (10(-7) M) or lanthanum chloride (10(-7) M), which is an 
inhibitor of Ca2+ uniporter. The effect of regucalcin (10(-9) M) in increasing 
mitochondrial Ca2+-ATPase activity was not significantly enhanced in the 
presence of calmodulin (5 microg/ml) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-4) M), which 
is an intracellular signaling factor that can cause a significant increase in 
the enzyme activity. Mitochondrial regucalcin localization was significantly 
increased in the heart of regucalcin transgenic rats as compared with that of 
normal rats using Western blot analysis. Ca2+-ATPase activity was significantly 
increased in the heart mitochondria of regucalcin transgenic rats. This study 
demonstrates that regucalcin has an activating effect on Ca2+-ATPase in rat 
heart mitochondria, suggesting its role in the regulation of heart mitochondrial 
function.
