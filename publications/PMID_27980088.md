The small subunit (SSU) processome, a large ribonucleoprotein particle, 
organizes the assembly of the eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit by coordinating 
the folding, cleavage, and modification of nascent pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA). 
Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the yeast SSU 
processome at 5.1-angstrom resolution. The structure reveals how large ribosome 
biogenesis complexes assist the 5' external transcribed spacer and U3 small 
nucleolar RNA in providing an intertwined RNA-protein assembly platform for the 
separate maturation of 18S rRNA domains. The strategic placement of a molecular 
motor at the center of the particle further suggests a mechanism for mediating 
conformational changes within this giant particle. This study provides a 
structural framework for a mechanistic understanding of eukaryotic ribosome 
assembly in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
