Pancreatic colipase is a 12-kDa polypeptide cofactor for pancreatic lipase (EC 
3.1.1.3), an enzyme essential for the absorption of dietary long-chain 
triglyceride fatty acids. Colipase is thought to anchor lipase noncovalently to 
the surface of lipid micelles, counteracting the destabilizing influence of 
intestinal bile salts. Using primers derived from the known amino acid sequence, 
we have used the polymerase chain reaction to produce a cDNA clone corresponding 
to the complete coding region of the human procolipase mRNA. Southern blot 
analysis of genomic DNA from a panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids 
indicated that the colipase gene (CLPS) resides on human chromosome 6. Further 
analysis of somatic cell hybrids carrying chromosome 6 translocations permitted 
regional localization of CLPS to the 6p21.1-pter region.
