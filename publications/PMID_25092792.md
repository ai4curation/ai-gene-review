UBL5 is an atypical ubiquitin-like protein, whose function in metazoans remains 
largely unexplored. We show that UBL5 is required for sister chromatid cohesion 
maintenance in human cells. UBL5 primarily associates with spliceosomal 
proteins, and UBL5 depletion decreases pre-mRNA splicing efficiency, leading to 
globally enhanced intron retention. Defective sister chromatid cohesion is a 
general consequence of dysfunctional pre-mRNA splicing, resulting from the 
selective downregulation of the cohesion protection factor Sororin. As the UBL5 
yeast orthologue, Hub1, also promotes spliceosome functions, our results show 
that UBL5 plays an evolutionary conserved role in pre-mRNA splicing, the 
integrity of which is essential for the fidelity of chromosome segregation.
