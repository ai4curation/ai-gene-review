Alternative splicing of Dscam generates an enormous molecular diversity with 
maximally 38,016 different receptors. Whether this large diversity is required 
in vivo is currently unclear. We examined the role of Dscam in neuron-target 
recognition of single mechanosensory neurons, which connect with different 
target cells through multiple axonal branches. Analysis of Dscam null neurons 
demonstrated an essential role of Dscam for growth and directed extension of 
axon branches. Expression of randomly chosen single isoforms could not rescue 
connectivity but did restore basic axonal extension and rudimentary branching. 
Moreover, two Dscam alleles were generated that each reduced the maximally 
possible Dscam diversity to 22,176 isoforms. Reduction of Dscam diversity 
resulted in specific connectivity defects of mechanosensory neurons. 
Furthermore, the observed allele-specific phenotypes suggest functional 
differences among isoforms. Our findings provide evidence that a very large 
number of structurally unique receptor isoforms is required to ensure fidelity 
and precision of neuronal connectivity.
