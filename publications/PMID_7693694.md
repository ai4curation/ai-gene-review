Protein tyrosine phosphatases all contain a conserved cysteine that forms an 
intermediate thiophosphate ester bond during tyrosine phosphate hydrolysis. A 
bacterial glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing rat brain 
phosphatase PTP1b was constructed in which this conserved cysteine was mutated 
to serine. The resulting catalytically inactive enzyme was labeled in vivo to 
high specific activity with 35S, and the binding of this labeled fusion protein 
to the immunoprecipitated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor was evaluated. 
The binding was ligand-dependent, and saturation analysis revealed a nonlinear 
Scatchard plot, with a Kd for high affinity binding of approximately 100 nM. A 
number of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing src homology 2 
(SH2) domains attenuated phosphatase binding in a concentration-dependent 
manner. Phospholipase C (PLC) gamma and the GTPase-activating protein of ras 
were the most potent inhibitors. Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor peptide 
fragments were evaluated for specific inhibition of PTP1b and PLC gamma SH2 
binding to the activated receptor. One such peptide, modeled on EGF receptor 
tyrosine 992, blocked the binding of both fusion proteins. Another 
phosphopeptide, modeled on tyrosine 1148, inhibited the binding of PTP1b but not 
the PLC gamma fusion protein. This site specificity was confirmed by analysis of 
equilibrium binding of the fusion proteins to EGF receptors mutated in each of 
these phosphorylation sites. The results revealed clear sequence specificity in 
the binding of proteins involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling by 
receptor tyrosine kinases.
