Axin is a scaffold protein for the beta-catenin destruction complex, and a 
negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling. Previous studies implicated the 
six C-terminal amino acids (C6 motif) in the ability of Axin to activate c-Jun 
N-terminal kinase, and identified them as a SUMOylation target. Deletion of the 
C6 motif of mouse Axin in vivo reduced the steady-state protein level, which 
caused embryonic lethality. Here, we report that this deletion (Axin-DeltaC6) 
causes a reduced half-life in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and an increased 
susceptibility to ubiquitination in HEK 293T cells. We confirmed the C6 motif as 
a SUMOylation target in vitro, and found that mutating the C-terminal 
SUMOylation target residues increased the susceptibility of Axin to 
polyubiquitination and reduced its steady-state level. Heterologous SUMOylation 
target sites could replace C6 in providing this protective effect. These 
findings suggest that SUMOylation of the C6 motif may prevent 
polyubiquitination, thus increasing the stability of Axin. Although C6 deletion 
also caused increased association of Axin with Dvl-1, this interaction was not 
altered by mutating the lysine residues in C6, nor could heterologous 
SUMOylation motifs replace the C6 motif in this assay. Therefore, some other 
specific property of the C6 motif seems to reduce the interaction of Axin with 
Dvl-1.

Abstract

Axin is a scaffold protein for the β-catenin destruction complex, and a negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling. Previous studies implicated the six C-terminal amino acids (C6 motif) in the ability of Axin to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and identified them as a SUMOylation target. Deletion of the C6 motif of mouse Axin in vivo reduced the steady-state protein level, which caused embryonic lethality. Here, we report that this deletion (Axin-ΔC6) causes a reduced half-life in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and an increased susceptibility to ubiquitination in HEK 293T cells. We confirmed the C6 motif as a SUMOylation target in vitro , and found that mutating the C-terminal SUMOylation target residues increased the susceptibility of Axin to polyubiquitination and reduced its steady-state level. Heterologous SUMOylation target sites could replace C6 in providing this protective effect. These findings suggest that SUMOylation of the C6 motif may prevent polyubiquitination, thus increasing the stability of Axin. Although C6 deletion also caused increased association of Axin with Dvl-1, this interaction was not altered by mutating the lysine residues in C6, nor could heterologous SUMOylation motifs replace the C6 motif in this assay. Therefore, some other specific property of the C6 motif seems to reduce the interaction of Axin with Dvl-1.—Kim, M. J., Chia, I. V., Costantini, F. SUMOylation target sites at the C terminus protect Axin from ubiquitination and confer protein stability.

DISCUSSION

Axin is a scaffold protein for the β-catenin destruction complex and a negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling. The steady-state level of Axin is very low, suggesting that it is the limiting component of the destruction complex and that modulation of its stability may be important for Wnt signaling. In the present study, we sought to explain why the deletion of the six C-terminal amino acids of Axin (the C6 motif) reduces its steady-state level by severalfold and therefore generates an embryonic lethal allele in mice (unpublished results). We first showed that Axin–ΔC6 has a reduced half-life compared to the wild-type protein. We then showed that Axin is susceptible to ubiquitination in multiple regions of the protein and that the C6 motif as well as the GSK3 binding and target sites are necessary to protect Axin from ubiquitination. As the C6 motif had been described as a target for SUMOylation, we confirmed that this sequence is a potential SUMOylation target in vitro and found a correlation among 1 ) the presence of the SUMOylation target motifs, 2 ) the steady-state level of Axin when cotransfected with ubiquitin, and 3 ) the resistance of Axin to ubiquitination. In addition, we showed that SUMOylation target sites from the heterologous proteins p53 or PML can replace the Axin C6 motif in providing this protective effect. Together, these findings suggest a model in which the SUMOylation of Axin on the C6 motif may play a role in regulating its ubiquitination and thus its stability and consequent abundance in the cell.

Although Axin plays an important role in the degradation of β-catenin through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and is itself subject to degradation following a Wnt signal (10 , 11 , 27 , 28) , the ubiquitination of Axin has not been previously reported. Here, we show that Axin is susceptible to polyubiquitination when it is coexpressed with ubiquitin in cultured cells, strongly suggesting that Axin also may be ubiquitinated in vivo and that this is likely to be important to control its stability. Axin can be ubiquitinated at multiple regions of the protein, as shown by deletion analysis, although the specific target lysine residues have not been identified. In addition to the C6 motif, discussed below, another sequence that appeared to protect Axin from ubiquitination was the GSK3 phosphorylation target residue S614 (and possibly also T609), as shown by mutagenesis of one or both residues (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, a fragment of Axin that contained T609 and S614 but lacked the GSK3 binding site (Axin 531–956) was also heavily ubiquitinated. These findings are consistent with the observation that phosphorylation by GSK3 stabilizes Axin (10 , 11) , and they indicate that the mechanism of stabilization involves protection from ubiquitination. How the phosphorylation of these residues may prevent ubiquitination of Axin is unclear, but it might act either by altering the conformation of the protein or by altering its association with other proteins. The ubiquitin ligases responsible for ubiquitination of Axin are not yet known, but it is interesting that Axin can bind to the E3 ubiquitin ligase Arkadia (29 , 30 , 31) and promote the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad7 (32) ; therefore, Arkadia is also a candidate for an Axin ubiquitin ligase.

The Axin C6 motif, which was the major subject of our studies, also protects Axin from ubiquitination (Fig. 2) , which probably accounts for its effects on protein stability ( Fig. 1 B ). We found that Axin-ΔC6 has an ∼2-fold lower half-life than wild-type Axin, which accounts, at least in part, for its lower steady-state level in the mutant mouse embryo ( Fig. 1 A ). Although the actual half-life of Axin is probably influenced by many factors ( e.g. , cell type, culture conditions), and the values we measured for wild-type Axin in cultured cells probably do not reflect its in vivo half-life, the relative instability of Axin-ΔC6 most likely persists under different conditions.

By mutating one or both lysines in the C6 motif (K951 and K954), we found that these residues are critical for the ability of the C6 motif to protect Axin from ubiquitination. They are unlikely to be targets of ubiquitination themselves, as deletion of the C6 motif, or replacement of one or both lysines with alanine, increased total polyubiquitination of full-length Axin, whereas the C-terminal 810–956 fragment of Axin was itself susceptible to only minimal polyubiquitination (Fig. 3) . Therefore, the C6 motif perhaps influences the ability of Axin to associate with other proteins, which in turn affect its ubiquitination. One intriguing hypothesis, which we investigated, is based on the prior observation that the C6 motif is important for the interaction of Axin with the SUMO-1 conjugating enzymes PIAS1, PIASxβ, and PIASy and is itself a target for SUMOylation (6) . Furthermore, it was shown that residues K951 and K954 in the C6 motifs could themselves be SUMOylated when Axin was cotransfected with SUMO-1 into HEK 293T cells, and these residues appeared to be the major targets of SUMOylation in Axin (6) . Although we were unable to detect the SUMOylation of Axin in similar cotransfection experiments—perhaps because of the often transient nature of SUMO modification (15) —we found that Axin could be SUMOylated in vitro and that K951, and possibly also K954, appeared to be SUMOylation target residues (Fig. 3) . Thus, we demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between the ability of Axin to be SUMOylated on the C6 motif and its susceptibility to ubiquitination and destabilization. Although it remains to be determined whether Axin is actually SUMOylated in vivo , our results raise the possibility that the SUMOylation of Axin on the C6 motif might protect it from ubiquitination at other sites, and thus control its stability.

This hypothesis received further support from the observation that the addition of heterologous SUMOylation target sites (from two other proteins that are known SUMO-1 targets, p53 and PML) in place of the C6 motif decreased Axin’s ubiquitination and increased its stability, whereas mutation of the target lysine residues in these heterologous SUMOylation sites diminished or eliminated their effects (Fig. 4) . The mechanism by which the SUMOylation of Axin on the C6 motif might protect it from ubiquitination at other sites is unclear. Several proteins, including IκBα, NEMO/IKKγ, PCNA, and Huntingtin, are known to be protected from ubiquitination by SUMOylation of the same target lysine residues (15 , 16) . In the case of Axin, it is possible that SUMO modification of the C6 motif either alters its interactions with other proteins, which in turn affect its ubiquitination at other lysine residues, or else SUMOylation may alter Axin’s subcellular localization, as it is known to do for many other proteins (15 , 16) .

To test the former hypothesis, we examined the ability of Axin vs. Axin-ΔC6 to interact with several other components of the canonical Wnt pathway. Although full-length Axin immunoprecipitated only weakly with Dvl-1 under the conditions of the assay, interestingly, Axin-ΔC6 showed a greatly increased association with Dvl-1, indicating that the C6 motif diminishes this interaction. However, unlike the SUMOylation and ubiquitination of Axin, the interaction of Axin with Dvl-1 was not altered by mutating the lysine residues in the C6 motif, nor could heterologous SUMOylation motifs replace the C6 motif in this assay. Therefore, some other specific property of the C6 motif seems to reduce the interaction of Axin with Dvl-1. Because the DIX domain, which plays a role in Axin-Dvl interactions (33 , 34 , 35) is very close to the C terminus, it is possible that the C6 motif interferes with interaction between the DIX domain of Axin and Dvl.

Because the degradation of Axin may play an important role in the transmission of a Wnt signal (3 , 12) , it will be interesting in the future to determine whether the ubiquitination of Axin is altered by Wnt signaling and whether the SUMOylation of the C6 motif plays a regulatory role in this process.
