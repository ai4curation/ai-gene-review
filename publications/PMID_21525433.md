Chronic hypoxia (CH) activates the Ca(2+)-dependent transcription factor nuclear 
factor of activated T cells isoform c3 (NFATc3) in mouse pulmonary arteries. 
However, the mechanism of this response has not been explored. Since we have 
demonstrated that NFATc3 is required for CH-induced pulmonary arterial 
remodeling, establishing how CH activates NFATc3 is physiologically significant. 
The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that endothelin-1 (ET-1) 
contributes to CH-induced NFATc3 activation. We propose that this mechanism 
requires increased pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) intracellular 
Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and stimulation of RhoA/Rho kinase (ROK), 
leading to calcineurin activation and actin cytoskeleton polymerization, 
respectively. We found that: 1) CH increases pulmonary arterial pre-pro-ET-1 
mRNA expression and lung RhoA activity; 2) inhibition of ET receptors, 
calcineurin, L-type Ca(2+) channels, and ROK blunts CH-induced NFATc3 activation 
in isolated intrapulmonary arteries from NFAT-luciferase reporter mice; and 3) 
both ET-1-induced NFATc3 activation in isolated mouse pulmonary arteries ex vivo 
and ET-1-induced NFATc3-green fluorescence protein nuclear import in human PASMC 
depend on ROK and actin polymerization. This study suggests that CH increases 
ET-1 expression, thereby elevating PASMC [Ca(2+)](i) and RhoA/ROK activity. As 
previously demonstrated, elevated [Ca(2+)](i) is required to activate 
calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFATc3, allowing its nuclear import. Here, 
we demonstrate that ROK increases actin polymerization, thus providing 
structural support for NFATc3 nuclear transport.
