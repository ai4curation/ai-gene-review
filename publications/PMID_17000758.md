Dbs is a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) with in vitro 
exchange activity specific for RhoA and Cdc42. Like many RhoGEF family members, 
the in vivo exchange activity of Dbs is restricted in a cell-specific manner. 
Here we report the characterization of a novel scaffold protein (designated cell 
cycle progression protein 1 [Ccpg1]) that interacts with Dbs and modulates its 
in vivo exchange specificity. When coexpressed in mammalian cells, Ccpg1 binds 
to the Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology domain tandem motif of Dbs and inhibits 
its exchange activity toward RhoA, but not Cdc42. Expression of Ccpg1 correlates 
with the ability of Dbs to activate endogenous RhoA in cultured cells, and 
suppression of endogenous Ccpg1 expression potentiates Dbs exchange activity 
toward RhoA. The isolated Dbs binding domain of Ccpg1 is not sufficient to 
suppress Dbs exchange activity on RhoA, thus suggesting a regulatory 
interaction. Ccpg1 mediates recruitment of endogenous Src kinase into 
Dbs-containing complexes and interacts with the Rho family member Cdc42. 
Collectively, our studies suggest that Ccpg1 represents a new class of 
regulatory scaffold protein that can function as both an assembly platform for 
Rho protein signaling complexes and a regulatory protein which can restrict the 
substrate utilization of a promiscuous RhoGEF family member.
