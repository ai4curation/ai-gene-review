The molecular chaperones Hsp90 and Hsp70 are highly regulated by various 
cochaperones that participate in the activation of steroid receptors. Here we 
study Tpr2 (also called DjC7), a TPR domain-containing type III J protein 
implicated in steroid receptor chaperoning. We propose that Tpr2 plays a role in 
the Hsp90-dependent chaperoning of the progesterone receptor (PR). Tpr2 
overexpression or knockdown resulted in slight reductions in PR transcriptional 
activity in HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments indicated 
that Tpr2 associates with Hsp90 and Hsp70 complexes, some of which also contain 
the PR. Tpr2 can bind Hsp90 and Hsp70 simultaneously, which is also a property 
of the cochaperone Hop. However, unlike Hop, Tpr2 binding to Hsp70 in the 
presence of Hsp90 is ATP-dependent, and Tpr2 cannot replace Hop in Hsp90 
chaperoning in vitro or in vivo. While Tpr2 was not detected as a component of 
PR heterocomplexes in cell lysates, purified Tpr2 bound the PR readily. 
Surprisingly, Tpr2 replaced type I and II J proteins in the Hsp90-dependent 
chaperoning of the PR and the protein kinase, Chk1. Unlike other J proteins, 
Tpr2 promoted the accumulation of Hsp70 in PR heterocomplexes in the presence of 
Hsp90. Thus, Tpr2 has the potential to regulate PR chaperoning.
