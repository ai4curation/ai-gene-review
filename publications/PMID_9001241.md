We have developed a potential model of Schwann cell tumor formation in 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). We show that mouse Schwann cells heterozygous or 
null at Nf1 display angiogenic and invasive properties, mimicking the behavior 
of Schwann cells from human neurofibromas. Mutations at Nf1 are insufficient to 
promote Schwann cell hyperplasia. Here we show that Schwann cell hyperplasia can 
be induced by protein kinase A activation in mutant cells. Removal of serum from 
the culture medium also stimulates hyperplasia, but only in some mutant cells. 
After serum removal, clones of hyperproliferating Schwann cells lose contact 
with axons in vitro, develop growth factor-independent proliferation, and 
exhibit decreased expression of the cell differentiation marker P0 protein; 
hyperproliferating cells develop after a 1-week lag in Schwann cells 
heterozygous at Nf1. The experiments suggest that events subsequent to Nf1 
mutations are required for development of Schwann cell hyperplasia. Finally, an 
anti-Ras farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor greatly diminished both clone 
formation and hyperproliferation of null mutant cells, but not invasion; 
farnesyl transferase inhibitors could be useful in treating benign 
manifestations of NF1.
