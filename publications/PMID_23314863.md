Eps8, a bi-functional actin cytoskeleton remodeller, is a positive regulator of 
cell proliferation and motility. Here, we describe an unrecognized mechanism 
regulating Eps8 that is required for proper mitotic progression: whereas Eps8 is 
stable in G1 and S phase, its half-life drops sharply in G2. This requires 
G2-specific proteasomal degradation mediated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase 
SCF(Fbxw5). Consistent with a short window of degradation, Eps8 disappears from 
the cell cortex early in mitosis, but reappears at the midzone of dividing 
cells. Failure to reduce Eps8 levels in G2 prolongs its localization at the cell 
cortex and markedly delays cell rounding and prometaphase duration. However, 
during late stages of mitosis and cytokinesis, Eps8 capping activity is required 
to prevent membrane blebbing and cell-shape deformations. Our findings identify 
SCF(Fbxw5)-driven fluctuation of Eps8 levels as an important mechanism that 
contributes to cell-shape changes during entry into-and exit from-mitosis.
