Unlike plants and invertebrates, mammals reportedly lack proteins displaying 
asparagine (N)-linked paucimannosylation 
(mannose(1-3)fucose(0-1)N-acetylglucosamine(2)Asn). Enabled by technology 
advancements in system-wide biomolecular characterization, we document that 
protein paucimannosylation is a significant host-derived molecular signature of 
neutrophil-rich sputum from pathogen-infected human lungs and is negligible in 
pathogen-free sputum. Five types of paucimannosidic N-glycans were carried by 
compartment-specific and inflammation-associated proteins of the azurophilic 
granules of human neutrophils including myeloperoxidase (MPO), azurocidin, and 
neutrophil elastase. The timely expressed human azurophilic granule-resident 
β-hexosaminidase A displayed the capacity to generate paucimannosidic N-glycans 
by trimming hybrid/complex type N-glycan intermediates with relative broad 
substrate specificity. Paucimannosidic N-glycoepitopes showed significant 
co-localization with β-hexosaminidase A and the azurophilic marker MPO in human 
neutrophils using immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, promyelocyte stage-specific 
expression of genes coding for paucimannosidic proteins and biosynthetic enzymes 
indicated a novel spatio-temporal biosynthetic route in early neutrophil 
maturation. The absence of bacterial exoglycosidase activities and 
paucimannosidic N-glycans excluded exogenous origins of paucimannosylation. 
Paucimannosidic proteins from isolated and sputum neutrophils were 
preferentially secreted upon inoculation with virulent Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
Finally, paucimannosidic proteins displayed affinities to mannose-binding 
lectin, suggesting immune-related functions of paucimannosylation in activated 
human neutrophils. In conclusion, we are the first to document that human 
neutrophils produce, store and, upon activation, selectively secrete bioactive 
paucimannosidic proteins into sputum of lungs undergoing pathogen-based 
inflammation.
