OBJECTIVE: Aortic valve disease, including calcification, affects >2% of the 
human population and is caused by complex interactions between multiple risk 
factors, including genetic mutations, the environment, and biomechanics. At 
present, there are no effective treatments other than surgery, and this is 
because of the limited understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the 
condition. Previous work has shown that valve interstitial cells within the 
aortic valve cusps differentiate toward an osteoblast-like cell and deposit 
bone-like matrix that leads to leaflet stiffening and calcific aortic valve 
stenosis. However, the mechanisms that promote pathological phenotypes in valve 
interstitial cells are unknown.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo tools with 
mouse, porcine, and human tissue, we show that in valve interstitial cells, 
reduced Sox9 expression and nuclear localization precedes the onset of 
calcification. In vitro, Sox9 nuclear export and calcific nodule formation is 
prevented by valve endothelial cells. However, in vivo, loss of Tgfβ1 in the 
endothelium leads to reduced Sox9 expression and calcific aortic valve disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest that reduced nuclear localization 
of Sox9 in valve interstitial cells is an early indicator of calcification, and 
therefore, pharmacological targeting to prevent nuclear export could serve as a 
novel therapeutic tool in the prevention of calcification and stenosis.
