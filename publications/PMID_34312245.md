In female eutherian mammals, dosage compensation of X-linked gene expression is 
achieved during development through transcriptional silencing of one of the two 
X chromosomes. Following X chromosome inactivation (XCI), the inactive X 
chromosome remains faithfully silenced throughout somatic cell divisions. XCI is 
dependent on Xist, a long noncoding RNA that coats and silences the X chromosome 
from which it is transcribed. Xist coating triggers a cascade of chromosome-wide 
changes occurring at the levels of transcription, chromatin composition, 
chromosome structure, and spatial organization within the nucleus. XCI has 
emerged as a paradigm for the study of such crucial nuclear processes and the 
dissection of their functional interplay. In the past decade, the advent of 
tools to characterize and perturb these processes have provided an unprecedented 
understanding into their roles during XCI. The mechanisms orchestrating the 
initiation of XCI as well as its maintenance are thus being unraveled, although 
many questions still remain. Here, we introduce key aspects of the XCI process 
and review the recent discoveries about its molecular basis.

Abstract

In female eutherian mammals, dosage compensation of X-linked gene expression is achieved during development through transcriptional silencing of one of the two X chromosomes. Following X chromosome inactivation (XCI), the inactive X chromosome remains faithfully silenced throughout somatic cell divisions. XCI is dependent on Xist , a long noncoding RNA that coats and silences the X chromosome from which it is transcribed. Xist coating triggers a cascade of chromosome-wide changes occurring at the levels of transcription, chromatin composition, chromosome structure, and spatial organization within the nucleus. XCI has emerged as a paradigm for the study of such crucial nuclear processes and the dissection of their functional interplay. In the past decade, the advent of tools to characterize and perturb these processes have provided an unprecedented understanding into their roles during XCI. The mechanisms orchestrating the initiation of XCI as well as its maintenance are thus being unraveled, although many questions still remain. Here, we introduce key aspects of the XCI process and review the recent discoveries about its molecular basis.

CONCLUSION

A considerable body of literature now provides an increasingly clear picture of how XCI generally takes place. In particular, recent advances in RBP proteomics and genome-wide screens have brought important insights into how Xist triggers gene silencing, revealing that contrary to what was expected, chromatin modifiers are not directly recruited by Xist . Furthermore, advances in genetic engineering in mammals have enriched the repertoire of factors involved in the tight control of Xist expression.

The fact that two X chromosomes sharing the same nucleus are faced with very different transcriptional fates is remarkable. Nuclear organization has long been proposed to be a crucial component for such different treatment of the X chromosomes. Thanks to recent works, the molecular basis for the peculiar nuclear organization and positioning of the Xi is now much better understood. Genetic perturbation of the mechanisms involved, however, reveals that nuclear organization is not as essential as previously thought in ensuring that one X chromosome becomes inactivated. However, the role of Xi nuclear organization and positioning in the maintenance of its epigenetic and transcriptional status still needs to be investigated.

Several features of XCI remain completely enigmatic. How Xist coats the X chromosome in cis , and how its localization is strictly confined to the X chromosome (and not autosomes) is largely unknown. How different genes undergo silencing with different dynamics, and how some in fact manage to fully escape silencing also needs to be understood. A pioneer proteomics study recently revealed that dosage compensation defects in female human induced pluripotent stem cells do not only result in increased protein output from X-linked genes, as expected, but also in globally elevated protein levels for more than 20% of autosomal genes ( Brenes et al. 2021 ). The physiological consequence of X chromosome dosage compensation failure must now be further investigated—at both molecular and cellular levels—in vivo.

With the advent of single-cell technologies, future studies should also be able to address the tissue and cell-to-cell variability observed with respect to Xi transcription and nuclear organization, further helping to understand the physiological importance of XCI. Finally, it is now as important to study the process of XCI across a wider variety of mammalian systems, including marsupials, so as to better understand the evolutionary origin of such a remarkable nuclear process.
