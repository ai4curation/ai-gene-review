that promotes the ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of p53. 
Many agents that induce p53 are inhibitors of transcription, suggesting that the 
p53 pathway can detect a signal(s) arising from transcriptional malfunction. 
Mdm2 associates with TAFII250, a component of the general transcription factor 
TFIID. Inactivation of TAFII250 in ts13 cells, which express a 
temperature-sensitive mutant of TAFII250, leads to the induction of p53 and cell 
cycle arrest. In the present study, we show that TAFII250 stimulates the 
ubiquitylation and degradation of p53 in a manner that is dependent upon Mdm2 
and requires its acidic domain. Mechanistically, TAFII250 downregulates Mdm2 
auto-ubiquitylation, leading to Mdm2 stabilization, and promotes p53-Mdm2 
association through a recently defined second binding site in the acidic domain 
of Mdm2. These data provide a novel route through which TAFII250 can directly 
influence p53 levels and are consistent with the idea that the maintenance of 
p53 turnover is coupled to the integrity of RNA polymerase II transcription.

Abstract

The p53tumour suppressor is regulated mainly by Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of p53. Many agents that induce p53 are inhibitors of transcription, suggesting that the p53 pathway can detect a signal(s) arising from transcriptional malfunction. Mdm2 associates with TAFII250, a component of the general transcription factor TFIID. Inactivation of TAFII250 in ts13 cells, which express a temperature-sensitive mutant of TAFII250, leads to the induction of p53 and cell cycle arrest. In the present study, we show that TAFII250 stimulates the ubiquitylation and degradation of p53 in a manner that is dependent upon Mdm2 and requires its acidic domain. Mechanistically, TAFII250 downregulates Mdm2 auto-ubiquitylation, leading to Mdm2 stabilization, and promotes p53-Mdm2 association through a recently defined second binding site in the acidic domain of Mdm2. These data provide a novel route through which TAFII250 can directly influence p53 levels and are consistent with the idea that the maintenance of p53 turnover is coupled to the integrity of RNA polymerase II transcription.

Introduction

The p53 tumour suppressor protein is a short-lived transcription factor that is stabilized and activated, mainly through post-translational mechanisms, in response to a wide variety of cellular stresses, including DNA damage and hyper-proliferation (reviewed by Vousden and Lu (2002) and Yee and Vousden (2005) ). Activated p53 orchestrates the transactivation or transrepression of many target genes leading to growth arrest, senescence or apoptosis.

The stability of p53 is regulated mainly by the oncoprotein Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the ubiquitylation and rapid proteasome-dependent degradation of p53 and Mdm2 itself ( Fang et al ., 2000 ; Honda and Yasuda, 2000 ); reviewed by Michael and Oren (2003) . p53 and Mdm2 form an autoregulatory loop in which p53 positively regulates mdm2 expression while Mdm2 negatively regulates p53 levels and activity ( Wu et al ., 1993 ). Cellular stresses that induce p53 disrupt the p53–Mdm2 interaction with the effect of attenuating p53 degradation ( Ashcroft et al ., 2000 ).

Mdm2 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that contains several conserved regions including an N -terminal p53-binding domain, a C-terminal RING finger domain required to mediate ubiquitylation of p53 and auto-ubiquitylation ( Fang et al ., 2000 ; Honda and Yasuda, 2000 ), and a central acidic region that is important for p53 degradation ( Argentini et al ., 2001 ; Zhu et al ., 2001 ; Blattner et al ., 2002 ; Kawai et al ., 2003 ; Meulmeester et al ., 2003 ). Several proteins interact with the acidic domain including p14ARF ( Midgley et al ., 2000 ), the TATA-binding protein (TBP) ( Leveillard and Wasylyk, 1997 ) and a number of other transcriptional proteins and ribosomal proteins; reviewed by Ganguli and Wasylyk (2003) . Importantly, the acidic domain has recently been identified as a second point of contact between Mdm2 and p53 that interacts with a critical ubiquitylation signal in the core domain of p53 ( Shimizu et al ., 2002 ; Kulikov et al ., 2006 ; Wallace et al ., 2006 ; Yu et al ., 2006 ).

The TBP-associated factor (TAF), TAFII250 (also designated CCG1 or TAF1 in humans), is the largest component of the general transcription factor TFIID and acts as a scaffold for the assembly of TFIID from TBP and a number of other TAFs (reviewed by Wasserman and Sauer (2001) . Functionally, TAFII250 mediates promoter recognition and DNA binding by TFIID, alteration of chromatin structure, and posttranslational modification of general transcription factors, thereby facilitating transcriptional initiation. TAFII250 is an essential protein and is required for progression of the cell cycle and repression of apoptosis in mammalian cells ( Wasserman and Sauer, 2001 ). Interestingly, TAFII250 interacts directly with the RING finger domain of Mdm2 ( Leveillard and Wasylyk, 1997 ).

Blockage of RNA polymerase II transcription is thought to be a key factor in the induction of p53 by agents that elicit DNA damage ( Ljungman and Lane, 2004 ). However, the mechanisms through which failed transcription activates p53 are only partly understood. The BHK-derived cell lines, ts13 and tsBN462, encode a temperature sensitive mutant of TAFII250 (G690D) that is active at 33°C but dysfunctional when shifted to 39°C ( Sekiguchi et al ., 1988 ). At the non-permissive temperature, ts13 cells undergo a G1 phase cell cycle arrest in a manner that shows striking similarity to a DNA damage response, and is dependent upon ATR-mediated phosphorylation and activation of p53 ( Buchmann et al ., 2004 ). Additionally, induction of the p53 pathway under these conditions is likely to involve decreased TAFII250-dependent expression of Mdm2 ( Wasylyk and Wasylyk, 2000 ) as well as direct phosphorylation of p53 itself by TAFII250 ( Li et al ., 2004 ). Failure to express key TAFII250-dependent cell cycle-specific genes, such as cyclins A, D1 and D3, is also like to contribute to growth arrest at the nonpermissive temperature ( Suzuki-Yagawa et al ., 1997 ).

In the present study, we confirm that p53 is induced in ts13 cells grown at restrictive temperature, independently of a heat shock response. We also show that TAFII250 interacts with Mdm2 in vivo and promotes Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53. Using an in vivo ubiquitylation assay, we show that TAFII250 stimulates p53 ubiquitylation in a manner that is dependent upon Mdm2 and its acidic domain. The mechanism of this effect involves TAFII250-mediated inhibition of Mdm2 auto-ubiquitylation and stabilization of Mdm2, as well as stimulation of p53-Mdm2 association through the acidic domain of Mdm2.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that Mdm2 and TAFII250 associate in cultured cells ( Figure 1 ) and that a robust induction of p53 occurs following temperature-sensitive inactivation of TAFII250 in the ts13 cells ( Figure 2 ). These data are in close agreement with the findings of other groups who have studied the interaction between TAFII250 and the p53 pathway ( Leveillard and Wasylyk, 1997 ; Wasylyk and Wasylyk, 2000 ; Buchmann et al ., 2004 ; Li et al ., 2004 ). In order to understand the underlying mechanism(s) that leads to the induction of p53, we investigated the influence of TAFII250 on p53 levels and ubiquitylation. We find that TAFII250 promotes the ubiquitylation and turnover of p53 in an Mdm2-dependent manner ( Figure 3 ). The mechanism of this effect involves inhibition of Mdm2 auto-ubiquitylation, leading to the stabilization of Mdm2 (Figures 4 and 5 ). Additionally, we find that TAFII250 promotes the association of p53 with Mdm2, both in cultured cells and in vitro , in a manner that requires the acidic domain of Mdm2 and is independent of the Mdm2 binding function in the N -terminus of p53 ( Figure 6 ). Taken together, these findings suggest that Mdm2 ubiquitylation function and interaction with p53 can be regulated physiologically by TAFII250. However, while we are confident that the link between TAFII250 and the p53 response is well established ( Leveillard and Wasylyk, 1997 ; Wasylyk and Wasylyk, 2000 ; Buchmann et al ., 2004 ; Li et al ., 2004 ), and that our interpretation of the data is the most plausible one, we cannot rule out the possibility that varying the levels of proteins such as TAFII250 that are involved in fundamental cellular processes may lead to p53 activation through alterations in numerous indirectly linked cellular pathways. On the other hand, our demonstration that purified TAFII250 can stimulate the interaction between purified p53 and Mdm2 proteins in vitro strongly favours the idea that TAFII250 can directly interact with and regulate Mdm2 physiologically.

A model describing the influence of TAFII250 on the p53–Mdm2 interaction is shown in Figure 7 . p53-Mdm2 association occurs principally between the N-termini of the two proteins. Recently, however, a second point of contact has been identified that involves the core domain (DNA-binding domain) of p53 and the acidic domain of Mdm2 ( Kulikov et al ., 2006 ; Shimizu et al ., 2002 ; Wallace et al ., 2006 ; Yu et al ., 2006 ). The model arising from these studies proposes that association of the N-terminus of p53 with the N-terminus of Mdm2 triggers a conformational change in Mdm2 that permits the acidic domain to associate with a ubiquitylation signal in the core domain of p53 ( Wallace et al ., 2006 ). This second point of p53-Mdm2 contact is critical for p53 ubiquitylation to occur ( Kulikov et al ., 2006 ; Wallace et al ., 2006 ). In the present study, we confirm that the acidic domain is required for efficient Mdm2-mediated ubiqutylation of p53 and for Mdm2 auto-ubiquitylation ( Figure 3 ). Additionally, we find TAFII250-dependent stimulation of p53 ubiquitylation also requires the acidic domain of Mdm2 ( Figure 3 ). Strikingly, TAFII250 can promote the interaction between Mdm2 and a mutant of p53 (F19A; ( Bottger et al ., 1997 )) that cannot bind to Mdm2 through its N-terminal Mdm2-binding domain ( Figure 6 ). Since TAFII250 does not appear to affect association of p53 and Mdm2 through their N-terminal interacting domains ( Figure 6d ), these data fit with the idea that TAFII250 can facilitate the interaction of the core domain of p53 with the acidic domain of Mdm2. Additionally, the ability of TAFII250 to promote interaction between p53 and Mdm2 may contribute to the reduction in Mdm2 auto-ubiquitylation given that the E3 ligase function of Mdm2 would now be directed selectively towards p53. The ability of TAFII250 to bring p53 and Mdm2 together is reminiscent of the ability of YY1 to promote the p53-Mdm2 interaction ( Gronroos et al ., 2004 ; Sui et al ., 2004 ) and suggests that YY1 and TAFII250 may share a common mechanism for this effect, such as acting in the capacity of a scaffold.

The temperature-sensitive defect in the transcription factor TAFII250 gives rise to a G1 phase arrest that is characteristic of the DNA damage response and is mediated by p53 ( Wasylyk and Wasylyk, 2000 ; Buchmann et al ., 2004 ). Altered TAFII250-dependent expression of Mdm2 ( Wasylyk and Wasylyk, 2000 ), loss of the inhibitory phosphorylation of p53 at Thr55 ( Li et al ., 2004 ), and ATR-mediated Ser15 phosphorylation and activation of p53 ( Buchmann et al ., 2004 ) are likely to be key mechanistic events in this process. Our data demonstrate that stabilization of Mdm2 by TAFII250 promotes Mdm2-mediated ubiquitylation and turnover of p53 (Figures 3 – 5 ). We propose that loss of the p53 ubiquitylation function of Mdm2 is likely to be a major contributory factor, together with these other mechanisms, in the induction of p53 following TAFII250 inactivation.

In addition to the effect of TAFII250 on p53 turnover, we also find that knock down of Mdm2 leads to the induction of TAFII250 ( Figure 2e ). We have not yet explored the mechanism of this effect. However, it is an interesting observation that suggests the intriguing possibility of a negative feedback loop in which Mdm2 can downregulate the levels of its activator p53. Elucidation of this mechanism will be an important issue that will require further significant in-depth exploration.

Ljungman and Lane (2004) have put forward a strong case proposing that the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery may play a vital role in DNA damage surveillance and in triggering DNA damage responses to suppress mutagenesis. They highlight various lines of evidence that underpin the close association between RNA polymerase II transcription and the p53 response, including the observations that agents that block transcription lead to the induction of p53, that the DNA repair-associated transcription factor complex TFIIH phosphorylates and regulates p53, and that p53 degradation normally requires the participation of the p300 co-activator protein in the role of a scaffold protein. When viewed from this perspective, the data in the present study not only support this theme, but suggest plausible molecular mechanisms through which failure of the core transcription apparatus can be signalled directly to the p53 induction machinery. For example, recruitment and activation of Mdm2 by TAFII250 at specific promoters could help maintain low levels of p53. Thus, if transcriptional integrity was compromised, the ability to stabilize Mdm2 and promote its association with p53 would fail thereby contributing to elevated p53 levels. However, a model incorporating this mechanism is likely to be complex and will have to take into account the involvement and interplay of other mechanisms discussed above, such as the activation of ATR and its knock-on effects on p53 and Chk1 ( Buchmann et al ., 2004 ). This model also raises the more philosophical question of why a core transcription factor such as TAFII250 should maintain such a close relationship with Mdm2. Perhaps the answer lies in the knowledge that TAFII250 is tightly linked with the cell cycle and is responsible for promoting the expression of a range of cell cycle genes ( Suzuki-Yagawa et al ., 1997 ; O’Brien and Tjian, 2000 ). TAFII250 would be ideally suited to keep p53 under tight control as cells traverse the cycle. Mdm2 itself has been linked to the expression of cell cycle genes such as cyclin A ( Leveillard and Wasylyk, 1997 ). Therefore the maintenance of Mdm2 function would make biological sense under these circumstances.
