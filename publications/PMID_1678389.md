The laminin-nidogen complex, a major component of basement membranes, 
incorporates [3H]putrescine and monodansylcadaverine in the presence of guinea 
pig liver transglutaminase. Label was detected in nidogen in the isolated, as 
well as in the complexed form, but not in laminin. The incorporation proceeds in 
a time-dependent manner at a rate similar to that achieved with 
N,N-dimethylcasein, a well characterized transglutaminase substrate. Saturation 
of incorporation site(s), as well as comparison with the incorporation level in 
reference proteins, indicated the presence of one high affinity amine acceptor 
site in nidogen. Electron microscopy of the reaction products showed that the 
laminin-nidogen complexes become stabilized in a head-to-head arrangement, 
characteristic of Ca(2+)-induced self-aggregation. Indirect immunofluorescence 
and detection of transglutaminase activity on unfixed cryosections revealed an 
extracellular distribution of tissue transglutaminase. Intensive staining was 
observed in collagen-rich connective tissue. Codistribution with nidogen was not 
a ubiquitous feature, but was observed in many locations.
