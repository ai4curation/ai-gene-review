A B-box zinc finger protein, B-BOX32 (BBX32), was identified as playing a role 
in determining hypocotyl length during a large-scale functional genomics study 
in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Further analysis revealed that seedlings 
overexpressing BBX32 display elongated hypocotyls in red, far-red, and blue 
light, along with reduced cotyledon expansion in red light. Through comparative 
analysis of mutant and overexpression line phenotypes, including global 
expression profiling and growth curve studies, we demonstrate that BBX32 acts 
antagonistically to ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). We further show that BBX32 
interacts with SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG2/BBX21, another B-box protein previously 
shown to interact with HY5. Based on these data, we propose that BBX32 functions 
downstream of multiple photoreceptors as a modulator of light responses. As 
such, BBX32 potentially has a native role in mediating gene repression to 
maintain dark adaptation.

Abstract

A B-box zinc finger protein, B-BOX32 (BBX32), was identified as playing a role in determining hypocotyl length during a large-scale functional genomics study in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). Further analysis revealed that seedlings overexpressing BBX32 display elongated hypocotyls in red, far-red, and blue light, along with reduced cotyledon expansion in red light. Through comparative analysis of mutant and overexpression line phenotypes, including global expression profiling and growth curve studies, we demonstrate that BBX32 acts antagonistically to ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). We further show that BBX32 interacts with SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG2/BBX21, another B-box protein previously shown to interact with HY5. Based on these data, we propose that BBX32 functions downstream of multiple photoreceptors as a modulator of light responses. As such, BBX32 potentially has a native role in mediating gene repression to maintain dark adaptation.

RESULTS

BBX32 ( AT3G21150 ; Khanna et al., 2009 ) was identified as a putative regulator of hypocotyl growth in a large-scale functional genomics project performed in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of BBX32 was observed to produce increases in hypocotyl length; as such, the gene was chosen for a detailed study in which the phenotypes of 35S:: BBX32 lines were compared with the wild type and with those produced by a T-DNA insertion mutation ( bbx32-1 ) within the gene ( Fig. 1A ).

DISCUSSION

BBX32 was identified as playing a role in light-regulated hypocotyl growth from a large-scale functional genomics screen. Seedlings with constitutive expression of BBX32 were hyposensitive to red, blue, and far-red light. These seedlings exhibited alterations in light-regulated development of hypocotyls and cotyledons, which are characteristic of changes in photomorphogenesis. In contrast, the bbx32-1 mutant seedlings displayed only weak, but partially opposite, phenotypes. There was only one mutant allele ( bbx32-1 ) available for this study; therefore, we performed complementation analysis. The weak phenotype displayed by the bbx32-1 mutant seedlings was rescued by a prBBX32 :: BBX32 transgene ( Supplemental Fig. S2 ), suggesting that the observed hypersensitivity to light was linked to this locus. Our microarray and qRT-PCR-based gene expression analyses of bbx32-1 mutant seedlings revealed altered expression of light-responsive genes in the dark. In particular, the expression of light-stimulated genes, ELIP , CHS , and SIGE , appeared to be derepressed in dark-grown bbx32-1 seedlings ( Supplemental Fig. S1 ). This lack of gene repression in the dark-grown bbx32-1 mutant seedlings is consistent with the hypothesis that BBX32 acts with other proteins in a complex that functions as a modulator of light-regulated gene expression. Furthermore, a number of genes belonging to GO categories related to photosynthesis or carbon assimilation were induced in the bbx32-1 mutants grown in the dark ( Fig. 3 ). Analysis of additional alleles and multiple mutant combinations with potential functional cofactors will help in confirming the role of the native BBX32 as an accessory protein in modifying gene expression in the dark. Our results with multiple independent transgenic 35S:: BBX32 lines provide evidence that the constitutive expression of BBX32 reduces light responsiveness and promotes gene expression patterns that are characteristic of seedlings grown in darkness.
