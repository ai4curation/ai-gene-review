The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is targeted for lysosomal 
degradation by ubiquitin-mediated interactions with the ESCRTs 
(endosomal-sorting complexes required for transport) in multivesicular bodies 
(MVBs). We show that secretory carrier membrane protein, SCAMP3, localizes in 
part to early endosomes and negatively regulates EGFR degradation through 
processes that involve its ubiquitylation and interactions with ESCRTs. SCAMP3 
is multimonoubiquitylated and is able to associate with Nedd4 HECT ubiquitin 
ligases and the ESCRT-I subunit Tsg101 via its PY and PSAP motifs, respectively. 
SCAMP3 also associates with the ESCRT-0 subunit Hrs. Depletion of SCAMP3 in HeLa 
cells by inhibitory RNA accelerated degradation of EGFR and EGF while inhibiting 
recycling. Conversely, overexpression enhanced EGFR recycling unless 
ubiquitylatable lysines, PY or PSAP motifs in SCAMP3 were mutated. Notably, dual 
depletions of SCAMP3 and ESCRT subunits suggest that SCAMP3 has a distinct 
function in parallel with the ESCRTs that regulates receptor degradation. This 
function may affect trafficking of receptors from prelysosomal compartments as 
SCAMP3 depletion appeared to sustain the incidence of EGFR-containing MVBs 
detected by immunoelectron microscopy. Together, our results suggest that 
SCAMP3, its modification with ubiquitin, and its interactions with ESCRTs 
coordinately regulate endosomal pathways and affect the efficiency of receptor 
down-regulation.
