Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b are members of the family of small Tim proteins located 
in the intermembrane space of mammalian mitochondria. In yeast, members of this 
family act along the TIM22 import pathway during import of metabolite carriers 
and other integral inner membrane proteins. Here, we show that the human small 
proteins form two distinct hetero-oligomeric complexes. A 70-kDa complex that 
contains Tim9 and Tim10a and a Tim9-10a-10b that is part of a higher molecular 
weight assembly of 450 kDa. This distribution among two complexes suggests 
Tim10b to be the functional homologue of yeast Tim12. Both human complexes are 
tightly associated with the inner membrane and, compared with yeast, soluble 
70-kDa complexes appear to be completely absent in the intermembrane space. 
Thus, the function of soluble 70-kDa complexes as trans-site receptors for 
incoming carrier proteins is not conserved from lower to higher eukaryotes. 
During import, the small Tim complexes directly interact with human adenine 
nucleotide translocator (ANT) in transit in a metal-dependent manner. For 
insertion of carrier preproteins into the inner membrane, the human small Tim 
proteins directly interact with human Tim22, the putative insertion pore of the 
TIM22 translocase. However, in contrast to yeast, only a small fraction of 
Tim9-Tim10a-Tim10b complex is in a stable association with Tim22. We conclude 
that different mechanisms and specific requirements for import and insertion of 
mammalian carrier preproteins have evolved in higher eukaryotes.
