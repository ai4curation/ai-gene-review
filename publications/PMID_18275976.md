Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) was first purified from red blood cell membranes and is now 
known to be an osmolarity-driven water transporter that is widely expressed in 
many epithelial and endothelial cells outside the brain. Several recent studies 
have shown strong expression of AQP1 in proliferating tumor microvessels, 
suggesting that AQP1 may have an important role in tumor angiogenesis. Hypoxia 
is thought to be a common precursor to neovascularization in many retinal 
diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, and therefore we analyzed the 
expression pattern and function of AQP1 in human retinal vascular endothelial 
cells cultured under hypoxic conditions. The levels of AQP1 mRNA and protein 
expression significantly increased under hypoxia, and inhibition of VEGF 
signaling did not affect AQP1 expression. To examine the effect of AQP1 on 
hypoxia-inducible angiogenesis, a tube formation assay was performed. Reduction 
of AQP1 expression using siRNA and inhibition of VEGF signaling both 
significantly inhibited tube formation, and these effects were additive. 
Therefore, our data suggest that AQP1 is involved in hypoxia-inducible 
angiogenesis in retinal vascular endothelial cells through a mechanism that is 
independent of the VEGF signaling pathway.
