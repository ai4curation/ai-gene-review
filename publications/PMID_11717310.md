Nedd4 is a HECT domain-containing ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitylation 
and proteasome degradation of target proteins. The molecular basis for the 
interaction of Nedd4 with substrates lies in its WW domains, which can bind 
proline-rich (PY) domains in target proteins. Nedd4 is a developmentally 
expressed protein and may have a fundamental role to play in embryonic 
processes. However, whether Nedd4 has such a function is currently unknown, in 
part because few developmentally regulated ubiquitylation substrates have been 
identified or characterized. We have carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen and 
identified four proteins expressed in the mid-gestation embryo that are able to 
interact with Nedd4. Characterization of their functional interaction with Nedd4 
in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that three of the four are bona fide Nedd4 
binding partners, and two have the capacity to be ubiquitylation substrates. One 
of these is the first identified nonviral substrate for Nedd4-mediated 
monoubiquitylation. Interestingly, neither of these two ubiquitylated proteins 
interacts with Nedd4 through PY-mediated mechanisms. For one of the three Nedd4 
binding partners, there was no discernable evidence of ubiquitylation. However, 
this protein clearly associates with Nedd4 through its PY domains and can alter 
the location of Nedd4 in cells, suggesting a role other than as a ubiquitylation 
substrate.
