The structure of a symmetric T3R3f insulin hexamer, complexed with 
4-hydroxybenzamide, has been determined using X-ray crystallographic techniques. 
Data were measured from six crystals grown in microgravity to a resolution of 
1.4 A and the structure has been refined including the contributions from 
hydrogen atoms. The crystals are isomorphous with T3R3f complexes of phenolic 
derivatives as well as with uncomplexed forms. Unlike the structures of 
complexes with phenol, m-cresol, resorcinol, 4'-hydroxyacetanilide, and 
methylparaben, which bind one phenolic derivative molecule per R- or Rf-state 
monomer, two molecules of 4-hydroxybenzamide are bound by each Rf-state monomer. 
The presence of the second guest molecule results in an extensive hydrogen 
bonding network, mediated by water molecules, between the T- and Rf-state 
trimers and adds stability to the formation of the hexamer. The only access to 
these second sites is through three symmetry-related, narrow channels that 
originate on the surface of the T-state trimer. Although the conformation of the 
backbone atoms of the monomers is nearly identical to that of other T3R3f 
hexamers, significant changes are observed in the conformations of side chains 
in the vicinity of the second binding site. The side chain of the T-state A11 
Cys residue, which forms a disulfide bond to A6 Cys in the same monomer, is 
observed in two discrete conformations; two discrete conformations are also 
present for the entire A8 Thr residue in the Rf-state monomer. A procedure is 
also described for an alternate method of interframe scaling and merging 
intensity data from an image plate detector.
