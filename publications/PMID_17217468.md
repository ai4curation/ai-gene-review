Blue-light-dependent photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis is regulated principally 
by the cryptochrome flavin-type photoreceptors, which control hypocotyl growth 
inhibition, cotyledon and leaf expansion, and the expression of light-regulated 
genes. Interestingly the plant hormone cytokinin induces similar responses when 
added exogenously to germinating seedlings, suggesting a link between 
cryptochrome and cytokinin signalling pathways. In this work we explore the 
relationship between cryptochrome and cytokinin signalling pathways in the 
promotion of photomorphogenesis. The effect of exogenously added cytokinins on 
hypocotyl growth inhibition occurs in the dark, and is largely independent and 
additive to that of cryptochromes in blue light, via distinct signalling 
pathways. By contrast, cytokinin-dependent stimulation of anthocyanin 
accumulation occurs only in light, and interacts with the signalling pathway 
downstream of cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) at the level of transcript accumulation of 
anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Mutants in elongated hypocotyl 5 (hy5), a 
downstream intermediate in the CRY1 signalling pathway, show a reduced induction 
of anthocyanin accumulation in blue light by cytokinins, similar to that 
observed for cryptochrome (cry1) mutants. Furthermore cytokinins are shown to 
increase levels of HY5 protein accumulation, suggesting that cytokinins may 
function by reducing HY5 degradation by COP1 (constitutively photomorphogenic 
1). As both cryptochrome and cytokinin signalling pathways increase HY5 protein 
levels, and as HY5 binds to the promoters of anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes to 
stimulate gene expression, it is concluded that the regulation of HY5 protein 
stability represents a point of convergence between cryptochrome and cytokinin 
signalling pathways.
