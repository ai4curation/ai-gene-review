Spatial and timely coordination of cytokinesis is crucial for the maintenance of 
organelle inheritance and genome integrity. The mitotic exit network (MEN) 
pathway controls both the timely initiation of mitotic exit and cytokinesis in 
budding yeast. Here we identified the conserved F-BAR protein Hof1 as a 
substrate of the MEN kinase complex Dbf2-Mob1 during cytokinesis. We show that 
polo-like kinase Cdc5 first phosphorylates Hof1 to allow subsequent 
phosphorylation by Dbf2-Mob1. This releases Hof1 from the septin ring and 
facilitates Hof1 binding to the medial actomyosin ring (AMR), where Hof1 
promotes AMR contraction and membrane ingression. Domain structure analysis 
established that the central, unstructured, region of Hof1, named the ring 
localization sequence (RLS), is sufficient to mediate Hof1's binding to the 
medial ring in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Genetic and functional data 
support a model in which Dbf2-Mob1 regulates Hof1 by inducing domain 
rearrangements, leading to the exposure of the Hof1 RLS domain during telophase.
