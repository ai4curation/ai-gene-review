Nutrient availability is one of the strongest determinants of cell size. When 
grown in rich media, single-celled organisms such as yeast and bacteria can be 
up to twice the size of their slow-growing counterparts. The ability to modulate 
size in a nutrient-dependent manner requires cells to: (1) detect when they have 
reached the appropriate mass for a given growth rate and (2) transmit this 
information to the division apparatus. We report the identification of a 
metabolic sensor that couples nutritional availability to division in Bacillus 
subtilis. A key component of this sensor is an effector, UgtP, which localizes 
to the division site in a nutrient-dependent manner and inhibits assembly of the 
tubulin-like cell division protein FtsZ. This sensor serves to maintain a 
constant ratio of FtsZ rings to cell length regardless of growth rate and 
ensures that cells reach the appropriate mass and complete chromosome 
segregation prior to cytokinesis.
