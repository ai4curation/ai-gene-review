Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a very common inherited 
disease caused by mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 genes characterized by progressive 
enlargement of fluid-filled cysts and loss of renal function [1]. Previous 
studies proposed a role for human polycystin-1 in renal morphogenesis acting as 
a matrix receptor in focal adhesions and for polycystin-2 as a putative calcium 
channel [2, 3]. The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans contains 2 new members of 
the polycystin family: lov-1, the homolog for PKD1; and pkd-2, the homolog for 
PKD2 [4; this paper]. Mutation analysis in C. elegans showed similarly 
compromised male mating behaviors in all single and double lov-1 and pkd-2 
mutants, indicating their participation in a single genetic pathway. Expression 
analysis localized LOV-1 and PKD-2 to the ends of sensory neurons in male tails 
and to the tips of CEM neurons in the head, consistent with functions as chemo- 
or mechanosensors. Human and C. elegans PKD1 and PKD2 homologs, transfected into 
mammalian renal epithelial cells, co-localized with paxillin in focal adhesions 
suggesting function in a single biological pathway. Based on the role of 
polycystins in C. elegans sensory neuron function and the conservation of PKD 
pathways we suggest that polycystins act as sensors of the extracellular 
environment, initiating, via focal adhesion assembly, intracellular transduction 
events in neuronal or morphogenetic processes.
