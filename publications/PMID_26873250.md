Numerous affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and yeast two-hybrid 
screens have each defined thousands of pairwise protein-protein interactions 
(PPIs), most of which are between functionally unrelated proteins. The accuracy 
of these networks, however, is under debate. Here, we present an AP-MS survey of 
the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris together with a critical reanalysis of nine 
published bacterial yeast two-hybrid and AP-MS screens. We have identified 459 
high confidence PPIs from D. vulgaris and 391 from Escherichia coli Compared 
with the nine published interactomes, our two networks are smaller, are much 
less highly connected, and have significantly lower false discovery rates. In 
addition, our interactomes are much more enriched in protein pairs that are 
encoded in the same operon, have similar functions, and are reproducibly 
detected in other physical interaction assays than the pairs reported in prior 
studies. Our work establishes more stringent benchmarks for the properties of 
protein interactomes and suggests that bona fide PPIs much more frequently 
involve protein partners that are annotated with similar functions or that can 
be validated in independent assays than earlier studies suggested.
