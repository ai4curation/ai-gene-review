Telomerase (TERT) activation is a fundamental step in tumorigenesis. By 
maintaining telomere length, telomerase relieves a main barrier on cellular 
lifespan, enabling limitless proliferation driven by oncogenes. The recently 
discovered, highly recurrent mutations in the promoter of TERT are found in over 
50 cancer types, and are the most common mutation in many cancers. 
Transcriptional activation of TERT, via promoter mutation or other mechanisms, 
is the rate-limiting step in production of active telomerase. Although TERT is 
expressed in stem cells, it is naturally silenced upon differentiation. Thus, 
the presence of TERT promoter mutations may shed light on whether a particular 
tumor arose from a stem cell or more differentiated cell type. It is becoming 
clear that TERT mutations occur early during cellular transformation, and 
activate the TERT promoter by recruiting transcription factors that do not 
normally regulate TERT gene expression. This review highlights the fundamental 
and widespread role of TERT promoter mutations in tumorigenesis, including 
recent progress on their mechanism of transcriptional activation. These somatic 
promoter mutations, along with germline variation in the TERT locus also appear 
to have significant value as biomarkers of patient outcome. Understanding the 
precise molecular mechanism of TERT activation by promoter mutation and germline 
variation may inspire novel cancer cell-specific targeted therapies for a large 
number of cancer patients.
