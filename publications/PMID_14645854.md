The conserved histone variant H2AZ has an important role in the regulation of 
gene expression and the establishment of a buffer to the spread of silent 
heterochromatin. How histone variants such as H2AZ are incorporated into 
nucleosomes has been obscure. We have found that Swr1, a Swi2/Snf2-related 
adenosine triphosphatase, is the catalytic core of a multisubunit, 
histone-variant exchanger that efficiently replaces conventional histone H2A 
with histone H2AZ in nucleosome arrays. Swr1 is required for the deposition of 
histone H2AZ at specific chromosome locations in vivo, and Swr1 and H2AZ 
commonly regulate a subset of yeast genes. These findings define a previously 
unknown role for the adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling 
machinery.
