The 'Solute Carrier Family SLC10' consists of six annotated members in humans, 
comprising two bile acid carriers (SLC10A1 and SLC10A2), one steroid sulfate 
transporter (SLC10A6), and three orphan carriers (SLC10A3 to SLC10A5). In this 
study we report molecular characterization and expression analysis of a novel 
member of the SLC10 family, SLC10A7, previously known as C4orf13. SLC10A7 
proteins consist of 340-343 amino acids in humans, mice, rats, and frogs and 
show an overall amino acid sequence identity of >85%. SLC10A7 genes comprise 12 
coding exons and show broad tissue expression pattern. When expressed in Xenopus 
laevis oocytes and HEK293 cells, SLC10A7 was detected in the plasma membrane but 
revealed no transport activity for bile acids and steroid sulfates. By 
immunofluorescence analysis of dual hemagglutinin (HA)- and FLAG-labeled SLC10A7 
proteins in HEK293 cells, we established a topology of 10 transmembrane domains 
with an intracellular cis orientation of the N-terminal and C-terminal ends. 
This topology pattern is clearly different from the seven-transmembrane domain 
topology of the other SLC10 members but similar to hitherto uncharacterized 
non-vertebrate SLC10A7-related proteins. In contrast to the established SLC10 
members, which are restricted to the taxonomic branch of vertebrates, 
SLC10A7-related proteins exist also in yeasts, plants, and bacteria, making 
SLC10A7 taxonomically the most widespread member of this carrier family. 
Vertebrate and bacterial SLC10A7 proteins exhibit >20% sequence identity, which 
is higher than the sequence identity of SLC10A7 to any other member of the SLC10 
carrier family.
