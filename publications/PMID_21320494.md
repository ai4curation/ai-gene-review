While neuronal membranes are proposed to be the primary target of amyloid 
plaques, the effect of phospholipids on fibril formation kinetics and morphology 
has not yet been resolved. We report that interaction of various compositions 
with neuronal mimics promoted different processes of fibril formation: 
negatively charged surfaces increased the lag time and elongation rate in 
thioflavin T assays, while brain total lipid extract had an opposite effect 
compared to that in the absence of lipid. Electron microscopy showed thin and 
elongated fibrils when the peptide was incubated with anionic lipids, while 
neutral surfaces promoted coarse and small fibrils. Circular dichroism and 
thioflavin T assays confirmed an initially unstructured peptide, and measured 
its transition to an aggregated beta-sheet conformation.
