In this review we discuss the influence of chaperones on the general phenomena 
of folding as well as on the specific folding of an individual protein, MHC 
class I. MHC class I maturation is a highly sophisticated process in which the 
folding machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is heavily involved. 
Understanding the MHC class I maturation per se is important since peptides 
loaded onto MHC class I molecules are the base for antigen presentation 
generating immune responses against virus, intracellular bacteria as well as 
tumours. This review discusses the early stages of MHC class I maturation 
regarding BiP and calnexin association, and differences in MHC class I heavy 
chain (HC) interaction with calnexin and calreticulin are highlighted. Late 
stage MHC class I maturation with focus on the dedicated chaperone tapasin is 
also discussed.
