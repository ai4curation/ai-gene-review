The Phtf1 gene encodes a membrane protein abundantly expressed in male germinal 
cells. Using a two-hybrid screening procedure we have identified FEM1B, an 
ortholog of the C. elegans feminization factor 1 (FEM-1), as a binding partner 
for PHTF1. We studied FEM1B expression in the rodent testis and found that Fem1b 
mRNA is present at high levels during meiosis and after, during spermiogenesis, 
in a similar manner to Phtf1 mRNA. Accordingly, Western blot and 
immunofluorescence revealed the presence of PHTF1 and FEM1B in the same cell 
types, and by coimmunoprecipitation we demonstrated the association between 
these proteins. We characterized some aspects of this interaction and showed 
that the ANK domain of FEM1B is necessary for the interaction with the amino 
extremity of PHTF1. Next, we found that FEM1B can bind several intracellular 
organelles and demonstrated that PHTF1 would recruit FEM1B to the endoplasmic 
reticulum membrane. Previous in vitro experiments had suggested that the human 
FEM1B was involved in apoptosis. After comparing expression profiles of FEM1B 
and PHTF1 with apoptotic events occurring in the normal seminiferous tubules, we 
suggest that neither FEM1B nor PHTF1 are directly implicated in apoptosis in 
this tissue.
