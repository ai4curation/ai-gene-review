Interleukin-13 has been implicated as a key factor in asthma, allergy, atopy and 
inflammatory response, establishing the protein as a valuable therapeutic 
target. The high-resolution solution structure of human IL-13 has been 
determined by multidimensional NMR. The resulting structure is consistent with 
previous short-chain left-handed four-helix bundles, where a significant 
similarity in the folding topology between IL-13 and IL-4 was observed. IL-13 
shares a significant overlap in biological function with IL-4, a result of the 
common alpha chain component (IL-4Ralpha) in their respective receptors. Based 
on the available structural and mutational data, an IL-13/IL-4Ralpha model and a 
sequential mechanism for forming the signaling heterodimer is proposed for 
IL-13.
