We have identified a novel serine/threonine kinase, designated ZIP kinase, which 
mediates apoptosis. ZIP kinase contains a leucine zipper structure at its C 
terminus, in addition to a kinase domain at its N terminus. ZIP kinase 
physically binds to ATF4, a member of the activating transcription factor/cyclic 
AMP-responsive element-binding protein (ATF/CREB) family, through interaction 
between their leucine zippers. The leucine zipper domain is necessary for the 
homodimerization of ZIP kinase as well as for the activation of kinase. 
Immunostaining study showed that ZIP kinase localizes in the nuclei. 
Overexpression of intact ZIP kinase but not catalytically inactive kinase 
mutants led to the morphological changes of apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells, 
suggesting that the cell death-inducing activity of ZIP kinase depends on its 
intrinsic kinase activity. Interestingly, the catalytic domain of ZIP kinase is 
closely related to that of death-associated protein kinase (DAP kinase), which 
is a mediator of apoptosis induced by gamma interferon. Therefore, both ZIP and 
DAP kinases represent a novel kinase family, which mediates apoptosis through 
their catalytic activities.
