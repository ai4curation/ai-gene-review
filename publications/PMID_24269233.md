Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) plays important roles both as a bioactive lipid 
molecule and an intermediate of the sphingolipid-to-glycerophospholipid 
metabolic pathway. To identify human acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs) involved in S1P 
metabolism, we cloned all 26 human ACS genes and examined their abilities to 
restore deficient sphingolipid-to-glycerophospholipid metabolism in a yeast 
mutant lacking two ACS genes, FAA1 and FAA4. Here, in addition to the previously 
identified ACSL family members (ACSL1, 3, 4, 5, and 6), we found that ACSVL1, 
ACSVL4, and ACSBG1 also restored metabolism. All 8 ACSs were localized either 
exclusively or partly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where S1P metabolism 
takes place. We previously proposed the entire S1P metabolic pathway from 
results obtained using yeast cells, i.e., S1P is metabolized to 
glycerophospholipids via trans-2-hexadecenal, trans-2-hexadecenoic acid, 
trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA. However, as S1P is not a naturally 
occurring long-chain base 1-phosphate in yeast, the validity of this pathway 
required further verification using mammalian cells. In the present study, we 
treated HeLa cells with the ACS inhibitor triacsin C and found that inhibition 
of ACSs resulted in accumulation of trans-2-hexadecenoic acid as in ACS mutant 
yeast. From these results, we conclude that S1P is metabolized by a common 
pathway in eukaryotes.
