Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) has been suggested to play a role in 
lymphocyte-induced tumor destruction. We now provide evidence that a protein 
responsible for ATP synthesis in mitochondria may also play a physiologic role 
in major histocompatibility complex-independent, lymphocyte-mediated 
cytotoxicity. A 51.5-kD protein (p51.5) bearing structural and immunologic 
characteristics of the beta subunit of H+ transporting ATP synthase (E.C. 
3.6.1.34, beta-H+ATPase, published molecular mass of 51.6 kD) was detected on 
the plasma membrane of three different human tumor cell lines studied. 
NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of purified p51.5 from K562 tumor 
cells revealed 100% homology of 16 residues identified in the first 21 positions 
to the known sequence of human mitochondrial beta-H+ ATPase. Antibody directed 
against a 21-mer peptide in the ATP binding region of beta-H+ ATPase (anti-beta) 
reacted with only one band on Western blots of whole tumor extracts and tumor 
membrane extracts suggesting that the antiserum reacts with a single species of 
protein. Anti-beta reacted with the cell membranes of tumor cells as determined 
by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry and immunoprecipitated a 51.5-kD 
protein from surface-labeled neoplastic cells (but not human erythrocytes and 
lymphocytes). Purified p51.5 bound to human lymphocytes and inhibited natural 
killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, anti-beta treatment of the 
K562 and A549 tumor cell lines inhibited NK (by > 95%) and interleukin 
2-activated killer (LAK) cell (by 75%) cytotoxicity, respectively. Soluble p51.5 
upon binding to lymphocytes retained its reactivity to anti-beta suggesting that 
the ATP binding domain and the lymphocyte-receptor binding domain reside in 
distinct regions of the ligand. These results suggest that beta-H+ ATPase or a 
nearly identical molecule is an important ligand in the effector phase (rather 
than the recognition phase) of a cytolytic pathway used by naive NK and LAK 
cells.
