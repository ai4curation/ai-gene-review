Smad proteins are critical intracellular mediators of the transforming growth 
factor-beta, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), and activin signaling. Upon 
ligand binding, the receptor-associated R-Smads are phosphorylated by the active 
type I receptor serine/threonine kinases. The phosphorylated R-Smads then form 
heteromeric complexes with Smad4, translocate into the nucleus, and interact 
with various transcription factors to regulate the expression of downstream 
genes. Interaction of Smad proteins with cellular partners in the cytoplasm and 
nucleus is a critical mechanism by which the activities and expression of the 
Smad proteins are modulated. Here we report a novel step of regulation of the 
R-Smad function at the inner nuclear membrane through a physical interaction 
between the integral inner nuclear membrane protein MAN1 and R-Smads. MAN1, 
through the RNA recognition motif, associates with R-Smads but not Smad4 at the 
inner nuclear membrane in a ligand-independent manner. Overexpression of MAN1 
results in inhibition of R-Smad phosphorylation, heterodimerization with Smad4 
and nuclear translocation, and repression of transcriptional activation of the 
TGFbeta, BMP2, and activin-responsive promoters. This repression of TGFbeta, 
BMP2, and activin signaling is dependent on the MAN1-Smad interaction because a 
point mutation that disrupts this interaction abolishes the transcriptional 
repression by MAN1. Thus, MAN1 represents a new class of R-Smad regulators and 
defines a previously unrecognized regulatory step at the nuclear periphery.
