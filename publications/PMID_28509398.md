Bacterial Type I restriction-modification (R-M) systems present a major barrier 
to foreign DNA entering the bacterial cell. The temperate phage P1 packages 
several proteins into the virion that protect the phage DNA from host 
restriction. Isogenic P1 deletion mutants were used to reconstitute the 
previously described restriction phenotypes associated with darA and darB. While 
P1ΔdarA and P1ΔdarB produced the expected phenotypes, deletions of adjacent 
genes hdf and ddrA also produced darA-like phenotypes and deletion of ulx 
produced a darB-like phenotype, implicating several new proteins of previously 
unknown function in the P1 dar antirestriction system. Interestingly, disruption 
of ddrB decreased P1's sensitivity to EcoB and EcoK restriction. Proteomic 
analysis of purified virions suggests that packaging of antirestriction 
components into P1 virions follows a distinct pathway that begins with the 
incorporation of DarA and Hdf and concludes with DarB and Ulx. Electron 
microscopy analysis showed that hdf and darA mutants also produce abnormally 
high proportions of virions with aberrant small heads, which suggests Hdf and 
DarA play a role in capsid morphogenesis. The P1 antirestriction system is more 
complex than previously realized and is comprised of multiple proteins including 
DdrA, DdrB, Hdf, and Ulx in addition to DarA and DarB.
