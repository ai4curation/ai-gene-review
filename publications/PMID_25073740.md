The TORC1 signaling pathway plays a major role in the control of cell growth and 
response to stress. Here we demonstrate that the SEA complex physically 
interacts with TORC1 and is an important regulator of its activity. During 
nitrogen starvation, deletions of SEA complex components lead to Tor1 kinase 
delocalization, defects in autophagy, and vacuolar fragmentation. TORC1 
inactivation, via nitrogen deprivation or rapamycin treatment, changes cellular 
levels of SEA complex members. We used affinity purification and chemical 
cross-linking to generate the data for an integrative structure modeling 
approach, which produced a well-defined molecular architecture of the SEA 
complex and showed that the SEA complex comprises two regions that are 
structurally and functionally distinct. The SEA complex emerges as a platform 
that can coordinate both structural and enzymatic activities necessary for the 
effective functioning of the TORC1 pathway.
