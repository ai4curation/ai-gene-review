Nickel exposure is associated with tumors of the respiratory tract such as lung 
and nasal cancers, acting through still-uncharacterized mechanisms. 
Understanding the molecular basis of nickel-induced carcinogenesis requires 
unraveling the mode and the effects of Ni(II) binding to its intracellular 
targets. A possible Ni(II)-binding protein and a potential focus for cancer 
treatment is hNDRG1, a protein induced by Ni(II) through the hypoxia response 
pathway, whose expression correlates with higher cancer aggressiveness and 
resistance to chemotherapy in lung tissue. The protein sequence contains a 
unique C-terminal sequence of 83 residues (hNDRG1*C), featuring a 
three-times-repeated decapeptide, involved in metal binding, lipid interaction 
and post-translational phosphorylation. In the present work, the biochemical and 
biophysical characterization of unmodified hNDRG1*C was performed. Bioinformatic 
analysis assigned it to the family of the intrinsically disordered regions and 
the absence of secondary and tertiary structure was experimentally proven by 
circular dichroism and NMR. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed the 
occurrence of a Ni(II)-binding event with micromolar affinity. Detailed 
information on the Ni(II)-binding site and on the residues involved was obtained 
in an extensive NMR study, revealing an octahedral paramagnetic metal 
coordination that does not cause any major change of the protein backbone, which 
is coherent with CD analysis. hNDRG1*C was found in a monomeric form by 
light-scattering experiments, while the full-length hNDRG1 monomer was found in 
equilibrium between the dimer and tetramer, both in solution and in human cell 
lines. The results are the first essential step for understanding the cellular 
function of hNDRG1*C at the molecular level, with potential future applications 
to clarify its role and the role of Ni(II) in cancer development.
