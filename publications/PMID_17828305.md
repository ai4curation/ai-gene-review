The cytoplasmic domain of the common beta-chain (betac) of the 
granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/interleukin-3 
(IL-3)/IL-5 receptor contains a membrane proximal region that is sufficient to 
mediate ligand-dependent mitogenic activity. Within this region two motifs, 
designated as box 1 and box 2, are highly conserved among members of the 
cytokine receptor superfamily. Whereas box 1 is required for the recruitment and 
phosphorylation of Janus kinase-2, the function of box 2 remains largely 
unknown. Here, we report the identification of a novel transmembrane protein 
(common beta-chain associated protein (CBAP)) which directly associated with 
betac via the box 2 motif. Interestingly, such an association only occurred in 
the absence of GM-CSF in vivo. Ectopic overexpression of CBAP triggered 
apoptosis of factor-dependent cells via mitochondrial dysfunction, which could 
be inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression. Reduced expression of endogenous CBAP by 
small interfering RNA did not interfere GM-CSF-activated signaling molecules, 
but such treatment significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by GM-CSF 
deprivation, but not other death stimuli. Domain mapping studies indicated that 
one apoptogenic domain of CBAP correlated with its ability to interact with 
betac. Taken together, these results suggest that CBAP modulates 
GM-CSF-deprivation-induced apoptosis possibly via a novel mechanism involving 
interaction with an un-liganded betac molecule.
