To identify candidate genes for Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome, we have made 
use of a set of cosmids that map to 8q13.3, which has previously been shown to 
be involved in this syndrome. These cosmids were used as genomic clones in the 
attempts to isolate corresponding cDNAs using a modified hybrid selection 
technique. cDNAs from the region were identified and used to search for sequence 
similarity in human or other species. One cDNA clone was found to have 89% 
sequence similarity to the bovine B22 subunit of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, 
a mitochondrial protein in the respiratory electron transport chain. Given the 
history of other mitochondrial mutations being involved in hearing loss 
syndromes, this gene should be considered a strong candidate for involvement in 
BOR.
