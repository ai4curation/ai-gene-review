The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a major role in neuronal dysfunction and 
neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease. However, the signal transduction mechanisms 
involved in Abeta-induced neuronal dysfunction remain to be fully elucidated. A 
major current unknown is the identity of the protein receptor(s) involved in 
neuronal Abeta binding. Using phage display of peptide libraries, we have 
identified a number of peptides that bind Abeta and are homologous to neuronal 
receptors putatively involved in Abeta interactions. We report here on a 
cysteine-linked cyclic heptapeptide (denominated cSP5) that binds Abeta with 
high affinity and is homologous to the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of 
several members of the Frizzled (Fz) family of Wnt receptors. Based on this 
homology, we investigated the interaction between Abeta and Fz. The results show 
that Abeta binds to the Fz cysteine-rich domain at or in close proximity to the 
Wnt-binding site and inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. 
Interestingly, the cSP5 peptide completely blocks Abeta binding to Fz and 
prevents inhibition of Wnt signaling. These results indicate that the 
Abeta-binding site in Fz is homologous to cSP5 and that this is a relevant 
target for Abeta-instigated neurotoxicity. Furthermore, they suggest that 
blocking the interaction of Abeta with Fz might lead to novel therapeutic 
approaches to prevent neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer disease.
