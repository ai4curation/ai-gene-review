Human lens beta-crystallin contains four acidic (betaA1-->betaA4) and three 
basic (betaB1-->betaB3) subunits. They oligomerize in the lens, but it is 
uncertain which subunits are involved in the oligomerization. We used a 
two-hybrid system to detect protein-protein interactions systematically. 
Proteins were also expressed for some physicochemical studies. The results 
indicate that all acidic-basic pairs (betaA-betaB) except betaA4-betaBs pairs 
show strong hetero-molecular interactions. For acidic or basic pairs, only two 
pairs (betaA1-betaA1 and betaA3-betaA3) show strong self-association. betaA2 and 
betaA4 show very weak self-association, which arises from their low solubility. 
Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows enormous protein aggregates in betaA2- or 
betaA4-crystallin transfected cells. However, coexpression with 
betaB2-crystallin decreased both the number and size of aggregates. Circular 
dichroism indicates subtle differences in conformation among beta-crystallins 
that may have contributed to the differences in interactions.

Abstract

Human lens β-crystallin contains four acidic (βA1 → βA4) and three basic (βB1 → βB3) subunits. They oligomerize in the lens, but it is uncertain which subunits are involved in the oligomerization. We used a two-hybrid system to detect protein–protein interactions systematically. Proteins were also expressed for some physicochemical studies. The results indicate that all acidic–basic pairs (βA–βB) except βA4-βBs pairs show strong hetero-molecular interactions. For acidic or basic pairs, only two pairs (βA1–βA1 and βA3–βA3) show strong self-association. βA2 and βA4 show very weak self-association, which arises from their low solubility. Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows enormous protein aggregates in βA2- or βA4-crystallin transfected cells. However, coexpression with βB2-crystallin decreased both the number and size of aggregates. Circular dichroism indicates subtle differences in conformation among β-crystallins that may have contributed to the differences in interactions.

1. Introduction

Human lens proteins can be grouped into the α-crystallin family and the β/γ-crystallin superfamily [ 1 ]. α-Crystallin is a polymer consisting of two subunits, αA and αB. The β/γ-crystallin superfamily comprises oligomeric β-crystallin and monomeric γ-crystallin; they are more heterogeneous than α-crystallin, each containing many subunits: seven in β-crystallin and six in γ-crystallin. The seven isoforms of β-crystallin are divided into four acidic (βA1, βA2, βA3, and βA4) and three basic (βB1, βB2, and βB3) polypeptide subunits, which associate to either homo- or hetero-oligomers with sizes ranging from 50 to 200 kDa in the lenses [ 2 ]. βA1 and βA3 are isoforms having identical sequences except for an additional 17 amino acids at the N-terminus for βA3. How oligomers are formed in vivo is not known, but detection of dimers in some β-crystallins in vitro may imply that the dimers are building blocks for oligomerization [ 3 – 5 ]. Although many studies on the dimerization and oligomerization of some β-crystallins have been reported [ 3 , 5 – 7 ], we do not know whether all β-crystallins form dimers or which dimers, homo or hetero, are more likely to form. A systematic study of the most heterogeneous β-crystallin family should be beneficial in the understanding of crystallin subunit interactions, which would allow further study of the more complex oligomerization in the eye lens. Dimerization or subunit interaction can be studied by many methods; previous studies with a two-hybrid system assay indicate that it is ideal for protein–protein interaction [ 4 , 8 – 10 ]. Such interactions are usually studied by some spectroscopic measurements, requiring time-consuming protein expression and purification processes. The two-hybrid system obviates this requirement and gives quantitative estimates of interactions. In the present study, we subcloned all of the seven β-crystallins to the two-hybrid system vectors and investigated the interactions. The results indicate that hetero pairs (acidic–basic) of β-crystallins interact strongly but that homo pairs (acidic–acidic or basic–basic) of β-crystallins interact less strongly. When we expressed all seven β-crystallins and subjected them to some biophysical studies, we found some differences, especially in conformation, among them.

4. Discussion

The significant increase in SEAP activity for some acidic–acidic pairs and most hetero acidic–basic pairs of β-crystallins indicates they interact strongly. We do not know whether those β-crystallins expressed in the two-hybrid system are dimers or oligomers, but we tend to believe that β-crystallins with weak interactions are in a dimeric state and those with strong interactions are in an oligomeric state. The results are consistent with a previous report that βA3-crystallin, which shows strong self-interaction, formed homo-oligomers, and that the βA1-βB1 pair also shows strong interactions and formed hetero-oligomers [ 5 ]. Hetero-oligomerization is believed to result from subunit exchange from two different dimers, such as between homodimeric βB2- and βA3-crystallins [ 7 ]. βA1- and βA3-crystallin are the same polypeptide except that βA3-crystallin has an additional 17 amino acid residues in the N-terminus. Thus, it is not surprising that their far- and near-UV CD spectra are almost the same. However, βA3 has more SEAP activity than βA1-crystallin, suggesting involvement of the 17 AA segment in the self-association. This is consistent with the report that the N-terminal extension of βB1-crystallin has a role in higher assembly [ 18 ]. The high self-association for βA1-, βA3-, and βB3-crystallin also translated to high hetero-association for βA1-βB3 and βA3-βB3. The extremely small increases in SEAP activity of βA2- and βA4-crystallins arise from their low protein solubility; protein expression experiments indicate that both βA2- and βA4-crystallin have a very low solubility, and confocal microscopy shows the presence of large protein aggregates. The insolubility of βA2- and βA4-crystallin most likely arises from misfolding. Co-expression with the basic β-crystallins increased SEAP activity and prevented insolubilization of βA2-crystallin. However, this phenomenon was not so prominent for βA4-crystallin; co-expression with basic β-crystallins did not increase SEAP activity or decrease protein aggregates as much as for βA2-crystallin. The results are consistent with a previous report that βB1-crystallin enhances solubility of βA4-crystallin [ 19 ]. The ability of βB2- or βB1-crystallin to solubilize βA2-or βA4-crystallin is not unique among lens crystallins; αA-crystallin increases the solubility of αB-crystallin [ 13 ]. The mechanism underlying these effects is likely to be subunit exchange [ 7 , 20 ].

In human lenses, the earlier studies of size-exclusion chromatography separated β-crystallins into three fractions: β 1 -,β 2 -, and β 3 -crystallin with molecular mass ranging from 50 to 200 kDa [ 21 , 22 ]; each fraction contains at least two major polypeptide subunits with molecular mass of 24 and 27 kDa. A later report designated the three fractions as β H -, β L1 -, and β L2 -crystallin [ 23 ]; β H -crystallin contains βA3/βA1, βA4, βB1, and βB2, and β L1 - and β L2 -crystallin fractions contain βA3/βA1, βA4, βB1, βB2, and βB3. It seems surprising that each of the three fractions contains the same subunits except that β H -crystallin fraction does not have βB3 subunit. We now know that β-crystallin includes seven gene products; it is logical to assume that β-crystallin subunits with stronger interactions tend to become larger oligomers. In the bovine lenses, the corresponding three fractions are also designed as βH-, βL 1 -, and βL 2 -crystallin; both βH- and βL 1 -crystallin contain βA3 and βA4 subunits, and βL 2 -crystallin contains βB2 and βB3 subunits [ 2 ]. This study indicates that the acidic β-crystallin subunits are more prone to higher oligomerization than the basic β-crystallin subunits. This is consistent with the results of our two-hybrid system assays and expression experiments; acidic βA1- and βA3-crystallin show higher activity than the basic β-crystallins. It is not known why βA2 subunit was not detected in any of the three fractions in either human or bovine lenses.

The nature of the interaction between β-crystallins, as detected by the two-hybrid system, was demonstrated partially from domain interactions of β-sheets comprising many β-strands [ 11 ]. The domain interaction is similar to the inter-molecular interaction in αA-crystallin [ 24 ] or αB-crystallin [ 25 ] and the intra-molecular interaction in γD-crystallin [ 26 ]. All β-crystallins have high content of β-sheet conformation, facilitating domain association. In addition, a charge or hydro-phobic interaction may also contribute to the overall interaction. Two pairs (βA1-βB3 and βA3-βB3) stand apart from the others, showing more than a 120-fold increase in SEAP activity; the β-sheet domain interaction alone cannot account for this large increase.

CD data indicate there may be a subtle difference in the structure or conformation among β-crystallins. The far-UV CD spectrum of βB1-crystallin appears to differ from other basic β-crystallins and is not similar to acidic β-crystallins. In fact, the near-UV CD spectrum of βB1-crystallin also differs from that of other basic β-crystallins. Near-UV CD signal arises from electronic transitions of the three aromatic acids (Phe, Trp, and Tyr) and reflects the conformational environment of individual aromatic amino acids and thus protein tertiary structure. The great difference of the near-UV CD between βB1-and βB2-crystallin can be attributed to their different tertiary structures as manifested by the X-ray crystallographic data. The crystallographic structures of only two human lens β-crystallins have been reported: truncated βB1-crystallin (PDB id; 1OKI) [ 18 ] and wild-type βB2-crystallin (1YTQ) [ 27 ]. The wild type βB1-crystallin could not be crystallized. The crystallographic structures of both β-crystallins consist of four Greek key motifs: two motifs in the N -terminal domain and two motifs in the C-terminal domain. The βB2-crystallin dimer is formed by domain swapping of two subunits; the N-terminal domain of one subunit assembles with the C-terminal domain of the other subunit, but truncated βB1-crystallin domains are paired intramolecularly, and the domain–domain interface is buried. The βB1-crystallin dimer is formed through a different interface, and the oligomer is formed by dimer–dimer interaction. The structural differences in βB1-crystallin may underlie the observations of different patterns for this crystallin in CD spectra and FPLC elution profiles.

In conclusion, our studies demonstrate the presence of homo- and hetero-molecular interactions among the β-crystallins. These interactions are responsible for the oligomerization observed in the lens β-crystallins; posttranslational modifications or site-specific mutations [ 4 , 28 , 29 ] are likely to disrupt the interactions and thus lens structure.
