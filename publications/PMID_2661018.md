The yeast KAR2 gene was isolated by complementation of a mutation that blocks 
nuclear fusion. The predicted KAR2 protein sequence is most homologous to 
mammalian BiP/GRP78 and has several structural features in common with it: a 
functional secretory signal sequence, a yeast endoplasmic reticulum retention 
signal (HDEL) at the carboxyl terminus, and the absence of potential N-linked 
glycosylation sites. Moreover KAR2 is regulated like BiP/GRP78: the level of 
mRNA is increased by drug treatments and mutations that cause accumulation of 
secretory precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, unlike BiP/GRP78, 
KAR2 is also regulated by heat shock. Deletion of the KAR2 gene generated a 
recessive lethal mutation, showing that BiP/GRP78 function is required for cell 
viability.
