The yeast GCN5 (yGCN5) transcriptional coactivator functions as a histone 
acetyltransferase (HAT) to promote transcriptional activation. Here, we present 
the high resolution crystal structure of the HAT domain of yGCN5 and probe the 
functional importance of a conserved glutamate residue. The structure reveals a 
central protein core associated with AcCoA binding that appears to be 
structurally conserved among a superfamily of N-acetyltransferases, including 
yeast histone acetyltransferase 1 and Serratia marcescens aminoglycoside 
3-N-acetyltransferase. A pronounced cleft lying above this core, and flanked by 
N- and C-terminal regions that show no sequence conservation within 
N-acetyltransferase enzymes, is implicated by cross-species conservation and 
mutagenesis studies to be a site for histone substrate binding and catalysis. 
Located at the bottom of this cleft is a conserved glutamate residue (E173) that 
is in position to play an important catalytic role in histone acetylation. 
Functional analysis of an E173Q mutant yGCN5 protein implicates glutamate 173 to 
function as a general base for catalysis. Together, a correlation of the yGCN5 
structure with functionally debilitating yGCN5 mutations provides a paradigm for 
understanding the structure/function relationships of the growing number of 
transcriptional regulators that function as histone acetyltransferase enzymes.
