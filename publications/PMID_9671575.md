Numerous human syndromes are the result of abnormal cranial neural crest 
development. One group of such defects, referred to as CATCH-22 (cardiac 
defects, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate, hypocalcemia, 
associated with chromosome 22 microdeletion) syndrome, exhibit craniofacial and 
cardiac defects resulting from abnormal development of the third and fourth 
neural crest-derived branchial arches and branchial arch arteries. Mice 
harboring a null mutation of the endothelin-1 gene (Edn1), which is expressed in 
the epithelial layer of the branchial arches and encodes for the endothelin-1 
(ET-1) signaling peptide, have a phenotype similar to CATCH-22 syndrome with 
aortic arch defects and craniofacial abnormalities. Here we show that the basic 
helix-loop-helix transcription factor, dHAND, is expressed in the mesenchyme 
underlying the branchial arch epithelium. Further, dHAND and the related gene, 
eHAND, are downregulated in the branchial and aortic arches of Edn1-null 
embryos. In mice homozygous null for the dHAND gene, the first and second arches 
are hypoplastic secondary to programmed cell death and the third and fourth 
arches fail to form. Molecular analysis revealed that most markers of the 
neural-crest-derived components of the branchial arch are expressed in 
dHAND-null embryos, suggesting normal migration of neural crest cells. However, 
expression of the homeobox gene, Msx1, was undetectable in the mesenchyme of 
dHAND-null branchial arches but unaffected in the limb bud, consistent with the 
separable regulatory elements of Msx1 previously described. Together, these data 
suggest a model in which epithelial secretion of ET-1 stimulates mesenchymal 
expression of dHAND, which regulates Msx1 expression in the growing, distal 
branchial arch. Complete disruption of this molecular pathway results in growth 
failure of the branchial arches from apoptosis, while partial disruption leads 
to defects of branchial arch derivatives, similar to those seen in CATCH-22 
syndrome.
