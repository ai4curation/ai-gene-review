The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a proven model organism for 
elucidating conserved eukaryotic biology, but to date its extracellular vesicle 
(EV) biology is understudied. Here, we show yeast transmit information through 
the extracellular medium that increases survival when confronted with heat 
stress and demonstrate the EV-enriched samples mediate this thermotolerance 
transfer. These samples contain vesicle-like particles that are exosome-sized 
and disrupting exosome biogenesis by targeting endosomal sorting complexes 
required for transport (ESCRT) machinery inhibits thermotolerance transfer. We 
find that Bro1, the yeast ortholog of the human exosome biomarker ALIX, is 
present in EV samples, and use Bro1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
to track EV release and uptake by endocytosis. Proteomics analysis reveals that 
heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family proteins are enriched in EV samples that 
provide thermotolerance. We confirm the presence of the HSP70 ortholog 
stress-seventy subunit A2 (Ssa2) in EV samples and find that mutant yeast cells 
lacking SSA2 produce EVs but they fail to transfer thermotolerance. We conclude 
that Ssa2 within exosomes shared between yeast cells contributes to 
thermotolerance. Through this work, we advance Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an 
emerging model organism for elucidating molecular details of eukaryotic EV 
biology and establish a role for exosomes in heat stress and proteostasis that 
seems to be evolutionarily conserved.
