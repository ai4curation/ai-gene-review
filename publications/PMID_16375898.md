Actin has been reported to enhance the superoxide-generating activity of 
neutrophil NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system and to interact with p47phox, a 
regulatory subunit of the oxidase. In the present study, we searched for an 
actin-binding site in p47phox by far-western blotting and blot-binding assays 
using truncated forms of p47phox. The amino-acid sequence 319-337 was identified 
as an actin-binding site, and a synthetic peptide of this sequence bound to 
actin. The sequence shows no homology to other known actin-binding motifs. It is 
located in the autoinhibitory region of p47phox and includes Ser-328, a 
phosphorylation site essential for unmasking. Although a phosphorylation-mimetic 
p47phox mutant bound to actin with a lower affinity than the wild type, the same 
mutant interacted with filamentous actin more efficiently than the wild type. A 
mutant peptide p47phox (319-337, Ser328Glu) bound to filamentous actin more 
tightly than to monomer actin. These results suggest that p47phox moves to 
cortical actin when it becomes unmasked in the cells.
