Abstract

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation was used to engineer CD8 molecules so that CD8αα and CD8αβ dimers can be independently visualized on the surface of a T cell during antigen recognition. Using this approach, we show that CD8αα is recruited to the immunological synapse almost as well as CD8αβ, but because the kinase Lck associates preferentially with CD8αβ in lipid rafts, CD8αα is the weaker co-receptor. During recognition of the strong CD8αα ligand H2-TL, CD8αα is preferentially recruited. Thus, recruitment of the two CD8 species correlates with their relative binding to the available ligands, rather than with the co-receptor functions of the CD8 species.

Introduction

CD8 is the co-receptor for major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-restricted recognition of antigen. It binds directly to non-polymorphic regions of the MHC-I heavy chain. Through its cytoplasmic tail, CD8 interacts with the Src-family protein tyrosine kinase Lck ( Veillette et al, 1988 ; Barber et al, 1989 ). Antigen recognition by the T-cell receptor (TCR) brings CD8 and therefore Lck into close proximity with the TCR ( Zamoyska, 1998 ; Yachi et al, 2005 ), allowing Lck to phosphorylate elements of the TCR–CD3 complex and to precipitate the signalling cascade. CD8 exists on the T-cell surface in two isoforms, CD8αα and CD8αβ. CD8αβ is expressed by mature T cells and developing thymocytes, whereas CD8αα is expressed in certain subsets of T cells, including TCRαβ-expressing gut intraepithelial cells, some γδ T cells and some natural killer and dendritic cells. Both CD8 dimers are expressed on CD8αβ + intraepithelial cells, and there is evidence for transient upregulation of CD8αα on activated CD8αβ + T cells (reviewed by Cheroutre & Lambolez, 2008 ).

CD8αβ is a much stronger co-receptor than CD8αα, the expression of CD8β enhancing TCR sensitivity about 100-fold over cells expressing only CD8α ( Karaki et al, 1992 ; Renard et al, 1996 ; Yachi et al, 2005 ), and indeed CD8αα might be a negative regulator of T-cell activation ( Cheroutre & Lambolez, 2008 ). CD8β is reported to mediate interactions between the CD8 and the TCR–CD3 complex ( Doucey et al, 2003 ). Because the affinities of the two isoforms for MHC-I molecules are similar ( Garcia et al, 1996 ; Kern et al, 1999 ; Wang et al, 2009 ), and because Lck interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of CD8α, the likely mechanism for this difference in activity is the location of CD8αβ in membrane rafts. The CD8β molecule, similar to the other T-cell co-receptor CD4, but unlike CD8α, can be palmitoylated, resulting in its localization in lipid rafts ( Arcaro et al, 2000 , 2001 ). Lck is also targeted to rafts through palmitoylation and myristoylation ( Rodgers et al, 1994 ), so that the presence of Lck and CD8αβ in lipid rafts provides both a motif and an opportunity for their interaction. CD8α also mediates interaction with another lipid raft resident molecule, LAT ( Bosselut et al, 1999 ).

At present there are few or no data on the differential roles of CD8αα and CD8αβ during antigen recognition. The findings noted above indicate that CD8αβ plus lipid rafts should be strongly recruited to the immunological synapse (IS). On the other hand, if CD8αα and CD8αβ bind equally well to MHC-I, there is no a priori reason why CD8αα should not be recruited to the IS as strongly as CD8αβ, even without lipid rafts. Moreover, there is some doubt about the relevance of lipid rafts in the formation of the IS ( Bunnell et al, 2002 ). For this reason, we decided to test the differences, if any, that are present in the molecular dynamics of CD8αα and αβ on the surface of T cells before and during stimulation.

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) allows identification of molecules that interact with each other in live cells. In this technique, the two proteins of interest are expressed as chimaeras with either the N-terminal or C-terminal half of a green fluorescent protein-related molecule. If the two proteins interact, the two halves of the fluorescent protein (FP) refold to form a complete FP ( Hu et al, 2002 ; Hu & Kerppola, 2003 ). By using halves from different FPs, different spectra are obtained, allowing multicolour experiments to determine how and where one protein interacts with two different partners ( Hu & Kerppola, 2003 ; Shyu et al, 2006 ). We adapted this technique to CD8, such that CD8αα and CD8αβ would be separately visible on the same cell. We then used fluorescence deconvolution microscopy to follow CD8αα and αβ dimers to investigate whether there is differential recruitment of the two forms of CD8 to the IS during antigen recognition.

Methods

DNA constructs and gene expression. CD8α1 (methionine at residue 78) was generated from the CD8α2 (Val78) construct by single point mutation. BiFC fragments CC155, Cr173 and Vn173 ( Hu et al, 2002 ; Hu & Kerppola, 2003 ) were fused to the C terminus of CD8α2, CD8α1 and CD8β, respectively, with spacers between the proteins to allow proper folding and flexibility ( Yachi et al, 2005 ). Mutations in the MHC-I-binding sites of CD8 were as follows: CD8α1 N107A to make CD8αα′ . In the CD8αα structure, N107 on one α-subunit interacts with residues M228, E229 and L230 of K b , and in the other α-subunit it interacts with K b E222 ( Devine et al, 2002 ). CD8β S101A was made for CD8αβ′ ( Devine et al, 2006 ). S101 interacts with residues T225, M228 and L230 of K b ( Wang et al, 2009 ). Constructs cloned in pLN1 retroviral expression vector were transduced into hybridomas expressing the OT-I TCR but not CD8 ( Yachi et al, 2005 , 2006 ). Expressors were selected by FACS, sorted and cloned. The following antibodies were used: anti-Ly2.1 (that is, anti-CD8α1; clone 49-31.1, mouse IgG 3 ), anti-Ly2.2 (that is, anti-CD8α2; clone AD4(15), mouse IgM, Cedarlane) and anti-CD8β (YTS156.7.7, rat IgG 2b , BioLegend).

Imaging. Fluorescence imaging was performed on a Marianas system (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Santa Monica, CA). To avoid crosstalk, images were acquired sequentially using the following filter sets: Cerulean, Ex: 430/25 nm, Em: 470/30 nm; Venus, Ex: 510/20 nm, Em: 550/50 nm, Cy5 or APC Ex: 622/36 nm, Em: 700/75 nm ( Zal & Gascoigne, 2004 ; Yachi et al, 2005 , 2006 ). Image analysis was performed using the Slidebook software. After background subtraction, the IS (or cap) and a non-IS (or non-cap) area were delimited manually on the image. Average fluorescence intensities for both areas were measured, and the area intensity ratio (AR)= I synapse / I non-synapse was calculated for each channel. The percentage of increase was then calculated as ((AR Venus /AR Cerluean )−1) × 100. This parameter defines the preferential recruitment of one fluorophore compared with the other in the region of interest, independently from their actual concentration or fluorescence intensity. The −1 term was introduced so that preferential recruitment of Cerulean (CD8αα) or Venus (CD8αβ) is easily identified by a negative or a positive value, respectively.

Statistics. The mean difference hypothesis of Student's two-tailed t -test assuming different variances and a confidence level of 95% was performed using Microcal Origin.
