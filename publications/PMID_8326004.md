We have identified a novel 69-kD peptide autoantigen (ICA69) associated with 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) by screening a human islet lambda 
gt11 cDNA expression library with cytoplasmic islet cell antibody positive sera 
from relatives of IDDM patients who progressed to the overt disease. The deduced 
open reading frame of the ICA69 cDNA predicts a 483-amino acid protein. ICA69 
shows no nucleotide or amino acid sequence relation to any known sequence in 
GenBank, except for two short regions of similarity with BSA. The ICA69 cDNA 
probe hybridizes with a 2-kb mRNA in poly(A+) RNA from human pancreas, brain, 
heart, thyroid, and kidney, but not with skeletal muscle, placenta, spleen, or 
ovary. Expression of ICA69 was also detected in beta cells and cell lines, as 
well as in tumoral tissue of islet cell origin. The native ICA69 molecule 
migrates to 69 kD in SDS-PAGE as detected with specific antibodies. Serum 
samples from relatives of IDDM patients specifically reacted with 
affinity-purified recombinant ICA69 on Western blotting. The structural gene for 
ICA69 was designated ICA1. A homologue in the mouse, designated Ica-1 was mapped 
to the proximal end of chromosome 6 (within 6 cM of the Met protooncogene). 
ICA69 adds a novel autoantigen to the family of identified islet target 
molecules, and by the manner of its identification and characterization large 
amounts of antigen are available for development of quantitative, convenient 
predictive assays for autoantibodies and analysis of the role of this molecule 
in diabetes autoimmunity, as well as its physiologic function.
