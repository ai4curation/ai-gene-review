Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a major mitogen for connective tissue 
cells and certain other cell types. It is a dimeric molecule consisting of 
disulfide-bonded, structurally similar A- and B-polypeptide chains, which 
combine to homo- and heterodimers. The PDGF isoforms exert their cellular 
effects by binding to and activating two structurally related protein tyrosine 
kinase receptors, denoted the alpha-receptor and the beta-receptor. Activation 
of PDGF receptors leads to stimulation of cell growth, but also to changes in 
cell shape and motility; PDGF induces reorganization of the actin filament 
system and stimulates chemotaxis, i.e., a directed cell movement toward a 
gradient of PDGF. In vivo, PDGF has important roles during the embryonic 
development as well as during wound healing. Moreover, overactivity of PDGF has 
been implicated in several pathological conditions. The sis oncogene of simian 
sarcoma virus (SSV) is related to the B-chain of PDGF, and SSV transformation 
involves autocrine stimulation by a PDGF-like molecule. Similarly, 
overproduction of PDGF may be involved in autocrine and paracrine growth 
stimulation of human tumors. Overactivity of PDGF has, in addition, been 
implicated in nonmalignant conditions characterized by an increased cell 
proliferation, such as atherosclerosis and fibrotic conditions. This review 
discusses structural and functional properties of PDGF and PDGF receptors, the 
mechanism whereby PDGF exerts its cellular effects, and the role of PDGF in 
normal and diseased tissues.
