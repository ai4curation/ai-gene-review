Pathogens attack host cells by deploying toxins that perturb core host 
processes. Recent findings from the nematode C. elegans and other metazoans 
indicate that surveillance or "effector-triggered" pathways monitor functioning 
of these core processes and mount protective responses when they are perturbed. 
Despite a growing number of examples of surveillance immunity, the signaling 
components remain poorly defined. Here, we show that CEBP-2, the C. elegans 
ortholog of mammalian CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein gamma, is a key player in 
surveillance immunity. We show that CEBP-2 acts together with the bZIP 
transcription factor ZIP-2 in the protective response to translational block by 
P. aeruginosa Exotoxin A as well as perturbations of other processes. CEBP-2 
serves to limit pathogen burden, promote survival upon P. aeruginosa infection, 
and also promote survival upon Exotoxin A exposure. These findings may have 
broad implications for the mechanisms by which animals sense pathogenic attack 
and mount protective responses.
