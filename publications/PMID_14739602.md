The human Siva gene is localized to chromosome 14q32-33 and gives rise to the 
full-length predominant form, Siva-1 and a minor alternate form, Siva-2 that 
appears to lack the proapoptotic properties of Siva-1. Our recent work has shown 
that the missing region in Siva-2 encodes a unique twenty amino acid putative 
amphipathic helical region (SAH, residues 36-55 in Siva-1). Despite the fact 
that Siva-1 does not belong to the BCL-2 family, it specifically interacts with 
the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL and sensitizes MCF7 breast cancer cells 
expressing BCL-XL to UV radiation induced apoptosis. Deletion mutagenesis has 
mapped the necessary region to the SAH in Siva-1. In this paper we demonstrate 
that the SAH region in Siva-1 is sufficient to specifically interact with the 
anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family such as BCL-XL and BCL-2 but not its 
apoptotic member BAX. Using transient transfections and direct microinjection of 
synthetic SAH peptides, we also demonstrate that the SAH region is sufficient to 
inhibit the BCL-XL mediated cell survival and render MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 breast 
cancer cells expressing BCL-XL highly susceptible to UV radiation induced 
apoptosis. The underlying mechanism of action of SAH mediated inhibition of 
BCL-XL (and/or BCL2) cell survival appears to be due to loss of mitochondrial 
integrity as reflected in enhanced cytochrome c release leading to the 
activation of caspase 9 and finally caspase 3.
