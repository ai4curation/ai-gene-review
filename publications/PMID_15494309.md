Cytoplasmic assembly of Sm-class small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) is a 
central process in eukaryotic gene expression. A large macromolecular complex 
containing the survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein is required for proper 
snRNP assembly in vivo. Defects in SMN function lead to a human neuromuscular 
disorder, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMN protein localizes to both nuclear 
and cytoplasmic compartments, and a reduction in nuclear levels of SMN is 
correlated with the disease. The mechanism of SMN nuclear import, however, is 
unknown. Using digitonin-permeabilized cells, we show that SMN import depends on 
the presence of Sm snRNPs. Conversely, import of labeled U1 snRNPs was SMN 
complex dependent. Thus, import of SMN and U snRNPs are coupled in vitro. 
Furthermore, we identify nuclear import defects in SMA patient-derived SMN 
mutants, uncovering a potential mechanism for SMN dysfunction.
