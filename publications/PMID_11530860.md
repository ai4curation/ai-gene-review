PURPOSE: To study the immunolocalization of the Bcl-2 protein in formalin-fixed 
placental tissue collected from uncomplicated term pregnancies.
METHODS: A total of 19 human term placentas of 38-41 weeks' gestation, 11 
obtained from spontaneous deliveries and eight from elective caesarean sections 
prior to labour were included. Sections were incubated with an antibody to the 
Bcl-2 protein and light microscopy was used to evaluate Bcl-2 staining.
RESULTS: The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein was expressed diffusely throughout the 
cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast with much less intensive staining in 
cytotrophoblast and mesenchymal cells. Bcl-2 expression was reduced or lost in 
areas of syncytial sprouts. No differences in Bcl-2 staining were observed 
between placentas obtained after spontaneous deliveries and those collected 
before the onset of labour after elective caesarean section.
CONCLUSION: Expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in human term 
placenta does not seem to be influenced by parturition. Additionally, Bcl-2 
expression might be an important factor in the regulation of apoptosis in the 
human trophoblast and thus in maintaining placental function during gestation.
