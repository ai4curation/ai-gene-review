The zinc finger-containing protein A20 is a negative regulator of TNF-induced 
JNK (c-Jun-N-terminal kinase) and NFkappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) signaling. 
A20 is an unusual enzyme that contains both ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating 
activities. Although A20 is mostly localized in the cytosol, our recent studies 
reveal that a fraction of A20 can associate with a lysosome-interacting 
compartment in a manner that requires its carboxy terminal zinc fingers, but 
independent of its ubiquitin modifying activities. Whether the 
lysosome-associated A20 has a function in cellular signaling is unclear. Here, 
we demonstrate that A20 is capable of targeting an associated signaling molecule 
such as TRAF2 to the lysosomes for degradation. This process is dependent on the 
membrane tethering zinc finger domains of A20, but does not require A20 
ubiquitin modifying activity. Our findings suggest a novel mode of A20 action 
that involves lysosomal targeting of signal molecules bound to A20.
