We report here that the alternatively spliced nuclear factors associated with 
double-stranded RNA, NFAR-1 (90 kDa) and -2 (110 kDa), are involved in retaining 
cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and can regulate the export of mRNA to 
the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the NFAR proteins were found to remain associated 
with exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Loss of NFAR function, which was 
embryonic-lethal, caused an increase in protein synthesis rates, an effect 
augmented by the presence of the mRNA export factors TAP, p15, or Rae1. 
Significantly, NFAR depletion in normal murine fibroblasts rendered these cells 
dramatically susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus replication. 
Collectively, our data demonstrate that the NFARs exert influence on mRNA 
trafficking and the modulation of translation rates and may constitute an innate 
immune translational surveillance mechanism important in host defense 
countermeasures against virus infection.
