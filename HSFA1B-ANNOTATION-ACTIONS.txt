CONTEXT
-------
HSFA1B is a CO-MASTER REGULATOR of heat stress response (equal with HSFA1A)
- Not subordinate, not secondary
- Essential for basal and acquired thermotolerance
- Functional redundancy with HSFA1A, HSFA1D, HSFA1E
- Recognizes HSE1b variant motif (~55 specific genes)
- Regulates ~952 genes directly, ~1,780 indirectly
- Role in developmental processes and reproductive fitness
