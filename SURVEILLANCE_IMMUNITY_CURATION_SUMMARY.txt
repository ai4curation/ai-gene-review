SURVEILLANCE IMMUNITY GENES - GO ANNOTATION CURATION SUMMARY
C. elegans Priority 2 Project
Date: 2025-12-29
================================================================================

PROJECT SCOPE
=============
Systematic curation of GO annotations for 6 C. elegans surveillance immunity genes:
1. ZIP-2 (Q21148) - 22 GOA annotations
2. CEBP-2 (Q8IG69) - 31 GOA annotations
3. IRG-1 (O16327) - 7 GOA annotations
4. ELT-2 (Q10655) - 52 GOA annotations
5. HLH-30 (H2KZZ2) - 42 GOA annotations
6. FSHR-1 (L8EC40) - 14 GOA annotations

TOTAL: 175+ annotations reviewed

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

PATTERN 1: VAGUE "PROTEIN BINDING" ANNOTATIONS
----------------------------------------------
Issue: GO:0005515 (protein binding) used for bZIP/bHLH dimers
Affected: ZIP-2 (3x), CEBP-2 (8x)
Solution: Replace with GO:0046983 (protein dimerization activity)
Impact: Improves specificity of molecular function annotations
Status: ZIP-2 YAML already correct; CEBP-2 needs consolidation

PATTERN 2: OVER-ANNOTATED GENERIC PARENT TERMS
-----------------------------------------------
Issue: Broad parent terms present alongside specific child terms
Affected: ZIP-2 (5x), ELT-2 (6x), HLH-30 (3x)
Examples:
  - GO:0003677 (DNA binding) → superseded by GO:0000978
  - GO:0006351 (DNA-templated transcription) → superseded by GO:0006357
  - GO:0006355 (regulation of DNA-templated transcription) → superseded by GO:0006357
Action: Mark as MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
Impact: ELT-2 needs 6 additions; HLH-30 needs 3 additions

PATTERN 3: MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR SAME TERM
--------------------------------------------------------
Finding: NOT over-annotation; justifies retention
Examples:
  - ELT-2 GO:0045944: 4 separate IMP studies
  - HLH-30 GO:0005634: 6 separate IDA studies at different timepoints
  - CEBP-2 GO:0050829: 3 separate IMP studies
Assessment: KEEP all - demonstrates reproducibility and robustness

PATTERN 4: IMMUNE FUNCTION SUPPORT
----------------------------------
ZIP-2: Excellent (10+ publications, clear mechanism)
CEBP-2: Excellent (4+ publications, clear mechanism)
IRG-1: Excellent (focused, well-characterized marker)
ELT-2: Excellent (5+ publications, master regulator)
HLH-30: Excellent (5+ publications, integrator role)
FSHR-1: WEAK (2 publications, mechanism unclear) ⚠️

================================================================================
MAJOR CURATION FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. SURVEILLANCE IMMUNITY PATHWAY WELL-ANNOTATED
   - ZIP-2, CEBP-2, IRG-1, ELT-2, HLH-30 form interconnected regulatory network
   - Multiple independent studies support core immune functions
   - Annotations reflect current literature understanding

2. REDUNDANCY NOT OVER-REPRESENTATION
   - Multiple IMP annotations for same term represent different studies
   - Different evidence codes (IEA, IBA, IMP, IDA) indicate different knowledge sources
   - Appropriate for well-studied genes

3. SPECIFICITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED
   - "Protein binding" too vague for dimeric proteins → use GO:0046983
   - Generic parent terms present alongside specific children → mark MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
   - 14 annotations across 3 genes need specificity improvement

4. NON-CORE FUNCTIONS APPROPRIATELY MARKED
   - CEBP-2 GO:0019216 (lipid metabolism) - marked KEEP_AS_NON_CORE ✓
   - ELT-2 developmental annotations - core to gene biology, not peripheral
   - HLH-30 autophagy/metabolic annotations - integrated with immunity

5. EVIDENCE QUALITY STRONG
   - Immune annotations supported by IMP evidence codes (strongest)
   - Multiple publications confirm findings
   - Clear experimental approaches (RNAi, mutants, reporter genes)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FINALIZATION
================================================================================

TIER 1 - CRITICAL (Before project completion):
1. ELT-2: Add 6 MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED entries for generic terms
2. HLH-30: Add 3 MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED entries
3. FSHR-1: Validate immune function annotations
4. Run schema validation: `just validate-all`

TIER 2 - IMPORTANT (During next review cycle):
5. CEBP-2: Consider consolidating 8 "protein binding" into 1-2 GO:0046983 entries
6. ZIP-2: Verify Q21361 protein binding annotation is in YAML (may be missing)

TIER 3 - OPTIONAL (Future enhancements):
7. IRG-1: Add proposed new annotation for NADAR domain if enzymatic activity confirmed
8. HLH-30: Add GO:0016208 (AMP binding) if metabolic sensor function validated

NEXT STEPS FOR CURATION TEAM
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (This week):
1. Review this summary and detailed recommendation document
2. Plan YAML editing schedule for ELT-2 and HLH-30
3. Identify who will validate FSHR-1 literature

WEEK 2:
4. Edit ELT-2 YAML - add 6 MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED entries
5. Edit HLH-30 YAML - add 3 MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED entries
6. Literature review for FSHR-1: read PMID:19196974 and PMID:26360906
7. Decide on FSHR-1 annotation status (ACCEPT vs UNDECIDED)

WEEK 3:
8. Run validation suite: `just validate-all`
9. Fix any schema validation errors
10. Final review of all 6 gene YAML files
11. Spot-check YAML against GOA files for completeness

COMPLETION:
12. Mark project as complete
13. Merge to main branch
14. Prepare summary for stakeholders

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

The 6 C. elegans surveillance immunity genes represent a well-annotated set with
strong literature support for core immune functions. The existing YAML reviews
demonstrate high-quality curation. Minor improvements needed:

1. Replace vague "protein binding" terms with GO:0046983 (dimerization)
2. Remove redundant generic parent terms that are superseded
3. Add missing MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED reviews for ELT-2 and HLH-30
4. Validate immune function claims for FSHR-1

These changes will improve annotation specificity and clarity without removing
any valid biological information. Estimated effort: 4-6 hours of careful editing
and validation.

Overall Quality Assessment: GOOD TO EXCELLENT
Recommendation: PROCEED TO FINALIZATION PHASE
