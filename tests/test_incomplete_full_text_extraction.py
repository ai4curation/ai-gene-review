    Abstract

    Calmodulin (CaM) binding to the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) regulates Ca release from the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). However, the structural basis of CaM regulation of the RyR2 is poorly defined.

    Introduction

    Calmodulin (CaM) is a versatile intracellular Ca sensor, capable of modulating the activity of diverse binding partners. CaM is comprised of roughly symmetrical N- and C-lobes that are joined by a flexible hinge.

    Discussion

    We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that the specific binding of CaM to cardiac RyR2 channels can be monitored using an F-FKBP biosensor and FRET.
