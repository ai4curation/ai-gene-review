# Concept Deep Research

## Concept
- **Query:** {concept}

## Research Objective
Provide a comprehensive research report on the biological concept above. The concept may be a pathway, protein complex, cellular process, organelle, molecular system, or phenotype. The goal is to identify the core biological meaning of the concept and the genes/proteins most directly involved.

### Species Guidance
- If the concept is species-agnostic then the report should be reasonably species-agnostic, but it may help to anchor in terms of well-understood genes (e.g. humans)
- Anchoring in terms of gene families is frequently a good idea
- E.g. for Wnt signaling, it might help to describe a simpler system like D mel, and then describe the pathway in humans and the expanded gene family members

## Use of existing ontology terms
- you should include what you find about how this term is represented in GO or analogous ontologies, but these might be out of date or too abstract
- part of the goal is to align what is in ontologies with the latest thinking in biology

### Required Deliverables
1. **Definition and scope** of the concept, including synonyms or alternate names.
2. **Core components** (complex subunits, pathway steps, essential regulators).
3. **Gene/protein/family list** with organism, role, and evidence. Separate core vs accessory or regulatory components.
4. **Functional context**: where the concept fits in cellular physiology or known pathways.
5. **Key literature** with citations (PMIDs or DOIs) for all major claims.

## Output Format
Please structure the response as follows:

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Definition and Synonyms**
3. **Core Components and Genes**
   - Provide a concise table with columns: gene/protein, organism, role, evidence.
5. **Species Coverage**
   - Explain which organisms dominate the evidence base and why.
6. **Key Literature**
7. **Candidate Genes for Follow-up**
   - List additional genes that are plausibly involved but less well characterized.

Be explicit about uncertainty and avoid mixing evidence across unrelated organisms or similarly named concepts.
