# PANTHER Family Research

## Family Context

- **Root Node:** {root_node}
- **Number of Subfamilies:** {subfamily_count}

### Subfamily Summary

{subfamily_summary}

## Research Objective

This is a PANTHER protein family that may contain subfamilies with divergent functions. Your task is to investigate the evolutionary relationships and functional diversity within this family, with particular attention to:

1. **Neo-functionalization**: Have any subfamilies evolved new functions distinct from the ancestral function?
2. **Subfunctionalization**: Have subfamilies specialized for different substrates, cellular contexts, or organisms?
3. **GO annotation accuracy**: Are the GO annotations propagated from ancestral nodes appropriate for all descendants?

## Research Questions

### 1. Family Function Overview

For this protein family:
- What is the common structural fold shared by family members?
- What is the ancestral/core function of this family?
- What cofactors, substrates, or binding partners are typical?
- What are the key catalytic/functional residues?

### 2. Subfamily Functional Diversity

For each major subfamily:
- What is the specific function of proteins in this subfamily?
- Does this function differ from the ancestral function?
- What is the EC number (if enzymatic)?
- What experimental evidence supports this function?

### 3. Neo-functionalization Detection

Look for signs of functional divergence:
- Are there subfamilies with different EC numbers within the family?
- Are there subfamilies that catalyze opposite reactions (e.g., synthesis vs degradation)?
- Are there subfamilies with different substrate specificities?
- Do any subfamilies have non-catalytic functions (e.g., structural, regulatory)?

### 4. Branch Length Analysis

Consider the evolutionary divergence:
- Which subfamilies have the longest branch lengths from the root?
- Do longer branches correlate with functional changes?
- Are there any very short branches that might be recent duplications?

### 5. GO Annotation Assessment

For GO annotations propagated across the family:
- Are these annotations appropriate for ALL subfamilies?
- Should any subfamilies have different/opposite annotations?
- Are there subfamilies that should be excluded from certain annotations?
- What subfamily-specific annotations should be added?

### 6. Literature Support

- What are the key papers describing this protein family?
- Are there papers specifically about functional divergence within the family?
- Are there structural biology papers showing differences between subfamilies?
- Are there biochemical studies comparing activities of different family members?
