# **PM20D1 reveals how ancient peptidases can evolve novel metabolic functions**

Mammalian PM20D1 represents one of the most striking examples of enzymatic neofunctionalization in evolution. Despite belonging to the **2.5-billion-year-old M20 metallopeptidase family**—the same family as yeast CPS1—PM20D1 has completely abandoned its ancestral peptide-cleaving function. Instead, it evolved into a bidirectional enzyme that synthesizes and hydrolyzes N-acyl amino acids, [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27374330/?dopt=Abstract)[eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1mw8s73k) a novel class of signaling lipids that function as endogenous mitochondrial uncouplers. This functional divergence, discovered in landmark 2016 research by Long, Spiegelman and colleagues, reveals how conserved enzymatic scaffolds can be repurposed for entirely new biological roles through neofunctionalization following gene duplication events.

## **The M20 family spans all domains of life with remarkable structural conservation**

The M20 metallopeptidase family belongs to **Clan MH** in the MEROPS classification system, defined by a characteristic di-zinc catalytic center and a conserved protein fold. Present in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), this family represents one of eight peptidase families distributed across bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5753285/)[PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7117030/) for approximately **2,500 million years**. The family encompasses glutamate carboxypeptidases, dipeptidases, aminoacylases, and carnosine-hydrolyzing enzymes across all organisms.

All M20 family members share a distinctive two-domain architecture. The **catalytic domain** adopts an αβα-sandwich fold containing the bimetallic active site, [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003986115300783) where two zinc ions are coordinated by five conserved residues (His-Asp bridge-Glu-Asp/Glu-His). The **lid or dimerization domain** either covers the active site in monomeric enzymes or mediates homodimerization. A characteristic bridging aspartate coordinates both metal ions simultaneously, while an invariant arginine from the lid domain interacts with substrate carboxylates at the S1' pocket. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003986115300783) This mechanism involves an activated water molecule positioned between the two zinc ions serving as the nucleophile for peptide bond hydrolysis.

The family divides into five major subfamilies (M20A through M20F) [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/cgi-bin/famsum?family=M20) based on sequence conservation and functional specialization. Yeast CPS1 and mammalian PM20D1 both fall within the **M20A subfamily**, yet their functions have diverged dramatically. Sequence identity between distantly related M20 members can drop to 17-18%, with M20D subfamily members sharing only 28-41% identity among themselves, reflecting the substantial evolutionary distance despite conserved active site architecture.

## **Yeast CPS1 performs classical vacuolar proteolysis**

Saccharomyces cerevisiae CPS1 (YJL172W), encoding carboxypeptidase yscS, exemplifies ancestral M20 function as a conventional metallocarboxypeptidase. This **576-amino acid, 65 kDa protein** localizes to the vacuolar lumen where it participates in protein degradation and amino acid recycling during nutrient limitation. CPS1 exhibits strict substrate specificity, requiring **glycine in the penultimate (P1) position** to release C-terminal amino acids from peptides—it readily cleaves Z-Gly-Leu but cannot hydrolyze Z-Leu-Leu or Z-Phe-Ser.

The enzyme's trafficking pathway reflects specialized vacuolar targeting. CPS1 is synthesized as membrane-associated precursor forms (77 kDa and 74 kDa glycoproteins) that traffic via the **Vps10p-dependent endosomal sorting pathway** and the **AP-3 pathway**. Proteinase B (PRB1) then cleaves the precursor to release mature, soluble CPS1 into the vacuolar lumen with a processing half-time of approximately 20 minutes. This mechanism differs from other vacuolar hydrolases like CPY that use receptor-mediated sorting exclusively.

Expression of CPS1 is tightly controlled by **nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)** through GATA-family transcription factors (Gln3p, Gat1p, Dal80p). Ammonium ions suppress CPS1 expression, while nitrogen starvation combined with fermentable carbon sources dramatically increases transcription. This regulatory pattern reflects CPS1's role in mobilizing amino acids from degraded proteins during nutrient stress. Deletion mutants show reduced growth rate, leucine auxotrophy, heat sensitivity, and decreased competitive fitness—phenotypes consistent with impaired vacuolar proteolysis.

## **PM20D1 evolved into a secreted lipid-signaling enzyme**

Mammalian PM20D1 (Peptidase M20 Domain Containing 1\) represents a radical departure from ancestral M20 function. Located at chromosome 1q32.1 in humans, PM20D1 encodes a **502-503 amino acid secreted protein** that circulates in blood tightly bound to LDL and HDL lipoprotein particles. Despite retaining the canonical M20 catalytic domain architecture, PM20D1 has completely abandoned peptidase activity.

The transformative discovery came in 2016 when Long, Spiegelman, and colleagues demonstrated that PM20D1 functions as a **bidirectional enzyme** catalyzing: (1) condensation of free fatty acids with free amino acids to form N-acyl amino acids, and (2) hydrolysis of N-acyl amino acids back to their precursors. This dual synthase/hydrolase activity generates a novel class of signaling lipids including N-oleoyl-phenylalanine, N-oleoyl-leucine, and N-oleoyl-glutamine. The enzyme prefers medium-length unsaturated fatty acids (particularly oleic acid C18:1) combined with neutral amino acids (Phe, Leu, Gln, Gly).

These N-acyl amino acid products function as **endogenous mitochondrial uncouplers** that dissipate the proton gradient independently of UCP1. PM20D1 is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue and is cold-inducible in white adipose tissue, correlating with UCP1+ adipocyte identity. [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4947008/) In mice, AAV-mediated PM20D1 overexpression increases whole-body oxygen consumption, reduces body weight [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27374330/?dopt=Abstract) by approximately 10% (primarily from adipose tissue), and improves glucose tolerance. Knockout mice show insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, altered thermoregulation, and—intriguingly—antinociceptive behaviors mediated by TRPV1 antagonism. In humans, serum PM20D1 levels correlate with adiposity, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and metabolic syndrome components.

## **Divergence mechanisms reveal neofunctionalization following gene duplication**

The functional gulf between yeast CPS1 and mammalian PM20D1 arose through multiple evolutionary mechanisms operating over hundreds of millions of years. The divergence between yeast vacuolar enzymes and ancestral mammalian M20 genes occurred **before the fungal-animal split approximately 1-1.5 billion years ago**. Subsequent expansion of the mammalian M20A subfamily (CNDP1, CNDP2, PM20D1, PM20D2, ACY1) likely resulted from the **two rounds of whole-genome duplication (2R)** that occurred early in vertebrate evolution approximately 450 million years ago, creating 3,753 gene duplications at the base of Vertebrata.

PM20D1 exemplifies **neofunctionalization**, where duplicated genes escape purifying selection and acquire novel functions. The key innovation was acquisition of **condensation (synthase) activity** alongside ancestral hydrolase activity. This bidirectional catalysis—building and breaking N-acyl amino acid bonds—requires subtle active site modifications that redirect catalysis toward non-peptide substrates while preserving the fundamental bimetallic mechanism. The enzyme retained conserved metal-coordinating residues but diverged substantially in substrate-binding regions, lid domain architecture, and trafficking signals (acquiring a secretory signal peptide versus vacuolar targeting).

Subfunctionalization also shaped M20A evolution. CNDP1 became a secreted serum carnosinase; CNDP2 specialized as a cytosolic dipeptidase handling threonyl dipeptides and N-lactoyl-amino acids; PM20D2 acquired metabolite proofreading functions for carnosine synthesis; and ACY1 retained aminoacylase activity. PM20D1's phylogenetic position as "very distant from PM20D2" indicates early divergence within this clade. Cooperatively, PM20D1 operates extracellularly while FAAH (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase) regulates N-acyl amino acids intracellularly, demonstrating division of metabolic labor between evolutionarily distinct enzyme families.

Evidence for positive selection on PM20D1 comes from multiple sources. The gene lies within the **PARK16 locus** linked to Parkinson's disease risk, with regulatory SNPs affecting expression. PM20D1 shows **signatures of selection for cold adaptation** in Russian cattle and sheep breeds, consistent with its thermogenic function. Natural genetic variation correlates with metabolic phenotypes, and PM20D1 is a quantitative trait locus associated with Alzheimer's disease through methylation-dependent expression changes.

## **Structural conservation masks functional transformation**

Despite radical functional divergence, yeast CPS1 and mammalian PM20D1 maintain the core M20 structural scaffold. Both possess the two-domain architecture with a catalytic αβα-sandwich domain containing the di-zinc center and an accessory lid/dimerization domain. The **five metal-coordinating residues** (His-Asp-Glu-Asp/Glu-His) remain conserved, [ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops/cgi-bin/clansum?clan=MH) as does the invariant arginine that interacts with substrate carboxylates. No crystal structure for PM20D1 has been solved, though structures of related M20 members (PepV, CPG2, CN2) provide excellent templates. AlphaFold predictions suggest PM20D1 adopts the canonical fold.

Key structural differences explaining functional divergence include the **substrate-binding pocket architecture** surrounding the catalytic center. Where CPS1 accommodates dipeptides with glycine at P1, PM20D1 must accommodate the bulky hydrophobic chains of fatty acids and the variable head groups of amino acids. The lid domain likely underwent significant restructuring to enable the conformational changes required for condensation versus hydrolysis reactions. Additionally, PM20D1's signal peptide directs secretion into the bloodstream, where lipoprotein particles serve as powerful enzymatic co-activators—a regulatory mechanism impossible for vacuolar CPS1.

## **The broader context reveals metabolic innovation through ancient enzyme repurposing**

The CPS1-PM20D1 comparison illuminates broader principles of enzyme evolution. Ancient enzyme families with conserved catalytic scaffolds serve as evolutionary raw material for functional innovation. The M20 family's bimetallic mechanism—optimized over billions of years for peptide bond hydrolysis—proved adaptable for N-acyl amino acid metabolism with relatively few modifications to substrate-binding regions while preserving catalytic core chemistry.

This evolutionary path created an entirely new thermogenic mechanism. Before PM20D1's discovery, UCP1-mediated uncoupling was considered the primary mechanism of non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4947008/) N-acyl amino acids now represent a **UCP1-independent uncoupling pathway** with therapeutic implications for obesity and metabolic disease. [PubMed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4947008/) Synthetic hydrolysis-resistant N-acyl amino acid analogues are already in development as potential therapeutics.

The regulatory evolution is equally significant. CPS1's nitrogen-responsive expression suits vacuolar proteolysis during starvation; PM20D1's cold-inducible, adipose-enriched expression suits thermogenic regulation. These changes in expression pattern, combined with altered protein trafficking (secreted versus vacuolar), demonstrate how regulatory evolution complements catalytic neofunctionalization to create genuinely novel biological pathways from ancient enzymatic building blocks.

## **Conclusion**

The divergence between yeast CPS1 and mammalian PM20D1 within the M20 metallopeptidase family represents a textbook case of neofunctionalization following gene duplication. While both enzymes retain the characteristic M20 di-zinc catalytic center and two-domain architecture conserved across 2.5 billion years, PM20D1 has completely abandoned peptidase activity to become a bidirectional synthase/hydrolase for N-acyl amino acid signaling lipids.
