# Chapter 13: Gene-Category Analysis - Summary

**Author:** Sebastian Bauer

## Summary

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of gene-category analysis (also known as enrichment analysis), a critical knowledge integration approach that combines ontological knowledge bases like Gene Ontology with gene lists from high-throughput experiments. The author systematically describes the standard Fisher's exact test approach, identifies its key limitations in the context of hierarchical ontologies, and presents several advanced algorithms designed to address these shortcomings.

### Fundamentals of Gene-Category Analysis

**Core Problem:**
High-throughput biological experiments typically generate lists of hundreds of biological entities (genes/proteins), making direct interpretation difficult for humans. Gene-category analysis addresses the fundamental question: "Do these responder genes share biological features that distinguish them from all genes tested in the experiment?"

**Basic Framework:**
- **Population set (M)**: All items a study could select (e.g., all genes on microarray chip) with cardinality m
- **Study set (N)**: Actual experimental outcome (e.g., differentially expressed genes) with cardinality n
- **Gene categories**: Groupings of genes with similar features (GO terms, KEGG pathways, etc.)
- **Statistical method**: Approach for identifying significantly enriched categories

### Fisher's Exact Test - Standard Approach

**Statistical Foundation:**
The standard approach casts gene-category analysis as a statistical test using the hypergeometric distribution:

**Hypergeometric Model:**
- Population M is dichotomic: items either annotated to term t or not
- Mt contains all items annotated to t (cardinality mt)
- Xt follows hypergeometric distribution: Xt ~ h(k|m; mt; n)
- P(Xt = k) = (mt choose k)(m-mt choose n-k)/(m choose n)

**Hypothesis Testing:**
- **Null hypothesis (H0)**: No positive association between study set occurrence and term t annotation
- **Alternative hypothesis (H1)**: Study set enriched for term t
- **One-tailed test**: P(Xt ≥ nt | H0) where nt is observed annotated items in study set

**P-value calculation:**
ptft = Σ(k=nt to min(n,mt)) [(mt choose k)(m-mt choose n-k)/(m choose n)]

### Multiple Testing Problem

**Core Issue:**
Hypothesis-generating studies test many terms simultaneously (often all GO terms), leading to high false-positive rates.

**Expected false positives:** α × T tests under null hypothesis
- Example: Testing 10,000 true null hypotheses at α=0.05 → ~500 false positives

**Correction Methods:**

1. **Bonferroni Correction**:
   - **Method**: Multiply each p-value by number of tests (saturated at 1.0)
   - **Controls**: Family-wise error rate
   - **Limitation**: Very conservative, assumes independence (rarely true for ontology terms)

2. **Westfall-Young Procedure**:
   - **Method**: Resampling-based approach accounting for dependencies
   - **Process**: Random study sets of same size, compute null distributions
   - **Advantage**: Considers term correlations
   - **Limitation**: Computationally expensive

3. **Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR)**:
   - **Method**: Controls false discovery rate rather than family-wise error rate
   - **Advantage**: Higher statistical power at expense of less strict false discovery control
   - **Recommendation**: American Physiological Society calls it "best practical solution"

### Gene Propagation Problem

**Structural Issue:**
Ontology design creates systematic gene sharing between terms through hierarchical relationships (particularly is-a relationships).

**Problem Manifestation:**
- If term T1 is related to T2 by is-a relationship and gene annotated to T1
- Then gene implicitly annotated to T2 (true path rule)
- If T1 is overrepresented, T2 likely also appears overrepresented
- Creates cascading false positives up hierarchy

**Synthetic Experiment Results:**
- Artificially overrepresenting "localization" term (1542 genes, β=0.2, α=0.1)
- Result: 275 additional significantly enriched terms
- 6/6 children terms significant
- 172/681 descendant terms significant
- Demonstrates extensive false positive propagation

### Advanced Algorithms

**1. Parent-Child Approach:**

**Core Idea:** Condition overrepresentation probability on parental term properties rather than entire population.

**Method:**
- Instead of drawing from population M, draw from Mpa(t) (items annotated to parents of t)
- For single parent s: P(Xt = k | pa(t)) uses mpa(t) as population size
- **Effect**: Changes population underlying Fisher's exact test to parent-annotated items

**Advantages:**
- Accounts for hierarchical structure
- Reduces false positives from gene propagation
- More conservative p-values for child terms when parent already enriched

**2. Topology-Based Algorithms (elim and weight):**

**elim Algorithm:**
- **Traversal**: Bottom-up depth-first search through ontology
- **Gene removal**: If term t significant, remove all t-annotated genes from ancestor calculations
- **Effect**: Strictly favors most specific terms, eliminates redundant parent terms
- **Philosophy**: Children terms more biologically informative due to higher specificity

**weight Algorithm:**
- **Approach**: Compares significance scores within term families (parent-child)
- **Method**: Identifies locally most significant terms, down-weights genes in less significant neighbors
- **Effect**: Decorrelates p-values while maintaining existence of significant terms
- **Advantage**: Less restrictive than elim, allows multiple significant levels

**3. Model-Based Gene Set Analysis (MGSA):**

**Bayesian Network Architecture:**
- **Term layer**: Boolean nodes for m ontology terms (active/inactive)
- **Hidden layer**: Boolean nodes for n gene hidden states
- **Observed layer**: Boolean nodes for experimentally observed gene states

**Model Relationships:**
- **Prior probability p**: Term activation probability (typically << 0.5)
- **Gene state rule**: Gene "on" if ≥1 annotated term active, otherwise "off"
- **Observation noise**: False-positive rate α, false-negative rate β

**Inference Process:**
- **Goal**: Find term configuration explaining observed gene pattern
- **Method**: Sampling from state space (optimization is NP-hard)
- **Output**: Marginal probabilities for each term (0-1 scale)
- **Advantage**: All terms compete simultaneously, accounts for dependencies

### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

**Alternative Approach:** Uses continuous gene measurements rather than discrete study sets.

**Method:**
- **Gene ranking**: Order genes by interesting feature (e.g., expression difference)
- **Score calculation**: Normalized Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic
- **ES(Nt) formula**: Maximum of running sum (increased for annotated genes, decreased for non-annotated)
- **Significance testing**: Compare score to randomly chosen gene sets of same size

**Advantages:**
- **No arbitrary cutoffs**: Eliminates need to define study set threshold
- **Utilizes all data**: Incorporates continuous measurements rather than binary classification
- **Ranking-based**: Focuses on gene ordering rather than absolute expression levels

### Software Implementations

**Available Tools:**
- **Web interfaces**: Gene Ontology Consortium website (direct Fisher's exact test access)
- **Integrated tools**: BiNGO (Cytoscape plugin), Ontologizer (standalone GUI)
- **R/Bioconductor packages**: topGo, mgsa, gCMAP
- **Multiple approaches**: Most tools implement several algorithms for comparison

## Relevance to AI Gene Review Project

This chapter provides **critical insights** for understanding and evaluating enrichment analysis results that frequently appear in gene function literature:

### 1. **Literature-Based Evidence Evaluation**
Understanding enrichment analysis limitations helps assess publication quality:
- **Gene propagation awareness**: Recognizing when papers report artificially inflated numbers of significant terms
- **Multiple testing evaluation**: Assessing whether appropriate corrections were applied
- **Method selection critique**: Understanding when standard Fisher's test may be inadequate

### 2. **Over-Annotation Pattern Recognition**
Enrichment analysis biases directly parallel over-annotation issues:
- **Hierarchical propagation**: Same mechanism that causes false positive enrichment can lead to over-annotation up ontology hierarchies
- **Parent-child relationships**: Understanding that child term significance may be consequence of parent term significance
- **Specificity assessment**: Recognizing when more general terms are flagged due to specific term activity

### 3. **Evidence Quality Stratification**
Different enrichment approaches provide templates for annotation confidence assessment:
- **Standard approach limitations**: High false positive rates parallel issues with computational annotation pipelines
- **Advanced method advantages**: Parent-child and topology-based approaches offer models for more sophisticated annotation validation
- **Model-based competition**: MGSA's competitive framework mirrors need to evaluate annotations in context of all possible functions

### 4. **Statistical Rigor in Curation Decisions**
The chapter's statistical frameworks inform our systematic curation approach:
- **Multiple comparison awareness**: Understanding that testing many annotations simultaneously increases false positive probability
- **Conditional independence**: Recognizing that annotation decisions shouldn't be made independently when terms are hierarchically related
- **Bayesian integration**: MGSA's approach suggests ways to integrate multiple evidence sources for annotation decisions

### 5. **Functional Coherence Validation**
Enrichment analysis concepts support systematic gene function assessment:
- **Study set analogy**: Our curated annotation sets can be viewed as "study sets" for validation
