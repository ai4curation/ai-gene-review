# Chapter 16: A Gene Ontology Tutorial in Python - Summary

**Authors:** Alex Warwick Vesztrocy and Christophe Dessimoz

## Summary

This chapter provides a comprehensive hands-on tutorial for working with Gene Ontology (GO) resources in Python, covering fundamental operations including GO graph querying, annotation retrieval, enrichment analysis, and semantic similarity computation. The tutorial demonstrates practical programming approaches using established Python libraries, particularly GOATOOLS and BioPython, with concrete examples and exercises.

### Core Programming Infrastructure

**GOATOOLS Library:**
- **Primary tool**: Python package for GO structure manipulation and analysis
- **Installation**: Available via PyPI (`pip install goatools`)
- **Key capabilities**: Parse OBO format files, query GO structure, visualize ontology graphs
- **Version specificity**: Tutorial uses version 0.6.4 for consistency

**Alternative Access Methods:**
- **Web services**: QuickGO API for individual term queries
- **File formats**: Direct OBO file processing vs. HTTP requests
- **Trade-offs**: Bulk analysis (file-based) vs. targeted queries (web-based)

### GO Structure Querying and Navigation

**GOTerm Class Attributes:**
- **name**: Textual definition of the term
- **namespace**: Ontology category (MF, BP, CC)
- **parents**: List of immediate parent terms
- **children**: List of immediate child terms
- **level**: Shortest distance to root node

**Programming Operations:**
- **Recursive traversal**: Finding all ancestors and descendants
- **Search functionality**: Term identification by name patterns
- **Relationship analysis**: Understanding "is_a" vs. regulatory relationships
- **Visualization**: Lineage plotting using GOTerm.draw_lineage()

**Advanced Features:**
- **Relationship loading**: Optional attributes for complex relationships
- **Common ancestor identification**: Deepest common ancestor calculations
- **Regulatory term finding**: Identifying regulation relationships

### Alternative Data Access: QuickGO Web Services

**HTTP-Based Queries:**
- **URL format**: `http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GTerm?id=<GO_ID>&format=oboxml`
- **Response format**: OBO-XML structure
- **Python implementation**: Using urllib and xmltodict libraries
- **Advantages**: No local file storage, always current data
- **Disadvantages**: Network dependency, slower for bulk operations

**Data Structure:**
- **Hierarchical dictionary**: Parsed XML provides nested access
- **Variable content**: Information richness depends on term complexity
- **Visualization**: Dictionary structure can be mapped for understanding

### GO Annotations Processing

**Gene Association File (GAF) Handling:**
- **BioPython integration**: Bio.UniProt.GOA.gafiterator
- **Standard format**: GAF 2.1 with 17 tab-delimited fields
- **Key fields**:
  - DB: Protein database identifier
  - DB_Object_ID: Protein ID
  - Qualifier: Annotation qualifiers (NOT, etc.)
  - GO_ID: Associated GO term
  - Evidence: Evidence code

**Practical Applications:**
- **Data extraction**: Iterating through annotation files
- **Filtering operations**: Finding specific annotations or evidence types
- **Statistical analysis**: Counting annotations by various criteria
- **Quality assessment**: Analyzing NOT qualifiers and evidence code distributions

### Enrichment Analysis Implementation

**GOEnrichmentStudy Function Parameters:**
1. **Background set**: Population terms for statistical comparison
2. **Associations**: Dictionary mapping protein IDs to GO term sets
3. **GO structure**: Parsed ontology from obo_parser()
4. **Propagation settings**: Boolean for parent term propagation
5. **Significance level**: Alpha cutoff (default 0.05)
6. **Study set**: Foreground terms for comparison
7. **Statistical methods**: Multiple correction approaches available

**Multiple Testing Corrections:**
- **bonferroni**: Conservative family-wise error rate control
- **sidak**: Šidák correction for multiple testing
- **holm**: Step-down Holm-Bonferroni method
- **fdr**: False discovery rate control (Benjamini-Hochberg)

**Output Analysis:**
- **Over-represented terms**: Statistically enriched GO categories
- **Under-represented terms**: Statistically depleted categories
- **Significance assessment**: P-values with multiple correction options

### Semantic Similarity Computation

**Graph-Based Measures:**
- **Distance calculation**: Minimum edges between terms via deepest common ancestor
- **Formula**: `min_distance(t1, t2) = depth(t1) + depth(t2) - 2 × depth(tDCA)`
- **Inverse similarity**: 1/distance as similarity measure
- **Structural dependency**: Based only on ontology graph structure

**Information-Theoretic Measures:**
- **Resnik similarity**: Information content of most informative common ancestor
- **Information content**: `-log(probability)` based on annotation frequency
- **Database dependency**: Requires annotation corpus for probability estimation
- **Enhanced accuracy**: Accounts for term usage patterns beyond structure

**Computational Implementation:**
- **Common ancestor finding**: Algorithmic identification of shared parents
- **Depth calculations**: Graph traversal for distance measurements
- **Probability estimation**: Frequency analysis from annotation databases
- **Comparative analysis**: Multiple similarity measures for validation

### Practical Exercise Framework

**Structured Learning Path:**
1. **Basic querying**: Term lookup and relationship exploration
2. **Visualization**: Graph plotting and structure understanding
3. **Annotation analysis**: File processing and statistical summaries
4. **Enrichment testing**: Hypothesis testing with multiple corrections
5. **Similarity computation**: Quantitative functional relationship assessment

**Real Data Integration:**

- **UniProt-GOA**: Standard annotation database for examples
- **GO basic file**: Simplified ontology structure for learning
