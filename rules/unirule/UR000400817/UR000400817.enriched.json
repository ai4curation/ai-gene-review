The kaiABC complex may act as a promoter-nonspecific transcription regulator that represses transcription, possibly by acting on the state of chromosome compaction. In the complex, it enhances the phosphorylation status of kaiC. In contrast, the presence of kaiB in the complex decreases the phosphorylation status of kaiC, suggesting that kaiB acts by antagonizing the interaction between kaiA and kaiC. A kaiA dimer is sufficient to enhance kaiC hexamer phosphorylation"
