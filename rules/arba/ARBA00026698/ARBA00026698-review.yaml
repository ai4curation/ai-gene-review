    notes: SNARE domain restricted to Primates. SNAREs are involved in membrane fusion but not exclusively vacuolar transport - they function in ER-Golgi, Golgi trafficking, synaptic vesicle fusion, and plasma membrane fusion. Primate restriction is unexplained and likely too narrow for a conserved membrane fusion mechanism.

review_summary: This rule represents a problematic mega-rule that violates fundamental curation principles. With 26 condition sets, it exceeds the manageable complexity threshold (>12) and cannot be properly analyzed using standard quantitative methods. The rule attempts to unify multiple distinct biological processes - SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, endocytic machinery, vesicle tethering, and unknown function domains - under the broad GO term "vacuolar transport." Critical issues include (1) biological incoherence due to mixing fundamentally different mechanisms, (2) inappropriate inclusion of unknown function domains (IPR031777), (3) inconsistent taxonomic scope ranging from species-specific (Primates) to kingdom-level (Eukaryota), (4) high false positive risk as constituent domains function in many non-vacuolar processes, and (5) use of an overly broad GO term that does not reflect the mechanistic specificity of individual condition sets. The rule conflates proteins involved in general membrane trafficking with those specifically targeting vacuolar compartments, creating a high risk of over-annotation.
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: This rule should be completely removed due to fundamental design flaws that cannot be remediated through modification. The excessive complexity (26 condition sets) makes it unmanageable for proper curation and validation. The biological foundation is unsound as it conflates diverse membrane trafficking mechanisms under a single broad annotation. Key problems include (1) SNARE domains function in multiple trafficking pathways beyond vacuolar transport, making GO:0007034 too specific for this broad family, (2) ENTH domains are involved in early endocytosis but do not specifically target vacuolar delivery, (3) inclusion of unknown function domains introduces unacceptable uncertainty, (4) inconsistent taxonomic restrictions suggest lack of biological coherence, and (5) the rule represents an attempt to create a "catch-all" annotation that violates the specificity principle of GO annotation. Rather than attempting to modify this rule, it should be deprecated and replaced with multiple focused rules for specific vacuolar transport mechanisms with appropriate experimental evidence requirements.
suggested_modifications:
- Remove the entire rule due to fundamental design problems
- Replace with separate, focused rules for specific vacuolar transport mechanisms
- Create individual rules for authentic vacuolar SNAREs with experimental evidence
- Develop rules for endocytic proteins with demonstrated vacuolar targeting
- Remove any unknown function domains from annotation rules
- Use more specific GO terms that match the mechanistic precision of constituent domains
- Ensure consistent taxonomic scope based on evolutionary conservation of specific mechanisms
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: With 26 condition sets spanning diverse protein families and taxonomic groups, this rule is impossibly complex for proper curation. The rule attempts to capture multiple distinct biological processes under a single annotation, violating the parsimony principle. Each condition set likely represents a different protein family with distinct mechanisms, yet all are forced into the same functional annotation. This complexity makes the rule unanalyzable using standard quantitative methods (exceeds the 12 condition set threshold) and impossible to validate comprehensively. The rule should be broken down into multiple simpler, mechanistically coherent rules.

    supporting_text: "26 condition sets far exceeds the recommended maximum for manageable curation. This complexity makes the rule nearly impossible to properly validate and maintain."
literature_support:
  assessment: CONTRADICTED
  notes: While individual domains have strong literature support for their respective functions, the literature contradicts their unification under "vacuolar transport." SNARE proteins are well-characterized but function in multiple membrane fusion events including ER-Golgi transport, Golgi trafficking, plasma membrane fusion, and synaptic vesicle fusion - not specifically vacuolar transport. ENTH domains are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and membrane curvature generation but do not specifically target vacuolar delivery. Sec1-like domains regulate SNARE function broadly across multiple trafficking pathways. The literature shows these domains function in overlapping but distinct cellular processes, contradicting their consolidation under a single functional annotation. The broad GO term does not reflect the mechanistic diversity documented in the literature.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: COMPLETE
  notes: Due to the rule's excessive complexity (26 condition sets), quantitative overlap analysis could not be performed as it exceeds the system's analytical threshold. However, conceptual analysis reveals fundamental overlap and redundancy issues. Multiple condition sets target the same protein families through different domain combinations and taxonomic restrictions, creating redundant coverage. The inclusion of both specific InterPro domains (IPR005024 SNARE) and broad architectural domains suggests significant overlap in protein coverage. The diverse taxonomic restrictions (Primates, Fungi, Dikarya, Eukaryota, etc.) applied to similar domain families indicates poor organization and likely redundant condition sets. Without quantitative analysis, the extent of overlap cannot be precisely determined, but the rule's structure strongly suggests substantial redundancy that would benefit from consolidation.

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: GO:0007034 (vacuolar transport) is inappropriately broad for the diverse and specific protein domains included in this rule. The term encompasses "the directed movement of substances into, out of or within a vacuole" but the constituent domains have much more specific functions. SNARE domains mediate membrane fusion across multiple cellular compartments, not specifically vacuoles. ENTH domains function in early endocytosis and membrane curvature, which may or may not lead to vacuolar delivery. Sec1-like domains regulate SNARE function broadly across trafficking pathways. More appropriate annotations would use specific molecular function terms for membrane fusion (GO:0061025), endocytic activity (GO:0098884), or SNARE binding (GO:0000149) rather than the broad biological process term. The current annotation risks over-annotating proteins that perform these molecular functions in non-vacuolar contexts.

    supporting_text: "GO:0007034 is very broad (any vacuolar transport). Individual domains are specific to particular mechanisms. This mismatch suggests the rule may over-annotate proteins"
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: MISSING
  notes: The rule exhibits chaotic taxonomic scope with no biological coherence. Condition sets range from highly specific (Primates, Catarrhini) to extremely broad (Eukaryota) with no apparent logic connecting the taxonomic restrictions to the protein functions being annotated. Some condition sets restrict SNARE domains to Primates despite membrane fusion being a conserved eukaryotic process. Others apply endocytic domains to specific fungal lineages (Dikarya) while similar domains in other eukaryotes are handled by different condition sets. This inconsistent taxonomic treatment suggests the rule was constructed by combining multiple unrelated smaller rules without considering biological coherence. A properly designed rule should have consistent taxonomic scope that reflects the evolutionary distribution of the functional mechanism being annotated.
