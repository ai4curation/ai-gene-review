review_summary: 'This rule exhibits excessive complexity with 17 condition sets targeting various spliceosomal components. While the GO term is appropriate and most conditions are biologically valid, the rule suffers from poor parsimony, inconsistent taxonomic logic, and potential redundancy. The rule should be simplified by consolidating related conditions and establishing consistent taxonomic scope criteria.'
action: MODIFY
action_rationale: 'The rule correctly identifies spliceosomal complex components but is overly complex and difficult to maintain. The biological basis is sound but the implementation needs significant simplification to improve parsimony and consistency.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Consolidate related condition sets that target the same protein families with different CATH FunFam identifiers'
- 'Establish consistent taxonomic scope criteria - either broad eukaryotic coverage or justified lineage-specific restrictions'
- 'Separate core spliceosomal components from auxiliary factors into distinct rules'
- 'Reduce total condition sets from 17 to fewer than 12 for maintainability'
- 'Review taxonomic restrictions to ensure they reflect genuine biological distribution differences'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'The rule contains 17 condition sets, which exceeds recommended limits and makes analysis computationally prohibitive. Many condition sets appear to target similar protein families with slight variations, suggesting potential consolidation opportunities.'
literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: 'Spliceosomal complex assembly and function is extensively documented in the literature. The individual protein families targeted (snRNPs, DEAH-box helicases, Sm proteins) are well-characterized components of the splicing machinery.'

  - reference_id: 'file:rules/arba/ARBA00035048/ARBA00035048.enriched.json'
    supporting_text: 'Condition sets target well-known spliceosomal components including U1, U2, U5 snRNPs, DEAH-box helicases, Sm proteins, and branchpoint-bridging proteins'

    supporting_text: 'DEAH-box helicases are well-established spliceosome components. The spliceosome consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs): U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, along with numerous protein cofactors.'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'Multiple condition sets target similar protein families (e.g., multiple snRNP components, different DEAH-box helicase families). Without quantitative analysis due to excessive condition set count, overlap assessment is limited to structural observation.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: 'file:rules/arba/ARBA00035048/ARBA00035048.enriched.json'
    supporting_text: 'Multiple condition sets target snRNP components (conditions 5-10, 12-16) and helicase families (conditions 1-4) suggesting potential redundancy'
go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: 'GO:0005681 "spliceosomal complex" is the correct cellular component term for these proteins. The term appropriately captures the shared localization and functional context of the targeted protein families.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: 'file:rules/arba/ARBA00035048/ARBA00035048.enriched.json'
    supporting_text: 'All targeted proteins are established components of the spliceosomal machinery including snRNPs, helicases, and associated factors'
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: MISSING
  notes: 'Taxonomic restrictions are inconsistent across condition sets. Some conditions are restricted to specific lineages (Taphrinomycotina, Primates, Mammalia) while others lack any taxonomic constraints. This inconsistency suggests unclear biological rationale for the restrictions.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: 'file:rules/arba/ARBA00035048/ARBA00035048.enriched.json'
    supporting_text: 'Taxonomic scope varies from broad (Eukaryota, Metazoa) to highly specific (Taphrinomycotina, Haplorrhini) with several conditions having no taxonomic restrictions'
confidence: 0.6
