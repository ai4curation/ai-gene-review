review_summary: 'CRITICAL ISSUE: Rule exhibits severe over-annotation by assigning overly specific directional and locational assumptions to diverse transporter families. GO curators have flagged this rule (issue #6140) because they "don''t know (and can''t infer) the location, substrate or direction" of covered transporters. The 12 condition sets cover functionally diverse transporters that may import, export, or work bidirectionally across various cellular membranes.'
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: 'This rule should be deprecated due to systematic over-annotation. The assignment of "export across plasma membrane" makes unjustified assumptions about (1) subcellular localization (plasma membrane), (2) transport direction (export vs import), and (3) functional specificity across diverse transporter families. Many covered transporters (MFS, ABC, P-type ATPases) are known to function bidirectionally and localize to various cellular membranes. The rule lacks biological coherence and creates false-positive annotations.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Replace with more general transport-related GO terms that do not assume direction or specific membrane localization'
- 'Consider separate rules for well-characterized transporter subfamilies with appropriate evidence'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'Rule contains 12 complex condition sets with different taxonomic restrictions, indicating lack of biological coherence. The diverse structural criteria (sugar transporters, ABC transporters, MFS, P-type ATPases, antiporters) suggest this rule inappropriately aggregates functionally distinct transporter families.'
literature_support:
  assessment: CONTRADICTED
  notes: 'No direct literature evidence supports the blanket assignment of "export across plasma membrane" to such diverse transporter families. GO curators explicitly state they cannot infer location, substrate, or direction for these transporters.'

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'The 12 condition sets show concerning diversity, mixing sugar transporters, ABC transporters, MFS transporters, P-type ATPases, and antiporters across different taxonomic groups. This heterogeneity suggests the rule lacks focused biological rationale.'

go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  notes: 'GO:0140115 "export across plasma membrane" is overly specific for the diverse transporters covered. The term assumes both membrane localization and transport direction that cannot be reliably inferred from the structural criteria used in the rule conditions.'

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'Rule applies to highly diverse taxonomic groups (Bacteria, Fungi, Plants, Animals) with different condition sets for each, suggesting biological incoherence rather than evolutionarily conserved function.'
