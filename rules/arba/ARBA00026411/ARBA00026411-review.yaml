  condition sets targeting proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis, degradation,
  aminoacylation, and related metabolic processes. The rule encompasses diverse enzyme
  families including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, amino acid biosynthetic enzymes
  (tryptophan, serine, threonine, histidine, cysteine, methionine, arginine, proline,
  branched-chain amino acids), amino acid degradation enzymes (tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase,
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase), and enzymes at metabolic branch points across bacteria,
  archaea, fungi, plants, and animals.

review_summary: >-
  This rule represents a comprehensive annotation strategy for amino acid metabolic
  processes, targeting 223 distinct enzyme families through InterPro domains, PANTHER
  families, and CATH FunFam identifiers. The rule captures functionally diverse proteins
  including: (1) aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that charge tRNAs and regulate amino acid
  homeostasis, (2) biosynthetic enzymes for all major amino acid pathways (tryptophan,
  branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, aspartate-derived amino acids,
  serine/threonine, histidine, cysteine/methionine, arginine/proline), and (3) degradation
  enzymes (tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, homogentisate
  1,2-dioxygenase). The GO term GO:0006520 is appropriately broad and captures all
  targeted proteins, but this generality sacrifices functional specificity—many proteins
  could receive more informative annotations to child terms such as GO:0006418
  (tRNA aminoacylation), GO:0008652 (amino acid biosynthetic process), GO:0006571
  (tryptophan catabolic process), or pathway-specific terms. Several condition sets
  employ overly restrictive taxonomic filters that may exclude functionally equivalent
  proteins in under-studied organisms, while others rely on domain signatures that
  occur in non-amino-acid contexts (ACT-like domains, cupin folds), creating potential
  for false positives. Recent literature confirms the core biochemical functions but
  reveals moonlighting roles (e.g., TrpRS in tryptophan uptake/immune signaling) and
  regulatory complexity (CBS filamentation, tyrosine hydroxylase post-translational
  modifications) not captured by process-level annotation alone.

action: MODIFY
action_rationale: >-
  The rule is biologically sound and captures genuine amino acid metabolic enzymes,
  but requires refinement in three areas. First, GO term granularity should be increased—
  while GO:0006520 is appropriate as a baseline annotation, the rule should recommend
  more specific child terms when subfamily/domain combinations allow precise inference
  (e.g., GO:0006418 for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, GO:0006571 for tryptophan degradation
  via IDO/TDO, GO:0008652 or pathway-specific biosynthetic terms for biosynthetic enzymes).
  Second, taxonomic restrictions require validation and potential expansion—several
  condition sets restrict annotations to narrow clades (Saccharomycotina, Liliopsida)
  when the enzymes function identically across broader taxonomic groups, creating false
  negatives in less-studied organisms. Third, domain-based false positives must be
  mitigated through subfamily-specific signatures—ACT-like domains, cupin folds, and
  aldehyde dehydrogenase folds occur in non-amino-acid contexts, so domain combinations
  alone are insufficient without sequence-level diagnostics for catalytic residues and
  active site architecture. A tiered annotation strategy (primary GO:0006520 plus
  secondary pathway-specific terms) would preserve comprehensive coverage while enabling
  more precise biological queries.

suggested_modifications:
  - Implement tiered annotation strategy with primary GO:0006520 and secondary pathway-specific child terms
  - For aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, add GO:0006418 (tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation)
  - For IDO/TDO families, add GO:0006571 (tryptophan catabolic process via kynurenine pathway)
  - For amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, add GO:0008652 or pathway-specific terms (e.g., GO:0000097 for sulfur amino acid biosynthesis, GO:0009423 for chorismate biosynthesis)
  - Validate and expand overly restrictive taxonomic filters (e.g., expand Saccharomycotina restriction for aaRS to all Eukaryota, expand Liliopsida restriction for shikimate kinase to all Viridiplantae)
  - Strengthen subfamily-level diagnostics for domain signatures with known multifunctionality (ACT domains, cupin folds, aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily)
  - Add evidence qualifiers noting mechanistic diversity (UCP1-independent mechanisms, allosteric regulation, moonlighting functions)
  - Consider adding molecular function annotations for specific catalytic activities where subfamily is clear

parsimony:
  assessment: ACCEPTABLE
  notes: >-
    The rule employs 223 condition sets to capture the diversity of amino acid
    metabolic enzymes across the tree of life. While this breadth reflects genuine
    biological diversity in amino acid metabolic pathways, several condition sets
    exhibit potential redundancy or insufficient discrimination. For example, multiple
    condition sets target the same enzyme family through different domain combinations
    (methionine synthase appears in three FunFam identifiers, glycine-tRNA ligase
    in three FunFam identifiers), which increases sensitivity but may propagate errors
    if any FunFam contains misclassified proteins. Additionally, some domain signatures
    have broad structural distribution beyond amino acid metabolism—ACT-like domains
    serve as amino acid sensors but are fused to diverse catalytic partners in non-amino
    acid contexts, cupin/jelly-roll folds occur in many non-amino-acid functions, and
    aldehyde dehydrogenase folds include enzymes acting on non-amino-acid substrates.
    The rule attempts to mitigate false positives through specific domain combinations
    rather than single-domain matches, but the risk remains for proteins that have
    undergone neofunctionalization, domain shuffling, or evolutionary adaptation to
    alternative substrates.

        The rule encompasses 223 distinct condition sets targeting proteins involved
        in amino acid metabolism across the three domains of life. While this breadth
        reflects genuine diversity in amino acid metabolic pathways and proteins, it
        carries inherent risks of false positives—proteins that match the condition
        sets but lack the predicted metabolic function due to neofunctionalization,
        domain shuffling, or other evolutionary processes.

        ACT is a small regulatory sensor domain for amino acids/metabolites; its presence
        alone is not diagnostic for any specific reaction. Its functional meaning depends
        on the enzyme it modulates and the ligand; standalone ACT domains can occur in
        varied contexts, so ACT-only matches should be treated cautiously.

literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: >-
    The rule has strong experimental support across all major enzyme categories.
    Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are comprehensively characterized with crystal structures,
    kinetic mechanisms, and editing functions well-established. Recent work reveals
    moonlighting functions—TrpRS participates in high-affinity tryptophan uptake via
    tryptophanyl-AMP intermediates in IFN-gamma-induced cells, linking aaRS to amino
    acid transport and immunometabolic control. Tryptophan metabolic enzymes (IDO/TDO,
    tryptophan synthase, anthranilate synthase) have extensive mechanistic characterization.
    Tryptophan synthase demonstrates substrate channeling through a 25 Angstrom hydrophobic
    channel and atypical specificity mechanisms involving allosteric effects. IDO/TDO
    catalyze tryptophan catabolism to kynurenine and are implicated in immune regulation
    through tryptophan depletion and kynurenine signaling. Amino acid biosynthetic
    enzymes are well-characterized including acetolactate synthase for branched-chain
    amino acids, aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase for aspartate-family amino acids,
    cystathionine beta-synthase for transsulfuration, and chorismate mutase for aromatic
    amino acids. Post-translational regulation is documented—tyrosine hydroxylase undergoes
    phosphorylation and nitration/glutathionylation, CBS forms regulated filaments in
    response to SAM, and numerous enzymes exhibit allosteric feedback inhibition by
    pathway end products. However, the literature also reveals context-dependent functions
    and neofunctionalization events that complicate domain-based inference. Glutamine
    synthetase exhibits moonlighting functions in palmitoylation and cell cycle regulation.
    Chorismate mutase isoforms in Arabidopsis show distinct allosteric effector profiles
    suggesting neofunctionalization within the enzyme family.

        The discovery that tyrosine hydroxylase undergoes modification by reactive
        nitrogen species and that these modifications alter its catalytic properties
        raises questions about whether the functional annotation should encompass
        regulatory mechanisms alongside catalytic function.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: MINOR
  notes: >-
    The 223 condition sets target distinct enzyme families and protein domains with
    minimal direct overlap. However, some functional overlap exists at the biological
    level—multiple enzymes participate in interconnected pathways (e.g., aspartate-family
    amino acid biosynthesis includes aspartate kinase, aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase,
    homoserine kinase, and pathway-specific enzymes for lysine, threonine, methionine,
    and isoleucine). The tryptophan metabolic pathway includes both biosynthetic enzymes
    (anthranilate synthase, tryptophan synthase) and degradation enzymes (IDO/TDO),
    representing opposite metabolic directions. Some enzymes appear in multiple condition
    sets through different structural classifications—methionine synthase appears in
    three CATH FunFam identifiers reflecting distinct structural classes despite similar
    biochemical function. This redundancy may increase sensitivity for identifying
    divergent homologs but also multiplies the impact of any classification errors.
    The most significant risk for biological overlap concerns domain architectures
    with broad distribution—ACT domains, cupin folds, PLP-binding domains, and NAD(P)-binding
    folds occur in enzymes acting on diverse substrates beyond amino acids, so annotation
    based on fold-level similarity alone without subfamily-specific sequence signatures
    creates potential for false positives in proteins that have evolved alternative
    substrate specificities.

        Several condition sets employ multiple domain signatures with OR logic—meaning
        proteins matching ANY of the conditions receive the annotation. For instance,
        condition sets combining multiple FunFam identifiers for the same enzyme (such
        as condition set 53 with three methionine synthase FunFams) likely represent
        equivalent annotations, but they increase the overall specificity of the condition
        set.

        HGD sequence motifs are diagnostic for this step, but cupin/jelly-roll folds
        occur in many non-AA functions; sequence-level diagnostics required to avoid
        false positives.

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: >-
    GO:0006520 (amino acid metabolic process) is appropriate as a comprehensive parent
    term capturing all proteins matched by the rule, but represents a deliberate choice
    to prioritize broad coverage over functional specificity. The term encompasses all
    chemical reactions and pathways involving amino acids, including biosynthesis,
    degradation, modification, transport, and utilization. While this ensures consistent
    annotation across diverse enzyme families, it sacrifices maximal biological
    informativeness. Many proteins in the rule could receive more specific child term
    annotations that would enable more precise biological queries. Aminoacyl-tRNA
    synthetases would be better annotated to GO:0006418 (tRNA aminoacylation for protein
    translation), which specifically captures the charging of tRNAs with amino acids.
    IDO and TDO families catalyze tryptophan degradation and would be more precisely
    annotated to GO:0006571 (tryptophan catabolic process) or the kynurenine pathway.
    Biosynthetic enzymes could receive pathway-specific terms such as GO:0009423
    (chorismate biosynthetic process), GO:0009082 (branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic
    process), or GO:0000097 (sulfur amino acid biosynthetic process). The current
    annotation strategy treats amino acid metabolism as a monolithic category, whereas
    the biological reality encompasses distinct biosynthetic pathways, degradation
    pathways, and regulatory mechanisms with different physiological contexts and
    regulatory controls.

        The analysis reveals that while GO:0006520 appropriately captures all proteins

        annotation to more specific child terms. A tiered annotation strategy would
        provide: Primary annotation to GO:0006520 for all amino acid metabolic enzymes,
        ensuring consistent coverage; Secondary annotations to specific child terms
        capturing more precise metabolic functions: GO:0006418 for aminoacyl-tRNA
        synthetases, GO:0008652 for amino acid biosynthesis, GO:0006571 for tryptophan
        degradation, GO:0006565 for specific amino acid biosynthesis pathways
        (threonine, lysine, etc.).

        For aaRS, IDO/TDO, Asd, and Trp-pathway enzymes, GO:0006520 is appropriate
        as a baseline process term. aaRSs are essential to amino acid utilization and
        homeostasis; IDO/TDO and Trp enzymes are directly in amino acid
        catabolism/biosynthesis; Asd is a branchpoint enzyme for the Asp family.
        Potential for more specific terms: Where subfamily/domain context allows, more
        precise process terms would be preferable (e.g., "tryptophan catabolic process
        via kynurenine" for IDO/TDO; "tryptophan biosynthetic process" for AS/IGPS;
        "branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic process" for ALS; "cysteine biosynthetic
        process via transsulfuration" for CBS).

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: >-
    The rule demonstrates inconsistent application of taxonomic restrictions across
    condition sets, with some being appropriately targeted and others being overly
    restrictive or insufficiently restrictive. Several condition sets appropriately
    restrict annotations to taxa where the pathway exists—bacteria-specific restrictions
    for certain biosynthetic enzymes, plant-specific restrictions for plastidial amino
    acid biosynthesis, and animal-specific restrictions for enzymes unique to metazoan
    metabolism. However, multiple condition sets employ taxonomic restrictions that
    appear overly narrow given functional conservation. The restriction of class II
    aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to Saccharomycotina (condition set 1) excludes functionally
    equivalent enzymes in other eukaryotic lineages and even bacteria/archaea where
    aaRS function is universally conserved. The restriction of shikimate kinase to
    Liliopsida (monocots) excludes other plant lineages where the enzyme performs
    identical functions. Conversely, some condition sets lack taxonomic restrictions
    where they might be appropriate—amino acid biosynthetic pathways often differ
    between kingdoms, and annotating biosynthetic enzymes without considering whether
    the pathway exists in the target organism creates potential for false positives.
    For example, tryptophan biosynthesis is absent in animals (tryptophan is an essential
    dietary amino acid), so applying biosynthetic annotations to animal proteins would
    be erroneous unless the proteins have been repurposed for alternative functions.
    The rule would benefit from systematic validation of taxonomic restrictions against
    recent genomic and proteomics data to ensure they reflect genuine biological
    distribution rather than historical biases in annotation coverage toward
    well-studied model organisms.

        Several condition sets include taxonomic restrictions that might exclude proteins

        identification to Saccharomycotina (budding yeasts), yet this enzyme likely
        performs identical functions in other fungal lineages outside this restriction.
        The restriction presumably reflects the availability of validated training data
        from well-characterized yeast genomes, but it risks excluding functionally
        equivalent proteins in under-studied organisms.

          cautiously.
      - statement: >-
          For cupin/jelly-roll folds (e.g., HGD superfamily) and ACT domains that occur
          in non-amino-acid contexts, and for Asd-like dehydrogenase folds that also
          occur in non-AA pathways, annotation based on high-level fold alone risks
          false positives. Domain combinations and subfamily diagnostics with conserved
          catalytic residues are required.

      The representative families we evaluated (aaRSs; IDO/TDO; Trp-pathway enzymes;
      ACT-like regulators; aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; others) have
      well-established roles in amino acid metabolism, and recent literature (2023–2024)
      supports their biochemical function and regulatory roles.
