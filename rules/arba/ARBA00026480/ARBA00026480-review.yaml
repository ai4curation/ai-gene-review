description: This rule assigns GO:0010605 (negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process) to proteins containing any of 67 different InterPro domains across 343 condition sets. The rule spans an extraordinarily broad taxonomic range including bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals.

review_summary: >-
  ARBA00026480 represents a critically flawed annotation rule that should be immediately deprecated. 
  The rule attempts to assign GO:0010605 (negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process) to 
  an implausibly diverse collection of 67 InterPro domains through 343 condition sets. This 
  complexity alone exceeds established analysis thresholds and indicates systematic over-engineering.
  
  The fundamental biological problem is mechanistic incoherence - the rule includes protein families 
  with vastly different functions including kinases (IPR000571), metabolic enzymes (IPR000999), 
  transcription factors (IPR001699), DNA helicases (IPR001650), and biosynthetic enzymes (IPR001313). 
  These diverse proteins have no shared mechanistic basis for specifically functioning in "negative 
  regulation of macromolecule metabolic process."
  
  The taxonomic scope is equally problematic, spanning bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals with no 
  evolutionary or biochemical justification. Most concerning, 242/343 condition sets (70%) lack any 
  taxonomic restrictions, meaning they would annotate proteins across all life forms.
  
  The GO term itself, while valid, represents a specific regulatory function that requires evidence 
  of inhibitory activity on macromolecular metabolism. Many domains in this rule represent proteins 
  that catalyze macromolecule metabolism (the opposite of the predicted function) or perform 
  unrelated cellular functions.
  
  This rule would generate thousands of false positive annotations and should be removed entirely 
  rather than modified, as the fundamental premise lacks biological support.

action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: >-
  This rule exhibits systematic over-complexity and biological incoherence that make it unsuitable 
  for automated annotation. The assignment of a specific regulatory GO term (negative regulation of 
  macromolecule metabolic process) to 67 diverse protein families across 343 condition sets lacks 
  mechanistic justification. Many included domains represent primary metabolic enzymes, structural 
  proteins, and general transcription factors that would not reasonably function in the specific 
  negative regulatory role described by GO:0010605. The rule's extreme complexity (343 condition 
  sets) exceeds analysis thresholds and suggests computational over-engineering rather than 
  biological insight. With 70% of condition sets lacking taxonomic restrictions, this rule would 
  generate massive false positive annotations across all domains of life.

suggested_modifications:
- Deprecate the entire rule as it lacks biological coherence
- No meaningful modifications can salvage a rule that attempts to assign the same specific regulatory function to 67 unrelated protein families
- Consider creating separate, specific rules for individual protein families with documented negative regulatory roles in macromolecule metabolism

parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: The rule contains 343 condition sets using 67 InterPro domains, which exceeds the established analysis threshold of 12 condition sets. This level of complexity cannot be justified by biological diversity and suggests systematic over-engineering. No biological function would reasonably require such an enormous number of distinct domain combinations to identify.

literature_support:
  assessment: CONTRADICTED
  notes: The rule assigns a negative regulatory function to protein families that are known to catalyze macromolecule metabolism rather than inhibit it. For example, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase (IPR000999) is essential for DNA synthesis, while glycosyl transferases (IPR000953) actively synthesize macromolecules. This contradicts the predicted GO function of negative regulation.

    supporting_text: "Many included domains represent proteins that catalyze macromolecule metabolism (positive regulation) rather than inhibit it (negative regulation)"

condition_overlap:
  assessment: COMPLETE
  notes: While individual condition sets may not directly overlap, the collective assignment of the same GO term to 67 unrelated protein families represents complete functional redundancy. The rule essentially treats vastly different proteins as functionally equivalent for annotation purposes.

go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  notes: GO:0010605 (negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic process) is a specific regulatory function, but the rule includes many proteins that perform primary metabolic functions, structural roles, or general transcription rather than specific negative regulation of macromolecule metabolism. The term is inappropriately applied to proteins without evidence of regulatory activity.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: The rule spans bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals with no biological justification for why the same regulatory mechanism would operate across all domains of life. Most problematically, 70% of condition sets have no taxonomic restrictions, meaning they would annotate proteins in any organism.
