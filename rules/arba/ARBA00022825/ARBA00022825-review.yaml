description: 'Overly complex rule with 240 condition sets attempting to capture serine protease function, but provides only keyword annotations without GO terms'
status: COMPLETE
rule_type: ARBA
rule:
  rule_id: ARBA00022825
  condition_sets: []
  go_annotations: []
  reviewed_protein_count: 0
  unreviewed_protein_count: 613753
  created_date: ''
  modified_date: ''
review_summary: 'This rule exhibits severe over-complexity with 240 condition sets and lacks functional GO annotations, making it unsuitable for accurate protein annotation. The excessive number of conditions likely captures many non-protease proteins, leading to false positives.'
action: REMOVE
action_rationale: 'Rule should be removed due to: (1) Extreme complexity with 240 condition sets suggesting poor curation, (2) No GO term predictions limiting annotation value, (3) High false positive risk from overly broad domain collection, (4) Lack of validation against reviewed protein entries'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Replace with multiple focused rules for specific serine protease families (subtilases, chymotrypsin-like, etc.)'
- 'Include proper GO term annotations (GO:0004252 serine-type endopeptidase activity, GO:0006508 proteolysis)'
- 'Validate condition sets against manually curated serine protease entries'
- 'Add constraints for catalytic residue conservation'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'Rule contains 240 condition sets, which is excessive and indicates poor curation. Many condition sets likely include domains that are not specific to serine proteases or appear in non-protease contexts.'
literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: 'Serine proteases are well-characterized enzymes with strong literature support, but this rule fails to properly capture the essential features that define serine protease function'

    supporting_text: 'Subtilases are well-characterized serine proteases with extensive literature support from Siezen & Leunissen (1997) and Raw et al. (2004). Chymotrypsin-like proteases have strong evidence from Hedstrom (2002) and Perona & Craik (1995).'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'With 240 condition sets, there is likely substantial redundancy and overlap. Many domains probably appear in multiple condition sets or represent different aspects of the same protein families.'
  supported_by: []
go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  notes: 'Rule provides no GO term annotations, only a keyword "Serine protease". This severely limits functional annotation value and fails to provide structured ontological information.'
  supported_by: []
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: MISSING
  notes: 'Rule lacks consistent taxonomic scope. Some condition sets include bacterial restrictions while others do not, creating inconsistent taxonomic coverage that could lead to inappropriate cross-kingdom annotations.'
