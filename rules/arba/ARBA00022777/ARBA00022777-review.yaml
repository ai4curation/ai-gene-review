description: "Overly broad rule attempting to annotate all kinase proteins across all domains of life using 1,358 condition sets with only a keyword annotation"
status: COMPLETE
action: REMOVE
action_rationale: |
  This rule exhibits fundamental design flaws that make it unsuitable for high-quality protein annotation:
  
  1. **Extreme over-breadth**: 1,358 condition sets capturing 462 unique InterPro domains and 157 PANTHER families
  2. **Lack of functional specificity**: Only provides keyword "Kinase" without GO annotations
  3. **High false positive risk**: Will annotate ATP-binding proteins, pseudokinases, and structural domains as kinases
  4. **Poor biological coherence**: Attempts to capture evolutionarily distinct kinase classes in one rule
  5. **Violation of curation principles**: Lacks the specificity required for meaningful functional annotation

review_summary: |
  ARBA00022777 represents a problematic approach to kinase annotation that prioritizes coverage over accuracy.
  The rule attempts to capture all kinase activity across bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses using an 
  enormous collection of disparate domains and families. This approach violates established principles of 
  protein function annotation and poses significant risks for database quality.

  The absence of GO annotations is particularly concerning, as the keyword "Kinase" provides no mechanistic 
  or functional information to users. Modern kinase classification recognizes distinct families with different
  substrate specificities (protein, lipid, carbohydrate, nucleotide kinases), regulatory mechanisms, and
  evolutionary origins that require separate treatment.

  The rule's scope encompasses domains that likely include ATP-binding folds from non-kinase proteins,
  regulatory domains found in both kinases and non-kinases, and structural domains without catalytic function.
  This creates substantial risk for false positive annotations of pseudokinases, ATP-dependent helicases,
  chaperones, and other ATP-binding proteins.

  Literature supports hierarchical classification of kinases into specific families with distinct structural
  and functional constraints. The Manning et al. (2002) human kinome analysis and subsequent evolutionary
  studies demonstrate the importance of family-specific annotation rather than broad superfamily capture.

  Recommendation: Remove this rule and replace with a suite of specific, well-curated kinase family rules
  that provide meaningful GO annotations with appropriate taxonomic scope and functional specificity.

rule:
  id: ARBA00022777
  condition_sets: 1358
  go_annotations: []  # Only keyword annotation present

parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  rationale: |
    With 1,358 condition sets covering hundreds of unique domains, this rule represents the antithesis of 
    parsimonious design. A well-designed kinase annotation system would use hierarchical rules targeting
    specific kinase classes rather than attempting to capture all kinases in a single rule.

literature_support:
  assessment: CONTRADICTED
  rationale: |
    Extensive literature supports specific kinase family classification rather than broad superfamily annotation.
    The Manning kinome analysis and subsequent studies demonstrate the importance of recognizing distinct
    kinase families with specific structural and functional constraints.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: NONE
  rationale: |
    Each domain appears only once across the 1,358 condition sets, indicating no direct overlap but
    highlighting the rule's unfocused collection of disparate kinase-related domains.

go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  rationale: |
    The complete absence of GO annotations represents a critical failure in functional annotation.
    The keyword "Kinase" provides no mechanistic information and fails to distinguish between
    protein kinases, lipid kinases, carbohydrate kinases, or their specific biological processes.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  rationale: |
    Attempting to annotate kinases across bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses in a single rule
