review_summary: 'This rule represents a problematic mega-rule that attempts to capture all phosphoprotein phosphatases under a single broad GO term using 74 condition sets. While the biological basis for phosphoprotein phosphatase activity is sound, the rule suffers from excessive complexity, taxonomic over-annotation, and insufficient specificity that likely produces numerous false positives and masks important functional distinctions between phosphatase families.'
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: 'This rule should be deprecated due to: (1) Excessive complexity with 74 condition sets that cannot be properly analyzed for overlaps, (2) Overly broad GO term that fails to capture functional distinctions between mechanistically different phosphatase families, (3) Taxonomic over-annotation spanning all domains of life without proper constraints, (4) High risk of false positives from promiscuous structural domains, and (5) Violation of annotation parsimony principles. The rule should be replaced with multiple focused rules targeting specific phosphatase families with appropriate mechanistic GO terms.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Replace with separate focused rules for protein tyrosine phosphatases (GO:0004725), serine/threonine phosphatases (GO:0004722), and dual-specificity phosphatases (GO:0008138)'
- 'Apply appropriate taxonomic constraints based on phylogenetic distribution of each family'
- 'Use more specific FunFam and domain combinations to reduce false positives'
- 'Implement maximum 12 condition sets per rule for proper overlap analysis'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'Rule violates parsimony with 74 condition sets, making it impossible to analyze domain overlaps and redundancies. Many condition sets likely capture overlapping protein sets and could be consolidated. The complexity prevents proper curation and maintenance.'
literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE
  notes: 'The general concept of phosphoprotein phosphatase activity is well-supported, but the rule lumps together mechanistically distinct enzyme families that should have separate annotations. Literature supports functional distinctions between PTP, PSP, and DSP families that are lost in this broad annotation.'

  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00027651/analysis_notes.md
    supporting_text: 'Phosphoprotein phosphatases comprise mechanistically distinct families: protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) use a cysteine-based mechanism, serine/threonine phosphatases use metal-dependent mechanisms, and dual-specificity phosphatases can target both residue types but are mechanistically related to PTPs.'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'Analysis prevented by excessive condition sets (74 > 12 limit). Visual inspection reveals likely redundancies between different FunFam entries for the same proteins, overlapping InterPro domains for related families, and taxonomic hierarchies that create subset relationships. Multiple condition sets target the same functional families with different domain combinations.'

    supporting_text: 'Rule contains overlapping condition sets including multiple entries for receptor-type PTPs (e.g., PTPRD, PTPRC variants), multiple Ser/Thr phosphatase FunFams, and hierarchical taxonomic constraints (e.g., Primates, Hominidae, Homo)'
go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'GO:0004721 (phosphoprotein phosphatase activity) is too general for this diverse set of enzymes. More appropriate terms would be GO:0004725 (protein tyrosine phosphatase activity), GO:0004722 (protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity), and GO:0008138 (protein tyrosine/serine/threonine phosphatase activity) for dual-specificity enzymes.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00027651/go_hierarchy.md
    supporting_text: 'GO:0004721 is a parent term with more specific child terms available: GO:0004722 for serine/threonine phosphatases, GO:0004725 for tyrosine phosphatases, and GO:0008138 for dual-specificity phosphatases. Using the parent term loses important functional distinctions.'
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'Rule applies across all domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota) without consideration that many eukaryotic phosphatase families are not present in prokaryotes. Some condition sets inappropriately mix prokaryotic and eukaryotic domains. Taxonomic constraints are inconsistently applied and often unnecessarily specific.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00027651/ARBA00027651.enriched.json
    supporting_text: 'Rule contains taxonomic constraints ranging from very broad (Eukaryota, Bacteria) to unnecessarily specific (Homo, Rattus, Mus) and includes phylogenetically inappropriate combinations like eukaryotic receptor PTPs with bacterial domains.'
