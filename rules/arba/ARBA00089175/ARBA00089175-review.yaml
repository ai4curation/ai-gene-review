    notes: This condition set requires both FunFam domains that are characteristic
      of PLEKHM1 proteins. The analysis shows these two domains are completely redundant
      (Jaccard similarity 1.0), both co-occurring in exactly 3 proteins in SwissProt.
      The domains are completely contained within the set of proteins annotated with
      GO:1990849 (containment 1.0), suggesting this is a highly specific but narrow

review_summary: ARBA00089175 targets a very specific set of proteins (PLEKHM1 family)
  for vacuolar localization annotation. The rule shows complete domain redundancy
  between its two FunFam conditions, which both identify the same 3 SwissProt proteins.
  While the biological basis appears sound (PLEKHM1 proteins are known to localize
  to lysosomes/vacuoles), the rule design is overly complex given the complete overlap
  of the two domains. The taxonomic restriction to Eukaryota is appropriate. Deep
  research is needed to validate whether GO:1990849 (a biological process term for
  vacuolar localization/transport) is the most appropriate term versus a cellular
  component term for vacuolar membrane or lumen localization.
action: ACCEPT
action_rationale: The rule has a strong biological basis with extensive experimental
  support for PLEKHM1's role in actively regulating lysosomal/vacuolar positioning.
  The BP term GO:1990849 is appropriate because PLEKHM1 participates in the process
  of localizing vacuoles/lysosomes rather than merely being a resident protein. Evidence
  from multiple systems (mammalian cells, osteoclasts, yeast orthologs) demonstrates
  conserved function in endolysosomal positioning through Rab7/Arl8b dual effector
  activity. While the two FunFam domains show complete statistical overlap, both RUN
  and PH domains may be necessary for PLEKHM1's characteristic multi-domain architecture.
  The rule is highly specific (only 3 proteins in SwissProt) and appears to correctly
  capture the PLEKHM1 family. Minor considerations include whether mammalian proteins
  should use "lysosome localization" instead of the generic "vacuolar" term, but this
  is acceptable for cross-eukaryotic application.
suggested_modifications:
- Consider adding complementary GO annotations capturing PLEKHM1's other functions
  such as "autophagosome-lysosome fusion" (GO:0097352), "SNARE complex assembly",
  or "vesicle tethering" for a more comprehensive functional description
- For mammalian-specific annotations, consider using "lysosome localization" (GO:0032418)
  as a more precise alternative to generic "vacuolar localization"
- Verify whether the two FunFam conditions represent functionally distinct domains
  (RUN vs PH) or merely alternative CATH classifications of the same protein; if the
  latter, one could be removed for parsimony
parsimony:
  assessment: ACCEPTABLE
  notes: 'The rule requires both RUN domain (1.20.58.900:FF:000013) and PH domain
    (2.30.29.30:FF:000315) FunFams, which show complete co-occurrence in SwissProt
    (Jaccard 1.0). While this appears redundant statistically, it may be biologically
    justified. PLEKHM1 function requires the integration of both domains: the RUN
    domain mediates Arl8b binding and is necessary for lysosomal localization, while
    the PH domain likely contributes to membrane association. The combination of RUN
    and PH domains may be diagnostic for PLEKHM1-like proteins performing dual-GTPase
    effector functions. However, if these FunFams represent different structural classifications
    of the same protein regions rather than functionally distinct domains, then one
    condition could potentially be removed.'

  notes: 'Extensive experimental evidence supports PLEKHM1''s role in lysosomal/vacuolar
    localization and positioning. PLEKHM1 functions as a dual Rab7/Arl8b effector
    that localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes, recruiting HOPS complex components
    and mediating membrane tethering and fusion. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate
    that PLEKHM1 actively regulates lysosomal positioning: immunofluorescence shows
    colocalization with LAMP1, depletion causes abnormal perinuclear lysosome clustering,
    and osteoclast-specific knockout impairs lysosome trafficking to the ruffled border.
    The RUN domain mediates Arl8b binding while the RH domain binds Rab7, allowing
    PLEKHM1 to coordinate opposing motor-based transport systems. Human disease mutations
    causing osteopetrosis further validate the biological importance of PLEKHM1''s
    vacuolar localization function.'

  notes: 'GO:1990849 "vacuolar localization" is appropriate for PLEKHM1 proteins,
    as they actively regulate lysosomal/vacuolar positioning rather than merely being
    resident proteins. PLEKHM1 coordinates opposing motor-based transport systems
    through dual Rab7/Arl8b binding, with overexpression causing dramatic perinuclear
    clustering and depletion causing loss of peripheral distribution. The term captures
    PLEKHM1''s role in the process of localizing vacuoles/lysosomes to specific cellular
    locations. However, there is a taxonomic terminology consideration: in mammals
    the organelle is properly called "lysosome" while in yeast/fungi it is "vacuole".
    The generic term "vacuolar localization" may be appropriately broad for cross-eukaryotic
    application, though mammalian-specific annotations might prefer "lysosome localization"

  notes: The rule restricts to Eukaryota (NCBITaxon:2759), which is appropriate since

    throughout eukaryotic lineages and maintain conserved interactions with Rab GTPases
    and HOPS complex components. The core mechanism appears ancient, with conservation
    across fungal, plant, and animal kingdoms. Yeast possess functional homologs of
    mammalian PLEKHM1, and heterologous expression studies demonstrate functional
    conservation. However, some functional divergence may exist between unicellular
    and multicellular eukaryotes, particularly regarding vacuole organization and
    cell cycle-linked pH dynamics in yeast versus mammalian lysosomes.
