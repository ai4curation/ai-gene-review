review_summary: 'This rule exhibits severe biological incoherence by aggregating functionally diverse protein families under a single cellular component annotation. The rule conflates structural membrane proteins, ABC transporters, metabolic enzymes, and regulatory proteins, many of which have different subcellular localizations or functions unrelated to peroxisomal membranes. The taxonomic restrictions are inconsistent and appear arbitrary. The rule likely produces numerous false positive annotations.'
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: 'This rule fundamentally violates the principle of functional coherence in GO annotation. It aggregates unrelated protein families under a single cellular component term without considering their distinct biological functions. Many condition sets contain proteins that are not peroxisomal membrane proteins (e.g., cytoplasmic reductases, nuclear proteins like NBR1). The rule should be deprecated as it would generate more false positives than accurate annotations and undermines the reliability of GO annotations.'
suggested_modifications: []
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'Rule contains 9 condition sets covering functionally distinct protein families with inconsistent taxonomic restrictions. Multiple condition sets target the same proteins (e.g., ABC transporters) with different taxonomic scopes, indicating redundancy. The complexity cannot be justified by biological diversity.'
literature_support:
  assessment: CONTRADICTED
  notes: 'While some condition sets target legitimate peroxisomal membrane proteins (PEX14, PMP34), many target proteins with well-documented non-peroxisomal localizations. NBR1 is primarily a cytoplasmic autophagy receptor, dienoyl-CoA reductases can be mitochondrial or cytoplasmic, and TECPR1 DysF domains are found in ER-associated proteins.'

  - reference_id: 'Known protein localizations from literature'
    supporting_text: 'NBR1 (Next to BRCA1) is an autophagy receptor protein localized primarily to the cytoplasm and autophagosomes, not peroxisomal membranes. Dienoyl-CoA reductases have multiple subcellular localizations including mitochondria and cytoplasm.'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'Multiple condition sets target the same protein families (ABC transporters) with different taxonomic restrictions, creating redundant annotations. Condition sets lack biological coherence as they aggregate structurally and functionally unrelated proteins.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: 'Rule structure analysis'
    supporting_text: 'Condition sets 2 and 5 both target ABC transporter subfamily D members with overlapping taxonomic scopes (Glires vs Rodentia), indicating redundancy.'
go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  notes: 'GO:0005778 (peroxisomal membrane) is a cellular component term that should only be applied to proteins that are integral to or peripherally associated with peroxisomal membranes. Many condition sets target proteins with different localizations or functions.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: 'GO term definition analysis'
    supporting_text: 'GO:0005778 definition: The lipid bilayer surrounding a peroxisome and separating its contents from the cytoplasm. Many targeted proteins are not membrane-associated or are associated with other organellar membranes.'
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: UNNECESSARY
  notes: 'Taxonomic restrictions appear arbitrary and inconsistent across condition sets. Some target broad taxa (Eukaryota, Metazoa) while others are highly specific (Muridae), without clear biological justification for these differences.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: 'Taxonomic restriction analysis'
    supporting_text: 'Condition set 6 targets PMP34 in all Eukaryota while condition set 7 targets PEX14 only in Muridae, despite both being core peroxisomal membrane proteins with broad phylogenetic distribution.'
