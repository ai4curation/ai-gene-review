  This rule is fundamentally flawed due to:
  1. EXCESSIVE COMPLEXITY: 134 condition sets exceed any reasonable maintenance threshold
  2. FUNCTIONAL OVER-BROADNESS: Conflates distinct mechanisms (ATP-dependent remodeling, histone modifications, chromatin assembly)
  3. HIGH FALSE POSITIVE RISK: Single-domain conditions and promiscuous domains
  4. TAXONOMIC INCONSISTENCIES: Mix of universal, lineage-specific, and genus-specific conditions
  5. GO TERM MISUSE: GO:0006338 is too broad for the diverse protein functions covered
  
  The rule attempts to solve chromatin remodeling annotation comprehensively but creates more problems than it solves. Should be replaced with multiple, mechanism-specific rules using appropriate child GO terms.

review_summary: |
  ARBA00027994 represents one of the most problematic rules in the ARBA system due to its extreme complexity and functional over-breadth. With 134 condition sets, this rule attempts to capture the entire landscape of chromatin remodeling proteins across all eukaryotes in a single annotation unit.
  
  CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:
  
  1. UNMANAGEABLE COMPLEXITY: The rule contains 134 condition sets, far exceeding the practical limit for rule analysis and maintenance. This makes it impossible to properly validate or troubleshoot.
  
  2. FUNCTIONAL CONFLATION: The rule incorrectly groups together proteins with fundamentally different mechanisms:
     - ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD)
     - Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases
     - Histone methyltransferases and demethylases
     - Chromatin assembly factors
     - Pioneer transcription factors
  
  3. GO TERM MISUSE: GO:0006338 "chromatin remodeling" is extremely broad and encompasses many distinct biological processes that should use more specific child terms.
  
  4. HIGH FALSE POSITIVE RISK: Many condition sets rely on promiscuous domains:
     - Bromodomains (IPR001487) appear in non-chromatin proteins
     - SANT domains (IPR001005) exist in non-remodeling complexes
     - Single-domain conditions (e.g., IPR055197) lack specificity
  
  5. TAXONOMIC INCONSISTENCIES: The rule mixes:
     - Universal eukaryotic conditions
     - Lineage-specific adaptations
     - Genus-specific conditions (Homo, Mus, Saccharomyces)
  
  6. LACK OF MECHANISTIC PRECISION: The rule fails to distinguish between:
     - Writers vs. readers vs. erasers of histone marks
     - ATP-dependent vs. ATP-independent processes
     - Structural vs. enzymatic components
  
  BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT:
  While chromatin remodeling is a well-established and important process across eukaryotes, this rule's approach is fundamentally flawed. The attempt to create a comprehensive "chromatin remodeling" rule results in a system that is too complex to maintain and too imprecise to provide useful annotations.
  
  RECOMMENDATION: REMOVE AND REPLACE
  This rule should be removed and replaced with multiple, focused rules:
  - ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (GO:0043044)
  - Histone acetylation (GO:0016573)
  - Histone deacetylation (GO:0016575) 
  - Histone methylation (GO:0016570)
  - Chromatin assembly (GO:0006335)
  
  Each replacement rule should have 5-10 well-characterized condition sets with appropriate negative constraints and taxonomic scope validation.

suggested_modifications:
- Deprecate the entire rule due to excessive complexity and functional over-breadth
- Replace with multiple focused rules using specific GO child terms (GO:0043044, GO:0016573, GO:0016575, GO:0016570, GO:0006335)
- Each replacement should have 5-10 condition sets maximum with proper validation
- Add negative constraints to exclude pseudoenzymes and non-functional domains
- Validate taxonomic scope for each replacement rule against experimental evidence

parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: |
    With 134 condition sets, this rule far exceeds any reasonable complexity threshold. The analysis system cannot even process rules with more than 12 condition sets due to computational constraints. This represents a fundamental design failure where the rule attempts to solve too broad a problem in a single annotation unit.

    supporting_text: "134 condition sets is far beyond manageable complexity. High likelihood of overlapping and redundant conditions. Impossible to manually validate all conditions. Creates maintenance nightmare."

literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE
  notes: |
    While chromatin remodeling as a biological process is extremely well-supported in the literature, this rule's specific approach of conflating different mechanisms lacks proper literature support. The individual components (SWI/SNF complexes, histone modifying enzymes, etc.) are well-characterized, but grouping them under a single broad annotation is not scientifically justified.

    supporting_text: "SWI/SNF complexes are conserved from yeast to humans (Clapier & Cairns, 2009). ISWI and CHD families show evolutionary conservation (Flaus & Owen-Hughes, 2011). Histone modifications are universal eukaryotic mechanisms (Kouzarides, 2007)."

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: |
    With 134 condition sets covering overlapping domain architectures and taxonomic groups, there is almost certainly significant redundancy. Many proteins likely match multiple condition sets, and some condition sets may be entirely redundant with others. Without proper analysis tools for this scale, the extent of overlap cannot be precisely quantified, but it is inevitably substantial.

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: |
    GO:0006338 "chromatin remodeling" is far too broad for this rule. It encompasses ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, chromatin assembly, and pioneer transcription factor activities - each of which should use more specific child terms. The rule conflates writers, readers, and erasers of histone modifications with ATP-dependent remodelers and structural factors.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: |
    The rule shows inconsistent taxonomic scope, mixing universal eukaryotic conditions with highly specific genus-level conditions (Homo, Mus, Saccharomyces). Some universal conditions may annotate proteins in organisms lacking the specific chromatin structures or regulatory mechanisms, while genus-specific conditions are unnecessarily narrow and create annotation bias.
