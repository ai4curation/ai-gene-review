review_summary: ARBA00026708 presents significant concerns regarding annotation accuracy 
  and rule design. The rule uses 10 condition sets to predict GO:0007031 (peroxisome 
  organization) but suffers from multiple issues. First, many InterPro domains lack 
  specific functional annotation, increasing false positive risk. Second, the broad 
  taxonomic scope may lead to over-annotation of organisms with reduced or absent 
  peroxisomes. Third, the rule lacks negative conditions to exclude proteins from 
  other organellar systems (mitochondria, ER) that may share similar domains. Fourth, 
  GO:0007031 is a very broad organizational term that may capture proteins with 
  indirect roles rather than direct peroxisome organization functions. The rule would 
  benefit from more specific GO terms and additional constraints to reduce false 
  positives.
action: MODIFY
action_rationale: While peroxisome organization is a legitimate biological process 
  and the rule attempts to capture genuine peroxisomal proteins, the current design 
  has significant specificity issues. Many condition sets use poorly annotated 
  InterPro domains, and the broad GO term increases risk of over-annotation. The 
  rule should be refined with (1) more specific GO terms for distinct aspects of 
  peroxisome organization (e.g., GO:0016559 peroxisome fission, GO:0016558 peroxisome 
  fusion), (2) negative conditions to exclude mitochondrial/ER proteins, (3) validation 
  that annotated organisms actually possess peroxisomes, and (4) replacement of 
  poorly annotated InterPro domains with more specific alternatives.
suggested_modifications:
- Replace broad GO:0007031 with more specific child terms based on protein function
- Add negative conditions to exclude non-peroxisomal organellar proteins
- Validate taxonomic scope to exclude organisms lacking peroxisomes
- Replace poorly annotated InterPro domains with better characterized alternatives
- Consider splitting into separate rules for different aspects of peroxisome organization
- Add literature-validated positive examples to guide refinement
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: The rule contains 10 condition sets targeting the same broad biological 
    process. While kingdom-specific peroxisome differences exist, many condition 
    sets likely identify the same core peroxisomal proteins through different domain 
    classification systems. The rule would benefit from consolidation and validation 
    of unique coverage provided by each condition set.

    supporting_text: The rule covers All eukaryotes (some condition sets), Viridiplantae 
      (plants), Fungi and subgroups (Dikarya, Ascomycota), Metazoa (animals). Potential 
      Issues include Over-broad annotation peroxisome organization mechanisms may 
      differ significantly between kingdoms, Domain promiscuity Some domains might 
      appear in non-peroxisomal contexts, Missing specificity Lack of negative 
      conditions to exclude false positives
literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE
  notes: Peroxisome organization is a well-established biological process with strong 
    literature support. However, the specific domains and proteins targeted by this 
    rule lack detailed functional characterization in many cases. Known peroxins 
    (PEX proteins) and peroxisome division factors are well-studied, but the InterPro 
    domains in this rule often have unclear functional annotations.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: Without quantitative analysis, it's likely that many condition sets identify 
    overlapping protein sets through different classification systems (InterPro vs 
    CATH FunFam). The taxonomic restrictions may provide some separation, but core 
    peroxisomal proteins are often conserved across kingdoms and could be captured 
    by multiple condition sets.

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: GO:0007031 (peroxisome organization) is a very broad term that encompasses 
    multiple distinct processes including peroxisome biogenesis, fission, fusion, 
    inheritance, and degradation. More specific child terms would be more appropriate 
    for different classes of peroxisomal proteins (e.g., GO:0016559 for fission 
    proteins, GO:0016560 for protein import).

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: The rule covers very broad taxonomic ranges including all eukaryotes for 
    some condition sets. This risks annotating organisms that have lost peroxisomes 
    (certain parasites, some anaerobic organisms) or have highly reduced peroxisomal 
    systems. Taxonomic restrictions should be validated against known peroxisome 
    distribution.
