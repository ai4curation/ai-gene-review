review_summary: |
  ARBA00028131 is designed to predict endopeptidase activity (GO:0004175) but suffers from critical design flaws that render it unsuitable for automated annotation. The rule contains 88 condition sets, far exceeding the recommended maximum of 12, making computational analysis impossible and maintenance impractical.
  
  The rule attempts to capture the diversity of endopeptidase families but fails to respect biological boundaries. It mixes serine proteases, metalloproteases, cysteine proteases, and aspartate proteases without regard for their distinct catalytic mechanisms and evolutionary origins. Most concerning is the inclusion of beta-lactamase domains (IPR003675), which catalyze fundamentally different chemistry (antibiotic hydrolysis, not protein cleavage).
  
  Taxonomic restrictions appear arbitrary and data-driven rather than biology-driven, spanning from specific genera (Protobothrops, Penicillium) to broad kingdoms (Archaea, Eukaryota). This suggests overfitting to annotation data rather than principled biological classification.
  
  The rule's complexity makes it computationally intractable - analysis tools refuse to process rules with >12 condition sets due to the exponential growth in required UniProt API queries. This prevents proper validation, overlap detection, and maintenance.

action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: |
  Rule exhibits fundamental design flaws that make it unsuitable for production use:
  
  1. EXTREME COMPLEXITY: 88 condition sets exceed computational analysis limits (max 12)
  2. BIOLOGICAL INCOHERENCE: Mixes distinct protease families with different catalytic mechanisms
  3. DOMAIN MISCLASSIFICATION: Includes beta-lactamases (IPR003675) which are NOT endopeptidases
  4. MAINTENANCE IMPOSSIBLE: Rule complexity prevents validation or error detection
  5. LIKELY REDUNDANCY: Multiple overlapping conditions suggest poor curation
  
  The rule should be deprecated and replaced with family-specific rules that respect biological boundaries.

suggested_modifications:
- Deprecate the entire rule due to extreme complexity and fundamental design flaws
- Replace with separate family-specific rules (serine proteases, metalloproteases, cysteine proteases, aspartate proteases)
- Remove beta-lactamase domains which represent biochemical misclassification
- Implement maximum 10-12 condition sets per rule for computational tractability
- Use mechanism-based classification respecting evolutionary boundaries

parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: |
    Rule contains 88 condition sets when best practices recommend maximum of 12. 
    This extreme complexity exceeds computational analysis capabilities and suggests 
    fundamental design problems including likely redundancy and poor curation.

literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE
  notes: |
    Endopeptidase families are well-characterized in literature, but this rule's 
    broad scope conflates distinct families with different catalytic mechanisms. 
    Core biological concepts are sound but implementation is flawed.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: |
    With 88 condition sets covering multiple protease families and taxonomic groups, 
    significant overlap is virtually certain. Cannot be quantified due to computational 
    limits but pattern analysis suggests extensive redundancy.

go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  notes: |
    While GO:0004175 (endopeptidase activity) is appropriate for many conditions, 
    the inclusion of beta-lactamase domains represents a fundamental mismatch - 
    these enzymes hydrolyze antibiotics, not proteins.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: |
    Rule spans all kingdoms with seemingly arbitrary restrictions. Taxonomic constraints 
    appear data-driven rather than based on biological principles, suggesting overfitting 
    to existing annotation data.
