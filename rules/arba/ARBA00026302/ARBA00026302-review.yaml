description: Massively overcomplex rule with 185 condition sets attempting to predict
  the broad biological process term "carbohydrate derivative biosynthetic process"
  (GO:1901137). The rule encompasses an extraordinarily diverse array of InterPro
  domains, CATH FunFams, and PANTHER families spanning multiple taxonomic groups,
  creating a rule of unprecedented complexity that violates all principles of parsimony.

review_summary: ARBA00026302 represents a catastrophic failure in rule design with 
  185 condition sets attempting to capture the extremely broad biological process 
  "carbohydrate derivative biosynthetic process". This represents the most complex
  rule encountered in the ARBA system, exceeding analysis limits. The rule appears
  to conflate dozens of distinct biochemical pathways under a single overly broad
  GO term, creating massive false positive risk. The complexity suggests an automated
  aggregation process without proper curation oversight, resulting in a rule that
  is neither specific nor biologically meaningful.
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: "This rule must be completely removed due to: (1) EXTREME OVERCOMPLEXITY - 185 condition sets vastly exceed the 12-condition limit considered manageable, making the rule impossible to validate or maintain. (2) OVERLY BROAD GO TERM - GO:1901137 encompasses too many distinct biochemical processes to be meaningfully captured by a single rule. (3) UNANALYZABLE - The complexity prevents quantitative overlap analysis, making it impossible to assess false positive risk. (4) PARSIMONY VIOLATION - The rule violates all principles of annotation parsimony, appearing to aggregate multiple distinct functional predictions into a single unwieldy construct. (5) MAINTENANCE BURDEN - Such complexity creates an impossible maintenance burden and prevents effective curation review."
suggested_modifications:
- Remove the entire rule immediately
- Replace with multiple smaller, mechanistically focused rules targeting specific
  carbohydrate biosynthetic pathways (e.g., separate rules for glycan synthesis,
  nucleotide sugar metabolism, amino sugar biosynthesis)
- Each replacement rule should have ≤12 condition sets and target more specific
  GO terms (e.g., GO:0006048 UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthetic process)
- Implement strict complexity limits in rule creation to prevent similar failures
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: This rule represents the most extreme violation of parsimony principles
    encountered. With 185 condition sets, it is 15x larger than the recommended
    maximum of 12 conditions. The rule appears to aggregate multiple distinct 
    functional pathways under a single broad term, creating an unmanageable and
    scientifically unsound annotation construct. This level of complexity makes
    the rule impossible to validate, review, or maintain effectively. The design
    suggests automated aggregation without proper biological curation.
literature_support:
  assessment: NONE
  notes: Cannot assess literature support due to the rule's extreme complexity
    and overly broad target term. The 185 condition sets would require evaluation
    of dozens of distinct biochemical pathways, making comprehensive literature
    review impossible within reasonable time constraints. The broad GO term
    "carbohydrate derivative biosynthetic process" encompasses too many different
    enzymatic functions to evaluate as a single coherent annotation.

    supporting_text: "Rule contains 185 condition sets targeting GO:1901137 carbohydrate derivative biosynthetic process"
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: Cannot perform quantitative analysis due to the rule exceeding the 12
    condition set limit for overlap analysis. With 185 condition sets spanning
    diverse InterPro domains, CATH FunFams, and taxonomic groups, significant
    overlap is virtually guaranteed. The sheer number of conditions suggests
    extensive redundancy and likely complete subsumption relationships between
    many condition sets. This level of overlap violates parsimony principles
    and creates massive annotation redundancy.
go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: GO:1901137 "carbohydrate derivative biosynthetic process" is far too
    broad for a single annotation rule. This term encompasses numerous distinct
    biochemical pathways including nucleotide sugar synthesis, amino sugar
    biosynthesis, glycan assembly, chitin synthesis, peptidoglycan biosynthesis,
    and many others. Each of these pathways involves different enzymes, substrates,
    and regulatory mechanisms. Attempting to capture such diverse processes
    with a single rule creates massive false positive risk and provides little
    functional insight. More specific child terms would be appropriate for
    individual pathways.
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: The rule includes condition sets spanning all major taxonomic groups
    (bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, animals) without apparent justification.
    Different organisms use fundamentally different carbohydrate biosynthetic
    pathways - bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis differs completely from mammalian
    glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Lumping such diverse processes under a single
    rule creates taxonomically inappropriate annotations and ignores the evolutionary
    divergence of carbohydrate metabolism across life domains.
