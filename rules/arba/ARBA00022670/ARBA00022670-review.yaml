action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: "This rule represents a massive over-annotation problem that should be deprecated. With 991 condition sets covering 502 InterPro domains, 151 PANTHER families, and 190 taxonomic groups, it attempts to capture ALL proteolytic enzymes across life. This violates fundamental annotation principles by: (1) lacking mechanistic specificity - proteases have 5+ distinct catalytic mechanisms that should not be grouped under a single keyword, (2) creating enormous false positive risk through promiscuous domain inclusion, (3) duplicating existing InterPro2GO mappings, and (4) conflating inactive zymogens and pseudoproteases with active enzymes. The rule affects 2.4M proteins with a single broad 'protease' keyword, making it more harmful than helpful for functional annotation."
review_summary: "ARBA00022670 is a highly problematic over-annotation rule that attempts to identify 'protease' activity using 991 condition sets spanning virtually every known proteolytic enzyme family across all domains of life. The rule covers 502 unique InterPro domains, 151 PANTHER families, 781 CATH FunFams, and 190 different taxonomic groups, affecting over 2.4 million proteins. This represents a fundamental violation of annotation specificity principles. Proteases encompass multiple distinct enzyme classes (serine, cysteine, aspartic, metallo-, threonine) with different catalytic mechanisms, evolutionary origins, and biological functions. Expert classification systems like MEROPS emphasize mechanism-based organization, while this rule inappropriately groups all hydrolytic enzymes under a single keyword. The massive scope creates severe false positive risks, including inactive zymogens, pseudoproteases, and regulatory domains. The rule likely duplicates existing InterPro2GO mappings while adding noise rather than value. This rule should be removed and replaced with smaller, mechanism-specific rules that provide accurate functional predictions."

# Assessment results
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: "With 991 condition sets incorporating 502 InterPro domains, 151 PANTHER families, 781 FunFams, and 190 taxonomic restrictions, this rule is extremely over-complex. The condition sets range from single domain requirements to complex multi-domain AND logic, with inconsistent specificity levels. Some sets require 3+ domains while others use single broad domains. The taxonomic restrictions vary from kingdom-level to genus-level, creating inconsistent coverage patterns. This level of complexity suggests the rule was assembled by aggregating multiple smaller rules without proper curation oversight."

literature_support:
  assessment: WEAK
  notes: "While proteases are well-studied enzymes, the broad 'protease' annotation lacks literature support for unified functional treatment. Expert classification systems (MEROPS, CAZy) consistently emphasize mechanism-based classification over superfamily groupings. Literature strongly supports separating serine proteases (EC 3.4.21.-) from cysteine proteases (EC 3.4.22.-) from metallopeptidases (EC 3.4.24.-) due to distinct catalytic mechanisms, active sites, and evolutionary origins. The promiscuous domain inclusion risks annotating zymogens, pseudoproteases, and regulatory subunits, which contradict established protease annotation standards."

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: "With 991 condition sets and overlapping domain families, this rule likely contains substantial internal redundancy. Multiple condition sets probably target the same proteins through different domain combinations. InterPro domains often show hierarchical relationships (family/domain/repeat) that could create complete subset relationships between condition sets. The mixture of broad taxonomic restrictions with specific FunFam assignments suggests many condition sets capture overlapping protein populations. Proper pairwise overlap analysis would require computational resources but the sheer scale guarantees significant redundancy."

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: "The 'protease' keyword (KW-0645) is inappropriately broad for the molecular function level. Proteases represent multiple distinct enzyme classes with different catalytic mechanisms: serine proteases use Ser-His-Asp catalytic triads, cysteine proteases use Cys-His dyads, aspartic proteases use dual aspartate residues, and metallopeptidases coordinate metal ions. These mechanistically distinct enzymes should have specific molecular function terms like 'serine-type endopeptidase activity' (GO:0004252) or 'metalloendopeptidase activity' (GO:0004222). The broad 'protease' term provides insufficient functional resolution and violates GO annotation specificity principles."

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: "The rule spans all domains of life with 190 different taxonomic restrictions ranging from broad kingdoms (Bacteria, Eukaryota) to specific genera (Crotalus, Gloydius). This creates inconsistent coverage patterns where some protease families are restricted to narrow taxa while others have universal scope. Many condition sets lack taxonomic restrictions entirely, suggesting global application. Given the diversity of proteolytic mechanisms across life, more careful taxonomic scoping would be appropriate - for example, restricting certain metallopeptidase families to specific bacterial lineages where they evolved."
