review_summary: This rule represents a fundamentally problematic approach to protein 
  annotation. With 991 condition sets covering an enormous diversity of protease-related 
  domains across all taxonomic groups, it serves as a "catch-all" rule that applies 
  the overly broad keyword "Protease" to 2.47 million proteins. The rule lacks specificity 
  in both its conditions (capturing domains from completely different protease families 
  and mechanisms) and its annotation (using a broad keyword rather than specific GO 
  molecular function terms). This approach creates a massive over-annotation problem 
  and provides little biological value while potentially masking more specific and 
  accurate annotations.
action: REMOVE
action_rationale: This rule should be completely removed for multiple critical reasons. 
  (1) EXCESSIVE COMPLEXITY - 991 condition sets is orders of magnitude beyond reasonable 
  complexity for any single annotation rule. (2) OVERLY BROAD ANNOTATION - Using 
  only the keyword "Protease" rather than specific GO molecular function terms provides 
  no meaningful biological information. (3) MASSIVE OVER-ANNOTATION - Affecting 2.47 
  million proteins with such a broad annotation dilutes the value of more specific 
  annotations. (4) HETEROGENEOUS DOMAINS - Combining completely different protease 
  families (serine, cysteine, metallo, aspartic proteases) under one rule ignores 
  fundamental mechanistic differences. (5) LACK OF SPECIFICITY - Many condition sets 
  contain only single domains that may appear in non-proteolytic contexts. The rule 
  should be replaced with multiple smaller, mechanistically coherent rules that provide 
  specific GO molecular function annotations.
suggested_modifications:
- Replace with multiple smaller rules targeting specific protease classes (e.g., 
  serine proteases, metalloproteases, cysteine proteases)
- Use specific GO molecular function terms instead of broad keywords
- Implement appropriate taxonomic restrictions based on protease family distribution
- Require multiple complementary domains for annotation to reduce false positives
- Limit condition sets to <20 per rule for maintainability
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: With 991 condition sets, this rule violates all principles of parsimonious 
    design. The rule attempts to capture all possible protease-related domains in 
    a single annotation rule, resulting in unmanageable complexity. The average of 
    1.69 conditions per set indicates many single-domain rules that lack the specificity 
    needed for accurate annotation. A parsimonious approach would involve separate 
    rules for each major protease class with carefully selected diagnostic domain 
    combinations.
literature_support:
  assessment: CONTRADICTED
  notes: Extensive literature analysis reveals that this rule violates fundamental 
    biochemical classification principles established by the protease research community. 
    The MEROPS database (gold standard for protease classification) emphasizes mechanistic 
    specificity - proteases with different catalytic mechanisms (serine, cysteine, 
    metallo, aspartic) should never be grouped under generic annotations. López-Otín 
    & Bond (2008) demonstrate that substrate specificity varies dramatically within 
    protease families, making broad annotations meaningless. GO Consortium guidelines 
    explicitly require the most specific molecular function terms possible, contradicting 
    this rule's use of a broad keyword. The literature overwhelmingly supports mechanistically-specific 
    annotations based on catalytic class, not umbrella terms.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: The massive scale (991 condition sets, 502 InterPro domains, 781 FunFams, 
    151 PANTHER families) virtually guarantees extensive redundancy. Many protease 
    domains co-occur in the same proteins, creating overlapping annotations from 
    multiple condition sets. Single-domain sets are particularly problematic as they 
    ignore domain architecture - proteins with multiple protease-related domains 
    would be annotated by several condition sets simultaneously. The 781 CATH FunFams 
    each appear exactly once, suggesting systematic enumeration rather than rational 
    design. No negated conditions or exclusion logic prevents redundant annotations 
    of the same proteins through multiple pathways.

go_specificity:
  assessment: INAPPROPRIATE
  notes: The rule completely lacks GO molecular function annotations, using only 
    the broad keyword "Protease" (KW-0645). This is fundamentally inappropriate as 
    proteases have diverse and specific molecular functions (e.g., GO:0004252 serine-type 
    endopeptidase activity, GO:0008270 zinc ion binding for metalloproteases, GO:0008234 
    cysteine-type peptidase activity). The keyword provides no mechanistic information 
    and fails to distinguish between the major protease classes that have completely 
    different catalytic mechanisms.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: The rule inappropriately spans all domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, 
    Eukaryota, Viruses) with 190 different taxonomic restrictions scattered across 
    991 condition sets. This violates evolutionary principles - many protease families 
    have restricted phylogenetic distributions. For example, caspases are eukaryote-specific, 
    viral proteases use host-derived mechanisms, and archaeal proteases often employ 
    thermostable variants adapted to extreme conditions. The literature shows bacterial 
    proteases are predominantly serine and metalloproteases, while eukaryotes have 
    complex regulatory networks including proteasomes. Single-domain condition sets 
    without taxonomic restrictions risk massive false positives by annotating lineage-specific 
    domains in inappropriate organisms.
