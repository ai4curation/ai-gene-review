description: A massive ARBA rule with 991 condition sets covering 2.5 million proteins that assigns only the generic "Protease" keyword (KW-0645) without any GO term annotations. This rule aggregates hundreds of different protease domain families across all taxa but provides minimal functional specificity.

  notes: "The rule contains 991 condition sets that all lead to the same generic 'Protease' keyword. This is the opposite of parsimonious design. A well-designed annotation system should use specific GO terms for different protease functions rather than one massive catch-all rule."

  notes: "While proteases are well-characterized protein families, this rule provides no functional specificity. The literature supports specific protease functions (serine protease, metalloprotease, etc.) that should be captured with appropriate GO terms, not a generic keyword."

      supporting_text: "991 condition sets with mixed InterPro, PANTHER, and taxonomic conditions likely contain substantial redundancy"
  notes: "With 991 condition sets mixing 502 InterPro domains and 151 PANTHER families, there is almost certainly substantial overlap between conditions. Many InterPro domains and PANTHER families likely describe the same or closely related protease functions."

go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  notes: "This rule assigns no GO terms whatsoever, only the generic 'Protease' keyword. This is inappropriate for functional annotation as it provides no information about specific protease activities, processes, or cellular locations."

      supporting_text: "190 distinct taxa mentioned including Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota, and Viruses - essentially all domains of life"
  notes: "The rule spans all domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota, Viruses) which is problematic for a single annotation rule. Different taxa have evolved distinct protease systems that should be annotated with taxon-appropriate GO terms."

# Action and Confidence
action: REMOVE
action_rationale: |
  This rule should be REMOVED for several critical reasons:

  1. **Lack of GO annotations**: The rule assigns only a generic "Protease" keyword instead of specific GO molecular function terms. This violates the principle of providing specific functional annotations.

  2. **Excessive complexity without benefit**: 991 condition sets for a single generic annotation is the antithesis of good annotation practice. Each condition set should ideally map to specific protease functions with appropriate GO terms.

  3. **Poor functional specificity**: Proteases perform diverse specific functions (endopeptidase activity, aminopeptidase activity, carboxypeptidase activity, etc.) that should be distinguished with appropriate GO terms like GO:0004175 (endopeptidase activity), GO:0004177 (aminopeptidase activity), etc.

  4. **Taxonomic over-generalization**: Spanning all domains of life with a single rule ignores the functional diversity of proteases across evolution.

  5. **Redundancy with existing annotations**: Many of the InterPro domains and PANTHER families likely already have appropriate GO mappings through InterPro2GO. This rule adds no value beyond existing manual curation.

  The rule should be replaced with specific, targeted rules that assign appropriate GO molecular function terms based on protease type, mechanism, and specificity. For example:
  - Serine proteases → GO:0008236 (serine-type peptidase activity)  
  - Metalloproteases → GO:0008237 (metallopeptidase activity)
  - Cysteine proteases → GO:0008234 (cysteine-type peptidase activity)

# Review Summary
review_summary: |
  ARBA00022670 represents a fundamentally flawed approach to protein annotation. This massive rule contains 991 condition sets covering 2.5 million proteins across all domains of life, yet provides only a generic "Protease" keyword annotation without any GO terms. 

  The rule aggregates 502 InterPro domains, 151 PANTHER families, and spans 190 different taxa, making it one of the most complex rules in the ARBA system. However, this complexity provides no functional benefit - all paths lead to the same uninformative keyword annotation.

  This approach violates several principles of good annotation:
  - Specificity: Proteases have diverse mechanisms and functions that should be distinguished
  - Parsimony: One annotation should not require 991 different condition sets  
  - Appropriate ontology usage: Functional annotations should use GO terms, not generic keywords
  - Taxonomic appropriateness: Different organisms have distinct protease systems

  The rule appears to be mentioned in GO curation issues precisely because it fails to provide proper GO annotations for protease functions. Instead of this monolithic rule, the annotation system should use targeted rules that assign specific GO molecular function terms based on protease type, mechanism, and substrate specificity.

  This rule should be completely removed and replaced with a suite of specific rules that provide meaningful functional annotations using appropriate GO terms.
