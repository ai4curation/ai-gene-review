review_summary: This rule is FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED for GO annotation purposes as it assigns only a UniProt keyword (KW-0645 Protease) with zero GO terms. The extreme complexity (991 condition sets spanning 502 InterPro domains, 151 PANTHER families, and 190 taxonomic groups) makes it unmaintainable and potentially redundant with existing UniProt curation. Many taxonomic restrictions appear arbitrary and overly specific (genus/species level). The rule creates substantial maintenance burden without providing functional annotation value for GO pipelines.
action: REMOVE
action_rationale: This rule should be REMOVED entirely because: (1) It assigns NO GO terms, making it completely irrelevant for GO annotation workflows, (2) Extreme complexity (991 condition sets) creates insurmountable maintenance burden, (3) Likely redundant with existing expert UniProt curation of protease keywords, (4) Many arbitrary taxonomic restrictions lack biological justification, (5) Risk of false positives due to overly broad scope, (6) UniProt keywords alone provide insufficient semantic precision for modern functional annotation pipelines.
suggested_modifications:
- Remove the entire rule as it provides no value for GO annotation
- If protease annotation is needed, create smaller focused rules (<50 condition sets each) for specific protease classes
- Ensure any replacement rules assign appropriate GO terms (e.g., GO:0008233 peptidase activity)
- Remove arbitrary genus/species-level taxonomic restrictions unless biologically justified
- Validate against existing UniProt curation to avoid redundancy
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: This rule violates all principles of parsimony with 991 condition sets creating massive complexity. The design appears to aggregate every conceivable protease-related domain/family/taxon combination without strategic organization. Single-domain rules (493/991) could likely be consolidated. Multi-condition rules show no clear biological rationale for specific combinations. The complexity makes validation impossible and maintenance prohibitive.
literature_support:
  assessment: WEAK
  notes: While protease biology is well-established in literature, this specific rule design lacks literature justification. No evidence supports the need for 991 distinct condition sets or the specific domain combinations chosen. Literature supports protease diversity but not this particular annotation strategy. The taxonomic restrictions appear arbitrary rather than literature-driven.
  supported_by:

    supporting_text: Proteases represent one of the largest and most diverse enzyme families, comprising ~2% of all genes in most genomes
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: With 991 condition sets spanning overlapping domain families, substantial redundancy is inevitable. InterPro domains (502 unique) and PANTHER families (151 unique) likely have hierarchical relationships creating implicit overlaps. FunFam classifications (781 total) add another layer of potential redundancy. No analysis provided for protein set overlaps between condition sets, making it impossible to assess actual redundancy levels.
go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  notes: This assessment is NOT APPLICABLE because the rule assigns NO GO terms. This is the fundamental flaw - for GO annotation purposes, the rule is completely useless. UniProt keyword KW-0645 'Protease' provides no semantic precision compared to GO terms like GO:0008233 (peptidase activity) and its specific children for different protease classes.
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_NARROW
  notes: Many taxonomic restrictions are arbitrarily narrow and lack biological justification. Examples include genus-level restrictions (Homo, Rattus, Crotalus, Gloydius) and highly specific clades. Proteases are universal across life, so most restrictions appear driven by annotation bias rather than biological distribution. Only 23.9% of condition sets include taxonomic restrictions, suggesting inconsistent application of this strategy.
