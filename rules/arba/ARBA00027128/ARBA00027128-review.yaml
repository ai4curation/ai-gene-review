review_summary: >-
  This rule employs a comprehensive collection of 298 condition sets to predict
  extracellular region localization. The rule demonstrates strong biological grounding
  with the majority of included domain signatures being genuinely diagnostic for
  secreted and extracellular proteins. Well-supported protein families include:
  immunoglobulins (highly reliable extracellular markers with disulfide-stabilized
  beta-sandwich structures), laminins (definitive extracellular matrix components),
  Wnts (canonical secreted signaling ligands), chemokines (well-validated secreted
  proteins), growth factors including NGF and BDNF (secreted neurotrophins), defensins
  and cecropins (antimicrobial peptides secreted into extracellular compartments),
  fibronectin (extracellular matrix protein), and numerous other protein families.
  However, the rule's complexity and broad scope introduce specificity concerns. Key
  issues include: (1) some condition sets capture membrane-anchored proteins with
  extracellular domains (e.g., neuregulins, interferon receptors) rather than truly
  secreted proteins, conflating "contains extracellular domains" with "localized to
  extracellular region", (2) certain domains (lipocalins, aspartic proteases, serine
  proteases) appear in both extracellular and intracellular contexts depending on
  protein architecture, (3) the 298 condition sets likely contain redundancies that
  could be consolidated, and (4) lack of explicit signal peptide verification may
  allow false positives. The rule appropriately uses taxonomic restrictions to reflect
  functional conservation, though some restrictions may be overly conservative. The
  term GO:0005576 is generally appropriate for truly secreted proteins but may be
  too broad for membrane-anchored proteins with extracellular domains.

action: MODIFY
action_rationale: >-
  The rule is biologically sound for the majority of included protein families and
  provides valuable automated annotation. However, modifications are recommended to
  improve specificity and reduce false positives. First, distinguish between truly
  secreted/soluble extracellular proteins versus membrane-anchored proteins with
  extracellular domains. Several condition sets (e.g., neuregulins, interferon
  receptors) explicitly reference membrane-bound isoforms yet are annotated with
  GO:0005576 (extracellular region). These proteins should either be excluded or
  annotated with GO:0005887 (integral component of plasma membrane) instead. Second,
  incorporate signal peptide verification as an additional validation layer for
  condition sets involving domains that can appear in both secreted and non-secreted
  contexts (e.g., lipocalins, serine proteases). Third, consolidate redundant condition
  sets through systematic audit to reduce complexity while maintaining coverage.
  Fourth, add negative conditions to exclude proteins with known intracellular
  targeting sequences for domains that appear in multifunctional contexts. The core
  protein families (immunoglobulins, laminins, Wnts, chemokines, defensins, ECM
  proteins) are strongly supported and should be retained. The taxonomic restrictions
  are generally appropriate though could potentially be expanded for highly conserved
  families with broader evidence.

suggested_modifications:
  - Distinguish secreted proteins (GO:0005576) from membrane-anchored proteins with extracellular domains (GO:0005887)
  - Exclude or re-annotate membrane-bound isoforms (neuregulins, interferon receptors, pro-EGF)
  - Incorporate signal peptide prediction as validation for ambiguous domain signatures
  - Consolidate redundant condition sets through systematic clustering analysis
  - Add negative conditions excluding known intracellular targeting sequences
  - Consider more specific GO child terms for specialized compartments (synaptic cleft, basement membrane)
  - Document which condition sets have highest confidence vs. require experimental validation
  - Validate rule predictions against proteomics data from extracellular compartments

parsimony:
  assessment: NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT
  notes: >-
    The rule uses 298 distinct condition sets, representing an extremely comprehensive
    but complex approach to extracellular localization prediction. While multiple
    condition sets are justified to capture the diversity of extracellular proteins
    across different taxa and protein families, the sheer number introduces maintenance
    challenges and likely contains redundancies. Many protein families are captured
    through overlapping InterPro, PANTHER, and CATH FunFam signatures that may
    predict the same proteins. For example, immunoglobulin domains are represented
    through multiple condition sets using different domain combinations and FunFam
    signatures. Similarly, laminins, Wnts, and other major families appear in multiple
    condition sets with slightly different domain combinations or taxonomic scopes.
    A systematic audit clustering conditions by predicted protein sets would likely
    reveal consolidation opportunities. Additionally, the inclusion of membrane-bound
    proteins suggests some condition sets may be overly broad in scope. The rule
    would benefit from stratification into high-confidence core sets (e.g.,
    immunoglobulins, laminins, Wnts) versus lower-confidence sets requiring additional
    validation (e.g., multifunctional domains, membrane-anchored variants).

literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: >-
    The majority of included protein families have extensive experimental support for
    extracellular localization. Immunoglobulin domains are found in antibodies and
    cell adhesion molecules with well-established extracellular functions, featuring
    disulfide-stabilized beta-sandwich structures ideal for the extracellular
    environment. Wnt proteins are canonical secreted ligands with conserved
    cysteine-rich regions essential for receptor binding, secreted through the standard
    pathway. Laminins are definitively extracellular matrix components that assemble
    intracellularly and are secreted to form basement membranes. Chemokines like
    CXCL8 are well-validated secreted proteins with conserved disulfide bonds for
    stability. Growth factors including NGF and BDNF are synthesized as proProteins
    and secreted as signaling molecules. Defensins are antimicrobial peptides secreted
    into extracellular spaces. Fibronectin and other ECM proteins have extensive
    literature support. However, some included protein families present complications.
    Neuregulins exist as membrane-bound isoforms that are not truly secreted despite
    having extracellular domains. Some lipocalins function intracellularly while
    others are secreted (retinol-binding protein vs. intracellular fatty acid binding
    proteins). Aspartic proteases include both secreted digestive enzymes and
    intracellular proteases. The literature strongly supports the rule's core families
    but highlights the need to distinguish secreted versus membrane-anchored variants.

        Defensins and cecropins are antimicrobial peptides secreted by neutrophils and

        antimicrobial effects. Human alpha-defensins form dimers stabilized by disulfide
        bonds, and their release into the extracellular milieu is a key aspect of innate
        immunity.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: MODERATE_REDUNDANCY
  notes: >-
    Substantial overlap likely exists among the 298 condition sets. Many protein
    families are captured through multiple parallel signatures using different domain
    classification systems (InterPro, PANTHER, CATH FunFam). For example, immunoglobulin
    proteins are identified through: (1) InterPro immunoglobulin-like domain signatures,
    (2) InterPro V-set and C-set domains, (3) numerous specific CATH FunFam families
    for individual immunoglobulin chains (kappa, lambda, heavy variable regions), and
    (4) taxonomic-restricted variants. Similarly, laminins appear through multiple
    condition sets with different domain combinations and FunFam signatures. Wnt
    proteins are captured via both InterPro domains and CATH FunFam signatures with
    different taxonomic restrictions. This redundancy likely serves to maximize
    coverage across different annotation sources but could be consolidated. Some
    overlap is intentional and beneficial (e.g., capturing orthologous families across
    different taxa), but systematic analysis would likely reveal opportunities to
    reduce redundancy without losing coverage. The condition sets also vary in
    granularity - some specify single FunFam families while others combine multiple
    domain requirements. A clustering analysis grouping conditions by predicted protein
    sets would clarify the degree of true overlap versus complementary coverage.

        The rule encompasses 298 distinct condition sets combining InterPro domains,

        as extracellular.

go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE_WITH_CAVEATS
  notes: >-
    GO:0005576 (extracellular region) is generally appropriate for the majority of
    protein families captured by this rule. The term is defined as "the space external
    to the outermost structure of a cell" and encompasses secreted proteins, extracellular
    matrix components, and proteins in specialized extracellular compartments. For
    truly secreted proteins (immunoglobulins, chemokines, Wnts, growth factors,
    defensins), this annotation accurately captures their primary localization. For
    extracellular matrix proteins (laminins, fibronectin, collagens), GO:0005576 is
    appropriate. However, the term presents issues for membrane-anchored proteins with
    extracellular domains. Proteins like neuregulins, interferon receptors, and
    pro-EGF exist as membrane-bound forms where the protein itself spans the membrane
    with domains in both extracellular and intracellular regions. For these proteins,
    GO:0005887 (integral component of plasma membrane) would be more precise than
    GO:0005576. Additionally, GO:0005576 is a broad parent term with more specific
    child terms that might be more informative for certain protein classes: GO:0005615
    (extracellular space) for secreted soluble proteins, GO:0005604 (basement membrane)
    for laminins and ECM proteins, GO:0043083 (synaptic cleft) for synaptic proteins,
    GO:0071682 (endocytic vesicle lumen) for endocytosed proteins. The rule could be
    refined by using more specific terms where appropriate while retaining GO:0005576
    for proteins where specific compartment information is unavailable.

        GO:0005576 encompasses diverse extracellular environments, but the rule may
        not distinguish between them.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: >-
    The rule employs taxonomic restrictions across many condition sets, appropriately
    reflecting the distribution and functional conservation of different protein
    families. Immunoglobulin-based adaptive immunity is restricted to vertebrates,
    so primate/vertebrate restrictions are appropriate. Wnt signaling with Haplorrhini/
    Primates restrictions reflects well-characterized primate Wnt biology. Mammalian
    restrictions for laminins, chemokines (Hominidae), and growth factors (Eutheria)
    appropriately capture where these proteins are well-documented. Taxonomic-specific
    restrictions for specialized proteins are well-justified: frog antimicrobial
    peptides (Pelophylax), snake toxins (Micrurus, Lepidosauria), insect proteins
    (Hexapoda, Insecta, Diptera, Neoptera), yeast proteins (Pichiomycetes,
    Saccharomycotina, Dikarya), and bacterial bacteriocins (Bacteria). However, some
    restrictions may be overly conservative. Several extracellular protein families
    are highly conserved across broader taxa than specified. For example, some
    defensin-like antimicrobial peptides exist across broader metazoan lineages than
    currently captured. Some growth factor families extend beyond the specified
    mammalian restrictions into other vertebrates. The Eukaryota-wide annotation for
    certain lipocalins and transthyretins may be too broad without additional
    validation, as not all orthologs necessarily maintain extracellular localization.
    Overall, the taxonomic scoping is thoughtful and reflects genuine biological
    differences, though some expansions and contractions would likely improve accuracy.
