description: 'Rule predicting proteoglycan catabolic process (GO:0030167) based on
  four condition sets: (1) beta-galactosidase in Eukaryota, (2) alpha-L-iduronidase,
  (3) beta-hexosaminidase in Mus, and (4) N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase in Metazoa.
  These enzymes are lysosomal hydrolases involved in sequential degradation of glycosaminoglycan
  (GAG) chains that constitute proteoglycans. However, beta-galactosidase and beta-hexosaminidase
  are primarily known for ganglioside degradation, raising questions about annotation
  specificity.'

    notes: 'Beta-galactosidase (GLB1 in humans) is a lysosomal hydrolase that cleaves
      terminal beta-linked galactose residues from glycoconjugates. While it does
      participate in keratan sulfate degradation (a glycosaminoglycan component of
      proteoglycans), its primary clinical significance relates to GM1 ganglioside
      catabolism. GLB1 deficiency causes two distinct diseases: GM1 gangliosidosis
      (impaired ganglioside degradation) and mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB/Morquio
      B (impaired keratan sulfate degradation). The dual substrate specificity reflects
      the enzyme''s ability to cleave β-galactose from structurally diverse molecules.
      While annotating GLB1 with proteoglycan catabolic process is technically correct
      for the keratan sulfate degradation function, this annotation obscures the enzyme''s
      primary role in ganglioside metabolism.'

    notes: Alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) is a lysosomal enzyme that cleaves terminal
      alpha-L-iduronic acid residues from dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, both
      of which are glycosaminoglycan chains attached to proteoglycan core proteins.
      IDUA deficiency causes mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), including Hurler
      syndrome and Scheie syndrome, characterized by accumulation of dermatan sulfate
      and heparan sulfate in multiple tissues. This is a quintessential proteoglycan
      catabolic enzyme with no known alternative primary function. The condition set
      appropriately targets this enzyme family and the GO:0030167 annotation is highly
      appropriate. Over 201 IDUA mutations have been identified, and enzyme replacement
      therapy (Aldurazyme) is available for treatment.

    notes: 'Beta-hexosaminidase exists as two isoenzymes in mammals: Hex A (heterodimer
      of alpha/HEXA and beta/HEXB subunits) and Hex B (homodimer of beta subunits).
      While beta-hexosaminidase does participate in keratan sulfate degradation by
      removing terminal N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues, its primary clinical and
      biological significance relates to GM2 ganglioside catabolism. HEXA deficiency
      causes Tay-Sachs disease and HEXB deficiency causes Sandhoff disease, both characterized
      primarily by GM2 ganglioside accumulation leading to neurodegeneration. The
      restriction to Mus genus (862507) is puzzling and appears arbitrary—beta-hexosaminidase
      function in proteoglycan catabolism is conserved across mammals and other vertebrates.
      This narrow taxonomic scope creates false negatives for the same enzyme function
      in closely related organisms. Similar to beta-galactosidase, GO:0030167 annotation
      is technically correct but potentially misleading about the enzyme''s primary
      biological role.'

    notes: N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (GNS) is a lysosomal enzyme that specifically
      removes 6-sulfate groups from N-acetylglucosamine residues in heparan sulfate,
      a glycosaminoglycan component of proteoglycans. GNS deficiency causes Sanfilippo
      syndrome type D (mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID), a neurodegenerative lysosomal
      storage disorder characterized by heparan sulfate accumulation. Unlike beta-galactosidase
      and beta-hexosaminidase, GNS is exclusively involved in glycosaminoglycan catabolism
      with no known role in ganglioside metabolism. The Metazoa restriction is appropriate
      and well-supported, as the enzyme functions in heparan sulfate degradation across
      animals. This is a strong, specific match for proteoglycan catabolic process.
      GNS represents one of five enzymes (types A-E) involved exclusively in heparan
      sulfate degradation, and deficiency of any causes distinct Sanfilippo syndrome
      subtypes.

review_summary: 'This rule captures four lysosomal glycosidases and sulfatases that
  participate in proteoglycan catabolism through degradation of glycosaminoglycan
  chains. Condition set 2 (alpha-L-iduronidase) and condition set 4 (N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase)
  are strongly appropriate—these enzymes are exclusively or primarily involved in
  degrading dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and related GAG chains, with well-characterized
  mucopolysaccharidosis phenotypes when deficient. Condition sets 1 (beta-galactosidase)
  and 3 (beta-hexosaminidase) are technically correct but biologically problematic—while
  these enzymes do participate in keratan sulfate degradation, their primary biological
  roles and clinical significance relate to ganglioside catabolism (GM1 and GM2 respectively).
  The taxonomic scope is inconsistent and raises questions: condition set 1 uses broad
  Eukaryota scope, condition set 3 uses narrow Mus restriction (creating false negatives),
  and condition set 4 uses appropriate Metazoa scope. The rule demonstrates a tension
  between biochemical accuracy (all four enzymes can cleave bonds in GAG chains) and
  biological interpretation (two are primarily ganglioside-degrading enzymes with
  secondary GAG functions). More specific annotations or hierarchical annotation strategies
  would improve utility.'
action: MODIFY
action_rationale: 'The rule requires modification to improve biological accuracy and
  reduce potential misinterpretation. Three specific issues need addressing: (1) Condition
  sets 1 (beta-galactosidase) and 3 (beta-hexosaminidase) should either be removed
  from this rule or receive additional primary annotations reflecting their ganglioside-degrading
  functions (e.g., "GM1 ganglioside catabolic process" GO:0006689 for GLB1, "ganglioside
  catabolic process" GO:0006687 or "GM2 ganglioside catabolic process" for hexosaminidase).
  A hierarchical annotation strategy where proteins receive both primary (ganglioside)
  and secondary (proteoglycan) annotations would be most accurate. (2) The Mus restriction
  in condition set 3 is unjustified and creates false negatives—beta-hexosaminidase
  function in keratan sulfate degradation is conserved across mammals minimally, likely
  across vertebrates. This scope should be expanded to at least Mammalia or Vertebrata.
  (3) Consider splitting this rule: create a focused rule for core proteoglycan-degrading
  enzymes (IDUA, GNS, and other MPS-associated enzymes) separate from dual-function
  enzymes that also degrade gangliosides. This would improve both precision and biological
  interpretability while maintaining computational utility.'
suggested_modifications:
- Remove condition sets 1 and 3 from this rule and create separate rules for ganglioside-degrading
  enzymes with dual substrate specificity
- Alternatively, add hierarchical GO annotations where GLB1 receives both "GM1 ganglioside
  catabolic process" (primary) and "proteoglycan catabolic process" (secondary)
- Add hierarchical GO annotations where beta-hexosaminidase receives both "GM2 ganglioside
  catabolic process" or "ganglioside catabolic process" (primary) and "proteoglycan
  catabolic process" (secondary)
- Expand condition set 3 taxonomic scope from Mus (862507) to at minimum Mammalia
  (40674) or preferably Vertebrata (7742)
- Consider adding other core proteoglycan-degrading enzymes to strengthen the rule
  (iduronate-2-sulfatase/IDS for MPS II, N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase/GALNS for
  MPS IVA, and other MPS-associated enzymes)
- Add more specific child term annotations where appropriate (heparan sulfate catabolic
  process for GNS, dermatan sulfate catabolic process for IDUA)
- Document the distinction between primary proteoglycan-degrading enzymes and dual-function
  enzymes in rule metadata
parsimony:
  assessment: REDUNDANT
  notes: 'The rule uses four condition sets but lacks parsimony in two respects. First,
    it conflates enzymes with distinct primary biological functions—dedicated GAG-degrading
    enzymes (IDUA, GNS) versus dual-function enzymes with primary ganglioside-degrading
    roles (GLB1, Hex A/B). This creates a heterogeneous rule that obscures important
    functional distinctions. Second, condition set 3 combines two beta-hexosaminidase
    FunFams with an arbitrary Mus-only restriction, while condition set 1 uses broad
    Eukaryota scope for structurally similar beta-galactosidase—this inconsistency
    suggests the taxonomic constraints were not systematically designed. A more parsimonious
    approach would split the rule into: (a) a focused rule for enzymes primarily involved
    in proteoglycan catabolism (IDUA, GNS, potentially expanded to other MPS enzymes),
    and (b) a separate rule or hierarchical annotation strategy for dual-function
    enzymes. Within each condition set, the use of multiple FunFam signatures for
    the same enzyme is appropriate for capturing sequence diversity, but the overall
    rule structure lacks biological parsimony.'

  notes: 'All four condition sets have extensive experimental support. Alpha-L-iduronidase
    (condition set 2): Over 201 IDUA mutations documented, enzyme replacement therapy

condition_overlap:
  assessment: NONE
  notes: 'The four condition sets target distinct enzyme families with no sequence
    or structural overlap. Condition set 1 targets beta-galactosidase (GLB1, GH35
    family), condition set 2 targets alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA, GH39 family), condition
    set 3 targets beta-hexosaminidase (HEXA/HEXB, GH20 family), and condition set
    4 targets N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (GNS, sulfatase family). These represent
    independent evolutionary solutions to specific bond cleavage reactions in GAG
    degradation. Mechanistically, they cleave different bonds: beta-galactosidase
    removes terminal beta-galactose, alpha-L-iduronidase removes alpha-L-iduronate,
    beta-hexosaminidase removes N-acetylhexosamine, and GNS removes 6-sulfate from
    N-acetylglucosamine. The enzymes act sequentially in lysosomal GAG catabolism
    pathways but do not overlap in substrate specificity. However, there is functional
    overlap in the sense that beta-galactosidase and beta-hexosaminidase both have
    primary roles in ganglioside catabolism, creating a different kind of "overlap"
    issue—overlap in biological context rather than molecular specificity.'
go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: GO:0030167 (proteoglycan catabolic process) shows variable appropriateness
    across the four condition sets. For condition set 2 (alpha-L-iduronidase) and
    condition set 4 (N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase), GO:0030167 is highly appropriate
    and could potentially be made more specific with child terms like "dermatan sulfate
    catabolic process" (GO:1902556) or "heparan sulfate proteoglycan catabolic process"
    (GO:0030200). For condition sets 1 (beta-galactosidase) and 3 (beta-hexosaminidase),
    GO:0030167 is technically accurate but too broad and potentially misleading—it
    fails to capture the primary biological roles of these enzymes in ganglioside
    metabolism. More appropriate primary annotations would be "GM1 ganglioside catabolic
    process" (GO:0006689) for GLB1 and "ganglioside catabolic process" (GO:0006687)
    or "GM2 ganglioside catabolic process" for hexosaminidase. The current annotation
    strategy creates a situation where users searching for proteoglycan-degrading
    enzymes will retrieve GLB1 and hexosaminidase, potentially not understanding that
    these enzymes' primary functions lie elsewhere. A hierarchical annotation approach
    with both primary and secondary GO terms would better reflect the biological reality.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_NARROW
  notes: The taxonomic scopes across condition sets are inconsistent and in one case
    appear arbitrary. Condition set 1 uses Eukaryota (NCBITaxon:2759), an extremely
    broad scope appropriate for the widespread distribution of beta-galactosidase
    across eukaryotes. Condition set 2 has no taxonomic restriction, which is appropriate
    given IDUA's conservation across animals and potentially other eukaryotes. Condition
    set 3 uses Mus (NCBITaxon:862507), restricting to mouse and rat genera—this is
    unjustifiably narrow and creates false negatives for the same enzyme function
    in other mammals, vertebrates, and potentially all animals. Beta-hexosaminidase
    function in keratan sulfate degradation is conserved across mammals at minimum,
    and the Mus restriction appears arbitrary or erroneous. Condition set 4 uses Metazoa
    (NCBITaxon:33208), which is appropriate for N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase function
    in animals. The inconsistency suggests the rule was not designed with systematic
    consideration of taxonomic distribution. Condition set 3 should be expanded to
    at least Mammalia (40674) or Vertebrata (7742), and ideally the entire rule should
    use consistent taxonomic scope logic.
