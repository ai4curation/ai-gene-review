review_summary: 'This rule targets a specific phosphoinositide phosphatase activity associated with myotubularin family proteins. While the biological basis is sound - myotubularin phosphatases are well-established PtdIns(3,5)P2 3-phosphatases involved in endosomal trafficking - the rule design shows concerning complexity and potential issues. Condition set 1 requires both a broad PTP domain (IPR000387) and a myotubularin-specific domain (IPR010569), which may be unnecessarily restrictive. The CATH FunFams in conditions 2-3 are completely disjoint, suggesting they represent different protein families. The inconsistent taxonomic scopes (Primates vs Eukaryota) lack clear biological justification. Despite these design concerns, the rule does capture a novel GO annotation not present in InterPro2GO mappings.'
action: MODIFY
action_rationale: 'The rule addresses a legitimate biological function with solid mechanistic basis, but suffers from design complexity that may create false negatives. The dual domain requirement in condition set 1 appears overly restrictive, and the inconsistent taxonomic scopes need biological justification. The completely disjoint CATH FunFams suggest this rule may actually represent multiple distinct annotation patterns that should be separated. Modification is recommended to: (1) simplify condition set 1 by removing the broad PTP domain requirement, (2) justify or unify taxonomic restrictions, and (3) potentially split into separate rules for the disjoint FunFam families.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Remove IPR000387 (broad PTP domain) from condition set 1, keep only IPR010569 (myotubularin-specific)'
- 'Unify taxonomic scope to Eukaryota across all condition sets unless Primates-specific evidence exists'
- 'Consider splitting into separate rules for disjoint CATH FunFams (2.30.29.30:FF:000038 vs 3.30.40.10:FF:000073)'
- 'Add evidence requirements or experimental validation for the specific protein families captured'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'The rule shows concerning complexity with minimal biological justification. Condition set 1 requires both a broad PTP domain (410 proteins) and a specific myotubularin domain (63 proteins) - the broad domain adds little specificity. The three condition sets use inconsistent taxonomic scopes without clear rationale. The two CATH FunFams are completely disjoint (0% overlap), suggesting this rule conflates multiple distinct annotation patterns that should be handled separately.'
literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: 'Strong literature support exists for myotubularin family phosphatases having PtdIns(3,5)P2 3-phosphatase activity. The biochemical mechanism is well-established, with clear roles in endosomal trafficking and phosphoinositide metabolism.'

    supporting_text: 'Myotubularin phosphatases are members of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily...enzymes that contain the tensin and myotubularin PTP domain utilise the phosphoinositide as its physiologic substrate. Myotubularins are 3-phosphatases specific for membrane-embedded PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2'
  - reference_id: file:publications/PMID_26783301.md
    supporting_text: 'PtdIns3P is not obviously present on multivesicular late endosomes, probably because of dephosphorylation by myotubularin family phosphatases or conversion by PIKfyve/Fab1 into the late endosome–specific phosphatidylinositide, PtdIns(3,5)P2'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'Analysis reveals concerning overlap patterns. The two CATH FunFams are completely disjoint (0% Jaccard similarity), suggesting they represent different protein families. IPR010569 shows only 30% containment in IPR000387, indicating the dual domain requirement may exclude legitimate myotubularin proteins. Most concerning is that both FunFams show 100% containment in the GO term, suggesting potential redundancy with simpler domain-based annotations.'

go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: 'GO:0052629 (phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate 3-phosphatase activity) represents an appropriate level of specificity for myotubularin family enzymes. The term accurately captures the specific chemical reaction catalyzed and distinguishes this activity from other phosphoinositide phosphatases. The molecular function term correctly describes the enzymatic activity without over-specifying biological context.'

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: UNNECESSARY
  notes: 'The taxonomic restrictions show inconsistent scopes across condition sets without clear biological justification. Conditions 1-2 are restricted to Primates while condition 3 applies to all Eukaryota. Myotubularin phosphatases are conserved across eukaryotes and the Primates-specific restrictions appear unnecessary unless there is compelling evidence for lineage-specific functional differences. This inconsistency suggests annotation bias rather than biological reality.'
