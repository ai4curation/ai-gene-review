review_summary: 'This is a problematic mega-rule that attempts to unify too many diverse serine hydrolase families under a single keyword annotation. With 62 condition sets covering evolutionarily distant enzyme families (cutinases, lipases, carboxylesterases, acetylcholinesterases, etc.), the rule lacks biological coherence and specificity. The annotation "serine esterase" is overly broad and provides minimal functional insight. The rule exhibits signs of data mining artifacts rather than principled biochemical classification.'
action: REMOVE
action_rationale: 'This mega-rule should be removed because: (1) It conflates functionally distinct enzyme families with different substrate specificities and biological roles; (2) The broad "serine esterase" annotation provides minimal functional value compared to existing InterPro family annotations; (3) The 62 condition sets suggest over-fitting to training data rather than capturing true biochemical relationships; (4) Many individual families warrant specific GO molecular function terms rather than a generic keyword; (5) The rule complexity makes it unmaintainable and prone to false positives.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Replace this mega-rule with family-specific rules that assign appropriate GO molecular function terms'
- 'Create separate rules for major enzyme classes (cutinases → GO:0008849, lipases → GO:0004806, carboxylesterases → GO:0004091)'
- 'Limit condition sets per rule to <10 to ensure biological coherence'
- 'Use GO molecular function terms instead of broad keyword annotations'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'Rule has 62 condition sets covering 35 unique InterPro domains - far exceeds reasonable complexity limits. Many condition sets target functionally distinct enzyme families that should have separate rules. The rule appears to be an artifact of aggressive data mining rather than principled enzyme classification.'
literature_support:
  assessment: CONTRADICTED
  notes: 'While individual enzyme families are well-characterized, literature does not support grouping such diverse hydrolases under a single functional annotation. Cutinases, lipases, carboxylesterases, and acetylcholinesterases have distinct substrate specificities, biological roles, and evolutionary origins.'

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'Many condition sets share structural domains (alpha/beta hydrolase fold variants) but target functionally distinct enzyme families. Structural similarity does not justify functional annotation similarity. Multiple condition sets likely capture overlapping protein sets.'

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'Rule only assigns keyword annotation "serine esterase" rather than specific GO molecular function terms. Individual families should receive appropriate specific terms like GO:0008849 (cutinase activity), GO:0004806 (triglyceride lipase activity), GO:0004091 (carboxylesterase activity).'

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'Rule spans bacteria to mammals (44/62 sets have taxonomic restrictions) but groups functionally distinct enzymes. Individual families may justify specific taxonomic scopes, but the mega-rule artificially broadens scope across unrelated lineages.'
