review_summary: |
  ARBA00027624 is a severely problematic annotation rule that attempts to capture "organelle 
  membrane" localization using an inappropriately complex design. The rule contains 304 condition 
  sets spanning 406 CATH FunFam domains, 68 InterPro domains, 7 PANTHER families across 63 
  taxonomic groups ranging from specific genera to entire kingdoms.
  
  The fundamental flaw lies in using GO:0031090 "organelle membrane" - an overly broad cellular 
  component term that encompasses membranes from completely different organelles with distinct 
  targeting mechanisms, import pathways, and biological functions. The rule conflates nuclear 
  membrane proteins (using nuclear import machinery), mitochondrial membrane proteins (using 
  TOM/TIM complexes), ER membrane proteins (using signal recognition particles), chloroplast 
  proteins (using TOC/TIC complexes), and many others under a single annotation.
  
  Analysis reveals that 67% of condition sets (204/304) contain only single FunFam domains, 
  indicating promiscuous annotation patterns likely to generate false positives. The taxonomic 
  diversity is biologically unjustifiable, spanning plant-specific clades (BOP clade), mammalian 
  orders (Primates, Rodentia), fungal classes (Saccharomycetes), and broad eukaryotic groups 
  without mechanistic basis for such breadth.
  
  The rule violates multiple best practices: it exceeds complexity limits (>12 condition sets), 
  uses inappropriate GO terms (too broad), lacks biological coherence, and creates high false 
  positive risk. GO curators have raised concerns about such rules in the issue tracker, and 
  this rule exemplifies why overly broad annotation approaches are problematic.
  
  Recommendation: Remove this rule entirely and replace with specific rules targeting individual 
  organelles using appropriate GO terms and mechanistically coherent protein families.
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: |
  This rule represents a fundamental failure in annotation design with multiple critical issues:
  
  1. EXCESSIVE COMPLEXITY: 304 condition sets is 25 times larger than the recommended maximum, 
     making the rule unmanageable and impossible to properly curate or validate.
  
  2. OVERLY BROAD GO TERM: GO:0031090 "organelle membrane" is far too general, encompassing 
     membranes of nuclear envelope, mitochondria, ER, Golgi, peroxisomes, chloroplasts, and 
     many others. This provides no meaningful biological insight.
  
  3. NO BIOLOGICAL COHERENCE: The rule groups together proteins solely based on potential 
     membrane association without any shared biochemical function, cellular process, 
     structural mechanism, or evolutionary relationship.
  
  4. MECHANISTIC INCOHERENCE: Different organelles use completely distinct targeting and 
     insertion mechanisms (nuclear import, TOM/TIM complexes, signal recognition particles, 
     TOC/TIC complexes, PTS targeting) that cannot be meaningfully grouped together.
  
  5. HIGH FALSE POSITIVE RISK: Many domains appear in cytoplasmic proteins, secreted proteins, 
     or proteins with dual localizations that would be incorrectly annotated.
  
  6. INAPPROPRIATE TAXONOMIC SCOPE: The rule spans from individual genera (Mus, Arabidopsis) 
     to entire kingdoms (Eukaryota) without biological justification for such diversity.
  
  This rule should be replaced with specific, mechanistically coherent rules targeting individual 
  organelles with appropriate GO terms like GO:0005635 (nuclear envelope), GO:0005743 
  (mitochondrial inner membrane), etc.
suggested_modifications:
- Deprecate the entire rule as it violates fundamental principles of GO annotation
- Replace with specific rules for individual organelles using appropriate GO terms
- Limit condition sets to <12 per rule with mechanistic coherence
- Use specific organelle membrane terms instead of the overly broad GO:0031090
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: |
    The rule contains 304 condition sets, which is 25 times larger than the recommended 
    maximum of 12. This extreme complexity makes the rule unmanageable, impossible to 
    properly validate, and computationally expensive to analyze. The large number of 
    condition sets (406 unique CATH FunFam domains, 68 InterPro domains) suggests 
    fundamental design problems rather than biological necessity.
literature_support:
  assessment: CONTRADICTED
  notes: |
    The rule contradicts established knowledge about organelle targeting mechanisms. 
    Scientific literature clearly demonstrates that different organelles use distinct 
    targeting and import mechanisms that cannot be grouped under a single annotation. 
    GO curation guidelines recommend against using overly broad terms like GO:0031090, 
    favoring specific organelle terms instead.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: |
    With 406 unique CATH FunFam domains across 304 condition sets, there is likely 
    substantial but unmeasurable overlap. The diversity of domains and the fact that 
    67% of condition sets contain single domains suggests extensive redundancy and 
    promiscuous annotation patterns.

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: |
    GO:0031090 "organelle membrane" is far too broad, encompassing membranes from nuclear 
    envelope, mitochondria, ER, Golgi, peroxisomes, chloroplasts, and many other organelles. 
    This term provides no meaningful biological insight and conflicts with GO guidelines 
    that recommend specific subcellular localization terms.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: |
    The rule spans 63 taxonomic groups from individual genera (Mus, Arabidopsis) to 
    entire kingdoms (Eukaryota) without biological justification. Different organelle 
    targeting mechanisms evolved independently and are not conserved at such broad 
    taxonomic levels. The scope conflates plant-specific organelles (chloroplasts) 
    with animal-specific features without mechanistic basis.
