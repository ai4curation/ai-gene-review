description: 'A complex mega-rule with 86 condition sets attempting to annotate all aminopeptidases across multiple mechanistic families (M1, M24, M2, M49, S33) with only a keyword annotation. The rule spans diverse catalytic mechanisms (zinc-dependent, iron-dependent, serine proteases) and biological functions (protein degradation, methionine removal, hormone processing) without appropriate GO term annotations.'

review_summary: 'ARBA00022438 represents a well-intentioned but flawed attempt to systematically annotate aminopeptidases. While the biological basis is sound (all targets are indeed aminopeptidases), the rule suffers from several critical issues: (1) excessive complexity with 86 condition sets making human validation impractical, (2) mechanistic incoherence by combining zinc-dependent metalloproteases, iron-dependent methionine aminopeptidases, and serine proteases, (3) complete absence of GO term annotations despite covering enzymes with diverse molecular functions, and (4) potential for high false positive rates due to overlapping domain architectures. The rule requires decomposition into mechanistically coherent, family-specific rules with proper GO annotations.'
action: MODIFY
action_rationale: 'While the core biological concept is correct (all targets are aminopeptidases), the rule design is fundamentally flawed. The 86 condition sets create unmanageable complexity and attempt to unify mechanistically distinct enzyme families. Most critically, the rule provides only keyword annotation (KW-0031) without essential GO terms like GO:0004177 (aminopeptidase activity) and GO:0006508 (proteolysis). The rule should be decomposed into focused rules for specific families (M1, M24, M2, etc.) with appropriate molecular function and biological process annotations.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Decompose into family-specific rules: separate rules for M1 (leucyl aminopeptidases), M24 (methionine aminopeptidases), M2 (ACE family), M49 (dipeptidylpeptidases)'
- 'Add essential GO annotations: GO:0004177 (aminopeptidase activity), GO:0006508 (proteolysis), family-specific molecular function terms'
- 'Reduce condition sets per rule to <20 for maintainability and validation'
- 'Implement appropriate taxonomic boundaries based on family distribution'
- 'Consider substrate specificity differences when designing replacement rules'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'With 86 condition sets covering 62 unique InterPro domains across multiple peptidase families, this rule exceeds reasonable complexity thresholds. The rule attempts to unify mechanistically distinct aminopeptidase families (M1, M24, M2, M49, S33) that differ in cofactor requirements, substrate specificity, and biological roles. This violates the principle that rules should target coherent, mechanistically related protein sets.'

    supporting_text: 'With 86 condition sets, this rule is among the most complex in the ARBA system. The high complexity suggests: (1) Over-ambitious scope: Trying to capture too many mechanistically distinct families, (2) Maintenance burden: Nearly impossible to manually validate all combinations, (3) False positive risk: High likelihood of annotating non-aminopeptidases'
literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE
  notes: 'Aminopeptidases are well-characterized enzymes with strong literature support for their catalytic activities. However, the literature clearly supports family-specific classification based on catalytic mechanisms, cofactor requirements, and substrate specificities rather than a pan-family approach. The MEROPS database provides definitive classification supporting mechanistic families.'

Shows functional diversity requires focused annotation approaches'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'With 86 condition sets and 62 unique InterPro domains, substantial overlap is inevitable. Many domains appear in multiple peptidase families, and the rule combines conditions for mechanistically distinct families. This creates complex overlap patterns that increase false positive risk and make the rule difficult to maintain and validate.'

    supporting_text: 'The rule includes 62 unique InterPro domains across multiple peptidase families: M1 family (leucyl/methionyl aminopeptidases), M24 family (methionine aminopeptidases), M2 family (angiotensin-converting enzyme), M49 family (dipeptidylpeptidases), S33 family (prolyl tripeptidyl peptidases). This diversity suggests the rule is attempting to unify evolutionarily and mechanistically distinct enzyme families.'
go_specificity:
  assessment: MISSING
  notes: 'Critical issue: The rule provides NO GO term annotations, only keyword KW-0031 "Aminopeptidase". This is completely inadequate for enzyme annotation. Aminopeptidases should minimally have GO:0004177 (aminopeptidase activity) and GO:0006508 (proteolysis). Family-specific rules should include more specific molecular function terms reflecting substrate specificity and cofactor requirements.'

    supporting_text: 'Critical Issue: The rule only provides keyword annotation but lacks GO terms. Aminopeptidases should be annotated with: GO:0004177 (aminopeptidase activity) - molecular function, GO:0006508 (proteolysis) - biological process, Specific cellular component terms based on localization'
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'The rule spans multiple kingdoms with taxon-specific conditions (Bacillati, Pezizomycotina) while also having universal conditions. This mixed approach creates inconsistency and potential for inappropriate cross-kingdom annotations. Some aminopeptidase families are universal (M24) while others are lineage-specific, requiring different taxonomic strategies.'
