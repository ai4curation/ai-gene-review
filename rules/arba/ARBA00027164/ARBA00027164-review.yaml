review_summary: >
  This extraordinarily complex mega-rule contains 51 condition sets that span virtually 
  the entire spectrum of RNA catabolic activities. While the GO term GO:0006401 (RNA catabolic process) 
  is appropriately broad to encompass all these functions, the rule suffers from severe over-complexity 
  that makes it essentially unmaintainable and scientifically questionable. The rule combines functionally 
  distinct enzyme families (exoribonucleases, endoribonucleases, helicases, decapping enzymes, deadenylases) 
  with different mechanisms, substrate specificities, and cellular roles under a single annotation. 
  Many condition sets have highly specific taxonomic restrictions that appear arbitrary and inconsistent. 
  The sheer size exceeds analysis capabilities (>12 condition sets), indicating fundamental design problems. 
  This represents a prime example of annotation rule pathology where breadth sacrifices biological 
  specificity and creates a maintenance nightmare.
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: >
  This mega-rule is fundamentally flawed and should be completely retired. With 51 condition sets, 
  it violates basic principles of rule design that prioritize maintainability, biological coherence, 
  and interpretability. The rule conflates functionally distinct RNA processing mechanisms under an 
  overly broad GO term, creating a scientifically meaningless annotation. The taxonomic restrictions 
  are inconsistent and often arbitrary (e.g., restricting some helicases to fungi while others span 
  all eukaryotes). The rule is too complex for standard analysis tools and creates more confusion 
  than value. It should be replaced with multiple specific rules for distinct enzyme families: 
  separate rules for 3'-5' exoribonucleases (with appropriate MF terms), 5'-3' exoribonucleases, 
  mRNA decapping enzymes (GO:0031087), deadenylases (GO:0071042), RNA helicases (with specific 
  helicase activity terms), etc. Each would have coherent biological scope, appropriate GO specificity, 
  and manageable condition sets.
suggested_modifications:
- Replace with multiple specific rules for distinct enzyme families
- Use more specific GO terms for different RNA catabolic mechanisms
- Remove arbitrary taxonomic restrictions
- Limit condition sets to <12 per rule for maintainability
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: >
    With 51 condition sets, this rule is pathologically complex and violates all principles 
    of parsimony. The rule attempts to capture too many distinct enzymatic activities under 
    a single annotation, creating an unmaintainable and biologically incoherent system. 
    Many condition sets target the same protein families with slight variations, suggesting 
    redundancy. The complexity exceeds the capability of standard analysis tools (>12 condition 
    set limit), indicating fundamental design failure.
literature_support:
  assessment: WEAK
  notes: >
    While individual enzyme families within this rule have strong literature support for their 
    specific RNA catabolic functions, there is no biological justification for grouping such 
    mechanistically diverse enzymes under a single broad annotation. The literature clearly 
    distinguishes between different types of RNA catabolism - mRNA deadenylation, decapping, 
    exoribonuclease activity, endonuclease activity, etc. - as distinct processes with different 
    regulatory mechanisms, substrate specificities, and biological roles. Lumping them together 
    under GO:0006401 obscures these important functional distinctions.

      Rule combines 51 condition sets spanning exoribonucleases (3'-5' and 5'-3'), 
      endoribonucleases (T2 family), mRNA decapping enzymes (DcpS), deadenylases (PARN, CCR4), 
      RNA helicases (Ski2, MTR4), exosome components, and other RNA processing factors with 
      completely different mechanisms and substrate specificities
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: >
    Due to the rule's extreme complexity (51 condition sets), automated overlap analysis is 
    impossible. However, manual inspection reveals likely significant redundancy. Multiple 
    condition sets target related enzyme families with overlapping domain architectures. 
    For example, several FunFam conditions target different variants of the same enzymes 
    (e.g., multiple PARN-like ribonucleases, multiple exosome components, multiple CCR4-NOT subunits). 
    The taxonomic restrictions appear to create artificial distinctions between essentially 
    the same enzyme families in different organisms.

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: >
    GO:0006401 (RNA catabolic process) is far too broad for this diverse collection of enzyme families. 
    More specific child terms should be used for distinct mechanisms - GO:0031087 (deadenylation-independent 
    decapping of nuclear-transcribed mRNA), GO:0071042 (nuclear mRNA surveillance), GO:0000288 
    (nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process), GO:0034427 (nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, 
    exonucleolytic, 3'-5'), etc. The current annotation obscures the important mechanistic and 
    functional distinctions between these different types of RNA catabolism.

      GO:0006401 has numerous specific child terms for different types of RNA catabolism including 
      mRNA deadenylation (GO:0071042), decapping (GO:0031087), 3'-5' exonucleolytic degradation 
      (GO:0034427), 5'-3' exonucleolytic degradation (GO:0034428), endoribonuclease activity 
      (various terms), each with distinct mechanisms and regulation
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_NARROW
  notes: >
    The taxonomic restrictions across condition sets are inconsistent and often arbitrary. 
    Many enzyme families that are highly conserved across eukaryotes are restricted to specific 
    lineages without clear biological justification. For example, some RNA helicases are restricted 
    to fungi while others span all eukaryotes, despite similar functions. Some exoribonucleases 
    are restricted to plants while others have no taxonomic limits. These restrictions appear 
    to reflect historical annotation bias rather than genuine functional differences.

      Inconsistent taxonomic restrictions - some condition sets restrict Ski2 helicase to fungi, 
      others to eukaryotes; some restrict exoribonucleases to primates, others to plants; 
      zinc finger proteins restricted to Mus vs mammals - these appear arbitrary given the 
      conserved nature of RNA catabolism
