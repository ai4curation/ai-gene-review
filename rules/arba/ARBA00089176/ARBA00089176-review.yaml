description: This rule predicts GO:1990840 (response to lectin) for primate proteins
  using two distinct condition sets. Condition set 1 requires non-specific serine/threonine
  protein kinase domains (FunFams 1.10.510.10:FF:000011 and 3.30.200.20:FF:000069)
  in Primates (NCBITaxon:9443). Condition set 2 requires E1A binding protein p300
  domains (FunFams 1.10.246.20:FF:000001 and 1.20.1020.10:FF:000001) in Catarrhini
  (NCBITaxon:9526, Old World monkeys and apes).

review_summary: 'ARBA00089176 predicts "response to lectin" for two mechanistically
  distinct protein families in primates: serine/threonine kinases and p300/CBP histone
  acetyltransferases. The rule shows multiple concerning features: (1) very low overlap
  between domain conditions and existing GO:1990840 annotations (3-9% for kinases,
  3-40% for p300), suggesting poor predictive accuracy; (2) complete redundancy in
  condition set 2 (Jaccard 1.0 for p300 domains); (3) lack of obvious mechanistic
  connection between these two protein families and lectin response; (4) questionable
  taxonomic specificity to primates/Catarrhini for what might be a conserved cellular
  response. The biological rationale for this rule is unclear and requires deep research
  validation to determine if there is experimental evidence linking these specific
  protein families to lectin response pathways.'
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: This rule should be deprecated due to fundamental design flaws that
  create unacceptably high false positive risk. While deep research confirms that
  RAF1 and p300 do participate in DC-SIGN-mediated lectin signaling, the generic domain
  signatures used are not diagnostic for lectin responsiveness. Both serine/threonine
  kinase and p300 domains are shared by hundreds of proteins across diverse signaling
  pathways. The very low overlap with existing GO:1990840 annotations (3-40%) empirically
  validates this concern. Additionally, the primate/Catarrhini taxonomic restrictions
  are unjustified given the conservation of lectin response pathways across mammals.
  The rule conflates downstream effectors with pathway-specific components. A properly
  designed lectin response rule would require lectin-receptor or pathway-proximal
  signatures (CTLD domains, Syk-binding motifs, CARD9/BCL10/MALT1 domains) rather
  than generic effectors that participate in many immune and signaling pathways.
suggested_modifications:
- Redesign rule to require lectin-receptor signatures (CTLD domains) or pathway-proximal
  adaptors (Syk-binding motifs, CARD9/BCL10/MALT1 domains) instead of generic downstream
  effectors
- If downstream kinases must be included, add co-occurrence requirements with CLR
  pathway components to establish pathway context
- Remove primate/Catarrhini taxonomic restrictions and expand to Mammalia or Vertebrata
  given pathway conservation
- Remove redundant p300 domain condition (either 1.10.246.20:FF:000001 or 1.20.1020.10:FF:000001)
  as they show complete overlap
- Consider alternative GO terms such as "regulation of NF-kappaB signaling" or "innate
  immune response" for proteins matching only generic kinase/p300 domains without
  CLR pathway context
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: The rule combines two completely disjoint condition sets targeting unrelated
    protein families (kinases vs acetyltransferases) with no mechanistic unity beyond
    both potentially participating in downstream lectin signaling. Condition set 2
    also shows complete internal redundancy (Jaccard 1.0 for p300 domains). This complexity
    is not justified by biological necessity. If lectin-specific annotation is desired,
    a more parsimonious approach would require lectin-receptor or pathway-proximal
    signatures (CTLD, Syk motifs, CARD9 domains) rather than generic downstream effectors.
    The current design creates unnecessary complexity and false positive risk.

literature_support:
  assessment: WEAK
  notes: Deep research reveals that lectin responses in mammals are mediated by C-type
    lectin receptors (CLRs) including DC-SIGN and Dectin-1, which signal through Syk
    and CARD9 pathways. There is specific evidence that DC-SIGN triggers RAF1 (a serine/threonine
    kinase) activation, which leads to p300-mediated acetylation of NF-kappaB p65.
    However, the rule targets generic "non-specific serine/threonine kinase" and "p300"
    domains that are shared by hundreds of proteins across diverse signaling pathways.
    The literature shows these molecules can participate in lectin signaling, but
    their domain presence is not diagnostic for lectin responsiveness. Both Perplexity
    and Falcon research emphasize that these domains are multifunctional and widely
    reused, creating high false positive risk. The low overlap with existing GO:1990840
    annotations (3-40%) supports this concern.

    protein families. The moderate overlap within condition set 1 (Jaccard 0.45) suggests
    some but not complete redundancy between the two kinase domains. Overall, the
    rule shows inefficient condition design with unnecessary duplication in one set
    and questionable unification of disjoint protein families under a single GO annotation.

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: GO:1990840 "response to lectin" is an appropriate term for proteins directly
    involved in lectin recognition and signaling. Deep research confirms this term
    is used in recent human datasets (NAFLD, AMI, sepsis transcriptomics). However,
    applying it based solely on generic kinase or p300 domains is too broad. The term
    should be reserved for proteins with lectin-receptor or adaptor signatures proximal
    to CLR signaling (e.g., CTLD domains, Syk-binding motifs, CARD9/BCL10/ MALT1 domains).
    Generic serine/threonine kinases and p300 are downstream effectors that participate
    in many signaling pathways. More appropriate terms for proteins matching only
    these domains would be "regulation of NF-kappaB signaling" or "innate immune response"
    when additional evidence links them to PRR contexts.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_NARROW
  notes: The rule restricts condition set 1 to Primates and condition set 2 to Catarrhini,
    which is inappropriately narrow for mammalian lectin response pathways. Deep research
    confirms that CLR signaling (Dectin-1, DC-SIGN) and complement lectin pathways
    are broadly conserved across vertebrates. Studies in both humans and mice document
    conserved CLR-triggered signaling through Syk, CARD9, and downstream kinases.
    The restriction to primates/catarrhines appears to reflect annotation database
    biases rather than biological differences. If this rule were to be retained (which
    is not recommended), the taxonomic scope should expand to Mammalia or Vertebrata,
    as the core lectin response mechanisms are not primate-specific.
