review_summary: 'This rule represents an overly broad approach to serine protease annotation that groups together functionally diverse enzymes under a single generic GO term. While mechanistically correct (all proteins share serine protease catalytic mechanism), the rule sacrifices biological specificity for comprehensive coverage. The 36 condition sets span multiple kingdoms and functional classes, creating maintenance complexity and reducing annotation value. Key concerns include potential false positives (e.g., Protein S cofactor), loss of functional context, and missed opportunities for more specific GO annotations.'
action: MODIFY
action_rationale: 'While the rule correctly identifies serine proteases, it requires significant modification to improve biological utility. The current approach groups functionally diverse proteases under an overly generic GO term. Recommended modifications include: (1) splitting into functional subfamilies (hemostasis, immunity, digestion, processing), (2) applying more specific GO terms, (3) excluding known cofactors like Protein S, and (4) adding substrate specificity where appropriate. The rule complexity (36 condition sets) also poses maintenance challenges.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Split into functional subfamilies: hemostasis proteases, complement proteases, digestive enzymes, and proprotein convertases'
- 'Apply function-specific GO terms instead of generic serine-type peptidase activity'
- 'Remove Protein S and other cofactor proteins that lack peptidase activity'
- 'Add quality filters to exclude pseudoenzymes and inactive variants'
- 'Consider substrate specificity annotations where well-characterized'
- 'Reduce complexity by consolidating redundant condition sets'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'With 36 condition sets, this rule exceeds reasonable complexity limits and analysis capabilities. Many condition sets target highly specific protease subfamilies that could be consolidated or treated as separate rules. The diversity of functional classes (blood coagulation, complement, digestion, processing) suggests this represents multiple distinct annotation problems conflated into a single rule.'
literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE
  notes: 'Strong mechanistic support for serine protease classification, but literature reveals significant functional heterogeneity that challenges the unified annotation approach. Individual protease families are well-characterized, but grouping under generic peptidase activity loses important biological context.'

    supporting_text: 'Serine proteases utilize a catalytic triad consisting of serine, histidine, and aspartate residues. The serine residue acts as the nucleophile, attacking the peptide bond of substrate proteins. This mechanism is highly conserved across diverse serine protease families.'

    supporting_text: 'While mechanistically correct, the rule would benefit from subdivision into functionally coherent groups with more specific GO annotations. The current form risks providing annotations that are technically accurate but biologically uninformative.'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'Unable to perform quantitative analysis due to excessive number of condition sets (36 > 12 limit). However, manual inspection reveals potential redundancy among CATH FunFam conditions targeting related protease subfamilies. Multiple condition sets target similar functional classes (e.g., multiple MASP1 variants, multiple furin-related sequences) suggesting consolidation opportunities.'

    supporting_text: 'Multiple condition sets target related proteases: MASP1 variants (conditions 6,12), furin-related (conditions 7,10), and overlapping complement factors'
go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'GO:0008236 (serine-type peptidase activity) is overly generic for the diverse functional classes represented. More specific child terms exist for blood coagulation factors, complement proteases, digestive enzymes, and proprotein convertases that would provide greater biological insight.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00027399/ARBA00027399-deep-research-analysis.md
    supporting_text: 'More appropriate specific terms exist for many families: GO:0004252 (serine-type endopeptidase activity) for digestive enzymes, GO:0016485 (protein processing) for proprotein convertases'
  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00027399/ARBA00027399-deep-research-manual.md
    supporting_text: 'The GO term "serine-type peptidase activity" (GO:0008236) is extremely broad and provides limited functional information. Many of the included proteases have highly specific biological functions that would be better captured by more specific child terms.'
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: 'Most taxonomic restrictions appear well-justified based on known phylogenetic distribution of protease families. Lepidosauria restriction for basic trypsin-like proteases, Primates for complement factors, and Bacteria for DegS are biologically appropriate. However, some universal applications may need review.'
