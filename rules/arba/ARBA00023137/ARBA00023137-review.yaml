review_summary: 'This ARBA rule demonstrates severe design problems that make it unsuitable for automated protein annotation. With 98 condition sets, it violates basic principles of parsimony and maintainability. The rule attempts to capture diverse types of kinases (tyrosine kinases, dual-specificity kinases, receptor kinases, non-receptor kinases) using an inconsistent mixture of broad InterPro families, specific CATH FunFam families, and PANTHER families. Many condition sets appear redundant or overly specific, suggesting the rule evolved through ad hoc additions rather than systematic design. Most critically, the rule provides only a generic UniProt keyword rather than specific GO molecular function terms, making it less useful for functional annotation. The broad taxonomic scope (bacteria to mammals) is inappropriate given that many condition sets target lineage-specific kinases.'
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: 'This rule should be deprecated and replaced with a smaller set of well-designed rules. The current rule is overly complex (98 condition sets), provides minimal functional information (keyword only), and likely generates many false positives due to promiscuous domain matching. A better approach would be to create separate rules for distinct kinase subfamilies (e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, dual-specificity kinases) with appropriate GO molecular function terms and proper taxonomic restrictions. The high number of condition sets makes this rule unmaintainable and impossible to validate systematically.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Replace with separate rules for major kinase subfamilies'
- 'Use specific GO molecular function terms instead of generic keywords'
- 'Reduce condition sets to <12 per rule for maintainability'
- 'Apply appropriate taxonomic restrictions based on kinase evolution'
- 'Eliminate redundant condition sets that capture overlapping protein sets'
- 'Focus on high-specificity CATH FunFam families rather than broad InterPro families'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'The rule contains 98 condition sets, which far exceeds the recommended maximum of 12 for maintainable rules. Analysis is computationally infeasible due to the number of pairwise comparisons required (4,753 pairs). The rule appears to have grown through incremental additions without systematic review, resulting in likely redundancy between condition sets. The mixture of broad InterPro domains, specific CATH FunFam families, and PANTHER families suggests inconsistent curation criteria.'
literature_support:
  assessment: WEAK
  notes: 'While the general concept of using kinase domains to identify kinases is well-supported, this specific rule design lacks literature support. The combination of diverse kinase types in a single rule contradicts established kinase classification schemes. The use of generic keywords instead of specific GO terms is not aligned with current best practices in protein function annotation.'

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'With 98 condition sets, systematic overlap analysis is computationally prohibited. However, manual inspection reveals concerning patterns: multiple condition sets target the same kinase subfamilies using different domain combinations, suggesting substantial redundancy. For example, multiple condition sets target receptor tyrosine kinases, dual-specificity kinases, and other kinase types through different combinations of InterPro, CATH, and PANTHER signatures. This redundancy likely leads to multiple annotations of the same proteins.'

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'The rule applies only a UniProt keyword (Tyrosine-protein kinase) rather than GO molecular function terms. This is problematic because: (1) the rule captures diverse kinase types beyond tyrosine kinases (including dual-specificity and serine/threonine kinases), making the keyword inaccurate; (2) GO molecular function terms like GO:0004713 (protein tyrosine kinase activity) would provide more precise and standardized functional annotation; (3) different kinase subfamilies should receive different GO terms reflecting their specific activities.'

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'The rule applies across an inappropriately broad taxonomic range from bacteria to mammals. While 17 of 98 condition sets have taxonomic restrictions, many kinase subfamilies have lineage-specific evolutionary origins that are not properly captured. For example, receptor tyrosine kinases are primarily metazoan innovations, yet some condition sets apply them broadly to eukaryotes. The taxonomic restrictions that do exist appear inconsistent and may not reflect actual evolutionary distribution of kinase families.'
