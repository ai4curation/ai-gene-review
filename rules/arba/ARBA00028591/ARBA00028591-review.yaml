review_summary: >-
  This rule represents a comprehensive OR-logic annotation strategy covering the full
  spectrum of lipid metabolism across all domains of life. The 381 condition sets capture:
  (1) Terpene/isoprenoid biosynthesis (terpene synthases, squalene synthases, prenyl
  transferases), (2) Fatty acid metabolism (ELOVL elongases, ACSL ligases, acyl-CoA
  oxidases/dehydrogenases, fatty acid desaturases), (3) Phospholipid biosynthesis
  (CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferases, LPLAT acyltransferases, DGAT), (4) Sterol
  metabolism (squalene synthase/epoxidase, squalene cyclase, CYP51 demethylase), (5)
  Lipid remodeling and catabolism (phospholipases A2/D, patatin-like lipases, lipoxygenases),
  (6) Sphingolipid metabolism (ceramide synthases, sphingomyelinases), and (7) Lipid
  transport/signaling (OSBP/ORP proteins). The condition sets use InterPro domains,
  PANTHER subfamilies, and CATH FunFams combined with taxonomic restrictions to achieve
  specificity. While GO:0006629 (lipid metabolic process) is appropriate as a conservative
  umbrella term, many condition sets could benefit from more specific child terms for
  biosynthesis, catabolism, or transport. The rule logic is sound: broad lipid enzyme
  superfamilies (AMP-binding, P450, CDP-alcohol transferases) are filtered by subfamily
  signatures and taxonomic scope to reduce false positives. Recent literature (2023-2025)
  validates family-level lipid biology across structural/functional studies, disease
  genetics, and systems biology.

action: ACCEPT
action_rationale: >-
  The rule is biologically sound and well-constructed. GO:0006629 (lipid metabolic
  process) is an appropriate conservative annotation for this highly diverse set of
  lipid enzymes. The use of 381 OR condition sets captures the true biological diversity
  of lipid metabolism—from terpenoid biosynthesis in plants to sphingolipid remodeling
  in mammals to bacterial lipid A modification. Each condition set combines domain
  signatures with taxonomic filters to achieve specificity, which is essential given
  that many of the constituent superfamilies (P450, AMP-binding, short-chain dehydrogenases)
  are highly multifunctional. The rule successfully balances recall (capturing diverse
  lipid enzymes) with precision (avoiding false positives through subfamily and taxon
  filters). While individual condition sets could potentially use more specific GO
  terms (e.g., fatty acid elongation for ELOVL, sterol biosynthesis for squalene
  cyclase), maintaining the parent term GO:0006629 ensures consistent annotation across
  the rule and avoids the complexity of managing 381 different GO term assignments.
  The literature support is strong, with recent 2023-2025 publications validating
  enzyme family roles in lipid homeostasis, disease, and metabolism.

suggested_modifications:
  - Consider adding more specific child terms for major enzyme classes where subfamily resolution permits (e.g., GO:0030497 fatty acid elongation for ELOVL, GO:0016126 sterol biosynthetic process for squalene cyclase/CYP51, GO:0016114 terpenoid biosynthetic process for terpene synthases)
  - For condition sets using only broad superfamily signatures without subfamily filters, review for potential false positives (especially P450, AMP-binding, short-chain dehydrogenase families)
  - Consider grouping related condition sets with shared biological themes and annotating with process-specific GO terms to improve annotation granularity

parsimony:
  assessment: ACCEPTABLE
  notes: >-
    The 381 condition sets appear non-redundant and capture genuinely distinct enzyme
    families and subfamilies involved in lipid metabolism. Terpene synthases, fatty
    acid elongases, acyl-CoA ligases, phospholipid biosynthesis enzymes, sterol pathway
    enzymes, lipases, and lipoxygenases represent mechanistically distinct pathways
    all legitimately classified under lipid metabolic process. The extensive use of
    OR-logic is appropriate given the genuine functional diversity of lipid metabolism.
    Some condition sets target the same enzyme family in different taxa (e.g., multiple
    terpene synthase FunFams with different taxonomic restrictions), which reflects
    real evolutionary divergence rather than redundancy. The combination of domain
    signatures with subfamily IDs (PANTHER, FunFam) and taxon filters represents a
    parsimonious approach to achieving specificity without creating separate rules
    for each subfamily.

        The rule uses combined domain signatures and taxon filters to reduce false
        positives for broad folds (AMP-binding; P450; CDP-AP). Where possible, require
        subfamily IDs (e.g., CYP51 for sterol; ACSL-typed ANL; LPLAT/DGAT-typed MBOATs)

literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: >-
    The rule is supported by extensive recent literature (2023-2025) validating the
    roles of constituent enzyme families in lipid metabolism. Structural and functional
    studies on MBOAT/LPLAT/DGAT acyltransferases demonstrate defined lipid substrates
    and essential roles in TAG and phospholipid biosynthesis. Plant oil biosynthesis
    engineering studies integrate ELOVL/FADS/ACSL/DGAT pathways connecting enzyme
    families to metabolic outputs. Genetic studies of fatty acid elongation disorders
    demonstrate isoform-specific VLCFA deficits validating ELOVL function. Brain
    lipidome genetics in Alzheimer disease cortex highlight ACSL/ELOVL/PLA2/OSBPL
    expression changes demonstrating in vivo roles in lipid metabolism. Sterol pathway
    enzymes (SQS/SQLE/CYP51) are validated through structural studies, disease research,
    and pharmacology (azole antifungals, terbinafine). Lipoxygenases and phospholipases
    are extensively documented in oxylipin biosynthesis, inflammation, and membrane
    remodeling. Plant terpene synthases are well-characterized in terpenoid defense
    and signaling compound biosynthesis.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: NONE
  notes: >-
    The 381 condition sets are designed to be non-overlapping through the use of
    distinct domain signature combinations and taxonomic restrictions. While some
    enzyme superfamilies appear in multiple condition sets (e.g., cytochrome P450,
    terpene synthases, acyl-CoA dehydrogenases), each condition set specifies different
    InterPro domains, PANTHER subfamilies, CATH FunFams, or taxonomic scopes that
    distinguish them. For example, multiple terpene synthase condition sets exist
    but target different plant lineages or use different FunFam signatures. Multiple
    P450 condition sets capture sterol-specific CYP51, plant-specific oxidases, and
    oxylipin biosynthesis enzymes through subfamily and taxon filters. This stratification
    reflects genuine biological diversity rather than redundancy.

go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: >-
    GO:0006629 (lipid metabolic process) is appropriately general for a rule covering
    381 diverse lipid enzyme families. The term serves as a conservative umbrella
    encompassing biosynthesis, remodeling, catabolism, and transport across all taxa.
    More specific child terms exist and could improve annotation precision for subsets
    of condition sets: fatty acid elongation (GO:0030497) for ELOVL, long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA
    ligase activity (GO:0016297) for ACSL, phospholipid biosynthetic process (GO:0008654)
    for CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferases, triglyceride biosynthetic process (GO:0019432)
    for DGAT, sterol biosynthetic process (GO:0016126) for squalene cyclase/CYP51,
    oxylipin biosynthetic process (GO:0031408) for lipoxygenases, and terpenoid biosynthetic
    process (GO:0016114) for terpene synthases. However, managing 381 condition sets
    with potentially different GO terms would substantially increase rule complexity.
    The current approach prioritizes consistency and broad coverage over maximal specificity.

        (GO:0016114) for plant TPS

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: >-
    The rule appropriately uses taxonomic restrictions to achieve specificity across
    the 381 condition sets. Broad enzyme superfamilies like cytochrome P450, AMP-binding
    ligases, and short-chain dehydrogenases are restricted to specific lineages where
    lipid metabolism functions are validated (e.g., CYP51 sterol demethylase in Mammalia,
    terpene synthases in Viridiplantae, ceramide synthase in Chordata). Some condition
    sets lack taxonomic restrictions when the domain signature combination is sufficiently
    specific (e.g., squalene cyclase domains, alkaline ceramidase). The taxonomic
    scope reflects genuine evolutionary distribution of lipid metabolism pathways:
    terpenoid biosynthesis is particularly elaborate in plants, sterol biosynthesis
    is universal in eukaryotes with lineage-specific variations, sphingolipid biosynthesis
    is enriched in animals, and bacterial lipid A modification is restricted to Gram-negative
    bacteria. The use of both broad scopes (Eukaryota, Bacteria) and narrow scopes
    (genus/family level in plants) appropriately balances coverage with specificity.
