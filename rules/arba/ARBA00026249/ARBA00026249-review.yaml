    notes: Primary condition set requiring three InterPro domain matches, but quantitative
      analysis reveals this reduces to a simple IPR005982 => GO:0004791 rule. All
      65 SwissProt proteins with IPR005982 also have both IPR008255 and IPR023753
      (complete subset, |A-B| = 0 for both pairs). The AND logic requiring all three
      domains is therefore redundant - IPR005982 alone is sufficient. Furthermore,
      this IPR005982 => GO:0004791 mapping already exists in the official InterPro2GO
      file, making this entire condition set completely redundant with existing manual
      curation.

      IPR008255, AND IPR023753 (complete subset, containment = 1.0). This condition
      set is therefore completely redundant with condition set 1, adding no unique

    notes: 'Highly specific condition set for Rattus (rat) cytoplasmic thioredoxin
      reductase 1. Quantitative analysis reveals this provides SUBSTANTIAL unique
      coverage: both FunFams (3.30.390.30:FF:000004 with 17 proteins and 3.50.50.60:FF:000190
      with 18 proteins) are COMPLETELY DISJOINT from IPR005982 (0 overlap), meaning
      they capture ~19 unique proteins that condition set 1 completely misses. While
      all CS3 proteins possess the broad IPR023753 domain (FAD/NAD binding, 869 proteins),
      they LACK the specific IPR005982 thioredoxin reductase domain. This represents
      proteins that may have thioredoxin reductase activity based on FunFam homology
      but are not annotated with the specific InterPro domain. The two FunFams overlap
      heavily with each other (16/17 and 16/18 shared proteins), suggesting they target
      the same protein set. The Rattus taxonomic restriction may be overly narrow,
      but this condition set provides valuable coverage for proteins lacking canonical
      InterPro domain annotations.'

review_summary: This rule exhibits mixed redundancy with InterPro2GO curation. Condition
  set 1 (IPR005982-based) is completely redundant with existing InterPro2GO mapping.
  Condition set 2 (eukaryotic FunFam 3.50.50.60:FF:000064) is also redundant, being
  a complete subset of CS1 with zero unique coverage. However, condition set 3 (Rattus
  FunFams) provides SUBSTANTIAL unique value by capturing ~19 proteins that are COMPLETELY
  DISJOINT from IPR005982. These proteins lack the specific thioredoxin reductase
  InterPro domain but are predicted to have this function based on FunFam homology.
  This represents a valuable use case for automated rules - identifying functionally
  similar proteins that lack canonical domain annotations. The rule should be MODIFIED
  rather than deprecated, retaining only the unique CS3 coverage while removing redundant
  CS1 and CS2.
action: MODIFY
action_rationale: 'This rule exhibits mixed redundancy requiring selective modification.
  Condition sets 1 and 2 are completely redundant and should be removed: CS1''s IPR005982
  => GO:0004791 already exists in InterPro2GO, and CS2''s FunFam is a complete subset
  of CS1 (zero unique coverage). However, condition set 3 provides SUBSTANTIAL unique
  value and should be retained. Quantitative analysis proves CS3''s two FunFams (17
  and 18 proteins) are COMPLETELY DISJOINT from IPR005982 (0 overlap), capturing ~19
  unique proteins that lack the specific thioredoxin reductase InterPro domain. These
  proteins are predicted to have this function based on FunFam homology despite lacking
  canonical domain annotations - this is precisely the gap-filling role that automated
  rules should serve. The rule should be streamlined to contain only CS3, potentially
  broadening the taxonomic scope beyond Rattus to maximize coverage while maintaining
  specificity through the FunFam constraints.'
suggested_modifications:
- Remove condition sets 1 and 2 as completely redundant (CS1 duplicates InterPro2GO,
  CS2 is subset of CS1)
- Retain and enhance condition set 3, which provides ~19 unique proteins disjoint
  from IPR005982
- Consider broadening CS3's taxonomic scope from Rattus (NCBITaxon:10114) to Eukaryota
  (NCBITaxon:2759) or Mammalia to maximize coverage of proteins with FunFam-predicted
  function but lacking InterPro domain annotations
- Alternatively, create a new simplified rule containing only the CS3 FunFams without
  the overly restrictive Rattus constraint
parsimony:
  assessment: ACCEPTABLE
  notes: This rule exhibits mixed parsimony. Condition sets 1 and 2 are completely
    redundant - CS1 duplicates the existing InterPro2GO mapping (IPR005982 => GO:0004791),
    and CS2's FunFam is a complete subset of CS1 (18/18 proteins overlap). However,
    condition set 3 provides unique value by capturing ~19 proteins that are DISJOINT
    from IPR005982. These proteins lack canonical InterPro domain annotations but
    are predicted to have thioredoxin reductase function based on FunFam homology.
    The rule violates parsimony by including redundant CS1 and CS2, but serves a legitimate
    gap-filling role through CS3. The overly restrictive Rattus taxonomic constraint
    in CS3 may limit coverage unnecessarily. An optimally parsimonious version would
    contain only CS3 with broader taxonomic scope, eliminating redundancy while maximizing
    coverage of proteins lacking InterPro annotations.
literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: 'Extensive structural and mechanistic literature spanning multiple decades
    supports this annotation rule. X-ray crystallography of rat TrxR at 3.0 Angstrom
    resolution (PDB 1H6V) reveals the FAD binding domain (residues 1-163, 297-367),
    NADPH binding domain (residues 164-296), and interface domain (residues 368-499)
    with the C-terminal selenocysteine redox center. The C-terminal extension of ~16
    residues containing the Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly motif serves dual functions: (1) extends
    the electron transport chain to the protein surface for thioredoxin reduction,
    and (2) sterically blocks the glutathione binding site. Mammalian TrxRs require
    selenocysteine for efficient catalysis - cysteine substitution reduces activity
    to ~1% of wild-type. Prokaryotic enzymes use a distinct 67-degree domain rotation
    mechanism. Recent work (2024) has identified the "doorstop pocket" at the re-face
    of FAD as a druggable regulatory site, with inhibitors showing efficacy against
    parasitic TGR.'

  notes: 'Quantitative analysis reveals IPR005982 (Thioredoxin reductase) is a complete
    subset of both IPR008255 and IPR023753. Among 65 SwissProt proteins with IPR005982,
    all 65 (100%) also have IPR008255 (class-II active site), and all 65 also have
    IPR023753 (FAD/NAD(P)-binding). This represents appropriate hierarchical specificity:
    IPR005982 provides TrxR family-level specificity (65 proteins), IPR008255 adds
    the class-II active site motif (84 proteins total, including 19 non-TrxR enzymes
    like glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase), and IPR023753 captures
    the broader FAD/NAD(P)-binding architecture (869 proteins across many flavoenzyme
    families). The AND requirement creates a specificity filter that prevents false
    positives from related oxidoreductases. Set difference analysis shows IPR005982
    adds zero unique proteins beyond IPR008255 (|IPR005982 - IPR008255| = 0), but
    this is appropriate - the goal is specificity, not coverage expansion. Jaccard
    similarity of 0.774 between IPR005982 and IPR008255 indicates high but not complete
    overlap, with IPR008255 covering 19 additional class-II enzymes that correctly
    lack the TrxR-specific signature.'

go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: GO:0004791 is at the correct level of specificity. It captures the precise
    enzymatic function (NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reduction) without overgeneralizing
    to broader terms like GO:0016651 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H)
    or GO:0016668 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on a sulfur group of donors, NAD(P)
    as acceptor). While mammalian TrxRs exhibit remarkable substrate promiscuity (selenite,
    lipid hydroperoxides, H2O2, vitamin C, alpha-lipoic acid), thioredoxin remains
    the physiologically primary substrate. The explicit NADPH specification is correct
    as mammalian TrxRs specifically utilize NADPH (not NADH) as electron donor. A
    selenoprotein-specific term would be inappropriately narrow as it would exclude
    functional variants like the nematode mitochondrial TrxR that lacks selenocysteine
    but retains full catalytic competence with its specific substrate.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: 'Set 1 (InterPro-based) has no taxonomic restriction, appropriate as TrxR
    is found across all domains of life. Thioredoxin reductases exist as two evolutionarily
    distinct classes: low-MW (~35 kDa) in bacteria, archaea, plants, fungi, protists
    that uses a 67-degree domain rotation mechanism; and high-MW (~55 kDa) in animals
    that evolved from glutathione reductase (not from bacterial TrxR) with a C-terminal
    selenocysteine extension. Set 2''s eukaryotic restriction is justified as it captures
    both eukaryotic enzyme classes while excluding prokaryotic enzymes. Set 3''s Rattus
    restriction reflects the structural model organism but should be expanded to Mammalia
    since TrxR1 function is highly conserved across mammals with identical catalytic
    mechanisms.'
