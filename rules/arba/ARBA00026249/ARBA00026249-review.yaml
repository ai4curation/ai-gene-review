      notes: >-
        Primary condition set requiring three InterPro domain matches.
        IPR005982 is specific to thioredoxin reductase family and provides the core
        diagnostic specificity. IPR008255 captures the class-II oxidoreductase active
        site (dithiol/disulfide redox chemistry). IPR023753 is a broader FAD/NAD(P)-binding
        domain shared with glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase. The AND
        requirement for all three substantially reduces false positive risk from related
        oxidoreductases.

        Alternative condition set using CATH FunFam classification with eukaryotic

        possess either the high-MW selenocysteine-containing form (animals) or the
        low-MW bacterial-type form (plants, fungi), both with distinctive features
        from prokaryotic enzymes.

        very high sequence identity and identical catalytic mechanisms.

review_summary: >-
  This rule correctly predicts thioredoxin-disulfide reductase (NADPH) activity using
  complementary domain signatures. Thioredoxin reductases exist as two evolutionarily
  distinct enzyme classes: the low-MW form (~35 kDa, found in bacteria, archaea, plants,
  fungi) and the high-MW form (~55 kDa, found in animals, derived from glutathione
  reductase). The three InterPro domains in condition set 1 form a highly specific
  diagnostic signature. IPR005982 provides TrxR family-level specificity, IPR008255
  captures the class-II active site motif, and IPR023753 captures the FAD/NAD(P)-binding
  architecture. The requirement for all three domains substantially reduces false
  positive risk from related oxidoreductases (glutathione reductase, lipoamide
  dehydrogenase). The FunFam-based sets provide alternative annotation paths with
  appropriate eukaryotic restriction. Set 3's Rattus restriction is unnecessarily narrow
  and should be expanded to Mammalia, as TrxR1 function is highly conserved across mammals.

action: MODIFY
action_rationale: >-
  The rule is fundamentally sound with strong literature support from extensive
  structural and mechanistic studies spanning multiple decades. However, the third
  condition set (Rattus-specific) is overly narrow. The restriction to a single genus
  lacks biological justification since mammalian thioredoxin reductases are highly
  conserved - human, mouse, and rat enzymes share very high sequence identity and
  identical catalytic mechanisms. The rat enzyme (PDB 1H6V) has served as a structural
  model for mammalian TrxRs in general. Expansion to Mammalia would increase coverage
  without sacrificing specificity.

suggested_modifications:
  - Expand condition set 3 taxonomic restriction from Rattus to Mammalia
  - Consider adding condition sets for plant thioredoxin reductases (NTRA/NTRB) given their essential role in chloroplast redox signaling
  - Document that TrxR3/TGR (with glutaredoxin domain) will also match and appropriately receive GO:0004791 as one of its multiple activities
  - Consider whether bifunctional NTRC (N-terminal Trx + C-terminal TrxR) matches current domain signatures

parsimony:
  assessment: ACCEPTABLE
  notes: >-
    The rule uses three condition sets where two might suffice. However, having
    both InterPro-based (set 1) and FunFam-based (set 2) approaches provides
    complementary coverage - proteins might match one classification system but
    not the other. IPR023753 (FAD/NAD(P)-binding) is broad and could be considered
    redundant if IPR005982 and a TrxR-focused FunFam are present, but its inclusion
    reflects the required cofactor-binding architecture and does little harm.
    The third set (Rattus) is questionable and may represent a testing phase.

        IPR023753 is broad; its inclusion is supportive but not essential if

literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: >-
    Extensive structural and mechanistic literature spanning multiple decades supports
    this annotation rule. X-ray crystallography of rat TrxR at 3.0 Angstrom resolution
    (PDB 1H6V) reveals the FAD binding domain (residues 1-163, 297-367), NADPH binding
    domain (residues 164-296), and interface domain (residues 368-499) with the
    C-terminal selenocysteine redox center. The C-terminal extension of ~16 residues
    containing the Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly motif serves dual functions: (1) extends the electron
    transport chain to the protein surface for thioredoxin reduction, and (2) sterically
    blocks the glutathione binding site. Mammalian TrxRs require selenocysteine for
    efficient catalysis - cysteine substitution reduces activity to ~1% of wild-type.
    Prokaryotic enzymes use a distinct 67-degree domain rotation mechanism. Recent work
    (2024) has identified the "doorstop pocket" at the re-face of FAD as a druggable
    regulatory site, with inhibitors showing efficacy against parasitic TGR.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: MINOR
  notes: >-
    In condition set 1, IPR005982 (Thioredoxin reductase) and IPR008255 (class-II
    oxidoreductase active site) have some biological overlap as the active site is
    part of the enzyme, but they represent distinct signatures - one for the overall
    family and one for a specific catalytic motif (dithiol/disulfide redox chemistry).
    This is appropriate redundancy for increased specificity. IPR023753 (FAD/NAD(P)-binding)
    is ubiquitous across flavoenzymes and helps distinguish NADPH-utilizing members.
    The class-II designation specifically distinguishes TrxR from class-I pyridine
    nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases, providing a critical specificity filter.

go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: >-
    GO:0004791 is at the correct level of specificity. It captures the precise
    enzymatic function (NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reduction) without overgeneralizing
    to broader terms like GO:0016651 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H) or
    GO:0016668 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on a sulfur group of donors, NAD(P)
    as acceptor). While mammalian TrxRs exhibit remarkable substrate promiscuity
    (selenite, lipid hydroperoxides, H2O2, vitamin C, alpha-lipoic acid), thioredoxin
    remains the physiologically primary substrate. The explicit NADPH specification
    is correct as mammalian TrxRs specifically utilize NADPH (not NADH) as electron
    donor. A selenoprotein-specific term would be inappropriately narrow as it would
    exclude functional variants like the nematode mitochondrial TrxR that lacks
    selenocysteine but retains full catalytic competence with its specific substrate.

      supporting_text: >-
        The nematode Haemonchus contortus contains two distinct TrxRs with notable
        structural differences: a cytoplasmic enzyme with a selenocysteine active
        site motif similar to mammalian TrxR, and a mitochondrial enzyme with a
        unique Gly-Cys-Cys-Gly active site lacking selenocysteine

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: >-
    Set 1 (InterPro-based) has no taxonomic restriction, appropriate as TrxR is found
    across all domains of life. Thioredoxin reductases exist as two evolutionarily
    distinct classes: low-MW (~35 kDa) in bacteria, archaea, plants, fungi, protists
    that uses a 67-degree domain rotation mechanism; and high-MW (~55 kDa) in animals
    that evolved from glutathione reductase (not from bacterial TrxR) with a C-terminal
    selenocysteine extension. Set 2's eukaryotic restriction is justified as it captures
    both eukaryotic enzyme classes while excluding prokaryotic enzymes. Set 3's Rattus
    restriction reflects the structural model organism but should be expanded to
    Mammalia since TrxR1 function is highly conserved across mammals with identical
    catalytic mechanisms.
