    notes: Primary condition set requiring three InterPro domain matches, but quantitative
      analysis reveals this reduces to a simple IPR005982 => GO:0004791 rule. All
      65 SwissProt proteins with IPR005982 also have both IPR008255 and IPR023753
      (complete subset, |A-B| = 0 for both pairs). The AND logic requiring all three
      domains is therefore redundant - IPR005982 alone is sufficient. Furthermore,
      this IPR005982 => GO:0004791 mapping already exists in the official InterPro2GO
      file, making this entire condition set completely redundant with existing manual
      curation.

review_summary: This rule is completely redundant with existing InterPro2GO manual
  curation. Quantitative analysis reveals that condition set 1 reduces to a simple
  IPR005982 => GO:0004791 rule, as all 65 proteins with IPR005982 also possess both
  IPR008255 and IPR023753 (complete subset relationships). The IPR005982 => GO:0004791
  mapping already exists in the official InterPro2GO file, making this ARBA rule provide
  zero novel annotations. While the rule is biologically correct - GO:0004791 is the
  appropriate term for thioredoxin-disulfide reductase activity - it serves only as
  independent validation of existing manual curation rather than filling annotation
  gaps. The FunFam-based condition sets (2 and 3) may provide coverage for proteins
  lacking InterPro annotations, but this has not been quantified. Set 3's Rattus restriction
  is unnecessarily narrow and should be expanded to Mammalia.
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: 'This rule is completely redundant with existing InterPro2GO curation
  and provides zero added value. Condition set 1 reduces to IPR005982 => GO:0004791,
  which already exists in the official InterPro2GO file. The complex three-domain
  AND logic appears to add specificity but quantitative analysis proves otherwise:
  all 65 proteins with IPR005982 automatically have both IPR008255 and IPR023753.
  The rule is biologically correct but serves only as independent validation rather
  than filling annotation gaps. Unless condition sets 2 and 3 provide coverage for
  proteins lacking InterPro domains (which has not been quantified), this rule should
  be removed to avoid redundant maintenance burden and potential inconsistency with
  manual curation.'
suggested_modifications:
- Remove this rule entirely as it duplicates existing InterPro2GO curation
- If retention is required for policy reasons, quantify whether condition sets 2 and
  3 provide unique coverage
- If unique coverage is minimal, deprecate the rule with explanation pointing to InterPro2GO
  as the canonical source
parsimony:
  assessment: REDUNDANT
  notes: This rule violates parsimony principles by duplicating existing InterPro2GO
    curation. Condition set 1 uses three domains where one (IPR005982) is sufficient
    - quantitative analysis proves IPR008255 and IPR023753 add zero specificity as
    all 65 proteins with IPR005982 already possess both. Furthermore, the IPR005982
    => GO:0004791 mapping exists in InterPro2GO, making the entire condition set redundant.
    The rule represents wasted maintenance effort - any updates to this biological
    knowledge must be made in two places (InterPro2GO and this ARBA rule), creating
    risk of inconsistency. The FunFam-based sets may provide complementary coverage
    but this has not been quantified.
literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: 'Extensive structural and mechanistic literature spanning multiple decades
    supports this annotation rule. X-ray crystallography of rat TrxR at 3.0 Angstrom
    resolution (PDB 1H6V) reveals the FAD binding domain (residues 1-163, 297-367),
    NADPH binding domain (residues 164-296), and interface domain (residues 368-499)
    with the C-terminal selenocysteine redox center. The C-terminal extension of ~16
    residues containing the Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly motif serves dual functions: (1) extends
    the electron transport chain to the protein surface for thioredoxin reduction,
    and (2) sterically blocks the glutathione binding site. Mammalian TrxRs require
    selenocysteine for efficient catalysis - cysteine substitution reduces activity
    to ~1% of wild-type. Prokaryotic enzymes use a distinct 67-degree domain rotation
    mechanism. Recent work (2024) has identified the "doorstop pocket" at the re-face
    of FAD as a druggable regulatory site, with inhibitors showing efficacy against
    parasitic TGR.'

  notes: 'Quantitative analysis reveals IPR005982 (Thioredoxin reductase) is a complete
    subset of both IPR008255 and IPR023753. Among 65 SwissProt proteins with IPR005982,
    all 65 (100%) also have IPR008255 (class-II active site), and all 65 also have
    IPR023753 (FAD/NAD(P)-binding). This represents appropriate hierarchical specificity:
    IPR005982 provides TrxR family-level specificity (65 proteins), IPR008255 adds
    the class-II active site motif (84 proteins total, including 19 non-TrxR enzymes
    like glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase), and IPR023753 captures
    the broader FAD/NAD(P)-binding architecture (869 proteins across many flavoenzyme
    families). The AND requirement creates a specificity filter that prevents false
    positives from related oxidoreductases. Set difference analysis shows IPR005982
    adds zero unique proteins beyond IPR008255 (|IPR005982 - IPR008255| = 0), but
    this is appropriate - the goal is specificity, not coverage expansion. Jaccard
    similarity of 0.774 between IPR005982 and IPR008255 indicates high but not complete
    overlap, with IPR008255 covering 19 additional class-II enzymes that correctly
    lack the TrxR-specific signature.'

go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: GO:0004791 is at the correct level of specificity. It captures the precise
    enzymatic function (NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reduction) without overgeneralizing
    to broader terms like GO:0016651 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H)
    or GO:0016668 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on a sulfur group of donors, NAD(P)
    as acceptor). While mammalian TrxRs exhibit remarkable substrate promiscuity (selenite,
    lipid hydroperoxides, H2O2, vitamin C, alpha-lipoic acid), thioredoxin remains
    the physiologically primary substrate. The explicit NADPH specification is correct
    as mammalian TrxRs specifically utilize NADPH (not NADH) as electron donor. A
    selenoprotein-specific term would be inappropriately narrow as it would exclude
    functional variants like the nematode mitochondrial TrxR that lacks selenocysteine
    but retains full catalytic competence with its specific substrate.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: 'Set 1 (InterPro-based) has no taxonomic restriction, appropriate as TrxR
    is found across all domains of life. Thioredoxin reductases exist as two evolutionarily
    distinct classes: low-MW (~35 kDa) in bacteria, archaea, plants, fungi, protists
    that uses a 67-degree domain rotation mechanism; and high-MW (~55 kDa) in animals
    that evolved from glutathione reductase (not from bacterial TrxR) with a C-terminal
    selenocysteine extension. Set 2''s eukaryotic restriction is justified as it captures
    both eukaryotic enzyme classes while excluding prokaryotic enzymes. Set 3''s Rattus
    restriction reflects the structural model organism but should be expanded to Mammalia
    since TrxR1 function is highly conserved across mammals with identical catalytic

    analysis)
  findings:
  - statement: 'Two evolutionarily distinct enzyme classes: low-MW (~35 kDa) in bacteria/
      plants/fungi using 67-degree domain rotation, and high-MW (~55 kDa) in animals
      derived from glutathione reductase with C-terminal selenocysteine extension.'
  - statement: 'The C-terminal extension serves dual functions: (1) extends electron
      transport to the surface for thioredoxin reduction, and (2) sterically blocks
      the glutathione binding site preventing GR activity despite the shared catalytic
      core.'
  - statement: Animals have lost the low-MW form entirely; plants and fungi have lost
      the high-MW form. This mutually exclusive distribution reflects functional redundancy
      - both classes effectively catalyze NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reduction.

  title: Thioredoxin reductase InterPro entry
  findings:
  - statement: Domain signature specific to the thioredoxin reductase family. The
      primary determinant for TrxR specificity when combined with active site and
      cofactor-binding signatures.
