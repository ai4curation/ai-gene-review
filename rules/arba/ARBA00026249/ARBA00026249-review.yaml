review_summary: >-
  This rule correctly predicts thioredoxin-disulfide reductase (NADPH) activity using
  complementary domain signatures. The three InterPro domains in condition set 1
  (IPR005982 for the enzyme family, IPR008255 for the class-II active site, and
  IPR023753 for the FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain) together form a highly specific and
  reliable diagnostic signature. The requirement for all three domains substantially
  reduces false positive risk, as each represents a distinct structural requirement
  for catalytic function. The FunFam-based sets provide alternative annotation paths
  with appropriate eukaryotic restriction (reflecting the selenocysteine-containing
  mechanism of eukaryotic TrxRs), though set 3's Rattus restriction is unnecessarily
  narrow and should be expanded to broader Mammalia.

action: MODIFY
action_rationale: >-
  The rule is fundamentally sound with strong literature support. However, the
  third condition set (Rattus-specific) represents a pragmatic choice reflecting
  the preponderance of structural data from rat TrxR1, but is overly narrow for
  functional annotation purposes. Homologous TrxR enzymes in other mammalian
  species possess essentially identical catalytic properties and warrant identical
  annotation. Expansion to Mammalia would provide functional accuracy while
  maintaining species-level specificity where warranted.

suggested_modifications:
  - Expand condition set 3 taxonomic restriction from Rattus to Mammalia
  - Consider adding condition sets for plant thioredoxin reductases given their well-characterized role in chloroplast redox signaling
  - Document that TrxR3 (with glutaredoxin domain) will also match and appropriately receive GO:0004791 as one of its multiple activities

parsimony: ACCEPTABLE
parsimony_notes: >-
  The rule uses three condition sets where two might suffice. However, having
  both InterPro-based (set 1) and FunFam-based (set 2) approaches provides
  complementary coverage - proteins might match one classification system but
  not the other. The third set (Rattus) is questionable.

literature_support: STRONG
literature_notes: >-
  Extensive structural and mechanistic literature supports this annotation rule.
  X-ray crystallography of rat TrxR at 3.0 Angstrom resolution confirms the spatial
  arrangement of catalytically essential residues. The FAD binding domain (residues
  1-163, 297-367), NADPH binding domain (residues 164-296), and interface domain
  (residues 368-499) with the C-terminal selenocysteine redox center are all
  structurally characterized. Mammalian TrxRs require selenocysteine for efficient
  catalysis - cysteine substitution reduces activity to ~1% of wild-type. The
  class-II active site signature distinguishes these from prokaryotic (class-I)
  TrxRs which lack selenocysteine and use a different domain rotation mechanism.

condition_overlap: MINOR
overlap_notes: >-
  In condition set 1, IPR005982 (Thioredoxin reductase) and IPR008255
  (class-II oxidoreductase active site) have some biological overlap as the
  active site is part of the enzyme, but they represent distinct signatures -
  one for the overall family and one for a specific catalytic motif. This is
  appropriate redundancy for increased specificity. IPR023753 (FAD/NAD(P)-binding)
  is a broader domain that helps distinguish NADPH-utilizing members.

go_specificity: APPROPRIATE
specificity_notes: >-
  GO:0004791 is at the correct level of specificity. It captures the precise
  enzymatic function (NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reduction) without overgeneralizing
  to broader terms like GO:0016651 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H).
  While mammalian TrxRs can also reduce selenite, lipid hydroperoxides, and H2O2,
  thioredoxin remains the primary physiological substrate, making GO:0004791
  appropriate. The explicit NADPH specification is correct as mammalian TrxRs
  specifically utilize NADPH (not NADH) as electron donor. A selenoprotein-specific
  term would be too narrow as it would exclude functional variants like the
  nematode mitochondrial TrxR that lacks selenocysteine but retains full activity.

taxonomic_scope: APPROPRIATE
taxonomic_notes: >-
  Set 1 (InterPro-based) has no taxonomic restriction, appropriate as TrxR is found
  across all domains of life. Set 2's eukaryotic restriction is justified by the
  fundamental structural and mechanistic differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic
  TrxRs: prokaryotic enzymes lack selenocysteine, have ~35 kDa homodimeric structure,
  use a 66-degree domain rotation mechanism, and have narrower substrate specificity.
  Eukaryotic TrxRs have evolved a different spatial arrangement allowing direct
  electron transfer without domain rotation. Set 3's Rattus restriction reflects
  the research model but should be expanded to Mammalia as TrxR1 function is
  conserved across mammals.
