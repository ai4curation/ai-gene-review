description: >-
  A massive rule with 1094 condition sets that attempts to annotate the entire
  transferase enzyme class (EC 2) using GO:0016740 (transferase activity). 
  The rule encompasses diverse transferase families including glycosyltransferases,
  acetyltransferases, protein kinases, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and others,
  but also erroneously includes non-transferase domains like PAS signaling domains.

review_summary: >-
  ARBA00027723 represents a fundamentally flawed approach to transferase annotation
  that attempts to capture the entire EC 2 enzyme class in a single rule. With 
  1094 condition sets spanning 406 InterPro domains and 73 PANTHER families, this
  rule is impossibly complex and unmaintainable. Critical analysis reveals the
  inclusion of non-transferase domains (IPR000014 PAS domain) alongside legitimate
  but highly diverse transferase families. The use of GO:0016740 "transferase activity"
  as the target annotation loses essential functional specificity, conflating enzymes
  with vastly different biological roles - from metabolic glycosyltransferases to
  regulatory protein kinases to protein degradation enzymes. The rule violates basic
  annotation principles by trading specificity for comprehensiveness, resulting in
  annotations that provide minimal biological insight. The correct approach would
  be to replace this mega-rule with focused, family-specific rules that use 
  appropriate child GO terms and maintain biological coherence within manageable
  complexity limits.

action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: >-
  This rule exhibits multiple critical flaws that make it unsuitable for accurate
  protein annotation: (1) Excessive complexity with 1094 condition sets that 
  exceeds maintainability and validation limits by two orders of magnitude, 
  (2) Inappropriate inclusion of non-transferase domains (e.g., PAS signaling domains),
  (3) Overly broad GO term that loses functionally critical specificity needed
  for meaningful biological annotation, (4) Biological incoherence by conflating
  highly diverse enzyme families with different substrates, mechanisms, and 
  biological roles, and (5) Violation of annotation best practices by creating
  a "mega-rule" instead of focused, family-specific rules.

suggested_modifications:
- Remove this rule entirely and replace with focused, family-specific rules
- Create separate rules for major transferase classes using specific child GO terms
- Implement proper complexity limits to prevent creation of similar mega-rules
- Ensure all included domains are actually relevant to the target GO annotation

parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: >-
    The rule has 1094 condition sets, which is approximately 90x the recommended
    maximum of 12 condition sets. This creates an unmaintainable and unvalidatable
    rule that cannot be properly reviewed or maintained by curators. Analysis
    of the first few condition sets reveals a mix of legitimate transferase domains
    alongside inappropriate inclusions like PAS signaling domains.

literature_support:
  assessment: WEAK
  notes: >-
    While individual transferase families are well-characterized in the literature,
    there is no biological rationale for unifying all EC 2 transferases under a
    single broad annotation. The enzyme classification system specifically maintains
    detailed subclassification because substrate specificity and biological context
    are functionally critical. The inclusion of non-transferase domains contradicts
    established biochemical knowledge.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: COMPLETE
  notes: >-
    With 1094 condition sets attempting to cover all transferases, there is
    guaranteed to be extensive redundancy and complete functional overlap
    between many condition sets targeting the same protein families. The scale
    makes meaningful overlap analysis impossible.

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: >-
    GO:0016740 "transferase activity" is a high-level molecular function term
    that provides minimal biological insight. More specific child terms exist
    for all major transferase subclasses and should be used instead. This term
    is appropriate only when the specific transfer reaction cannot be determined.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: >-
    The rule lacks taxonomic restrictions and would apply to all domains of life,
    but many of the included enzyme families have lineage-specific distributions
    and functions that would be better served by targeted rules.
