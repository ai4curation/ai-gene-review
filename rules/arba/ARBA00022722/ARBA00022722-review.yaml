description: Highly problematic rule with 532 condition sets using 371 unique InterPro domains to assign only a vague "Nuclease" keyword annotation with no GO terms. This represents severe over-engineering and over-annotation of nuclease function.

  This rule should be REMOVED for multiple critical reasons:

  1. EXTREME COMPLEXITY: 532 condition sets is 44 times beyond the recommended limit of 12, making the rule unmaintainable and prone to errors.

  2. DOMAIN PROMISCUITY: Using 371 unique InterPro domains creates massive false positive risk, as many of these domains appear in non-nuclease proteins.

  3. LACK OF SPECIFICITY: Only assigns a vague "Nuclease" keyword with no GO annotations, providing no meaningful functional information.

  4. OVER-ANNOTATION: The keyword "Nuclease" is too broad and captures diverse enzymatic activities (endonucleases, exonucleases, ribonucleases, etc.) that should be annotated with specific GO molecular function terms.

  5. REDUNDANCY WITH EXISTING CURATION: Many of the constituent InterPro domains likely already have appropriate GO annotations through InterPro2GO mappings.

  The rule attempts to be comprehensive but ends up being counterproductive, likely creating more annotation noise than value.

review_summary: |
  ARBA00022722 is a severely over-engineered rule that exemplifies the worst practices in automated annotation. The rule uses 532 condition sets incorporating 371 unique InterPro domains to assign only a vague "Nuclease" keyword, with no GO annotations whatsoever.

  This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how annotation rules should work. Rather than creating hundreds of domain combinations, a proper approach would be to:
  1. Identify core nuclease domains with specific functions
  2. Assign appropriate GO molecular function terms (e.g., GO:0004518 nuclease activity, GO:0004519 endonuclease activity, GO:0004527 exonuclease activity)
  3. Use taxonomic restrictions where appropriate
  4. Limit condition sets to a manageable number (<12)

  The current rule is so broad and vague that it likely annotates many non-nuclease proteins while providing no useful functional information for those it correctly identifies.

confidence: 0.95

# Assessment sections
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  supporting_text: Rule contains 532 condition sets using 371 unique InterPro domains, which is 44 times beyond the recommended limit. This extreme complexity makes the rule unmaintainable and error-prone.
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00022722/ARBA00022722.json
    supporting_text: '"conditionSets": [...] with 532 total condition sets identified through JSON parsing'

literature_support:
  assessment: WEAK
  supporting_text: While nucleases are well-characterized enzymes, this rule's approach of using hundreds of domain combinations to assign only a keyword lacks literature support for such broad, non-specific annotation.
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00022722/ARBA00022722-deep-research-perplexity.md
    supporting_text: "TODO - placeholder for literature analysis"

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  supporting_text: With 371 unique InterPro domains across 532 condition sets, there is likely massive redundancy and overlap. The rule was too complex to perform quantitative overlap analysis.
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00022722/ARBA00022722-analysis-notes.md
    supporting_text: "Analysis skipped due to 532 condition sets exceeding maximum of 12 for overlap analysis"

go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  supporting_text: The rule assigns no GO annotations, only a vague "Nuclease" keyword. Proper annotation should use specific GO molecular function terms like GO:0004518 (nuclease activity), GO:0004519 (endonuclease activity), or GO:0004527 (exonuclease activity).

  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00022722/ARBA00022722.json
    supporting_text: 'Rule annotations section contains only keyword: "KW-0540", "name": "Nuclease" with no GO terms'

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: MISSING
  supporting_text: Rule appears to have no taxonomic restrictions despite using 371 InterPro domains that likely span diverse functional contexts across different organisms.

  - reference_id: file:rules/arba/ARBA00022722/ARBA00022722.json

# Analysis notes
analysis_notes: |
  - Rule complexity analysis failed due to exceeding maximum analyzable condition sets (532 > 12)
  - Manual inspection reveals 371 unique InterPro domains across 532 condition sets
  - Only keyword annotation provided, no GO terms
  - Represents worst-case scenario for ARBA rule over-engineering
  - Should serve as example of what NOT to do in automated annotation rule design

critical_findings:
- "Extreme complexity: 532 condition sets (44x over recommended limit)"
- "Domain promiscuity: 371 unique InterPro domains creates false positive risk"
- "No GO annotations: Only provides vague keyword with no functional specificity"
- "Likely high false positive rate due to overly broad domain matching"
- "Rule is unmaintainable and should be completely redesigned or removed"

recommendations:
- "REMOVE this rule entirely"
- "Replace with 5-10 focused rules targeting specific nuclease subfamilies"
- "Use appropriate GO molecular function terms instead of keywords"
- "Implement taxonomic restrictions where functional context varies"
- "Limit each replacement rule to <12 condition sets with core domains only"
