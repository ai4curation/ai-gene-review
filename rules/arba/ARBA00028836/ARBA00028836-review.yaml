review_summary: >-
  This rule attempts to capture diverse amide-forming enzymes using 61 condition sets
  spanning ceramide synthases, glutathione biosynthesis enzymes, pantothenate/CoA pathway
  components, biotin biosynthesis enzymes, nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and others.
  Approximately 60-70% of condition sets correctly identify genuine amide-forming enzymes
  with strong literature support (ceramide synthases, glutathione synthetase/GCL, pantothenate
  synthetase, CoA biosynthesis ligases, NRPS systems). However, 30-40% of condition sets
  capture proteins with no amide-forming function: ceramidase (amide hydrolase—catabolic),
  sialyltransferases and galactosyltransferases (glycosidic bond formation), sphingomyelin
  phosphodiesterase (phosphodiester hydrolysis), ATP-citrate lyase (citrate cleavage to
  acetyl-CoA thioester), argininosuccinate lyase (elimination reaction), 2-oxoglutarate
  oxidoreductases (oxidative decarboxylation), and various other hydrolases. The GO term
  GO:0043604 is overly broad—more specific pathway terms exist (ceramide biosynthetic
  process, glutathione biosynthetic process, CoA biosynthetic process). Current structure
  creates false positives and obscures biological precision.

action: MODIFY
action_rationale: >-
  The rule requires significant restructuring to remove false positives and improve
  annotation precision. Critical issues: (1) Inclusion of catabolic enzymes (ceramidase
  hydrolyzes amides rather than synthesizing them), (2) Inclusion of glycosyltransferases
  that form glycosidic bonds not amide bonds, (3) Inclusion of oxidoreductases and other
  central metabolic enzymes with no amide-forming chemistry, (4) Use of overly general
  GO term when pathway-specific child terms exist. The rule should be split into pathway-
  specific sub-rules (ceramide biosynthesis, glutathione biosynthesis, CoA biosynthesis,
  etc.) with appropriate GO term granularity, and all non-amide-forming condition sets
  removed. In current form, estimated 30-40% false positive rate undermines annotation
  quality.

suggested_modifications:
  - Remove Condition Set 25 (N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase/ceramidase—catabolic amide hydrolysis)
  - Remove Condition Sets 34, 48, 53 (sialyltransferases, galactosyltransferases—glycosidic bond formation)
  - Remove Condition Set 54 (ceramide glucosyltransferase—glycosidic bond formation)
  - Remove Condition Set 30 (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase—phosphodiester hydrolysis)
  - Remove Condition Set 26 (fatty acid 2-hydroxylase—oxidation not amidation)
  - Remove Condition Sets 36, 42 (ATP-citrate lyase—citrate cleavage to acetyl-CoA thioester)
  - Remove Condition Set 37 (argininosuccinate lyase—urea cycle elimination)
  - Remove Condition Sets 12, 13 (2-oxoglutarate oxidoreductases—oxidative decarboxylation)
  - Remove Condition Set 45 (patatin phospholipase—hydrolysis)
  - Remove Condition Set 55 (nudix hydrolase—hydrolysis)
  - Remove Condition Set 16 (biotin synthase—sulfur insertion not amide formation)
  - Reconsider Condition Sets 22, 41, 43, 61 (adenylation domains/FAALs participate in amide pathways but do not directly catalyze amide formation)
  - Split remaining valid sets into pathway-specific rules with granular GO terms
  - For ceramide synthesis (Sets 1, 10)—use GO:0046513 (ceramide biosynthetic process)
  - For glutathione synthesis (Sets 3, 11, 18, 32, 57)—use GO:0006751 (glutathione biosynthetic process)
  - For pantothenate/CoA synthesis (Sets 5, 8, 28, 31, 33, 58-60)—use GO:0015937 (coenzyme A biosynthetic process) or GO:0015940 (pantothenate biosynthetic process)
  - For biotin synthesis (Set 4, 49)—use GO:0009102 (biotin biosynthetic process)
  - For NRPS systems (Set 22)—use GO:0043043 (peptide biosynthetic process)
  - Resolve taxonomic redundancy (e.g., Sets 31 and 33 both target pantothenate synthetase)

parsimony:
  assessment: POOR
  notes: >-
    The rule contains substantial redundancy and heterogeneity. Multiple condition sets
    target the same enzyme families (glutathione synthetase in Sets 32 and 57; pantothenate
    synthetase in Sets 31 and 33; ceramide synthase in Sets 1 and 10) using different
    domain/family signatures without clear justification. More critically, the rule mixes
    enzymes with fundamentally different chemistries (amide synthesis vs glycosyl transfer
    vs phosphodiester hydrolysis vs oxidative decarboxylation) under a single broad GO
    term. A parsimonious design would separate mechanistically distinct pathways into
    dedicated sub-rules with pathway-specific GO annotations. The current 61-condition-set
    OR logic creates unnecessary complexity and annotation ambiguity.

      supporting_text: >-
        The rule comprises 61 condition sets combined with OR logic, meaning that any
        protein matching ANY single condition set receives the amide biosynthetic process
        annotation. This creates several potential issues

literature_support:
  assessment: MIXED
  notes: >-
    Strong experimental support exists for core amide-forming enzymes. Ceramide synthases:
    Recent cryo-EM structures of yeast CerS bound to C26-CoA demonstrate His211-mediated
    nucleophilic catalysis forming N-acylated sphingosine—canonical amide bond formation.
    Glutathione biosynthesis: Crystal structures of GCL show unique gamma-glutamyl amide
    bond formation mechanism; essential role in antioxidant defense; GCL-knockout mice
    are embryonic lethal. Pantothenate/CoA biosynthesis: Pantothenate synthetase structures
    confirm adenylate-mediated amide formation between D-pantoate and beta-alanine; CoA
    pathway is universally conserved. Nonribosomal peptide synthetases: 2024 review
    consolidates structural/biochemical evidence for A-domain aminoacyl-AMP generation
    and C-domain peptide bond formation. However, for proteins without amide-forming
    chemistry, literature directly contradicts the annotation. Ceramidase is described
    as amide hydrolase with primary function in ceramide degradation during apoptosis
    and lipid remodeling—assigning amide biosynthetic annotation contradicts established
    literature. Sialyltransferases catalyze glycosidic bond formation not amide synthesis.
    ATP-citrate lyase generates acetyl-CoA (thioester) not amides. Mixed-fidelity rule.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: HIGH_REDUNDANCY
  notes: >-
    Significant redundancy exists across condition sets targeting the same enzyme families.
    Glutathione synthetase appears in Sets 32 (CATH.FunFam:3.40.50.1760:FF:000001) and
    57 (CATH.FunFam:3.30.1490.50:FF:000002) using different FunFam identifiers. Pantothenate
    synthetase appears in Sets 31 (CATH.FunFam:3.30.1300.10:FF:000001) and 33
    (CATH.FunFam:3.40.50.620:FF:000013), one unrestricted and one potentially taxon-specific
    but without clear documentation. Ceramide synthase appears in Set 1 (Chordata-restricted
    via InterPro domains) and Set 10 (Metazoa-restricted via FunFam), suggesting either
    deliberate targeting of different CerS subfamilies or incomplete rule rationalization.
    For universally conserved pathways (glutathione, CoA biosynthesis), multiple condition
    sets with different domain/family combinations may capture ortholog diversity but
    create annotation redundancy. Conversely, some condition sets capture functionally
    unrelated proteins (glycosyltransferases, hydrolases, oxidoreductases) that should
    be entirely excluded.

        Glutathione biosynthesis: Sets 3, 11, 18, 32, 57 all target glutathione
        biosynthetic enzymes. The existence of five separate condition sets for a pathway
        with only two essential enzymes (GCL and GS) suggests either partial redundancy
        or targeting of specific subfamilies

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: >-
    GO:0043604 (amide biosynthetic process) is defined as "the chemical reactions and
    pathways resulting in the formation of an amide, any derivative of an oxoacid in
    which at least one half of the acid group is replaced by an amine group." This
    extremely broad definition encompasses any pathway generating amide functional groups
    (C=O-N bonds). While technically correct for enzymes that do form amide bonds, the
    term obscures critical biological distinctions. Ceramide biosynthesis, glutathione
    biosynthesis, CoA biosynthesis, biotin biosynthesis, and peptide biosynthesis all
    involve amide chemistry but serve entirely different physiological roles with distinct
    regulation, subcellular localization, and evolutionary origins. More specific GO
    terms exist and would provide superior functional annotation: GO:0046513 (ceramide
    biosynthetic process), GO:0006751 (glutathione biosynthetic process), GO:0015937
    (coenzyme A biosynthetic process), GO:0009102 (biotin biosynthetic process),
    GO:0043043 (peptide biosynthetic process). Using the general amide term creates
    annotation ambiguity—a user querying "amide biosynthesis" would retrieve ceramide
    synthases, glutathione synthetases, and peptide synthetases together, which is
    biologically unhelpful. More critically, the broad term fails to distinguish between
    biosynthetic and catabolic processes—ceramidase (Set 25) hydrolyzes amides yet
    receives a biosynthetic annotation.

      supporting_text: >-
        The term is problematically broad for several reasons including inclusion of
        catabolic processes, inclusion of component enzymes rather than pathway-specific
        enzymes, and lack of specificity regarding primary versus secondary function

      supporting_text: >-
        More specific and semantically appropriate GO terms exist for many of these
        pathways and would provide superior functional annotations

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: INCONSISTENT
  notes: >-
    Taxonomic restrictions are applied inconsistently across condition sets without clear
    biological rationale. Some universally conserved pathways have taxon restrictions
    (e.g., pantothenate synthetase in Set 28 restricted to Glires despite CoA biosynthesis
    being universal), while other pathway-specific enzymes lack restrictions (e.g.,
    ceramide synthase Set 10 restricted to Metazoa, but Set 1 restricted only to Chordata,
    creating overlap). Glutathione biosynthesis is conserved across bacteria and eukaryotes
    yet some condition sets (Set 11) restrict to Eukaryota. Most problematic are condition
    sets with inappropriate taxonomic scope for the predicted function. For example,
    2-oxoglutarate oxidoreductases in Sets 12-13 are restricted to Archaea/Thermoproteota,
    which is appropriate for those enzymes, but these enzymes do not form amide bonds—
    the taxonomic restriction does not rescue the functional mis-annotation. Similarly,
    ATP-citrate lyase in Set 42 is restricted to Embryophyta, but this enzyme cleaves
    citrate to acetyl-CoA (thioester) not amides—taxonomic restriction is irrelevant
    to the annotation error. For genuinely amide-forming pathways, taxonomic restrictions
    should reflect evolutionary distribution: ceramide synthesis (eukaryotic), glutathione
    biosynthesis (universal), pantothenate/CoA biosynthesis (universal), NRPS (primarily
    bacterial/fungal).

        Several condition sets include specific taxonomic constraints, suggesting that
