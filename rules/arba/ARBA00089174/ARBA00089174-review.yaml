        PM20D1 is a secreted enzyme that synthesizes and hydrolyzes N-fatty-acyl
        amino acids (NAAs). NAAs can act as mitochondrial uncouplers, promoting
        UCP1-independent thermogenesis. The Eukaryota scope is overly broad since
        adaptive thermogenesis is primarily a mammalian physiological trait.

        TRPV1 is a heat/capsaicin-gated cation channel. In mice, TRPV1 activation
        triggers the SIRT1→PRDM16→UCP1 pathway in adipose tissue, enhancing
        thermogenic programming. The Mus restriction is appropriate given that
        evidence is primarily from murine models.

review_summary: >-
  This rule captures two mechanistically distinct pathways to adaptive thermogenesis:
  (1) PM20D1 functions as a bidirectional synthase/hydrolase regulating N-acyl amino
  acids (NAAs) that act as mitochondrial uncouplers for UCP1-independent thermogenesis,
  and (2) TRPV1 acts as a thermosensory and metabolic signaling node that activates
  thermogenic gene programs via Ca2+→CaMKII/AMPK→SIRT1→PRDM16→UCP1 pathway. Critically,
  PM20D1 is a direct thermogenic executor while TRPV1 is a thermogenic regulator—
  TRPV1's primary functions are nociception and temperature sensation, with thermogenesis
  being a secondary role. PM20D1 operates cooperatively with FAAH in NAA homeostasis.
  Both mechanisms are supported by murine studies, with PM20D1 human genetic associations.
  Two modifications recommended: (a) restrict PM20D1's Eukaryota scope to Mammalia,
  (b) consider GO:1990847 (positive regulation of adaptive thermogenesis) for precision.
  The TRPV1 Mus restriction may be overly conservative—evidence exists in rats and
  other mammals.

action: MODIFY
action_rationale: >-
  The rule is biologically plausible but requires two modifications. First, the
  PM20D1 condition set's Eukaryota scope should be restricted to Mammalia (or at
  most Vertebrata) since adaptive thermogenesis is a mammalian physiological program.
  Propagating this annotation to plants, fungi, or invertebrates would create false
  positives. Second, the GO term GO:1990845 (adaptive thermogenesis) describes an
  organism-level process; both PM20D1 and TRPV1 are regulatory proteins that modulate
  thermogenesis rather than directly executing it. A more precise annotation would
  be "positive regulation of adaptive thermogenesis" (GO:1990847) for both proteins.

suggested_modifications:
  - Restrict PM20D1 condition set from Eukaryota to Mammalia
  - Consider changing GO term from GO:1990845 to GO:1990847 (positive regulation of adaptive thermogenesis)
  - For TRPV1, consider extending Mus restriction to Mammalia if corroborating mammalian evidence is curated
  - Add evidence qualifiers noting UCP1-independent mechanism for PM20D1 and PRDM16/UCP1-dependent mechanism for TRPV1

parsimony:
  assessment: ACCEPTABLE
  notes: >-
    The rule uses two condition sets capturing mechanistically distinct pathways
    to thermogenesis. PM20D1 operates via NAA-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling
    (UCP1-independent), while TRPV1 operates via the SIRT1→PRDM16→UCP1 axis
    (UCP1-dependent). Both condition sets are non-redundant and capture different
    proteins with different mechanisms converging on the same physiological outcome.

literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: >-
    Both pathways have strong experimental support from multiple complementary approaches.
    PM20D1: AAV-mediated overexpression increases circulating NAAs and energy expenditure;
    genetic knockout causes dysregulated glucose homeostasis; bidirectional manipulation
    proves causal role. PM20D1 expression is cold-inducible and UCP1-knockout mice retain
    PM20D1-dependent thermogenesis, demonstrating independence. Natural promoter variants
    in BALB/c vs C57BL/6 mice explain strain-specific cold tolerance differences. Human
    PM20D1 variants associate with BMI and metabolic syndrome. PM20D1 operates cooperatively
    with FAAH in a two-enzyme NAA regulatory system. TRPV1: activation induces UCP1/PGC1α
    expression in adipocytes; fish oil activates adipocyte TRPV1 inducing thermogenic genes;
    TRPV1 knockout mice show hyperthermia and impaired thermoregulation; hypothalamic TRPV1
    coordinates behavioral thermoregulation. Clinical trials show TRPV1 antagonists cause
    hyperthermia, providing human evidence. However, most TRPV1 literature focuses on
    nociception—thermogenesis is a secondary but genuine functional role.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: NONE
  notes: >-
    The two condition sets capture entirely different protein families with distinct
    mechanisms and functional roles. PM20D1 is a secreted M20 peptidase family enzyme
    that functions as a direct thermogenic executor—it synthesizes NAAs that directly
    cause mitochondrial uncoupling and heat production. TRPV1 is a TRP family ion channel
    that functions as a thermogenic regulator/signaling node—it detects thermal and
    metabolic stimuli and activates downstream thermogenic effectors including UCP1.
    This executor vs regulator distinction has implications for annotation granularity.
    No biological or sequence overlap exists between these condition sets, though
    emerging evidence suggests PM20D1-synthesized NAAs may function as endogenous
    TRPV1 ligands, establishing a functional connection between the two pathways.

        PM20D1 functions as a direct thermogenic executor—the enzyme synthesizes and
        regulates metabolites that directly increase heat production through mitochondrial
        uncoupling

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: >-
    GO:1990845 (adaptive thermogenesis) describes the organism-level physiological
    process. The term is appropriate for PM20D1 which directly executes thermogenesis
    via NAA-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling—however GO:1990847 (positive regulation
    of adaptive thermogenesis) might still be preferred for precision. For TRPV1, the
    term is somewhat broad because TRPV1 functions primarily as a thermosensory and
    signaling node rather than a direct thermogenic executor. TRPV1's primary annotated
    functions emphasize nociception and temperature sensation, with metabolic effects
    as secondary consequences. More specific alternatives for TRPV1 include GO:0009409
    (response to cold), GO:0019233 (sensory perception of temperature), or GO:0055080
    (cellular response to heat). Additionally, PM20D1 could receive GO:0008610 (lipid
    biosynthetic process) for NAA synthesis, and TRPV1 could receive cation channel
    activity annotations. The distinction between detecting/signaling about thermogenic
    need (TRPV1) versus directly executing thermogenesis (PM20D1) would be better
    captured through appropriately specific GO terms.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: >-
    The PM20D1 condition set's Eukaryota (NCBITaxon:2759) scope is clearly too broad.
    Adaptive thermogenesis is a mammalian physiological trait requiring brown/beige
    adipose tissue and sympathetic nervous system coordination—structures absent in
    plants, fungi, and invertebrates. PM20D1 orthologs in non-mammalian eukaryotes
    may serve alternative metabolic functions unrelated to thermogenesis. The scope
    should be restricted to Mammalia, or conservatively to placental mammals (Eutheria).
    For TRPV1, the Mus restriction may be overly conservative. Experimental evidence
    for TRPV1-thermogenesis connections exists in rats and other rodent species, and
    human clinical trials with TRPV1 antagonists show hyperthermia (though this reflects
    impaired heat loss rather than defective heat production). Consider expanding to
    Rodentia or Mammalia with evidence review. TRPV1 orthologs exist in birds and
    reptiles but physiological context differs substantially and dedicated thermogenesis
    evidence is lacking, so expansion beyond mammals should be cautious.
