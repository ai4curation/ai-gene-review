review_summary: 'This ARBA rule provides a highly specific functional annotation for MORN3 proteins based on experimentally characterized human and mouse orthologs. While the molecular mechanism described (p53 regulation via SIRT1/MDM2 tethering) is well-supported for MORN3, applying this specific function broadly to 1802 unreviewed proteins raises concerns about over-annotation. The rule would benefit from additional constraints or a more conservative taxonomic scope given the limited experimental evidence across diverse species.'
action: MODIFY
action_rationale: 'The core biological function is accurate for MORN3 proteins, but the annotation is too specific to apply broadly to all proteins matching these domain patterns. The function description assumes conservation of the specific p53/SIRT1/MDM2 regulatory mechanism across all eukaryotes, which may not be warranted. Recommend either: (1) restricting taxonomic scope to mammals/vertebrates where p53 regulation is well-established, or (2) generalizing the function description to focus on the broader MORN repeat-mediated protein complex assembly role rather than the specific p53 pathway.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Restrict taxonomic scope to Mammalia (NCBITaxon:40674) or Vertebrata (NCBITaxon:7742) where p53 regulation pathways are well-conserved'
- 'OR generalize function description to: "May function in protein complex assembly through MORN repeat domains, potentially involved in regulatory processes"'
- 'Add taxonomic qualifiers like "in mammals" to the specific p53/SIRT1/MDM2 mechanism description'
parsimony:
  assessment: ACCEPTABLE
  notes: 'The two condition sets provide complementary approaches to identifying MORN3 proteins - one using InterPro domains + PANTHER subfamily, the other using CATH FunFam with taxonomic restriction. Some redundancy exists but may capture different annotation perspectives.'
literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE
  notes: 'The specific p53 regulation mechanism is well-documented for human and mouse MORN3, but evidence for conservation across all eukaryotes is limited. InterPro entry IPR052472 cites key papers establishing the SIRT1/MDM2 tethering mechanism.'
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: 'InterPro:IPR052472'
    supporting_text: 'Human MORN3 is involved in the regulation of the tumor suppressor p53/TP53 through the assembly of a Morn3-mediated protein complex (referred to as suppresome). MORN3 functions by tethering the enzymes SIRT1 and MDM2 to p53/TP53, leading to its deacetylation-mediated functional inactivation and ubiquitination-dependent degradation [PUB00163406].'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: MINOR
  notes: 'Both condition sets should identify the same MORN3 protein family, but use different domain classification systems (InterPro vs CATH). The overlap is expected and appropriate for robust identification.'
  supported_by: []
go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: 'This rule provides FUNCTION annotation rather than GO terms, which is appropriate given the highly specific molecular mechanism described. If GO terms were to be added, they would need to be carefully chosen to avoid over-annotation.'
  supported_by: []
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'Restricting to Eukaryota is too broad given that the specific p53/SIRT1/MDM2 regulatory mechanism is primarily characterized in mammals. Many eukaryotes may lack these pathway components or have different regulatory mechanisms.'

  - reference_id: 'InterPro:IPR052472'
