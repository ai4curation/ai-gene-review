description: 'A mega-rule with 298 condition sets attempting to annotate all E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases with EC 2.3.2.27 (ubiquitin-protein transferase activity) across bacteria, plants, animals, and viruses. The rule covers vastly different catalytic mechanisms (RING, HECT, U-box), domain architectures, and protein families.'

review_summary: 'ARBA00000900 is an overly ambitious mega-rule with 298 condition sets that attempts to capture all E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases across all domains of life. While the biological basis is sound (all targets share ubiquitin-protein transferase activity), the rule violates parsimony principles and creates unacceptable maintenance complexity. The rule spans vastly different catalytic mechanisms (RING, HECT, U-box), taxonomic groups (bacteria to mammals), and domain architectures. This breadth creates high false positive risk and makes human review practically impossible. The rule should be decomposed into focused, mechanism-specific and family-specific rules.'
action: REMOVE
action_rationale: 'This mega-rule with 298 condition sets is fundamentally flawed in design. The excessive complexity violates parsimony principles, creates unmanageable maintenance burden, and increases false positive annotation risk. The rule attempts to unify mechanistically and evolutionarily distinct protein families under a single annotation framework, which is biologically inappropriate. A decomposition strategy with focused rules for specific E3 ligase families would be far more accurate and maintainable.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Replace with mechanism-specific rules: separate rules for RING-type, HECT-type, and U-box E3 ligases'
- 'Create family-specific rules for well-characterized E3 ligase families (MDM2, BRCA1, Cbl, etc.)'
- 'Implement taxonomic boundaries: separate rules for prokaryotic vs eukaryotic E3 ligases'
- 'Add appropriate GO term GO:0004842 to any replacement rules'
- 'Limit condition sets per rule to <20 for maintainability'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'With 298 condition sets, this rule exceeds any reasonable complexity threshold. The rule attempts to unify dozens of distinct protein families with different evolutionary origins, catalytic mechanisms, and cellular functions. This violates the fundamental principle that rules should target coherent, mechanistically related protein sets.'

    supporting_text: 'This rule contains 298 condition sets, making it one of the most complex rules in the UniProt system. This level of complexity makes manual review nearly impossible, increases risk of false positives, and suggests the rule may be trying to capture too many distinct protein families.'
literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE
  notes: 'While E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases are well-studied and the basic annotation (ubiquitin-protein transferase activity) is biochemically sound, the literature strongly supports family-specific rather than pan-family classification approaches due to the extraordinary diversity in mechanisms, substrates, and regulation.'

    supporting_text: 'E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases represent one of the most diverse and numerous enzyme families in eukaryotic proteomes, with over 600 E3 ligases identified in humans alone. The extraordinary diversity in domain architectures, substrate specificities, and regulatory mechanisms makes them poor candidates for a single mega-rule.'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'With 298 condition sets covering overlapping domain families and taxonomic groups, substantial redundancy is inevitable. Many InterPro domains (e.g., RING finger variants) appear across multiple condition sets with different combinations, creating complex overlap patterns that increase false positive risk.'

    supporting_text: 'The rule attempts to capture E3 ubiquitin ligases across multiple categories: RING-type ligases (various subtypes), U-box domain ligases, HECT-type ligases, Complex multidomain ligases, Bacterial E3 ligases, Plant-specific ligases, Viral ligases.'
go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: 'The inferred GO term GO:0004842 (ubiquitin-protein transferase activity) is appropriately specific for the molecular function shared by all E3 ligases. However, the rule currently only provides EC number 2.3.2.27 without the corresponding GO annotation, which should be added.'
  supported_by: []
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'The rule spans all domains of life (bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, viruses), which is problematic because prokaryotic and viral E3 ligases often have different mechanisms and evolutionary origins compared to eukaryotic systems. Cross-kingdom applications risk inappropriate annotations.'
