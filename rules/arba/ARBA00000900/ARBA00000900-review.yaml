description: "Extremely complex rule predicting ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (E3 ligase) across 206 condition sets covering multiple protein families and taxonomic groups"
action: MODIFY
action_rationale: |
  While the core biological function (E3 ubiquitin ligase activity) is correct, this rule suffers from
  extreme complexity that makes it impossible to validate and maintain properly. With 206 condition sets,
  146 InterPro domains, 35 PANTHER families, and 306 CATH FunFams, the rule attempts to capture the
  entire diversity of E3 ligases in a single rule. This creates several critical problems:
  
  1. EXTREME COMPLEXITY: 206 condition sets make validation and maintenance practically impossible
  2. MIXED MECHANISMS: Combines fundamentally different E3 ligase families (RING, HECT, RBR, CRL)
  3. TAXONOMIC OVER-REACH: Spans bacteria to primates without sufficient mechanistic justification
  4. FALSE POSITIVE RISK: Very broad domains may capture non-E3 proteins
  5. COMPUTATIONAL BURDEN: Extremely expensive to process and analyze
  
  Recommendation: Split into separate rules for major E3 ligase families (RING, HECT, CRL, etc.)
  with appropriate taxonomic restrictions and more specific domain combinations.

review_summary: |
  ARBA00000900 represents a well-intentioned but fundamentally flawed approach to annotating E3 ubiquitin
  ligases. The biological target is entirely appropriate - E3 ligases are critical enzymes that provide
  specificity to the ubiquitin-proteasome system and exist across all domains of life. However, the
  implementation suffers from extreme over-complexity that undermines its utility.
  
  The rule attempts to capture the vast diversity of E3 ligases in a single annotation rule, resulting
  in 206 condition sets that span multiple mechanistically distinct protein families. While this ensures
  high coverage, it creates an unmaintainable monster that is prone to false positives and impossible
  to validate systematically.
  
  E3 ligases fall into several major families (RING, HECT, RBR, CRL) with distinct structural and
  catalytic mechanisms. Each family has characteristic domains and often lineage-specific distributions.
  This diversity should be reflected in separate, more focused rules rather than one mega-rule.
  
  The presence of GO curator concerns in the issue tracker suggests this rule has already caused
  annotation quality problems. The sheer number of condition sets (206) and affected proteins (384,828)
  makes this rule a significant source of potential annotation errors.

parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  rationale: |
    With 206 condition sets, this rule far exceeds reasonable complexity bounds. Analysis shows:
    - 146 unique InterPro domains
    - 35 PANTHER family identifiers  
    - 306 CATH FunFam identifiers
    - Multiple overlapping taxonomic restrictions
    
    This level of complexity is antithetical to the parsimony principle and creates a maintenance
    nightmare. The rule would be much better served by decomposing into ~5-10 focused rules targeting
    specific E3 ligase families.

literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  rationale: |
    The core biological function (ubiquitin-protein ligase activity) has overwhelming literature support.
    E3 ligases are one of the most studied enzyme families in cell biology:
    - Central to protein degradation and cell cycle regulation
    - >1000 human E3 ligases identified
    - Multiple mechanistically distinct families (RING, HECT, RBR)
    - Critical for numerous cellular processes
    
    However, the specific domain combinations in this rule would require extensive validation
    to ensure they accurately identify E3 ligases versus other ubiquitin-related proteins.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  rationale: |
    With 487 unique domain/family identifiers across 206 condition sets, there is almost certainly
    significant overlap between conditions. Many InterPro domains are hierarchical (parent/child
    relationships) and CATH FunFams can overlap with InterPro entries. Without systematic pairwise
    analysis, the exact extent is unclear, but the sheer numbers suggest substantial redundancy.
    
    Some taxonomic conditions are clearly hierarchical (e.g., Primates ⊂ Euarchontoglires ⊂ Eutheria)
    which creates logical redundancy in protein matching.

      supporting_text: "487 different protein domains/families suggests this rule is too broad"

go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  rationale: |
    The GO term "ubiquitin-protein ligase activity" (GO:0061630, EC:2.3.2.27) accurately describes
    the molecular function of E3 ligases. This is not overly broad - it represents a specific
    enzymatic activity with a defined EC number and chemical reaction. The term appropriately
    distinguishes E3 ligases from E1 activating enzymes and E2 conjugating enzymes.
    
    The problem is not with the GO term choice, but with the overly broad rule conditions that
    may annotate non-E3 proteins with this specific activity.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD  
  rationale: |
    The rule spans an enormous taxonomic range from bacteria to primates, including:
    - Bacteria (Gammaproteobacteria)
    - Plants (Streptophyta, Embryophyta)  
    - Animals (Metazoa, Vertebrata)
    - Fungi (Ascomycota)
    - Viruses (Varidnaviria)
    
    While E3 ligases do exist across domains of life, specific families have more restricted
    distributions. The extremely broad scope increases false positive risk by applying
    eukaryotic-specific domain combinations to prokaryotes and vice versa.
    
    Many condition sets lack any taxonomic restriction, allowing annotation across all life.
