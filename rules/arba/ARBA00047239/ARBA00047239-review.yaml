description: 'Rule predicting positive regulation of telomere maintenance (GO:0032206)
  based on diverse protein families across multiple eukaryotic lineages. The rule
  spans nine condition sets targeting telomere-associated proteins including chaperonins,
  telomere-binding factors, ATM kinases, PARP proteins, T-complex proteins, helicases,
  MAP kinases, and SLX4 endonucleases. Taxonomic scope ranges from specific lineages
  (Primates, Homo, Mus) to broad kingdoms (Eukaryota, Metazoa, Mammalia, Haplorrhini).

status: COMPLETE
action: MODIFY
confidence: 0.65
parsimony:
  assessment: NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT
  rationale: 'Rule contains multiple significant redundancy issues:

    1. **Condition Set 3 - Complete Redundancy**: Two FunFams (1.10.1070.11:FF:000011
    and 3.30.1010.10:FF:000015) are 100% redundant (Jaccard=1.0), both representing
    "Serine-protein kinase ATM" with identical protein sets (n=3). One should be removed.

    2. **Condition Set 6 - Complete Redundancy**: Two FunFams (1.20.1160.20:FF:000006
    and 1.20.1160.20:FF:000009) are 100% redundant (Jaccard=1.0), both representing
    "Regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1" with identical protein sets (n=6).
    One should be removed.

    3. **Condition Set 2 - Subset Relationship**: FunFam 1.25.40.210:FF:000002 (n=3)
    is entirely contained within 1.10.10.60:FF:000129 (n=6, containment=1.0, Jaccard=0.5),
    both labeled "Telomeric repeat-binding factor 2". The subset FunFam adds no unique
    coverage.

    4. **Condition Set 4 - High Overlap**: FunFam 1.10.150.50:FF:000012 (n=4) is entirely
    contained within 1.25.40.20:FF:000009 (n=5, containment=1.0, Jaccard=0.8), both
    labeled "Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase". Near-complete redundancy.

    5. **Condition Set 6 - Subset Relationships**: Both 1.20.1160.20:FF:000006 and
    1.20.1160.20:FF:000009 (n=6 each) are entirely contained within 3.40.50.300:FF:000431
    (n=23, containment=1.0), all labeled "Regulator of telomere elongation helicase
    1".

    These redundancies violate parsimony principles and create unnecessary complexity
    without improving annotation coverage.

    '
literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE_TO_WEAK
  rationale: 'The GO term GO:0032206 (positive regulation of telomere maintenance)
    represents a complex regulatory function that is difficult to predict solely from
    domain/family presence. Key concerns:

    **Low Coverage**: Most domains show very low overlap with the target GO term.
    For example: - IPR002194 (Chaperonin TCP-1): only 34/155 proteins (22%) have GO:0032206
    - IPR054827 (Thermosome subunit alpha): only 24/108 proteins (22%) have GO:0032206
    - Most FunFams show <50% coverage of the GO term

    **Functional Heterogeneity**: The rule combines extremely diverse protein families:
    - Chaperonins (protein folding) - Telomere-binding factors (direct telomere binding)
    - ATM kinases (DNA damage response) - PARP proteins (DNA repair) - T-complex proteins
    (cytoskeletal chaperones) - Helicases (DNA unwinding) - MAP kinases (signal transduction)
    - SLX4 endonucleases (DNA structure resolution)

    While many of these proteins can influence telomere maintenance, predicting "positive
    regulation" specifically requires context beyond domain presence. The rule appears
    to cast an overly broad net, potentially creating false positives.

    **Novel Annotation**: GO:0032206 is not in InterPro2GO mappings, indicating this
    is a more specific functional inference than typically made from domain presence
    alone.

    '
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: INCONSISTENT
  rationale: 'Taxonomic targeting shows concerning inconsistencies:

    **Appropriate Broad Scope**: - Condition Set 3: Eukaryota (appropriate for conserved
    ATM kinases) - Condition Set 9: Metazoa (appropriate for SLX4 endonucleases)

    **Questionable Narrow Scope**: - Condition Set 7: Restricted to genus *Homo* for
    MAP kinase (1.10.510.10:FF:000624) - this seems overly restrictive for a conserved
    signaling pathway - Condition Set 8: Restricted to genus *Mus* for RuvB-like helicase
    (1.10.8.60:FF:000010) - also seems unnecessarily narrow - Condition Set 5: Haplorrhini
    (simians) for T-complex proteins - unclear biological rationale

    **Overlapping Primate Restrictions**: - Condition Set 1: Primates (for chaperonins)
    - Condition Set 4: Primates (for PARP proteins) - Why are these restricted to
    primates when other similar proteins get broader taxonomic targeting?

    The rule lacks a coherent taxonomic strategy, suggesting it may be capturing annotation
    artifacts rather than genuine lineage-specific biology.

proposed_improvements:
- action: REMOVE
  target: condition_set_3_funfam_redundant
  rationale: Remove either 1.10.1070.11:FF:000011 or 3.30.1010.10:FF:000015 from Condition
    Set 3 (100% redundant, Jaccard=1.0)
- action: REMOVE
  target: condition_set_6_funfam_redundant
  rationale: Remove either 1.20.1160.20:FF:000006 or 1.20.1160.20:FF:000009 from Condition
    Set 6 (100% redundant, Jaccard=1.0)
- action: REMOVE
  target: condition_set_2_subset_funfam
  rationale: Remove 1.25.40.210:FF:000002 from Condition Set 2 (entirely contained
    within 1.10.10.60:FF:000129)
- action: REMOVE
  target: condition_set_4_subset_funfam
  rationale: Remove 1.10.150.50:FF:000012 from Condition Set 4 (entirely contained
    within 1.25.40.20:FF:000009)
- action: REVIEW_EVIDENCE
  target: go_term_specificity
  rationale: 'The GO term "positive regulation of telomere maintenance" (GO:0032206)
    is highly specific and regulatory. Domain presence alone may be insufficient evidence.
    Consider: 1) Using a more general term like "telomere maintenance" (GO:0000723)
    or "telomere organization" (GO:0032200) 2) Adding evidence qualifiers to reflect
    computational inference 3) Splitting the rule into separate rules for functionally
    distinct protein families'
- action: JUSTIFY_TAXONOMIC_SCOPE
  target: narrow_genus_restrictions
  rationale: Justify or remove genus-level restrictions for Condition Sets 7 (Homo)
    and 8 (Mus). If these restrictions are based on annotation availability rather
    than biology, consider broadening scope.
- action: REVIEW_FUNCTIONAL_COHERENCE
  target: diverse_protein_families
  rationale: 'The rule combines proteins with very different primary functions (chaperones,
    kinases, helicases, endonucleases). Consider splitting into multiple focused rules:
    - Direct telomere-binding proteins (telomere-binding factors, helicases) - DNA
    damage response proteins (ATM, PARP, SLX4) - Indirect regulators (chaperones,
    MAP kinases)'
overall_recommendation: 'MODIFY before acceptance. The rule attempts to capture a
  diverse set of proteins involved in telomere maintenance regulation, but suffers
  from: 1) **Redundancy**: Four instances of redundant/subset FunFams that should
  be removed 2) **Low Precision**: Most constituent FunFams show <50% overlap with
  the target GO term, suggesting high false positive rates 3) **Functional Over-breadth**:
  Combining proteins with very different primary functions may create spurious annotations
  4) **Inconsistent Taxonomic Strategy**: Mix of genus-specific and kingdom-wide targeting
  without clear biological rationale

  The core biological concept (proteins influencing telomere maintenance) is valid,
  but the implementation requires significant refinement. After removing redundant
  FunFams, consider using a less specific GO term or splitting into multiple focused
  rules.
