description: Massive mega-rule attempting to predict methyltransferase function based
  on 604 condition sets covering diverse InterPro domains, PANTHER families, and
  CATH FunFams across multiple taxonomic groups. This rule only provides keyword
  annotation (KW-0489 Methyltransferase) without any GO term predictions.

review_summary: "This rule represents a fundamentally flawed approach to automated
  annotation. With 604 condition sets affecting 1.58 million proteins, it exhibits
  extreme complexity that violates basic principles of parsimony. The rule only
  provides a broad keyword annotation ('Methyltransferase') without any specific
  GO term predictions, limiting its utility for functional annotation. The massive
  number of condition sets makes meaningful overlap analysis computationally prohibitive
  and biologically questionable. This appears to be an attempt to capture every
  possible methyltransferase family through brute-force enumeration rather than
  principled classification. Such mega-rules are problematic for maintenance, validation,
  and biological interpretation."

action: REMOVE
action_rationale: "This rule should be removed for multiple critical reasons: (1)
  EXCESSIVE COMPLEXITY: 604 condition sets violates all principles of parsimony
  and creates an unmaintainable rule; (2) POOR ANNOTATION VALUE: Only provides
  broad keyword annotation without GO terms, limiting functional utility; (3) BIOLOGICAL
  INCOHERENCE: Impossible to validate that all 604 condition sets genuinely identify
  methyltransferases; (4) COMPUTATIONAL BURDEN: Analysis and maintenance costs
  far exceed annotation benefits; (5) CURATION NIGHTMARE: Individual validation
  of each condition set would require enormous effort. The rule should be decomposed
  into smaller, biologically coherent rules targeting specific methyltransferase
  families with appropriate GO term annotations."

suggested_modifications:
- Remove the entire mega-rule as unmaintainable and biologically incoherent
- Replace with smaller, family-specific rules (e.g., separate rules for DNA methyltransferases,
  RNA methyltransferases, protein methyltransferases, etc.)
- Each replacement rule should predict specific GO molecular function terms rather
  than broad keywords
- Limit condition sets to <20 per rule to enable proper validation and maintenance
- Focus on well-characterized methyltransferase families with clear literature support

parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: With 604 condition sets, this rule represents the antithesis of parsimony.
    The excessive complexity makes the rule unmaintainable, unvalidatable, and biologically
    incoherent. Normal ARBA rules contain 1-10 condition sets; 604 is completely
    unreasonable and suggests a systematic failure in rule design principles.

literature_support:
  assessment: UNDECIDED
  notes: Given the massive scope (1.58M proteins across 604 condition sets), comprehensive
    literature validation is practically impossible within reasonable time constraints.
    Individual methyltransferase families likely have literature support, but validating
    all 604 condition sets would require examining hundreds of papers across diverse
    enzyme families, organisms, and biochemical pathways.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: COMPLETE
  notes: With 604 condition sets, extensive overlap is virtually guaranteed. Many
    methyltransferase families share common structural domains (SAM-binding domains,
    catalytic residues) that would create massive redundancy. However, quantitative
    analysis is computationally prohibitive given the scale.

go_specificity:
  assessment: MISMATCHED
  notes: The rule provides no GO term annotations, only a broad keyword annotation
    (KW-0489 Methyltransferase). This is fundamentally inadequate for functional
    annotation. Methyltransferases perform diverse functions requiring specific
    GO terms like GO:0006304 (DNA methylation), GO:0001510 (RNA methylation), GO:0018022
    (peptidyl-lysine methylation), etc.

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: The rule affects 1.58M proteins across all domains of life without clear
    biological justification for such broad scope. Different condition sets have
    various taxonomic restrictions (Bacteria, Pseudomonadota, Gammaproteobacteria,
    etc.) but the overall scope is too vast for a single rule.
