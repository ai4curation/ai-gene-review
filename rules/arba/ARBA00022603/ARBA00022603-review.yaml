  INCOMPLETE REVIEW - REQUIRES RULE DATA ACCESS
  
  This review cannot be completed without access to the actual ARBA00022603 rule data from UniProt. The rule's specific condition sets, GO annotations, protein counts, and creation metadata need to be fetched from the UniProt ARBA database.
  
  Key missing information:
  - Actual InterPro/FunFam/PANTHER conditions
  - Predicted GO term(s) and aspect(s)
  - Number of annotated proteins (reviewed/unreviewed)
  - Rule creation and modification dates
  - Quantitative domain overlap analysis
  
  Once this data is available, a comprehensive review can assess:
  - Parsimony of condition sets
  - Literature support for domain-function relationships
  - Redundancy with InterPro2GO mappings
  - Biological appropriateness of GO specificity
  - Taxonomic scope validation
action: UNDECIDED
action_rationale: |
  Cannot recommend a specific action without access to the actual rule content. The assessment methodology requires:
  
  1. RULE DATA ACQUISITION: Fetch actual conditions and GO annotations from UniProt
  2. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS: Calculate domain overlap statistics and protein coverage
  3. LITERATURE VALIDATION: Search for supporting evidence for specific domain-function relationships
  4. REDUNDANCY ASSESSMENT: Check against InterPro2GO mappings and other annotation rules
  5. BIOLOGICAL VALIDATION: Assess GO term specificity and taxonomic scope appropriateness
  
  Potential actions (pending analysis):
  - ACCEPT: If rule provides unique, well-supported annotations
  - MODIFY: If conditions are sound but need refinement
  - DEPRECATE: If rule is redundant with existing mappings
suggested_modifications:
- "Fetch complete rule data from UniProt ARBA database"
- "Perform quantitative domain overlap analysis"
- "Validate against current InterPro2GO mappings"
- "Conduct literature review for specific domain-function relationships"
parsimony:
  assessment: UNDECIDED
  notes: |
    Cannot assess parsimony without knowledge of the actual condition sets. Key questions include:
    - How many condition sets does the rule contain?
    - Are there redundant AND requirements between domains?
    - Do any condition sets represent complete subsets of others?
    - Are there unnecessary taxonomic restrictions?

literature_support:
  assessment: UNDECIDED
  notes: |
    Literature assessment requires knowing the specific domain-function relationships predicted by this rule. General approach would include:
    - Searching PubMed for domain-specific functional studies
    - Validating mechanistic understanding of the predicted activity
    - Checking for contradictory evidence or known exceptions
    - Assessing depth and quality of supporting evidence

    supporting_text: "Manual research analysis highlighting limitations of assessment without access to actual rule content"
condition_overlap:
  assessment: UNDECIDED
  notes: |
    Domain overlap analysis requires access to:
    - Specific InterPro/FunFam/PANTHER identifiers in each condition set
    - Protein counts for each condition from UniProt
    - Intersection and union calculations for pairwise comparisons
    - Jaccard similarity and containment metrics
    
    Standard interpretation thresholds:
    - REDUNDANT: Jaccard > 0.9 (nearly identical conditions)
    - SUBSET: containment > 0.95 (one condition subsumes another)
    - HIGH_OVERLAP: Jaccard > 0.5 (substantial similarity)
    - MODERATE: 0.2 < Jaccard ≤ 0.5 (partial overlap)
    - LOW: Jaccard ≤ 0.2 (mostly distinct conditions)
    - DISJOINT: intersection = 0 (completely independent)

go_specificity:
  assessment: UNDECIDED
  notes: |
    GO specificity evaluation requires knowing the predicted GO term(s). Assessment criteria include:
    - Is the term at appropriate level in GO hierarchy?
    - Does it match the biological function of the domain(s)?
    - Are there more specific child terms that would be more appropriate?
    - Is the term too narrow for what the domains actually capture?
    - Is the aspect (MF/BP/CC) correct for the predicted function?
  supported_by: []
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: UNDECIDED
  notes: |
    Taxonomic assessment depends on whether the rule includes taxonomic restrictions and the evolutionary distribution of the predicted function. Key considerations:
    - Does the function exist across the specified taxonomic range?
    - Are there lineage-specific variations that require restriction?
    - Is the scope too broad (including taxa lacking the function)?
    - Is the scope too narrow (excluding taxa with conserved function)?
