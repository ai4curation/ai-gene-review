description: 'An overly complex rule with 89 condition sets that attempts to predict "alcohol metabolic process" (GO:0006066) across diverse taxonomic groups and enzyme families. The rule combines various unrelated enzyme families including cytochrome P450s, dehydrogenases, kinases, and metabolic enzymes.'

review_summary: 'This rule is fundamentally flawed with 89 condition sets that mix functionally diverse enzyme families under a single broad GO term. The rule combines cytochrome P450s, alcohol dehydrogenases, thiamine biosynthesis enzymes, sterol metabolism enzymes, and many others that do not share a coherent mechanistic basis for alcohol metabolism. The taxonomic scope varies wildly and inconsistently across condition sets. This rule should be removed and replaced with multiple specific rules for distinct alcohol metabolism pathways.'
action: DEPRECATE
action_rationale: 'This rule violates fundamental principles of good annotation rules: (1) It is extremely complex with 89 condition sets, far exceeding analysis capabilities; (2) It conflates diverse biochemical processes under one broad GO term; (3) Many condition sets appear to target enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis, thiamine metabolism, and other processes that are tangentially related to alcohol metabolism; (4) The taxonomic restrictions are inconsistent and appear arbitrary; (5) The rule is likely to produce many false positive annotations by capturing enzymes whose primary function is not alcohol metabolism.'
suggested_modifications:
- 'Replace with specific rules for distinct alcohol metabolism pathways (e.g., ethanol metabolism, sterol biosynthesis, thiamine metabolism)'
- 'Use more specific GO terms that accurately reflect the biochemical functions'
- 'Apply consistent taxonomic scope based on pathway distribution'
- 'Limit condition sets to enzymes with primary roles in the targeted process'
parsimony:
  assessment: OVERLY_COMPLEX
  notes: 'With 89 condition sets, this rule is extremely complex and violates the principle of parsimony. Many condition sets appear to target functionally distinct pathways that should be annotated separately. The rule attempts to capture too many disparate alcohol-related processes under a single annotation.'
literature_support:
  assessment: CONTRADICTED
  notes: 'While individual condition sets may target valid alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, the overall rule structure contradicts biochemical knowledge by grouping functionally diverse processes. Many targeted enzymes have primary roles in sterol biosynthesis, thiamine metabolism, or other processes where alcohol metabolism is secondary or indirect.'

    supporting_text: 'Deep research analysis could not be performed due to unavailable API keys. Assessment based on rule structure analysis and domain knowledge.'
condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: 'Cannot perform quantitative overlap analysis due to rule complexity (89 condition sets exceeds analysis threshold of 12). However, examination of condition sets reveals significant conceptual overlap and grouping of functionally distinct enzyme families that should be treated separately.'

go_specificity:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'GO:0006066 "alcohol metabolic process" is too broad for this rule. The condition sets target specific processes like sterol biosynthesis (should use GO:0016126), ethanol metabolism (should use GO:0006067), thiamine biosynthesis (should use GO:0009228), and other specific pathways that warrant their own terms.'

taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: TOO_BROAD
  notes: 'Taxonomic restrictions vary wildly across condition sets with no coherent biological rationale. Some target specific mammalian lineages, others target plant families, fungal groups, or have no taxonomic restrictions. This inconsistency suggests the rule was assembled without proper consideration of pathway evolution and distribution.'
