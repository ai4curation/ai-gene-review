description: Rule predicts GO:0051010 (microtubule plus-end binding) for proteins
  containing CAP-Gly domains (CLIP proteins), EB/RP family proteins, CLASP proteins,
  or CKAP5, in five condition sets with taxon-specific targeting across Glires, Primates,
  Fungi, and broader Eukaryota.
status: COMPLETE
rule_type: ARBA
action: ACCEPT
confidence: 0.85
action_rationale: The rule correctly identifies well-characterized microtubule plus-end
  binding protein families (CAP-Gly domain proteins, EB/RP family, CLASP proteins,
  XMAP215/ch-TOG). Literature evidence strongly supports plus-end binding for all
  targeted families. After removing redundant FunFams, this represents a biologically
  sound annotation rule with strong experimental support.
parsimony:
  assessment: REDUNDANT
  notes: 'Rule contains significant redundancy issues:

    1. Condition Set 1 has two completely redundant FunFams (2.30.30.190:FF:000001
    and 2.30.30.190:FF:000002) covering identical proteins in Glires. One should be
    removed.

    2. Condition Set 3 has two redundant FunFams (1.25.10.10:FF:000001 and 1.25.10.10:FF:000005),
    both for CLIP-associating protein 1 isoform 2 in Primates. One should be removed.

    3. Condition Set 2 contains redundant FunFams: 1.20.5.1430:FF:000001 (microtubule-associated
    protein RP/EB family member 1) is entirely contained within 1.10.418.10:FF:000007
    (RP/EB family member 2). The subset FunFam adds no additional coverage and should
    be removed.

    These redundancies violate parsimony principles and create unnecessary rule complexity
    without improving annotation coverage.

    supporting_text: Several condition sets in ARBA00088058 show considerable conceptual
      overlap. Condition Sets 1 and 3 both target CAP-Gly-containing linker proteins
      (CLIP family), differing only in taxonomic scope. Condition Set 2 targets EB
      proteins broadly across eukaryotes, while Condition Set 4 targets EB proteins
      specifically in fungi.
literature_support:
  assessment: STRONG
  notes: The GO term GO:0051010 (microtubule plus-end binding) is strongly supported
    by extensive experimental evidence for all targeted protein families (CAP-Gly
    domain proteins, RP/EB family proteins, CLIP-associating proteins, XMAP215/ch-TOG
    family). These are canonical microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) with
    well-characterized biochemical mechanisms for plus-end localization. While this
    specific GO term is notably absent from InterPro2GO mappings (suggesting a more
    granular annotation than typically inferred from domain presence alone), the biological
    function is robustly supported by multiple lines of evidence including live-cell
    imaging, in vitro reconstitution, structural biology, and genetic studies. The
    domain-based prediction is reliable because these protein families have evolved
    specialized structural features (CAP-Gly domains, EB CH domains, TOG arrays) specifically
    for plus-end recognition, distinguishing them from general microtubule-binding
    proteins.

    supporting_text: The literature supporting the proposed annotation rule is extensive
      and compelling. The founding observations that CLIP-170 and EB proteins track
      growing microtubule plus ends have been reproduced in numerous laboratories
      using multiple experimental approaches. The biochemical evidence for CAP-Gly
      domain binding to tubulin is robust and has been validated by structural biology.

condition_overlap:
  assessment: SIGNIFICANT
  notes: Condition Set 4 (EB proteins in Fungi) is entirely subsumed by Condition
    Set 2 (EB proteins in all Eukaryota). Additionally, Condition Sets 1 and 3 both
    target CAP-Gly proteins with different taxonomic scopes.

go_specificity:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: The GO term microtubule plus-end binding is appropriate for these protein
    families

    supporting_text: For CAP-Gly-containing proteins, the GO term GO:0051010 is highly
      appropriate. CAP-Gly domains have evolved specifically to recognize and bind
      C-terminal tubulin sequences, with binding affinities and specificities consistent
      with functional microtubule plus-end recognition. For EB proteins, the GO term
      is equally appropriate. EB proteins autonomously track growing microtubule plus
      ends in vivo and exhibit high-resolution binding specificity for the transitional
      conformational states present at growing ends.

      GTP-cap at plus ends and form tip comets in vitro and in vivo. CAP-Gly CLIPs:
      Appropriate but context-dependent. CLIP-170/CLIP1/2 bind plus ends primarily
      via EB-mediated hitchhiking; nonetheless, they physically localize to and bind
      plus ends in cells. XMAP215/ch-TOG: Strongly appropriate. XMAP215/ch-TOG/CKAP5
      localize to plus ends and act as polymerases; domain-level evidence links TOG5
      to tip tracking.'
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  notes: 'Taxonomic targeting is generally appropriate: Condition Set 1 Glires (rodents,
    rabbits) is narrow but justified; Condition Set 2 Eukaryota is appropriately broad
    for conserved RP/EB proteins; Condition Set 3 Primates is narrow but justified
    for CLIP-associating proteins; Condition Set 4 Fungi is appropriate kingdom-level
    targeting; Condition Set 5 Dikarya is appropriate fungal subgroup. The multi-lineage
    approach reflects genuine evolutionary diversification of plus-end binding protein
    families. No evidence of inappropriate taxonomic over-restriction.'

suggested_modifications:
- Remove FunFam 2.30.30.190:FF:000002 from Condition Set 1 as it is 100% redundant
  with 2.30.30.190:FF:000001
- Remove FunFam 1.25.10.10:FF:000005 from Condition Set 3 as it is 100% redundant
  with 1.25.10.10:FF:000001
- Remove FunFam 1.20.5.1430:FF:000001 from Condition Set 2 as it is entirely contained
  within 1.10.418.10:FF:000007
- Consider adding annotation qualifiers or evidence codes reflecting the computational
  nature of this prediction
review_summary: 'ACCEPT with modifications. The core biological annotation is sound
  - these are bona fide microtubule plus-end binding proteins. However, the rule requires
  cleanup to remove redundant FunFams before deployment. After removing the three
  redundant/subset FunFams identified, this would be a well-structured rule capturing
  legitimate taxon-specific diversification of plus-end tracking protein families.

  title: Deep research analysis from Perplexity (microtubule plus-end binding)
  findings:
  - statement: CAP-Gly domains are specialized protein-interaction modules that bind
      C-terminal EEY/F motifs on alpha-tubulin
    supporting_text: CAP-Gly domains are specialized protein-interaction modules approximately
      50 amino acids in length that function as specific recognition elements for
      C-terminal sequences on tubulin proteins. The primary biological function of
      CAP-Gly domains is to bind with high specificity to the C-terminal EEY/F-COO⁻
      sequence motifs present on alpha-tubulin molecules. This binding interaction
      occurs through a conserved GKNDG motif present within the CAP-Gly domain structure
      itself, which makes direct contact with the C-terminal tyrosine residue of the
      α-tubulin E-hook.
  - statement: EB proteins autonomously track growing microtubule plus ends through
      recognition of GTP-cap
    supporting_text: End-binding proteins (EB1, EB2, EB3 in mammals) represent the
      most highly conserved and arguably most important constituents of the +TIP complex.
      These proteins possess an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain that directly
      recognizes the growing microtubule plus end, a linker region, and a C-terminal
      coiled-coil domain essential for dimerization. Critically, EB proteins have
      the intrinsic ability to bind and track growing microtubule plus ends autonomously,
      without requiring interaction with other +TIP proteins.
  - statement: CLIP-170 requires EB1 for efficient plus-end localization as a hitchhiker
      +TIP
    supporting_text: CLIP-170 associates with microtubule plus ends in vivo through
      its interaction with EB1, a core +TIP protein. Single-molecule tracking studies
      show that CLIP-170 exchanges rapidly at growing microtubule plus ends, consistent
      with dynamic plus-end tracking rather than stable lattice binding. The requirement
      for EB1 in CLIP-170 plus-end localization indicates that CLIP-170 does not autonomously
      track plus ends but rather is recruited through interaction with the primary
      +TIP complex.
  - statement: CLASP proteins stabilize pre-catastrophe intermediate states at microtubule
      ends
    supporting_text: The mechanism by which CLASPs regulate microtubule dynamics involves
      stabilization of a nucleotide-dependent intermediate state at the microtubule
      end. CLASPs specifically stabilize the pre-catastrophe intermediate state between
      growth and shrinkage, thereby suppressing microtubule catastrophe and promoting
      microtubule rescue.
  - statement: XMAP215/ch-TOG family proteins act as processive microtubule polymerases
      at plus ends
    supporting_text: 'CKAP5 (cytoskeleton-associated protein 5) represents a distinct
      functional category among plus-end-binding proteins: CKAP5 acts as a processive
      microtubule polymerase. CKAP5 binds to the plus end of microtubules and regulates
      microtubule dynamics and organization while acting as a processive microtubule
      polymerase. The polymerase activity of CKAP5 places this protein in the XMAP215/Stu2
      family of microtubule regulators.'

  title: Deep research analysis from Falcon (microtubule plus-end binding)
  findings:
  - statement: EB proteins recognize GTP-like cap at plus ends with paralog-specific
      differences in affinity
    supporting_text: 'EB/RP family (EB1/EB2/EB3; yeast Bim1/Mal3): Autonomous +TIPs
      that bind the GTP-like cap at growing microtubule plus-ends, forming characteristic
      comets, recruiting SxIP-motif partners and CAP-Gly proteins via EBH/EEY modules,
      and modulating dynamics. Differences among paralogs: EB3 > EB1 > EB2 in plus-end
      affinity; EB2 cannot fully rescue EB1/EB3 functions.'
  - statement: CAP-Gly CLIPs are hitchhiker +TIPs dependent on EB for robust tip localization
    supporting_text: 'CAP-Gly CLIPs (CLIP-170/CLIP1/CLIP2): CAP-Gly +TIPs that localize
      to plus ends primarily by hitchhiking on EB proteins through EEY–CAP-Gly recognition;
      they link growing ends to organelles, motors (e.g., dynein initiation), and
      signaling complexes. Classic in vivo imaging demonstrates CLIP-170 tracks growing
      ends. Dependence on EB for robust tip localization is typical.'
  - statement: XMAP215/ch-TOG family members use TOG domains for tip tracking and
      polymerase activity
    supporting_text: 'XMAP215/ch-TOG family (CKAP5/ch-TOG/XMAP215; yeast Stu2): Autonomous
      +TIP microtubule polymerases that bind curved tubulin at the very tip to accelerate
      polymerization; also cooperate with γ-TuRC in nucleation. Plus-end localization
      and polymerase activity are hallmarks. Arrays of TOG domains (HEAT repeats).
      Domain specialization: TOG5 mediates plus-end/lattice engagement and tip tracking;
      TOG1–4 recruit soluble tubulin; TOG6 and a C-terminal region bind γ-TuRC/γ-tubulin
      to promote nucleation.'
