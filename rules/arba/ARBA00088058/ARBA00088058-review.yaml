description: 'Rule predicting microtubule plus-end binding (GO:0051010) based on CATH
  FunFam classifications for CAP-Gly domain proteins, microtubule-associated RP/EB
  family proteins, and CLIP-associating proteins across eukaryotes. The rule spans
  five condition sets with taxon-specific targeting across Glires, Primates, Fungi,
  and broader Eukaryota.

status: COMPLETE
action: MODIFY
confidence: 0.75
parsimony:
  assessment: NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT
  rationale: 'Rule contains significant redundancy issues:

    1. Condition Set 1 has two completely redundant FunFams (2.30.30.190:FF:000001
    and 2.30.30.190:FF:000002) covering identical proteins in Glires. One should be
    removed.

    2. Condition Set 3 has two completely redundant FunFams (1.25.10.10:FF:000001
    and 1.25.10.10:FF:000005) covering identical proteins in Primates. One should
    be removed.

    3. Condition Set 2 contains a subset relationship where FunFam 1.20.5.1430:FF:000001
    (microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 1) is entirely contained within
    1.10.418.10:FF:000007 (RP/EB family member 2). The subset FunFam adds no additional
    coverage and should be removed.

    These redundancies violate parsimony principles and create unnecessary rule complexity
    without improving annotation coverage.

literature_support:
  assessment: MODERATE
  rationale: 'The GO term GO:0051010 (microtubule plus-end binding) is well-established
    for the targeted protein families (CAP-Gly domain proteins, RP/EB family proteins,
    CLIP-associating proteins), which are known microtubule plus-end tracking proteins
    (+TIPs). However, this specific GO term is notably absent from InterPro2GO mappings,
    suggesting it may be a more granular annotation than typically inferred from domain
    presence alone.

    The biological function is strongly supported - these proteins are canonical plus-end
    binding proteins involved in microtubule dynamics, spindle assembly, and intracellular
    transport. The concern is whether domain-based rules can reliably distinguish
    "plus-end binding" from other microtubule-binding activities without additional
    context.

    '
taxonomic_scope:
  assessment: APPROPRIATE
  rationale: 'Taxonomic targeting is generally appropriate: - Condition Set 1: Glires
    (rodents, rabbits) - narrow but justified - Condition Set 2: Eukaryota - appropriately
    broad for conserved RP/EB proteins - Condition Set 3: Primates - narrow but justified
    for CLIP-associating proteins - Condition Set 4: Fungi - appropriate kingdom-level
    targeting - Condition Set 5: Dikarya - appropriate fungal subgroup

    The multi-lineage approach reflects genuine evolutionary diversification of plus-end
    binding protein families. No evidence of inappropriate taxonomic over-restriction.

proposed_improvements:
- action: REMOVE
  target: condition_set_1_funfam_2
  rationale: Remove FunFam 2.30.30.190:FF:000002 from Condition Set 1 as it is 100%
    redundant with 2.30.30.190:FF:000001
- action: REMOVE
  target: condition_set_3_funfam_2
  rationale: Remove FunFam 1.25.10.10:FF:000005 from Condition Set 3 as it is 100%
    redundant with 1.25.10.10:FF:000001
- action: REMOVE
  target: condition_set_2_subset_funfam
  rationale: Remove FunFam 1.20.5.1430:FF:000001 from Condition Set 2 as it is entirely
    contained within 1.10.418.10:FF:000007
- action: ADD_EVIDENCE_CLARIFICATION
  target: rule_annotation
  rationale: 'Consider adding annotation qualifiers or evidence codes that reflect
    the computational nature of this prediction, given that GO:0051010 is not in InterPro2GO
    and represents more specific functional knowledge than domain presence alone typically
    provides.

    '
overall_recommendation: 'ACCEPT with modifications. The core biological annotation
  is sound - these are bona fide microtubule plus-end binding proteins. However, the
  rule requires cleanup to remove redundant FunFams before deployment. After removing
  the three redundant/subset FunFams identified, this would be a well-structured rule
  capturing legitimate taxon-specific diversification of plus-end tracking protein
  families.
