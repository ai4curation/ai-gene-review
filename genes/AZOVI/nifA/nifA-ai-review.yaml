  label: Azotobacter vinelandii
description: 'NifA is a sigma-54-dependent transcriptional activator that serves as the master regulator of nitrogen fixation gene expression in Azotobacter vinelandii. It contains a GAF domain for signal sensing and NifL interaction, a central AAA+ ATPase domain that drives transcriptional activation through ATP hydrolysis and sigma-54 interaction, and a C-terminal HTH DNA-binding domain for promoter recognition. NifA activates transcription of nif operons by catalyzing the isomerization of closed promoter complexes to open complexes, enabling nitrogen fixation under appropriate environmental conditions.'

    label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'This annotation is correct but too general. NifA is specifically a sigma-54-dependent transcriptional activator, not just any DNA-binding transcription factor. The protein does bind DNA through its C-terminal HTH domain (494-513) and activates transcription, but GO:0001216 (DNA-binding transcription activator activity) would be more accurate as it specifies the activator function. Even better would be a term specific to bacterial-type RNA polymerase transcriptional activators working with sigma-54, though such a specific term may not exist.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'This annotation is correct and well-supported. NifA contains a sigma-54 interaction domain (211-439) which is an AAA+ ATPase domain with ATP binding sites at positions 239-246 and 302-311 according to UniProt structural annotations. ATP binding is essential for NifA function as it needs to hydrolyze ATP to drive the conformational changes in sigma-54-RNA polymerase complexes during transcriptional activation. This is a core molecular function of the protein.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'This biological process annotation is correct but could be more specific. NifA specifically performs positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase. The term GO:0045893 (positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription) would be more accurate as NifA is an activator, not a general regulator. However, this annotation is acceptable as a general biological process term.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'This biological process annotation needs refinement. While NifA is essential for nitrogen fixation (deletion mutants cannot grow diazotrophically), the protein itself does not perform nitrogen fixation - it regulates the expression of genes encoding nitrogenase and other proteins that actually fix nitrogen. A more accurate term would be "regulation of nitrogen fixation" or "positive regulation of nitrogen fixation" if such terms exist. NifA is a transcriptional regulator, not an enzyme that fixes nitrogen.'

  review:
    summary: 'This molecular function annotation is correct and specific. NifA binds to specific DNA sequences at nif promoters through its C-terminal HTH DNA-binding domain (494-513). The protein recognizes conserved upstream activating sequences (UAS) located at -24/-12 promoter regions typical of sigma-54-dependent promoters. This sequence-specific DNA binding is essential for NifA to activate transcription of its target genes. This is a core molecular function.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'This annotation appears to be incorrect and likely results from the UniProtKB keyword "Two-component regulatory system". However, NifA is NOT part of a classical two-component or phosphorelay system. NifA activity is regulated by the NifL protein through direct protein-protein interaction in response to oxygen/redox status, nitrogen availability, and carbon status. There is no evidence for phosphorylation-based regulation of NifA in the literature. The regulation occurs through conformational changes and protein complex formation, not phosphorylation cascades. This annotation should be removed.'

  review:
    summary: 'This annotation is correct but redundant and less specific than GO:0005524 (ATP binding) which is already annotated. GO:0000166 is a parent term of ATP binding. Since we have the more specific ATP binding annotation which accurately describes NifA nucleotide specificity, this broader term adds no additional information and could be considered over-annotation. However, it is not incorrect, just less informative.'
