description: 'Matrix protein 2 (M2) is a 97-amino acid transmembrane protein that
  forms a pH-activated, proton-selective ion channel essential for influenza A virus
  replication. The protein assembles as a homotetramer and functions in two critical
  stages of the viral life cycle: (1) during viral entry, M2 acidifies the virion
  interior to facilitate genome release from the viral ribonucleoprotein complex,
  and (2) during viral maturation, M2 maintains neutral pH in the trans-Golgi network
  to prevent premature conformational changes of hemagglutinin. The channel is selectively
  permeable to protons and is activated by low pH (~5.5-6.0). M2 is a validated antiviral
  drug target, though resistance to adamantane drugs is now widespread. NOTE: This
  review includes 5 PROPOSED NEW GO annotations based on well-documented functions
  from literature (viral budding, autophagosome manipulation, M1 recruitment, membrane
  scission, inflammasome activation) that are not yet in the GOA database.'

    label: monoatomic ion channel activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000104
  review:
    summary: This broad term accurately captures M2 function as an ion channel, though
      it is less specific than the proton channel activity. M2 forms a proton-selective
      channel that is well-characterized structurally and functionally. While accurate,
      more specific child terms like proton channel activity (GO:0015252) would be
      more informative.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While technically correct, this term is too general for a well-characterized
      proton-selective channel. The M2 channel is highly selective for protons over
      other monovalent cations, with extensive structural and functional evidence
      supporting its specific proton conductance mechanism.

    summary: This general biological process term is accurate but non-specific. M2
      specifically mediates proton transport across membranes during viral entry and
      maturation. The more specific term proton transmembrane transport (GO:1902600)
      better captures the actual function.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term is too general for a protein with well-characterized proton-specific
      transport function. M2 exclusively transports protons, not other monoatomic
      ions, and this specificity is crucial for its viral functions.

  review:
    summary: This molecular function term accurately describes M2 activity. M2 is
      a well-characterized proton transporter that mediates pH-activated proton flux
      across membranes. However, the more specific child term proton channel activity
      (GO:0015252) would better reflect that M2 functions as a channel rather than
      a carrier or pump.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While accurate, this parent term encompasses multiple mechanisms of proton
      transport including channels, pumps, and carriers. M2 specifically functions
      as a proton channel with passive, pH-gated transport, making the more specific
      proton channel activity term more appropriate.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000104
  review:
    summary: This biological process term is misleading for M2 function. M2 does not
      form pores in the plasma membrane for genome entry. Instead, M2 acidifies the
      virion interior within endosomes after receptor-mediated endocytosis, facilitating
      genome release from the RNP complex. The virus enters via endocytosis, not plasma
      membrane pore formation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Incorrect mechanism. Influenza virus enters cells through receptor-mediated
      endocytosis, not via pore formation in the plasma membrane. M2 functions within
      endosomes after viral uptake to acidify the virion interior, not to create entry
      pores in the plasma membrane.

      While some studies suggest influenza proteins can modulate autophagy, this is

      proton channel activity for viral entry and pH regulation during viral maturation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Potential secondary function but not well-established as a core M2 activity.
      The primary and well-characterized functions of M2 are proton channel activity

      and dynamics, combined with crystal structure information, indicate that His37
      residues interact with each other indirectly via water molecules in the dominant
      structure at equilibrium.

      domain architecture

      from influenza A virus at 1.65 Å resolution, showing the homotetrameric bundle
      structure
  - statement: Amantadine binds within the channel pore in a 1:1 stoichiometry with
      the tetrameric channel
    supporting_text: Structure shows single amantadine molecule bound in the N-terminal
      pore lumen of the tetrameric channel

      selectivity filter

  findings:
  - statement: M2 forms pH-activated proton channel essential for viral uncoating
      by acidifying virion interior
    supporting_text: The influx of protons into virion interior is believed to disrupt
      interactions between the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP), matrix protein 1 (M1),
      and lipid bilayers

    full_text_unavailable: false
  - statement: M2 maintains neutral pH in trans-Golgi network to prevent premature
      hemagglutinin activation
    supporting_text: M2 is expressed in the Golgi and pumps protons out of Golgi vesicles,
      raising the luminal pH. This prevents the premature conformational activation
      of HA during transport to the cell surface

    full_text_unavailable: false
  - statement: M2 recruits M1 to plasma membrane to initiate viral assembly
    supporting_text: Fluorescence microscopy studies in infected cells show that M2
      actively recruits M1 to the membrane, initiating assembly of virion buds

  - statement: M2 amphipathic helix induces membrane scission for virion budding
    supporting_text: M2's amphipathic helix in its cytoplasmic tail induces membrane
      curvature and scission during the final step of budding. M2 localizes to the
      budding neck (at the edge of lipid rafts where hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase
      cluster) and its amphipathic helix inserts into the inner leaflet, deforming
      the membrane to pinch off the virion

  - statement: His37 and Trp41 form pH-sensitive gate controlling proton conductance
    supporting_text: His37 is the pH-activated switch, and Trp41 is the check-valve,
      together conferring M2's unique gating and selectivity properties

  - statement: M2 ectodomain is highly conserved across all influenza A strains making
      it a universal vaccine target
    supporting_text: The first 9 residues of M2e are almost absolutely invariant among
      all influenza A isolates – this includes human, swine, equine, avian strains,
      and even the divergent bat influenza viruses

  - statement: S31N mutation confers amantadine resistance and is present in >95%
      of circulating strains
    supporting_text: By the mid-2000s, S31N became nearly fixed in human H3N2 and
      H1N1 strains globally, such that >95% of circulating human influenza A viruses
      were amantadine-resistant

  - statement: M2 engages host autophagy machinery through conserved LC3-interacting
      region
    supporting_text: M2 has a conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) in its cytosolic
      tail that engages the host autophagy machinery. M2 interacts with LC3 (a marker
      on autophagosome membranes), and this interaction was shown to redistribute
      autophagosomes to the plasma membrane where virus buds

  - statement: MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase targets M2 for lysosomal degradation as
      host restriction factor
    supporting_text: the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 was recently shown to redirect
      M2 to lysosomes for degradation, thereby inhibiting influenza virion release
      (a host defense strategy)
