description: XdhB encodes the large catalytic subunit of xanthine dehydrogenase, a
  molybdo-flavoenzyme that catalyzes the two-step oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine
  and xanthine to uric acid during purine catabolism. The protein harbors a molybdopterin
  cofactor and iron-sulfur cluster essential for substrate oxidation and electron
  transfer. In Acetobacter pasteurianus, XdhB is crucial for utilizing purines as
  nitrogen sources and contributes significantly to thermotolerance, with mutations
  in this gene resulting in thermosensitive phenotypes.
