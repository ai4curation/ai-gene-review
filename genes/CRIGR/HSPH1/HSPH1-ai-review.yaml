description: >-
  HSPH1 (Hsp105/Hsp110) is a member of the Hsp110 family, a significantly diverged subgroup
  of the Hsp70 superfamily. It has two core molecular functions: (1) holdase chaperone activity,
  preventing the aggregation of heat-denatured proteins by maintaining them in a soluble,
  folding-competent state (significantly more efficient than Hsc70 at this function), and
  (2) nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) activity for Hsp70 family members (HSPA1A, HSPA1B),
  promoting ADP release and triggering substrate release. Importantly, HSPH1 does NOT itself
  refold denatured proteins; refolding requires Hsc70/Hdj-1. HSPH1 also inhibits HSPA8/HSC70
  ATPase activity. Overexpression confers substantial thermoresistance in vivo.

      TreeGrafter-inferred nuclear localization. UniProt subcellular location for Q60446
      lists only cytoplasm (by similarity to human Q92598). However, the deep research
      review (HSPH1-deep-research-falcon.md) notes that Hsp105alpha (HSPH1) localizes
      constitutively to both cytoplasm and nucleus in multiple mammalian tissues,
      including brain. The TreeGrafter inference is therefore supported by recent
      literature on mammalian orthologs.

      Nuclear localization is supported by literature on mammalian HSPH1 orthologs.

      compartment is the cytosol where the holdase and NEF activities operate.
      Keeping as non-core since it is a secondary localization.

      TreeGrafter-inferred involvement in protein folding. HSPH1 is involved in protein
      folding homeostasis, but importantly it is a holdase, not a foldase. It maintains
      denatured proteins in a folding-competent state but does NOT actively refold them
      (PMID:9395504). Refolding requires Hsc70/Hdj-1. The term 'protein folding' is
      acceptable as a broad biological process annotation since HSPH1 participates in
      the protein folding pathway (by handing off substrates to the Hsc70/Hdj-1 refolding
      machinery), but its direct activity is holding, not folding. As a NEF, HSPH1 also
      accelerates Hsp70 cycling which supports the overall protein folding process (deep
      research review, HSPH1-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      HSPH1 participates in the protein folding pathway by preventing aggregation and
      maintaining substrates in a folding-competent state for subsequent refolding by
      Hsc70/Hdj-1. The BP term 'protein folding' is broadly acceptable but HSPH1 is a
      holdase, not a foldase, so this is kept as non-core. Its direct role is prevention
      of aggregation rather than active folding.

      HSPH1 belongs to the Hsp70 superfamily and possesses the conserved nucleotide-binding

      specific and is already annotated.

      Nucleotide binding is correct for HSPH1, which has a conserved Hsp70-type
      nucleotide-binding domain. While more general than the co-annotated GO:0005524

    action: ACCEPT

      ATP binding is a core property of HSPH1. The Hsp110 family binds ATP through

      belongs to the Hsp70 superfamily and has the conserved ATPase domain architecture,
      Hsp110 family members have greatly reduced intrinsic ATPase activity compared to
      canonical Hsp70 chaperones. The deep research review (HSPH1-deep-research-falcon.md)
      emphasizes that HSPH1 functions primarily as a NEF rather than an ATPase. The ATPase
      annotation from the broad Hsp70 family InterPro entry is misleading for this
      diverged subfamily.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED

      Hsp110 family members have significantly reduced ATPase activity compared to

      superfamily, and while the domain architecture is conserved, Hsp110 members have
      diverged to function primarily as holdases and NEFs rather than as ATPases.
      Annotating HSPH1 with GO:0016887 (ATP hydrolysis activity) overstates its
      catalytic function. The core molecular functions are holdase chaperone activity
      and NEF activity (GO:0000774).
