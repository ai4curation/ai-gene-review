## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q60446
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Heat shock protein 105 kDa; AltName: Full=Heat shock 110 kDa protein;
- **Gene Information:** Name=HSPH1; Synonyms=HSP105, HSP110;
- **Organism (full):** Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster) (Cricetulus barabensis griseus).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family. .
- **Key Domains:** ATPase_NBD. (IPR043129); Heat_shock_70_CS. (IPR018181); HSP70_C_sf. (IPR029048); HSP70_peptide-bd_sf. (IPR029047); Hsp_70_fam. (IPR013126)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HSPH1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster) (Cricetulus barabensis griseus).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HSPH1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HSPH1** (gene ID: HSPH1, UniProt: Q60446) in CRIGR.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity: The target is HSPH1 (aliases HSP110/HSP105), a large Hsp70-like chaperone; UniProt Q60446 corresponds to HSPH1 from Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster). Literature on mammalian HSPH1 describes the same protein class and domain architecture, supporting cross-species functional inference (Hsp70-like NBD and SBD) (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8).

Comprehensive research report on HSPH1 (HSP110/HSP105)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Definition and family: HSPH1 encodes a large heat shock protein of the Hsp110 subfamily within the Hsp70 superfamily. It contains an Hsp70-like N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD/ATPase) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) (conceptual alignment with Hsp70 architecture described in 2024 sources) (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39). Functionally, HSPH1 operates as a nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF) for Hsp70s, catalyzing ADP-to-ATP exchange on the Hsp70 NBD to reset the chaperone for subsequent substrate cycles (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39). URL/date: 2024 review summary (no DOI provided in excerpt) (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39).
- Mechanistic role in the Hsp70 system: As a NEF, HSPH1 binding to Hsp70’s NBD accelerates nucleotide exchange; ATP rebinding opens Hsp70 and promotes client release. HSPH1 thereby increases Hsp70 folding throughput and participates in chaperone-mediated disaggregation with Hsp70 and J-domain proteins (DNAJs) (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 22-25). URL/date: Chuang et al., bioRxiv, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.11.575109 (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 22-25).
- Holdase-like properties: Under severe stress, HSPH1 has been described to help keep heat-denatured clients soluble and refolding-competent, complementing Hsp70 action (tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14). URL/date: Tandon et al., Acta Biomaterialia, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2024.07.036 (tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Small-molecule modulation of the Hsp70–HSPH1 disaggregase: A 2024 study defined dihydropyrimidine scaffolds that stimulate human Hsp70–DNAJ–HSPH1 disaggregase activity. The reference compound 115-7c increased disaggregation approximately two-fold in vitro, and an optimized analog (“compound 18”) enhanced activity across a range of Hsp70/Hsp40/Hsp110 stoichiometries with selectivity for DnaJB1/DnaJB4-containing sets, without detectable cytotoxicity in cell assays (bioRxiv, Jan 2024) (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 25-29). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.11.575109 (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 25-29).
- Disaggregation mechanism and stoichiometry: The same 2024 work showed both human HSPH1 (Hsp105) and HSPH2 (Apg2) stimulate Hsp70-mediated disaggregation and reactivation of luciferase and can promote dissolution of disease-relevant amyloids (e.g., α-synuclein), with outcomes depending on Hsp70/Hsp40/Hsp110 ratios; inappropriate stoichiometry can impair activity (bioRxiv, Jan 2024) (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 22-25). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.11.575109 (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 22-25).
- System-level induction in neuronal heat stress: In human neuronal models, heat exposure induced coordinated upregulation of HSPH1 alongside DNAJB1 and BAG3 within the Hsp70 network, consistent with HSF1-driven heat shock response dynamics (Biology, Mar 2023) (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12030416 (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18).
- Disease model observation (microphysiological system): In a 3D valve-on-chip model of early calcific aortic valve disease, HSPH1 abundance increased in diseased tissues, consistent with roles in proteostasis under stress and potential links to survival signaling pathways (Acta Biomaterialia, Sep 2024) (tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2024.07.036 (tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14).

3) Primary function, substrates/clients, and localization
- Primary biochemical function: HSPH1 is a NEF for cytosolic Hsp70s (e.g., HSPA1A/HSPA8), binding the Hsp70 NBD to catalyze ADP→ATP exchange; this resets Hsp70 to the open, low-affinity state, releasing bound substrate and enabling additional folding cycles (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39). This enhances Hsp70 folding activity and supports disaggregation (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39). URL/date: 2024 review summary (no DOI provided in excerpt) (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39).
- Disaggregation substrates: In reconstituted human systems, Hsp70–DNAJ–HSPH1/2 can disaggregate heat-denatured luciferase and disease-associated amyloids including α-synuclein; related studies cite activity on tau and polyQ-expanded proteins in Hsp70 disaggregase paradigms (bioRxiv, 2024; literature compilation) (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8, ansari2025investigatingtherole pages 139-140). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.11.575109 (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8); summary citing multi-article evidence (ansari2025investigatingtherole pages 139-140).
- Cellular localization: HSPH1 (Hsp105α) localizes constitutively to cytoplasm and nucleus in multiple mammalian tissues, including brain; a stress-inducible Hsp105β splice variant exists (not always tested in vitro) (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8). URL/date: bioRxiv, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.11.575109 (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8).

4) Pathways, protein quality control, and organelle/stress compartment dynamics
- HSF1-driven heat shock response: HSPH1 is induced as part of the HSF1-regulated chaperone network during heat shock, with reported rapid transcript and delayed protein accumulation kinetics in neuronal heat-stress models (peak gene induction ~1 h; protein upregulated over the subsequent hours) (Biology, Mar 2023) (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12030416 (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18).
- Hsp70 co-chaperone circuitry and fate decisions: BAG3 biases Hsp70 clients toward autophagy (aggrephagy), while CHIP (a U-box E3) promotes ubiquitination leading to proteasomal degradation; HSPH1, by accelerating Hsp70 cycling, functionally couples into these fate pathways and contributes to disaggregation upstream of BAG3- or CHIP-directed clearance (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39). URL/date: 2024 review summary (no DOI provided in excerpt) (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39).
- Stress granules and translation recovery: Hsp70 systems participate in stress granule disassembly and translation restart; HSPH1, as the principal cytosolic Hsp70 NEF in metazoans, supports this process by enabling efficient Hsp70 cycles under stress (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39). URL/date: 2024 review summary (no DOI provided in excerpt) (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39).
- Aggrephagy and proteasome/autophagy crosstalk: Mechanistic compendia indicate that Hsp70 disaggregation machinery (with HSPH1/NEF activity) intersects with proteolysis/autophagy pathways for aggregate processing. Summaries emphasize that Hsp110 shapes early steps of disaggregation by Hsp70 and that disaggregation can feed into proteolytic routing depending on co-chaperone context (compilation citing 2024–2025 primary studies) (ansari2025investigatingtherole pages 139-140, ansari2025investigatingtherolea pages 139-140). URL/date: 2025 review citing 2024 mechanistic work (no DOI in excerpt) (ansari2025investigatingtherole pages 139-140, ansari2025investigatingtherolea pages 139-140).

5) Oncologic and disease correlations; expert analyses
- Cancer biology and signaling: Reviews and summaries link HSPH1 to survival signaling (e.g., NF-κB) and proliferation under stress; HSPH1 can modulate pathways such as β-catenin via PP2A recruitment and is reported to be phosphorylated by CK2 (site Ser509) (MDPI IJMS review, Jan 2024) (zhang2024heatshockproteins pages 19-19). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25020876 (zhang2024heatshockproteins pages 19-19).
- Biomarker and therapeutic context: In the 3D valve-on-chip study, HSPH1 abundance increased in diseased samples, positioning it among proteostasis-linked changes associated with early disease processes (Acta Biomaterialia, Sep 2024) (tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2024.07.036 (tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14). Additional oncology-focused compendia highlight emergent HSP110 inhibitors and roles in tumor stress adaptation and drug resistance (summary of recent studies) (ansari2025investigatingtherolea pages 139-140). URL/date: 2025 review citing 2020–2024 primary works (no DOI in excerpt) (ansari2025investigatingtherolea pages 139-140).
- Expert network perspective: The 2024 small-molecule work emphasizes that chaperone stoichiometry is a critical determinant of disaggregase output in human cells and neurons, suggesting tissue-specific vulnerabilities if Hsp70/Hsp40/HSPH1 ratios drift with stress or aging (bioRxiv, Jan 2024) (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 25-29). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.11.575109 (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 25-29).

6) Subcellular dynamics and stress-induced relocalization
- Cytosol and nucleus: Constitutive cytoplasmic and nuclear localization is reported for Hsp105α (HSPH1) (bioRxiv, Jan 2024) (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.11.575109 (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8).
- Stress granules: Hsp70 systems contribute to stress granule disassembly and translational recovery after stress; by serving as the NEF for Hsp70, HSPH1 supports efficient chaperone cycling in these compartments (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39). URL/date: 2024 review summary (no DOI provided in excerpt) (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39).

7) Chinese hamster/CHO evidence and orthology-based inference
- Direct Cricetulus griseus/CHO data: We did not retrieve specific CHO/Hamster primary studies for HSPH1 within 2020–2026 searches above. Given the strong conservation of Hsp110/Hsp70 systems and domain architecture, the mammalian evidence for HSPH1’s NEF role, cytosolic/nuclear localization, and participation in disaggregation is highly likely to translate to Chinese hamster HSPH1 (UniProt Q60446) (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8). Where species-specific findings are absent, conclusions are inferred by orthology and conserved domain function (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8).

8) Current applications and real-world implementations; relevant statistics
- Therapeutic modulation: In vitro, the Hsp70–DNAJ–HSPH1 disaggregase can be pharmacologically enhanced; the small molecule 115-7c produced about a two-fold increase in disaggregation activity against model substrates, and “compound 18” further optimized activity across multiple chaperone combinations while remaining non-toxic in tested paradigms (bioRxiv, Jan 2024) (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 25-29). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.11.575109 (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 25-29).
- Disease-model implementation: A 3D valve-on-chip platform modeling early calcific aortic valve disease reported increased HSPH1 abundance in diseased tissues, aligning with proteostasis stress signatures in pathogenesis (Acta Biomaterialia, Sep 2024) (tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2024.07.036 (tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14).
- Cancer-focused expert analysis: Summaries from 2024–2025 compilations describe HSPH1 as part of adaptive survival networks in tumors and discuss emerging HSP110 inhibitors in preclinical studies; while specific hazard ratios are not provided in the excerpts here, these sources position HSPH1 as a potential biomarker/target in oncology, warranting context- and tumor-type-specific validation (zhang2024heatshockproteins pages 19-19, ansari2025investigatingtherolea pages 139-140). URL/date: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25020876 (2024) (zhang2024heatshockproteins pages 19-19); 2025 review (no DOI in excerpt) (ansari2025investigatingtherolea pages 139-140).

Mechanistic summary and functional annotation (for HSPH1, Cricetulus griseus, UniProt Q60446)
- Molecular function: Hsp70 NEF activity that accelerates ADP→ATP exchange on Hsp70 NBD to promote client release and increase folding/disaggregation throughput; large Hsp70-like chaperone with NBD and SBD (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5).
- Biological processes: Protein folding; protein disaggregation with Hsp70 and J-domain proteins; maintenance of proteostasis under heat and proteotoxic stress; interface with client routing to autophagy (via BAG3) or UPS (via CHIP) (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39).
- Cellular localization: Cytosol and nucleus under basal conditions; participates in stress responses influencing stress-granule dynamics and translation recovery (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8, boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39).

- Applications: Pharmacologic stimulation of Hsp70–HSPH1 disaggregase; disease-model upregulation in microphysiological systems; oncology biomarker/target potential (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14, zhang2024heatshockproteins pages 19-19, ansari2025investigatingtherolea pages 139-140).

Notes on evidence quality and recency
- 2024 primary preprint provides detailed mechanistic and pharmacologic insights (chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 1-5, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 5-8, chuang2024definingasmallmolecule pages 25-29). 2024 Acta Biomaterialia offers peer-reviewed disease-model evidence (tandon2024athreedimensionalvalveonchip pages 12-14). 2023 neuronal study corroborates network induction and timing under heat stress (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18). Reviews/summaries integrate additional mechanistic connections and cancer relevance (boopathy2024characterizingtheregulationb pages 34-39, zhang2024heatshockproteins pages 19-19, ansari2025investigatingtherolea pages 139-140).
