description: >-
  HbpA (Hydrophobic protein A) is a small, non-catalytic accessory scaffoldin from
  Clostridium cellulovorans. It contains a single cohesin domain for recruiting
  dockerin-bearing enzymes and an SLH-like (surface layer homology) module for cell
  surface attachment. Located within the cbpA/cellulosomal gene cluster (Clocel_2820),
  HbpA functions as an accessory component of the cellulosome system, contributing to
  enzyme recruitment and cell surface anchoring. Unlike the primary scaffoldin CbpA,
  HbpA has only one cohesin and appears to play a supplementary organizational role.

    label: polysaccharide catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is incorrect. HbpA is a non-catalytic scaffoldin-like protein
      that organizes enzymes but does not itself catalyze polysaccharide catabolism.
      Like CbpA, it should not be annotated with catalytic process terms.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      HbpA has no catalytic domain. It is a structural/organizational protein that
      recruits enzymes via its cohesin domain but does not directly participate in
      polysaccharide breakdown.

    label: carbohydrate binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is questionable. While UniProt shows CBM2/CBM3 superfamily hits,
      the curated literature emphasizes the cohesin and SLH-like modules rather than
      a validated carbohydrate-binding module. The CBM signal may reflect distant homology.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The CBM annotation is inconsistent with experimental literature which describes
      HbpA as having cohesin and SLH-like domains. Until direct carbohydrate binding
      is validated, this annotation should be treated with caution.
