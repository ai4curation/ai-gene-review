  label: Clostridium cellulovorans
description: >-
  EngO is a non-cellulosomal glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) endoglucanase from
  Clostridium cellulovorans. Unlike cellulosomal cellulases (EngK, EngL), EngO lacks a
  dockerin domain and is not incorporated into the cellulosome complex. Instead, it
  functions as a free secreted enzyme with its own carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs)
  for substrate targeting. EngO contains a GH9 catalytic domain, CBM (CenC-type), and
  Ig-like domains. It hydrolyzes internal β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose, releasing
  cello-oligosaccharides that complement the action of cellulosomal enzymes.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct. EngO is an endoglucanase that directly participates
      in polysaccharide (cellulose) catabolism by hydrolyzing β-1,4-glycosidic bonds.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      As a GH9 endoglucanase, EngO directly catalyzes the breakdown of polysaccharides.
      This function is well-supported by GH9 family characterization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct but generic. EngO has hydrolase activity on
      O-glycosyl bonds. More specific terms like GO:0008810 (cellulase activity)
      better capture its function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      This is a true parent term of the more specific cellulase activity. It's
      correct but not the most informative annotation for this enzyme.
