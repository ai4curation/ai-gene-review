## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P38058
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cellulose-binding protein A; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=cbpA;
- **Organism (full):** Clostridium cellulovorans.
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Carbo-bd_X2. (IPR005102); CBM2/CBM3_carb-bd_dom_sf. (IPR008965); CBM3. (IPR001956); CBM3_sf. (IPR036966); Cohesin_dom. (IPR002102)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "cbpA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Clostridium cellulovorans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'cbpA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **cbpA** (gene ID: P38058, UniProt: P38058) in CLOCL.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Research report: cbpA (UniProt P38058) from Clostridium cellulovorans

Verification and identity
- Gene/protein: cbpA encodes the major cellulosomal scaffoldin Cellulose-binding protein A (CbpA), a large non-catalytic protein (~1,848 aa, historically observed as the P170 band) in the extracellular cellulosome of Clostridium cellulovorans (Gram-positive anaerobe). The original cloning/sequencing established an N-terminal signal peptide (~28 aa) and the overall length; subsequent biochemical work mapped multiple cohesin repeats and cellulose-binding capacity (sequence accession reported in 1992; UniProt maps this to P38058) (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.89.8.3483; Apr 1992) (shoseyov1992primarysequenceanalysis pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.183.18.5431-5435.2001; Sep 2001) (park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1002/1528-0691(2001)1:1<24::aid-tcr5>3.0.co;2-w; Jan 2001) (doi2001theclostridiumcellulovorans pages 2-3).
- Ambiguity check: The cbpA symbol is used in other organisms for unrelated proteins; here, all cited work confirms C. cellulovorans scaffoldin CbpA (P38058) with CBM3 and cohesins in a cellulosome context. No switch to a different gene was made (shoseyov1992primarysequenceanalysis pages 1-2, park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2, doi2001theclostridiumcellulovorans pages 2-3).

Domain architecture and definitions
- Core modules: CbpA is a modular scaffoldin composed of an N-terminal Sec signal peptide; one cellulose-binding module of family 3 (CBM3) that binds crystalline cellulose; several hydrophilic X2 modules; and nine cohesin repeats (type I cohesins) that recruit dockerin-bearing enzymatic subunits (https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.202100064; Jun 2021) (tarraran2021cell‐surfacebindingdomains pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.183.18.5431-5435.2001; Sep 2001) (park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.89.8.3483; Apr 1992) (shoseyov1992primarysequenceanalysis pages 1-2).
- CBM3 concept: CBM3 (notably CBM3a) presents an extended planar surface that engages multiple cellulose chains, favoring crystalline cellulose binding and substrate-targeting of the complex. Contemporary analysis of CBMs 1/2/3 emphasizes their binding surface chemistry and utility in functionalizing cellulose materials (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40643-024-00790-4; Jul 2024) (li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 1-3, li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 3-5).
- X2 modules: X2 are small (~100 aa), hydrophilic non-catalytic modules common in mesophilic clostridial scaffoldins. Proposed roles include stabilizing adjacent domains and modulating interactions; X2 are not canonical carbohydrate-binding modules and often do not bind cellulose directly (summary of the C. cellulovorans/CipC literature and cross-species findings) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1638551; Sep 2025) (lindic2025structuralandfunctional pages 4-5, lindic2025structuralandfunctional pages 1-2).

Primary function and mechanism (current understanding)
- Scaffolding: CbpA is the primary non-catalytic backbone of the C. cellulovorans cellulosome. It recruits dockerin-bearing enzymes (endoglucanases, exoglucanases, xylanases, etc.) via high-specificity cohesin–dockerin interactions to create a multienzyme complex that acts on plant cell wall polysaccharides (https://doi.org/10.1002/1528-0691(2001)1:1<24::aid-tcr5>3.0.co;2-w; Jan 2001) (doi2001theclostridiumcellulovorans pages 2-3), (https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.183.18.5431-5435.2001; Sep 2001) (park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2).
- Substrate targeting: The CBM3 mediates binding of the assembled complex to crystalline cellulose, increasing local enzyme concentration at the substrate and promoting synergistic hydrolysis (https://doi.org/10.1002/1528-0691(2001)1:1<24::aid-tcr5>3.0.co;2-w; Jan 2001) (doi2001theclostridiumcellulovorans pages 2-3), (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40643-024-00790-4; Jul 2024) (li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 1-3, li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 3-5).
- Cohesin set and specificities: Nine cohesins are present; different cohesin repeats exhibit different binding behaviors toward specific dockerin-bearing enzymes. For example, MalE-Coh6 bound EngE and ExgS in vitro, whereas MalE-Coh1 bound weakly; dockerin presence on enzymes such as EngB is required for binding to CbpA (https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.183.18.5431-5435.2001; Sep 2001) (park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2).

Cellular localization
- Secretory signal and extracellular location: CbpA contains a Sec-type signal peptide and is secreted, assembling into an extracellular cellulosome. The C. cellulovorans cellulosome is extracellular (~1×10^6 Da); anti-scaffoldin antibody blocks binding to cellulose and inhibits degradation, demonstrating extracellular substrate attachment function (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.89.8.3483; Apr 1992) (shoseyov1992primarysequenceanalysis pages 1-2), (https://doi.org/10.1002/1528-0691(2001)1:1<24::aid-tcr5>3.0.co;2-w; Jan 2001) (doi2001theclostridiumcellulovorans pages 2-3).
- Cell surface association: C. cellulovorans can display its cellulosome on or near the cell surface, with attachment achieved via cell-surface modules in other scaffoldins or via noncovalent interactions; some clostridia assemble “free” (non-anchored) cellulosomes depending on scaffoldin composition (cross-species context) (2025 review) (santos2025unconventionalcohesindockerinbindingc pages 37-40, santos2025unconventionalcohesindockerinbindinga pages 37-40, santos2025unconventionalcohesindockerinbinding pages 37-40).

Interactions within the cellulosome
- Dockerin-bearing partners: Binding assays demonstrated CbpA cohesins interact with dockerins on several C. cellulovorans enzymes: EngE (endoglucanase), EngB (endoglucanase), ExgS (exoglucanase), among others; binding requires the dockerin module on the enzyme (https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.183.18.5431-5435.2001; Sep 2001) (park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2).
- Functional consequence: Antibody inhibition of the scaffoldin (P170/CbpA) blocked binding to cellulose and reduced crystalline cellulose hydrolysis, underscoring the essential scaffolding and substrate-attachment roles (https://doi.org/10.1002/1528-0691(2001)1:1<24::aid-tcr5>3.0.co;2-w; Jan 2001) (doi2001theclostridiumcellulovorans pages 2-3).

Recent developments (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Genome-scale landscape of cellulosomes (2024): A comprehensive survey of 305,693 bacterial genomes identified 33 cellulosome-capable species and classified “simple” versus “complex” architectures. Clostridium-lineage microbes typically harbor simpler cellulosomes (fewer scaffoldin types) relative to Acetivibrio/Ruminococcus. The study underscores conserved cohesin–dockerin type specificity with known exceptions and the diversity of anchoring mechanisms, informing how C. cellulovorans CbpA fits among simple mesophilic clostridial systems (https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1473396; Oct 30, 2024) (minor2024agenomicanalysis pages 1-2).
- CBM3 structure–function in materials and catalysis (2024): A recent review details how CBM3’s planar binding surface engages three cellulose chains, and how CBM fusions or chemical coupling strategies are used to functionalize cellulose (immobilization, material strengthening, sensorization). These insights generalize to CbpA’s CBM3 in substrate targeting and serve as a platform for engineering (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40643-024-00790-4; Jul 2024) (li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 1-3, li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 3-5).
- X2 module status: Recent cross-species analyses argue X2 domains often stabilize adjacent domains rather than bind cellulose directly, refining older assumptions about X2 function in C. cellulovorans-like scaffoldins (summary) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1638551; Sep 2025) (lindic2025structuralandfunctional pages 4-5, lindic2025structuralandfunctional pages 1-2).

Current applications and implementations
- Synthetic scaffoldins and surface display using C. cellulovorans domains: A 2021 biotechnology study used domains from C. cellulovorans CbpA (CBM3 and X2) and EngE to build synthetic scaffoldins expressed and secreted by Lactococcus lactis. Only constructs bearing three EngE S-layer homology (SLH) modules bound the L. lactis surface, but the authors used CBM-based cellulose binding assays to track secretion/localization. This demonstrates practical reuse of C. cellulovorans CbpA-derived modules for designer cellulosomes and microbial surface display (https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.202100064; accepted May 19, 2021) (tarraran2021cell‐surfacebindingdomains pages 1-2).
- CBM-enabled cellulose functionalization (2024): CBM3 from cellulosomal scaffoldins is widely used to immobilize enzymes and add functions to cellulose; approaches include genetic fusion, noncovalent avidin/antibody adapters, and covalent “click” strategies. These platforms support biocatalysis, materials strengthening, and biomedical uses, highlighting the translational value of CbpA-like CBM3s (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40643-024-00790-4; Jul 2024) (li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 1-3, li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 3-5).

Expert assessment and quantitative/structural data
- Sequence and secretion: cbpA encodes ~1,848 aa with an N-terminal 28-aa signal peptide consistent with Sec-dependent secretion (PNAS 1992) (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.89.8.3483; Apr 1992) (shoseyov1992primarysequenceanalysis pages 1-2).
- Cohesin count and mapping: Nine cohesins with variable sequence identity (40–95% relative to a reference cohesin) were mapped; cohesins differ in binding to dockerin-bearing enzymes (J. Bacteriol. 2001) (https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.183.18.5431-5435.2001; Sep 2001) (park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2).
- Functional necessity in cellulose degradation: Antibody against the scaffoldin (P170) blocks cellulosome binding to cellulose and inhibits crystalline cellulose degradation (Chemical Record 2001) (https://doi.org/10.1002/1528-0691(2001)1:1<24::aid-tcr5>3.0.co;2-w; Jan 2001) (doi2001theclostridiumcellulovorans pages 2-3).
- Cross-species cohesin–dockerin specificity (2024): Most cohesin–dockerin pairs maintain type-specific binding (Doc1↔Coh1, etc.) with noted exceptions; mesophilic Clostridium often classified as “simple” cellulosomes. This contextualizes C. cellulovorans CbpA’s nine cohesins as a relatively streamlined scaffoldin within the broader diversity (Frontiers in Microbiology 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1473396; Oct 2024) (minor2024agenomicanalysis pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions (concise)
- Scaffoldin (CbpA): non-catalytic backbone that organizes cellulosomal enzymes via cohesin–dockerin binding, and targets cellulose through CBM3 (doi2001theclostridiumcellulovorans pages 2-3, park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2).
- CBM3: a carbohydrate-binding module with a planar binding face that binds crystalline cellulose; in scaffoldins, it concentrates enzyme activity on substrate (li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 1-3, li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 3-5).
- Cohesin–dockerin: species- and type-specific protein–protein interaction that assembles enzymes onto scaffoldins; C. cellulovorans CbpA harbors nine cohesins (park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2, minor2024agenomicanalysis pages 1-2).
- X2 module: small hydrophilic domain in clostridial scaffoldins; often stabilizing/structural rather than cellulose-binding per se (lindic2025structuralandfunctional pages 4-5, lindic2025structuralandfunctional pages 1-2).

Limitations and open questions
- Direct 2023–2024 biochemical data on individual C. cellulovorans CbpA cohesin–dockerin affinities are limited; most quantitative mapping comes from earlier work. Recent advances largely derive from cross-species studies and CBM engineering literature (minor2024agenomicanalysis pages 1-2, li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 1-3, li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 3-5). Nevertheless, the core architecture and function of CbpA in C. cellulovorans are well established by primary sequence, secretion signals, cohesin mapping, and functional blocking experiments (shoseyov1992primarysequenceanalysis pages 1-2, park2001cohesindockerininteractionsof pages 1-2, doi2001theclostridiumcellulovorans pages 2-3).
