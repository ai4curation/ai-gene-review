  label: Clostridium cellulovorans
description: >-
  CbpA is the primary cellulosomal scaffoldin of Clostridium cellulovorans, a large
  non-catalytic protein (~1,848 aa) that serves as the organizational backbone for the
  cellulosome multi-enzyme complex. The protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide for
  secretion, one CBM3 (carbohydrate-binding module family 3) that binds crystalline cellulose,
  four X2 hydrophilic modules, and nine type I cohesin domains that recruit dockerin-bearing
  cellulolytic enzymes. CbpA targets the cellulosome to cellulose substrates and organizes
  multiple enzymes (endoglucanases, exoglucanases, xylanases) into a highly efficient
  degradative complex.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is misleading for CbpA. CbpA is a non-catalytic scaffoldin that
      organizes enzymes but does not itself catalyze polysaccharide catabolism. The
      cellulosome complex as a whole participates in this process, but attributing it
      to the scaffoldin alone misrepresents its role.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      CbpA is a structural/organizational protein, not a catalytic enzyme. While it
      enables polysaccharide catabolism by organizing enzymes, it does not directly
      participate in the catabolic reaction.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct. CbpA contains an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-28)
      and is secreted to the extracellular space where it assembles into the cellulosome
      complex. It remains associated with the cell surface.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt clearly documents the signal peptide and states "Secreted. Note=Remains at
      the cell surface." The literature confirms CbpA functions extracellularly.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is too general and misrepresents CbpA's role. CbpA does not
      metabolize carbohydrates; it organizes enzymes that do. This is an overly broad
      annotation derived from domain composition.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED

      CbpA is non-catalytic. It facilitates carbohydrate metabolism by organizing
      catalytic enzymes, but does not itself perform any metabolic reaction.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is misleading. CbpA itself does not catabolize cellulose. It

      enzymes, but the scaffoldin has no catalytic activity.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      As a non-catalytic scaffoldin, CbpA enables but does not directly perform cellulose
      catabolism. The annotation should be on the catalytic enzymes, not the scaffoldin.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct. CbpA contains a CBM3 domain that binds carbohydrates,

      This annotation is correct and represents a core molecular function of CbpA.
      The CBM3 domain specifically binds crystalline cellulose, targeting the cellulosome
      to its substrate.
    action: ACCEPT

      Cellulose binding via CBM3 is a well-characterized function of CbpA, demonstrated

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is incorrect. CbpA is involved in degrading plant cell walls
      (as a target substrate), not in bacterial cell wall organization. The UniProt
      keyword mapping appears to have conflated cell wall degradation with cell wall
      organization.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      GO:0071555 refers to organization of the organism's own cell wall. CbpA is involved
      in degrading external plant cell wall material, which is a different process.
