  label: Clostridium cellulovorans
description: >-
  EngK is a glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) endoglucanase from the Clostridium
  cellulovorans cellulosome. It contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a GH9 catalytic
  domain, a CBM4 carbohydrate-binding module, and a C-terminal type I dockerin domain
  for cellulosome assembly. EngK catalyzes endo-1,4-β-glucanase activity, cleaving
  internal β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose to produce primarily cellobiose. It
  synergizes with the GH48 exoglucanase ExgS for efficient cellulose hydrolysis and
  shows reduced sensitivity to cellobiose inhibition compared to EngH.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct. EngK is an endoglucanase that directly participates
      in polysaccharide (cellulose) catabolism by hydrolyzing β-1,4-glycosidic bonds.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      As a GH9 endoglucanase, EngK directly catalyzes the breakdown of polysaccharides.
      This is a core function supported by biochemical characterization.

  evidence_type: IEA

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct but generic. EngK has hydrolase activity on
      O-glycosyl bonds. More specific terms like GO:0008810 (cellulase activity)
      better capture its function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      This is a true parent term of the more specific cellulase activity. It's
      correct but not the most informative annotation for this enzyme.
