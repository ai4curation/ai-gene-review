description: >-
  EngL is a glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) endoglucanase from the Clostridium
  cellulovorans cellulosome. It contains a GH9 catalytic domain and a C-terminal type
  I
  dockerin domain for cellulosome assembly. Unlike non-cellulosomal cellulases (e.g.,
  EngD),
  EngL lacks an intrinsic carbohydrate-binding module and relies on dockerin-mediated
  incorporation into the CbpA scaffoldin for cellulose targeting. EngL functions as
  an
  endo-β-1,4-glucanase that hydrolyzes internal β-1,4 linkages in cellulose.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation is correct. EngL is an endoglucanase that directly participates
        in polysaccharide (cellulose) catabolism by hydrolyzing β-1,4-glycosidic bonds.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        As a GH9 endoglucanase, EngL directly catalyzes the breakdown of polysaccharides.
        This is a core function supported by biochemical characterization.

    review:

        This annotation is correct but generic. EngL has hydrolase activity on
        O-glycosyl bonds. More specific terms like GO:0008810 (cellulase activity)
        better capture its function.

      reason: >-
        This is a true parent term of the more specific cellulase activity. It's
        correct but not the most informative annotation for this enzyme.
