description: PSEEN0657 is an uncharacterized 635-amino acid protein containing a DUF2134 (Domain of Unknown Function 2134) domain and Tad (tight adherence) domains associated with pilus assembly machinery. This protein features a putative Flp pilus-assembly TadG-like N-terminal domain and is predicted to be involved in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. The protein represents an important but poorly understood component of the Type IV pilus system in Pseudomonas entomophila, an entomopathogenic soil bacterium. Understanding this protein's function is crucial for elucidating bacterial adhesion mechanisms in environmental contexts, particularly in estuary sediment environments where P. entomophila interactions are ecologically significant.
