  label: Xenopus tropicalis
description: Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) that catalyzes the NAD-dependent
  oxidation of retinaldehyde to all-trans retinoic acid (RA), the bioactive vitamin
  A metabolite. Essential enzyme in the retinoic acid biosynthetic pathway that controls
  spatiotemporal RA production during embryonic development. Critical for posterior
  body axis patterning, heart morphogenesis, limb bud initiation, and organogenesis.
  In adult tissues, contributes to immune regulation and tissue homeostasis.

    label: aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This is a valid annotation based on phylogenetic inference. ALDH1A2 belongs
      to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family and contains conserved NAD-binding domain
      and catalytic residues. However, the more specific term GO:0001758 (retinal
      dehydrogenase activity) better captures the enzyme's substrate specificity.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: While technically correct (ALDH1A2 does metabolize aldehydes), this term
      is too general. The enzyme specifically metabolizes retinaldehyde to retinoic
      acid, which is better captured by GO:0002138 (retinoic acid biosynthetic process).

  review:
    summary: This is the core molecular function of ALDH1A2. The enzyme specifically
      catalyzes the oxidation of retinaldehyde to retinoic acid using NAD+ as a cofactor.
      This function is well-established across vertebrates and supported by extensive
      biochemical and genetic evidence.

  review:
    summary: This is an overly general parent term. While ALDH1A2 is indeed an oxidoreductase,
      the more specific term GO:0001758 (retinal dehydrogenase activity) should be
      used instead.
