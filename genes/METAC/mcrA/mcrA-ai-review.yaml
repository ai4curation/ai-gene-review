  label: Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A
description: 'mcrA encodes the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), the key enzyme catalyzing the final step of methanogenesis in archaea. This enzyme converts methyl-coenzyme M and coenzyme B into methane and a heterodisulfide. The protein forms part of a hexameric complex containing two alpha, two beta, and two gamma chains. It contains a unique nickel-containing prosthetic group (coenzyme F430) essential for catalysis. In methanotrophic archaea, this enzyme can function in reverse for anaerobic methane oxidation. The gene serves as a molecular marker for detecting methanogens and methanotrophs in environmental samples.'
