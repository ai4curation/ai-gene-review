  label: Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A
description: mcrA encodes the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase 
  (MCR), the key enzyme catalyzing the final step of methanogenesis in archaea. 
  This enzyme converts methyl-coenzyme M and coenzyme B into methane and a 
  heterodisulfide. The protein forms part of a hexameric complex containing two 
  alpha, two beta, and two gamma chains. It contains a unique nickel-containing 
  prosthetic group (coenzyme F430) essential for catalysis. In methanotrophic 
  archaea, this enzyme can function in reverse for anaerobic methane oxidation. 
  The gene serves as a molecular marker for detecting methanogens and 
  methanotrophs in environmental samples.
