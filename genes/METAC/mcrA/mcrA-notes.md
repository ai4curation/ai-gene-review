# mcrA Gene Review Notes

## Colleague Question
**Contact**: sgtringe@lbl.gov
**Key Issue**: Difficulty distinguishing methanogens vs methanotrophs by sequence alone

## Key Findings

### Core Function
- Methyl-coenzyme M reductase catalyzes the **terminal step of methanogenesis**
- Converts methyl-CoM + CoB → methane + CoM-S-S-CoB
- Contains unique F430 nickel cofactor essential for catalysis

### Methanogen vs Methanotroph Distinction
**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: The same enzyme works in REVERSE in methanotrophs!
- **Methanogens**: Use mcrA for methane production (forward direction)
- **Methanotrophs (ANME)**: Use mcrA for methane oxidation (reverse direction)
- Sequence alone is insufficient - need ecological/metabolic context

### Distinguishing Features
1. **Phylogenetic context**: ANME lineages cluster separately
2. **Syntrophic partners**: ANME often with sulfate-reducing bacteria
3. **Environmental context**: Deep sea vs terrestrial/freshwater
4. **Gene neighborhood**: Look for associated electron transfer proteins
5. **Isotope signatures**: In environmental samples, δ13C values differ

### Evolutionary Significance
- Ancient enzyme, possibly predating oxygenic photosynthesis
- Horizontal transfer between archaea documented
- Key player in global carbon cycle and climate regulation

## GO Annotation Review
- Accepted core methanogenesis annotations
- Added note about bidirectional activity
- Emphasized nickel cofactor binding specificity
