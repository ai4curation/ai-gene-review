  label: Scheffersomyces stipitis CBS 6054
description: 'XYL1 encodes NAD(P)H-dependent D-xylose reductase (XR), a 318-amino acid cytosolic enzyme belonging to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. This enzyme catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in xylose metabolism in Scheffersomyces stipitis, reducing D-xylose to xylitol using preferentially NADPH as cofactor. XR exhibits broad aldose reductase activity on sugars like L-arabinose, D-ribose, and D-galactose, though D-xylose is its primary physiological substrate. The enzyme is essential for growth on xylose-containing media and enables S. stipitis to ferment pentose sugars to ethanol, a rare ability among yeasts. Expression is strongly induced by xylose and repressed by glucose through carbon catabolite repression.'

proposed_new_terms:
  - proposed_name: 'dual NAD(P)H-dependent D-xylose reductase activity'
    proposed_definition: 'Catalysis of the reduction of D-xylose to xylitol using either NADPH (preferred) or NADH as cofactor. This term represents enzymes that can efficiently utilize both cofactors, unlike strictly NADPH-dependent or NADH-dependent reductases.'
    justification: 'XYL1 from S. stipitis shows unusual dual cofactor usage with 70% NADH activity relative to NADPH. This dual capability is rare among aldose reductases and has biotechnological significance for cofactor balance in engineered fermentation pathways. Current GO terms only capture single-cofactor activities.'
    supported_by:
      - reference_id: PMID:3921014
        supporting_text: 'Unlike all aldose reductases characterized so far, the enzyme from this yeast was active with both NADPH and NADH as coenzyme. The activity with NADH was approx. 70% of that with NADPH for the various aldose substrates'
  - proposed_name: 'intracellular xylitol accumulation'
    proposed_definition: 'The process by which xylitol accumulates within a cell as an intermediate metabolite, typically due to imbalanced flux through the xylose metabolic pathway under oxygen-limited conditions.'
    justification: 'Xylitol accumulation is a characteristic phenotype of XR/XDH pathway imbalance in xylose-fermenting yeasts, particularly under anaerobic conditions. This process has industrial significance and represents a distinct metabolic state not captured by existing GO terms.'
    supported_by:
      - reference_id: 'file:PICST/XYL1/XYL1-deep-research.md'
        supporting_text: 'if XDH (XYL2) activity is insufficient or oxygen is limited (hindering NADH reoxidation), S. stipitis will excrete xylitol as a byproduct. This accumulation of xylitol is a hallmark of imbalance in the XR/XDH pathway'
