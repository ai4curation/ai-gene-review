# brt Gene Review Notes

## Colleague Question
**Contact**: jbanfield@berkeley.edu
**Key Interest**: Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) in phage adaptation

## Key Findings

### Discovery of Targeted Mutagenesis System
- **First DGR system discovered** in Bordetella phage BPP-1
- Generates 10^13 protein variants per locus
- Targeted hypermutation for rapid adaptation
- Revolutionary mechanism for protein diversification

### Molecular Mechanism
1. **Reverse transcription**:
   - Template repeat (TR) transcribed to RNA
   - brt reverse transcribes with adenine-specific infidelity
   - Aâ†’N mutagenesis (A can become any nucleotide)

2. **Targeting specificity**:
   - Variable repeat (VR) in target gene replaced
   - Maintains reading frame during mutagenesis
   - Focuses variation on surface-exposed residues

3. **Accessory factors**:
   - Avd protein essential for retrohoming
   - Forms complex with brt
   - Directs cDNA to specific VR location

### Biological Significance
- **Phage adaptation**: Rapidly evolves receptor binding proteins
- **Host range switching**: Generates tropism variants
- **Immune evasion**: Escapes host recognition
- **Biofilm targeting**: Adapts to different exopolysaccharides

## GO Annotation Review
- Added RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity
- Added mutagenic DNA synthesis
- Emphasized retroelement-specific functions
- Distinguished from standard reverse transcriptases

## DGR Distribution
- Found in phages, bacteria, archaea
- >1000 DGR systems identified
- Present in human microbiome
- Used by pathogens and commensals
