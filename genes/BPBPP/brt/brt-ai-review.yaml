  label: Bordetella phage BPP-1
description: Brt encodes a reverse transcriptase that drives the diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) system in Bordetella phage BPP-1. This RT catalyzes targeted hypermutation during tropism switching, enabling the phage to alter its host receptor specificity. Through target-primed reverse transcription with adenine-specific mutagenesis, Brt generates extraordinary sequence diversity (up to 10^12 variants) in the major tropism determinant (Mtd) protein, the phage tail fiber receptor-binding protein. This mutagenic homing mechanism allows rapid adaptation to different Bordetella host phases regulated by the BvgAS system, representing a unique retroelement function distinct from viral replication or retrotransposition.

  review:
    summary: Brt reverse transcriptase is localized to the viral capsid as part of the Bordetella phage BPP-1 structural machinery where it functions in the diversity-generating retroelement system
    action: NEW
    reason: Viral capsid localization is essential for Brt's role in the bacteriophage DGR system. As a phage-encoded reverse transcriptase, Brt must be packaged within the viral capsid to be delivered to host cells where it can catalyze target-primed reverse transcription and generate sequence diversity in the major tropism determinant
