description: >-
  Zebrafish alpha-crystallin B chain a (cryaba, also known as cryab or alphaB1-crystallin)
  is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP/HSP20) family. It is one of two
  zebrafish alphaB-crystallin paralogs arising from the teleost whole-genome duplication,
  with cryaba being the lens-specific paralog and cryabb retaining the broad expression
  pattern of mammalian CRYAB (PMID:16420472). cryaba is predominantly expressed in the
  lens with lower expression in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and liver (PMID:16420472).
  In the lens, cryaba localizes around the entire fiber cell membrane producing a
  honeycomb appearance (PMID:18406404). Recombinant cryaba (alphaB1-crystallin) has
  reduced chaperone-like activity compared to human CRYAB, particularly at higher
  temperatures, though it retains some chaperone activity at 25-30 degrees C
  (PMID:15692462, PMID:16420472). Loss of cryaba increases age-related cataract in
  zebrafish, with cryaba null fish showing greater lens opacity at 24 months than
  cryaa null fish (PMID:38705506). Single-cell RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data show an
  ontogenetic shift in alpha-crystallin usage, with cryaa predominating at 5-6 dpf
  and cryaba becoming more important after 10 dpf (PMID:38705506). cryaba makes up
  approximately 0.16% of total zebrafish lens protein (PMID:16420472). Morpholino
  knockdown of cryaba causes skeletal muscle defects, myofibril disassembly, heart
  failure, and locomotory impairment in zebrafish embryos (PMID:25866181). The protein
  contains zinc-binding residues at positions 101, 103, and 108.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from mammalian alpha-crystallins
      (CRYAA, CRYAB, HSPB1) which have documented anti-apoptotic roles. The
      anti-apoptotic function of alpha-crystallins is well-established for mammalian
      orthologs. While not directly demonstrated for zebrafish cryaba, the phylogenetic
      inference is reasonable. However, this is not a core molecular function of cryaba
      but rather a downstream biological process.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Anti-apoptotic activity is a recognized function of the sHSP family but represents
      a downstream biological process rather than a core molecular function. The IBA
      inference from mammalian CRYAB orthologs is phylogenetically sound. Retained as
      non-core since the primary function is structural role in the lens and holdase
      activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for protein refolding, inferred primarily from Drosophila sHSP
      orthologs. Alpha-crystallins function as holdases rather than foldases -- they
      prevent aggregation of denaturing proteins but do not actively refold them.
      cryaba has reduced but measurable chaperone-like (holdase) activity
      (PMID:15692462, PMID:16420472). The protein refolding term is inaccurate for
      a holdase.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      Alpha-crystallins are holdase chaperones that prevent aggregation of unfolded
      proteins but do not catalyze refolding. GO:0042026 implies active refolding
      activity, which is inaccurate for cryaba. GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier
