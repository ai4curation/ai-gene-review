description: >-
  Zebrafish alpha-crystallin A chain (cryaa) is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP/HSP20)
  family. It is a 173-amino acid protein predominantly expressed in the lens, with very low expression
  in liver and spleen (PMID:11925526). Like its mammalian ortholog, zebrafish cryaa functions as an
  ATP-independent molecular chaperone (holdase) that binds denaturing/unfolding proteins and prevents
  their aggregation, without actively refolding them (PMID:15692462, PMID:22479631). It forms large
  oligomers and its chaperone-like activity is regulated by hydrophobicity and temperature-dependent
  subunit exchange dynamics (PMID:22479631). In the lens, cryaa serves a dual role as both a
  structural protein contributing to lens transparency and refractive properties, and as a chaperone
  that prevents crystallin aggregation and cataract formation (PMID:16728471). Morpholino knockdown
  and knockout studies demonstrate that cryaa is required for normal lens development, where it
  prevents gamma-crystallin insolubility and maintains lens fiber cell differentiation
  (PMID:16728471, PMID:26149094). The zebrafish cryaa shares 73% amino acid identity with human
  CRYAA and has conserved chaperone function, though with lower thermal stability reflecting
  adaptation to lower physiological temperature (PMID:15692462, PMID:22479631). A crystal structure
  of the alpha-crystallin domain (PDB: 3N3E) has been resolved at 1.75 angstrom resolution. The
  protein contains zinc-binding residues at positions 101, 103, and 108.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from mammalian alpha-crystallins (CRYAA, CRYAB,
      HSP27/HSPB1) which have documented anti-apoptotic roles. The anti-apoptotic function of
      alpha-crystallins is well-established for mammalian orthologs. While not directly demonstrated
      for zebrafish cryaa, the phylogenetic inference is reasonable given the high conservation of
      the protein. However, this is not a core molecular function of cryaa but rather a downstream
      biological process consequence of its chaperone activity.

      Anti-apoptotic activity is a recognized function of the sHSP family but represents a

      phylogenetically sound, propagated from mammalian orthologs with documented anti-apoptotic
      roles. Retained as non-core since the primary function is chaperone/holdase activity and
      structural role in the lens.

      However, alpha-crystallins function specifically as holdases, not foldases. They bind
      denaturing proteins to prevent aggregation but do not actively refold them. The chaperone-like
      activity assays in PMID:15692462 and PMID:22479631 specifically measure prevention of
      aggregation, not refolding. Alpha-crystallins sequester unfolded substrates in a
      non-aggregation-prone state but require ATP-dependent chaperones (like Hsp70) for subsequent
      substrate refolding.
    action: MODIFY

      Alpha-crystallins are holdase chaperones that prevent aggregation of unfolded proteins but

      which is inaccurate for cryaa. The protein prevents aggregation rather than restoring native
      conformation. A more appropriate term would capture the holdase/aggregation-prevention
      function. The IBA inference likely propagated from Drosophila sHSPs where the distinction
      between holdase and foldase activity may not have been well-captured.

  review:
    summary: >-
      NAS annotation for visual perception based on Runkle et al. 2002 (PMID:11925526). While
      cryaa is essential for lens transparency and therefore indirectly required for visual
      perception, this annotation is an over-annotation. cryaa does not directly participate in
      visual perception (signal transduction from photoreceptors to the brain) -- it contributes
      to the structural and optical properties of the lens. The term GO:0007601 encompasses the
      entire visual perception process from light stimulus detection through neural processing.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      While cryaa is required for lens transparency which is necessary for light transmission
      to the retina, annotating it to GO:0007601 (visual perception) is an over-annotation.
      Visual perception refers to the entire process of sensing light stimuli and generating
      neural signals. cryaa contributes to the optical properties of the lens, which is better
      captured by GO:0005212 (structural constituent of eye lens) and GO:0002088 (lens development
      in camera-type eye), both of which are already annotated. The NAS evidence code further
      indicates this is not based on direct experimental evidence.

          These data suggest that zebrafish alphaA-crystallin plays a physiologically
          limited role outside of the zebrafish lens, similar to its mammalian
          orthologues.

        Zebrafish alphaA-crystallin has robust chaperone-like activity similar to its
        mammalian ortholog, preventing aggregation of chemically denatured target proteins.
        Zebrafish alphaA shows greater chaperone-like activity than zebrafish alphaB.

    formation in the zebrafish cloche mutant lens.
  findings:
    - statement: >-
        Zebrafish cloche mutants deficient in alphaA-crystallin develop lens cataracts due
        to gamma-crystallin insolubility. Exogenous alphaA-crystallin rescues lens
        transparency, gamma-crystallin solubility, and lens fiber cell differentiation.
      supporting_text: >-
        these results indicate that alphaA-crystallin expression is required for normal
        lens development and demonstrate that cataract formation can be prevented in
        vivo.

  findings:

        Comparative analysis of six teleost fish alphaA-crystallins demonstrates that
        chaperone-like activity and thermal stability are correlated with species
        physiological temperature. Site-directed mutagenesis of zebrafish cryaa hydrophobic
        residues (V62T, C143S, T147V) confirms structure-function relationships in holdase
        activity.

        Assays of each αA-crystallin's chaperone-like activity showed that the ability to
        prevent the aggregation of denaturing proteins was correlated with the physiological
        temperature of each species (Fig. 2).

  findings:

        Morpholino knockdown and CRISPR knockout of zebrafish cryaa cause lens
        abnormalities. Maternal/zygotic mutants show severe lens phenotypes rescued by rat
        alphaA-crystallin, confirming conserved role in lens development.
      supporting_text: >-
        These findings demonstrate that the role of α-crystallins in lens
        development is conserved from mammals to zebrafish and set the stage for using
        the embryonic lens as a model system to test mechanistic aspects of α-crystallin
        chaperone activity and to develop strategies to fine-tune protein-protein
        interactions in aging and cataracts.

      cryaa functions as an ATP-independent holdase chaperone that binds denaturing/unfolded
      proteins and prevents their aggregation. This has been directly demonstrated by in vitro
      chaperone-like activity assays showing prevention of chemically-induced aggregation of
      insulin and lactalbumin (PMID:15692462, PMID:22479631). The holdase mechanism involves
      oligomeric subunit exchange and exposure of hydrophobic surfaces to capture denaturing
      substrates.

      cryaa is a major structural protein of the zebrafish eye lens, contributing to its
      transparency and refractive properties. It is predominantly expressed in the lens with
      very low extralenticular expression (PMID:11925526). Loss of cryaa leads to
      gamma-crystallin insolubility and cataract formation (PMID:16728471).
