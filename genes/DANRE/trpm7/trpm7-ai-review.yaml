description: Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is a unique ion channel-kinase fusion protein that functions as a calcium- and magnesium-permeable cation channel with an intrinsic serine/threonine protein kinase domain. Essential for cellular ion homeostasis, TRPM7 regulates Mg2+ and Ca2+ influx and is required for multiple developmental processes including melanophore survival, mechanosensory neuron function, dopaminergic neuron development, cardiac pacemaking, exocrine pancreas development, and skeletal mineralization. The protein localizes primarily to the plasma membrane where it forms homo-tetrameric channel complexes.

    label: protein kinase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic evidence. The deep research confirms TRPM7 contains a C-terminal alpha-kinase domain with serine/threonine kinase activity. However, this term is too general - the specific kinase type should be specified.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While TRPM7 does have protein kinase activity, the more specific term GO:0004674 (protein serine/threonine kinase activity) better represents the actual molecular function of the alpha-kinase domain.
