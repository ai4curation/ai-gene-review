# Trpm7 in *Danio rerio* (Zebrafish)

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
**Trpm7** (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7) encodes a unique **ion channel-kinase fusion protein**. It functions as a **calcium- and magnesium-permeable cation channel** with an intrinsic **serine/threonine protein kinase** domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Introduction)) ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,channel%20subfamily%20M%20member%207)). This **“channel-kinase”** structure is a hallmark of TRPM7 (and its close relative TRPM6) and is not found in most other ion channels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=)). As an ion channel, TRPM7 mediates the influx of divalent cations (notably Ca^2+ and Mg^2+) across cell membranes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular ion homeostasis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Introduction)). The channel’s activity is **negatively regulated by intracellular Mg^2+ and Mg-ATP** levels – high internal magnesium or ATP can inhibit TRPM7 channel currents ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=TRPM7%20is%20one%20of%20the,and%20other%20polyvalent%20molecules%209)). This feedback regulation links the channel’s conductance to the cell’s metabolic and ion status. The C-terminal α-kinase domain of Trpm7 can phosphorylate itself and other substrates, though its in vivo targets are still being characterized. Through this dual functionality, Trpm7 couples ion transport with signaling: for example, changes in Mg^2+ or Ca^2+ influx via TRPM7 may activate its kinase or other pathways to modulate cellular processes. Overall, Trpm7 serves as an important regulator of **cation homeostasis**, second-messenger signaling (Ca^2+-dependent pathways), and possibly cytoskeletal dynamics via its kinase activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20using%20truncation%20mutations%2C%20we,concerned%20with%20sensing%20magnesium%20only)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Introduction)). This **essential cellular role** is highlighted by the fact that complete loss of Trpm7 is embryonic lethal in mice and frogs, indicating its **critical, conserved function** in early development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=TRPM7%20is%20a%20member%20of,that%20the%20biophysical%20properties%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Transient%20receptor%20potential%20melastatin,Trpm7%20is%20essential%20for%20the)). In zebrafish, total loss-of-function is survivable to larval stages but leads to a spectrum of physiological defects (see below), underscoring Trpm7’s central role in multiple molecular processes.

## Cellular Localization and Components  
Trpm7 is an **integral membrane protein** that primarily localizes to the **plasma membrane** of cells ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,channel%20subfamily%20M%20member%207)). Like other TRP family channels, Trpm7 spans the membrane (with six transmembrane helices per subunit) and forms homo-tetrameric channel complexes in the lipid bilayer. The channel is positioned such that its ion-conducting pore allows Ca^2+, Mg^2+, and other small cations to flow from the extracellular space or organelle lumen into the cytosol. Consistent with this, Trpm7 has been detected on the **cell surface** of many cell types. In zebrafish, Trpm7 protein is broadly distributed; for instance, it is present in neuronal membranes (supporting its role in excitability and sensory function) and in kidney tubule membranes (involved in ion reabsorption) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=homeostasis%20of%20divalent%20cations%20including,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)). The **kinase domain** of Trpm7 faces the cytosol, where it can interact with intracellular substrates. While the plasma membrane is the principal site of Trpm7 action ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,channel%20subfamily%20M%20member%207)), some studies suggest Trpm7 might also function in certain intracellular membranes or vesicles (for example, influencing vesicular calcium stores), though such roles are less defined. Within the cell, Trpm7 often co-localizes with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins, hinting at its participation in subcellular signaling complexes. However, **“plasma membrane”** is the key Gene Ontology cellular component term for Trpm7, reflecting its role as a transmembrane ion channel at the cell periphery ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,channel%20subfamily%20M%20member%207)).

## Biological Processes and Phenotypes  
Trpm7 in zebrafish is involved in **numerous biological processes**, which has been revealed largely through mutant phenotypes and functional studies. Notable processes and phenotypic outcomes include:

- **Melanophore Development and Survival:** Trpm7 is required for the survival of embryonic melanophores (pigment cells). Zebrafish *trpm7* mutants (e.g. *touchtone* and *nutria* alleles) show extensive **melanophore cell death** during development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Additional%20roles%20for%20Trpm7%20in,Henion%2C%202004%20%3B%20%2033)). The melanin-producing cells die and their **melanosomes (pigment organelles) are structurally abnormal** in Trpm7 mutants ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=et%20al,Additionally)). This phenotype is cell-autonomous – restoring Trpm7 specifically in melanophores rescues their survival ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=structurally%20abnormal%20%28McNeill%20et%20al,trpm7%20in%20primary%20sensory%20neurons)). It is thought that Trpm7’s absence leads to toxic build-up of melanin intermediates in melanophores, causing death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=structurally%20abnormal%20%28McNeill%20et%20al,trpm7%20in%20primary%20sensory%20neurons)). Thus, Trpm7 is critical for **pigment cell development** and may regulate melanosome integrity or ion balance in these cells.

- **Mechanosensory Response (Touch-Evoked Behavior):** Trpm7 is essential for normal touch responses in developing zebrafish. Mutant larvae exhibit a transient **unresponsiveness to touch stimuli** – for about 12 hours during early development, *trpm7* mutants fail to perform the typical escape reflex when touched ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=intermediates%20of%20melanin%20synthesis%20into,and%20magnesium%20is%20abnormal%20in)). This defect in **touch-evoked escape behavior** can be rescued by expressing Trpm7 specifically in primary sensory neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=trpm7%20mutant%20larvae%20are%20unresponsive,associated%20Corpuscle%20of%20Stannius)), indicating the protein is required within sensory nerves for them to fire or develop properly. Trpm7 likely influences mechanosensory neuron development or excitability, aligning with the GO process term **“thigmotaxis”** (movement in response to touch) and general **neurological processes** ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)). In summary, Trpm7 is needed for the neural circuitry that converts touch into locomotor escape in zebrafish.

- **Locomotor Activity and Swimming Behavior:** Zebrafish lacking Trpm7 show reduced motility and abnormal **swimming behavior**. Even beyond the touch-response defect, mutants often have sluggish or uncoordinated movement. This has been quantified as reduced free-swimming activity ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)). It reflects neuromuscular or developmental impairments caused by Trpm7 loss. For instance, Trpm7 deficiency leads to abnormalities in **dopaminergic neurons** in the brain, which in turn impairs motor pattern generation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=hydroxylase%2C%20the%20rate,this%20dependence%20requires%20further%20investigation)). Mutants have fewer or improperly differentiated dopamine-producing neurons in the diencephalon, resulting in a Parkinson’s disease-like bradykinetic phenotype (slow movement) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=hydroxylase%2C%20the%20rate,this%20dependence%20requires%20further%20investigation)). Treatment of these mutants with dopamine can partially restore movement, implicating Trpm7 in the development of dopaminergic neural circuits and thus normal locomotor behavior ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Here%20we%20report%20additional%20analyses,unrecognized%20genetic%20requirement%20for%20Trpm7)). GO terms such as **“locomotory behavior”** or **“swimming behavior”** are relevant to these phenotypes, and Trpm7 acts upstream of those behaviors by enabling proper neuron function and muscle control.

- **Exocrine Pancreas Development:** Trpm7 has been implicated in the development of the exocrine pancreas in zebrafish ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)). Mutant fish from certain genetic screens showed defects in the pancreas, suggesting Trpm7 is needed for normal pancreas morphogenesis or function. While the exact mechanism is not fully detailed in the literature, it may relate to Trpm7’s role in regulating cellular proliferation or differentiation in endodermal tissues. **Exocrine pancreas development** (GO term) is thus one of the biological processes Trpm7 influences, possibly through effects on the organ’s precursor cell survival or ion balance in developing pancreatic tissue ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)).

- **Magnesium/Calcium Homeostasis and Mineralization:** A key role of Trpm7 is governing **divalent cation homeostasis** at the organismal level. Zebrafish *trpm7* mutants have dysregulated Ca^2+ and Mg^2+ levels in bodily fluids, leading to **abnormal mineralization** of skeletal tissues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=homeostasis%20of%20divalent%20cations%20including,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)). Notably, mutants develop ectopic calcifications, such as **kidney stones and aberrant bone calcification**, due to improper calcium handling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=where%20it%20is%20highly%20expressed,2013)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Parkinson%E2%80%99s%20disease%20,shaped%20melanosomes%20and%20undergo%20cell)). Trpm7 is highly expressed in the zebrafish **Corpuscles of Stannius** – specialized endocrine glands in the kidney that secrete stanniocalcin to regulate calcium balance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=homeostasis%20of%20divalent%20cations%20including,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)). In *trpm7* mutants, stanniocalcin and other hormonal pathways (e.g. FGF23) are disrupted, explaining the hypermineralization phenotypes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=16,DOI)). These findings indicate Trpm7 is necessary for **ionic homeostasis** (GO:0072507, maintenance of divalent cation levels) and proper skeletal development. Ensuring correct Mg^2+ uptake through Trpm7 may also be critical for numerous Mg-dependent enzymes and signaling processes during development.

- **Cardiac Pacemaking (Heart Rate):** Loss of Trpm7 affects the cardiovascular system, particularly heart rhythm. Zebrafish *trpm7* mutants exhibit **bradycardia** (slower than normal heart rate) during larval stages ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=suggests%20a%20function%20for%20Trpm7,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)). This suggests Trpm7 is required for normal sinoatrial node function or cardiac muscle excitability. In support, mice with cardiac-specific Trpm7 deletion similarly show bradycardia and conduction block, highlighting a conserved role in pacemaker and cardiac action potential generation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=suggests%20a%20function%20for%20Trpm7,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)). In zebrafish, Trpm7 knockdown has been used as a model of **sinoatrial node dysfunction** ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Human%20Disease%20%20,26)). Trpm7 likely contributes to the background cation currents or calcium handling in pacemaker cells that drive rhythmic contractions. Thus, **heart rate regulation** and **cardiac muscle contraction** processes are linked to Trpm7 activity, and the gene is used to study arrhythmia-related phenotypes in zebrafish models ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Acts%20upstream%20of%20or%20within,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)) ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=sinoatrial%20node%20disease%20%20,26)).

- **Cell Survival and Development (General):** Because Trpm7 is ubiquitously required for cell viability (due to its role in Mg^2+ homeostasis and signaling), *trpm7* mutants have additional pleiotropic defects. They are generally growth-impaired (often developing a **dwarf** phenotype) and can have edema or other signs of developmental stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=16,DOI)). Trpm7’s absence triggers cell death in certain lineages (melanophores, as mentioned, and possibly others under stress conditions). On the other hand, a partial reduction of TRPM7 activity in some contexts can be beneficial – for example, reduced TRPM7 activity in mammalian neurons lessens cell death after ischemic stroke, suggesting TRPM7 contributes to Ca^2+-overload toxicity in neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Supporting%20this%20model%2C%20reduction%20of,type%20dependent)). In zebrafish, however, complete loss leads to specific developmental failures rather than immediate widespread cell death. Trpm7’s roles are **context-dependent**, affecting different cell types in distinct ways (neural, pigment, renal, cardiac, etc.), which underscores its involvement in numerous biological processes from **embryonic development** to adult physiology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Introduction)).

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The Trpm7 protein is large (zebrafish Trpm7 is ~1774 amino acids ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Protein%20%20,1774)), similar in size to its human ortholog) and contains several defined domains:

- **Ion Channel Domain:** The N-terminal two-thirds of Trpm7 forms the channel proper, including six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and a pore loop typical of TRP channels. This region (InterPro IPR005821) is the **ion transport domain** that assembles with three other subunits to create a cation-selective pore ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Domain%20%20,receptor%20potential%20cation%20channel%20M)). It belongs to the **TRPM subfamily of TRP channels** (melastatin-related TRP channels), which are characterized by conduction of divalent cations. The transmembrane domain mediates the voltage-dependent and ligand-regulated gating of the channel. Trpm7 channels are constitutively active but modulated by intracellular signals (like Mg^2+, as noted above).

- **SLOG Domain:** Adjacent to the transmembrane segments on the cytosolic side, TRPM7 contains a conserved region sometimes referred to as the **SLOG domain** (TRPM small linker domain). This domain (InterPro IPR041491) is unique to TRPM proteins and thought to participate in connecting the channel to the kinase domain ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Domain%20%20,TRPM%2C%20tetramerisation)). It may help sense intracellular ligands or allosterically regulate channel gating. In Trpm7, portions of this linker (including a **serine/threonine-proline-rich region, STP**) have regulatory phosphorylation sites and contribute to channel inhibition by Mg·ATP ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=drTRPM7%20is%20involved%20in%20the,concerned%20with%20sensing%20magnesium%20only)).

- **Coiled-Coil (CC) Tetramerization Domain:** Trpm7 has a coiled-coil region (InterPro IPR032415) near the C-terminus that is crucial for subunit oligomerization and channel assembly ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Domain%20%20,TRPM%2C%20tetramerisation)). This coiled-coil helps four Trpm7 subunits come together to form a functional channel complex (as part of the **tetramerization domain superfamily**) ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Family%20%20,TRPM%2C%20tetramerisation%20domain%20superfamily)). In zebrafish Trpm7, the coiled-coil domain has been shown to modulate the channel’s sensitivity to Mg·nucleotide inhibition – truncating or mutating this region alters how Mg^2+ and Mg-ATP regulate the channel ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=TRPM7%20inhibitor%20waixenicin%20A%20has,concerned%20with%20sensing%20magnesium%20only)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20using%20truncation%20mutations%2C%20we,concerned%20with%20sensing%20magnesium%20only)). Thus, the CC domain is not only structural but also influences channel gating kinetics.

- **α-Kinase Domain:** Uniquely, Trpm7 contains a **C-terminal protein kinase domain** of the alpha-kinase family (InterPro IPR004166 and IPR029601) ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Type%20%20,TRPM%2C%20SLOG%20domain)). Alpha-kinases are atypical serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate substrates within alpha-helical regions. Trpm7’s kinase domain is cytosolic and remains attached to the channel via the linker domains. It has catalytic activity (utilizing ATP to phosphorylate target proteins), though it is not a classical tyrosine kinase or AGC kinase – it is structurally distinct, belonging to the **protein kinase-like superfamily** but with a different substrate recognition motif ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Family%20%20,TRPM%2C%20tetramerisation%20domain%20superfamily)). In Trpm7, this kinase can autophosphorylate several of its own residues and has been reported to phosphorylate proteins such as annexin A1 and myosin IIA in mammalian studies (illustrating potential roles in cytoskeletal regulation and vesicle release). The exact physiological substrates in zebrafish are still under study. Importantly, mutations that render the kinase inactive do not necessarily phenocopy null mutations, indicating the **channel function** is the primary driver of many of Trpm7’s roles, while the kinase may have modulatory or cell-type-specific functions.

- **Linker regions:** In addition to these defined domains, Trpm7 has intrinsically disordered or flexible regions linking the domains, which often contain sites for phosphorylation and protein–protein interactions. For example, the **TRPM7 kinase is preceded by a long linker** that includes multiple serine/threonine residues; this region (sometimes called the STP segment) can be heavily phosphorylated and may regulate kinase accessibility or channel gating. These linker sequences can also serve as binding sites for molecules that modulate Trpm7 (like PIP_2 or protein partners).  

In summary, Trpm7’s protein structure comprises an N-terminal **channel module** (ion selectivity filter and gating machinery) and a C-terminal **enzyme module**, bridged by regulatory segments (SLOG, coiled-coil). This multi-domain architecture enables Trpm7 to act as a **signal integrator** – for instance, intracellular magnesium can bind the channel or kinase parts to feedback-regulate channel opening ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20using%20truncation%20mutations%2C%20we,concerned%20with%20sensing%20magnesium%20only)). All these domains are conserved in the zebrafish Trpm7 protein, which shares significant sequence and structural homology with mammalian TRPM7, ensuring that insights from zebrafish mutants are relevant across species.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
In zebrafish, *trpm7* is **widely expressed** during development and in adult tissues, consistent with its fundamental role in cellular physiology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Introduction)). Expression data indicate that *trpm7* transcripts and protein are present in many organ systems, including the **nervous system, integument (skin), eye, digestive organs, and renal system** ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Acts%20upstream%20of%20or%20within,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)). For example, Trpm7 mRNA is detected in the developing eye (retina), in the skin/fin tissues, and in the neural tube and brain regions of embryos. Notably, the **Corpuscles of Stannius** (renal gland) show high Trpm7 expression, aligning with its involvement in calcium balance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=homeostasis%20of%20divalent%20cations%20including,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)). In the nervous system, Trpm7 is expressed in regions that include sensory neurons and possibly catecholaminergic neurons, supporting its roles in touch response and dopaminergic neuron development. Expression is also observed in the **exocrine pancreas** and intestinal tract, providing a basis for the pancreas developmental phenotype when Trpm7 is lost ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)). 

During early embryogenesis, *trpm7* is likely maternally contributed (given the early lethal phenotype in other species when it’s absent, zebrafish maternal-zygotic mutants would be severely affected). Zebrafish with zygotic *trpm7* mutation develop to larval stages, suggesting that maternal Trpm7 RNA/protein may suffice through early cleavage stages, with zygotic expression required later (specific expression timing has been reported in some studies but generally picks up during organogenesis). As development proceeds, *trpm7* expression becomes enriched in certain tissues, such as pigment cells (melanophores) and the otic vesicle, as well as continuing broadly in the CNS and trunk. 

Regulation of *trpm7* expression at the transcriptional level is not fully characterized; it appears to be relatively constitutive in many cell types. However, some stimuli or conditions can modulate Trpm7 levels. For instance, in cell culture or mammalian systems, changes in magnesium availability can upregulate or downregulate TRPM7 expression post-transcriptionally, as the cell adjusts to ion demand. In zebrafish, hormones that control mineral homeostasis (like stanniocalcin and Fgf23) might indirectly affect Trpm7 activity or expression as part of feedback loops ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=match%20at%20L954%2017,0853.%20%5BDOI%5D%20%5BPMC%20free%20article)), but direct transcriptional regulation remains to be shown. Overall, the expression pattern of *trpm7* is broad and critical – its presence in diverse tissues matches the widespread defects seen in mutants, and underscores that Trpm7 is a **house-keeping gene** required in many contexts (reflected in the ubiquitous expression noted in both zebrafish and mammals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=))).

## Evolutionary Conservation  
Trpm7 is highly conserved across vertebrates and even more broadly across metazoans. The zebrafish *trpm7* gene is the clear **ortholog of human TRPM7**, sharing substantial sequence identity and all functional domains ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=expressed%20in%20several%20structures%2C%20including,channel%20subfamily%20M%20member%207)). Human TRPM7 and zebrafish Trpm7 proteins are very similar in structure (with the channel and kinase domains aligning closely) and share similar biophysical properties ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=lethality%20of%20transgenic%20ablations,coil%20domain%20of)). For example, electrophysiological studies demonstrate that zebrafish Trpm7 currents have properties akin to mammalian TRPM7 currents – both are divalent-selective, inward currents showing regulation by internal Mg^2+ ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=,Mg%29%20and)). This functional conservation means discoveries in one species are often applicable to the other. Zebrafish and mammals both have two *TRPM* “channel-kinase” genes, TRPM7 and the closely related TRPM6 (which likely arose from a gene duplication in early vertebrates). Zebrafish Trpm7 is more ubiquitously expressed and essential, while Trpm6 (in zebrafish and human) is more tissue-specific (kidney/intestine) for magnesium uptake; nonetheless, the channel structures are conserved. 

Not only is the protein sequence conserved, but the **biological roles** of Trpm7 show conservation. The requirement of Trpm7 for melanocyte (pigment cell) survival is observed in zebrafish, and correspondingly, mouse models with neural crest-specific Trpm7 deletion show melanocyte loss in fur (a pigment defect) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4197629/#:~:text=Cellular%20and%20Developmental%20Biology%20of,PMC)). Similarly, the role in **cardiac function** is conserved: zebrafish trpm7 mutants and mice with Trpm7 ablated in the heart both develop bradycardia, indicating the pacemaking role is ancient and retained ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=suggests%20a%20function%20for%20Trpm7,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)). The essential nature of Trpm7 is also conserved – complete knockout in mice leads to early embryonic lethality ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Transient%20receptor%20potential%20melastatin,Trpm7%20is%20essential%20for%20the)), and Xenopus frog embryos lacking Trpm7 die in gastrulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Transient%20receptor%20potential%20melastatin,Trpm7%20is%20essential%20for%20the)), whereas zebrafish can survive longer mainly due to maternal contribution rescuing early development. This cross-species comparison highlights that TRPM7 performs fundamental cellular tasks that have been maintained through evolution. Even in invertebrates, while true TRPM7 orthologs with kinase domains are not found in fruit flies or worms, related TRP channels (without kinases) and separate alpha-kinases exist, hinting that the combination in TRPM7 might have emerged in early chordates. 

At the genetic level, human *TRPM7* is located on chromosome 15 and mutations in it affect similar pathways (e.g., magnesium homeostasis) as zebrafish *trpm7* mutations do. The zebrafish gene is on chromosome 18 ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=protein_coding_gene%20Location%20Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)). Phylogenetic analysis groups zebrafish Trpm7 with other vertebrate TRPM7 proteins, distinct from the TRPM6 clade and other TRPM family members ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=sensitivity%20,rTRPM8%20not%20only%20is%20shorter)). Importantly, critical residues for channel function (the pore region glutamates, etc.) and kinase activity (the HRD motif of the kinase domain) are all conserved in zebrafish Trpm7. Thus, *Danio rerio* serves as an excellent model to study TRPM7, leveraging the evolutionary conservation to understand how this protein works in higher vertebrates, while the zebrafish’s relative genetic accessibility allows experimentation that would be lethal in mammals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=TRPM7%20is%20a%20member%20of,that%20the%20biophysical%20properties%20of)).

## Disease Associations and Model Phenotypes  
Trpm7’s broad physiological roles mean that its dysfunction is linked to various disease states or phenotypes, some of which are modeled in zebrafish:

- **Neurodegeneration (ALS/PD-like syndromes):** The human TRPM7 has been investigated as a susceptibility gene for a neurodegenerative condition known as ALS-Parkinsonism/Dementia complex (observed in certain Pacific populations). A specific **TRPM7 missense variant (Thr1482Ile)** was found in some patients with this syndrome; this variant channel showed heightened sensitivity to Mg^2+ inhibition and potentially could lead to magnesium imbalance in neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1183597/#:~:text=match%20at%20L87%20Here%2C%20we,2%2B%7D.%20We%20interpret)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1183597/#:~:text=match%20at%20L481%20direction,G)). It was proposed that in an environment low in magnesium and calcium (such as parts of Guam or the Kii Peninsula in Japan), individuals with this TRPM7 variant are at higher risk for neurodegeneration due to chronic subtle Mg^2+ deficiency in the CNS ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1183597/#:~:text=direction,G)). While later studies have debated the strength of this association, it underscores TRPM7’s possible role in **neurodegenerative disease**. In zebrafish, *trpm7* mutants show dopaminergic neuron loss and motor defects reminiscent of Parkinson’s disease, providing a **Parkinson’s model** for studying neuroprotective interventions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=hydroxylase%2C%20the%20rate,this%20dependence%20requires%20further%20investigation)). They are also hypersensitive to certain neurotoxins (e.g., MPP^+), linking Trpm7 to neuronal resilience against oxidative stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=hydroxylase%2C%20the%20rate,this%20dependence%20requires%20further%20investigation)). These findings suggest that TRPM7 activity is important for neuronal survival, and dysregulation can contribute to neurodegenerative processes.

- **Cardiac Arrhythmia:** As noted, Trpm7 deficiency causes bradycardia in zebrafish larvae ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=suggests%20a%20function%20for%20Trpm7,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)). Morpholino knockdown of *trpm7* was used to model **sinoatrial node dysfunction**, a cause of sick sinus syndrome (a human arrhythmia). Indeed, *trpm7* knockdown fish had arrhythmic heartbeat and were employed to study the mechanisms of pacemaker failure ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=sinoatrial%20node%20disease%20%20,2013)) ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Human%20Disease%20%20,26)). In mice, cardiomyocyte-specific Trpm7 deletion leads to conduction block and atrioventricular node dysfunction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=suggests%20a%20function%20for%20Trpm7,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)). Thus, TRPM7 has been implicated in **cardiac conduction disease**. Human studies have noted TRPM7’s involvement in cardiac fibrosis and ischemic heart disease as well ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=family,that%20the%20biophysical%20properties%20of)). Zebrafish provide a platform to screen for modulators of heart rate via Trpm7 and to understand how ion imbalances affect cardiac physiology, relevant to arrhythmia disorders.

- **Magnesium Deficiency Disorders:** TRPM7 is one of the main regulators of systemic magnesium balance. While mutations in the related channel TRPM6 are a known cause of familial hypomagnesemia in humans, TRPM7’s role has also been examined. No Mendelian disease caused by *TRPM7* mutations has been definitively identified, likely because complete loss is not compatible with life. However, TRPM7 has been suggested to contribute to **metabolic syndrome and diabetes** (where Mg^2+ handling is often impaired) and to **stroke injury** (excess TRPM7 activity during ischemia can lead to neuronal death). In zebrafish, the *trpm7* mutant (**“trpm7^b508”**, originally named *touchtone*) is an aphenotypic dwarf with mineralization defects, which has been used to study **kidney stone formation and skeletal dysplasias** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=16,DOI)). The mutant’s propensity to form kidney stones was linked to dysregulation of stanniocalcin and Fgf23, hormones that maintain mineral homeostasis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=16,DOI)). This makes zebrafish *trpm7* mutants a model for studying **kidney mineralization disorders** and **bone development diseases**, such as hyperostosis or mineral imbalance syndromes.

- **Cancer and Cell Proliferation:** Increased TRPM7 activity has been observed in certain cancers (e.g., breast, pancreatic, prostate cancers) and is thought to promote cancer cell survival, migration, and invasion. TRPM7’s kinase can affect actomyosin contractility, aiding metastasis in some contexts ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=TRPM7%20is%20a%20member%20of,that%20the%20biophysical%20properties%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=Although%20mammalian%20TRPM7%20is%20well,However%2C%20pharmacological%20profiling)). While this is mostly studied in human cell lines, zebrafish cancer models could potentially leverage *trpm7* knockdown/overexpression to see effects on tumor growth or metastasis. There is ongoing interest in TRPM7 as a therapeutic target in cancer and in fibrotic diseases. Zebrafish’s rapid development and transparent embryos make them suitable for in vivo drug screens targeting Trpm7 channel activity. For instance, compounds like waixenicin A are TRPM7 inhibitors; interestingly zebrafish Trpm7 was found to be **insensitive to waixenicin A** (unlike the mammalian channel) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5024298/#:~:text=Here%2C%20we%20investigate%20the%20regulation,that%20drTRPM7%20has%20two%20protein)), which provides insights into species differences in drug response.

In summary, *Danio rerio* *trpm7* mutants and knockdowns recapitulate aspects of human disease phenotypes – from neurodegeneration to heart arrhythmia to mineral imbalance – making this gene and its pathways of high biomedical relevance. The **Gene Ontology (GO)** annotations for disease modeling are not direct, but the phenotypic outcomes correspond to GO processes like “neuron death,” “heart contraction,” and “bone mineralization.” The broad impact of Trpm7 on cellular health means that any condition involving ion imbalance or stress signaling could be linked to TRPM7 dysfunction.

## Gene Ontology Annotations for *trpm7*  
Based on the above evidence, the zebrafish *trpm7* gene can be annotated with several key Gene Ontology terms (supported by experimental findings):

- **Molecular Function (MF):**  
  - *Calcium channel activity* **(GO:0005262)** – Trpm7 forms a ion channel that mediates Ca^2+ influx ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,channel%20subfamily%20M%20member%207)).

  - *(Additional inferred functions:* Trpm7 also binds metal ions and ATP, and has voltage-gated cation channel activity, though these are inherent to its channel function.)

- **Biological Process (BP):**  
  - *Divalent inorganic cation homeostasis* **(GO:0072507)** – Trpm7 regulates Mg^2+ and Ca^2+ levels in cells and whole organism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=homeostasis%20of%20divalent%20cations%20including,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)).  
  - *Melanophore (pigment cell) development* – required for melanophore survival and pigment formation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=et%20al,Additionally)) (related GO term: *pigment cell differentiation*, **GO:0050931**).  
  - *Neurological process (touch-evoked startle response)* – necessary for touch-induced escape behavior ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=intermediates%20of%20melanin%20synthesis%20into,and%20magnesium%20is%20abnormal%20in)) (related GO: *response to touch stimulus*, **GO:0050974**, and *locomotory behavior*, **GO:0007626**).  
  - *Exocrine pancreas development* **(GO:0031016)** – contributes to pancreas organogenesis ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)).  
  - *Regulation of heart rate* **(GO:0002027)** – involved in controlling cardiac pacemaker activity and heart contraction rhythm ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=suggests%20a%20function%20for%20Trpm7,larvae%20has%20complemented%20mammalian%20studies)).  
  - *Skeletal system development* **(GO:0001501)** – affects bone mineralization and development (via calcium homeostasis) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=16,DOI)).  
  - *Dopaminergic neuron differentiation* **(GO:0048663)** – influences the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons, as seen in zebrafish Parkinson-like phenotypes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=hydroxylase%2C%20the%20rate,this%20dependence%20requires%20further%20investigation)).  
  - *Cellular response to oxidative stress* **(GO:0034599)** – Trpm7 mutants’ sensitivity to neurotoxins suggests a role in how cells handle oxidative stress (Trpm7 channel activity might affect oxidative stress pathways) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=hydroxylase%2C%20the%20rate,this%20dependence%20requires%20further%20investigation)).  

- **Cellular Component (CC):**  
  - *Plasma membrane* **(GO:0005886)** – Trpm7 is an integral component of the plasma membrane, where it conducts ions ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Acts%20upstream%20of%20or%20within,channel%20subfamily%20M%20member%207)).  
  - *Integral component of membrane* **(GO:0016021)** – it spans the membrane with multiple transmembrane domains (this is a general annotation for multi-pass membrane proteins).  
  - *Cell body and neurite* – in neurons, Trpm7 is located on the soma and axons of sensory cells (related GO: *neuron projection*, **GO:0043005**), consistent with its role in neuronal excitability.  
  - *(Note:* The kinase portion is cytosolic, but since it’s part of the same protein, GO still places TRPM7 in the membrane-bound category. There is evidence some TRPM7 may reside in intracellular vesicular membranes, but primary localization is the plasma membrane.)

Each of these GO annotations is supported by experimental observations in zebrafish or orthologous systems. For instance, calcium channel activity is evidenced by TRPM7 currents measured in electrophysiology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=Introduction)), and the plasma membrane localization is confirmed by cellular fractionation and imaging ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,channel%20subfamily%20M%20member%207)). The involvement in pancreas development, touch response, and swimming behavior comes from mutant phenotype analyses in zebrafish ([zfin.org](https://zfin.org/ZDB-GENE-021115-2#:~:text=Chr%3A%2018%20Mapping%20Details%2FBrowsers%20Predicted,gene%20implicated%20in%20amyotrophic%20lateral)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3971878/#:~:text=intermediates%20of%20melanin%20synthesis%20into,and%20magnesium%20is%20abnormal%20in)). Collectively, these GO terms capture the multifaceted roles of Trpm7: it is a membrane **ion channel (MF)** and **kinase (MF)** that resides in the **plasma membrane (CC)** and participates in critical **biological processes (BP)** ranging from ion homeostasis and developmental pathways to sensory behavior and heart rhythm regulation.
