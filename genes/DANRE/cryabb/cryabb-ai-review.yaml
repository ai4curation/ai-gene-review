description: >-
  Zebrafish alpha-crystallin B chain b (cryabb, also known as cryab2 or
  alphaB2-crystallin) is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP/HSP20) family.
  It is one of two zebrafish alphaB-crystallin paralogs arising from the teleost
  whole-genome duplication. Unlike cryaba which became lens-specific, cryabb retains
  the broad expression pattern of its mammalian ortholog CRYAB, with constitutive
  expression in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, liver, and lens (PMID:16420472). cryabb
  has greater chaperone-like activity than human CRYAB at 25-30 degrees C, while human
  CRYAB provides greater protection at 35-40 degrees C (PMID:16420472). cryabb
  maintained the widespread protective role found in mammalian CRYAB after gene
  duplication, while cryaba adopted a more restricted lens role (PMID:16420472).
  Morpholino knockdown of cryabb causes skeletal muscle defects, myofibril
  disassembly, heart failure, and locomotory impairment in zebrafish embryos
  (PMID:25866181). Loss of cryabb also contributes to maintenance of lens transparency
  (PMID:38705506), though its primary role appears to be in muscle and stress
  protection rather than lens structure. The protein belongs to the sHSP/HSP20 family
  with an alpha-crystallin domain and an N-terminal crystallin domain. UniProt
  annotates it with keywords for eye lens protein, metal-binding, and zinc.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from mammalian alpha-crystallins
      (CRYAA, CRYAB, HSPB1) which have documented anti-apoptotic roles. cryabb
      retains the broad expression pattern and protective functions of mammalian
      CRYAB (PMID:16420472), making this inference more applicable than for the
      lens-specific cryaba paralog. However, anti-apoptosis is a downstream
      biological process rather than a core molecular function.

    reason: >-
      Anti-apoptotic activity is a recognized function of the sHSP family and is
      more relevant for cryabb than cryaba given that cryabb retained the widespread
      protective role of mammalian CRYAB (PMID:16420472). However, this represents
      a downstream biological process rather than a core molecular function. Retained

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for protein refolding, inferred primarily from Drosophila sHSP
      orthologs. Alpha-crystallins function as holdases rather than foldases -- they
      prevent aggregation of denaturing proteins but do not actively refold them.
      cryabb has robust chaperone-like (holdase) activity at physiological
      temperatures (PMID:16420472). The protein refolding term is inaccurate for
      a holdase.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      Alpha-crystallins are holdase chaperones that prevent aggregation of unfolded
      proteins but do not catalyze refolding. GO:0042026 implies active refolding
      activity, which is inaccurate for cryabb. GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier
