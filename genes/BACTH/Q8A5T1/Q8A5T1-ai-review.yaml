  id: NCBITaxon:226186
  label: Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482
description: "BT2157 is a 3-keto-disaccharide hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.218) that preferentially hydrolyzes 3-dehydro-alpha,alpha-trehalose to produce 3-dehydro-D-glucose and D-glucose. This membrane-anchored glycosidase plays a crucial role in disaccharide utilization in the human gut microbiome and is essential for converting dietary glucosinolates to bioactive isothiocyanates. The enzyme is induced during growth on trehalose and represents an important component of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron's extensive carbohydrate metabolism machinery. Crystal structures reveal detailed mechanisms of substrate recognition and catalysis."
