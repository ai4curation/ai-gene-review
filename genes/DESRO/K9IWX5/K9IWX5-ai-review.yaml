    review:
      summary: Extracellular region is inferred from InterPro, but UniProt 
        cautions missing conserved residues for annotation propagation.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: No direct evidence for extracellular localization of this 
        CRISP-like protein in DESRO; UniProt cautions against feature 
        propagation.
