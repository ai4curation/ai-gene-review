# K9IWX5 Research Notes

## Key findings
- UniProt describes this protein as a putative scp crisp extracellular protein [file:DESRO/K9IWX5/K9IWX5-uniprot.txt "SubName: Full=Putative scp crisp: scp-like extracellular protein"].
- UniProt assigns this protein to the CRISP family [file:DESRO/K9IWX5/K9IWX5-uniprot.txt "Belongs to the CRISP family."].
- Deep research identifies K9IWX5 as a CRISP-like extracellular protein from vampire bat [file:DESRO/K9IWX5/K9IWX5-deep-research-falcon.md "K9IWX5 is a UniProt accession (not a gene symbol) that encodes a putative CRISP-like extracellular protein from Desmodus rotundus (common vampire bat)."].
- UniProt cautions that conserved residues required for feature propagation are missing [file:DESRO/K9IWX5/K9IWX5-uniprot.txt "CAUTION: Lacks conserved residue(s) required for the propagation of"].
