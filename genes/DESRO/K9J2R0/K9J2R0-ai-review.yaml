    review:
      summary: Aminopeptidase activity is a broad parent term; 
        dipeptidyl-peptidase activity is the specific function.

    review:
      summary: Serine-type endopeptidase activity is too general; the specific 
        dipeptidyl-peptidase activity is appropriate.
      action: MODIFY

    review:
      summary: Extracellular region is a broad parent term; secretion is noted 
        but main localization is membrane.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: Prefer membrane/apical membrane localization; use extracellular 
        space only if secretion is supported separately.
