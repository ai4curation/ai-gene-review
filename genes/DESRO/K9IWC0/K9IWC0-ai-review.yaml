    review:
      summary: Natriuretic peptide signaling stimulates cGMP production via 
        NPR1.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: UniProt describes binding and stimulating NPR1 to produce cGMP.

      label: receptor guanylyl cyclase signaling pathway
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
    review:
      summary: Natriuretic peptide signaling via receptor guanylyl cyclase is 
        supported by UniProt functional description.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: UniProt describes NPR1-mediated signaling with cGMP production.

      label: hormone activity
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
    review:
      summary: Natriuretic peptides are hormones; UniProt annotates hormone 
        function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: UniProt describes this protein as a cardiac hormone.

      label: extracellular region
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
    review:
      summary: Extracellular region is a broad parent term; extracellular space 
        is more specific for a secreted hormone.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: UniProt indicates secretion; use extracellular space for 
        specificity.

      label: blood vessel diameter maintenance
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
    review:
      summary: Blood vessel diameter maintenance is a specific physiological 
        outcome inferred from natriuretic peptide signaling.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: No direct evidence for this specific process in DESRO; inference 
        is broader than supported.
