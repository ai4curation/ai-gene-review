## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9IWC0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Natriuretic peptides B {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00020075}; AltName: Full=Brain natriuretic factor prohormone {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00031802}; AltName: Full=Gamma-brain natriuretic peptide {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00032322}; AltName: Full=Iso-ANP {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00032369};
- **Gene Information:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the natriuretic peptide family.
- **Key Domains:** Natr_peptide. (IPR000663); Natr_peptide_CS. (IPR030480); Natriuretic_peptide_brain. (IPR002408); ANP (PF00212)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "K9IWC0" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'K9IWC0' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **K9IWC0** (gene ID: K9IWC0, UniProt: K9IWC0) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status update and target verification
- Identity confirmed: UniProt K9IWC0 corresponds to a natriuretic peptide B precursor (BNP prohormone) annotated in Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat), belonging to the natriuretic peptide family with the conserved natriuretic peptide domain (IPR000663; PF00212). BNP/NPPB biology in mammals is well defined; therefore, functional annotation for K9IWC0 can be inferred from conserved domain/family knowledge and cross-mammalian literature. No conflicting gene symbol usage was identified. Species-specific, peer‑reviewed primary literature for BNP/NPPB in Desmodus rotundus was not found in our curated 2023–2024 evidence set; conclusions for this bat protein are thus based on conserved features of the natriuretic peptide family in mammals, which are highly conserved and well reviewed (see citations). Where bat-specific data are unavailable, this report explicitly infers function from family/domain conservation. (giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7, corte2023thenatriureticpeptide pages 2-4, giovou2024theimpactof pages 19-20)

Comprehensive research report: K9IWC0 (NPPB/BNP precursor) in Desmodus rotundus

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Gene/protein identity and family: NPPB encodes the B‑type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a cardiac endocrine hormone of the natriuretic peptide family (ANP/BNP/CNP), acting via particulate guanylyl cyclase receptors. BNP contains the hallmark 17‑residue disulfide-bonded ring within the natriuretic peptide domain responsible for receptor recognition. The K9IWC0 protein is the preprohormone (preproBNP) for BNP in vampire bat, sharing this conserved architecture. (Review synthesis) (corte2023thenatriureticpeptide pages 2-4, giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7)
- Biosynthesis and processing: NPPB is translated as preproBNP (human canonical numbers: 134 aa), with an N‑terminal signal peptide removed to generate proBNP. ProBNP undergoes O‑glycosylation at sites near the convertase cleavage region, a modification that can modulate subsequent proteolysis. Endoproteolytic processing by the proprotein convertases corin and/or furin yields two principal products: the bioactive BNP1‑32 (humans) and the inactive N‑terminal fragment NT‑proBNP1‑76. Variable O‑glycosylation influences both physiological bioactivity and immunoassay detectability. (corte2023thenatriureticpeptide pages 2-4, giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7, nyberg2023astateof pages 2-3)
- Receptors and signaling: BNP binds primarily to NPR1 (also GC‑A), a membrane guanylyl cyclase. Ligand binding stimulates intracellular cGMP generation, which activates downstream effectors including protein kinase G (PKG), selected phosphodiesterases, and cGMP-gated ion channels, producing vasorelaxation and anti‑remodeling effects. NPR2 (GC‑B) is the cognate receptor for CNP but can contribute to cGMP signaling in some contexts; NPR3 (clearance receptor) mediates endocytosis/lysosomal degradation and can also signal via Gi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. (gallo2023natriureticpeptidesit pages 4-5, giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7)
- Core physiological actions: Through NPR1-cGMP-PKG, BNP promotes natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, suppression of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone signaling, and anti‑hypertrophic/anti‑fibrotic actions in the heart. BNP’s relatively longer circulating half‑life versus ANP contributes to its biomarker utility. (gallo2023natriureticpeptidesit pages 1-2, giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7)
- Localization: BNP is a secreted hormone produced by cardiomyocytes; under basal conditions, ANP/BNP are predominantly atrial, but with ventricular stress or disease, ventricular NPPB expression is strongly induced. (nyberg2023astateof pages 1-2, giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- NPR1 agonist antibody (REGN5381; translational advance): A 2024 Nature study reported a human genetic analysis linking NPR1 coding variants with blood pressure and heart-failure risk, then developed REGN5381, an allosteric agonist monoclonal antibody to NPR1. REGN5381 induces an active-like conformation and preferentially reduces venous pressures in animals; in healthy volunteers, it lowered venous pressures without clear natriuresis/diuresis, supporting a strategy for sustained venous decongestion. The paper also reiterates that ANP/BNP are activated by corin/furin and reports approximate circulating half-lives (ANP ~30 s; BNP ~6.4 min) in the experimental framework. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07903-1 (published 11 Sep 2024). (dunn2024agonistantibodyto pages 1-2)
- NPR3 (clearance receptor) as disease modifier: In a 2023 Science Advances study, genetic deletion of NPRC (NPR3) in diabetic mice attenuated cardiac fibrosis and improved remodeling/function, mechanistically linked to activation of PKA/PKG and inhibition of TGF‑β1/Smad signaling (via upregulation of TGIF1). These findings highlight therapeutic potential in modulating NP clearance/signaling balance. While this model focuses on diabetic cardiomyopathy, the mechanism is broadly relevant to BNP biology. (Full data summarized in our evidence context from the paper search; mechanistic conclusions tied here via review context.) (gallo2023natriureticpeptidesit pages 4-5)
- State of “natriuretic peptide deficiency”: An Endocrine Reviews 2023 perspective synthesizes evidence that many individuals exhibit partial NP deficiency—lower circulating NPs and/or reduced effective receptor-level bioactivity—particularly in obesity and type 2 diabetes. The review emphasizes the regulatory role of heterogeneous O‑glycosylation in propeptide maturation and assay interpretation, with implications for both diagnostics and pathophysiology. URL: https://doi.org/10.1210/endrev/bnac029 (published 13 Nov 2023). (nyberg2023astateof pages 1-1, nyberg2023astateof pages 1-2, nyberg2023astateof pages 2-3)
- Mechanistic consolidation (2023 review): Recent reviews underscore that impaired processing (reduced corin/furin activity or increased proBNP O‑glycosylation), increased PDE activity that lowers cGMP, and increased NPR3 clearance can all contribute to NP resistance, providing multiple intervention points. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24065131 (published 7 Mar 2023). (gallo2023natriureticpeptidesit pages 4-5, gallo2023natriureticpeptidesit pages 1-2)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarkers in heart failure and cardiometabolic risk: BNP and NT‑proBNP are standard-of-care biomarkers for diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of heart failure; their use is embedded in clinical practice guidelines. Reviews detail their utility across acute and chronic HF and related conditions, with interpretation modulated by age, renal function, atrial fibrillation (AF), and metabolic status. (gallo2023natriureticpeptidesit pages 1-2, nyberg2023astateof pages 1-2)
- Diagnostic performance in AF and community settings: A large primary-care diagnostic accuracy study (PLOS Medicine, 2025; leveraging 2004–2018 records) found NT‑proBNP discriminated HF more accurately in people without AF (AUC 0.877) than with AF (AUC 0.743). In AF, sensitivity/specificity at 125 pg/mL were 98.8%/13.2%, and at 400 pg/mL were 93.2%/35.5%; in non‑AF, 125 pg/mL yielded 92.9%/53.8%, and 400 pg/mL 77.1%/84.9%. Raising AF thresholds (e.g., to 660 pg/mL) reduced false positives by ~26% but at the cost of more missed cases (−NPV trade‑off). These real-world data inform threshold adjustments and guideline discussions. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004550 (published 30 Oct 2025). (jones2025ntprobnptestingfor pages 1-2)
- Translational NPR1 agonism: REGN5381 exemplifies ongoing drug development to harness NPR1 signaling for hemodynamic benefit with potentially longer duration than native peptide infusions, which have been limited by short half‑lives. (dunn2024agonistantibodyto pages 1-2)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Systems/physiology perspective: Comprehensive reviews emphasize BNP’s central role in cardio‑renal homeostasis via NPR1‑cGMP‑PKG signaling, leading to natriuresis/vasodilation and anti‑remodeling effects. They also detail the complexity of NP maturation (O‑glycosylation), variable propeptide release under stress, receptor distribution, and clearance pathways (NPR3 and proteolytic degradation), all of which shape biomarker interpretation and therapeutic strategies.

- Genetic and pharmacologic insights: The Nature 2024 NPR1 study links human genetics to physiology and therapeutic design, bolstering NPR1 as a validated target; it also situates NP therapeutics (e.g., prior nesiritide/carperitide) within a framework where receptor-selective, long-acting agents may offer clinical advantages. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07903-1. (dunn2024agonistantibodyto pages 1-2)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Diagnostic accuracy (primary care; AF vs non‑AF): NT‑proBNP AUC and threshold performance as above: AUC 0.877 (non‑AF) vs 0.743 (AF). Sensitivity/specificity at 125 pg/mL: 92.9%/53.8% (non‑AF) and 98.8%/13.2% (AF). At 400 pg/mL: 77.1%/84.9% (non‑AF) and 93.2%/35.5% (AF). Adjusting AF threshold to 660 pg/mL reduced false positives by 26.0% at the cost of more missed diagnoses; retained NPV ~91.5%. (PLOS Med 2025). URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004550. (jones2025ntprobnptestingfor pages 1-2)
- Genetic effect sizes for NPR1 variants (Nature 2024): Example associations include NPR1 protein-truncating variants with +1.85 mmHg systolic BP (95% CI 0.57–3.14), and a common LOF missense (p.Glu967Lys) with +1.13 mmHg (95% CI 0.92–1.33). A GOF missense (p.Gly541Ser) associated with −0.95 mmHg (95% CI −1.39 to −0.51). Early-phase human data for REGN5381 demonstrated expected venous haemodynamic changes in healthy volunteers. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07903-1. (dunn2024agonistantibodyto pages 1-2)

Functional annotation for K9IWC0 (inferred for Desmodus rotundus)
- Molecular function: Secreted peptide hormone that activates NPR1 (GC‑A) to stimulate cGMP production and PKG signaling, mediating natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and anti‑fibrotic/anti‑hypertrophic actions. The disulfide‑bonded ring in the natriuretic peptide domain mediates receptor binding. (gallo2023natriureticpeptidesit pages 4-5, giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7)
- Biological process: Cardio‑renal homeostasis; counter‑regulation of volume/pressure overload; inhibition of RAAS; suppression of fibrosis/hypertrophy signaling programs in the myocardium. Under stress, ventricular expression is induced. (gallo2023natriureticpeptidesit pages 1-2, nyberg2023astateof pages 1-2)
- Cellular component/localization: Secreted from cardiomyocytes; prohormone processed by corin/furin; cleared by NPR3 and proteolysis. (corte2023thenatriureticpeptide pages 2-4, nyberg2023astateof pages 2-3)

Notes on species-specific evidence
- Bats/Desmodus rotundus: We did not identify recent (2023–2024) primary studies directly characterizing NPPB/BNP in Desmodus rotundus. Given the strong conservation of the natriuretic peptide domain and processing/signaling machinery across mammals, the above functions and pathways are expected to hold for K9IWC0. Future work could assess sequence-specific O‑glycosylation motifs and convertase sites to refine processing predictions. (giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7)

Limitations and open questions
- Diagnostic thresholds are sensitive to comorbidities (age, AF, renal function, obesity). While guidelines recommend specific cut-offs, threshold optimization (e.g., AF-specific higher cut-offs) trades sensitivity for specificity; implementation should reflect healthcare system priorities and patient mix. Real-world primary care data support such adjustments. (jones2025ntprobnptestingfor pages 1-2)
- Mechanisms of NP deficiency include variable O‑glycosylation and receptor-level bioactivity variation; better biomarkers capturing active vs inactive forms may improve precision diagnostics. (nyberg2023astateof pages 1-1, nyberg2023astateof pages 2-3)
- Translational targeting of processing (corin/furin) and receptor signaling (NPR1 agonists; NPR3 modulation) is promising but requires further clinical validation. (dunn2024agonistantibodyto pages 1-2, gallo2023natriureticpeptidesit pages 4-5)

Acceptance of mandatory verification steps
1) “K9IWC0” is a UniProt accession (not a symbol) mapped here to natriuretic peptide B precursor; description matches natriuretic peptide family. (giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7)
2) Organism verification: Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) specified in the prompt; no conflict was found. (giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7)
3) Protein family/domain alignment: Matches natriuretic peptide family with conserved ring/disulfide and natriuretic peptide domain annotations; signaling via NPR1 is conserved. (corte2023thenatriureticpeptide pages 2-4, giovou2024theimpactof pages 5-7)
4) Ambiguity check: No literature using “K9IWC0” as a gene symbol was used; function is inferred from UniProt entry and conserved BNP/NPPB biology.

Conclusion
K9IWC0 in Desmodus rotundus encodes the BNP precursor whose conserved natriuretic peptide domain, maturation by corin/furin, NPR1‑mediated cGMP signaling, and cardio‑renal endocrine functions are well characterized across mammals. 2023–2024 work refined clinical interpretation (e.g., AF‑specific diagnostic performance), highlighted the concept of NP deficiency and post‑translational maturation (O‑glycosylation), and introduced NPR1 agonist antibody therapy (REGN5381) as a new translational avenue. Species‑specific experimental data in vampire bat remain to be defined, but the strong evolutionary conservation supports these annotations for K9IWC0.
