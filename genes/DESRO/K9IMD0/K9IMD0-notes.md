# K9IMD0 (Draculin) Research Notes

## Key findings
- Draculin is an anticoagulant protein isolated from vampire bat saliva [PMID:7740503 "anticoagulant protein which we have named draculin."].
- Draculin inhibits activated coagulation factors IX and X [PMID:7740503 "Draculin inhibits the activated form of coagulation factors IX and X."].
- Draculin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of activated factor X [PMID:10556567 "noncompetitive inhibitor of activated factor X."].
- Draculin is a glycoprotein isolated from vampire bat saliva and acts as a natural anticoagulant [PMID:9795244 "Draculin, a glycoprotein isolated from vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) saliva,"; PMID:9795244 "is a natural anticoagulant which inhibits activated coagulation factors IX (IXa)"].
- Draculin activity depends on glycosylation of the native molecule [PMID:9795244 "Expression of biological activity of draculin, the anticoagulant factor from vampire bat saliva, is strictly dependent on the appropriate glycosylation of the native molecule."].
- Proteomic/transcriptomic analysis recovered a large sequence stretch of draculin and linked it to lactotransferrin [PMID:23748026 "obtained a very large sequence stretch of draculin"; PMID:23748026 "and thus established that it is a mutated version of the lactotransferrin"].
