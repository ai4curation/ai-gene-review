# K9IUF6 Research Notes

## Key findings
- UniProt names this protein A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 [file:DESRO/K9IUF6/K9IUF6-uniprot.txt "RecName: Full=A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1"].
- UniProt indicates a secreted extracellular localization [file:DESRO/K9IUF6/K9IUF6-uniprot.txt "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted, extracellular space, extracellular"].
- Deep research describes ADAMTS1 as a secreted zinc-dependent metalloprotease with thrombospondin repeats [file:DESRO/K9IUF6/K9IUF6-deep-research-falcon.md "ADAMTS1 is a secreted zinc-dependent metalloprotease of the ADAMTS family, comprising an N-terminal signal peptide and propeptide, a catalytic metalloproteinase domain with the HEXXH motif, a disintegrin-like domain, and an ancillary region with thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSR), cysteine-rich, and spacer domains that direct ECM binding and substrate recognition."].
- UniProt cautions that conserved residues required for feature propagation are missing [file:DESRO/K9IUF6/K9IUF6-uniprot.txt "CAUTION: Lacks conserved residue(s) required for the propagation of"].
