    review:
      summary: Metalloendopeptidase activity is inferred but UniProt cautions 
        missing conserved residues for annotation propagation.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: Catalytic activity may not be conserved; no direct evidence in 
        DESRO.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
    review:
      summary: Proteolysis is inferred from keywords but catalytic activity is 
        uncertain due to UniProt caution.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: No direct evidence for proteolysis in this DESRO fragment; UniProt
        cautions about conserved residues.

      summary: Integrin-mediated signaling pathway is a keyword-based inference 
        without direct evidence.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED

    review:
      summary: Heparin binding is inferred from keywords and lacks direct 
        evidence in DESRO.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: No experimental evidence for heparin binding in this protein.

        uncertain due to UniProt caution.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: No direct evidence for peptidase activity in DESRO; UniProt 
        cautions missing residues.

    review:
      summary: Zinc ion binding is predicted for ADAMTS proteins but UniProt 
        cautions missing conserved residues.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: Binding predictions are uncertain given the caution about 
        conserved residues.

    review:
      summary: Hydrolase activity is too general and unsupported without 
        confirmed catalytic activity.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: No direct evidence for hydrolase activity; UniProt cautions 
        missing residues.

      summary: Metal ion binding is broad; zinc ion binding is the specific 
        predicted interaction for ADAMTS family.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: Use zinc ion binding as the specific metal binding term, noting 
        uncertainty due to caution.
