## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9IUF6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00072810}; Flags: Fragment;
- **Gene Information:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** ADAM_Cys-rich. (IPR006586); ADAMTS/ADAMTS-like. (IPR013273); ADAMTS_ADAMTS-like. (IPR050439); ADAMTS_CR_2. (IPR041645); ADAMTS_CR_3. (IPR045371)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "K9IUF6" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'K9IUF6' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **K9IUF6** (gene ID: K9IUF6, UniProt: K9IUF6) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan
We verified K9IUF6 identity and organism, gathered 2023–2024 ADAMTS1 literature on function, substrates, localization, processing, regulation, and disease relevance, checked for Desmodus rotundus data, and synthesized a comprehensive report. All major claims are supported by citations.

Comprehensive research report: K9IUF6 (Desmodus rotundus) — ADAMTS1-like protease fragment

Identity verification and ambiguity note
- K9IUF6 is a UniProt accession (not a gene symbol) annotated as “A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1; fragment” from Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat). InterPro domains include ADAM_Cys-rich and ADAMTS/ADAMTS-like motifs, consistent with ADAMTS1 family architecture. Literature on an ortholog in D. rotundus is scarce; therefore, function is inferred from conserved domains and mammalian ADAMTS1 literature. (Identity and inference statement; no publication URL; see species evidence below.)

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Family and structure: ADAMTS1 is a secreted zinc-dependent metalloprotease of the ADAMTS family, comprising an N-terminal signal peptide and propeptide, a catalytic metalloproteinase domain with the HEXXH motif, a disintegrin-like domain, and an ancillary region with thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSR), cysteine-rich, and spacer domains that direct ECM binding and substrate recognition. It belongs to the “proteoglycanase/hyalectanase” subgroup (with ADAMTS4/5/9/15/20). (garcia2024roleofthe pages 69-73, santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 1-2)
- Zymogen activation and processing: ADAMTS1 is synthesized as a proenzyme and activated by propeptide removal via furin in the trans-Golgi network; further proteolysis of its ancillary region yields forms with altered diffusion and ECM association. (garcia2024roleofthe pages 73-76, garcia2024roleofthe pages 69-73)
- Canonical substrates: Versican (VCAN) and aggrecan (ACAN) are established substrates; cleavage of hyalectans remodels pericellular/ECM structure and signaling. Additional reported substrates or interacting partners include syndecan-4, semaphorin 3C, tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2, thrombospondins (releasing anti-angiogenic fragments), and IGFBP2 in specific contexts. (santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 14-15, santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 1-2)
- Functional roles: ECM remodeling, regulation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, morphogenesis (heart valves and cushions), fertility/ovarian ovulation programs, and context-dependent roles in cancer invasion/metastasis. (santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 1-2, santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 14-15)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- EGFR-linked invasion axes in cancer:
  • Oral squamous cell carcinoma: A 2024 study identifies a cyclic ADAMTS1–L1CAM–EGFR axis that promotes EMT, invasion, tumor growth, and cervical lymph node metastasis in xenografts; apigenin suppresses this axis and reduces invasion/metastasis. Mechanistically, ADAMTS1 upregulation enhances L1CAM/EGFR signaling and downstream p-AKT/STAT3, providing actionable therapeutic insights. Cell Death & Disease, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06452-9. (chien2024cyclicincreasein pages 1-2, chien2024cyclicincreasein pages 3-6)
  • Renal cell carcinoma: A 2024 study shows an oncogenic ADAMTS1–VCAN–EGFR cyclic axis driving anoikis resistance and invasion; enzymatically active ADAMTS1 cleaves versican V1 to induce EGFR transactivation, and ADAMTS1 correlates with poor prognosis in RCC cohorts. Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00643-0. (martin2025characterizationofadamts9 pages 21-21)
- Pathological tissue remodeling and vasculature (review updates): A 2023 review synthesizes ADAM/ADAMTS roles in pathological tissue remodeling across cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease, noting ADAMTS1 proteoglycanase activity on versican/aggrecan and its dual roles depending on tissue context. Cell Death Discovery, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01744-z. (martin2025characterizationofadamts9 pages 21-21)
- Thoracic aortic disease: A 2023 review highlights ADAMTS proteoglycanases (including ADAMTS1) as regulators of proteoglycan turnover in the aortic media, with implications for thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection diagnostics and pathogenesis. IJMS, Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241512135. (kemberi2023theroleof pages 1-3)

3) Primary function, substrates, specificity, and localization
- Enzymatic function: Secreted ECM protease that cleaves hyalectans. Versican cleavage by ADAMTS1 is a hallmark; ADAMTS1 also processes aggrecan. Proteolysis modifies matrix porosity, viscoelasticity, and presentation of growth factor-binding domains. (santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 1-2, santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 14-15)
- Specificity determinants: C-terminal ancillary domains contain exosites that position hyalectan substrates for cleavage; proteolytic trimming of these domains modulates substrate access and localization. Although specific 2023 structural studies are referenced in cross-citations, the available gathered evidence emphasizes the exosite concept and processed forms influencing activity. (martin2025characterizationofadamts9 pages 21-21)
- Subcellular and extracellular localization: After furin activation in the trans-Golgi, ADAMTS1 is secreted to the extracellular milieu and pericellular ECM, often tethered via interactions with glycosaminoglycans; further processing can release more diffusible forms. Rare nuclear detection has been reported in cancer cells, but the functional significance remains unclear. (garcia2024roleofthe pages 73-76, garcia2024roleofthe pages 69-73)

4) Pathways and processes (mechanistic roles)
- ECM and growth factor signaling: By cleaving versican/aggrecan, ADAMTS1 alters ECM mechanics and releases or exposes motifs that modulate cell adhesion, migration, and growth factor receptor engagement (e.g., EGFR transactivation via versican cleavage in RCC). (martin2025characterizationofadamts9 pages 21-21)
- Angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis: ADAMTS1 regulates angiogenesis; multiple reports show antiangiogenic effects through thrombospondin fragment release and growth factor sequestering, while context-dependent proangiogenic/tumor-promoting roles are observed in some cancers. (santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 14-15)
- Cancer invasion and EMT: In OSCC, ADAMTS1 upregulation increases invasion and EMT via L1CAM–EGFR signaling; therapeutic suppression with apigenin reduces metastasis in vivo. (chien2024cyclicincreasein pages 1-2, chien2024cyclicincreasein pages 3-6)
- Cardiovascular matrix homeostasis: ADAMTS1 is implicated in arterial proteoglycan turnover and valve/cushion morphogenesis; dysregulation contributes to vascular disease phenotypes. (santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 1-2, kemberi2023theroleof pages 1-3)

5) Regulation
- Activation: Furin-mediated propeptide removal is required for catalytic activity; additional MMP-dependent trimming can modulate diffusibility. (garcia2024roleofthe pages 73-76)
- Inhibition and binding partners: TIMP-3 and TIMP-2 inhibit ADAMTS1; α2-macroglobulin can trap secreted proteases; heparin can prevent self-cleavage, stabilizing activity. (garcia2024roleofthe pages 73-76)
- Transcriptional/physiologic regulation: Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1), hormonal cues (LH/progesterone in ovarian contexts), and chromatin remodeling (e.g., BRG1 repression in endocardium) have been reported to regulate ADAMTS1 expression. (garcia2024roleofthe pages 73-76, santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 14-15)

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Oncology: Expression and functional axes (ADAMTS1–L1CAM–EGFR in OSCC; ADAMTS1–VCAN–EGFR in RCC) suggest biomarker potential and therapeutic targets. Small molecules such as apigenin were shown to downregulate the axis and reduce metastasis in xenografts (preclinical). (chien2024cyclicincreasein pages 1-2, chien2024cyclicincreasein pages 3-6, martin2025characterizationofadamts9 pages 21-21)
- Cardiovascular biomarkers: Reviews propose ADAMTS proteoglycanases (including ADAMTS1) and their cleavage products (e.g., versikine neo-epitopes) as candidate biomarkers for aortopathy and vascular remodeling, though clinical validation is ongoing. (kemberi2023theroleof pages 1-3)

7) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Authoritative reviews synthesize that ADAMTS1’s proteoglycanase activity underpins its pleiotropic effects, with context-dependent consequences in vascular biology and cancer. The 2023 Cell Death Discovery review and 2023 aortic disease review emphasize the need to delineate catalytic versus non-catalytic roles and to develop selective inhibitors/biomarkers. (martin2025characterizationofadamts9 pages 21-21, kemberi2023theroleof pages 1-3)

8) Quantitative data and recent statistics
- OSCC model: ADAMTS1 overexpression increased invasion and promoted cervical lymph node metastasis in orthotopic models; apigenin treatment significantly prolonged survival in xenografted mice while suppressing ADAMTS1–L1CAM–EGFR signaling. Specific quantitative hazard ratios and p-values are embedded in the 2024 article; see the primary report for detailed statistics. Cell Death & Disease, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06452-9. (chien2024cyclicincreasein pages 3-6)
- RCC datasets: Elevated ADAMTS1 transcripts correlate with poor prognosis in RCC; mechanistic assays demonstrate EGFR activation following versican cleavage. Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00643-0. (martin2025characterizationofadamts9 pages 21-21)

9) Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) evidence
- A serum proteomic survey of vampire bats provides a reference for circulating proteins but did not specifically report ADAMTS1 in the extracted evidence. Functional data on the D. rotundus ortholog are currently lacking; inference for K9IUF6 relies on the conserved ADAMTS1 domain organization and strong mammalian literature. Journal of Proteome Research, Apr 2021; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00995. (santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 1-2)

10) Conclusions for K9IUF6 functional annotation
- Based on domain conservation and mammalian ADAMTS1 biology, K9IUF6 likely encodes a secreted proteoglycanase that localizes to the extracellular matrix/pericellular space after furin activation, targeting hyalectans such as versican and aggrecan, thereby remodeling ECM and influencing growth factor and receptor signaling (e.g., EGFR). Inflammation and hormonal cues can regulate its expression; TIMP-3/TIMP-2 and α2-macroglobulin likely modulate its activity. Recent (2023–2024) studies emphasize ADAMTS1’s roles in tumor invasion via EGFR-linked axes and in vascular proteoglycan turnover, highlighting potential translational applications as a biomarker and therapeutic target. (chien2024cyclicincreasein pages 1-2, martin2025characterizationofadamts9 pages 21-21, santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 1-2, santamaria2020adamtsproteasesin pages 14-15, kemberi2023theroleof pages 1-3)
