  - term:
      id: GO:0004867
      label: serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
    review:
      summary: Kunitz-type inhibitor annotation supports serine-type 
        endopeptidase inhibitor activity.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: UniProt describes this protein as a Kunitz-type protease 
        inhibitor.

    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
    review:
      summary: Peptidase inhibitor activity is a broad parent term; a more 
        specific serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor term is appropriate.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: Use the specific Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor activity 
        already supported by the UniProt name.
