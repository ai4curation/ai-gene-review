## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9IZA2
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 2 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00071442}; AltName: Full=Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00082650};
- **Gene Information:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Kunitz_BPTI. (IPR002223); Kunitz_BPTI_sf. (IPR036880); Prtase_inh_Kunz-CS. (IPR020901); Kunitz_BPTI (PF00014)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "K9IZA2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'K9IZA2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **K9IZA2** (gene ID: K9IZA2, UniProt: K9IZA2) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Planned approach and verification
- Identity verification: UniProt accession K9IZA2 corresponds to a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 2 (also referred to in orthologous literature as HAI-2/SPINT2) from Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) with Kunitz_BPTI domains (PF00014; IPR002223/IPR036880). The entry lacks a conventional gene symbol; K9IZA2 is an accession. Species-specific primary literature for this exact accession was not found; therefore, functional annotation is inferred from conserved SPINT2/HAI-2 biology and its Kunitz domains, and these inferences are clearly distinguished from direct bat-specific evidence (none found) (rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 1-2, rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 8-10, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 18-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 17-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Protein class: HAI-2/SPINT2 is a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, typically a membrane-associated glycoprotein with one or more Kunitz domains that can also be shed to yield soluble forms. These structural features support a role in regulating extracellular and pericellular proteolysis at epithelial surfaces (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 17-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).
- Primary functional role: Endogenous inhibition of pericellular trypsin-like serine proteases that regulate epithelial homeostasis. Recent work underscores HAI-2’s role in restraining protease cascades impinging on epithelial junction proteins (EpCAM/claudin-7) and on growth-factor activation (pro-HGF → HGF → MET), with implications for barrier integrity and oncogenic signaling (rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 1-2, rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 8-10, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 18-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 17-18).
- Substrates and protease networks: Across 2024 sources, HAI-2 is linked to control of TMPRSS2 and matriptase (ST14) and to proteases that activate pro-HGF (HGFA, matriptase, hepsin) in the HGF/MET axis. In colorectal cancer contexts, “triplex” protease inhibitors were described to mimic HAI-1/2 activity by inhibiting HGFA/matriptase/hepsin, supporting the concept that HAI-2 physiologically targets this protease set (rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 1-2, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).
- Localization: HAI proteins exist in membrane-associated and cleaved soluble forms, and subcellular distribution critically modulates inhibitory activity. Notably, HAI-2 is less effective than HAI-1 at controlling extracellular matriptase due to differential localization, a principle relevant to interpreting HAI-2 function in different tissues (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 17-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 18-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).

Recent developments (2023–2024), prioritized
- Epithelial transport and barrier integrity: In a 2024 study of renal epithelial monolayers, TMPRSS2 was essential for maintaining both ENaC-mediated transepithelial Na+ transport and EpCAM/claudin-7–mediated paracellular barrier; the authors note TMPRSS2 is inhibited by HAI-2 and propose a model wherein TMPRSS2 feeds into a matriptase (ST14)–EpCAM–claudin-7 axis. Loss of TMPRSS2 abolished Na+ transport and reduced full-length EpCAM and claudins, producing a leaky epithelium, indirectly highlighting the importance of HAI-2 in keeping this protease network in check (Life Science Alliance; Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302304) (rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 1-2, rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 8-10).
- HGF/MET signaling and drug resistance: A 2024 CMLS study showed that blocking maturation of HGF ligands (via inhibiting HGF/HGFL protease activation) can overcome both de novo and acquired cetuximab resistance in colorectal cancer. The work integrates HAI-2 into a regulatory framework for the MET/RON axis, reports that HAI proteins are membrane/soluble and localization-dependent, and states that triplex inhibitors mimic HAI-1/2 by inhibiting HGFA, matriptase, and hepsin. The authors identified HAI-2/SPINT2 in a cetuximab sensitivity score, linking SPINT2 levels to therapeutic response prediction (CMLS; Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-05071-5) (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 18-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 17-18).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic protease inhibition in the HGF/MET axis: The use of small-molecule or biologic inhibitors that block proteolytic activation of pro-HGF has been advanced as a strategy to suppress autocrine HGF/MET signaling in cancers with ligand-driven resistance. In 2024, inhibition of HGF maturation overcame cetuximab resistance, suggesting that mimicking HAI-2 activity against HGFA/matriptase/hepsin is a viable approach to resensitize tumors to EGFR blockade (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).
- Biomarker development: Inclusion of SPINT2 in a cetuximab sensitivity score within the 2024 study suggests potential utility of SPINT2 expression/localization as a biomarker for therapeutic stratification in colorectal cancer, pending further validation (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Regulatory dominance of localization: The 2024 analysis emphasizes that HAI-2’s subcellular distribution constrains its ability to control extracellular proteases like matriptase, contrasting with HAI-1. This offers a mechanistic rationale for tissue- and context-dependent effects of SPINT2, where localization, shedding, and trafficking influence functional potency (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 18-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).
- Epithelial integrity model: Cross-referencing recent epithelial studies, the proposed TMPRSS2→matriptase→EpCAM/claudin-7 pathway, with HAI-2 as an upstream inhibitor of TMPRSS2, fits a broader conceptual model in which HAI-2 restrains proteolytic cleavage of adhesion/junction components to preserve barrier function (rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 1-2, rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 8-10).
- Protease network breadth: The triplex-inhibitor concept mapping onto HAI-1/2 activity implies that in vivo HAI-2 may coordinately restrain multiple proteases—HGFA, matriptase, and hepsin—at the cell surface to tune growth-factor activation and epithelial behavior (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Qualitative but strong phenotypes in epithelial monolayers: TMPRSS2 knockout “abolished” transepithelial sodium transport and caused “drastic down-regulation” of EpCAM and claudin-7, producing a “leaky” monolayer, with TMPRSS2 cited as being inhibited by HAI-2. These findings indirectly underscore the significance of HAI-2/TMPRSS2 control for epithelial physiology (Life Science Alliance; Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302304) (rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 1-2).
- Drug resistance reversal: In CRC models, blocking HGF maturation (targeting the HAI-1/2–regulated protease stage) overcame cetuximab resistance, and HAI-1 downregulation correlated with poor prognosis and methylation changes. The study also notes SPINT2 in a cetuximab sensitivity score, linking endogenous inhibitor status to therapeutic response (CMLS; Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-05071-5) (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 18-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 17-18).

Functional annotation for K9IZA2 in Desmodus rotundus (inferred from orthologs and domains)
- Likely biochemical function: As a Kunitz-domain protease inhibitor, K9IZA2 most plausibly inhibits trypsin-like serine proteases at or near the cell surface. Ortholog data implicate HAI-2/SPINT2 in inhibiting TMPRSS2 and in restraining matriptase (ST14), with downstream effects on EpCAM cleavage and claudin-7 stability, thereby supporting epithelial junction integrity (rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 1-2, rickman2024tmprss2maintainsepithelial pages 8-10).
- Pathway context: K9IZA2 may participate in controlling pro-HGF activation and the HGF/MET pathway by inhibiting HGF-activating proteases (HGFA, matriptase, hepsin), modulating ligand availability for MET and RON. This places K9IZA2 at a regulatory node connecting epithelial barrier maintenance with growth-factor signaling (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 17-18).
- Cellular localization: Based on conserved HAI biology, K9IZA2 is expected to be synthesized as a type I membrane protein that can be proteolytically cleaved to soluble forms; subcellular distribution would be expected to modulate inhibitory range (cell-surface vs extracellular space) (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 17-18, jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).
- Caveat: No Desmodus-specific experimental validation was identified; assignments above are domain- and ortholog-based.

Data gaps and recommended next steps
- Species-specific validation: Targeted transcript/proteomics in D. rotundus epithelia and secretomes, and activity-based protease profiling, would test whether K9IZA2 co-localizes with and inhibits the same protease set as mammalian SPINT2.
- Localization mapping: Determining K9IZA2 membrane vs soluble fractions and trafficking will clarify whether bat HAI-2 recapitulates the localization-dependent efficacy seen in human models (jones2024inhibitionofautocrine pages 15-16).
- Pathway readouts: Assaying EpCAM cleavage, claudin-7 stability, and HGF/MET phosphorylation upon K9IZA2 perturbation could establish functional conservation in bat tissues.
