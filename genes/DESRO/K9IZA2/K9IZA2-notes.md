# K9IZA2 Research Notes

## Key findings
- UniProt names it Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 2 [file:DESRO/K9IZA2/K9IZA2-uniprot.txt "RecName: Full=Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 2"].
- Deep research summary describes HAI-2/SPINT2 as a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor and membrane-associated glycoprotein [file:DESRO/K9IZA2/K9IZA2-deep-research-falcon.md "Protein class: HAI-2/SPINT2 is a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, typically a membrane-associated glycoprotein with one or more Kunitz domains that can also be shed to yield soluble forms."].
- UniProt subcellular location indicates cell membrane [file:DESRO/K9IZA2/K9IZA2-uniprot.txt "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane"].
- Deep research notes that species-specific primary literature for this accession was not found and functional annotation is inferred from conserved SPINT2/HAI-2 biology [file:DESRO/K9IZA2/K9IZA2-deep-research-falcon.md "Species-specific primary literature for this exact accession was not found; therefore, functional annotation is inferred from conserved SPINT2/HAI-2 biology and its Kunitz domains, and these inferences are clearly distinguished from direct bat-specific evidence (none found)"]
