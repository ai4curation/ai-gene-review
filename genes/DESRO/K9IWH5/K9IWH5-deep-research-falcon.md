## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9IWH5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=lysozyme {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00012732}; EC=3.2.1.17 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00012732};
- **Gene Information:** Name=LYZ {ECO:0000313|EMBL:QEQ43371.1};
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 22 family.
- **Key Domains:** Glyco_hydro_22. (IPR001916); Glyco_hydro_22_CS. (IPR019799); Glyco_hydro_22_lys. (IPR000974); Lysozyme-like_dom_sf. (IPR023346); Lys (PF00062)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "LYZ" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'LYZ' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **LYZ** (gene ID: K9IWH5, UniProt: K9IWH5) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status update
- Objective 1 (identity verification): LYZ corresponds to a c-type lysozyme (muramidase; EC 3.2.1.17) that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan and belongs to the classical GH22 lysozyme family. The UniProt-provided domains (Glyco_hydro_22) and function align with current literature on c-type lysozymes; no conflicting genes with the same symbol were identified in our retrieved evidence. Organism: Desmodus rotundus is correct; however, species-specific publications directly documenting this UniProt entry’s properties are limited in the retrieved 2023–2024 literature. We proceed with a careful functional annotation anchored to GH22 lysozyme evidence and clearly mark species-specific gaps (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 3-5).

Comprehensive research report: LYZ (UniProt K9IWH5) from Desmodus rotundus

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and reaction class: LYZ encodes a c-type lysozyme (muramidase) that cleaves the β(1→4) glycosidic bond in bacterial peptidoglycan, thereby weakening the cell wall and causing osmotic lysis. This activity is prototypical of GH22 lysozymes and is strongest against Gram-positive bacteria with thick peptidoglycan layers (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 5-7, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 3-5).
- Substrate: The immediate chemical substrate is the N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)–N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) polymer of peptidoglycan; lysozyme targets the β(1→4) linkage between NAM and NAG (gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 5-7, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 3-5).
- Physiological role: Lysozyme is a canonical innate immune effector present in secretions and immune cells, contributing to direct bacteriolysis and to immunomodulation via peptidoglycan fragment generation and other non-enzymatic antimicrobial effects (e.g., membrane perturbation due to cationic character) (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 5-7).

2) Mechanism and catalytic features
- Mechanistic class: c-type (GH22) lysozymes catalyze hydrolysis of the NAM–NAG β(1→4) bond through a classical active site containing multiple subsites for sugar binding. A conserved catalytic glutamate/aspartate dyad (classically Glu35 and Asp52 in hen egg-white lysozyme numbering) provides acid/base catalysis and nucleophile/general base functions, consistent with a retaining glycosidase mechanism described for GH22 lysozymes (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 3-5).
- Structural determinants: GH22 lysozymes are small, highly basic proteins stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds that maintain the integrity of the catalytic cleft; at least two disulfides are required to preserve activity, and oxidation of key residues (e.g., Met, Trp, Tyr) can inactivate enzyme activity (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 7-9).

3) Substrate specificity and organismal context
- Peptidoglycan targeting: GH22 lysozymes prefer Gram-positive bacteria due to accessibility of peptidoglycan, but they can exhibit activity against Gram-negative bacteria when the outer membrane barrier is compromised or via engineered/modified forms that enhance permeabilization (e.g., conjugation with polymers, synergy with chelators or other antimicrobials) (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 5-7, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 9-10).

4) Protein family/domains and evolutionary context
- Family: LYZ belongs to the c-type lysozyme family within GH22; c-, g-, and i-type lysozymes constitute the major lysozyme classes. GH22 lysozymes share a conserved core fold and catalytic architecture. The literature consistently describes c-type lysozymes (including human and chicken) as GH22, with broadly conserved catalytic features across vertebrates (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 3-5).
- Lysozyme–lactalbumin relationship: While this report centers on GH22 lysozymes, many sources note evolutionary and structural relationships between c-type lysozymes and mammalian α-lactalbumins; both are small secreted proteins with related folds, though only lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases (context consistent with GH22 literature; see general GH22 lysozyme overviews) (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3).

5) Cellular localization and secretion (mammals)
- Secretions and immune compartments: Lysozyme is widely distributed in body fluids (e.g., saliva, tears, milk) and present in immune cells; it contributes to mucosal/secreted antimicrobial defense and innate immunity in blood/tissues (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3). These features support extracellular localization (secreted protein) as primary functional context. Specific cell-type attributions (e.g., neutrophil granules, Paneth cells) are well established in the broader literature, but were not retrieved as citable items in our extracted evidence set; therefore, we conservatively report secretion and immune localization based on available sources (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3).

6) Evidence for Desmodus rotundus/bats; species-specific considerations
- Data limitations and inference: Our focused searches retrieved limited, directly citable 2023–2024 sources documenting LYZ protein expression in vampire bat saliva or serum in the evidence set. Older studies and broader bat literature exist but were not captured as evidence here; accordingly, we do not assert species-specific claims beyond UniProt identity and GH22 inference. Function is inferred from conserved GH22/c-type lysozyme properties: secreted muramidase active on peptidoglycan, contributing to innate defense at mucosal surfaces (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 3-5).
- Statement of ambiguity: The gene symbol LYZ is not ambiguous in this context, and the UniProt record (K9IWH5) specifies a GH22 lysozyme in Desmodus rotundus. However, species-specific experimental literature within 2023–2024 supporting saliva or serum detection and adaptive evolution was not recovered by our evidence tool; thus, we annotate function primarily by family/domain inference (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 3-5).

7) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Antibiofilm and surface applications: Reviews and applied reports highlight lysozyme’s integration into wound dressings, implant coatings, and polymeric films, where immobilized lysozyme can prevent Staphylococcus aureus biofilms for extended periods (e.g., >14 days) and inhibit biofilms with microgram loadings embedded in membranes, illustrating real-world anti-biofilm use cases (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 9-10, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 7-9).
- Enzyme engineering and delivery: Chemical conjugation (e.g., dextran, PEGylation, fatty acylation) and formulation advances enhance Gram-negative activity, stability, and half-life; recombinant production in E. coli or yeast with engineered tags/inteins and CRISPR-assisted optimization is commonly used for yield and secretion improvements (gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 3-5, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 9-9).
- Diagnostics and analytical tools: Lysozyme activity underpins workflows that digest peptidoglycan into NAM/NAG disaccharides for downstream analytical labeling and detection; recent chemical biology demonstrates peptidoglycan labeling strategies that rely on lysozyme digestion steps to analyze NAG/NAM-containing fragments, underscoring lysozyme’s utility in modern glycobiology workflows (gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 9-9). Activity-based profiling of retaining glycosidases is advancing, though specific GH22-directed probes were discussed in general terms in the extracted context (gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 9-9).

8) Current applications and implementations
- Food, medical, and environmental uses: Lysozyme is deployed as a food preservative (e.g., additive concentrations ~10–100 µg/ml; egg white contains ~3.2 mg/mL lysozyme), in antimicrobial packaging and water treatment membranes (e.g., chitosan–lysozyme nanofibers), and as part of therapeutic or prophylactic formulations (topicals, aerosols, lozenges) (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 7-9, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 9-9).
- Synergy and combination therapies: Lysozyme synergizes with outer membrane permeabilizers and other antimicrobials to target Gram-negative bacteria and biofilms, a recurring strategy in applied research and translational studies (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 9-10).

9) Expert perspectives and analysis
- Conserved GH22 mechanism supports functional annotation: The presence of GH22 domains and lysozyme-like catalytic motifs provides strong evidence that Desmodus rotundus LYZ (K9IWH5) is a secreted muramidase participating in innate antibacterial defense, with a catalytic acid/base dyad and a retaining mechanism typical of c-type lysozymes (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 3-5, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3).
- Substrate access determines spectrum: The Gram-positive bias is mechanistically explained by cell envelope accessibility; the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria necessitates permeabilization or engineered lysozyme variants to achieve robust activity. This explains the emphasis on conjugates, coatings, and synergy in current applications (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 5-7, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 9-10).
- Translational outlook: The 2023–2024 literature stresses anti-biofilm materials, diagnostic workflows leveraging peptidoglycan digestion, and protein engineering to expand spectrum and stability; these directions are directly compatible with a GH22 lysozyme such as K9IWH5 (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 9-10, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 9-9).

10) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Source and usage levels: Egg white lysozyme content ~3.2 mg/mL; typical preservative concentrations ~10–100 µg/mL; examples of anti-biofilm coatings preventing S. aureus biofilms for >14 days and polymer membranes embedding ~16 µg lysozyme to suppress biofilms (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 7-9, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 9-10).
- Purification yields and specific activities: Example workflow shows stepwise purification to a final specific activity ~2000 U/mg with ~33% overall yield, illustrating achievable performance parameters for recombinant/isolated lysozyme preparations used in research and industry (gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 3-5).

Organism- and record-specific conclusion
- LYZ (K9IWH5) from Desmodus rotundus is best annotated as a secreted c-type lysozyme (GH22 muramidase) that hydrolyzes the β(1→4) NAM–NAG linkage in peptidoglycan via a conserved catalytic dyad, contributing to innate antibacterial defense. While bat- and vampire bat–specific 2023–2024 experimental confirmations in saliva or serum were not recovered in the extracted evidence, the domain architecture and extensive conservation of GH22 lysozymes across mammals strongly support this functional assignment. Applications leveraging lysozyme’s activity—including anti-biofilm materials and analytical digestion of peptidoglycan—are rapidly advancing and directly relevant to the biochemical properties of K9IWH5 (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 3-5, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 5-7, gillaniUnknownyearunveilingtheproduction pages 3-5, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 9-10).

Acknowledgment of limitations
- Bat-specific localization/expression evidence (e.g., saliva or neutrophil/Paneth cell data for D. rotundus) was not present in the extracted 2023–2024 evidence set. Where species-specific literature is limited, we have inferred function from GH22/c-type lysozyme domain knowledge and indicated this explicitly (matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 2-3, matwiejczyk2025lysozymemonomerdimer pages 3-5).
