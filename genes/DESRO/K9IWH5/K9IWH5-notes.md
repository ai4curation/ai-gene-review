# K9IWH5 Research Notes

## Key findings
- UniProt names this protein lysozyme [file:DESRO/K9IWH5/K9IWH5-uniprot.txt "RecName: Full=lysozyme"].
- UniProt assigns this protein to glycosyl hydrolase family 22 [file:DESRO/K9IWH5/K9IWH5-uniprot.txt "Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 22 family."].
- Deep research identifies LYZ as a c-type lysozyme in the GH22 family [file:DESRO/K9IWH5/K9IWH5-deep-research-falcon.md "LYZ corresponds to a c-type lysozyme (muramidase; EC 3.2.1.17) that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan and belongs to the classical GH22 lysozyme family."].
