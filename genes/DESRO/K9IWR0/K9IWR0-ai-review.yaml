  - term:
      id: GO:0007165
      label: signal transduction
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
    review:
      summary: Signal transduction is a broad inference without direct evidence 
        for this DESRO cytokine.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: Annotation is generic and not directly supported in DESRO; core 
        function is cytokine activity.
  - term:
      id: GO:0043123
      label: positive regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
    review:
      summary: Positive regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signaling is a 
        downstream effect inferred from orthology.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: Specific pathway regulation is not directly evidenced for this 
        DESRO protein.

      label: positive regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
    review:
      summary: Positive regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway is a
        downstream inference without direct evidence in DESRO.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: Specific apoptotic pathway regulation is not directly evidenced 
        for this protein.

    review:
      summary: UniProt describes this protein as a cytokine that binds TNF 
        receptors.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: UniProt functional description supports cytokine activity.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
    review:
      summary: UniProt functional description indicates TNF receptor binding.
      action: ACCEPT

      label: extracellular region
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
    review:
      summary: Extracellular region is a broad parent term; extracellular space 
        is more specific for a secreted cytokine.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: UniProt indicates secretion; use extracellular space for 
        specificity.

    review:
      summary: Immune response is a broad inference without direct evidence in 
        DESRO.

    review:
      summary: Humoral immune response is a specific process inferred from 
        orthology without direct DESRO evidence.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: Specific humoral response evidence is lacking for this DESRO
