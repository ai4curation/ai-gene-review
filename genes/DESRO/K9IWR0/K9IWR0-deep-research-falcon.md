## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9IWR0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Lymphotoxin-alpha {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00018403, ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU368120}; Short=LT-alpha {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU368120}; AltName: Full=TNF-beta {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00033253, ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU368120}; AltName: Full=Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 1 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00033263, ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU368120};
- **Gene Information:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the tumor necrosis factor family.
- **Key Domains:** TNF. (IPR006053); TNF_beta. (IPR002960); TNF_CS. (IPR021184); TNF_dom. (IPR006052); Tumour_necrosis_fac-like_dom. (IPR008983)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "K9IWR0" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'K9IWR0' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **K9IWR0** (gene ID: K9IWR0, UniProt: K9IWR0) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan (current status)
- Objective 1 (verify identity): Completed. K9IWR0 is a UniProt accession for lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-α; TNF-β; TNFSF1) from Desmodus rotundus with TNF superfamily domains. No conflicting usage was found. We proceed by inferring function from conserved mammalian LT biology (see Verification below).
- Objectives 2–6 (evidence gathering and synthesis): Completed via targeted literature review prioritizing 2023–2024 sources; quantitative disease associations were extracted where available.
- Objective 7: Submit final answer (this document).

Verification (mandatory steps)
- Identity match: K9IWR0 corresponds to LT-α/TNF-β in Desmodus rotundus per the provided UniProt entry, which places it in the TNF ligand superfamily with canonical TNF domains. No alternative gene/protein with the same accession was identified.
- Organism: Desmodus rotundus (common vampire bat) per the supplied UniProt record.
- Protein family and domains: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family domains, consistent with TNFSF1 (LTA) annotations; this aligns with literature describing LT-α/TNF-β biology in mammals (citations below). If bat-specific functional studies are missing, inference is grounded in conserved TNF superfamily features.

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Ligand identity and forms: Lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-α; TNF-β) is a TNF-superfamily cytokine that exists as a soluble homotrimer (LTα3) and as a membrane-anchored heterotrimer when complexed with LT-β (LTα1β2). LTα3 binds TNFR1 and TNFR2; the membrane LTα1β2 complex signals via LTβR (TNFRSF3) and drives non-canonical NF-κB (alternative) signaling via NIK/IKKα-mediated processing of p100 to p52/RelB (human/mechanistic literature) (Aug 2024, Diabetologia; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-024-06241-1) (haukka2024wholeexomeandwholegenome pages 9-10). Non-canonical NF-κB induction and p100→p52 processing in the context of LT pathways are also highlighted in recent mechanistic work (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1388496) and an in vitro H. pylori study reporting non-canonical activation (2025; details below) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 17-17, gil2025theroleof pages 49-52).
- Receptors and signaling: LTα3→TNFR1/2 predominantly activates canonical NF-κB; LTα1β2→LTβR predominantly activates non-canonical NF-κB through NIK/IKKα and p100 processing to p52/RelB. LTβR-dependent RelB activity is functionally protective in intestinal epithelial repair (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1388496) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 17-17). 
- Cellular sources: LT can be produced by activated T helper (Th1/Th17) cells and certain B-cell subsets; functional roles (e.g., autoimmune models and B-reg cell mechanisms) have been linked to LTα expression in human-focused reviews (Mar 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1289492) (wang2024functionalsignificanceof pages 13-14). In the intestine, T cells can provide the cognate ligand LIGHT (TNFSF14) that signals via LTβR in epithelial cells in damage settings, underscoring the broader TNF-family crosstalk in LTβR signaling (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1388496) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17).
- Biological roles: LTβR signaling is essential for secondary lymphoid organogenesis and adult maintenance/homeostasis of lymphoid tissues; it also shapes mucosal immunity, including epithelial programs and goblet-cell differentiation via LT–LTβR pathways (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1388496) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 17-17).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritized 2023–2024)
- Epithelial protection and mucosal repair via LTβR–RelB: Intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic LTβR–RelB signaling limited mucosal damage after methotrexate, with LTβR deficiency causing severe pathology. LIGHT (not LTαβ) was upregulated early and required T cells; IL‑22 and epithelial proliferation were reduced in LTβR-deficient settings, indicating coordinated LTβR/IL‑22 axes for repair (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1388496) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17).
- Lymphoid organ development and mucosal immunity: Compiled evidence in 2024 emphasizes that membrane LTαβ–LTβR interactions are essential for secondary lymphoid tissue development/maintenance and regulate mucosal immune programs (goblet cell pathways; ILC3 interactions), reinforcing LT’s role beyond inflammation toward tissue organization (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1388496) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 17-17).
- Non-canonical NF-κB activation in infection/inflammation contexts: An in vitro H. pylori study observed p100→p52 processing consistent with non-canonical NF-κB activation, supporting relevance of LTβR-like signaling axes in gastric inflammation and potential carcinogenesis; the authors propose non-canonical NF-κB as a therapeutic target (2025 preclinical; journal unspecified) (gil2025theroleof pages 49-52).
- TNF superfamily in tissue remodeling and fibrosis: 2023 review catalogs translation of TNF-family targeting agents, including LTβR-directed modalities (e.g., baminercept/LTβR‑Ig), in fibrotic/inflammatory pathologies and summarizes clinical evaluation language (Jul 2023, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1219907) (steele2023tnfsuperfamilycontrol pages 14-14).

Current applications and implementations
- LTβR pathway modulators: Clinical/translational literature collated in 2023 highlights LTβR-directed biologics, notably the LTβR-Ig fusion protein baminercept, as agents evaluated for immune/inflammatory conditions and tissue remodeling contexts. The review’s therapeutic summary indicates repurposing and safety/bioavailability assessments for TNF-superfamily targeting in fibrotic disease settings (Jul 2023, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1219907) (steele2023tnfsuperfamilycontrol pages 14-14).
- Intestinal injury repair implications: The 2024 epithelial LTβR–RelB work suggests that enhancing LTβR signaling, or upstream T-cell-derived LIGHT, may support mucosal repair after chemotherapy—a plausible translational avenue to mitigate mucositis or accelerate recovery (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1388496) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17).

Expert opinions and mechanistic analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic consensus: Recent immunology sources converge on a model where membrane LTα1β2–LTβR drives non-canonical NF‑κB via NIK/IKKα/p100→p52/RelB, thereby organizing lymphoid structures and regulating epithelial and stromal programs; LTα3–TNFR1/2 activates canonical NF‑κB, eliciting inflammatory gene expression. The protective epithelial roles of LTβR–RelB (2024) provide causal evidence in vivo for tissue repair programs after cytotoxic injury (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1388496) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17). 
- Disease mechanism framing: Reviews and targeted studies link LT signaling to lymphoid neogenesis and autoimmune pathophysiology, including contributions from Th1/Th17-derived LTα and B-cell LT-dependent mechanisms, underscoring a dual face of LT in protective organization vs chronic inflammatory pathology (Mar 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1289492) (wang2024functionalsignificanceof pages 13-14).

Statistics and data from recent studies (2023–2024)
- Smoking, epigenetics, and IBD at the LTA/TNF locus: A Jan 2024 Nature Communications study integrating cohort, Mendelian randomization, and methylation analyses reported smoking-related methylation at cg03599224 (LTA/TNF locus) associated with Crohn’s disease risk (P = 1.91 × 10−6); current and previous smoking habits were associated with increased CD (P = 7.09 × 10−10) and UC risk (P < 2 × 10−16), respectively (Jan 2024, Nature Communications; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44841-y) (zhang2024altereddnamethylation pages 1-2, zhang2024altereddnamethylation pages 12-13).
- Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) genetics implicating LTA: In 1,064 individuals with type 1 diabetes, LTA variant rs2229092 associated with DKD (OR 0.39, p = 1.47 × 10−4) and replicated in FinnGen (p = 0.0044); the protective C allele associated with lower serum TNFR1/2/3 levels, suggesting attenuated TNF-family signaling (Aug 2024, Diabetologia; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-024-06241-1) (haukka2024wholeexomeandwholegenome pages 9-10).
- Ophthalmic inflammation biomarker: Tear LT‑α levels were significantly lower in active vs inactive pterygium (P < 0.001) in a cohort of 172 patients (2021–2023); an optimal diagnostic threshold ≤ 0.49 dg/ml was proposed in a nomogram model (Jan 2024, Scientific Reports; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-52382-z) (lan2024evaluationoflymphotoxinalpha pages 1-2).
- Hepatocellular carcinoma risk variant: LTA rs1041981 (p.Thr60Asn) associated with HCC in Egyptians (AA vs CC OR 2.9 [1.49–5.49], p = 0.002; dominant model OR 1.8 [1.15–2.97], p = 0.01; recessive model OR 2.3 [1.29–4.23], p = 0.007; A allele vs C allele OR 3.2 [2.22–4.65], p < 0.001) (Mar 2023, Molecular Biology Reports; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-023-08281-z) (alhelf2023prognosticsignificanceof pages 6-7, alhelf2023prognosticsignificanceof pages 7-8).

Functional annotation for K9IWR0 (Desmodus rotundus LT-α/TNF-β)
- Primary function: As a TNF-family ligand, LT-α functions either as a soluble homotrimer (LTα3) that activates TNFR1/TNFR2 to induce canonical NF‑κB–dependent inflammatory programs, or as part of membrane LTα1β2 complexes that signal through LTβR to induce non-canonical NF‑κB via NIK/IKKα/p100→p52/RelB, with key roles in lymphoid tissue organization, epithelial protection and repair, and mucosal immune regulation (Aug 2024, Diabetologia; May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology) (haukka2024wholeexomeandwholegenome pages 9-10, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 17-17).
- Localization and processing: LT‑α is synthesized with a signal peptide for secretion as LTα3; when co-expressed with LT‑β, the complex is retained at the plasma membrane (LTα1β2) for LTβR engagement (human literature confirms these forms and receptor specificities; Aug 2024, Diabetologia) (haukka2024wholeexomeandwholegenome pages 9-10). 
- Pathways: LTα3→TNFR1/2 (canonical NF‑κB); LTα1β2→LTβR (non-canonical NF‑κB through NIK–IKKα–p100 processing) (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; 2025 H. pylori in vitro shows p100→p52 activation consistent with alternative NF‑κB) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 17-17, gil2025theroleof pages 49-52).
- Biological processes: Required for secondary lymphoid organogenesis/maintenance and mucosal immune programs (goblet cell differentiation, epithelial IL‑23/IL‑22 axes), and contributes to lymphoid neogenesis in chronic inflammation; dysregulation is linked to inflammatory and autoimmune disease mechanisms (Mar 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology) (wang2024functionalsignificanceof pages 13-14, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 17-17, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17).

Clinical and translational implications
- LTβR-Ig (baminercept) and related modalities represent tangible translational strategies targeting LT pathways; 2023 review coverage notes clinical evaluation and repurposing within TNF-superfamily therapeutics, including fibrotic disease angles (Jul 2023, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1219907) (steele2023tnfsuperfamilycontrol pages 14-14).
- Epithelial repair signaling suggests therapeutic opportunities to modulate LTβR–RelB or its upstream ligands (e.g., LIGHT) to protect against chemotherapy-induced mucositis (May 2024, Frontiers in Immunology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1388496) (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17).

Bat-specific notes and limitations
- Gene symbol ambiguity: “K9IWR0” is a UniProt accession, not a conventional gene symbol. Species-specific literature directly characterizing Desmodus rotundus LTA was not identified in the 2023–2024 window above. Therefore, functional annotation for K9IWR0 is inferred from conserved TNF-superfamily domain architecture and extensive mammalian LTα/LTβR biology. This is appropriate because LT-ligand and receptor domain constraints, signaling logic (TNFR1/2 vs LTβR), and downstream NF‑κB modules are highly conserved across mammals (evidence cited above for mechanism and function in human/mouse contexts) (haukka2024wholeexomeandwholegenome pages 9-10, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 17-17).

Conclusion
The Desmodus rotundus LTA protein (K9IWR0) is best functionally annotated as a conserved TNF-superfamily ligand functioning in two principal modes: (1) soluble LTα3 signaling via TNFR1/TNFR2 to induce canonical inflammatory programs; and (2) membrane LTα1β2 signaling via LTβR to drive non-canonical NF‑κB (NIK/IKKα/p100→p52/RelB), essential for lymphoid organogenesis/maintenance and for epithelial–mucosal immune crosstalk. Recent 2023–2024 studies strengthen evidence for LTβR–RelB’s protective epithelial role in mucosal repair, implicate the LTA/TNF locus in smoking-mediated IBD risk via DNA methylation, and associate LTA genetic variation with DKD and HCC risk in humans. Translationally, LTβR-Ig (baminercept) and related TNF-family modulators remain active areas for therapeutic exploration in inflammatory and fibrotic contexts. While bat-specific experimental data are limited, these conclusions are well supported by conserved domain architecture and mammalian LT pathway biology (chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 16-17, chen2024ltβrrelbsignalingin pages 17-17, zhang2024altereddnamethylation pages 1-2, haukka2024wholeexomeandwholegenome pages 9-10, lan2024evaluationoflymphotoxinalpha pages 1-2, alhelf2023prognosticsignificanceof pages 6-7, alhelf2023prognosticsignificanceof pages 7-8, zhang2024altereddnamethylation pages 12-13, steele2023tnfsuperfamilycontrol pages 14-14, gil2025theroleof pages 49-52).
