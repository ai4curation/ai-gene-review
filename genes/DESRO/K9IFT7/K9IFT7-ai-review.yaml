      label: innate immune response in mucosa
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
    review:
      summary: Innate immune response in mucosa is a specific inference; 
        bactericidal activity supports a broader defense response to bacterium.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: Use the more general defense response to bacterium term supported 
        by bactericidal activity.

    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
    review:
      summary: CCR6 binding is suggested but stated as possible; evidence is 
        indirect.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: UniProt describes CCR6 ligand activity as "may", without direct 
        evidence in DESRO.

    review:
      summary: Defense response to Gram-negative bacterium is too specific for

        response to bacterium.

    review:
      summary: Extracellular region is a broad parent term; extracellular space 
        is more specific for a secreted defensin.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: UniProt indicates secretion; use extracellular space for 
        specificity.
