## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9IFT7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Beta-defensin 1 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00040807}; AltName: Full=Defensin, beta 1 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00041630};
- **Gene Information:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the beta-defensin family.
- **Key Domains:** Defensin_beta-like. (IPR001855); Defensin_beta (PF00711)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "K9IFT7" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'K9IFT7' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **K9IFT7** (gene ID: K9IFT7, UniProt: K9IFT7) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

*Blockquote: Concise verification of UniProt K9IFT7 identity, symbol ambiguity, and an inference-first policy for functional annotation; useful to avoid misannotation and to prioritize experimental validation.*

Introduction and identity verification
We analyzed UniProt K9IFT7, a beta-defensin 1–like protein from the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus, belonging to the beta-defensin family with Defensin_beta-like domains (PF00711; IPR001855). This accession lacks a conventional gene symbol; therefore, K9IFT7 should be treated strictly as an accession to avoid conflation with unrelated genes in other species. Functional annotation below relies on conserved beta-defensin features and bat-specific genomic context, with explicit notation where inference is applied (daneshi2023expressionregulationand pages 2-3, wang2025comparativeanalysisof pages 10-10, insuasti2023acomparativegenomics pages 15-18).

Key concepts and definitions
- Beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides stabilized by six conserved cysteines forming three disulfide bonds with the characteristic connectivity C1–C5, C2–C4, and C3–C6. This disulfide network stabilizes a β-sheet/CSαβ fold and confers protease resistance and structural rigidity, supporting antimicrobial and immunomodulatory function (Oct 2023, Animals; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13213372) (daneshi2023expressionregulationand pages 2-3).
- Many defensins, including beta-defensins, present a γ-core motif associated with antimicrobial activity across cysteine-rich peptides. At physiological, non-permeabilizing concentrations, human defensins can inhibit plasma membrane H+-ATPases, perturb ion homeostasis (e.g., K+ efflux), and depolarize membranes, revealing non-lytic mechanisms in addition to classical membrane disruption (Jul 2024, IJMS; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137335) (andres2024theantimicrobialactivity pages 14-15).
- Beta-defensins fall within β-sheet AMP classes employing cysteine-stabilized α/β motifs. Their amphipathicity enables both membrane-targeting (pore or carpet-like) and non-membrane mechanisms (e.g., lipid II binding or intracellular targets); disulfides are pivotal to stability and function (Aug 2025, Infection and Drug Resistance; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s514825) (alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 3-5).

Functional inference for K9IFT7 (DEFB1-like) in Desmodus rotundus
- Primary function: Based on conserved DEFB1-like features, K9IFT7 is predicted to encode a secreted, cationic antimicrobial peptide acting at epithelial and mucosal barriers. It likely exerts direct antimicrobial effects via electrostatic interactions with microbial envelopes, with mechanisms ranging from membrane perturbation to enzyme/ion pump interference (e.g., PM H+-ATPase inhibition reported for human β-defensins) (daneshi2023expressionregulationand pages 2-3, andres2024theantimicrobialactivity pages 14-15, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7).
- Substrate/target specificity: Defensins broadly target Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and can act on fungi and some viruses; specific pathogen spectra for D. rotundus DEFB1-like are not yet experimentally defined. The γ-core and cationic surfaces enable interactions with anionic lipids and cell wall intermediates, with potential lipid II engagement posited for defensins generally (andres2024theantimicrobialactivity pages 14-15, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7, olmo2025currentstatusof pages 6-8).
- Processing and structural maturation: As with mammalian β-defensins, the peptide is expected to be synthesized as a prepropeptide with a signal peptide for secretion, a prodomain, and a C-terminal mature peptide containing six conserved cysteines forming the C1–C5, C2–C4, C3–C6 disulfide bonds stabilizing the β-sheet/CSαβ fold (daneshi2023expressionregulationand pages 2-3, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7).

Cellular and tissue localization
- Cellular compartment: Secreted peptide; activity primarily in extracellular spaces at barrier epithelia (airway, oral, gut, urogenital). Beta-defensins are predominantly produced by epithelial cells and can be induced via innate sensing pathways (TLR/NF-κB, MAPK), consistent with mucosal immunity roles (daneshi2023expressionregulationand pages 2-3, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7).
- Tissue context in bats: Comparative genomics indicates defensin loci are common across bats, with expression expected in barrier tissues; some β-defensin paralogs in mammals also show testis-biased expression, which has been suggested as a possibility in bats and merits targeted validation for K9IFT7 (2025, Integrative Zoology; https://doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12915) (wang2025comparativeanalysisof pages 11-12).

Pathway context
- Induction and regulation: Beta-defensins are linked to epithelial innate immune pathways, including TLR/NF-κB and MAPK signaling; they may also be influenced by epigenetic regulation and environmental factors. These pathways are reported across mammals and are consistent with defensin induction in response to microbial PAMPs (daneshi2023expressionregulationand pages 2-3, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7).
- Effector mechanisms: In addition to membrane perturbation, recent work supports defensin actions on microbial energy homeostasis and ion transport (H+-ATPase inhibition), expanding mechanistic models beyond pore formation and aligning with the γ-core motif’s conserved functional role (andres2024theantimicrobialactivity pages 14-15, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Structural connectivity reaffirmed: 2023 synthesis reiterates the β-defensin disulfide connectivity (C1–C5, C2–C4, C3–C6), stabilizing β-sheet folds crucial for function (Oct 2023, Animals; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13213372) (daneshi2023expressionregulationand pages 2-3).
- Mechanistic expansion: 2024 evidence shows human defensins inhibit PM H+-ATPases at physiological concentrations, indicating potent antimicrobial activity without gross membrane permeabilization; defensins share a γ-core motif with other cysteine-rich AMPs (Jul 2024, IJMS; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137335) (andres2024theantimicrobialactivity pages 14-15).
- Bat genomic dynamics: 2025 chromosome-level bat analyses report β-defensin loci residing in evolutionary breakpoint regions (EBRs), with Desmodus rotundus showing copy-number expansion of DEFB105 (~5 copies) and DEFB107 (~2 copies), suggesting genomic rearrangements shaping innate effector repertoires (Oct 2025, Integrative Zoology; https://doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12915) (wang2025comparativeanalysisof pages 10-10, wang2025comparativeanalysisof pages 11-12).
- Diversity and annotation challenges: 2023 comparative genomics across six bat families identifies ~270 β-defensin peptides, with lineage-specific gains and losses and frequent intronic transposable elements complicating annotation—underscoring the need for species-specific validation (insuasti2023acomparativegenomics pages 15-18, insuasti2023acomparativegenomicsa pages 35-39).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic translation: Reviews emphasize delivery innovations (nanoparticles, hydrogels, conjugates) to enhance defensin/AMP stability, bioavailability, and safety; despite progress, few AMP-based products are clinically approved, highlighting translation hurdles relevant to defensin-derived therapeutics (Jul 2025, Molecules; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules30153070) (olmo2025currentstatusof pages 6-8). Broader AMP design and mechanism overviews position β-defensins within a framework for rational optimization (Aug 2025, Infection and Drug Resistance; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s514825) (alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 3-5).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Mechanistic consensus: Contemporary analyses propose that defensin efficacy arises from combined physicochemical features (cationic charge, amphipathicity) and conserved folds/motifs (CSαβ, γ-core), enabling multiple antimicrobial strategies, including non-lytic enzymatic target interference (andres2024theantimicrobialactivity pages 14-15, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7).
- Evolutionary insight in bats: The placement of β-defensins within EBRs and observed copy-number variation in D. rotundus are interpreted as signals of adaptive remodeling of innate defense genes; expression specialization (e.g., potential testis bias of some paralogs) warrants tissue-specific assays in target species (wang2025comparativeanalysisof pages 10-10, wang2025comparativeanalysisof pages 11-12, insuasti2023acomparativegenomics pages 15-18).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Structural pattern: β-defensin disulfide connectivity C1–C5, C2–C4, C3–C6 across mammals (daneshi2023expressionregulationand pages 2-3).
- Mechanism: In vitro demonstration of defensin-induced membrane depolarization, partial K+ efflux, and inhibition of PM H+-ATPase at physiological concentrations (andres2024theantimicrobialactivity pages 14-15).
- Genomic copy number in Desmodus rotundus: DEFB105 ≈5 copies and DEFB107 ≈2 copies within EBRs (wang2025comparativeanalysisof pages 10-10). Broader bat datasets report ~270 β-defensin peptides annotated across surveyed genomes, highlighting extensive family diversity (insuasti2023acomparativegenomics pages 15-18).

Limitations and data gaps
- Species-specific experimental function and localization for K9IFT7 in D. rotundus have not been directly reported in the available context. Quantitative antimicrobial potency (e.g., MICs) for the D. rotundus DEFB1-like peptide is currently unavailable. We therefore restrict quantitative claims to general defensin mechanisms and bat genomic observations and recommend targeted proteomic/expression assays and antimicrobial testing for K9IFT7.

Conclusions
K9IFT7 encodes a beta-defensin 1–like peptide in Desmodus rotundus, bearing the hallmark β-defensin cysteine connectivity and CSαβ/β-sheet fold that underpin secretion, protease resistance, and antimicrobial activity at mucosal barriers. Contemporary research expands defensin mechanisms to include non-lytic interference with microbial H+-ATPases at physiological concentrations, complementing classical membrane effects. Bat comparative genomics indicates defensin gene family dynamism, with D. rotundus showing expansions of specific β-defensins within evolutionary breakpoint regions, suggesting adaptive remodeling of innate effectors. Direct experimental characterization of K9IFT7 in D. rotundus (expression patterns, mature peptide sequence, antimicrobial spectrum) remains an important next step (daneshi2023expressionregulationand pages 2-3, andres2024theantimicrobialactivity pages 14-15, wang2025comparativeanalysisof pages 10-10, wang2025comparativeanalysisof pages 11-12, insuasti2023acomparativegenomics pages 15-18, olmo2025currentstatusof pages 6-8, alzain2025antimicrobialpeptidesmechanisms pages 5-7).
