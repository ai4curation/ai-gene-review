    review:
      summary: Putative plasma protease C1 inhibitor annotation supports 
        serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: UniProt classifies this protein as a plasma protease C1 inhibitor 
        (serpin family).

    review:
      summary: Extracellular region is a broad parent term; extracellular space 
        is the more specific localization for a secreted protein.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: UniProt indicates secretion; use extracellular space for 
        specificity.

    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
    review:
      summary: Proteolysis is inappropriate for a serpin inhibitor and lacks 
        supporting evidence.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: Serpins inhibit proteases rather than catalyze proteolysis; no 
        evidence for proteolytic activity in this protein.
