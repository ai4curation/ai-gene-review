    review:
      summary: DNA binding is a generic inference for a DNase I-like protein and
        may be over-annotated without direct evidence.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: Annotation is inferred from domain/TreeGrafter without direct 
        experimental evidence.

      label: deoxyribonuclease I activity
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
    review:
      summary: DNase I-like annotation supports deoxyribonuclease I activity.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: UniProt names this protein deoxyribonuclease-1-like 1, consistent 
        with DNase I activity.

    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
    review:
      summary: Nuclear localization is not supported by UniProt, which indicates
        ER localization.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: UniProt subcellular location indicates endoplasmic reticulum, not 
        nucleus.
