## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9J287
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Deoxyribonuclease-1-like 1 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00041152}; AltName: Full=DNase X {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00043073}; AltName: Full=Deoxyribonuclease I-like 1 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00042003}; Flags: Fragment;
- **Gene Information:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the DNase I family.
- **Key Domains:** Deoxyribonuclease-1_AS. (IPR018057); DNase_I. (IPR016202); DNASE_I_2. (IPR033125); Endo/exonu/phosph_ase_sf. (IPR036691); Endo/exonuclease/phosphatase. (IPR005135)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "K9J287" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'K9J287' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **K9J287** (gene ID: K9J287, UniProt: K9J287) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification summary
- Identity check: The UniProt accession K9J287 provided corresponds to a protein annotated as a deoxyribonuclease I-like 1 (DNASE1L1; also known as DNase X) fragment in Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat), belonging to the DNase I family and bearing the hallmark DNase I domains listed. The DNase I family assignment and the expectation of a GPI-anchored membrane DNase for DNASE1L1 align with comparative genomics and functional studies of this family in vertebrates (mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3, shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2). No conflicting gene symbol/locus usage was found in the gathered literature; DNASE1L1/DNase X is distinct from DNASE1, DNASE1L2, and DNASE1L3 (mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3, verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 1-2, verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 26-27).
- Organism context: Specific primary literature on DNASE1L1 from Desmodus rotundus is limited. Thus, the functional annotation below draws on ortholog evidence (human/mouse) and conserved DNase I family features, which is appropriate given family conservation and evolutionary analysis (mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3).

Key concepts and definitions
- DNASE1L1 (DNase X): A member of the DNase I family. Unlike the secreted paralogs DNASE1 and DNASE1L3, DNASE1L1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ectoenzyme localized to the plasma membrane and early endocytic vesicles. It is enriched in skeletal and cardiac muscle and in myogenic cells (shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2). DNase I family enzymes are divalent-cation-dependent endonucleases that cleave DNA to produce 3′-OH/5′-phosphate ends and act near neutral pH, in contrast to DNase II family members that are acid-active and cofactor-independent (mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3).
- DNase I family diversification: Vertebrates possess multiple DNase I–type enzymes with distinct localizations and substrates. DNASE1 is broadly secreted; DNASE1L3 is secreted and specialized for microparticle/membrane-associated DNA; DNASE1L2 functions in keratinocytes at acidic pH during cornification; DNASE1L1 evolved a GPI anchor to function at the cell surface, particularly in muscle and migrating cells (mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3).

Function, catalytic activity, and substrate specificity
- Primary function of DNASE1L1: Acts at the cell surface as a GPI-anchored nuclease that degrades extracellular and endocytosed DNA, thereby providing a barrier to endocytosis-mediated gene transfer. Overexpression of DNase X suppresses uptake and expression of endocytosed reporter DNA, while knockdown enhances it, demonstrating a barrier function at the membrane–endocytic interface (Journal of Biological Chemistry; 2007-06; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M610428200) (shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2, shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 2-3).
- Enzymatic properties: As a DNase I–family enzyme, DNASE1L1 is expected to require divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+ typical), operate optimally near neutral pH, and generate 3′-OH/5′-phosphate DNA ends (Scientific Reports; 2022-06; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14133-w) (mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3). Comparative biochemical analyses emphasize that DNase I–family members share signal peptides for secretion into the secretory pathway; DNASE1L1 is routed to the cell surface where it is retained via GPI anchoring (shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2, mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3, verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 1-2).
- Substrate context: DNASE1L1 targets extracellular and endocytosed DNA at the cell surface and in early endosomes, consistent with its localization. By contrast, DNASE1 and DNASE1L3 act in extracellular fluids, and DNASE1L2 digests nuclear DNA during keratinocyte cornification in an acidic environment (shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2, mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3, verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 1-2, verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 26-27).

Cellular localization and expression
- Localization: DNASE1L1 is a GPI-anchored cell-surface ectoenzyme; phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) treatment releases it from the membrane, and immunostaining shows presence at the cell surface and early endocytic vesicles (J Biol Chem; 2007-06; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M610428200) (shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2, shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 2-3).
- Tissue expression: High expression in skeletal muscle and heart muscle; upregulated during myogenic differentiation of human RD myoblasts into myotubes. Broader transcriptomic surveys also note predominant expression in skeletal/cardiac muscle with basal expression elsewhere (Scientific Reports; 2022-06; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14133-w) (shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 2-3, mori2022originandsignificance pages 11-12).

Pathways and biological processes
- Barrier to gene transfer: DNASE1L1 acts in a cell-autonomous barrier pathway limiting endocytosis-mediated DNA transfer. This positions DNASE1L1 in processes that control the fate of extracellular DNA at the membrane and early endosomes in muscle and possibly other cell types, thereby restricting horizontal DNA transfer and shaping responses to extracellular DNA (J Biol Chem; 2007-06; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M610428200) (shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2, shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 2-3).
- Family-level roles in extracellular DNA clearance: DNase I family members collectively facilitate chromatinolysis and extracellular DNA disposal under diverse conditions (e.g., in blood/NETs for DNASE1 and DNASE1L3; in cornifying epithelia for DNASE1L2). DNASE1L3’s specialization for microparticle/membrane-associated DNA complements DNASE1’s broader secreted activity; DNASE1L2 provides acidic-environment activity; DNASE1L1 provides surface-confined activity (PLoS ONE; 2021-07; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253476; Scientific Reports; 2022-06; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14133-w) (verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 1-2, verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 26-27, mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3).

Recent developments and latest research
- Evolutionary insights: Recent comparative genomics (2022) refined the timeline and functional specialization of DNase I family members. DNASE1L1 acquired a C-terminal GPI anchor early in bony fishes, consistent with its conserved membrane localization and specialization as an ectoenzyme in muscle and migrating cells. The study integrates RNA-seq and phylogenomics, linking domain innovations (GPI anchor in DNASE1L1; basic C-terminal peptide in DNASE1L3) to subcellular targeting and substrate preferences (Scientific Reports; 2022-06; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14133-w) (mori2022originandsignificance pages 11-12, mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3).
- Comparative biochemistry: Head-to-head analyses of secreted DNase I family members highlight distinct chromatin digestion patterns and accessory factor sensitivities (e.g., actin, heparin), underscoring complementary roles of DNASE1, DNASE1L2, and DNASE1L3 in extracellular DNA clearance. These results support a model in which lineage-specific traits (e.g., actin sensitivity, glycosylation) were acquired after divergence to fine-tune function (PLoS ONE; 2021-07; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253476) (verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 26-27).
- Note on 2023–2024 literature: Our targeted searches did not retrieve bat-specific DNASE1L1 primary studies or new 2023–2024 DNASE1L1-specific experimental updates within the collected evidence. Thus, 2023–2024 advances are reflected at the family level (e.g., systems views of DNase roles), but DNASE1L1-specific new data were not captured here. This is a limitation of the current evidence set.

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic DNase use: Recombinant DNASE1 is clinically approved for cystic fibrosis to reduce mucus viscosity by digesting extracellular DNA, illustrating translational exploitation of DNase I–family activities (Biomolecules; 2020-07; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10071036) (laukova2020deoxyribonucleasesandtheir pages 3-5).
- Potential diversification of applications: Family-level insights suggest isoform-tailored applications (e.g., actin-resistant, acidic-environment nucleases), though these have been more extensively explored for DNASE1L2 and DNASE1L3 than for DNASE1L1. DNASE1L1’s membrane confinement implies niche roles rather than systemic enzyme therapy (PLoS ONE; 2021-07; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253476; Scientific Reports; 2022-06; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14133-w) (verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 1-2, verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 26-27, mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3).

Expert opinions and authoritative perspectives
- Reviews emphasize specialization: Comparative and conceptual reviews argue that vertebrate DNase I family diversification reflects adaptation to specific biological niches for DNA debris removal: DNASE1 (systemic fluids), DNASE1L3 (microparticle/membrane-associated DNA; autoimmunity prevention), DNASE1L2 (cornification at acidic pH), and DNASE1L1 (membrane-confined surface DNA control in muscle/migrating cells) (Scientific Reports; 2022-06; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14133-w; PLoS ONE; 2021-07; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253476) (mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3, verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 1-2, verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 26-27).
- Primary demonstration of DNASE1L1’s role: The JBC study provided causal evidence for DNASE1L1’s barrier function at the membrane, using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in myogenic cells (Journal of Biological Chemistry; 2007-06; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M610428200) (shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2, shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 2-3).

Relevant statistics and data
- Membrane anchoring and function: In myogenic cell models, DNASE1L1 protein increases during differentiation (day 3 to day 5), and overexpression vs. siRNA knockdown significantly decreases vs. increases reporter gene expression after endocytosis-mediated DNA delivery, respectively, demonstrating quantitative effects on gene transfer efficiency (J Biol Chem; 2007-06; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M610428200) (shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 2-3). Exact numeric fold-changes were not captured in the extracted excerpt.
- Family biochemistry contrasts: Comparative assays report distinct chromatin cleavage patterns and accessory factor sensitivities among secreted family members, supporting complementary action under varied extracellular conditions (PLoS ONE; 2021-07; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253476) (verhulsdonk2021comparisonofthe pages 26-27).

Orthology and inference to Desmodus rotundus K9J287
- Given K9J287’s UniProt annotation as a DNase I–family DNASE1L1-like fragment in D. rotundus, and the conserved acquisition of a GPI anchor in DNASE1L1 across bony vertebrates, it is reasonable to infer that K9J287 encodes a GPI-anchored DNase I–type ectoenzyme with functions analogous to mammalian DNASE1L1 (surface DNA digestion and barrier to endocytosis-mediated gene transfer), localized to the plasma membrane/early endocytic vesicles in muscle and related tissues. Direct bat-specific experimental validation has not been identified in the present evidence and remains a gap (Scientific Reports; 2022-06; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14133-w; J Biol Chem; 2007-06; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M610428200) (mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3, shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2).

Limitations and recommendations
- Gene symbol ambiguity: The term “K9J287” is an accession, not a gene symbol; literature predominantly uses DNASE1L1 or DNase X for orthologs. We found limited organism-specific literature for Desmodus rotundus. Therefore, the report relies on conserved family features and ortholog data. Additional organism-specific validation (expression, GPI anchoring, activity assays) in D. rotundus is recommended (mori2022originandsignificance pages 1-3, shiokawa2007dnasexis pages 1-2).
