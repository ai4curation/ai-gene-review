# K9J287 Research Notes

## Key findings
- UniProt names this protein deoxyribonuclease-1-like 1 [file:DESRO/K9J287/K9J287-uniprot.txt "RecName: Full=Deoxyribonuclease-1-like 1"].
- UniProt subcellular location indicates endoplasmic reticulum [file:DESRO/K9J287/K9J287-uniprot.txt "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum"].
- Deep research summary links the accession to DNASE1L1/DNase X and the DNase I family [file:DESRO/K9J287/K9J287-deep-research-falcon.md "The UniProt accession K9J287 provided corresponds to a protein annotated as a deoxyribonuclease I-like 1 (DNASE1L1; also known as DNase X) fragment in Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat), belonging to the DNase I family"].
- Deep research summary notes limited species-specific literature [file:DESRO/K9J287/K9J287-deep-research-falcon.md "Specific primary literature on DNASE1L1 from Desmodus rotundus is limited."].
