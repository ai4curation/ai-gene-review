      label: extracellular space
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
    review:
      summary: Extracellular space is inferred for this secreted-like protein, 
        but UniProt cautions missing conserved residues for annotation 
        propagation.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: No direct experimental evidence for secretion in DESRO; UniProt 
        caution advises against confident functional propagation.

      label: negative regulation of inflammatory response
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
    review:
      summary: Negative regulation of inflammatory response is a specific 
        inference without direct evidence in DESRO.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: No experimental evidence supports this process for DESRO K9IIP0; 
        inference may not transfer.

      label: hyaluronic acid binding
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
    review:
      summary: Hyaluronic acid binding is inferred from domain association, but 
        UniProt cautions missing conserved residues.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: Potential binding activity is uncertain for this DESRO protein due
        to UniProt caution.

    review:
      summary: Cell adhesion is a broad inference without direct evidence in 
        DESRO.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: No experimental support for cell adhesion in this DESRO protein.

      label: hydrolase activity
    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
    review:
      summary: Hydrolase activity is not supported for TNFAIP6-like proteins and
        lacks direct evidence in DESRO.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: No evidence of hydrolase activity; annotation is keyword-based and
        unreliable.
