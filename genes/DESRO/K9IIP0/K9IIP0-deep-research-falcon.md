## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9IIP0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 protein {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00069597}; AltName: Full=TNF-stimulated gene 6 protein {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00081068}; AltName: Full=Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00077610};
- **Gene Information:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** C-type_lectin-like/link_sf. (IPR016186); CTDL_fold. (IPR016187); CUB_dom. (IPR000859); Link_dom. (IPR000538); Sperma_CUB_dom_sf. (IPR035914)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "K9IIP0" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'K9IIP0' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **K9IIP0** (gene ID: K9IIP0, UniProt: K9IIP0) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification. We verified that UniProt accession K9IIP0 corresponds to tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6 (TNFAIP6/TSG-6) from Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat), with hallmark Link and CUB domains and hyaluronan-binding/link module and CUB superfamily annotations. Direct bat-specific primary literature is limited; therefore, functional annotation is inferred from conserved domain architecture and extensive mammalian data on TSG-6.

Key concepts and definitions. TNFAIP6/TSG-6 is a secreted, inflammation-inducible glycoprotein (~35 kDa) composed of an N-terminal region followed by a hyaluronan-binding Link module and a CUB domain. The Link module mediates binding to hyaluronan (HA) and other glycosaminoglycans; residues Lys11, Tyr12, Tyr59, Phe70, Tyr78, and Arg81 contribute to HA binding and function. TSG-6 binds inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) and catalyzes covalent transfer of IαI heavy chains (HCs) onto HA to form HC·HA complexes (also termed SHAP-HA), via a TSG-6·HC intermediate, thereby remodeling extracellular matrices at sites of inflammation and ovulation. TSG-6 also noncovalently crosslinks HA via induced TSG-6 oligomerization and binds chemokines (e.g., CXCL8/IL-8), modulating leukocyte trafficking. It is secreted into the extracellular space and acts in the ECM and pericellular matrix. (dong2020investigationoftsg6 pages 25-28, albtoush2018inhibitingthefunction pages 21-32)

Mechanistic functions and pathways. The Link module’s HA binding is pH- and residue-specific and can lead to noncovalent HA networking; full-length TSG-6, but not isolated Link_TSG6, mediates HC transfer from IαI to HA. HC transfer enhances leukocyte adhesion to HA matrices and is increased in inflamed synovial fluid and tissues. TSG-6 directly binds CXCL8 at its GAG-binding site (KD ~25 nM) to inhibit chemokine presentation on endothelial GAGs and suppress neutrophil transendothelial migration, delineating an anti-inflammatory pathway. In osteoarthritis and other inflammatory conditions, the TNF-α–TSG-6–HC·HA axis is upregulated; TSG-6 modulates matrix proteolysis (e.g., plasmin/MMP pathways) and can be chondroprotective in models. In the gut, HA-mediated mucosal healing requires TSG-6, consistent with a role in epithelial regeneration. (dyer2014tsg6inhibitsneutrophil pages 1-2, dong2020investigationoftsg6 pages 25-28, fasanello2021hyaluronicacidsynthesis pages 1-2, sammarco2019hyaluronanacceleratesintestinal pages 15-17, albtoush2018inhibitingthefunction pages 21-32)

Recent developments (2023–2024). In 2024, Ilg et al. reported that TGF-β1 induces formation of TSG-6–enriched extracellular vesicles from fibroblasts; these EVs prevent myofibroblast transformation by inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting an EV-mediated, anti-fibrotic mechanism for TSG-6. In 2024, Dodd et al. provided chemical/structural insights: specific chemical modifications to HA oligosaccharides increased affinity for Link_TSG6 (distinct from CD44_HABD), with docking implicating Arg81 in salt-bridge formation; select modifications turned short HA oligos into substrates for HC transfer, indicating a means to tune TSG-6 enzymatic activity. A 2024 cancer review highlights TSG-6’s roles in constructing inflammatory ECM niches through HC·HA and promoting CD44-dependent adhesion, with implications in metastasis. (ilg2024tgfβ1inducesformation pages 11-12, dodd2024chemicalmodificationof pages 1-3, xu2024hyaluronicacidinteracting pages 20-21)

Localization. TSG-6 is secreted, present in extracellular fluid/ECM, and can be stored in neutrophil granules for rapid release; it localizes to HA-rich matrices, synovial fluid, and wounded tissues where it participates in ECM remodeling. (dong2020investigationoftsg6 pages 25-28, fasanello2021hyaluronicacidsynthesis pages 1-2)

Biochemical activities and specificity. TSG-6 exhibits: (1) HA binding via the Link module; (2) noncovalent HA crosslinking through TSG-6 oligomerization; (3) enzymatic transesterase activity transferring IαI heavy chains to HA to form HC·HA; (4) chemokine binding (e.g., CXCL8) to inhibit neutrophil migration; and (5) modulation of protease pathways via effects on inter-α-inhibitor/plasmin activity. Substrate specificity includes HA as the principal glycosaminoglycan ligand for Link-mediated functions, with competition by certain chondroitin sulfates; IαI serves as heavy-chain donor for covalent modification of HA. (dong2020investigationoftsg6 pages 28-33, dyer2014tsg6inhibitsneutrophil pages 1-2, dong2020investigationoftsg6 pages 25-28, albtoush2018inhibitingthefunction pages 21-32)

Roles in disease and physiology. In osteoarthritis, TSG-6 expression and HC·HA formation increase in synovial fluid and tissues; the axis is TNF-α inducible, and HC·HA localizes to synovium and chondrocyte surfaces. In mucosal injury and ulcerative colitis models, HA treatment accelerates healing in a TSG-6–dependent manner; deleting TSG-6 abrogates HA’s benefit. In acute inflammation, TSG-6’s binding to CXCL8 and interference with GAG-mediated chemokine presentation reduces neutrophil trafficking, providing tissue protection. (fasanello2021hyaluronicacidsynthesis pages 1-2, sammarco2019hyaluronanacceleratesintestinal pages 15-17, dyer2014tsg6inhibitsneutrophil pages 1-2)

Current applications and implementations. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) secrete TSG-6, which contributes to MSCs’ anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective effects across models; mechanism includes suppression of neutrophil transendothelial migration and modulation of macrophage NF-κB signaling. In the clinic, a TSG-6–mimetic peptide (ALY688) progressed to ophthalmic trials for dry eye disease (Phase 1/2a NCT04201574: completed; Phase 2/3 NCT04899518: completed) and a systemic formulation trial (NCT04855565: terminated), indicating translational interest in TSG-6 pathway agonism. (dyer2014tsg6inhibitsneutrophil pages 1-2)

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses. The mechanistic body of work positions TSG-6 as a multifunctional hyaladherin and inflammation-modifying enzyme that remodels HA matrices through both covalent (HC transfer) and noncovalent (crosslinking) mechanisms and tempers neutrophil recruitment by chemokine sequestration. 2024 advances indicate that EV-associated TSG-6 may be a lever to modulate fibroblast activation via ERK1/2, and that chemical editing of HA can selectively tune TSG-6 binding and HC transfer, opening paths for rational biomaterials and therapeutics targeting HA–TSG-6 axes. (ilg2024tgfβ1inducesformation pages 11-12, dodd2024chemicalmodificationof pages 1-3)

Statistics and specific data points. Dyer et al. quantified TSG-6–CXCL8 binding with KD ~25 nM and demonstrated inhibition of chemokine transcytosis and neutrophil migration across endothelium. Fasanello et al. showed elevated TSG-6 expression and HC·HA presence in OA synovial fluid/tissues with localization to synovium and superficial chondrocytes and observed that HA concentration, rather than HA MW or HC·HA crosslinking, primarily determines synovial fluid viscosity. Ilg et al. reported ~7.3-fold upregulation of TNFAIP6 in myofibroblast-derived EVs under TGF-β1 and inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation dependent on EV uptake. Dodd et al. identified HA modifications that increased Link_TSG6 affinity and enabled HC-transfer activity from modified HA oligos, with docking implicating Arg81 interactions. (dyer2014tsg6inhibitsneutrophil pages 1-2, fasanello2021hyaluronicacidsynthesis pages 1-2, ilg2024tgfβ1inducesformation pages 11-12, dodd2024chemicalmodificationof pages 1-3)

Relevance to Desmodus rotundus (K9IIP0). The vampire bat protein retains the defining Link and CUB domains and hyaluronan-binding/link-fold annotations, supporting conservation of HA binding, noncovalent crosslinking, and HC-transfer functions observed in mammals. Therefore, K9IIP0 is most likely a secreted ECM-modifying and inflammation-modulating protein with roles in HA-rich matrices analogous to human TSG-6.

Limitations and open questions. Bat-specific expression patterns, post-translational modifications, and interaction partners have not been resolved; research would benefit from sequencing/ortholog alignment and expression profiling in bat tissues. 2023–2024 literature emphasizes chemical modulation of HA–TSG-6 interactions and EV-mediated signaling, but detailed in vivo efficacy and safety data for TSG-6-targeted therapies remain sparse outside ophthalmology.
