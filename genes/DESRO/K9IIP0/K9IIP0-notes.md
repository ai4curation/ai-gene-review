# K9IIP0 Research Notes

## Key findings
- UniProt names this protein Tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 protein [file:DESRO/K9IIP0/K9IIP0-uniprot.txt "RecName: Full=Tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 protein"].
- Deep research identifies K9IIP0 as TNFAIP6/TSG-6 with Link and CUB domains [file:DESRO/K9IIP0/K9IIP0-deep-research-falcon.md "UniProt accession K9IIP0 corresponds to tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6 (TNFAIP6/TSG-6) from Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat), with hallmark Link and CUB domains and hyaluronan-binding/link module and CUB superfamily annotations."].
- Deep research notes TSG-6 is secreted and inflammation-inducible [file:DESRO/K9IIP0/K9IIP0-deep-research-falcon.md "TNFAIP6/TSG-6 is a secreted, inflammation-inducible glycoprotein"]
