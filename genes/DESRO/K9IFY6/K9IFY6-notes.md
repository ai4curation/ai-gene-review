# K9IFY6 Research Notes

## Key findings
- UniProt names this protein a C-C motif chemokine [file:DESRO/K9IFY6/K9IFY6-uniprot.txt "RecName: Full=C-C motif chemokine"].
- UniProt indicates the protein is secreted [file:DESRO/K9IFY6/K9IFY6-uniprot.txt "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted"].
- Deep research confirms K9IFY6 as a C-C motif chemokine from vampire bat [file:DESRO/K9IFY6/K9IFY6-deep-research-falcon.md "UniProt K9IFY6 corresponds to a C-C motif chemokine from Desmodus rotundus (common vampire bat)"]
- UniProt places this protein in the chemokine CC family [file:DESRO/K9IFY6/K9IFY6-uniprot.txt "Belongs to the intercrine beta (chemokine CC) family."].
