## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9IFY6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=C-C motif chemokine {ECO:0000256|RuleBase:RU361150};
- **Gene Information:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the intercrine beta (chemokine CC) family.
- **Key Domains:** Chemokine_b/g/d. (IPR039809); Chemokine_CC_CS. (IPR000827); Chemokine_IL8-like_dom. (IPR001811); Interleukin_8-like_sf. (IPR036048); IL8 (PF00048)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "K9IFY6" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'K9IFY6' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **K9IFY6** (gene ID: K9IFY6, UniProt: K9IFY6) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
- Identity verified: UniProt K9IFY6 corresponds to a C-C motif chemokine from Desmodus rotundus (common vampire bat), annotated with an IL8-like (chemokine) domain and membership in the intercrine beta (CC chemokine) family. No canonical gene symbol is assigned. Literature specific to this accession is sparse; functional interpretation therefore relies on well-established CC chemokine family properties and bat immunology studies, especially from vampire bats (Desmodus). (vicentesantos2023serumproteomicsreveals pages 1-2)

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Chemokines: small secreted cytokines classified by N-terminal cysteine motifs into CC, CXC, CX3C, and XC families; their principal roles are to guide leukocyte trafficking and tissue positioning through gradients formed on endothelial and extracellular matrices. CC chemokines (intercrine beta family) typically attract monocytes, T cells, dendritic cells, and other leukocytes. Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKR1–ACKR4) regulate chemokine availability via scavenging/transport rather than classical G protein signaling. (Published 2024; overview) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34). URL (Upadhyay 2024): https://doi.org/10.1017/erm.2024.36 (Nov 2024) (upadhyay2024chemokinessignatureand pages 18-18)
- Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding: Many chemokines bind GAGs on cell surfaces and ECM to establish haptotactic gradients and protect ligands from proteolysis or other post-translational modifications; recognition interfaces extend beyond the historic CRS1/CRS2 “two-site” model to involve contiguous surfaces and extracellular loops. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)
- Receptors: Classical chemokine receptors are GPCRs (CCR1–CCR10, CXCR1–6, CX3CR1, XCR1). CC chemokines predominantly engage CCR family receptors to direct chemotaxis and activation of immune cells. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)

2) Structure, localization, and maturation (inference for K9IFY6)
- Subcellular localization: CC chemokines are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide, processed through the secretory pathway, and secreted as disulfide-stabilized monomers or oligomers; family-conserved cysteines form characteristic disulfide bonds that stabilize the IL8-like fold. Thus, K9IFY6 is expected to be a secreted protein localized extracellularly, functioning in intercellular signaling. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)
- Post-translational processing: Proteolytic trimming (e.g., DPP4/CD26), C-terminal truncation, glycosylation, nitration, or citrullination can modulate receptor specificity and potency; such PTMs are common across chemokines and may regulate K9IFY6 activity. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)

3) Signaling pathways downstream of chemokine receptors (CCR/ACKR)
- Classical signaling: Chemokine receptor activation typically couples to Gαi/o, reducing cAMP; Gβγ activates PLC-β to generate IP3 and DAG, elevating intracellular Ca2+ and engaging cytoskeletal remodeling for chemotaxis. ERK/MAPK and PI3K pathways downstream of GPCR activation further regulate migration, survival, and effector functions. GRK-mediated phosphorylation recruits β-arrestins, driving receptor internalization and biased/alternative signaling. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)
- Atypical receptor functions: ACKRs do not signal via G proteins but control chemokine gradients by scavenging and transporting ligands; β-arrestin–dependent uptake and trafficking by ACKRs modulate chemokine availability to classical CCRs. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)
- Therapeutic context: Recent structural biology and receptor pharmacology advances inform chemokine receptor drug design (e.g., CCR2, CCR5, CXCR4) and clinical applications, underscoring conserved signaling logic across species that is relevant for interpreting K9IFY6 function via its putative CCR partners. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2025.1603950 (Jun 2025) (wang2025progressinstructurebased pages 17-17)

4) Bat-specific immune features relevant to chemokines and tolerance (emphasis on vampire bats)
- Conservation of chemokine receptors in bats: Comparative immunophenotyping shows bats conserve key myeloid markers and chemokine receptor homologs (e.g., CCR2, CX3CR1), often resembling human rather than murine patterns, supporting translational inference from human chemokine biology to bats. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-57212-1 (Jan 2020) (gamage2020immunophenotypingmonocytesmacrophages pages 1-2)
- Serum proteomics in Desmodus rotundus: In wild vampire bats (n=19), shotgun serum proteomics identified 586 proteins and, although global composition differences between infected and uninfected bats were not detected, pathogen-specific candidate biomarkers (4–48 per pathogen; seven overlapping biomarkers) were nominated. Viral infections were associated with upregulation of extracellular/secretory vesicle pathways and downregulation of complement activation and coagulation cascades, consistent with a tolerance-oriented phenotype. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1281732 (Dec 2023) (vicentesantos2023serumproteomicsreveals pages 1-2)
- Interpretation: While individual chemokines were not the central readouts in these studies, the pattern of dampened complement/coagulation and nuanced inflammatory signatures is compatible with altered chemokine milieu and responsiveness as part of disease tolerance in bats. (2023) (vicentesantos2023serumproteomicsreveals pages 1-2)

5) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Chemokine receptor targeting: Clinical and translational programs exploit CCR/CXCR antagonists or modulators (e.g., CCR2/CCR5/CXCR4) in inflammation, fibrosis, infection, and cancer; structure-guided approaches and biased signaling concepts are used to refine efficacy and safety. These strategies rely on conserved GPCR signaling properties that likely apply to bat receptors as well, informing cross-species inference for functional annotation. (2025; generalizable framework) URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2025.1603950 (Jun 2025) (wang2025progressinstructurebased pages 17-17)
- T cell chemokine signatures: In infection settings (e.g., leishmaniasis), CC chemokines like CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 shape T cell trafficking and effector programs, illustrating the diagnostic/therapeutic value of chemokine signatures and suggesting analogous utility of chemokine readouts in wildlife disease ecology. URL: https://doi.org/10.1017/erm.2024.36 (Nov 2024) (upadhyay2024chemokinessignatureand pages 18-18)

6) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- 2024 chemokine receptor network summaries emphasize the expanded view of chemokine–receptor interfaces, roles of GAGs, and regulatory function of ACKRs in sculpting chemokine landscapes—key considerations when inferring function for uncharacterized CC chemokines like K9IFY6 in non-model organisms. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)
- 2023 vampire bat proteomics provides field-derived evidence for disease-tolerance phenotypes, highlighting subtle but consistent shifts in pathways (e.g., complement/coagulation) during viral infections; this supports hypotheses that bat chemokine networks may favor controlled inflammation and effective trafficking without overt pathology. (Dec 2023) URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1281732 (vicentesantos2023serumproteomicsreveals pages 1-2)

7) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies (2023–2024 priority)
- Desmodus rotundus serum proteomics: 19 bats sampled; 586 serum proteins identified; no global proteome composition difference between infected vs. uninfected groups; candidate biomarkers per pathogen range 4–48 with seven overlapping biomarkers; viral infections associated with downregulated complement and coagulation cascades and upregulated extracellular/secretory vesicle pathways. (Dec 2023) URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1281732 (vicentesantos2023serumproteomicsreveals pages 1-2)

Functional annotation for K9IFY6 (synthesis and inference)
- Primary function: K9IFY6, as a CC chemokine family member with an IL8-like domain, is inferred to act as a secreted chemotactic cytokine that binds glycosaminoglycans and engages CCR-family receptors on leukocytes to direct cell migration and positioning in tissues. Its activity is expected to be modulated by PTMs and ACKR-mediated scavenging. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34, upadhyay2024chemokinessignatureand pages 18-18)
- Cellular/extracellular localization: Secreted protein operating in the extracellular space; disulfide-stabilized IL8-like fold typical of chemokines. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)
- Pathways: Downstream signaling via Gαi-coupled CCRs leading to reduced cAMP, PLC-β–mediated Ca2+ mobilization, and activation of MAPK/PI3K pathways; β-arrestin recruitment and receptor internalization expected upon ligand binding. (2024) (giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)
- Bat context: Given conservation of chemokine receptors in bats and the tolerant immune signatures observed in vampire bats, K9IFY6 may contribute to orchestrating leukocyte trafficking under a regulatory regime that avoids excessive inflammation, though direct measurement for this locus has not yet been reported. (2020; 2023) (gamage2020immunophenotypingmonocytesmacrophages pages 1-2, vicentesantos2023serumproteomicsreveals pages 1-2)

Limitations and verification notes
- Ambiguity: “K9IFY6” is an accession, not a conventional gene symbol; no peer-reviewed study directly characterizing Desmodus rotundus K9IFY6 was found in the searched literature. All functional statements for K9IFY6 are inferences from CC chemokine family features and bat immunology datasets; targeted experimental validation (expression profiling in bat tissues, receptor-binding assays to candidate CCRs, and chemotaxis bioassays) is recommended. (vicentesantos2023serumproteomicsreveals pages 1-2, giulia2024investigatingthechemokine pages 30-34)

Conclusion
K9IFY6 encodes a putative secreted CC chemokine from the vampire bat with an IL8-like domain. By strong family-based inference, it likely binds GAGs and activates CCR-family GPCRs on leukocytes to mediate chemotaxis and immune cell positioning, with activity modulated by PTMs and regulated by ACKRs. Bat immunology indicates conserved chemokine receptor architecture and disease-tolerance phenotypes in vampire bats, consistent with precise but restrained inflammatory responses. Direct experimental characterization of K9IFY6 (ligand–receptor pairing, expression profile, and functional assays) remains an important next step.
