    review:
      summary: TreeGrafter smooth muscle cell migration annotation lacks direct 
        evidence for this salivary protein.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: No experimental support for smooth muscle cell migration; UniProt 
        notes a secreted plasminogen activator with caution about conserved 
        residues.

    review:
      summary: Plasminogen activation is suggested computationally, but UniProt 
        cautions that conserved residues required for feature propagation are 
        missing.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: No direct experimental evidence for plasminogen activation in this
        DESRO protein and UniProt flags missing conserved residues.

    review:
      summary: Serine-type endopeptidase activity is predicted, but UniProt 
        flags missing conserved residues for feature propagation.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: Activity is inferred from EC mapping; caution indicates 
        uncertainty about catalytic competence.
