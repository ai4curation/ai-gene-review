## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** K9IJK6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=t-plasminogen activator {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00013193}; EC=3.4.21.68 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00013193};
- **Gene Information:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Organism (full):** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Kringle. (IPR000001); Kringle-like. (IPR013806); Kringle_CS. (IPR018056); Kringle_sf. (IPR038178); Peptidase_S1_PA. (IPR009003)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "K9IJK6" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Desmodus rotundus (Vampire bat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'K9IJK6' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **K9IJK6** (gene ID: K9IJK6, UniProt: K9IJK6) in DESRO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Gene/protein identity verification
- The UniProt accession K9IJK6 corresponds to a tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)-like serine protease (EC 3.4.21.68) from the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus. Domain annotations include kringle motifs and a Peptidase S1 (trypsin-like) catalytic domain, aligning with canonical mammalian tPA family architecture and vampire-bat tPA orthologs (desmoteplase/DSPA) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7, hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 5-6).
- Literature on vampire bat salivary plasminogen activators (DSPA) confirms the organism and protein family context for a bat tPA ortholog and supports kringle-containing, S1 peptidase architecture (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 2-3, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 5-7).

Key concepts and definitions
- Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a secreted serine protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin, the effector protease of fibrinolysis; it is strongly potentiated by fibrin binding (EC 3.4.21.68) (Heliyon review, 2024-03; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26668) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7, hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 5-6).
- Canonical tPA domain structure comprises a Finger (fibronectin type I) domain, an EGF-like domain, two kringle domains (K1, K2), and a C-terminal serine protease domain; this modular architecture mediates fibrin binding and substrate positioning (Heliyon 2024) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7, hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 5-6).
- Desmoteplase (DSPA) denotes vampire bat tPA orthologs secreted in saliva, evolved for highly fibrin-specific plasminogen activation; several isoforms (e.g., DSPAα1/α2/β/γ) differ in domain composition and fibrin selectivity (Medcalf 2012; Br J Pharmacol, 2012-01; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01514.x) (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 2-3, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 3-5).

Domains and structure
- Human tPA consists of F, EGF, K1, K2, and protease domains; kringle domains provide lysine-binding and fibrin interactions, while the protease domain catalyzes cleavage of plasminogen at Arg561–Val562 (Heliyon 2024) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7).
- DSPA isoforms exhibit distinct domain arrangements compared to human tPA. DSPAα variants often lack the K2 domain and the canonical plasmin-sensitive activation cleavage site, remaining as stable single-chain enzymes whose activity is markedly increased only upon fibrin binding (Medcalf 2012) (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 2-3, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 3-5).

Enzymatic function and substrate specificity
- Reaction: conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (Arg561–Val562 cleavage in human plasminogen), with catalytic efficiency enhanced by co-localization on fibrin, which binds both tPA/DSPA and plasminogen (Heliyon 2024) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7).
- Fibrin specificity: human tPA displays strong fibrin preference; DSPAα1 exhibits dramatically higher fibrin selectivity than human tPA, reported as approximately 90–180 fold greater (and up to ~12,900-fold relative increase in fibrin-enhanced activation versus tPA, depending on the metric), consistent with quiescence in plasma and activation primarily on fibrin polymers (Medcalf 2012) (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 3-5, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 12-13, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 14-14, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 13-14).

Inhibitors and regulation
- PAI‑1 is the principal fast-acting inhibitor of tPA; engineering (e.g., tenecteplase) increases PAI‑1 resistance and half-life (Heliyon 2024) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7).
- DSPA variants appear less sensitive to PAI‑1 and certain neuronal serpins in some experimental systems, potentially due to loss of the K2 domain and differences in kringle architecture, though direct kinetic constants versus human tPA are variably reported (Medcalf 2012) (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 2-3, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 3-5).
- In the CNS, human tPA engages additional targets (e.g., LRP, PDGF‑CC and NMDAR interactions) that may increase BBB permeability and contribute to neurotoxicity; DSPA lacks K2 and exhibits reduced interactions with such partners, with preclinical data suggesting fewer neurotoxic effects (Medcalf 2012) (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 9-10, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 14-14).

Localization and cellular/extracellular context
- tPA is secreted by endothelial cells and acts in plasma and on fibrin within thrombi; DSPA is secreted in vampire bat saliva and is specialized for fibrin-targeted plasminogen activation in prey, with minimal fluid-phase activation (Heliyon 2024; Medcalf 2012) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 19-20, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 12-13, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 13-14).

Pathway context
- tPA/DSPA function in the fibrinolytic cascade: tPA/DSPA→plasminogen→plasmin→fibrin degradation; regulation by PAI-1 (inhibits tPA), α2‑antiplasmin (inactivates plasmin), and cofactors such as fibrin structure dictates kinetics (Heliyon 2024) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 5-6, hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 19-19).

DSPA vs human tPA: mechanistic distinctions
- DSPA isoforms (notably DSPAα1) lack K2 and the proteolytic activation site, remain single-chain with low intrinsic activity, and exhibit extreme fibrin dependence; consequently, DSPA shows minimal fluid-phase plasmin generation and comparatively reduced neurotoxicity in preclinical systems (Medcalf 2012) (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 2-3, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 3-5, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 9-10, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 14-14, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 13-14).
- Human tPA has broader receptor/cell interactions (LRP, NMDAR, PDGF‑CC) with implications for BBB permeability and CNS effects; these may be attenuated for DSPA due to domain differences (Medcalf 2012) (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 9-10, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 14-14).

Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Tenecteplase (TNK), a genetically modified tPA, demonstrates increased PAI‑1 resistance, higher fibrin specificity, and a longer half-life permitting single-bolus administration. A 2024 systematic review/meta‑analysis in the extended window (>4.5 h; three RCTs; 556 TNK vs 560 controls) found increased odds of excellent 90‑day functional outcome (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01–1.36) with similar symptomatic ICH and mortality (Therap Adv Neurol Disord, 2024-01; https://doi.org/10.1177/17562864231221324) (palaiodimou2024tenecteplaseforthe pages 1-3).
- 2024 late-window trials: TIMELESS (n=458) found TNK safe up to 24 h with no difference in median mRS at 90 days; TRACE‑III (n=516) reported improved 90‑day functional outcome with TNK 4.5–24 h (33.0% vs 24.2%; RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04–1.81), with no increase in mortality or symptomatic ICH (BMJ, 2025-05; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2023-076161) (sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 1-2, sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 3-3, sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 2-3).
- Novel delivery concepts: tPA immobilized on micrometer-scale beads increased local plasmin generation and enabled near-complete thrombus removal in mice at doses nearly two orders of magnitude below standard free tPA, suggesting a route to reduce systemic bleeding (bioRxiv, 2024-11; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.06.621942) (osmond2024harnessingmicrometerscaletpa pages 1-4).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Intravenous alteplase remains widely used for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours; tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg, single bolus) is increasingly adopted in many centers and is endorsed by European guidance as an alternative with comparable efficacy and safety, especially given logistical advantages (Therap Adv Neurol Disord, 2024-01; BMJ 2025-05) (palaiodimou2024tenecteplaseforthe pages 1-3, sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 1-2, sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 3-3).
- Desmoteplase clinical programs: pooled randomized evidence in the 3–9 h window has been neutral for functional benefit overall, with dose/time-dependent safety signals (Sci Rep, 2016-09; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep33989). Early DIAS/DEDAS studies suggested recanalization at higher doses but subsequent DIAS‑2/3 did not show improved 90‑day outcomes (Medcalf 2012; Br J Pharmacol 2012-01) (shi2016desmoteplaseforacute pages 1-2, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 9-10).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Contemporary reviews emphasize engineering objectives for next-generation thrombolytics: longer half-life, higher fibrin specificity, improved PAI‑1 resistance, and targeted delivery to enhance efficacy while reducing hemorrhage (Heliyon 2024) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7, hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 19-20).
- Clinical expert synthesis indicates TNK is operationally favored in many centers due to single-bolus administration and expanding evidence base; late-window efficacy appears context-dependent with imaging selection (BMJ 2025-05) (sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 1-2, sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 3-3, sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 2-3).
- Mechanistic expert view (Medcalf) highlights DSPA’s evolutionary optimization for fibrin specificity and reduced neurotoxicity potential compared with tPA, while noting the lack of consistent clinical benefit in RCTs to date—underscoring the importance of patient selection and delivery strategies (Br J Pharmacol 2012-01) (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 2-3, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 9-10, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 14-14, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 13-14).

Relevant statistics and study data
- Tenecteplase extended-window meta-analysis (3 RCTs): excellent functional outcome RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.01–1.36); sICH RR 1.67 (95% CI 0.70–4.00) not significantly different; mortality RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.81–1.49) not significantly different (2024-01) (palaiodimou2024tenecteplaseforthe pages 1-3).
- TIMELESS (2024): n=458; neutral primary outcome (median mRS 3 vs 3; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.82–1.57), safe profile (BMJ 2025-05) (sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 1-2).
- TRACE‑III (2024): n=516; 90‑day functional outcome 33.0% vs 24.2%; RR 1.37 (95% CI 1.04–1.81); no increase in sICH/mortality (BMJ 2025-05) (sharma2025advancesintreatments pages 1-2).
- Desmoteplase pooled RCTs: n=819 across 5 trials; neutral effect on favorable 90‑day outcome (P=0.42); ICH overall P=0.64; higher ICH risk at 90 μg/kg and 6–9 h window; 125 μg/kg trending higher recanalization (P=0.05) but increased mortality (P=0.04) (Sci Rep 2016-09) (shi2016desmoteplaseforacute pages 1-2).

Functional annotation for K9IJK6 (D. rotundus tPA/DSPA)
- Primary function: secreted serine protease converting plasminogen to plasmin; strongly fibrin-dependent activation that confines activity to clots. DSPA isoforms display heightened fibrin specificity versus human tPA and lack the proteolytic activation cleavage observed in human tPA, remaining single-chain with activation upon fibrin binding (Heliyon 2024; Medcalf 2012) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 3-5, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 12-13).
- Substrate specificity: plasminogen; activation is markedly enhanced on polymeric fibrin, with negligible fluid-phase plasmin generation compared to human tPA (Medcalf 2012) (medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 12-13, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 13-14).
- Inhibitors: PAI‑1 potently inhibits human tPA; engineered variants increase resistance. DSPA’s domain differences likely reduce PAI‑1 and neuroserpin susceptibility relative to human tPA, though precise kinetics vary across isoforms and reports (Heliyon 2024; Medcalf 2012) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 2-3, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 3-5).
- Localization: extracellular/secreted; in bats produced in salivary glands; in mammalian physiology tPA is secreted by endothelial cells into plasma (Heliyon 2024; Medcalf 2012) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 19-20, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 12-13).
- Pathways: fibrinolysis (plasminogen→plasmin), regulated by PAI‑1 and α2‑antiplasmin; implications for BBB and CNS interactions differ between tPA and DSPA because of domain architecture (Heliyon 2024; Medcalf 2012) (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 5-6, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 9-10, medcalf2012desmoteplasediscoveryinsights pages 14-14).

- The gene symbol for K9IJK6 is not specified in UniProt; identity relies on UniProt’s accession and annotation plus concordant literature on vampire bat DSPA family members. DSPA-specific clinical work largely precedes 2020; 2023–2024 updates chiefly pertain to human-engineered tPA variants (tenecteplase) and delivery innovations (hazare2024diverseoriginsof pages 6-7, palaiodimou2024tenecteplaseforthe pages 1-3, osmond2024harnessingmicrometerscaletpa pages 1-4).
