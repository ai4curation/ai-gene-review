# K9IJK6 Research Notes

## Key findings
- UniProt names this protein t-plasminogen activator [file:DESRO/K9IJK6/K9IJK6-uniprot.txt "RecName: Full=t-plasminogen activator"].
- UniProt indicates the protein is secreted [file:DESRO/K9IJK6/K9IJK6-uniprot.txt "SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted"].
- Deep research identifies K9IJK6 as a tPA-like serine protease from vampire bat [file:DESRO/K9IJK6/K9IJK6-deep-research-falcon.md "The UniProt accession K9IJK6 corresponds to a tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)-like serine protease (EC 3.4.21.68) from the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus."].
- UniProt cautions that conserved residues required for feature propagation are missing [file:DESRO/K9IJK6/K9IJK6-uniprot.txt "CAUTION: Lacks conserved residue(s) required for the propagation of"].
