## Analysis Summary

### Expected Findings:
- Cys103Ala mutant (2X1C) should show Ala at position 103
- Wild-type structures (2X1D, 2X1E) should show Cys at position 103
- Mature forms should be cleaved into multiple chains
- Cleavage occurs between Gly102 and Cys103

## Conclusions

- Cys103 is the catalytic nucleophile that initiates autoproteolytic cleavage
- The enzyme undergoes autocatalytic cleavage between Gly102 and Cys103
- The mature enzyme exists as heterodimeric subunits after cleavage
- This validates the cysteine-type peptidase activity (GO:0008234) annotation
