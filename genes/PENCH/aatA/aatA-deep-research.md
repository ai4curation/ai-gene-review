# Penicillium chrysogenum **aatA** Gene – Comprehensive Profile

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanism  
The **aatA gene** of *Penicillium chrysogenum* encodes an enzyme **acyl-coenzyme A:isopenicillin N acyltransferase (IAT)**, which catalyzes the final step of penicillin biosynthesis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=The%20final%20step%20of%20penicillin,In%20contrast%20to)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=The%20production%20of%20penicillin%20has,for%20a%20hydrophobic%20acyl%20group)). This enzyme removes the hydrophilic L-α-aminoadipate side chain from isopenicillin N (IPN) and replaces it with a hydrophobic acyl group (e.g. phenylacetyl-CoA), converting IPN into penicillin (Penicillin G when phenylacetate is the side chain precursor) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=The%20production%20of%20penicillin%20has,for%20a%20hydrophobic%20acyl%20group)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=coli%20producing%20the%2040,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)). Biochemically, IAT exhibits **acyltransferase activity**: it can hydrolyze IPN to form the intermediate 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) and then acylate 6-APA with an activated acyl-CoA ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=coli%20producing%20the%2040,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)). Notably, a single gene product is responsible for this two-step conversion, demonstrating that **aatA (penDE)** alone suffices to convert IPN to penicillin G ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=coli%20producing%20the%2040,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)). The enzyme shows broad substrate flexibility in vitro, accepting various acyl-CoA donors (e.g. phenylacetyl-CoA for penicillin G, phenoxyacetyl-CoA for penicillin V) ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=phenoxyacetic%20acid%2C%20by%20acyl,penDE%29%20%5B7%2C%2010%E2%80%9313%5D.%20Present)).  

Structurally, the IAT enzyme is initially synthesized as an ~40 kDa precursor polypeptide, which undergoes **autocatalytic cleavage** to yield a heterodimer of ~29 kDa and ~11 kDa subunits ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=presence%20of%20phenylacetyl%20coenzyme%20A,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)). This self-processing generates a new N-terminal residue (Serine or Threonine) on the smaller subunit that acts as the catalytic nucleophile, classifying IAT as an **N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=to%20the%20penicillin%20gene%20cluster,penicillin%20producer)). Indeed, *P. chrysogenum* IAT and its orthologs conserve a characteristic motif required for autocatalytic cleavage, indicating they belong to the Ntn-hydrolase family ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=to%20the%20penicillin%20gene%20cluster,penicillin%20producer)). The active enzyme’s mechanism is akin to penicillin amidases: the nucleophilic N-terminal Ser hydrolyzes the amide bond of IPN (releasing free L-α-aminoadipate) and forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate, which is then resolved by transfer of a new acyl group to the penicillin nucleus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=coli%20producing%20the%2040,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)). The enzyme thereby exhibits multiple activities — **isopenicillin N amidohydrolase**, **6-APA acyltransferase**, and **penicillin amidase** — all encoded by the single **aatA/penDE** gene product ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16321143/#:~:text=Similar%20articles%20%2A%20The%20isopenicillin,E%2C%20Guti%C3%A9rrez%20S%2C%20D%C3%ADez%20B)). Functionally, this step is essential for producing β-lactam antibiotics with different side chains and is **rate-limiting** under some conditions, as increasing IAT levels can boost penicillin yield ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=Genome%20mining%20led%20to%20the,the%20penicillin%20titre%20more%20than)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=of%20penicillin%20producers%2C%20but%20a,and%20AnBH1%2C%20by%20binding%20to)). Importantly, the aatA-encoded IAT has no known homolog in bacteria ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=The%20final%20step%20of%20penicillin,and%20aatB%20are%20bound%20and)), reflecting a unique evolutionary innovation in fungi for penicillin biosynthesis.

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
The AatA (IAT) enzyme is predominantly localized in **peroxisomes (microbodies)** within the fungal cell ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452670/#:~:text=Penicillium%20chrysogenum%20hyphae%20has%20been,A%20positive%20correlation%20was%20found)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=The%20production%20of%20penicillin%20has,for%20a%20hydrophobic%20acyl%20group)). Immuno-electron microscopy and cell fractionation studies showed that the acyltransferase of penicillin biosynthesis resides in organelles ~200–800 nm in diameter, identified as microbodies (peroxisomes) in *P. chrysogenum* hyphae ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452670/#:~:text=Penicillium%20chrysogenum%20hyphae%20has%20been,A%20positive%20correlation%20was%20found)). Consistently, the AatA protein carries a **peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1)** at its C-terminus, which mediates its import into peroxisomes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=blot%20analysis%20indicated%20that%20the,the%20penicillin%20titre%20more%20than)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=a%20putative%20penDE%20paralogue%20was,of%20them%2C%20aatA%2C%20was%20recruited)). The PTS1 of *P. chrysogenum* IAT is an unusual but functional tripeptide sequence (e.g., “AKL” instead of the canonical “SKL”) that directs the enzyme to the peroxisomal matrix ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=Peroxisomal%20localization%20of%20the%20third,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=a%20putative%20penDE%20paralogue%20was,of%20them%2C%20aatA%2C%20was%20recruited)). The peroxisomal compartmentalization is biologically significant: peroxisomes host certain steps of penicillin biosynthesis, likely including activation of side-chain precursors (phenylacetyl-CoA formation via β-oxidation or ligation) and efficient enzymatic coupling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=a%20putative%20penDE%20paralogue%20was,of%20them%2C%20aatA%2C%20was%20recruited)). In *P. chrysogenum*, mislocalization of IAT (for example, by removing its PTS1 or in peroxisome-deficient mutants) dramatically impairs penicillin production ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=Peroxisomal%20localization%20of%20the%20third,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=mediated%20by%20its%20atypical%20peroxisomal,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum)), highlighting that correct peroxisomal targeting is **critical for full enzymatic function in vivo**. (This contrasts with *Aspergillus nidulans*, where a fraction of penicillin can still be made with cytosolic IAT ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=Peroxisomal%20localization%20of%20the%20third,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum))). In summary, **AatA is a peroxisomal matrix enzyme** (GO:0005777) whose proper localization to microbodies is required for efficient antibiotic biosynthesis.

## Biological Processes Involvement  
The aatA gene is a core component of the **penicillin biosynthetic process (GO:0042318)**. Together with two upstream genes (*pcbAB* and *pcbC*), it forms part of the penicillin gene cluster responsible for the stepwise conversion of amino acids into β-lactam antibiotics ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=phenoxyacetic%20acid%2C%20by%20acyl,penDE%29%20%5B7%2C%2010%E2%80%9313%5D.%20Present)) ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=Penicillium%20chrysogenum%2C%20penicillin%20gene%20clusters,14%5D%20spontaneous%20recombinations%20between)). Specifically, **aatA participates in secondary metabolite biosynthesis**, enabling the fungus to produce penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) when provided with phenylacetic acid, or penicillin V when provided with phenoxyacetic acid as the side-chain precursors ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=phenoxyacetic%20acid%2C%20by%20acyl,penDE%29%20%5B7%2C%2010%E2%80%9313%5D.%20Present)). Loss-of-function mutations or deletion of *aatA* (penDE) abolish penicillin production in *P. chrysogenum*, causing a **“non-producing” phenotype** ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=indicate%20putative%20%27single%20copy%27%20penicillin,producing%20isolate%20npe10%3B%20W)). For instance, *P. chrysogenum* mutants defective in penDE (historically named npe mutants) fail to convert isopenicillin N to penicillin, accumulating pathway intermediates and losing antibiotic synthesis capability ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=indicate%20putative%20%27single%20copy%27%20penicillin,producing%20isolate%20npe10%3B%20W)). Conversely, overexpression or multi-copy amplification of *aatA* elevates penicillin titers ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=lacks%20a%20peroxisomal%20targeting%20sequence,ascomycetes%20revealed%20the%20presence%20of)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=blot%20analysis%20indicated%20that%20the,the%20penicillin%20titre%20more%20than)), underscoring its involvement as a potential rate-limiting step in the **β-lactam antibiotic biosynthetic pathway**. Beyond antibiotic biosynthesis, *aatA* expression and activity indirectly influence **cellular metabolism** – for example, active penicillin production may drain precursors (like amino acids) and trigger compensatory upregulation of nitrogen metabolism genes ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=penicillin%20gene%20cluster%20resulted%20in,focusing%20of%20functional%20analysis%20studies)) ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=The%20specific%20rate%20of%20%CE%B2,chain%20precursor%20%28e.g)). However, *aatA* is not known to play roles outside secondary metabolism; it is highly specialized for penicillin/β-lactam antibiotic production. Consistent with this, homologs of *aatA* are found exclusively in penicillin-producing species and co-localize in the penicillin gene cluster ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=overexpression%20of%20the%20wild,penicillin%20biosynthesis%20gene%20cluster%20by)), indicating that its biological role evolved specifically for **antibiotic biosynthesis** rather than primary cellular processes.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The AatA protein (isopenicillin N acyltransferase) is a **bifunctional enzyme** with distinct structural features supporting its activity. It belongs to the **Ntn-hydrolase superfamily**, characterized by an autocatalytic cleavage that generates a new N-terminal catalytic residue ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=to%20the%20penicillin%20gene%20cluster,penicillin%20producer)). The translated polypeptide (~p40) contains an **autoproteolytic cleavage site** – a conserved motif (typically containing a Ser/Thr) – that is essential for self-processing into an α-subunit (~11 kDa) and a β-subunit (~29 kDa) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=presence%20of%20phenylacetyl%20coenzyme%20A,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=to%20the%20penicillin%20gene%20cluster,penicillin%20producer)). This cleavage divides AatA into two domains: the small N-terminal domain (after cleavage, it becomes the **active catalytic subunit with a free N-terminal Ser/Thr**), and the larger C-terminal domain which completes the enzyme’s quaternary structure ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=presence%20of%20phenylacetyl%20coenzyme%20A,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)). The N-terminal serine (or threonine) of the β-subunit serves as the catalytic nucleophile in the enzyme’s active site, analogous to bacterial penicillin acylases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=to%20the%20penicillin%20gene%20cluster,penicillin%20producer)). The protein’s tertiary structure has not been crystallized from *P. chrysogenum*, but by homology it is expected to form a barrel-like fold typical of penicillin acyltransferases, with the active site nestled at the interface of the subunits. 

In terms of **functional domains**, AatA does not have multiple separately folded domains (it is a single-chain enzyme that cleaves into two parts, both of which remain associated). It contains sequence motifs common to β-lactam acyltransferases and amidases, including the conserved catalytic **Ser-Lys** dyad and oxyanion hole motif for acyl-transfer chemistry (e.g., a conserved glutamate or glycine-rich loop stabilizing transition state) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16321143/#:~:text=Similar%20articles%20%2A%20The%20isopenicillin,E%2C%20Guti%C3%A9rrez%20S%2C%20D%C3%ADez%20B)). The extreme **C-terminus contains a PTS1 tripeptide** (such as `SRL` or `AKL` – single-letter amino acids) required for peroxisomal import ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=blot%20analysis%20indicated%20that%20the,the%20penicillin%20titre%20more%20than)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=a%20putative%20penDE%20paralogue%20was,of%20them%2C%20aatA%2C%20was%20recruited)). Notably, while AatA’s primary sequence has three introns (in *P. chrysogenum* and *A. nidulans* genes) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=The%20penDE%20gene%20has%20a,The%20aatB)), the coding sequence encodes a **polypeptide of ~357 amino acids** (in *P. chrysogenum* penDE) that is functional after intron splicing and self-cleavage. No transmembrane segments or signal peptides are present, consistent with AatA being a soluble enzyme in the peroxisomal matrix. Instead, the enzyme’s key structural feature is its **heterodimeric active form** and the **N-terminal nucleophile catalytic mechanism**, distinguishing it from typical cytosolic transferases. These structural traits have been confirmed by sequence analysis and mutational studies: for example, site-directed mutations in the cleavage motif abolish activity by preventing proper subunit formation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=them%20conserve%20the%20essential%20motif,and%20they%20form%20a%20separate)). All known orthologs of AatA conserve this self-cleaving, heterodimer-forming architecture, indicating that these domains/features are crucial for function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=to%20the%20penicillin%20gene%20cluster,penicillin%20producer)). 

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Expression of the *aatA* gene is tightly regulated as part of the penicillin biosynthetic cluster. In *P. chrysogenum*, *aatA (penDE)* is co-regulated with the upstream *pcbAB* and *pcbC* genes, often from a **shared bidirectional promoter region** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=genes%20are%20expressed%20from%20a,1%2C%208%2C%209%2C%2055%2C%2060)). A 1.1-kb intergenic region controls divergent transcription of *pcbC* and *penDE*, allowing coordinated expression of the second and third pathway enzymes ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=genes%20are%20expressed%20from%20a,1%2C%208%2C%209%2C%2055%2C%2060)). The cluster’s expression is subject to **complex nutritional and developmental regulation** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=genes%20are%20expressed%20from%20a,1%2C%208%2C%209%2C%2055%2C%2060)). For instance, **carbon source** affects *aatA* expression: high glucose represses transcription of penicillin biosynthesis genes (catabolite repression), independent of pH effects ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=crassa%20binds%20strongly%20to%20a,decrease%20in%20pH%20and%20is)). This likely involves the CreA/Cre1 glucose repression system, as penicillin production is favored in carbon-limited conditions. **Nitrogen regulation** also plays a role – promoter analysis identified GATA motifs, and nitrogen regulatory proteins (e.g. AreA in fungi) bind these sites ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=pcbC%20bidirectional%20promoter,Ind)). Under nitrogen starvation or certain amino acid limitations, *aatA* expression is de-repressed, aligning with the concept that secondary metabolism (including antibiotic production) is activated when primary growth is limited ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=genes%20are%20expressed%20from%20a,1%2C%208%2C%209%2C%2055%2C%2060)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=crassa%20binds%20strongly%20to%20a,decrease%20in%20pH%20and%20is)). 

Moreover, specific inducers greatly elevate *aatA* expression. The presence of the side-chain precursor **phenylacetic acid (PAA)** is a well-known inducer of the penicillin gene cluster ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=The%20specific%20rate%20of%20%CE%B2,chain%20precursor%20%28e.g)). In cultivations of *P. chrysogenum*, adding PAA leads to increased transcription of *pcbAB, pcbC,* and *penDE*, correlating with penicillin G production ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=The%20specific%20rate%20of%20%CE%B2,chain%20precursor%20%28e.g)) ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=independent%20chemostat%20cultures%20were%20analysed,lactam%20intermediates.%20The%20small)). The fungus senses PAA and upregulates the pathway to assimilate this precursor into the antibiotic. In contrast, in the absence of PAA (or presence of non-inducing conditions), *aatA* expression remains basal and penicillin production is minimal ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=independent%20chemostat%20cultures%20were%20analysed,lactam%20intermediates.%20The%20small)). Experimentally, a *P. chrysogenum* strain where the entire penicillin cluster was deleted showed no induction by PAA and diverted metabolic capacity to other secondary metabolites ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=based%20analysis%20on%20chemostat%20cultures,Furthermore%2C%20the%20number%20of)), indicating that *aatA* (along with *pcbAB/C*) is the primary PAA-responsive gene set. 

**Developmental and global regulators** also impact *aatA* expression. *P. chrysogenum* and *A. nidulans* carry pathway-specific regulators; for example, a C6 zinc-cluster protein (encoded by *pcbR* or *anaPc* in some species) has been implicated in activating the penicillin cluster genes under appropriate conditions ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=Genes%20for%20the%20biosynthesis%20of,in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum%2C%20Aspergillus%20nidulans)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=pcbC%20bidirectional%20promoter,Ind)). Additionally, global regulators of secondary metabolism such as **LaeA** (a methyltransferase influencing chromatin state) and the **Velvet complex** are known in Aspergilli to broadly control secondary metabolite gene clusters; deletion of *laeA* in *P. chrysogenum* leads to reduced penicillin gene expression and antibiotic titers ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=Regulatory%20Proteins%20Interact%20with%20a,of%20the%20pcbAB%20and%20pcbC)). The *aatA* promoter is also a target of general transcription factors: studies in *A. nidulans* identified two proteins, termed **AnCF** and **AnBH1**, that bind and regulate both *aatA* and its paralog *aatB* ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=similar%20structure%20and%20expression%20pattern,the%20penicillin%20titre%20more%20than)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=lacks%20a%20peroxisomal%20targeting%20sequence,ascomycetes%20revealed%20the%20presence%20of)). These factors appear to be conserved, likely corresponding to a CCAAT-binding complex (Hap complex) and another bZIP or Zn(II)2Cys6 regulator, respectively. In summary, *aatA* is **tightly regulated** by carbon and nitrogen catabolite repression, induced by precursor availability, and modulated by both cluster-specific and global regulatory proteins. Expression is upregulated in stationary phase or idiophase of fungal growth (when nutrients deplete and secondary metabolism kicks in), ensuring penicillin is produced in the later growth stages ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=genes%20are%20expressed%20from%20a,1%2C%208%2C%209%2C%2055%2C%2060)). 

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
As a gene from a filamentous fungus, *P. chrysogenum* **aatA** is not directly associated with human diseases. *Penicillium chrysogenum* (also known as *P. rubens*) is generally considered a saprophytic organism and is world-renowned for antibiotic production rather than pathogenicity. There are **no known inherited or pathogenic “disease” mutations** relevant to *aatA*, since it is not a human gene. In rare cases, *P. chrysogenum* can act as an opportunistic pathogen (causing, for example, necrotizing pneumonia or cutaneous infections in immunocompromised individuals) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9399551/#:~:text=PubMed%20pubmed,due%20to%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum%20in)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27596684/#:~:text=Disseminated%20penicilliosis%20due%20to%20Penicillium,Sch%C3%B6nlein%20purpura%20and%20proliferative)), but *aatA* is not implicated in virulence or pathogenic processes in those instances. Instead, the “phenotypes” of interest for *aatA* are mainly **industrial and biochemical**. From a biotechnology perspective, *aatA* function is crucial for penicillin production, so its disruption yields a **“non-producing” phenotype** in fungal strains ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=indicate%20putative%20%27single%20copy%27%20penicillin,producing%20isolate%20npe10%3B%20W)). Classic studies identified mutant strains (e.g., npe mutants) where spontaneous mutations in *penDE* (aatA) led to loss of penicillin biosynthesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC196331/#:~:text=mutations%20by%20constructing%20hybrid%20isopenicillin,processed%20into%20the%20component%20subunits)). These mutants typically show normal growth of the fungus but accumulate isopenicillin N (or 6-APA) without secreting penicillin, confirming that *aatA* inactivation specifically knocks out antibiotic production ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=indicate%20putative%20%27single%20copy%27%20penicillin,producing%20isolate%20npe10%3B%20W)). Complementation of such mutants with a functional *aatA* gene restores penicillin synthesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC196331/#:~:text=mutations%20by%20constructing%20hybrid%20isopenicillin,processed%20into%20the%20component%20subunits)). Another phenotype is observed under peroxisomal dysfunction: *P. chrysogenum* strains defective in peroxisome biogenesis (or harboring a mutated PTS1 on IAT) have drastically lower penicillin yields, linking the *aatA* gene product’s localization to the antibiotic-producing phenotype ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=Peroxisomal%20localization%20of%20the%20third,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=mediated%20by%20its%20atypical%20peroxisomal,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum)). In strain improvement programs, *aatA* is often amplified (multiple copies) along with other cluster genes; high-producing industrial strains of *P. chrysogenum* carry tandem repeats of the penicillin gene cluster, resulting in elevated *aatA* expression and increased penicillin output ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=Penicillium%20chrysogenum%2C%20penicillin%20gene%20clusters,14%5D%20spontaneous%20recombinations%20between)) ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=diagnostic%20PCR%20for%20the%20%CE%B2,flanking)). This **gene dosage effect** underscores *aatA*’s importance in the production phenotype. While *aatA* itself is not linked to human disease, its product – penicillin – is medically significant, and loss of *aatA* function would eliminate penicillin biosynthesis, thereby indirectly affecting the organism’s ecological interactions (e.g., reduced ability to inhibit competing microbes). There are no direct **disease ontology terms** for *aatA*, but experimentally the gene’s **loss-of-function phenotype** is “abolished antibiotic production,” and **overexpression phenotype** is “increased penicillin titer” ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=lacks%20a%20peroxisomal%20targeting%20sequence,ascomycetes%20revealed%20the%20presence%20of)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=Genome%20mining%20led%20to%20the,the%20penicillin%20titre%20more%20than)). 

## Evolutionary Conservation  
The *aatA* gene appears to be an evolutionary novelty confined to **penicillin-producing fungi**. Orthologs of *P. chrysogenum aatA* (often named **penDE** in Penicillia or **aatA** in *Aspergillus nidulans*) have been identified only in a small clade of ascomycetes that synthesize β-lactam antibiotics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=Aspergillus%20spp,penicillin%20producer)). For example, *A. nidulans* possesses an aatA gene in its penicillin cluster that is functionally equivalent to *penDE* ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=The%20final%20step%20of%20penicillin,In%20contrast%20to)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=The%20production%20of%20penicillin%20has,for%20a%20hydrophobic%20acyl%20group)), and *Aspergillus oryzae* (which has the penicillin gene cluster) also carries a homolog ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=Aspergillus%20spp,One%20of%20these)). Outside of these cases, no close **bacterial or fungal homolog** of aatA has been found in organisms that do not produce penicillins ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=gene,Disruption%20of%20aatB%20resulted%20in)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=Aspergillus%20spp,One%20of%20these)). This is consistent with penicillin biosynthesis being a specialized secondary metabolism – the genes were likely acquired or evolved in a common ancestor of Penicillium and certain Aspergillus species ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=Aspergillus%20spp,is%20that%20the%20ial%20gene)). Interestingly, **aatA homologs have three introns and a eukaryotic gene architecture**, suggesting a eukaryotic origin (unlike the *pcbAB* gene, which is giant and might have bacterial origin) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=The%20penDE%20gene%20has%20a,The%20aatB)). Evolutionary studies propose that *penDE/aatA* arose by gene **duplication and divergence** from a pre-existing ancestral enzyme in fungi ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=DNA%20fragments%2C%20one%20of%20them,while%20the%20ial)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=are%20regulated%20by%20the%20same,123%2C164%5D.%20All%20of)). In *A. nidulans*, researchers discovered a **paralogous gene** named *aatB* (AN6775) that shares structure and partial function with *aatA*, though *aatB* lies outside the penicillin cluster ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=gene,disruption%20strain%28leading%20to)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=Genome%20mining%20led%20to%20the,aatA%20are%20exclusively%20part%20of)). *AatB* is considered a non-cluster paralog present in some fungi (even those that don’t make penicillin), possibly representing the ancestral gene copy ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=peroxisomal%20localization%20of%20AatB,penicillin%20biosynthesis%20gene%20cluster%20by)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=DNA%20fragments%2C%20one%20of%20them,while%20the%20ial)). *AatB* lacks a peroxisomal targeting signal and encodes a cytosolic enzyme with low penicillin acyltransferase activity, yet it can partially compensate for *aatA* disruption when targeted to peroxisomes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=blot%20analysis%20indicated%20that%20the,penicillin%20biosynthesis%20gene%20cluster%20by)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=a%20putative%20penDE%20paralogue%20was,of%20them%2C%20aatA%2C%20was%20recruited)). The presence of *aatB* in certain fungi (e.g., *Aspergillus terreus*, a non-penicillin producer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=phylogenetic%20clade%2C%20whereas%20penDE%20,aatA%2FpenDE%20and%20aatB%29%2C%20and))) and the widespread distribution of distant **“IAT-like” (ial)** genes in many ascomycetes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=of%20penicillin%20producers%2C%20but%20a,and%20AnBH1%2C%20by%20binding%20to)) suggest that the **penDE/aatA lineage** was derived from a more ancient enzyme family. Phylogenetic analyses show that *aatA* (penDE) genes cluster tightly with each other (only penicillin-producers) while the *ial* genes form a separate clade of related Ntn-hydrolases found in various fungi ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=them%20conserve%20the%20essential%20motif,penicillin%20producer)). These *ial* homologs have 0–2 introns and generally lack robust acyltransferase activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=of%20penicillin%20producers%2C%20but%20a,and%20AnBH1%2C%20by%20binding%20to)), implying they serve a different physiological role. In summary, *aatA* is **highly conserved within the penicillin-producing lineage** but absent in most other organisms. Its evolution likely involved recruitment of a duplicated **Ntn-hydrolase** gene into the β-lactam gene cluster, acquisition of peroxisomal targeting (PTS1) for subcellular localization, and optimization for penicillin biosynthesis  ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=homologues%20contain%20less%20than%20three,This%20hypothesis%20involves%20the)). This makes *aatA* a notable example of a **specialized, horizontally clustered enzyme** in fungal secondary metabolism. 

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
- **Gene Identification and Function**: The *penDE* gene encoding IAT was cloned and characterized in late 1980s–1990 by researchers including Barredo, Diez, and Martin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC196331/#:~:text=isopenicillin%20N,Google%20Scholar)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=coli%20producing%20the%2040,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)). They demonstrated that E. coli expressing *P. chrysogenum* penDE could convert IPN to penicillin G, proving *aatA* is the only gene required for that biosynthetic step ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=coli%20producing%20the%2040,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)). Alvarez *et al.* (1987–1991) further showed the enzyme’s dual amidase/acyltransferase activities and self-processing nature ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16321143/#:~:text=Similar%20articles%20%2A%20The%20isopenicillin,E%2C%20Guti%C3%A9rrez%20S%2C%20D%C3%ADez%20B)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=presence%20of%20phenylacetyl%20coenzyme%20A,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)).  
- **Localization**: Müller *et al.* (1991, EMBO J.) provided the first evidence that IAT is peroxisomal, using immunogold labeling to visualize the enzyme in microbodies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452670/#:~:text=Penicillium%20chrysogenum%20hyphae%20has%20been,A%20positive%20correlation%20was%20found)). This was corroborated by later studies (Bartoszewska *et al.*, 2011) examining peroxisome biogenesis mutants, which showed penicillin production defects when IAT mislocalized ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=Peroxisomal%20localization%20of%20the%20third,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=mediated%20by%20its%20atypical%20peroxisomal,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum)). The C-terminal sequence of IAT was noted to contain a PTS1 tripeptide responsible for this targeting ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=Peroxisomal%20localization%20of%20the%20third,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum)).  
- **Regulation**: Martin and colleagues (e.g., Martín, 2000, *J. Bacteriology* review) investigated the **bidirectional promoter** shared by *pcbC* and *penDE*, identifying binding sites for regulatory proteins (AreA, CREA, etc.) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=pcbC%20bidirectional%20promoter,Ind)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=crassa%20binds%20strongly%20to%20a,decrease%20in%20pH%20and%20is)). Experiments showed glucose repression of *aatA* and relief of repression under carbon limitation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111294/#:~:text=crassa%20binds%20strongly%20to%20a,decrease%20in%20pH%20and%20is)). Fernández-Cañón & Peñalva (1995) studied *A. nidulans* *aatA (penDE)* regulation, and found similar controls by ambient pH and nitrogen. More recently, gene expression profiling by van den Berg *et al.* (2008, *BMC Genomics*) confirmed that adding phenylacetic acid upregulates *penDE* transcription in high-producing strains ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=The%20specific%20rate%20of%20%CE%B2,chain%20precursor%20%28e.g)).  
- **Evolution and Paralogs**: The discovery of *aatB* in *A. nidulans* by García-Estrada *et al.* (2009, *Mol. Microbiology*) was a breakthrough ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=The%20final%20step%20of%20penicillin,In%20contrast%20to)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=Genome%20mining%20led%20to%20the,aatA%20are%20exclusively%20part%20of)). They disrupted *aatA* and surprisingly still observed penicillin, which led to genome mining and identification of the *aatB* gene ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=The%20final%20step%20of%20penicillin,In%20contrast%20to)). Their work demonstrated that *aatB* is a paralog regulated by the same factors as *aatA*, and that *aatA* was likely recruited into the penicillin cluster from a duplicate of *aatB* ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18942174/#:~:text=similar%20structure%20and%20expression%20pattern,aatB%20homologues%20also%20exist%20in)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=lacks%20a%20peroxisomal%20targeting%20sequence,ascomycetes%20revealed%20the%20presence%20of)). They also identified an *aatA* paralog in *P. chrysogenum* called *ial* (isopenicillin N acyltransferase-like), which however lacked IAT activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=of%20penicillin%20producers%2C%20but%20a,and%20AnBH1%2C%20by%20binding%20to)). Subsequent comparative genomics (e.g., in the 2022 review by Hoff *et al.*, *J. Fungi*) mapped the distribution of these genes across fungi and supported a model where *penDE/aatA* genes are unique to penicillin producers while *ial* genes are more ancient and widespread ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=them%20conserve%20the%20essential%20motif,penicillin%20producer)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8954384/#:~:text=phylogenetic%20clade%2C%20whereas%20penDE%20,aatA%2FpenDE%20and%20aatB%29%2C%20and)).  
- **Protein Structure/Mutagenesis**: Early mutational analysis by Ward *et al.* (1990s) isolated *P. chrysogenum* strains with loss-of-function in IAT (npe mutants) and mapped point mutations in *penDE*. A 1994 study characterized three such mutations, showing they did not prevent the 40-kDa precursor from being processed into subunits but abolished enzymatic activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC196331/#:~:text=mutations%20by%20constructing%20hybrid%20isopenicillin,processed%20into%20the%20component%20subunits)). This suggested those mutations likely hit catalytic residues. These and site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirm the importance of the N-terminal Ser of the β-subunit and other catalytic motifs. While no high-resolution crystal structure of AatA is published yet, homology models based on bacterial penicillin acylases (which share the Ntn-hydrolase fold) have been used to interpret such mutations.  
- **Industrial Relevance**: The role of *aatA* in penicillin production has also been exploited industrially. Transforming *Cephalosporium acremonium* (a cephalosporin producer) with the *P. chrysogenum penDE* gene endowed it with the ability to produce penicillin, demonstrating functional expression across species ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1900348/#:~:text=isopenicillin%20N%20acyltransferase%20in%20Cephalosporium,of%20three%20different%20strains%20of)). High-producing *P. chrysogenum* strains obtained through classical strain improvement were found to have multiple copies of *aatA*, and their transcript levels correlate with penicillin titer ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=Penicillium%20chrysogenum%2C%20penicillin%20gene%20clusters,14%5D%20spontaneous%20recombinations%20between)) ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=diagnostic%20PCR%20for%20the%20%CE%B2,flanking)). Recent studies on global regulators (e.g., *hdaA* – a histone deacetylase – deletion leads to secondary metabolism derepression) also noted **upregulation of penDE* in mutants that overproduce secondary metabolites ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6182556/#:~:text=3.%20RESULTS%20,from%20the%20chromosome%20in%20order)).  

**Relevant Gene Ontology (GO) Terms**: Based on the above evidence, the *aatA* gene product can be annotated with GO terms such as **“acyl-CoA:isopenicillin N N-acyltransferase activity”** (GO:0102920, encompassing its EC 2.3.1.164 enzymatic function) ([ctdbase.org](https://ctdbase.org/detail.go?acc=GO%3A0102920&type=go#:~:text=acyl%20coenzyme%20A%3A%20isopenicillin%20N,CoA%20%2B%20isopenicillin%20N)), **“penicillin biosynthetic process”** (GO:0042318) ([beta.glycosmos.org](https://beta.glycosmos.org/lectins/index?go_display=true&go_id_display=true&lfdb_ids_display=true&mcaw_ids_display=true&monosaccharide_specificities_display=true&organism_display=true&page=73&pdb_ids_display=true&protein_name_display=true&q%5Bgo_cont%5D=&q%5Bgo_id_cont%5D=&q%5Blfdb_ids_cont%5D=&q%5Bm%5D=or&q%5Bmcaw_ids_cont%5D=&q%5Bmonosaccharide_specificities_cont%5D=&q%5Borganism_cont%5D=&q%5Bpdb_ids_cont%5D=&q%5Bprotein_name_cont%5D=&q%5Bs%5D=monosaccharide_specificities+asc&q%5Bshort_names_cont%5D=&q%5Buniprot_id_cont%5D=&short_names_display=true&uniprot_id_display=true#:~:text=GlyCosmos%20Portal%20,GO%3A0042318%20Download%20data)) for its role in antibiotic production, and **“peroxisome”** (GO:0005777) for its cellular component ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=The%20production%20of%20penicillin%20has,for%20a%20hydrophobic%20acyl%20group)). These annotations are supported by the literature: IAT’s catalytic activity has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526911/#:~:text=coli%20producing%20the%2040,of%2011%20and%2029%20kDa)), its involvement in penicillin biosynthesis is genetically and biochemically proven ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-75#:~:text=phenoxyacetic%20acid%2C%20by%20acyl,penDE%29%20%5B7%2C%2010%E2%80%9313%5D.%20Present)), and its peroxisomal localization is confirmed by microscopy and sequence signals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452670/#:~:text=Penicillium%20chrysogenum%20hyphae%20has%20been,A%20positive%20correlation%20was%20found)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653248/#:~:text=mediated%20by%20its%20atypical%20peroxisomal,IAT%20mislocalization%20in%20Penicillium%20chrysogenum)). The curated knowledge of *aatA* provides a foundation for understanding the molecular biology of β-lactam antibiotic production and for guiding metabolic engineering efforts to enhance penicillin yields.
