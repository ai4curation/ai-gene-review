description: 'ZDS1 (also called HST1, encoding Protein Zds1) is a cortical/cytoplasmic
  adaptor protein that regulates the spatial localization and activity of the PP2A
  phosphatase complex containing the regulatory subunit Cdc55. Zds1 functions as a
  non-catalytic scaffold that binds Cdc55 and controls its nucleocytoplasmic distribution,
  thereby regulating two key mitotic transitions: (1) promoting mitotic entry by maintaining
  Cdc55-PP2A in the cytoplasm where it dephosphorylates Swe1 and activates Mih1 to
  enable Cdk1 activation, and (2) facilitating mitotic exit by excluding Cdc55 from
  the nucleus to prevent inhibition of Cdc14 release. Additionally, Zds1 serves as
  a Rho1 effector at the bud cortex, where it associates with Cdc55 to specify Rho1
  signaling outputs toward polarized growth and cell wall synthesis while antagonizing
  stress-responsive CWI signaling. Zds1 also participates in mRNA export from the
  nucleus via interactions with Dbp5 and Gfd1 at the nuclear pore complex.'

      summary: Zds1 is a cytoplasmic and cortical protein that binds Cdc55 and 
        controls PP2A-Cdc55 localization. IBA annotation from phylogenetic 
        inference is appropriate given extensive experimental evidence for 
        cytoplasmic localization.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Zds1 localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm and cortex, being 
        excluded from the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. This is central to 
        its function as a Cdc55 localization regulator. Multiple experimental 
        studies confirm cytoplasmic/cortical localization via GFP-tagging and

      reason: Zds1 has dual roles in cell polarity. First, as a negative

        genes. Second, as a Rho1 effector at the bud cortex, it associates with

    review:
      summary: IMP annotation claiming Zds1 inhibits protein phosphatase 
        activity. This annotation mischaracterizes Zds1's biochemical function 
        and mechanism.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: Zds1 is not a phosphatase inhibitor in the traditional sense 
        (e.g., not analogous to endogenous inhibitor proteins). Instead, Zds1 
        functions as a non-catalytic regulatory scaffold that binds Cdc55 and 
        controls PP2A-Cdc55 localization and activity in a spatially-restricted 
        manner. While Zds1 can modulate PP2A-Cdc55 function (inhibiting nuclear 
        activity while promoting cytoplasmic activity), this is achieved through
        compartmentalization, not through direct inhibition of the catalytic 
        machinery. The term "phosphatase inhibitor activity" is mechanistically

        buds. Direct evidence from GST-Zds1 fusion protein imaging confirms bud 
        tip enrichment.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Zds1 concentrates at bud tips, especially in small to medium-sized
        buds, which is consistent with its role in cell polarity and polarized 
        growth regulation. This subcellular localization is relevant to 
        understanding where Zds1 exerts its regulatory functions on the Rho1 and
        Cdc42 signaling pathways.

      reason: Zds1 relocates to the bud neck during late mitosis, coinciding 
        with its roles in regulating mitotic exit and cytokinesis. This dynamic

        genetic analysis of export-deficient mutants. Zds1 is part of the mRNA 
        export machinery at the NPC.

      reason: Zds1 is a functional component of the mRNA export machinery, 
        associating with Dbp5 and Gfd1 at the cytoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear
        pore complex. Deletion of ZDS1 exacerbates mRNA export defects in dbp5 
        and mex67 mutants, indicating Zds1 is required for optimal mRNA export.

        definitive evidence for Zds1's core function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Experimental studies directly demonstrate that Zds1 promotes G2/M 
        transition through spatial control of Cdc55. The zds1Δ zds2Δ mutant 
        exhibits severe G2 delay, abnormal morphology, and elevated Cdc28-Y19 
        phosphorylation. Introduction of a cytoplasm-localized Cdc55-NES fully 
        rescues these defects, proving the sufficiency and necessity of 
        Zds1-mediated Cdc55 cytoplasmic localization for mitotic entry. This is

      summary: IMP annotation for regulation of protein localization capturing 
        Zds1's central function in controlling Cdc55 nucleocytoplasmic 
        distribution. This is a core mechanistic function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Zds1's primary molecular mechanism is spatial regulation of 
        Cdc55-PP2A localization. Zds1 binds Cdc55 and controls its subcellular 
        distribution, promoting cytoplasmic/cortical localization while 
        excluding Cdc55 from the nucleus. This nucleocytoplasmic regulation of 
        Cdc55 is the fundamental mechanism underlying Zds1's roles in mitotic 
        entry, mitotic exit, and signaling output specification. The term 
        "regulation of protein localization" accurately and appropriately 
        describes this core function. This is one of Zds1's most important and
